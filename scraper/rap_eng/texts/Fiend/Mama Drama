[Mia X]
Ya'll best to back the fuck on up
It's mama drama my nigga
I'm shiva with two heaters
See I'm hardcore my nigga for sure my nigga
Ain't never been scared before my nigga
Ghetto from head to toe
When I got some lyrical foe my nigga
The mics the fo fo when trigga
Launchin my verbal scatter
That shit ya'll do ain't worth the urine
Sticking in my bladder
The yappin and the chit chatter
Don't even matter cause nothins fatter
Than rapper's faces after I verbally gat ya
Beat em like they was Hagler
Rip em like no good paper
That's why they duckin Mia X
Hip hops new heavy weighter
The soldier hater, disentegrator, major paper maker
The gangsta rhymer, big timer
I'm Mama Drama

Chorus
[Mia X, Fiend]
Uhh, where my real niggas that we can ride us
How many soldiers down to do what they gotta
Like Mama Drama
Uhh, where my real bitches that we can ride us
How many soldiers down to do what they gotta
Like Mama Drama

[Mia X]

Street date in all 51 states
They can't wait to hear my lyrical murder
The grim reaper, Mama Mia diva with the nerve ta
Sabotage ya'll, dressed in camouflage
Is my disguise daily
I'm a batterd woman thats surrounded
By them sharp kitchen knives baby
You gon realize that I ain't to be played with
I get payed with TRU, and I'm a made bitch
So what cha you wanna do, better call your crew
And tell em to come correct
But everything this way sho gon get Xed
Hexed I'm a voodoo mistress
Roots on all my lyrics, Ri Ri
Strong enough to make AMC
Don't fuck around, huff puff, then I blow em out
Then they all fall down now
They done told ya you gon know her when you see her
When you do, you gon pay me
Cause I come to do some damage
Have em frantic runnin to the table
With the record label sayin please would ya rap mine
Relief, hater she gon sit all in my face and gyrate
I'm irate, ain't no mistakes
I'm bout it bout it
Gangsta bitch rowdy rowdy TRU click
With that gangsta shit I'm bankin 6 figures
Dog and I ain't lyin
That's why Vibe gon let you know I'm in the high 9s
I'm squeezin mine if you run up nigga tryin
Mama Drama, Mia X, the underground unibomber
What

Chorus X2
