[Hook]
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
Got their ass with the scratch, nigga
But they keep comin', and they keep comin' back
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
I got that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
Got their ass with the scratch, nigga
Try to rob? Back, back, nigga, back, back

[Verse 1]
Trappin', trappin' harder than a bitch
Whip the 40 1 millimeter off of 36
Nigga fuck what you heard, I was the [?] for 10
Now it's 350 a 28 [?] have your money straight
You the type of nigga front out work, niggas don't ever pay
Shooters do you dirty, know the dot com is their resume
I get busy, don't hesitate
I'm heavy and you featherweight
Box Chevy on 28s, up and down the interstate
Smell still on me, prolly still got the scale
Tryna make it flip, it's either that or hit a lick
He took a hit and looked at me like, "What is this?"

[Hook]
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
Got their ass with the scratch, nigga
But they keep comin', and they keep comin' back
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
I got that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
Got their ass with the scratch, nigga
Try to rob? Back, back, nigga, back, back

[Verse 2]
I'm in a city full of work but all they want is that [?]
No cut on the dope like where the fuck is the DJ?
I bought that shit, weighed that shit and I sold it
Welcome to the [?], it's me and my Gs, hold it
We hold it, keep that guala, them dollars, I can't fold it
I'm so [?] my dog, she know it, I show it
Every time I step out the James Bond
Smokin' God's gift, I cross my arms like 17 times like yeah
Gotta sling that pot today, the flavors I got today
They all come back when it's A1
It's your play, B but this ain't no play gun

[Hook]
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
Got their ass with the scratch, nigga
But they keep comin', and they keep comin' back
This that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
I got that mothafuckin' pack, nigga
Got their ass with the scratch, nigga
Try to rob? Back, back, nigga, back, back
