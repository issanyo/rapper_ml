Yeaaah, race car driver, in my own fuckin' mind, Spitta Andretti, yes I'm
Anticipatin these niggas hatin' yeah they waitin' that's fine
Maco snap through the fishin' line. watch for the hook, Spitta bring it to just on time
On trees, like an ornament at Christmas time, on G's
But don't nothing move, til the money transfer, word to my crew
The green done colored my dreams blue, skeen, to slice that lead cake up, fuck them other niggas pay us
It's like I'm in it but not really in that Matrix, Ocean's 14, plot out new capers
Plant these money tree seeds, dollar bill leaves, leave me to rake it up
Wonderin' who they reserve first place fuck, those niggas, no pictures, babygirl roll those joints bigger

[Hook x2]
Fuzzy dice, velvet seats, mahogany upholstery, A/C, sunroof cracked, this that, OG shit, you smell that?

[Fiend:]
All my Crooks got Castles, wonderwoman have lassos, hotboy crack tab of Tabasco
Nas international, cash flow, smokin out the volcano, kush natural
Used to have indo in my afro, one man band conquer west ?
Shawty I could hit it out the park Satchel Paige
Damn I'm paid, thinkin' of all that money I made, since lookin' at the hip like I just got paged
Every summer, new car, new paint, girl I know you ain't frown with yo' pussy, you BAITCH!
I work too hard for " I can't", stay burnin that " Man that shit stank!"
I'm in ya city girl, you a thick lil somethin' I need one more for the Spitta girl
