[Verse 1]
All follow Mr. Jones, as he reminisce
Reminisce take chance to remember this
I was fifteen, anti-Fiend
Never thought I'd make it to music as a dream
All I had was Kevin and my momma Jackie
The pen and pad, and a half a pappy
Taught up from the brought up, that you gots to be hard
Shit, New Orleans the city, I remember fighting over wards
See Lord, before you give me the charge, peep my cause
I'm a nigga no more or less, surrounded by flaws
I'm all yours but understand my future thoughts are few
My days could be navy blue, and I'mma believe in You
See I'm true, because my niggas keep me going as well
Dropping tears cause I'm the only one alive to tell
And if I'm going to hell, at least my life was enriched
By keeping family beside me, and they accepted me as clique

[Hook 2x]
If I'm a soldier in Your world, live me long
Cause I done got my hustle on and I done done wrong
No one understands me, not even my family
That's why I believe in You, to see my ass through, my God

[Verse 2]
I entertains my brain with a cloud of smoke
My brother been gone for five years, and this is how I cope
I hope, wishing and praying that myself could be next
My girl died straight innocent but because of a ex
Got me vexed, drinking, loading my gun under the moon
And no matter how many bullets, bringing her back no time soon
I'm tired of departing, with killing, all of my dogs
Viewing bodies every other day, on Washington and Broad
Oh Lord, I'm even scary to open obituaries
Getting mail from cemetaries stating that I'm buried
Pain varies, to tell the truth it all hurts the same
You bound to see some rain, cause life is a strange game
Bullets don't carry names, but man, is life short
Now he on the life support, from not the right support
I hope the court lock the killer, and lose the key
A small fee, from what that nigga did to a family

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
Shit, I'm a reminisce like this while I'm in a good state of mind
Now or never, Lord truly knows, ain't no greater time
Down the line, I done lost some of my best partners
Bullet poppers got em cause around, wasn't the coppers
Now who's to blame, the hunted or the hunter?
Comfort his mom much as I can and wonder
Was my prayers to God injected or neglected
Question the Man if I can or respect it
Shit, suggested by many, since they gone best forget 'em
Seein' him be placed in the ground got me screamin, "Bury me with 'em"
My Lord, he never saw his newborn, a gorgeous daughter
Killing in my city like there's something in the water
Why bother? Because Fiend stranded here till I'm gone
And a soldier gon' survive till it's time to go home
Now notice I'm a survivor
My feelings go out to the family of G-Slimm, and Miss Michelle Tyler

[Hook 4x]
