[Fiend]
He never really saw the bullet coming, no type of instinct for running
I wish he would have came with me to London
I never knocked his hustle, I was the one that gave him muscle
And showed him how to make a missle snap a bone tissue
Red pepper the floors, only by the doors
Incase the D.E.A. got a drug sweep tour
To feed the kanine, look, I keep one on your waistline
A few thoughts if they really wanna chase mine
Why they wanna replace mine, shots of tequila when I chase mine
Want a bullet proof transpo, heres a number on who made mine
Smoking that gray pine, they save mine
I had to seek it, now I'm one of the ones that can speak it

[Mo B. Dick]
Yeah you didn't want to listen the first time nigga warned ya
But now nigga bring that pain to your ass now
Look where you at, look where you at now nigga
What?

[Kage]
Bitch, you bitch
The game's survival, follow motto of Fiend's eleven hollows
And if I woes my rivals, represent the cash to Austin Powers
Toss a towel, it's the arrival of the most powerful shots sprayed
Like your ex girlfriends, and goes, finger fuckin gun and ammos
Lay a centerfold who they feel like Congo
Fuck a knife when we jump out the Bronco
With the four fours, uptown desperado
Hit you with a Roy Jones combo, this ain't a boat load
To your afro, murder you, come to your funeral
Buck and peel low, it's a new time, here's the intro
Fuck with Fiend, you die, lose your vitals

[O'Dell]
You didn't see it coming, no type of instincts for running
I wish you would have came with me to London
You didn't see it coming, no type of instincts for running
I wish you would have came to London
You didn't see it coming, no type of instincts for running
I wish you would have came with me to London
You didn't see it coming, no type of instincts for running
I wish you would have came to London
