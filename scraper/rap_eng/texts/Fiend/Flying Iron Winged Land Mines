[Verse 1 - Currensy]
With the squeak of new sneakers
Bose speakers and rally striped two seaters
Alternate actress bitches
Double features
Your arms too short to box
So with peace you greet us
For the steps I walk and guided
In my presence the ocean divided
Even mother nature showed favor
Robins baskin backwards
Baggin my grass in thirty one flavors
Niggas ain't half... or twenty five percent
Live as i.. they dyin to be it
Ocean drive
I close my eyes and see it still
Got a place in my heart
So I talk with my realtor
Private terraces, measurements: lost
Something you niggas ain't never been: boss
Can't find your mom and your dad
In the grocery store panicking: lost

Jet life on lil niggas, for real

[Verse 2 - Fiend]
5 am rose bottle still chillin, still chillin
All-international Jones; hi, I'm illin, hi I'm..
Ghost specs, smoke the best
'Nuff fresh, congregation amended
Told me "hold the water" can't stand it
I'm cooly, cooly on the rapping
But who got action?
I ball a gram, I ball again
Y'all saw the Benz?
Who's got Ghost, 2 coupes, lot of Chevy's
Plenty of chrome spokes, I spoke, they knew
Money talk, I move, they see money walk
What? You didn't get enough mantime?
Naw, you was doing business like a
Cambodian landmine? Stock some bombs
Pop some bongs. Money never sleep
In the night I beat - harm, harm

You know it's time to wake up, playa..
