[Intro: Silkk the Shocker]
There's a lot of brothers out there claimin' to 'Bout it
And Soldiers, but they scared to kick reality

[Fiend]
Man, you been doin' all these movies and videos
You're really had a chance to show the world what's really happenin'

[Silkk the Shocker]
So what you want me to do?

Express yourself! ------] DJ Yella

[Verse 1: Silkk the Shocker]
I'm expressin' with my full capabilities
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm a soldier my behaviour is hereditary
And my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Master P, because he said we get bout it
And drop lyrics, to get them rowdy
Add it on a dope beat; and here it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? - I won't hesitate to diss one or two before I'm through
So don't try to sing this
Some drop science; while I'm droppin' english
Even if Tha Pound, makes the a-capella
I still express, yo, I don't gangbang or claim sess
But it divides the world apart
It's hard in the wealth, like Dr. Gales in New York
So stop trippin, cause you know we are equal "check your wealth"
And this is for my people
And uhh..

[Hook: Silkk the Shocker X2]
Express yourself!
Say what you wanna say, do what you feel
Go on and do it..
Be what you wanna be, get it how you will
Express yourself!

[Verse 2: Silkk the Shocker]
Now I'm back.. back to the streets
That's where I'm from, so that's where I be
Now, it's fact, to drop rap that's hard to swallow
Worth millions of dollars while real G's got to follow
Me, I throw the bands, twenties by the spin
Again and again and again, tryin' to avoid the pen
Just because I said some things people scared to say
And uhh.. a lot of DJs might just be scared to play
Now, I can be the coldest Emcee, but I can't win that Bout
Why? - cause I curse too much and uhh.. I came to from the south
But it's crazy, to see what people be
What society wants them to be
But not me, Rowdy, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill for the Hip-Hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and just start raps for the pop charts
Some musicians, they cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Hypocrites say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin' for the "Dopeman" ---] Eazy-E
Or they ban my group from the Radio
Hear some for NO Limit and they be like.. "Hell no!"
But what elses, you know, they all about law
As long as you keep it real and ..

[Hook: Silkk the Shocker X2]
Express yourself!
Say what you wanna say, do what you feel
Go on and do it..
Be what you wanna be, get it how you will
Express yourself!

[Silkk the Shocker]
That from the heart
Cause if you wanna start, to move up the chart
Expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin' like a tortoise, that full of Rigor Mortis
I got a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, that shoot like a .44
Or a lesson - all of them expression
And if you start flexin, I got a Smith and Wessun for you

[Break: Silkk the Shocker]
You this is dedicated to the realist group I know N.W.A
Fiend drop that

[Fiend]
Now, look I express myself, the best I know how
Like runnin' with the poor niggas towards to move the crowd "Soldiers" ---] Master P
You gotta clear my show?
I'm from the project to house on the hill
Stay real cause the game starts changin' cause I made meals
My Company, it means sky is the limit
My parnter say one day, I'mma buy the building
How could you imagine the rhythem, now picture me rollin'
Have all these rappin' and Donuts move this acrobat to sellin'
Sure, the world is yours, anything you want you can get it
Just put your mind into, and be about your business
But you don't know, what the purpose I have
This ideas is kept unto yourself
Man, follow your dreams, could you express yourself?

[Hook: X2]
Express yourself!, go on and do it..
Express yourself!, awww do it..

[Outro: Silkk the Shocker]
Yeah, this goes out to N.W.A. - y'all just expressed yourselves
And We expressed our selves
To all tuners that makin' wild, y'all keep your head up, sky is the limit
I want say what's up, Andi Shack, (*Names*) No Limit
Ant Banks, Craig D, all the homies locked down, express yourself
East to West
Now, I don't hear no Rapper talkin' about, he did it for love
So while you're doin' it for love, we're gettin' it for money y'all
Silkk the Shocker, I'm out
