[Verse 1: Trademark]
Back up in the building yes it's mingo my lingo
Trying to line my pockets with hundreds ain't got room for no singles
I spent the profit with my partners now we all holding C notes
Just trying to stretch my money long can't come up short like a veto
Hit the streets and we mingle with bad bitches delicious
So whip mine looking vicious
Smoking on potent so sticky
My eyes low I'm still with em
Handling the wheel with precision
I never slip on my mission
You know where vee [?] might have business
I came to get it no slacking
Keep it a hundred, they average
I'm authentic, they acting
I keep it real with my faction
Oh no, ho, we don't do whackness
Keep it G, yes, indeed
Stay on point with this rap shit
Til I'm dumped in a casket
You hear me?

[Chorus]
Straight up, my nigga
You know just how it go down
I be posted up, just roasted up
Already smoked like 4 pounds
I just came to get this paper, right
My nigga, you know now
I stay up on my grind, I'm getting mine
It's bout to go down

[Verse 2: Fiend]
Ruthless, criminal element, already labeled
Money spread, raws and elements, weed on the table
That's how I start it off, prefix
Them pizza pies was deep dish
Made success off my street sense
Iron gang, couple of M's, design chains
Y'all don't lick Pontchartrain, the watch and some rings
Flip phones on the get homes [?]
Move QP's for yeezees
VVS is Couchon
But you could get the ZZ's
Sleepy bear, so high
Ducking but ain't no needle here
Mustang and roarers
But nothing cleaner than this Regal here
Fiend, vigilant, calm
We need you to bring your lawn
Top strings keeping their bong
Down on my arm
You see where we are?

[Chorus]
