[Verse 1]
Here we go again
I'm in it to win
With nothing to lose, how I'm counting my M's
Chilling, puffing a roll behind the tint of my car
You would think I was a star how bitches try to jump in
[?]
Max beats bumping
Pockets full of Benjamins
This jet set radio, bosses no middle man
[?]
How we gangsters yet gentlemen
At the same time spit rhymes, ill lyricists
[?]
Sticking to the script, it's money over bitches
Kid niggas out [?] like they all know what the business is
[?] stay on top of his game [?]
No time for that mane, I'm on my go-getter shit
[?] THC got me feeling limitless
And I won't stop until my dividends [?]

[Chorus]
Running red lights on the road to the riches
Tell the west side I'ma come back with it
I don't need much, got a [?] and a vision of a picture worth a thousand [?] worth millions
Running red lights on the road to the riches
Tell the west side I'ma come back with it
I don't need much, got a [?] and a vision of a picture worth a thousand [?] worth millions

[Verse 2]
This full speed how I live
[?]
I only got a weapon for protection
They told me never say never, but I've never felt better
Never mix business with pleasure
If I'm in a boot you know shit can get messy
Bloody, getting all reckless
Here's another check so you can get your death wish
Even if I take an L, I never lose leverage
Coming from a spot where ain't no [?] but they [?]
Yeah, and meanwhile I'm trying to hold it all together
I'm no amateur
Already they calling me a professional
Young Ro, big dough [?]
The industry might [?]
Watch how I slow it down
Since I'm [?], don't try to pull me down
As I take another toke and I glide like fly
[?]

[Chorus]
Running red lights on the road to the riches
Tell the west side I'ma come back with it
I don't need much, got a [?] and a vision of a picture worth a thousand [?] worth millions
Running red lights on the road to the riches
Tell the west side I'ma come back with it
I don't need much, got a [?] and a vision of a picture worth a thousand [?] worth millions

[Verse 3]
I'm floating, hired up like a job at helium
How do girls do it with no hands but be feeling them
Sleepy Jones, tease
This some strong weed
Dope, some marinara sauce she just want cheese
26 [?]
We be on [?]
Black cars, start [?]
Couple of Benzes, I make plenty
Fuck with my friends
Lighting up, [?]
My bag stay packed, [?]
Free your mind, let nothing control you
Same swagger, just abracadabra
