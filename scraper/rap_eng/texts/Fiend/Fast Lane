[Verse 1: Fiend]
I lost my father 5 years ago
Right there Uptown, New Orleans
Hurt like it happened yesterday
Still make mistakes and call him
I still see him in the mirror
When I’m dressin’ your grandson
Still hear you saying “son be a man ‘cause a great woman gon’ demand one”
Why do they take him so fast
It’s like a [?] should have
Pops said this magic you have, mad
You can go right to sleep broke and you wake up with cash
They gon’ hate you and bash
Say that you crazy and laugh
Just don’t forget that you bad
Even worse of the days have passed
Mia told me let the haters keep scratching they ass

[Chorus: Fiend]
Nothin’ but the money get me out my bed
A little gun bump will never get me mad
Nothin’ but the money get me out my bed
A little gun bump will never get me mad

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
Seen Fiend with his dad made me wish I had that
Got my own son, give him everything I never had
Shit, I ain’t gon’ lie Fiend’s pops was the coolest
And then Momma Jones drove me to school
And after Katrina made the studio my home
Blowing zone after zone doing song after song
In crack alley, pops used to have you the maddest
In the front playing Madden, Pittsburgh was his team
Easy wider roll the green, and that was your roadie
You already know you [?] always big bro
Seen potential that I had and in me I ain’t even know
Now I’m on the road going show after show
And he resting in paradise chillin’ with some players
Always in our prayers, thinking bout him twistin’ flavors
A nice cold brew of his favorite [?] flavor
Took him too soon man heaven could’ve waited

[Chorus: Fiend]
Nothin’ but the money get me out my bed
A little gun bump will never get me mad
Nothin’ but the money get me out my bed
A little gun bump will never get me mad
