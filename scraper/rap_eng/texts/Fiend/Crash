Verse:

Please leave my lights off I just want be alone
I don’t get why you feel the need to make feel so low
Demons surrounding the side of my bed
I said its possible that im going to see this lifes end
Thinking of stopping, but I should just pop more meds
Invested my savings into em, why would I waste it
Taking one then two then three then four
Dammit man this addiction is making me get more
How do I cope with it, do I slit wrists, or
Do I keep popping the pills, like it’s a prescription war
Sooner or later, these words will be my last
Taking the route of rock, die young, live fast
Im starting to become numb, I can't grasp
That my life came to a final crash
