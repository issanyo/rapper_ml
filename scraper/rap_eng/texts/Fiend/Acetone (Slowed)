[Verse: ¥ûñg Âčêtøñê]

Yesterday I was feeling kinda sad
So I sat in my room with a paper bag
Filled it with a can of spray paint and it coated the inside
Huffed that shit for 30 seconds, now I got them bloodshot eyes
Smoking meth out a bong, constantly doing wrong
Sniff 7 lines of coke off a bitch’s dirty thong
IV the heroin in the veins on my legs
Anything at all to stop me feeling so depressed
Mixing uppers and downers hoping that I die
Anything to end this misery I call my fucking life
Slit my wrists and I taste the fucking crimson blood
But bitch, it ain’t as red as the Hi-Tec sitting in my cup
Popping tramadol with valium and xanax with oxy
If you ain’t talking drugs or cash then you already lost me
Sniff a grain of fentanyl same size as grain of rice
Why fentanyl? Twice the drug, the same fucking price
Chewing scripts up like I’m chewing fucking gum
Overdose to death, that’s my fucking option one
Jump out my window and fall to my death, that’s option two
Option three be a tree, a length of rope, nothing new
