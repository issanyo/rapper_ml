[Intro: Fiend]

International.... Jones

I hope
Life has given you
Every bit of the Sweetest Hangover

[Verse 1: Fiend]

In the hood we all are targets
Some days I wish I had me a magic carpet
A get away from your workplace
But it don't permit you
Bills piling up whenever stress is the issue
Cool out, relax
Sit back, rough day
That beauty hit me
I got me These brownies I just made
Moët Chandon, Louie XL, I'm strong
Pick up a lighter put down that fifth, take a bong
Get you a passport smoke some Thai weed in Milan
And meet you a bad bitch, get disapproved by her moms
Live once
Big joints
Jet plane, iron gang, don't ask me who spike the punch

[Hook: Al Beauti]

I just wanna float and never come down
I just wanna float and never come down
I just wanna float, float and never come down

Tell me when you smoke, do you smoke out of the pound

[Verse 2: Fiend]

And all my Facebook girls telling me, bon voyage baby
Voice soothing like a spa and a massage lady
Horn section alone, should make you go hit the bong
Vocals by Mr. Jones
But were benders and brooms
Private parties in homes
Exotic strands in clone
With shorty up in the palms
You god dammit we on
Bright green lights
And even bigger budgets
Landed, eyes﻿ white as egg shells, pick your nigga uuuuuppp

[Hook: Al Beauti ]

I just wanna float and never come down
I just wanna float and never come down
I just wanna float, float and never come down

Tell me when you smoke, do you smoke outta the pound
