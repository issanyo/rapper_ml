[Hook: S God]
Just popped me a hunned xans
Roll me up a hunned grams
Thumbin' through a hunned bands
I might need a hunned hands
Sprite in my cup, pour it up by the liter
Smoke a hunned blunts coolin' with the Grim Reaper
Just popped me a hunned xans
Roll me up a hunned grams
Thumbin' through a hunned bands
I might need a hunned hands
Sprite in my cup, pour it up by the liter
Smoke a hunned blunts coolin' with the Grim Reaper

[Verse: S God]
100 band bankroll, so gone off that dank bro
They be mad 'cause I ghost, that's just how this thing go
High as a bitch and I stay in the sky
They hatin' on me, I never know why
Don't look in my face and then tell me them lies
All of you snakes, I see through the disguise
You think that you slick, I'm not convinced
I see through your front, I know you a bitch
Only the day ones behind me, my girl right beside me
Ain't no one on Earth, that ever could stop me
I run up these shows and I fuck up a check
Iced out my name then put that on my neck
Pour up a four, I'm sippin' on tec
Your bitch on my stage, wanna lick up my sweat

[Hook: S God]
Just popped me a hunned xans
Roll me up a hunned grams
Thumbin' through a hunned bands
I might need a hunned hands
Sprite in my cup, pour it up by the liter
Smoke a hunned blunts coolin' with the Grim Reaper
Just popped me a hunned xans
Roll me up a hunned grams
Thumbin' through a hunned bands
I might need a hunned hands
Sprite in my cup, pour it up by the liter
Smoke a hunned blunts coolin' with the Grim Reaper

[Outro: S God]
100 band bankroll, so gone off that dank bro
They be mad 'cause I ghost, that's just how this thing go
