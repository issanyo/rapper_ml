[Intro, Corner Boy P, Fiend]
I'mma just peel through the hundreds on this one
Yeah
This just how it been
I've been pimping for so long
The Art of Finessin'
Shit

[Verse 1, Corner Boy P]
Never let these niggas test me
Never let a bitch with good pussy stress me
Shit I hijack that money train like I'm Wesley
Hit that dope with that [?] nigga Mannie Freshley
Yeah I throw that E up for my niggas we are
You know I keep that A1 bumping out the speaker
Bitches know I gets fresh every day is Easter
Yeah a nigga been nice since I had the ceasar
Kick my feet up
Wrap circles around these squares
Try and keep up
Behold these Rafs not your average Adidas
All them cars two seaters
Lean in the liter
Stuffing coke in her bra, now the bitch a D cup
I've been grinding for it , fuck opinions what you think of
Tryna fill a Brinks truck
Bitches tryna link up
I just iced the ring up
Look like I ball for Cleveland
Treat em all the same
Fuck 'em good then we leave 'em

[Chorus, Fiend]
This just how it been
I've been pimping for so long (ay)
You see me when I'm rolling I be rolling like
Few whips, Big spliff a different hoe tonight
(Lets go)
This just how it been
I've been pimping for so long
You see me,  see me
I be rolling like
A few whips, big spliff a different hoe tonight
Mmmm-mmm-mmm
Repeat after me
Mmmm-mmm-mmm
Repeat after me
Mmmm-mmm-mmm
Ay, yeah
Mmmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 2, Corner P Boy]
Never compromise my fresh
Never let them see you sweat
Played that hand I was dealt, could even cut the deck
Had a line around the corner, ain't bag it yet
Yeah I do this for my niggas, do it for the set (Jet)
For all them days we was stressed smoking on that stress
Blaze a 50 to the face then I plot next
And we all had plans some made progress
Just some small steps
Get some money buy the land
Build a house next
Some niggas ain't meant to be plugs, be an outlet
I was told to get what you can, and get up out that
I showed up late to the club, you see this outfit?


[Chorus, Fiend]
This just how it been
I've been pimping for so long (ay)
You see me when I'm rolling I be rolling like
Few whips, big spliff, a different hoe tomight
This just how it been
I've been pimping for so long
You see me, see me
I be rolling like
Few whips, big spliff, a different hoe tonight
Mmmm-mmm-mmm
Repeat after me
Mmmm-mmm-mmm
Repeat after me
Mmmm-mmm-mmm
Ay, yeah
Mmmm-mmm-mmm
