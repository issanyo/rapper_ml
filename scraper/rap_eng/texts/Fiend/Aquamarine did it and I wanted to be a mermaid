Baby I just wanna die, roll wit me and let's get high, pop a couple pills and vibe, fuck to Peep inside my ride, baby I just wanna die, roll wit me and let's get high, we can drop some sionide, we ain't gonna wake up tonight...

Baby I just wanna die, roll wit me and let's get high, I do not see a point in life, till I'm with you and shit feel right, I've been depressed you've seen me cry, I've got you wet you've seen me dry, we both regret we both still try, but fuck the rest I know you're mine, fuck... x2
