[Hook: FKA ANNE]

Preppin' for my dusty vision
Take me to another dimension
Breathing taking underground
Come closer, let's hang around
Let's hang around
Let's hang around

[Verse 1: YUNG GRIEF]

Envisioning hatred the hexed and regretted
No remorse in his  eyes, his limbs petrified
Blood leaking from my old scars
Mi$t God in the flesh and bones, yuh

Hoe please just go! (bitchgo!!)
Was never a blank role (rollsumdo)
Dank as the stank bro (broccoli?!?)
Drippin' in a tank blood (drip trip)
Leakin' my sack on a ho (on 'er face)

Air flow's heavy, I'm on duty and life stinks
Riding the Nex, hoes know me as the best
Lil Baphomet no regret
Hexed till I die, grey shawty flippin' wise
Coppas on da' fly, tryina catch me high
Lil Woeful Kin from the south
Makin' them bitches wet when they eyes dry

[Hook: FKA ANNE]


[Verse 2: YUNG $LITWRI$T]

I'm in a field living large
Just a fiend bustin' marge
Rap like cloud, fuck like raw, sippin' maw
Feelin' down while ignitin' pine
So blue at dawn, saw grey my shine
Never the one to speak never the one to click
But guess I flicked, just last a trip, bust with no grip
Hex Da Berry channeling for the Cherry, Grey thy Anti Matter
Gushing blood from our mourned father, motherfucker, ay

[Hook: FKA ANNE]


[Verse 3: HEX DA' GREY]

Yung Grief motherfucker, that's Hex Da Grey
Insert the coin don't toss it out
Come hang around
Lil Anne is down, we rollin' loud
Lil Loree's happy, I gave her lovin'
We all tripin n laughin'
Used to feel blue, now I'm rippin' 'em bars n rappin' in da' clouds, Emotional $hawty, O.G. mi$t wave

Come hang around with us
Don't let us as loose to topic
Loose noose in the attic
Temper like a hurricane
Volcanic not rabid
Pop the Glock to the flock then aim it to my head
I'm drastic! radical suicidal till the fucking head is blasted, ay
