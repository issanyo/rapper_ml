(Hook)
Show me your love
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna play it safe
Show me your love
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna play it safe

(Verse)
Please don't let nothin get in our way
I promise ima love you if that nigga gets erased
I'm high up off your vibe and now you got me in a daze
I want you by my side but you be scared you might get played
Ain't nobody love you just like I do
They gon turn to rivals
I will never fight you
You gon call your friends and they gon be there just to hype you
Tell em that you my boo
When you gon decide too

(Hook)
Show me your love
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna play it safe
Show me your love
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna play it safe

(Verse)
I don't wanna wait baby
Im wit these other girls and it don't feel the same baby
I wanna show you that I'm in a different lane baby
Cause all these niggas you know they gon talk the same baby
You know I won't ever tell you lies
But you just look at me and brush me to the side
But it won't phase me I won't let it hurt my pride
Cause I still love you through whatever you decide

(Hook)
Show me your love
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna play it safe
Show me your love
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna play it safe
