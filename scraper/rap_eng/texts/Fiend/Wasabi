[Verse 1]
Burnin all the remnants of ya clique
Posted in the whip
Cruisin yeah new bitch
Hieroglyphics i decipher it so quick
Fuck you up fo the clock gon tick
Ain't a motha fucka tellin me no shit
Cause im boutta blow shit
Up before my dome quit
1 finger whole clit
Fuck all that old shit
All the way Out here we just stole shit

[Verse 2]
I find it so fucking funny
These pussies runnin all up on me
Watch me do my thing then they be the one who is fuckin runnin
I ain't give a fuck bout these fuckboys wanna find me i be posted in my lair with my girl right beside me
Break ya neck while i eat my wasabi
Ain't a motha fuck boutta come and try me
You ain't bout shit dont lie G
All this clout shit? Its below me

[Chorus] x2
Posted up
With my boys we blowin up
Growin up
Always had just enough
Sometimes less
But now im up
Fill my chest
With double cups
I've lost my touch

[Outro]
I find it so fucking funny
These pussies runnin all up on me
Watch me do my thing then they be the one who is fuckin runnin
I ain't give a fuck bout these fuckboys wanna find me i be posted in my lair with my girl right beside me
Break ya neck while i eat my wasabi
Ain't a motha fuck boutta come and try me
You ain't bout shit dont lie G
All this clout shit? Its below me
