[Verse 1: Fiend]
At my highest frequency
In the A, you ought to visit me
Where they embrace culture, different ethnicity
We grew up a little different
So pardon my seriousness when I'm kidding
Business on  taking meetings on a tuxedo fitting
Everything before this was a scrimmage
I'm an automatic weapon when extended, they all timid
They step on kids, now they all get it (They all feel it)
