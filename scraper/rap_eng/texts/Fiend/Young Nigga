[Verse 1:Young Dolph]
I've been out here on my own ever since a young nigga
Always thought that I was grown even when I was a young nigga
Yeah I graduated but hell nah I didn't go to prom nigga
Nah I was in South Memphis tryna get off my bomb nigga
Yo bitch see me she get cuz money make her cum nigga
Put me in the mix I still stand out like a sore thumb nigga
I looked up to the dope boys and the gangsters ever since a young nigga
Before I was a 12 I smoked a blunt and shot a gun nigga
Had a million dollar dream
My lawyer to my team
[?] everything around me, cream
God first, family second, bitches last
I don't give a fuck about it if it don't add to my cash

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I've been getting it how I live ever since a young nigga
I've been out here hustling hard ever since a young nigga
I've been out here smoking and drinking ever since a young nigga
Ever since a young nigga (x2)
I've been taking care of my business ever since a young nigga
I've been holding on my nuts ever since a young nigga
Doing whatever the fuck I want ever since a young nigga
Ever since a young nigga (x2)

[Verse 2: Fiend]
