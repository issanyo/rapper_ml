Secure the clips in the chopper, cock the firing pin
Grit your teeth, hold your nuts and let the war begin
Squeeze the trigger, buck em all, somebody gots to fall

You better kill me, do me in, boy put me to rest

Dumpin shots like Little Rock, I'm your thug nigga

On my fist you stretch, should have been bout that bout mess

[Mac]
You bout that mess nigga, then represent to the fullest
Put my name on that bullet and pull it
Who wanna ride with me, die with me, Mr. Camoflauge
Me and my niggas we trigger niggas, we do or die

Infiltrate us, we chases so many papers today
Take us to pergutory, we glory but don't ignore me

Raised in the Bay to be a motherfuckin night crawler
Shot caller, hoes holla, see me in the Impala
Top dollar, spinich, ass ballin like there's no tomorrow
Hollar out the window, uh oh, ohhhh
Cause when you see me, uh oh, ohhhh
Let the shots go, niggas hit the floor
Cause I'm bout that mess, you niggas already know
