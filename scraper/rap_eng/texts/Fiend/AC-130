They try to take me down
They try to take me out
They been shooting shots real loud
Way up from above the clouds
Rain down, AC-130
Let it Rain, AC-130
Let it pour
I feel the pain, I feel the pain
But want some more, but want some more

AC-130, Ugh
They been playing dirty, Ugh
They think they can phase me but
I can go for days and some
It tastes sweet like raisin rum
How success was made to come
I done made a bet and won
I stay in my lane and run, run, run it

Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Thirty, Thirty, ugh

Fifty cal won't hurt me bruh
Desert Eagle to the mug
But you don't got rounds strong enough
Imma keep on climbing up
Only place to hide is up
You can keep on rising to
But im two steps behind you bruh

Bullet proof is the only way
To survive is the only way
Fuck your pride it gets in the way
Celebrate that your alive and get to fight today
Lets fight

They try to take me down
They try to take me out
They been shooting shots real loud
Way up from above the clouds
Rain down, AC-130
Let it Rain, AC-130
Let it pour
I feel the pain, I feel the pain
But want some more, but want some more

AC-130, Birdie
In the sky target locked, BOOM
All I need is one shot, Pew
If you on the list you get got, You
Is out of planet, Out of space
I might have to conquer, Outer space
Intergalactic, Ill inhabit
Some place that doesn't have any rain

Let the shots rain down
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
Let the shots rain down, AC-130
AC-130
Yeah
