Coffee House feat Fiend

Bridge (Devious)

Is it Latte or coffee
Machiatto or iced tea
Just pour it up in my cup for me
Freshly brewed is the wave and the mood B

Verse One (Devious)

Push the button on the whip to start up
All I need is sunshine and Starbucks
Sadday mornings windows down to feel the breeze
Switching lanes on my way to Magazine
Cop a caramel drizzle, have a seat
Surf the internet a while, then I'll leave
My ambition stimulated feeling free
Now a Cuban cigar is all I need
Then I saw her out the corner of my eye
Call her mocha she was ebony and fly
Could hear the beauty in her voice passing by
She caught me looking and politely told me hi
At the coffee house

Chorus (Fiend)

It's that wake up wake up wake up won't you wake up
I hope your morning be good as a cup of coffee
(wake up wake up wake up)
That's what she said softly
She told me wake up wake up wake up baby  wake up
I hope your morning be good as a cup of coffee
(wake up wake up wake up)
That's what she said softly

Verse Two (Fiend)

Morning espresso, help me shine like my bezel
Staying focused, keep both of my pockets without the echoes
Bow ties, sport jackets, and retro
Yo, toasted croissant I'm in effect mode
Drive through a dine-in, it all depends on the shedual
Sometimes I get good vibes when I  ride so I  let it flow
Up before the roosters and hens let me begin
Cool as dewdrops on leaves from oil vapin
Meetings and emails go together like large bodies
Of water and seashells
And women let tea spill
My name Jones and everything we could talk about
But not on social media fam, meet me at the coffee house

Chorus (Fiend)

It's  that wake up wake up wake up won't you wake up
I hope your morning be good as a cup of coffee
(wake up wake up wake up)
That's what she said softly
She told me wake up wake up wake up baby  wake up
I hope your morning be good as a cup of coffee
(wake up wake up wake up)
That's what she said softly

Bridge (Devious)

Is it Latte or coffee
Machiatto or iced tea
Just pour it up in my cup for me
Freshly brewed is the wave and the mood B
