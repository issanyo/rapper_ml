(Chorus-Fiend)
If I had a choice, I would choose to live as long as you
Roll with ??? you, that's my word
If I had a choice, I would choose to live as long as you
Roll with ??? you, that's my word

(Fiend)
I yet have'nt learned enough words to explain
Can't figure what it is star, please listen to my heart
I ain't never been dedicated to nothin other than blunt snuffin
Your women cuttin and pistol bustin, we all grow
Ask my cousin whether his stubborn ass responded
He doesn't, it ain't a lie, we all came from nothin
But that ain't a reason to love Fiend no lesser
And this ain't for the pity, whatever
For the ones that lick it together
Look, I really ain't gon' be here, drinkin and smokin
Maybe not see clear
But dog I sobered up
Still survive a Fiend, gone, soldier what
Ain't nothin changed ask Tre, still feel with those ???
Numb, can't feel whether it's cold or what
Kept a not-not, but what a time, look, it rolled me up
Don't wanna hold ya up, keep ya knees so covered
And I'm a tell her everyday her uncle love her

(Chorus)

(David Banner)
Lord I'm sorry I didn't pray last night, I was tired
Runnin through the porch tryna' get on the Red Eye
Lately I ain't prayed for a minute, man I'm fallin
These demons they got cell phones and lately they been callin
And lately I been listenin
Lord, does it really matter if I'm Muslim or Christian
Juan's case he didn't win, is he out, or in
Sometimes I wish he wasn't born in this world of sin
Bless his soul, but now my soul is on wait
Lord I'm askin, now I'm beggin, please don't close the gate
Lord I'm comin, I'm tired but my soul keeps runnin
I told him you were comin but my people did nothin
Little Justin, tell 'em I love him, I didn't rub him or hug him
And tell him don't start thuggin like his big brother Lavell
Ain't no price in this world for your soul to sell
It's gettin warm around here, am I in Heaven or Hell

(Chorus-to fade)
