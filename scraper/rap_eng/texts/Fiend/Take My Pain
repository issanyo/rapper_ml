[Hook: Master P]
Feel my pain, feel my pain
This ghetto got me goin through some thangs
God feel my pain. (x4)

[Fiend talking]
There comes a time, where uhhh, you have things of yourself, when you
Lose someone, how you gonna take that feelin away? I got Sons of Funk
An me Fiend, an my people, Master P an Silkk
They ready to tell you how I feel, trapped, everyday life

[Fiend]
Everytime I open my eyes, I thank God for wakin this soldier
Cuz in this cruel world its hard to walk these streets bein sober
It hurts, tryin to get over all the weight on my shoulders
Mom used to be babysitters buyin boulders
It's all on me to really accept that I lost my brother
An to be strong an just to go on since we shared the same mother
Pillows an covers can't smother the pain that I have
Sometimes I feel like I lost my better half, so sad
But that's the way of the ghetto
See yo life is already made, it's an accomplishment to pass "A" grade
See they hate my city, givin us the pushers an tramps for our highs
Sellin they book of food stamps at night
I light the porch lamp, until my lil cousin came in
Cuz I can't afford to lose another gender life
But livin this bend you could lose it if it came today
It rained away, you be wonderin how to take the pain away

[Chorus-Sons of Funk]
Tell me what we gonna do? The world ain't the same man
The way we live is a shame, I can't hide this pain. (x2)

[Hook x4]

[Master P]
UGHHH! Lord the world ain't the same, from the cradel to the grave
Dear mama keep yo head up I'm tryin ta get paid
These ghetto tears got me out there wantin to scream
My auntie 35, but bumpin 17 off a dope fiend
I live my whole life to stack some chips
An it's a shame when yo own homie, sank yo ship
An mama cryin......cuz church's be packed
An all yo family an friends dressed in black
An it's a shame, to see homies leave this earth
Some say ball, til you fall, now it's ashes an dirt
Sometimes, I feel like I'm trapped between heaven an hell
In the ghetto's purgatory, wit fiends an crack sales

[Chorus x2]
[Hook x4]

[Silkk The Shocker]
You might catch me, walkin wit my head down
In the pourin rain
Tryin to find answers to questions, no one can seem to explain
I coulda been born son of a king
Instead I was born son of a, killa, surrounded by dealaz an fiends
Dear God I got some questions, that maybe you can answer
Why my brother got shot, an my grandmother died of cancer
Now through it all I tried to ball an keep it real
They say they don't feel what I feel
I guess cuz they don't live where I live
See my mom tried to be strong, my brother died
Didn't wanna see her cry
But I seen her through the face of the mirror
Wipin tears from her eyes
An my next door neighbor committed suicide, was it cuz of stress
An if it was, was it that bad that he had to choose death?

[Chorus x2]
[Hook x4]

[Outro: Fiend]
Sittin here tryin to take the pain away, see this one here
This for all my ghetto fiends out there
Fightin these street wars, to all my No Limit soldiers
To everybody in the penitentary, I feel yo pain
This ain't nuthin like bein free, tryin to take the pain away
Rest in peace
Kevin Bailey, Kevin Miller. Tryin to take the pain away, Fiend
