[INTRO]
DIE JUST LIKE A ROCKSTAR 5x

[HOOK]
When I die
Die just like a Rockstar
Gucci Ghost, Fear of God
When I pop up
OK we can't wife the thots
Can't knot up
OK Count this Guap
Count all this Guap up
I don't know how to feel
Don't know what to think
Don't know where to go
Don't know I don't know
I don't...
Got me losing my patience
Like I've been losing my patients
Steady numbing the pain

[VERSE]
Yeah, we steady numbing the pain
Bad brain so I'm fucked up wit it
Rockstar nigga
Imma sign her whole tiddy
Stuck up in my ways
All the days I can't forget
And they say it's money over people
People over money
Ain't no fucking wonder
That our gods just left us
Yeah they left us
So If I finna die
Bitch I'm leaving like a Rockstar

[HOOK]
When I die
Die just like a Rockstar
Gucci Ghost, Fear of God
When I pop up
OK we can't wife the thots
Can't knot up
OK Count this Guap
Count all this Guap up
I don't know how to feel
Don't know what to think
Don't know where to go
Don't know I don't know
I don't...
Got me losing my patience
Like I've been losing my patients
Steady numbing the pain
