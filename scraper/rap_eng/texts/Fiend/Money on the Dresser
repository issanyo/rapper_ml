Chorus)
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser

(Verse 1:Wais P)
Yeah
I'm riding around, I'm pimpin up
My hoes down, never go around
You could ride the bitch
Make the pussy rich
She strayed away,she's gonna pay the pimp
Not half of it, baby every cent
Every dollar, until your pockets spent
You can holla until your left with lent
On my collar, all my diamonds spin
You like the look I write the book
I make the rules, you make the moves
I won't play the fool,I'll play the king
I'm built to win and my pinky ring
Get's eyes so much if bitch you just look at me
And say , Yey, he's a champion
He's a winner, he's a sinner
Money tall like a center
You mad cause I ball
And your pockets look thinner
Fuck the dog bitch beware
Of a pimp when you enter
Some of you cats seem confused,cause you dinner
Let me help you out, you a bitch for real
When the feds come , you snitch for real
I'm a real live pimp, I'm already rich
I'm independent,I set the deal
I self lord, C E O my nigga
Can't impress me with your little six figures
I need 8 laying on the side,that be the sign
That my money is infinite
Ya get it, you niggas too slow
Just came from Texas , knocked two hoes
Each hoes invest Copped two ghosts
Twin rolls we got penthouse goals
Champagne thoughts playboy Porche
Wais P logo, on the pool and the porch ,GO

(Chorus)
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser

(Verse 2:Fiend)
I'm on that weed that be so good
That make you doze off
Mixed with the vics and percs
Now make her take her clothes off
She lucky she found pimpin cause she know
Cause her toes crossed
Follows directions well
But baby girls so lost
Them cookies bought me four trucks
Two houses and more bucks
Like bread crumbs in the pond
Just bringing more ducks
Audi 8 chasing her mouth alone is relations
I'm calculating impatient
The product is amazing
Five grand a week she hand me
If I could bottle up this candy
You were given a million dollar then
Maybe you'd understand me
Gotta golden goose, I drove the coupe
Ride it to that porche up the four door
Power of the pussy, get seven deep
Record this life in slow-mo
Luther in my trunk
Round these parts, you smell that skunk
LV on them trunks
Long trips, because we won't
I still push a caddy with trues and vogues on it
Without a gun and bullets
Take the block and put holes on it

(Chorus)
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
Money on the money on the money on the dresser
