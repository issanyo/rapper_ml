[Playa Fly sample]
Tanqueray, Grand Marnier, watch me roll a blunt of hay
Dip it in Courvoisier and chief it in you bustas face

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
A wiff of that funk, a hit of that skunk
Pop me a bar, take a sip of that vodka
I forever get high, forever get high
Forever get high, forever get high

[Verse 1: Fiend]

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]

Gettin' high on that pussy a white pussy even though a nigga ain't even tryin' to hit that
Y'all niggas better quit that talkin' shit about Da Mafia 6ix
Y'all know we mob, y'all know we wit' it, (?) tickets
Click it, get the Glocks ready, jump in the Chevy, don't even know where I'm headin'

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
A wiff of that funk, a hit of that skunk
Pop me a bar, take a sip of that vodka
I forever get high, forever get high
Forever get high, forever get high

[Playa Fly sample]
Tanqueray, Grand Marnier, watch me roll a blunt of hay
Dip it in Courvoisier and chief it in you bustas face

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
I'm so high, all I smell like is smoke

I love to smoke weed, I need about three
Pass that Swisher Sweet
Roll it up, fire up that weedy
Feelin' like Ricky
"Where is da bud, where is da bud?"

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
Mr. (?) kush (?) that (?), swisher, (?), get high, fucked up
Inhale all that dope in  out a cloud of smoke
Like Scarecrow, me get tight up in the eyes
You get high
Don't be a fool, you get stuck off in the room
(?) fuckin' (?) watchin'  satanic cartoons
Crunchy got that syrup (?) in every city
...
DJ Paul - doggin' all these bitches!
Crunchy Black - doggin' all these bitches!
