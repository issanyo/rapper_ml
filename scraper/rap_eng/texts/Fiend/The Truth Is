Man come on girl, you know we tryin to do something
You gonna get it on before I train set' here?
(Hey hey Fiend, c'mon man
They got some more over here.)

[Verse 1]
Now, what up shorty let a solider come rap a taste with ya
Lay the real on what possessed Sleepy to come and get ya
You've been chillin in the corner too cool and collective
And I'm tired of judgin you from the clubs perspective
You see I'm very selective of who I done and do
You don't know me, I'm fiend, I only fuck with a fewI
I'm trying to do something with you without the crowd of all
Lets escape in my ride to get this problem solved
Now I done dodged them all, just to feel your persona
Offer to break the ice with the finest marijuana
Lady call your mama and just ease your lil nana nana
Cause you ain't goin home, you done run up on the Jones

[Chorus]
Say look shorty the truth is I ain't tryin to be alone
You should tell all that from my tone
And if you bout twerkin something, and makin this man moan
Maybe you and I can get it on
Now I said look shorty the truth is I ain't tryin to be alone
You should tell all that from my tone
And if you bout twerkin something, and makin this man moan
Maybe you and I can get it on, get it on

[Verse 2]
You remember me, in my younger twenties and full of energy
You keep it on my mind, see I hear you killin me
This ain't braggin or boastin, they tryin to convincin
You done it to a brother with your Victoria's lotion
See I'm socially speakin, in search of a quite freaky girl
Give me one week and I'm a have your ass tweakin
Medications decreations, survive and put down a beating
Skip the movies, no eating and the mom and dad meeting
Get this and no I don't need no bitches
Just someone ain't tripping on the hugs and kisses
Drop your clothes at the door walk over here slow
Lets see how many hours you can go

[Chorus 2]
Say look shorty the truth is I ain't tryin to be alone
You should tell all that from my tone
And if you bout twerkin something, and makin this man moan
Maybe you and I can get it on
Now I said look shorty the truth is I ain't tryin to be alone
You should tell all that from my tone
And if you bout twerkin something, and makin this man moan
Maybe you and I can get it on, get it on
Now look, the truth is I ain't tryin to be alone
You should tell all that from my tone
And if you bout twerkin something, and makin this man moan
Maybe you and I can get it on
Now look look the truth is I ain't tryin to be alone
You should tell all that from my tone
And if you bout twerkin something, and makin this man moan
Maybe you and I can get it on

Get it on with me, now come home with me
Now girl what you tryin to do
Get it on with me without owning me
Now girl I'm choosing you
Get it on with me, now come home with me
Now girl what you tryin to do
Get it on with me without owning me
Now girl I'm choosing you
Get it on with me, now come home with me
Now girl what you tryin to do
Get it on with me without owning me
Now girl I'm choosing you
Get it on with me, now come home with me
Now girl what you tryin to do
Get it on with me without owning me
Now girl I'm choosing you
Get it on with me, now come home with me
Now girl what you tryin to do
Get it on with me without owning me
