[Chorus]
They say birth is a miracle
I'm thinking I don't wanna live no more
I might slit my wrist and just end it all
I'm so alone, there's no one to call
Death note what I left, they don't care at all
My mental so dark, there's blood on the walls
They don't accept me, they want me gone
Put the blade to my wrist, then remain unknown

[Verse 1]
No I can't run anymore
Blood shed from my wrist to the floor
I don't know where to go, they don't acknowledge me I feel like a ghost
So I don't let these people approach
Â 
[Chorus]
They say birth is a miracle
I'm thinking I don't wanna live no more
I might slit my wrist and just end it all
I'm so alone, there's no one to call
Death note what I left, they don't care at all
My mental so dark, there's blood on the walls
They don't accept me, they want me gone
Put the blade to my wrist, then remain unknown..
