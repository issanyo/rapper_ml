[verse:1 Fiend]

My name buzzin, Austin Bee hive
Im dippin in that old money like your grandpas ex three wives
Tuxedo ready but I move like Im in a pair of Levis
Bow ties, low-fi, oh my! Jones, so high, no lie
You should put that in a bong, instead I use some papers and I put that in a song
My grammer produce grams, to grand in that order
Before millions she was saying she never came harder
Guilty as this new Gucci Im spraying on
Dope dick ma', you gon' need something to weigh it on
You gon' have to raise the bar for me, quietly
You with royalty, Im with a botanist in the lap, go bring the jar for me
Jones, top of the game
Mr. Scoreboard, the job pay well I just encourage her to go for it

[Verse 2: Nesby Phips]

She told me that she love my cologne
And my response to her is, I ain't even got none on, Im ice cold
Perfer my music up high with the lights down low
Posted on a Verde Terrace with a nice brown ho
My life well, you might find mo' intriguing than the current lifestyle that youre leading
Shall I say, lacking? Really, I just speak from the gut
Shall I say, rapping? Blinded by the lights andthe camera
Someone say action. I wonder if Phips know he the shit?
Some one should ask him. Then surely after find out exactly how much he taxin'
They say, Is that a Mic in your pocket, or you just happy?
I said both, then pulled it out, and bust on a flow
I figured that since you asked, you really wanted to know
The only real way to prove your point, is to show
I got that ??? if youre looking for glow
(what is you talk'n 'bout?) Ooh nothin'.. Im just buzzin
