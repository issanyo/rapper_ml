[Hook: FKA ANNE]

All of this hate
Leading us to nothing
All of this fake
Making you something
Diving for illusion
We need a transfusion
It's my conclusion
My absolution


[Verse 1: YUNG $LITWRI$T]

Tamed by the beasts, hanged from a leash
While I sleep deep in the dungeon I'm in
Petals do slip in da' crypt where I creep, no need for a need
I just dip in a tint, I just smoke where I'm in
I just blow what i feel, never abandon mi$t it's the call
Rolling while swervin' the road
Marking my prey with they blood
Run in the night, oh so cold, hearts pumping faster
Give a fuck 'bout gold I ain't with the mold
This shit's getting old I'd rather be smoked doped out to rot
Plated in grey gold while my hoodies screaming loud fuck god, ay

[Hook: FKA ANNE]


[Verse 2: LIL' WOE]

Omi's clutch down to the floor
Tulips around like what's the drill
Out of this country that's where I live
In the ethereal plain where they blame these human names
I got a record, no photo, no prints, I'm in
Out of this world there's where I'm from
A planet so grey and cold, a beautiful place
Where flowers don't grow
Where animals don't
Where humans cannot
Humanity's loud in the heart of the proudest
Humanity's lost in the eye of thy prophet
