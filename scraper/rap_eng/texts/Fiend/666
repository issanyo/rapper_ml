[ Verse 1: S God ]
Triple 6 bitch
Antichrist in the flesh
Written in scripture, S God is the best
Kneel to the floor when I walk in your presence
'Cause I'm a God all you haters some peasents
Draped in a satin cape ghetto king blastin' K's
Surpassin' all of the one's that was laughin' hey
Now they nowhere I'm up
So fuck you, shut up
I'm the big dog, don't fuck with you pups
So fuck did think
So many withdrawls they know me at the bank
Homicide cases I'm catchin' 'em weekly
Can't fuck with y'all 'cause you sheep are too cheesy
Bitch I'm 'bout war I don't fuck with your treaty
Your girl rubbin' dick like she think it's a genie
Hoes can't resist they all know I'm too dreamy
Sippin' that sizzurp got me feelin' sleepy
Aye
The beast out the south
Please watch your mouth
You fuckboys is pussy boy I smell the fear
The end of your life approachin' it's near
The coast is not clear
Aye
Bitch I'm a fiend got the drugs on the beam
What the fuck do you mean bitch you know I'm 'bout C.R.E.A.M
Always got it on deck
God of the underworld, give me respect
S God got a dynasty
Aquired it violently
Won't go out silently
Got the throne rightfully
Dead any rivalry
They end up in rivers or forests just laying there quietly, lifelessly
Got drones of supporters as far as the eye can see
Bitch I'm that monster demonic in nature
Feast on the flesh of you fakers for flavour
I am the savior

[ Verse 2: S God ]
Everything I do is for the set, no sweat
I just kill all my rivals then I'm like who's next?
I don't play with you jokers 'cause you fuckers mediocre
See, your girl in my dm's and she wantin' me to stroke her
Got pils for the bitches
Grantin' drug wishes
See, my wrist game vicious
Catch me cookin' in the kitchen yeah
Bitch I've been that one
In my hometown gettin' rich as fuck
Then I pull up to your city, find a bitch to fuck
I work for my shit I don' pissed on luck
And I don't trust the world, keep a pistol tucked
You send shots? We launch missles, yup
Why they tryna tell me what I can and can't do?
Cross me bitch, and the mood is fuck you
I ain't switch up, I ain't actin' brand new
Talkin' disrespect then I backhand wooo
