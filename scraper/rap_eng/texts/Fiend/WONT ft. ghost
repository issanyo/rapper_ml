Fuck what you're saying yeah i'm taking shit back
Say you working hard but you cut yourself slack
Wondering if the things that you do they impact
But they don't
Wishing that you had the strength to do it but you won't
All you wanna do is lay around and stay stoned
Maybe take a nap or stay up scrolling on your phone
But take the time for second options
You have life and not the coffin
I've been smoking on this indo
And i keep on fucking coughing
Dropping bodies very often
Your skull is what i will soften

Not taking any chances
Money moves and i'm dancing
Not taking any chances
Money moves and i am dancing

336 yeah i come up on the spot
Like nah this ain't no gucci, it's the zumiez that just dropped
And fuck a cop
Unless they actually do their motherfucking job
Bitch said she was gon get even so i'm looking at her odd
(ghost)
Please just stop
Please don’t front
You a pussy if you run
I been running numbers up
You are just the runner up
You a bitch
I’m a savage
Put you down ya bones are crackin
It’s a fact that you are average
If you talking make it happen
If you see me
RUN
IF YOU HIDING WITH A FRONT
I CAN SEE AND YOURE DONE
IVE BEEN HUNTING FOR YOUR BLOOD
AND I CAN FIND IT LEMME LOOK
LEAVE YOU MANGLED IN THE DIRT
