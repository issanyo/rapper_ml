Rather than kill the dream, they killed the child
Stabbed him with a handshake and shot him with a smile
What was once hellish is now considered mild
Seekin refuge my whole life, still my devil running wild
Somebody lock him up won't you help me out one day?
As I pray for the rescue boat to come my way
Nobody answers back except that special flower
So niggas smoke each other followed by smoking on that sour
Not a coward, he was about that life foreal
But nobody appreciated him while he was here
Posthumously celebrated, only after he was gone
Did they raise him on a pedestal and put him on the throne
Why didn't you show him love when he was alive tell me why?
Why you gotta wait and pretend only after he died?
You negelcted him and mocked him knowing he would not survive
His death to you is none but extra money on the side
Goddamit, goddam you, and just to let you know
That I mean it, may God damn everything you stand for
All I feel is pure disgust when I look you in the eye
All I can see is the devil personified
Let's be honest this round, I really mean it  now
You probably won't respect me til I'm dead cold in the ground
Rigermotus plotting, couldn't be found nowhere
Suddenly you care now that my body stiff and rotten
Ok my composure is regained
No more holding on to things that cause me pain
Is what I tell myself, the most selfishest of things
While the tides rise, I'm busy washing off these stains
You wasn't no friend you foe, talkin about so and so
Still can afford a couple of fucks to give but I'm running low
You made me who I am and I made you it's bazaar
And that's what I mean when I say I am because we are


This for all my homies that lost they life
Never got a second chance to make things right
Every person that you know cannnot live twice
I just hope that I take my own advice
There's a blessing in every loss
There's a blessing in every loss
It's a hidden blessing in every loss
I'm guessing there's a blessing in every loss

At 16 I performed at my high school talent show night
I got a standing ovation so they cut off my mic
They couldn't handle the sight of a young refugee nigga
Reaching the masses without having to pull a trigger
It all boils down to the fact that they was scared
Even up to this day some of them wishing that I drop dead
And it's more than likely to happen, you heard what I said
Just make sure to plant a seed with every tear that you shed
Whoever digs a pit must fall in it
We attached at the hip so we all in it
That mean if one of us trips, we crawl in it
What feels like eternity is just a long minute
Confess to whom it may concern, it's not a act
When I was seven never thought I'd make it past eleven matter fact
20 years later my bread leavened, stating facts
Staring up at the heavens, I wonder are they staring back?

There's a blessing in every loss
There's a blessing in every loss
It's a hidden blessing in every loss
I'm guessing there's a blessing in every loss
This for all my homies that lost they life
Never got a second chance to make things right
Every person that you know cannnot live twice
I just hope that I take my own advice
There's a blessing in every loss
There's a blessing in every loss
It's a hidden blessing in every loss
I'm guessing there's a blessing in every loss
This for all my homies that lost they life
Never got a second chance to make things right
Every person that you know cannnot live twice
I just hope that I take my own advice


If Keizan and Shiyooiis, together made a movie
I'll probably be the bad guy getting shot up with a oozie
I wonder why the whole country hates my guts
Soon as I open my mouth they all wanna gang up
Better keep safe on that side, you can never tour here
You  don't know what we go through, you wasn't even born here
We know you pretend you care, We know you live like an amir
You should be shamed of yourself,  bet you can't even look in the mirror
Oh lord I, think back we used make them drive though orders
Not enough money for soda, stead I got a cup of water
My niggas pitch in, coins passing by my shoulder
Diggin for quarters to pay for a dolla menu order
Not much really changed, we only grew a little older
You doing much better now? well kinda sorta
I'm tryna be a better man incase I have a daughter
For the colder world is for the bolder, toe to toe is border murder
But sometimes it's worth it for the greater sacrifice
Or in the heat of the moment did the fire ignite?
And your field of dreams was set ablaze one night
The wind scattered the left over ashes, imagine the plight
And as the hope burns and its last breath escapes
Somehow it's reborn like wine from crushed grapes
As above so below, we are siblings with the stars
And that's what I mean when I say I am because we are


Immigrant packets, colorful tshirts, coats, and jackets
Scratch marks all on his skin like fucked up March Madness brackets
The heart of Quindaro, Wyandotte County
Where Jango Fett niggas hunt you down like a bounty
