Today's story's all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And if you gotta couple minutes, you can roll your blunt
And let me tell you about that time the hunter became the hunt
In Northeast Africa, born and raised
Stirring up trouble during most of the day
Until one day I heard my father say
Pack up your bags because we're going away
To a land so fruitfull you ain't gotta pay
All you gotta do is do as they say
They'll continue giving and giving give-aways
Til that empty bag goes from fill it to filet
So I ran and ran because I couldn't wait
A rack or two could be in my fate
Thinking if you bag that up it'll be great
If you bag that up it'll be great
What's even greater is reality
It's not what I thought it was about to be
Turns out we left our families
In hopes of climbing canopies
For dreams you can't reach and knowledge you can't teach
Religion you can't preach, it seems we crossed seas
To mischevious lands, issa disaster at hand
Please run as fast as you can
Lies are now truths that poison our youths
Stop talking crazy, assimilate, damn
I'm not crazy, I'm just proud of my roots
Nah, you just too proud for a helping hand
Much rather go home, but even there I feel alone
One minute they love you, the next minute they don't
In and out of my life, got me feeling like the Fresh Prince
How come they don't want me man?

I love my people, even if they don't love me I swear
I'd die for you, you don't wanna die for me that's fair
To the ones back home, I just want you to know I care
And life without you, is like living in a world with no air

I guess everybody ain't cut from the same cloth
Everybody ain't willing to pay the same cost
They don't wanna talk about what the fame does
Same loved ones don't you show the same love
Wishing they could put you back right where they found you
Like lifeless clay, they wanna mold you and pound you
I guess money don't really change you that much
Money really changes the people around you
Ayyy nigga
I know you lying when you hate nigga
You love me because everyday nigga
I'm saying what you scared to say nigga
I see you hiding behind the curtain there
All I had to do was follow the scent of your fear
Watch em transform
And linger on long
Like cologne on
The shirt you last worn
Still

I love my people, even if they don't love me I swear
I'd die for you, you don't wanna die for me that's fair
To the ones back home, I just want you to know I care
And life without you, is like living in a world with no air
