She told him meet me on the corner
You bet not be one minute late or Imma leave you lone huh
My daughter phone ain't on her
Some fuck boys pulled up on her, robbed her, smashed her on the head with a corona
Anyway, hurry up and meet me at the spot
After this I swear to God Im finished with this job
Couple of bills to pay, couple of toys for the kids to play
And I swear yo I'm finished with this job
Eyes squinted in the headlights of the car behind the building
Signed the contract without reading it, cameras began filming
As she unzipped, in her mind she was singing let it burn
Then she twerked it and worked and.. bunch of expletive terms
Moment she was waiting for, time to cut the check
She broke down hysterically, only 5 percent
She swore to end the cycle, now shes feeling kinda spiteful
All she asking for in life is to enough to fix the lightbulb
So her oldest can study and pass with good grades
Now even the youngest watching her come home late
Mental, physical, emotional pain
She made an appointment to meet him once again

Babies be watching, our babies are watching
Babies watching quietly
Babies be watching, our babies are watching
Babies eyes can see
Babies be watching, our babies are watching
Babies watching quietly
Babies be watching, our babies are watching
Babies eyes can see


He told her meet me on the corner
One minute late, consider yourself a gonner
Gotta pick up my son don't I?
He's seven years old but I treat him like a grown up
When I visit that is, when I'm litted that is
After I hitted that lick and done got at them bricks
First I finish my biz then I remember his
Then I finally make time to visit my kids
Goal is to make more money than I did last year
Talkin bout I did you wrong, bitch that was last year
Save your tears for later like that food in the fridge
Last thing you wanna do with me is burn that bridge
I climb buildings with ease, I'm King Kong on these streets
Such a dog, when I spray I'm deadin these fleas
Shoulda known better, sick dogs get put down
She put a hit on him, they pulled up on him and.. blao!

Babies be watching, our babies are watching
Babies watching quietly
Babies be watching, our babies are watching
Babies eyes can see
Babies be watching, our babies are watching
Babies watching quietly
Babies be watching, our babies are watching
Babies eyes can see

Our sons are watching
Sons are watching
Our daughters are watching
Daughters are watching
Our children are watching
Our babies are watching
