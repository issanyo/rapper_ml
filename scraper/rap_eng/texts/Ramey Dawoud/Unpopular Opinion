I wanna share
I wanna share
I no longer can keep
I no longer can keep quiet
Like it or not this is my
Unpopular opinion
Unpopular opinion
Unpopular opinion

I did it once and I'll do it again
I did it once and I'll do it again
God damn

I hate that you can never be sure
Break bread with em, before
You know it, the feds knocking down your door
Permanently scarred, live the rest of your life insecure
My mother told me be cautious of who you trust
My father said you gotta learn to adjust
Friendships fall apart, get covered with dust
Even the strongest metals eventually rust

I wanna confront the Imams and preachers
Harassing our daughters and sons, false teachers
Sucking our blood like leeches
I believe I have a good enough reason
To rearrange their facial features

I wanna share
I wanna share
I no longer can keep quiet
Like it or not this is my
Unpopular opinion
Unpopular opinion
Unpopular opinion

I did it once and I'll do it again
I did it once and I'll do it again
God damn

Fool me once but you can't fool me twice
I finally realized it, shame on me
Time to wisen up, put the blame on me
Even my own hand will snitch happily
One finger pointed at you, three at me
Did I mention
All of this negative attention
Got me on the edge like a flat Earth convention

I wish I could find the villains
The ones that flooded my village
Woulda been better if they just killed us
I'd drown them and not feel sorry
Watch them sink and throw a party

I wanna share
I wanna share
I no longer can keep quiet
Like it or not this is my
Unpopular opinion
Unpopular opinion
Unpopular opinion

Watch me step back and curve these niggas
Let my name expand like Kirby's figure
Count Dead Presidents like 90's Jigga
But I'm fast with atonement like Yom Kippur

I did it once and I'll do it again
I did it once and I'll do it again
God damn
