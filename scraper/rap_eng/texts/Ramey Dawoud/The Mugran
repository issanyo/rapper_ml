[Intro]
Yeah.. let me take you with me.. on this journey

[Verse 1]
The mugran, Tutti Island
To the west the tears of the peaceful giant move in silence
To the east the tears of the beast of the Ethiopian highlands
The lifeline of the land of the band that knew not violence
On the western border lived a people, if you never met before
Ah man, the kindness it overflows
Warriors in their own right, that's for sure
From the core, much love to the people of Darfur
Pay attention, do you know what that sound is?
Have you ever noticed that the ground is
Vibrating from feet stomping and beads bouncing
Feel the rumble of the Kirin in your soul, how astounding
The landscape of ancient wrestling masters
Grassy foothills, cool breezes, and green pastors
Take a sip from the youthful fountains
As we enter the legendary gates of the Nuba Mountains
Not far away lives a pious
Group of people spread across the land like wild fires
As the fish dove deepr and the bird flew higher
One only grew to admire the Blue Empire

[Chorus]x2
Where you from? I'm from where the watres meet
Where you from? I'm from where the waters meet
Where you from? I'm from where the waters meet
The land of gold is where I shall plant my seed

[Verse2]
The second leg of the journey will surely leave you inspired
I'm talking about people of mystery, in poems they're admired
You can not miss their attire
On camel back, curly afros, and of course swords are required
The air is buzzing with their presence for miles
Fuzzy Wuzzy through the hills of Kassala, the Red Sea, and higher
At the bend of the Nile, that's the land of honor
Indescribable amount of amaan, Ard AlButana
From this point follow the course of the water
And let it guide you and take you even farther
Into the land of priceless information
The nation that taught early nations how to be nations
Birthplace of civilization, our final destination
Our current situation does not define us
And the story hasn't ended
So next time someone asks you where you're from?
Tell them about the greatness from which you have descended

[Chorus]x2

[Verse 3]
To the south, we send you an olive branch and a dove
With the fragrance of bakhoor we send you nothing but love
So let's keep out spirits strong with an abundance of hope
And feed it the best balah, gongolez, nabak, and laloub
Much love to the young ones, much love to the old
To the kings in jalaabiyas, queens wrapped in the toub
If you're thankful for who you are raise your hand and say shukran
Maybe when this is all over we can meet at the mugran
