[Verse 1]
Land of the free, home of the brave
Land of the thieves, home of the slaves
Black man blood, black woman blood
The liquid of indigenous people veins flood
The fields and the valleys
The screams of spirits reincarnated as tornadoes in the alleys
Flowers bloom in a wounded womb
Instead of sucking our thumb, we're born with our fists raised in a rally
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Swinging in the southern breeze
Chains still on they feet
Rotting from the heat of a hundred million suns, unfathomable degrees
The stench of the flesh, dangling from the neck
Enough to water the eyes of an emotionless man in a sec
Yet some don't cry, we don't force a stop
We cried our eyes dry and ran out of tears to drop

[Chorus]
It hurts, all I see is black blood on the ground
Everywhere I go, black blood on the ground
Yeah, and I'm scared to turn around
All I'm gonna see is black blood on the ground

[Verse 2]
Not everything that glitters is gold
But you won't find out unless you reach for it, I was told
I'm holding on to my beliefs, from the cradle to the grave
Every Friday, read the Sura of The Cave
No amount of money in this world is worth it
You can keep the sunny beaches, where the view is perfect
I'll take the endless honey
Give me the gardens with rivers flowing beneath them
For that, I'll forever be a servant
Every hurting will come to pass
The serpents slither in every direction
As I unleash my wrath on em
Just watch my arm and hammer as I swing the axe on em
I sprayed them now they fragrance smell like they got Axe on em
I wanted peace but they refused it so I spazzed on em
My team come equipped with rockets, we bout to blast on em
And put them in they place
And maybe that's they grave
And maybe I'll get there first so baby just incase

[Chorus]
It hurts, all I see is black blood on the ground
Everywhere I go, black blood on the ground
Yeah, and I'm scared to turn around
All I'm gonna see is black blood on the ground

[Verse 3]
In my bedroom, writing this song at 3:45 in
The morning, zoning in and out, I'm driving
Myself insane, there's a man inside of my brain
Controlling everything, hungry, wanting to gain
Power and wealth through fame but I'm depriving
Him of reaching his full potential, barely keeping him alive and
Feeding him left overs just enough to keep hope alive
Inside my mind, gears grind, it's ok you can tell me
I'm the sole reason for my failure, no it won't offend me
I know that hand in hand, the Angels will befriend me
The stars and constellations will line up and defend me
And just as I'm reaching out my hand asking you to lend me
Cold stones for my heart, I'm stunned by the sudden courage that's within me
I'll never sacrifice my soul to gain the world, go ahead and end me

[Chorus]
It hurts, all I see is black blood on the ground
Everywhere I go, black blood on the ground
Yeah, and I'm scared to turn around
All I'm gonna see is black blood on the ground
