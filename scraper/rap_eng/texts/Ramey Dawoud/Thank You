[Verse 1]
It's how I start, not just to call it art
I don't work extra hard just to call it heart
It comes naturally, all on its own
Leaving folks saying "Mashallah how you have grown"
Well thank you for the help it is much appreciated
Why, double you helped like Your World was abbreviated
I woke up and saw you hiding behind the bush
Waiting for the right moment to attack and shove and push
I haven't even yawned and you're trying to get me to shush
Trying to shush Ramey is trying to shush Kingdom Kush
Quite frankly that is not an easy task
Despite how anxiously you wait to sew dimples in your mask
As I wipe my face I see under your mask
Breaking my overnight fast is my next task
In the Creator's name, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
Incredible, how all the edibles are plentiful
At a glance I'm cynical, notice how the city's full
I refuse to let you take her from pretty to pitiful
I'm cynical, notice how the city's full
I refuse to let you take her from pretty to pitiful

[Chorus]
As you extend your arm
Grab hold of my hand and pull me to the stop
I say thank you, to the top I say thank you
As you pull away your arm
Let go of my hand and smile as I drop
I say thank you, as I drop I say thank you

[Verse 2]
I feel stuck between a hard place and a rock
Like the soldiers were stuck in a hard place in Iraq
Facing an enemy that I ain't really never seen
He's wishing that his vision is invisible it seems
We are statistics like a juvenile delinquent
So sadistic in his mission with ridiculous precision
Insisting on leaving his mark imprinted in our vision
Realistically addicted and living to be persistent
The truth will soften a heart so hardened
I was shot by the sheriff, deputy, and off duty seargant
Not satisfied still, really wanna know what's real?
I lived the Fugee live and I've yet to meet Lauryn Hill

[Chorus]
As you extend your arm
Grab hold of my hand and pull me to the stop
I say thank you, to the top I say thank you
As you pull away your arm
Let go of my hand and smile as I drop
I say thank you, as I drop I say thank you

[Verse 3]
Child of the Nile Valley, product of the dark continent
Where ancient monuments fell victim to silly arguments
Rulers that are clueless have absolutely no conscience
Now making out alive is a big accomplishment
Oh, so now you begin to cheer
It's what you want to hear it's what keeps you living in fear
The dream of freedom held me hostage
Now everywhere I go dark clouds are constant
My only option is to be sincere
My face has become a roadway for tears
The pain is all around right here
I'm chained to the ground right here
They say you develop a tolerance after a while
They say the pain and the anguish will become mild
Please don't lie to me, I see it from a mile
And I'm still in pain I just learned to fake a smile
So in between managing anger, being cliff hanger
Acting and being a singer, I, my soul aches
How much more can it take? Knowing everywhere I go I'm still a stranger
I'm screaming deep down, do you hear my voice?
I know people out there that fear my voice
Pull me to the top or watch me drop slowly
I say thank you, based on a true story

[Chorus]
As you extend your arm
Grab hold of my hand and pull me to the stop
I say thank you, to the top I say thank you
As you pull away your arm
Let go of my hand and smile as I drop
I say thank you, as I drop I say thank you
