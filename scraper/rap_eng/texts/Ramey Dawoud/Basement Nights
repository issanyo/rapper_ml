You either stay back, you either carry
You can't turn back when shit gets scary
You get one life, ain't no replacement
Just another late night at the basement
You either stay back, you either carry
You can't turn back when shit gets scary
You get one life, ain't no replacement
Just another late night at the basement

We just young men out real late at night
90's babies living our best life
Hollering at young girls at red lights
Please don't hit the blunt if you scared of heights
Basement, Independence Ave is our next site
Them Chiefs and Royals snapbacks looking nice
Told our parents we had different plans
Hoping if we get caught they understand
Dj Gio, Ziggy, and Antwan
Lights go off soon as music comes on
You don't even know who's on your lap
Mind is racing because everybody strapped
Just pray and hope it's not nobody wife
You know some niggas don't value life
Shit gets real and then them niggas pull it
Tryna catch some thighs and end up catching bullets

You either stay back, you either carry
You can't turn back when shit gets scary
You get one life, ain't no replacement
Just another late night at the basement

We told our parents different plans
Antwan spinning that new Elephant Man
We Nuh Linga and we leave early
Before the shootouts end it prematurely
Although sometimes we end the night in peace
Although sometimes no one pulls out they piece
Kinda odd it seems, nobody wylin
Me and Taye just kickin back freestyling
Another lucky night I'm not condoning
Driving down Broadway our stomachs groaning
We hit up Chubbys time to grab a bite
And that's the life we chose to live that night

You either stay back, you either carry
You can't turn back when shit gets scary
You get one life, ain't no replacement
Just another late night at the basement
