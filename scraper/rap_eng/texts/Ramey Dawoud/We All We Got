My nigga pulled out his gun and told me look
I ain't even gon lie, I was shook
I asked him, ain't you too old to play these silly games?
Don't you got 4 little kids and one on the way?
He said, nigga don't you know these bastards don't love us?
It's because of them that I lost my little brother
Father locked up for life, I'm living in this gutter
Imagine being forced to watch em raping your  mother
Thought I was shook before, you shoulda seen me now
My mouth remained silent, my eyes were asking how??
He smiled but refused to utter a single word
Hopped in his car, tucked the heat up in his shirt
As he drove way and we went our separate ways
I stood frozen in my place, caught up in a daze
Caught up in a daze for what to seemed to be some days
It was quite a couple of days I kept quiet I was fazed
Fazed can't even begin to describe the feeling
That I was feeling, I needed spiritual healing
How unappealing it musta been to be see me kneeling
Like a former 49er, Callin, on God
How odd? Part of me wanted to Cap a nigga then get higher than a ceiling
Another one bites the dust
But then again, ain't nobody got us but us

I can't eat without my niggas
And for them I will pull triggers
Can't somebody, don't nobody love nobody no more
I can't eat without my niggas
And for them I will pull triggers
Can't nobody, don't  nobody love nobody no more

As I recall, as I recall
How life can suddenly change, even skies could fall
A mere 60 seconds could soon snowball
Everything I thought I knew I didn't know at all
We fall like Autumn leaves with might
Still manage to rise once again like the Sun after the night
As I continue to write and tell the tales of the fights
Stories dead inside of me for years suddenly come to life
Parables beyond unbearable like
Incomparable faces of midnight marauders and thieves in the night
Searching in all the lands for a cure to heal the wounds
We became nothing more than beasts howling at the moon
Bandits and burglars, super predators too
Devalued to the point where they could put us in the zoo
As they cage us and rape us and beats us til we blue
We cling on like bubble gum on the bottom of your shoe
He loved his enemy and hated himself
Carried the weight of a nation alone with no one else
Yeah, another bites the dust
But then again, ain't nobody got us but us

I can't eat without my niggas
And for them I will pull triggers
Can't somebody, don't nobody love nobody no more
I can't eat without my niggas
And for them I will pull triggers
Can't nobody, don't  nobody love nobody no more
