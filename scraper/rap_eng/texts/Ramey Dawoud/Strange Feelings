I got a strange feeling they don't wanna see me make it
Strange feeling theyd respect me if I fake it
You can smile in front of me, and then gossip behind me
I got a strange feeling that I'm living in the matrix

1999 Wyandotte county, where we stay
Another shooting, another break in, just another Autumn day
We survived  it's in our nature,  didn't really know the danger
Like  fish out of water, I guess you can call us some strangers
It was just me and my brothers, all we knew was one another
Like Anankin to Sidious, Oblivious Motherfuckers
Went to school with kids that brag, some with tools didn't make it back
Bad ass lil niggas locked up in juvie for that noila clap
We didn't know no better man in wisdom we was lacking
Peeked out the window, watched them niggas next door trappin
Woke up to explore and find out whats so amazing
And all we found on the floor was used needles and bullet casings

I got a strange feeling they don't wanna see me make it
Strange feeling theyd respect me if I fake it
You can smile in front of me, and then gossip behind me
I got a strange feeling that I'm living in the matrix

I'm from where they practice polygamy but can't afford it
What used to be the land of gold until they sold it
Everything they touch turns to mold  the opposite of Midas
Better cool down the pace like you bumpin Gregory Isaacs
My words are timeless, you reverse miming
Break a fake nigga fake righteousness like a hymen
Don't mistake my kindness, as some sort of blindness
Draw blood like you dug up an Angolan diamond
If he wasn't holding heat on that great golden seat
I probably be in Omdurman roaming the streets
If he could just poof and gone or at least hop off the throne
I finally might have a place I can call home

I got a strange feeling they don't wanna see me make it
Strange feeling theyd respect me if I fake it
You can smile in front of me, and then gossip behind me
I got a strange feeling that I'm living in the matrix

No matter where I go I'm surrounded by real niggas
Not the house kind, I'm talking about some field niggas
The type that like to play cops and robbers with real triggers
Then tell you if you ain't got food come eat with us
You know the ones that dont never ask to split the bill
The ones that know how much family matters like Jaleel
A rare type, with them your secrests remain unrevealed
And when a pig harass them you won't never hear them squeal

I got a strange feeling they don't wanna see me make it
Strange feeling theyd respect me if I fake it
You can smile in front of me, and then gossip behind me
I got a strange feeling that I'm living in the matrix

They tell ya to get your finger prints on this and hold it
School lunch was free but we still stole it
Dun duh dun duh dun
You still recording?
Song is over
But you still recording though
