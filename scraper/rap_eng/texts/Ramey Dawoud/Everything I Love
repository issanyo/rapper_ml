I feel like I'm lost in the land of Oz, Said I'm feeling lost
With a scarecrow chasin me through the fog, had to speed up my jog
And the man behind the curtains just sobbed, how odd
Felt like emotional camouflage
Is this real or just a mirage
I can't tell everything was dark
I can tell that his gun was cocked
Then I smelled the gun powder, shocked
I got down quick tryin to dodge
All of my plans now sabotaged
My life played in front of me, montage
Felt slugs hit me, barrage
That's what I call a deep tissue massage

If you know me
I won't ever ask if you owe me
And I swear
I put that
That's on everything I love

I saw it coming like Raven Baxter, matta fact it was floating by
Kinda like 007 with the secret weapon I got that Golden Eye
The coldest times of my life thus far I was emboldened by
Tryna make my bread leaven to the seventh heaven but I gotta wait until it rise
I sow my seed, It's time to reap, entire heap, and share the feast with day one guys
And then unleash, attack upon the beast, as he appears to decrease in size
To his surprise, wiped the sleep out of his eyes and heard Dew dew dew
A witness writes, I swear as the bullets got closer they asked him "What you gonna do?"

If you know me
I won't ever ask if you owe me
And I swear
I put that
That's on everything I love

Sepia tone from being alone for too long, your world is no longer colorful
How wonderful it feels to finally feel like you finally climbing the pinnacle
These niggas don't run with me
These niggas don't really wanna none with me
These niggas don't really want fuck with King Kashta or should I say Ramey D
A spiteful person's sight, Hurts more than a canine's bite
Memories like the truth they remain, whether you do or you don't like
Some people out there heartless, other people ain't that bright
Ain't no such thing as darkness, just the absence of light

If you know me
I won't ever ask if you owe me
And I swear
I put that
That's on everything I love
