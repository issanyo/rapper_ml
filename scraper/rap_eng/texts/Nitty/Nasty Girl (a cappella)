You talkin dirty wanna serve me in the elevator
Wanna give it to me now not later
Mommy's body was a dime, can't hate her

We hit the elevator
Of course there's always haters
But it didn't matter yo

To dinner I'ma take her
Last time we sexed I had her crawlin like an alligator
She just came from jamaica
The land of booty shaka's
Her names Candy
Give it to her nasty
Sometimes I even taste her
I'm here right now she's dressed up
Hourglass shape, long hair, makeup
Lookin downtown, she said right now "I want it now, I'm straight up"
We're standin face to face, uh
I knew right where to take her
That private room called the bathroom
Uh oh, here's comes the waiter
