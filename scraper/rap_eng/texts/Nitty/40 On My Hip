[Hook: Meek Mill]
40 On my hip (8X)
Get hit with all of that, they be like dat's a flamer (4X)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Go 'head nigga, get hit with all of that
They call that ambulance, see your body, den call 'em back
Like call the coroner, that nigga dead
Don't even bring a stretcher for him, bring a bed
They ain't even touch his body
I paint the pavement wit your bloodï»¿, blue purple, burgundy red
The nigga's talkin' reckless, they scared
All 'em south gangsta's, they cowards, and call the fed's
How ya'll niggas gonna go against me, the whole north-side know that I'm G
Respect that, and I'mma rep that 'til I D-I-E
To get a pass, you gon' need a ID, to come through
Pussy nigga lookin' sideways like he don't like me
'bout to get aired to the max, like Nike
Nigga shootin' from a block away, and don't incite me
If they wasn't through me, jus' tell 'em come walk up to me

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: NH]
I put a little in to make more
OT moving circle like connect four
I'm really in the mix been around vets
Out Pittsburgh killing them 40 right in the jects
Now Bucky got them P's for the low
They cost 11 5 take a dollar if its slow
I never been a fraud do no fronting for a ho
And when that beef occur all my niggas know is go
I been around a while some niggas will say I'm good
I charge you for a verse don't tell me I'm Hollywood, I'm good
I tell the truth I make niggas rewind it back
I ain't change the back block where I be at
I make a trap I be right back no time to slack
Connect dealing with more squares than tiny [?]
Know how the 40 clap, sound like a mini mac
I bet it spin him back, get hit all of that

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 3: Nitty]
Get hit with all of that they be like that's a flamer
Hit you with that 40 make you do the Macarena
And my watch it be on bling bling
Watch me do my thing thing
Me and Meek together that's something like a dream team
I just pull up in that cream thing
Clean thing, I be on my fresh up on the scene thing
Sevens on my ass and my feet the [?] thing
And I got that 40 I ain't talking 'bout no [?]
Ching ching, all I got is money on my mind
Bing bing, I got hollow claps up in my nine
Its the same thing, I be on my grizzy on my grind
And I throw them shots until my biscuit on recline
See my boys about that gun work
Just to send a message fuck around and kill your son first
I am the definition of danger
Get hit with all of that they be like that's a flamer
