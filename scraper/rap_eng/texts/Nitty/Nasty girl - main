Do it, whoo, little nasty girl
Yo, man, see that? Damn
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Hey, girl, I like your flava, wish I could be your neighba
Must be coffee by the way you shakin' your perkulater
I'm the smooth operator, hot mommy motivator
What I really wanna do, put that thing on you
Butter up yo' hot potato, gettin' more dough than bakers
Rim's spinnin' like I knew your break is
You got it all give me a call, I'm ballin' like the Lakers
Hey, ma, now I won't chase ya, sweetheart, ignore them haters
Let's have some fun, bittys' got me on the run
Come on, girl, get this paper
Well, honey, whatcha got, Mr. Mans?
I got a lot of money, I don't see no keys in my hands
Could you be my nasty girl
And let me do that dirty dance witchu?
If you want just give me money
Mommy, ooh whee, papi
Shake that sexy body, do you like what you see?
I just want a nasty girl
Now tell me is that nasty girl you?
I can love you long time
I'm in the Escalade, you in the Navigator
You talkin' dirty, wanna serve me in the elevator
Wanna give it to me now, not later
Mommy's body was a dime, can't hate her
What a brother gonna do when the bitty rolls through
Who's lookin' just like Jada, we hit the elevator
Of course there's always haters
But it didn't matter, yo, we were puttin' on a show
Free for all your spectators
Mommy threw it like a champ, yo, wait up
Yo, I didn't even know her name, what?
Bitty's opened up your eyes
Haters better recognize
That Nitty got this playa
Well, honey, whatcha got, Mr. Mans?
I got a lot of money, I don't see no keys in my hands
Could you be my nasty girl
And let me do that dirty dance witchu?
If you want just give me money
Mommy, ooh whee, papi
Shake that sexy body, do you like what you see?
I just wanna nasty girl
Now tell me is that nasty girl you?
I can love you long time
I gotta pick my date up, to dinner, I'ma take her
Last time we sexed, I had her crawlin' like an alligator
She just came from Jamaica, the land of booty shaka's
Her name's Candy, give it to her nasty
Sometimes I even taste her
I'm here right now, she's dressed up
Hourglass shape, long hair, makeup
Lookin' downtown, she said
Right now, I want it now, I'm straight up"
We're standin' face to face
Uh, I knew right where to take her
That private room called the bathroom
Uh, oh, here's comes the waiter
Well, honey, whatcha got, Mr. Mans?
I got a lot of money, I don't see no keys in my hands
Could you be my nasty girl
And let me do that dirty dance witchu?
If you want just give me money
Mommy, ooh whee, papi
Shake that sexy body, do you like what you see?
I just wanna nasty girl
Now tell me is that nasty girl you?
I can love you long time
East coast, West coast
Worldwide, North side
South side, let's ride
Let's party all night
Nasty girls, come inside
Well, honey, whatcha got, Mr. Mans?
I got a lot of money, I don't see no keys in my hands
Could you be my nasty girl
And let me do that dirty dance witchu?
If you want just give me money
Mommy, ooh whee, papi
Shake that sexy body, do you like what you see?
I just wanna nasty girl
Now tell me is that nasty girl you?
I can love you long time
