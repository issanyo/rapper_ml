[Intro: Focus…]
Yeah, Outlawz!
E.D.I., Young Noble, Kastro
I am yours truly, Focus… let's go!

[Verse 1: E.D.I. Mean]
Now you done heard a lot of talk 'bout me and my niggas
Them outlaw worldwide mob figures
From triumph to tragedy
To right back on top, and niggas still mad at me?
For pushin' that big truck on 24's
A square feet in ATL game lockjaw
Man, that's what my nigga got shot for
Bein' to muh'fuckin' raw for these fuck boys
See the darkness, see the light, he wanna kill it
Misery loves company, and that's the real shit
But in 2005 I'm on some kill shit
Before a nigga sneak upon me and peel this
I'm takin' the stand, with MAC at hand
Born killer like them niggas in Pakistan
It's simple, gotta get 'em 'fore I die
Like the old West, see now we load TEC's to ride

[Chorus: stic.man]
I know, Mama, you did your best at raisin' me
Now your baby done became a G
When I'm out in them streets
The only one that got me is me
I keep my hand upon my heat
'Cause you know, Mama, you didn't raise no bitch
So if a nigga wanna get at me
I be out in them streets, my thing cocked
'Cause really all I got in the end of the day is me
Real talk

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Every day is a new challenge
I'm a savage in my New Balance
A lot of rappers but not enough raw talent
Blame the machine, but fuck it, I'm a hustla, bitch
So we start our own label sellin' bricks legit
Power to the people, a lot of power in my pencil
We the hope for the hopeless, a voice for the voiceless
Outlaw soldiers, we still in the game
Years later, less members, but the feelin' the same
Straight from the heart, we makin' a mark
Live for the day, don't wait for tomorrow
Haters gettin' they wrong
I seen the streets wrap sheets round the toughest of niggas
I seen prison put religion in the roughest of niggas
They say gangstas don't live that long, too many turncoat
That's fucked up, puttin' cuffs on your folks
Coincidental the Outlawz instrumental
And raisin' a thug nation, we influential

[Chorus: stic.man]
I know, Mama, you did your best at raisin' me
Now your baby done became a G
When I'm out in them streets
The only one that got me is me
I keep my hand upon my heat
'Cause you know, Mama, you didn't raise no bitch
So if a nigga wanna get at me
I be out in them streets, my thing cocked
'Cause really all I got in the end of the day is me
Real talk

[Verse 3: Kastro]
My mother ain't made no sucka
Raised in the gutta, I'm a made motherfucka
All I know is get paid, motherfucka
All day, motherfucker, one way or another
And ain't nobody nowhere that can stop me
Call me cocky – you tennis, I'm hockey
Mix a little bit of Pac and Yaki
With black Rocky and my pops who got me
Real talk, I never took a short
Unless it was support, I'm stressin', ain't my fault
And I walk these dogs, I'm a soldier
Don't you wanna be like me when you grow up?
A man of honor, commer, good karma
Niggas wants drama, I got the problem solver
Big-ass SIG, that's that shit
Plus the bully, that's a fully-automatic

[Chorus: stic.man]
I know, Mama, you did your best at raisin' me
Now your baby done became a G
When I'm out in them streets
The only one that got me is me
I keep my hand upon my heat
'Cause you know, Mama, you didn't raise no bitch
So if a nigga wanna get at me
I be out in them streets, my thing cocked
'Cause really all I got in the end of the day is me
Real talk
