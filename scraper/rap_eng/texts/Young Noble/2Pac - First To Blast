[Intro: 2Pac]
You niggas still fucking talking?
You niggas still fucking BREATHING?
Fucking roaches
Alright
It's the raid, for the roaches

[Hook x2: Tha Realest]
We!
Blast first when we ride
Please!
Reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life
And we gon' blast first

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Follow me, tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See, niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Chop, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned: word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Obama, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave, picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This thug life  nigga!

[Hook x2: Tha Realest]
We!
Blast first when we ride
Please!
Reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life
And we gon' blast first

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
We left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointing fingers at them niggas, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thing out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out
Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there
N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese
I got niggas out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggas out in Jersey, better hide yo' ass
For a long time if you ever fuckin' with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud
We killing your squad, my homeboy still in the yard
You the type of motherfucker standing next to the God
The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets
Young Noble and the homey Game flaming heat, come on

[Hook x2: Tha Realest]
We!
Blast first when we ride
Please!
Reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life
And we gon' blast first

[Verse 4: The Game]
Yeah
All I need is the chronic to keep me fit
A bad bitch, a project apartment and 2 pits
Red chucks of red big to keep my kush lit
Thank god for what I get but never really needed shit
I’m a hustler nigga, that’s how I got this red Bentley
Slay the competition and told them that Pac sent me
Walk in the smoke like "what up, loc"
'Cause one always got that bomb dot com that make me choke
We gonna twist up 8 for Nate, blow the smoke through the clouds
And hopes that it reaches the pearly gates
Now, how many niggas wanna throw up a dub
And be surrounded by the baddest bitches up in the club, yeah
It’s the mad blood, sixes on the ave 'cause
Phantom got your girl pussy wetter than my bath tub
Fuck her all night, wake her up at 6
Lil' mama grab your shit, get ghost, yeah..

[Hook x2: Tha Realest]
We!
Blast first when we ride
Please!
Reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life
And we gon' blast first
