[Krayzie Bone]
These niggas ain't seen what I seen
Dream what I dreamed
These niggas can't even try to compete in my league
Original runnin with the elite is my team
Even when I'm asleep
Many things behind seeks
Stay behind away from all the poison ivy
So far away from all the noise you'll find me
Don't let the dumb man confuse, ya can find me
Treat it like the 90s and leave it behind me
I never got stuck in the time piece
Never will I let the opposition defy me
See what happened to a petty nigga tryna deny me
Forgettin' that I'm me
I may just have to learn em'
I separate from all these niggas always barking always talking that shit, never walking that shit
But, I never worry bout' a sucka but I gotta take cautious I guess, but partner I get fuuucked
A living legend, now I'm seeing, I'm living, I'm breathing, believe it, I keep it one hundred, you're taking nothing from me
I tell a nigga, "If you willing to win it, there's really no limit, there's plenty of riches, better go get it homie!"
While I'm shaking, I'm getting rest of mine
I gotta keep a nine just to keep the niggas the in line
But see the suckas being suckas creeping up from behind
Let's see them hit they verse or be a victim of crime, And I'm
Not that nigga, survival of the fittest gotta be the winner
And if I gotta be the killer, Imma light that shit up, dividend, live again, light that shit up
Just look at my life
I done chased plenty things, plotting schemes
Chased many dreams
Just stay outta my life
That's why I muscle through the bullshit
And I hustle with a full clip

Looking at life
From a different angle
I've seen real best friends turn to total strangers
Seen people say they love you but they really hate you
They say the worst kind of person is the ungrateful


You ain't seen what I seen
From the block to the fiends
To running with Pac
Living my dreams
Getting this cheese
You gotta believe
That everything ain't what it seems
We stuck in these streets
All the lil homies just tryna eat
Every time I felt defeat, I rose to my feet
Third eye wide open, Woke up out my sleep
Travel down my own path
I don't walk with sheep
Put your money where your mouth is
Talk is cheap
Back streets with the rats
And the fucking creeps
Just wait
They will try to rob you or your sneaks
Gotta watch for your friends and the police
Ain't no fucking justice, ain't no peace

Looking at life
From a different angle
I've seen real best friends turn to total strangers
Seen people say they love you but they really hate you
They say the worst kind of person is the ungrateful
