[Chorus - Layzie]
I draw almost anything to collect my mail
I draw almost anything to stay out of jail
And I'm not a coward so I'll never ever tell
Rather kill a coppa - then to put me in a cell

[Verse 1 - Young Noble]
Aiiyo I'm a angelic rider like super slick
We finna start the revolution in 2006
I was schooled by older cats like Jeronimo Pratt
Taught you gotta kill a rat retribution - let's get him back
Waiting on my forty - acres and a blunt to blaze
From the slavery you gave me a racist way
Pickin black cotton with a cotton mouth, the truth gotten out
Outlawz and Bone Thugs show you what this shit about
Independant mindstate - military type aim young soliders in the game
Young Noble is my name, opposition I went from a solider to a general
The pain is my vitamin - information my mineral
Intellectual criminals, God fearin is spirtual
Who else done got me through all the shit that I been through
Representin the struggle my nigga this is livin proof
Keep ya faith in God my nigga he gon'get us through

[Chorus - Layzie: repeat 2X]
I draw almost anything to collect my mail
I draw almost anything to stay out of jail
And I'm not a coward so I'll never ever tell
Rather kill a coppa - then to put me in a cell

[Verse 2 - Layzie Bone]
Ahhh shit look what the wind blew in
Y'all better move cause I'm finna get started
L - Burna from the land of the heartless
Strapped with a 9 don't make me spark it
Y'all probably done heard the news if not then you need to check it
Bone Thugs N Harmony done broke away from Ruthless Records
We independant now this shit ain't funny now
This real talk nigga and I love the way it's goin down
Roll or get rolled over partna'...number 1 nigga that's my name
Winnin, scorin stand on point - better give me the ball that's my game
No disrespect but I run with the best of the best
From the North, to the South, to the East, to the West...oh yes I'm blessed
This nigga don't need no vest, no stress I want it all and nothin less - no nothin less nigga...

[Chorus - Layzie: repeat 2X]
I draw almost anything to collect my mail
I draw almost anything to stay out of jail
And I'm not a coward so I'll never ever tell
Rather kill a coppa - then to put me in a cell

[Verse 3 - Young Noble]
My Makaveli told me one thing and it went like this
Nigga get off yo'ass if you plan to be rich
Show the world so much love, man I plan to be missed
By a thousand young thugs just pumpin they fist
Tryna die with no regrets and all my respect
Never burn no bridges and keep all my connects
I'm labeled a young vet - my soliders ain't done yet
I'm smokin my cigarettes ain't no way to cheat death

[Verse 4 - Layzie Bone]
Only roll with G's and the differance between you and us nigga it's evident
Y'all niggas be sittin back broke as hell, and I'd rather be chasin dead presidents
It's benefits to these ways of livin you see me dogg and you know I'm shinin
Sold a mill went way past diamond - I could sit back but I'd rather keep grindin
Mindin mine, stayin out of yours - stayin out of theres just so focused
Look and learn and take notice I be reppin my set the coldest
Nothin but soliders and we posted up, y'all bustas can't come close to us
Fake ass G's be chokin up...while my thug brothers be loccin up

[Chorus - Layzie: repeat 2X]
I draw almost anything to collect my mail
I draw almost anything to stay out of jail
And I'm not a coward so I'll never ever tell
Rather kill a coppa - then to put me in a cell
