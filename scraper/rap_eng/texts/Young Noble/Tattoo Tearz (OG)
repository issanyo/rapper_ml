[Intro: 2Pac]
Live back at 'cha Westside baaaaby
Aight fuck it, we gone flip some new shit now
You heard "All Eyez on Me," niggas know what time it is
(baby Outlaw) Pac do it like that (wassup nigga get ya cash on)
Rhymin' and stealin', sellin' five million
(Kadafi, Napoleon, E.D.I, Young Noble, Fatal Hussein)
Fresh out on bail, niggas still can't see me
That's how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin' plan, and a new mission
(Makaveli the Don, Greg Nice, cocoa Brovaz, Buckshot the BDI)
Some competition, so they say, these niggas is gay if you ask me
(yeah nigga, bring it)
Blast me? It could never happen
At least not while I'm walkin' and rappin'
Heard of some niggas on the other side of town who wanna ride wit' me
(Throw ya hands up, hands up)
They can't hide, listen to the rough shit, my clique bring
(Throw ya motherfuckin' hands up)

[Hook]
I done said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears; now
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead and buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll
Never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life in fuck 'em mode, exposin' tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hell bound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin', my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, grind for cash makin'
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin' tattoo tears

[Hook]
Said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears (feel me)
Said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[2Pac]
Thugged out baby!
Yeah blazed out shedding tattooed tears
(I been, handlin' this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears)
This for my nigga Young Noble
Explode on these bitch made niggas

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Criminal ways of thinkin', I'm gettin' paid wit' Lincolns
Niggas turn made victims, get my rage from a gauge hittin'
Hittin' ya back, you ain't kickin' no facts
Fakin' jacks, you and ya bitch clique could get this AK
Hold a pound four, you catch a flame from my torch
The game was taught, I want my name in the source
Little nigga, from jumpin' GZA, Now thanks to Pizzah
I'ma tote the pistol, And slang the white coke crystal
The papers stack up, young niggas back up
Give me the beat and ill rip the track up
Just in case you wanna act up

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin' just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexin'
Po-po's guessin' if the stolen car about to do a drive-by
Wet 'em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry (cry-cry), but it ain't my time to even die-die (die-die)
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life (my life, my life in the sunshine)
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin' tattoo tears

[Hook]
I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
Shit.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein' my opportunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin' this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 ways to hit they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals to every last mineral we institutionalized
Locked down, got me shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style

[Verse 5: Kastro]
Yo I been losin' sleep, stayin' up way past late
With no hesitation K will lace 'em, now how the game tastin'
Awful good to me, let me see who would thought that
This shorty'll be a thug nigga, unsupported, never shorted
Winner, pleasurable sinner plus a rebel and, thuggin' and lovin' it enough to hug it like my next to kin
Bust it like a gang of Mexicans
They won't rush him on a solo
Watch me flexin' on 'em and stolen guns, bustin'
You should fuck the world before you fuck wit' me
Young nigga sheddin' TEC tears through these next years
Homie, tatted down and I think I'm addict now
For holding it down all around these immortal grounds

[Hook]
Said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
And I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me hahha
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Outro: 2Pac]
