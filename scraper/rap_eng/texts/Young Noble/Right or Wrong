[Krayzie Bone]
Baby you the shit, erybody know
You the real bitch, I don't fuck with fake hoes
You ain't gotta trip, you got something they want
Something they can never get and baby that's Kray Bone
Look, I don't care about these broads, tellin' me they love me when I they know they all frauds
When I look into their eyes, all I see is stars
They don't really have the chemistry like ours
And even when I wrong, you ride with me like I'm right
When my mood is gone, you shine on me with your light
So we ride or die tonight
Hope we're ready to die tonight, die tonight
Itâ€™s like Bonnie and Clyde
But me and you, we on a whole 'nother level, a whole 'nother vibe, vibe
And me and you will get it, get it done its a whole 'nother hustle, a whole 'nother grind, grind

[Chorus]
Yeah, she love my writer song
She was with me if I was right or wrong
Yeah, she keep on holding on
She was with me if I was right or wrong

[Young Noble]
Right or wrong, you was there when it was most needed
We was both weeded, arguments was heated
And I admit, I made mistakes
Shit, I'm just a man
Tryna justify some shit I should have never did
You stayed down, ten toes, my baby never slid
I come home, you still here, posted at the crib, yeah
When the world show me hate, you just show me love
Yet you my ride or die and all the above
C'mon

[Chorus]
Yeah, she love my writer song
She was with me if I was right or wrong
Yeah, she keep on holding on
She was with me if I was right or wrong

[Young Noble]
Yeah, like that needle in that haystack
Plenty nights that I pray for that
Memory that take me back
To when I stopped you in your tracks
And ever since that sunny day
You've been on my team
Back to back, hustleholics like the money team

[Chorus]
Yeah, she love my writer song
She was with me if I was right or wrong
Yeah, she keep on holding on
She was with me if I was right or wrong

[Krayzie Bone]
Who right, who right, who right
Who right or wrong, who right or wrong
(X2)

[Chorus]
Yeah, she love my writer song
She was with me if I was right or wrong
Yeah, she keep on holding on
She was with me if I was right or wrong
