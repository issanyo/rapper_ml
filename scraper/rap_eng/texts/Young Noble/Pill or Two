[Lil' Flip Talking]
Smoke somethin*coughing*
I mean you gotta get intoxicated
If you wanna be a rock star
It's Gates, Young Noble-Outlawz, Clover G's
Real talk, we got here

[Verse 1-Lil' Flip]
Come with me ma, let me show you how a gangsta do it
This for the club but this gangsta music(oooh)
I told valater fetch my car
And hurry up but don't wreck my car
Let's go to Rosco's or M & M's-cause they got the best soul food
My pinky ring lime green-my bracelet so blue
The Coupe is so new-the roof is closed too
I got ya back if any cat approach you
Cause when that liquor talkin they take it too far
And you ain't know that old beef, cause new scars
Me and my crew stick together like velcrow
That's cause we got more stripes then a shelltoe
You smell dro-but hell no you can't hit it
I don't care if you rap-so nigga don't spitt it
That's when the valie came with my drop top
The after party at my suite, now let's hit I-Hop
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

(Chorus-Lil' Flip Repeat 2x)
Baby girl I'm a mack, you conversatin with a star
My pistol on me but ya dude gotta walk to the car
Cause you know I wanna chill with you
I'm on that Goose and a pill or two

[Verse 2-Young Noble]
Bein a straight G, ain't easy to be
Which one of ya'll leavin with me?
It's easy to see, it's poppin where ever we stoppin
Get money it ain't even a option
Lil'mama I don't deal with the non sense
You dealin with bosses
So everything is business, no feelings involved in
Bring ya crew to the street
Ma let me catch you slippin, I'ma put you to sleep
I don't play them games, what's my name?
It's Real Talk Entertainment-I ain't gotta explain
This for the Macks out in Sac-all my playas in the back
Niggas ain't gotta flaw, you know they got stacks
Wrong nigga to run up on you lay flat
Whatever you thinkin it is-it ain't that
Baby whatever you drinkin tonight-I got that
Shawty whatever you drinkin tonight-I got that

(Chorus-Lil' Flip Repeat 2x)

[Verse 3-Lil' Flip]
I'm bout to throw a all white party like P Diddy
It's goin down all night if you wanna come with me
I gotta bag of that sticky, I got my canabis with me
Just take off ya Vickies, but don't leave me no hickies
I'ma pull up my Dickies and we can get us a quickie
While we listen to Fifty in the back of the Bentley
I'm still packin a semi-my new Mac, in the Hemi
When I'm back in the city, my Cadillac lookin pretty(ya dig)

(Chorus Till End)
