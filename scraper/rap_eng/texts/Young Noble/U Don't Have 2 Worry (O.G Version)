[Intro: 2Pac]
(Yo c'mon man, what do you mean you don't wanna ride with me, nigga)
(C'mon, get in the car, get in the fuckin' car, man)
You say you scared to ride in my car
(Yo why you trippin' man? Get in the fuckin' car, man)
'Cause you, you think niggas gon' be blastin' at it
(Get in the fuckin' car.. get in the car)
It ain't even that deep baby

[Hook: 2Pac]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one clique, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one clique, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Repetitive blows are thrown, to my foes
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
My unknown tendencies to mash my comp
Gettin' wicked with my ski-mask, find the stash and dump
While niggas run I'm the last one standin', the rest die
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon, westside
Though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
Five shots changed my whole life, throats were slit
Niggas died by my orders when I wrote this shit
Though we go back like wild knights at Latin Quarters
Niggas tried to kill me, and I fed their wife and their daughters
Blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin' past
Why you change, it's a cold world taught me life
Retaliation proves niggas never caught me right
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck
Quit bullshitin' nigga 'cause I'm still fuckin' yo' bitch
Niggas got me twisted in a bad way, why you change?
Fuck with me, all this shit pay, nigga fuck the fame

[Hook: 2Pac]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one clique, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes
Let them punks know
One love
One nation
One love
One nation

[Verse 2: Storm]
Now outlaw immortals is the clique, boss player Mr. Makaveli
I be that Bonnie putting pretty gauge to your belly
Now can you tell what's my next move
Say you're in the game but you don't know the rules fool
You call my name in vain as I proceed to issue the pain
Immortally insane, so I gives a goddamn
Trigger hand kinda twitchy, niggas actin' kinda bitchy
But they pass on by cuz I got killers with me
Deep in the midsts no snitches or witnesses
Just a gangsta party with the deadliest constituents

[Verse 3: Young Noble & Kastro]
This Outlawz bitch, what the fuck you didn't know?
Kizza-Kastro, Young Noble with the criminal flow
You nervous nelly ass niggas belly up in the river, no dizoubt
My niggas couldn't fade me with some clippers
We put it down, look all around, 'til we find you we hound
Penitentiary bound, to remind you

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
Kadafi I bring the lingo to the clique
Tasty like a Pringle, sneakin' through your chimney like Kris Kringle
On some shit, get me fee to let my ice click
Ka-pling, ka-plow I been a thug shootin' slugs since a child
And still wild

[Hook: 2Pac]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one clique, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes, let them punks know
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one clique, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes, let them punks know
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one clique, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes, let them punks know
