Brand new 20 inches with fresh vouges had to have that shit
Slam the do's on my Cadi Coupe, crank it up and smash the gas
I really don't know where I'm headed yet but I'm leanin hard chasin cash
Bobbin through the grimey streets fillin quarters, takin notes
You know these folks is watchin me, so you know I gots to watch these folks

Thuggin and lovin to get me some change
Till the day I die keep doin my thing, I'm goin against the grain

These boys in the industry wanna break bread you feelin me
From Detroit, to Minnesota, Sacramento, North Dakota

Let me expose ya baby - we's the shit
Livin legends in ya presence, Pac and Eazy bitch
That nigga Hollis pushin buttons while we blowin a sack

Fuckin with sack gettin plenty green - that's the shit
When Big Hollis on the track nigga - that's the shit

When I'm reppin my squad nigga - that's the shit

In the booth spittin truth nigga - that's the shit
When you stick to the rules nigga - that's the shit

And I love the game because it love me that's how positive niggas navigate
Jumpin out of Navigators, brushin off they alligators

Break bread, get money nigga hundred dollar bills
You a hustler and you know it couple dollars in ya pocket
Put ya hands up in the air and scream - that's the shit

[Chorus] - repeat 'til end
