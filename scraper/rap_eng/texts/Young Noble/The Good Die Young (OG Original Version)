[Intro: 2Pac + Val Young]
These some hard times we livin' in
Churches burnin’, planes fallin' from the sky

Can you tell me why
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
It was more than a tragedy, emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky, we tryna figure what happened
Burnin’ churches, fearin' God, who can be so cruel?
We all ignorant to AIDS 'til it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans, listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave them a choice
'Cause who are we to say who lives and die, breathes and stops?
All this judgement on other lives needs to stop
What are we livin' for, givin' more back than takin’
On my knees still waitin’ for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned 'cause Pat Buchanan say I’m greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war but can't feed me
It's so easy to regret thangs after they done
Babies catchin' murder cases, scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need, love in doses
In times like these we feel closest, the good die young

[Chorus: Val Young + (2Pac)]
Does anybody have an answer why
(It times like these we feel closest)
It seems the good die young
(The good die young)
Can anybody tell me why
(Rest in peace, God bless the dead, and we carry on, huh)
Can anybody tell me why
(The good die young)
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
(The good die young)
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
Now in my world, will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth?
And I had to sleep in a hearse, ’cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin', turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did, so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin' like a star
And this murder got me feelin' like my death ain't far
In the land of stolen cars, don't get no better
Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms and my, father
So tell me somethin'
If I grab my gat and get to dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny?
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
And rest in peace to my grandmother, Mary Clark
You know I love you

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Which is worst, first Storm and then Al
Pac and then Yak, Regrey Brown
Coulda' sworn I seen your face in a cloud
Family grievin' on your last breath
Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love won't stop
Jewel, that's my boo, Mom, Duke and Nu
From jump you kept it true
Helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin' fast, jumpin' the gun
Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja

[Chorus: Val Young]
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why

[Verse 4: Kastro]
I know my life ain't promised
Therefore the wise move in silence
Analyze scandalous times
It's hard, dawg, but we managed
And all probably damned for living our lives so unruly
Ain't a preacher that could fool me
There ain't a teacher that could school me
Since a young soldier, never been sober while getting older
Playing this dirty game of life, making it hard to keep my hopes up
I'm hopeless, just another lost soul that lost focus
Homie, the good die young, pay attention and you'll notice

[Verse 5: E.D.I Mean]
Days go past and as they pass, time move, quicker
No time for wastin', put your hustle down my young dealers
'Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers ain't ridin' 4-3 felony's
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize
Capitalize, mobilize
We in the war, y'all
It's for all y'all
My family, to the ones that's standin'
Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see (Plain to see)
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you don't, man, we sure to be done
And we'll all see exactly why the goods die young

[Chorus: Val Young + (2Pac)]
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
(The good die young)
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young (Die young)
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
(The good die young)

[Outro: 2Pac]
I send this out for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo' homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the former fallen soldiers
That's in the cemeteries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say
"I'll catch you at the crossroads"
The good die young

This for all the families that's in TWA Flight 800
Oklahoma, lil' Yummy Sandifer, Tasha Harlins
All the fallen kids, dead babies, closed caskets
