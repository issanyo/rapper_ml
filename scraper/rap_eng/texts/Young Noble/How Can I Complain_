Yeah, let's do it, ay

[Chorus: Munch Ali]
How can I complain?
How can I compain?
So much I accomplished still there's so much I can gain
So much intrumental for me to get of this pay
I ain't sentimental but dammit I'm feelin' strange
A lot of shit on my brain

[Verse 1: Munch Ali]
I felt the pain in struggle
I found my lane in hustlin'
I had to gain some muscle
And all the game can be contained and muffled
I rearranged and puzzled
I got my cards reshuffled
How can I complain? I did a lot of shit
How can I complain? I did my thing, I got acknowledgement
How can I complain? I went to school, I got that scholarship
How can I complain? I got the work and make the dollars flip
How can I get caught up in the glory?
Learned it from my old heads, the ones that came before me
Listened to their stories, knowledge they assured me
I just want the ring, but I can never be the hoary
I'm just sayin'

[Chorus: Munch Ali]
How can I complain?
How can I compain?
So much I accomplished still there's so much I can gain
So much intrumental for me to get of this pay
I ain't sentimental but dammit I'm feelin' strange
A lot of shit on my brain

[Verse 2: Munch Ali]
Convo with the devil, he was talking cash
Intuition saying listen to my better half
Every day I feel like Cali gone' secure the bag
I told my momma, don't you worry, I'mma get that pack
Get that Jack, make sure you don't gota check the tag
Expensive dinner on the ocean, let me get that tab
So many things I wanna do for you so fuckin' bad
The fact I can't just do it now, this shit just makes me mad
How can I complain? I'm on the up and up
In this rap game they don't respect you 'til your dough was up
Got my mental, got momentum, had to focus up
Hardest pain that's on my heart, it's time I opened up
Hundret lighters on my dresser, nigga roll it up
Hardest Henny on my system, I can't sober up
A nigga grew up in New Jersey, so I'm cold enough
Hardest risk I had to take, I think I'm [?]

[Chorus: Munch Ali]
How can I complain?
How can I compain?
So much I accomplished still there's so much I can gain
So much intrumental for me to get of this pay
I ain't sentimental but dammit I'm feelin' strange
A lot of shit on my brain

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
How can I complain?
We all going through it, the struggle is the same
Got nothing to lose, but everything to gain
When you came from the bottom, soaking in black rain
Turn his pain into profit, tragedy in the triumph
Raised in the jungle with the heart of a lion
You tryna' sell me dreams, but the lies I ain't buyin'
The only time you fell, the moment you stopped trying
Control your own destiny
I'm giving you the best of me
Gave you my soul, but I'm keeping whatever's left of me
My heart is pure, you don't ever have to question
Love me through my mistakes, never think less of me
Felt I didn't deserve it, God kept on blessing me
Pray on your bad days, the good days especially
Chasing greatness, nothing else to expect from me
Carry the torch of the movement, do it respectfully
Yeah

[Chorus: Munch Ali]
How can I complain?
How can I compain?
So much I accomplished still there's so much I can gain
So much intrumental for me to get of this pay
I ain't sentimental but dammit I'm feelin' strange
A lot of shit on my brain
