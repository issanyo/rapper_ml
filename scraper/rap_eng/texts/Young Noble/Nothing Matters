(Krayzie and Young Noble)
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all (X2)

If it ain't about me winning
Makin a better living
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all

(If it ain't about God or my family, my paper or progress, real niggas understand me)

Until I'm doing better
My mood is so whatever
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all

(If it ain't about God or my family, my paper or progress, real niggas understand me)

[Krayzie Bone]
If it ain't about no paper
Can't be no conversation
If you ain't talking major
You must ain't talking Krayzie
If you ain't speaking family
Then you won't understand me
If you don't follow God
You prolly followin frauds
If you ain't living life
You prolly thinking death
If you ain't thinking unite
You thinking bout yourself
If they ain't talking justice
Then we ain't speaking peace
No ingl√© until I see all my people free
If it ain't for the love
Then why we even do it?
If it wasn't for the love
I would have never got through it
If we ain't talking everybody with it we ain't talking
If the family can't ride with me then nigga we walkin
If they ain't yelling loyalty over royalty
Let me tell these niggas
They be trippin
They ain't saying nothing at all
So I don't pay attention at all, note it at all

[Chorus]
If it ain't about me winning
Makin a better living
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all

(If it ain't about God or my family, my paper or progress, real niggas understand me)

Until I'm doing better
My mood is so whatever
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all

(If it ain't about God or my family, my paper or progress, real niggas understand me)

[Young Noble]
If it ain't about my family or my business or my progress or getting closer to God
No time for the nonsense
Nothing really matters
I track by the chatter
Crabs in the barrel
Pull you down the ladder
Young noble the pharoah
All my verses powerful
Voice of the voices
Ghetto gospel flow
And I prolly ain't evolved unless there paper involved
Look at me I'm living proof
Thug niggas evolve
Catch me on the frontline till the problem is solved
Looking forward to the day we ain't promised em' all
Bone Thugs outlaws stood tall through it all, for year
Right there whenever the homies call
Praying on my downfall
They wanna see us fail
They want to see us six feet or see us in jail, man
Still searching for the better day, man
Some things never change, c'mon

Chorus
If it ain't about me winning
Makin a better living
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all

(If it ain't about God or my family, my paper or progress, real niggas understand me)

Until I'm doing better
My mood is so whatever
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all

(If it ain't about God or my family, my paper or progress, real niggas understand me)

(Young Noble)
Young minds we tryna spark
Bring light into the dark
Can't use half a heart
Give it all you got

(Krayzie)
So that's why we play the part
Painting my struggle through art
Making sure we hustle hard, go hard, that's what we taught

(Young Noble)
Gotta get it how you live
I've been thugging since a kid
Mistakes that I've made
Gotta learn from what I did

(Krayzie)
Tryna live a better life
And I'm tryna live it big
So my always what I give
That we tell it how it is

If it ain't about me winning
Makin a better living
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all

(If it ain't about God or my family, my paper or progress, real niggas understand me)

Until I'm doing better
My mood is so whatever
Nothing really matters at all, at all, at all

(If it ain't about God or my family, my paper or progress, real niggas understand me)
