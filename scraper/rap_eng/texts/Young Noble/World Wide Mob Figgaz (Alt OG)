[Verse 1: E.D.I. Mean]
World wide better understand us
We comin' with thugs from LA to Atlanta
Put ya hands up
Nuttin but love from all sides for my thug clique
Outlaw riders them haters ain't touchin' this
Hittin' them up in two double O 2
I got dank, drank, bang, what you wanna do?
Move out the way you see us comin' through
It ain't game it's true, we about to act a fool
You know the history
All out, ball out picture me
Ballin' and holding all grands for the victory
E.D.I. Mean you know the name don't remember me
Since it's not sense world wide

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Known for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin' me
And nah, it ain't the drugs, it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rappin' delivery is automatic, lettin' niggas have it
I've been labeled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks
Ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a, catch a nigga world wide
A fuckin' mob figure West coast who-ride
When we rob niggas money made my squad bigger
But we ain't sell our souls
Bustin' on my enemies, murder my foes
At my shows I'm a nut, lights camera time for action
Now get to clappin' to my cuts

[Verse 3: Napolean]
It's so hard on me, girl pardon me
I got the same spirit Pac had in him in me
When I mob on the dancefloor, I'm humpin' on floor
It's world wide mob thang and that's for sure
Got money in my pocket now drivin' in a rocket now
Never hear me rap about ice, I keep it underground
O-U-T,-L-A-W-Z for sheeze
"Y'all tryna start the East West beef again?" Girl, please
Get your money young soldier, time steady wastin'
I been around the world before I mean Jamaica
TO, BO, Bahamas plus Cuba
LA to Va (World Wide)

[Sample from The Godfather 2 Movie]

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
I be the Young N-O, to the B-L-E
Last name O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
And I'm still dirty dirt reppin' Outlaw records
Get your dough up, dog, get your flow up
'Pac and Yak live on, don't be surprised if they show up
At ya front door with a loaded "OH NO!"
Young Noble hit the block, what's poppin' homie?
You can hate but you know Pac watchin' homie
So get some love up, we stay thuggin' it up
Little homie, is you thuggin' or what?
Throw yo dubs up, put 'em real high
East, West, dirty South, North side, Outlaw pride
