[Intro: Young Noble & Struggle da Preacher]:
Yeah, Young Noble Outlaw (right here)
Struggle da Preacher (hey yo)
Tryna reach (check it out, yo)

[Verse 1: Struggle da Preacher]:
Another day in my life makes'em all look alike
You live like in "American Pie" me in "The Green Mile"
Everybody watches everybody cries
I'm your sacrifice i ain't scared to die
What the fuck in my life i am scared of?
Anyway i'm gonna die which i already know
I keep it raw for my bro then he gonna follow me
So many motherfuckers hated on us but we moved on
If it's on then it's on there is no way back
If you drag me to hell i'll be tougher than devil
My power from Heavens let me crack you
I'm tellin you motherfuckers gonna feel what i'm saying
I am paying my dues, my rhymes are my clues
While you fuck them bitches i fuck with music, dude
You got your life to live as long as i exist
Remember, i am a Preacher, not a priest

[Chorus: Struggle da Preacher]:
All 'em cats on the block wanna know where is my Escalade
I keep hustling and tell 'em to ask me later
That's a 365 grind throughout your hate
And i'm proud of myself for every dollar i make


[Verse 2: Young Noble]:
Everyday i wake up i count my blessings
God got my back my pistol ain't my only protection
Man, i'm just greatful to see another day
Get it how i live, wouldn't have it any other way
Leave the past behind, focus on the future
Keep my circle tight tell these bitches i'm exclusive, yeah
Grind hard, find god, find some business..
Mind your business if you wasn't involved
That's your problem counting nigga's pockets
They don't care what it took you to get it, they only know you got it, yeah
And everybody wants a piece of that
The cross roads or the top where im'ma meet'em at..

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: A.K.-S.W.I.F.T.]:
I'm steady hustlin', 365 grindin', 25-8
Bulletproofed my mental and temple cuz niggas gonna hate
I'm major league i this bitch no doubt „Homerun in every inning“
Brushed the dirt off my shoulder at home plate „Cuz now I'm winning“
You couldn't keep me down if you haters parked a truck on me
I'm baptised in the fire of combat, so try your luck homie
Friday the 13th, cross the balck cat you'll catch it
Can't have a pot to piss in, when I get it you try to snatch it
And want a scene like Cooley High, and me die like Cochise
2014 and beyond, my mission „Free the beast“
Don't start none won't be none, golden rule of the streets
Say hello to the bad guy who believe revenge is sweet
But I rather fuck with beats, stack paper, and watch my kids grow
Give back to my Fam, check out a hose and close escro
Now fall back, I'm dying free and not a slave
Or be buried with the others in an unmarked grave

[Chorus]
