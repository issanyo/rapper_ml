[Verse 1: Young Noble]
Man, i'm grateful to just be here
A lot of good dudes died young they should be here
Cherish the moment, deep breath or some fresh air
This ain't about what's in your pockets or your fresh pair
This about what's in your soul, the man in the mirror
Sometimes we lose sight just to see the vision clearer
Counting my blessings, want the best that this life could offer
Some of my brothers doin' life, some is in the coffin
This that type of rap, you don't hear it often
I just speak the truth and let the music do the talkin'
Drop jewels in abundance, my daughter listen later in life
She gon' get something from this
Proud of her poppa, i don't do this for a dolla
I do this for my legacy im givin' you the best of me
Givin' you the recipe:
Truth, love and positivity, good music and good energy

[Hook]
Its all about how you finish it, don't matter how you start
So, whatever you do, just Do it from tha Heart
It all come to light, what's done in the dark
So, whatever you do, just Do it from tha Heart
Sometime before it falls in place it gotta all fall apart
Whatever you do, just Do it from tha Heart
We just triyna change the world hope a brain we can spark
So, whatever you do, just Do it from tha Heart
Come on!

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
I'm in this game that overcrowded with lost spirits
Spit the realest shit, but most never get to hear it
But the ones that do, i call the the chosen few
Connected and repsected they supportin' everything i do
Without them, there would be no me
Thats why this Outlaw music is gon' live for eternity
Taught from the nursery the rise to adversity
School of hard knocks Outlaw university
Wakin 'em up, i love when they sleepin' on me
Spirit bright like the sun always beamin' on me
You know the words to my songs but you do not know me
It don't matter what you read you don't know my story
God got his hands in this
I was born and Outlaw i ain't planned for this
I see the lesson and beauty in every struggle
Independent king made something outta' nothing come on

[Hook]
