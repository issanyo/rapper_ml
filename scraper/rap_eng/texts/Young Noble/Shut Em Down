Got em' throwing up the westside from Paris to Rome

[Verse 4: MC Eiht]
They sent me to keep it hood
So I do not sell

Geah i'm real with the struggle

Never letting em' know where the pistol hide
Dear momma I tried
Still I plead the fifth
Catching them of guard loc

And the nigga to hit first just like the last
Now the beef has past
So it's action first
And the line that comes next
Outcome is worse
