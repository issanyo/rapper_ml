[Spoken Intro: 2Pac]
This some new shit called "Tattoo Tears"
C'mon
Uh, uh
Uh
(Many thugs)
(Many thugs)

[Chorus]
I said many times busters still can’t see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin’ tattooed tears

Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Verse 1]
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that’s a dream, though it seems like reality
There’ll never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin mo’, exposin tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin, my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin
Forgive my adversaries they don’t understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin' tattoed tears

[Chorus]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears (Baby)

I aid many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
I'm thugged out baby

Many times busters still can't see (Ha, ha)
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress' in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Verse 2]
Criminal ways of thinkin', I'm gettin' paid wit' Lincolns
Niggas turn made victims, get my rage from a gauge hittin'
Hittin' ya back, you ain't kickin' no facts
Fakin' jacks, you and ya bitch clique could get this AK
Hold a pound four, you catch a flame from my torch
The game was taught, I want my name in the source
Little nigga, from jumpin' GZA, Now thanks to Pizzah
I'ma tote the pistol, And slang the white coke crystal
The papers...
