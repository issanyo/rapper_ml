[Intro- Stic]
Wanna take a little look in the mirror right here
Know what I mean, reverse psychology
If the shoe was on the other foot (how you like that)
Or should I say the shackle (could you take that)
See what it's like on our side of town (would you like that)
No, no, no, wait, we in control right now
On your side of town

[Verse 1- Young Noble]
What if i came to your residence put you on a slave-ship
Shipped you and your family to a whole nother continent
Then made you work for free, then made you clean my shoes
Then let me fuck your wife, then make her cook my food
How bout we open schools, where they gon' teach your kids
A whole lot of bullshit and nothing bout their heritage
And now I'm building jells, they filled with plenty cells
Lock you up, beat you up, now I'm finna raise your bail
I'm gon' give you a job, but ain't no benefits
Yeah I'ma make it hard for you till you call it quits
Hope you commit a crime so I can give you time
I'm just gon' tell you lies, I'm triyn' help you die
Let's say I'm the President, let's say I'm them Congressmen
Let's say I'm the judges and the crooked ass policeman
Let's say I'm the Klu Klux Klan and the government
The DEA, the FBI, let's just say I'm all of it

[Hook]
Would you like it if I gave you a dose of your own lethal medicine?
Oppressor of men, make sure you're never free again
How you like that, would you like that, could you take that
How you like that, would you like that, could you take that
How you like that, would you like that, could you take that
How would you like it if I did to you all the things you did to me
Broken up my family, pokin' at my sanity
How you like that, would you like that, could you take that
How you like that, would you like that, could you take that
How you like that, would you like that, could you take that

[Verse 2 - Stic]
This ain't no jury of my own peers, ya'll know what it is
Only god can judge a nigga, what if niggas was the pigs
Now we in the judges robes handin' down the sentences
All my niggas innocent, first order of business is
We beffin' up the taxes cause reparations overdue
Now the ruling class is on the bottom and it's good for you
What goes around comes around, like a boomerang
Until we get respect as human beings

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Stic]
Meanwhile deep down on the other side of town
Peep how white boys wanna be black
If you really could take a pill for the day
Would you really like to see what feel what if feel like to be black
First stop is the hood, where the weed at
Put it in your sock so the cops don't see that
Roadblock on the block, now you lookin' down the barrel of a Glock
So far how you like that?
Now you're headed to the jail, locked down in a cell
Conspiracy to sell, no lawyer, no money for the bail
And who you gon' tell that you here, nobody don't care
Do you love that?
Gotta deal with the judge and the judge got a grudge
Now you wanna rub off the black and go back to the cracka that you was
Thought you wanna be one of us, cause you forgot that
Everyday in my hood it be like that, you can switch back
But for me it ain't like that, can you feel that?

[Hook]
