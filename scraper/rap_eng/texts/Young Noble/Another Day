[Chorus]
I've come too far
From where I started from
Listen!
This is what she said:
Nobody told me that the road
Would be easy
I don't believe he brought me this far
To leave me...

[Intro: Tha Realest]
Dear god, I just need to see
'cause I'm prayin' everyday
Not gon' stop
I just need to see
I just need to see...!

[Verse 1: Tha Realest]
I waken to gunshots on my block
Let me see what these cops got
My mind plots
But I really need to detox
Been on a crash course
Imma give 'em what they asked for
Fuck task force
Empty out the cash drawer
I'm broke as fuck, so I don't give a fuck
I'm out of breath
Any nigga gets touched
My eyes are teary, so don't come near me
Imma put you on the news
Motherfucker ya hear me?
Another day I'm gettin' changed, nigga a harder way
Put a plan down, motherfucker make a smarter play
I'm a nigga like I'm Timbuktu but empty ya pocktets my nigga
'Cause I don't trust you
Shame on you, you made me pull my thang on you
How dare you, to even think that you can compare to
Well, I'm Tha Realest, I'm a mad man, you feel me?
Another day I wake up, it's a nigga that's tryna kill me
For real, G!

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Yeah
Everyday I wake up, thank god that I'm here
A young old head
I'm young with grey hair, I done seen too much too young
I'm labeled as a veteran
Novacane for the pain
My music like medicine
The streets is numb
It's about where you headed
It don't matter where you from
Try to make it out the slum
Lotta niggas ain't here
Some dead, some doin' that bid
Now another nigga raisin' ya kid
They say life is like a game of ceelo
Talkin' to god, dancin' with the devil
One foot in these streets, one foot in the grave
We just tryna get paid and see another day
Outlaw!

[Verse 3: Tha Realest]
I just seen Mike Brown get murdered on them Ferguson streets
And you wonder why is blacks ain't got love for police
Ain't no peace
I ask god to help me, believe
But all I see is corruption in these fucked up streets
I got a plan but I really need to speak with Obama
Listen to me: all my youngstas jumpin' out with they choppers
On my momma, I'm tired of hittin' my knees and prayin'
'Cause don't think that nobody hears the shit that I'm sayin'
To do the right shit 'cause overseas we fightin' with ISIS
People beheaded and we're the ones that's payin' the price
It's so gruesome, but Jesus tell me where is the truth from
Am I dumb, for still for you to come?
I'm so numb
Rappers out here paintin' their fingernails
Wearin' women's clothes, kissin' men for their record sales
I'm hearin' yells from my niggas is jail cells
I'm 'bout to kill a C.O. 'cause they know they can't post bail
Nigga!

[Outro: Tha Realest]
I'm so motherfuckin' tired
My last friend just became my next enemy
Got all this stupid-ass shit goin' on in the world right now
Motherfuckers doin' Drive-By's and still hittin' the wrong motherfuckers
Babies gettin' smoked still
So I must still do what I'm supposed to do
Say fuck anybody
My mind's fucked up now
The planet's spinnin' the wrong direction in my eyesight
I don't trust nobody no more
I dont want nobody around
I'm like a ticket time [?]
It's just another day
My nigga Young Noble
Tha Realest
Fuck everybody [?]
