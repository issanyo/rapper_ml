[Intro: ]
Yeah, it's your boy man
The bay area's definitely in the building
I'm kinda frustrated right now tho
Like a few grand short of a million
You know what I mean?
I don't know if you know how that feels but, listen, yo!

[Verse 1: ]
The west coast is with me, the toasters with me
I smoke sticky by the zip that go for 450
Can't trust my close homies, they so shifty
Wanna stick around hoping that they gon' blow with me
All on my dick like cars no fifty
But all I know is I got something that hold 60
If I get shot and die, is y'all gon' go with me
I can't tell, this music business is so risky
This Hennessy and purple got me so tipsy
I'm off balance but straight cause the 44's with me
Pull up to the spot, got 4 hoes with me
They some riders, ready to do whatever so quickly
I stary lighten up trees, I'm so hippie
Like Bad Boy, whatever I need it's no biggie
I was born in Frisco, a cold city
I'm a young buck but I got a old soul in me

[Hook x2: ]
Rubberband stacks
Cardboard box full of hundred grand racks
Now homie let's handle that
I'm a couple grand back, few short of a mill
So now it's time to bag the weight up and rubberband that

[Verse 2: Berner]
My life is real, you damn right all this ice is real
If you snitch you pay the price, yeah you might get killed
My shoebox filled, white girl, two block sealed
I started pushin' around the time they had 2Pac killed
I only fuck with the mob, them other dudes not real
He took his time like a man, the other two got deals
Fresh back, feeling great, you see the Benz is out
I get way more cake when I send them out
These other rap cats mad cause their buzz is mad
They don't wanna see cous' around, but I'm right here
And I'm reppin' 210, this is my year
I'm in the city, damn right I'mma die here
Military shit with the beam on it
Blowing OG and I got my whole team on it
Yeah, young Berner I'mma ball baby
Brought 20 racks just to spend at the mall baby
Yeah I got

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ]
My outlawz is with me, my dogs is with me
I got the whole bay with me, Berner and Coz with me
Rubberband rap keep stacks in the shoebox
Invest it in the block, real estate, stop-op-op!
Penetrate your top with this thang I'm talking
A voice of the young niggas, turnin' nothing in to something
Military monster, millionaire crap game
Made my first million in this independent rap game
10 toes down and ones on the curve
Report card the same from California [?]
Shawty know I'm about that grind, I don't play with it
If it ain't about gettin' no paper, I prolly ain't with it
The clock is turning, you can ask Coz and Berner
We on the block till all the hours of the morning
Beats and 16's, with the white and the green
To me it's the same thang, feed these sick beans

[Hook]

[Verse 4: ]
Look, money machine runnin' through a hundred key
Brrrppting, but we snowing on a sunny day
They call me money man, I knock 'em out the box
Hoppin' out [?]
Rock, but you can still get the chicken soft
Peel it back [?] you fuckin' with the guwops
Mi amigo get a boat load, I get them offs
Send them off, make them touch down without kickin' off
Louis knapsacks, stacks on deck
Kush to that purp, I got them packs on deck
Lying on that H, I got that smack on deck
Everytime I dealing cake I keep that mac on deck
Flex, diamonds on my neck so wet
21's on the Corvette, killin' shit roulette
You niggas get the message no checks
With the [?] I'm pushin' hella weight, bow flex

[Hook]
