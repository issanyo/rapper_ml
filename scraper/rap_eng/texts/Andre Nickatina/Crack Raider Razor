Mm, that's the beat

[Verse 1]
Mics get hit from bullet flavor I spit
Change the clips and also leave this shit
I be high as fuck when them MC's come
But from dawn to dusk, man breaks 'em up
Like boo-yow what ya do now
I can hear them freaks sayin' "ooh, child"
From head to head
Dread to dread
Lead to lead
Spread to spread
Niggas be trippin' when the indos gone
Niggas be trippin' when they woman's gone
Niggas be trippin' when they money's gone
That's why I'm rapping on the microphone
Razor Sharp......Crack Raider

[Verse 2]
Time to build my juice back up
Like the curl of a banger in the Compton cuts
How many MC's do I have to kill
Before I get to the top of the hill
Camouflage Dodge and Pittsburgh Black
Doing shows at Alamo's where the niggas be at
We spend food stamps, avoid them tramps
A van full of beat with the Kenwood amp
Focus like a camera, keep your eyes on the birdie
Legit as I can get but I'll still roll dirty

Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
Crack raider raider razor....sharp.....crack raider
Razor razor....sharp....crack raider

[Verse 3]
A tiger like me can't hit the block
Sucker MC's are like microphone cops
Jumped in the game for the do or die
Hit the microphone stand and got Kentucky Fried
Recognize baby that I go for broke
Living in the city run solely on coke

Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp

[Verse 4]
Going about ninety on the freeway choking
Ain't no mystery to the weed we smoking
Andre Nickatina says show me some snaps
And Andre Nickatina will surely rap
I hate to be a whore but the world's a pimp
I'm trying to tell my niggas, man, don't y'all simp
Coming like a Mack Truck, miss me if ya foul, skunk
Represent the blunt when you get tossed up
Microphone flow like the Caddy at Ritz
At 9AM man the contact hits
Cocaine beats in stereo, thinking every car behind man is 5-0
Keepin' all my rhymes on a computer chip
The Sugarhill Gang got me doing this

Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp....sharp
Crack raider, sharp
Sharp, sharp
Seven, sharp (Mm, that's the beat)
My nigga Mike-Mike
Sharp, sharp
The time is 3:27 AM
I'm duckin' off Sun Duck Kim, sharp
