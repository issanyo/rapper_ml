[Verse: Andre Nickatina]
I let the weed be the reason I’m gettin' high and barely breathin'
I ain't never felt the affects of a drought season
Born winnin' cus sinnin' be my best friend
How can it end when I can't even say where it begins
You in the kitchen, birds move 'cus of prohibition
Above suspicion, if you listen you can hear em wishin'
My new watch the roundtable of Camelot
Dark as the clock that got you got after you got shot
Materialistic, cursed man, but still gifted
You should see the way I throw away my parking tickets
Statement mavis, eyes just like Betty Davis
Tryna cheat on every bet I do to make you have to pay it
Brain storming, Decpticonin' and transformin'
You’ll be just like you got stung by a bee swarmin'
Man this is vicious, selfish, and repetitious
All about Kahn and the money because its so religious
Man it’s the Mecca, light up the Train Wrecka
Hot as a pepper when the heroin’s a straight steppa'
The cogniac’n, Hennessey is how I'm actin'
If you makin' money let me break it down in true fractions
Dictator, shootin at the spectators
I don’t do favors and I damn sure ain't a life savor
Think you can love it, tackle it, or even hug it
Rap cat for real bitch, and I ain't ballin' on a budget
I’m Jessie Jamin',  talking loud and PF Changin'
They ain't told me to leave yet, I’m just sayin'
I’m top rankin, whatcha broke ass thinkin?
Money makin' I'm bakin and I ain't done yet drankin'
4-4in, Shere Khanin' and Fillmoein'
San Anton’in, foul you like Bruce Bowen
Fast livin', weed rollin' and blunt blowin'
Like Mickey Cohen, take what ya not knowin' and keep goin'
No regrettin', mixed with the no forgettin'
No hellos, no goodbyes, its just good riddance
Darryl Mackin', Adidas and my leather jacket
All in ya city, all the time just like a drug package
7 sinners, lined up with 7 liars
That’s 14 lawyers, which one I’m gonna hire?
Check the tires, no rims and big beats
Call the dealers 'cus my talents are in South Beach
