[Andre]:
It's the receese cup yeah, nestle crunch yeah, milky way type bandit
Sometimes i hate to be candid, photographers can't stand it
Stay dead like a battery, i hit em off with flattery
I don't do it for charity, i asked the rap game to marry me
She said yeah motha fucka let's do it on saturday
Toss the bouquet, grab the monay, jumped in the caddy then we went our way

[E]:
We open the do' to the next studio, drop the rap then we scat(?) to the show
Tremendous tracks with the dro (weed) we blow
Some hate the E but don't know me though
We stuff the philly, rush the really, and we combat sav-talk n' leave the city

[Andre]:
Im high as a mothafucka, prolly die as a mothafucka, get tried as a mothafucka
Get fried as a mothafucka, but dont let that be the reason why mothafucka
Hard as bret farve, burn down your backyard, do it at the bar but dont take it too far, some think thats lenient, fool that's the main ingredient, fuck bein'a nigga that's seein' it, when you wanna be a nigga that's bein' it
WORD

[E]:
Put it on the hard way, and by the way light the bleeze in the ashtray
Gotta hit 'em like a ricochet, and with a ten-team parl√©
And i know cut-throats like scarface
So ill hit em up till im down on the contract
Make your ass a little too hard to contact

[Andre]:
Lullaby, king nicky, gettin gone yeah off that sticky
MC's cops yeah they wanna get me
But i gotta body-guard like with me
I slang tapes in the strangest place
(???) written all ova' yo' face
Its an every day struggle don't catch a case
All in your face with a can of mace

[E]:
Suckas get dropped like charges
It's goin' down like a gavel regardless
Gotta travel to spread this hustle baby
Live life like a real rap artist
So im lookin' in the eye of the DJ
Waste time like a NFL replay
And while everybody's staged up
They look away fuck
And me and dre hit the freeway

[Andre:]
As we get in this millenium
Yo
This how im hittin em
Yo
This how im gettin em
Yo
Revenge packets im sendin em
Unh
Yeah, way too flattery
Mothafuckas try to smother me
Man it ain't all gravy
Way deeper than the navy
Ya needs gotta pay me baby baby

[E]:
Hit the scene there's rivalries
And some arrive with they cavalry
And the light is green
With the tightest beats
And im glad to be
So alive to see
That the sweetest things
Are alive to me
When you're losin' game
In your privacy
The rap odyssey
And that's obviously
When the product be
Droppin constantly

[Andre:]
I know fillmoe is my home
I represent it when the mic is on
And when the lights is on
Who said the fights is on
Cuz tyson's on
And then i (??) riiight

[E]:
Unh, so O.G like what happened to that
Retaliate with my rap and attack
The fools will fall flat and collapse on the spot
Trippin, didn't know if it happened or not

[Andre:]
Just too fresh ho
Sippin espresso
Livin like the devil
More base than trebel
Hit ya with the drug lord level hello
And like a kilo ill wrap ya up
Move like a boxer smack ya up
Twinky geeky crackin up
Ill laugh when i
Get my cut

[E]:
Take it to the dome
Then we take it to the stage
And then we see who got flow for days
And my rhymes like a shockwave
415 (??) when you cross game
It never ends when you comes to doin
So im livin up to 
How it feels to lose
Its like novacaine
And see beezy's can't hold the pain
So i stay high blowed away

[Andre]:
I see models on the runway
What's today nigga monday?
Mike still (??) sunday
Strike fast on a one way
You would think i was in a foreign land or country
So cold yeah round my heart 
Just like a eskimo yeah play ya part
My dress code yeah is blue or dark
Livin in a city called snakes and sharks

[E]:
Ain't no way to match up
To this stature
Runnin so quick that my shadow tryinna catch up
Dre comin at ya
You wanna go fosho?
When we rockin' like NASA
Gotta do it cuz i has ta

Burnin' up blunts with the ?? and the hash up

Right here in the flesh

And the phases switch
