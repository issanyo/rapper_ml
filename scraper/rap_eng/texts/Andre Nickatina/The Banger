Livewire (Livewire) June on the beat (June on the beat)

[Hook: Lil Blood]
I done got blurped, tags double registration
They right behind me, I'm hesitatin'
Fuck it, I'mma take 'em on one and throw the banger
Fuck it, I'mma take em on one and throw the banger
On top of that I got a whole zip of coke
Pull over for them boys? Nigga nope!
Fuck it I'mma take em on one and throw the dope
Fuck it ima take me on one and throw the dope

[Verse 1: J. Stalin]
They right behind me, banger on my lap
Car smelling like dro, cuz I just left the trap
I got a cannabis card, we'll see if it might work
I forgot its expired, now I'm hoping they don't search
Tell me get up the car and I'mma do the skee skrrr
Car so quiet he don't know that it's still on
I'm paranoid, any moment I can be gone
Then I gave him all my paper work
He came back, said he smell weed
Damn, then he asked me where my card at
I told him it was expired he told me go and handle that
I told him it was expired he told me go and handle that

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
And this the now later flavor your religion is the paper
MJG, 8-Ball, Tony Draper
If you really wanna keep the secret all up in your pocket, please take the hand of your favorite narcotics
It's feelin' like a dream cause the price is major
Drop a hand dope, hold it tight, it's a banger
We don't allow strangers and we don't have patience
Cougnut '88 straight Mac say shift
Mr. Bodacious, homie throw the banger
Man, livin' like the bullet that was caught up in the chamber
Coconut Grove, 409, I'm telling you
Used to do it to em every time and this is why

[Verse 3: June]
Nigga, I'ma take 'em on one
Nigga, throw the banger
Plus my banger got a body on it
Since we got gangsta
Fuck the police, nigga, I'mma throw the finger
Nigga, I'ma hit the gas, nigga, I'ma throw the banger
I've been done to jail nigga
Definitely not a stranger, homie
You must be crazy if you think I'm gonna stop at this red light
Shook down the back streets
Had to kill the headlights
Lookin in my rear view all I see is red lights
Hit the gas nigga, cut the coke
It's a whole zip, I can't stuff it in my nose
Try to blurp me, I'ma take em on a hike
Bustin moves, spin and bend
Shake it left, shake it right
