(Dre Dog)
Nigga it's the J to the I to the M to the J-O-N-E-S
Nigga in the flesh
Chewy boy, doobie with the buddha cess
I'm like the Lion King cause everything I see is mine
And Tommy Tuckers man I'm stoppin' fuckas like a sign
So read my mind, the situation's critical
And off that chewy man shit can get like winter cold
You think you know me? Well test your luck and try me out
And watch me treat you like a cow in a slaughterhouse
That cutty chrome, that microphone
That new Jim Jones, that indo zone
That watch that value on your dome
I'm putting beary fairy niggas in a state of shock (shock!)
And I'm a killa whale but nigga check my pimp walk
So bust that, crush that, crush that

Cuh-crack crack!
That's how that nigga's neck snap
I'm heartless like that wolverine
Deadly like that Octagon
Fillmoe to the fuckin heart
Crooked like the Pentagon
Recka! Niggas get jumped like checkers
So what's the use if fuckin Salt if I can't fuck with Pepper
So check my rep, survival tech, and hit man killa tactics
Niggas get buried faced down in silver plastic
Mothafucka, niggas get split like a wishbone
Dank or dope, bank or cope, Nigga Mista Jim Jones
The fat rat dominator, microphone terminator
Quick to break the neck of an E-40 imitator
Nigga don't front, you know I got you open
With more Raider in me than they ever had in Oakland
To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale
PLOT!

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
And I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

(Dre Dog)
Nigga check my Ike Turner way of doin things
Not out for peace, Dre Dog is out to ruin things
The most hated mothafuck in the Frisco park
And Tommy Tuckers that talk foo I watch like a hawk
So strike a pose like a deer when you see me bitch
And like a hound on a fox fool I'm on your scent
You fuckin skunk
Some sugar and some chocolate thai skunk (what?)
These niggas step up and get hung like a duck
Cause I'm the dirty worm hunter
The caterpillar killer
Attitude juss like a ruthless Cuban coke dealer
In Miami, nothin but the money and the power
A deadly mix at 6 foot 6 I'm sorta like a tower
Or a tanker, a mothafuckin Iraq tanker
Nigga raise up and get (dropped!) dropped (dropped!) like an anchor
The Guardian Angels lookin straight to rip right on the spot
Cause all you are are voluntary unpaid rent a cops
And I'm a factor, better yet a motherfuckin force
Now I gotta shoot you like a broke legged horse
In pain, nigga break me off beneficial
Mothafuckas praise Nino Brown and Felix Mitchell
Big bread, too mothafuckin smart for the feds
These niggas try to raise up (what you say?) but I heard (what I said)
What
You said
I'm like woof, I know foo but you don't have a clue
(Fuck you!) Nigga fuck me? NO NIGGA FUCK YOU!
Fuck them mothafuckas I don't duck them mothafuckas
I say fuck them mothafuckas I don't trust them mothafuckas
So without a doubt I'll turn it out I ain't got no time to clown
My first words are to the point-nigga lay it down
So rock me up cause I'm dope and triple beam to scale
3/11 is my birth but nigga I'm a killa whale
CAUGHT!

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces mothafucka
