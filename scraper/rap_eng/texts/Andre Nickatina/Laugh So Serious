[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
She said 100%, hey that ain't fair
Yo dream talk turn into nightmares
I know she ain't coming back
And all I know is I ain't callin back

[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
So dangerous and delirious
Man I laugh so serious
I start to stress like the movie Black Swan
You can see my shark fin in a small pond
My silhouette in the moonlight
Is something like the Joker in the Dark Knight
I'm on the streets like a muscle car
Sheeit, I'm known to take it way too far
My hand in ya purse like David Blaine
The money is there, but never seen again
We can do it like the Robb Report
Right after I pay this fine in court
I roll the weed like a brand new car
She hit my phone and said what you charge?
That depends on what you get
Bills, rent, and my percent

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
She said 100%, hey that ain't fair
Yo dream talk turn into nightmares
I know she ain't coming back
And all I know is I ain't callin' back

She said 100%, hey that ain't fair
Yo dream talk turn into nightmares
I know she ain't coming back
And all I know is I ain't callin back

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
This bitch tried to say Andre your through
I said call it what you want but I won't call you
Step to the mound like Vita Blue
Throwin' pitches at you
This cake ain't fake it's Duncan Hines
So don’t run by the oven when it's time to ride
Said buty not beauty is the number one step
Now whatchu got left?
Im so serious when I laugh at stuff
Hennessey, yea you can fill my cup
Forgive me for all my greedy ways
It's just a relapse from the selfish days
Mine to get, mine to spend
Mine to flip and my percent

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
She said 100%, hey that ain't fair
Yo dream talk turn into nightmares
I know she ain't coming back
And all I know is I ain't callin' back

She said 100%, hey that ain't fair
Yo dream talk turn into nightmares
I know she ain't coming back
And all I know is I ain't callin back

[Verse 3: Andre Nickatina]
I read ya style, like a TV guide
There’s money out here, I ain't bout to hide
Just because my hat is low
Bitch that don’t mean my dough is low
I hit the gas like Racer X
And I live for the ‘Moe, whatchu expect?
Stand out like a crown jewell
And that’s MJ 23, no bull
With a serious laugh that’s matter of fact
Back then I would get my hair pulled back
Once again like a muscle car
I'm known to take shit way too far
I aim my gun at a shootin star
The weed is lit, Rakim Allah
If you too broke, who broke you off?
You need an APB if I get lost
She tried to say what she get
You, this, and my percent

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
She said 100%, hey that ain't fair
Yo dream talk turn into nightmares
I know she ain't coming back
And all I know is I ain't callin' back

She said 100%, hey that ain't fair
Yo dream talk turn into nightmares
I know she ain't coming back
And all I know is I ain't callin' back
