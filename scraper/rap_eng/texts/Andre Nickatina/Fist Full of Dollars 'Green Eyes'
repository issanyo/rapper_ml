In all the five burrows I'm known -from movie

Boss dreams and everything on a triple beam
It's like a holiday scheme with wicked fiends
In a car I lean, money infatuated
The skrilla intimidated, illegally motivated
Revvin' like a cutty that bang on the block
Baby can I have your keys, I hate to pick your lock
Snappin' like a gator, never waitin' like a waiter
Cherry is my flavor when it comes to now and laters
When it comes to gettin' greedy, man I get green eyes
And I gotta get it like Muslims slang pies
Cuttin' in line just to get mine
Tiga I feel that waitin' is a crime
Arrest me, cuff me, bail me
Rap is money baby it'll never fail me
I'm like an antique that zip through the streets
Lickin' my tongue at little kids
The lucky motivator when it comes to makin' paper
Man you can keep your money cause I really need a fader
Hot like potatoes, hair in your gators
Waves that make ya sick like a sailor
Don't ask about my woman cause I'm married to the rap
Don't have to say "I love you", and we love it like that
And I'm chillin like the number one chiller
Around some cats that shoot more thangs than Reggie Miller
Nicky you a real rap dealer
I dranks my drank, hit the dank, give a pound and say "My nigga"
The situation make me quiver
The hotter the cap for the rap, cold steel will make a nigga shiver
And like pizza I deliver
Cop your rocks, hit the block, and mothafucka don't short stop
Do you know where you going back, it's like a reminisce of a Diana Ross track
You know I gotta floss dat, boss dat, cross dat
See the eye of the devil if I lost dat
Yeeuh, it gets hot in the room
Like a wicked witch I gotta jump the broom
Screamin' "Fuck you" by the light of the moon
Custom fit like a brand new bra
I hate to break the rules but I love to break the law
Get caught, gotta lie like a veteran
In the bathtub screamin' "Flyyy pelicans!"
