[Andre Nickatina]
Believe me, ma, it rains
No change
How can I have so much lust for the game
I'm so ashamed
No escape
It's too late
I've been replaced
How can I have so much lust for the game
I'm so ashamed
No squad
My god
The god of Khan
How can I have so much lust for the game
I'm so ashamed
All rain
Stuck in the game
With all pain
How can I have so much lust for the game
I'm so ashamed
Believe me, ma, it rains
