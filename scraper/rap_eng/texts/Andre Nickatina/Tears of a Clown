[Andre Nickatina]
It's mines I want that give me that
Ricky shake the party screamin "where the remy at"
Spinning like some rims on some daytons and vogues
And my my my how the indo goes
Freeze like a frosty with the cappuccino taste
Nickname my product like cookies in the cake
Like damn baby I'm lovin' your beautiful face
But my Fillmoe heart got my whole mind state
So illegal like moonshine rhyme design
Temper like a phoenix when I open my eyes
And mash on it crash on it blast on it
Count your money put your stash on it cash on it
Bring your life jacket cause you just might drown
Have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down
Bring yo life jacket cause you just might drown
Have you ever seen the tears of a clown

Rapid fire from the empire with no desire
Walking on a tight wire born again liar
You might not understand my love for rap
But until then show me where the money's at
And my tigers want cognac, Courvousier
Clowning on freaks anytime of the day
With no pause no shame no game no blame
Tearin' up the streets in my all star chucks
I'mma liquidate 'em all with unforgettable paragraphs
It was all for the money so we took the wrong path(POW)
I got bullets that'll crack the sky
Hit nacys for a burger milkshake and frys
"Nicky, why?" is what they say when I hit the set
With no reply I'm gettin' high so they gots to guess
But bring a life jacket cause you just might drown
Have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down
Bring a life jacket cause you just might drown
Have you ever seen the tears of a clown

Dot dot dotta dot
Dot dot dotta
Dot dot dotta dot

The messy getting crazy looking like a cry baby
Bacardi at the party for the flyest young lady
I told you about the frostys with the cappuccino taste
But what about the cats with the gats in ya face?
Check it
Luxury weapons fascinate the brain
Baby get your ticket we on Soul Train
With Nicky Nicky raps raps Nicky Nicky rhymes
Nicky Nicky caps caps Nicky Nicky crimes
I mob through the city as I crank the beat
Fire up tough on the gangsta streets
Steer to the rear like a clear learjet
Hit the corner like a shadow with the grey silhouette
Like rex what's next
I gotta keep it bumping
I gotta clown something when the hoes start fronting
And why I stay high off Mary J. Blige
And when there's a drought all birds do fly
All through the air 'till they hit yo set
And if you talk too much then you will get wet
But bring a life jacket cause you just might drown
Have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down
Bring a life jacket'cuz you just might drown
Have you ever seen the tears of a clown
