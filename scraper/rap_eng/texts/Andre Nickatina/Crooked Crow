I hit these niggas with the punishment
Enemy schemes top secret like the government
So check my rep from Don King my nigga
A word from the wise don't trust that bitch
I watch these muthaf**kas melt like a grilled cheese samwich
Chewy on the go then smoke then vanish
So niggas f**k with 'nopoly cause this is how I play
Lockin niggas down like they in pelican f**kin bay
Solitary, it's 1995 February
And you won't see the sun until 2000 January
Nickatina, I'm like a pisces but a submarine-a
You crossed yo eyes and I knocked you out cause you said I dealt with Tina
It's the pit, doberman rots and shit
Laid like a perm on a bad ass bitch
Big lips, smooth legs
I'm like a chicken hawk
These katipillas better post on a night watch
It's goin down, 8 pounds of that dank skunk
This crooked crow said I'm a nigga that he couldn't trust
Man I don't care what you think you f**kin super sucka
Man I don't care what you think you f**kin dirty clucka
Man I don't care what you think you f**kin tommy tucka
Man I don't care what you think you cuttin muthaf**ka
You's a crooked crow!

Mind on temporary drama
F**k these muthaf**kas but I'm a angel when I'm wit my momma
So wrap yo arms around yo body like a straight jacket
Bow down and let me rid you of those same old tactics
Cause this chewy got me high until tha next day
Muthaf**ka I'm lookin through you like an x-ray
Partna, nigga has death [never seen] your face
Well I don't think you wanna take my strap to my waist
Like yowda hoe get up off that powda!
Lemon muthaf**ka I can see that you sour
Lime your 9 cents short of a dime
Niggas is broke that's why niggas do crime
Battle! Nigga like Dallas and the 9ers
Wheres yo woman? Muthaf**ka betta find her
It's chillin, hatred in the mind Matt Dillon
My Vietnam stare will have you bouncing of the ceiling yeeah

You's a crooked crow!
If you didn't know
You's a crooked crow!
Yeah

[???] survivin' in the ghetto too
Uh, I thought you knew
Check this out

To the fullest muthaf**ka im the muthf**kin purest
Nigga f**k around and get robbed like a tourist
At the wrong place
At the wrong time
In the wrong car
At the wrong sign
Katapilla! You can' f**k wit me!
I'm that nigga every nigga wanna be!
Like SHAFT, getting square off in that ass
Dank 'n a sexy freak don't f**k wit hash
Reputation, smoke dope & rap's my occupation
Between that time obligations rock the nation
Suffocation can't breathe from that blow to the neck
Reactions like a report card nigga all Fs
So um, tiptoe in uh, Fillmoe
Where money is God and muthaf**kas gettin low
So I'm at you like a hungry fox on a jackrabbit
Don't try to test my temper cause I got a indo habit
And it's poppin, baby, imma let you know
Mother f**k you bitch goddamn ass hoe
Crooked crow

Yeah
Gimme a break down
Whatsup Lo Lo?
