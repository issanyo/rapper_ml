Hold the ball cause you just might fumble
Goin about ninety baby comin out the Bay Bridge tunnel
God gimme G's on the double, prime time trouble
Love to watch dope when it bubbles

[Andre Nickatina]
You must be dreamin, get a dictionary for the meanin
All up in the game like Willy Deamon
Straight up schemin, threx do a Motorolla celly
Make sure the weed bag is heavy
I never seen a vision of something so rare
It was right there and I still had to stare
Two paint brushes for a masterpiece
If steak's on the plate then I have to eat
Own it like a Leopard ought to chewy on you
It's such a bizarre when you see me come through
Vogues and trues, Chuck Taylor shoes
Don't ask me for no money cause it really ain't cool

Street love is crazy, sucka don't slip in the game
Turn around baby, what's your name?
Spark like a flame, do the Jesse James
Hit you with something that'll give you that pain
But anyway, do what you got the young friendly way
It's like livin and dyin like J.F. Kennedy
Did you know if you control the chrome
Then you control the dome that, controls the home
Certified like a bank check, but take a rain check
And what's next, the angel smells like sex
And it's fun, livin my life on the run
Shooting at fuckers with a Black & Decker nail gun

I represent it like a sinner, eat a breakfast meal at dinner
Cheat just so I can be the winner
Who cares if you're mad, run and tell your dad
I do a wrestle move then put him in the crab, huh
Put me in the deck when you commit that crime
If you get away best believe you'll shine
Bo general, repose on your soul
And then you start to talk in the brag and the hoes
In the Cadillac with the beat on hip
'Quipto sips on a Hennessy fifth
Disrespect Khan never, Nicky in new or leather
Forever man, gotta get the cheddar, whatever
