(Verse 1)
We can be just like a sandwich, like ham on rye
We eye to eye, we thigh to thigh, girl when I'm inside
I'm trying to work it and jerk it girl with all my might
And you know you're my favorite cuz you keep it tight
Legs over my shoulder, hands in my hair
If you pull to tight cuz Dre Dog don't care
Sweat from my neck is dripping on your cheast
And your sucking on my fingers as I try my best
To keep them lips up until they swell
As long as I be in you they should know me well
I'm about to get some honey so we can get sticky
Prince is in the tape deck the song is "Darling Nicky"
I watch you as you moan and groan
Taking every inch of the new Jim Jones
Your eyes start to water, you bite your lips on your pretty face
You say "Dre Dog Stop!" but I don't stop the pace
I try to make it last, go ahead and grab my ass
You tell me dig deep, I try to do it fast
I'm trying to beat it up, baby in a good way
You're trying to keep up, you say you know Dre
Then she get on top and I grip you by the hips
And I can hear you say, "I'm cumming" these are your lips


(chorus by Ronald Isley)
Oooh you taste so sweet (X4)

(verse 2)
Spread your legs cause i want a taste (ughh)
But you better not cum in my face
You got a flavor thats hot
You a brown suga tender
Chocolate, carmel, butterscotch
Your hips are like a tail on a wale
I can get you doggy style pull you by your ponytail
You stick my finger in your mouth checkin my reflection through the mirror goin in and out

And you know you got it good
Livin in the cuts of frisco
In a safe hood
'cause you my stuff and if you eva think about leaving me you better hold up
'cause you way too cute
Gettin at the endo smokin reverand in the 90 booz (yeah)
187 proof
I got you sprung with my tongue 'cause your young
Whos got juice? (I do)

Now turn back on your side
SoI can slide inside and continue my joy ride
Ride that ass into the sunset
We been at it for a while but I ain't done yet
I still got loads to drop
You tell me to stop
But you know that I won't stop
I keep banging them yam
Oooh shit god damnn

I'm bout to cum in a sec
Im bout to pull it out and shoot it all over your chest
Ooh there it goes (there it go)
Baby you could jack it but dont lick it till I say so

It ain't nothin' like... this
It ain't nothin' like.... this
It ain't nothin' like this
Over high with a girl
In its cool for the lips

(chorus by Ronald Isley)
I'll always be your freak (X8)

Ooh I can't hold it
Oooh its gettin all over me
Ooh I can't hold it
Ooh its gettin all over me
