You not thinking of taking over the cartah?
Yeah we taking over the cartah

Mothafucka so dangerous
Niggas is u ready to rush
Niggas is u ready to bust
The niggas ain't related to us
That mothafucka betta hit the back of the bus
The rap god said nigga tina is official
Do what u wanna, but never blow the whistle
Hot like a rhyme in your mind
Get the fucking of your zodiac sign, it gets worse
Wheres my heart cuz its not with church
On the ground with my mind doing major work
Turn around like a tornado uh cado
Never do your family like fredo
Niggas spit a rhyme like yayo
Get to thinking like a convict sitting in jayul
Sitting in jayul, rotting like a muthafucka sittin in jayul

(chorus)
Run muthafucka yeah nigga why bother
They ain't god and they ain't thy fatha
Five back will mothufucka they oughta
Taking over like nino did tha cartah
Project moving shit yeah it just got harda
Protect thy son and protect thy daughter
Money be the reason and it make me wanna holla
Taking over like nino did the cartah

When it comes to my lawyer, fuck them laws
You better get me off, fuck them laws
I done this before though, let me fall
Cock sucka and u betta show paws. punk bitch
I wrote a rap to get filthy rich
Stepping out of my ride with the freshest kicks
Betta vision so sick about a bed o scratch
And if a fucka try to tell u try to crack his back
Nigga weed and fo' g's they made a bad seed
Show me the money i show u weed
Nuthin but cons and mines all i need
The rest of u fuckas u can burn n bleed
Nigga roar like a lion, cry like a dove
My filmore heart dont show no love
So caught up in my luck
And muthafucka betta hit the back of the bus
Line em up just like valentines day
They never thought theyd get done that way
Just like rugbee thats how i play
In this situation just sayn ok

(chorus)
Run muthafucka yeah nigga why bother
They ain't god and they ain't thy fatha
Five back will mothufucka they oughta
Taking over like nino did tha cartah
Project moving shit yeah it just got harda
Protect thy son and protect thy daughter
Money be the reason and it make me wanna holla
Taking over like nino did the cartah

Man i eat alot of candy, cuz life ain't sweet
U get pimped slapped trying to bite this beat
Or even knocked out tryin to fight them streets
Blunt toed muthafucka dark in peace
Fucka grab your hat, get away from the storm
Homie u died on the day u was born
So forever, imma chase this chedda
Pullin somethin hot like a polo sweata
Full of greed n ambeed thats me
I just start to kick it at a quarter to three
Look for self cuz i be where i be
In that spot till the cops say freeze
Pop yo colla for a scholar gettin dollars
And all u hear is no contest yo honor
So caught up in my luck
And mothafuckas betta hit the back of the bus
Out the court and then i split that blunt
Fucka i was nervous i won't even front
Dont wait cuz its on right now
How u let a cocksucka bring you down
Lookin at the moon think i spotted a cow
Fucka motha fucka ain't bumpin that loud
He might be happy but that fucka ain't proud
He ain't wit it lets kick him outta the croud
Laugh or gag u get treated like trash
Fuckin with muthafuckas walkin that path
Money be the reason and its all about the dollar
Takin over like nino did the cartah
