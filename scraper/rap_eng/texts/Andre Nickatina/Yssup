Lay that body down
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
Wouldn't go round and round
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
I really like the way you get down
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
We could play it safe and sound
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me

I'm stuck up in the club
Lookin' hella shy
Seen as ten ta morsel
And the chronic
Goin rub dub dub
OOH
Gonna take that step
The bar's to the left
Tonight and I'm not standin
Can I have a handle
Sayin
Bartender
Straight to this time
And he caught my eye
Lookin hella fly
And the motherfucker knew
That'd we'd be meetin at a later time
Slip me them digits
You know I'm straight up down with it
I'm into pimpin, hustles, caddies, daddies
Roll with it
Let's roll
Or is it cool
To hook up witchu late
Now creepin
Sneakin on the under
That's what I'm always creepin
You don't like the apparatus
And the stravis it take
You got that kitty cat clearance
So come get the cakes
I don't see nothin wrong
With a little bump and grind
So drop low on the line
Any fuckin time
Don't havin time to rewind lately
Freakin you like... Brothers
Barnom and Baily

Lay that body down
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
Wouldn't go round and round
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
I really like the way you get down
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
We could play it safe and sound
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me

I don't mind gettin caught up
With yo big black dick trap
Cause niggas that I fuck with
Get flipped like flap jacks
I ain't no floosy flippin
No condom havin hookin dickin nigga
But I'll control your tootsie roll
So when you knock up at
The round front door
You better come on in
Cause the shit don't go
Drop the gold and hit the heena
To the room on right behind ya
Slap you on your ass
Your shit looks luscious from this angle
Lickin on your body
Foreplay
I Lay
Spread my fuckin legs Spread
We can do this all day
Rockin motherfuckers with these big black cheeks
Climb up on my titties like they mountain peaks
Penetration
Sensation
Doin the motherfucker my erection is in this direction
I'm kickin it down
Hella smooth
Up in the fuckin room
And I must see ya real soon

Lay that body down
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
Wouldn't go round and round
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
I really like the way you get down
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
We could play it safe and sound
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me

Lay that body down
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
Wouldn't go round and round
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
I really like the way you get down
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
We could play it safe and sound
Let me see that pussy
Don't push me
