[Verse 1]
It's only mandatory
The rap game ain't never bore me
MC's they try to fore me
Motherfuckers is mostly glory
I hit 'em with venom
Let the venom hit 'em
Wait 'till the venom hit 'em
King cobra, straight dola
Ticky ticky time bomb
It's just like napon
I chill with player's and rap god's and shere khan's
Man first I rev 'em up
Smear 'em up
And then I tear 'em up
Catch 'em slippin'
While cookin porkchops in the kitchen

[Hook]
This game is so cold and man you can't tell
It's like a plane crash one ticket straight to hell
There ain't no O.R. and man there ain't no bail
It's like a plane crash one ticket straight to hell

[Verse 2]
It's so symplistic
Hot of god look on the gifted
Nigga here's your ticket
Come on in better hide your biscuit
Mind full of doja
Freaks they wanna know ya
Cops pull you over
With a angel on your shoulder
Hey, shit, you better stop bitch
You want some paper bitch
You better pull a caper bitch
It's just like trinity
Double Glock scared of that enemy
Fifteens a penalty
Make you step back for infinity
Get your dough homie
Perfect you shoe homie
And when you roll homie
Then get your dough homie

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They call me Nicky
Half ounce of that sticky
Freak said she wanna get with me
Back up bitch
It's like tiger prawns and caviar
Doin 110 in a foreign car
Keep your mackin up the par
Keep your stackin up the par
Yo! it's just like livin' it up
Yo! it's just like givin' it up
Yo! it's just like tippin' it up, flippin' it up
Crippin' it up, rippin' it up Yo!

[Hook] - 2x
