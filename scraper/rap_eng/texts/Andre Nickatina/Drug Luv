[Hook : Andre Nickatina]
It all started out with that super candy coated, like Maxi paint
Ballin out and didn't even think
Didn't blink, just like a snake
Cuz Betty Crocker gon' like this cake
Four shots to the God above
I dress like DJ Run love
They say whats with that gun love?
I say whats with that drug love?

[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
Rhyme crime and actin' miraculous
Somethin like a fo-fo when you back this
Looking for a candy hill sugar hill, god you know the deal
Money, merchandise, and you ride
The whole situation make you baptized
Cooking cakes and resin pies
Everybody's getting high
Wrap it up, ship it up, no doubt
Who's that talkin' 'bout a drought?
This always blew word of mouth
North West East South
Chemistry unpredictable
Stop me cuz I'm rest to go
Cash is such a ritual and I'm blowin' it like its blow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
I parlay like every day
Got a call from B-Shaw today
He said its totally infatuated down in in love with 'Dre
OK straight down biz
Gotta get across that ol' Bay Bridge
Freaking, acting like little kids
Like Dorothy when she made her wish
At that, had to jump in that Cadillac, that Cadillac
Like Lynch Hung did with maniac, with maniac
That homie that a maniac
It ain't that simplematic, representing illmatic
Show me dollar bills, I'm at it
Man I'm so infatuated
Up-to-date and complicated
Suits that's totally tailor-made
Turn me around about prime design (?)
Like Magic Johson in his prime
Yo man pass to a quarterback
Man it added up to like, 40 racks
But it ain't enough, and I'm knowing that
So baby said shes going back

[Outro: Andre Nickatina]
Rhyme, crime, and actin' miraculous
Something like a fo-fo when you back this
Lookin for a candy hill, sugar hill
God you know the deal
Money, merchandise, and you ride
The whole situation make you baptized
Cooking cakes and resin pies
Everybody's getting high
Rap it up ship it up no doubt
Who's that talkin' bout a drought?
This always blew word of mouth
North West East South
Chemistry unpredictable
Stop me cuz I'm rest to go
Cash is such a ritual
And I'm blowing it like its blow
It all started out with that super candy coated, like Maxi paint
Balling out, and didn't even think
Didn't blink, just like a snake
Cuz Betty Crocker gon' like this cake
Four shots to the God above
I dress like DJ Run love
They say whats with that gun love?
I say whats with that drug love?
