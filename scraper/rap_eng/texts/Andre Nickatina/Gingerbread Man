"J'aibe soin d'un crayon..."

[Verse 1]

You better make it and lace it
And hope the pigs don't take it
And keep your mission basic
No time to come and fake it
Spin like a CD, you know it's Nicky T
Come to your party, with no apology
All at your function
This ain't no usual luncheon
I see what I like and then I jump in
Float like a Cadillac
Girl can ya handle that?
Hittin' on cognac
Now you don't know how to act
I'm your favorite Motorola
Your new Coca-Cola
At least until you get tired of my new poster
It's about the money, and bread and never fantasy
A situation might change your whole anatomy
Who hit the jackpot?
Hot as a crack spot
Took out the cash box
And left with a flash, doc
Shit, you know
J'aibe soin d'un crayon
The Gingerbread Man
J'aibe soin d'un crayon
My young tiga Don Juan
He hooked me with butter pecan
That there was real sweet
Something I would keep
I live like a Gipsy, rap till I'm empty
Fly like a Frisbee, but hung like a Grizzly
You know, I blow
And there, I go
All on the freeway
Me and my queen mayne
I eats Gumbo, the jumbo shrimp combo
And when I clown, ho I smile like a criminal
I can be like Ecstasy
Show you a whole new recipe
Don't even know why you step to me
Sayin' you ain't impressed with me
I ain't trippin' darlin'
I hear my homies callin'
And when there's money involved
Man they despise stallin'
Hook it up and then cook it up
Man shook it up and then look it up
And rock it up and then chop it up
Man block it up and then cop it up
I hit the underground trains and thangs
Stood there rappin' till the rain done came
Until the game done changed
Man I'mma get it man
And don't forget it man...

Shit, So greedy
Don't think that I can split it man
The Gingerbread Man
Catch me if you can

You back there... "J'aibe soin d'un crayon"
Bartender, bartender... "J'aibe soin d'un crayon"
Waitress, waitress... "J'aibe soin d'un crayon"
You think I'm playin' baby? ... "J'aibe soin d'un crayon"

Shit, shit...

"J'aibe soin d'un crayon..."
