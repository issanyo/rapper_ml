I be that nigga that be the mothafucka here
The mothafucka there
Knock a Tina out and have her sleepin like a bear
In the winter, you lookin for the dragon then enter
I'm warning ya, slapping you like President Abaloneya
So now, this indo got me snappin like an alligator
Take her up and down like a mothafuckin elevator
Serve em, I gotta get the mothafuckin money (right)
Then hit em with the force of a car crash dummy
These hoes will have a muthafuckas heart on cold
Stoppin mothafuckas like 4th and goal
And on 4th and goal, I'm legit for the blitz
But I'm gonna set up in the middle for an LT hit like bam
Bitch you think I give a God damm?
Breakin backboards on NBA Jams
You little heffa, I'm breathin down your mothafuckin neck
With reactions like a black hero Vietnam vet
Upset, like you lost a fuckin million dollar check
To a heffa who's name was tattooed on his neck
