She said she hated drug dealers, pimps and rap cats
I looked at the bitch I said
“Bitch holla back”
But never like that
I’ll put you in a ‘Lac
And give you to my homie and let you walk around the track

Lost in the storm of the greed and the lust
I enter in the world of hoes and handcuffs
Man I'mma work your ankles like an ?
And still kick back like a rap rhyme saya
Shine like the moon cuz I’m groomed so swell
Hoes get jealous of a nigga can’t you tell?
We kick it so live man me and about five
Playas that know the honey to the bee hive
I can see it in your eyes
You’re thinking that I’m fly
You gon’ see se if I’m sucka first but bitch don’t even try
Man this what you got
A cat on spot
Man check it freak
A leopard don’t change his spots
Man like it or not
My world is like a pipe
Homies suck you in and blow you out all night

My cell phones goin’ and you knowin that I’m hoin’
And its showin’ in my style and my smiles and my frown
Break the weed down

She said she hated drug dealers pimps and rap cats
I looked at the bitch I said
“Bitch holla back”
But never like that
I’ll put you in a ‘Lac
And give you to my homie and have you walk around the track

My Coca Cola smile will make you walk ten miles
All in a circle while we rollin’ up that Purple
Don’t even ask Erckle
Whether chocolate or vanilla baby
Ballin on the spot
I'mma let my hair blow in a drop top
The Situations Critical
It’s sorta like a miracle
It’s something that’s too spiritual
The money though here we go
Diamond in the rough
Baby you so tough
I’m in a Cadi and your mans on the bus
I’m fixin on a Ford
Oh my Lord
Rap cat sheer Khan down to the core
It’s just like that though blow by blow
Get low
No dough
Go just go
Time after time
I be rippin with the rhyme
My zodiac sign”ll take a swim through your mind
Baby if you’re with me you can come and get me
Here’s your break
Don’t be fake
Get your cake
We can bake

She said she hated drug dealers, pimps and rap cats

Man out there in land lost
They say “God yo, you Jack Frost”
A cold drought and you out there pushing up the cost
So whatcha talkin’ ‘bout?
Who said it was a drought?
I talk to cats that say “Bring the Benzes out”
You had a nightmare baby boy you daydreamin’
The fiends’ fiend
You can’t stop the fiends feenin’
I like to get away
A dinner date
A party place
I hit the corner and talk to you in a naughty way
What’s happening?
I’m hi tech just like Japan
A phone call from me freak will cost a grand
I’m like a silencer
The tip of a gun barrel
Man cupid never hits me ho I escape arrows
It’s not the straight and narrow
It’s not a Christmas carol
Its just fresh apparel
It’s just a Khan pharaoh?
It’s just a game to get paid
You ricocheted all in the blade mane
You know you say it’s in the game

She said she hated drug dealers, pimps and rap cats
I looked at the bitch I said
“Bitch holla back”
But never like that
I’ll put you in a ‘Lac
And give you to my homie and have you walk around the track
