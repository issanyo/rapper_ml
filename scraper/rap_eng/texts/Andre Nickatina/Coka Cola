Im like some coca-cola
Better yet a motorola
Man time is gettin shorter
Or should i say like colda
Man cats is gettin bolder
From moving banking soda
Man bullets dance like clubs on them hot corners
I kick it live and wicked
Like a winning lotto ticket
Man hide your money
Hide your dope
And hide your ruler biscuit
It's like so devestated
The way i say so gated
So keep your clorox when you see me cuz I can't be faded
Its about that scrilla mail
Some suckas bite they nails
Cuz they just sold their soul like a crack sale
All outta black mail
All in them packed jails
Until you get there man you think its like a ghost tale
But check it out i see ya
But wouldn't wanna be ya
Cuz even all in korea
They know nickatina
Man i could be your neighbor
Your favorite icecream flavour
Your city county mayor
Alaskin polar bear
Im on the roli that hogged the freeway
In a majorway
Man get at me today YO! SO!
I swang like peter parker
I walk like johnny walker
Some cats they welcome back man
Like i was mister carter
I dress like darth vader
Snap back like alligator
8 packs are down later
Well call like auto traders
Love doin my motha favors
Talk shit with major players
Stay away from space invador cock blockin playa haters
I stay in good season
No matter what the reason
And i be screaming at demons until i ain't breathin
N yo i ain't leaving
Until i get minez
So crack a 40 for urself because we got time
I keep the speakers bumpin
I keep ya ride slumpin
Ya future looks bright so freak why you here frontin
Japanese they serve me saki
It make me feel like cocky
Remonis dont need 40 when he raps on carlos rossy
Im not a carbon copy
Nothin ever really shocks me
Man im a speedy cat
Man im not big and stocky
I lace your mindthought
Like im your underboss
A loanshark that makes bets that can choke the cause
I ride it rocky yall
Like kawasaki yall
Flew through these streets
Like a snake
Until they stopped me yall
