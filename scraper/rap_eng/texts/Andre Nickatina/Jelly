[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
Got out the car and said send her, don’t bend her
Maybe she’s a winner
I tell her that she thick, she say she wanna be thinner
She something like a steak and prime Hennessy dinner
When she walk downtown, other bitches wanna get her
I’m Barney Rubble man, looking for a Betty
Who’s super duper fast with the fetti
Jam things up like Teddy
Peanut butter ready, make a real rap cat say jelly

[Hook: Problem]
Yeah, real I be, errybody know me, need no ID
Go hard on a ho, over VIP
I am P, bitch you know I’m 'bout the motherfucking paper
Yeah, I’m 'bout the paper
Bitch don’t wanna do what I say, I’ma make her
Yeah, I’m 'bout the paper, yeah I’m 'bout the paper
Bitch don’t wanna do what I say, I’ma make her

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
Man, these the type of pancakes that you like to see in the morning
Nothing that she wear be boring
Dolce & Gabbana blue light
That’s what I wore tonight
For you to choose, break the shelf right, holla back
I let my curls fall out my hat
She like the vodka with the 7-Up, go bitch, throw it back
I might have to fast forward that, because the peanut butter ready
So go ahead and add the jelly

[Verse 3: Problem]
Problem in this thang, diamond is the lane
Car paint wet like I’m riding in the rain
Swerving through the town drunk
Mixing light and brown, not giving a mad fuck
Cause I got the niggas get down
Got a thick chick with me, I met her through my rally
Peanut butter skin, pussy sweet as jelly
Bang to the telly, got her drug, gave her liquor
Then I thought to myself
Why fuck when I can pimp her?

[Hook: Problem]

[Verse 4: Andre Nickatina]
She said what’s up with the nose candy
Then let’s get the party started
My ex-boyfriend was light-hearted
Now he’s with the dearly departed
Hello, nighttime mellow
Moving that Jell-o, heels stay steady
Peanut butter ready, make a real rap cat say jelly

[Hook: Problem]
