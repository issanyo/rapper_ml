[Intro]
Nickatina says cast your votes
Tell all the freaks, yeah grab your coats
Tell all the nerds, yeah take some notes
And R&B niggas, ya'll clear your throats
Nickatina been at since 11
Got me a house up in gang bang heaven
My mother use to say that I was like a little reverend
That's why they call me God # 7

[Verse 1]
I like birds cause I'm a hawk
Try to clown me ho and I'mma walk
Rockin' your party is my favorite part
Did it for an hour and I didn't even talk (bitch)
Nickatina is like simon says
Dips in his whip like simon says
Make a few chips like simon says
Smoke a little weed in the back with the dreads (yo)
I take pride in smelling fly
Baby ain't no telling why I blaze
I sport Chuck Taylors twice a week
Gotta keep an ear out on the streets
Man I'm kinda high, you said, who got beef?
Nigga take advice from these nasty freaks (yeah)
Did you see the cold steel?
Homey that shit'll make you cold for real
Even though it's hot when its bout to hit
Hot enough to make a bastard do a flip
What you know about ghetto cheese?
All she heard on the phone was "nigga please" (click)
I'm like an ice cream truck
Veins get cold when I cut this blunt
Nothing but fire tiga in my path
And nah man you can't have no autograph

[Verse 2]
Nickatina says bust back first
And by any means necessary don't get hurt
The five millimeter go good with the nina
Just like raps go good with Nickatina
Nickatina says lace your boots
Real drug style Armani suits
Check this out baby, I'ma tell the truth
You'se a freak and not that cute, ho
I kick back like expensive wine, spit paragraphs all the test of time
It's just like ya found a treasure chest with mines
Just like ya found a treasure chest with mines, nigga
Andre is like the moon
Come out after six tiga ready to boom (move)
It ain't no thang to me
Easy as pie, can you hang with me (fast)
I mix it up like rum Barcardi
Talk and walk and smoke weed at the party
Gamble on yourself for about two g''s
Im eating water melon way juicy, fuck it
Check it out I get blunted on top
Living like an anvil ready to drop (playa)
