{Intro}

{Verse 1: Mac Dre}
I'm at the club, chipped up diamonds in my mouth
Collar flipped up on my Levi Strauss
When I leave thy house, boy I'm always dipped up
Me and Equipto at the bar gettin ripped up
Double shot Grey Goose dirty martini
I'm Al Boo Boo of the lamp, I'm the genie
Can't do the Chingy when I thizzle wiggle on 'em
Can't handle'em sick Drizzle on 'em
Man I'm too bad, going off two bags
Off Rappers Delight not the shit that you had
Don't funk push it partner I push it
I got that long on yah heads and I kush it
Push it push it real good I feel good
Kilo pass the Back so I can unpeel wood
I make hits, not pop flies
And wear more ice then boxers with black eyes

{Verse 2: Andre Nickatina}
Man I don't tell dem bitches that I'm goin to the party
Cause if I tell them bitches hoes will tell everybody
My Lexus just bought the Nakamichi
I'm in the shoe store trying gators when ya see me, you don't speak
I hit Vegas for a whole week
I'm trying to catch the tears that be comin' down my son's cheek
You praise Ron King I like Don King
I'm gettin money n' ain't even in the damn ring
I turn around like there's police sirens
I always tell broke bitches that pimps is hirin' now
So take a photograph
Or write a paragraph
The homie banging I can see cause he wear a flag
I hit the Energizer bunny with a Duracell
I hit Wilson's on time for the leather sale
I grab two blunts straight out the Swisher box
Gotta get the same rush a shooter gets from a Glock
My shoes match ma socks
I like to have a knot
My old crack neighborhood was called Bedrock
We like to fight back
You need to light that
This church preaching about the bible of a rap cat
I keep it moving like hoes that's choosing
Hittin' Privilege Hennessy wit em' all in the afternoon n'
I run through the city like it's grand larsony
Don't hit tha after party bitch whats stopping me?
I dress properly
Hoes try to copy me
I hang with pimps that say niggas neva knockin' me
I like to talk trash
Especially when I walk fast
Movin' through the airport with my blue polo bag

{Outro}
