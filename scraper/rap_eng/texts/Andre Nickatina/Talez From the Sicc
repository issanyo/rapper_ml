( II sicc)

Down for the bread spittin raps from the head
Catch the vapors from the ledge

Sportin gold lugz to hilfigers
Still bigga for my kill niggas
Fuck wit my scratch I used to deal niggas

Tack the hot side and we be ridin smokin a twomp and a bag of bluntz

(equipto)

Handle on a daily baby lovin a baby lovin to gamble
Takin over on all these channels and save yo scrill

Interprize my weigh in all the homies Johnny Blazin
And tracin on my fashion when I rap I shine amazin
Its time for all the creep slow and like when we grow
I hit em consistent down to dirty and to bell below

(Andre Nickatina)

I brought welcomes to you funeral and flowers to your wife

And put together word for the street design

And know nothin now I keep lookin ???

( mac-10)

Look at me fucked like theres some other motherfucas in here

A lot of niggas that play the game ain't feelin the 10
But I bet you wanna fall off in the game you know im playin to win

Top rappin I make it happen cut off you ain't addapin
We laughin off the dank and walk the plank cuz he the captain
Break em off just like a fraction can't slip equipt traction
We passin the doger get any closer and im mashin
Quadrople up my tatches we blowin like a saxes
With a status that never would of happened without practice
I hold it to the sky berry still gettin by my life until I die
Ignorin all your replies like

(Andre Nickatina)
Broken feathers keep together hot cold any kind of weather
Pay a ho no never...she can't hit it ain't I clever
Stuck you like the convict especially when the bong hits
Lettin ya know yo how mad shere khan gets
Put you in the basket ya motherfuckin bastard
Shut you like elastic hit you with the tragic
Do it like its magic watch the way I bag it
Shake it up like shake and bake with raps I make
