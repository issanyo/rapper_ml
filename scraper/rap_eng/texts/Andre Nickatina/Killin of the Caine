(Dre Dog)
Step into the mind of a visionary vocalist
Focus this, picture this I'm 6 foot 6
Ready for the battle like Desert Storm
Feel the welts on yo body from the extension cord
Got you sweatin like a dancer
Stress and gave you cancer
Nigga you the wide receiver foo I'm Deion Sanders
Prime Time niggas get turned like a channel
Coke is this, fuck a bitch from Detroit to Seattle
Indo got niggas thinkin fuckas wanna stop me
Mothafuckas missin teeth boxin like hockey
Rabbit, I'm not a kid but you can get the Trix
You better have been sleepin cause I'm slammin Big Six
BAM! Get the smellin salts he's unconscious!
Tryin to go head up but juss can't stop this
Treat me like a red but nigga don't push me
Cause once my vocals hit the beat it's good like pussy

Killa!
Nigga?
It's the Killin of the Caine
Motha-fucka

(Dre Dog)
You live in a shell like a snail
Moby Dick ass niggas get harpooned like a whale
Not a killa (??doin niggarail??)
Fuckin with the pinnacle
Wishin for a miracle
Situation Critical
Lay it down, you betta expect the worst
All screamin like a pregnant woman about to give brth
In a taxi, now ask me, do you think I'm bluffin?
I bet I got you listenin to me juss like I'm E.F. Huttin
Or somethin, you fuckas gonna all have to learn
Favorite boxer Tyson, second Tommy Hearns
Hut hut hike!
I'm runnin from the whites (who's that?)
Cause 5-0 they only thing they see is my nikes
But check this out imagine prison under the ground
Escapers at 0 and you can't hear a sound
Fuck you man Scarface Al Pacino
I'm coo tryin to get some good pussy up in Reno
A key! Stolen from a druglord G!
That means niggas gonna die for a fat fee
The lick went sour, a rat of the name
The dope got my life, the Killin of the Caine

(Dre Dog talking)
Run for cover (right)
Yeah (no)
Nigga (nigga)
Mothafucka (mothafucka)
It's the Killin of the Caine
