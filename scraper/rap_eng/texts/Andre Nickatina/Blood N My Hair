[Woman:] Only maybe, maybe it could be different, this time. If we try
[Man:] I've never seen a guy that could get away with it yet

[Intro sample]

Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
No angels guide me, I seem to be lost
Spittin a rhyme from devious ways
All in the veins them freaks they get paid
The path was laid, the bed was set
Nicky the cat from the fillmoe 'jecks
Here go the steelo it ain't that odd
Khan, money, clothes, broads
Don't forget weed and rap for the gods
Pages that rewrite the Holy Quran
Man I've been swervin since Julius Erving
Ready to rap now so open the curtain
Don't be in the lab when I'm doin bad
Pencils and pads they turn to cash
This how I mash
Driving so fast
Shoes say WU! when I step on the gas
Baby is mad
Man she got ass
I looked and gave her my gangsta laugh
My pedigree, my legacy
I sell it like amphetamines
They told me at the dinner scene
And I'm standing there high in my anchor jeans
Gangstas, hustlers, hoes and all
Feel the pain when a rapper falls
Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
No angels guide me, I seem to be lost

[Muhammad Ali:] I'm Dancing! Follow me chump! No I'm not there, I'm here! Sucka you ain't got nothin'!

It's mighty extreme to being a king
Looking for people to be on the team
How much money it cost to cheat
To slow ya down and be drug free
With Kenneth Cole boots and Sean John suits
And execution that top of the roof
Who got the juice
Show me some proof
The curse of the rhyme give me the loot
Awake like an owl and drinkin' some tea
Watchin' fights of Muhammad Ali
Dodgin' death with every step
This is my rep, give me the checks
Like Snagglepuss I'll step to the left
With this freak, with that quiet as kept
My philosophy is the boss of me
Pass the hot sauce to me
You need diamonds and pearls to floss with me
I stand there with none
Hot as a gun
The sound of the noise will make you run
Move from the slugs that will rip your lungs
Look in the eyes of the greediest god
Rollin the streets with the Caddie Passat
Cut through the rain like ninja blades
The batter ram explain the rage
I got my game from project floors
Weed, dope, and dice by the door
Crush anything that'll cause a threat
Talk to the bookie secure the bet
Never with leniency he won't agree with me
Gettin' all mad when I make the call
Gangstas, hustlers, hoes and all
Feel the pain when a rapper falls
Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
No angels guide me, I seem to be lost
