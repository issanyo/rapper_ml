[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
Ooo it's all good in my hood when I plot
You fools can't stop, the fuck it, 'caine snorting juggernaut
The new Jim Jones never fakin' it
Put my hand around your neck and end up breakin' it
Just  like the Son of Sam, I can get the devil out
I'm swelling eyes, busting mouths and ripping throats out
Cause niggas hate me and my dick they wanna boil it
But I'm stopping niggas up like a toilet
Gimme a scent mutha fucka I'll find it
Then soak niggas like a mutha fuckin hydrant
The shape shift got me trippin' through with no remorse
I walk out, but I'd have done a fuckin' corpse
Dre Dog'll eat a steak I can't fuck with pork
I walk around and sport a beanie with a pitchfork
And don't get mad cause I'm a reverend and I smoke dope
If it was cool ???fuckin joes??? I'd beat a dead pope
A lot of fools wanna fight me (so what)
But I gives a damn if nobody likes me
So don't slip mutha fucka don't you go to sleep
I break your jaw and have you choking on your wisdom teeth
I could never be a bitch nigga how that look?
I got niggas in my closet hung on meat hooks
So get big and I'm the nigga fool and that's forealla
Straight up walkin' assassin, Fillmo' killa

[Hook]
Creep with me as I crawl through the hood
Deep in my eyes as I walk as I creep
Creep with me as I crawl through the hood
It's D, I'm the number on assassin
Creep with me as I crawl through the hood
The ultimate psycho, insane with a chainsaw
You have it, the mutha fuckas don't allow somethin

[Verse 2: Fly Mar]
I'm the nigga, that made push come to shove
Dumb nigga, whatchu thinkin' of?
I tried to put my whole city on the map
But niggas didn't feel that, they wanna peel my cap
On top of that niggas had to pimp hate
Tellin' everybody don't go by the nigga Tate
Huh, you heard what he said about us?
Man, I'm booked as fuck and I'm on the bus, yo
But I'mma get recognized one way
Either on the news or the front page
So I'm back and I'm causing lots of drama
I'm killing niggas but first I'm killing niggas mamas
To make em feel what I done felt
The Fly Mar nigga ain't playing with a full deck
I got plans to jacking planes in the Bahamas
And I'm doing this sick shit in my pajamas
Cause I been up since 9 and murder's on my mind
So I'm sleepwalking, like Frankenstein
So if you see me you better run from me
Cause I'm strapped up plain wrapped up like a mummy
Dummy, ain't a damn thing funny
I wanna jack loot but it ain't for money
It's the thrill of killin' a mutha fucka
Cause I'm sick and tired of being played like a sucker
I snatched a nigga eyes out, and flipped him upside down
Squeeze his body till a puddle of blood fell on the ground
Now I gotta get iller, you know
That's why the caravan going to a funeral
Perfect day for a 93 massacre
I'm about the make the hearse drive and join the passenger
And I could a give up for these kids in the mob
Because I'm assassinating like Lee Harvey Oswald
Get a mother fucker that killed Kennedy
So next time you hear Fly Mar you'll remember me
I'm killing mutha fuckas with a passion
Fly Mar is the walkin' assassin

[Verse 3: ADR Lavey (of Triple 6)]

Back once again, I’m the Son of the Devil
The Walkin' Assassain, Now I’m on the next level
Death approached me and tried to take me, I made him a deal-take this innocent little baby
Fuck it, he ain't seen much- when you speak of the devil I come threw in the clutch
I Practice black magic with a death curse, I got triple gold Daton’s on a pearl black hearse
Dropped to the ground with tinted glass, throwin' up gang signs packin my tear gas
Jump in the hearse lets take a ride, till we head to the spot we jump out and do a walk by
Got to the spot in the hearse
I'ma smoke my ex bitch, if Phil doesn't kill her first
Ready to fly, and ready to do this-because that stupid bitch was the next on the hitlist
I'm kickin down the door screamin' “Kill that bitch!”
You shouldn't have fucked with The sick Triple 6
I Let off the tear gas and set up the smoke screen, right at the back door and set up the guillotine
The bitch was inside so we kicked in the door, We let off a shot, screamin, “All you mutha fuckers on the floor!”
They know I’m crazy cause my eyes is glowin' red, you run for the door you’ll take two to the head
Her mother ran anyway right out the back, the guillotine’s quick, slice her dead in the fuckin' back!
Bitch!, now she’s layin' their half-dead, grabbed my knife and carved sixes in her forehead
Back in the house so I can finish the job, kill off her family-Hail to the street mob
Chopped up the bodies and took they life
Close my eyes and licked the blood off the knife - Set the bodies on fire, startin' from the neck, watchin the face melt, I’m sittin' in a cold sweat
The bodies are gone they don’t exist, you can't fuck with ADR the Satanist!
THE WALKING ASSASSIN....

[Verse 4: Fela Phil]

I gotta a deathwish standing in the graveyard im hollaring at the moon
Theirs gonna be a death soon
And i can't stand it
A mothafucking bandit
Feelin kinda free
Let me im on a killing spree
Fir up the chainsaw
Ready to go around
Life is a gamble i knew you couldn't handle a mothafuckin vandle
Fuck its the holocaust money is my green
Transform im a terrorist
Walking in my dead sleep,when your on my contract
Steam rolling heavy,moving steady here i go
Fine with the suicide,front row,siting in the beginning
At a funeral,bone crusher as im ready to move through the room
Sharp like a razor blade,step into the casket,will i get blasted
Heat from the underground caught u in the conflict
Life has a rice get it right i call assassins
Killa get the job done murder one deadline
Aiming for my target time to eliminate far from the hit zone
Take it from a vet slice'em to neck
Put his motha fuckin ass in check
So the bell ring and the quad sing,the walking assasins


Theirs going to be a funeral you bastard without yo head in the mothafukin casket

(finally fuckin done with this song!!!)
