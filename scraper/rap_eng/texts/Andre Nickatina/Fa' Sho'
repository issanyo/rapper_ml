(Nickatina)
It started out with Captain Crunch Cereal, an old turn table and a radio
In my young mind i was the mother fuckin' Imperial
Local drug dealers would say "Nicky i like your style keep doing it"
And i would look at them like what im doing? but im gonna do it fa show
Blowin weed while others was blowing out 16 candles
Happy birthday to you as i took plane rides to seattle
See i was born on the coldest day of the year march 11th
And god told me i ain't putin a foot up in heaven, cold world
Ho how you gonna be a player with no girl?
Shirly temples in the club, had a fight, now no curls
If i gotta mack a dyke, rap a lie, give me the night that there freak im gonna get a peice of the pie, and won't cry
Certain things make me shiver, like the coldest rap, when the money is delivered

(Equipto)
Nigga..hah! swisha! i hit the weed, kick the beat, equipto to the nicky T, history predict the picky cuz strickly my swisha sweet officially done
Running this thing, quicker then many
110% put it or you won't see a penny
Now as we construct the thought of
To droppin the product in ever country we brought up in world widely acknowledged
All the MC's is polished dippin all in they stack
And they astonished cuz the game will treat em just like that while droppin a rap
Gettin contact and keepin em waiting
Off from frisco to my homie copenhagen

(andre)
Like canadian bacon you know im makin a way
For me to get like on every plate, in every state
Rap up hoes down, 12th floor at the tyson fight with money on every round
My operations stacked all off, rhymed cola
Its something like the '84 china white crime yola
At hot rap shows the parking lots are packed with cars that will make hoes faint
You'll get a cavity from the candy paint
It's just like i increased the crime rate
Bump this with rapid fire is something you're about to create
If you ever ask me for cream ima give you a dollar for baskin robins
Sometimes i still stay at partys even tho they ain't poppin'
Whatchu copin? he said the 2002 mercedes bens e-class
How you payin? ehh i dunno all cash..?

(equipto)
Im on the dash, light my blunt like the last
There ain't no match that'll really get attatched
To any fast talkin blast-takin, slip and get slapped
In the mouth, laugh, jaw-jabberin'
Flash over the cash, staggerin in with class, badgerin plastic acts
Spinnin the greedy, better take the stee-v wonder?
No fucken tv if you've seen me then leave me
On the under, bundled and beanied, frisco eskimo all on the freezy
Constantly maken moves to move the cd, daily and weekly

(andre)
In my world, im runnin' like boss hog
And i love when the goody-goody's break my laws
Around the clock with a knot like the ATF
Oh yeah, the ATF dont knock, nigga's cock-block
Like a line-backer i love to change my young daughters pampers
Puttin on huggies, i won't be old pushin' a buggy
Im good partners with all 40 of ali baba's theives
Baby dont act dumb, im number 41, highstepper
Togo sandwich with the hot peppers
At 90 degrees i might freeze, so when its hot i sport leather
Kill pretty, you lookin at the smartest motherfucker ever to get seven f's
The rap gods told the mack gods bury him like king tut when he's over
Wrap him like a mummy, surrounded by his money
Lifestyle real chewy and real gummy
Local drugdealers would say nicky i like your style keep doin it
And i would look back at them and be like what im doin?
But ima do it fa show.... ya know
