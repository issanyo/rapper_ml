Tell you a little something about dat nigga
Tell you a little something about my nigga
And Imma tell you something about dem niggas

Fa shizzle (my nigga)

I remember bein 8 wit dat nigga
The knees I scrapped with dat nigga
And when I got hungry
When down on Haight wit dat nigga
In stored taste wit dat nigga
And then prayed with dat nigga
And got it straight with dat nigga
I saw my fate wit dat nigga
Learned how to hate wit dat nigga

I became great wit dat nigga
I hung out late wit dat nigga
Made my pace wit dat nigga
When shit popped off
Evacuate wit dat nigga… shit

It's a dirty game

I went to school wit my nigga
I played hoop wit my nigga
Got a loot wit my nigga

Is this me or you my nigga
Copped bitches, blue my nigga
'cause I'm true to my nigga
I came ?? wit my nigga
Always on cue wit my nigga

When it was who, my nigga

And when we needed some blunts

You see I'm cool with my nigga
Would know what to do wit my nigga
What you wanna do my nigga
Be up till two wit my nigga

Type of shit I do wit my nigga
Type of shit we deal wit dem niggas

So I got the book from my nigga
The shit I took from my nigga
The hoes I shook wit my nigga

You should meet dat nigga
Get a bite to eat wit dat nigga
Make a beat wit dat nigga
And hit the street wit dat nigga
'cause im hella cool wit dat nigga

Done major shit wit dat nigga
And I just can't quit my nigga

Always on the go wit dem niggas
A lifetime both wit dem niggas

Shit gets deep
Real deep
Like the eyes of Minolta

It's a 430 game
An S-430 game
Let it fade on out
