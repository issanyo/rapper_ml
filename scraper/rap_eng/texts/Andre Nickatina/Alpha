Verse 1 [Nickatina]
Man, check this out
This a four four
I don't care and I don't know
Man, Repo is lookin' for you on a car note
I hit the freeway, lap top, speedway
Don't ask my bout a bitch, I probably sold her on Ebay
My problem, the Jordans with the red bottoms
Or the Hennessy that come in the black bottle
Wing stop
Man, lemon pepper ranch style
Yeah I owe you money but I'm not paying back now
Scroll up, who got something to roll up?
Blaze the lie, in the car, Nicky Panama
I think I run a mile
I'm gonna run amok
I'm going downtown
To get my numbers up
I gotta crack the bottle
It's dark as Sleep Hollow
And the weed's the same color as a avacado
I like the Benz model, the 550S
I like to spend cash
I never make it stretch
I'm such an addict
Paypa is a bad habit
Man, I'm such a gimme gimme
Man, I'm such a gotta have it
All cabbage, no salad, no spinach
I like the ones that stay up
And get it til' it's finished
I do a brain tease
Something like a brain freeze
Cuz I gotta keep so cold
Until you know it bring cheese
Get with it
Or get lost real quick
And I'm never callin' back
Blazin' ?? in the whip

Hook:
I'm a go go getter y'all [x4] (so cold)
That ayo, like ayo (I'm so cold, nigga)
I'm a go go getter y'all [x4]
That ayo, like ayo (go getta)

Delic!

Verse 2 [Kushadelic]
Kickin' back with Nicky
Tales of these boss niggas
Rockin' with these mob figgas
Couple, ya'll some go gettas
Everybody we know hear us
Banged up and head splittas
Hearing stories from real killas
On the block with dope dealers
When we sell that crinach
But now a nigga in that
Go and get this scrinach (scratch)
Moving up the trinach
Smoking on that alpaca
Yo where them hoes at?
It's third world not your world
Delic man I am that
All I here is do do do
In the hood it's do do do
With the programs and the government plans
They fuckin' me off, I'm gettin' my loot
But I will shoot, in my suit
Creased up and cuffed up
In a bow tie but a sucka try
And he will get fucked up
Woulda got up in my cut
Hennessy not syrup
I love sipping that cognac
With hella weed ta burn up
Man, I stay so turnt up
In the club, we turnt up
I'm balling like I'm Kaepernick
With the whole click if you run up

[Hook]
