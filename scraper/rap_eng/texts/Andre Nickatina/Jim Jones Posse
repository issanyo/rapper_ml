Radio dial searching the wicked tune.....
(Btw sounds samples of :
Rbl Posse - Sorta like Psycho
Spice 1 - 187 Proof
Mac Dre feat. Coolio Da Unda Dogg - California Livin')

Heheh
Yeah
C-Sinister, T-Cee
I'm ready to rock it

Fuck an intro
Here come a dog from the Fillmoe
Jim Jones of vinyl
Hitler of Frisco
Niggas can't understand how I rolls
Cause I wear dirty clothes and my hair ain't combed
But I'm Dre Dog
I lock and shake
Strike like a snake
Imma Reverend of hate
But some fools thought I was triple six
But I'm triple sick, and a red-nosed pit
So why would you think I'm the devil's kin?
I got teeth that'll penetrate nothin' but skin
And about Dre Dog, yeah, you know nothin
Fingernails will carve ya face like a pumpkin
And if you swing, fool, you better not miss
I got lyrics that'll start a fuckin' exorcist
Cause I was born to catch and kill
And watch niggas burn like the Oakland hills

Who wanna hear Dre Dog get wicked?
(The Niggas in the Jim Jones Posse!)
Who wanna hear Dre Dog get wicked?
(The Niggas in the Jim Jones Posse!)

Ooh, I say praise the Lord
Jim Jones just gotta have more
From the sex to the money to the sex right back to the money
And I still dress bummy
Nappy hair makes a pony tail
Nike boots and long fingernails
Fat lips and smooth goatee
6'5" fool, nigga that's me
So like Aretha I want respect
Cause what you see, fool, is what you get
And what you see, yeah is knuckles that's brass
I want your cash, Imma woop your ass
Pitiful, yous a catholic
And I will beat a nigga with glasses
Lock and shake on his fuckin face
Break a knife off into his waste
Cut his foot off for luck, yeah just like a rabbit
Dre Dog gotta have it


Who wanna hear Dre Dog get wicked?

Nigga I kick you in the face with my Nike boots
Who said that I wasn't 180 proof?
The reverend of hate got you by the roots, huh
Now nigga, who got juice?
And as you can see, I ain't heaven sent
24/7, I'm high or bent
Blowin blows in niggas face, cause I'm nothin polite
With a temper that the Devil wouldn't even like, so
Do me chewy as I sweep you with cocaine
My vocals bang, lyrics fall like acid rain
I bust a sweat, live and and cut throats
Buy cars, get hard, smoke dope!
Say Whatsup to Frisco's rudest
America's newest, Jim Jone's truest
Here's a smokin' reverend motha fucka
Thats out for the schemin'
A hip hop demon


Who wanna hear Dre Dog get wicked?
