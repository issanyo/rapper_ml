Mother of god
If you know me
You know I never liked the job
Hustle like rock, split keys from a pot
Outstanding demanding. Nigga deaths' a reality
Brainwashed brainwaves and money mentality
? Prido? python in a marathon of motherfuckin demos
Fuck white limos I'm dippin' buckets and rentals
Accidental I? Scall just one inch paper scam?
If I don't explain to me why I'm in your program
Swingin like a golfer or better yet a batter
Mad like a hatter, react like a badger
My first step over crossover remains just the same
So my formula on lockdown is motherfuckin game out frame
Da picture perfect bulldog glance, weird like a ming
FUCK PORKY PIG, remain like a tattoo on you and your crew

The things that I do, if mother only knew
Shit, Mother

Raised on chicken and watermelon
Catfish and snappers
Godfearing nigga under pressured gat clappers
Sportin' timbos smokin endo
Hanging out of my mazda rx-7 window, Fuck you!
Shit...
Heart poundin, don't nobody give a fuck about you bitch
Some mornings I sit eatin' bacon eggs and grits
Like a bee without honey, a tycoon without money
A rainy day that ain't sunny. A Joke that ain't funny!
Cocain deals. They shoot to kill, real motherfuckers...
Crack raider cluckers tommy tucker cluckers
Chewy smoker conisourres who wear beanies in da heat
I'll mannerd motherfuckers with da buck in da beat
Lips numb, ready to shoot a dick full of cum
Sticky but yet picky, chewin spearmint gum. Shit, mother

Stingy as a motherfucker don't ask me for shit
And even when I'm broke bitch my mindstate is rich
Because no doubt, no doubt I'm gonna have gear
Spin the same lane in a differnt motherfucking viggeree?
