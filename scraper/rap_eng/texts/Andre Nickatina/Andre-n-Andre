[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Backwoods got me congested ain't rested in two days
I'm gettin' paid, been on niggas head like toupées
I'm a thug, cuz, rob the blood out you gays
Cutthoat nigga, bitch, I scam 'em for days
On school days, I blew bays, got ripped and fucked up
In new J's on two-ways I scritched and scratched up
I beat that batch up when I found out she lyin'
Who she think I am, "Saving Private Ryan"?

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
I make ya town move just by walking on ya block
Take the keys to ya city but I still pick the lock
Buy a car and a Glock, put the cash in my socks
Put the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock
To hell with the law, the freeway's mines
So is your freak, radios and Alpines
Coke with a little bit of cherry lemon lime
Ya think of me ya think of big money every time
Candy coat shine like the trigger of a nine
Orca was a whale but Pisces is the sign

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I got split personalities, I'm bipolar
You might see me with my Italian stallion or my chola
Rap rock and rolla, I'm dope as yola
If you don't pimp her, I might like Dola
I'm riding in a big boat like Noah
With two women of each races, boy, I control her
A hoe, a hoe stable, I'm a mack and I'm ready
No dough, hoe? Debit—that's right I said it

[Verse 4: Andre Nickatina]
I grip my dollar bills like my Caddy steering wheel
I'm not a chill pill freak, do what you will
Heart ticking like a time bomb eating spicy prawns
Man, it's the god of Khan, check it baby, right or wrong
Man, look but don't stare, it's the crime rhyme king
With braids like a juvenile Khan, nahmean?
Went Bruce Springsteen in my Anchor Blue jeans
Oh yeah, I'm in ya city, man, what's up with the weed?
Man, call all the Gs, and tell 'em all freeze
Andre Nickatina sayin' 'nigga, what you need?'
Hit the corner so narrow in a fly blue Camaro
A sparrow dodge a arrow but not a double barrel

[Verse 5: Mac Dre]
We in a 7 Series Beamer, it's me and Nickatina
Ready to sexual harass a bitch like Martin did Gina
Committin' felonies and hella misdemeanors
A dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener
Rap singer, a pimp done slapped Tina
I mack Nina from Black to Latina
Clean as Noxzema, quick to pop the nina
Got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her
Wilhelmina, Tina and Trina, got dick by the bay on the Berkeley Marina
Don't mean to point the finger but uh
She got pancake, syrup and butter

[Verse 6: Andre Nickatina]
Man, the way I smoke weed it's like death of a genius
Reappear, roll up, rise like the phoenix
This is not a remix, Nino, Felix
Put it in a capsule, seal it, deal it
How you want it, Nicky baby? Four times five
A quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pie thighs
Excuse me if I'm greedy 'cause I'm caught up in the lust
I'd lie if you want but I'm a tiger you can trust
'Cause I'm on Fillmore in a white velour suit
In a blue Kangol, in my Wu-Tang boots
With a back like a cobra, cursed by the mail
My manicured nails touch a triple-beam scale
Baby is a athlete, body like a star
Ya talking real bad, freak, meet me by the car
