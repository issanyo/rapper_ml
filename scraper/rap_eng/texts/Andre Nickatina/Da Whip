[Verse 1: Andre NIckatina}
Sittin on leather thats all
Better than the cow that it came from
I like to go fast i like to blow hash
You like a women 'cause you way bad
The only thing I really give you is all your water and gas
You roll around the block
I let your voice knock
And other girls get jealous at the bus stop
Its like a party when we got to hit the car wash
I pancake you all up like I hop
And then I work on your voice at the beach shop
The work will see you come through when their knees knock
You ain't been with no body before
And i know because I got you off the show room floor
We don't double date wait we go dutch
Your automatic to me you I can never touch your clutch
The pictures are perfection when you see us roll up
I don't even have a freak out doing donuts
I grip the steering wheel like I grip a gang of paper
Baby got an attitude man from all scrapers
We bet against the lakers
Wake up all the neighbors
My whip is not a taxi we don't do favors
I said it if your skinny I said it if your thick
I just washed it don't scratch the whip
Don't scratch the whip

[Verse 2: Equipto]
Man don't scratch it
Less you got scratch to match it
Seen in zig zag through traffic
CAPRICE CLASSIC classic
Don't drive wreckless
Off the liquor you scratch the rims up
And knowing this pimps up hoes down
You smashing thru the whole town
And po po's say slow down
Everyday mash the gas like I just don't care
When I blow I ask the blunt any where
I'm a left lane ride to the next day
I pull a Houdini if I wanna escape
Roll like an ese still yell at whores
Don't scratch the whip bitch
This shit ain't yours
Came back off tour with your front in tore
I had to smash the rentel to the in store
Baby was sore on all fours
No mi amors
Don't scratch the whip bitch
This shit ain't yours

[Verse 3: Andre Nickatina}
Shit I wear shades in the car like i'm Stevie wonder
I drive like the days of thunder
Pass your numba
My whip ain't a closet lady
You all in the office baby
My hair is wavy
Is zap co going crazy
We submerge like the navy
When its me and her I don't even think about you baby
I'm sorry that it sounds so shady
This time me and my whip can forget the gravy
Hands out like you pay me
I party wit precision now
I got it wax something detail
Its sorta like a manicure a kim lee nails
Fine female even tho you need a key
Start you up and you coming home wit me
My whip

[Verse 4: Shag Nasty]
I wish a hoe would scratch my whip
Hell yea I'ma act up and start to trip
Some niggas might let you get away with that shit
But a mac like me would say bull shit
I'ma reach back like a pimp and bust a hoe lip
Cause I work too damn hard for this shit
Candy paint sticking rims like black diamonds
Coke white interior wood grains show my shining
In the trunk them 15's on the back
The shit cost g's now motherfucker can you buy that
I thinks not so you hoes better check yourself
For you fuck around and wreck yourself
Fucking wit a nigga whip could be hazardous to health
Get hurt quick and find your self by your self
Cause a friends ride is like a niggas best friend
You fucking with that you fuckin wit him
So don't do it
