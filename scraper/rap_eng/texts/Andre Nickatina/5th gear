[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
Fast lane baby
Ain't nothin' like it
Some play it cool, some get excited
Hit 5th gear and you might get indited
Spend all your cash tryin' to fight it
And how ya like it

[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
The Nickatina roll dice - shoot craps
A brand new rap means a brand new gat
Some rather sit around and snitch like rats
Ain't no tellin' where I'm at on the map
My Chuck Taylor's they stay laced divine
Look in the eyes of a rap cat laced with rhyme
And its a felony
And its a drought is what they tellin' me
In my mind yo that's a penalty
Man baby so mean she wear the apple bottom jeans
90 percent cream bumpin' the 15
Night time god parlay, blucka blucka
In the mix now ya cocksucka
I never leave it alone homes I love a big bank roll
In your face freak with plain clothes
Yea fly like a kite no cops in sight
Racin' through the city runnin' every red light
Drivin' like I hate my life
God of Khan in my vein and my brain ain't no wife
Night time god parlay, blucka blucka
In the mix now ya cocksucka
You get flavour like a skittle when I rip a rhyme riddle
Your face is in the pillow then I shoot it in the middle
Yeah 26 words in the alphabet
And I use all 26 to get this grip
Cause you can see me on the highway, the plane, the plane mein
Nickatina late for his flight again
With hot weather, hot leather, and hot cheddar
You bring the beats with the hot borettas
My souls controlled by the late Billy Holiday
Meaning that I'm strung out all the way
Rainy alarm with the charm of a nickel as barm
Then I sell you somethin' to shoot straight in your arm
Then get a plate, some duct tape, somewhere to bake
Some mayonnaise jars then give a little shake
I hope you got somethin' 4 pound on your waist
Because I drive like I don't have brakes
Cause its the

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Equipto]
Uh, you see I'm cold blooded
Gary Petters gold glovin'
Lovin' to play it cool but get heated like an oven
I bogart in barge in with all fairness
Ain't no turnin' back I burn a sack so careless
Sly just like stone
High all alone, glowin'
Rap crews oblivious all outta they zone
And I was told to treat em cold
I blow, hear the beat and flow
There's no need to tell a leader go
This is a rush we outspoken in the pimps discussion
Like N.W.A I'm always into somethin'
And I'mma rep it like a athlete
Out shine stampede
Rollin' with motha fuckas just doin' the damn thing
Livin' life too fast to catch it
But got it mastered down
Now get mad and lash out
Classic genuine rappin'
Watch the boy play
Can't escape the game the range is point blank

[Verse 3: Andre Nickatina]
When it come to cash yea man some might divide it
But when it come to me don't try it
God of Khan
Playboys ride toys on chrome
Baby you drunk, you need to go home
15 crankin out thug rug bone, first of the month, and roll another blunt
Tonight I got cranberry juice in my cup
You starin' at a rap cat freak, what up
Night time god parlay, blucka blucka
In the mix now ya cocksucka
Put on your seat belt need help
I'm about to go fast
No pictures mothafucka so don't even ask
Forget about the past
You better do the math
Freaks tryin' to put they dirty hands on the cash
More keys than a piano
You like to travel
Think all the fours that flows with the ammo
Retreat to the shadows fire in the battle
You might see me on your favourite news channel
2, 7 or maybe even 5
Money on my mind
You see it in my eyes
Talk so much shit I don't never have to lie
Unless it's to a judge
But then I gotta grudge
A game where there ain't no love
Money, cars, strip bars, and the hardest drugs
Night time god parlay, blucka blucka
In the mix now ya cocksucka
Night time god parlay
