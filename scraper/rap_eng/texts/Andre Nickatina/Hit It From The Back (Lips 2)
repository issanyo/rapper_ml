Hehehe, wussup, ooh, that's nice what you got on, I like that
Verse 1
Girl it's after 12 oclock and we over high
You lookin good enough to eat just like a slice of pie
And I can see I got you wet, you can't wait to fuck
But like the cherry that you are you're holdin back that lust
Yous a sexy little caramel in a see-through shirt
And Im a homie, lover, friend, ????? flirt
Won't you look into the mirror, baby, when you ride
And tell me how good it feels when Im inside
Cuz that doja got dreamin, your talkin got me fiendin
So keep on talkin babygirl cuz Ima have you creamin
Like ooh, yah, keep it right there
Grab my ass while I pull your hair
It don't stop, sexy you can have every drop
Now turn that body over girl so I can get on top
And be cool with the lips, rude with the lips
While the covers ride down my back and off my hips
And you can feel yourself about to cum and just can't wait
With them ooh Nick it feels so good looks on your face
And it's workin, the nipples on your titties just a-perkin
We ready to do some freaky shit it ain't no use in perpin
The red light is on, my hands stay on your hips
Orgasm too I thought you knew Im right back for the lips
And this is Dre
(Andre talking)
Hehehe, wussup, you didn't um, you didn't think I could cum like that did you
But um, check this out, I got something else for you
Verse 2
Im trying to keep you wet, Im trying to make you sweat
Im trying to let you know that baby, I ain't done yet
Lets continue with the freaky shit, let me know Im killin it
Hittin that body from front to back, holdin on to those caramel hips
Muah, ooh shit, it's something about your muffin girl that got your boy like lovin it
Because it's tight, it's nice, and it feels right
You said Im the best you ever had and you sure right
You sex fiend, caramel windows off like pumps
Legs on my shoulders I can feel myself about to nut
I slows it down, man I can't do that now
Big lips, a small waste, ass nice and round
So smack smack, I hit that booty from the back
You ask me do I like it but you already knowin that
Your muscles tighten up, you feel your second nut
You want it deeper now you tellin me to grab the butt
Now here comes mines, were racin for the same line
The person cums first they win like every time
Like ooh shit, I just shot out my soul
We sweatin like a race and barely got out all our clothes
That sexy dress, them high-heel pumps that don't dissect
Man call your boy I got your number and I got your back
Hehehe, it's like that, hit that booze
What's your name again, Im just fuckin with you
Hehehe, thank me, THANK ME
