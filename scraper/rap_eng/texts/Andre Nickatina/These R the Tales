I was riding in my chariot, with this freak named Harriet
She said my stick was ???, so she knew just where to bury it
This girl named Sequoia, she was from Illinois-a
I had to stuff her mouth with her teddy bear, cuz she made hella noise-a
This freak named Nikita Brown, I rode her like a merry-go-round
She got to telling all her friends, that it's a new king in town
I was on my way to Las Vegas when I bumped into Tessy
She said her nickname was Marvin, cuz when she had sex it got messy
This freak named Jenny Marquais, so you know I called her Butter
Cuz when it came to summer sundresses, she had ass like no other
The steak was always smothered, she was a freak under the covers
You should have seen my expression, lil' pimpin
When I got hit on by her mother
This young lady named Chanelle, she was fine as hell
But she was 26, and her son was already twelve
I was at this little assembly, when I chopped it up with Kimberly
Hit it, split it, man that freak said she'd love me for infinity
You should have seen the chemistry, I changed that freak's identity
Seen her at the movies with her man, and the bitch didn't wanna remember me
This girl named Chamere, she put diamonds in my ears
But she also tried to put these niggas on me when I slapped her at the pier
This girl named Cheryl Lynn, she had hella friends
So when I brought my friends and all her friends
Then that's when the party began
This girl named Savannah, she used to love to pout
But I used to say "Don't even trip, just stick this in your mouth"
This freak named Miranda, she thought I couldn't stand her
But yeah, I can stand ya, since I got your ass on camera
I was riding hard, like Humphrey Bogart, with this freak named Leah
Even though she was in the dark, no one could see her, get it?
This freak named Raquela, she worked at Pac Bell-a
She gave me the number to the pager, home, and cellular
She had a lovely smell-a, ass like ???
I was wet like a scuba diver from the sex, homeboy let me tell ya
Chrysler ???, with this chick named Darren
I was at the mall trying to buy some clothes, and she just kept on starin
And then came the flarin, she said she hated sharin
I said "I'm not your man, little freak, so I'm not really carin"
This gangsta's name was Dallion, she wore gold medallions
Every other month we'd take a flight, out to Staten Island
She kept a 9 on the dresser cuz she had dreams of hell
Even though we in the penthouse suite of a 5-star hotel
I rock and I rock well, that's what I told Gail
She's a conceited little fraternity freak, up there at Yale
Young tender named Divine, I bump in her Alpine
She was the type that looked so good, it was a motherfuckin crime
Took her from behind, led her to the ride
Baby didn't make it home till the sun was 'bout to rise
Kickin in with Corvette, baby had a Corvette
She used to come and get young Nickatina from off of the set
We strikes to the checks, she pick up her Lex
We hit Hotel Nico, you know what came next
I was payin my bill for cable, when I met up with Sable
Green eyes, it was a CEO, of a record label
But I didn't get to hit it, because I met with Bridget
She was Sable's secretary, that gave me head and digits
In the parking lot of a club one night, I ran into Kirby
Freak worked at a beauty shop, said some gangsta's tryin to serve me
Freak you ain't worthy, your gossip column is through
And if some cats is after me, I'm right here mackin on you
Had to pop the collar on my coat, rev up the vogue smoke
Looked her in the eyes and said "Yeah bitch, you're broke!"
This girl named ???, Lord she was dreamy
Met her at a pool party, should have seen her bikini
This lady's name was Val, her husband was my pal
She offered me to put in why he stressed the ?rikers out?
Gave the freak a smile, said "It ain't my style"
I've known the homie for a while yo, and that would be foul
Fired up the weed, me and Saint Jean
We first had locked eyes yo, when we were thirteen
Kissed at 15, sexed at sixteen
That's why she's with me right now in the Beam, Tiga!
