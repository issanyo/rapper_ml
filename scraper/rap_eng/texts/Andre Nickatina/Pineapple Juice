Man that Hennessey and pineapple juice
Made that little bad bitch get loose
And oh yeah
It's a Fillmore drink
Bitch whatcha think?
I'm about sheer Khan and big bank

(2x)

Ya best holla back
The playboy with the cognac
You're right here
So who cares where your man is at?
If I was a singer
I'd prolly be El DeBarge
And just for you to hear my voice
Bitch I gotsta charge (yeah)
Mixed tape style
All in your face now
You're with me so you don't have to wait now
I triple beam scale priced my thoughts
I might buy something bitch
And don't check the cost (yeah)
In a plane flight
Ten after midnight
You gotta go to work bitch
Then Goodnight
Cuz there's playboys here
That don't play around here
And this is what we say around here

Man that Hennessey and pineapple juice
Made that little bad bitch get loose
And oh yeah
It's a Fillmore drink
Bitch whatcha think?
I'm about sheer Khan and big bank (2x)

I'm a loaded gun
I might bust if you try to run
Cuz y'all run right back to the ism
Prism
I turn around in my Makeveli hat
I'm something like a cat
I do it for the scratch
Ain't no games like
The Price Is Right
Bob Barker won't be seen tonight
Unless he does like the rest of em
By appointment you can undress the bum
You gotta 24 Karat chain around your waist
Don't get out of pocket
Cuz it's not your place
You make a dope fiend go from rock to base
And when you come back home
This is what you'll taste

Man that Hennessey and pineapple juice
Made that little bad bitch get loose
And oh yeah
It's a Fillmore drink
Bitch whatcha think?
I'm about sheer Khan and big bank

(2x)

Bitch by the way
You like to walk like a runway
And I bring out the Benz
All day on Sunday
Man it's something like gun play
Glock Tawk
And you try to walk your ass up a one way
And my mouthpiece tell you all about me
I like it when a broke bitch try to doubt me
My manicured nails
They like to touch mail
My clientele like to rent out hotels
No decoys here
Just playboys
And we ride around in cars that we call toys
Supa bad dime
Get a lemon lime
Get my drink and don't stand in line

Man that Hennessey and pineapple juice
Made that little bad bitch get loose
And oh yeah
It's a Fillmore drink
Bitch whatcha think?
I'm about sheer Khan and big bank
