[Andre Nickatina]
I tried to earn wings but I think I grew horns
And maybe thats why mc's watch me like porn
Flowin like the water in the mississippi river
I suppose it grows in the hennessey sipper, thank me
To do a show, and we trying to do a palace, like a midnight jet
My soul roams off to dallas
Its somethin like cream when we hustle on the scene
Other mc's and freaks wanna join the team
Dealers would fly, ride the engines of pimps
The colors were candy-coated, incredible rims
And my dreams of what people saying, dont get a job
I realize now it was all the rap gods
I slither through the streets like a boa constricter
On my car dashboard got the gangsta pictures
Sporting leather and energy, could that be me?
Smoking weed listenin to Run DMC?
My repute as a rap child, emotions of steel
Represent with no crew man, your life is sealed
Attitudes of all kinds, with guns to present 'em
C-notes don't last long, we can't wait to spend 'em
Hoes, cars, and bars, weed, greed, and clothes
Maintain my woman, clown the rest of these hoes
Man, my festive up braid the truth of a rhyme
After resting on jeopardy to my lifetime grind
Im like an angel thats high smoking weed up in heaven
We're as crooked as reverends, b-ball playground legends
Triangle, some say Cincinnati Bangles
Star-spangled, hand cold as Chris Krangle
We break hearts, and crack rif rafs
Take trips far, shop at the Gap
Taught by the rap gods to shoot the gift
So I blessed it with some weed, bacon, eggs and grits
I can block the sun, like a solar eclipse
My homie said he had a yacht
But I don't mess with ships
The freak said she hated dope dealers, they clock they ends
I said which is why your paying this rapper then
Nickatina, I'm something like Sinbad the sailor
Dressed in grey and black
The true signs of a raider
