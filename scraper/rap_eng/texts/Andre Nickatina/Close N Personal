Yeah
Its frisco's finest
And see it as a priviledge when quipto rhymin
If ya ( look in my eyes ) you can see that they slanted
My sly samarai chopp you down with a hatchet
You can ( look at me ) and see Q in the flesh
Just boss like rammy moss boy and move to the west
You can ( look in my eyes) andyou can tell where they rest
We blessed, the best weed goin straight to your chest
C'mon ( look at me ) as a real mc, just know that im explosive like tnt
Cuz u can ( look in my eyes ) and they like red as the sea
But still i stay two steps ahead of your freaks
Just ( look at me ) im still standing here living proof
