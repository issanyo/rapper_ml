[Verse 1:]
In tha blink of an eye
Ya know your tiga can die
I'm from the land of the 22 44 45
Riddels and lies is something we all despise
So we look to the sky for the answer to "why? "
We was just little tigaz when we first tried
You chose the d-game and I chose the ryhme
Though our brains were the same man
Our brains had to change man
Cause if it didn't change we'd be stuck in the game

[Chorus:]
Man the game tryin to outsmart tha law
Sweatin over a stove tryin to cook the raw
Off the showroom floor is how you buy yo car
And you'll have da baddest bitch these niggas ever saw
In the game tryin to outsmart tha law
Sweatin over a stove tryin to cook the raw
Off the showroom floor is how you buy yo car
And you'll have da baddest bitch these niggas ever saw

[Verse 2:]
It was 7-4 I mean july the 4th
And I was going on tour and you was going to war
Dope fiends checks a new lex and kill techs
Before I had to jet I told the god I'm impressed
He said check it out nicky I'm killing the world
My woman is a top notch got my brain in a twirl
Hella niggas done hit it and I call her my girl
And my mama looks at me like I'm not her pearl
I go to sleep every night with a body on my mind
Man slugz from the nine you shoulda seen how he died
Bullets hit his chest I thought I would laugh
Man I've been thinkin about it fo 2 yearz and a half
That mothafucker died is all on my mind
Check this out will we go to heaven this time?
In the game
It's ashame
A nigga like me gotta sale cocaine

[Chorus:]
In the game tryin to outsmart tha law
Sweatin over a stove tryin to cook the raw
Off the showroom floor is how you buy yo car
And you'll have da baddest bitch these niggas ever saw
In the game tryin to outsmart tha law
Sweatin over a stove tryin to cook the raw
Off the showroom floor is how you buy yo car
And you'll have da baddest bitch these niggas ever saw
In tha game...
