[Andre Nickatina]
I'm from the era of Ronald Reagan
And from my dress code and my style tyga yea you know what im slangin'
Valentine heart shooter
Pinky nail for real and can't ya tell ain't nobody cuter

A pitbull terrier carries in ya area
And he really ain't sharin ya

Add a two door straight pirrhana
I keep it sparked like a rear end six-four of an impalla
Skinny baby done dollar
And when I rip theese raps to gat ya back it ain't no prada
Nicky is a matador
Yo whatchu give it for
Its like rain when the money pour

Hey a pitbull terrier carries in ya area
And he really ain't sharin ya

I keep it dark as darth vader
I keep it cold as cream to make ya gleam with thirty one flavors
Three bullets just grazed ya
And I can't believe we smokin weed the streets done raised ya
It was the ultimate caper
And as the year pass I fear we talk about paper

Pitbull terrier carries in ya area
And he really ain't sharin ya

[Equipto]
Ya see I step through whats up to all my nephews
I'm leavin' the suckas to super heros for the rescue
And every attitude in the grill like respect do we crept through
Its been a long time we shouldn't have left you
Ima locate ya spot ima go steak the block
Its nation wide knowin ima rotate the clock
Around timing rebudle and make it seem so drastic
Visual havin feel its no longer lasting
Start the rhyme shootin computin with many brains
No time for tootn' make a comback like eddy caine
Never cross game or point with steady aim
I put it so simple in the crookedest way
Ima brain wave, over-take, maintain, no mistake
Dont give a fuck I ain't gonna wait
Knowin theres more to make
Its weaker when you know when its right
I hold the mic with confidence like rollin the dice

[Andre Nickatina]
Sometimes im lucky as luciano
And I collect little things like ships thats made in the bottle
Block monster ass steak
Butterflys surround my waiste I shake but still beat the case
Laid out like a bear rug
Beacause the way I sqeeze to make this cheese is somthin like a bear hug
Man I ain't never met a fair thug
Baby you with me or not cause you know I dont share love
I kick back in the twilight
Man thats the wicked little brother of the thang we call the limelite
I switch lanes in the fast life
And this psycic said I was king tut in my past life
I looked at her like "thats right" yeah
Respect the law the star born to break the law
Machine gun alibi, its like a lullaby
We smoke weed and we dont cry

Hey! a pitbull terrier carries in ya area
And he really ain't sharin ya...
