I can't remember the day
But I remember the night
The first time in my life
Had an mc fight
Caterpilla killa lyrics spit like venom
Only thang my mind said was nigga go and get em
I ducked and bust
And started cussing at them maggots
Niggas started pulling fresh rhymes out the cabinet
My flow got quicker like Machine Gun Kelly
Some MCs got hit even though they wasn't ready
Watch me wrap you up like a boa constrictor
And pose like a pimp in your girl's prom picture
I watched MCs die like soldiers in war
Everybody for themself so there ain't no score
This nigga bust a verse that he didn't rehearse
And got snatched from the earth like an old lady's purse
The freestyle had mothafuckas on their backs
But felt the attack from the gangsta rap
Last breath of an MC

I hit the weed like a champ as I let raps fly
And best believe when I die
Man in my mind I'll be high
I saw old MCs thati had wounded bad
And if I slipped I could tell
They would take they chance
So like Rambo 1 man I drew first blood
And hit em in the neck with two rap slugs
MCs brought gats and bats one had an axe
Before he took a swack man I got him in the back
With pimp game rhyme
The moneys all mines
12 o'clock midnight me and him bond
MC females they slipped in and heard
Before they got close man I put em on the curb
With 'em lookin'
You see my vocal box start cookin'
Screams were heard from frisco down to Brooklyn
I dont do it for the fun cause I'm a MC rival
Fuck if you a champion I dont want your title
Last breath of an MC Feel me

A 12 gauge stage
Displayed wit all rage
Bet yo last dollar it will make front page
It lasted all night
MCs filled the block
Some dead with they eyes open
Rap shell-shocked
Hip hop was left-handed
He packed two gats
Just in case he ran into gangsta rap
Bodies lay some hurt
Still trying to get away
But if they get away
They will return another day
But I kill em
Hit em with just enough venom
Eyes wide open until the cops come and get em
I pause, my dialogue attempt to catch my breath
But before I knew it a rhyme had penetrated my vest
Caught off guard by an MC flow oh no
My mind start to click like a black fo-fo
Rapid repeated rhymes that went for his throat
And after he died I spit raps at his ghost
Man I'm hurt
I can see the cops start to lurk
I hit one with a rap
That had 'em squirmin' in the dirt
I start to Hurl I think about my old girl
Baby you had the best pussy in the world
I felt my heart start to collapse
I'mma hate to leave the game like that
I felt another rhyme dig deep into my spine
Just when I was about to hit a pig with another line
I'll see ya next time
Last breath of an MC
