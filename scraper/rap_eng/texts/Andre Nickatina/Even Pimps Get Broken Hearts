Even pimps get broken hearts
I spark the line stay trivia
Blow you to oblivia
To give me, a
Semi auto with led
Keep a rap in my head like ruboys keep a lock full of dreads
Twist like a tornado the fatal cuban jewel
Run around the world saying gangsta rap rules
Give an F finger to the flyest freak
While im sitting right there in the drivers seat
Smoke a blunt for the gods at the crack of dawn
I think them rings that I stole im bout ready to pawn
Because I grin like a P-2 10 a sun lock
Rapper of the cats got Glocks on cock
Walk like a rat when it comes to the cheddar
And in any kind of weather with the 3 quarter leather
The lethal injection with the chinese connection
First we amp up
Then we vamp up
Watch them other muthafuckas all clamp up
Baby talk to much ricky shut the tramp up
I enter through the back door exit through the front
We don't jock bitches, tiga fire up the blunt
Heat up ya chest like yukon jack
Work ya credit card the first day to the max
The 5 millimeter
Nickatina
Street cleaner
I bounce back and forth from fillmo to korea
The chronic chokin rap child bustin it loud
I stand still while i'll rap trying to move the crowd
In my koneiact lounge position
Bullet shots rang right before in the mision
Muthafuckas thought andre was going to listen
But my detroit roots told me hit em with the piston
Rip the compositions
What was yo intention?
No gratitude just attitude
Bangin like mission
Kill doja
I thought I told ya
I sports leather while you wear summer clothesa
My boss theme
Andre going to get you back
Yeah I rap but the streets is where my heart is at
And my crudentials
No insturmentals
Im like a bullet in ya face right through the window
What!
The proof is in the fudge, money, raps and drugs
Nigga keep your hugs
Nigga keep ya love
Billie Holiday just crossed my mind
Everything she sang was right on time
I can tell in my soul I was just her kind
Cause I can see a better life when I close my eyes
