As I'm gone bitten knittin, it's too much space
I'm bustin out the seams in your motherfuckin place
Got to dwell, oh well, My DT crew gets wrecked
I live my last days as if my last breath
All you player hatin mother fuckers challenge our balance
Tricks try to get with Lo-Lo regs and scallion
Now can dre my dog make up the DT bitch
So whatcha watch cause we gettin rich
Can i kick it with my lo-dog
Fill my heart you got the blunt i got the boones
For alls yalls so let me break it down like this
And if you ain't my folks dont ask me for shit
Biyotch!
I runs my flows like carl lewis, you blew it
Tried to step to the scene as though you knew it
And now
I'm zippin through the air waves
My gift of gab was given to me in my younger days
A bye bye to my alarmin
And could you refrain from please squeezin the charmin
Nigga, cause you got none and you get stunned
When i bluckha-bluckha to your motherfuckin dome
Then my crew played the Glock Glock Glock
So let me bust this shit without the hassle, non stop
Smokin fools like a mother fuckin blunt dre gave me
And all you niggas talkin bout save me
Chumpin
Say a ho oh no
You fuckin wit that DT L-O L-O
You should know that Lo-Lo when im felon
Im wellin in my heart i'd obey with my nigga dre
Biyotch
Is that how you're comin, well um
This is your boy dre
You boy comin like this
Nigga you worser than being a gay son
Im a pimp you better roll a 20 sack and dont think you can skimp
So if you got a glass jaw yous a caterpillar
So im a kick fucks like d treating niggas motherfucka
You dirty like the New York subway
T-run you little cunt you be good as me one day Not
I respect you like a racist white cop
So check the plastic Glock thats dropped in my sock
Cause feelin like the soul train
You knock me off the track
Terminator couldn't sing it better I'll be back
Fuck that
I dont forget and will not forgive
And dont give a fuck if you die your alive
As i laugh and stretch your neck like an african giraffe
Like a do-do a sexy ho, im all up in your ass
Then its actual im always in jeans lookin casual
Fuck being nationwide fool im international
Like anywhere i fits in and niggas i been blessed
Cause where i gets in i fits like a sun dress
On a 21 year old butterscotch if i have to freaknic
Da pussy'll have to fluff em up wantin me to freak this
Table,this hippo,Lo-Lo get the boones
And we're going to fuck every pussy hole in the room
They ain't my folks
Creamin in their motherfuckin face
Im on the under well just have NIO
But i like west grand
An indo joint burns in my hand
You should have left before i thought, you had your chance
You think the shit got squashed cause the shit got old
Now your from the state necked knocked out cold
Motherfucka

Ain't my folks, ain't my folks either
Nigga you need to stop bringin all those blunts in front of squeeze sometimes
Motherfucka
