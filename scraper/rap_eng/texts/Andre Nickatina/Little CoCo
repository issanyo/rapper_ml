[Verse 1]
I was the itty bitty cat
With the itty bitty bat
With the itty bitty gat
With the itty bitty rap
They like who not you?
I'm like Yeaah nigga me!
I only come around when niggas pay me
I love Bruce Lee with a cup of ice tea
Fully dressed smoking weed in a hot Jacuzzi

Little Coco x 3

[speaking}
A young tiga
Ride around on the left
Came out kickin' it live you know?
They was like "is that you Dre?"
I'm like yeeah nigga it's me
Whatsup?
Bruce Lee playing down at the St. Francis
Get your money nigga lets go!

[Verse 2]
Big bank in the fishtank
Sideways on the streets when I dip mayne
Drinkin' pineapple crush with a blunt, don't touch
Check it showin' my luck, with this girl named Nicky Punch, what?
Spare me your thoughts, pass the hot sauce
You don't know how much these shrimp cost!

Little CoCo x3

[speaking]
Yeah, these Tiger Prawns is the bomb, uh-huh
Add a little hot sauce here
I remember I used to reminisce in the cold
Ridin' through the city at 3 A.M you know?
Blow a lil' weed, watchin' my red deviled fish fight, all night
Right?

[Verse 3]
The homie baked his cake
The warden's like "wait!"
Cause' everything we do is like a dope case, yeahh!
Rippin' through The City at a fast pace, yeeah!
Tryna' make money fore' its too late, yeeah!!
Fall or rise, chicken tiger banzai
Livin' like the Jefferson's, piece of the pie

Little CoCo x 3

[speaking]
You remember George and Louise?
Yeah nigga, the Jefferson's, playboy
Get your bread like George was
Whippin' in the whip at a fast pace
So fast
Spittin' game with my homeboy Tony Banks
I can't wait

[Verse 4]
Kill the noise that you spittin' baby
Talkin' is for spectators
Fascinated by the brain and multiple game
Tryna' get you open way out of your frame
You dancin' with the devil when you mention my name
Like Caine and thangs, nigga buka bang bang!
I hope thats my lady when the fff- phone rangs

Little CoCo x 3

[speaking]
Whatsup?
Yeah
I'm comin
What you got
Im hungry
Your puddin' is like Yayyyyooo
Yeah, you gon' you kiss me on the back of the neck, twice?

[Verse 5]
Like a Ferris wheel
I get the fairest deals
Because I love long legs and the highest heels
I love a Coupe De Ville, and up a Sedan De Ville
And I kick it sometimes up in Vacaville
Girl relax and chill
We got weed for real
And would you please make sure them dranks don't spill?

Little CoCo x 3

[speaking]
You know?
I used to take the Caddy up the 707
Kick it up there at Funky Chicken record store with my man Chauncey
Eatin' on hot wings and lemonade
Ladies would walk in every 10 minutes man
It was all real proper man you should have seen it

[Verse 6]
You know we kick it hella wicked on a ticket to Atlanta
Mindstate thinkin' like a 60's Black Panther
Like Jo Jo Dancer
Baby what's the answer?
Your partna' is a libra, I'm a pisces youse' a cancer
Pranca! Thats my tiga from the five
They told me to park, and I put it in drive!
They told me tell the truth and a nigga straight lied!
I had 'em all twisted like a bag of curly fries!

Little CoCo 'til the end

[speaking]
Keepin' it live
And I'm keepin' it live
Twizzle it like a twizzla you know?
I represent all pisces!
