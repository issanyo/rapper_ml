[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]

Adidas was a tiger that worshipped drank
Stayed drunk but he moved straight pounds of dank
Sweet tobacco was his cousin and his freak Han Smith
Knew Adidas had clout, so they watched his grip
Reebok's a ex-cop
That moved to Bangkok
Moved back and had a plan on how to move coke rocks
Disappeared he was moving hella weight throughout the year
'Til a deal went bad
He hid that ass
And shot off his right ear
Kenneth Cole was a baller in the Dublin Hills
He loved when fine women kissed
That was his main thrill
He owned a club
He taught Adidas how to sell bud
His license plate read on the Lexus: "NoLove"
Stacy Adams was the brother of Tracy Adams
Who was doing time in Chino for gat n' nap(?)
It was a twist
Tracy used to fuck with K-Swiss
He used to fuck with Kenneth Cole way back in '86
Trace fell in love
Stacy said the freak was on drugs
She done licked hella nuts of my tennis shoe thugs
Up on his bump was a tiger named All-Star Chuck
Who used to drink 7-Up
And used to love when guns bust
With no fear
Face full of tattooed deer
Reebok didn't know it, Chuck shot off his ear
Now Nike was a pisces with first-of-kin
Who had a wife that packed a knife name Timberland
That was important
They always was the first with the Jordans
Clothes and cologne be the shit that they be sportin'
K-Swiss was a bitch that made bread breeding pits
Fine ass bitch that snorted hop and shit
But Stacy stay(?) made sure that her shoes was always late
Loved to fuck to Al Green and loved the watch Scarface
With Fila
Now he was a tennis shoe pimp
Said he played high school basketball like Shawn Kemp
But was fascinated and demonstrated macking at its finest
Gift of gab loved his (?) he the flyest
Here's the shocker
The motherfucker always act proper
With at least nine freaks down in Lady's Footlocker

[Verse 2: Shag Nasty]
Now Mr. Adida just got out on a misdemeanor
Got caught up on a violation cause Pro said she seen him
Creepin' up out of Reebok's house
The same night he got robbed
And got his ass took out
Now it's a fucked up thing
Cause he got up with Reebok's rings
He said that he won them
From him in a dice game
So they had to acquit him
Because the bloody glove didn't fit him
A chance for Nike to bounce back like a real nigga
All he got to do was mention Pro
He never ever file again
And never make a trial again
That's when the bounce backs begin
Cause he swooped up little penny under him
And plus his girl was Timberland
She had the hook on they canes
And hooked him up with the NBA
Niggas Banging Association so now they straight paid
But ain't that a bitch
They bounced too quick
And Mr. Adida and Sweet Tobacco can't be having that
Shit, the next lick is to hit they shit
And take they shit
And leave them with they wigs split
While Mr. Fila kicking back like he all legit
Until somebody get took out
And him and Steeltoe will be running shit
