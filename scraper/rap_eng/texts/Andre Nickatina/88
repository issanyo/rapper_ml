Since 88' been slingin tapes like cakes
Consult with the real and stay away from the fakes
Told my nigga Mike-Mike, there's money to make
And hes been down here since 88'
Fakes and snakes infiltratin skeem
Crack is queen and Tiger, money is king
Man... My nigga spanky got a hell of a beam
Since 88' hes been a dream to fiends
From state to state I gotta sling these tapes
CDs to make so women masterbate
Educated niggas with ghetto fame
Famous for splittin up niggas brains
You reap what you sew when it comes to the game
Swift to the fifth and now you have no name
Since 88' dope is escalate
Niggas out-run cops that's over-weight
The 1st and 15th are sacred days
Money and hoes flipped are different ways
Weed is smoked at an alarmin rate
Prepare for an attitude at the start of the gate
Man... My minds on the money and my brain can't escape
So just like cakes man, I'm a sling these tapes

Since 88' man, there's been a race
Ears, they open wide when game is laced
Man... This sexy hoe, she got a hell of a face
So I'm a use her to fly tapes across the state
Prices dropped and they rise like yeast
No shows'll have a nigga mad for weeks
Man... My girl just quit me and I loved that freak
So frustration fucks is what I have in the sheets
Crime and murder has escalate
Fun and love has just turned to hate
Gin is in and niggas drink it raw
Watch for the task cause niggas break the law
Don't look for trust because it don't exist
You talk too much to that nasty bitch
Man... She told your plan to a hell of a dick
He told his click, now for a minute they rich
Since 88' I been slingin tapes
Like keys from Cuba or the Miami state
Triple beam it up and see how much I'm a make
It's been this way man since 88'

Motherfuckas drive cars that alert the law
Finest things that you've ever saw
Make a bitch suck dick and come up outta that bra
Found out she was cheatin, damn near broke her jaw
Masterminds... They got skeems for cream
Tryin to live that American Dream
Most niggas die over bitches and greed
Fuck the rest of this song I'm bout to smoke my weed
