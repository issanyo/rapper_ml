(equipto)
Everyday of my life i wouldn't change for nothin'
Momma said she ashamed becuase i stay blunted
Laughing cracker smile wen i do it how i want it
Roll the freeway like the indi 500
Im 50 zag patterns stay up like an addict
Chewy automatics, sticker like a magnet
The peewee's couldn't hurt the status
I live for situations where i work my magic
Im a long-range winner again, its a cut throat industry, whos gonna remain?
See im comen collidin' in the ride that was somethin to change
To you weak ass rappers with nothin to say
Paid dues, onterage, for my crew make way
We comen through, ain't nothin u can do but back down
We come to council we go without sponsers
Hit your town and take over the concert
Ready to get pumped

Come on, get pumped
Come on lets get pumped (get it off the chain)
Get pumped
Tear the roof off the mothercuker

(shaggy)
When im doin the show i stay pumped
Even when i bustle a hoe i stay pumped
Even when im paper chasin my dough i stay pumped
So if i got drama you know i stay pumped
Shiett, i get the cross pumped im runnin my mouth
With this punk ass bitch, tellin to turn this mother out
Now im a fiend for high heel pumps and ride cluts
And bitches that fuck around with junk in they trunk
They get the green buzz, the bodies on nerves, (?)
So lets get this mother off the chain, im bringinthe pain
Im losin my brain, makin these niggas insane, thinken the thangs
That neva gonna change, they followin his game
You'll forever feel pain, my membrane, is tellin me to keep shit crunk
So get outside and get ur ass pumped upp

Get pumped
Get pumped
Come on lets get pumped up
Get pumped
Getpumped
Come on lets get pumped up

Tear the roof off the mother fucker
