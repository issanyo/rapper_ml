Bitches take your clothes off
Homie let the money talk
I don't really care if you a baller or a big boss

Man this is the place to be
Man iced up to pay a fee
How many girls up on the floor?
I'd say about like twenty three
They like to shake it
They tell you "Homie drank it up"
And all the white girls like the brown girls with big butts
The Hennessy is fillin'
Man it's such a gangsta feelin'
Look at all the bitches as they walk around it's so appealin'
You know your supa chillin' when your money hits the ceilin'
This is what you really think about

(Yeah)
You wanna talk with her
Man then grab a drink and walk with her
And hit the champagne room and buy a bottle and get lost with her
Even my waitresses are super bad with super ass
Bringin' y'all the bottle
Askin her to join and she ain't mad
They like to click they heels

And focus on the dollar bills
The more they see the money is the more you see a better thrill
If you keep you keep it crackin' where the money keeps on stackin
I'm a tell you playboy
It's automatic

She really wanna do it
Man she really wanna make it
Man she really wanna grab it
Man she really wanna take it
She like to do it naked even if the club is packed
Man as long as all the money is all there and it's super stacked
You know the stage is lit with money man all over it
With six or seven girls that can dance and they super thick
They straight doin' it
Nothin' here can ruin it
This is real talk
Where them dollas at?
