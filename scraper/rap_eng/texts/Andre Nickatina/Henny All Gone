[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
Yo
Picture me in your picture frame
With a half a blunt and a half a bottle, mayne
Goin' fast in the slow lane
In court with a pocket full of weed and my gold chain
Be like (???) lets connect the dots
Mayonnaise jars to connect the pots
All these rocks will connect the blocks
And all this money lets load and lock
It might feel like you just got taser shocked with a major knot, in the anchor drop
Yo
Goin' fast in the slow lane
In court with a pocket fulla weed and my gold chain

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
Said I'm locked and I'm revved up
I'm started up and I'm on
Gimme my cut and I'm gone
Hennessey all gone

Said I'm locked and I'm revved up
I'm started up and I'm on
Gimme my cut and I'm gone
Hennessey all gone

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
Yo
I think shes just used to sailors
She think they got water on the brain
She think they got more water upstairs than they got sugar on the candycaine
Pop pop pop
Its all good when the liquor drop
And I'm like Picasso and a half when I roll my pot
Big Bank and no less
Quick fast in a hurry like that, Pony Express

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
Said I'm locked and I'm revved up
I'm started up and I'm on
Gimme my cut and I'm gone
Hennessey all gone

Said I'm locked and I'm revved up
I'm started up and I'm on
Gimme my cut and I'm gone
Hennessey all gone

[Verse 3: Andre Nickatina]
Shoot right by ya like a passing phase
I bump the OJ's on all cold days
I line ya up, sign ya up, rewind ya up
The weed is lit up just like times square
I talk it up like Howard Coselle
No way, no how, and no sale

[Verse 3 (Cont'd): Clyde Carson]
Cus a mack still ain't got no bail
My nigga ?? still ain't got no L’s
Hip nigga still lookin for the pill
??? persuading the win
Faded off gin, younger days
Champagne now, OJ chase
Hop in the whip and they holdin they face
Jaw on the flow, all on a hoe
Plus they choose ??? rap features
Tell me have you ever spent a rack on sneakers?
Got game that the schools can't teach ya
Too high to touch, don’t reach up
All gas, no breaks, don’t ease up
Hennessey all gone nigga re-up

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
Said I'm locked and I'm revved up
I'm started up and I'm on
Gimme my cut and I'm gone
Hennessey all gone

Said I'm locked and I'm revved up
I'm started up and I'm on
Gimme my cut and I'm gone
Hennessey all gone
