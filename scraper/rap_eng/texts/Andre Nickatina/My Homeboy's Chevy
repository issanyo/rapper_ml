Verse 1 (Mac Dre)

I'm on a block stacked up
Got tromps to kill
Purpin' out my 74 Bonneville
No time to chill
I'm a grind for real
What you want?
What you need?
Tryin to find some pills?
Well come holla at yo neighborhood thug supply
Got everythang a nigga love to buy
It's me, M-D
Skirtin from the killer whales
Black and Whites is always on a nigga's tail
But I'm hypo, nitro, keep the Chevy Vogue'n , floatin
From Sac to oakland and the sack you smokin
Nobody does it better, get my money, kill a nigga and the bitch I sweat her
I gets my cheddar
Ching ching and all that
Put it in a Backwood
Nigga roll that
It's nothing playa
A little game and muscle
It's all it takes to get a gang a rustle

Chorus

I sit low in my homeboys Chevy
My Makaveli hat pulled down by my eyes
Yo baby peep the science of something that's an actual fact
Yo you can't mix love with rap
You better step back
My K Swiss, like the step on the gas
And if you knew how fast, you'd think I just might crash
I think I saw the devil all up in my purple bag, and still I have to roll fat
Can you believe that?

Verse 2 (Andre Nickatina)

Can I believe that?
Did you retrieve that?
The money in the bag
Homie I'm a need that
My blackberry cellphone confuses me
I got women talking about Nicki you using me
I got coogi rap yo, in my speakers in the back
My car shine like a new gat, I'm with the "Genie of the Lamp"
Comin off the exit ramp
I grab cash like a calf cramp
I like garlic butter with Alioto's crab
My son had a fight
I told him work the jab
Sometimes I'm very stingy
But yo I'm mostly greedy
Man eatin onion rings
On Poke street, that be very greasy
Man it's cracking like a flower seed
Blowing off a gang of weed
Not to be authority
Picture for a more of me
Racing through this shit like the Olympics
Running red lights
Never caring about a witness

Chorus

I sit low in my homeboys Chevy, my Makaveli hat pulled down by my eyes
Yo baby picture tryin to sell somethin that's an actual fact yo
If you can't mix love with rap
You better step back
My K swiss, like the step on the gas
And if you knew how fast, you think I just might crash
I think I saw the devil roll up in my purple bag, and still I have to roll phat
Can you believe that?
