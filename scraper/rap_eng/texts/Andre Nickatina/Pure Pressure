I?m a chameleon I change like a deceptacon
In the blink of an eye I?m gone
With the wind, I check yo? chin just like a fuckin dentists
Bitch I gets my nuts I eat my steak I?m gonna finish
But check it Can you smell the murder cuz it?s thick
Killa baller in this bitch Now you filthy rich
Wrong! What how? It ain't that easy pal
Im nickatina andre seen ya feel my drug lifestyle yeah
Make money big baby
No bitch that ain't my baby
I wore a Jimmy hat that day see

And we only fucked once is you crazy
So like a titanic if you panic you is guaranteed to sink
I make scrilla like a brink I?m rare like a mink
So like a picture-perfect moment, nigga say cheese
Why do I keep runnin if 5-0 say freeze
Fresh adidas creep across the bathroom floor
And never underestimate a sexyass whore nigga
