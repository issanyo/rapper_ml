[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]

Read you like a TV guide
You can't hide
Better use your cellular
I tapped your phone line
It's the ginger bread man
Ho catch me if u can
My Kangol makes me look like MC Shan
Rock the atmosphere in my teflon gear
Dont drink coffee but I love Pam Grier
Let me give it to your ear drum and
You hear somthin'
Try to stop it but it just keeps comin'
Just keeps dumpin' just keeps bumpin
Just keeps crumplin'
Tiger, bitch
Relentless like a heat-seeking missle
Then gristle popping like a .45 pistol
With a pencil blowing kisses
To my old bitches good wishes
My red devil fish
Man I feeds em gold fishes
Baby did you call I can hear you whistle
Down the hall sporting leather
Like an NBA basketball freeze frame
Something like a homicide shot
On the move and alert when the set gets hot
Its like chess
Concentrate before you take a step
Because killings on the street is in full effect
Smoke two joints to the dearly departed
Bust nine rhymes and I'm just getting started
MCs come in packs of seven
And every time I send them to the gates of heaven
It's the ripper
Creased like a fresh pair of Dickies
Most say Andre, some say Nicky
Ricky, pass me a towel cause I'm sweating
Dice game going on and I'm side betting
Little Joe back doo nigga flow or blow
Ho what you know about the black fo-fo
Left for a sec but its welcome back Carter
And just like a baller I came back a starter
Fully loaded, tricks up the sleeve like a thief
Fifth dipped daytons, zap code beat

Chorus

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
Microphone tech like straight kung-fu
Nigga fuck me no nigga fuck you
It's the Nickatina beama masterpiece of rap
Ao when you hear raps, you betta cock yours back
Deeper than a root canal you know the style
Staring at the judge in court with a smile
My Mazda RX-7's name is Pitiful Pete
A one-seater cause it beat in the passenger seat
I came sober, my ?vestiges? I came to get over
I don't drink King Cobra bitch I am the king cobra
Like Dracula in an Acura
Cocaine white spectacula

Chorus
