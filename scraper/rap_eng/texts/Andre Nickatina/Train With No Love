Yeah, all aboard... All aboard

I know it feels insane on a train with no love
Drugs all deep in the brain on a train with no
Love I know it feels insane on a train with no
Love I died deep in the brain on a train with no
Love

Shit, I know it feels insane on a train with no
Love Drugs all in the brain on a train with no
Love I know it feels insane on a train with no
Love Drugs all deep in the brain on a train with
No love

[Verse 1]
Man we moving D, me and Jay Lee
That's my homie and we out to buy the key
Business is good, got a new wife, I
Could do this for the rest of my life
Hang with stars, drive fast cars, still wear a vest for
Protection at the bar Smoke me a spliff, talk big
Shit, never in my life will I ever will slip
Don't test me cuz I'm fast with the steel
Bullets come hot but they make cats chill Ready to kill if a
Cat comes short, nigga lord oh mercy dead on the
Porch I gotta do this cuz I can't hesitate, if I
Do it too early then I'm comin' in late Called Jay
Lee, he said "Cool, Man I'm glad you got rid
Of that fool" He said, "There's a
Concert goin' downtown, The O' Jays, Whispers and
James Brown" "Before you come can you
Make this round, we got a package comin' off
Greyhound" I said, "We do? Why you
Didn't tell me?" He said, "I was off
With the family" I thought for a sec then
Said "Okay" that's the homie Jay Lee
That's the homie from the way Got the information
Got to the spot, picked up the drop then I got
Popped They said "We got you", read me
My rights, and all I could think about was my wife
Got to the station, called Jay Lee, He said
"Ain't nothin' I can do for ya homie"
Hung up the phone, I heard the dial tone Now I'm
Thinkin', "What the hell is goin' on?"
Damn

[Verse 2]
I had a good lawyer, I got five years, Jay Lee did
It to boost his career Gave me up, to get a bigger
Cut and I didn't even see it cuz I was caught up
In the lust Man this trial done made me broke
Nobody's laughin' but I feel like a joke My wife
Is there, she's filled with tears, She'll have a
New man in five years I got a cold heart, I ain't
Gon' lie, but that shit right there made me cry
Trapped in the cell, the first day in my cellmate
Shanked me in the back with a pen I could feel it
Go in, I turned for revenge, he started screamin'
I killed his friend I started to shake, he started
To fuss, he said "Over a god damn six hundred
Bucks!" Man he could'a killed me, he started
To laugh, he said I'm gonna have to live with my
Past Let the demon sit up in my brain from
Bringin' that pain, from movin' that caine I'm
Sittin' there bleedin', this shit is misleadin', I'm in
A hospital on the very first evening Grittin' my
Teeth cuz life ain't sweet Now I'm trapped in the
Belly of the beast, shit

[Verse 3]
Three sixty five, I did it five times and I walked
Out with ALLAH in my mind
No red meats, I'm back on the streets
Thangs done changed, it's a new
Game Cats that I knew that was into books had
Flipped the script and turned into crooks Homies
Would say that the playa Jay Lee would always say
Good things about me I say "Fo' real?"
They say "Fo' real" Too bad the homie
Died in a dope deal "He left you a key for a
Mailbox, he said sorry 'bout somethin' then he
Stopped I took the key to the mail box, opened it
Up, and you know what? Jay Lee left me ninety-two G's and
A note that read "would I please Forgive me
Friend, for I have sinned." "Sometimes
We forget what life we're in" "I know
Money won't repay the hurt, but maybe it could
Wash away the dirt" "Cuz we were born
With hearts of gold, but as we get old, the heart
Gets cold" I folded the note, and kept it
With me so I could always be with the homie Jay
Lee I thought good things, like before I done
Drugs, and before the train with no love I called
My wife, she was surprised She took me back, now
How you love that? And just like that, I'm out of
The game That was the last stop on that train
Shit, I'mma tell ya... And that was the last stop
On that train
