[Verse 1 - AP.9]
It's crazy how this beat reminds me of sorcery
Everything i became i wasn't really forced to be
It was natural
To push crack and shoot
Chopping up white shit
Missing a class or two
Cast a few spells nigga
Mix a few potions
Testing myself but they said it was too potent
So it went back to the lab like witchcraft
But it was all in a twist
It was wrist-craft
And be-witched man
They don't know if they wanna be rich man
Or try to be this man
They fell victim to my plot
Yeah it was a sick plan
I was raised using rock as a kickstand
Then i got a little older open up a kickstand
Caught a fed case who gives a shit I'm rich man
I catch 22 i just witchcraft
I click and blam like medieval aristocrats

[Verse 2 - The Jacka]
The world is mine like the scarface picture
Got the folded stock nigga
Leave a large space in ya
Lost in the condo they call me ape killa
Hustlin with my niggas trying to escape the state prison
Like the matrix outside free myself from the system
Twisted chickens in the kitchen same stove
I cook dinner for my children
I gotta get them out of this building
Cause it ain't fit for living
Just for me i spent most my life in these conditions
On the other hand my lil brotha shot a man
Lil nigga this a world you won't understand
Take slower steps you just a young fly nigga
You don't know the rest
I'd take you through it but I promise you will never rest
You see me doing even when I'm trying be my best
Come on man can't you see this whole shit a test
The tool is to do it it's just time to rest

[Verse 3 - AP9]
My heart is moving like a 100 to 1
I'm trying to  have me a son
I don't think when I'm sipping the rum
I don't blink when I'm gripping the gun
I caught another case
Moved to another place
Had to change my Cali plates
I had to send one cock it back and bend one
Sitting on a grip of them thangs
That's no pretend gun
I wouldn't lend one only to the fo figures
I got 6 figures mob fearing no niggas
I bust triggas
Pull back and dust niggas
Off caught him in a cross
Now they never been soft
But I tossed the chop off in the ocean
Coasting across the bridge and I'm in motion
Damn I see the boys on us
That's when I been cornered
I see the boys on us
But they don't really want us
My shit kick gets us hypo
Smoking on the block when I hit the nitro
They really think I'm crazy but I'm just a psycho
I like it in the day but i love the night grow
My momma used to tell me not to touch the pipe smoke
But hit the calico and go and get ya snipo
Damn when i was young young
See growing up was kinda fun, fun
I fell in love with a gun, gun
I represent the fuckin slums, slums
Aye

[Hook - AP9]
It's all about going to the top neva stoppin
Never hesitating on the block we the mobbin
It's the mob that we live and die for
Each and everyone of us so fuck my rivals
I tell my heat don't fail me now
I really need ya
I pulls you through the ghetto and I squeeze ya
And everytime I bust my gun i think about growing up
Living life on the run

[Verse 4 - Cognito]
See I grew up with nothing
That's why when i make money I love it
It's the same reason I refuse to tuck my chain in in public
Don't mess with the stressing
That's why we only investing in weapons
I don't rely on luck
I know I'll lose it a second I'm guessing
Them haters lurking and I'm more than they give me they shifty
That's why I don't hit the club without at least one mob figure with me
I remember how it used to be, no girls no cars
We had them drugs but honestly they'd only go so far
Everybody wants a kid but can't nobody afford it
Halla ya claim
Like me and Nickatina in portland
They know my name
Now all you do is smile and ignore em
Ain't nothing changed
I ain't gonna do a fucking thang for em
It's hard times and i been through so much shit in my life
So if I like a Nick Peace beat ima spit on it twice
I'm so knowledged
Don't want beef
Don't want no problems
Cause I'm still hungry like a running back who's fresh out of college

[Verse 5 - Andre Nickatina]
And I'm caught up in the coldest rap song with no coat
Standing there shaking like an addict, no dope
Faith with no hope and rock with queen man
I'm opened and feined for that coke is keem
And I roll to the beat the bass with a blind soul
You see my greedy nature soon as tha touch goes
My homie said he had life by the ball
I said life's a bitch you should give her a call
And mother nature she accepts all strangers
I like to wear my hair like a hard gangbanger
God my material lust so ridiculous
I need a shot of heroin just to feel the rush
Or codeine
I could be a part of your dream
Sometimes I really have to wonder
Bout the mind of a fiend
I'm kamikaze
It's like the movie scene out of rocky
When the bell rang
Punch and swang
My block has the ghost of old thugs that can't leave
I give them praise every time that I blow weed
I make more g's remember the storm
Will you really drop gangs like a child is born
And you can name it
Take a couple pictures then frame it
Life time credit and you never make a payment
It's like I see the light of the gun blast
They run fast
We was young in the days when we cut grass
Look how we grow fast
Go find a fast cash
We like religion so I wonder if god's mad

[Hook]
It's all about going to the top neva stoppin
Never hesitating on the block we the mobbin
It's the mob that we live and die for
Each and everyone of us so fuck my rivals
I tell my heat don't fail me now
I really need ya
I pulls you through the ghetto and I squeeze ya
And everytime I bust my gun i think about growing up
Living life on the run
