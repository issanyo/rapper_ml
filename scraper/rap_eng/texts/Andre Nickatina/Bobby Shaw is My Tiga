I take a flight with my niggas
I do it right with my niggas
I hit the night with my niggas
I rock the mic with my niggas
I get around with my niggas
I hit the town with my niggas
I spit a round with my niggas
I sport the crown with my niggas
I got the flow with my niggas
I do a show with my niggas
I pull a ho with my niggas
I gotta roll with my niggas
I spit the word with my niggas
All on the curb with my niggas
I hit the herb with my niggas
Talkin 'bout words with my niggas
Watch basketball with my tigaz
I hit the mall with my tigaz
Break all the laws with my tigaz
Man, Bobby Shaw is my tiga
I hit the sky with my tigaz
Get over high with my tigaz
Cut cherry pie with my tigaz
I'll probably fry with my tigaz
