You know what I'm sayin'?  You know, you know, you say "Who influenced you in the Bay?", you know, even though me and Dre the same age I be like "Yeah, yeah that cat influenced me, in a way", you know what I'm sayin'?  I been watchin' this man, we been, we been in this game since he was seventeen

Hmm

So, you know, I remember walkin' in a club when I was seventeen
Boom, boom, boom, I walk up in the mothafuckin' club, and I grab, uh-uh-a soda, I'm only seventeen at a spot.  And this, and this song come on and the whole mothafuckin' club know it and I asked the bitch standin' next to me, I'm like, "Who the fuck is this?".  That bitch said, "That's Mac Dre, nigga!"

"Too Hard for the Radio"?
