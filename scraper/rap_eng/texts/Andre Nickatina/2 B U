Most times I drive with a samurai eye
Cause my lady says my style was set the fly
And held tight like a pistol grip
With a new meaning to the word pistol whip
She says she loves how I look in the rain
But since i never cry, yo, it shows my pain
So I threw on the hat and killed all that
Man imma rap cat I don't feel all that
Man God Khan

Primetime on the candy grime
Baby looking at me trying to read my mind
She can see that my mouth be spitting lines
But she ain never been in love with a pisces sign
Shit man now i'm like a parlays bet
I'm in the cd player of your coke connect
Fucker flame on fucker flame off
You can see my attitude if the game lost

Adjust the base on the Nakamichi
Roll the blunts optimos is peachy
I dress smooth like Cappadonna
Hang with sharks and mean piranhas
Keep my style all in your mental
Drive and shake my Shirley Temple
I just might fly on continental
And beat this dime piece in the rental
She love I

Cats come in there Armani suits
Looking way too cute
Tell the freak to spread the loot
Man imma tell you one thing two times
The homie down the street yo hes got 3 nines
See where im from yo that ain't to crime
See certain numbers have to keep your ass in line

Even if it shines and gets dark
Throw a new engine in a old skylark
The silver Fox with the Goldylox
Here to shake the block
Like you bake the rocks
And to make the cream
But don't taste the cream
Cause when you make the cream its the scheme
Na' mean?
Man its something like a vegas roll
You get to chopin up and i can get with major hoes
You get to running like a tiger when the dangers go
You're lucky if you even get the change of clothes
Word
Switch up to a diamond light
It's like cutting butter baby with a sharper knife
Blunted up one day off glue
She's looking at me taking off my shoe
She asked me something that I neva eva knew
She said "Nicky, I wonder what it's like to be you."

I keep it going on, flowing on
Baby till the break of dawn
Andre Nicky baby don't make me none
I'm trying to get everything under the sun
I like when you put my hair up in a bun
Then I go like an arsonist
I put the dope together baby like pharmacist
And whats wrong with this
And who's bomb is this
Man the blunt is rolled tighter than a boxer's fist
God
I come down like candle wax
I catch you off guard see if you can handle that
Man I'm the Motorola Coca-Cola
Do it like the Ayatollah
Service so slow because it sticks like jail
Why is the judge raisin up this bail?
Thats your sister baby I couldn't tell
I roll around like DJ Run
My thug homies want me to see they guns
I get between you like a boxing ref
Man whats up with that freak
Have you knocked her yet?
I treat Popeyes like gourmet
Zapco bumps rocks and chantea
Keep my nails cut with precision
Add and multiply division
Money makings how I'm living
Smoking weed up in the kitchen
You feel 'aight
I'm at the bird like a steam ray southern like a ghost
Turn around and disappear or something like a ghost
Looking like a cat that just got chose
Smelling like a rolls closing all four doors
