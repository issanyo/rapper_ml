[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
I roll weed like an outlaw
I'm right handed but still I'm a south paw
My gold rings are just for amusement
Yo it's 1AM, let the liquor and the booze in
I dress fresh like Capadona
You might see me talkin' shit to all the chefs down at Benihanas

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
To be completely honest
I only see piranhas
And all my niggas mobbin'
The heat is right beside us
6-15 slappin' hard
We never move in silence
All about our cheese
Small but we sleepin' giants
Tryna shake the sirens
Everything is high risk
So all this shit is timeless
Need zeros with the commas

[Verse 3: Andre Nickatina]
I stake claim like a dice game
And I say where is my steak?
When the beans and the rice came
You know my life is 'bout the rise and fall
So tell them bitches I was born to ball
And I won't call
It's the last call
And it's packed, y'all
Cognac and rollin' weed like an outlaw

[Hook: The Jacka (x2)]
Crime, and crime don't pay
Everybody know me out here in the bay
Say what you say, put it on display
It's somethin' like religion where we stay
Man, my middle name is

[Verse 4: The Jacka]
T's been a long time, youngin'
Change ain't comin'
Long dry summer
Til you hear this thunder
4-11 possi, all you smell is rubber
2-11 robbery, born in a struggle
Mom's ashamed of me, but I still love her
Could tell her my street story, but that don't concern her
Niggas died in my arms so I sleep with my burner
Cry and mourn but the pains still ponder
Say we in a storm, but the rain ain't agua
Red and blue lights, spotlights, helicopters
Here's what we faced and we placed in a lockbox
One of my cellmates say he facin' a lifetime
So I beat it down, took my pain for that long ride
Never drop a tear but it never made your soul cry
Won't nobody care when you're gray and an old guy
Locked in a beast and the years just roll by

[Verse 5: Andre Nickatina]
I'm complex like a foster child
With marijuana in the car, and the beat is loud
Ask Skully and Mulder can i see the file?
Ask them broke-ass bitches, how you like me now, Khan
My mind state is like four Glocks
'Cause you can hear me going over like eight blocks
My homie did six years with just eight rocks
Got out, he got arrested at the same spot, damn
I get you back like laser tag
And it's something like Ali and Frasier had
Such a beautiful mind when you count the math
I ain't payin' for nothin' so collect the tab, baby

[Hook: The Jacka (x2)]
Crime, and crime don't pay
Everybody know me out here in the bay
Say what you say, put it on display
It's somethin' like religion where we stay
Man, my middle name is
