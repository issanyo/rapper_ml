Baby I'ma do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Hey Shorty

[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
I'm always looking for winner
You're rolling with a world wide sinner
Jump out the car and let my perm hit her
The city is drug, my Rolls Royce is thumping like a club
So I ain't gon' front, here have a blunt
Sitting outta' here deli square having lunch
The Hennessey we drinking got us both getting drunk
And then I start to talk about my rings
And how money's maid, even when it rains, it's not a game
My bright lights are like the next door lights
If it's a first class flight then it must be right, yo
And I don't have no time to be no sponsor
Man if you do it right man we can hit up all the concerts
Might hit the mall way harder than a boxer
See something nice then you asking me to knock her
I can never jock her, got up with the game on display
She bet on it and didn't walk away, my name is Dre

Baby I'ma do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Hey Shorty

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
Baby make that flight, for real we can do it all tonight
Man give me one chance to make it right
Cuz I can get the clients, if you can kick the science
The way I'm talking baby it'll make somebody else buy it
They really can't deny it, the city is the Mecca for the money
Blaze slow baby talk to me, my number is 555 55 55
It's kinda hard to memorize, I'm so live
I do a u-turn all on Van Ness, baby thought I wouldn't do cuz the car was so fresh
I jump out the car on her like a shooting star
And even though I'm wearing Jordans, Man I'm still at the bar
It's just the city life, living with the pretty life
Where people treat their car and their money like a pretty wife
You take her round town , make me take her downtown
Anywhere the money's quick and it never slows down

Baby I'ma do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Baby I'm gonn' do it all in one night
Hey Shorty
