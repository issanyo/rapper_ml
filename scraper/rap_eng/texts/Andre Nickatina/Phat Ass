Phat ass

The bitch right there got a phat ass
Phat ass

No credit card bitch all cash
Put the weed and coke on the car dash
Jump right in make a big splash
Phat ass
Phat ass
No credit card bitch all cash
Put the weed and coke on the car dash
Jump right in make a big splash

She said what's your name? I said phat ass
I was serious but the bitch start to laugh
The new Benz came out the tunnel fast
Marijuana and the hennessy bout to clash

Hot rod, feel the vibe
Top off, ready to drive
High fly, she livin' life
Phat ass has passion that's right
That's it, gotta keep it classic
Gotta thank God for that booty boombastic
Phat ass always been my first choice
Phat ass roll in like Rolls Royce
Wraith, Ghost, Dawn, Phantom, your choice
Put the fatass song on we jam on, Rejoice
Make the booty clap no hands make noise

She said what's your name? I said phat ass
I was serious but the bitch start to laugh
The new Benz came out the tunnel fast
Marijuana and the hennessy bout to clash

A lotta whip cream for your funnel cake
You can never be broke with the right shake
Get all them clowns comin' to the yard
Feel more for life yeah with a perm god
Bring money to the table is my only hobby
And if you feel the same meet me down in the lobby
I move like a snake in the green grass, two double shots fillin' up a big glass
New Adidas gel toe white stripes
And she cornbread thick standin to the right
I never had a job in my whole life, my whole life

Phat ass

Put the weed and coke on the car dash
Jump right in make a big splash

Icebergs, no one's got it quite like hers
She's my nurse with those curves
Leaves me with no words
Let me hit you with this fatass verse
Call it what you want to call it
I'm a bubble butt a holic
Fat ass and weed made a bad boy outta me
Fat ass round like a lettuce see
Fat ass down, everybody wanna see
Slap that ass watch it bounce back like a bad check
When she poses for a pic she poses a threat
That fat ass has much respect

Phat ass
Phat ass
No credit card bitch all cash
Put the weed and coke on the car dash
Jump right in make a big splash
Phat ass
Phat ass
No credit card bitch all cash
Put the weed and coke on the car dash
