I'm like carmello baby top of the sugar hill
The way I see your game is something like a drug deal
The angels follow me like ? through the sin city
Some try to ask me if I care I say "not really"
I push the gas hella fast through a bay maze
Man yous a lying ass bitch with your square ways
Your like a jackolantern caught up in my rap patterns
And when you see my rangs all you think about is saturn
Man you can put me in your iPhone application
Im crackin crab like im mad down in crustacean
You know its my car when you see me parkin then
Im Minnesota cold like im Fran Tarkenton
I wear white like about to meet jesus christ
Then hit the night like the devil in the turnpike
Its like I hate my life when im running red lights
And you can see the blunt lit if you look right
Man I dont talk to that cat hes a quagmire
I got the mustard and the mayonnaise vouge tires
They call me money shark, cause im a pisces
I got the super fresh gear at the dry clean
Khan I mean, Creased up jeans
And when it comes to the benz its a toy machine
So roll up the weed, and blow a smoke circle
Somebody ask Alice Walker about the color purple
They got me painting on the mural of the great wall
Its like im seeing though the eyes of Ray Charles
With no shades, permed in wave, fried in laid, freshed and sprayed
They call me money shark cause im a pisces
I got the super fresh gear at the dry clean
