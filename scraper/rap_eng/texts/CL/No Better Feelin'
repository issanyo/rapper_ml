[Verse 1]
You know that we light up the night
So nothing is black and white
'Cause everything I do
Is always technicolor with you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you got my back
Don't you know I got you like that
I could fly when you're by my side
When you're by my side

[Chorus]
Ain't no better feelin'
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Ain't no better feelin'
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Yeah you're the reason
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
I can feel the stars
Light up in my heart
Ain't no better feelin'

[Verse 2]
You're the magic in the galaxy
Bringing out the best in me
Shining like a diamond sun
Is what you do for everyone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you got my back
Don't you know I got you like that
I could fly when you're by my side
When you're by my side

[Chorus]
Ain't no better feelin'
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Ain't no better feelin'
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Yeah you're the reason
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
I can feel the stars
Light up in my heart
Ain't no better feelin'

Ain't no better feelin'
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Ain't no better feelin'
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Yeah you're the reason
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
I can feel the stars
Light up in my heart
[x2]

Ain't no better feelin'
