[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
내 이름은 용이지 (My name is Dragon)
화나면 불이 나 (When I’m angry, I spit fire)
웬만하면 (If you don’t mind) call me G
I got the dirty vibe
You ain't certified
You got the funny vibe
내가 세상을 흔들면 넌 (When I shake the world)
멀미 나 (You’ll feel dizzy)
그래 더럽게 (That’s right, we do it dirty)
We gon' celebrate, every fuckin day
나를 따라해 (Try to copy me)
그래 더럽게 (That's right, dirty)
그래 더럽게 (That's right, dirty)
더 더럽게 (Even dirtier)
Dirty vibe

[Bridge: CL]
Bitch I'm on that
Bitch I'm on that
Bitch I'm on that
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm
Bitch I'm on that
Bitch I'm on that
Bitch I'm on that
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm
Bitch I'm on that
Dirty vibe

[Verse 2: CL]
Seoul city, GZB, CL
Hold up, you in the presence of a queen
Ow! Turnt up
All the pretty bitches love me
Unnie
Mouth full of gold with them jheri curls
Stuntin’ in some Prince shit
Diamonds and Pearls
I be on my worst behavior
Hold my purse
Runways and strip clubs
I’ll be making it work
Cuz, I’ll be on 1’til I die
Middle finger up so high
Dirty vibe, dirty vibe
Bitch I'm on that (Dirty vibe)

[Bridge: G-Dragon & CL]
I don't pop molly, I rock microphones
Point it atcha girl, watch her ass sing along
Talk shit with the prettiest lips
Blow a kissKick a hole in your speaker, and then split
Do it just for fun
I come second to none
Swervin' in the lambo like a son of a gun
What you ain't you ain't, you ain't know?
I'm yo girl's lesbian crush
She ain't with you she be rollin' my dirty vibe

[Outro: G-Dragon]
GGGG-G to the D motherfucker
Who am I?
내가 서울이다 (I’m Seoul) motherfucker
바다 건너 산 넘어 (Across oceans and mountains)
I still be on the come up
Get it, huh?
넌 그냥 이거나 먹어 (Eat this, motherfucker)
평소엔 젠틀한 어른처럼 but mic 하나만 주면 (I’m always like a gentleman, but if you just give me a mic)
얼음처럼 모두를 얼려 마치 그게 버릇처럼 (I freeze everyone like ice like it’s my habit)
더럽게 즐겨봐 다시 처음처럼 (Enjoy it dirtily like the beginning)
G-Duh from the feet up
I'm as dirty as they come and there's only one
