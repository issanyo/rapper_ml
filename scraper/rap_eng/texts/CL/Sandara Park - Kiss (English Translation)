I just wanna kiss
I never wanna miss
More tingly one more time
Take my breath away
I’m dying for your kiss
I never wanna miss
Don’t hold back any more
Take my lips away
(2NE1)

Baby boy
Why do you always have so much to say
Stuffy baby boy
I know you’re going to confess you love me
I’m not a baby girl
I’m more quick-witted than you think
Every day we always go back to the same place
I don’t know why the heck you do that to me

Baby boy
Remember how I fell for that confidence
My baby boy
Your tempo is much more boring than you think
I’m your baby girl
When we separate, my hand only shakes
A bouquet of flower is great, a ring is great but
I guess you just never know

Don’t speed up
Don’t tell me boring stories
How would I be able to take it then?
Are you a guy by any chance?

Don’t smile
It’s so dull
Close your eyes and come here now
And just get it get it

I just wanna kiss
I never wanna miss
More tingly one more time
Take my breath away
I’m dying for your kiss
I never wanna miss
Don’t hold back any more
Take my lips away

Hurry up
You let it touch
I never wanted a lot

Hurry up you let it touch
Baby just for today, please

CL
Come on and
Let my body bounce
Don’t test my patience
Today again, I’m ’bout to luz control
As if my heart is dynamite

Tik tik tok tok time goes fast
Please please stop stop
This night is more last
The image of you smiling like a fool
It’s hard for me to bear it, killing me
If you want me too let’s go
Dancing, my heart is disco
As if you’re making my surroundings spin
Without a word, A UFO that quickly flies away

Don’t speed up
Don’t tell me boring stories
How would I be able to take it then?
Are you a guy by any chance?

Don’t smile
It’s so dull
Close your eyes and come here now
And just get it get it

I just wanna kiss
I never wanna miss
More tingly one more time
Take my breath away
I’m dying for your kiss
I never wanna miss
Don’t hold back any more
Take my lips away

Hurry up
You let it touch
I never wanted a lot

Hurry up
You let it touch
Baby just for today, please
Let’s break this sound

Love is dangerous
Your gaze is so poisonous
Right now swaying, the two of us
But we just feel so good

Love is dangerous
Your lips are so poisonous
Right now swaying, the two of us
We dangerous
In danger danger danger danger

Love is dangerous
Your gaze is so poisonous
Right now swaying, the two of us
But we just feel so good

Love is dangerous
Your lips are so poisonous
Right now swaying, the two of us
We dangerous
In danger danger danger danger
