[Chorus: CL]
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, aye, aye
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, aye
My hair blonde, your shit red like a cherry
We both un-ordinary, this shit real, they synthetic
You get they how you want it, found your lady then gon' run it
'Bout that green, I'mma want it, now you know how I'm on it
You the only that make me surrender, yuh
You the only that make me surrender, yuh
You the only that make me surrender, yuh
You the only that make me surrender, yuh

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
Girl, you know you really changed my life
Girl, you know you really changed my life
You're my wife
I remember those nights, we stayed up all night
Yuh, we fucked and we fight, but we know we would be alright
Oh, oh, that's why your my type
Oh, oh, that's why your my type
Oh, oh, oh, that's why your my type
Oh, oh, that's why your my type

[Interlude: Lil Yachty & Shaiana]
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, oh, whoa
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, oh, whoa
That's why your my type
That's why your my type (And that's why your my type)
That's why your my type (And that's why your...)

[Chorus: CL]
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, aye, aye
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, aye
My hair blonde, your shit red like a cherry
We both un-ordinary, this shit real, they synthetic
You get they how you want it, found your lady then gon' run it
'Bout that green, I'mma want it, now you know how I'm on it
You the only that make me surrender, yuh
You the only that make me surrender, yuh
You the only that make me surrender, yuh
You the only that make me surrender, yuh

[Outro: Shaiana]
