Mental Breakdown
Mental

Watch over the power of this vibration
This feeling that rides down your spine
A single flower will bloom
Fire, fire, everyone be careful
This is like yoga with words
I’ll melt down all the stiff ones at once
If your tail is long, you’ll definitely get caught
The world has come to this, fakers are rising

Abracadabra
This is a lullaby that wakes up your soul
Go up high and look down on yourself
Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun
Karma karma karma is looking for you
What u gonna do when they come for you
Karma karma karma is gonna find you
What u gonna do

The full moon is up, everyone dance in a circle
2NE1 is here, everybody sqalay
A random dance that will grab the world by its neck
My hidden eyes can tell apart the fakers
I’m fast as I run like a rabbit
I make it explode like a double nosebleed
Messed up hair and glazed eyes
Mental breakdown mission success

Bippity boppity boo, hakuna matata
Follow along your unconscious mind
Look at this spinning earth
Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun
Karma karma karma is looking for you
What u gonna do when they come for you
Karma karma karma is gonna find you
What u gonna do

How beautiful is this life
How painful is this life
