Another day passes by like this
My whole day was spent for you

I wore the clothes that you liked the best
I should look beautiful in the mirror
But I just look miserable
The tactless night sky is so beautiful

I wish you could be me
I wish I could be you
I wish you could feel it for just a day
Your heart
My heart

I wish I could love you
I wish you would love me
I wish we could be together just for a day
So I can let you go without regrets

I want to throw away everything in front of me
I want to scream out loud but

The only one to listen would be me
Along with the burning candle
There’s not much left to my heart
This beautiful house feels like prison
The tactless night sky is so beautiful

I wish you could be me
I wish I could be you
I wish you could feel it for just a day
Your heart
My heart

I wish I could love you
I wish you would love me
I wish we could be together just for a day
So I can let you go without regrets

Sometimes, I want to push everything back and go out like you
I want to wash down my pain with alcohol, my sadness with laughter
But I don’t

I wish you could be me
I wish I could be you
I wish you could feel it for just a day
Your heart
My heart

I wish I could love you
I wish you would love me
I wish we could be together just for a day
So I can let you go without regrets

I wish you could be me
I wish I could be you
I wish you could feel it for just a day
So I can let you go without regrets
