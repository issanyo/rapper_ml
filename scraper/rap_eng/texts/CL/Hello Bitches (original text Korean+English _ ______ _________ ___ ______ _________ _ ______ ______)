엉덩이 빵빵빵
남자들은 Time Time Time
내 입술 냠냠냠
어딜가든 당당당
등장은 차차차
뛰자뛰자 방방방
디스코 팡팡팡
Hello Bitches

난 지금 어디야 쇼핑 spree in Tokyo
Wake up in my private jet 매일 아침 또띠아
Liftin’ cards in Macau 내가 제일 잘나가
Stop blowing up my phone
Eh won’t you hit me up on Kakao
Diamonds in my grill 날 말려 누가?
Skin tone 22 carats gold I got in Dubai
My boys won’t hesitate to run up on your boys
My boys won’t hesitate to run up on your boys

엉덩이 빵빵빵
남자들은 Time Time Time
내 입술 냠냠냠
어딜가든 당당당
등장은 차차차
뛰자뛰자 방방방
디스코 팡팡팡
Hello Bitches

Yellow gold ain’t it glow like a yellow phone
Couldn’t see me with a selfie from my telephone
Got hella dough Hello Kitty getting hella old
Want me to love them long time
And I tell em NO
Sake to soju Nagasaki to Seoul you
Can find me in Shanghai
You know what them shots of Baijiu do
Got these Asian girls dancing on the couches
Yeah they know me
And they singing every word
Like they was at the karaoke huh

엉덩이 빵빵빵
남자들은 Time Time Time
내 입술 냠냠냠
어딜가든 당당당
등장은 차차차
뛰자뛰자 방방방

Bad bitches get down on the floor
Lights out killing it some more
Bad bitches get down on the floor
Lights out killing it some more
Bad bitches get down on the floor
Lights out killing it some more
Bad bitches get down on the floor
