[Chorus]
My butt is ppangppangppang
Boys are like time time time
My lips are nyamnyamnyam
Wherever I go, dangdangdang
Get on stage like jjan jjan jjan
Run, run bangbangbang
Disco, pangpangpang
Hello, bitches

[Verse 1]
Where am I?, shopping spree in Tokyo
Wake up in my private jet, every morning Tortilla
Lifting cards in Macau, I am the best
Stop blowing up my phone and won’t you hit me up on Kakao?
Diamonds in my grill and who can stop me? Who?
Skin tone 2-2 karats gold I got in Dubai
My boys won’t hesitate to run up your boys
My boys won’t hesitate to run up your boys

[Chorus]
My butt is ppangppangppang
Boys are like time time time
My lips are nyamnyamnyam
Wherever I go, dangdangdang
Get on stage like jjan jjan jjan
Run, run bangbangbang
Disco, pangpangpang
Hello, bitches

[Verse 2]
Yellow gold ain’t it glow like a yellow phone?
Couldn’t see me with a selfie from my telephone
Got hella dough, Hello Kitty getting hella old
Want me to love them long time and I tell 'em no
Sake to soju Nagasaki to Seoul
You can find me in Shanghai
You know what those shots of baijiu do
Got these Asian girls dancing on the couches, yeah, they know me
And they singing every word like they was at the karaoke, huh

[Chorus]
My butt is ppangppangppang
Boys are like time time time
My lips are nyamnyamnyam
Wherever I go, dangdangdang
Get on stage like jjan jjan jjan
Run, run bangbangbang
Disco, pangpangpang
Hello, bitches

[Bridge]
Lights out, killing it some more
Bad bitches get down on the floor
Lights out, killing it some more
Bad bitches get down on the floor
Lights out, killing it some more
Bad bitches get down on the floor
Lights out, killing it some more
Bad bitches get down on the floor

[Outro]
One, two, three
Bitches!
