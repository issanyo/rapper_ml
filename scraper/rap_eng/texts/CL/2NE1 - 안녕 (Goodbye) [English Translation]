[Verse 1: CL]
Don’t go
Don’t say you'll leave me here
Don’t leave me in this memory
Don’t look at my eyes that cannot hold onto you
Just don’t go

[Verse 2: CL]
Don’t be fooled
Don’t give into the temptation
Not everything lasts forever
When the winter passes, spring follows, you know that
Just don’t go

[Pre-Chorus: Dara]
When today passes
It feels like tomorrow will be different
Will I be able to go on without you?

[Chorus: CL]
Until the day we meet again
Goodbye goodbye
Until that day we meet again
Goodbye goodbye
Does anyone know
Does anyone know
How it makes me feel?
Until the day we meet again, goodbye goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge: CL]
Oh goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 3: Park Bom]
Don’t trust
Don’t trust the broken stories
Don’t lose faith
The promises we made together come to mind
Tears are falling down

[Verse 4: Park Bom]
Don’t forget
Even if things get rough, it will be okay
Come find me when you need someone to lean on
Even though I cannot stay forever with you
It’s okay just for awhile

[Pre-Chorus: Dara]
When today passes
It feels like tomorrow will be different
Will I be able to go on without you?

[Chorus: Park Bom]
Until the day we meet again
Goodbye goodbye
Until that day we meet again
Goodbye goodbye
Does anyone know
Does anyone know
How it makes me feel?
Until the day we meet again, goodbye goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

[Outro: CL & Park Bom]
Until the day we meet again, goodbye goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Until the day we meet again, goodbye goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
No goodbye, goodbye
