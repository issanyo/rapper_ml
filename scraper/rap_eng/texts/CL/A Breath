[Hook: Sam Ock]
This life is like a breath; our days
Are numbered as we swiftly fade away
Though life is like a breath; how great --
Your word endures forever and a day!

[Verse 1: J. Han]
Life happens; but, it’s moving too fast
My brother lost his mom to cancer. Man, the shock is too vast
Can’t wrap my mind around it even after two laps
Life is so fragile, withering away like tulips
Look upon this broken world, full of disappointments
Shattered dreams, and bitter endings; did you find an ointment?
You could spend the next 20 years searching solace for the tears
Just to render your life useless like engines without its gears
Do you find this funny that a lot of young dummies
Waste their lives away following the ways of Young Money?
It's impossible to draw any water from an empty well
Can you really quench your thirst in that citadel?
An everlasting river's waiting for you to drink from it
Taste and see His goodness and grace
In abundance. Man, a hundred days in his courts
Is better than a hundred J's
Or hundred ways to utilize your paper chase

[Hook]

[Verse 2: CL]
Music for the moment, moments made with music
Precious memories last forever, priceless times make up the blueprint
Second hand in progression towards every second; a blessing
Pay attention or we’ll be missing these most cherished possessions
Nobody learns to hate it only waits to be provoked
Holding grudges ties the hands as time escapes and drifts afloat
All alone in bitterness as selfishness bears rotten fruit
Mal-nourishing a heart from forgiveness to act in vain pursuit
Best friends becoming enemies as bonds are torn
Divorces, leaving broken homes cause spouses can’t get along
As believers we should live to set examples for all
But how can we illustrate forgiveness if we’re not willing to draw?
Called to reconcile, seek and show mercy and grace
Forgiveness brings a joy that can mend a broken embrace
The Gospel shows we’re forgiven, if transformation is certain
Our attitude should be more like Christ and not Wicked Servants (Matt.18:21-35)
