We met in the summer of 07
I was lost in heaven
You came into my life
Provided me with the sweetest high

Never forgot the first time you spent the night
Sitting on the curve

I was kicking rhymes
While you listened

Lights flicker in the mist of things
You vanished

Every summer I vanish
Until the day we landed

Crash down my planet
Forever and a day

I need a day
Cause Your love is like my sweet escape


Verse 2

They say we're meant to be together
Picture perfect
Cooler than December weather
Never measure to the pressure

Heard  I'm different now
I ask em how

Is it me
Or you the one thats losing out

Hmm now take a second
To carry out your imperfections

Insecurities play the deadly weapon

Final composition
From thoughts deeper than existence

The only son, how could you missed him

Isn't It ironic
The logic
Behind it

The Science
Of chronic
Is binding
With unfamiliar knowledge

Verse 3

You showed me that you cared
But I'm having affaires
I ventured to places that made you unaware
Of every circumstance
Love at first glance
It felt so official
But officially I'm done with lies
This my goodbye

Bridge

Boom bap, boom boom bap (X2)

Goodbye to my summer angel
We loved and rised
But now it's time to die

Say goodnight
To the good guy

Now say goodnight to the good guy (X3)

My summer angel (x3)

We love and rise (x8)
