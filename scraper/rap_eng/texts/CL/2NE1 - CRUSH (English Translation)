I’m the hot crush of all girls
Giving you the rush that makes your heart pound
Pretty unnis like me
Because they get prettier if they like me

They love me cuz I’m hot
They love me cuz I’m cold
They love me cuz I’m real
They love me cuz I kill (x2)

I have nothing to be afraid of
Even I’m scared of myself
I’m busy, don’t you even watch TV?
I’m going now, don’t talk to me

If you think you can dance like me, come out
I’ll kill you by myself
This music that makes you go crazy
Do you hear it?
MINZY they love me

I’m a bitch
Whatever I do, I do it my way
I’m a bitch
Everyone knows, I don’t care
I’m not sad at all
Don’t expect too much from me
I’m a bitch who can’t be stopped

They love me cuz I’m hot
They love me cuz I’m cold
They love me cuz I’m real
They love me cuz I kill (x2)

I got 21 big brothers
To me you ain’t big brother
With my pretty lips, I say rough things
If you provoke me, only you’ll get hurt

Valentines day everyday
Even Cupid is in love with me
Don’t be deceived by my smile
Because I’m dangerous

I’m a bitch
Whatever I do, I do it my way
I’m a bitch
Everyone knows, I don’t care
I’m not sad at all
Don’t expect too much from me
I’m a bitch who can’t be stopped

They love me cuz I’m hot
They love me cuz I’m cold
They love me cuz I’m real
They love me cuz I kill (x2)

Come and get it i kill
Come and get it i kill
Yeah Come and get it i kill
Come and get it i kill
