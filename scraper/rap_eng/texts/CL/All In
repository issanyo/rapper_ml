Snippet:

[Chorus]
I need you all in
It's everything or nothing now
You know what I came here for
I need you to give me more
Say you all in
Let me take you to the top
Show me what you came here for
'Cause I don't wanna wait no more
I need you all in
I need you all in

[Bridge]
Don't you be afraid to be too deep
I need your body
Set my body, set my body free
I need you now, don't keep me waitin'
I need you all in
I need your body
Set my body, set my body free
I need you now, don't keep me waitin'
I see it in your eyes
Fire runnin wild
If I'm what you want

[Chorus]
I need you all in
It's everything or nothing now
You know what I came here for
I need you to give me more
Say you all in
Let me take you to the top
Show me what you came here for
'Cause I don't wanna wait no more
I need you all in
