Mia X is back and I came to out rap
You so, get out my face before I smack you hoe
Yeah you know respect who I am
Cause if you mess with me I'll take ya man

Well I'll take ya man right out your crib
And make him do the shit for me that he never did
So when you see us together perfing in the place
Super shocked, got the dick look on your face
Go head roll your eyes, talk some shit
But you ain't bad enough to get em up with this bitch
Now you can call me a raw man stealing hoe
But I couldn't take you nigga unless he's ready to go
You know what's up
I'm all about chin checks
Mia X gets wrecked on dumb young ??
Like you fucked the rest of your crew
Them hoes getting somewhere when I starts to shoot
I gives a damn
You know who I am
Fake bitch don't play me close
Cause I'll take yo man

I'll take yo man
Ya fiancee your husband
The niggas you sweating and all your fuck friends
And when I say I will you know I can
Don't fuck with me
Cause I'll take yo man

I'll take yo man and bitch you got to deal with this
Its not a bet or a threat
Its a damn promise
From me to you
Think you the shit
I send him back with the news that he's pussy whipped
And packing all his shit
You thought you had that locked
But now I push his Lex truck up and down the block
Cheddar knots, ice rocks, hands get frost bite
Shopping sprees to Loisviller after just one night
Nothing nice, boss skills in the b-e-d
Close your shop once my legs spread a quarter to three
The biggest Mama sippin Mo
Still running the show
Got your man on a mission body ?? my dough
Hoe you don't know if ya coming or going
Look at you face, the jealousy's glowing
And showing, don't player hate
Get your shit tight
I flow bolo so so unladylike
On the mic think twice this bitch ain't no joke
I'll stomp your ass like a southern cockroach
For short, I'm the hoe who spoiled your wedding plan
Peep us walk hand in hand bitch
Me and your man

I'll take yo man
Ya fiancee your husband
The niggas you sweating and all your fuck friends
And when I say I will you know I can
Don't fuck with me
Cause I'll take yo man

I'll take yo man
Fucking right, just for spite
Cause you's amongst a many bitches that I do not like
But I really don't want him
That nigga just a rep hunter
I'm only doing it to get up under
Yo skin, show you that your nigga dicking
Me, talking bout the things he can do for me
Please me, spoil me rotten
The feelings that he had for you they are forgotten
While I'm plotting on the Swiss and the cheddar
The better bitch
The clever bitch that any weather shit together bitch
Handles your nigga like a rookie
Got his mind got his money
Got his face in my pussy
A licky licky
Ride him like a pony
Act a fool his dick don't get hard for you
No more whore got you with a headache
Blowing up his pager trying to plead your case
To late ya x'd out its best you understand
You ain't shit no more
I got yo man

I'll take yo man
Ya fiancee your husband
The niggas you sweating and all your fuck friends
And when I say I will you know I can
Don't fuck with me
Cause I'll take yo man

Most broads have niggas that love to hold
You be at my show on the very fisrt row
I flipped the script macked his game plan
(Biggest Mama your with this Macho Man)
Now you know I know I got your
Man, check him out you see what I mean
Tricking all this cream
Even his niggas scream
(Go Mia its your world Go Mia its your world)
Its so easy to get involved with this sister
Ain't no ifs or buts, ask your nigga
Pussy be the bomb, cause my game is cool
Its non-speculation
Your nigga said so
Revenge is sweet, but payback's a trip
Dumb bitch, you won't know which is which
But I'll tell you this
Don't try and step to this jam
Because if you do than I'll take your
And I'll take your and I'll break your
Man
