[Intro]
I came here tonight to settle the score
Females are women and girls, not bitches and hoes
To all the niggas that's stunting off the weak-ass rhymes
It's payback time

[Verse 1]
So what up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, what up, what up, what up

Niggas all around that's dissing the women
I came to get you straight cause I mean it yes to win it
I tried to let you slide, but now I'm getting pissed
Mia X is in effect so don't be starting no shit
Now, "Suck a nigga dick for an outfit"?
And, "Suck a nigga dick for some K-Swiss"?
Well, eat a lady's pussy for a home-cooked meal
And blow the ass for a 40, bitch
Lying on your dick non-stop
That's something that a woman just crams to understand
You ain't seen no guts, don't get no guts
The closest thing to some pussy is your hand
"Biggity-bounce, baby, bounce"? Bitch, I ain't no ball
You get excited if I ride it, but your dick too small
Doing damage to my backbone? Please!
You're barely tickling the walls -- bitch, you're just a tease
And make my pussy scream for a six-inch dick?
I'm pushing eight-pound babies, so you talking shit
Ride that dick with a boot in my mouth?
You get the gat for the cat cause I wear your ass out
Leave your mind without a clue, thoughts without a trace
Just waiting for a turn for the pussy in your face
You said the pussy wasn't nothing but meat on the bone
Til you took a little stroll in a comfort zone

Nigga, stop talking that shit
You can't wear a pussy out with that weak-ass dick
I say nigga, stop talking that shit
You can't wear a pussy out with that weak-ass dick
Now why your dick so small?
Cause your nuts look like chiny balls, bitch
Now why your dick so small?
Cause your nuts look like chiny balls
Well, I didn't get no nut, nigga
So you can't get your fucking hair cut, nigga
I say, I didn't get no nut
So you can't get your fucking hair cut

[Verse 2]
I met this nigga, his name was Duke
The bitch tried to take me to the Rochambeau
I said, "Cheap motherfucker, better come again
And let's mosey on over to La Quinta Inn"
When we got in the room, he started to stunt
He said, "I'ma bring the noise to your little cunt"
So when he pulled down his pants and introduced me to cat
All I could say is, "Where it's at, where it's at"
The dick was small, he had no balls
I said, "You ain't doing damage, no damage at all
Lay back and let me do that right"
I made him shake, shiver, scream, wiggle, moan, and cry
You know, the nigga couldn't hang like I already knew
Made him pay me three bills, took the car keys too
Pulled up and blowed for Bunny and Mice
Rolled through the Calliope, wasn't nothing nice
A nigga said he was starving, needed his hair cut
Well, get on your knees and lick this butt
Hardcore is what I am, coming at you correct
Cause niggas ain't worth the blood on your Kotex

Oops oops, got some hair in your teeth, bitch
You graduated from tits and now you're sucking clits
Oops oops, got some hair in your teeth, bitch
You graduated from tits and now you're sucking clits
Shake for the Third Ward, shake for the Fourth Ward
Shake and take his money
I said, shake for the Sixth Ward, shake for the Seventh Ward
Make him lick that honey
Shake for the Eighth Ward, shake for the Ninth Ward
Shake it girl, shake shake shake
Or just shake for the Tenth Ward, shake for the Twelfth
Let them put the dick it's in an earthquake
Shake for Hollygrove, shake for the West Bank
Shake for the projects too
Hop for your neighborhood, hop for New Orleans
Know the rough hunting niggas, this for you

[Verse 3]
I ain't popping for no stunters, I use my head
And pop this pussy for a mink instead
I don't want no Shoney's or Denny's
But we could wine and dine at Copeland's, please
I don't need four golds in my mouth
But you can put Louis the Fourteenth in my house
I want a herringbone set and I want a purse
Bitch, I want to do me in verse
Met another nigga but he didn't like rubbers
(What?!) So he couldn't be my lover
Practice safe sex and keep the coochie clean
Because a nigga might turn your shits purple and green
And all you niggas out there claiming you don't eat
Everybody knows that that's a L-I-E
But since your ass do lie, I wish your nose did grow
Cause it would please me much better than what you got below
So where they at, get the gat and bounce baby to this
Uh, real woman shit
Niggety-niggety-nigga, I need some gear
So hustle that money and bring it here
And niggety-niggety-nigga, you better move fast
Bring me that Explorer filled up with gas
And make sure it's clean when I rep
So don't give me no-no-no don't give me carpet no sack(?)
And if I meet another nigga bumping in his shit
The pussy-ass nigga gotta deal with it

Cause ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch
All the ladies say, ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch

Now, this young nigga, he had a Benz
He had a pocket full of ends
So I pussy-whipped that ding-a-ling-ding
Cause I'mma get paid for doing my thing
Call me a bitch, or even a slut
But nigga, you know you paid for the guts
So talk that shit with your fake punk ass
But don't forget to tell them how you tricked that cash

What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, trick up, what up, get up, what up

[Verse 4]
The Uptown women, they hauling fast
And quick to knock a motherfucker on his ass
The Downtown women got poison taste
You could smell our perfume when we walk in the place
Sassy and classy, but don't forget
With the blink of a eye, we'll handle a bitch
No medallion earrings, that's played-out shit
A bitch is down for a car and a tennis bracelet
I want Venaditi, not Polo
I want DKNY, and not Girbaud
I want Anne Klein tennis, bitch, not K-Swiss
So nigga, get on the corner and sling that shit
And if your ass get shot, that's what you get
But motherfucker, I want the disability check
Now, you could say that's cold, but that's the way it is
You gotta show a nigga that you're all about biz
I don't feel sorry when it comes to ends
I'll leave your ass for three days in a shitty Depends
Now that you're paralyzed, do what I told you to
And make that tongue work for you

A licky-licky-licky-sucky-slurp it-licky-sucky
Licky-sucky slurp it, lick it, do it, nigga
A licky-licky-licky-slurp it-sucky-licky-slurp it
Licky-sucky slurp it, lick it, do it, nigga

Ain't no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga
Cause a slurping motherfucker ain't shit
I say, ain't no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga
Cause a scary motherfucker ain't shit
And ain't no pussy like a high-priced pussy
Cause a no-budget pussy ain't shit
I say, ain't no pussy like a high-priced pussy
Cause a no-budget pussy ain't shit

So nigga, if you want a nut
You better dig in that pocket and trick up
And if you go around saying I suck that dick
You better tell them how you did that lick
All the ladies say, nigga, you want to get a nut
You better dig in that pocket and trick up
And if you go around saying I suck that dick
You better tell them how you did that lick

And all the niggas say, bitch, stop talking that shit
And keep them messy-ass hoes out my business
And if you keep on hanging with them hoes
You're gonna find your fucking ass solo
Say bitch, stop talking that shit
And keep them messy-ass hoes out my business
And if you keep on hanging with them hoes
You're gonna find your fucking ass solo

You got to be real to take care of your woman
You got to be real to take care of your children
You got to be real to take care of your mouth
You got to be real to keep your business in the South
So where the real niggas at, where the real niggas at?
Where ya at, peace me out, where ya at?
Where the real niggas at, where the real niggas at?
Where ya at, peace me out, where ya at?

You got to be real to take care of your children
You got to be real to stand by your man
You got to be real to dis a messy-ass ho
You got to be real to be down for yours
