I'm too young to get my Z's on
Get my cheese on while I'm here bang a bitch
And get my B's on tattoo weed and hennesy
Scream NO LIMIT to the enemy tryin' get my skrilla
That's why they label, tag me a young nigga drug dealer
And the FED's steady watchin' but a nigga makin' money
So the tank ain't stoppin'

How many niggas wanna ride with me

[C-Murder]

Respect my tattoos I pay my dues
Remember '89 when I made a nigga sing the blues
I was born and raised for this gangsta shit

My Pops say look 'em in the eye before I kill 'em

Now would you go to war for me (man you know I would)
Now would you kill for me (shit you know I would)
Now would you ride for me (no doubt you know I would)
Now would you die for me (why you ask me you know I could)
I wonder who will ride for me probably be true 'em
Never knew 'em but even though I was cool with 'em
At times his silly ways grew on me and see I don't
Know but time like moving slow and I'm TRU I'm
Gonna take my vest off and hit it's bout time to go
And see they got me ridin' with top dollar and challers
Niggas bout to get fuckin' smothered for crazy motherfuckers
Riders, homies, and brothers for my TRU niggas I'm gonna
Get my swerve on my serve on you wan't me come get me
You heard the soul I had a visual moment too tryin' to
Save 'em and a nigga still die but I'm gonna kill the
Motherfucker who said I'm not TRU and nigga still live
All the world catch a slug nigga catch a slug in the mud
See I'm a TRU thug and this is TRU love nigga what to
My real niggas blastin' toes and I'm gonna empty clip 'til
