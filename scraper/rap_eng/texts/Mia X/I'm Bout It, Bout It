[Intro: Master P]
Yeah ha, I could never turn my back nigga (Never)
I could never forget where I came from
This for all my muthafuckin' soldiers native of New Orleans
(Louisiana)
All you Tru soldiers, give it up for Richmond, California
(Puttin 'em on the map)
Put em up, represent, where you from? (Westside, southside)
Check out some of this down South shit though nigga

[Verse 1: Master P]
You bout it, I'm bout' it bout it
If you bout' it bout it, well, say you bout' it, bout it
I represent, where them killers hang
Third Ward, Calliope Projects, we got our own name
It's a small hood, but it's all good
And Mr. Rogers ain't got shit up on my neighborhood
I represent nothin' but G's (G's)
From Richmond, California all the way back to New Orleans
That murder capitol of the world, so fool watch your back
The mighty rise and clip but some tourist don't make it back
And niggas ain't trippin' on yo life G (Life G)
They ready to take your ass out before the count of 1, 2, 3
So give me your gold chain, what 'bout your gold ring
Niggas down south quick to put you in that body slang
I mean that body cast, ha ha, what 'bout that body bag
You ain't thank quick, that's why you on your ass
And niggas stuntin' perpetratin', talkin' shit
You roll through the projects, you might get your wig split
Mr crazy wanna borrow a quarter quarter
You best not fuck with them fools that gone on that water, water
I mean that clicker juice, formaldehyde (Dang like dat)
Whatever you want, the more they dip in cigarettes to get high
Like some alcohol, niggas don't even give a fuck
They leave you stuck in that muthafuckin' black truck
Break you off like some muthafuckin' Japanese (Damn)
Ain't no love in this hood, ain't no love for G's
And these niggas killin' bitches too
And these bitches settin' up niggas
Cause don't give a fuck about you
You gotta be bout it, bout it, cause I'm bout' it, bout it
Third Ward, Calliope Projects, you know they bout' it, bout it
And that Fourth Ward is bout' it, bout it

But I dunk a niggas head into a toilet full of piss
Cause in this drama field, fool we ain't takin' no shit
