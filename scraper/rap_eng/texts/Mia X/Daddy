[Intro: Mia X]
This song is dedicated to all the responsible brothers other there
Whos how love and support to their children
I'd like to say thank you
Cuz I have a very important man in my life
He means the world to me
He helped make into the strong woman I am today
I'm talkin about my Daddy

[Mia X]
I think back to the first time I messed up
You knew that I need to be
But you couldn't chastise me
Daddy's little girl
Most precious of all
You loved me more than anything
Your real life babydoll
Bounced me on your knee
Taught me how to throw my set up
Said you ain't got no brothers
Fight dirty
Don't take nothin
Saw you bustin your butt to keep the bills paid
Saw you hustlin for extras
For more pay you made a way
And tried to keep us happy up in the house
Cuz you wasn't tryin to see
Your queen or your princess pout
Doubtin out sometimes
But you tried to hide your pain
And be a tru playa in this white man's game
Never called my mama out of her name
Showed respect
Never put your hands on her
Even when she backed you in a corner
So Iwant to say you are appreciated
And this love song is dedicated to my daddy

[Chorus]
Thank you Daddy
I know that I'm blessed
To have a father like you
Cuz you've done your best
Under so much stress in the crazy world
God knows you tried
Even when they got your hands tied

[Mia X]
Remember when I came home seventeen and pregnant
And unexpectedly
But your disappointment never did show
You looked me in my teary eyes
Then you smiled
Put yoru arms around me
Said my baby's giving me a grandchild
Showed my boyfriend love too
Didn't come preachin or beefin
Just said you know what you gotta do
And when he didn't
You didn't rub it in
You just did his part
And tried to heal my young broken heart
I thought the things you said way back for certain
Was jus to try and keep me a virgin
But with all the hurtin and the drama I been through
I wish I would have listened to you
Cuz it was all true
Daddy the man who loves me unconditionally
Thru thick and thin
You'll always stand by me (fo sho)
Daddy I love you with all my heart
You're my souljah
My hero
My shining star
Thank you

[Chorus]

[Mia X]
I gotta give love to all the real strong brothers
Responsible daddies
Even if you're not with your baby's mothers
Your support
Your love and your time
Helps keep your children in the right frame of mind
And to the single fathers out there
Much respect
I'm a single parent too
So I know where you're at
And where you're coming from baby
But it's gonna get better
Hold your head through the stormy weather
And stand your ground firm
And all my sisters with good men at your side
It sure feels good to see the ??? family rise
I've cried joyful tears Happy as can be
To see man woman and child As one family
See the cards are stacked up against us y'all
So we gotta work it out Can't let em see us fall
But most of all Thank you God
Cuz for years I had an example of what a real man is
My daddy

[Chorus]

Oh I wanna thank you for all you've done for me
I wanna thank you
