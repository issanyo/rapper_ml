Chorus:

Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do
Silkk: And it's all because of you I know what hot girls do
Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do
Silkk: And it's all because of you I know what hot girls do

[Mia X]
It's all because of you
I know what hot boys do and that's why I don't trust 'em
I make sure it's all about me ain't even trying to love 'em
Cuz I know you're type hot boys don't wanna do right
Screwing everything then have the nerve to wanna have a good wife
Nah bump that baby get ya sneakers and ya beeper
Let the door knob hit ya
I bought this house ya heard me I'ma shine without ya mista
It's the biggest Mama Mia X independent bringing weight to
The table I'm financial stable and able
To let you know what I'm not gone tolerate
Pay for everything I got you can't throw shit
In my face wait a minute let me finish my name ain't Sparkle
No promises from ten years ??? only sees one kind of mista
On a mission paper chasing building things with a sister
I get caught up in my rapture ??? got you like a groupie
Gimp but you ain't getting inside ride with me
Oh no floss of my dough floss me on your arm
Boo I don't think so fantasize about the sex
Even lie on your I suck what rode who nah
I ain't that chick think yall can screw beaucoup hoes same time
Have a wife giving broads two bills they think they living the life
I rather stack my own digits make my world and spin in
And call you just another citizen living in it ya heard me?

Chorus:

Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do
Silkk: And it's all because of you I know what hot girls do
Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do
Silkk: And it's all because of you I know what hot girls do


[Silkk]
It's all because of you I know what women they do and umm...
Everything my homie said turned out to be tru
Either ya too easy or ya too greedy I can't figure it out
I'm like forget it who need it
If I wasn't Silkk the Shocker would like really try to sweat me
I always had girls but not like Halle and Vanessa
Calling me on three talking about how they gon' do me
Shit I love my fans but I ain't gone be messing with yall groupies
Or either you hoochies
Coming to my concert talking about
Silkk if you bout it you would and showing me they coochie
I'm like back up but see I might mess with em put my trust in em
I just trust em to be women ya heard me?
Now see my car and she was like I ain't got no plans
See my crib and stuff and she was like I ain't got no man
If I give her a gift she be like girl that fool is laying
If I give her a kiss she be like that's my man he love he just be playing
So I might give you a gift but don't think I'm a trick
I just like to treat real women like they my number one chick
But I know when a women ain't tru black
So when she mess up Ibe like I already knew that
You why cuz women do that ya heard me?

Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do
Silkk: And it's all because of you I know what hot girls do
Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do
Silkk: It's all be-cause of you I know what women do
Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do
Silkk: It's all because of you I know what women do
And everything homie said bout you was tru what
