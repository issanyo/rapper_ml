[Mercedes]
Even though I live my life on the edge sometimes
I know you love me, and I love you too
I believe in you
You made this possible, and I wanna thank you…

[Mo B. Dick]
You know I wanna thank you Lord for all your love
For another day you let me see, supply my needs
Even though I’m a G, you kept me free from the grip of police
And all these demons on these streets, you keep blessing me
You know I wanna thank you Lord for all your love
For another day you let me see, supply my needs
Even though I’m a G, you kept me free from the grip of police
And all these demons on these streets, you keep blessing me

[Mercedes]
For through You all things are possible
You gave me a gift, now the whole world knows
Thank you, oh…
Thank you, thank you

[Mia X]

I love You with all my heart
