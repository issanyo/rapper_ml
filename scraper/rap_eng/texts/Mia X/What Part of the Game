Mamma Mia & Monica (Oh, yeah)
The game is twisted (oh)
Won't you tell them ‘bout it, Mo?!

Let me tell you about these niggers I don't like (I don't like)
They ride around the 24s
With their mouth full of gold
But they choose to be out forward late at night
Riding hours spending dough
When they're tripping on them hoes

And another thing that baby just ain't right
Is these rubbers and these hater, those awful in capers
Did you ever think that it could end your life
Think twice, get it right
Or you have to pay the price
What part of the game

Chorus
What part of the game is this, oh
You claim to keep it real, but that just ain't the deal
What part of the game is this, oh
You gotta understand I feel just the way I feel
What part of the game is this, oh
You gotta pay your dues, don't be a fool
What part of the game is this, oh
And if you don't play by the rules you loose

Now let me tell you ‘bout these chicks I don't like
You walk in with your man they see you're holding hands
But they try to get up with him that's ain't nice
Saying you're ??? the one
Would you come and spend the night

And another thing that baby just ain't right
Is you wall in these clubs
Like you're about to bounce some luck
But the nigga just only wants you for one night
Set you up, cut/call you up
Got your feelings all hurt up
What part of the game is this?

Chorus
