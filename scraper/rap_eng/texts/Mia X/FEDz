[C-Murder and (Silkk the Shocker) talking]
Ha, ha what they say Mia? (Drug dealers)
Talkin' bout No Limit sellin' dope (All over the world)
They got ki's all over the country
CIA, Feds (All them)
Tap our phone (Jealous)
Harrassin' us (Fuckin' with us)
U know what I'm sayin? (Fuck em) but guess what...

[Chorus: Mia X]
If them Fedz only knew
That you were the one
Sellin' all the dope
What would they do?

If them Fedz only knew
That you were the one
Holdin' all them ki's

They would probably kick (probably kick)
In your door (in your door)
They would probably arrest you
And steal all your dope

So you should be glad (you should be glad)
That they don't know (they don't know)
Cause now you don't have to worry
Mm...

[C-Murder]
I'm talkin' to them F-E-Dz, police harrassin' me
But let me tell ya partner, you ain't never cared for C
I'm under surveillance and you done tapped my phone
But I'm not Michael, why don't you leave me alone
And stay away from my residence, lookin' for evidence
You act like a brother tryin' to kill a fuckin' president
Ya never find shit, my game's tight like the Bulls
Like a full tank of gas, my bank account's full
Word on street, C-Murder sellin' ki's, from overseas
What, you want it?
Nigga, please
You plottin' on a playa like a money hungry bitch (hoe)
Mad cause a nigga went from rags to riches
Slammin' Cadillac doors, it used to be a Regal
Stop lookin' for drug money
Cause now my shit's legal
If them feds only knew about my deals under the table
If them feds could only see I got mo' clients than cable
They'd probably kick, in my do'
And put me face down on tha motherfuckin' flo'
And take me to jail, but I'm out the next day
Cause niggas with lawyers, and money, don't play (we don't give a fuck)
D.A. tryin' to tie me to them underground casinos
Wanna connect me to the Mafia in Reno
Every step I take, every move I make
You punk motherfucker be watchin', fuck y'all

[Chorus: Mia X]
If them Fedz only knew
About them thugs
On the grind for you
What would they do?

If them Fedz could only see
How you be gettin' ki's
From overseas

They would probably kick (probably kick)
In your door (in your door)
They would probably arrest you
And steal all ya dope (steal your dope)

So you should be glad (you should be glad)
That they don't know (they don't know)
Cause now you don't have to worry

[Master P]
Unnnggghhhh, they call us drug dealers, what about the police
Just the other day my lil' homie scored a quarter ki
From the feds, tags got my phone tapped
Niggas went to Florida, the homie got kidnapped
Now the game is crazy, sometimes it's hectic
Make me wanna jump in the Benz and ride up to Texas
And ball with the niggas in the country
It's 1997, I'm tryin' to have hundreds
Stacked higher than buildings, flip it into millions
Rollin in a zillion, of ghetto children
Plushed out Lexus, niggas playin' taxes
Mansion with a Ferrari but the game is still hectic
Niggas bout to turn to snitches, money-hungry bitches
The Dayton Family said FBI, we call em' robocop snitches
Got me stressin' smokin' weed to keep my nerves calm
And I'm livin' in this rap game like Al Capone

[Chorus: Mia X]
If them Fedz only knew
That you got politicians on your payroll too
What would they do?

If them Fedz could only see
That you got CPA's
Washing all your cheese

They would probably kick
In your door
They would probably arrest you
And steal all ya dope

So you should be glad
That they don't know
Cause now you don't have to worry
Mm...

[Silkk the Shocker]
Now what if the feds only know, Silkk the Southside soldier
Post up, sold more cola than Coca-Cola
Now picture this, me ridin' in the drop-top Lex
On the block, with ya thot, then I roll up with the tech
See, I leave em' twisted like a Twizzler
My house have mo' stakeouts than Sizzler
But they don't understand a man, keep em' puzzled like the Riddler
And first thang first, if worse came to worst
They never catch me in the Lex, I use mo' rent-a-cars than Hertz
They can't understand, how they had me, but I still got away
License plate, out of state, in Jamaica the next day
Ain't tell the camera, caught em scanning
But I was ballin' in the manor
Nigga what?
Now, bitch I'ma get away in Louisiana
That's why I stay more untouchable than air y'all
They had me tapped
But that's why mobile phone get mo' time than airports
To them ATFs and Feds
Y'all don't understand I stay one step ahead
If y'all only knew

[Chorus: Mia X]
They would probably kick (probably kick)
In your door (in your door)
They would probably arrest you
And steal all your dope (steal your dope)

So you should be glad (you should be glad)
That they don't know (they don't know)
Cause now you don't have to worry (or do you?)
If them Fedz only knew

If them Fedz only knew
