My Lord, our father
There's so many things I need to say
And alot of people don't wanna hear it
But ya know what?
I'm a say it anyway

I thank you Lord for my life
Forgive me Lord for complaining so much
I thank you Lord for my life
Your the only one that understands my pain

I'm twenty three, I done seen the whole world rot
Every type of crime, loud cheers from the audience
They was jocking my style
Buck wild, doing my thang, fulfilling my dream
Shit, I remember thinking about back when I was a teen
I know I'm blessed, just having this tank around my chest
Cause every city that I been to homeless people facing death
I shed a tear, could never understand thier pain
Can't even shelter thier own families in the pouring rain
What did they do to deserve this life
Was it so horrible to make them serve a homeless night
Shit ain't right
Cause we eating, sleeping in good health
What we don't want we throw away, thinking only yourself
People need help, this generation we lost
Crying for what we want, not just crying for what we need
Men have to hunt just to feed
And we complaining bout bullshit
When we should thank him for the smaller things we did get

I thank you Lord for my life
Forgive me Lord for complaining so much
I thank you Lord for my life
Your the only one that understands my pain
I thank you Lord for my life
Forgive me Lord for complaining so much
I thank you Lord for my life
Your the only one that understands my pain

Father I thank you for granting me another day to open my eyes
So I can see my little boy and girl play
Pray for so many worldly things I lust and greed
Got us calling on you mostly when we think that we need something
And we be running to the Bible when we locked up
But when we free we tryin a tear the block up
Negativity's embedded in our brains along with the mental chains
That we wear thanks to the slave masters game
I came to humble myself, cause through your mercy and grace
I got my freedom, my health and my spiritual wealth
My faiths been tested many times, the devil's so busy
But you gave me strength to conquer evil, Lord I feel you in me
Please forgive me for the times I haven't been right
And God, I thank you for this precious gift, my life
I love you Lord

Lord
Me and Mia
We do this all for you

I thank you Lord for my life
Forgive me Lord for complaining so much
I thank you Lord for my life
See, I'm trying to teach the whole world
I thank you Lord for my life
Forgive me Lord for complaining so much
I thank you Lord for my life
Cause it's you that understands my pain

I hear people complain they fat but you blessed, people hungry
What you don't see those children on TV, starving and bony
You phony, would they complain if they could eat half that you eat
Or maybe sleep some of the places you sleep
I hear people complain they broke but you blessed cause you living
Better start thanking the Lord for the life that you was giving
Not a preacher but I'm preaching to the people I can reach
Tell 'em you say your prayers 'fore you fall asleep
If you ain't saying your prayers then you ain't getting no blessings
If you ain't getting no blessings, that's why your ass is stressing
I'm trying to teach a lesson, if you listen to the words I speak
You can see my Lord is the quickest way to get back on your feet
Parents should be teaching this just as soon as your born
Wouldn't matter it's out the Bible or the Holy Ahran
Everything is everything and my God is the beginning
With him, no losers, just winners

I thank you Lord for my life
Forgive me Lord for complaining so much
I thank you Lord for my life
You see I'm trying to teach the whole world
I thank you Lord for my life
Forgive me Lord for complaining so much
I thank you Lord for my life
You can truly understand my pain
I thank you Lord for my life

I mean, just think about it
Everybody in this world are sinners
It never matters to him
Because we all his children, you know what I'm saying?
Everybody here is capable
He's coming back someday yall for us
So you gotta straighten out your life, know what I'm saying?
Stop complaining about all the small things
Start waking up in the morning and thanking for things that you have
You know people that's blind
Will give up everything they have just to have sight
People with no fingers
Will give up everything they have just to have a hand
And you get up and you complain about small things
You can't pay a light bill
You can't put gas in your car
But your walking, your breathing
