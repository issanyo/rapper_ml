[Intro: Master P]
Yo, what's up Mean Green
This one here for everybody out there doing
They thug thing Major player Whether they
Grinding, hustling,  flipping things, ya'll know
What I mean

[Chorus: Master P]
If it don't fold, if it don't ching ching
Then you ain't a real soldier, if you can't maintain
If it don't fold, if it don't ching ching
Then you ain't a real soldier, if you can't maintain

[Mia X]
Now mama can't be compared to no other broad
Cause I spit that mental and keep (Shhh)
Them niggas  peeling off Franklins
Franky # 1, I'm on the force checks in my hands
Most demand to be man's thugs Mrs
I piss on all you so-called fire starters
And all you fakes claiming flow I'm known to touch
Your water I started with a quarter flip my way to six figures
Ground work down and dirty hustling like a nigga
I figured ain't no sense in sleeping if my kids ain't eating
And ain't no sense in you creeping if you ain't treating
I'm seeking dollars if you with me baby follow me
Trying to buy a key like it's a ticket out of poverty
But every key don't always open up a friendly door
On the other side might be the law so
Plain strategies clean your g's and keep it coming
Don't be another ghetto child hustling for nothing

[Chorus]

[Master P]
(Uhhhhhhh)
I'm a ball till I fall nigga pops wasn't home
Put it in a zip lock bag or either ride with the chrome
I thank god for my big cousin Jimmy nigga taught me how to hustle
See life is like a puzzle always in and out of trouble
From the jail to the street we hustle till we weak
From a quarter to a key nigga momma gotta eat
See this ghetto got me crazy
And if it wasn't for no limit could they pay me
Two million in the bank for the babies
Independent black owned is why they pay me

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
(What What What)
Now look dollars I'm trying to fold
Three keep me rolling like wheelchairs
See I'm from the south I love east and west
Just like I lived there Ran the streets with my thugs
Often I sold (Shhh) I'd be lying if I'm tell you i'm doing
This rap stuff strictly out of love I'm in it for the money
But ya'll can keep the fame and all that
Bitch let it be known that my name I bring like all that
Hate me that I got riches Hate that I got bigger
Even got picture of me flossing in drop 6s
I like to have things and I don't like to dream
Picture my benz riding rubber 20s so I put em on 19s
Aim high my dream house cost about 6 mil
I wanna step out the house cause I paid boy
About six bills No limit and mean green you gotta
Like respect our flow Respect our dough
Respect that we trying to get some more
Major players do what they want You haters
Do what ya'll can I'm trying to bury money
Understand For my real g's 100s and grams
See I'm a no limit soldier so I'm a represent
If it don't fold or ching ching, then it don't make sense

[Chorus]

[Porsha over Outro]
Major Players
Major Players
Major Players
Major Players
Major Players
Major Players

[Outro: Mean Green]
Yeah and there it is
What's up this is the Mean Green
Wanna explain to you about maintaining
Remember the days ya'll
Us black folks had love for each other
We wasn't jacking each other for cars and clothes
You know we was maintaining
We grew up in a materialistic ass world
Gotta get away from that
Now it's time for us soldiers to step up
Be proud to be who we are
As we groove into this new millenium
You know It's time for us to make our kids proud
Time to take care of our families like we supposed to
That's what's important Major players, well
We do what we want Haters, stand on the side
And do what they can And that is
