Sistas recognize no matter how you try to understand
To understand them
Oh noo you can't trust a man

Look here, I'm goin out with tha homies
And dont you even give me no lip like you own me
You want me couked up so you can do yo thang
But now it's time boot up and say some thangs gone change
Like when yo pager rangs
Whats up wit all these codes
You turn tha thang upside down readin stuff from yo hoes
I suppose thats why I got on my clothes
Gon have a dance
A drink or 2
And I ain't even trippin on you
Cause tha things you think is slick really ain't
You think you bein a playa
But looka here
Dude you can't
Cause I work everyday, but I dont pay nan bill
Sex you only when I want
And never do fix a meal
But on tha real
I be that pimpstriss, mackadame with game
Got tha mind playin
Met tha trick indeed to bring tha pain
Cause yo lame excuses
And yo tore up lies
Left you hanging wide open
And i ain't even tryin to cope wit
Yo mental cause it makes no sense
Thats why nothins goin on between us but tha rent
I spent alot of time tryna figure you out
But now I finally understand
You just can't trust no man


You can't trust a man ( why they always cheatin)
You can't trust a man ( why they mess up tha way they do)
You can't trust a man ( why they always cheatin)
You can't trust a man  (You can't trust a man)

As long as a trick comes fallin down
It gives me all motion to keep my suit fo tha clown
I'se be like get on down
Boy get on down
I'm hella known fo my strut through my town
Suga T here I be its me
Momma always told me dont nathin come free
They ain't shh
We knows how it goes
Always tryna come up on tha rolly hoes
But tha skys tha limit
I keeps my hmm sewed up
They backs up off tha hmm
Because I'm tryna make a buck
Chuggin tha lug cause i be down wit da funkin
Niggas be on my jock like a tree be on tha stump
Packin junk in my trunk
Must i buck em
Callin me all on tha top notch to bust some
Lyrical master in tha front
Be on this rap scene
Who do I be
Cause i be that tool with tha classy
Breakin em down
Shakin em up gettin em stuck
Supa bad and ain't givin a fuck
No love No lust
Cause thats tha way it goes
Cause they ain't shh

Chorus
(bridge)
You tear me up on tha inside
I hope my hardhead understands
Cause I can't trust no man

Damn even though he's a trip
It's hard to let go cause I'm used to his tricks
I'm scared to find anotha deal with his habits
That might even turn out to be more drastic
I'm mackin and he's ackin on his p's and q's
But fo how long fo real until I get tha blues again
I miss makin dinner fo 2
Candelight, bubble bath and tha rendevous
But I do know i ain't lettin him have his cake
And his ice cream while he eats his steak
I mean I ain't down to share no I can't understand
Some otha chick up in tha mix wit my man
So I'm bounce just to let him see
That if I can't trust him then he can't be with me

Chorus until end
