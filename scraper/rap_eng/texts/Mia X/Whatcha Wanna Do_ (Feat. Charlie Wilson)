Momma got sum education for ya young ass shakers
If it's on his mind make him mash dat wit sum cash
Fakers stay up in da club try ta speak dat weak game
Don't be tryin to show no love
Nigga fuck your pocket change
See it's a new day and a new situation
Started off flashing 20's in your safe combination
Same nigga dats livin dat ballin life
Could be dat same nigga dat make a lap dance of his wife
Keep your combo tight
And every line so smooth

Den why you dancin den?
I'm payin my way through school
A golden gurl smile
Maken dem ends and I
Fuck around and get a doctor or a lawyer tunite
High maintenence bitches

But we'll go down and suck tha life up outta that thang
For sho now

This lightened touch gon make you melt
Cuz we dancin for tha benjamins and fuckn for tha Roosevelts

Gun smoke in the air
