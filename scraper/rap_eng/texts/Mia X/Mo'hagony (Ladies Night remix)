It's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representin' like it's ladies night
Comin' right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful
Sportin' hot pink
Rocks in the link
In the drop with a mink
Like my ??? don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm
Blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passin'
Breakin' you down like fractions
While we be rappin' about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it happen
With mademouselle from gezals to versace
With a sweet smell
This female leadin' the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will let the champagne spill
Is it a mans thing for real
Can us girls roll wit yall
What the deal

Hook

(Missy Elliott)
Freak-a-freak (x4)
Do you know how I do?
Can your foot fit into a shoe?
Can your toe play it tight wit my doe?
Can the crap you talk be true to
Or do you do like a do?
Do you smoke weed like me?
Or do you love peeps like me?
Is yo game as tight as me?
Is your name M-I-S-S-E
Or do you make misdemenor's
Cause yo woman has a weener
