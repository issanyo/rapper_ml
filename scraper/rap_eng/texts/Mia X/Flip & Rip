[DJ KLC]
Yo Mia.  I got the firest beat and I want you and Mac to bust off it
So who goin first?
[Mia X]
It don't matter to me, Boo
[DJ KLC]
Well, we gone flip for it.  Call it in the air
[Mia X]
Heads
[Mac]
Tails
[Mia X]
Mac, you up first
[Mac]
Say, KL.  Since I gotta go first and shit I'ma kick this shit one more time
For the old fake ass niggas who thought I lost it.  Ya heard me?  Check it

[Mac]
Street camo Cover my flesh
I'm one of the best in the contests
They steppin to Mac without a vest on they chest
If all you wanted was rest Then I'm your Nyquil guy
Your night time sniffin and stuffiness I kill with one shot
The murder murder verses Quench lunatic's thirsts
I get pussy from nurses Comin from churches
The camouflage A-S-S A-S-S I-N I'm deadlier with my pen
Then niggas with the mac 10 But that was back then
In 98 I'm strapped Cuz I'm on the map
Ain't afraid to bust a cap And I get paid for bustin raps
I like them ghetto girls Y'all can have them super models
Cuz gangsta bitches got bodies like Coke bottles
I get the game from my nigga V9 I get the beats off the 3-9
Them niggas can't see mine I'm lyrically a therapist
A fuckin terrorist Boom Boom! I never miss I'm on the next level

[Chorus: Mia X and Mac]
Well I'ma flip it like this
And I'ma rip it like that
And I'ma rip it like that
And I'ma flip it like this

[Mia X]
When the smoke clears I'ma still be here nigga
Mic in my hand Rowdy doin the rip the rapper dance
I set the lines behind the fallen emcees that challenge me
You cross my path You gets flipped in my wrath
The aftermath left bitches quiet as fuck
Like when the neighbors saw the crim and the cops came up
I rips it up from the gut Like Jack the Shanka Man
Chasin hoes down with the knife in his hand
The better man's gone be Mama And you know this nigga
On the top or the bottom I'ma show this nigga
He's goin to sleep I'm too deep The lady alligator
Stick your seven inches in the swamp And I'ma fade ya
I made you motherfuckers recognize the south
For the gumbo flava comin out my mouth
About drama Bout paper Bout settin it off
Fuck the verbal fantasies My shit is real y'all

[Chorus: X4]

[Mac]
Pass me the mic And let me dig into they chests
Like AK bullets through they proof vests
In a shootin fest I murder emcees like media
Mac the street encyclopedia Who wanna test me?
Bless me with somethin knottin
Bitches who start pussy poppin
Rhyme I quote em Nines I told em Like wallets
I'm rock solid And I like it when they suck and swallow it
I'm hardcore Fuck that slangin and shit Cuz when I'm on the mic Niggas be bangin and shit

[Mia]
I love them buck wild crowds
Mama be center stage
Throwin lyrics at them niggas
Like hand grenades
You can' take the projects out of a bitch like me
Six figures make me throw bigger block parties
Still warm my bed with a thug nigga of course (fo sho)
Still in the mix with all them messy ass hoes
Still bust a freestyle with my camouflage son
Off top, then leave the studio with my gun cocked
What?!
