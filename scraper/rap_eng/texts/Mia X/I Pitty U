Damn, this shit is cold
No matter how hard you try to come up
There's always a motherfucker who got their foot in your back
These days a few motherfuckers
I mean there's more haters than soldiers and playas
Trying to understand whats going on
Niggas trippin, white folks slithereing around
I pitty all them sad motherfuckers

Who you trying to see bitch
Acting like you know me
You don't even wanta run up on this biggest mama don-es
Push the bomber shit out the back door
Crack, china and herb headed straight to the suburb
Ain't nothin changed but the route my Legend takes
To shake the crooks that's out to to stick me for my papes
I hate to make my hollow tips follow the red beam
But I can't let you hatas steal my dreams
I'm duckin sireens, daily
Cause crooked officers is known to take your
Cheddar cheese right up off of you
I'm warning ya
Flamboyant niggas and bitches, high-sidin them illicit riches
I bear witness to the way they kicked in the front door
Slam me on the floor, steel up against my temple
Beatin on my man and callin us outloud names
This type of shit ain't gonna never change
It's all in the game
Ghetto thang got my name ringin way in your hood
I'm paranoid but at the same time wishing you would
Test me
Cause you gonna get handled
Your corpse will dangle from a magnolia tree
As an example, I trample the many in my life time
I aints boastin, but if you cross me
Me and my niggas will be posted up, to tear shit up
Straight casket stuff
Nonstop cause we ain't trying to hear the word enough

I pitty you and your whole crew
Trying to see me and the T-R-U gorilla squad
I don't give a fuck how many
Bet every penny
The tank won't leave any to tell about it
I pitty you and your whole crew
Trying to see me and the T-R-U gorilla squad
I don't give a fuck how many
Bet every penny
The tank won't leave any to tell about it

Ya'll heard of No Limit
So ya'll know I'm about the power moves we pullin
Dping the type of shit
That you Uncle Tom's wouldn't even think about
So nigga stay in your place
Before thise Down South Hustlers invade your space and take it
We know you're hatin on us and wanta see us at the bottom
Plottin at the same time the fedz is watchin
Trying to catch something, but they can't
Why ya'll trying to bring a jeep to war against the tank
Just paint a cleaner picture about this family and you will see
Mama on the throne and soldiers kissin my finky ice
Nothin nice, full blown connects
Seen alot of blood spilled behind my family's respect
Check the rap sheets, they ain't hard to find
Attempt convictions but nothin stickin
Against this click
And the tru mission's almost complete
We about to have this industry at our feet
Slaughter the week and shine on all you envious hoes
I'm gettin mine while you knuckleheads is chasin fools
Those who got the nerve to spit viscious
Yea I heard ya
But abortion is the only type of murder
You bitches can tell them niggas stop rightin your wrongs
Cause real bitches speak their own mind
I pitty you and don't come unless you slangin some mine
Cause we trying to dead your whole crew
I pitty

Pitty is from the bottom of my heart
Annialation is a promise
If you stop to mama Mia
No Limit, my TRU family
You better know this

I pitty you and your whole crew
Trying to see me and the T-R-U gorilla squad
I don't give a fuck how many
Bet every penny
The tank won't leave any to tell about it
I pitty you and your whole crew
Trying to see me and the T-R-U gorilla squad
I don't give a fuck how many
Bet every penny
The tank won't leave any to tell about it
I pitty you and your whole crew
Trying to see me and the T-R-U gorilla squad
I don't give a fuck how many
Bet every penny
The tank won't leave any to tell about it
I pitty you and your whole crew
Trying to see me and the T-R-U gorilla squad
I don't give a fuck how many
Bet every penny
The tank won't leave any to tell about it
