[Chorus: x4]

[Starts overlapping on the 2nd line of 1st said]
I want it
You got it
Let me get it out so nigga you drop it
I can't stop it
There's not stoppin me
The fuckin war keeps fuckin with my mind is shit

[Soulja Slim & Mia X]
So dig deep into the mind of that wild magnolia
It's Jack Hoise once again
In the non-streaked floors
Puttin miles on this bitch from here to Texas
Check it
Down South Hittin Hustlers nigga, Respect it
Fuck takin your Lexus
I'll burn that bitch up
Then go get couple of Gs from you
Then go buy me a Truck
Nigga what the Fuck
This Shit be real
Like the front of my grill
Nuthin false fake niggas getting tossed like sam
Who fronted me with a couple of grams of that smack
Now whatdoya know I didn't even have a quarter jack
Two weeks a nigga came back
I seen him 'fore he seen me
Hunt him down with that infared beam See
I been made a plan
Dogs seen a many snappin
Duck in a long driveway with a rock when I'm ready to hold 'em for ransom
I'm gonna get mine, just like they're gonna get theirs
I got grounds of shit
I want it
But u got it Bitch

[Chorus: x4]
If I really really want it
Then I'ma get it
Cause you got it

Let me get it out so nigga you drop it

There's not stoppin me
The fuckin war keeps fuckin with my mind is shit

If you a rhymer you can catch me
On the six in a circle
Ain't got [?] of a nigga that'll be down and Fuckin twerkya
Hurt yo ass with these hot bullets that I call Black Townie
Or I might play that game rollin and make that 500 townies
If you got it, then I want it thats the name of my game
It ain't lame
Ask Somebody and they'll tell you the same
Fuck that checkin a nigga foundin blood
Then Nigga come check me
If u don't get killed
You gonna get Stomped
You gonna respect me
I'm the jolly green giant with the weed resin in my mouth
Camoflauge down when I say green
With an assult rife machine
Still got the papers on that
Bought it for 10 Zacks
And smack
Got the Papers on my Mack
[?]
Better watch out
Our bullets ain't got no name
And you might get yo wigs bitch
And the box and the soaps standin cause I don't give a shit
So design between my eyebrows
So you know I'm Bout Drama
Cause I've been like that since i was younger
So you can go and ask momma (ask me)
Nuthin like Jeffery Domner
My bullets be eatin Human flesh
If you Got it
Then I want it
Now get this shit off my chest

[Chorus x4]
If I really really want it
Then I'ma get it
Cause you got it
(Starts overlapping on the 2nd line of 1st said)

You got it
Let me get it out so nigga you drop it
I can't stop it
There's not stoppin me
The fuckin war keeps fuckin with my mind is shit

[Mia X]
Who's that all up in my Business
Tryin 2 get my riches
Jealous Bitches
Watch me cock this big dick
POW nobody now chow
Now u can play if you wanna
But I warn you if I wantcha nigga
Pick a pearl, Hallway hit ya
With the head a whole block
Ducking tight for artillery
Now where ya gon' live
When you come across that ride
And she gon' be that same old smiling way
[?] misbehavin waitin
For that nigga who think he gonna snatch that Momma
There ain't no damn fucking way that he don't want that drama
Now bring yo own click
And even bring the equip
And we gonna pile up on that ass like a slave ship
Cause I got it
And you want it
But I'm a ball-hog bitch so I'ma flaunt it
So run up on it
And get yo dome split
Cause I ain't leavin much fakin for that chrome bitch
Cause ain't nobody gonna take what I work for
What my pussy twerked for
Gimme high blunts Slim
Them niggas got a hell of a nerve
Wantin mine til I take yours

[Chorus x4]

I want it
You got it
Let me get it out so nigga you drop it
I can't stop it
There's not stoppin me
The fuckin war keeps fuckin with my mind is shit
