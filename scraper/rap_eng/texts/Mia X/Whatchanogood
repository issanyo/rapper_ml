Welcome to Joe's Cozy Corner
Home of The Silent Devils And The Young Fellas
It's your host Dick Hurse
Tonight we got Mama Mia and Craig B and the Funk Nasty Band
Asking ya'll whatchanogood?
Whatchanogood?
Boy get your hand out of that girls skirt, I see it

[Mia X]
C'mon, I was going down, baby let me know real quick
Now who you wanna fuck, who you wanna like with, huh
The niggas over yapping, them bitches out there betting or their dough
High then them bitches going to give me it back
Ass going all nonsense, common sense bitch
Mama striaght from the streets but I chose to retreat
Wha, and elivate my mind, right rhyming, spit game
Let the cocaine rise cause I don't need 'em migrains
Shake names, straight niggas or the sticky situations
New crowds, I play dumb but still I spray 'em
Mysterious Mia X, infamous dangerous
No Limit gorillas bust, foolish that ain't us
My ways, they stay the same
Either I love you or hate you, I diss you or date you
I make you or break you, play you when you play me, an eye for an eye
Treat muthafuckers the same way that I wanna be treated
I'm open, eat it up, lick it
But the condom on and hit it when I'm hot

When I'm not get the fuck from around me yo
Cause do it on my main concern is dough
Tell 'em clowns yo
Get the fuck from around me yo
Cause do it on my main concern is dough
Whatchanogood
Give me the hook ya'll

True niggas and my true bitches
I ain't never gonna tolerate the foolishness
Now wave it air, ha, whatchanogood
For all my soldiers trying to shine in the hood
C'mon ya'll
True niggas and my true bitches
I ain't never gonna tolerate the foolishness
Now wave it air, ha, whatchanogood
For all my soldiers trying to shine in the hood
C'mon ya'll

My independant biches grabbin' glasses, get 'em up I say
I'm coming through with the hen and the alazay
Baller broad, no doubt, pissing straight, with style
Before I'm thirty I'm a buy my third house
Take it out cause, yours is yours, and mine is mine nigga
In other words I don't need no nigga
Figures is high six, and gangin' like my lynch
Degreeded compliant licks with haters gon' die quick
The figures with fly bitch is me at the dinesh
Your hieness, queen of the South, droppin' bomb shit
You dime bitches don't wanna go there
You knuckle heads ain't a fueded hair on my black panther
I step tagged, got it ready for you totes
Represent the true bitches gettin' theirs and mo
Show a nigga it's good for conversation it would
Now throw a nut, take the leash off and what
That's how you do it ya'll
Times is hard and life's a bitch so we can't entertain the foolishness
Be bout your work

Floss the jewels, push the six, sip the cris, but buy the house first
Whatchanogood
Floss the jewels, push the six, sip the cris, but buy the house first
Whatchanogood

C'mon now, whatchanogood, whatchanogood

True niggas and my true bitches
I ain't never gonna tolerate the foolishness
Now wave it air, ha, whatchanogood
For all my soldiers trying to shine in the hood
C'mon ya'll
True niggas and my true bitches
I ain't never gonna tolerate the foolishness
Now wave it air, ha, whatchanogood
For all my soldiers trying to shine in the hood
C'mon ya'll
