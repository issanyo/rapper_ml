Call all the sexy girls come out one by one
Tall, short , fat or skinny
Come out one by one

No man test the boy
Mr giving you all you require

Attention! Stand !
They wanna see nobody dulling
Stand up , ke jo o
My guy no forming
Maleek berry on this
And I'm killing dis beat
Freaky, freaky
Dj put on repeat
In my world everyday is a holiday
Real bad gyals dem follow me
All of my guys get girls for free
When we turn up
The girls undress for we
Rozay, hennessy and the sex for free
The sexiest girl come dance for me
Say all of my guys get girls for free
When we turn up
The girls con dress for we
Rozay, hennessy and the sex for free
The sexiest girl come dance for me
