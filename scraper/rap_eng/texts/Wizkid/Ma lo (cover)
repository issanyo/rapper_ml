Tell me where you going,where you go old lady?

VERSE
You can feel my heart,you can see my heart
Pounding everday like couple of hundred times
Had to facetime you twice the other Night
Your nigga picked the call said "never call her back"
Now i just sit,write all the night
Need to find a way to win you back in my life
I fell like a loser,felt like a mess
Feelings everday,nigga left in distress
Couldn't concentrate on my test in class
Be my baby girl,come give me one more chance
We go winning,we go winning slow
Be my girl,be my girl,you!
Not too far,stay so close
I'm still comming to get you tho
