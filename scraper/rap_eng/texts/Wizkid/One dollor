Wizkid i won't change am still the same is better than nothing
Am stil from the ghetto from my pain
And the devils are sucking my blood

Make i confess, i be don yes
You want contest, it be nonsence
Many brothers, them they want vex
They just curse the thing God bless
You see them young girls, they want flex
We will crush them from some corners
And make them shout oh yes..... demma mothers
But lets be honest,i be the hottest
Many dollars in my in my pocket
Many bitches they want sex
Planty rubbers in my pocket
Imagine the concept in the concert
They just want step for my converse
And for my wall self, it is problem
So so coments for my audience

She gives me more heard till her jaws hurt

And i know that am not ugly but am beautiful

With the flat pocket , oh brothers
