[Verse 1: Melissa]
You and me, we've grown together
Grew up in the same town
Used to kick it on the roads together
Till the new breed harboured around
And then you call my name
And tell me all the ways that I could drive a man insane
But it won't stop, my tears drop
Cause I love you

[Pre-Chorus: Melissa]
You take a woman [?]
Control me, I'm paralyzed
And there's no escape from your sight
Is this right? Is this right?

[Chorus: Melissa]
Cause we're burning down, and I won't be to blame
So go call the fire brigade, cause I don't want all this on my name
Yeah, we're burning, burning, burning, burning down
Yeah, we're burning, burning, burning, burning down

[Verse 2: Melissa]
Sick and tired of the stories all filled with glory
The ties of wherever that he goes
And now all that is left are his lies and deception
It captures the heart of the people
And no, me never love a man who manipulates like that
And no, me never love a man who manipulates like that

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Wizkid]
So babygirl, I know the things I've done to you will make you leave me one day
So babygirl, I know the things I've done to you will make you leave me some day
And if you ever change your mind, babygirl I will be here for you
Cause I feel low, I still feel real low
So babygirl, we used to run the town, but now you wanna burn it down
I know I told you I would hold you down, so my baby, don't burn it down
I wanna take away the frown, change my ways and hold you down
Please let me bring back your smile, oh, my baby, don't burn it down

[Chorus]
