[Verse 1: Patoranking]
I don't know why your love a di ting wey me think 'bout
5-star treating you giving your gal, me nah don't
Unto me time, yes mi gonna devote
L.O.V.E. me love you gal full boat

Anything you want gal you can order
Me love you me nuh need another
So tell the girl dem not to bother
Across the ocean, across the border
You worth more than a billion dollar
Straight down to Addis-Ababa
This kind luv has taken us further
Nobody test gal, no badder

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Patoranking]
They can say what they wanna say
(Say what they wanna say)
They can do what they wanna do
(Do what they wanna do)
No matter what the hater's say
I still get my eyes on you
Gonna be with you even if they say na taboo (taboo)
All my skin I go draw your tattoo
Girl you make my life turn brand new
If me have to choose
Me gwan chose another you

Gonna be with you even if they say na taboo (taboo)
All my skin I go draw your tattoo
Girl you make my life turn brand new
If me have to choose
Me gwan chose another you

[Hook]

[Chorus]
