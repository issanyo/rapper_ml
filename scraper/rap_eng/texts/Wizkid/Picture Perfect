[Verse 1]
Let them keep on talking girl we send nobody
They'll keep on talking but I want nobody nah
Let them keep on talking girl you know I want it
Girl it's a given that I always need you more
I'll put a ring on it cause I don't wan't you gone
And when they talk just tell them this your favourite song
Girl no lies no lies
I want it all night, yeah

[Hook]
I can feel the wave
I can feel the wave
Omoge watch your shoulder
See as she fine like picture kodak
I can feel the wave

Omoge watch your shoulder
See as she fine like picture showed her
Whine am, oooouie
My girl just whine up, run it
Whine up, oooouie

[Verse 2]
My girl just let your body touch up on my body
Feel the music let it put you in the zone
Let nobody come and mess up our vibe
I thought we were meant to be?
You have to stay mine

[Hook]
I can feel the wave
