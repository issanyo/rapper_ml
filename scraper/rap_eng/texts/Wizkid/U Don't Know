[Verse 1: Justine Skye]
Boo, what you tryna prove?
Can we just talk about it?
Got nothin' left to lose
But you still walk around it
And I'm the one who chooses
To still wonder 'bout you
I think I know the truth
But sometimes I doubt it

[Pre-Chorus: Justine Skye]
And I'm afraid it'll hurt when I finally fall down
'Cause the weight of my world's in the palm of your hands now

[Chorus: Justine Skye]
But you don't know it
You don't know it
You don't know it
You don't even know it

[Verse 2: Justine Skye]
I try to keep my cool, but it's too hard to tell if
You played me for a fool or your heart finally felt it
And you're the one who's losin', you're too fuckin' selfish
I didn't wanna do this, but I just can't help it

[Pre-Chorus: Justine Skye]
And I'm afraid it'll hurt when I finally fall down
'Cause the weight of my world's in the palm of your hands now

[Chorus: Justine Skye]
But you don't know it
You don't know it, you don't know it
You don't know it
You don't even know it

[Verse 3: Wizkid]
If you wanna leave, my girl, you better leave
I really got a lot to offer, please
She said she stay, abeg don't bother, please
I got your message, baby, don't repeat
I know your body murder but baby chill
You ain't that special, baby, don't believe
'Cause what we have is never meant to be
No disrespect, but you set the tone

[Pre-Chorus: Justine Skye & Wizkid]
And I'm afraid it'll hurt when I finally fall down
Sing for me, gyal
'Cause the weight of my world's in the palm of your hands now

[Chorus: Justine Skye & Wizkid]
But you don't know it
Me no know, me no know
My gyal, you like to know
You don't know it
Me no know, me no know
My gyal, you need to know
You don't know it (Hey, hey)
You don't even know it
Me no know, me no know
My gyal, you need to know

[Outro: Justine Skye & Wizkid]
Yo, yo
International flexin'
You don't even know it
You don't know it
