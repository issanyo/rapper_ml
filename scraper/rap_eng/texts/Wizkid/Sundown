[Intro: Wizkid]
Get on the bounce
All night long
Get on the bounce
Oh, get on the bounce, ah

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
Don't check your time
Time, time, time
Should be me that you're watchin'
What's on your mind?
Mind, mind, mind
Say you can't keep me off it
Lips might lie
Lie, lie, lie
But my heart beatin' honest
But my heart beatin' honest

[Pre-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
So can't we love now?
'Cause I don't, I don't wanna wait until the sundown (sundown)
So can't we love now?
'Cause I don't, I don't wanna wait until the sundown (sundown)

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown, no
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown, no

[Refrain: Wizkid]
Get on the bounce
Uh-huh, all night long
Uh-huh-huh, get on the bounce
Oh, get on the bounce, ah

[Verse 2: Zara Larsson + Wizkid]
Keep holdin' on
On, on, on
'Cause I'm fallin' for you now
(Sing, pretty gal)
Got me so gone
Gone, gone, gone
There ain’t no turnin' back now
(Oh, yeah)
Can’t be wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong
The way I’m feelin' right now
The way I’m feelin' right now, yeah

[Verse 3: Wizkid]
Yo, I tell ya 911, gal, ring the alarm
When you need me, gal, call mi phone
I wouldn't leave you on your own, babe
See when you touch me, gal, see me no one go
No other man, see me no one know
Baby gal, I feel it in my head

[Pre-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
So can't we love now?
'Cause I don't, I don't wanna wait until the sundown (sundown)
So can't we love now?
'Cause I don't, I don't wanna wait until the sundown (sundown)

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown, no
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown
Don't wanna wait 'til sundown, no

[Breakdown: Wizkid]
Get on the bounce, ya
Get on the bounce, get on the bounce
Oh, get on the bounce, my baby gal
Come get on the bounce, ya
Come get on the bounce, gal

[Bridge: Zara Larsson]
Now, I want it in the mornin', in the mornin'
In the middle of the day
Oh, baby, 'cause at midnight, yeah, midnight seems too far away
I want it in the mornin', in the mornin'
In the middle of the day
Oh, baby, 'cause at midnight, yeah, midnight seems too far away

[Outro: Zara Larsson]
So can't we love now?
'Cause I don't, I don't wanna wait until the sundown (sundown)
So can't we love now?
'Cause I don't, I don't wanna wait until the sundown
