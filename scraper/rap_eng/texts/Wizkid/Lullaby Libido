Ya little sexy ass....

Napoleon Da Legend [verse 1]
Huh u the Lullaby for my libido
U know ya body lit u don’t gotta to lie to me tho
Want us to light it up then lea(ve) the game like Carlito
Leave tha car in the lot and take the car with me tho
Huh got my hand on ya thigh muscle
That liquor got our mind buzzing
Now u rubbing on my back huh ?
On my leg now u seeing that I pack huh?
We can get it over easy
Book us a flight take it over seas (e)
Order breakfast grits and eggs over easy
Late night backstage baby come see me

I don’t mean to disrespect ya
But I was tipsy when I texted ya
Looking at ya story
On IG it got me horny
I’m looking at your different now and
I’m checking out ya pictures now
Too prideful to leave a comment
But I really like u to be honest
So I slide up in the DM's damn
Drawing up a line the sand
U send a reply it’s on
If not peace sign I’m gone
