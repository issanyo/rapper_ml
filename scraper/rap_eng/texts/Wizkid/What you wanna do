Reppin the eme-zy baby

I wanna go out and have some fun tonight ey
Call up my boy Skales and say my man Banky
Lets go chill and party
It's our year no worries
DJ play my song, Let it play all night long
EME-zy in the building
I wanna dance all night long
I don't care what you're feeling

It's my year no worries

Chill, go slow my lady
There is no need to go

Please wind it slow my lady
You making me lose control
Ease go low my lady
And just wind it for me

Go low, go low, go low, go low
