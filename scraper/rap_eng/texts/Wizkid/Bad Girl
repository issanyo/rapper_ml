Seen the rude girl in a beemer
With Lisa
And her sister
She a classic
She eat up
To see her you wan need a visa
Oliver Kahn
She a keeper

She got a good head
She a reader
And sometime me leave her alone
But shawdy know that she my Nina Simone
She go deep not a low
Every night Jagga go reap what he sow
And she tell me what she feel inside
She say it’s something so deep and wide
Girl if you want this bad as I do
Satisfy me, let me satisfy you

When she in the club, yes the whole city panic
She got the greg sex looking tight in her spandex
