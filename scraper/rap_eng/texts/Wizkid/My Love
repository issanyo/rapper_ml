[Intro: Dua Lipa]
Yeah
Ahh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
You've been here, but you've been missin' for some time now
Yeah, yeah
Every time I see you, it's a different vibe now
Yeah, oh
I can't help but let you just slip away
Can we get back what we had yesterday?

[Pre-Chorus: Wale & Dua Lipa]
If I ride with you, better know that I'mma ride for you
Bet I'd use a gun and knife for you
I ain't finna choose the side over you, yeah
If I ride with you, ain't nothin' to provide for you
Ain't nobody in my life like you
Ain't nobody gonna shine like you

[Chorus: Wizkid & Dua Lipa]
Show me my love, oh God
Show me sweet love, yeah
Show me my love, oh yeah
Show me sweet love, yeah
See, show me my love
Love, whoa, whoa, whoa
Love, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2: Wale]
My team, team, we on that new ting
My mink draggin' like it's Liu Kang
My show packed, all the dimes there
But I be fallin' back from all the loose change
I drop the top on that new thing
My chocolate broad, they rock Gucci
Gotta know it's impossible to stop Folarin
Got the box, I want the new thing, yeah

[Refrain: Wale]
She gon' show out, show out
Before its wahala, "Roll out, roll out," mmm, yeah
She gon' show out, show out
Before you break it down, girl, roll out, roll out

[Pre-Chorus: Wale]
If I ride with you, better know that I'mma ride for you
Better know that we can live for each other
That don't mean I gotta die for you

[Chorus: Wizkid & Dua Lipa]
Show me my love, oh God
Show me sweet love, yeah
Show me my love, oh yeah
Show me sweet love, yeah
See, show me my love
Love, whoa, whoa, whoa
Love, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Bridge: Wale & Dua Lipa]
Uh, yeah, bring 'em out, bring 'em out
Hard to hear, too many girls in the house, ayy
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out
I started here, I got the buzz and the clout
I know, I know she got it all, but got nothin' to hold
Every time I saw her, not too many know
She ain't really hard, she act because she hurt, duh
And I can be your last
Leave the past with your first

[Chorus: Wizkid & Dua Lipa]
Show me my love, oh God
Show me sweet love, yeah
Show me my love, oh yeah
Show me sweet love, yeah
See, show me my love
Show me sweet love, yeah
Love, whoa, whoa, whoa
Show me my love
Show me sweet love, yeah
Love, whoa, whoa, whoa
