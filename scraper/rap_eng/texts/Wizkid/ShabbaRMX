[Verse 1: Tucker HD]
Uh, uh, uh
I, pull up on them like I'm Shabba, pull up on them like I'm Shabba
While they were bumping & grinding, my mind was on grinding, bumping Rabadaba
We the realest out Rubaga, catch a bodybag, Abaga
With Frank White, in Black House, I been Barack'ing since Baraka
All my whoadies are with me, they keep it a hunnid & 50
Had accounts in the minus, but now my mind is on a victory
Though my target's up where Wiz be, you know my heart is where the kids be
When music makes me a milli I'll split it with 40/40 50-50
Swerve in a Benzo, we riding with Billy B
Friends turn to foes, when you're close, it's how it goes, yeah you know how it really be
Off that loud, girl quit yelling, it's driving me nuts & I'm Dizzy, G
She know I don't play with the mic like I'm Ziggy Dee
Kiro na misana, kiro na misana
Ask baby, for the cash baby, I go Kasbaby at Pana
Wicked, a bad man ting, I need me a fine, grown ting
Stay with me, that's what Sam sung when her iPhone ring..

[Verse 2: So Severe]
So Severe been a ghost, and now they're all asking you, "Who dat?"
That ignorant shit, always wanted to do that
And I'm not a new cat, I've been in it before you knew rap & now I be binning the new acts
I'm like, "Is that your new girl on your arm?" Yeeah, I'ma have to remove that
She's texting me, want my ding-a-ling, wanna do the ting-a-ling-a-ling
Til my bell a ring-ring, wanna sing-sing outchea for a real king like uh..
Yo, I'm about my biz kid
Pissing them off with my cleverness yo, I'm a wiz, kid
They asking, hona shezi bars zoona ka wazigaba
Tell em ninye rap god, when I'm done ba rapper boona bazakuba ni bashaba
Understand, already said I'm a ghost so it's gonna be hard to make me out
I'm like a petty Twitter broad to these mic assassins, they can not take me out. Deuce

[Verse 3: Suspekt 92]
Homies been asking me where you been? Like I'ma get paid for my presence/
I'm steady chasing the pay so I can take care of my brethren/
The girls, they be texting me clich√©s, it's been a while baby, how you been?
I know what they want, banoonya ba Don, to settle the bills they collected/
Nobody gat time for it/
On the budget that I'm balling/
Order rolex, akabulijjo for me and the fellas then I'm gone/
Like Kasangati's president, when he sneaking up out of his residence/
Hoodie on, something like Shabba, trying to be cool like doing the jabba/
Propa...something like Iguodala, when I ball, I shine at the right time/
The shooters that gat my back tho, they warriors ready to snipe/
But...we ain't here to fight, just some fellas looking for a goodnight/
So turn up that wiz kid, while I hit this and pass, cause the team is living a good life...

[Verse 4: Benny Black]
Mbe muhungu bite, je mbabwira nti ni sawa
Told em it's ma time, sinari nambaye n'isaha
Keep on takin shots and you gon get the saba saba
Tuja babya, from Kampala to Lusaka, towakana
Had a girl from Hana, on her knees for no Hosanna
Said her hair was real, oh no it's from Copacabana
So I had to dump her, you know, playa boys will be Bafana
Found another kyana when I made it PULA in Botswana
I'm RAPPING WITH THE LADIES I like them XTRA NAKED
That girl you call your baby, is now your ex and taken
She had that tingaling, and she was makin noise
I'm Mr. LOVER-MAN, why you hatin-boy?
They say the crew has been quiet, but you know we be on that loud
We smokin the best, and we drinkin the hardest so you know that there is no vino allowed
The irony tho, is I'm tellin this shawty to wine like a pro
She drop on the floor and she says at the end of the night we can go find a couple of trees we can blow
