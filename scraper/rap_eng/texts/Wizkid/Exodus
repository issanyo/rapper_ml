[Hook – Omar Sterling & WizKid]
Exodus made move, everybody move "Mo fe j'aye mi oo-ooo"
Exodus make move, everybody move
"Mo fe j'aye mi oo-oo, aa-aah"
Exodus make move, everybody move "Oh yeaah"
Exodus make move, everybody move "One time, one time so"
Everybody move ... 				 "You can't take my shine"
Exodus make move, everybody move "Yaaaga-ah"

[Verse 1 – Omar Sterling]
Please, go get it; please, without excuse
Winners have a plan, losers just wanna lose
Against the odds, I'm here, it's what I choose
I've been high, way before substance abuse

When ma uncle got sick, I visited the clinic
They had killed him physique, but never killed the spirit
He look me in the eye, and I started to cry
But I determined to be strong, life is just a midget
Who is a hater? Who's a fvcking critic?
Music ease the pain, pain in every lyric
So when you make it rain, we be making visit
Back to the hood, help them with some figures
Now it's up to them, figure out what they wanna
You kept to your choices, I believe in Karma
I’m a black star, I'm from Tema, Ghana
And I love Wale, shoutouts to Bandana

[Hook – Omar Sterling & WizKid]
Exodus made move, everybody move
"Mo n'she jeje, mo nj'aye mi oo-oo"
Exodus make move, everybody move
"Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo" -- jeje
Exodus make move, everybody move
Exodus make move, everybody move
""Mo fe j'aye mi oo-oo, aa-aah"
Everybody move ... "Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo"
Exodus make move, everybody move
"Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo, eh"

[Verse 2 – Omar Sterling]
'02 throwback, ma nigga, true vibes
Every story that run teeth, ma nigga two sides
Tribute to ma nigga, Munir, who died
Some say he was killed, others suicide
Wofa Yaw wokae, Mariner's poolside?
Wofa Yaw wokae, Mariner's poolside?
We no dey pay, dey jump wall, choor deep side
Dadaba still dey laugh, but we no see that side

Aim high, you can touch the sky
You don't need wings, believe you can fly
Why I wish you sun, and you wish me rain?
Why I wish you love, and you wish me pain?
You know very well, your wish is in vain
And, Destiny child say, 'Say My Name'
One life to live, no one to blame
You just have to believe, your life won't be the same

[Chorus – WizKid]
Mo n'she jeje, mo nj'aye mi oo-oo
Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo
Mo fe je aye mi oo-ooo, jeje
Mo n'she jeje, mo nj'aye mi oo-oo, aa-aah
Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo
Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo, eh

[Outro – WizKid & Omar Sterling]
Mo n'she jeje "Exodus made move, everybody move"
Mo nj'aye mi oo-oo "Exodus made move, everybody move"
Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo "Exodus made move, everybody move"
Mo fe j'aye mi oo-ooo, jeje
"Exodus made move, everybody move"
Mo n'she jeje "Exodus made move, everybody move"
Mo nj'aye mi oo-oo, aa-aah
"Exodus made move, everybody move"
Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo "Exodus made move, everybody move"
Mo fe s'aye mi oo-ooo, eh "Everybody move"
