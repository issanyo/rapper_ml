Americana wonder
The way you whine your body
Gimme thunder
Girl, i go follow you bumper to bumper
Girl, i go follow you bumper to fender
Oh baby ohh whine your waist
Girl, i promise to be your defender
Girl, i go love january to december
Tell dem hater, send back to sender

Oh baby oh whine your waist
Oh baby oh whine your waist
Oh baby, you make me craze
Oh baby, you make me craze
Girl, i be loving you everyday
Girl, i’m loving you everyday
Let nothing come our way
Let nothing come our way

I want your body sleeping in my bed e

You got me going crazy
Oh girl, i can’t explain it

Oh girl, i can’t replace you

Oh girl, i can’t explain it

Oh blessing follow me
Everywhere i go, i’m serving the living God
And everywhere, i go all my people show me love
Just tell me the reason gan
And so people still try to bad mouth me
Just tell me the reason gan
Shey na because God dey blessing everyday
Just tell me your feeling gan
Oh anytime, they hear my song
They say i’m amazing gan
And people dem know say wizzy baby bad
Them say i’m the baddest gan
But some people think say dem bad pass me
But nobody badder gan
And any party wey i go
I march up the place
I turn on the feeling gan

I want your body sleeping in my bed e
I want your body sleeping in my bed e
You got me going crazy
