[Verse 1]
Me got a girl, she straight undress
When me come through she ease mi stress
She never let nobody stress me
She carry one bullet for the one who stress me
She want no one else
I want no one else
She call me number one, she say she blessed
Callin' me special, give her, instead of decieve her

[Chorus]
Oh I, she make me sweat
She really like to make me sweat
She makes me sweat
She make me sing say
She really, really like to make me sweat
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
She makes me sweat
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
She makes me sweat

[Verse 2]
She tell me, say
Control me, control me
She tell me, "Wizzy, control me"
She tell me, "Starboy
I do feel your style, I do feel your beat"
I'm feelin' real in the VIP
She tell me, "Wizzy, control me"
She tell me, "Starboy
I do feel your style, I do feel your beat"

[Chorus]
Oh I, she make me sweat
She really like to make me sweat
She makes me sweat
She make me sing say
She really, really like to make me sweat
She makes me sweat
She makes me sweat

[Verse 3]
My baby just hold on to me
Baby I will never let you feel alone
I wanna touch your soul
I wanna feel your soul
Hold on to me
Oh my God [?] your desire
[?] desire
Wine up, back up, wine up, bonita
Baby girl wine up, bonita
Dance for me, now
Me call you my sweet Mona Lisa
Baby just wine up and give me that reefer
We smoke that reefer
Baby wine up for me, gyal
Give it to me, me check your meter

[Outro]
She makes me sweat
She makes me sweat
She makes me sweat
My girl, she makes me sweat
She makes me sweat
She makes me sweat
She makes me sweat
My girl, she makes me sweat
