Bad gal come whine 'pon it

You tryna keep me like a checklist (Uh, uh)
Slow whine, slow whine
Body cold like a necklace (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 2: Wizkid]
My gal your body cold like a necklace
No bad mind, really can touch this
Gold so cold when you whine this
This straight one put you on me checklist
Me loving the love, 'cause it's reckless
Girl I'm a sinner, come bless me
Baby girl no stress me
Say bad gal so you kill with that vibe
Uh

[Chorus: Normani]
I got the addy, I don't need no GPS's (Uh, uh)
Diamonds shining, diamonds shining
Now I keep them VVS's (Uh, uh)
Don't lie, don't lie
You tryna keep me like a checklist (Uh, uh)
Slow whine, slow whine
Body cold like a necklace (Uh, uh, uh)

[Outro: Wizkid]

Just let me give you keys to my life, and
Baby girl show me your vibe
Baby girl show me your light
Me need a lickle bit of your time, and
Said me give you keys to my life, and
Baby girl show me your vibe
They control, on control
