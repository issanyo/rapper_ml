Paroles de la chanson Holla At Your Boy :
When you see me come around
I got you looking at me (got you looking at me)
I don't need to spend my cash
Cos my swag's not hard to see
Cos my swag don't lie
You can't deny
You feeling right yeah
You'll be alright just being by my side

No need for fronting (fronting girl)
Let me tell you something (something girl)
No need for long thing, cos you feel so good just standing by my side
