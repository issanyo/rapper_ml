[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Wizkid]
I feel the vibe
Feelings you can't hide
We can go all night, oh yeah
Baby, it's your time
You know that it's yours
Girl, you know you're mine, oh yeah
And don't say no tonight
Let me know when you're ready
Won't let you down this time
Yeah, gyal, I can read your mind
I'll take you down tonight
I'll give you love all night, yeah

[Verse 1: Wizkid]
Just a couple likkle things when you do make a bad man know
You make it difficult for me to leave, you make my likkle bad man pause
She said she not a groupie, not the type to lust for cars and clothes
She wanna give me vibes, she wanna go tonight

[Chorus: Wizkid]
Smoke highgrade by the fireplace
Wishing for higher days
Sexing you night and day, yeah
Feelings we can't erase
Don't let the fire away
The fire away, have a fire today
Gyal, I gotta let you know

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Wizkid]
I feel the vibe
Feelings you can't hide
We can go all night, oh yeah

Girl, you know you're mine, oh yeah
And don't say no tonight
Let me know when you're ready
Won't let you down this time
Yeah, gyal, I can read your mind
I'll take you down tonight

Spend a band on these Zoobies
On and on and on
She said, "Boy, that my favorite song"
Lookin' good with no makeup on
Kush got me Hong Kong
Feelings we cannot hide (cannot hide)
Fire in your eyes (fire in your eyes)
Sex on your mind
