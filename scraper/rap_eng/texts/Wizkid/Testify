Hit dire hard beat

You raised me up from pit

And cleansed me purified me

You’ve shown me

What true love can do

I can never count my blessings

Cos is too much oh lord you’re too much

If I should testify all you’ve done

Onum apugi ikochaya

Nwannem mmmmmm

Nkowa Iheoma chukwu merem oo

Onum apugi ikochaya

You gave me a good health

And added a long life

You’ve asured me that you’re love is true

You leadeth me beside the still water

You restored my soul

If i should testify all you’ve done

Onum apugi ikochaya

Nwannem mmmmmm

Nkowa Iheoma chukwu merem oo

Nwannem mmmmmm

Onum apugi ikochaya

Nothing will ever stop (×4)

Me from serving you

You yeah
