[Intro]
Starboy!

[Verse 1]
I fell in love in the pool party
She callin' me 2 Chainz
I want a new Bugatti
Gold on my two wrists
She call me the cool kid
Kiss on my new ring
She lovin' the crew, she lovin' the crew
She know that I'm Gucci
She'll pick up the phone, yeah
She feelin' the pool party
Dancin' on me, shawty
Don't get me started
See I'm on my ?
Tell her I said no, no
Say she no want go
Know where she want go

[Chorus]
Pick up the phone, baby
I'm in the zone, baby
I'm in the club, baby
Stop all the callin'

[Refrain]
Whine fi me baby, don't let no one know so
Give it to me, baby, let nobody no so
Whine fi me baby, don't let no one know so
Give it to me, baby, let nobody no so

[Verse 2]
I swear if you fuck me
You fuck me, I swear I'll go buy you new Bugatti
I like to give you money
You can ball on your two feet
And I'll go buy you two chains
And I'll go buy you two rings
Let down your feet
I'm gon' make you defuse me

[Refrain]
Whine fi me baby, don't let no one know so
Give it to me, baby, let nobody no so
Whine fi me baby, don't let no one know so
Give it to me, baby, let nobody no so

[Chorus]
Pick up the phone, baby
I'm in the zone, baby
I'm in the club, baby
Stop all the callin'

[Refrain]
Whine fi me baby, don't let no one know so
Give it to me, baby, let nobody no so
Whine fi me baby, don't let no one know so
Give it to me, baby, let nobody no so
