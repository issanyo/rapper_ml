Riding in a ghost
Smoking ain’t no lie,
I dont send nobody, i dont hear nobody
Listening to mulla
Thinking I'mma ruler
Weezy on my feet, da di da di da di
Yea i pray for blessings
Young G making paper
And my mama told me, never stop never delay
Steady on my grind
I got this beat inside me
Music flowing, deep inside me

Mehn, okay im out hear
Tryna function cooler than i once was
Cop it like its nothing
Morning the side of the compass
Im passing it with honors
Now i eat a lobster
Things don change for me
Since i was younger
Riding round in nairobi
Real niggas only
Im 19 and i’m torrent
Michael tour is boring
My sneakers say air Jordan
Snitches still reporting
I’m out here recording
I’m out here importing

We don’t even ask for prices no more
(when i walk into the store, there’s no reason i should know)
We don’t even ask for prices no more,(Cos i’ve been working no play,if i deserve it i’ll pay)
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard

I can say that these rhymes
Is my reason to exist
Reason to be missed
Sold you bout a season worth of hits
Speaking is a bitch
Have to reconfigure what i spit
Teachers if you seat down and listen to preacher of the kids
You could learn, that music has turned into a medicine
Saving the youths and also many many many men
Plenty will spend on this record
Till we make our ends
So pardon the benzes, i’m rocking up with all her friends

Because there’s something bout this life
Born for this we are
I can’t explain but its inevitable
Destined for greatness
Effortlessly making hits
Who knew we’ll turn out like this

We don’t even ask for prices no more
(when i walk into the store, there’s no reason i should know)
We don’t even ask for prices no more,(Cos i’ve been working no play,if i deserve it i’ll pay)
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard

I got that Louis V. in my closet
Riding riding i’m getting it
Show money deposit
Touring out in all jets and shit
Betting it, all these fly kicks i be rocking
Nice place i grew up in
Got your girl out here letting it
Pouring browns in a liquor, watchu know about it
Flame to flame, while i’m switching lanes
And i’m smoking loud shit
So what they bothering for
I pull up in a ghost, with your hoes, cos nigga

We don’t even ask for prices no more
(when i walk into the store, there’s no reason i should know)
We don’t even ask for prices no more,(Cos i’ve been working no play,if i deserve it i’ll pay)
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard

On behalf Camp Mulla too five four
