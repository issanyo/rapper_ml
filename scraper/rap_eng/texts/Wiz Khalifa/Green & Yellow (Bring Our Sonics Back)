[Hook:]
Yeah huh-huh, you know what it is
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Yeah huh-huh, you know what it is
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Came up in our town and then you stole from us our team
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Don't mind the Seahawks but yo, where my Sonics at?
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow

[Verse 1:]
Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp
Seattle Sonics, NBA Champs
Those boys were tanks and ran over competition in the Pac NW
But since they gone we left with Hawks, M's, and UW
While I'm not dissing them all I really want is my Sonics back
This raw deal with Bennett was whack
That's why Sonics fans are on the attack
Led by Hansen, we're taking the Thunder by storm and gettin' our team back
So this is my open letter to the city of Oklahoma
Your owner may have a diploma in relocation
But our fans will never go along with the transformation
So listen to Khalifa's instrumentation while I tell you that all across the nation
Our blood still runs green & yellow

[Hook:]
Yeah huh-huh, you know what it is
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Yeah huh-huh, you know what it is
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Came up in our town and then you stole from us our team
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Don't mind the Seahawks but yo, where my Sonics at?
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow

[Verse 2:]
Got a call from my homie, this just in
Clay Bennett bought the Sonics, sendin' 'em to OKC
Losin' the team we all loved, never again seein' "Sonics" on the Key marquee
Durant, our newest draftee, heading off to the Blue Sea
You can kill our dreams but you can't take our memories
Pro B-Ball Club are now the enemies
The coliseum and domed stadium with their amenities back in the seventies
We miss the old days and old ways

[Hook:]
Yeah huh-huh, you know what it is
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Yeah huh-huh, you know what it is
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Came up in our town and then you stole from us our team
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
Don't mind the Seahawks but yo, where my Sonics at?
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
[Outro:]
Missin' that green and yellow
Save Our Sonics
We yelling Save Our Sonics
Yeah, bring our Sonics back!
Talking to you Clay Bennett, we miss 'em
Bring 'em back
