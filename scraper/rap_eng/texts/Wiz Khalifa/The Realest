[Intro]

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You see I run with them dudes, get loose with them pipes out
You sweet as ice cream, two scoops what your life bout
I'm heavy on the scene, bad news when the mic's out
And heavy on the lean, Timb boots or the whites out
It's Pittsburgh's kick flipper, spit words great nigga
Disturbed? You could get your shit curbed way quicker
Mad cus I spit that hard
And I'm with that broad
Fast lane how I rip that car
Fast change, how'd I get that large?
Cus the flow is dope
Yours, yea you know's a joke
Sure, here you hope to blow
I'm out to move the units from the set to Kosovo
Flow like the Rope-a-Dope
Crack, call me coke to smoke
You niggas washed up and they ain't even started yet
A lot of new niggas coming out but I'm the hardest yet (Yes)
One I can fear, I ain't met an artist yet
Throw the lead, that'll roll his head right up off his neck

[Hook: Jay-Z sample] (Repeat 2x)
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em niggas scared of that black

[Verse 2:Wiz Khalifa]
Gettin' cake's what my life bout
Them long days, takin' them nights out
The grind and paper chase what I write bout (Yea)
I'm a hustler, cake is my lifestyle
And for the fam, takin' your lights out
You niggas want a problem you can get it
I'll take your wig, all of it get splitted
Leave your dome throbbin' in your fitted
My advice to you is just be cool
And that's for all of y'all
A pimp always with a bad chick like in Monster's Ball
I'mma show you how monsters ball
Yea, the rap livin', crack spittin' bars and all
And your punch lines are hardly hard
It ain't the flow, its the fact you niggas broke that make me "hardy-har"
Wiz Khalifa leave your body scarred
Fuck your plans up
And if I can't get to you dog, I fuck your mans up
So just listen fag, most niggas quick to brag
Me, I'll get you zip and tagged
Dragged in a kitchen bag

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Smallz Money]
Who you know keep it gudda as me
Popular, me so I'm floodin' the streets
Wolves hungry so I stay with my heat
They wanna slump me, leave me six feet deep
They want me cuffed doin' time up creek
I spit hot when I rap to the beat
I stay high off the limiest chief
Every day I be grindin' for cheese
In the club with the nine in my sleeve
Act tough and you could die when I squeeze
Got shooters in the weeds like I'm Vietnamese
They keep clappin' 'till them hammers go ding
My money long you could call me the king
Thought your man was gettin' money caught him pawning his bling
Niggas say they blood in like 'Ricans and Vatos
I'm hood in, hood out, like Dominicans papo
See y'all broke, on the block servin' fiends Dove soap
I keep the snub close, pop let the chrome glow
Shots in ya dome ho, chyea

[Hook]
