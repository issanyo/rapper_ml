Does anybody have regular size papers out there?
King size? I'll use those
Let me see that grinder

[Hook]
Got the windows down, radio's on

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You got it all, well at least you think you do
When it's time to ball, niggas better think of you
You see the life you wanna live on TV and wanna be a part of it
Spend every night just popping bottles, pouring drinks in VIP, and you love it
The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, don't worry, that's just how the game go
The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, but I'm just singin' the same note, playin' the same song

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You got it all, well at least they think you do (woo, yeah)
When they say workin' hard, man, they better think of you
Cause all these plaques, nigga, that's because of it
Wouldn't have shit if it wasn't for it
Smokin' on medicinal, spraying ozium to try cover it
In the game playin' hard, but I'm just in the game, I ain't in love with it
Y'all niggas tryin' to get famous, a nigga like me tryin' to get fuckin' rich
Fuckin' rich, fuckin' rich, broke ass niggas can't fuck with this
Fuck a deal, when it goes down, got a hundred mill on my bucket list
Y'all niggas gon' keep on hatin' but we ain't gonna stop then
You'll catch me in somethin' foreign and the top gon' be droppin'

Nah, forreal, I didn't even do that on purpose bro
I'm not even stuntin' so imagine when I start tryin'
