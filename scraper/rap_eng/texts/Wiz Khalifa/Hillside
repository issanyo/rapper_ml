You see me at night 'cause my real side

So can we get it started for the hillside?
Throw myself a party on the hillside

And that patty go down like a basement
I roll me a joint and I face it
Baby girl lovin' the way that it taste
Mmm-mmm, what did you do with your day?
I put a mill in the bank, wait
Got ice, you can skate, you wet like a lake
Got boats you could drive, got flights you could take
Got some kush in the jar, when you light it, it stank
Baby girl, I'm a boss, I got time, you can stay
