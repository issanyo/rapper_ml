[Intro]
Started small with nothing
Now I got it all
I still want more
Who say I can't have that too?
You feel me..

[Verse 1]
Foot on the gas, both hands on the steering wheel
Jumped in the game, 'cause I know it's real
Heard it'll change you, I know it will
Gatting still, we made it over the hill
Being broke, I know how it feel
All about a dollar bill
And seeing my son grow up
See, they ain't know what they focus was
That's when I see my lane open up
Drinking champagne on boats
So drunk that I'll probably spend a month sober
Little more famous but a lot older
Been through situations, niggas acting bipolar
You don't always keep it real with me, I don't know ya
Say they good intentions, but they not even close
Say they got sick of whips, but i'm driving the most
Nigga I be on my shit, you ain't gotta provoke me
Fuck you talking bout it

[Chorus]
You know it ain't like it was before
I know it feel like I've been here before
We know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door....
Hit the bank and I'm counting more
I know to the top's where we can go
You know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door

[Verse 2]
All I know is I been here before
Blew that smoke in the air before
Smell like dope in the airport
I'm the one that they're cheering for
Lotta kush smoke, that's what they preparing for
Gave you solid shit before now you hearing more
Seeing my niggas on top that's what I stand for
And only money conversations what I care for
And anytime you eat just know you gotta share yours
Them niggas out to get you, claiming they down
Shit change when you turn around
So it's no love for them
It's only papers when I roll up
Focus on the money now and not later
Ain't got the time to play
Thirteen cars in the driveway
God telling me keep going
One foot on the gas, two hands when I'm rolling
(Ay what chu doin nigga?)
Getting mine and staying focused

[Chorus]
You know it ain't like it was before
I know it feel like I've been here before
We know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door....
Hit the bank and I'm counting more
I know to the top's where we can go
You know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door

[Outro]
So you really need all those?
That's how much you gon smoke?
