[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
It's young Khalifa, man
My weed good
Fingernails clean now
I don't do nothing but peel money and touch bitches
(Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard)
So tell 'em go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
So that's what I'ma do, hahaha
Yeah
(Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard)
Juliano on the track
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I worked for everything I own
Dare a nigga try and take it
Spent 300 on the frames
Just for blocking out you haters
Swear they're in my way
They in my rear view mirror
If a nigga act stupid
I'mma let him get his issue
Everything designer
And my back seats recline
I got a thing for livin' good
And blowing money like it's tissue
But niggas see you eating
Get to starving for a plate
Well, you don't give it when they hate
That's why my niggas keep a biscuit
It's no gimmick
I talk it how I live it
So when nigga cross the finish
Gotta push it to the limit
Got a mom and little sister
I plan on taking care of
Lost my uncle this year
A couple niggas in the system
So I roll
No telling where I'm landing
But I know something
That I'm going towards some money
I can see you niggas slacking
Everyday I'm on my job
Young Khalifa going hard
'Til the I'm last man standing

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
I ain't been there you know in so long
So goodbye
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
And I ain't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Got my eyes on this money
And some good weed burning
Where I'm from you gotta grind
Going hard is not an option
Now these niggas acting jealous
Cause they feel like they ain't shining
And they little shit stop
When this big shit popping
Probably be a fiend
Gotta keep it in my system
60-box of cigarillos
Cause I blow it by the onion
Pay a couple bills
Send some paper to my young'n
'Cause he just like Steve Francis
He be playing with them rockets
Whipping on the wheel
Got my peddle to the metal
'Bout to hit another city
Ain't no point in getting settled
Straight onto the plane
Ain't been home in so long
Niggas think it's my cologne
But that's money that you smelling
I act like my father
Can't stand my older brother
Got some niggas doing years
Cause of funny niggas telling
Nigga, I'm a keep grinding
'Til the day that I expire
I be running through the fire
'Til I'm the last man standing

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye
