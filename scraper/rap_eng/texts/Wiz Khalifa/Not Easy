[Chorus: Sam Harris]
It's not easy
No, it's not easy
It's not easy breaking your heart
It's not easy
No, it's not easy
It's not easy breaking your heart

[Verse 1: Sam Harris]
We were two dumb kids
Full of grand ideas
We knew this would end from the start
From the fire we burned
You and I, we learned
It's not easy breaking your heart

[Chorus: Sam Harris]
It's not easy
No, it's not easy
It's not easy breaking your heart
It's not easy
No, it's not easy
It's not easy breaking your heart

[Refrain: Sam Harris]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Elle King]
We were two dumb kids
Full of hopes and fears
Growing further and further apart
So you shook your head
Looked at me and said
"It's not easy breaking your heart."

[Chorus: Sam Harris & Elle King]
It's not easy
It's not easy
No, it's not easy
It's not easy
It's not easy breaking your heart
It's not easy
Not easy
No, it's not easy
It's not easy breaking your heart

[Refrain: Sam Harris]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
We started small and conquered it all
Came from nothing, but knew we would ball
Some looked at us and said we would fall
We tryna to do it big like no one done it before
I remembered that hole in the wall
Twelve of us in the bus, we was all going hard
Waiting for hard work to pay off
They'll come and take your spot if you take a day off

[Chorus: Sam Harris, Elle King & (Wiz Khalifa)]
It's not easy
No
No, it's not easy
No, it's not easy
It's not easy breaking your heart
(I don't really wanna break your heart)
It's not easy
No, it's not easy
It's not easy breaking your heart
(I don't really wanna break your heart)

[Outro: Sam Harris, Elle King (Wiz Khalifa)]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Yeah, it's Young Khalifa, man)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(I don't really wanna break your heart)
(Gotta do what I gotta do)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(To get where I'm going)
(I don't really wanna break your heart)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Haha, ain't nothin' gon' stop that)
(We just gon' keep going and going)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(I don't really wanna break your heart)
(I don't really wanna break your heart)
Haha, please don't ever show anyone that please
