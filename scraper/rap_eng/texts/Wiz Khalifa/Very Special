[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Eh, eh, eh
Uhh

[Chorus]
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
Will I forget you, I might probably never
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
You bring your friends for me like ohh, that's extra
I treat you special 'cause you very special

[Verse 1]
Hotels ain't enough, get the crib like we live there
Been a player, I ain't fucking off
Handle my business, my squad chillin'
Focus on what I'm buildin', you should probably be filming
What I'm smokin' is quality, not for children
Half these niggas is wannabes, I came up different
Call me in the clutch, perfect timin', never rush
Top floor, bring it up, ain't the gang came with us
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
Will I forget you, I might probably never
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
You bring your friends for me like ohh, that's extra
I treat you special 'cause you very special

[Verse 2]
Love how I treat you, fuck you once, nice to meet you
Your outfit see through, other bitches dying to be you
Niggas wonder why you leaving with me
Tired of him, she wanna ride with nigga who sees what she sees
Hit me up when you need company
Or if you're ever free, I'm never hard to reach
Baby I'm been on this, come to weed I smoke them bombest
Hold it down, maybe the gang is what you could be a part of

[Chorus]
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
Will I forget you, I might probably never
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
You bring your friends for me like ohh, that's extra
I treat you special 'cause you very special

[Outro]
Imma roll two when I roll through
Imma roll two when I roll through
Hey
And I showed her how to roll too
Two papers, two rollies
Roll two
