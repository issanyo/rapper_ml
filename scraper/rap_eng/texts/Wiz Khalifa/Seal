[Verse 1: Berner]
When the money comes
You'll see the funny ones
I'm in the mix still, where you think it's comin' from?
Pretty light skin bitch, she's only twenty-one
I ball like an athlete, I had to get it young
I'm at the beach off weed and Jamaican rum
Playin' with my cash, you gon' taste the gun
Yeah, the race was fun, who could live the fastest
I'm pullin' small faced hundreds out a dirty mattress
And the grow game got my in my own lane
Baking soda in the pot, light the stove flame
OT, OG in a hundred bands
We do the touch down dance when the money lands
Two girls both strip and they hella fine
New watch, new crop from a friend of mine
I get it, bag it up, and move it quicker every time
I still really get down
Why they telling lies (trap talk)

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Some made it out and some still in the field
Always stay down, yeah I'm gon' keep it real
But they know it ain't good unless the pack sealed
No, no
It ain't good unless the pack sealed
Just made half a ticket
Just off of one deal
Deal

[Verse 2: Berner]
One deal, made a quick five-hundred
White ghost right behind me like, I'm haunted
Never drop the bag off and heard, I don't want it
See the Benz and the six crib bedroom, I bought it
It's good, come to Cali, get a sweet price
Put her on a cheap flight
Hit me when she lands, I'mma wrap it up three times
Triple seal, each one
I made a half a ticket, then another three-hun
Trap talk, dig holes in the winter time
Out door got me rich, yeah, I'm finna shine
Bitches talkin' crazy, but they give me mine
I got a twenty-pack knock on my other line
Two girls, both drunk and they hella fine
Fresh picked, new smell, you can tell it's mine
Send another box out, I hope it touch down
I don't need another loss now


[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Some made it out and some still in the field (Trap talk)
Always stay down, yeah I'm gon' keep it real
But they know it ain't good unless the pack sealed
No, no
It ain't good unless the pack sealed
Just made half a ticket
Just off of one deal
Deal

[Verse 3: K Camp]
If you ain't gettin' money, you a slow learner
Cake in my palm til' I have to turn it
In the Bay smokin' on them Cookies
That I got from my nigga Berner
Dasani bottle full of Hennessy
Takin' shots, making gwop off my enemies
Fuck nigga, you is not who you pretend to be
Face some blunts to the head for the memories
Smokin' that Cali got me on the way
Where is them hoes, I ain't fucked em' for days
I got more problems and money to make
You gotta wait while I make some shade
I cannot touch unless it came with the seal
They fuck with me from the jump, I been real
I drive that shit with the horse on the wheel
And that was before the deal

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Some made it out and some still in the field
Always stay down, yeah I'm gon' keep it real
But they know it ain't good unless the pack sealed
No, no
It ain't good unless the pack sealed
Just made half a ticket
Just off of one deal
Deal
