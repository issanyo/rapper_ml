[Hook - Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm having
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that tree

[Verse 1 - Kid Cudi]
I got fam, dogg, I got my niggas
Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin
Most things are faded, feeling x-rated
Steady want them freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holding the fam down, and my close homies
The peoples that were there
While some suckers left me lonely, phoney
When you see a nigga, don't approach me
Made it to the top, baby, it's all me
Cats trying to claim that they made me
However you feel, I know the real fugazi
I keep it hundred, never frontin', no need be
When I'm in the zone, no place for pussy, my nigga
Conyo to haters who don't know
Loco, how a nigga like the postal
The ones fans love, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O's, double O's..

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
Thousand pounds of weed
Driving in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed
Them hoes don't use their feet
They break down to their knees
And suck me like a king. Ros√© in my champagne glass
And diamonds in my ring
Roll something
That's your bitch on my dick?
Well, I'mma let her hold something
You niggas smokin' seven I'mma need a whole onion. Woah youngin'!
Same ones that hate same ones that tag along
Them black dreads that make them lame niggas call my phone
Call me "World Wide Wiz" cause I'm never home
Ever leave me 'round your bitch, I'mma get her stoned
And you know that I rock camos and brought fros back
And go download some of my old tracks
And go play somewhere songs at
Fuckin high, fuckin high, fuckin high
