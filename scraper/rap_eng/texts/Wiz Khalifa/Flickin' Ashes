Me, I'm ridin' clean, smokin' good, can barely keep my eyes open
Listenin' to my favorite song, leanin' in my car chokin'
Tell my dawg to 'hit this weed,' feel like I'm finna pass out
Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out
Half out, a half ounce, some shit I never seen in life
Said that once he bagged it, smelled so bad, he had to bag it twice
I told him 'roll that shit up', this weed I had to light
These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'mma satellite
I roll em' very nice
With smoke comin' out the end like a muffler, got game from the hustler
Never said I'm gon' quit, can't get enough of good weed in my lungs
Plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin'
My eyes wide shut, I'm just starin' sayin' nothin'
I flick ashes, got big stashes
So I don't need a dime, I got big baggage bitch !
Yeah, I blow it by the zip
Anywhere I go, it's on the road, on every trip
Ask my nene, love her grandson, but she know that I'mma trip
Got my habit from this ?, smokin' roaches gettin' lit
Now I feel my blunt with so much weed, they say 'that all ain't gon' fit'
On some highly grown shit, with a hollywood bitch
Got the sweetest purple kush and a precisely rolled spliff
Hot as . . . ? Pole's Bic
On the way to see Marcella's,
Girl I'm in another world and Chevy got another twirl
For those who don't know, he got that roll game
And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game
Feel like I'm Soul Plane
I smoke the whole thing
Pound or O.Z
Kush fiend, Purple, Master, OG
(Yeah, that's a little bit of kush talk for yall' niggas who might not comprehend)
And every nigga that grow weed should know me
My leather so soft, my swishers so sweet bitch !
