[Hook x2]
As the days keep turning
As the world keeps burning
As my soul keeps learning
Tears fall from the castles around my heart

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Paperboy, top noise
Now I'm in Chinatown, bok choy
Should've took a pill, Clamicil
The way I ball that I could've played for Vanderbilt
When they talk me down
They gotta speak up
When they say my name Jody
They talking bout Jody
Talking Jody Highroller
I keep the syrup in my soda

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Wild like I'm on bath salt
Keep giving them what they ask for
Grind hard now my crib look like a castle
Y'all ain't fucking with Khalifa man
Riding around smoking on that reefer man
Getting money in every way
TGOD we all popping
Going on tour and they’re heart stopping
Can’t tell my car moving
Max fill my card jumping
Ball ‘til I ball like I’m Kobe
Got the undergrill be locked out lowkey
Uhm, and I just put a bid on a crib for my kid in the hills with no neighbors
Niggas say I’m ahead of the game
Smoking and drinking, and living my dream
Rolling a spliff on the plane
Popping my bottles and pouring a sip of my pagne
Ain’t nothing change, just made a mil and I still feel the same
You know what that mean my nigga, I’m getting the cake

[Hook x2]
