[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
And say yeah, and say yeah, and say yeah
One night in town, my niggas round
Throwing money, them bitches hit the ground
Then bring it back up, she bring it back up
Put em in that black truck
So many hoes, they lapped up
My niggas leaning
Diddy bopping, let's get it popping
I said lets get it popping
Just look at how she drop it
Little Mama a certified pro, she need her own show
Slide on down that pole and grind slow
Hell no, I ain't counting my dough
I came to blow it all
And get some brains
Trying to find, Mrs. Know It All
And I got my cup filled
Juicy how them bucks peel
Young pimp, see I grab me up a chick and just chill

[Refrain]
In the back of the club with a stack full of dubs
Drop it low like a pro
Bring it back, that's what's up
All my dogs up in here
Cause there's hoes everywhere
Niggas stunt like you don't care
Throw that money in the air
And say yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm high and drunk, doing my same dance
They call her, Pocahontas
Doing that rain dance
Talking, dough I got it
So make it rain, man
Cause the flow retarded
Sorta like that Rain Man
Borderline insane man
Look at all these dames, damn
With a nigga getting money
And I'm a changed man
You smell that haze scent
Know my game plan
Trying to get it smacking
I ain't with that game plan
Lil mama work for every dollar
She drop it low, pop it slow
Stop and go
Lots of smoke
We keep 'em rolling up
Shawty mad, she came with you, she wanna roll with us

[Refrain]
And say yeah
I said listen here
I do it grande
All day
Smoking on that bomb, hey
And I got my cup filled
You see how them bucks peel
Young pimp, see I grab me up a chick and just chill

[Refrain]
Roll that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeah
Roll that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeah
