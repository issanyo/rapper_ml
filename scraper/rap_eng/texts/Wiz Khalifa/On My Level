[Intro]
Hahah, say Jim

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
It’s the champagne pourin’, big joint rollin’
Bombay sippin’, no blunt smokin'
Bad bitch gettin’ thick, and she got some friends with her
I take ‘em out, pour shots of liquor
Drinkin' out the bottle, smilin' in all my pictures
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like Twitter
Nigga you know everything Taylor
Don’t rush to the bar, fool, if you ain't got no paper, that’s the rules
High as fuck, sloppy drunk when I’m passin' through
Rollin’ doobies up, your ho who we pass ‘em to
Hit the club, spend this money up
Roll another one, drink, act a fool, that's what I have to do

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
See I've been drinking champagne, all night
Never worry bout a damn thing, y’all might
Homie I’m on my level (yeah) I'm on my level (yeah)
I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)
So let me take one shot, to the brain
And I order three more shots, I’m going in
Ayy, I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)
I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Spent a couple dollars on my engine
Motor roaring when I back out the garage
Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar
Plus I’m struggling tryna find the keys to my car
Cause I be going hard
Roll the camera, life just like a movie, I’m the star
Wish you was in my position, you too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women
With me in the back, sippin' Rosé with some hash twistin’
All about a dollar, my team into cash gettin’
Straight outta the 'Burgh where we drink and we smash niggas
So when I say I’m balling, that don’t mean that I’m playing, mayne
All my diamonds talking, you can see what they saying, mayne

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
See I've been drinking champagne, all night
Never worry bout a damn thing, y’all might
Homie I’m on my level (yeah) I'm on my level (yeah)
I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)
So let me take one shot, to the brain
And I order three more shots, I’m going in
Ayy, I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)
I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)

[Verse 3: Too Short]
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin’
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'
I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin' and we ain't sleepin'
These bitches so high, man, we ain't even speakin’
We just freakin’, you rollin’ with Short Dog, baby
She was high on that pill so I fucked your lady
Come to my house, I give ‘em everything they want and
I might not do it, but I'll give it to ya women
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, marijuana
She can suck it if she wanna
I got tequila, Ciroc, and two freaky friends
And it's a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
See I've been drinking champagne, all night
Never worry bout a damn thing, y’all might
Homie I’m on my level (yeah) I'm on my level (yeah)
I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)
So let me take one shot, to the brain
And I order three more shots, I’m going in
Ayy, I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)
I’m on my level (yeah) I’m on my level (yeah)

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Man I’m high as fuck, man I swear I’m on my level
Man I’m sloppy drunk, man I swear I'm on my level
I finna pass out, man I swear I'm on my level
A nigga get smashed out, my nig' I swear I’m on my level
Man I’m high as fuck, man I swear I’m on my level
Man I’m sloppy drunk, man I swear I'm on my level
I'm finna pass out, man I swear I'm on my level
A hater get smashed out, my nig' I swear I’m on my level
