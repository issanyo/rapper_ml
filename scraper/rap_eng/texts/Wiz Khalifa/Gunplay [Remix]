[Intro: Hollywood]
Rich... Rich...
LG Nigga!

[Hook: Hollywood]
Richmond niggas 'bout gunplay
Better make your bitch pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
I'm high, I'll come down one day
Count money, Monday to Monday
How you really doing fake shit
How you a player, got one bitch?
No bodies, but you kill shit?
This real verse, fake shit

[Verse 1: Hollywood]
I'mma start off on a good note
Rolling good weed on a big boat
Counting blue ships, all C-notes
And crispy head cash in my Avirex coat
Talking outside, been there since Phat Farm
Big shit, letting off car alarms
Bar lovely with chain with the gun charm
And he even cut me loose in the lazar
If I got it then I paid for it
Name solid, did my thang for it
Had your lil bitch, you ain't even know it
Had an extra hammer, let my cousin hold it, get 'em, let's go

[Hook: Hollywood]
Richmond niggas 'bout gunplay
Better make your bitch pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
I'm high, I'll come down one day
Count money, Monday to Monday
How you really doing fake shit
How you a player, got one bitch?
No bodies, but you kill shit?
This real verse, fake shit

[Verse 2: Berner]
Play around get your face cut
It's real out here, we don't play much
How you out side with your chain tucked?
Holly' outside with the thang tucked
Real game, mmm
Yeah I'm 'bout big cash
Bern pulled up with the big bag
Where the city where the Rich' at
I got rich and the O with G stack
Yeah we have dark with the blue cook
I feel like Celly, I'm too took
Damn, I got mud on my new three's
Break one down get a two piece, real city boy

[Hook: Hollywood]
Richmond niggas 'bout gunplay
Better make your bitch pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
I'm high, I'll come down one day
Count money, Monday to Monday
How you really doing fake shit
How you a player, got one bitch?
No bodies, but you kill shit?
This real verse fake shit

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I did it all on my own, your bitch calling my phone
I get all of the dome and your squad is unknown
Went and got it alone plus I gotta get stoned
Bought a pound and a lot of it's gone
Always on point, never out of my zone
And if I ain't fuck her, never got her alone
I'm in and out of cars, got a lot of new homes
On the real, I'mma let it be known
Big spart niggas 'bout gunplay
Got a model bitch walking down the runway
How you a stoner and you only rolled one J?
How you a boss, still gotta do what somebody else say?
Gang, gang, gang

[Outro: Hollywood]
Richmond niggas 'bout gunplay
Better make your bitch pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
I'm high, I'll come down one day
