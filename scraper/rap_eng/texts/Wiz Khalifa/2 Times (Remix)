[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Two times, two times, let me see you do this shit two times
If that's your bitch, I been fucked that bitch, I think about two times
If I catch me a opp, I call Lil Flash, he shoot your ass two times
Then Moe pull up, ain't no talking, skrrt off in that Nissan
Irv like twin you crazy, these boys some peons
But I ain't thinking 'bout it, I been getting money, you would think it was a rerun
These bitches ain't going, these bitches they on me, I told the bitch be gone
I'm smoking on dope, real fu dope, I got it from Dion
Free Guwop, I had to say the shit two times
All these bitches they on me, I had to say the shit two times
Free Guwop, I had to say the shit two times
And baby girl over there shaking ass, two times

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Two times, two times, had to count 100 bands two times
Rich Forever chain got too much water, have your bitch drown two times
If I catch me an opp, pull out the chopper, I’ma shoot your ass two times
Your bitch must suck my dick real quick, pull off in that Nissan
I was like Dex you crazy
Real deal diamonds, no fugazi
I was in the trap with my baby
Two times forty, that’s eighty
Chiraq, got shooters like Haiti
North Atlanta, my niggas go crazy
Got a brick, break it down, got molly, got Katy
Said I want to make a mil, got a deal
Broke the money counter two times
Fucking my bitch then I switch
Me and Dex had to hit the ho two times
Broke ass nigga from the sidelines
Hear that, flex on him two times
Pull out the bankroll on him
That’s a quarter mil two times

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I fucked your bitch two times, homie I don’t do no lines
Don’t ever play with mine, they stay down to do the crime
I fuck her from behind, my new bitch she fine as wine
See them dollar signs, she leave with me, bottom line
I hear them niggas talkin’ ‘bout the gang, they ain’t in mine
I take a nigga bitch and get her home and break her spine
Young Khalifa man, I’m too rich to wait in line
Got two phones and a Rolex, still don’t even know the time
Take a shot, two times
Roll a joint, two times
Old school, new ride
My old shit’ll shit on your new rhymes
Got a new bitch that I met, only let me hit two times
Kick a bitch right off the futon
I’m getting that bread like a crouton
