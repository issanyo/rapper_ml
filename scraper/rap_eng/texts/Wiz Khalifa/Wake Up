[Intro]
Ooo
Yeah
Wake up, wake up, I don’t wanna wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, I don’t wanna wake up, wake up

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Verse 1]
Oh, long days, what I know hard work pays
So the money getting long too
And the Kush smell strong too
That’s that good any chick with me, she the bomb too
One thing I know is go hard young, make fake niggas notice
Blowing money ‘cause you dying if you don’t live
That’s how you know I was fly when I wrote this
First class tags or maybe I’m the first ‘cause of my first class swag
Used to say that I was trippin’, so a nigga bought expensive-ass bags

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Verse 2]
Go hard young, go hard
They let you in the game, better play your part
Go hard young, go hard
And if you in the game might as well play smart
‘cause I’ve seen niggas fold like paper
Got money seen friends turn haters
Got money minor league turn major
Got money white people turn neighbors
Need a girl, teach her how to roll papers, six months three whips all player
Run my town like the mayor, I run my town bitch I’m like the mayor

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Bridge]
I can take you up higher than you ever know
Let you touch what you want hit it once and you won't let go, hell no
Let you lean back, inhale smoke

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from
