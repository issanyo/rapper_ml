[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Walked in the gym with my goon
Take a nigga bitch she gon' choose
Bombay make me act a fool
Rich nigga make you break the rules
Sport car make you drive fast
I got the digital dash
Pocket got a whole lotta cash
Little baby got a whole lotta ass
She know what I came to do though
I can stomp down on 10 toes
She woke up like (where did) all her friends go
These niggas flexing in a rental
I ain't had no condoms, still hit it though
Found a condom in my wallet too late now
I just wanted top but she got on top
Put it all in, she told me don't stop

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
And we gon' take it there
Take it there, take it there
We gon' take it there
Take it there, take it there
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
10 minutes, I got 10 minutes
Fucked her in the rain and she came 'fore we finished
I ain't finished, no I ain't finished
Doing real things and her man ain't winning
Bite you on your ear, smack your ass, grab your titties
Pour another shot now we both getting litty
Brought some for the gang she want the whole damn committee
Hit it from the back she caught a whole lotta feelings
Bad bitch from Toronto
Her nigga play for the Broncos
We at my house and no one home
We about to make a porno
Hope her man don't find out
If he trip then my gangsters gon' kill one of these niggas
Gave it to me one time
Brought it back to me one more time, I'm still that nigga
Oh no

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
And we gon' take it there
Take it there, take it there
We gon' take it there
Take it there, take it there
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
Tell that nigga he ain't in the picture
I just spot it, I'ma come and get ya
Girl I'm cool, I ain't fucking with ya
I'm just joking, I'm just fucking with ya
Spread your legs like the Jordan symbol
I swear to me it's okay
Tryna get you all in these positions
I know you had a long day
I hope that you ready for me
I'm texting in the hallway
Count a bag with my niggas
You gon' smash one of my niggas
I be on some other shit
Still I know you love the shit
Hit it, I just left the trap
Taylor Gang, you fuck with this

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
And we gon' take it there
Take it there, take it there
We gon' take it there
Take it there, take it there
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
I'ma take you all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way down
