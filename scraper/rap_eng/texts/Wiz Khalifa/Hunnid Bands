[Hook]
Yeah, hunnid bands hunnid bands

Book me that's a hunnid bands
My whip cost a hunnid bands
My new wrist's a hunnid bands
Try me, that's a hunnid bands
One night, that's a hunnid bands
Hunnid bands hunnid bands

Try me, that's a hunnid bands
One night, that's a hunnid bands

[Verse 1]
Left wrist, right wrist, workin' like I got a pan
Chain lit, charm lit, so bright you might get a tan
Joint lit, walked in, smokin' weed because I can
Might take your bitch 'cause she said you ain't her man
Get cake all day count it up before I go
Cake cake to the face, gotta blow a lot of smoke
Niggas might talk shit, see 'em they don't say it though
Ball shit, you a lame that's just how the game go

[Hook]
Hunnid bands hunnid bands
I keep it a hunnid bands

Try me, that's a hunnid bands
One night, that's a hunnid bands
Hunnid bands hunnid bands

Book me that's a hunnid bands

[Verse 2]
Work hard, grind hard, money keep a lot of it
Gotta keep my money up so I stay on top of it
Buy a lot of chains but I own a lot of property
Shorty give me brain, and she sucked me up properly
Hop up in the Hellcat, no it ain't no stoppin' me
Niggas say I got the game locked like monopoly
Put it in her mouth, and she do it real sloppily
Always down to give these boys the game when I'm droppin' knees

[Hook]
Hunnid bands hunnid bands

Book me that's a hunnid bands
My whip cost a hunnid bands

Book me that's a hunnid bands
My whip cost a hunnid bands
My new wrist's a hunnid bands
Try me, that's a hunnid bands
One night, that's a hunnid bands
