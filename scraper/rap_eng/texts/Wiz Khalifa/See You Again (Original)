[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's been a long day without you,my friend,                                  And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everythin' I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be wit' me for the last ride

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love'll never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everythin' I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be wit' me for the last ride

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
