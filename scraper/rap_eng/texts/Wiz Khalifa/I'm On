[Hook: MDMA]
I’m on, I’m on, I’m on, ooh yeah
I’m on, I’m on, I’m on
I’m on (whoa) I’m on (whoa)
I'm on (whoa) I’m on (whoa)
I’m on

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, yeah, glitterati, big bodies and tall swings
Devil on me, Spitalfields and AllSaints
Playing field ain't levelling the lane
Throwing stones at your bones, kick pebbles at your pain
Swear they go hard, but they sold Jello in the paint
Trying to Carmelo but he can't
Lord have mercy
But we be having that jersey
Flowing so hungry, rapping that thirsty
Think fast, fast women, like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Fast life like born on Wednesday
And died on Thursday
Fast money like Zakat al-Fitr, break fast
Slow my roll like brake pads
Cause if you run the light, they just might stop you niggas
Rodney King on the dome, just things that I’m on

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Uhh, I’m on this one way, headed where the slums play
If I don’t make it then somebody tell my son spray
Struggling first class, headed for the runway
Real nigga shit, I gotta make it one day
Sick of hard times so I tell em to fall back
Sitting in all white but the Phantom is all black
For everything I lost, tell em I want it all back
Everyone who left me for nothing, tell em to call back
They ain't authentic, tell them I don’t even relate
Minus the love, they feel like I was something to hate
Tell them hate now, the world looking at 'em
They on the front row, everybody looking at 'em
I used to have dark nights now it’s bright lights
Daytime bus pass now it’s night flights
Had a poor man swag now it’s priced right
Always wanted a piece of the pie now it’s sliced right
Yeah, you can tell em I’m home
The streets in need of a king, you can tell 'em I’m home
Used to be at the bottom, tell ‘em it wasn’t for long
Now I’m always in the hood like I never was gone
I’m on, I told 'em I’m something they ain't gon' cut off
Try to hit the switch if you want I ain't gon' cut off
A 100 thousand volts, a true thing gon' shut off
Anything in the way is gon' get permanently shut off

[Hook: MDMA]
I’m on (whoa) I’m on (whoa)
I'm on (whoa) I’m on (whoa, ooh yeah)
I’m on

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Never letting go, although sometimes I slip
Like banana peels for heels, my spill is so legit
Notice it every time I pick up the microphone and spit
Eyes wide, ears open like you on a doctor's visit
But this ain't physics or rocket science
This a little tune to keep you motivated and inspired
I am not a motivational speaker
But people get easily motivated when they hear B-I-G reeking
Havoc on the track boi, grab it hold it tight
My city, growl with me, hootie hoo'ing through the night sky
Butterfly bow tie, made my mark like the craters on the moon
Rocking alligator shoes, I'm on

[Verse 4: Wale]
You know me, cool breeze, a nigga high
Rather live alone forever than live a lie
I’m in the zone, foam pros keeping me comfy
Got squares, dark squares cover my luggage
I'm in love with some women, more in love with my mother
I’m in love with my God, less in love with this money
And my level is off, got a bigger cigar
Out in Vegas with broads, bout as thick as Toccara
My ambition is ammunition if this is war
They can’t run, they can’t run, this is a wall
Got forever endurance, forever under purists
I put my breath in this motherfucker, they better hear it
Good denim, bad women and better lyrics
My only dream to get rich and never marry
Give these niggas the pink slip when they appear
And I ain't tripping, my only competition’s the mirror

[Verse 5: Wiz Khalifa]
Remember they used to be like, "Who is this?"
Now I’m up in this bitch, smoking weed out in London
They bringing me fish and chips, thought of this as a youngun
Who know this be the life that I really live?
Now I’m flying on trips, promoters and owners giving me gifts
Don’t gotta shop, I ain't paying for shit
This Audemar on my wrist, got it harder than missed
Older people looking at me how I bought all of this
I say I got it from grinding, perfect timing
Started at the bottom, ain't afraid to climb it
Took something rough and turn it to a diamond, oh
It ain't come easy, had to find it
And now you can’t say I got game cause I define it, uh
Nigga I’m on like the light on
And if I ever fall off, I'll be back on the same night
Me and my dogs, we on the same flight
Carefree I don’t need to stress
Smoking Khaled, my weed the best

[Outro: MDMA, Wale, Wiz Khalifa & Big Boi]
Ooh yeah, I’m on, I’m on, I’m on
Wale, double M-G shit
Tahahahah, yeah, smoking while I'm rapping, biatch! Yeah
I’m on (whoa) I’m on (whoa, ooh yeah)
Ya got Lupe Fiasco, Trae tha Truth, and Big Boi, Daddy Fat Saxxx
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
