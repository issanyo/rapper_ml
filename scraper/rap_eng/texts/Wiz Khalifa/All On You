Verse: Wiz Khalifa)
Slidin' in a 911, ridin' on the i
Been boardin' on the shawty's bay
Ridin' on 'er, I ain't nothin' like 'em otha niggas
254, pour the drinks, roll anotha one
It's good fives for you
Put you on some otha shit
Frequent fly for you
And if you got a pro'lem
Then my goons ride for ya
Started off cautious but it worked out for ya
Fuckin' make ya feel dip but I ain't dumb it down fo' ya
Rollin' kush like the Marley, bought a whole pound fo' you
Pilot in the air, chauffeur on the ground fo' us
She don't know what to say, just thank that I got it
Name it, I got it, hit banks for deposit

(Hook: Raven Felix)
I can tell you want it
I see the way you're looking at me
Feels like it's getting warmer
Turnt up like 100 degrees
I can tell you want it
So it's all on you
It's all on you
I see you ova there looking at me
I see you ova there looking at me
It's all on you
I see you ova there looking at me
I see you ova there looking at me
It's all on you

(Verse 2: Raven Felix)
12:30 in the club, feelin' good
Got a bottle, chillin' in the cut
That's when I saw you in the corner looking at me tough
Lookin' stuck, I'm grown, you gotta know what you want
Cuz I ain't the type to move first, I'm too turnt, I post up
Let you flirt, when mail all this desert, I don't front, I do work
You too scared, thought you was pimpin'
Got you sittin' like you nervous, like you need permission
Yeah, you betta go and pour anotha drink
I'm rollin' anotha J up, fuckin' with a boss bitch, you betta get yo game up
My eyes tell a story, I ain't even gotta say much
She playin', I ain't bout to wait up

(Bridge)
Cuz I know you wanna come and talk to me tonight
Keep it even through the lights, you been staring all night
Yeah, I know you tryna come and talk to me
Don't worry, I won't bite, and I won't put up a fight

(Hook)
