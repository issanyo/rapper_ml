[Intro: Wiz Khalifa & (Sledgren)]
Brr
Brr
(Sledgren)

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
New phone, who is this?
Sushi with my newest bitch
Miss me with the stupid shit, wow
4 chains on me now
Pull up, make a crowd
Baby, can you roll this loud? Wow
Whole crew bossin' up
Don't you get to trippin', girl
A.I., cross you up, wow
Sledgren, this a stupid beat
Takin' trips, every week
Hit it once, never speak, wow

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, can I ask you a question?
Can I get high without the stressin'?
Do you like me 'cause my possessions?
Don't you know this my progression?
Nothin' but KK in my session
I'm in the hills, don't got reception
Girl, let's have this conversation, you get naked
Watch some Netflix and just kick it like in Tekken
Hear the beat, that's made by Sledgren
Indeed, all my closet stuffed and full of Presidents
The weed smoke is the evidence
Knew it was us from the ashes left on the rug, hello?

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
New phone, who is this?
Sushi with my newest bitch
Miss me with the stupid shit, wow
4 chains on me now
Pull up, make a crowd
Baby, can you roll this loud? Wow
Whole crew bossin' up
Don't you get to trippin', girl
A.I., cross you up, wow
Sledgren, this a stupid beat
Takin' trips, every week
Hit it once, never speak, wow
