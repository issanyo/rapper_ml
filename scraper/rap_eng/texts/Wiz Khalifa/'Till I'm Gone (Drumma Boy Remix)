[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I grew tired of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love I’ll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going till I’m gone (gone)
Till I’m gone (gone)

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Can’t see me bitch, I’m something you will never know
I’m a star, you need a motherfucking telescope
Doing numbers, punching in the telephones
I give em line after line like I’m selling coke
I’m well connected like a nigga with a modem
And these bitches know I ball that's why these bitches on my scrotum
Flying right across the ocean bumping Frank and Billy Ocean
On a private jet they let a nigga smoke in, think I’m joking?
Come and play, pour out another bottle
Bring your girls round and let's turn my apartment to a brothel
I do this shit for real, blowing up the clubs
And when they see the bottles then them niggas know it’s us, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yeah, you see I’m back like I never left
Them haters stay, see they never left
I’m selling dope over treble clefs
Wrist looking like a treasure chest
Hella pads and hella jets
We fly, back seats we drive
Hotel's attire, next stop Dubai
Tell em whores “bye bye”
We getting at this money at the moment
The drop SLS is just a bonus
Push with Tinie Tempah, better watch ya temper
The holder of that gun got a heart like December
So roll with the winners or move out the way of the storm
Cause I’m coming for all crowns till the day that I’m gone
Never gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
Spent summers, Harlem world, spent summers in Miami
Atlanta stripper girls got my gun up in the Grammys
And I be buying time, just like my Audemar
You catch us flying by inside them foreign cars
My sneakers from uptown, my diamonds from the district
And when I be uptown, you know I got the biscuit
So crack another bottle, light another blunt
Mommy looking good, see that ass from the front
She going to the back, but that’s not the trunk
She had some Louis luggage, put your bags up in the front
You catch us in the kitchen, and we be cooking powder
These niggas ain't fresher if you put ‘em in the shower

[Hook]
