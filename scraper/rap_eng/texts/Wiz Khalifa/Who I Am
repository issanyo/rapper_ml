[Intro]
Yeah
You are now tuned in to W.E.E.D
I am your host, Mr. EZ Rider, ya dug?
Always rollin' up back to back
But right now we gon' take you on a smooth ride
Straight outta the 412
My man Wiz Khalifa here
Something y'all can all sing along to

[Verse 1]
I be rolling
Riding
Oh so fly
I be so, so high
She see I'm that guy you wanna ride with
Like my car? Get inside it
You excited?
I don't blame you
Everywhere I go, all them hoes act the same too
I don't wanna date you
I just wanna take you home
And do somethin' grown folks can relate to
You think I'mma play you?
I would hate to
Long as you stay cool
We should be straight, boo
Bitch, I'm a straight fool
No I can't lie
Don't let a day go by where I ain't high
Pump your brake lights
That means slow it down
Know who I is
And now it's 'bout to go down
You wanna roll now?
Well, let's ride out
Right now
I'll show you what I'm 'bout

[Hook]
Try to front when you see me in the club
Bitch, you know who I am
Gettin' weeded with a pocket full of dubs
I bet you know who I am
They be runnin' up and showin' all this love
'Cause they know who I am
Didn't notice it, but now you're goin' nuts
'Cause you know who I am

[Verse 2]
I be caking
Making
All this money
Look honey
I ain't faking
Say that you taken
That's cool with me
'Cause you and your boyfriend
Ain't got shit to do with me
Truthfully
Real talk
I pimp hard
She tell them lames get lost
Bottles of Patron
Good green in my cigar
See you and your girls
Watching me and my niggas
Now that your with us
If not Wiz
Young fuckin' rap star
I just get it how I live
This ain't the first time
That you heard about Wiz
So how are you feelin' me?
Don't front and act like it is
Say you ain't the type to just
Let anyone pound
Just letting me come 'round
Now she a bus down
Feeling my convo?
Then mami let's ride out
Right now
I'll show you what I'm 'bout

[Hook]
Try to front when you see me in the club
Bitch, you know who I am
Gettin' weeded with a pocket full of dubs
I bet you know who I am
They be runnin' up and showin' all this love
'Cause they know who I am
Didn't notice it, but now you're goin' nuts
'Cause you know who I am
