[Hook]
I be working all day, day, baby girl, that's why my grind pays off
I be showin' love everywhere that I go, I don't know what they on
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up

[Bridge]
Baby girl said you gon' come, come to find out she ain't gon' stay
Niggas they be comin' too strong, I can wait for another day
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up

[Verse 1]
Hope you really got your mind made up
Hustle with my homeboys, crime paid off
I'm a real boss, don't gotta get laid off
Grind everyday, never take a day off, oh
Now we all came up
Ain't with my squad then they all strangers
Break it all down and roll up a paper
Need it all now, ain't waitin' for later, no
I be so player
Wanna know how much this KK worth
Love from the Gang, so I put 'em on first
Put it on my chain and I rep to the dirt
Who gon' roll with me
Top floor blow 'bout an O with me
Fly the pack to New York for me
Cops [?] from the store for me

[Hook]
I be workin' all day, day, baby girl, that's why my grind pays off
I be showin' love everywhere that I go, I don't know what they on
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up

[Verse 2]
Baby girl said she was [?] she ain't gon' chase
I'ma put her on a paper plane, I'ma take her to another place
Told me she been goin' through some things
So you know my time, she ain't gon' waste
She said she's tired of fuckin' with lames
They all in her face, champagne by the case
I'ma roll you a joint, make sure that you taste it, I'll make you face it We go out to Vegas, she put on that lace and I'ma embrace it
She make time for me whenever I call, Khalifa her favorite
There ain't no replacement

[Hook]
I be workin' all day, day, baby girl, that's why my grind pays off
I be showin' love everywhere that I go, I don't know what they on
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up

[Bridge]
Baby girl said you gon' come, come to find out, she ain't gon' stay
Niggas they be comin' too strong, I can wait for another day
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up
I ain't tryna press you no more, unless you really got your mind made up

Seriously, like you're driving me crazy. I called you four times. I don't know what's going on between us. Like I don't know whether to be mad or be confused right now. Like, I'm not trying to get in the way of anything that you're doing whatsoever, [?]
