[Intro]
You still hear every word that they say
But these days they ain't making no sound
You still had me thinking I'm crazy
Wish I knew then what I know now

[Verse 1]
You don't know what I been through
So who are you to judge me? (Judge me)
Still don't know if I believe there's anything above me (Let's go)
I've been numb for so long, wanna feel something
Look in the mirror, I don't like who I'm becoming
I don't know my place, I done lost my way
Think that I won't break
I don't know my place, I done lost my way
Think that I won't break

[Chorus]
You still hear every word that they say
But these days they ain't making no sound
You still had me thinking that I'm crazy
Wish I knew then what I know now (Wish I knew)
Nobody really knows me, I keep it all inside
You still have me thinking I'm crazy
I’m sick of feeling lonely
Wish I knew then what I know now

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, know how to circle out
Know how to move when they doubt
Know what to choose when I'm movin' around
Say you through with them clowns
But you still fuckin' 'round with them
Every now and then, in my DM, see the different cars I be in
Most of the time I just be with them once, and don't call 'em again
But for you I play it safe, don't know why
I ain't used to usin' brakes, once I close the door you can't escape
Puttin' KK in a plane, different strains
Got her feeling different things, niggas talk, still ain't the gang
I like bigger planes, glasses of gin, bottles of champagne
Diamond chains, bitches knowin' my name, is you leavin' or stayin'?

[Chorus]
You still hear every word that they say
But these days they ain't making no sound (Uh)
You still have me thinking I'm crazy (Yeah)
Wish I knew then what I know now
Nobody really knows me, I keep it all inside
You still have me thinking I'm crazy
I’m sick of feeling lonely
Wish I knew then what I know now

[Outro]
Nobody really knows me, I keep it all inside
I’m sick of feeling lonely
Wish I knew then what I know now
