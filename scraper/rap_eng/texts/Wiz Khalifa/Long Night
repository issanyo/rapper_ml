[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Champagne, paper planes, this gon' be a long night
Bad bitches, good weed, this gon' be a long night
Bombay and lemonade, this gon' be a long night
Thirty girls at my place, this gon' be a long night
This gon' be a long night
Champagne, paper planes, this gon' be a long night
Bad bitches, good weed, this gon' be a long night
Thirty girls at my place, this gon' be a long night

[Verse 1: Gary Clark Jr.]
It's about to be a long night, matter of fact, a longer day
A fifteen hour private flight, champagne, paper planes
I'm about to pop a xan, wake me up when we land
Nothing less than a hundred racks up in my hand
I'm about to take off, islands, Turks and Caicos
Said, I'm all about my paper dance, that dollar sack is pesos
All I make is cash (cash), all I smoke is gas (gas)
All my whips is fast, two hundred plus on the deck
All I ever wanted was a bad bitch and some moolah (and some moolah)
All I ever wanted was that Rollie from my jeweler (from my jeweler)
I'm making moves, yeah, I know how to maneuver
Set my clock a year ahead and making money in the future

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Champagne, paper planes, this gon' be a long night
Bad bitches, good weed, this gon' be a long night
Bombay and lemonade, this gon' be a long night
Thirty girls at my place, this gon' be a long night
This gon' be a long night
Champagne, paper planes, this gon' be a long night
Bad bitches, good weed, this gon' be a long night
Thirty girls at my place, this gon' be a long night

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
Yeah I'm in a big body, big booty girl sitting by me
Then I get a call from one of these broads that say they got kids by me
I'm in a big body, big booty girl sitting by me
I got a stick by me, tell them Pok√©mons, to get from 'bout me
I do not sniff molly, pour three of that clean guac in it
I'm in the Gucci flip flops getting top by a freak thottie
Why would I bat back? On G-O-D, I kept it G 'bout it
Why would I buy a piece when I could kick a door and take chip outta there
Out here for seven hundred this year, they were like three up on me
I'm finna take everything out the bank, Teller come see about me
She wanna run one on the gang, I said I'ma see about it
You see the lil baby over there? I fuck with her, she a thousand

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Champagne, paper planes, this gon' be a long night
Bad bitches, good weed, this gon' be a long night
Bombay and lemonade, this gon' be a long night
Thirty girls at my place, this gon' be a long night
This gon' be a long night
Champagne, paper planes, this gon' be a long night
Bad bitches, good weed, this gon' be a long night
Thirty girls at my place, this gon' be a long night
