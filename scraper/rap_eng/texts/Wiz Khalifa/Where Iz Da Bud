We're not against weed rap

But we are against those gangs

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
See I be rolling up (up)
Right in the club (club)
Only them joints, don't fuck with blunts (blunts)
Don't fuck with blunts (blunts)
Hand me another one
Smoking and drinking, I live my life like the Weeknd
Don't let me in, then I sneak in
I fuck your bitch 'cause she creeping

In places you, can't even, be in
Rocking my chain ever since I was a
Teen, a nigga, try me

And grab me a joint
