Nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good, had it made
But nigg Im from the burg I was in the hood everyday
But now Im hopping offa Jets
These people cutting me checks
And I say people cause Im rich
And rich people show me respect (Show me respect)
This come from Atrium, hes from Collette
These diamonds I got on, they are baguettes
On DBS so all of em see me, used to just be that dude on the
Net
Now Im all on your TV, butler ask what I wanna get, Bentley
Or Lamborghini?
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all in Waikiki
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all with Luigi
Smoking on 8 ounces told myself ain't often that sleepy
Realest nigga out, it ain't hard to believe me
Thats why all the people that you know try their hardest to
Be me

Cause nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good got it made
But nigg Im from the burg now roll up the herb
