Oh

[Hook]
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?
And real people do real things, so what you here for?
A stand up nigga stand up for the rest of their life (Yeah)
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice

[Verse 1]
Uh, it go, one for the money
Two for the niggas gettin’ it
Three for the niggas that be running from it
You gotta grind if you really want it
Don’t hesitate
You came this far now finish out the whole dream
Nobody said it would be easy though, just stick to your plan
They don’t understand
Going up against the odds
Having no regards
Make our own laws, you could be your own boss
But they don’t tell you that
All you need is a foundation to stand on
And you can build it then the limit is the sky
Until then I’m with my niggas gettin' high
And plus we with it you all know the business

[Hook]
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?
And real people do real things, so what you here for?
A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice

[Verse 2]
Oh what did you think I would never get another M?
Niggas only in the game cause we let ‘em in
We ain’t check they chains
We ain’t put ‘em on blast and expose them fools for everything
We ain’t tell you how they really lames
And that they don’t do shit that they get on TV and say
We ain’t mad though, we on the coast of France for three days
I’m tryna make a play, marijuana steam sauna
Young nigga from the bottom cracking lobster, eating pasta
You would think that he a mobster
La Familia, no you not familiar
Just got a bigger safe, now it’s time to fill it up, nigga

[Hook]
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?
And real people do real things, so what you waiting for?
A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives (Stand your ass up)
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice (Do something about it)
