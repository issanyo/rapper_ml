[Intro: Beedie]
It's Beedie, hah
[?], you ready there?

[Hook] (x3)
You'd better believe it, so brake the car
And don't forget to cross your fingers
And make a wish, I'll pray to God

(I made a wish that I’d be the star)

[Verse 1: Beedie]
In my life I feel like I had it all
Seen a lot, what? Seen a lot
Wish I could sit with piña colada
With my feet up, but not out of my mind
Sip this to any kind of song
But the song that make you just wanna shine
And we tryna [?] so Oakland
All main rappers, so alike now
Been on my grind, cross that bridge
Seen dark times what it is, what it is?
In my lunch, don't touch my chips
Man, though this hand, I clench my fist
Ever get the strain in my fingers, crossed
‘Cause of their list I pay my cause
Now take my loss, so get to know me
Heart, heart breaks and dead homies
See what I’ve done so far
Go go hard till I'm dead gone
Now I'm here the star
That's free promo, I'll play along
My attitude: fuck everybody
Doing me, hey, I need to love me
Up early, I'm scheming
And I know it's real, cause I seen 'em
I ain't dreaming. Right?

[Hook]
You'd better believe it, so brake the car
And don't forget to cross your fingers
And make a wish, I'll pray to God

(I made a wish that I’d be the star)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, floating off wax
Ask where I be going, and trust where I'm at
In a brand new Porsche, blowing strong
Man, you can do anything when your money long
Like tat your whole body
All this hard work I put in, catchin' up finally
And I travel so much, got me thinking all cloudy
And my niggas all riding
And you know I got that strong when I pull up, it's not a prolly
K, come to my hotel room, I got goons in the lobby, Church
I look the game for what it's worth
I smoke more than what you worth
Ride to my city, did a bunch of dirt
Balmain ass and expensive shirt
'Bout money but the drugs is first
Niggas turn into fam, but they was busses first
And there's nothing worse
Wax thicker than some Mrs. Butterworth's
And a door in the freezer
Smoke till I got amnesia
Still shop, bad teaser
Y'all know the procedure, hands up!

Yeah, mhm
Khalifa man, Beedie what up?
Taylor Gang
Nah, I ain’t go lie, man, I'm high as fuck!

[Hook] (x2)
You'd better believe it, so brake the car
And don't forget to cross your fingers
And make a wish, I'll pray to God

(I made a wish that I’d be the star)

[Outro: Beedie]
Can't believe that I’d get so far
I made a wish that I’d be the star
In my life I feel like I had it all
It all, it all, it all
