NIgga like me be smokin while Im drivin
Gettin higher than the Bee Gees saying we both just staying alive and
Watchin the time go by, climbin
Told you Id get enough hash, to make a mountain
And you can sit right on your ass doubtin
While Im somewhere rollin up grass, goin up where the clouds is
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin wit em, I say if them niggas get that high man I ain't fuckin wit em
Doin nothin wit em, rollin up or puffin wit em
Goin on the road, doin shows, or gettin duckies wit em
Ive been smokin in my pictures since Myspace. You niggas extracurricular, bitch I fly straight. (Ay, ay)
Some niggas try that shit for nothin, but I just tell them to do what they do
(do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too
(you can too)
Just give me weed in my joint, and I ain't need it for nothin, homie Im straight. (homie Im straight)
The same way I came into the game, If Im ever goin, then I am goin the same way
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin with no other drug. (4x)
Nigga like me be smokin while Im rappin. And my homie smoke like I smoke, so we both just make it happen. NIggas say they be smokin, they be actin. Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoke one with the captain. High as fuck, choked up in my cabin. Got some OG from a vana it was rolled up in a napkin
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers. Never smokin that bullshit, with the fucked up names or them flavors
I remember puttin weed in videos, niggas thought I was insane
Now every time, I turn on a video, I see the exact same thing
Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool. You niggas ain't got it all, you niggas just ain't you. That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose. Lil homie I got a ball of something you can't do. So suckers hate. (hate)
Some niggas try that shit for nothin, but I just tell them to do what they do
(do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too
(you can too)
Just give me weed in my joint, and I ain't need it for nothin, homie Im straight. (homie Im straight)
The same way I came into the game, If Im ever goin, then I am goin the same way
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin with no other drug. (4x)
