[Intro]
Damn...
Don't
Don't
Damn

[Verse 1]
Yeah, don't leave
Cause you're my oxygen
Without you I won't breathe
You're everything I want, need
For you I wear my heart on a short sleeve
I know some things need changing
That takes time; I need more, please
Say I ain't do everything I could've done
Like the shit that I did ain't good enough
Your friends said they been would've left
Ain't do you right, so you head to the left
I can't say that I blame you
Or ever thought that it would be this painful
People do it everyday, I can change too
But dealing with the heartbreak's what you can't do
True
And that's as real get
What you feel ain't easy to deal with

[Hook]
When you find the girl you love
Has gone
You ask yourself why life
Must go on
You beg your Lord above
To send someone your way
But deep inside you pray
Oh, He'll bring her back someday

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't go
How to live my life without you
I just don't know
What you feel in this relationship
It's not that it can't
It just won't grow
I say I love you, say it don't show
Fuck the money then, them gifts don't count
What about the smaller things you needed
And why the fuck you had to leave 'fore I seen it
Damn, I need your love like a weed stick
Me without you, like Kathy no Regis
I kept secrets
And couldn't apologize enough times
For messing with that freak bitch
But I can still tell that you're leaving
And like I said, I can't blame you the least bit
The crying shame is
That time's changing
Best friends become strangers
That's how it is

[Hook]
When you find the girl you love
Has gone
You ask yourself why life
Must go on
You beg your Lord above
To send someone your way
But deep inside you pray
Oh, He'll bring her back someday
