Uh, Yea..
As the joint burns, to the point that it stinging my fingers
Tracks my talk show platform...
Part Phil Donahue part Jerry Springer
Momma come when I bring her..
She go where I send her
Kept it trill from the beginning
From square 1 maintain square business
Dont concern yourself with my minglin with otha bitches
So crafty, mastered the flow Alaska cold
Silent foot assassin approach
High when I stroll
Not even leaving foot prints in the snow...
You know

[Hook]
Can't believe you caaaaaaaaalllllldddd
Soo ooooooooooooooo whooooooaaaa
So I see your face again, back where ive been travelin
Time.. I think it seems, to have its grip on me
Friends they say they call it for you
No matter what I offer you
Can't believe in history, living in this misery
So cooooooooooooooooolllllddddd
So So cooooooooooollllldddd
I can't believe you caaaallllllllllllddd
