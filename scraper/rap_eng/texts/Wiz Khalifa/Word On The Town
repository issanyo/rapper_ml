[Intro: Juicy J]
Yeah, I'm still just hustling, man
I don't know about y'all, it's going down then
You see, I've been doing this shit, so, this shit ain't nothing equal
Let's go

[Hook x2: Juicy J]
Word on the town, that you niggas snitching
Word on the town, I'm fucking niggas bitches
Word on the town, that you ain't selling dope
Word on the town, that you niggas going broke

[Verse 1: Juicy J & Wiz Khalifa]
Chop up buzz, we kill this shit
No twenty-twos, no Emmitt Smith
Pulled out on you and let it rip
Killed y'all dogs, like Michael Vick
Yellow tape, first forty eight
Don't give a fuck if they catch a case
Done gunplays in broad daylight
No mask on they barren face
Barren face when we get them
Don't become a victim
Shoulda used his intuition
When I caught him slipping
Open banana peel ass, nigga
We got your number
Put them in the trunk
Yreat them like some Louie luggage
Just in case a nigga think he finna take mine
Imma give his ass a clip
Tell the pussy nigga, take five
Real street niggas, get it how they live
Cut that gangsta shit out
'Cause that ain't who you is

[Hook: Juicy J] [x2]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas telling, aw, man, they ain't getting money
How you get caught up for a strap and tell on your homie
Nigga, there's rules to this game and you ain't living by them
Like you don't talk about them drugs, if you really buy them
You don't talk about them goons, if you really got them
And you don't talk about them bodies, if they really dropping
You from where I'm from, you don't do no talking
When the police come, we just change the topic
In my hood niggas really robbing
You get your brains blown off, if you don't use precaution
Take off your head just be like what the cost is
In Pittsburgh it's Taylor Gang and nigga I'm a boss man, uh

[Bridge: Juicy J]
Word on the town, that you niggas snitching
Word on the town, I'm fucking niggas bitches

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Jackers in Port Arthur talking â€˜bout taking mines
If you run up on that Bentley, bitch, your life is on the line
Yeah, bitch, I'm on parole, but that thing in my possession
Ain't gon' be no ho and pimping, ain't gon' be no disrespecting
And I don't owe you niggas shit and I don't need no new buddies
I don't wanna fuck your bitch, cause the ho is too slutty
Jaws too nutty, kiss her lips, you eat a dick
I ain't came out here to play, I'm out here representing this shit
I'm not the king of the south, y'all can fight over the title
But I got more hoes calling me, than American Idol
Young Pimp C holding it down, come around with that fuck shit
We'll leave you shaking on the ground

[Hook x2: Juicy J]
