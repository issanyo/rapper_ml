[Intro]
Uh, uh, yeah man
Let me spit somethin' real to you
Yea hahahah, uh

[Hook]
Just take a look at the way them diamonds glow
I know why you niggas hate
You know we get this dough in every way
And, oh
They chase me down
When I'm on the road
My face is known in every state
Them bitches fuck me 'cause they know my name

[Verse 1]
Blunt flickin'
Gin cup sippin'
'Nother hundred thousand dollar mission
I be
Out of reach
Check your time piece
Shorty got that look of love, and I'm I-Z
Nothin' like them other lil niggas, I'm me
Keep a couple rowdy cuz niggas by me
And I'm on a good weed diet
As a young'n I was told
That if you can make the plane, go fly it
In another lane
So these lames wan' try it
And bitches' all the same
They just wanna fuck the pilot
My change get me brain
Chain start a riot
What you hot for?
Used to be ballin' my nigga
So what you stop for?
I'm top floor
Blowin' by the O-bama
And security don't give me no drama
I'm lookin' for Impalas
While I'm drivin'
'Cause I'm prolly gettin' high
And you hatin' on me
Prolly cause I'm fly
Die

[Hook]
Just take a look at the way them diamonds glow
I know why you niggas hate

[Verse 2]
Yeah, wear your seat belt
You gon' need help
To these niggas I'm Neil
On them bitches I'm Lee Phelps
My jeans fit, I don't need belts
Still spending grands
Just to hold up my pants
Tats in my skin
Neck, face, and my hands
OZ's on the road
Kush roll when I land
Takin' shots
Writin' Taylor Gang in the sand
And everywhere I go
Hoes know I'm the man
A superstar
You niggas are livin' street dreams
I'mma call all my haters
And form a street team
See, I'm that level of greatness
You somewhere between
And I've been gettin' this cake since
I was a preteen
And my swagger is peaking
Nigga, look at my watch
Your shit is peeking
Your emotions are leaking
You niggas jealous
I can smell it
Swag

[Hook]
Just take a look at the way them diamonds glow
I know why you niggas hate
You know we get this dough in every way

[Verse 3]
Got her goin' nuts
Like a nigga never ever knew her
Rollin' with a star
Need a dime lookin' Hollywood
And I be off some shit that have me high
Prolly off some Kush
Too many numbers in my phone
Copped a few, another few
Because she know my name
She know you're lame
She fuck me 'cause she know a nigga Taylor Gang
Every time on the road she showin' love in every way
Always with the baddest bitch that show me love in every way
Party in my hometown, feel the breeze in every state
Boy she got a booty on her, looties all up out of state
I been on this fly shit, the shit that niggas try, boy
Up in niggas' plans, why you niggas tryna fly, boy?

[Hook]
Just take a look at the way them diamonds glow
I know why you niggas hate
You know we get this dough in every way
And, oh
They chase me down
When I'm on the road
My face is known in every state
Them bitches fuck me 'cause they know my name
