[Intro]
Ohhhh, oohhhhhhhh

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, first place, first place, she want first place
First place, hit a home run, skipped first base
She want first place, first place
Not the runner up, she want first place
Cross the finish line, she in first place
First place, first place, first place
First place, first place, first place

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Met her at the club, took her back to my hotel
Say she got a man, fuck her, when she won't tell
Leavin' out the crib high as fuck with no plane
Rollin' Mary J, now I smoke every day
I blow KK on the regular
Fuck me like you said you would
She ain't down to do it, get another bitch instead of her
Bombay on my breathe and all my niggas on your left
Took all your bitches, ain't nothin' left
She sucked a dick, she passed the test
She don't want the runner up, she want first place
Went to (?) and fucked her on the first date
Bitches love Young Khalifa in the worst way
I fuck 'em once and pass 'em off cause I ain't thirsty
Cake like it's my birthday
I sent ya on the lurker page
She come to the show and break me off now she in first place
She skip past them bitches bullshit and she in first place
Her friend eat it while she suck this dick, now she in first place
Put it all in her face

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, first place, first place, she want first place
First place, hit a home run, skipped first base
She want first place, first place
Not the runner up, she want first place
Cross the finish line, she in first place
First place, first place, first place
First place, first place, first place

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Macaroni, pretty Tony, I'm just tryna make the bitch
Pimp, player, ho layer, I'm just tryna break the bitch
Bottom bitch, real slick, you got skills to make me rich
Poodle noodles, face like a poodle ass takin' shit
Double dick
Down south bitch eat that cornbread
Bounce that ass on a hard dick with some warm head
Graffiti on her body, I see she got long weave
Maserati, go to my goal on my skis
And she got a job with a salary
The bitch went to Howard University
Credit good, she can take me on a shoppin' spree
Baby daddy wanna hold her back, lock and key
In the back of the Ghost, gave me head, wasn't scared
She understood in life you gotta cheat to get ahead
It was our first date, I couldn't let her skate
She wanted first place, so I shot a nut in her face
