I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly never change
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly be the same

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Every time I try to get my life together someone seems
Whatcha doing tryna ruin my hopes and my dreams
Push away and always go get away
And keep some grams in my pants have a hit a day
Am I wrong am I right, do I care living life
On my own, cop a zone, what it feeling like
Transition crimination whatch you call it mack upon
Do my thang with my gang put your back up on
Recollect and reflect on how I used to be
I'm probably the same way cud' cause I'm goin' keep it G
Secretly sactredly yall wake and bake with me
Solo creepin on the dolo tippin' like a lolo
Fans come in vans with they clans expecting to get that photo
Won't need to come back stage and have a chance to hit my dodo
Cool individual, I'm never too good
See Mack is from the hood and never Hollywood

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly never change
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly be the same

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Growing up I ain't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and rolling stuff for I was old enough
Getting every dollar and fold it up
Putin' all my weed in papers instead of blunts so they could know it's us
Every party we showing up, baggy full of pre-rolls
Light it up and pass it you holding that one too long nigga matter fact you can have it
Another one in rotation my motivation is cabage my Rollie face filled with carrots
And niggas think they are but they know that they ain't comparing
And they ain't doing no harm but I don't think I'm really caring
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
From your broke ass, I just keep hustlin all the time and gettin more cash
And rolling weed you smell the chronic when I go past
You look at me and then put down notes on your notepad
Yeah, I'm kinda high, but you should know that

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly never change
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly be the same
