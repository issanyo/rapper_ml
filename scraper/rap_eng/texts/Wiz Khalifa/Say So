[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything you do, smoke weed

[Chorus]
Time flies, no lie (no lie)
I'd rather be getting high (high)
Ridin' with my niggas getting right (right)
It ain't over 'till I say so (say so)
Time flies, no lie (no lie)
I'd rather be getting high (high)
Ridin' with my niggas getting right (right)
It ain't over 'till I say so (say so)

[Verse]
Hold up, roll up, mo money to throw up
Walk in the club, everybody go up
A hundred and 50K just to show up
And everything ain't what it seems
It's hard to live somebody else's dreams
I put all my trust in my team
Know that my money straight, won't let nothing come in between
Politic with my fam, never let the hate intervene
Smoking weed out of Vegas and thanking God for the scene
Thinking back to when we ain't have it
Made it on, came far, needed practice
Moving forward while you thinking backwards
Never sleep, hardly need a mattress
I kick my shoes off my feet, then fall asleep in my seat
Claiming you on your job, well doggie, it ain't complete
Claiming you got the squad but you niggas can't compete
Came with too many broads, can't fit them all in my suite
What can I say? Bring the champagne glasses, roll the J's faster

[Chorus]
Time flies, no lie (no lie)
I'd rather be getting high (high)
Ridin' with my niggas getting right (right)
It ain't over 'till I say so (say so)
Time flies, no lie (no lie)
I'd rather be getting high (high)
Ridin' with my niggas getting right (right)
It ain't over 'till I say so (say so)
