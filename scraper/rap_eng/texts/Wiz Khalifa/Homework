[Verse 1: MXXNLIGHT]
I been in my zone (I been in my zone)
I just wanna know (I just wanna know)
Why you left me in the cold (why you left me in the cold)
Now you're blowin' up my phone (now you're blowin' up my phone)
Only when I get a check, you wanna call me
Every other night, you go out poppin' molly
People think you're nice, but girl you're really naughty
I hit up Santa, had to tell him you're a thotty

[Chorus: MXXNLIGHT]
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, got all the papers rolled
Used to be Backwoods, now it's cones
Fuck a DM, I'm slidin' through your home
You sendin' them pics to my phone
You like that I'm well known
But still be hella low
On point, your friends ain't gotta know
Don't go tellin' 'em 'bout my stroke
She might want to find out
Ain't nothin' new, this happens all the time
Pressure break pipes, hit me late night
Ain't the gang, it ain't right, yeah

[Chorus: MXXNLIGHT]
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Finally free, high off the tree
Nigga had a lockdown, she was under siege
Wanna be flyin' places and smokin' in peace
On the runnin' team with my own machine
They ain't comin' close, that's why you puttin' on your clothes
And rushin' out the door when it's over
Nowhere near sober, nigga say he need closure
I just throw another pound your way and hope
Next time I see you, you'll know how to roll
Gang or ain't, nothing at all

[Chorus: MXXNLIGHT]
You'll never be my wife not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
I was born a star
It's gang or nothin' at all
Got your bitch tryna FaceTime the call
Heh heh heh
