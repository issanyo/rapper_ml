Ayee I could be your bartender , tell me what you sipping on
Girl Im not a travel agent so what you tripping on
You said I think I can make it happen cause I'm famous naw I'm just trying to get it cracking cause we faded
Take you to my crib spend some time alone
Barely over 21 that means you kinda grown
And I got it tat tat tatted up
Come down to that paper imma stack it up
Where you going baby girl ? back it up
