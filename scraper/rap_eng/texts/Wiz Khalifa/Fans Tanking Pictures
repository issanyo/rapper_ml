[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
The fans takin pictures of me
Can't keep these bitches off me
Police up and down the street
But I'm still spliffin homie
Breeze keep a Glicker on him; do a nigga wrong, boy
Niggas want my head now that my money gettin long boy
More than just a song boy
Thinkin I'm just rappin to you
Niggas keep they ratchet
This is real shit
That can happen to you
Come out here and ask em do you
Know about the nigga Wiz?
Ever heard of Rostrum Records?
Know who Kev the Hustla is?
Well bitch, act like ya know me
A young'n, bro
But my dough
Stack'd like I'm grown'n
I'm the black Steve Austin
I pull up and I stunna
And do just what I wanna
Drunk and full of marijuana
Your shine low
I'm somethin like a high beam
Gotta be as high as me
To see things how I see
I don't even drive no more
I let the Ho's ride me
After I see ID
Ain't gon Kelly rob me
I'm just bein honest
Bein modest
I done tried bein
But niggas hated so I throw it in they faces
Let em get outta line, we goin show em to they places
These shots ain't straight up, they come with a couple chasers
And the baddest hoes chase us
I'm runnin to the money
In the back
Dime bitch up in my lap
Gettin blunted
Ya dugg?

[Verse 2: Kev Tha Hustla]
The work raw so I'm coppin now for old money
Hustlin since I was born and think you gettin old money
Look dummy, see I'm all
About a meal to gain
Young'n off the porch for that young money like Lil Wayne
And all this smoke got my eyes on Yao Ming
Street pharmaceutical, damn shoot it and shoulder lean
I'm only bout that green; weed, and currency
Ignorant flow, no I never
Show em courtesy
Cause I'm a star too, doin what the stars do, roll em back to back and then I climb to the stars woo!
Yeah you
Thought the boy was slippin but I wasn't
I connect like the movies get it cheaper by the dozen
Gotta freak with some cousins
They be always on call
Like the WNBS them ho's love balls
I got em trained like 1, 2 suck and blow
Ice box cold wrist, Wiz roll another 0!
