[Verse 1 - Currency]
You think you got the bond cause I rolled you a joint?
I smoke with all mine, baby girl, what's your point?
Don't front, you in the back of a long line
Trying to get in, cause only members inside
Trees get twisted up like fingers in gang signs
Purple Kushions broke my fall, I fell from a grapevine
Super high, from the free throw line, I'm
Drexler status, glide the espionage
Many a jealous eyes scrutinze the wise
But the Jets in the house like the curtains and the blinds
It hurt to see me shine, that's why they frowning all the time
In they internet videos, digital CB4s
Angry orangutans, I'm arranging my sneakers
I'm the action on the court, you the gum stuck to the bleachers
I think I'm Paul Pierce, I think I'm Rondo
High off that headband, you dying on that hydro

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
I thought of this fresh off a bong rip
My bitch next to me, getting undressed for me
Running bath water, playing her favorite songs
While I get another one lit
Don't usually smoke at all but say tonight she'll take a hit
That's understood
From the smell, and by what I paid
You know it's good
Them niggas with me? They from the hood
Now we through parties in the sky
I'm on the 42nd floor, now that's super high
Champagne, more paper planes than you can fly
Them young niggas fell soon as they tried
When the paparazzi flash, I'll be counting all this cash
Plotting a million about how I can build a mountain out of hash

[Hook - Ne-Yo]
All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
Cause we are super high

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]
I'm getting money, no Illuminati
My pain never went in vain, it's all over my body
Get the spliff in my Mr. Bughatti
Kick it with my lil' homies, a Mr. Miyagi
I gotta buy my niggas each a pound
Tweaking up our sneaker style, passing reefer 'round
Spitting only lethal rounds, speakers beating down
Not talking munchies when I say my niggas eating now
Promoter gave me 40 thou, I think we even now
Pina colada, paper smoking, Garden of Eden now
Taylor Gang is what we bleed about
Jet setters in places you only read about

[Bridge - Wiz Khalifa]
And now, everywhere I go
It's so strong, they ask me where I get my smoke
Bitches don't have to guess, they know
I keep one rolled up, we can do whatever you want
Smoking pina colada papers, baby girl
We don't fuck with them blunts
Unless I'm with the Boss

[Verse 4 - Rick Ross]
If you looking for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high (Super duper, super duper high)
You getting yours, I'm getting mine
