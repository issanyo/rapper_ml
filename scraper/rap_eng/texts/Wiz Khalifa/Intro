[Verse]
With the hunger of a Chris Wallace back in '94
I like to welcome y'all to rock with PG's youngest ball
From the bottom of the pot, yea i'm the Pitts of the Burgh
With the kids on the curb, and small time, is pitching the herb
I'm back, and those who didn't previously know what i'm crack
To the people, i'm legalized the lethal
We all got problems involving the root of evil
But they caught me non-dodging, long arming the people, yup!
And for the record, I ain't no half stepper
I rose from the city of steel, the streets greedy for real
Cats chasing their paper, thats basic
Mathematics, hate to run the streets but took a staff at it
As I look back at hard it seems
I remember when this music thing was all but a dream
But i'm here for my city
And can't name no one that's near fucking with me
I'm 'bout to make history
