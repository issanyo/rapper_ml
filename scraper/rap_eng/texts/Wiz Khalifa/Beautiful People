[Hook: Sia] x2
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say "go, go, go"
Beautiful people don't stress, stress, stress
We never rest
Beautiful people say "yes"

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, kills 'em
Took her home and the sex was so bomb she killed him
She don't do thousands, she do millions
Take all that paper, stack it up to the ceiling
There's a lot of ballers in the the building, and she's trying to catch one
The last was the right nigga, the next was the best one
If she get a hold of you, problems, you'll get some
Better get outta Dodge, outer space, Jetsons
She looked me into my face and lied
She put me into her mouth, I died
She took me back to her place
And showed me what's left of the niggas who ever told me to never try

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Ooh, you ain't even trying to catch a man
You just fall up in the club, doing what you do
New hair, new shoes, they've been told to stay away from you
But they break the rules
Sad to say but they deserve to lose
She's a black girl, baby, they don't lose
Should have payed attention to the clues
Now she stuck to you like glue
Now you like what, like who, write what, right there
Call you when you wanna roll up and make moves
Now the time's up, now it's clear
Gotta get the fuck up outta here
Real niggas gone do what they gotta do
Now baby-girl I ain't hating, I'm just using some hesitation
Some niggas got beef with you, I don't blame em
That's that bullshit, so I'm skating

[Hook]

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, smoke weed all day
I don't got time for that bullshit
