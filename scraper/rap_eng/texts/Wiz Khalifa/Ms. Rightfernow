[Intro]
Aye now I could say my name but (say my name but)
Your bitch already knows it (knows it)
Got no problem spending paper (paper)
I got it so I blow it (I blow it)

[Verse 1]
Shawty what's your name put your number in my sidekick
Captain of the spaceship, you're fucking with a pilot
Say she wanna ride well I can give her mileage
Plus I live the star life won't you come and try it
Say I'm wrong I can do that pussy right
And when another time zone I can be there by tonight
Beat it I can like couple bottles of patron
Do some things tonight no problem cause' we grown
So Ima' pass go, and if you feel the way I feel then
Let's quit talking about it shawty let's go
Do you like it fast slow, say she gotta need for speed
If I can drive then I'm a need a crash course oh
So I threw it on her shawty threw it back at her freaky shit
You do it to me I'm a do it back and them scratches goin'
Ruin the tattoos that's on my back
So I don't know what to do with it but you know how to act

[Hook x2]
Looks like I'll be here with you all night long
And I wanna see it so I beat her with the lights on
I ain't no tease I wanna be your main attraction
Roll camera please I think it's time for some action
Some action, whoa

[Verse 2]
Then we can play it right back
I hope your kitty cat mean so I can bite back
Take off them jeans drink this night cap say men are from mars
You can be my venus fly trap
Damn your grip tight, let me put it on you slow
And then I'mma speed up at the light
Girl your body look too right to even try to put a price on
So I just leave the lights on
I'll have you tryin' different kinds of shit when you make it up in my room
I told you girl that I'm a hit it in high definition
Keep your lines in your head but in the bed we get unscripted
Aye... beat while they home I don't take them out to
Dinner, I need shawty on my camera aye

[Hook x2]
Looks like I'll be here with you all night long
And I wanna see it so I beat her with the lights on
I ain't no tease I wanna be your main attraction
Roll camera please I think it's time for some action
Some action, whoa
