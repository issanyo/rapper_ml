[Hook]
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you

[Verse 1]
You've been blowin' up my phone
Talkin' bout you're tired of bein' alone
You've been lookin' for something strong
You feel strange cause I might be the one
You ain't used to just holdin' on
You put a couple dudes in position, they did you wrong
But I'ma go on straight to the mission
Put my key in ignition
You should talk but with me you just listen
From the seat, to the whip, to the crib
Now we on the bed
I know what you sayin' but that's over with
I don't really like to argue
No matter what we goin' through
It's not a big deal, we'll get over it
I ain't never had a chick like you
So ain't no tellin' what a nigga might do
Black and yellow diamonds and the wrist light blue
Just call me when you need me, I'ma dip right through

[Hook]
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, back and forth
Just went through my things, what you do that for?
You just wanna catch a nigga when he slack off
But you don't want to be the reason that I pack up, nah
Don't even let 'em get you mad though
They just some rebound bitches off the backboard
See you the reason I'm always in the trap for
And if them niggas come, you open up the back door
You know
Yeah we argue and fight
But I'd rather fuck you all night
We can just get high, cook me dinner
And live a comfortable life
You can keep it to yourself
I don't want nobody else
I'm the realest nigga left
You can put me to the test
I ain't nothin' like the rest
Go on, get it off your chest

[Hook]
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you

[Outro]
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
