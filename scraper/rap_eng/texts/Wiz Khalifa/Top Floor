Started out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets
She wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you ain’t letting go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in

Oh
First class help you in the game like a free throw
Fill my bank up with cash, my glass with Clicquot
You ain't gotta tell your friends what we talk about
All the places that we go, we go
You're mine for the night, your man try and repo, oh
Work nights never sleep so you think she got no job
Go to school during the week on the weekend we go hard
Live so large, let you go tear down the mall like it’s your card
It's no problem, go ahead and sing it girl, this is your song

Started out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets
She wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you and I go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in

Oh, nothin you can tell us, they get jealous when we show up show up
Make you feel like a little girl again, but fuck you like a grown up
High as you can be it's like the dream you never woke from
My life's like a movie, get ready for your close up
Pour bottles and toast up
Your man in your phone trying to see what your plans is
So what, you still turn up my songs soon as they playing it
Know what the sound is my new talks and you ain't saying shit
I'm a call you soon as I land
Probably roll some weed ride up on the beach while you tan
Party every week and you hardly would speak
But now you got my phone taking pictures
Laughing, smoking, chilling, yeah

Started out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you and I go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in

We don't need nobody talk
Probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky
When we really take off
And I tell her hold on
Cause she say she never been this high
We don't need no nobody talk
Probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky
When we really take off
And I tell her hold on
Cause she say she never been this high
