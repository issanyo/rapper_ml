[Hook]
Situations will arise
We'll get high
Cause it's all about gettin' the dollar, player
Haitian niggas
Tellin' lies
They don't realize
That you gotta be smart about it, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm floatin', I'm killin' 'em
I'm floatin' off weed, (?) you lovin' is me
The price, you don't deal with them
I travel the world, 360 degrees
These hoes get adrenaline
They come to my crib, see all the TVs on the walls and the rooms that I'm livin' in
Why talk to these women friends?
Cause I'm spendin' benjamins
I hope y'all don't break up
Cause if y'all don't make up then I'll be the nigga to get revenge
No I ain't basic
She diggin' my style
Lovin' the way that I'm livin' so wild
Lovin' the way that I'm puttin' it down
Lovin' the way that I'm makin' her smile
Ain't had no really good dick and it's makin' her wild
And I'm the nigga that's with it
I'll start it and finish it
I'm with a broad that be tryna be innocent
I roll a joint she could probably hit it
Y'all will go broke in a matter of minutes
Ain't about the love, it's about the digits
See all this money in front of me
Young nigga gotta get it

[Hook]
Situations will arise
We'll get high
Cause it's all about gettin' the dollar, player
Haitian niggas

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
And I ain't came at a bitch neck yet, nigga
You just nervous, worried, depressed, stressed
I'm laid, stretched out, leg room, first class Taylor Gang jet
Niggas talkin' shit, I'd rather count up
Gossipin' another's shit is so childish
Keep that from 'round us
No squares in the Pentagon
By silent alarm, you have alerted the don
Now war already on
You crawlin' on the floor tryna get to your phone, nigga
It's desert storm, we outside your home, nigga
In the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
2009 a lot of y'all styles was born, ugh

[Hook]
Situations will arise
We'll get high
Cause it's all about gettin' the dollar, player
Haitian niggas
