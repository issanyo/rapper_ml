(*Laughter*)
I gotta lotta cash

(*Laughter*)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'ma smoke this joint then I'ma break you off
I be lying if I said you ain't the one
All these tattoos in my skin, they turn you on
Lotta smoking, drinking, that's the shit I'm on
Heard you not the type that you take home to Mom
Is we fucking when we leave the club or nah?
I ain't spending cash for nothing I wanna see you take it off
I'ma pop this bottle, you gon' give me brain or nah?
Heard you from the hood, you rep that thing or nah?
Gotta lotta ass, you gon' shake that thing or nah?
Heard you smoke blunts, you down with paper planes or nah?
I feel like I'm Tony, you my boss? I'm thinking nah

Show me is you really 'bout your money girl or nah?
Don't play with a boss, girl, take it off

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Is you really 'bout your money or nah?
