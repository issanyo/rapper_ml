[Intro]
Is it recording?
Somebody grab me a lighter
Desert swag
You think anything you want
More

They say they want
You gonna live your life
Maybe, (maybe)
They wish they could be living for you
Say that thing, (say that thing)
I’m happy that you made it
But really, they wish it was them

Damn, damn [x5]

Don’t come down
Keep your head above the water
And when they doubt
Keep showing them that you’re stronger
I smoke too much
I think I got a drinking problem
But if you were me, had all of this on your plate
Fuck would you do

I’ma be the same, I probably never change
Niggas think i’m new but I got years up in this game
Been doin' my thing, I’ve been here carving my own lane
I Been had all them cars, been had them diamonds in my chain
You say you want a rock star, super star
A big shot, well take a little time, a little patience, live a life
Plus I give all I got
