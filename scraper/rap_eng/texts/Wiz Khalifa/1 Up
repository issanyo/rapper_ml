[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm 1 up, pussy nigga run up
Play me for a ho and Ima pull up with a gun up
Bitch, you see the chain, got me looking like the sun up
All that old fly shit will get a nigga done up
Believe that, I'm 1 up (x8)

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, H-Town, Money Gang, nigga ain't shit slow
Got the hood trippin, trunk sound like a kick, tho
Hustle Gang everythang, tell them niggas get dough
Young Tom posted at the skill tryna get blow
Nigga, fuck the club, I hit a lot and let a bitch know
Four hoes ain't enough, tell em get six mo'
Strap it up, let a bitch ride it like a '64
When I'm done, send em to they whip and tell em get go
Then I'm back, mobbin through the city like a black ghost
First jacker thinkin I'm dinner, I keep black toast
Young Truth, never sick of cheese, no lactose
Jump out on a hater front step, hit em that close

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 2: Lil Boss]
Yeah, I'm 1 up, on the block from sun down to sun up
Mobbin through the city, I would never put my gun up
Chalupa on tuck mode, yelling out fuck hoes
Got a bitch naked in the club like "fuck clothes"
These niggas fucked around and woke the beast up
Back to the pony tails, khaki's and creased up
HGC til the whole word freeze up
Hand out the window while I'm throwin my C's up
Yeah, blaze my motherfuckin weed up
Fuck the police til them hoes lift these up
I'm on one, 7.62's penetrate
Piss me off at the wrong time, I'll demonstrate

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I wake up, bake up, gotta get my cake up
Pussy feel good, look great without no make-up
Real nigga here, not a faker
I hate y'all, a boss nigga certified player
Niggas want beef, give it to em like a waiter
Shorty want the wood, so you know I had to stake her
Treat her like her maker, get a room treat it like Jamaica
Just one time, treat it like a favour
The VIP's on me, you down to smoke, I got a couple zips on me
Got diamonds on but I be doin shit low-key
Don't gotta make a call, my niggas with the shits
Cause real niggas don't slip, bitch

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yo, I'm 1 up, out here, still tryna come up
First you feel a burnin sensation, then you numb up
Act like you tryna hang and get hung up
Soon as you bang-bang, charges get brung up
Bring a nigga right to the register, get him rung up
Use to go see my connect and pick a ton up
Quickest way to get some respect, pick a gun up
And just start shooting whoever you in front of
Top 5 dead or alive, I'm just one of
One shot deal, one life, you get one love
All that old fly shit will get a nigga done up
Scoreboard clearly shows that I'm one up
