[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
See I've been going on and on forever
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gon' stop, never!
Most of this been good but I've seen some bad weather
And niggas who want shit now wouldn't even give me an umbrella
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along
When I was 16, finna get put out my home
Now the man making money, my nigga, my money grown
And I can do what I what, went from being hated on
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on
Ain't no love lost but wasn't no love shown
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song
Party every weekend, hardly ever home
Don't get a chance to see me face to face
So you have to talk about me when I gone

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)
Niggas who can't support their own
So keep hating me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star
Of the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up
And all my jewelery ice aged, the piece frozed up
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us
Get you to buy a drink then it's over cuz
We back around the time that she sober'd up
Shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up
The best moments of my life
Never peeled this much plastic off of Polo in my life
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice
It's the way we know
Wake up in the morn' like "where did all my paper go"
Grow some more weed and get medicated
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)
Niggas who can't support their own
So keep hating me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star
Of the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas losing their roles
Can't play their position
One day they're down for the team
Next day they're missing
Same ones was all in the front
Suppose to be there for support
And half the time it's the ones you care for
Fuck you here for? Huh?

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, the money come, the money go
And when it come down to it
That's something niggas with real money should know
We partied a lot and drank, now they don't talk to me
I started off not so great, now I'm on top of things

[Verse 5: Chevy Woods]
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame
I see the bigger picture on the wall in a frame
Spent a couple of days OT making it rain
That was cool but I was thinking ocean views
Polo trunks shades on and boat shoes
Cantox lick the oil, my nigga and I ain't slipping
You won't stall me out, uh, bad transmission
So if for the better, yeah, nigga different
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twisting
Mattress money put up cause now my money different
Got a lot to say but ain't never try and listen
Record all night in the studio in the morn'
Playing back what we did, now tell me if that's wrong
Crack the Rozay, and pop a top or two
And toast to what this hard work got us to
