[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]

Uhhhh

And they say all, I rap about, is bitches and champagne
You would to if every night you see the same thing
Money wall to wall
Young famous nigga
Spend it all when you die you can't take it witcha
Bottle of Rosay if I'm drankin' witcha
Cause most niggas broke, they bank is injured
And bitches gon' ride with who they thinks a winner
And I be smilin' incase they take a picture

Uh, I smokin' weed drinkin' liquor
Make a hundred off a show and spend it all on my niggas
When I go shoppin' I tell 'em pick one
Cause they was with me when nobody seen the vision
Always about my business
Don't play the cards, I talk to them niggas who deal them
Uh, Royal Flush
Now look up them niggas and baby girl you'll see us, yeah

[Hook x2]

I'm gonna spend it all
Why wait for another day
I'mma take all this money I own
And blow it all away
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone gone gone gone gone
No, I can't take it when I'm gone gone gone gone gone gone

No I can't take it when I'm gone

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]

Uh, pile a hoes in my car
They wanna feel it at maximum speed, never have an absence of weed
Tired of bein' at the bar
Everything Louis V, plus the most exclusive tree in my jar
Makin' my bank, spendin' it all
And that expensive shit you pay for, she had it on, she takin' it off
Most of these niggas just talk, ain't cakin' at all
Back in the day money was short, I'm makin' it taller
You know what I mean, some say it's a problem
Blowin' my greens, not savin' my collards
No NBA, they say I'mma baller
Live for the day, stunt like my father

[Hook x2]

I'm gonna spend it all
Why wait for another day
I'mma take all this money I own
And blow it all away
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone gone gone gone gone
No, I can't take it when I'm gone gone gone gone gone gone

No, I can't take it when I'm gone
