[Intro: Hoodybaby]
Yeah, ayyy yahhh
Don't even
(gangsta grillz you bastards)

[]
Girl I know I did you dirty like the last time
And the last time, I said it was the last time
I've been drinking, thinking, missing you all last night
I fucked up now you got my levels that high

[Hook]
You got me broken (woo)
You got me broken (woo)
You got me broken (woo)
My hearts all broken ... in pieces
You got me broken (woo)
Girl I'm all broken ... in pieces
You got me broken (woo)
My hearts all broken .. in pieces

[Verse 1:Hoodybaby]
All I want to know is do you still think about me?
I don't wanna hear what ya friends think about me
I don't wanna hear what ya momma think about me
She ain't gotta think about me
That, shit could hit the fan
Pam, ya blocked me on the gram
Girl, you gotta understand I'm a grown ass man
And a man gon' be a man
Damn, I know I cut you open
Now I'm all at home yawning
Yea I'm all at home roaming, back to back smokin
Girl you left me broken

[Hook]
You got me broken (woo)
You got me broken (woo)
You got me broken (woo)
My hearts all broken ... in pieces
You got me broken (woo)
Girl I'm all broken ... in pieces
You got me broken (woo)
My hearts all broken .. in pieces

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
(what up Hood.. uhhh)
Ooh no emotions, don't do my thing on the low
I get them hoes all in the open
Rollin' that weed up, jump out the ocean
Some like to brag and some like to boast
But me I just got to get to this money, Ain't no seeds in this potent
I done been around the world, seen a lot of girls
I don't rock designer, they design it for us
All about respect, that's what we grindin' for
Count that money up, tomorrow count some more
Baby why you catchin' feelings, them girls ain't on your level
You ain't gotta deal wit 'em
Brought 'em to my home, now we got to chill with 'em
Text me in the morning, I be like I'm still wit 'em
And now she talkin' 'bout

[Hook: Hoodybaby & Wiz Khalifa]
You got me broken (woo)
You got me broken (woo)
You got me broken (woo)
My hearts all broken ... in pieces
You got me broken (woo)
Girl I'm all broken ... in pieces
You got me broken (woo)
My hearts all broken .. in pieces
