[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fast livin, Good weed, Bad women
Rollin up joints wit hash in ‘em
True pot head, do everything last minue
Not concerned wit the cash im spendin
Because the cash I get it
Groupies fall through an crash wit us
Watch movies, laugh
Go in they bag and smoke they last wit us
Bongs, bowls, vapors, gas masks and stuff
Niggas know we the shit, cameras flash on us
Roll the grass up, bottles on chill, fill ya glass up
Niggas losin they bitches soon as they glance
Cause they know the difference between the small time business
And the enterprise my nigga
Ain't been gone, its just been a while my nigga
Battery strong, i’m energized my nigga
I’m tryin to ball, you playin a game
Haters sayin I changed, I say look at my chain Mane

[Hook]

Why they hate me boy
I’m just goin hard cause its out there for us
Now im all in they faces, cause im on the road
Now they gotta talk about me when im gone
Now they gotta talk about me when im gone
Now they gotta talk about me when im gone

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
(jets til the next) the life I'm
Product of triple og advice
Listen and apply
You niggas just sitting round us trynna shake ya high
Talkin' too much round the bitches
Lookin type bozo an everybody in the room know
Rabie flow dog trill Cujo
Michael knight got your bitches on the bus playin' excite bike
Roll something you ain't here just to be a bad bitch
Spitta the originator high rappin' aircraft shit Goose died
Trynna fly a jet word to Maverick, doobie passes like Magic
Lit the forum, 80s status, lace my forums up
High top adidas strap classic, can't tell me nathan
Bout my 79 lando chromido daytons, vacations
Carry on louie while u carry on hatin
Yeaaaa, til the next life all right
