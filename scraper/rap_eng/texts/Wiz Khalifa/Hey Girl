Hey girl whats your name
Im very very glad you came
Your such a beautiful thing (so beautiful)
Hey girl whats your sign
Im very very glad you took the time
Your such a beautiful thing (your so beautiful and you know it)
Hey girl wanna let you know
Whats going through my head while im staring out this window
But everytime i try to find the words to explain, i fail
Hey girl heard your story before
Your parents don't get it and your boyfriend is an A-Hole
And going to work in the morning drives you insane, I know
So you like to kick it with the bad boys
Pose like your flicking for the Tabloids
Froze on me cuz if you fast foward
I'll just be an other cool kid that you passed on
And no matter how hard i fell
Played the best way i can with the cards I'm delt
For the day i can say its nice to meet you
Wait till next time I see you, ima say
Hey girl whats your name
Im very very glad you came

Hey girl whats your sign

Hey girl are we compatible
I like tarantino flicks and a long talks, im a vergo
Theres so much that i think and don't get to say (about you, its all about you baby)
Hey girl its been a month or so
And I've been on the road singing songs flyin solo
When i go to sleep
Your the girl in my dreams
So i got your picture on my mac book screen
Savor somethin about this age your just like me
Shorty got flavor like my favorite ice cream
And ima scoop her one day and make her life change
Till then im like dang
And no matter how hard i fell
Play the best way i can with the cards I'm delt
For the day i can say its nice to meet you
Wait till next time I see you, ima say
