Come on man!
Out in the street they call it murder

[Verse 1]
Yo!
This where the blocks are known
Rocks get rolled
Up and down the cops patrol
So they play the back block
Plus the names are not to know
Not to mention niggas out here snitching so they got to go
Heavy with the rock and snow but I don't play the block with blow
Usually in the lab with a pad blowing tropical
Working on changing the game and making lots of dough
Put my hustle down
Throw my muscle round
You act food the wolves will come and hunt you down
Prick, we them bird guys where they let them birds fly
Pop, now everything you seeing's from a birds-eye
You niggas aren't hot I see that you're creeping
I'm an alarm clock to niggas that's sleeping
Call me an all-star
You cuffing broads I'm with your freak on the weekend
This your wife, I'm just getting my skeet in
He's too Swayze
But you should recognize
I ain't standing next to guys
Any nigga think he on my level will be left to die
Got a mean team but you ain't even seen the best of mine
Get the boy stretched like he ready for an exercise
Pistolvania's what I rep, yes, throw your sets up high
Yeah the beat cold, but the flow got em mesmerized
Test the guy, champion flow, I'm moving left to right
Hardest out, nigga the whole city will testify
Chyeah!

Out in the street they call it murder
