[Hook: King Los]
Baby girl, call me dope dealer
Ride a dick like a four wheeler
Lames, oh no, she don't feel 'em
Never ever ever fuck a broke nigga
You gon' feel it in your head soon
Brought the kitchen weight to the bedroom
Just to whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, that's the dope dealer
Baby girl, call me dope dealer
Baby girl, call me dope dealer
You gon' feel it in your head soon
Brought the kitchen weight to the bedroom
Just to whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, that's the dope dealer
Baby girl call me

[Verse 1: King Los]
Doctor Zaddy
She said it feel like she popped a Xanny
No need to panic, I got the addy
Pop up on you in real life and drop them the panties (burr)
All you gotta do is hit the number
Let the thing leak and now she say she need a plumber
Get you in the bedroom and hit you with the stunner
Got you walking like your booty got big for the summer
She say the dope dick give her trap eyes
You probably need a needle on your backside (true)
You probably need a extra shot to act right (yeah)
You probably got too high last night (night)
I hit her with the (ooh) like that's right
Come get a taste of the fast life (come)
Your last hit'll never be the last time (go)
Anytime you need to hit the trap line

[Bridge: King Los]
Hit me on the trap line
Mama going through them bad vives
Fuck boy on the trap side
Mama, come and get the sack right
Give a fuck about last night
Live for the moment
Haters gon' yap about somethin'
They just probably mad 'cause the trap house jumpin'
She just hit me up and I give her real game
Even though she knew my real name

[Hook: King Los]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hit it, pass it to my bro quick
I be on the kush but always fuck her good, tell her do it slow motion
Flying private, they ain't coach, get this nigga and make her do the most important
All them shots, I'm finna do a toast
I'm in another state, I'm on another coast
They ain't in the gang and they ain't coming close
All of my bitches fuck bitches
All of my niggas get riches
Girl, we don't fuck with no police
So, why you taking them pictures
Pouring out shots of that liqour
Get a bad bitch, she gon' lick her
Come to my crib, I'm gon' sneak her
Give her that dick, she cum quicker
Niggas keep talking that jealous shit, but I'm on a private airplane
Give her dick from the back, fuck her good while I pulling her hair
I get that money, smoke weed and don't care
Count the bad bitches, fool, I got a pair
We pull and walk and they stop and they stare
When I hit the block, drop the top like a player

[Hook: King Los ]
Baby girl, call me dope dealer
Ride a dick like a four wheeler
Lames, oh no, she don't feel 'em
Never ever ever fuck a broke nigga
You gon' feel it in your head soon
Brought the kitchen weight to the bedroom
Just to whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, that's the dope dealer
Baby girl, call me dope dealer

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]

So, let me introduce you to him
