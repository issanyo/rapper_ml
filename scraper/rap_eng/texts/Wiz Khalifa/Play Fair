Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair

[Verse 1]
Walk up in this bitch, do what I came here to do
You get out of line, we point that thing up at you
Heard you niggas talking but your time bout to come
Go fuck with them other niggas, I'm not the one
Bout to call my niggas up and do something strange
Gotta teach these young niggas the rules to the game
Gotta get my paper up and move like a boss
Time is money, want some of it too, it'll cost
Niggas player hating but I'm still getting dough
Open with your dirt, I'm doing mine on the low
Pocket full of money, keep some loud in the Raw
Other niggas with me, hold it down if it's war

[Hook]
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair

[Verse 2]
If you'se a fuck nigga then they gotta go down
We load 'em up and cock 'em, we ain't fucking around
I done made 40 million and I'm still in the game
Got my niggas out the hood but we still the same
If a nigga want a problem we gon' load 'em up
Got an ounce of marijuana, we gon' roll it up
I don't talk it cause I live this shit, it's real with me
All the niggas that I started with is still with me
Smoking weed then we drinking all the alcohol
If a nigga talk I'm sending someone after y'all
Cause I'm used to getting money in a major way
Plus I'm fucking all the hoes, that's why the haters hate

[Hook]
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
Play fair nigga, we don't play fair
