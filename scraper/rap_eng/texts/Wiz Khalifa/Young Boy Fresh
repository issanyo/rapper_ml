[Hook]  (4x)
The young boy
Young, the young boy fresh
Yeaahhh
You know what it is, bruh

[Verse]
They say the young boy fresh
And I'm out here gettin dollars
You loving my swag
So I'm popping my collar
Just look off in my closet
The hoes all wanna holla
Cause my frames Vera Wang
And my hoodies Artful Dodger
And my jeans are too
The first and last time you gon see em's today
Boy you should be taking pointers
'Stead you look at me to hate
See me and they be like "hey"
I ain't never seen them jays
Forever screaming fuck the law
Riding round chiefing haze

[Hook]
