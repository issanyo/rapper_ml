[Verse 1: Lyrica Anderson]
Set the mood just right, candles all ready (yeah)
Been needin’ this all night
Feels like I'm in heaven
I'm not in the mood for talkin’
I'm not in the mood for playin’
I’m just in the mood for loving on you, on you
Give it to me, I can take it
Don’t know why I'm so impatient
Alright, I want

[Hook] (x2)
You freakin’ on me, me freakin’ on you
Tell me what it’s gonna beeee
Cause I know you want it
I know you want it (x2)

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
Turn the lights down low
Let's take it nice and slow
My mission is to make sure you don't wanna go nowhere
I'mma make you shed a couple tears I swear
But they gon' be tears of joy my girl
Get ready for tears of joy my girl, tonight
You're probably already in the bed right now, right now
You probably got the camera in set right now, right now
And baby I don't wanna keep you waitin' much longer
So you already know that I'm on my way over

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Hey, girl I been thinkin’ bout you all day
So just tell me what it’s gon’ be
You gon’ let me cut, we gon’ see
I’mma come over, give you this D
You ain’t even into stressin’ out
Cause you f-in’ round with a G
Let me slow it down, like H Town, man, don’t play around
I’ma roll me up a J, make you bust like a K
Smokin’ a L and dip from yo friends
Cause we ain’t tellin’ them
Bend it ova and let you have it
I’m goin’ in fo’ sure
And I blow it by the O (haha)

[Hook] (x2)
