[Intro: John Cena]
Uh, Wiz, I'mma help you re-educate the masses right now
(You know where I'm from)
(You know where I'm from)
(You know where I'm from)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, Growin' up in that slum
Tatted all on my chest just to let y'all know where I'm from
Uh, Haters, I don't see none
Goin' hard day, day Lord knows I want the best for my son
So I got Chuck Tays on my feet, and I got bitches smokin' my chief
And I got all my dogs with me, anyone starvin', man they gon' eat
And we don't do deceit
We do real big receipts
We do first class cabin seats
If you ain't gonna stand for nothin', have a seat

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Cause I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I don't know much about y'all but I've been hustlin' all day
I don't know much about y'all but I've been countin' all day

Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y

[Interlude: John Cena]
Looks like you lettin' 'em know what going all day is all about
Well, it's Mr. All Day


[Verse 2: John Cena]
Y'all 'bout to find God, make you an instant preacher
They should have never let Cena spit with Wiz Khalifa
We all day fam, hotter than a sauna
I'm not from Chi city but I'm common on the corner
We always hustle hard, you ballin' incidental
I'm 'bout to go on trial, murderin' instrumentals
I dumb it down for you, I keep it simple, son
I need four fingers, I'm givin' you the middle one

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Cause I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I don't know much about y'all but I've been hustlin' all day
I don't know much about y'all but I've been countin' all day

Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y
Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I tried to tell these boys I ain't lyin'
Put it in their faces so they can get their cake like mine
But man they keep hatin' and I can't see the reason why
Why when I get a plate they keep tryna take it
Put 'em in their places

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Cause I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I don't know much about y'all but I've been hustlin' all day
I don't know much about y'all but I've been countin' all day

Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y
Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y
