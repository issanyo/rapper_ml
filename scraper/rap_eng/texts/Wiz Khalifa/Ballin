[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I dreamed of kush blunts, hot fashion and females
She never smoked once but love the way the weed smells
Pistols in the front, choppers on the back porch
Lord knows I wanna teach him but he asked for
So im doin words, let my money do the talking
I think the game needs some change like you do for parking
We the planes, you motherfuckers ground control
We escape, skip the rates, pick a cloud and go
My chick by racial, bisexual, buy everything I want soon as I let her know
I snap my fingers and God will be there to hunt your head
Call me the deep and you try and sink like the London Bridge
Big city small problems, hate me cause I get a plate often
What are they starving? Where I'm at? tourin
Say you got another question, call it
Ask me if I'm ballin
Wow
