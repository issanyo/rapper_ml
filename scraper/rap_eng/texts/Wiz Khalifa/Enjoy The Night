We gon' get fucked up
Enjoy the night, enjoy the night
We gon' get fucked up
And that's alright, that's alright
Raised in the gutter, I'm a find a way
Everything is ok
Baby lift your cup up
Enjoy the night, enjoy the night

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Amsterdam to Tokyo longitude only I can know
Latitude is my attitude fall in place like a domino
I ain't come here to make no friends
Because I rather be feared than love
Scared to death that I move this mountain get to you with this shotgun slug
And I could never turn my back on the ways of life
I'm sparing no expense top down Vegas lights
My flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck
It's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up
Is filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met
And they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest
Line out two shots and I'm down six dark or light, but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit
Let's see how fucked up we all gon' get

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Raised in the gutter bread getting butter
Face like her mother ass like she's southern
So much cash I just gotta laugh
Out in Paris smoking grass signing autographs
It's apparent if it's foreign and I'm starring
If it's shining then I'm near it
It's designer then I wear it, uh
Look at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance
You too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance
You know me bitch I get straight down to the point
Pop another bottle roll another joint
And all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG
I'm way too high to be low key
Better act like you know me

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Girl if you wanna get some drunk dick you can come and get it from me
I know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this hennessey
But we gon' get fucked up then pour it up drink big
Party like it's 99 put a one-nine before that bitch
We gon' sip until we get sick, we gon' blaze till we get licked
Call Earl the world spinning tell the lil' bitch ye we winning
The girl that you love is good in the beginning
Two good shots and now the girl sinnin'
Spinning over now I'm sober face breasts
More Mer'
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit let's see how fucked up we all gon' get
