[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fell asleep in my first class seat
Got so much leg room, don't care if you lean back in front of me
Plus my hotel room's a presidential suite
Rolling presidential
No election
Bought the Floor I for the set, look like it's residential
Can't just call you, gotta schedule in or let me know ahead
My time is money if you talking and I hope it's 'bout some bread
Ain't nothing like them other niggas, nah, they don't even compare
Got reefer flowing through my body, money growing out my hair

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I wouldn't say I do too much but hey
I do just enough to get by
And I done been a lot of places in my day
But I never been this high
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I probably took some time off cause I was bored of the game
I probably missed your call cause I was boarding the plane
Or some other shit
Now roll some weed, put some hash in
Light that tree up and pass it
All these clothes in my closet
Like I need all this fashion
And this car that I'm driving
Made for speed, not for crashing
If you smoking, I got it
Being broke's not the object, you feel me?

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I wouldn't say I do too much but hey
I do just enough to get by
And I done been a lot of places in my day
But I never been this high
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking weed and rolling weed
Should leave with them and roll with me
I'm in the sky, I'm in the clouds
I take my time, I break it down

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I wouldn't say I do too much but hey
I do just enough to get by
And I done been a lot of places in my day
But I never been this high
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go
