[Hook]
What you wanna be huh? A wife or a girlfriend?
Ready for a lifetime or fucking on the weekends?
What we gonna be? Classy? Trashy?
The bedroom or the backseat?

[Verse 1: The-Dream]
Girls know they love all that nasty shit
Girls know they love it when they shit get licked
We fuck, we pray, she classy
But she don't fuck with a Benz if it's classy
Uh, she don't even care
She said them good girls need a bad boy, so I made that my career
And she ain't got no fears
She makes it crystal clear
Baby, I'm the one that needs saving
My girl lit and she stay on it
She in the  mirror going crazy
She in the mirror going crazy

What you wanna be huh? A wife or a girlfriend?

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa (The-Dream)]
Fucking with me cause of what she see not cause what get
Send shorty on her way if I don't benefit
(if I don't benefit) (The-Dream)
The game done changed, got my change up, winning
Still the same lil nigga...
That get you high as a peak and fuck you to sleep
She know I ain't nothing like them other niggas
I'm that young nigga that can make you cum quicker
Smoking Mary Jane, put you on some hard liquor
Long dick her, you scream so loud, they think something's wrong with you
I don't want no problems, I just want some pussy
You just sucked me off, why you tryna kiss me?
Get so fuckin' high, only God can judge me
The way I dick 'em down, all my bitches love me

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa (The-Dream)]
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me

[Verse 3: The-Dream]
Adam in that Benz when I roll by Eve in the motherfuckin' shotgun
You'll always be a virgin in my eyes, and I just wanna hold something, wholesome
As you feed me another lie, feed me another lie
I would have ate it anyway, don't apologize
I'm hellbent on you, our virtues run loose
Our love still holds true, we can't hit undo

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa (The-Dream)]
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa (The-Dream)]
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)

(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
(We are who we are, who we are, who we are)
Only God can judge me
