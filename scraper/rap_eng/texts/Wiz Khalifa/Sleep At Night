[Verse 1: Tuki Carter]
Who time, my time, my time
My life is your timeline, look
All my hoes is way fine, I'm so dope you smell mine
Like them hipsters and them coke lines
I buy zips of Danny Glover call me Mr. You Can't Blow Mine
So high new name Skyline
I love my time so don't waste mine
We gon' smoke and we gon' fuck
Quickie, Quickie please no hickies
I got a bitch this shit is risky, look
To keep it player you's a hater, look
Pillow talking with a bitch we sharing?
Doesn't add up calculator
Doesn't add up calculator, look
Pimping, pimping good with women
Silly Simpson sipping women

Say my name it equal riches
Who's your man this niggas tripping
Baller fishing, rats rats [?] this niggas dipping
Pap his ass and take his woman
Got some more and kept it pimping
Roll a J and smoke a J, count some bread and went to bed

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Sleep at night, help me sleep at night
All this counting money help me sleep at night
Sleep at night, sleep at night
All this counting money help me sleep at night
Baby mama say that I ain't living right
But all this counting money help me sleep at night
Sleep at night, help me sleep at night
All this counting money help me sleep at night

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Driving in a foreign and I got a warrant
Smoking on that dope I ain't got no hope
A bitch hit the dope now she gotta choke
Riding in that Porsche like it's a roller coaster
I done rode a train, I done flown to Spain
I done a rolled a plane, smoked some Mary Jane
I dont changed the game, I done changed the game
Now they know my name, now they know my name
Came and stole my style they ain't got they own
Came and stole my style cuz it had they mind gone
Smoking on that strong, smoking on that strong
On my iPhone, your bitch trynna bone

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
All this counting money help me sleep at night
All this counting money help me sleep at night
All this counting money help me sleep at night
All this counting money help me sleep at night
Baby mama say that I ain't living right
But all this counting money help me sleep at night
All this counting money help me sleep at night
All this counting money help me sleep at night
