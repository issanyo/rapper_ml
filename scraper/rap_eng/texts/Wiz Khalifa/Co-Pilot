[Intro: Prodigy]

They See me coming, They say here comes Big Time;
Yeah, nigga, big money, big rhymes;
Big ole thing in my pants for big body dimes;
Between hate and love is a very thin line; (uhhh)
They see me coming, they say here go big dog;
Yeah, nigga, big money, big song;
Big ole thing in my shorts for big body broads;
Between hate and love is where the guns pop off;

[1st verse: Prodigy]

Now,I don’t buy shit;
All of my chips go where I live;
Hook it up nice, James Bond, Stylin';
Hi Tech shit; expensive; shower heads; TV’s in the mirror, watching “Housewives” with;
My bad chick, pool size jaccuzz’;
Bubble bath that, oh, we feeling in the mood;
For some slow wet sex, pussy real splashy;
She told me go long and threw it back at me;
Babe, what do you say, you and I stay in love forever;
Life is but a dream; don’t wake me;
Sprees at Vinnie’s;
Them lil t-shirts look perf’ on your titties;
My baby;
Live crazy and die of old age, we;
Stress free everything’s all love lately;
Ever since we hooked up, life is wavy;
We anchor the yacht wherever the sun blazing

[Hook]
Superstar life, shooting star life;
We crime;
And crime don’t pay;
Yo, Whatcha know ‘bout it;
In other words; these names brands things is free, come fly with me;
You’ll be my Co-Pilot ( x 2)

[Bridge]
Let’s get High (God Damn, that ass is 1st class)So High (Aye, Yo Wiz…) So High (God Damn, that ass is 1st class)So High (I know you see that right over there…) Let’s get High (God Damn, that ass is 1st class)So High (look, right over there…Yeah, Yeah, Nigga, them bitches got money, we got money..) So High, Let’s get High (do the math, swing that…)

[Verse #2: Wiz Khalifa]
Rolling up before the first ones even over;
We run the game, Taylor Gang, we never sober;
The kush I’m smoking on’s from the grower;
The smells reminiscent of a motor;
Cut from the same cloth cause G’s all the same;
Me and prodigy seeing all this change;
My weed got to be from the stronger strain;
I’m cool with the pilot, I bring it on the plane;
Say I’m ruthless, bitch, that’s why my coupe is;
I got all this new shit off of doing music;
Fuck the money, rap for family the most;
Been rich so long, can’t remember being broke;
Get high so much, don’t know it’s like being low;
I take a nigga’s crib and spend it on a coat;
That means I’m balling like ball game;
30 thousand on this Balmain

[Hook x2]

[Verse #3: Prodigy]
Who’d ever guessed that;
V.S.O. P be so gifted;
He ushered in a new year with this big shit;
It sounds like Miami nights on the club strip;
Sitting in the fly V getting lifted;
On the low, ladies spot me and ‘proach me;
No cat calls, no shorty, shorty!!!;
No excuse me miss;
They see me and just step to they biz;
Its more like;
What Up Kid, I see you shining;
I can smell a nigga with money, What up Big Time? its;
Nothing but this muthafucking good life girl;
You looking good, me and you can have a good night girl;
Bring your chics to the Ritz;
We got all of the bottles and the spliffs;
And come and get some room service;
From the god of sex;
Are you my goddess?;
You’ll find out soon enough; maybe no, maybe yes, its

[Hook x2]
