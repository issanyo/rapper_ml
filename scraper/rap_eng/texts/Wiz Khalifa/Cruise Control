[Hook: Mac Miller]
Ayo I'm livin' the high life
Fly clothes, good liquor, good weed
Fine hoes all the things I'mma need
We make these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic
And we gonna have 'em like
La La La La, La La La La La
Sit back relax and move slow
Cause we on cruise control

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Wizzle man, the fans: can't keep them off me
Always reppin' for my city even though I don't see it often
Yeah, as a youngin' learn it's best to keep from talkin'
I only say I'm the best cause that's what the people call me
And I'mma keep shinin' til the day the Reaper call me
A lot of shit on my chest so I suggest you keep from round me
Tryna slander my name but when you sit think about it
It's hard to show off your aim when niggas yet to see the target
He's talkin' that mess cause he's garbage
My trees rolled, beauty of the week is foreign
And my homie bought a yacht so we on it and drinks are pourin'
Hoes admire my clothes cause I got Louis features on 'em
Life just like a movie plus the special features bonus
With bad bitches and good weed to keep us coughin'
Hard as a bed of nails you a beast for sleeping on 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I got these motherfuckers hatin' on the way the boy live
Angry at the way they ladies always say that I'm the shit
People stay up on my dick, I ain't worried bout them
I'm to focused on the money, I ain't worried bout friends
They say the youngin' dream like a king
I'm Muhammad Ali in the ring, Christmas Eve in the spring
Way above the bar, but I ain't 21
Wizzle cuttin' up cause I stay puffin' blunts
And when the money come, I'mma give it back
Got a driver who addresses me as Mr. Mac
Dealing with these diva hoes, they so demanding
Mac a young superstar, Dakota Fanning
And you know I'm planning for the world to be mine
No blind dates, but I'm hittin' girls from behind
The type of shine stay turnin' 'em blind
Just cruisin', smokin' purp, and recline

[Hook]
