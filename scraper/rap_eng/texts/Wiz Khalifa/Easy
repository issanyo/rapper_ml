[Intro: Caye]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yuh
Oww, oww!

[Chorus: Caye]
Girl you make it look easy
All these other bitches they just can't please me
Ooo, and I love it when you tease me
Every time you give me that feelin'
I can never tell if I'm dreamin'

[Verse 1: Caye]
I, I been waiting on you
Patiently chasing you from the west side
Just to see you for a minute, I got red eyes while I'm hopping on the red eye
Pull them panties to the left side
I'ma treat you good don't you tell me that your legs tired
Give a damn 'bout a red tide
Baby its okay I'm more man than the next guy

{Bridge 1: Caye}
Oh I know you got options
You can do whatever you want
Confidence ain't a problem
I can see it in the way that you walk
In the clubs back in Boston
I love it when you make that ass drop
Baby come through to my spot

[Chorus: Caye]
Girl you make it look easy
All these other bitches they just can't please me
Ooo, and I love it when you tease me
Every time you give me that feelin'
I can never tell if I'm dreamin'

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Baby girl, I'm the best guy
Put you on the KK, that's the best high
You a quiet freak girl that's the best type
I'ma fuck you good then I put you on the best life
Then I jump in my next ride
Smoking on that kush, wanna roll baby let's vibe
Then I jet on the next flight
Gotta get my paper, it's gang or the death sign

[Bridge 2: Caye and Wiz Khalifa]
Oh I know you got options
You can smoke whenever you want
Confidence ain't a problem
We be on them papers no blunts
With my gang we from Pittsburgh
You know that everything we do's fly
So baby won't you come and get high

[Chorus: Caye]
Girl you make it look easy
All these other bitches they just can't please me
Ooo, and I love it when you tease me
Every time you give me that feelin'
I can never tell if I'm dreamin'

[Outro: Caye]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And you do it so easy
You do it so easy
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, and you do it so easy
Oh, and you do it so easy
