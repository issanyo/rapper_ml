[Intro:Wiz Khalifa]
Usually, Ahh I do a weed song
So Uhh, Here go a weed song

[Prehook: Linval Thompson]
Marijuana, I love it my brother
Marijuana, in my soul
Marijuana, in my heart
OOOOHH
I like to smoke marijuana, It gives me a deep meditation
I love to draw marijuana
It give me a deep meditation
It keep the natty dreadlocks jumping
It keep the natty dreadlocks rocking
It keep the natty dreadlocks swinging
The white man love to smoke marijuana
The black man love to cultivate it

I love to smoke marijuana
It give me a deep meditation
Marijuana

[Verse 2]
Smoke, I choke, I blow them O's
In my chest and out my nose
OG Kush exotic brands
(I love it to my heart and soul)
I done smoke all kinds of strands
African, Afghanistan
From the pharmacy, hand in hand
Gettin high with my enginieer
I stay smokin bud with my cameraman
Ounce a day, what I put on

I love it with my heart and soul
So I can't stop smoking it

I love to draw Marijuana
It keep the natty dreadlocks jumping
It keep the natty dreadlocks rocking
It give me a deep meditation
Marijuana Oh Oh I love it

[Verse 3]
Break it down and roll it great
My marijuana motivate
And no, it ain't gettin old
(I love it to my heart and soul)
Okay
I brought the weed
Who got the swisher?
Three broads with me to drink all this liquor
We go hard

I love it to my heart and soul
So I couldn't stop smoking it
I love it to my heart and soul
The white man love to smoke marijauana
The black man love to cultivate it
It give me a deep meditation
It keep the natty dreadlocks jumping
It keep the natty dreadlocks rocking
I love to smoke Marijuana, marijuana
