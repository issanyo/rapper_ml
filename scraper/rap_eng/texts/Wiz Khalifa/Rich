[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
It's young Khalifa
You know what it is
Let's go

[Verse 1: Gladius James]
You're the realest of them all, I say without a doubt
Always been my lucky charm, girl, when my luck runs out
Golden diamonds don't mean anything when you're my world
Yeah, you mean the whole world to me, no, you worth more

[Pre-Chorus: Gladius James]
I could be out in the street, yeah, yeah, yeah
Long as you jumping the law, yeah, yeah, yeah
What would I do without you?
Girl, all I know, know
Gimme the sugar I need, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know you look up to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
What would I do without you?
Girl, all I know

[Chorus: Gladius James & (Wiz Khalifa)]
When I'm with you, I'm rich
Don't need no money, I'm rich
All I need is your loving, your kiss
'Cause when I'm with you, I'm rich
Oh (man)
Ooh (let's go)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa & (Gladius James)]
Don't really need much
Rolling that green up
Uh, usually don't do this (no)
For you, I'd get cleaned up (oh no)
Breaking my habits
Thinking 'bout marriage, uh huh
Horse and a carriage
Like it? You have it
Girl, if it's mine, I'ma share
I know that things been kinda strange
Lately I been doing my own thing
You been out there, running round too
I ain't got a problem, I can trust you (trust you)
Fight and we fuck
That's what lovers do
No runner up
Girl, I run with you (oh)
Swear that you the one, not the two
I feel good

[Chorus: Gladius James & (Wiz Khalifa)]
When I'm with you, I'm rich (yeah)
Don't need no money, I'm rich (woah)
All I need is your loving, your kiss
'Cause when I'm with you, I'm rich (uh)
Oh

[Bridge: Gladius James & (Wiz Khalifa)]
Know how to grant my wish
Why you so generous?
I could get used to this
I could get used to this (uh-huh)
Know how to grant my wish
Why you so generous?
I could get used to this
I could get used to this (hahahaha)

[Chorus: Gladius James & (Wiz Khalifa)]
When I'm with you, I'm rich (yeah)
Don't need no money, don't need no money, I'm rich
All I need is your loving, your kiss, kiss
'Cause when I'm with you, I'm rich (when I'm with you)
Oh
(Uh, it feel good)
When I'm with you, ooh
(You, me, we)
