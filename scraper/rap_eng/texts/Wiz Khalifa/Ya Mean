[Verse]
You see my pants sag low
I'm smokin' on the dro
You can tell by the swag
That the young'n gettin' dough
Not a rookie in the game
I'm a certified pro
Gettin' Bugs Bunny money
I'm with Warner Brothers, ho
If they haven't heard about him
Then you ought to let 'em know
Nigga straight up out the hood
But gettin' dough for every show
I'm the Prince, do my thing on you, bro
Gettin' Bugs Bunny money
I'm with Warner Brothers, ho
If they haven't heard about him
Then you ought to let 'em know
Gettin' Bugs Bunny money
I'm with Warner Brothers, ho
If they haven't heard about him
Then you ought to let 'em know
Nigga straight up out the hood
But gettin' dough for every show
I'm the Prince, do my thing on you bitches
Tell 'em "Lets talk money", T-Pain on you bitches
I be ridin' real high, switchin' lanes on you bitches
50 box of cigarillos, got a thang for them Swishers
Still the same lil nigga, never change for them figures
I see me a bad bitch, I get a name and the digits
And my aim is to split it
I like a little bus down
She ain't with the bullshit
And like it when I come 'round
Yeah, you see me, you'll see a cloud of smoke
Blowin' on Jamaican
Bought the pound straight up out the boat
My city show me love
There be them clown niggas talkin' though
I make the money pile
Make her smile
When I spark a O
Weed smellin' tropical
To me you're not a obstacle
I run through everyone one of y'all
I see you tryna stop him though
Haters on scope
A nigga wanna act up
Breeze got the front
And Big Lonnie got backup
I roll a sack up
Gotta stay high
I'm a fresh young nigga, so I gotta stay fly
And I'm married to the game, so my cake is to the sky
Yeah I'm gettin' all this money, it don't make you wonder why
I'm the truth, no lie for you fuckers
Got a bitch like Snoop, from The Wire for you fuckers
And you tired motherfuckers
Can keep sleepin'
'Cause y'all dreamin'
I'm out livin', smokin', chillin'
Ask your bitch 'bout the kid, I'm so appealin'
I get that money up from floor to ceilin'
Motherfucker
Get up
Yeah
(Warner Brothers records)
I'm that nigga
It's Grow Season, bitch
