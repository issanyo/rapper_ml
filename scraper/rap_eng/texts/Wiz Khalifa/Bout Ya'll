[Intro]
Hahahahahah
Yeah
Drop the top, nigga
Fuck it, roll the windows down

[Hook]
All these women
All these cars
Countin my cash
Life with the stars
Why is life this good?
Go head, go grind, go get it
Pick the manic out with it
I really don't know 'bout y'all
You know I'm fucking high
You should get with it
Life in the fast lane
Push it to the limit
Why is life this good?
Go head, go grind, go get it
Pick the manic out with it
I really don't know 'bout y'all

[Verse 1]
They say that I don't know
About being broke, no
In cities you ain't been
In places you won't go
You movin in slowmo
I'm living the fast life
Addicted since I fell for gettin this cash, like
You don't need to ask twice
You heard of the young guy
Started off small time
Now I'm alumni
Because I'm young fly (young fly)
Dumb high (dumb high)
And a flow like mine ain't easy to come by
I'm over to Cali, watching the sunrise
A meeting in New York, I'll be there by lunchtime
Then fly to Miami for the end of the night, done
If I ain't a star well then I'm livin just like one
I'm feeling just like, um, my life may be too good
So I keep it too real, god made me too hood
You thinking I fell bro? (fell bro)
Hell no (hell no)
I stick to my grind like velcro
I'm gettin'

[Hook]
All these women
All these cars
Countin my cash
Life with the stars
Why is life this good?
Go head, go grind, go get it
Pick the manic out with it
I really don't know 'bout y'all
You know I'm fucking high
You should get with it
Life in the fast lane
Push it to the limit
Why is life this good?
Go head, go grind, go get it
Pick the manic out with it
I really don't know 'bout y'all

[Bridge 1]
I really want to live in the fast lane
I grind and I did it all my way
Now that it's over
I really don't know 'bout y'all

[Verse 2]
No, I don't know what you into
Made it to the top after all I done been through
I'm sharp as a Ginsu
You won't find shit that the kid got on
At any mall that you been to
Call him official
Or maybe exclusive
It ain't nothing major
It's just how I do shit
Ain't nothing but new shit
New Era, new fit
In a new town tryna fuck with a new bitch
I'm in something roofless
You know I ain't easy
But that's how I got it
I make you believe me
It's nothing like TV
It's more like a movie
Niggas might've heard that I came up, it's true, we
Gettin'

[Hook]
All these women
All these cars
Countin my cash
Life with the stars
Why is life this good?
Go head, go grind, go get it
Pick the manic out with it

Life in the fast lane
Push it to the limit
Why is life this good?
Go head, go grind, go get it
Pick the manic out with it

[Verse 3]
But I'm G-double-O-D
High off life
Yeah, I think I'mma OD
Me and my codies
Be keeping 'em rolling
Thought we brought enough with us
We gon' need mo' trees
Some niggas be low-key
But fuck it I'm flashy
My bros are expensive
My bitches are classy
I live for the moment
But then let it pass me
(Ah, never that)
This what I say when they ask me
(Man they walk up to me, I be like)

[Bridge 1]
I really want to live in the fast lane
I grind and I did it all my way
Now that it's over
I really don't know 'bout y'all

[Bridge 2]
I won't sit here and keep watching these things
Happen in front of my eyes
Go head, go grind, go get it
Pick the manic out with it
I really don't know 'bout y'all

[Hook]
All these women
All these cars
Countin my cash
Life with the stars
Why is life this good?
