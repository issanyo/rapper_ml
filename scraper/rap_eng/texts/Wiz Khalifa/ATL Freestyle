On a four month march, tryna get my money straight (money straight)
I'm bout cake - to keep the world turnin
Hundred thousand dolla earnin while im big blunt burnin
But to these hoes im a pimp like iceberg
Prolly hurt ya feelins if I told ya what the ice worth
A couple grand, i'll hitcha with a nice verse
Kush when I land mix it in when I light purp
And I like purp - I fucks with kush more
Niggas talkin reckless I expect thats what the hoods for
What up hazelwood? nigga ooh woop
I'm a rapper's fear, I'm in your ear like a blue tooth
And my money old (old) but my shoes new
All them carats got ur girl open like a moon roof
Nigga who you? nigga who we?
We the taylor gang - they be like ooh weee
They be like who he? thats young khalifa man
Flyer than the ceilin fan ooh he gotta group of fans
I keep them groupie hoes yeah I gotta group of dough
All up in my pocket I dont needa wallet
Rubberband poppin ya'll niggasz ain't gettin stacks
Might as well sit back n relax
N watch what we doin dont watch me
Watch flava love or somethin on tv
Cuz this is tv nigga HD u can't afford me
