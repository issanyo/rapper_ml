[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Loosing weight
Top down, riding through my state
Getting money, it ain’t no mistake
Say they real
Gang, gang
Gang, gang
Y’all know I’m high as fuck right now
But I’m cool

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Good things come to those who wait
Not the ones who hate
My top down, riding through my state
I’m getting money
Again, it ain’t no mistake
Say they real, know that they fake
Can’t even hide, see it all in they face
Man, I be high every part of my day
You smoking straight garbage
I’m on that KK until I ain’t conscious
You can smell it on a plane
Only 20 yet I’m a legend in the game
Foot on the pedal, not on the brake
You bitch ass niggas should be ashamed
I ain’t just start snappin, I been this way
No way, no dinner dates
I ain't taking ‘em shopping or spending change
They gon fuck another nigga anyway
The most they got get is some sweats
Ain't holding back on nothing
Come to this shit, I’m the best
Mami relax and hit this dre
Hold this shit in your chest
Its big biz burning something and counting up
You lucky that you a witness
Wiz Khalifa, man

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa and Raven Felix]
I don’t stop
Do it all day, every day
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
(I’m working)
Spend my time, know that I gotta get paid
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
Been going too long to ever change
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
You can drive if you want
You ain’t stopping today
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done

[Verse 2: Raven Felix]
First things first, this is gang shit
Highly motivated
I be cooking, yeah I bake shit
Told you when I get up in the game
That I'ma change shit
Take it state to state but right back on my 818 shit
Whippin through the city
When I pull up with my main bitch
Through the pacific
So you can see how big my wave is
They been waiting too long for Valifornication
Traffic start to move slow
You gotta make a lane switch
Young Rave shit
Now they love to hate
I’m getting the job done everyday
They just made they getting fired with no severance pay
Crazy world
Make me want to meditate and self medicate
Roll another jay till my head is straight
I hit the bay, I’m creating a ruckus
I get a bag, I invest it and upgrade it to luggage
No, I never been basic (nah)
But I’m basically hustling
This the gang and we run it
They been patient for me, I’m coming
Wassup with it

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa and Raven Felix]
I don’t stop
Do it all day, every day
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
(I’m working)
Spend my time, know that I gotta get paid
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
Been going too long to ever change
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
You can drive if you want
You ain’t stopping today
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Backward, then I drive out (?)
What I want, I buy
Hoes rep my side note, its the gang or die
Niggas hate but I don’t pay ‘em no mind
I’m too busy counting up, getting dumb high

[Verse 4: Raven Felix]
I get up in the game
Hitting when it’s crunch time (crunch time)
My plate’s full, got me feeling like it’s lunch time
Looking what they do with they bitches
I don’t cuff mine
Hating on the gang just cuz we young and fly

[Verse 5: Wiz Khalifa]
Nominated but we don’t need awards to say we made it
Turn me on, I’m the fan favorite
If you a G, then I’m on your playlist
Them other niggas make believe that ain’t how the gang lives

[Verse 6: Raven Felix]
This shit is dangerous
Fucking with me, what you expect
It’s automatic
When they come to Cali
I’m the connect, no doubt about it
Ain’t no talking unless they cutting the check
I went and put that work in
Now I’ve come to collect
I’m up next, gang shit

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa and Raven Felix]
I don’t stop
Do it all day, every day
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
(I’m working)
Spend my time, know that I gotta get paid
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
Been going too long to ever change
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
You can drive if you want
You ain’t stopping today
I'ma get the job done, I'ma get the job done
