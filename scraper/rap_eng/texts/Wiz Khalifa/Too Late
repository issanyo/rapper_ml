[Hook x2]
Niggas don't want no problems
Easily will just solve em
So stop your mouth I'm talking
And start your feet and walking

[Verse 1]
I sit down in this motherfucker
Burn a pound in this motherfucker
Shake the ground off this motherfucker
With concrete beats, Mobbing these streets
My whole team getting me all in this deep, so lets get it popping
First kid to act silly, first kid he dropping
Its too late there's no way that you could really stop him
And blood bath I put the nail in the coffin, I'm availing with bosses
Niggas down with Uzi's
[?]
I ain't tripping, I'm whipping
Getting a lift from a pigeon
See with us there's a difference, you'd be simping I'm pimping
You just play a position, I'm just the bricks in the kitchen
And my [?] I'm the sickest just living
Fuck it life of deceased, I'm a beast fresh off the leash
Its too late to run if you scared
So take a glass and put a blunt in the air

[Bridge]
You see I'm tired of playing with y'all
In case if you didn't know by now
Can't stoop we all act a fool
There's no use to try to calm us down
It's too late

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm the motherfucking champion, I can't do it
Then it can't be done, your times up should have [?]
And now back the meanest broad, chickens know that I'm picky
Pockets full of dope, eyes a little low from the sticky
Had a toe I'd be ticky, fitted 10's I'm tims
Even jeans with some dickeys, cuz my cheques make my slicky
And mommy's all over the kid, didn't walk me before but now that everybody know who he is
You wonder how bitch
Ye I'm rap's fourth some Child
Been waiting for my chance to the tip top
So hats off to this prince of hip hop
I speak flame so tell lames to kick rocks
They do the same they keep the same their wig pops
Biotch

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Now the rooms all full and we all packed In
Somebody might get their jaw cracked in
Cuz for your jaw jacking
I'm trying to find a little something to slide with
Jumping or ride with
But niggas keep hating cuz they chick keep smirking
If this cat keep looking I'ma hurt me a person
But I'm chill see I only let the team work em
Stomp a nigga out til the feet start hurting
You ain't nothing but a vexed up clown
With a style that'll get shut down
It's too late to try catch up now
I'm on my A game, Morgan in the fast lane
Cruising up the past lane, fucked up since the cash game
So for you jokers I'm a bad thang
Fake eyes ye I'm like a snake eyes in the crack game
