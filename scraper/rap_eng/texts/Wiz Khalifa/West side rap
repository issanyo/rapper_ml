Iam in my zone iam feeling stop blowing my buzz quit killing it bitch dont kill my vibe this is the west side love show all them big booty calls because i tell him to shake that laffy taffy that laffy taffy
[Verse 1]
Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
GetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-by's at bedtime
Get down, I earn mine, so one loss they can't sign
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Hook]
So now we 'bout to break the bank, money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like la-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank, money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like la-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do, niggas talkin' 'bout
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do, now we 'bout to break the bank

[Verse 2]
My time to show out, finally the illest crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
