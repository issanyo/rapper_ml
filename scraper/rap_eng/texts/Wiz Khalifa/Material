[Hook:]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with Miss Success
And I can't stand her up no they don't understand us 'cuz
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh

[Verse 1:]
Wait, they dying to get the diamonds off my plate
The more I give the more they tryin' to take
Like I be serving you this evening got the nerve
To wonder how I eat 'cuz while you sleep-in I'mma wake
Aw man what is ya'll saying, money long ya'lls end like an on ramp
Young boss man I be with a lot of goons
That know how to aim but dat chopper stay on auto-tune
I paint a perfect picture for it
So you going need your high definition cord
They say I made it cause there ain't a thing I can't afford
And car service get me to my plane before it begins to board
Aye they think they hell I'm on a highway
Cause I treat everyday like it's a Friday
My situation straight you looking sideways
On my grizzly cause my grind pays

[Hook:]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with miss success
And I can't stand her up no they don't understand us cuz
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh

[Verse 2:]
Three cell phones no home number
The shit that I be on will take you out your zone comfort
Quiet when I'm home but mention me when I'm gone
Schedule getting full I had to sync it with my iPhone
And I can't get out of plane mode
Cause every time I turn around
I wake up in a different time zone (different time zone)
Not concerned with all the fame
But want the world to know my name when I'm gone
So just give me the light
Quiet on the set show me where the cameras at (where the cameras at)
I'm telling you I'm ready (telling you I'm ready)
No I'm telling you I'm ready (I'm telling you I'm ready)

[Hook:]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with miss success
And I can't stand her up no they don't understand us cuz
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh

[Outro]
Yea-hea... it's your boy Mr. Ez-Wider
Principal Ez-Wider to you young man
Here to break down a couple of rules to Flight School
Ya'll niggas ready to fly? Well lets go
Rule #1: You don't smoke unless you choke, you dug?
Lot of ya'll niggas be calling people bitches just for choking on the weed
That means theres some good good in that blunt ya'll, what you smoking on?
Rule #2: Bring enough for your crew
Lot of ya'll niggas just be bringing them little small ass sacks to a whole session talking about I ain't got enough
Get the fuck out of here with that
Thats how you get expelled ya'll
Rule #3: Ain't shit free
Don't ever come to Ez-Wider talking about oh I ain't got no weed but I got some blunts dawg
Thats a quick way to get bounced straight off the plane okay..
Rule #4: Smoke 'till you can't no more
I know sometimes that kush get real good
And you like in a UFC match and you wanna tap out
But hold on player! Hold on! You can do it
And the golden Rule #5 is always stay high
I don't care what kind of green you smoke pimpin'
Sticks and seeds, as long as it's weed you're good with me
And that's Mr. Ez-Wider's five rules to Flight School
Hope you wrote 'em down ya'll
'cuz you'll need them at the end of the year if you plan on graduating
Now we going to get back to some of that Wiz Khalifa
Right here on W.E.E.D. Campus Radio
