[Intro: Problem]
Ow, ow, ow

[Verse 1: Problem]
Only surround me with hoes (Ow)
I done hit all of my goals (Ow)
Pedal touch all of the floors (Ow)
Ho shit is always exposed (Ow)
Ho shit is always exposed (Ow)
Crabby come out of them clothes (Haa)
Come like them hoes at my shows (Skrr)
Stackin' my hunnids, we saggin' the colors
We whippin' it like it's a Ghost (Skrr, yeah)
All of us powered up anything goes
Remember them days when you 'n your squad was on top? What happened to those? (Oh)
Yeah pour us up like a four (Woah)
Won't let that happen to me, sheesh
Won't let that happen to us
Girl if I gave you a puff, suckin' and fuckin's a must, hoo
Baby, your body the truth (Ha)
Yeah it is
I just put drugs in my cup
Who wanna share this?

[Chorus: Problem]
I done hit all of my goals (Swerve)
I done hit all of your hoes (Ow)
I don't be stuntin' these hoes (Ow)
Hoes be stuntin' for me (Ow)
But Lord I know nothing's for free (Free)
No, I know nothing's for free (Free)
So baby I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
I done brung all of this weed

[Verse 2: Iamsu! & Problem]
These bitches fallin' for me
We takin' flights overseas
All on the team, I go Super Saiyan 3
No I ain't pullin' no strings
Baby, your features is fresh
You ready to hit the lotto
Suck me off 'til I am sleep
Then maybe some chicken and tacos
I promise you will be so better today

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Problem]
My nigga I roll up don't play
Fuck a different bitch every day
Call a stupid bitch a car I don't tell her to stay
My nigga I be on my way
Gettin' money, I am in unless I'm gettin' paid
Fuck your bitch and don't got nuttin else to say
Leave her leakin' ain't got no time to play (Ha)
Out in California peakin' rollin' up with all my dogs and livin' life just like a weekend
I got three Instagram hoes freakin' we just takin shrooms, and smokin' weed, ain't speakin'

[Chorus: Problem]
I done hit all of my goals (Swerve)
I done hit all of your hoes (Ow)
I don't be stuntin' these hoes (Ow)
Hoes be stuntin' for me (Ow)
But Lord I know nothing's for free (Free)
No, I know nothing's for free (Free)
So baby I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
Baby, I throw you some thangs
I done brung all of this weed

[Outro: Problem]
Roll up, roll up
I got five on it
All my niggas still flippin' keys
I got five on it
Break it down, bring half back for me
I got five on it
Haa
