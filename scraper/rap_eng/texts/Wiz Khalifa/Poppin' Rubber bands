[Wiz Khalifa - Verse]

Chu know time is money, So we young nigga! Clock it!
I'm ballin' in the game while them others just watching!
What you making in a week, I got stuffed off in my pocket!
When money ain't a thang, Gettin' money's not an option. - No!
I need a rubber band that can fit this money in a wallet!
My bank account is making ya'll sick to ya stomach!
Getting rich & I love it!
My piff got a budget!
& Ya Bitch probably thinking about the prints, She ain't frontin' homie! - Woww!
Ye'en seen nothing, I blowing on a 'O' or Two
Thirty Five Large & that's just for doing a show or two
Talk it how I live it, Now I'm gettin' it like I'm supposed do
Shining like I know the dude
Grindin', I can show you dude's!
Hit the Mall dog, Spending money by the grand!
Blow a couple stacks & Pop another rubber band!
It ain't hard to understand, how he spend it like that!
Niggas know me, I'm the man & We gettin' it right back, So we!
