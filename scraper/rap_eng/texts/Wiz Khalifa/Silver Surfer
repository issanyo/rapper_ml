[Intro: Max B]
Boss sh-
Boss don
This got that ride to it Grease I ain't gon' lie
Boss don back with another overseas wave
Lets do it (oww)

[Chorus: Max B]
Baby the place so wavy
When Silver Surfer come to stage
Keep the thing on the waist
Leave the scene but no chase
Pick you up where we got it
Hit you up, leave you there, leave the party
We boogie like we retarded
It's like ow ow ow

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, she wanna fuck me in my car
Always with a new broad, they say I go too hard
These niggas acting tough homie that's what the crew for
I keep stacking up muscle car backing up
New bitch actin' up she get a pass 'cause she bad as fuck
She wanna know where I'm at and what I'm doing
Where I'm going, if you ain't pulling up it ain't important
In a car you never seen 'cause it's imported
Everything sorted, never boring
They ain't on the shit that we be on
We ain't rolling up to smoke unless the weed is strong
Shorty sucking it like she in porn

[Chorus: Max B]
Baby the place so wavy
When Silver Surfer come to stage
Keep the thing on the waist
Leave the scene but no chase
Pick you up where we got it
Hit you up, leave you there, leave the party
We boogie like we retarded
It's like ow ow ow

[Verse 2: Al Pac]
Yeah, Peezy smoking on a paper plane
Gain Greene, Taylor Gang fucking up the game
Sipping on this Henny straight getting to the paper
When it come to these hoes I got all flavors
Pull up in the Beam' all black 750
Don't run up on me wrong know I keep them killers with me
Still here niggas know that the wave strong
Come out your mouth and this 40 leave your face gone
We the real deal you other niggas imitators
Play around with the team you end up in the paper
Rolling up the loud got your boy in the zone
Niggas hate I got they baby moms in my phone

[Chorus: Max B]
Baby the place so wavy
When Silver Surfer come to stage
Keep the thing on the waist
Leave the scene but no chase
Pick you up where we got it
Hit you up, leave you there, leave the party
We boogie like we retarded
It's like ow ow ow

[Verse 3: Joe Young]
The truth is back, the GT roof is back
Tell the wave gods the groove is back
Proof in facts, niggas ain't new to that
Bring it to your whole crew like that
Stop being greedy niggas wanna see me fail
Trynna ride the wave but won't mention the Bigavel
I'm in the cut little nigga where y'all at?
Blowing on this KK, surfing four days flat
Niggas out here fronting like they started the wave
Not stoping the rave till y'all niggas behave
We ain't having these new slaves, black skinhead
Got a check, then he got a shave

[Chorus: Max B]
Baby the place so wavy
When Silver Surfer come to stage
Keep the thing on the waist
Leave the scene but no chase
Pick you up where we got it
Hit you up, leave you there, leave the party
We boogie like we retarded
It's like ow ow ow
