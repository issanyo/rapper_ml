DRUGS
Dramatic nigga

[Verse 1:]
I said divide it, girl don't hide that pussy
I'm a hit it from the back but don't stop lookin
Cat daddy in it, Peter Griffin in the pussy
Don't stop, get it, get it, getting on this pull it
Ass so fat I might take a vacation
You taste like water I might wanna put my face in
B cup titties well at least she ain't faking

[Pre-Hook:]
I heard a rumor they say skinny girls can take it
First I throw up 100, then I throw up 50
Dark skin, light skin, I ain't never picky
She get to shakin ass, she get to shakin titties
She make that ass clap, clap, clap for a rack

But I bet you can't do that with a dick in it
I bet you can't do that with a dick in it
Yeah I bet you can't do that with a dick in it
I bet you can't do that with my dick in it

[Verse 2:]
Face down, ass up that's the way we fuck
Tint on the window, getting neck in my truck
Face like that, no ass so what
That's what I got, I let a bitch fuck
Feels so good, I might take her to the movies
Say she got them dolla signs tatted on her boobies
I ain't finna do it, on my mama I ain't fake it

[Pre-Hook:]
I heard a rumor they say skinny girls can take it
First I throw up 100, then I throw up 50
Dark skin, light skin I ain't never picky
She get to shakin ass, she get to shakin titties
She make that ass clap, clap, clap for her right

[Hook:]
But I bet you can't do that with a dick in it
I bet you can't do that with a dick in it
Yeah I bet you can't do that with a dick in it

[Bridge:]

Push it, push that pussy for dough

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Quarterback in it, I'm about to go long
Get it while you're workin Shawty fuck your day job
Young nigga but when I'm up in it, I'm the man
Grabbin on my skin sayin shit I can't even understand
See it, want it, buy it, flaunt it, never lease it, always own it
Buy a new one in the morning, I'm a boss so I'm payin for it
Ridin in my ride, spot em to the side
I get plenty drunk, I get plenty high
Young Khalifa her favorite person
Eyes low like an Asian person
Smoking good like a Jamaican person
Tatted up like a crazy person
Every time I take a trip that's a quick million
Say you like to do them tricks, I bet you can't

[Hook:]
I bet you can't do that with a dick in it
I bet you can't do that with a dick in it
Yeah I bet you can't do that with a dick in it
I bet you can't do that with my dick in it
