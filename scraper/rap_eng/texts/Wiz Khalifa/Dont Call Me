Uh huh uh huh
Should I stay should I leave
Dont know which way to go
My mind is sayin yes
My heart keeps sayin no
Youve got not words to explain
You always take it wrong
Call up the station tell em

[Hook]

Play it on the radio
Plat it on the radio
Play it on the radio
Play it on the radio
Play it on the radio

[Verse 1]

I wanna call my girlfriend
But shes all mad
Everything was good then
Nows shes all bad
I hit your phone up
You never call back
Would I be wrong if I took
Everything I brought back
Me and you against the world
Girl I thought that
I be able to see them signs
No contracts
So high off of life
Will make a hater catch a contact
But now I treat her like im
Jumpin out a plane and fall back
Cause I can only dream of what we had
Try to work but seem that we go wrong
Sometimes I pray that god will take me back
Then run and tell the homies ive moved on
But soon as I get my head right
You gon think im stuck and im just
Frontin no headlights
Put you in the club and brought you
Stuff you never wear twice
Now the thrill is gone and the
Decisions in the air like
Damn
