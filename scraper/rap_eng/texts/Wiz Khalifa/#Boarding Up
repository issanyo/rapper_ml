(Verse 1)
I Smoke Weed Hit The Blunt Untill My Lips Burn
Facing This Loud Fuck Thinking About When My Bitch Turn
Im In Rotation By Myself Rolling Up Doobies
HotBoxing In The Parking Lot Before I Go In The Movies
Oh Im Cool On Them Snacks You Got
Smoking Great & We Shouldn't Even Match This Pot
AMC Bath Room About To Smash This Bop
My Hoes Never Get Cuts They Not Used To The Crop
Hair Salon Pimping Hoes Get Used To The Block
Lie You Down For The Money Tell The Truth To The Glock
Thats How It Is In My Hood Get Used To The Shots
Ain't No Body Doing Good Selling Or Smoking Rocks
And Its Not Theatre Arts But Diggie He Got The Props
Putting Gloves On My Hands Like We About To Box
It Ain't No Problem Just Dont Have My Name In Your Damn Mouth
And That Won't Lead Me To Stomping Your Man Out (Diggie)

(Hook)
Yeaaa She A Lover Not A Fighter (Not A Fighter)
Well Im A Smoker Fuck Is My Lighter? (Wheres My Lighter)
Rolling Up A Couple More To Get Higher (Get Higher)
While You Dutching Up Your Reggie Im Boarding My Fire (Diggie)
