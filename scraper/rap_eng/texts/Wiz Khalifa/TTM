[Intro: PnB Rock]
I don't really care about this
You  talk too much about me
You make things up about me
Never would've came up without me
From people we love, yeah

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I don't really care about this
And I don't ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
You make things up about me
You talk too much about me
Never would've came up without me
From people we love

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Why you wanna make things up
Why you wanna waste my time
Girl we used to be in love now
Now I don't really care about you no more
We used to be perfect now it ain't working
All my niggas swerving
Drop top coupes, girl you used to be my boo
Now you telling lies on me
Shawty this sad but true
Yeah yeah drop top coupes
Girl you used to ride with me
Girl you used to slide with me
Now you telling lies on me

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I don't really care about this
And I don't ever waste a minute
You  talk too much about me
You make things up about me
You talk too much about me
Never would've came up me
From people we love

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You talk too much about me
Say I don't show you love
You doubt me
I'ma roll one up, get cloudy
When my pockets wasn't up, you wasn't round me
Why you wanna roll one up
Why you keep calling my line
Girl you used too keep it G but
I don't need to smoke one with you
Drop top coupe, girl you used to be my boo
Now you see my brand new thing
Wishing you was in her shoes

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I don't really care about this
And I don't ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
You make things up about me
You talk too much about me
You make things up about me
Never would've came up without me
From people we love

[Outro: PnB Rock]
I don't really care about this
And I don't ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
You talk too much
You talk too much
Far too much
I know what you like, I know what you like
From me
