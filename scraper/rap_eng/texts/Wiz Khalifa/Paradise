[Verse 1: Berner]
I party like a rockstar, let the Benz fishtail
Arm out the window, I got it off a fish scale
Rollie with the big face now I need a gold one
Mouthpiece crazy, girl I got a cold one
My car all cloudy let the A/C blast
I don't need love baby pay me cash
First of the month when them fiends come I'm hot like a rock sale
Cocktails, red bean and oxtail
Three phones I'm trying to get a key sold
Weed smoke in the air no diesel
We grow, shit you never seen so
Rose Clicquot, the shit you gotta drink slow
All in my cup, bitch, I ain't on no fucked shit
I just want a pretty dime piece that'll suck dick
I just want a big fat crib and a race car
Thirty-five pounds by the window of my AR

[Hook: Berner]
I got a fresh new stash of endless cash
They try and tell me that this shit won't last
I got two new whips and a brand new pad
They try and tell me that this shit won't last
I just gotta slow down they say I move too fast
They try and tell me that this shit won't last
I like lobster, crabs and poppin' tags
They try and tell me that this shit won't last

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Berner, what up, nigga?
Wake up, grab some KK, hit it raw and bake up
Check my Twitter little niggas still follow what I say
Sayin' that they know that it's real so they put the fake up
Eight million Taylors later, niggas gon' hate us
I'm always rocking that JOYRICH
I pull up in a Porshe 911 you still driving that boy shit
Smelling like the shit I just smoked
Jealous cause you living life broke
Mad cause my niggas all paid
Ridin' to some shit I just wrote
High like I was back in seventh grade
When my cousin first passed me that dope
Now I just pull up, valet
That's my man he know I got the hook up
Hopping out, number 6 Jays fly niggas look up
We the gang if you a hater go die with them
If you not come, get high with us

[Hook: Berner]
I got a fresh new stash of endless cash
They try and tell me that this shit won't last
I got two new whips and a brand new pad
They try and tell me that this shit won't last
I just gotta slow down they say I move too fast
They try and tell me that this shit won't last
I like lobster, crabs and poppin' tags
They try and tell me that this shit won't last

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I say ho, think twice
Cause if you roll the joint for me, then it better be right (better be right)
I say ho, think twice
If you roll the joint for me, then it better be right (better be right)
Be right, be right
If you roll the joint for me, then it better be right (better be right)
Be right, be right
If you roll the joint for me, then it better be right (better be right)
