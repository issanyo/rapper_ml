[Intro]
You already know who the fuck it is man, Taylor

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, smoke Kush so I got no stress
Stuntin' it ain't no contest
Diamonds all in my Rolex, cuz' I go hard like P90X
See you dudes copyin' our moves, now you follow in our steps
Lil' kids just in the mirror, all insecure just trying to flex
Speakin' of Flex, shout out to Flex
And everyone else that said dude is next
Tell these lame niggas cut the check
Try the rest, now try the best
Gangsters, trippy niggas all here
With me nigga, my weed, so strong
My Brain, so gone, Ooh
Outer space, solar, ooh
My Chain, polar, ooh
My bank, so long, ooh
Like I was playing poker ooh (poke-her ooh)
My face on the tele, so fuck what they tell me (what they tell me)
I always keep it real cuz' the people love the real me
They ran up on my bus cuz' police said they smell me
So me and L O L A, blow and smoke in LA

Flossin', Straight bossin', Take strains, we cross em'
My chains hang, they cost em', They hatin', we awesome
Throw back on drinkin' lately I've been thinkin'
I've been partyin' too much and livin' like the weekend
And then I think bout what my life could be
That's when I pour another drink and light this weed

[Bridge1: Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona' fry
And it ain't no lie
Ghost sittin' low and my bitch real high
And it ain't no lie...

[Bridge 2: Krayzie Bone]
They claim that they get high but see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let's see, I doubt if they can go higher than me

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I've never been this high before, levitate rise off the floor
Elevate, get high some more, drift with the wind to the sky I soar
Like a bird, like a bird
I feel like I'm floatin' through fantasy island in the brain, up in the plane lost
My vision, is simply not in good condition, did I mention
We go hard, and we don't even leave home at all
So what a nigga doin', we ball, ball, so carry on
The Mary and the Molly clearly got me very cloudy
So I sit back with my mind in the zone, mindin' my own
Need nobody, I can get high on my own
You're on the late flight,my flight is already gone
I'm in the sky you ain't even left home
I black out my mind and I feel free to be, whoever the hell I may wanna be...

[Chorus: Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see (so I can see)
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see...

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona' fry
And it ain't no lie
Ghost sittin' low and my bitch real high
And it ain't no lie...

[Hook: Snoop Dogg + (Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
Still hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
Still hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets
Signed Eminem, he's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E

[Hook: Snoop Dogg + (Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
Still hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
Still hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
