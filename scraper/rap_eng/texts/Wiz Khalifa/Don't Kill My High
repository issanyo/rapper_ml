[Verse 1]
Too high to come down right now, yeah
So please don't call me out when I'm faded, yeah
But you can't judge me right now, oh
Baby, I'm way too fucked up to explain it, oh
Who you think you are comin' in this place tryna mess my buzz up?
Say you want space but it ain't the place to bring that shit up
Too high to come down right now, uh
So don't you call me out when I'm faded

[Chorus]
Don't kill my high, don't kill my high, baby, baby
Don't kill my high, don't kill my high, baby, baby
'Cause I'm on one and I can't feel my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm on one and I just wanna stay up here right now
Don't kill my high, don't kill my high, baby, baby
Don't kill my high, don't kill my high, baby, baby
'Cause I'm on one and I can't feel my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm on one and I just wanna stay up here right now

[Post-Chorus]
High, baby, baby (Woo)
High, baby, baby (Woo)
High, baby, baby (Woo)
I'm on one and I just wanna stay up here right now

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm tired of all the games that you done put me through
You keep callin' me sayin' what I do to you
Girl, you all sound the same, oh, what a shame
Used to have me in your corner, won't never again
No, I can't hear what you sayin' 'cause I'm too faded off that kush
You've been goin' through  some things and that ain't even a good look
So don't blow my high, I'm gettin' faded tonight
I need a light, you see the vibe

[Chorus]
Don't kill my high, don't kill my high, baby, baby
Don't kill my high, don't kill my high, baby, baby
'Cause I'm on one and I can't feel my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm on one and I just wanna stay up here right now

[Post-Chorus]
High, baby, baby (Woo)
High, baby, baby (Woo)
High, baby, baby (Woo)
I'm on one and I just wanna stay up here right now

[Bridge]
Why you want problems, baby, why can't you just let me be?
Why you all turned up every time now when it comes to me?
Why you all bothered by the things you think or what you see?
I'm too high, yeah, you picked a bad time
'Cause I'm up right now, way up in the clouds
You're the only one makin' waves
You saying that I'm so far down, but I keep holding on
You just want me to beg you to stay

[Chorus]
Don't kill my high, don't kill my high, baby, baby
Don't kill my high, don't kill my high, baby, baby
'Cause I'm on one and I can't feel my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm on one and I just wanna stay up here right now

[Post-Chorus]
High, baby, baby (Woo)
High, baby, baby (Woo)
High, baby, baby (Woo)
I'm on one and I just wanna stay up here right now
