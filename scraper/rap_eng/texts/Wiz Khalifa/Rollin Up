[Refrain]
And I'mma keep rollin' up
Puttin' the weed low when the police is rollin' up
Fool all I know is go
Don't let them haters slow me up
Stashing for my unborn
They ballin' when they old enough

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah J.E.T.S., nigga
As if I had to say it, Spitta
In the middle of every bad bitches playlist
ITunes bangin' from my hotel room
Nothing but beats bitch
Fuck it when I die I could sleep, bitch
My momma need a bigger crib so I need this money Jake
King Kong ain't got shit on me
My face is a coupon
I don't know them but they know me
Bitches pitch it, like pitchers
But I'm smart not a wild swinger careful at what I'm hittin'
Burners in the sofa cushion careful where you sittin'
Ain't into nothin' crazy
Keep it for them crazy niggas
G fizz fly, holla at Wiz, catch the Steelers
Smellin' like high-time at the fifty-yard line
Ushers bugging wanna check our tickets

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And um, my niggas the planes back
Gettin' full off of dinner but save scraps
Never know when a rainy day may hap-
-Pen pictures out of my life and bitches, I Taylor gang that
Me and spitta, spend a grand at the bar
Buyin' drinks for my niggas
Hoes sellin' they souls just to be with us
On the road with winners, champions
Ride smokin' weed to myself the only reason they stress
Because I'm on the level you can't be in
And I flick the middle finger to fake friends
We live like when the loyalty is strong you can't bend
We the planes and all of my niggas stamped in
Billionaire clothes out in Vegas fucking millionaire hoes
I'm in the air solo
You nowhere near close
Went and took the road this young'un here chose
Smokin' it by the O
