[Intro]
Yeah
Hold on, turn me up a little bit more
Yeah, bitch
I always wanted to do this shit
This is it, what
Luchini
Nigga, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fresh up off the plane
Real niggas embrace my music
And bitches go insane
Even the kids throwing up the gang
They don't bother pronouncing my name
They just look at my chain
Boy, how much you spent on it?
This ain't nothing but hard work
And what you can get from it
Ain't no toilet paper
But this smell like the shit don't it?
Smoking chronic and drinking gin
'Til we get sick stomached
And them suckers ain't gotta like it
Cause your bitch love it
I'mma roll it, she gonna light it
Tell me she in desperate need of a pilot
I told her kick her feet up
We gonna go to my crib
Soon as I roll this weed up
Call some friends of yours
And we could all have a smoke-out
You ain't gotta hold it too long
This is rapper weed
Couple hits is all you gonna need
In my Versace frames
I'm blazed
Somewhere on the island
Smoking some ray
Middle of the day
Drunk dialing
Be surprised by how high a nigga get
I'm a different kind of fly
We ain't on the same shit
Nigga

[Hook]
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
(Hey Jerm, keep all that, that's great
I'mma just run the next one, that cool?)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
No need to apologize
You should know how fly niggas do
Only EZ-Widers
Been done with them cigarillos, fool
I been on the road
Shopping and killing them interviews
Heard I left a major deal
But my paper major still
And all of them fans in love with me
Cause I say what's real
So I can never give a fuck how a hater feel
But, uh
Every time they send a driver for me and Will
I call it doing my talking on the field
At first niggas was tough
They don't wanna be gangstas now
Traces of my flow
Yeah, they copy and paste my style
Wouldn't think I notice it
While in my hotel
Smoking with your bitch, fool
And this is it, what
Relax your feet, put on some music
Roll a zip up
And we gonna smoke it 'til it's gone
Ever see me cough?
Can't speak for suckers who do
Because I'm G'd up
What
Haha! Ah

[Hook]
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land

[Outro]
Yeah
Taylor Gang, Paper Planes
Shit you burn after you roll
Hoes everywhere we go
They payin' for my shows
Model bitches and hella smoke
