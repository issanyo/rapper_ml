[Verse 1: Berner]
Man, I feel like a zombie
I feel bad for any man that try to rob me
I be sideways in my new whip blowin' lodi
After party got these girls all naughty
Blow got their nose snotty
No talkin' on my cell phone
Cookie jump suit with the all-white shell toe
I smoke good, big bank roll
Another day, another safe full
They don't hustle like this, naw
Last night I was so drunk I almost went raw
V.V.S., long link, not a damn flaw
Bust down cost a hunnid-ten thow', dawg

[Chorus: Berner & Wiz Khalifa]
No sleep, more money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
No sleep, more money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it (ooh)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
No sleep when you grind all week
Yain't about money, then we can't even speak
Been in the game, I ain't reached my peak
Ridin' in my ride wit'cha girl in my seat, oooh
Got me feelin' crazy, wakin' up every time I hear my phone ring
'Nother million dollars so they all on me
Decisions need made, so they call on me, oooh
Now my diamonds the coldest
I just grind and stay focused
I don't care if they know this
Long as I ain't the brokest
They like Cam [?], what you smokin'?
And my J is the dopest
Be with Bern', that's my bro, cuz
We go hard and we don't get

[Chorus: Berner & Wiz Khalifa]
No sleep, more money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
No sleep, more money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
More money in a brown bag
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it (ooh)

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Mo' money, mo' money, mo
Mo' money, mo' money, mo
Mo' money, mo' money, mo
Mo' money, mo' money, mo
Mo' money, mo' money, mo
Mo' money, mo' money, mo
Mo' money, mo' money, mo
Mo' money, mo' money, mo
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
Now we can't even fold it, fold it, fold it
