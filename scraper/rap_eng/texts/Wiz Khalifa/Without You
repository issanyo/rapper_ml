[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
You already know how we do around this time
Khalifa Man
Whole lot of gangsters with me
Know we just rolling up living that Taylor Gang lifestyle
Making sure everybody get entertained
All the fans get some of this love man, you already know what it is, TGOD Volume 1, gang gang

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Most LA girls ain't even from LA
Done this before that's the shit they tell me
Been in this party before, been in this house before
Been to so many clubs she ain't got no first times no more
In the studio with other rappers, singers, ballplayers, even actors
Lotta new clothes to buy
Lotta new places to fly
Taking the favors but really don't care bout none of them guys
She need a new sponsor, she got one
She need a new ass, so she got one
She needed new friends went and bought some
Looking for a sucker know I'm not one, fuck outta here

[Hook: Suzanne Sheer]
It's not what I wanted
And I don't wanna talk about it
Admit that you fronted
Now you forced me to live without it
Boy I'm awake, I can't sleep without you

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Most LA girls ain't even from LA
We love Khalifa man, that's what they tell me
But I heard it all, got the word I ball
Get her number, call, girls its only pussy I ain't scared of y'all
Broke up with your man, now you wanna give me a chance
Y'all done argue when you tell me you back with him again
But I understand, game gon' be the game and I ain't gon' be no lame
Ain't shit really change, I'm switching lanes, me in my newest thing
You been doing good but I'm doing better
Hanging with them lames tryna get your shit together
But I'm the one you dream about, one you scream about
One you think about, one that piss you off when you see me out

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
And you thought you were so grown
Had to let you go
Get it all on your own
Now I'm gone and you're tryna stay strong and find a familiar face on this lonely road

[Hook: Suzanne Sheer]
It's not what I wanted
And I don't wanna talk about it
Admit that you fronted
Now you forced me to live without it
Boy I'm awake, I can't sleep without you

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Can't sleep without you
Can't eat, can't do a thing without you
Got me going through some changes without you
Can't roll this paper plane up without you
Can't sleep without you
Can't eat, can't do a thing without you
Got me going through some changes without you
Don't wanna roll this paper plane up without you
Leave it up to me, I'll bump into you on the road
I'll probably see you if you on TV, cuz once I'm done I gotta go
No cuddle time I hardly sleep, cuz I'm all about my dough
Time is money talk is cheap
Presidential suites with anything you want to eat
They say life is what you make it, it's better when you're with me
Take you down to the beach, have sex then we fall asleep
Before I'm gone kiss your cheek, in the morning I'm in the streets
Without you
