Ugh
Ya’ll already know what it is man
If they wanna know my name, they look up and see the gang
Ugh, its not a problem, we spending change

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
Got the pedal to the medal when I pull up out the garage
Ain't feelin ‘em at all, these niggas a mirage
Handling my biz like a full body massage, hands on
Niggas gon hate, hoes wanna menage
Cops fuck wit me hopin to get a charge
Hoes leaving their man, fucking us cause our cars
If its one thing I know, its smoking and living large
Got me speedin down the interstate
See what I’m eatin, wanna piece up off my dinner plate
Hey she fucking me cause how I win a race
Plus I ain't cheap, I roll the reefer counting bigger cake
Wait I’m talkin fast car, big estate
Money come in cash plus in the bank
Nigga don’t believe me, throw it in your face
Bitch I'm in the building like real estate

[Hook]
They say I’m still the same
You know it ain't a thang
Besides the zip code, ain't a damn thang changed
I’m gettin money, keep the champaigne coming
Might crack a smile but ain't a damn thang funny, no, uh uh
I’m straight, when you gettin money muthafukas gonna hate
Find the baddest bitch and get her number
I dont even call her (call her, call her)
Feel like a million dollars

When they make it
They should put my face up on a million dollar bill
Dollar bill, dollar bill
Cause thats how I feel yup
Cause thats how I feel yup
Cause thats how I feel yup
Cause thats how I feel yup
When they make it
They should put my face up on a million dollar bill
Dollar bill, dollar bill
Cause thats how I feel yup
Cause thats how I feel yup
Cause thats how I feel yup
Cause thats how I feel yup
Hey

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]
Ballin’s not a hobby, its my occupation
Hoes on my dick, thats my confirmation
Couple stars with me, thats a constellation
Jacksons, Grants, Benjis, thats my conversation
Touch the pedal once, it look like I’m racing
Eyes Chinese, smoke like I’m Jamaican
V.I.P rollin’ doobies up and facing
12 bottles of Rose, I’m on some gang shit
Gettin all the shit, cake crumbling
Ain't nothin, told them lil niggas I take from ‘em
Laughing my all the way to the bank
Tried to talk but they can’t
They just stand ther,e when they starin
Hatin, mumblin
What you make a year, I guarantee I spend it clubbin
Started kinda hot, now its safe to say we bubblin
400 on a zip, blow it all day
Another city, state, another mill to make

[Hook]
They say I’m still the same
You know it ain't a thang
Besides the zip code, ain't a damn thang changed
I’m gettin money, keep the champaigne coming
Might crack a smile but ain't a damn thang funny, no, uh uh
I’m straight, when you gettin money muthafukas gonna hate
Find the baddest bitch and get her number
I dont even call her (call her, call her)
