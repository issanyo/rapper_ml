[Intro]
She said, she said, she said
She said, she said, she said

[Verse 1]

She said “why don’t we meet up for breakfast at ??
I said “how bout you meet my huffs and give me head?
She said “I got a man, and that there can’t go down
Like you jumping off a building and waking up right at pow
How in the hell you acting like you don’t do that four times a week?
Hear you playing everything and I know you’s a super freak
Sometimes you run into a friend, did the same thing with the same old that week
She don’t love no more, she say she don’t that more
Cause she say he say she say that but she say your game is weak
F-cked her in the club bathroom and moved her in that crib that week
So you’re slicking obviously, you’re pimpin’ ain’t pimpin’ P
How you go blind and can’t see? You can’t see that bitch a G?

[Hook]

She said she don’t love no more
She said she don’t love no more
She said she don’t love no more
She said she don’t love no more
She tried it once before
She was sliding, then tried no more
The fuck you think she trippin’ for?
She said she don’t love no more
She said she don’t love no more
She said she don’t love no more
She said she don’t love no more
She tried it once before
She was sliding, then tried no more
The fuck you think she trippin’ for?
She said she don’t love no more

[Verse 2]

She said that my game top one
But her top game’s on top of one
Taught me topless while texting
In the back of the tour bus in Texas
She said that she had to go
I move on to the next foe
Women ass model like ass up alike
Jumping, just working, why they working, give them dollar right
He said she said her knees hurt
He said here help, she said flirt
Pull the dollars out that work
She’ll pop ass right out that skirt
Pop ass as high as your shirt
Catch feelings, feelings just hurt
Her feelings are staying on your shirt
You claim you’ll change your inner work
She’ll leave you fast as y’all met
Met a nigga that’s cooler than you
For a nigga that’s cooler than him
For some niggas that’s cooler than them
And that cycle will never change
She gonna keep him bent to her
She ain’t got no heart, my friend
She ain’t got no heart, my friend

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
She want right in this Porsche, that’s what she said
She want this good dick, that’s what she said
She wanna hit this kush, that’s what she said
Roll with me and leave her friends, that’s what she said
She need that ball main, that’s what she said
Was a good girl, I turned her to a weed head
She repping taylor gang, that’s what she said
She love a nigga swag, that’s what she said
She wanna pop a molly, that’s what she said
She wanna taste some gin, that’s what she said
She wanna bring her friend, that’s what she said
Don’t need to fuck with me and that’s what she said

[Hook]
