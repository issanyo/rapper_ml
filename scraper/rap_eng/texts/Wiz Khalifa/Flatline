I'm a make you flatline
Shawty bad then a mutha
Look like a magazine cover
Wanna explore you down under
Scuba dive under your covers
You looking good with them jeans on
Come taste this bottle get your lean on
Sit on this tongue, get ya cream on
I bet this finna be your theme song
Girl, I'm a work your body
You know I puts it down, fuck you in the worse way
We can have a party, like it's your birthday
Sipping on Bacardi, or on that champagne, hey
I can tell just by the look in your eyes
You want me baby, you can get it if you want some
Better be ready cause you're in for a ride
Cause once I'm finish you gon be screaming you on one
I'm all about making you moan
All through the night into the morn
Don't try to act like this your last time
Cause when you let me baby I'm make you flatline
I kill it, I I I kill it, hey I kill it I'm a make you flat line
I'm killin pussy, hey, I'm killin pussy, hey

Listen, what's your favorite position?
Is it 69?
Escalate and watch me get you to the finish line
Take off your heels, loosen your bra
Show me that you could ride it like a yamaha
Sweating out your weave, workin that ass
I guarantee it mami I'm a make it last
You know what it is, is you down to ride
Is you down to open, I'm a come inside
Girl, I'm a work your body
You know I puts it down, fuck you in the worse way
We can have a party, like it's your birthday
Sipping on Bacardi, or on that champagne, hey
I can tell just by the look in your eyes
You want me baby, you can get it if you want some
Better be you ready cause you're in for a ride
Cause once I'm finish you gon be screaming you on one
I'm all about making you moan
All through the night into the morn
Don't try to act like this your last time
Cause when you let me baby I'm a make you flatline
I kill it, I I I kill it, hey I kill it I'm a make you flat line
I'm killin pussy, hey, I'm killin pussy, hey

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Trippy nigga, real trippy nigga
Poppin' bottles in the club, baby I'm a big tipper
Quarter milli for the car, that's the big dipper
Still the same real nigga, set my change lil bigger
My money lil longer so my plane's lil thicker
My ice a lil brighter so my game a lil sicker
Came in like the bad guy cause I'm the bad guy
Me and my chick do the railway cause we that fly
In them private jets on the runway, I'm talkin' that fly
Givenchy straight from the runway, Margella tag fly
So when we walk in the club and they give us bad vibes
Is cause we killed them niggas, flatline

I can tell just by the look in your eyes
You want me baby, you can get it if you want some
Better be ready cause you're in for a ride
Cause once I'm finish you gon be screaming you on one
I'm all about making you moan
All through the night into the morn
Don't try to act like this your last time
Cause when you let me baby I'm make you flatline
I kill it, I I I kill it, hey I kill it I'm a make you flat line
I'm killin pussy, hey, I'm killin pussy, hey
I'm a make you flatline
