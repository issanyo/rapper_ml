[Chorus]
Whoa, you be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard (uh, uh)

[Verse 1]
Know me from the start, I'ma play my part
I got no heart, I be goin' hard
I be blowin' strong, got my money long
Ain't down for the situation, then you can't grow
Got a fat ass, how do you perform?
Say she love my swag, ask what I got on
Fuck you all night, Uber in the morning
Your girl look good, you should tell her join in

[Chorus]
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard

[Verse 2]
Baby, bend it over, let me see you twerk
Say that you can't stay, say you gotta work
So big I see that ass underneath your skirt
Smoke weed, so you pass 'cause you need the purp
I be on alert, grindin' from the dirt
Fucked her so good, say I come in first
You just need another glass, then you gettin' turnt
Bend it over, throw it back, put it in reverse

[Chorus]
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
