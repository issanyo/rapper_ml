[Verse 1]
See I be gettin' to it, gettin' to it
Come to these broads I be stickin' movin'
Don't ever talk it, if I didn't do it
I'm ridin' round, bumpin' on some new shit
Looking for a bad broad to cruise with
Come and kick it with a winner
No, we never losin'
I'm a call some of my dawgs, call them girls you cool with
I ain't nothing like them niggas cause they all illusion
I'mma roll some of this weed put my car in motion
Now we roller coastin'
Tell me I'm the one you need
Well, that ain't hard to believe
Hit this chronic then we leave
By now you probably wonderin what tricks I got up my sleeve
Cause tell me how you want it tho
And I'll slow down the speed
I open up the roof and drop the top you feel the breeze
Yeah I'm young and successful
But I made it out the streets
I'm throwin all my funds
And make it back in a week
You need to roll with me
You the baddest, to say the least

[Hook]
Shorty, whats good?
If you down, we can ride out to the hood
I'm tryna meet her, when you meet me like I should
We got you on, so you meet us   understood, it's understood
It's all good! I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud while we screamin
I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud

[Verse 2]
Major player, major paper
You with a money maker
Tell them lames you gon' call them later
I'm just tryn get you higher then a skyscraper
Take you out get you flyer than a pilot, babe
I ain't running game no this ain't the same
I'm tryn put you in position to do bigger thangs
Everything in your name
Let your homegirls hate
Niggas try, but they ain't gettin in a way
I've been workin all day, now I'm dressed, tryn make a play
Wonderin if she leave here or she gon' stay
I'ma let you push the whip, to the crib, while I twist
Say you stoned so Im gon' take this one to the face
Niggas tryn win the race, I'm just tryn get you laced
Take her right up to my place
Bring the bottles by the case
Roll the chronic, have a taste
I ain't got no time to waste

[Hook 2]
Shorty, whats good?
If you down, we can ride out to the hood
I'm tryna meet her, when you meet me like I should
We got you on, so you meet us   understood, it's understood
It's all good! I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud while we screamin
I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud
