[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Watch me turn this batch into a speedboat
Seen two sun seekers racing to the island
I told my homegirl I need those
So know I'm playing the game with a cheat code
Feed these beats something to eat
Brown sugar Rolls Royce carnish, trust ain't nothing sweet
I got it out the mud, I need a second of toothbrush
Clean my sneaks, deadstock vintage pieces on my feet
Hoes say you soft, pretend you can't talk
Smoke weed, keep the peace but prepare for war
Precious money stacks them suckers probably come for
So, I send my shorty to the gun store
Safe keepin' that bitch off safety
Smoking large at the Oysters bar
Tip the waitress a Franklin and another for my pie zone
I scratched off in my sports car
Pulled into a underground parking garage
Switched whip clickin' the potential tails off
I'm all about that mail dawg work so hard
Don't even notice when it's paying off

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
All they see is the paper
But they don't understand the way that I got it
All they see is the paper
But they don't understand the way that I got it
All they see is the paper
But they don't understand the way that I got it
All they see is the paper
But they don't understand the way that I got it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Six air flights, middle of the night
Get us what we like and what we need
No bed I'ma sleep when I hit my seat
Adidas slides on my feet, pack of raws
Make my cypher complete
I gotta get it, can't miss a beat
Coppin' jewels for the summer just to get the cheeks
I'm in something unique
To get the cheese that's my destiny
White first class ain't no longer question
Drink filled with the best
Hit it once, fill it in your chest
Ain't about the game, then I can't invest
Wouldn't expect nothing less
Get a chick put her to the test
Can she get the pack through with no arrest
Them haters came from the left
But I was high, so I've seen the money and the fam
Nothing come between them, putting all bets on my team
I be gone all summer 16
Start my engines, keep my rides clean
You niggas know what I mean

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
All they see is the paper
But they don't understand the way that I got it
All they see is the paper
But they don't understand the way that I got it
All they see is the paper
But they don't understand the way that I got it
All they see is the paper
But they don't understand the way that I got it
