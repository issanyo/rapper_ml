[Intro]
Gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang
Gang

[Verse 1]
Leave it to me, I'll have you twisting that weed with a G
Got too much talent just to be sittin' around with
Weed and alcohol, that's the balance
Ridin' in the Benz with low mileage
Working 'til my hands get callouses
Been a player, I established it
Whips be the fastest
Chicks be the baddest and my kush above average
Legendary status and my crib like a palace
I know why they mad
'Cause your bitch layin' in my bed
Still got the weed smell in her hair
Comin' home later, nigga gettin' carats
Make a whole pound disappear
Come for the money, tryna get it all
Live this for the gang, Imma get involved
Look at me different now
Roll some weed and put your niggas on
You ain't bout the paper, what you in it for?

[Chorus]
And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in
I got a joint rolled you know that imma spark it
That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters
I hear 'em talkin' like they livin' but they ain't us
Pockets, they swole
I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch
But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch

[Verse 2]
Uh, they ain't goin hard as us
We courtside, chillin', smokin' out the building
Regardless if authorities give us permission
Boss bitches niggas breakin' they credit card limits
To try to ball with us
We in talks with those who own they own business
My spark lit, then I paint pictures
Don't leave witnesses, nah nigga, my gang different
Pull the Benz out in the rain
Hit her once, I won't even remember her name
Hella diamonds up in my chain
To say that I'm dope is an understatement but no, I ain't underrated
Came from a place where niggas make their own way
Got some girls who fuck me but got niggas so they don't say
I'm puttin' KK in the paper
On point, gang ready for danger
Long joints, rollin' them things like broken fingers
Too clean to ever have a stain
Khalifa the boss before you beat the game

[Chorus]
And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in
I got a joint rolled you know that imma spark it
That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters
I hear 'em talkin' like they livin' but they ain't us
Pockets, they swole
I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch
But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch

[Outro]
Pockets is gettin' swole
Used to smoke blunts now it's paper she roll
Diamonds to my toes
Everywhere I go, I'm froze
You already know
Fool
Gangsters too
This is how them gangsters do
