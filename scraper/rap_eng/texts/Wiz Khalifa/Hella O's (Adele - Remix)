[Intro: Adele]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll one up and let's get high
I am trying to get fried
I've brought some weed and you can smoke
You trying to get high, I'm trying to toke
Hit this weed once, don't you choke
I got a grinder, I got a bong
I got some weed, so let's make a song
I got some munchies, we all get along
I smoke weed, ain't nothing wrong
My money good and my money long
My bitch bad nd my kush strong
I be right, I don't be wrong
I smoke weed all day long
Wake up too go to sleep with that
Pack..
