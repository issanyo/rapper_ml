Come home wit a thug let's get shit crackin'
Always wear plastics baby cuz shit happen
She leak da backseat just to freak in da magnum
Hopped out da magnum hopped in da trey
Just to let da top back and thank God for the day

Still in da streets, strapped wit them thangs
She in love wit a G so she tatted my name (ross)

Ima make it rain and ima make it back
You are just a lame lil homie dats a fact
Workin wit the police actin like ya know me
Fresh outta jail already in ya old jeep?
