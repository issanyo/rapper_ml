[Intro]
Started, Started...
Y'all niggas know where I come from
It's Meek Milly
Philly
Ok

[Verse 1:Meek Mill]
Started from the bottom now we here
We were sellin’ things, pullin' strings - puppeteer
Started with a dollar now I’m jumping out the Lear
All my niggas behind me, you can find me in the air
In the car smokin’ loud on my way to Mr. Chow’s
I say: “ain’t it funny now, nigga, this bracelet’s fifty thou”
He say he gon’ hit me, how? I keep shooters all around me
Quicker-picker-up your bitch, that pussy wet and I be Bounty
I got all these haters frontin’ just from lookin’ at my pictures
Plottin’ on my Instagram, they wanna follow me like Twitter
On my way home…
But I’mma hit her, did I mention, 30 grand’ll get you gone
You’ll come up missing ‘cause my cake long
Where your real friends at?
Hold up, fuck that, nigga, where your girlfriend at?
She probably in the VIP where all her girlfriends at
She know that you be hatin’ on me and I still hit that, damn
You gon’ need a green card for the Cuban link (ouch)
Cancel my account, I’ll probably move the bank
When you see them hammers out you’d best not move a blink
FN57, fuck around, shoot through a tank
Bitch, shake that ass, go on, shake them titties
Bitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City
I be bustin’ bottles, ain’t talkin’ ‘bout with Drizzy
Probably be with OVO and I be in Toronto city
With yo fake ass, and yo fake weed
Frontin’ on a real nigga, bitch say cheese
And put your flash on just to catch the AP
Diamonds thunderin’ all in that bitch, I call it KD
Hold up – hold up, wait a minute, y’all thought I was finished?
I popped twenty bottles, that was just a scrimmage
Nigga, you ain’t ballin’, you pop twenty and you finished
Got you fuckin’ up your re-up every time we in the building
‘Cause we started from the bottom now we here
Sippin’ Rosé with Rozay and it’s Belaire
I signed with MMG and did it in a year
I started with a circle and I turned it to a square, ya dig?

[Intro]
Still in the basement, where it started
Uhhh...
Started from the...
Kells

[Verse 2:Machine Gun Kelly]
Started from the bottom, now we here
Courtside, you would think I was a Cleveland Cavalier
I’m talking 30,000 feet up in the air
And dance leer, 30 minutes later all the fans cheer, bitch
You ain’t seen this power since LeBron
I went to vegas for my 22nd, rented out the Palms
Now they say illuminati is the cause
Or maybe everyone of y’all is lazy and I worked hard
I ain’t never bowing down for a dollar
Selling my soul to a charter
I wouldn’t even take a buck from my father
But they weren't saying that back in the day
When I was hustling tickets to my shows, ask dante
And I heard tempers heating up like a filet
Talking 'bout they run my city when they livin in LA
Sucker, I ain’t hearin nothing bout a word
Talked about it, been about it, bitch I got what I deserved
See I don’t know why everybody mad
You had your chance and you blew it
Meanwhile, I’m young and I’m ruthless
Meanwhile, the dumb are influenced
Thinking you live like the music
Don’t be foolish
My shooters make your face maroon like the Hoosiers (Braahh)
Suckers always wanna talk funny
Broke motherfuckers never wanna talk money
And since I was being quiet in the past
I’m on the top looking down, kiss my ass
Still in the game with my same clique
Still with the hood bitches fuck Cambridge
And when they wanna know if I’m real
I say "Bitch I ran my city 'fore I ever had a deal"
Kells

[Bridge: Drake]
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Came in the game with no lane and then changed it
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways
Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I’m smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that it’s fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin'
Hope the homie Drake don’t get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasn’t trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we…

[Hook:Drake & Wiz Khalifa]
Started from the bottom now we're here (Tuh ha ha ha ha)
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here (Ugh!)
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga (Watch it y'all niggas, man, we are doing all this shit)
Started from the bottom now we're here (We'all up now)
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here (Real Shit)
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin'here

[Outro]
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
