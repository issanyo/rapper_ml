[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas crazy
Crazy as Fuck (wiz laugh)
Pull up to that motherfucker with some weed on me
Had them mother fuckers looking at me crazy
You know who it's supposed to be

[Chorus: SahBabii]
Pull up with a stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
I put this on the ten, I'ma end
His life, no beginnin', fuck a friend
Bitch I'm with the mob, you can't get in
We've committed sin, free my niggas in the pen

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Honestly I had a long day
When you're too nice some niggas will come at you the wrong way
I can feel my patience going away
That's why I'm good weed blowing
The only nigga with 2 billion views
To hardly get noticed
Slash dopest nigga when he got his Kush jar open
Probably in the hot tub with my girls soaking watching vh1 tripping or adult swim
Them niggas kinda cool but they can't flow with him
After we done I smoke one then we go again  [laugh]
I'm tall slim and I know how to stack my bread
Instead of running you be throwing it back instead
I run game I don't know how to slack
You get money and don't know how to act
That's young nigga shit
I smoke strong cuz it help me relax
And the crib get controlled by an app
I pull up with the stick
Hit the switch hop out to get a bitch
Tell her I ain't really nothing like the nigga she with
She convinced so she hop up in my 6-4 then we dip
Got papers got grinders so we lit
Ima pull up with a zip

[Chorus: SahBabii]
Pull up with a stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
I put this on the ten, I'ma end
His life, no beginnin', fuck a friend
Bitch I'm with the mob, you can't get in
We've committed sin, free my niggas in the pen
