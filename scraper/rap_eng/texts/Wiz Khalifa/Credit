[Intro: Ricky P]
Good one Richard
There you go Richard
That was it Richard

[Verse 1]
So what do you do? So what do you do?
When all you know is flexin'
So what do you do? So what do you do?
Well, go keep on guessin'
So what you got ice? So what you got change?
It's all a perception
So what you do when all of it's gone?
They come for collection
So what you do when niggas you call just don't got connections?
So what you do?
You thought you was right, life taught you a lesson
So what you do when you got your word?
You make 'em respect it
So what you do?
Whenever you wrong, you try to correct it
So what you do?
When you down and out, you count up your blessings
So what you do?
When you fuck around with feelings, don't catch 'em
So what you do?
If this one ain't right move, on to the next one
So what you do?
If you get the chance, you gon' be the best one

[Chorus]
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
Countin' up all of these checks, smokin' weed is my profession (profession)
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
Countin' up all of these checks, livin' life is a blessin' (blessin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')

[Verse 2]
I'm way too cool for these haters, way too high for my neighbors
I'm way too hard on my job, I do it now and not later
Way too cool for these niggas, I got too many flavors
Way too wide on my mind, not smoke too many papers
Way too out of the country, do anything I want
Way too out of control, pull up anywhere and stunt
I'm way too smooth for the police, now they act like they don't know me
It's way too clean to be stolen, Cartier and not the Rollie
I'm way too real to be fake, too much love to feel hate
You way too tired to work, I get tired of waitin'
I'm way too tall to ever think about doin' it small
I'm way too into myself to even be fuckin' with y'all

[Chorus]
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
Countin' up all of these checks, smokin' weed is my profession (profession)
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
Countin' up all of these checks, livin' life is a blessin' (blessin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')

[Outro: Ricky P]
Ye-ah
It's your driver Mr. Eazy Wider
Picking you up in a brand spanking new Doober
Brought to you by the Doober app
Make sure you hit code 4/20 for 50% percent off
And a pack of Khalifa cones for the ride y'all
You can smoke in this car
As long you rate your Doober driver before you leave
And leave a tip too, bomb weed only
Don't smoke no blunts in my Doober
And see the joints, dabs, or bong rips, for the long trips
