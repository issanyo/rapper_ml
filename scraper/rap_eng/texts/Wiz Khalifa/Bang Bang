[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]

Uh, hahahahaha
Taylor
Bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang

[Verse 1: Tamar Braxton]
Tell me, tell me baby
Can I test my limit with you?
Cause I’m feeling kind of wavy
Wanna see just what my body can do?
Can you turn me up and down?
Can you tear it up?
Gotta know that you can go on ’til I had enough
Don’t mean to underestimate you, I’m just making sure
Cause baby I’m a pro and I don’t need no amateur, eh, eh, eh
If I get loose, what you gon’ do ’bout it?
I’m talking to you, tell me, eh, eh
If you can’t finish, boy don’t get me started
No baby, don’t waste my time

[Hook]
Hey, cause honey I
Gotta know if you’re that kind of man
That can catch it
Cause I throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Bang bang, throw it back like bang bang
I’m warning you cause this ain’t no regular
You ain’t never had one like me, no
It might hurt your pride boy if you ain’t ready
I’ll be going bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like
If my body was a weapon
My sex is gonna take you out

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hahahaha uh
Smoke kush so I got no stress
Stuntin' it ain’t no contest
Diamonds all on my Rolex
Cause I go hard like P90X
Seeing dudes copyin' our moves
Now you followin' our steps
Little kids just in the mirror
All insecure just tryna flex
Speakin' of flex, shout-out to Flex
And everyone else that said dude is next
Tell these lame niggas cut the check
Try the rest now try the best
Gangstas, trippy niggas, all here with me nigga
My weed, so strong, my brain, so gone
Oh, out of space solo
Oh, my chain, Polo oh, my vein, so long, oh
Like flossin', straight flossin'
Take strands and we cross ‘em
My chains eh, they cost ‘em
They hatin', we awesome, oh


[Hook]
Hey, cause honey I
Gotta know if you’re that kind of man
That can catch it
Cause I throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Bang bang, throw it back like bang bang
I’m warning you cause this ain’t no regular
You ain’t never had one like me, no
It might hurt your pride boy if you ain’t ready
I’ll be going bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like
If my body was a weapon
My sex is gonna take you out

[Verse 3: Tamar Braxton]
I know you wasn't ready for it
I'll give you a second chance just to calm down
But don't make me wait too long
Put on another song, we ain't even close to be done
Can you turn me up and down?
Can you tear it up?
Gotta know that you can go on 'til i had enough
Don’t mean to underestimate you, I’m just makin' sure
Cause baby I’m a pro in it, can you handle it

[Hook]
Hey, cause honey I
Gotta know if you’re that kind of man
That can catch it
Cause I throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Bang bang, throw it back like bang bang
I’m warning you cause this ain’t no regular
You ain’t never had one like me, no
It might hurt your pride boy if you ain’t ready
I’ll be going bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like
