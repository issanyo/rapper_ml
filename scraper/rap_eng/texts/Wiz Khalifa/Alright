[Chorus]
Said I'm alright
Everywhere I go, bitch I'm alright yeah
Draping gold bitch it's all nice, ouu
VVS them diamonds bitch they all ice, yeah
I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Pull up in the Maybach
Ceejay with me lookin' hella tipsy
White girl with me and the molly got her dancing hella brittany
14-hundred hoodie all red, looking hella trippy
Bobby Shmurda niggas, Houston bitches with me on that whitney
I come out the coldest city with the hottest bitch
I pull up pop a nigga's niggas if they [?] shit
Them bitches tryna fall in love and tryna fall in rich
She gotta go and brush her teeth before she suck my dick
My [?] want that pay back and I might have to OK that
Pull up on that clown and put him down 'cos my homie don't play that
[?], give them hell on Earth
I come from the dirt
Get your [?] talkin' water guns but all them choppers squirt

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said I'm alright
Everywhere I go, bitch I'm alright yeah
Draping gold bitch it's all nice, ouu
VVS them diamonds bitch they all ice, yeah
I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Black and yellow with the pedal, getting rich but from the ghetto
Took you to another level, been to war and got the medal
Different flows, I got several
Different clothes, hopping out expensive doors
Never let a nigga pose
Love me 'cos my wrist is froze
On a different coast
I got shit that seem to float
Money haunt the [?]
I got chronic you can smoke, see your eyes getting low
I got bad bitches sitting on my line and they [?]
I got the machine that [?] so I ain't finna roll
I put numbers on the board, smelt the cake and went onboard
Private jet, went onboard
Get respect across the board
Get a check, when I go
We pull up bitch we don't dro-

[Chorus]
Said I'm alright
Everywhere I go, bitch I'm alright yeah
Draping gold bitch it's all nice, ouu
VVS them diamonds bitch they all ice, yeah
I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
