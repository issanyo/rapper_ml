[Intro]
You know how we do! Yeah This is what I do young. From my side of the city the dip side
Let's Ride. Yes Sir All my gangsters grab your weapons, punks hit the door. Let's get it
Let's get it yeah uhh

[Verse 1]
I ain't nothin nice
Line em up buckem twice
Lay em' down middle fingers up screamin fuck your life
I roll them 7â€²s out go head and tuck your dice
Crack your skull never seemed sicker in your fuckin life
See I don't hustle white
Scrawny but my knuckles right
Left hand will leave them shook hooks not the stuff you write
And when your hands ashy only time you've touched the white
Snatch your grind now it my grind you couldn't hustle right
See I'm a hungry dude feelin the pain
Ribs touchin got the thrill in my vains
And you niggas is all in the sunshinen but we still in the rain
And for the team leave you spillin your brains
Cause I ain't feelin you lames
Now clowns should be feelin ashamed
So put the heat to your temple and bang
Me and my soldiers in that that black on black we killin the game
You dudes pumped put a chill in your frame
Let's go man!

[Hook x2]
You should print my information, quote my rhymes
Top 5 dead or alive
Yo! Brothers respect mine
The kid that they yapping about they won't stop
You know who rule this shit
The city is mine

[Verse 2]
Ready willing and able, and I've been keeping it stable
Have a leg on the table, since the killing of Abel
Bullets rip through your facial, yeah will give you a face full
I'm into making it painful on demand like your cable
See you dudes is some divas, leave us we move with the heaters
Beef and we shoot through your beaters we turn you dudes to believers
Yeah I'm rocking and ready blown I'm cockin em steady
Popping em [?] I'm heavy dropping the top on the chevy
Let em bang through the smith and your brain will be missing
Changing the game it was written changing the lanes when I'm whipping
It's only natural you hate me cause I'm hot
Cause I get love in the streets and I ain't never played the block
You see I do me and you can't never play me cause you not
The flow is Ludacris, coming for that number one spot
So get outta line and get smacked in
I move with the movers
You lose with the losers they smooth when executing manuevers

[Hook]
