Yeah. Me

Big money, small money
Short money, tall money

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Soon after we locked eyes
I had a vision of me inside
I stimulate your mind and give your body everything that it wants
Private school her whole life
Got an infatuation with being bad
You take her out to shop
To spend it all cause she don't see those tags
I get deep inside her soul though
If she was a guitar I'd treat her like a solo
And put my fingers through your hair
And last night was amazing I can honestly say that you the best I ever had
And you don't remember cause you weren't even there..
But your soul was..

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Keep going..

Just.. just catch up with the next one..

Ay..
Ay Ay..
Ay..

We don't make love I touch your soul girl.. *laugh*

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
She don't party where the rest go
You need to be able to let your hair down so you can feel good..
Here you can buy your own drinks, drive your own car, purchase the Louis bags on your own
Her parents money long but since she grown she'd rather spend yours..
I get deep inside her soul though
Go into the drag and beat it like I'm bolo..
Until you think it's to much..
And even though now you figuring out how or what we shouldn't did..
To your friends you'll admit that we had fun.. okay..

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Ay Ay..
Ay Ay..

[Verse 1: John Record]
Let's ride to the gate so you can meet the man..
Call me Peter Pan I'mma take you to never never land..
When your all dried up here's an ocean to wet the sand..
Of course I'mma see what's good with your physical..

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm relighting in the dark to her lock I got the key
And niggas down to get a copy..
Damn..
How does it feel this great when your not even here..
And you climax with the thought of me
That mean we gotta be..
