[Intro: Berner]
Dope boy fresh, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Berner]
Yeah, I'm dope boy fresh
Bust down on my wrist, a hunnid ten
That’s a real check, baby get real wet
I'm from the Bay, Cartel, yeah, I still flex
New spot I'm countin’ money 'til I feel sick
Yeah, I let the jewelry drip on me
Got blood on my hands from a man that snitched on me
Ask Wiz how we smoke, this shit burn funny
I had two mil' stacked on the day I turned twenty
We leave town and burn money (Burn money)
Big boy, yeah, all the girls love me
I'm on everything movin', girl give me a line
Patrón out the bottle, I won't remember the night
We wake up drunk with paper on our mind
Yo, they still want work, I got plenty online
Big glass jar full of brand new shit
Four grand a pound, bag like this
Bern'

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I got big diamonds, bitch, I'm always big timin’
Count it with the homies, everything in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
You’s a broke boy, stop it
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
Keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket)
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
Keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket)
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hold up, she got turnt soon as I showed up
Left her homeboys and her homegirls
She gon' act like she don’t know ya
Sent the text and she comin' over
On that Bombay we ain't sober
Pour some champagne, get her closer
Go to my crib, bend it over
Know my name soon as I approach her
Keep that bitch in pocket
Shorty on me and I ain't gon’ stop it
Get between the sheets, we gon' keep things poppin'
We could do our thing while your best friend watchin'
No, I ain't got time for it
Why you keep tellin' me I'm on your mind for?
What'chu think I'm on my grind for?
You said you through with me but what you keep on tryin' for?

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I got big diamonds, bitch, I'm always big timin'
Count it with the homies, everything in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
You's a broke boy, stop it
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
Keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket)
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
Keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket)
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)

[Verse 3: Yhung T.O.]
I mix the cookie with the K.K
Have you ever been on a P.J.?
She wanna get high with a G, ay
I got all these bands on me, ay
You just tell me what you need, baby, I'mma roll up
Thirty-thousand in my pocket, now my life all fold up
She said she got a thing for me but she never told us
I be Glock totin', I be big weed rollin'
Girl you fuckin' with a boss, not a regular
I wanna see you take it off, let me beat it up
I could put you in that Benz, fuck that Acura
I know if I had my nigga Berner then he pullin' up'
Smokin' on that cookie to that kush and orange juice
You know I'm the man, don't know what they told you
B.D.S. diamonds and I paid all cash, yeah
Put you in that spaceship, yeah, you don't gotta ask, yeah

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I got big diamonds, bitch, I'm always big timin'
Count it with the homies, everything in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
You's a broke boy, stop it
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
Keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket)
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
Keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket)
Word to Pimp C, keep the bitch in pocket (in pocket, in pocket)
