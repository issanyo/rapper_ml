[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Wake up to the cleanin' lady knockin' and shit
I close the door so I can bake up
Cause yesterday we, partied the night away, stumbled in close to four
Room full of expensive bags, still all the shit on the floor
But that's just how you live when your wife's a model
Smoke a pound soon as we touch down, do the same thing twice tomorrow
Not to mention what I spend in the club, nigga don't need a price the bottle

[Hook]
Floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating, floating
