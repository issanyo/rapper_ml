[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
This shit ain't as easy as it looks nigga
It's way fucking easier
Don't get it twisted bitch
But on some real shit though

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Man these niggas don't want it
Riding in the car and the watch cost the same thing
Nigga that's stuntin'
Gettin' all this paper
Got me shittin' in public
That roof with a city view
I did that from nothing
And these niggas gon' keep hating me
But I'm just gonna keep stackin' up
No one thing I'll never change
I talk shit but I back it up
You niggas don't go hard as me
So why the fuck you mad at us
I'm rolling up the bombest weed
The first one wasn't fat enough
Your car don't go fast enough
You don't fly first class enough
You don't do no switching states
You don't do no packing up
All you do is gassin' up
That's why you wasn't past enough
Smokin' weed and crackin' up
All this cheese I'm racking up

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Courtney Noelle]
See one thing about me
I've always been about mine
As soon as you doubt me
I show you how hard I grind
Yeah I hear they hate me
But they do it all the time
There's no you without me
I know this so I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Get it how I live it
Get it and don't care how I spend it
Swear to god, my credit card ain't got no limit
Time expensive so I spent hundred thousand on my watches
Full of diamonds
I ain't even reached the top and I'm still climbing
I'm still climbing
I'm still rhyming
Filling up papers with chronic
Keeping niggas out the way
Who got the hating shit in common
Let's be honest
Let's keep it real here
My bank is full of commas
I'm talkin' millions
And I got no problems
Spending what I spent yeah
Cause I'm probably
The realest nigga in here
Matter of fact I know I am
And I know my diamonds are frozen
Not to mention my bank overflowin'
And I just can't stop, I keep goin'

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Courtney Noelle]
See one thing about me
I've always been about mine
As soon as you doubt me
I show you how hard I grind
Yeah I hear they hate me
But they do it all the time
There's no you without me
I know this so I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
