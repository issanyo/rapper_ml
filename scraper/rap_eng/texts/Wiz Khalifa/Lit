Let's get to the basics, let's get to the basics (get to the basics)
I'm rollin' a J up, I'm lovin' the fragrance (lovin' the fragrance)
I'm hardly on time 'cause my mind is where space is (my mind is where space is)
But I always on grind 'cause that's how my fam raised me (how my fam raised me, how my fam raised me)
Think I got problems, say that I'm crazy (say that I'm crazy)
Love marijuana, smoke on the daily (smoke on the daily)
Smoke with my mama, roll one for my lady (one for my lady, one for my lady)
Blow the whole pound now, came up from an eighty (up from an eighty)
I'm lettin' the top down, and countin' them faces (countin' them faces)
I'm blowin' the smoke out, exhalin' the vapors (exhalin' the vapors)
I'm smokin' in public, they stare in amazement (they stare in amazement)
I'm lightin' that bomb up, it's takin' me places (takin' me places)
