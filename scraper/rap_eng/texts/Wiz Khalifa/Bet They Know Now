[Intro-Hook: Raven]
Life is what you make it, so just make it happen
If they mad then don't look at 'em just be lookin' past it
They sayin' what they say but don't pay no attention
Show 'em how we get it

[Verse 1: Raven]
Gotta do your own things, fuck if they hate
I'll be damned if I let anybody stand in my way
Gonna drive a million miles until I find my own lane
Feels like yesterday when I was there broke with no chain
They ain't' lyin' when there's no pain, there ain't no gain
More I go I see shit don't change, it's a cold game
Oh I, oh I, now they know the name
And it's all because I did my shit and always stayed the same, so

[Chorus: Wiz & Raven]
Don't ask me what I say, do what you say
And never let what they say get in your way
You wanna know the right way, do your thing
We taking over everything, we don't play
And I bet they know now
That we could be anything we want
I bet they know now
That we could be anything we want
I bet they know now (now)
That we could be anything we want
I bet they know now
That we could be anything we want
I bet they know now

[Verse 2: Raven]
Yeah I bet they know and I be killing every show
And now we getting shit in motion
Make these mother fuckers jealous
Yeah we ain't' never gon' stop this
Tell these haters come watch this
And I let them know that we drop hits
'cause this Taylor Gang and we got this

[Break: Raven]
Oh, how you live your life is up to you
Oh, if you know it's right then there ain't nothing left to prove

[Verse 3: Raven]
You can't change my mind 'cause it's made up
Woking hard 'till I'm laid up
In something new, getting paid up
'cause what you doin' don't phase us
Profits moving, no days off
Stay focused don't daze up
Boss bitch and I make 'em calls In flight mode 'cos we taking off
Up up and away
If you ain't going a hundred then pump, pump your breaks
Gotta know you really want it and show out every day
Just know Iâ€™ll always stay the same, yeah

[Chorus: Wiz & Raven]
Don't ask me what I say, do what you say
And never let what they say get in your way
They wanna know the right way, do your thing
Taking over everything, we don't play
And I bet they know now
That we could be anything we want
I bet they know now
That we could be anything we want
I bet they know now (now)
That we could be anything we want
I bet they know now
That we could be anything we want
I bet they know now

[Hook: Raven]
Life is what you make it, so just make it happen
If they mad then don't look at 'em just be lookin' past it
They sayin' what they say but don't pay no attention
Show 'em how we get it

[Break: Raven]
Oh, how you live your life is up to you
Oh, if you know it's right then there ain't nothing left to prove

[Outro]
I bet they know now, yeah
I bet they know now
Raven Felix
I bet they know now
Taylor Gang
I bet they know now
I bet they know now
