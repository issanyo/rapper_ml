[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]

Some say that I'm next to be the greatest
And jealousy comes with success, you can't escape it
Them dirty ass niggas will stress you when you caking
Bless you when I'm speaking
I chew one of you guys, yes nigga I'm feastin'
That young nigga beastin'
Body covered with tats and good wheats
And back to back he spits fire among liars
Flames upon lames
The same lil nigga, just playing with dumb change
You staying in one lane, I'm tearing through the streets
Hear you niggas beefing but I ain't saying not one name
That will be the day I give life to y'all lil' niggas
Some older than me, but you all lil' niggas
Going too hard for me to take a fall lil' nigga
Keep doing my thing, get you all a lil' sicker
Splits and big chipas, young but rich niggas
You want that real shit? Then fuck with Wiz nigga!

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay
Listen fam, I hear you man but I'm just a little hotter
Wiz get going and it be hard for you to get him off ya
Young monster, chumps get slumped often
Nigga want to touch my flow? Fuck's wrong with him?
Bomb like Osama and them
I rhyme prominent
Defeating me is an accomplishment
That's why a lot think they want it wet
But they don't really though
Man you lames playing, I do this here for really though
A damn shame is what I hear from you rap guys
But hey
That's motivation for the paper to stack high
Cause with the word play I'm that guy you can't find
Another nigga in the book to match mine (Nope)
You touch the waters and capsize--
I baptize!
Lil niggas and their whack rhymes get flat-lined
They not only can't fuck with me lyrically
Fuckers can't touch me literally
Believe that
