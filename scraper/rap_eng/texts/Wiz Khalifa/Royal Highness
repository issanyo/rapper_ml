[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah uh
Aw man yeah, yeah
Aw yeah

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
If you don't know by now
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down
I ain't really worried about
When my time gon' come
'Cause I know it's now
I been really grinding
Baby, come find me
Gotta let me know you're down
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
On the west side yeah I'm living proof
Started small but now everything new
I spit like I ain't got no tooth
Flying topless, the plane got no roof
I'ma shine till my name in the sky
I'ma ball hard and break all the rules
Graduated and hopped in that coupe
With my main girl now I gotta say bye to you
I can count up a mil on a bad day
She ain't down then she ain't got no use
By the way that she making that ass shake
I just told baby do what she do
She the type I got to search for
Wasn't handed to me, had to work for it
They riding the wave like a surf board
While the boy hotter than the earth core
Told her wait til' I go get my cash right
When the money was low she didn't act right
Caught up living in the fast life
To be the boss I paid the mad price
I be with some women watching Friday
Smoking spliffs up on the highway
Shawty call me royal highness
'Cause I did this shit my way

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
If you don't know by now
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down
I ain't really worried about
When my time gon' come
'Cause I know it's now
I been really grinding
Baby, come find me
Gotta let me know you're down
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh for real
Real expensive, my clothes
I'm reinventing flows
Presidential, my smoke
You guys are little clones
Go 'head and wash your self up
The only loud smell should be the dope
Everything else is top shelf
Dinner on a boat, smoking a joint
I call that time to kill
I don't trip, I let shit slide
But niggas 'round me will
5k, Vegas at Tao, The owner pay the bill
Best seats
We at the game, I'm ashing on the field
Soon as we board the plane, they screwing up they faces
Money in cases, old watches, colorful bracelets
Some of us famous
The others just started they come-up

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
If you don't know by now
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down
I ain't really worried about
When my time gon' come
'Cause I know it's now
I been really grinding
Baby, come find me
Gotta let me know you're down
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down
