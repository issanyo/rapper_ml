[Intro]
Yeah...
Say it
New freestyle
Wiz Khalifa, let's go

[Verse]
I can see
Why you niggas mad, 'cause I'm living the life
Gagging your wife
All I need is spliff and I'm right
Changing the game
I'm sick of all this shit that I write
[?] the mic
You faggot niggas listen and bite
All night
Youngins pitchin' the white
[?]
The balls need a plate, to come up on
[?] come up gone
Niggas know this the style
Look in ya' eyes, I know that you're fraud
Snake niggas runnin' north with the mouth
Quick to [?] the cops
And end up
Getting clapped and then chopped
I'm hazed up
All black in the [?]
More stacks than a knot
A dime piece with spectacular top
The deep texts keep snapping the [?]
But my niggas stay low
Clock big though, cops  get no info
And I'm surrounded by the rules and the breakers
[?]
Hustlers
Movers and shakers
[?]
[?] to the face quick
And me, I'm the same pimp
Hittin' your main chick
Switchin' the lane quick
I'm bit, but but the whip [?]
Hit the stoo, grab some shit I could roll
And it's off to the boof
It's real rap
Yeah this youngest the [?]
Alive nigga from the 4-1-2s
Yeah, and that's my word
I'm son of one of y'all niggas
Whatever you want
I'll punish on of y'all niggas
Fuck the small change
Going for the large figures
It's young Khalifa, the prince [?]
And I believe in god, but I live non-religious
Smokin' weed to get [?]
Your team think that you fly really you are bitchin'
Your man, he couldn't ride
Turned to the long witness
Shit's clear
This year what I'm gonna do
Is making hard for you to eat
Like I'm the stomach fluid
Yeah, yeah, the wolves on a hunt for you
On some fly [?] shit
Quick, but the [?] you
Yeah, yeah, the team 'bout stackin' man
Pittsburgh, middle east, steel city [?]
Pistolvania be the state, you can call it Pakistan
When the young niggas deal with more weight than the average man
The best in my class, I'm the next to both
Even if you put me in yours, I'll be the best of both
And I'm the hardest in this city boo, next to both
GOV, what it is?
J, this is what it is
