[Verse 1:Space Jam JaYe]
Gold bottoms, everything trill
White cup, hand full of pills
Got the money so the bitches chill
They do what we want they love the trill
Caught the flu, yeah a nigga ill
Making deals, I’m talking stacks, I want a mill
Fuck a stack, nigga fuck a rack, how a hundred feel
But a nigga stuntin still
Boy this shit is so fucking real
Acting hard might get you killed,and we all about them dollar bills
That dirty money make my collar chill
Son you niggas, I’m your father still
Bad bitch in them prada heels
I’m royalty, so she better kneel
Fear God, not you, pistol whip and stomp you
Bitch nigga, you are not a factor
All black, like a black panther
Young king so lord with swaga rock star, Mick Jagger
No time for the cheap chatter
These niggas don’t even matter

[Hook]:
Is any of this real
Its like all a dream
Everything Trill
Baby girl take 2 of these
And tell me how you feel

[Verse 2]:
Baby welcome to my mind
It is truly yours!
Welcome to my palace
Look at this décor!
Cocaine, marble floor
Champagne connoisseur money carnivore
I’m a hustler to the core
Draped up, dripping like water, look at all this ice
Money taped up in the goyard duffel
Count it so precise, she wet, she lick her friend
But she ain’t no dyke
That money, make the bitches come
And that’s the shit I like
I play with that pussy while switching legs
I slap that ass while I’m getting brain
So insane, how it interplay
I keep your girls so entertain
Zanny bars with that fucking lean
Hyped up on caffeine
I'm popping beans she getting wasted
Fly as fuck and you niggas basic

[Hook]

Forever Fly
