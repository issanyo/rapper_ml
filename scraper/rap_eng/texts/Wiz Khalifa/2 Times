[Intro]
Ok it Wiz Khalifa
Its Gucci ah, Drumma
Mary Jane, hit a fews times
Cause I'm 2 times it's Gucci 2 times

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I'm "Mister Make Her Stare"
Think we make a tear
Last night was a blur, least I wore fur
I pulled up in the rear, engine in the rear
End of the night was pulling on her hair I really
Don't care the games unfair Gucci Mane La Flare
Who gives a care about niggas over there?
Shawty got a pear: apple with a gap
I think we make a pair, she like em from the trap
I got her in the chair she think she in the lear
The way I'm switchin' gears, got her takin' off her heels
I'm Mr. Get Her There, take your underwear, you fuckin
With a boss no need for fuckin with a square

[Hook]
I light the weed up, and hit it two times
Smoke is so good I hit it few times
If I hit her once I hit her two times
If I did it once I can do two times

[Verse 2 - Wiz khalifa]
Oh I got a joint burnin here real slow
Wanna slide to my crib lets go I
Show u my double balcony put ur head in my
Lap rite before u start to make out wit me
Crib in L.A I flew her to the south with me
You niggas wanna be players? Well I can show you how to be
I got my salary up now all them bitches say hi to me
I'm smoking loud and these niggas just trying to be as high as me
Another causality I kill every beat, I'm smokin on celery
Only fuck with papers a gang of Taylors on every feet
I don't fuck with them haters cause niggas hate but we never speak
Yo bitch want me to save her u betta tame her of get a leash
Mutha-fucker

[Hook]
I light the weed up and hit it two times
Smoke is so good I hit it a few times
If I hit her once I hit her two times
If I did it once I can do two times
