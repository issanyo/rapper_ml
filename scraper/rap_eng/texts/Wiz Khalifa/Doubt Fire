[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I keep throwing money with no problems
I can feel, with more money, more problems
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
I be blowin' Kush up where the clouds is
I be going shoppin', ain't no browsing
I take your bitch and show her around then
I be so high, don't know where the ground is
Roll one up if it's 'bout cash then I'm showin' up
'Cause I remember days that they doubted

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I keep throwing money with no problems
I can feel, with more money, more problems
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it

[Outro]
This is your pilot, Captain EZ Wider
It's gonna be a smooth but bumpy ride
And I say that because
There's some real niggas in this plane, y'all
And I advise you not to bring any fake weed
Boof weed, bad weed, blunts, backwoods, frontwoods
Swisha sweets or Swisha sours on this plane
Make sure to have your seat belts tight and your weed rolled right
'Cause we will begin busy on this plane y'all
It's W-E-E-D airlines, where everybody flies high
And we gon' ride in the rolling papers too in style
It's gon' be a smooth landing, y'all
Wiz Khalifa's gon' be right there waiting for y'all, I promise
Captain EZ Wider is gon' get y'all there
