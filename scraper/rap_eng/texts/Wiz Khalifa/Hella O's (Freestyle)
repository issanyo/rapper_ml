[Intro: Adele]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll one up and let's get high
I am tryin' to get fried
I bought some weed and you can smoke
You trying get high and I'm tryna toke
Hit this weed once don't you choke, oh oh oh
I got a grinder, I got a bong
I got some weed so let's make a song
I got some munchies, we all get along, uh uh uh
I smoke weed ain't nothing wrong
My money good and my money long
My bitch bad and my kush strong, uh uh uh uh uh
I be right I don't be wrong
I smoke weed all day long
Wake up too and go to sleep with that
Pack...
