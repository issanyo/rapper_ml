[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
Foreign cars, that's every day
A million off a tour, that's every day
A hundred broads, that's every day
Getting this money- Living large, in every way
(Smoking dope) that's every day
(Run through your door) that's every day
(Pulling hoes) that's every day
(Get money more) that's every day
(Get money more) that's every day

[Verse 1: Wiz khalifa]
Rapping ass nigga
There go Wiz, he a rapping ass nigga
I'm in a benz getting brain from a centerpiece
Before you can mention my name you need ten at least
I know they hate cause of the paper that a nigga see
Light a J and say a prayer for my enemies.... Yeah
Made men bunch of made ass niggas
When you paid then you with some paid ass niggas
I heard that money grow on trees so I grew one
Left my old bitch at home got a new one
Said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it
I said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it
Your bitch leaving with us nigga that's tragic
The roof go in the trunk....that's magic
She rolling weed and she don't even smoke
Come to your job and make it flood bet you gone need a boat

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
Foreign cars, that's every day
A million off a tour, that's every day
A hundred broads, that's every day
Getting this money- Living large, in every way
(Smoking dope) that's every day
(Run through your door) that's every day
(Pulling hoes) that's every day
(Get money more) that's every day
(Get money more) that's every day

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm 20 years in and I still win
Hanging with the taylors drinking gin and im dancing
Sunday I will ride the Bugatti- monday I ride Benz
Any chick and all of her friends you know I'm tossing
Money spent (you know it), little money folded (you know it)
You got one crib (you know it), Juicy got 4 (you know it)
Only clubs that I like gotta have poles ( you know it)
Only fuck with model chick, but I play with hoes (you know it)
My mansion sitting on forty acres --- who the neighbors? (whoooooo)
Kobe bryant from the lakers...now thats paper (lets get it)
And I still mob through the hood I dont need no waviers (yes sir)
Cause if you niggas getting wrong, I'mma see you later (Blowww)

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
Foreign cars, that's every day
A million off a tour, that's every day
A hundred broads, that's every day
Getting this money- Living large, in every way
(Smoking dope) that's every day
(Run through your door) that's every day
(Pulling hoes) that's every day
(Get money more) that's every day
(Get money more) that's every day
