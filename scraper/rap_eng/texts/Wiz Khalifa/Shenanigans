[Verse 1 - Jace]
I’m rolling while drinking, pouring and thinking
Twisting my fingers, they know who my gang is
Shots of that Jag and I’m already faded
Still independent, still got to get it
No need for names cause they know who I came with
Not a cashier but I know where that change is
Bottles and franks, but I know where champagne is
Plus I’m bilingual, I know what he saying
Plus I’m that nigga, there’s no need for banging
Unless you a dummy, then I explain it
Know who I’m bringing so fuck what they saying
Fucking [?] niggas, why is you playing?
Games is all dumb and I ain’t with the lame shit
Made your bitch come in and fucked your old lady
Still what you hating, man you be crazy

[Hook – Wiz Khalifa]
Ooh, all these bands, Imma spend it all on you
Real niggas in here, I brought em through
Champagne’s all that I drink, take straight shots, no chase
Ain't no other  way, it’s going up
It’s going up, it’s going up, it’s going up
It’s going up, it’s going up, it’s going up
Ain’t going down
It’s going up
It’s going up, it’s going up, it’s going up
It’s going up, it’s going up, it’s going up
Ain’t going down, it’s going up

[Verse 2 – Curtis Williams]
Still getting paid with my niggas
The bitch still tryna get a picture
Never switched up, yeah the money still the mission
Got a few bands, if I like it then I spend it
Roll up a blunt, then I spark it
Watch the camera shoot pics like a target
Fable how I’m feeling when I hit it
Money ain’t an option, Imma blow it when I get it
Get it, get it, these niggas still in this bitch tipping
Couple songs later on she might get richer
You smoke good weed, but the pack a little different
Cones or the dutchs, I don’t ever do the swishers
Still got that cross on the denim
Still pull up with a car full of women
