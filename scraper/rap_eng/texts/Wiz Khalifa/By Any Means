[Intro]
Good one Richard
Carisma

[Chorus: OneInThe4Rest]
Keep my hittas with me make sure that I'm straight
Threw the benz away and copped the Mulsanne (skrr skrr)
For the times that the niggas try to write me off
Had to make sure that the whole gang straight
Aha, Imma get it anyway (oh)
Aha, Imma get it anyway (ya)
Aha, Imma get it anyway
Any means Imma get it anyway

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Keep my brothers with me make sure that I'm straight (straight)
We do fancy unlike every other day (day)
Buzz them over, mash potatoes with the steak (steak)
All my diamonds like they hopped up out the lake
I fucked her twice she say boy I need a break
She says, twenty can't believe you blew up overnight (ya)
Fuck me like you love me you might get a better flight (bddp)
Damn, diamonds look like vegetarian (hello)
All that ass, you'll be scaring em (ya)
My bitch bad an I'm wit her (ya)
Just a fat fly nigga
20 where you at, in the studio with cap

[Chorus: OneInThe4Rest]
Keep my hittas with me make sure that I'm straight
Threw the benz away and copped the Mulsanne (skrr skrr)
For the times that the niggas try to write me off
Had to make sure that the whole gang straight
Aha, Imma get it anyway
Aha, Imma get it anyway
Aha, Imma get it anyway
Any means Imma get it anyway

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Keep the gas on me, homie I be baked
Crib in Malibu, or one out by the lake
You can fuck me with once and don't even gotta stay
We smoking joints 4 in the morning, wide awake
Don't book the flight, I get the plane
She hit it once, then I roll another J
Cause them other dudes ain't smoking right
Plus I hit it good, take you places that I know you like
Chain look like an aquarium
Was lookin at your favorite shoes, now you wearin em
I'm just a young, fit nigga
Dollars I got plenty in the studio with 20 ya

[Chorus: OneInThe4Rest]
Keep my hittas with me make sure that I'm straight
Threw the benz away and copped the Mulsanne (skrr skrr)
For the times that the niggas try to write me off
Had to make sure that the whole gang straight
Aha, Imma get it anyway (anyway)
Aha, Imma get it anyway
Aha, Imma get it anyway
Any means Imma get it anyway

[Outro]
Hm, anyway (K fours)
