[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Aye aye aye aye

[Hook ]
We cop from the weed spot
We don't duck when we see cops
We rollin', laid back, blowin' trees out
No time for the stress, I just keep on going

We cop from the weed spot
We don't duck when we see cops
We rollin', laid back, blowin' trees out
No time for the stress, I just keep going

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, I tell ya what nigga, I neva' gave a fuck, nigga
Less it was paying us, nigga
Back when we was in the cut
And not everybody was fuckin' with us
Knew we'd do it just how we did it
Split the pie right down the middle
Smokin' at the pound got that killa continuous
The grind we on strenuous
But we too far in this shit to consider quitting, bitch
Reminiscent of that Southernplayalistic disc
The Cadillacs of raps, the Vogue tires of rhymers
Classic smooth like Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas, watch us

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, either you in or you in
My niggas destined to win, be there beginning to end
Getting money with my genuine friends
This shit get strenuous
How the fuck ya roll with us now but you ain't been with us?
Held my brother down, back then we was creating nigga style
How to get yo money, how to live right
How to treat yo hoes, how to spend ya time
And how to catch a plane, nigga, how fly
I got it tattooed in my skin
Ain't nothin' change 'cept the way the money fold
You cop the zip, I'ma roll
Nigga, we gon' split the whole zone
And take some bitches to the honeycomb aye!
Ha ha ha

[Hook]
