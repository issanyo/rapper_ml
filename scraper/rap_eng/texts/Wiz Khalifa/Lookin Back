[Spoken Intro]
Yo Wazzup Molly?
Its [?] man
Im at the studio right now
I was thinking about you
[?]

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Me and them niggas used to hustle but the game different
We was in the same kitchen, cook cocaine different
Never once did I showed him who do lame business
Or riding me it don't belong up in the same sentence
If you go broke, you get it back and don't go broke again
You acting funny, swear to god that I'ma know to swing
My cousin said he off the rock but now he smoke again
He think its funny man like life is just a joke to him
Man I done had my share an' lets go get it hopeless friend
Can't nobody tell you how we feel when this thing end
I serve my cousin man I guess I met him to the cycle
Gotta keep this money right hand on the bible

[Hook: Chevy Woods]
All I know is how It gotta go
Straight to the money baby is all I know
All I know is how It gotta go
Straight to the money baby is all I know

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
My cousin show me how to cook it, I ain't have a problem
I got this .40 on me, shout out to the robbers
We on the top right now, we started from the bottom
Rest in peace to Ike, I'm playing Nostradamus
When Cap tell me get on it I just sit and listen
You niggas ain't no bosses man y'all need permission
You acting like you balling, not just for the weekend
And on the weekend got your bitch in Vicky Secrets
I gotta get this money, what you thought I wasn't
That's neighborhood on me I put that on my cousin
Just made a play but Ricky be my dog for life
Ask Taylor Gang, I do this shit like every night

[Hook: Chevy Woods]
All I know is how It gotta go
Straight to the money baby is all I know
All I know is how It gotta go
Straight to the money baby is all I know

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, four in the morning, shorty laughin'
She working for purses to put that gas in, you throw them 1's
She talk dirty before she cash in, soon as you're done
Counting that money up on the mattress, figured you won
She only fucking you cause your status
Running back to me braggin'
Actin' like she tired from the nights action
Just the thought that you might smash it
Got you strugglin' with your life, paying bills, buying shoes, looking for flights
You got everything, and work for everything
Ain't nobody came around and gave you anything
Major cake what you used to makin'
Them niggas fake send them on their way
Then in the morning say

[Hook: Chevy Woods]
All I know is I gotta go
Straight to the money baby is all I know
All I know is how It gotta go
Straight to the money baby is all I know
