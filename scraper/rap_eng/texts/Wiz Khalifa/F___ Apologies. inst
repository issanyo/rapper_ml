[Opening: Wiz Khalifa]
I ain't apologising for shit
I do what I want
And JoJo does too

[Verse 1: JoJo]
Saw it in your eyes
When you said goodbye
You didn't even try
So this time I don't care

[Pre-Chorus: JoJo]
And honestly I was just about to pick up the phone
And then I realised that I didn't do nothing wrong
You would even tell two lies to prove that you were right
Usually I'd gone and take the blame but not this time, not this time

[Chorus: JoJo]
What you want from me? I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
Fuck apologies, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride, that's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
If I - if I - if I really meant it

[Verse 2: JoJo]
I can't help that you
Feel the way you do
Try not to get confused
'Cause this time I don't care

[Pre-Chorus: JoJo]
And honestly I was just about to pick up the phone
And then I realised that I didn't do nothing wrong
Didn't do nothing wrong

[Chorus: JoJo]
What you want from me? I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
Fuck apologies, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride, that's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay, no apologising
Ain't no way to take the things you did back or disguise it
Always wondered what I'm doing but that's TMI
Don't know what you got until its gone, now you realise it
Wasn't it once playing smart now I'm being wise
Finally I'm moving on and I don't need your lies
And it wasn't even tough cause I could see the signs
Now you're stuck, call an uber up if you need a ride

[Chorus: JoJo]
What you want from me? I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
Fuck apologies, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride, that's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it

[Post-Chorus: JoJo]
What you want from me? I'm not sorry
Fuck apologies, no no not saying that
I'm not perfect, I got pride, that's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
If I - if I - if I really meant it
