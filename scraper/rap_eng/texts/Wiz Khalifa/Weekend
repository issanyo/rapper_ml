[Hook]
Yeah
I live life like the weekend (weekend)
Get it in every night til the week end (week end)
Stay up til' the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah)
Hard work got my bank account peakin' (peakin')
Shit straight, you can trust me
Niggas gon' hate, but the hoes just love me (love me)
Don't it sound so good
How a youngin' so fresh with a style so hood

[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]
Got visions of your man, broke and doin' bad
Fans stand in line just to take pictures of your man
Flow hot, should be in the kitchen with the pans
Money be on the floor stacked to the ceiling with the fan
I'm living what I'm saying
Name known everywhere I go, west coast to the buildings in Japan
Trying to keep them dollar signs fillin' up my pants
So I don't need weight, the boy got cake
See me in every city, different broad in every state
Niggas all got new intentions cause I'm winning in the race
I make a broad turn groupie
She like, "gosh, look at all this Gucci"
I have her in the crib late night, in the crib rollin' that stink up
Now she talkin' bout getting inked up
I don't see ya'll weak fucks
Now that ya'll swole me and Neako linked up
Now we gon' eat up

[Hook]
Yeah
I live life like the weekend (weekend)
Get it in every night til the week end (week end)
Stay up til' the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah)
Hard work got my bank account peakin' (peakin')
Shit straight, you can trust me
Niggas gon' hate, but the hoes just love me (love me)
Don't it sound so good
How a youngin' so fresh with a style so hood

[Verse 2 - Neako]
Wizzle listen, this is where them and us both differ
Before they had the voice now they have the picture
And we will deliver
We are the stars, the big dippers, get it?
High sky scrapin', the constellations
My flow forsaken and they cannot take it
And I'm gon' give it and they will not make it
My flow coke an I'm gon' bake it
But I never sold it
More like a weed tota, Motorola, Nextel chirpa
Your girl is a slurpa, but you don' know it
Young Wiz told me, he put his homie on it
And I ran up on it, and we had a moment or two
You ain't seen me since how lonely are you?
You sad and you're weapin', I'm comin' right back
I'mma see you next weekend

[Hook]
Yeah
I live life like the weekend (weekend)
Get it in every night til' the week end (week end)
Stay up til the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah)
Hard work got my bank account peakin' (peakin')
Shit straight, you can trust me
Niggas gon' hate, but the hoes just love me (love me)
Don't it sound so good
How a youngin' so fresh with a style so hood
