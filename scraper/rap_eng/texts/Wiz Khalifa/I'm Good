[Verse 1]
Yeaa
I'm g-o-o-d
You feel me, yeah
Fresh fit new Chucks
I swear I feel like a million bucks
And them leather seats feel like plush
Four twelves make my shit go bump (go bump)
20 carrats got your bitch goin' nuts
Livin' like a star, so they get so struck
Far as rap, got this shit sowed up
Ridin' by myself couple sticks rolled up
On these frames, I done spent so much
Niggas wanna nip, so the fo-fifth on tuck
And just look, don't touch
I know you don't see this usually
But excuse me, these Gucci
Got a future so bright, you'll see
Man I'm this young, why is life so sweet
In my shoes, yeah, they might wanna be
The cameras right here and the lights on me
Let's go

[Hook]
I'm good
Livin' just the way I should
Most niggas ain't think I could
Look homie, I'm good
Doin' what I said I would
You try but to me, it ain't 'nothing to it
Cause lil homie, I'm good
Most niggas ain't think I could
But I'm livin' just the way I should
Yeah homie, I'm good
Yeah I'm good
Yeah I'm good
Yeah I'm good

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, more cars, more clothes
Get money, that's the life I chose
Chase money nigga, why chase hoes
They ain't even want me 'til my neck got froze
And the price got told
Stories by trips in the nice sized homes
It's a game, play the life I know
On the winnin' end wen the dice got rolled
Tall nigga so my flights got room
Small nigga so I always got goons
Say you get a lil' cash, that's cool
I probaly spent more than that on tattoos
I got the formula you need to find
My city on lock and the keys are mine
So you can go and keep your piece of mind
Cause I'm G, 2 Os, and a D with mine
Let's go

[Hook]
