[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa & Phife Dawg]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Hunny say she love herself so mesmerized
Could tell that she smoke I see it in her eyes
Rollin up weed that’s my everyday
My ’69 drop ain't got no ashtray
I smile a lot, but baby girl I do not play
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

[Phife Dawg]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you

[Wiz Khalifa]
Yo, I smoked you out
I let hit with the bong, and blow the whole thing out
She like me cause my weed come [?] from another state
Pullin kush out by the pound girl it wasn't a 8th

[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

[Wiz Khalifa]
Stretch out your legs, and get comfortable
Roll that mary jane, smell it through the wall
Careful how you smoke, it's very strong
Stronger than thai, stronger than cologne
Take you to the club and you buy me drinks
Now I wanna pound of kush that really stinks
Keep some marijuana and I'll be your boy

[Phife Dawg]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, "No", labelled me a ho
I said, "How you figure?" "My friends told me so"
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that

[Wiz Khalifa]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could roll and puff a L and I can F you to sleep
Do our own thing yea we keep it unique
When I get over to your crib then we officially meet

[Phife Dawg]
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

[Wiz Khalifa]
Chevy Woods, Jerm, and Ricky P
Loody, Motor, Lonny and my big man Breeze
They know Khalifa man is really soul on ice
The character is of men, not a computer lie
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of chronic and it ain't nothin nice

[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

[Outro]
Light one out for Phife Dawg
