[Verse 1: Amber Rose]
Scrutinize, being blind
Excited by all the lights
The question wasn't made up
Like these rumors were made up
Can't shop for clothes or buy some cigs
Without paparazzi waiting for a flick
This is a new situation
Now you're an overnight sensation

[Hook 1]
You're not ready for the fame
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're not ready for the fame
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Amber Rose]
Can't deny it's just fly
Private jets flying high
Rockin'-rockin' things you won't see
Tailor-made by Givenchy
Three years ago, just a girl
Now your name is known around the world
This is a new situation
Now you're an overnight sensation

[Hook 2]
Now you're ready for the fame
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Now you're ready for the fame
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
And you made it this year
Coming up so they hate it
Fly first class so they could get mad
You heard what they have to say but you paid it
Now you're busting out, doing your thing
In your face, cuss 'em out
Brag cause you're the one that they fuss about
You's a bad little mother shut your mouth, cause...

[Bridge]
Everything you say will
And can be used against you
Everything you say will
And can be used against you
Everything you say will
And can be used against you
Everything you say...

It's all because of the F-A-M-E
You're not ready
You're not ready for the fame
Now you're ready...

[Hook 2]

F-A-M-E, F-A-M-E
F-A-M-E, F-A-M-E
Are you ready for the fame?
