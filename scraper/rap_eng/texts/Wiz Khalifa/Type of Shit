[Intro: Buddy]
This my type of shit (aye)
This my type of shit (aye)
Got ma-ri-juana-a-a (oh yeah)

[Chorus: Buddy]
This my type of shit, when I hop up in my whip (aye)
This my type of shit, when I pull up to that (shit)
This my type of shit, when I turn up in the VIP (aye)
This my type of shit, when I'm rolling up that (hey)

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Stumblin' all in the party, yeah we 'bout to get this shit started (aye)

All of this shit I'mma do tonight probably forget in the morning
Shit, finna' roll me up another one, I ain't been smoking enough

Oh man, I'm high (oh man, I'm high)

[Bridge: Buddy]
I be in L.A
Smoke weed everyday
Fuck what you say
We be getting paper
Hey, you so fake
You all in the way
You needa' get your weight up

[Chorus: Buddy]
This my type of shit, when I hop up in my whip, aye
This my type of shit, when I pull up to that (shit)
This my type of shit, when I turn up in the VIP (aye)
This my type of shit, when I'm rolling up that (hey)

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Sorry God, I know I said I'll never drink again
But I take it back, I'm going up all weekend
I've been working so hard lately, I'm starting to feel like I need this
Anytime that I hit the dance-floor, you ain't tryin' battle me bitch!
Start with the right cheek, go to the left cheek, back to the right cheek
All of them ass cheeks, how in the hell did you fit 'em in them damn jeans?
Wait, how did you do that?
Give da' girl room, everybody better move back
Tryna' dance wit' ya' boo, get a chance wit' ya' boo
Gon' hit a little two-step
'Cause

[Bridge: Buddy]
We fly
Alright
Got ma-ri-juana (marijuana)
We got a lighter (lighter)
I'm getting too drunk (too drunk)
I need some water (water)
Now put your hands up (hands up)
We wanna party with a (party with a)

[Chorus: Buddy]
This my type of shit, when I hop up in my whip
This my type of shit, when I pull up to that (shit)
This my type of shit, when I turn up in the VIP (aye)
This my type of shit, when I'm rolling up that (hey)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm zoning
Niggas takin' dabs
Yawnin', passin' out, not waking up 'til three in the morning
Honestly, I'm floating
I just brought a bag of God's greatest green grass to share with everyone that I knowin'
Obviously we been smokin'
Eyes barely open from the weed
Used to smoke 'em with them champs
So you know it ain't no seeds
Raw paper, what you need?
Passin' out from bong rips
Long trips
Mickey D's
Smokin' M's wit' them g's
Roll another one

[Bridge: Buddy]
We fly
Alright
Got ma-ri-juana (marijuana)
We got a lighter (lighter)
I'm getting too drunk (too drunk)
I need some water (water)
Now put your hands up (hands up)
We wanna party with a (party with a)

[Chorus: Buddy]
This my type of shit, when I hop up in my whip
This my type of shit, when I pull up to that (shit)
This my type of shit, when I turn up in the VIP (aye)
This my type of shit, when I'm rolling up that (hey!)
