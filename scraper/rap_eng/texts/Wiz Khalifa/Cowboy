[Intro]
Mhmm
That's just how it is man
Round my way

[Verse 1]
Just a young lil' nigga, but he had the right plan
Twenty-thousand in his left, pistol in his right hand
Counting every dollar that he get, cause he worked for it
But don't run up on him cause you'll probably get murked for it
Mom's out working, Daddy wasn't home
Ain't nobody give it to him, so he got it on his own
Yeah, he got it on his own
You want something? Gotta take it
Tryna get up out the hood, but he’ll probably never make it
He’s a midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where them niggas they some killas

[Hook]
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas

[Verse 2]
Just a young nigga, but he had the right plan
Slanging looking for them people hopping out them white vans
Standing on the corner rolling up their marijuana
Smoking weed and selling packs of D till you’re a gonner
Caught a case and lost some racks, the nigga got it back
In any case a nigga disrespect, he’s on his back
He bought a pack, then bought a strap
This niggas got his back
His life has changed it’s gone to smack
And ain’t no turning back

[Hook]
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas

[Verse 3]
Just a young nigga, but he had the right plan
Wore a lot of jewelry, he slept with it on his nightstand
Made a lot of money and he got it all from hustling
Came from a good family but say he can’t get enough of it
All up in the club and he ain’t looking for a ring
Fucking other niggas bitches, yeah he swear that was his thing
Yeah, he learned a little lesson ‘bout messing with them haters
Cause they found his body later
Guess that’s what he get for fucking with them...

[Hook]
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
