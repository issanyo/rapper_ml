[Hook:x3]
I'm a cigarillo fiend smokin' weed like it's oxygen
Roll a lot skunk, need some blunts, get two boxes in
Goin' to pull my stash, out rollin' out this half ounce
Puff pass, nigga I puff grass till I pass out

[Verse: 1]
Half pounds what I got to smoke up in some days
Yeah I choke up and get blazed
Eyes closed up and get glazed
I'll blow some in your face
But you ain't hitting nothin'
If I'm in here I gotta smoke somethin' nigga

[Hook:x1]
I'm a cigarillo fiend smokin' weed like it's oxygen
Roll a lot skunk, need some blunts, get two boxes in
Goin' to pull my stash, out rollin' out this half ounce
Puff pass, nigga I puff grass till I pass out

I'm smokin' good x7

[Verse: 2]
Niggas know about what young Khalifa into
Love to smoke out, a lot of reefer in him
Get you skunked out, you know I'm street official
When boys gotta problem, you should keep your issue
I'm from Pistolvania, where them heaters hit you
Out in California, where the weed official
And you could tell that I'm a boss
Don't really gotta tell you that I'm smokin' good, you smell it through the wall

[Hook]

I'm smokin' good
