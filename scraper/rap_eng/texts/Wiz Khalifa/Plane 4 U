[Verse]
You know what I smoke
You know what I drive
You know where I stay
You frequently fly
We shop we buy
We don't just be looking
We never be dry
I always supply it anytime you want
There ain't no need to deny
You're suppose to be in the sky
Some people think it's a lie, but I don't even know why
I put my weed in a cone
We smoking weed like a tribe
You smoking weed to get by
We smoking weed to survive
Smoking that medical

To roll that plane for you
Smoking on medical
Ooh girl
Smoking on medical
I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one
To roll that plane for you
Smoking on medical
Ooh girl
Smoking on medical

[Outro: Mr. Easy Rider]
Yeaaheaa
This one goes out to all my patients and paitent-ettes
With that medical weed card yall
And I heard it's legal in Nevada too
Recreation on Seattle
So if you got your ID
Make sure you show up to your local dispensary
And cop you some of that KK
And tell em I sent you
And to all the states that ain't legalize it yet
Get on board man
We need the green
Make the world a better place
By putting the grass all in your face
Free the weed
Let everybody's who's locked up out of jail
And let all these patients get well
There ain't nothing wrong with it
You was just raised to think it was bad
But now its time to change your mind
Open your eyes yall
Look around, everybody's getting high
