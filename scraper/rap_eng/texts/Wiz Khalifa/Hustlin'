[Intro]
If I said it, I meant it nigga...
We all in... everything's Taylor'd
And fuck it, we ain't gotta go to the store no more
I got my own papers baby girl, I'm finna get my own weed too
Get you a pound and let you roll that shit

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm rollin' up the windows while I'm smoking weed
Driving through my town like I don't know the speed
Countin' so much paper I can't fold it up
Bad bitch, she sucks me while I'm rollin' up
Yeah bitch, you probably see me everywhere
Money long, now my house got tv's everywhere
Literally everywhere you turn you see a flat-screen
New bitch...looked nothing like my last fling
Ridin in a Maserati nigga no shirt
Niggas probably hatin' on me but it won't work
Camo shorts on like a general
Mind on a mill blowin' on medicinal

[Chorus]
I'm just a young nigga hustlin', yeah...
Hustlin' yeah...

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Been through every nigga town, neva had a problem
Young millionaire, never had a job though
Throw that money up and watch her hit the ground
As long as your money up she said it's goin' down
Brought her homegirl said that she don't do friends
Kicked the bitch out and make her find new friends
Should I get hella high or buy some new rims
745 or a new benz
I take every day and live like it's the weekend
Doin it all if you ain't ballin', take a seat then
If I said it, I meant it...throw a stack at that bitch-ass
And let her pay her rent with it

[Chorus]
I'm just a young nigga hustlin', yeah...
Hustlin' yeah...
