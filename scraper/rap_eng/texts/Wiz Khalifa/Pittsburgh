[Verse 1: Wiz khalifa]
Yeah, this's for the 412
All the rhyming, all the grinding, all the time I do it all for you
Cause you raised me, never played me
And when a nigga needed money, you paid me
Mixture with Jamaican crazy, you make me
Niggas been tell me not to fuck with you lately
But I can't see
The day I ever turn my back on where I'm from, there might be some but that ain't me
I love you to death, though at times you get crazy
I ain't gonna lie, sometimes it feels like you hate me
But don't get it fucked up, I know that this's tough luck
And true appreciation's what you don't get enough of
And you can trust, that I put nothing above you
Scream out your name so I'll make everyone love you
As much as I love you, it shouldn't surprise you
I rep where I'm from nigga, you know how I do
I'm from Pittsburgh

[Chorus: Tone Trezure]
The street lights, keep calling
I can see the mirrors falling
In front on my face I see him
Reaching out for me
The wind blows, so subtle
This is in my streets like chatter
If I don't take this chance, they might not come around again

[Wiz khalifa]
Yeah, a lot of new blood in you, but you got an old soul
The summer you hot, in the winter you so cold
And most people don't know, that you got a star
When I be on the road, they ask me who you are
Never seen you before, but I'm letting them know though
I didn't mean to leave you out and getting that show dough
And I always come back to you put my soul in this music when I rap to you
Bleed the track for you
Yeah, you got a habit of making the young nigga's dream
Take a look at all he got in one bigger thing
For you I'd give anything
And it's a shame to say, that sometimes you don't feel the same way
But everything's still everything
I'm just grinding for a time where my city see better days
And I swear we'll never separate
Everywhere I go, I let them know
I'm from Pittsburgh

[Chorus]
