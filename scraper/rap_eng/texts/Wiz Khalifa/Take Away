[Intro]
Yeah bitch
That's what I like to call
My type of shit

[Verse 1]
Yeah, forward progression
Niggas got it backwards
I'm relevant
But nothing like you other rappers
You see, I fuck with trap niggas
Because really I'm the only one rapping
Get it how you live
Survival of the fittest, you should know the code
All I got is what I give until they overload
Nigga, I'm the shit, overflowed
And I grab a blunt, split it like a chromosome
I'll have it where you're bitch ain't phoning home
We done blown a whole O gettin' our stoner on
Ain't gotta say shit, I know you're gone
See my chain, make the same face from "Home Alone"
All this good weed that I'm puffing got me feeling
Like there ain't a place I can't go
Ain't a thing I won't do
And I'm awake
So I guess my dreams come true

[Hook]
And the game gave me a feeling
That no one can take away from me
I said no one can take away from me
On the road doing shows, oh no one can take away from me
I get a feeling that no one can take away

[Verse 2]
Down to take a trip
My nigga, what's the ticket hitting for?
I got some hoes that wanna roll too
And if you wanna see what it's like to be just the team
And tired of the background, so you make your own scene
I'll hit you up when I roll through
Yeah, California weed
Keep a Pistolvania mind state
Hard to get it honest
So my niggas boost the crime rate
It's obvious I'm ghetto
Still they love me like I'm Kid Rock
Try your luck with what's around my neck
And get your wig chopped
Fucking with I, can get you so much cash
Or nowhere fast
I got your bitch in awe, she never flown first class
Or had the driver get her bags

[Hook]
And the game gave me a feeling
That no one can take away from me
I said no one can take away from me
On the road doing shows, oh no one can take away from me
I get a feeling that no one can take away
