[Verse 1: Raven Felix]
One for the money, two for the show
Three drinks and fold J's that I'm about to roll
Got your [?] riding with the gang
And we [?] everything that's around us
Asking what you know about it
When we came they be wilding
They be jumping up and down
They surround us so we roll a couple ounces
Then we bouncin'
We be styling on these bitches
Vaporize never swishers
Pregaming at the crib before we head to the event
Hit the red carpet
If you know us then you know we get shit started
Party everywhere we go and I ain't just talking
Yea we take it all the way
'Couse I'm here to get you aquanted with this valid fornication ahh
Late nights, early morning
You got a bottle in this bitch
You better get to pouring
Its when they know you on everybody gets their calling
I be out with Wiz touring till the day I get a foreign
When you see me ahh

[Verse 2: Raven Felix]
2 am and I'm still awake
Hella baked we don't ever sleep
Get another drink
Cali living so its nothing but a G thing
T gang we got them turning up like a heat weave
And I'm from the Valley I know what that heat lie
If you with it we get lit up on a week night
When I say lit I'm taking lit up like a street light
Man I be going ham like I don't eat right
Bad bitch I'm a star
Top down middle fingers up when I'm in the car
Yea I'm bout to keep them shots coming when we hit the bar
Going hard till the sunset
[?] on Sunset boulevard
Then its on to the next turn up
The weed burn up
The queen first up
I give you something you can learn from
West side when I'm repping mine
Bitch you know the squad so it should be no surprise
When you see me ahh
