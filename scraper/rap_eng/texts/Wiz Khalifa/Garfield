[Intro: Chevy Woods]
I can't hear you
What you sayin'?

[Hook: Chevy Woods]
Girl don't talk to me, let your pussy talk (x2)
Let me get that Garfield, Garfield, Garfield (x2)
Let me show ya how its Garfield, Garfield, Garfield
Let your pussy talk, Let me get that Garfield, Garfield, Garfield

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Them leather seats in my car wheeler
Leather seats in my car, so real
Diamonds in the Skate P, on my stone grip
All my diamonds on my diamonds, yeah they so real
Use the seat on the car still
On the motherfucking car seat nigga
Girls jumping with that Garfield
Let that pussy talk, let that pussy talk
Let that pussy talk to a nigga
Let that pussy talk, let that pussy talk
If you snitching, I don't talk to that Garfield
I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk
Taking shots with all ya friends [?]
Taking all these Bombay shots
After this I'ma take ya down
Let your pussy talk

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
In the trap, with my dreads out up in the club
Girl your ass so fat, when I fuck in the club
I'ma get some money, throw some money up in the club
Throw some love, when you see a thug, up in the club
Worried about nothing, no, my niggas packing
In the club, know I got that becky
Shit, she got that package
Riding in her whip, roof on like magic
She owe me plastic, she owe me nasty
She owe me action, ya owe me action
We them boys, who cone joints in the bathroom
My whip is faster, my bitch is badder
I hear them talking, but they don't matter
I eat her good, got table manners
I get my cake up and when I wake up
Fuck up your make up like hold up, hold up, hold up

[Hook]
