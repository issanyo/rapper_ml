[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
How about you roll one and we get to know each other?
I've got you on one, you can come whenever
Say he don't fuck you right, you shittin' me?
He can never, what's the price, you shittin' me?
Gettin' out on your own, you shittin' me?
You can feel the night alone, you shittin' me?

[Verse 1: Bluntsmoker]
These pieces ain't hittin' (you shittin' me?)
That nigga not whippin' (you shittin' me?)
I own it, not a rented (you shittin' me?)
This means you can't get it (you shittin' me?)
Now we take private flights, no more lonely nights
Yes, you can spend the night, I'ma hit it real right
Nah, I ain't trippin', baby, you can go Gucci crazy
I-I'ma treat you like a lady, last fool drove you crazy

[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I just bought five blunts, I'm 'bout to light another
After we get drunk, we kissin' on each other

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
How about you roll one and we get to know each other?
I've got you on one, you can come whenever
Say he don't fuck you right, you shittin' me?
He can never, what's the price, you shittin' me?
Gettin' out on your own, you shittin' me?
You can feel the night alone, you shittin' me?

[Verse 2: Bluntsmoker]
500 for the cheap date, shrimp with the strip steaks
And you curvin' no dude, boy, he a cheap skate
Yeah, I been the ball juice and I got the sauce
Girl, ignore the cost, my chain, you can floss
Wanna see you pullin' up with that big butt
Real classy chick, far from a slut
That's my speed, spend 100Gs
On a new V, is you shittin' me?

[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I just booked first class, just to change the weather
Fly out with strong grass, just to smoke whenever

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
How about you roll one and we get to know each other?
I've got you on one, you can come whenever
Say he don't fuck you right, you shittin' me?
He can never, what's the price, you shittin' me?
Gettin' out on your own, you shittin' me?
You can feel the night alone, you shittin' me?
