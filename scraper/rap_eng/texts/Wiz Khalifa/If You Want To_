[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Famous Dex]
You can jump off in my ride if you want to
I could hit you with this gas if you want to
But you can't be my main bitch, I don't want you
You can jump off in my ride if you want to
You can come back to my crib if you want to (yuh, Dexter)
I could hit you with this gas if you want to (woah)
But you can't be my main bitch, I don't want you (yeah, uh-what)

[Verse: Famous Dex]
You can jump off in this ride if you want to
You can't be my baby, nah, I don't want a boo
Riding in a foreign, yeah, I pass you
Lookin' at my pocket, got that money, and it's all blue
Coolin' with Taylor gang, that's the gang, hoe
Can't trust this bitch, she the same hoe
Diamonds shining like the rainbow
Run up on this, swear to god [?] same hoe

You can jump off in my ride if you want to (ooh, yeah, hah, yeah, Dexter)
I could hit you with this gas if you want to
But you can't be my main bitch, I don't want you
You can jump off in my ride if you want to
You can come back to my crib if you want to
I could hit you with this gas if you want to
But you can't be my main bitch, I don't want you
