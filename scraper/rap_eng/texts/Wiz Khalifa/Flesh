Lemme go and tell you girls what I’m talkin’ ‘bout
Fast life I really live, I don’t talk about it

Go crazy, grab ya hair, pull it out
Lemme go and tell you girls what I’m talkin’ ‘bout
Fast life I really live, I don’t talk about uh it
Pick ya favourite movie scene, we could live it out and um
Go crazy, grab ya hair, pull it out

[Verse 1: Neako]
Uh, yellow gold, that’s what them ho’s like

Couple homies rollin’ wit’ me, that’s on every flight
White paper, fire weed, call it cherry slice
New bitch, she Taylor made, World Gang reppin’

Whenever I’m feelin’ fly, call her bitch to her face

[Verse 3: Neako & Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, I got a MIA broad that be doin’ blow
She a redbone, in the newest clothes
She do that white girl, just to free her mind
Open up the sky, floatin’ on ‘em different highs
I be gone, I be trippin’
Chasin’ them purple dreams, I be gone on a mission, yeah
I got a girl in every state
When I hop out the plane call ‘em bitches to they face
Wizzle
Uh, and I can make time stop
Hit this once, I’ll make ya mind pop
I don’t ask why, I ask “why not?”
Drink some free liquor, bitch that’s a foul shot
You in the game, I’m in the sky box
White bitches run up on me sayin’ I rock
Future World
Yeah she here wit’ you now, but I turn her into my future girl

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Lemme go and tell you girls what I’m talkin’ ‘bout
Fast life I really live, I don’t talk about it
Pick ya favourite movie scene, we could live it out
Go crazy, grab ya hair, pull it out
Lemme go and tell you girls what I’m talkin’ ‘bout
Fast life I really live, I don’t talk about it
Pick ya favourite movie scene, we could live it out and um
Go crazy, grab ya hair, pull it out
