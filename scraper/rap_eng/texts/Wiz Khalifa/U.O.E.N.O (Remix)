[Intro: Future]
U.O.E.N.O it
Po high class niggas
This shit sound crazy
Fly shit only
You know what I’m sayin’?

[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Ay that monster truck, sit tall as fuck, it’s so big can’t even tow it
Don't like snakes keep my grass cut, so low can't even mow it
Sip Dom Peri', little high glow, no no we don’t do Moet
If it ain't P.J., no Rose from me hostess don’t even pour it
Specks on Tom Ford, button-down Michael Kors
Always on like the refrigerator, I’m plugged in, ho, you know it
A.P. and that Piguet, wear the Breitling when I’m bored
Got a Masterpiece and a 41-millimeter, and you ain’t even know it
Keep the .45 in my pocket: ain’t gon' show it 'til I have to pop it
Then you gone know it, damn who shot you, they don’t even know it
Hawks game fuckin' floor it, TV seat front row it
Rocko Da Don CEO it, ain’t gotta rap and you know it

[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
We've got a lot of Marijuana
If you see me you got a problem
Run up on me like you want it
Guaranteed we're gonna solve it
They'll be thinkin' someone shot him
Hit him with a bottle
I'mma let a nigga have it
Started from the bottom
Now my diamonds looking autumn
And police don't even caught him
It's a milli if you call him, presidential rollie
It's a ticket if you want it
And I'll show you lil' niggas you can get it if you want it
U-O-E-N-O...
That good weed you don't even blow
See I drank so much Bombay in here tonight, can't even drive
And that head feel so good to me that I can't even lie
See me all up on the curb, you think I'm drunk the way I'm swerving
See you ask how much it cost, you niggas got a lot of nerve
So much money
All the motherfuckin' bottles up in here I got nervous
Order more, car service - Phantom Rolls Royce curtains
Roll one more and that's curtains
Young Khalifa, that's curtains
In Taylor Gang we worship

[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

[Verse 3: Future]
I'm turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin', you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin', you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don't even know it

[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it
