[Intro]
Still smoking baby
It's the Cookout, right
And this is brought to you by the Liquor Store
Oh fo sho

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
I used to spread a wife with a bread like mayo
All man nobody had to say so
Hit my homie from LA after I hit my little bitch from the bay yo
So high have you ever seen stars?
Tell me baby have you ever seen mars?
She says she's going to eat me up, like what
Have you ever seen Jaws
Hit the switch now we riding on 3 wheels
I don't want you around for a cheap thrill
I'm rolling, you rolling, we sweating, no E pills
Old school, playing up in my ride
Oh, I told you, I'm trying to get up inside you

[Hook]
I heard you freaky baby, won't you get up in my ride and do what you like to?
Cause tonight it's going down, down, down, down, down
Make the phone callers and a couple friends yeah you can invite too
I'm with my nigga so it's going down, whoa

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Going in, going in, cover me cause I'm going in
If I put my game down flat then guaranteed that I'm gonna win
Roll 2 joints, you roll 2 joints and take 2 cups and hold them in
Take you up you never come
Then knock you down like bowling pins
Your mans a lame nigga, you should tell him not to worry about me instead of that that try to get his change bigger
Met the first night, fuck the first night tell em that's game nigga, game nigga...
Cars & jewelry insane nigga
[?] painkillers
I'm on her brain so much
That's the first that she gave me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
No sleep, that's the motto, drinking out that bottle
Copy cats, they just wanna follow
They bad bitches they just wanna swallow
Them bullets flying at you them those hollows
Got a bag of money ain't about a bitch
[?] we the taylor gang, is that your chick
She was backstage trying to get at the [?]
She a fan first but I tell you that
One night bet you won't get her back
Bet you won't get her back
One night bet you won't get her back

[Hook]
