Grow
Told y'all y'all was gonna bump my shit
Y'all didn't think the Burgh'd jump like this
Ask anyone one around me, say they want young Wiz
5 cigarillos, I'mma smoke my piff
Told y'all y'all was gonna bump my shit
Y'all didn't think the Burgh'd jump like this
Told y'all y'all was gonna bump my shit
Y'all didn't think the Burgh'd jump like this
Ask anyone one around me, say they want young Wiz
5 cigarillos, I'mma smoke my piff
I'mma get that money, homie
Fuck that bitch
Paid like lids
So they want my chips
I'm the boss like Tony
The tall young homie
And they heard the good news
So now the broads jump on me
Claimin that your hot boy, why don't y'all show me?
I'm the best in my city bitch, all y'all know it
You cats skip tracks and just slum talk on it
I walk Pittsburgh, diddy bop all on it
I'm high all day, I Ray and Patron it
A sit still bitch looking for the best kiss here
Face it, I'm in a situation like win-win
Nigga you a loser, that ain't what I'm used to
I'm kinda peaceful, but my guy here'll shoot ya
In the stud' latenight, rise with the roosters
That's what I call a grind lil trooper
Niggas thinking past tense - I am the future
Make a boss move, I got eyes for me junior
Hit a mold, in it with a hold like tune ya
Niggas think they nicer, 21 chew me up
Little do they know that I'm a pro, now I ruin ya
I ride two to ya, show ya how I do this
Straight cash while you niggas stay stash-clueless
In the line, I switch the lane and pass through ya
Life bout to change, need a new chain from my jeweler
And my age it'll fool ya
I do it big but truth is I just made it outta school bruh
And my flow is peculiar
I rep Pittsburgh to the death
Hatin nigga, kill yourself

[Outro]
So go on kill yourself you bitchass nigga
