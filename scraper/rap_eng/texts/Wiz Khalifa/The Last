[Intro]
Y’ll already know what it is
We the last…

[Verse 1]
At night that’s when all the lights shine
Ask the stewardess what’s the flight time
Know we grown we all got shit to say
But we drunk so it’s the right time
Outer Space they got a high climb
Out of sight, I’m out of my mind
I did everything on my own, so
I could give a fuck how your advice sound
Who you know sick as Ca-P though
Flow tight as the clothes on the niggas who fight crime
It’s cool to dream I suppose, you never know how far it might go
You might need some love, it might get shown
You might stumble down the right road
Got problems with the structure? Time to renovate
Boy tighten up your circle, keep your business straight

[Chorus]
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'

[Verse 2]
We the niggas who could have it all
We the ones who only dream of it then do it on our own
Smoking one and got another roll
Came a long way from no direction now to formation
More legit, more to make, more to spend
Got a thing for champagne? Order it
Waking up in my trap house burning hella spliffs, grinding
Listening to Dolomite rhyming, I’m in
Exclusive bay, break you off something and I’ve got moves to make
Don’t be acting bougie ‘cause you came through with Nate
No Reuss, real nigga before Protools
Got game from niggas that's from the old school
But we them new niggas,  you should roll through
Woke up in the morning fucked up but that’s part of it
I got weed smoke and all this gin, Khalifa always wins

[Chorus]
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
