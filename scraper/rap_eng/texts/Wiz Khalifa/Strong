[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Real cuz
Berner I see you
Small world man
Nigga' got big money thought
Shit ain't gon' change either

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm always smoking that strong (smoking that strong)
I'm always stuffin' the bong (stuffin' the bong)
And all my niggas' got gangsta' written all over them
(gangsta' written all over them, uh)
Make sure you pop that champagne
It's enough for all of them
(It's enough for all of them, uh)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I pull up my garage slow, puffin' on the cone
Shiftin' gear and let my tires smoke
The bong weed got my eyes low, but I'm focused
I can see ya hater comin' but I'd rather get this money
Seein' niggas' tryin' take my whole swag and acknowledge it
That Porsche 911 is the reason I'm talking shit
I see you buying gold, it ain't the proper kt
Was that all about, fake cross, fake dimonds fallin' out
Hit the club, I'm ballin' out

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And I just took three shots of gin
(and I just took three shots of gin)
And rolled six joints for my niggas'
(and rolled six joints for my niggas')
And I'mma need somebody else to drive my car
(and I'mma need somebody else to drive my car)
Rep the game cause they know that we the illest
Plus my clique full of certified winners

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: B-Real]
I wake up every morning
And I bake up every morning
And we cake up in the evening
Get it blazin' without warnin'
Everywhere I've been performing
They got flowers and we burnin'
You can smell me when I'm coming
You ain't know well now you learnin'
And if you takin' shit for granted
Make no mistake you'll be stranded
No strong and empty handed
We got the best on the planet
Catch a spark, and there you have it
When it's dark just fuckin' light it
It's the way that we provide it
We roll the Cookies and the Paris
And the Jet, you look embarrassed
And we smokin' like we careless
We be smokin' on the rarest Marijuana [?]
See this rookies couldn't bear it
Fuck around and get embarrassed
I came with Berner and Khalifa
You know we the biggest cheefas
Shout to Snoop cause he's a Beaver
I came with Berner and Khalifa
You know we the biggest cheefas
Shout to Snoop cause he's a Beaver
We the kings about that reefer

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 3: Berner]
The kinda shit I'm on will make you yearn
I'm only smokin' strong, a few Xanax, Don Perignon
City to city, we said our smoke is long
Pull up in our foreign cars
It's been a hot minute since I wrote to God
Let that clear burn slow, all on my Raw
Pulled another fifty pounds down, he gon' want 'em all
Of course I'm gon' stunt, I'm young, rich and dumb
I got swimmers lungs, you hit this shit once and you're done
In the session burn tough, hold it if you can
I'm in Japan smoking Kush outta soda cans
Worldwide man, just high as like a roller coaster
Wax got your heart beatin' fast, it's almost over
Weed game veterans, high grade medicine
No fingerprints, we don't leave no evidence
Don't hesitate to celebrate, roll another one
We gon' stay smoked out and let the money come

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
