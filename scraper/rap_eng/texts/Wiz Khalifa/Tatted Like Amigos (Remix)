[Intro: Kap G]
Shouts out to College Park
Those folks get at your neck
Mi amigo is the connect, Comcast internet
Yeah they got that work, straight from Mexico
So get your sharp and call ready just like radio

[Hook: Kap G]
Okay qué pasa mami, hit a cart-wheel
She like the way I sling that D, no cartel
Okay qué pasa holmes
And you don’t want problemas
And we about a hundred deep, all my niggas all my niggas
Tatted like some migos, es amigos
All my niggas
All my niggas
Tatted like some migos

[Verse 1: Kap G]
Tell me what's you on? my fam ain't gotta mow the lawn
Got a yellow bone from Mexico, don't eat pussy on Ramadan
Got your mamacita in the kitchen whippin' up chorizo
Kickin' bitches like immigration did my cousin Beto
I got strong blunts, I'm lifting weights
I dont rock fake J's, dont hit me with no ticks
I just want the forehead
Honda Accord yeha we pack deep no ID
These bitches love me like I'm Jodeci

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Who spends thousands on ink?
Got my first lead when I was nineteen homie
What you think?
Look at my face, think I need a shrink
No shirt I covered everything, tatted where I blink
Twisted stink, you talkin' to a real stoner
And a new crib owner
Smoking weed gettin' tatted, while I do a quick phone her
Thats your girlfriend homie, thats cool I dont want her
She with us getting ratchet, she came back to you tatted
Like hola, the weed I'm smoking so loud, we can't turn it down
Niggas ain't finishing what they starting, that's for certain
Everything you see I been had it
Ain't nothin new to me, I been tatted
Like amigo, you baby joker
Big lungs you a baby smoker
Rollin' up like a train, Taylor Gang take your lady poke her
Everything the same since I can't except my change
They don' came up my diamonds then Merenge

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
Keep a couple killers round me
And you know I keep a couple bitches around me
And you know my bitches they stay tatted like amigos
My bitches stay quiet, don't say shit I call it B-Roll
Ride for my niggas, I die for my niggas
I got Pimp C on my sleeve
H-town nigga got DJ Screw big more all on me
These tattoos on my neck they bitches leak
And I sip some much damn drink, I got that shit tatted on me
But tell your girl to keep your legs closed
That pussy good man I hit it with a for
Say man I eat that with promethozyne
I’m tatted and my ass ain't right with me

[Hook]
