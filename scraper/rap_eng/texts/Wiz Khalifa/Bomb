Something like a pimp, nothing like them other fellas

We should go back to my crib, that's what I’mma tell her
Bring one or two of them cause your friends looking kinda jealous
Rolling papers like propellers, blowing mozzarella
Lotta niggas in the club, who cares? I’m the realest
Tell the waitress, uh, we gon' need more cases
And when you think the money’s gone, I'm spending more faces
She with homeboy, but she want this
6 cars, 8 chains, 3 cribs, 1 Wiz

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty thick in her hips, cold than a mother
Licking her lips, a bad mothersucker
Apple looking so ripe, she make me want a piece
I give it to her all night, so she don’t wanna leave

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If you got that bomb-bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bomb-bomb

And there's so much ice up on my neck, it look like I play hockey

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty thick in her hips, cold than a mother
Licking her lips, a bad mothersucker
Apple looking so right, she make me want a piece
I give it to her all night, so she don’t wanna leave

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If you got that bomb-bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bomb-bomb
