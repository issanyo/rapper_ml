[Hook: Problem & Wiz Khalifa]
What? Yeah..haha..
Worried bout a hater? Not me
Turnt to the max, no sleep
Smoke a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Rollin', pockets swollen
Ridin' in it, like its stolen
Weeded, hella conceited
If it ain't about money nigga I don't need it
Got a hundred grand in my ashtray
Spend a hundred k on a bad day
And I'm tatted like a cholo
Nigga act crazy my dogs go loco
Kush got me movin' slo-mo
With my nigga problem that's my bro-bro
Came in through the back door
Ten mill this year on the low-low
And I'm still smokin' pre-rolleds
Cristal, done fucking with the clicquot
And my bank full of zeros
Young wizzle get fly like a hero

[Hook: Problem & Wiz Khalifa]
What? Yeah..haha..
Worried bout a hater? Not me
Turnt to the max, no sleep
Smoke a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me

[Verse 2: Problem]
Rollin' through with them hoes like a donut
Sold more weed than you g's ever smoked up
Dick make her choke up, like a real ?
Got me feeling like a mill, off a pill door locked
We ain't lettin' all no more bros in
But fo' sho' we'll let y'all hoes in
Cause when we pullin' money out they be lovin' it
Give her dick 'fore I give a bitch my government
That's eight, I got eight more
Super duper high, eighty-eighth floor
Unzip this, that's eight more
Fuck a pussy and fuck rhyming
We gon' live forever, fuck dying
Get it 'til I drop, fuck tryin'
Pedal to the metal, we flyin'
In the fast lane, yellin' diamond

[Hook: Problem & Wiz Khalifa]
What? Yeah..haha..
Worried bout a hater? Not me
Turnt to the max, no sleep
Smoke a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Everything about me
Young wild nigga, mouth full of gold teeth
Treatin' bape.com like a swap meet
Going crazy on a bitch until she knock-kneed
I'm in a hella fast whip going top speed
Make a mess in that pussy and then she mop clean
I drop racks and she drops jeans
Smoke green as I lean, top dropping
Nigga I am all about a buck falling out a truck
Prolly with some hoes that I just met and yeah, they all gon' fuck
Got her man callin' up her homies, blowin' all em up
Trying to figure out where his girl is, she probably toasted
Like a champagne glass
So much money that ain't a damn thing sad
Do my damn thing in my campaign add
Let's get straight to it, don't let a damn thing pass
Nigga what?

[Hook: Problem & Wiz Khalifa]

Everything about me (bout me)
