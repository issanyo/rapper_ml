Pittsburgh in this bitch

[Verse 1]
I met you through your best friend
I was on the road
And you said I sang all your favorite songs
My room was at the Westin
The drive was even close
Be there soon as you drop Latisha off
I'll be waiting on the next plane
I'll be waitin' on you, Let's plan
This one night special for you
I'mma make it worth it baby
I'll do something extra for you

[Verse 2]
And you ain't gotta do it back
That's a gift, a present
You made this trip excellent
Best it could have ever went
Wrestling, lettin' all your worries go
Feel like you'll never stress again
Hopefully one day there can be an us again
Us again, us again
But if not, fuck it then
Nah I'm playin', you my dying wish bucket list
Thinkin' 'bout you any time I'm with my other bitch
This OT fling, my out of town girl
We don't need roads, we in our own world

I know they gonna feel me on this one
Yeah, bitch
Come fly with the planes
Captain of the spaceship
Taylor Gang, champagne, Lamborghini wangs
