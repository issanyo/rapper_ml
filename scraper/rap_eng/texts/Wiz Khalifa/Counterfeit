[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Swear it isn't real, I like the way it looks but I hate the way it feels, oh
I know what it is, I've seen this before, got caught for a million
I know that I'm nervous, cause it really ain't a thing natural about it
Water into wine please, she seem like a miracle, I know that's impossible

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You don't wanna love maybe nah
Baby you gon' give me everything you got
Damn right, say you love me
Why you in my bed turning over like the greys of the ones before you, 'fore ya?

[Chorus: Rihanna & Chris Brown]
I keep looking for love
Can't find it in a party, in a whole room full of bodies
I keep looking for love
Dying over diamonds, counterfeit designing
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoes

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Alright this is some old movie shit, everything fake like a movie script
Everything I got public so, you already know how the groupies get
Pulled up in the fakest city, with the Lambo sittin' and my Rambo with me
Plus I got a bitch so bad, with rep so cold, big ass, big titties
Stuck in a fairy tale lifestyle, Snow White rollin' with gold diggers
Nigga say how much for that one? Shit I ain't even know she was a hoe nigga
I meet these hoes everyday, try to turn love like every way
Hundred dollars bills run the color of red, so I'm countin' my dough in a private place, yikes

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You don't wanna love maybe nah
Baby you gon' give me everything you got
Damn right, say you love me
Why you in my bed turning over like the greys of the ones before you, 'fore ya?

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Chris Brown]
I keep looking for love
Can't find it in a party, in a whole room full of bodies
I keep looking for love
Dying over diamonds, counterfeit designing
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoes

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, hold up wait, shoulda been on time but you showed up late
Had a little feelin' but it's gonna wait, gave you a piece, you want a whole damn plate
Wanna play, wanna ball, wanna have your cake and eat it all
Now I gotta new one outta state, so them ratchets gonna hate
But they hated Jesus man, runnin' around sayin' you don't need a man
You know you gon' miss them private flights, everything high with Young Khalifa man
Everything paid for, it's taken its course
So much back and forth, that's a everyday thing now, woo
So I'm skatin', headin' straight for your replacement
Cause your story I couldn't take it, it had holes in it like Jason
But I stuck around and stayed patient, momma called me up basin'
Father called me up pacin', all your friends were all basic
Now I see right through you, woulda thought a nigga had LASIK
Extra cash, spent that so my car look like a spaceship
Wanna leave me that's cool, I was thinkin' 'bout leaving you
Walked out the door like poof, made it look like the thing to do

[Chorus: Rihanna & Chris Brown]
I keep looking for love
Can't find it in a party, in a whole room full of bodies
I keep looking for love
Dying over diamonds, counterfeit designing
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoes
