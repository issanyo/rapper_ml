This the top?
Oh yeah, the tippy
It’s young Khalifa, man
Yeah
I see it clearly, the money that is
Oh, ya’ll niggas ain’t in the way
Keep doing what you doing
See right through you, yeah

Right hit me first
Hit the check, run your bands up
Run through flipping ounces, smoke up in your room, this is so fun
Home base runnin', kill features it's spectacular
Wizard shit, I'm on my Diddy shit, Cent 50 shit
I scent 50's when I'm with my bitch
Kill haters, making paper, rich
I'm in my own world
Own worlds
I got my own girl, smoke purrp
I woke first, ya'll came late
I won't waste it, ya'll just wait

I never sleep, but I got big dreams
A little nigga, I do big things
You know it’s everything that it seems
They say my life is like the big screen
Big screen
I fill my bank with every 16
My money straight and my bitch mean
You should wait and get a ticket please
They say my life’s like the big screen
Big screen

I feel like a desperado
On the track I just kick it like Rallo
See me on the TV
Yeah, I be in grind mode
But please believe
I’m in the streets like potholes
Antonio, no guitar though
Only instrumental is that pistol
Need a right hand so I fucks with Chevy
And underneath the wing so I hustle heavy
Tatted on my face, chest, neck, hands, stomach
Been on a paper chase since that cake start runnin’
Never touched a brick, I ain’t never slung a drug
Still get a feeling when I see that gold car comin’
Got my pops old soul, I’m a 80’s baby
Moms smoke hella weed, I’m a wavy baby
You mister me too and you need fuel, man
You niggas see through, air

I never sleep, but I got big dreams
A little nigga, I do big things
You know it’s everything that it seems
They say my life is like the big screen
Big screen
I fill my bank with every 16
My money straight and my bitch mean
You should wait and get a ticket please
They say my life’s like the big screen
Big screen
