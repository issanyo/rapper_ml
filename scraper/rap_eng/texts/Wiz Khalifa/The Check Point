[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
And we living material, as long as the money straight they wanna see me fall
But I got a crib that's over looking the city though
And a lot of bitches who wanna get in our videos
Ten to twelve hour long trips, bong rips
I ain't interested in what you selling I run my own shit
Made it through a long list, did my all
Some will talk slick, but no contest, I'm best dressed
That's why the bitches love me
She leaving you to come where the liquor and drugs be
I'm glass floor now you passport and over seas we watching the sunrise
Smoke a joint out on the beach
Write my name in the sand, I
Never been a nigga who had a lucky nothin' you can say everything I planned out
Now I stand out
I fell asleep on the plane and woke up to people screaming my name!

[Hook]
No matter which way I go, they tell me don't take that road
But I never put my foot on the brake oh no
I never put my foot on the break oh no, ah no oh
I don' think it's wrong (Jets)
Doing a hundred but they tell me to take it slow (Nigga)
But I never put my foot on the break oh no (It's the Planes and the Taylor Gang)
I never put my foot on the break oh no, ah no oh (Got your bitches slipping off their wedding rings)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Livin' the life is just me
Some bitches my niggas in a crib full of vices
But I don't do drugs, just weed
Caution flags wave, and fuck it I still speed
And proceed to give them what they waiting for
Daytona 500 guess who lighting joints up in the pace car
Play hard, but I work way harder to afford
Boats, put your women on the water let 'em boogie board
Slightly older still, sexy broad, thank Demi Moore
Just strip for me without the tease, give me more
Still rockin' Golden Eye on the Nintendo 64
Sayin they don't make 'em like this anymore
Same goes for my whip, same goes for my kicks, rare
And I don't rush to the store, they save me a pair
Yeah, a nigga living in the air
Spending more time in the clouds then I spend on the ground
Do the opposite, fuck taking advice from these clowns
Thats why I mash the gas when they tell me slow down
Yeah!

[Hook]
