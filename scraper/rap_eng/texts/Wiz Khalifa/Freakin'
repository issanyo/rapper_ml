[Verse 1: Lyrica Anderson]
Set the mood just right, candles all ready, yeah
Been needin’ this all night, feels like I’m in heaven
I’m not in the mood for talkin’, I’m not in the mood for playin’
I’m just in the mood for loving on you, on you
Give it to me, I can take it, don’t know why I’m so impatient
Alright, I want

[Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
You freakin’ on me, me freakin’ on you
Tell me what it’s gonna be-e-e-e

You freakin’ on me, me freakin’ on you
Tell me what it’s gonna be-e-e-e
Cause I know you want it, I know you want it
I know you want it, I know you want it
