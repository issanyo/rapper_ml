[Intro]
We still at it mane
Ain't never lost a step
Take some of the low end out of my voice
Put some delay on there

[Verse 1]
Make your money don't let it make you
I learned that if you work hard it's funny where it'll take you
Probably roll you one up and bake you
I'm constantly on my job to see what's on my plate
Did it all without getting thank you I'm holding rank, rollin' dank
Porsche Carrera, 9 11, rollerskatin' see the city through my drapes
So what a tape
Smoke good weed to compliment my brain, ripped jeans to compliment my J's
I grind weed to put it in a j, on magazines and that center stage
What you make in a year I'm get in a day
Drink my fears away, work hard so I blew all my peers away
I'm smokin' strong to clear my brain, thankin' god I'm here today
Just long as my niggas safe, and all of my business straight
I'ma be able to move, cop some land and renovate
Plus I'm about to have a son, so I have to demonstrate
How to always stay real when the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

[Hook]
When the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Cause it ain't 'bout having a lot, it's 'bout you having some
Cause you could have it all but you still feel like you got none
When the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

[Verse 2]
When the world giving you fake it ain't hard to stay real
Niggas say they gon' run up on you believe they will
I'm from Pittsburgh where they kill and they deal
Young niggas itchin' to pop a nigga like a pain pill
Don't even mention the homicide outside it's way real
Some of my niggas is dead, in jail, or tryna' make bail
Young nigga listen told him stay out the streets he chill
Got a little older keep saying he won't, he will
Got shot a lil' bit ago now it's poppin' when I see him I just talk to him
Roll some weed up tell him 'bout shit that he don't wanna be
What can happen to the act if he don't wanna clean
The life he live the consequences he don't wanna see
The game's over, rich icon, chain smoker
The watch face cold, like it was playin' poker
Pot grower, party not-goer
Always not sober, shades on my face when the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

[Hook]
When the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Cause it ain't 'bout having a lot, it's 'bout you having some
Cause you could have it all but feel like you got none
When the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

[Outro]
Ya man
There's a lot of fake shit that the world got to offer
Fake niggas, fake jewerly, fake weed, fake friends
Fake cars, fake clothes
Don't buy into the bullshit
Tell yourself first
MonstaBeatz, Taylor Gang, you know what it is
