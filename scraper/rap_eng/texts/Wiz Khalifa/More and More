[Intro]
Yeah
Got one rolled
Come light that shit up
We ain't playin' no games
Everybody I know smoke
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep clouds of smoke

[Verse 1]
Keep one of them J's rolled
Keep both of my eyes closed
Keep all of them ashtrays close
If you gonna ride on this plane with me
Need a light and that's it
When I roll, you match it
Hit it twice and pass it
If you wanna ride on this plane with me

[Pre-Hook]
Wake up in the mornin' in that California Roll
Smokin' Khalifa Kush like I got it from the store
Used to share with my friends, but I'm smokin' to the face
Hand me a filter, I'm 'bout to roll up in this place

[Hook]
I wish it was legal to get high
I wish it was legal to get high
We rollin' and rollin', rollin'
We smokin' and smokin', smokin'
We blowin' on more and more, oh
I wish it was legal to get high

[Verse 2]
Gotta keep your own bud
Say you usually don't but now you wanna get chiefed and roll up
Well you wanna come get high with me
Smoke it all, don't save none
Hope the law don't say nun'
If you got one, blaze one
Everybody gettin' high with me

[Pre-Hook]
Wake up in the mornin' in that California Roll
Smokin' Khalifa Kush like I got it from the store
Used to share with my friends, but I'm smokin' to the face
Hand me a filter, I'm 'bout to roll up in this place

[Hook]
I wish it was legal to get high
I wish it was legal to get high
We rollin' and rollin', rollin'
We smokin' and smokin', smokin'
We blowin' on more and more, oh
I wish it was legal to get high
