[Hook] 1x
Everyday I ball what about you
I ain't gonna front why they full of tattoos

[intro: Wiz Khalifa]
I'll never get any tattoos removed
I'll be getting more tattoos
I'll get tattoos on top of tattoos when I can

[Hook] 4x
Everyday I ball what about you
I ain't gonna front why they full of tattoos

[Verse 1: The Game]
Who is it the gun spitter young home run hitter
More wet super hit you with the flow like biggie
King of this rap shit, out the park like briffy
I met my guns out of the park come get me
But desert eagles make a nigga move like missy
Im always in the bentley how the fuck could you miss me
Im always on the charts I know why you niggas diss me
Cause black wall street getting deeper than the sixties
Them boys in the hood will lay you down like whippy, so run
Catch them hollow tips like a frisbee
I pitch coke cans like franks lucas, niggas talk that american gangsta shit they can't do it
I put these wack rap niggas on the scope and blou
Cause i promised the homie kim i would hold his brother down
Im more focused now, Im like the golden chow
Put both of your hands out I'll let you hold my style, motherfucker

[Hook] 4x
Everyday I ball what about you
I ain't gonna front when they full of tattoos

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And my down south girl
Do da stanky leg
A nigga at the store look like he makin eggs
I Got a whole loaf so I be breakin' bread
And gettin' so ill the doctor got me takin meds
Kush I feast
I drink till I think I'm 'bout to throw up
Then the nurse bring another bottle to pour up
Told me I'm livin' fast but how do you slow up
When you never learn to use brakes
Hold up
Everyday I'm in a new state, and niggas hate but I can turn that beef to cube steak
Get a huge plate
Sit 'em down at the table and say grace
And stuff my face
