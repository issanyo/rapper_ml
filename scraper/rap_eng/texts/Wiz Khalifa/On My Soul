[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
On my soul (on my soul)
I'm gonna let 'em go (let 'em go)
Ride for my niggas that's soul (that's soul)
On my soul (on my soul)
I'm gonna keep one rolled (keep one rolled)
On my soul (on my soul), On my soul (on my soul)
I'm down to let 'em go (let 'em go)
Ride for my niggas that's soul (that's soul)
On my soul (on my soul)
I'm gonna keep one rolled (keep one rolled)
On my soul (on my soul)

[Verse 1: Jiggy]
On my soul
On my soul, I was broke and I was fuckin' bitches
It's time to get this money, count these fuckin' digits
On my soul, them my niggas, y'all ain't fuckin' wit us
I come from a place, guns get to bustin' nigga
Bullets get to flyin', better get to duckin'
If you come, if you comin'
Best believe we gon' come wit repercussions
Max out like a snare drum, percussions
Ain't no more fair ones, they dumpin'
Out in L.A. smokin' tree up in the trap
Most niggas won't never understand that
Just talked to ____, call my nigga ____ back
Smoke up in my chest, call it on my soul pack

[Hook]
On my soul (on my soul)
I'm gonna let 'em go (let 'em go)
Ride for my niggas that's soul (that's soul)
On my soul (on my soul)
I'm gonna keep one rolled (keep one rolled)
On my soul (on my soul), On my soul (on my soul)
I'm down to let 'em go (let 'em go)
Ride for my niggas that's soul (that's soul)
On my soul (on my soul)
I'm gonna keep one rolled (keep one rolled)
On my soul (on my soul)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Wait, homie I been rich
I got money in the wall, money in the ceilin'
Niggas sweeter than a shot of fuckin' penicillin
I got ice on but a nigga never chillin'
You can smell the loud when I walk in the buildin'
Ever did it on your own then you know the feelin'
I got a bitch wit me, she got some friends wit her
They all sticcin' to the plan, they know they pole positions
Smokin' on that potent shit
Don't care who got it locked I come and open it
She let me put my dick in her Fallopian
I'm deadly like a scorpion
Don't ask what kind of car we in
If you forget it ain't important then
I got bitches on the west coast
I got bitches on the east coast too
I got alcohol and weed smoke too
Y'all gon' make me go in beast mode
Heatin' up my plate cause I gotta eat mo'
Fuckin' on the bed, what I gotta sleep fo'
Gettin' to the checks, findin' zeros
Real good connect, blow by the O
Give me good neck, top me so slow
Don't give me brains, she gotta go
Just for this dick, drive in the snow
That's on my soul, that's on my, that's on my

[Hook]
On my soul (on my soul)
I'm gonna let 'em go (let 'em go)
Ride for my niggas that's soul (that's soul)
On my soul (on my soul)
I'm gonna keep one rolled (keep one rolled)
On my soul (on my soul), On my soul (on my soul)
I'm down to let 'em go (let 'em go)
