[Hook]
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeaaaahh bitch
You know what it is
It's Wizzle man
Taylor Gang or die
Heavy Hustle in this bitch
Yea, hahaha
Yup, yea

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
The way lil shorty go
I'm tryna think where I should take her
Watch her hit tha flo'
I'm out here spending all this paper
Bustin' cigarillos down
I blow it by the acre
If you lookin' this good
Well shit I wanna meet your maker
Take her
To my home
Say hello to my neighbors
She my biggest fan
I see her man just tryna save her
Put it in her mouth
And now my taste she's tryna savor
Shorty saying Khalifa Man
Should have his own flavor
Haters wanna be me
But can't walk in my Chuck Taylor's
All black eleven's
Mac-11 with the laser
Mami keep on shaking it
Like she a salt shaker
Hand on the ground
Everybody around

[Hook]
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hey
A lot of niggas hate
But all the bitches wanna do me
Wizzle L. Jackson
Yeah my life is like a movie
Heavy Hustle Gang
Swisher Sweets with the jacuzzi
Probably fucked your girl
You don't like it, nigga sue me
Shawty from the hood
But in the club she actin' bougie
Body like a centerfold
Boy look at that loody
My ink got her gone
Wanting to know who tattoos me
Head game righteous
Said she'd like to ride, yeah
DJ play my song
When it come on she get excited
Before I leave the club
I put her number in my Sidekick
Swagger on some different shit
She tell me that she like it
Watch her break it down
I ain't playin' around

[Hook]
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'
