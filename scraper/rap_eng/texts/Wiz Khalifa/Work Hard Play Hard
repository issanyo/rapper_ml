Okey I make a hit and am gone playa
I make a point and am gone playa
Am sitting in my throne playa
Am chilling on my own playa
So fresh so clean
HB's in the zone playa

I rap better
I move better
My swag's better
My flow's better

I Work hard but I party harder
Life is hard but I was born harder

They hate it, I love it
I stand above it
I rise above it
Put my heart in it
Put my swag in it
If you're girl is in it
I put my dick in it

My watch is shining cuz my time is dear
Party every night like it's new Year
Am in the club But you're nowhere near
I ain't white am Crystal clear

You talk like you know me
You act like you know me
That's wrong if you ask me

[Hook]

Okey
I am 22 and every 2 is for victory
2 times the swag 2 times the flow
I work at your moms down low

The H is for huge and the B is for a bunch of shit

If you guessed balls my negga jackpot
If work a lot
I play I lot
I smoke a lot
I get paid a lot
If you need rhymes I Get laid a lot

I touch the sealing you stay low
You can't go wherever I go
You don't know whatever I know
You're too slow

[Hook]
