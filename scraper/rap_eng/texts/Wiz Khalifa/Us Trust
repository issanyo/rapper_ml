[Verse 1: Charlie Wilson]
My main [?], how you doin'? where you goin'?
Baby where's your rush, can I take it?
A little moment of your time [?]
Couldn't meet you mind, you were hurt yeah
The tears in your eyes, to my surprise ain't got a word to say
Then she walked away, I didn't give a name

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ah, please I was done comparin'
Baby I need your name
'Cause I won't be home without you dear
Baby it's cold in here
You just know you can complete me there
All right with a bigger feast
By now, by now

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
By now, by now

[Verse 2: Charlie Wilson]
Now I'm all up in love, tryna find the one that I let slip away
Remember that face, for seven age
I know you're my second grade
I could fly with your love, never give it up
But I've never seen you're face
Since she walked my way
Still I got her name

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ah, please I was done comparin'
Baby I need your name
'Cause I won't be home without you dear
Baby it's cold in here
You just know you can complete me there
All right with a bigger feast
By now, by now

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
By now, by now

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
We been goin' like this for a long time
And now we're hopin' that things don't change
'Cause I got your back, and you got mine
And I know when love will stay the same
You can supreme and I'll tell you you're my favorite girl
Hold me down and you'll never let me go
And I already know, and I already know
'Cause now I diamonds in my chain
Cups full of champagne
Trees in my plane and they all know my name
Nothing like em layers, flying to the west coast
You didn't even smoke, now you're blowing on the best dough
How many times we gotta try?
You're feeling for best now, I'm the reason why
Not feeling distressed I got a multitrack mind
So we make a toast and blow the planes up high, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ah, please I was done comparin'
Baby I need your name
'Cause I won't be home without you dear
Baby it's cold in here
You just know you can complete me there
All right with a bigger feast
By now, by now

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
By now, by now
