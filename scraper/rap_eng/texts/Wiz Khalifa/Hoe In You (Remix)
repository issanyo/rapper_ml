[Hook]
Your bitch all on my phone cause she know you lame
All y'all rocking leather suede, y'all all the same
Know I go to [?] get designer frames
And I can't fuck with you cause I can see the ho in you
Oh I can see the ho in you

[Verse 1 - Royce Rizzy]
This the remix, I’m just doing what I’m supposed to do
And y’all be sleeping on the kid and I be showing you
Cartiers on so I can see the ho in you
And why your bitch suck me off if she in love with you
Can’t trust no nigga, can’t trust no ho
And I smell like money, so that bitch gone go
Fuck her, then I leave her, she get mad after
Khalifa Kush is in the bong and then I dab after
And I ball like Vince Carter, I should be a Raptor
She said hit it from the back and make my ass fatter
I’m making millions [?] and they can’t take it from me
I see the ho in these niggas and they ain’t getting money

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Iamsu!]
X ray vision, I’m looking straight through you
Do a whole lot of talking, but still can’t prove it
And you could buy every single car off the lot
And it still won’t make up for everything that you not
I see the ho in you, yeah ain’t no way around it
And ain’t no way to hide it, nigga come up out the closet
Got your main bitch shaking from it
She said that dick so good she want to take it from me
Damn, damn, these hoes only showing off for Instagram
Real niggas, we bout stacking up them Benjamins
Young Suzy, Rizzy, and Khalifa man
Hit the gmail, you’re looking for the fiction man

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Curtis Williams]
Got it by myself, boy I ain’t need no help
[?] denim with the [?] belt
Cobblestones got this printer surfing
Know these niggas mad that this nigga working
But they bitch all on my line cause they know she lame
Boy I’m a real nigga, we are not the same
She sniffing the plate, I’m rolling the blunt, my niggas is straight
I been getting paid, booked up for these shows, you niggas is late
I see the ho in all you fake niggas
Had to keep my grass cut cause all you snake niggas
I’m rolling weed while I’m smoking weed
Ask about em, bet they know it’s me

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Wiz Khalifa]
I'm a young rich nigga, rocking my white tee and furs
To keep it real and make a billion, I might be the first
These haters just hating to hate, they just like being heard
But I ain't gonna lie to 'em
Just bought a new watch but I ain't got no time for em
Stacking up all this change, stacking up all this change
So many niggas in the way, can't enjoy the game
So many pounds coming in, neighbors going berserk
So many choppers in my crib, don't make 'em go to work
That's all day, I fuck three the hard way
They fuck with me the long way
Wiz the man, shorty put me dead inside her dinner plans
Damn, ain't no sense in getting sentimental
She was gone soon as they sent the menu

[Hook]
