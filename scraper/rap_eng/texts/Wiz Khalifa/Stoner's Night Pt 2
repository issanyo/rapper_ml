[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Hold up, mane
Hold up, mane
Juicy J from Taylor Gang
Rollin’ Phantom, rollin’ dank
Green cologne, I know it stank
Light it up, and hold a drank
Hit the club, blowin’ bank
Say you is, but I know you ain’t
Getting money? No you ain’t
Rollin’ Cali green in a Zig-Zag paper
Smokin’ on the back porch, who the damn neighbors? (Kobe)
Lookin’ for a chick who just wanna have fun
Let her hit the joint and put love on her tongue
Inhale, exhale
Go to jail, I’m postin’ bail
Blue Dream, I know it well
So much green, I’m growin’ sails
Ounces on ounces, my connect, he got the deal
And he give me nothing but the illest
Stoner’s night for real

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Young Wiz, people call me Young Wiz
Roll up 20 Zig-Zags outta one zip
Nigga smoke Zags over blunts
Bet a blunt smoker smell what’s in my bag, he gon want a hit
Since a young nigga, I was gettin’ lit
Ridin’ in my black Bonneville bumpin’ Three Six
Servin' no seeds, nigga, no sticks
Used to be the one rollin’ weed for my whole clique
Now I’m buyin’ weed on some grown shit
When I say grown, I’m talkin’ bout the man who grows it
Lookin’ at my ring, look like I froze it
I’m smokin’ good in here so everybody knows it

[Hook]
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I’m ridin’ with my top back, my bitch drunk, I’m smokin’ weed
I don’t know if they fo’ real, but she got double D’s
Hand me two cups, you’ve gotta double these
I don’t put it on if it ain’t double G
In the Rolls Royce chiefin’ on the Trippy Stick
I’m about to transform, take her home and give her dick
Trippy, trippy mane; I'm a specialist
If I let you hit the vape then you a special chick
Kief in the joint - I’ve been savin’ up
I’m about to buy a jet - I’ve been savin’ up
All the money I’ve been touchin’ I’m gettin’ paper cuts
Ever since I put the blunts down I’ve been papered up

[Hook]
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke
