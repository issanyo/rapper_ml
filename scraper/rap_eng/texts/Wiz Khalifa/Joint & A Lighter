[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Well you know baby, it seems like things will never change
They still hate the player, and never hate the game

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
You set my soul, on fire
We go together like a joint & a lighter
You get me so, inspired
I think I’m falling for you girl and I like it

[Chevy Woods & Wiz Khalifa]
Roll one (roll one)
Smoke one (smoke one)
I won’t tell (I won’t tell)
No one (no one)

And I know you won’t either (either)
But mama you a keeper (keeper)
You be on call every time a nigga need ya (need ya)
Ya know I get excited every time I get excited (excited)
Front backside till you say you wanna ride it (ride it)

[Wiz Khalifa & Chevy Woods]
Uh, like one two, one two
Everything will be the same when Khalifa come through(oh my soul)
You a freak? Me too
And we keep it on the low, they don’t know what we do(fire)
Let em talk that’s cool
Ima put you in the car and Ima drop that roof(oh my soul)
They try to copy our moves, but everytime you get around me girl you know that..

[Chevy Woods & Wiz Khalifa]
You set my soul, on fire
We go together like a joint & a lighter
You get me so, inspired
I think I’m falling for you girl and I like it

Roll one (roll one)
Smoke one (smoke one)
I won’t tell (I won’t tell)
No one (no one)

[Chevy Woods]
Put it all on the line
Girl I don’t wanna waste your time
Let me ease my mind
Girl I just rolled a joint you can light

[Wiz Khalifa & Chevy Woods]
Uh, like one two, one two
Please don’t bring your girlfriend when you come through (oh my soul)
You know how we do
I’m with Chev, if you bad you can meet the crew( fire)
Like one two, one two
If ya girl smoke weed, they can roll one too (oh my soul)
When I don’t see you baby, I be mad as hell
Roll with a G, girl you might as well

[Chevy Woods]
You set my soul, on fire
We go together like a joint & a lighter
You get me so, inspired
I think I’m falling for you girl and I like it

I don’t wanna be a player
Baby I want you
