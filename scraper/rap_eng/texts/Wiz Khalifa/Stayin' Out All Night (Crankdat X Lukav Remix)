I had so much champagne up in the club

Leaving all my problems at the door
Pouring up, soon as you think it’s enough they bringin’ more
Hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”

Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded
If I get back to your spot, won’t know how I made it
