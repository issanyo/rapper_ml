Pop Champagne
Roll some weed up
We in a slow game
I brung the speed up

High-octane
Hella' inked up
Bird or plane
You prolly seen us

Made a little change
But it's all good
Never throw it in your face
I'm from a small hood

Best dressed like a star should
Beat on so I could hardly see y'all
We are, some Taylor Gang Fucking bosses
And I live every day, not caring what the cost is

Pop more bands, Cop more clothes
Drive fast cars, Fuck bad hoes

I fly in circles, you non-workers in dirt last
Reading tweets and falling asleep in first class
Might have heard the song, but y'all ain't know the kid
So I took over the net like Hova did

And set my goals where the solar is
Now my swag on Polar Bear
And you here, so pretend your man don't even exist
And get your lips wet like a lisp

I'm dressed like a pimp
Some dislike from them
But I'm a big fish
You just tiger shrimp

Flirted with fame, but at night I dream of success
If you sleepin' on me, then you gettin' good rest
Yes, cause when niggas' ask; Who hot?
If it ain't Drizzy, then they talkin' 'bout me
