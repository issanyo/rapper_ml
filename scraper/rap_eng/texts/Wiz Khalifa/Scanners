[Intro: Neako & Sample]
This where we meet up at
It’s a different place
Talk the way I know
Yeah, TGOD, LVLYSL
Yeah

[Verse 1: Neako]
Uh, I'm smoking that reefer and sippin’ champagne
Damn mayne, I remember those days I was covered in rain
Now it seems
I'm surrounded by bitches, and covered in chains
Switching lanes, heart beating fast and I'm fryin’ my brain
Boardin’ planes, telling my mama we'll never be poor again
I told her I'd do this a year ago
She told me, “You're insane”
But I gotta be crazy for people to pay me
Off shit that I say, shit that I wrote
Whole lot of smoke in my lungs, makin’ me feel like a ghost
To the sky I go, you’ll be sendin’ him a note
I'm the villain with the flow
No way can they fit him in a mold
You're the one when you feel it in your soul
In fact, I'm feelin’ real close
To a whole other mode I go, I go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Private planes on my jetway
A hundred joints in my ashtray
A couple grand to get just the hate
My money coming up fast way
30 grand is on champagne and that's because I'm thirsty
Bubbles: that's what works for me
Fuck, niggas take it personally
Drink Bombay all day, I smoke purple weed
Get money all day and I'll be gone for weeks
Somewhere in the South of France, overseas
Kush is rolled, that good cologne
Getting stoned, smoking with the owners
If I'm in the club, I'm getting paid to show up
That's gangsta. Real nigga, that's real gangsta
Bitch you lookin at a real Taylor
Paper in my pocket, none to spend
Just to roll my pot with..
