[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm young Khalifa
I'm young-I'm young Khalifa (x7)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
All about my money if you not, I'll see you later
I take out the first two letters and say "Ha-ha" to you haters
I got rooms with elevators
Yeah, they say I'm futuristic
Got a iPhone for business but the Sidekick's for the bitches
Haha

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Stupid swaggered up, niggas mad at us
All my niggas rep that gang and my bitch she bad as fuck
Hair down her back, Religion always true
My president is black, my head coach too
Oooh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Tatted like a Mexican, fresher than a freshman
Pocket full of Benjamin's, how much ain't a question
Wouldn't believe how many older women that be crushing
Never quick to make a scene to me that's really nothing

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Claim your flow insane but niggas not so sick
Let 'em heat up 'fore I eat 'em
Hope the pot don't stick
And my nikes don't fit, but my jeans do
Apoligize for shitting on you niggas I ain't mean to
I see life in plain view I'm looking out the window
Liquor, Swisher, Tips and that bitch to fluff my pillow
California trips got me on some different swag
If you didn't know who I was, I bet you know it now
Yeah

[Hook]
