Chorus - (Wiz Khalifa)
If it's on and poppin', go ahead and move somethin'
And if a hater trip, go ahead and do somethin'
If it's on your chest, go ahead and prove somethin'
If not, stop frontin', you niggas ain't hurtin' nothin', no (X2)

Verse 1 - (Wiz Khalifa)
You niggas ain't hurtin' nothin', all your talkin' is cheap
And my veins is concrete, I'm the heart of this street
Your squadron is weak, I creep with a five-star class
We beef, your block will look like a five-car-crash
Ya know, that you can tell it great, Wiz gettin' hella cake
Keep a chick to freak it with, I'll let you niggas LTH
That's lovin' these hoes, I'm pumpin' these flows
Cuz' I hate these rap niggas, but I'm lovin' the dough
Got a problem, we can solve it, man it's nothin' to show
If I ain't rappin', I'm relaxin' somewhere puffin' an O
I'm with a bad one on the back block, cruisin' through the scene
And I know your man as me, but Wiz Khalifa spittin' crack rock
Niggas out her rattin' man, (D's?) taking snapshots
That's why I hit the lab, get the cash like a jackpot
You niggas mad cuz' the pad look like a stash spot
And niggas gettin' money over here, and your ass not

Chorus - (Wiz Khalifa)
If it's on and poppin', go ahead and move somethin'
And if a hater trip, go ahead and do somethin'
If it's on your chest, go ahead and prove somethin'
If not, stop frontin', you niggas ain't hurtin' nothin' (X2)

Verse 2 - (Wiz Khalifa)
Yo, if a hater trip, go ahead and blaze his shit
Even young kids say Young Wiz is their fa-vo-rite
Khalifa knock it out the park, franchise made it sick
Leavin' niggas in the dark, greedy and i'm takin' chips
And as far as these broads and this green
I got a dollar full of dimes, and a pocket full of G's
You can take it any way, and that's probably what I mean
Long as the (reefa ID?), and the dutchie's full'a weed
See I ain't hard to please, ease when your squadron leave
You don't want the goonies in the riddle, let a cartridge squeeze
You niggas think you low, but i see you guys pop up
Make your team divide like a piece of pie
Why? Cuz' i keep it fly, fresh when I'm creepin' by
Got a mean team, but for me, I'm a peaceful guy
But don't get out of line, cuz' for them dollar signs
The full clip, will make a nigga's thoughts sit out his mind

Chorus - (Wiz Khalifa)
If it's on and poppin', go ahead and move somethin'
And if a hater trip, go ahead and do somethin'
If it's on your chest, go ahead and prove somethin'
If not, stop frontin', you niggas ain't hurtin' nothin', no (X2)
