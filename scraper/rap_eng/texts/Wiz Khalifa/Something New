[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Right Now Sound
I be with the Hitmaka
So, hol' up

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
'Cause I can't stop loving you (Oh yeah)
Since I got a taste of your love (Oh yeah)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh, woah)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
God damn, you know who I am
Try to be on the low, but you ain't slow
Keep my shirt open, eyes low
Get a lot of paper, I know
But you ain't into that
You like real facts
Like, if you show love, you gon' get it back
Like, if you fuck good, you gon' get it back
Like, if you cook, wanna a real nigga that
Gon' rap 'til that pussy like (Uhh uhh)
We can go and get a private room
We can fuck for one night, ain't gotta jump the broom
Say your nigga, chill

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
'Cause I can't stop loving you (Oh yeah)
Since I got a taste of your love (Oh yeah)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh, woah)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I can tell you ain't from 'round here
All that body, baby, it's not fair
Pull up on that ass in a drop, yeah
That's your ex, nigga? I'm dead
Lookin' for a real one? You found it
California King, we gon' go rounds on it
No doubt, yeah
Leave your legs shaking
I might sing to that pussy like la-da-da-di-da (Di, yeah)
Girl, your shit so classic, it don't need no features (No, ooh Yeah)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
'Cause I can't stop loving you (Oh yeah)
Since I got a taste of your love (Oh yeah)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh, woah)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, you look just like something out a magazine (Zine)
You smell great, know your body clean (Yeah)
Them niggas been on you since you was a teen (Teen)
Now you grown up, and I'm a boss, I'm just showing love (Love)
Smell like kush when I'm rolling up (Roll)
So much bank, I can fold it up (Fold)

Tryna kick it with a nigga like, uhh (Brr, oom)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
