[Hook]
I get it back, that's why I blow it
Her ass fat, that's why she throw it
Money long like I grow it
That's why a young nigga ridin' in a foreign
(Foreign, foreign, foreign)
Young nigga ridin' in a foreign
(Foreign, foreign, foreign)
Young nigga ridin' in a
(Foreign, foreign, foreign)
Ridin' in a foreign, foreign, foreign
Young nigga

[Verse 1]
Porsche, Maserati, or a (what?)
Damn, brand new Ferrari or a... Lambo
Nigga got bread
Shooters like, "Don't get close to that new Testarossa."
That Mercedes-Benz come with a chauffeur
I be sparkin' in that Aston-Martin
Gettin' head like it's nothin', push the button, park it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Whipin', whippin'
I swear to God I be dippin', dippin'
In that new Murciélago, we ride foreign
Nelly Furtado hit the gas
Hear the tires screechin'
This ain't even my weekday car, this for the weekend
I got so many horses
All the hoes say that it’s gorgeous
In the air, that's where my doors is

[Hook]
