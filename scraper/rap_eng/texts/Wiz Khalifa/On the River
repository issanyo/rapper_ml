[Intro: Young Dolph & Wiz Khalifa]
Pretty white bitches sniffin' cocaine
My trap house live like the "Soul Train"
I had a dream when I was a young nigga (me too)
Bad bitches
Young live money, big pound of weed in that motherfucker
Gang gang, yeah

[Hook: Young Dolph]
If she ain't pretty, she can't ride with me (hell no)
If she ain't got ass, I don't wanna smash (no thank you)
Weed so good, I don't wanna pass it(whoooo)
All I smoke is killer (strong), your bitch look like "Thriller" (damn)
I might pull up and serve you a pound on a four-wheeler (skrrt)
Fuckin' with the realest, don't know a nigga realer (aye)
Yeah, I can show you how to make that money triple (work)
Took her out to eat, fucked her on the river (huh)

[Verse 1: Young Dolph & Wiz Khalifa]
Syrup sipper, and she full of that liquor (yeah)
Took her out to eat, fucked her on the river (yeah)
She started with me first, pulling on my zipper (yeah)
She thick-alicious, so you know I had to hit her
God damn, hell no, boy you know I didn't kiss her (no)
I'm from Memphis you know I thought about pimping  her(yup)
G’s up hoes down
I might break a bitch like I break down a pound
Want the work for cheap jump on a plane go out of town
Yeah you see that boy ain't solid make that pussy stay from round
All I wanna do is count money and lay up with my lil' bitch
Rich niggas ain't dumb, dumb niggas ain't rich

[Hook: Young Dolph]

All I smoke is killer (strong)
Gotta shout out Killer (hey)
See me in the club, I be standing next to killers (woah)
Got a crib in Cali so my car ain’t got no ceilings (drop?)
Smellin' like that KK when I walk into the building (hey, hey!)
Bank roll, tryna get another million (racks)
Get jammed up he gon' sing like Bryson Tiller (damn)
Garage look like the dealer (haha)
Y'all don't look familiar (who is you?)
Plus I rep them Steelers (yeah)
Don’t care what the bill is (aha!)
Buy it all, buy it all, buy it all
I met the bitch on the first night, she gon' try it all
I feel bad for a nigga 'cause he keep tryna call
Got a Rover at my crib, she’ll be back to you tomorrow
