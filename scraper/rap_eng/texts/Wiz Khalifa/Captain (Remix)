[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, two shots
I done mixed McQueen with the Blue Dot
Thug life, 2Pac
Smoke me a J on the roof top
Champagne, campaign
Spent a whole day on a airplane
Barely get my team on the airplane
Barely get my luggage on the airplane
Lookin' at me like the captain
They treat me, like the captain
Know where I'm goin' like the captain
Show up when I want like the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
What's happenin? What's happenin?
I can hit the trap make it back-flip
What's happenin? What's happenin?
I done made a million, off rappin'
What's happenin? What's happenin?
I could fuck ya bitch, no cappin'
Niggas think they real til they lackin'
You ain't gettin' money 'less you stackin'
Niggas hate me I imagine
No I don't do shit average
In a minute I'ma get shit smackin'
Upfront we ain't dealing with no back end
What's happenin? What's happenin?
All these niggas really care about is fashion
Don't even ask to hit the weed, you ain't matchin'
How they gang? Is the question that I'm askin'

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, two shots
I done mixed McQueen with the Blue Dot
Thug life, 2Pac
Smoke me a J on the roof top
Champagne, campaign
Spent a whole day on a airplane
Barely get my team on the airplane
Barely get my luggage on the airplane
Lookin' at me like the captain
They treat me, like the captain
Know where I'm goin' like the captain
Show up when I want like the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
What's happenin? What's happenin? (Huh?)
Nut on her face, then I pass her a napkin (Huh? Napkin)
Count big racks, blow big bags (ooh, ooh)
Lil Purpp pulled up in a Maybach (Lil Purpp, skrrt)
Lil' bitch gave me head and I laid back (laid back)
Nigga talk shit, on his head like a wave cap (wave cap)
Fucked the lil' ho in an Aston Martin (yuh)
Blow seven bands on the jacket, orange (yuh, yuh)
Di-diamonds on me and they dance like Step Up (Step Up, ooh)
Test me, nigga, shoot from the neck up (neck up)
Bust down, yeah you know I had to flex up (flex)
No doctor, but you know I got my check up (ooh)
Two Glocks, two shots (hey, two shots)
Shoot at his face, that's a crop top (crop top)
Ride in that foreign, that drop top (drop top, skrrt)
Callin' his bitch, get the slop top

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, two shots
I done mixed McQueen with the Blue Dot
Thug life, 2Pac
Smoke me a J on the roof top
Champagne, campaign
Spent a whole day on a airplane
Barely get my team on the airplane
Barely get my luggage on the airplane
Lookin' at me like the captain
They treat me, like the captain
Know where I'm goin' like the captain
Show up when I want like the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
Everywhere I go I'm the captain
