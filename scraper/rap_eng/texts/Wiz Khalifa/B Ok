[Intro]
My bad, I came in and fell straight asleep
Tired as a muhfucker
Uh!

[Verse 1]
It was 2009, and I was just gettin' home off tour
Doin' hella shows for my fans
And I could tell that everybody want more
Ain't ever wait for nobody, we kicked through that front door
And always did our own thing
Can't tell you niggas wanna front for
We bought cones and stuffed more, past girls, you cuffed yours
Spent nights on the airplane goin' too hard, like what for?
And all I did was make time but I ain't take enough for myself
Just doin' shit for everybody else, I ain't hardly even by myself
Family time is slowed down, cause they want me to burn out
Seen the end of this movie, they don't know how it turns out
Say they all gon' still love me if I don't make another hit song
If I don't take time to embrace it
What's the point of doin' this for?
I'm packin' up my bags, book a night, another hotel
It's a lot that could go down so I'm hopin' everything goes well
Came in to this game, givin' rules to you lames
Be the one that's holding you down, tryna count you out
It's a shame

[Chorus]
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)

[Verse 2]
It was 2014, and I was 'bout to go world tourin'
You was all up in my face sayin' that you want more
And I was gettin' tired of frontin' for the public
Sayin' I could do without it but you seem like you love it
I remember all of the subjects
That we would argue 'bout day and night
Do the best that I can, no matter what, I can't make it right
When you said you felt single, I remember like it was yesterday
How the fuck you hold me down
When you ain't take my last name?
I tried hard to move past things, came home, made shit change
Had to make a hard decision, let you go
It's time to do what's best for me
We went to Colorado, we was there for your friends' wedding
I was tryin' to hold it together but I felt like we were ending
I remember the beginning but this ain't nowhere close to that
Seen some shit you didn't like, said some shit that wasn't facts
Never thought 'bout gettin' back by puttin' your business out
In the end you made it seem like I ain't the one who held you down

[Chorus]
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)

[Bridge]
We ain't hurtin' no mo', we ain't fighting no mo'
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' (I swear), we ain't fighting no mo' (no)
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' (we ain't gotta hurt no more, bro)
We ain't fighting no mo'
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' (no), we ain't fighting no mo' (nah)
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)

[Verse 3]
It was 2017, the day before my son birthday
The week before my mom birthday
That's the day you passed away
Can't feel too bad because I know I see you again one day
But right now I can't help but feel this pain

[Chorus]
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
