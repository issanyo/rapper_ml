Taylor made money gang

Chorus:
And my swag so official
Super fresh
And my swag so official
And my swag so official
Swag swag so official
And my swag so official
Swag swag so official

Verse 1:
The world turns
The Kush burns
I touch paper
More paper than a bookworm
So look learn
All I need's my cake
A blunt and a pretty face
Then I'm straight like a good perm
And her swag so official
Taylor made money gang
I'm the general
And all my weed strong like Kimbo Slice
Your money is the only thing I do twice
I'm in the fast lane
Yellow chain blue lights
And you gonna need shades
They say I'm too bright
I'm shitting on the game
So bring through wipes
And you can clean up
And try to be us
I'm sure you niggas is ballin that's what they all say
But me plus getting money
Gonna equal all day
My seats parquet
Bitch from the Caribbean
She say por que
Wizzle K H A

Chorus

Verse 2:
Pyewm
The swag just left the room
And I ain't even pressed
Got you feelin under-dressed
Any time you find him in the building
I'm a threat
Got some Gucci Chuck Tay's
You ain't seen yet
Yellow ice so I may seem fresh
But if you did what I'm doin
Nigga you'd be feeling spoiled rotten
In my city I've got pull
So don't tug
Or get drugged through the mud probably
Like my weed rolled
My steak done properly
I put my team on
Now we own property
And my swag so official
No magazine so my cash not an issue
Tell the ref to throw a flag
Blow the whistle
Cuz your styles out of date
That's a foul on the play
And your words don't hurt him
Because I'm flying out the way
What you make a month I probably spent today
Pyewm
