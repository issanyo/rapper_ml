[Verse 1:]
You told me that I'm everything you could ever need
Them niggas slow but when it comes to me I'm up to speed
And you can't wait to tell your girlfriends you found (everything that you were looking for)

Yeah, I'm respectful, with the swagger on some hood shit
Skinny nigga, but you heard I got some good
Damn, you always run around, saying I'm (everything that I'd be looking for)

But I don't want you to get used to having me around
See, I'll be in and out of town
And Lord knows I see you
When I see you, if I see you
Shorty, I'm a busy man
And I do what I can
And even though we might have done it once
The second time's not a guarantee
Nah, bitch

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again

Oh oh oh
