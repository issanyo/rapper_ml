[Intro: Casey Veggies]

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm 'bout fuck it up
Double up, double up, double up, double up
No, I can't get enough
I'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off
I step in the party like "Let's get it started"
Yeah I'm 'bout to go off
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm 'bout fuck it up
Double up, double up, double up, double up
No, I can't get enough
I'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off
I step in the party like "Let's get it started"
Yeah I'm 'bout to go off

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Top down in the summer, top down in the summer
I came back like LeBron down 3 to 1
I don't understand man, it make me wonder
Why the homie tried to rob him if he had a gun
Hide behind shades watching life fade
Girls shaking ass, it must be a parade
If all these niggas on I must be the one
If all these niggas shooters I must be the gun
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm bout to fuck it up
She shaking that ass so fast, the cash she bout to run it up
Like what is your motif
They want the fame, I want cash and promotion
I'm making it splash on that ass like the ocean
I ride my own wave cause my buzz'll be rolling
I'm grinding double the time for mine, I'm keeping it coming in
Had the Audi at 18, the Bimmer at 20
Now I'm bout to cop the Benz
My circle so small that everyone else on the outside looking in
I don't trust nobody, I don't see nobody
Versace shades on my lens

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm 'bout fuck it up
Double up, double up, double up, double up
No, I can't get enough
I'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off
I step in the party like "Let's get it started"
Yeah I'm 'bout to go off
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm 'bout fuck it up
Double up, double up, double up, double up
No, I can't get enough
I'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off
I step in the party like "Let's get it started"
Yeah I'm 'bout to go off

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Really got money, I rap
When I fall through the trap I'ma show off
Smoking that KK, you hit this shit once I promise that you gon' cough
Riding around in my '62 hit the switch once when I skrrt off
Passenger seat got your bitch
If she say she don't smoke that's a turn off
Tatted up, I got my shirt off
Hating you can't get a word off
You the kind I never heard of
Taylor Gang or seeing murder
She want some dick, guarantee I'ma serve her
Practice what I preach
[?] me, I just teach what I learned
Got weed and I burn it
She giving me brains, that secret service
Don't speak what you [?]
We park the low rider so deep on the curb
Stay holding it down for my team on you geeks and you nerds
You ain't bout your paper my nigga and I think it's absurd
She say she love you but really that shit's a diversion
Say that you stacking but really be splurging
I get a old school Impala and cut that shit up like a surgeon

[Hook: Casey Veggies & (Wiz Khalifa)]
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm 'bout fuck it up
(Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang)
Double up, double up, double up, double up
No, I can't get enough
I'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off
(We smoking good over here)
I step in the party like "Let's get it started"
Yeah I'm 'bout to go off
(My nigga Casey what's good
Gang Gang, Jet Life, you heard?)
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm 'bout fuck it up
Double up, double up, double up, double up
No, I can't get enough
(Double that shit up, roll another joint
Put another bitch on top of that bitch
Buy another car on top of that car
Get another watch, get another chain
Do your own thing nigga, Taylor Gang)
I'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off
I step in the party like "Let's get it started"
Yeah I'm 'bout to go off

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
She ain't with the questions
I told her I ain't with the extras
I'm glad we made a connection
Checking them hoes off my check list
All in the club and we flexing
She fucking it up in the section
It made her think all we do is sin
And then she realized I'm a blessing
Really do it, they gotta show off
This real life, I can't take a day off
Go hard or go home like the playoffs
If you stay there, you might just get paid off
You ain't never whipped these cars nigga
You ain't never seen a hundred large nigga
You ain't minaj'd these broads nigga
One thing bout my gang, we all get it
Girl I pull up in the hood for ya
Everything that look good, it ain't good for ya
The haters is watching, I can't trust 'em
If the bullets start flying it's no discussion
He did too much talking, I had to rush 'em
Got your bitch in the back and I ain't bluffing
The streets is so crazy but it's what made me
Fifty mil couldn't change me, I'm still Casey
We run up the bands and we going crazy
Yeah we run up the bands and we going crazy
Book up the flights and we on vacation
Gave her a shot but I never chase it
The money I'm married, I can't replace her
Do me a favor, do me no favors
Nothing was handed, I had to take it
They don't wanna see me make it, yeah

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm 'bout fuck it up
Double up, double up, double up, double up
No, I can't get enough
I'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off
I step in the party like "Let's get it started"
Yeah I'm 'bout to go off
That money is coming, that money is coming
And I'm 'bout fuck it up
Double up, double up, double up, double up
No, I can't get enough
I'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off
I step in the party like "Let's get it started"
Yeah I'm 'bout to go off
