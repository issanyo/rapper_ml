[Chorus]
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel

[Verse 1]
Hotel smoked out
I ain't going nowhere
Leaving in the morning
Cleaning lady picking up roaches, so she don't care
How I move so player? G Pen, mid-air
High school I was getting high
Teacher say I was going nowhere
Now I'm worth millions that's the worst feeling
Said fuck a job bought the building
All these fake niggas where the real ones
First-class no shoes, young nigga I got no rules
6'1", no roof, go hard won't lose
And you know the truth, I got more to do
Already made history once
Fuck I'm supposed to do?
Big bag, no seeds
Yeah I rap and I grow weed
When you this great, niggas don't hate
It's about dollars so it can't wait

[Chorus]
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel

[Verse 2]
Break down the gas roll another one
Puff one J, roll my brother one
Already stoned and I'm almost home
If you high then you know where I'm coming from
KK feel it all in my lungs, one puff damn got me going numb
Everywhere I go niggas want some
(Damn, man let me get some of that shit)
No, high all day I ain't coming down
Take two pulls then it's going round
Since a young nigga I been blowing pounds
Always in the sky I ain't on the ground
Jump in the ride about to blow a cone
Niggas at the crib so I'm solo
Take this half-ounce to the dome
Smoke this hash out of the bong
Don't choke don't pass out until the morning
In the club throwing cash out 'til it close
And I stay with the pack on any coast
KK cut down to a clone
Gameday touchdown Randy Moss
Say we just ran out so we getting more
We gone smoke 'til we ain't got anymore
Don't just roll one roll plenty more

[Chorus]
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel

[Outro]
