[Verse 1: Currensy]
Money in the floor, weed in a bowl
On the couch, life like Ox
Big TV, nigga, big ass remote
Motion sensors all over my house
For investigative ass hoes
That's waiting for me to pass out
So they can tiptoe all over my home
Woah, pump your brakes, slow your roll
I got cake, bread in loaves
State to state, hit that road
Hit that bank when I get home
Hit that lot tomorrow morn'
I think they got the one I want
Top I drop like my ex ho
Top get dropped like I let it go
Fool I close Ferrari doors
My driveway is a horse show
Smoke my weed, eat my breakfast
My bitch read our horoscopes
Out loud

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Talk about what's gon' get done to a nigga, until I run in to niggas
Might dress kinda funny to niggas, I got more money than niggas
These niggas lackin positive influence so I'm son'ing these niggas
You niggas more Calogero I'm more Sunny than niggas
That's why I got a couple of cribs and everyone one of 'em owned
Shoulda have my Ferrari but now I had to give my mother a home
Just bought a few pounds the other day and everyone one of 'em gone
Just counting my chains, tomorrow I'mma put everyone one of 'em on
You niggas must be trippin' yeah that's a Benz, nigga what's the edition
(Niggas jealous cause they see me gettin' money)
See me and Spitta in this bitch, they like yeah niggas must be twistin'
(So much swag and you niggas looking bummy)
And we been giving swag but on the real that wasn't the intention
(So much swag make a nigga wish he was me)
It's kinda funny cause a nigga thought I was being different
(I'm getting high laughing at you niggas cause it's funny)
