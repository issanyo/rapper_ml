Verse 1:
Super villain, outlaw, renegade
Smokin drinkin gin wit my lemonade
Dont gota chase these bitches dog they ina race
I make all this money throw it in ya face
Said you know my name but you can't say it right
Long as you let me fuck then you can stay the night
I play the game, you playin it safe
Lets take shots try no chase
Then we slide like home base

Chorus:
Ohhh
So pick a time and place tell me where you wanna go
Dont need to ask no questions you should already know
Got Gleeco bottle, bottle yea we keep it popin
Champagne round the bar plenty sour diesel to smoke
Cuz im the bad guy say im the bad guy
Im the bad guy say hi to the bad guy
And I need a bad girl, and I need a bad girl
Im the bad guy say im the bad guy
Im the bad guy say hi to the bad guy
And I need a bad girl
The one your parents warned you bout
The nigga of ya wildest dreams

Verse 2:
Couple thousand dollars on this ros
Like girls who come have fun but dont stay
We can go to my house or back to your place
You bring a friend then go both ways
Fuckin wit these niggas cuz are money good
Superstar status plus I keep it hood
Chorus

Bridge:
Bad guy so I keep a bad bitch wit me
Know how to roll a joint and live life like a bring it back
Bad guy so I keep a bad bitch wit me
