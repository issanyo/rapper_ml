[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
My friends roll Lexus and Benzes
Spend ends tremendous, uh, like dough's endless
Been this nigga from the start, was already hot
No prob' openin' shop, the flow ready rock (Yeah)
So many try and knock my hustle
Half of y'all ain't even got no hustle, I'm into living good
So I bring heat with the flow just how a nigga should
Come between me and my dough, I wish a nigga would (Nigga would)
Roll O's and cigarillos, my black brim low
The way I stack in dough attract nymphos (Damn)
Cats sick though, too impressed by how that honey walk
Me, I'm tryna come up on some ways to make that money talk (Money talk)
Sink or swim, I'm a hungry shark (Shark)
And I want it all, cribs and a foreign car, Audemars (Mar)
I could be gone tomorrow (Morrow)
That's why I grind like it's my last day
Hundred fucking roaches in my ash tray

[Chorus]
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good

[Verse 2]
My weed kicks like Jet Li flicks
Test me kid, slap shots like Gretzky hits (Woo)
The best kept secret, yes he is
The cat's out of the bag, I puff puff and I pass
You dumb fucks and I laugh, motherfucker, what you hatin' for?
Why you just standin' outside, what you waitin' for? (Haha)
I'm blowin' on an eighth or more, touring for my paper, boy
Before I hit the club I need a blunt or two or three or four (Yeah)
Bad bitches thirsty for stars with mad riches
Wanna ride with 'em, rest they heads on televisions
I don't bag bitches (Nah) they hop in, you just follow and
You beg bitches, (Damn) you're not a pimp, I was schooled by the
Best of them, (Yeah) now they cuttin' checks for him
Ain't gettin money then it's probably for the rest of them
Something like a legend when I quote what I wrote (Wrote)
Be in the big cloud from the blunts that I smoke (Smoke)

[Chorus]
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
