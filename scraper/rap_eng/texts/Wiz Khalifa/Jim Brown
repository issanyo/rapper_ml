Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga when you see him?
Why you fuckin' with a nigga when a real nigga right and you tryna leave him?
See him around in the club, see him buying out the bar, so the hoes tryna meet him
You can talk and make a nigga pay for it (?) you don't fuck the first night with me either
