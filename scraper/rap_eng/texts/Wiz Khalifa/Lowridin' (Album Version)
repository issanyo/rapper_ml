[Bionic] FM on your dial
[Wiz Khalifa] Yeah, Khalifa game
[Bionic] Bionic

[Hook: Bionic]
She clungs around my waste
We're lowriding
She likes the songs I played
Lowriding
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding

[Vesre 1: Kev Nish]
Lowriding with my dime
Girl you my one and only
Like riding down the 405 with 5-0 only
We California rolling
Slow motion to the ocean
Ride down to Texas
En garde, we be gulf coasting
Let me see that trunk shape
Yeah, I'm a lowrider
Drop down let me see you scrace
Yeah, I'm a nightrider
I'm sitting sideways
I'm rocking shutter shades
Lowriding all day
S-s-stun away

[Hook: Bionic]
She clungs around my waste
Lowriding, low, lowriding
She likes the songs I played
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lips look like candy cane
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Picture me south west PA
On my way to L.A
Blackberry going nuts
The bitch be calling all day
There ain't no "I got what you need for ya"
Critics know my flow
I got that [?] game for ya
And now we riding all day
In my lowrider
I get high like elevators
But this ain't Flow Rida
No rider can compare my swag on 1-0-0
I'm so fly I'm in the air
I'm like a young superhero
I'm a proud little kid
Everything tell it
From my neck to my hands
Once I started you got it
Got a charm full of stone
A belt full of thongs
Blowing out the money
Bitches landing in my home

[Hook: Bionic]
She clungs around my waste
Lowriding, low, lowriding
She likes the songs I played
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lips look like candy cane
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
Yeah 20" subs, tweeters in the vents
A thousand Watt amps lowriding in the deck
Can't ride the way we ride
Scope 100 golden eye
Making my dose suicide dose
Stay open, we are so fly

[Verse 4: J-Splif]
I ride to the top with a chick by my side
Got my windows down an mirrors shaking
Blowtorch 'till I'm high, represent west side
When I pass by [?] my day ends
I got that big body, shavvy
Taking up two lanes
Take a peek real quick
We be gone in a tick
I'm out like David Blaine

[Hook: Bionic]
She clungs around my waste
Lowriding, low, lowriding
She likes the songs I played
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lips look like candy cane
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding
