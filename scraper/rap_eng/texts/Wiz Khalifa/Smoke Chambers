[Verse 1]
Back when I was a kid I used to drive alone
Always feeling like I was stuck out here on my own
Now my pockets is full and I'm still riding slow
What goes on in my head, don't nobody really know
I'm in the light, all on my life get put on display
Nothing to call my own, ducking, dodging everyday
Put that camera phone away and keep it real with me
Time and time again I'm searching for reality
And feeling so alone

[Chorus]
Alone again (x3)
Alone...

[Verse 2]
I'm smoking that weed everyday but never hide my faith
They calling my phone, I don't even got the time a day
Don't know their motives anymore that's why I hesitate
I'm tired of partying and getting drunk, I'm trying to elevate
I remember back in the day, I ain't had no cash
I was coming up off of nothing hoping it would last
Now it's 2015 and I got it all
Feeling like I did, when I started on my own
Out here all alone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
No use looking out
It’s within that brings that
Lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You’ll be clear
Among the better men
