[Intro]
Is this the top?
Cool
They say we too rich
Too rich

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Ain't holding on to nothing, I've been trained to blow it
Pick your favorite place, I get the plane, we gone
Roll the marijuana right up where my job is
Getting all this money got me living lawless
Popping hella bottles don't care what it costs us
Started small time, now all my diamonds flawless
Fuck you talking bout bitch my new watch just changed the game
Rich and all my niggas balling, call me Major Payne
I just spent some racks on all this fabric
And my stylist it say she got it
Swear to god is just like magic, cause the store didn't even have it
My flow is supersonic, bitch I'm floating off that chronic

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa and Fashawn x2]
Champagne, I got lot of it, if it's new then I'm rocking it
Climbing all my money, standing on top of it
New chains I got 2 of those, lot of haters we through with those
Getting money and getting more

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I used to smoking some OG, used to burn about an OZ
Sold weed that was '03, now a nigga need 4 keys
Bare arms, no sleeves, in my khaki shorts, no jeans
Shawn Don in my styrofoam, motherfuck that codeine
I'm east side, so what, bitch niggas got no nuts
Y'all B.G.'s, we grown ups, teach ya how to keep chrome tucked
Ain't a bad bitch that I won't fuck
And if her head good, she might can get her toes up
High socks and some low cuts, fat spliff I don't roll blunts
You shine while I glow chump (glow chump)
Not a day that I'm sober, on the block and I'm posted
Cork poppin', we toastin'

[Hook x2]
