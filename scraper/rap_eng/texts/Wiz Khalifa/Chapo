[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Keep that weed smoke everywhere we go
(Keep that weed smoke everywhere we go)
Keep that champagne and Bombay to po
(Keep that champagne and Bombay to po)
Pull up, you know it’s fast cars we drive
(Pull up, you know it’s fast cars we drive)
Say what they want, we just live our life
(Say what they want, we just live our life)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fast money, fast cars, and fast hoes
I get it all on the go
Bout to take out a couple grand and throw it on the flo’
As soon as I hit the stage the people screamin’ mo
I’m livin' life, jets, private planes
All kinds of things
Some people think I’m insane
But that’s okay, I remain synonymous to success in this game
And can’t nothing stand in my way
Ain’t nothing stopping the money from piling
My niggas stylin', they getting rich as the bitches from getting it poppin'
Sipping champagne on an island
And now my bank account overflowing with motherfuckin' commas
Making these niggas sick, call a doctor
Man take a look in they pocket
Givin bitches reason to call em' imposters
Damn, all of my whips proper
All of my time Rolex clocks
Fill my pants with knots
Be 100 years til this shit stops

[Hook]
Keep that weed smoke everywhere we go
(Keep that weed smoke everywhere we go)
Keep that champagne and Bombay to po
(Keep that champagne and Bombay to po)
Pull up, you know it’s fast cars we drive
(Pull up, you know it’s fast cars we drive)
Say what they want, we just live our life
(Say what they want, we just live our life)

[Verse 2: Berner]
Record in the AM, I’m sweatin' out gin
My clothes smell like kush smoke, cookies and chem
Girls pussy poppin' just to give me a chain
Old schools, Europeans, and cold champagne
This the L.I.F.E these bums don’t impress me, they’re broke
Let em choke, damn all this gold's heavy
New prezzy, blue Chevy
Baby girl choosin', goddamn she’s too petty
More guapo, yeah they love me like Chapo
Pull up with the top down
Cudi call me Pablo
I can put your man on, girl let the clock go
Take his own face off, hit him with the hollow
Is she ready? When she bring me back fetty?
Walk up and down any turn tricks into telly
Got that top floor smelly, Y taste like grape jelly
Imma hold it down for all my loved ones really
