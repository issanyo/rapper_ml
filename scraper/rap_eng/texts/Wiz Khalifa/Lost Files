[Intro]
Lost and turned out
Lost and turned out
Cardo got wangs
Lost and turned out??]
Lost and turned out
Lost and turned out
Lost and turned out
Lost and turned out
Lost and turned out
Lost and turned out
Lost and turned out

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & The Whispers]
Roll up a plane, take it straight to the brain
Every part of the day, I be (lost and turned out)
Jump in my ride, then I start to get high
See it all in my eyes, I be lost and turned out
I'm blowing smoke, everywhere that I go
You should already know, I be lost and turned out
When I wake up, gotta bake up
Everyday countin' paper lost and turned out

[Verse 1]
I got three cellphones, plants gettin' grown
I hit the studio, still in my zone
I got six cars chilliin' at home
And four on the way, smoke weed every day
A bad broad, I don't pay to play
She in love with Khalifa, man
Smoke weed call me Cam and make sure my steam shower in
Wake up not knowing where I am

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & The Whispers]
Roll up a plane, take it straight to the brain
Every part of the day, I be  lost andturned out
Jump in my ride, then I start to get high
See it all in my eyes, I be lost and turned out
I'm blowing smoke, everywhere that I go
You should already know, I be lost andturned out
When I wake up, gotta bake up
Everyday countin' paper lost and turned out

[Verse 2]
No matter the case, we gotta get this cake
I'm never at home, I'm in and out of state
Arguing on the phone, tell the room service bring me a plate
I'm rolling a joint, I'm gon' be kinda late
Real niggas relate, bitch ass niggas anticipate
The day that my bank disintegrate
Put me up with the greats
Let's look at my calendar, fill 'em dates
First class ain't a bed, the nigga wait

[Bridge]
For all my Kush & Orange Juice fans
People who'v been rockin' with me since day one
Khalifa and Cardo
This somethin' just for you guys
Rolling Papers 2 on the way
But while you guys wait, man, get really really high
We gon' do the same

[Chorus]
Roll up a plane (Yeah), take it straight to the brain
Every part of the day, I be  lost in [??]
Jump in my ride, then I start to get high
See it all in my eyes, I be lost in [??]
I'm blowing smoke, everywhere that I go
You should already know, I be lost in [??]
When I wake up, gotta bake up
Everyday countin' paper lost in [??]

[Outro]
You won't believe how high I got today
Khalifa and Cardo
I got a big ass joint rolled right now
This motherfucker look crazy
Motherfuckin' gone
Shout out to the gang, it's Taylor Gang over and over and over
Until it's over but it ain't ever gon' be over man
Y'all niggas gon' die before we start countin' this paper
I swear
