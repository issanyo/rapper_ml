[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yes you know me, it's AK
Your name will be mayday
Y'all deal with deuces like Ray-Ray
All y'all kids to me baby
Baby you looking good I may say
Fuck with me you ain't gotta wait till payday
I don't know nothing about lay away
Little orphan any, your mom's only a day away
Little one that I just might like
You must be a keyboard you just my type
If the cat ride I just might bite
But sometimes I just text and be like kissing

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When you ain't got time and don't even know what they waiting for
When the money get down, we don't worry much, make some more
All my niggas get high when we say so
Niggas say they this fly but they ain't though
Every time we ride by, we be blowing on smoke
Riding over if it's foreign then the doors up
You already know

[Verse 2: Berner]
Yeah the Bay’s in the area
She a cool bitch but I never marry her
2 drunk hoes on my back seat kissing crazy
Text on my phone when your bitch go missing
I’m from Frisco yeah we been on pimpin' for real
Birdman rich off women like Pac said, I get around
But a mouth like that might make me settle down
My name on the back, we get money out of town
She shake that ass and grab money of the ground
That’s just my type
We sleep all day and fuck all night

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When you ain't got time and don't even know what they waiting for
When the money get down, we don't worry much, make some more
All my niggas get high when we say so
Niggas say they this fly but they ain't though
Every time we ride by, we be blowing on smoke
Riding over if it's foreign then the doors up
You already know

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Champagne take the pain away
I make it work on Labour Day
How y'all bounce like a fade away
Baseball, I'm getting money on a daily basis
Check the database, got a million miles on delta
Started with a Delta 88
You had to pay to play, I did it day to day
Washed all the dishes even the paper plates
I like light hoes, they be with dark hoes
They like white hoes, they be with dyke hoes
I got a ounce on me, I let her bounce on it
I make her calm quick, I put the house on it
I'm tryna make more, sold the tape more
I'm bout to pimp the game, who [?]
I'm bout to beauty kitchen size of a Bape store
Now niggas know what I'm going ape for

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When you ain't got time and don't even know what they waiting for
When the money get down, we don't worry much, make some more
All my niggas get high when we say so
Niggas say they this fly but they ain't though
Every time we ride by, we be blowing on smoke
Riding over if it's foreign then the doors up
You already know
