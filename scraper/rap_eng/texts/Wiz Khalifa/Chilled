[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
I be ridin' all day with these packs on me, man

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Champagne's on ice
Do it once, do it twice
Live once for the night
Roll one, I'ma light

2 cars in the front
1 in the back
Know that money stacked
Champagne's on ice
Do it once, do it twice
Live once for the night
Roll one, I'ma light
Know I got the pack
2 cars in the front
1 in the back
Know that money stacked

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I need a bitch and a classic, I need a bitch with an accent
I need a bitch that'll practice
Yeah, give you that work, make it backflip
Say you be reppin' the gang well then get it tatted
Uh, she the one to hold me down when I'm out on the road
When I pull up to the crib, got one already rolled
Been fuckin' with me before I was gettin' that paper
Been told you not to fuck with me 'cause I'm a player
Wanna know my horoscope, told her I'm a Virgo
She said she a Scorpio, we gon' blow it by the O
I'ma get some drink to pour, she gon' take it real slow
Tired of the fuck niggas, Khalifa man, the real one though
Khalifa man, the real boss, baby girl, a real pro
Taught you how to suck a dick, now you do it like you own it
Drop you off in a Porsche, pick you up in a '64
All you girls stay lit, late night, you hit my phone
Already know that

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Champagne's on ice
Do it once, do it twice
Live once for the night

Know that money stacked
Champagne's on ice
Do it once, do it twice
Live once for the night
Roll one, I'ma light

[Verse 2: Berner]
The way she swing around that pole, baby put it on me
But she fuck with anybody, so she gotta give me money
Long hair, with that ass and them crazy nails
Black out drunk in the club, she been takin' pills
Yeah, you're cute for a prostitute but trust me
Bitches like you come and go, or get me caught up over somethin'
Keep my bottles ice cold and we smokin' out this club
We run through bitches all week, you fall in love and wife 'em up
Lightin' up the Sunday driver, yeah, I'm never high enough
She put my hands on her throat, she like it rough, I light it up
Heard your man is a sucker, he's inside, his time is up
Comes home in the week, he got a problem, line it up
When it's dark in my truck, yeah, my jewelry light it up
Yeah, that champagne's on ice, but that Sprite is in my cup
Yeah, this is how you s'posed to live
I brought the strip club home to the crib
Yeah, I really did it twice

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Champagne's on ice
