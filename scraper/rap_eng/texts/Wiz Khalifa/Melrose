Yaaa, ya, ya
Shoutout to Wiz
Turn the mic up, KK

That Boi Cass

[Chorus]
Ridin' round with the top down, riding down Melrose
Smokin, livin life, came a long way from sellin' O's
Used to be broke and I couldn't afford nothing but some shelltoes
They took my homie life away and they gave him a elbow
Been through so much in my life that nobody would ever know
Thugger he came and and he got me and sent me down better roads
I had no where to go, I had no where to go
I built a circle like the letter 'O'
I kept on grinding, gave back to the 'po

[Verse 1]
Wiz in this bitch and he screamin' out Taylor Gang
We makin' major plays, give a fuck bout what a hater say
You thirsty lil bitch, here's some Gatorade
Major league ballin, I'm major paid
[?] like the sergeant like Major Payne
Grew up with junkies that's smokin cocaine
Trapped in the spot with the roaches
Don't want no Ford but I'm focused
Keep stayin' down, they gon' notice
No sleep like I'm on Folgers
Niggas by liars, they bogus
Everyday buy a new pair Air Forces
I wasn't poor, but I had no choice
Havin' dreams of ridin Rolls Royce
Now the people want to hear my voice
I need some lean cuz my throat is moist
They lovin' the kid on the Peoples' Choice
Pulled off in a lamb and came back in a Porsche

[Chorus]
Ridin' round with the top down, riding down Melrose
Smokin, livin life, came a long way from sellin' O's
Used to be broke and I couldn't afford nothing but some shelltoes
They took my homie life away and they gave him a elbow
Been through so much in my life that nobody would ever know
Thugger he came and and he got me and sent me down better roads
I had no where to go, I had no where to go
I built a circle like the letter 'O'
I kept on grinding, gave back to the 'po

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
Young Khalifa got no time for niggas who can't stand on their own two
Fuck you talkin about [?]
It's time to show em, prove what you gon' do
When everybody hustlin, everybody shinin' everyone fall through
Soon as shit get crazy, been a couple days and ain't no one call you
I done took a loss and came up like a boss and then made it all back
Smile at your face, try to take your place if that ain't hate then what you call that?
Couple niggas gone, I swear to God I wish I could bring 'em all back
Wish they had Taylor Gang on instead of being buried in all black
Ridin' around with a new girl and that's yo bitch
Got love for my gang and they love me, know they won't switch
Got a new bitch cuz I can't get along with my old one
And if you got one on you man go on and roll one

[Chorus]
Ridin' round with the top down, riding down Melrose
Smokin, livin life, came a long way from sellin' O's
Used to be broke and I couldn't afford nothing but some shelltoes
They took my homie life away and they gave him a elbow
Been through so much in my life that nobody would ever know
Thugger he came and and he got me and sent me down better roads
I had no where to go, I had no where to go
I built a circle like the letter 'O'
I kept on grinding, gave back to the 'po
