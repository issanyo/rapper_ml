[verse 1]
Everybody chilling
Everyone doing they’re own thing
And smoking
And singing
So beautifully
A real world full of peace
And I’m not just some pot smoking hippie
Imma mixed kid
Filled with possibilities
I know I gotta disability
But I got some capabilities
And I got some abilities
And the world seem endless
To me

[pre-Chorus]
Alien OG
Got me in my feelings
Flying high like a fairy
Yeah that weed I’m smoking
It just got me chillin ( shout out to Tyler the creator)

[Chorus]
Look up and see the sky’s
It’s so Pink and bright
I’m so high
Yeah
It’s a motha f’in Dream World
Where it rains all day
But nobody’s suffering
It’s so Ultra
It’s a motha f’in Dream World

[Verse 2]
Oh my little black baby
Nicole
She got pretty green eyes
Running through her whole mind
I just don’t know
The lights are on
But nobody’s there
But they just don’t care
Running through the house
Running through the house
Chasing the white mouse
Chasing for the clout
Imma smoke in the rain
Yeah
Chill vibes
Writing what’s on my mind
Swimming through my thoughts
And running from my memories
What does that mean
I don’t know
Don’t ask me

[Chorus]

[verse 3]
They got the world figured out
Don’t they
Fuck the nineteen thirty’s
People just want money
We just made a good thing
Complicated
I don’t even know
I’m too faded
Y’all don’t know the frustration
I can’t even catch a break
From these emo boys
Talkin’ about I’m insane
When we’re staying up half the night
Watching 10 hour videos
And yet I need a life
Well the past is the past
I don’t want this fight to last
Much longer than it should
But anyone come to my house
In the mid class
To lower class & the hood
Imma smoke some grass
And come out to my house
And kick you’re ass

[Chorus]
Look up and see the sky’s
It’s so Pink and bright
I’m so high
Yeah
It’s a motha f’in Dream World
Where it rains all day
But nobody’s suffering
It’s so Ultra
It’s a motha f’in Dream World

Wiz: I’m about to get stoned, get something to eat, & go to the gym

Erykah Badu: oh that’s beautiful
