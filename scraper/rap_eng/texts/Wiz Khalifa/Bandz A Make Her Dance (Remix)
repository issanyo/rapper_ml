[Intro: Juicy J]
Ear Drummers
Strippers
Mike WiLL Made-It
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Short hair, like Nia Long, loose ones, she don't need a loan
Start twerkin' when she hear her song, stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some, so nasty when she rollin'
She put that ass up in my hands, I remote control it (yeah ho)
She give me dome when the roof gone
After K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends, bring three. I got drugs, I got drink (yeah ho)
Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint (yeah ho)
You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't (yeah ho)
Racks everywhere, they showin' racks, I'm throwin' racks
In the V.I.P, rubber on I'm stretchin' that
Rich niggas tippin', broke niggas lookin'
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin' pussy

[Chorus: Juicy J & Lil Wayne]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands
Baby
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
Juicy I got you
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga
Smokin' on Keysh, Cole, gimme me chills nigga
What's your real name? And not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bandz a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit-it-from-the-side-like-a-mothafuckin'-bass-drum
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole, two hoes on my fuckin' pole
I don't tip, I pay bills, bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in and her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out (Ha ha)

[Chorus: Juicy J & Lil Wayne]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
Tunechi
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands
(Young Mula Baby)
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
2 Chainz, four bracelets
Let me see that ass clap; standin' ovation
If yo girl don't swallow kids, man, that ho basic
Got 2 bitches with me: take a shot of one ho, usin' her friend for a chaser
Bandz a make her bust it, let me see you touch it
Money talk, you ain't got none, end of discussion
Bandz a make her do it, pocket full of money
Young nigga gettin' head while the engine runnin'
Let me see you wiggle, do it for a real nigga
I be laughin' to the bank, all you do is giggle
Ballin' in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freak it, treat that bitch just like a porn star

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands
