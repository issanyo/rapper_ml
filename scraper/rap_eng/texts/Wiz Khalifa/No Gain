[Intro]
We started?
I've got so much, so much shit to do, don't even know where to start
Be here forever..
I think that's the plan, yanno?
Start here, end up there
Soon as you think something's goin' on you start back over
It's never gonna be the same
I ain't complainin' though
I really wouldn't have it any other way
NIGGA

[Verse 1]
Every day you wake up your destiny depends on what you do
Sometimes I roll one when I'm stressed out and sometimes I roll two
Here people sayin' shit about the way I am but I know that ain't true
At times I feel like I'm all by myself and I know you do too
I made some phone calls and checked emails cause I'm always grinding
Ain't no rush, I do things slow cause it's all about timing
Some people think when you get to this point in life you've made it
I've seen so many settle for less, that's when talent get wasted
I ain't there, but if I can I'ma try to be perfect
And for those who ridin' with me, I'ma try to make it worth it
I drink too much, I prefer weed 'cause it's better for the stress
I just woke up, I don't get sleep, boy, my schedule's a mess

[Chorus]
Man, I work hard (goddamn, shit)
Man, I work hard (what? woah)
Man, I work hard (literally, nigga, work, get your bags, let's go)
Man, I work hard (we on, nigga)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
No pain
Man, I work hard

[Verse 2]
Just left another one
Just rolled another one
Just got another check
'Bout to thumb through another one
Fallin' asleep on the plane, no sleep, the flight come with one
Young nigga holdin' it down, don't care if it make you uncomfortable
Hardly spend nights at the crib, homie that's just how I live
Don't even go hard for myself, I got a wife and a kid
I don't ever question the biz, nigga it is what it is
You niggas ain't killin shit, no you niggas ain't killin shit
What they doin'? They say nothin'
Where they goin'? They say nothin'
Call my phone, it ain't nothin'
I smoke a lot, but don't judge me
Prolly wake up earlier than all of you niggas
Mafuckas always hate on the squad
But all the hatin' mafuckas always hatin ain't get paid

[Chorus]
Man, I work hard
Man, I work hard (fuck!)
Man, I work hard (I mean like goddamn what you want me to say?)
Man, I work hard (it's what I do!)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
No pain
Man, I work hard
