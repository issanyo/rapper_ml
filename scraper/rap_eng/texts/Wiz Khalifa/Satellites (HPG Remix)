Satellites, satellites never really made love but she gonna get it right
Emotions probably telling her she can stay tonight
But her friends all call us crazy, they don’t give her good advice
Satellites, satellites never really made love, never really made love
Said she never really made love (Chorus)
I was shot through the heart
Just on the d-lo, Luca Brasi sellin kilos
Gotta shop outta town, and got a spot just around the way
Let’s be specific
If I'm the nigga you feelin, am I wrong for showin interest in these women surroundin
Im'a straight dick her down and go, no time to lounge with hoes
On the grind, all the time, I done been down this road
Strictly need my C-notes, can you keep up with my lingo
Some would say life is a gamble, which means love is a casino
Everybody just playin to win, think I made it again
Don't many ladies pretend, hopin this ain't what it is
Ain't no wastin time, hustle every night
Promise every thing is alright
(Chorus)
Ooh she ain't ever met a rich nigga
She never moving by the Oh (no, no)
She ain't never come back to back
I get behind her and I take control
So do you like that
You like, yeah you right
Fuck you real good you’ll see satelites
And you know what’s up
She was smoking
When I need a joint, she roll me one up
In my car, going hard, going far, in the stars, in a club, in a bar, going big, going large
Oh my God, oh my God
You’ll be screaming oh my God, now you're wet
You can say that young Khalifa played a part
Satellites, satellites never really make love but she gonna get it right
Emotions probably telling her she can stay tonight
But her friends are call her crazy, don’t give her good advice
Satellites, satellites never really made love, never really made love
She never really made love
