[Intro]
Ok, alright
Alright, here's the hook right here, this is it
This how I do, yeah

[Chorus]
I've been hustling like every day
Doing time on the grind, tryna make it pay
I'm still posted on the same block
Same hood, still ducking from the same cops
I try hard for the life I live and it all [?]
Sometimes I pray to God I'm dreaming, but I ain't
Tryna get out, but I can't, damn

[Verse]
I'm still gon' let it ride out, slide out
Take yo bitch to my hide out
Then she see what getting high about
I got joint rollers, I got weed crushers, I got joint papers
I got big crushes on the lil bitches and these
Big money, I don't talk funny, I just head to the bank

[Chorus]
I've been hustling like every day
Doing time on the grind, tryna make it pay
I'm still posted on the same block
Same hood, still ducking from the same cops
I try hard for the life I live and it all [?]
Sometimes I pray to God I'm dreaming, but I ain't
Tryna get out, but I can't, damn
