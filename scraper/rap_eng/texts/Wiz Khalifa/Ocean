[Intro]
Got you rolling papers, got you rolling papers
Got you rolling papers, got you rolling papers
Minus the bullshit
Got you rolling papers, got you rolling (uh)

[Verse 1]
Can't do it average, you cool and savage
Makin' niggas do backflips
FaceTime my phone, you be on a jet
Roll my spliffs, send me pics every now and then
When we met, I could admit, I was just after sex
Taught you not to look for results, but trust the process
Plus, you got your paper, ain't no nonsense
Smoke from the bong intense, when she with you, she over it
Faded but focused, I stay posted
Hit me up, the case closed, I leave the gate open
Know what's good, your chain say "Ocean"
Put you on to the finer things
Now when you see designer, you keep your composure
Send a text, say she comin' over
I don't have to send a car, she get her own 'Cause she ain't been sober
No panties on, you ain't needin' those Ron O'Neal, Curtis Mayfield
Hittin' notes, hit the joint, leave the roach

[Chorus]
You don't know
What you do to me lately
I got so much love for ya
Want you to know
How much that I fuck with you, oh
You don't know
What you do to me lately
Wanna roll one up for ya
Want you to come to the back of the club
Show some love to a real one (uh)

[Verse 2]
Netflix and extra long spliffs
Hit it once, she recognize what the difference is
My bottom bitch don't even trip
She see me with other chicks
She hardly drink, but for me, she'll take a sip
Do what you gotta do to pay your rent
Only party with lame niggas at they expense
I'm talkin' good weed, steak and shrimp
Niggas runnin' off with styles that they ain't invent
Tried to grab a towel just to hide the scent
You smell the kush all through the vent
Go through the hallways lookin' innocent
I've been a gangster and a gentleman
Talk to the boss and not no middlemen
Is you with it or against it?
Please make a decision
Smoke a pound a day, eliminate the competition
I'm that nigga, been that nigga
Past and present tenses
You look good, I need a badder bitch to complement you

[Chorus]
You don't know
What you do to me lately
I got so much love for ya
Want you to know
How much that I fuck with you, oh
You don't know
What you do to me lately
Wanna roll one up for ya
Want you to come to the back of the club
Show some love to a real one

[Outro]
It's a gang thing, it's a gang thing
It's a gang thing, it's a gang thing
Don't do me like that
I'm a star too
Sledgro
Everywhere that we go
We blow it by the 0
The K.K., the smoke
