[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)

[Tinie Tempah]
I buy time in Switzerland
I drive round in Monaco
I shook hands with Royalty
I make songs that monarchs know
Ti Ti Ti La So fa?
Mi Mi Mi Ra Do?
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I Need That Dollar yo
Ha ha
Hic-hic-hiccup
Blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up
Now I'm ballin' like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck
And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up

Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a flight
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone
But I won't be gone for too long

[Tinie Tempah - Verse]
In Amsterdam, and Milan
Just came off Aussie tour
You've never seen this before?
I'm the one like 2 plus 3

M-M-M-Minus four
Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum
Everytime I can stalk
Yeh, yeh, I'm honest I landed in a rocket
With a crown inside my watch and silver B sign on my bonnet
You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest
Ip dip do muthaf-cker you are not it

Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
(check this haha, let's go!)

[Tinie Tempah]

I'm in it, i'm in it to the finish
I keep them bottles coming like my card ain't got no limit
Got some friends that play in football
And Some friends that play in cricket
And a mistress that is fine
Like a fu*king parking ticket
Ha-ha

I said I'm in it, I'm in it til the finish
I keep them bottles coming, til there ain't nutin' in it
I'm like mario on mushrooms
I'm like popeye on some spinach
We gon' keep it comin' til i no speakin' no English (Aahhhh)

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
