[Intro]
Nigga, my motherfuckin' life depends on this shit
Do this shit for my son
Turn me up
So I can hear myself a little more in the headphones

[Verse 1]
Came from the bottom, started this out with nothin'
Turned the fam in my squad, and turn this thing into somethin'
I grab a cone and I stuff it, never gon' get enough
Dependin' on how its goin', we only gonna get tougher
I done seen people suffer, hate turned into love
Lost some people to get here
But they watchin' us from up above
On the road, hardly ever home
And money caught one in the dome
Now its hard to even pick up my phone
Leave me alone, I'll be in my zone
I'm gettin' grown but not too grown to let my feelin's show
Anythin' you want, you can get, you gotta build it though
I blew up quick and lost some shit
But now I'm dealing though
There's consequences to every decision
Good or wrong, just do the best with time you're given and live strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Give your all 'cause a man gon' be a man
And do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
(This is rolling papers 2)
(This is rolling papers 2)

[Chorus]
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, all of the fame just comes with the game
It's a gift and a curse when everybody know your name
How do you make a million dollars and still stay the same
How do you make a hundred millions and still stay sane
You got the money, the clothes, the cars, the girls
Tryin' to do better, but all this shit's in your world
Somethin' regular would you prefer?
But it's cool, it's too much pressure, you think you should curve
On the verge, packin' up and goin' back to where I came from
Tired of these rappers, I only run in the lane once
Tired of these girls, we all fuckin' the same ones
I ain't givin' chances no more, I already gave one
Gettin' money, you better save some
Don't be afraid of mistakes 'cause you gotta make some

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes time, but a man gon'' be a man and do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
(This is rolling papers 2)
(This is rolling papers 2)

[Chorus]
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)

[Verse 3]
No turnin' back, I'm learnin' that
If you ever show someone love, you deserve it back
If you got an ounce and some papers, you should burn a pack
And if you ever do take a loss, you can earn it back
Never slack, never overreact, let your money stack
Look at where you're going and not where you at
You gon' get there if you work hard
When you make it, you'll get exactly what you work for
I want more, couple cars in my garage
And mansions with marble floors
A butler to open my doors
Couple plaques on the wall
Hoop court where my friends could ball
It may sounds strange but I'ma need it all
When I spend some afar, I hit the road when I get the call
Got some family members that I don't see at all

[Pre-Chorus]
It pays off 'cause a man gon'' be a man and do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
(This is rolling papers 2)
(This is rolling papers 2)

[Chorus]
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)
