[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I’ma get his whole motherfuckin’ family
And I ain’t playin’ with nobody
Fuck around and I’ma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I’ma get his whole motherfuckin’ family
And I ain’t playin’ with nobody
Fuck around and I’ma catch a body

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
Bitch I got the Mac or the 40
Turn a bitch to some macaroni
Tell me how you want it I’m on it
I really mean it I’m just not recording
Still a blow the choppa, for all you actors
Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta
You are an impostor, ain’t got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly
I really hate niggas I’m a Nazi
Love wearin’ all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I’m feelin’ Godly
Pop out like Coke, I ain’t gotta park it
Fuck is y’all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can’t get ‘em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won’t stop calling
IBGM, we the clique bitch you see us scoring
V.I.P in the club, while your section boring
Got a bitch that Set it Off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah
You rollin’ around with your nieces bitch you TeeTee
Mind full money, got a heart full of demons
Mobbin’ like Italians, we really take yo fingers
Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne
Have you singin’ like Alicia, fuck with my family
They be like you little, but got damn she spazzing
Do the whole crew, my bitches freak nasty

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I got multiple chains, a gang of old school
That I swear I don’t drive ‘less it don’t rain
Show you how to get the million, both lanes
When I switch, we gon’ blow the whole thing
That's a zip, bitch keep talking about
"Whats my favorite strain?
What’s my favorite part of the game?
The grind, or the fame?"
I told her as long as my nigga straight
We plotted this for less, now is number one albums
Niggas wasn’t sure, speculations about the outcome
Now what? More award shows, more oz's
More niggas tryna find out where I shop, when I get my clothes
Get a buzz and I put you on a roll, got a hundred rolled
Hear my car coming from the lobby
Taylor Gang over anybody

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
Bitch I got the Tommy no Hilfiger
Lil Dej ain’t about it, bitch how you figure
I don’t do no drugs, I be off liquor
So lifted, flyer than your girl, baby gone and take my picture
See I gotta get this money, my palms itchin’
Niggas gossip like hoes, most of ‘em bitches
I don’t wanna do no songs, I don’t wanna kick it
And I ain’t signing to no label, bitch I’m independent

[Chorus]
