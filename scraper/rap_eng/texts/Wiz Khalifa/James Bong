[Intro]
It's very clear
Ribbit
In it
Get it

[Hook]
James Bong I'm on a mission
Bruce Lee the way I kick it
Tiger Woods the way I hit it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Ah, you niggas finished
Damn, look how I whip it, how I whip it

[Verse]
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up
I'm in the kitchen
I make it flip, I make it flip
Just like a gymnast
I mix it up, I mix it up
Just like a chemist
You niggas know that I'm the realest
I'm with my squad and we the illest
I'm going hard, I'm 'bout my business
That bitch she on it, yeah she gifted
I'm in her mouth like I'm a dentist
I swear to god I be going hard
You would think part of my job is driving foreign cars
I'll be in it till I win it
Y'all could start it, I'mma finish

[Hook]
James Bong I'm on a mission
Bruce Lee the way I kick it
Tiger Woods the way I hit it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Ah, you niggas finished
Damn, look how I whip it, how I whip it
