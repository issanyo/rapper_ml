[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
This gon' be a wild night
Ridin' in my car, blowin' smoke
Want some heat, that's what it sound like
Bouncin' 'cause I'm in my low-low
She can be my girl, she can be my girlfriend
I just want the world, I could rule the world, man
Everything I want is mine
Ask if I'm okay, and I say I'm mighty fine

[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I just fucked yo' bitch, yeah
I just smoked a whole damn zip
I just took a sip, yeah
I came with my whole damn clique

This gon' be a wild night, got 'em like
This gon' be a wild night (wild, wild night)
This gon' be a wild night, got 'em like

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Shit get wild, I smoke loud, your shit mild, that ain't my style
Your bitch wanna have my child, ain't that against your wedding vow?
Shawty wanna lick my crown, I'm a king, take a bow
Juicy J don't fuck around, brand new Rollie, bust it down
All this smoke, that's a pound, call my car the smoker's lounge
Copy now, got too much sauce, you'll fuck around and drown
And all these niggas bitin' off the Three Six sound
But you bitches know the difference, y'all a bunch of clowns
You a worker, I'm a boss, that shit fake, knock it off
I just left with all these bitches, need some help to fuck 'em all
Drink on ice, wrist on frost, she was like, "What's the cost?"
All night she top me off, I gave her pipe, no exhaust

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
This gon' be a wild night
This gon' be a wild night, got 'em like
This gon' be a wild night
This gon' be a wild night, got 'em like
This gon' be a wild night (wild, wild night)
This gon' be a wild night, got 'em like
This gon' be a wild night (wild, wild night)
This gon' be a wild night, got 'em like

[Verse 3: Lil Peep]
Woke up, fucked up, thought it was a dream (thought it was a dream)
GothBoi pulled up, Hummer limousine (Hummer limousine)
Life fucked up, Lil Peep poppin' beans (poppin' beans)
Life fucked up, droppin' candy in my lean (candy in my lean)
GothBoiClique in the club, in the back (in the back)
Shawty in all black, and you know I like that (like that)
Ten toes down, I got Louis on my bag (Louis on my bag)
Pull up on your bitch in the GothBoi Jag (GothBoi Jag)
I just fucked a goth bitch, yeah
Shawty sucked my whole damn clique (ooh)
You be on some opp shit, damn (yeah)
You can suck my GothBoi dick, ayy

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]

This gon' be a wild night, got 'em like
