[Intro]
Yeah, I'ma need the whole thing
Justize
Not half, I want the whole thing
We gon' take that
Put a few O's in there
Turn a couple of them around
And voila
Matter fact, we gon' have them everywhere
Yeah, bitch, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm rolling up another joint soon as the weeds gone
You ain't on gas, it just seems strong
You ain't a boss unless your team on
You niggas going broke, you need someone to lean on
Young rich nigga from the burgh
Said I was gon' make it and meant every word
I remember I was getting curved
Always back it up, 'cause actions speak louder than words
I be outta state growing strains
I be smoking ounces to the brain (strong)
I be pulling up with one rolled
Just say my name if you wanna smoke

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now that shits legal, you know exactly what the fuck I been talking 'bout

Now you want some huh, ok I got you

[Verse 2]
Roll the paper, I ain't smoking blunts
O a day, That's two pounds a month
Put it in my lungs and then I'm good
Only smoking fire like I should
Used to deal with niggas tryna tax
Now I'm throwin' pounds and growing them back
Multi million dollars in the safe (mills)
Homie I been getting it from the gate
Pushing weight outta state
Putting big ass orders up on my plate
See, you was down to stand in line, I couldn't wait
You must not heard about the amount I'm finna make
