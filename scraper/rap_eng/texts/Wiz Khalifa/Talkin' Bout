[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Rack after rack, I got the sack
Geeked up off beans, pack after pack (yeah, hoe)
Stay with the nina, 2 cups and a zip
Juicy don't fight, I just empty them clips (yeah, hoe)
Blowin' like cash, high off the gas
Pay 20 stacks and they run up and blast (yeah, hoe)
Next time you see him this face on the shirt
Next time car he ride in, stretch limo hearse (yeah, hoe, he gone)
See why you niggas mad, nigga, that to me you so cash, nigga (bitch)
Stuffed in a Louis bag, nigga, Juicy J be that nigga (bitch, hoe)
Big bag of that stank killer, codeine in my drink, killer (cash, dash)
Mostly niggas be lyin' sayin' they is but ain't killers (pussies)
Nigga wanna play with me, I'ma break him off
Give my youngin's, they'll do it, I'ma bring 'em off (get 'em)
They gon' get on your ass then they flyin' takin' off (get 'em)
Nigga, we gon' take a life before we take a loss

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
My diamonds sing like Ray J, homie, every day’s a payday
Rollin' up that KK, now it’s goin' down like mayday
All my niggas be chillin', stackin' money to the ceilin'
Used to smokin' out the parkin' lot, now we ownin' a buildin', ooh
Used to tell niggas I was gon' be here but they ain't really understand
Now they see me in that brand new 'rari and start to think I'm the man
Now my jeans cost a grand, now my shows fill the stands
Now they see that I'm ballin' 'cause of how they bring in them bands, ooh
Now when niggas be tourin', now my money be foreign
All my niggas be scorin', section very important
I'm cakin' up, you fakin' up, I'm rollin' weed when I'm wakin' up
Instead of talkin' shit and try to hate on us, just grab a joint and come bake with us

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa, Juicy J & Chris Brown]
I'm loadin' up and I'm ridin' out, they talkin' shit but they hidin' out (fuck nigga)
Real niggas know what I'm talkin' 'bout (hahaha, uh)
I'm loadin' up and I'm ridin' out, they talkin' shit but they hidin' out
Real niggas know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm loadin' up and I'm ridin' out, they talkin' shit but they hidin' out
Real niggas know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm loadin' up and I'm ridin' out, they talkin' shit but they hidin' out
Real niggas know what I'm talkin' 'bout (look, okay, okay)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Front page, I'm on the news, nigga call me a dropout (ah)
Real nigga, 100, never needin' no copout (nah)
Diamonds on my chain just pop off, you already know what I'm 'bout (ow, haha)
Got bad bitches from overseas but I need a big ass from the south (ow)
Look at us, we made it, bottles up in the air now (yeah)
25 racks a night, give a fuck about sweatin' your hair out
Getting trippy man with some frisky things, I am the shit and you niggas anus (yeah)
If I mention y'all, I'ma make you famous, but you still ain't nothin', I'm stainless
We famous, anythin' you want right now, baby girl, just name it
And I'ma get real deep in the pussy, the number one nigga, ain't no need for replacement
Gettin' in my spaceship, I'm high as a bitch, fly as a bitch
Okay, Juicy J and Wiz, every day we do this shit

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I'm loadin' up and I'm ridin' out, they talkin' shit but they hidin' out
Real niggas know what I'm talkin' 'bout
