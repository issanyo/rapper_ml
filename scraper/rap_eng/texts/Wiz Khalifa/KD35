[Hook: Chevy Woods]
I pull up with the roof off
If he trippin' blow his roof off
The plug shipped it in a U-haul
Kevin Durant money that's too tall
I'm Taylor Gang and I don't know ya'll
I bought all these diamonds just to show off
Double cup let's have a slow off
Where ever we at bitch we gon' ball

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
I'm ballin', ballin', ballin' all this money that be calling
Call my jets set niggas catch a flight out to New Orleans
Tourin', tourin, tourin all this money off of touring
They don't book you niggas cus that shit you doin is boring
I'm caking up with my nigga Leaf [?] on my street
I'm blowing strong and you niggas weak
You run up on us we think it's sweet
Down 48 and that's double o
Hundred niggas I gotta show
Green light you gotta go
Coke guns they let em blow
Ballin' out we ain't fallin' out and that's on the real
Get you chick with us, she don't wander but she red to go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, comin' down used to be the main one look up but I run it now
Rollin' up weed see the champagne corks and my team know it's going down
Nigga talk crazy pull up in a [?]
[?] put them in your town fuck nigga so you get the run around
My bitch is exotic, my whip is exotic you hating I think it's ironic
You looking for kush then I got it the weed I'm smoking is chronic
My niggas make money off trappin'
So they cook that
I made a million dollars of rapping
And I look back
Weed, lean and wax up in this book bag
My nigga caught some charges for the pack and fucking shook that
He come home we gon' (turn up)

[Hook]
