[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
I ain't apologizing for shit
I do what I want, and JoJo does too, uh

[Verse 1: JoJo]
Saw it in your eyes when you said goodbye
You didn't even try, so this time I don't care

[Pre-Chorus 1: JoJo]
And honestly I was just about to pick up the phone
And then I realized that I didn't do nothing wrong
You would even tell two lies to prove that you were right
Usually I'd go on and take the blame but not this time, not this time

[Chorus: JoJo]
What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
Fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
If I, if I, if I really meant it

[Verse 2: JoJo]
I can't help that you, feel the way you do
Try not to get confused cause this time I don't care

[Pre-Chorus 2: JoJo]
And honestly I was just about to pick up the phone
And then I realized that I didn't do nothing wrong
Didn't do nothing wrong, ayy

[Chorus: JoJo]
What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
Fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
If I, if I, if I really meant it

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay, uh, no apologizing
Ain't no way to take the things you did back or disguise it
Always wonder what I'm doing but that's TMI
Don't know what you got until it's gone, now you realize it
When I wasn't playing smart now I'm being wise
Finally I'm moving on and I don't need your lies
And it wasn't even tough cause I can see the signs
Now you're stuck, call an Uber up if you need a ride

[Chorus: JoJo]
What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
(I don't mean it baby)
Fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
(I know)
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
What you want from me?
(I'm not sorry)
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
Fuck apologies
(Not saying it)
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I would have said sorry a long time ago...
If I, if I, if I really meant it

[Outro: JoJo]
If I, if I, if I really meant it
