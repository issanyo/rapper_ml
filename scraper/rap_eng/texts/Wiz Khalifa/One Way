[Verse 1 (Wiz Khalifa)]
All I ever wanted was lights, camera, action
People staring at night, cameras flashin'
Living the movie not prepared to see the last scene
All I want is the pretty women for the casting
Won't confront him, put your money where your mask is
You a chump, talk guns, but scared to blast his
Buy them bottles by the case, we don't gotta chase
For the love of money, we in a million dollar race
Windows done tinted, niggas hate em, but I fish bowl
So I can let your ho see me while I'm in it, yeah
See I ain't got a deal
But everybody know that I ain't kinda real
I'm hundred dollar bill authentic, yeah
Hotel room, marijuana's in it
Chevy watchin' the game, your bitch she rollin' me planes
Passport payin my dividence for the fame
Mind in the gutter, you niggas ain't in my lane
(Fool)

[Hook (Courtney Noelle)]
This is not the life I chose, but it's the life that chose me
The money's got me everywhere that all these hoes be
And they can talk crazy cause they don't know me
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming
The party hoes, the cars and clothes, living life is all I know
I found my lane and I won't change for nothing
There's only one way to go

[Verse 2 (Wiz Khalifa)]
Now they cop the mixtapes and watch my videos
Maybe cause I got bars like a serial... code
Louie pouch full of pre-rolled
Mouth full of kush, mind on my zero
Hoes always thought I was cute but wouldn't speak though
Now they see me they be jocking on my steelo
On a private ride higher than a ski slope
I'm just flyin', haters try and cut my wings though, whoa
Now they see us and wanna be us
I'm partyin' poppin' bottles
With models to meet and greet us
Fuck her, follow, and then retweet us
In the sky, so my nigga keep up

[Courtney Noelle & Wiz Khalifa]
I don't know where this road will go, cause my life is crazy (Fuckin' hoes, everywhere we go)
But I ain't changin', baby (This shit, you burn after you roll)

[Hook:]
This is not the life I chose, but it's the life that chose me

I found my lane and I won't change for nothing
