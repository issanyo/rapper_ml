[Verse 1]
Long money, hopes and dreams
Always be around them niggas wit paper but got your own money
It's yo world, buy this drink for you girl
You said tell the DJ play this song for me
Heres my number case you ever need company
Better weed tons of drink, love the way I dress, let her rub my ink
Hell yeah, I'm fly, that's why they all beneath, me

[Hook]
That money fall and she make dough
I'm giving her all she can take though
And you know we ball but this ain't no game no
I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for
Yeah that's what we came for
Throwing my money when I see you every time she gettin low, low, low
Foot on the gas when I see you yeah cause she ready to go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Throw it in the air watch that paper fall
Don't know how much I came here with
End of the night, shit, she gon take it all
See them diamonds in my chain
You ain't gotta know my name
Rushing to the bar, I need another round of drinks
Then it's to my car, puff a pound of dank
Now we in the stars, and I'mma make it rain
Drown the sink

[Hook]
That money fall and she make dough
I'm giving her all she can take though
And you know we ball but this ain't no game no
I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for
Yeah that's what we came for
Throwing my money when I see you every time she gettin low, low, low
Foot on the gas when I see you yeah cause she ready to go, go, go, go

[Verse 3]
Pay for your own clothes, fly on your own trips
You a big girl, you buy your own shit
Supply your own smoke, you like your own zip
No leasing yours, you like to own shit

Throwing my money when I see you every time she gettin low, low, low
Foot on the gas when I see you yeah cause she ready to go, go, go, go

[Outro]
I'm throwing money up and watching her go round and round
Watching her go round and round
I'm throwing money up and watching it come down, come down
Watching it come down, come down
And we can go to my house or we can go to your crib
We can jump in your car, you can see how I live
But I'm still throwing money up
So much I'm losing count, can't count
So much I'm losing count, can't count
