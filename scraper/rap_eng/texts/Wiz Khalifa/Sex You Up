[Verse 1: Lyrica Anderson:]
I wanna do somethin' to you, somethin' illegal
Step in the room breakin' the rules, let's make a freak show

[Pre-Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
My love all up in your face, make you feel some type away
Tell me you wanted to play, boy, I've been ballin' all day
You gone up and do it, I'm poured up just right
Know it's goin' down tonight

[Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up
I'm feelin' on you, you feelin' on me
It feels so good, my baby
Keep sippin' on me, I'm sippin' on you
Like I should
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa:]
Uh, tryna break that habit, but I run right through you
Tryna take you slow, but I run right to you
Take you down and get licked, I could taste you all on my lips
Brought some dank to roll with my clique
This that bomb shit that you gon' miss
When I'm in you you keep tellin' me that it's so good
But your home girls keep tellin' you that I'm no good
Ehe-ehe-ehe-ehe

[Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up
I'm feelin' on you, you feelin' on me
It feels so good, my baby
Keep sippin' on me, I'm sippin' on you
Like I should
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up

[Verse 3: Lyrica Anderson:]
I'll let you taste, keep up the pace, no need to slow it down
Cause one ain't enough, if you can keep up, we'll go another round

[Pre-Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
My love all up in your face, make you feel some type away
Tell me you wanted to play, boy, I've been ballin' all day
You gone up and do it, I'm poured up just right
Know it's goin' down tonight

[Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up
I'm feelin' on you, you feelin' on me
It feels so good, my baby
Keep sippin' on me, I'm sippin' on you
Like I should
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up, ooh
When I sex you up
