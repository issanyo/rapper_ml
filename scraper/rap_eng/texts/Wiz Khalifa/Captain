[Chorus]
Uh
One shot, two shots
I done mixed McQueen with the Blue Dot
Thug life, 2Pac
Smoke me a J' on the roof top
Champagne, campaign
Spend a whole day on a airplane
Barely get my team on the airplane
Barely get my luggage on the airplane
Looking at me like Captain
They treat me, like Captain
Know where I'm goin' like Captain
Show up when I want like Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain

[Verse]
Uh
What's happenin? What's happenin?
I can hit the trap make it back-flip
What's happenin? What's happenin?
I done made a million, off rappin'
What's happenin? What's happenin?
I could fuck ya bitch, no cappin'
Niggas think they real til they lackin'
You ain't gettin' money 'less you stackin'
Niggas hate me I imagine
No I don't do shit average
In a minute I'ma get shit smackin'
Upfront we ain't dealing with no back end
What's happenin? What's happenin?
All these niggas really care about is fashion
Don't even ask to hit the weed, you ain't matchin'
How they gang? Is the question that I'm askin'

[Chorus]
One shot, two shots
I done mixed McQueen with the Blue Dot
Thug life, 2Pac
Smoke me a J' on the roof top
Champagne, campaign
Spend a whole day on a airplane
Barely get my team on the airplane
Barely get my luggage on the airplane
Looking at me like Captain
They treat me, like Captain
Know where I'm goin' like Captain
Show up when I want like Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain

[Chorus]
One shot, two shots
I done mixed McQueen with the Blue Dot
Thug life, 2Pac
Smoke me a J' on the roof top
Champagne, campaign
Spend a whole day on a airplane
Barely get my team on the airplane
Barely get my luggage on the airplane
Looking at me like Captain
They treat me, like Captain
Know where I'm goin' like Captain
Show up when I want like Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
Everywhere I go I'm a Captain
