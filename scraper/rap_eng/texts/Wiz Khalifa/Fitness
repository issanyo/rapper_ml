[Chorus: 24hrs]
She said, "Twenty, I'm your witness
You been in the gym, you on a marijuana fitness
And you would never guess what I’ve been through
Because of that, I would never lie to you"
I-I-I was never trippin' on forgiveness
Lately it's a marijuana fitness
Strong pack, marijuana fitness
There’s not a day without a marijuana fitness (Woah)

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
I've been smokin' on paper planes
I just bought a house, it's in my name
I ain't never changed, I'm the same
I'm just waitin' on my Taylor Gang chain, woah
Balenciaga problems, you won’t understand my problems
I push to start this week, you don’t wanna fuck with me
I want to be the greatest
Makin' money, but still ain’t made it
Damn, it feel like shit done shifted
It's a marijuana fitness
Damn, shawty really want a gift from me
Woah, 20 thousand right in Tiffany
If I say I love you
Then that just means I do
If we smoke some weed together
Then me and you gon' eat together, woah

[Chorus: 24hrs & Wiz Khalifa]
She said, "Twenty, I'm your witness
You been in the gym, you on a marijuana fitness
And you would never guess what I’ve been through
Because of that, I would never lie to you"
I-I-I was never trippin' on forgiveness
Lately it's a marijuana fitness
Strong pack, marijuana fitness (Yeah)
There's not a day without a marijuana fitness (Woah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
My weed in the store (Store)
Money in the bank, but my health is more important
My whip got two doors (Doors), my crib got three floors (Floors)
My bitch badder than yours (Ooh, yeah)
When you makin' it, don't take too long before you break the bread
Some niggas real, some niggas fakin'
I try to be on point, so niggas who look up to me do what I did (Did)
And turned out to be something great
You sleepin', I'm stayin' awake (Yeah)
Just spent the weekend out the country, can't say what I made (Made)
Became a boss, learned to balance the pay with the game (Game)
They squint they eyes tryna read what it say on my chain (Chain)
I always ride for my team, never slave for the fame
And that's realer
They don't look at me as just a drug dealer
I handle business (Biz)
Stay up out my way and out your feelings (Fuck how you feel)

[Chorus: 24hrs]
She said, "Twenty, I'm your witness
You been in the gym, you on a marijuana fitness
And you would never guess what I've been through
Because of that, I would never lie to you"
I-I-I was never trippin' on forgiveness
Lately it's a marijuana fitness
Strong pack, marijuana fitness
There's not a day without a marijuana fitness (Woah)
