[Verse 1: Ariez Onasis]
Top back, System bangin'
Made enough of this money to quit complaining
But still I ain't made enough of it to quit the gaming
Hit the cayman, cop the telly that's where the bitches hanging
Nice room I'm bugging wait 'til you hear the price
Top floor she overcoming her fear of heights
Caught the wave she got motion sickness
Promise her paradise, and watch her settle for a pair of nikes
Poppin' that killa can't get enough of this skrilla
The papers the pina colada, the dutchess vanilla
They don't come any reala' I can handle the belt
Play the hand I was dealt, won't bluff any dealer
Hoes on my parlay fuck 'em the fair way
They wanna get to know me,my name is more then I care to tell
I'm just tellin' the truth, raising hell in the booth
Gotta make it to heaven,come back and skip through the sabbath

[Pre-Chorus: Planet VI]
Linger roll 'em smoke until it's gone
Lay my head down baby I'm a rolling stone
Stoned ,drunk won't remember nothing in the mor'
I'mma do this 'til I'm dead and gone

[Chorus: Planet VI]
Smoke weed, fuck bitches
Stunt hard all you lame ass niggas
I got one life I'mma live it
I'mma live my life with no limits

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Make it back tomorrow don't care how much I spend
Think I'm a G wait 'til you meet my friends
A beast I've been now they wait on line
'Til I sign their CD for them I am
All who question sleep on him
Eating good soup don't leave a piece for them
We gon' smoke bomb trees, drink some gin
Couldn't walk in my shoes, know what your feet fit in
Since I been off the leash like I had a couple of drinks
Watch my buzz increase , now we twistin' up sipping champainge
On a beach, what either gets in our game go deceased nigga,nigga
Right about now

[Pre-Chorus: Planet VI]
Linger roll 'em smoke until it's gone
Lay my head down baby I'm a rolling stone
Stoned ,drunk won't remember nothing in the mor'
I'mma do this 'til I'm dead and gone

[Chorus: Planet VI]
Smoke weed, fuck bitches
Stunt hard all you lame ass niggas
I got one life I'mma live it
I'mma live my life with no limits

[Verse 3: Planet VI]
I came from nothing I won my money making machines
I'm selling raps cause there ain't no escaping the fiends
All over the map just me and my caribbean team
A few from Atlanta, my other niggers repping the B
High definition it seems like we live on the screen
Not cause it's clear as day , because me and my niggers be clean
We stay fly haters hate when we step on the scene
Cause we young black and living the american dream
Ok ,ok this is what I do Planet VI off in this thing
So is Wiz Khalifa too
Shout out to the homie AO the world don't have a clue
To what's about to happen homie I'm just waiting on my queue
The gun don't get 'em, pray that they don't let 'em
That nigga be goin' in who the fuck is y'all telling
I plan to ride this motherfucker 'til the wheels broke
Thought I was selling crack while
Listening back like that shit came out real dope

[Chorus: Planet VI]
Smoke weed, fuck bitches
Stunt hard all you lame ass niggas
I got one life I'mma live it
I'mma live my life with no limits
