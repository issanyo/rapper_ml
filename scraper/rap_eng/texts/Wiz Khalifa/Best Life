[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Ask me how I feel, I say, "I feel alright"
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)
Ask me how I feel, I say, "I feel alright"
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooouuu
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)
Ooouuu
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I got that Hemi in my whip, so I can't slow it down
I got MacQueen in my cup, so it's going down
I got that KK in my joint, so you know it's going 'round
I get up on the track an show you how it's supposed to sound
I come to your town, money get found
Them 'lil niggas want a ounce, I'm 'bout to roll a pound
Niggas hate, where the bank? I don't fuck with y'all
Keep it real, fuck the fake shit, sex doll

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Ask me how I feel, I say, "I feel alright"
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)
Ask me how I feel, I say, "I feel alright"
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooouuu
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)
Ooouuu
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)

[Verse 2: Sosamann]
Hey
"How do you feel?"
My nigga, I told you, I'm great
I'm hittin' the gas, no brake
These niggas, they sad and they hate
While I'm tryna make cash, walk out of the safe
The Ps come from out of estate
Grinded all of my life, but I do not skate
I used to play ball in the crate
Now I ball in the mall with half of my weight (hey)
I'm just out living my life (ooh)
Diamonds they bright and they bite (ayy)
Remember running from the buzz?
Now I perform in front of the lights
Look busy, I'm short, they like the knife (ayy)
Eating the steak with the rice (woah)
Water with no pipe
Yeah, that'd be a wonderful night

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Sosamann]
Ask me how I feel, I say, "I feel alright"
(Hey, hey, woo)
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)
Ask me how I feel, I say, "I feel alright"
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooouuu
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)
Ooouuu
I'm just out here tryna live my best life (best life)
