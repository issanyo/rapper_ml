[Hook x2: Kev Tha Hustla]
Come here to the go down
Go down, know now
What! It's the life of a hustla mothafucka
Box me cuz I ain't discussing a mothafucka
Click clack cuz I ain't trusting a mothafucka

[Verse 1: Kev Tha Hustla]
It's picture perfect
Semi up in my surface
What your hands shaking for is there reasons you should be nervous?
Probably got a wire, niggas tell to reduce time
So I don't really talk if you ain't part of my squad [?]
Some other niggas all be forced to sleep with [?]
Be like New York city weed up in a plastic case
Get a plate, I'm a vet sitting bags of A's
Then gold ball the city, cuz the Hustla in me
Will drop dimes on the block like a snitch do
But for telling man they'll probably stitch you
You should strip dude when you see them hammers out
Feet first T shirt read and let grammar out
Why cuz I said so, Timbs and a camo
You kids ever need help, let a grown man know
This grown man flow, you piss on yourself
16 in the (BANG), extra one on the belt, holla

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yo it's the youngin with the hardest flow
Dumb fuckers oughta know
I chief puff a lot of dro
Creep with a lot of hoes
You chumps suck, I'm uncut like the rawest coke
And fuck rhymes when it's crunch time your whole squad'll choke
The whole block bananas
To get [?] I stay by myself and hit the block for grammar
Yeah I'm a beast dog, and you should watch where your feet walk
Cuz every time I rhyme you hear the streets talk
And my homies do clap these boys
Body in the alleyway, you a backstreet boy
Pistolvania where they clap these toys
I'm the kid with the damager flow
Cock back, and I'll damage a ho
And any one of y'all want it, y'all get it
Bang through your fitted I'm leaving your brain splitted
Stay spitting flame about whipping and change getting
Came in the game man fucking the age difference
