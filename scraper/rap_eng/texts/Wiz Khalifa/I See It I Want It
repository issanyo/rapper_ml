I used to sleep on the floor
Now I can sleep with your hoe
Now I can sleep with a couple bitches you’d never get to know
I seen her I want her I got her
Fucked her and don’t know shit bout her
I ain’t even gotta say shit to the bitch and I fuck around and get some dough out her
Stay down like a lowrider, now I might smoke a lil louder
200 Thou’ when i slide up, bitch wanna fuck I ain’t even gotta bribe her
Made it out the hood I survived it, but then i'll still be grindin
Thats why I still be shining, riding around in all these diamonds
But hatin’ just make me greater, I ain’t gone chance I’mma get this paper
All this sauce nigga all this flavor
All these hundreds look at all these layers
I make it look E like a layup
Nigga weigh up I’mma stay up
Nigga owe me bread better pay up
Put this shit together nigga everything taylor

I used to sell bags of Dro, now I get pounds for the low
No I don't buy it, I grow,  I turned your Wife into a ho
Your money still coming slow, y'all hate but ain't comin' close Do anything for The Doe
Run in your crib, take off your clothes
If ever my bank getting low
My niggas pulled up and they grabbing their masks
Your girl looked out on the low
She ain't fuckin you then she getting cash
These niggas in the way bruh they ain't gon last
I make a bitch go back to her ratchet past
Drinkin' smokin' in the club when you don't think it's open
Got you passin' out cause this weed is potent
These Niggas start reppin' the gang
These girls they look at his chain
Always been a real nigga dawg that ain't gone change
