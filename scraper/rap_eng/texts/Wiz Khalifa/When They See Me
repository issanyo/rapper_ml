[Intro]
Yeah
(Green Lantern)
It's young Wiz
Uh-huh
A lot of niggas hatin', you know?
It's young Wiz
I'm doing this Pittsburgh shit
Putting it on the map
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
It's young Wiz
Uh-huh
A lot of niggas hatin', you know?
It's young Wiz
I'm doing this Pittsburgh shit
Putting it on the map
Uh-huh, you know
But I ain't worried about these niggas I got mad
You know? Them motherfuckers look stupid as hell
I'm out here gettin' money, 412
Lot of niggas mad
I see y'all niggas when I pull up
Yeah, they be like —

[Verse]
Goddamn, that's a fly young nigga
The smoke smell different, that's a high young nigga
And I heard he work hard, got a half-million rhymes
And my bitch hit his MySpace a half-million times
I laugh and get high, gettin' straight to the money
And keep my goons 'round for any fake nigga want it
'Cause niggas out here see you eatin' and take yours
That's why I'm in the lab and Big Breeze got the 8 for
A lot of y'all ain't got no cheese
Nothin' better else to do, that's why you talk 'bout me
I'm always on your girl mind, she think a lot 'bout me
But if it ain't about the money then it's not 'bout me
I be in 11:30, leaving out 'bout 3
Shawty ain't givin' me nothing, kick her out my 'vee
I live like a young rap star
Grind like a trap star
Couple came at the kid
But they ain't make it that far
V.I.P., that's what I'm sitting in the back for
Rollin' up grape, pull it straight up out the glass jar
Puff, puff, puff
And blow a little smoke out
Skinny little nigga, but my pockets all chunked out
A lot of y'all on my shit now didn't
Think Pittsburgh had a chance 'til they heard young Wiz
So I came and I put the city's name on me
Niggas got the nerve to hate on me —
Fuck y'all
I'm ridin' down the parkway doin' a buck, dawg
A bad little bitch, and somethin' to puff on
All you hatin' motherfuckers got somethin' to suck on
Just let a young'n do my thang, and I'm gone

[Interlude]
(Yeah man, this nigga wanna try to come at me the other day
Tryna hate on my man Wiz!
I had to shut this nigga down from the door
Let him know, man, that nigga's hot right here
That nigga's the truth
Quit hatin' — Fuck outta here)

[Outro]
I always stay fly
Niggas get mad if I come by
When they see me
When they see me
(Weeze)
Yeah...
My money gettin' right
They got jealousy in they eyes
When they see me
When they see me
