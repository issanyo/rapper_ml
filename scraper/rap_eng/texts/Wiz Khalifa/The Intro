SIXELA: "Ladies & Gentlemen
You are now listening to the 'Before Anything' mixtape starring Sixela Aviles. Patience Is A Virtue, yet Time Is of The Essence!"

[V1]:
I should be happy bout what I got
Cuz foreign countries think I got a lot
I got some family members from Brazil
& they all think that my equipment is ill
& all of my swag is super trill
My lil cousin asked me How Do I Feel?
I told lil man, to keep it real
I feel so blessed like I just copped a deal
But I ain't even famous
In fact I'm on that 'lame' shit
When it come to my country they think I'm on that 'gay' shit
But when it come to my city, the bitches show me titties
& the niggas steady pressing' replay on my straight hits!
That's ironic
In ten years, i'll be iconic
Rollin up fast just like sonic
Smoking on chronic
All in your electronics
