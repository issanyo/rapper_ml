[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Higher than you ever been in your motherfuckin' life nigga
Without even tryin'

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
The game got a grip, never slip
Can tell by the way I got my hands on it
Started at the bottom but now my money is so motherfuckin' tall I can stand on it
Ain't just happened homie I planned on it
You think you better don't just talk 'bout it put some grands on it
Sleep in Cali woke up in France on 'em
Took the life I live chose talk about it now my fans on it
Now is Dior all on my pants homie
Don't know where I'm going my schedule full so I can't call it
So much weed you see all them grams fallin'
Rollin' so much up that my fingers startin' to cramp on me
Hear you talkin' 'bout what I am
On top of that shit you sayin' you gotta say rich as fuck when you mention us
I get a hold of the bombest weed and I twist it up
Them Cadillacs in line out front just to pick us up

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
I woke up to a joint, cartoons and cereal
A coupe with zero miles and oatmeal interior
These chicks diggin' my style
I'm sincerely superior to whatever your doing right now
And whatever your plannin' to get into
I'm just clockin' my miles
On the road to these riches, these hoes wavin' and smilin'
But I don't pay 'em no attention, I'm all about my empire
We just trying to get bigger, we multiplying in size
These snakes trying to get with us, they lookin' for the co-sign
But a real nigga don't give a fuck, I'm too busy gettin' high
You can hitch a ride on another truck
Now excuse me as I kiss the sky
Peace signs to baby girl before she try to kiss me bye
She miss me like the sun in her eyes, can't catch a pop fly
Kush castles in the sky
The only hassle is when I smash and go she want to cry
I get dressed she wanna know where I'm going and why
Can't deal with that
