(Pittsburgh)
No questions asked
412
Ain't even nothin to fuckin debate about
Let's get it

[Hook]
You think you do it big?
I guarantee I do it bigger
I'm all about my money
Yeah, I'm all about my figures
I'm screamin fuck the law
Til the Lord come and get us
And a nigga goin hard, dog
So y'all ain't fuckin wit him
Know why, know why?
Cause I'm, that, nigga
Go on ask about me
I'm, that, nigga; know why, know why?
Cause I'm, that, nigga
Go on ask about me
I'm, that, nigga; know why, know why?
Cause I'm, that, nigga

[Verse 1]
And I know you hate it
Never needed a handout, unlike most who made it
And y'all close to faded
You see how I get my grind on
Now my shine on
I don't know what shade is
Damn
And errybody know what my name is
Goin off what I been told I'm sorta famous
Trips to foreign places
When niggas found out that Warner laced us
I wish to God I coulda saw they faces
We in the money race, and
Me? I'm gonna chase it
We done made it to the top floor from the basement
This for my cousin, lil Hot Boy stuck in placement
Time is money, so we not really gon waste it
I'm on the road
Gettin my chavo
And niggas wanna hate
But they just listen and nod though
I rhyme that sicker
And fire that spliff up
So fuck what you heard bout me
I'm that nigga

[Hook]
You think you do it big?
I guarantee I do it bigger
I'm all about my money
Yeah I'm all about my figures
I'm screamin fuck the law
Til the Lord come and get us
And a nigga goin hard, dog
So y'all ain't fuckin with him
Know why, know why?
Cause I'm, that, nigga
Go on ask about me
I'm, that, nigga; know why, know why?
Cause I'm, that, nigga
Go on ask about me
I'm, that, nigga; know why, know why?
Cause I'm, that..

[Verse 2]
Ay, ay
And you ain't heard otherwise
I'm one hunned here, nothin like them other guys
Just talkin money-wise
That's all that makes sense
I'm on my 8th spliff-status, on some great shit
But never felt the need to fall back
Niggas gettin all lax
So come and take in all that
Now your fam a big fan of the tall cat
And my Pittsburgh tat match the ballcap
Hatin and all that'll get ya ass nowhere
And if I'm in the spot then guarantee I'mma blow there
My future is so clear, the sky is the limit
They hear me rappin, say "This young guy here is gifted"
28 weeks nigga; I am the sickest
Young motherfucker that's alive and is kickin
Fire a spliff and, roll another Swisher
You ain't gotta ask about me --
You know I'm that nigga

[Chorus]
You do it big?
I guarantee I do it bigger
I'm all about my money
Yeah I'm all about my figures
I'm screamin fuck the law
Til the Lord come and get us
And a nigga goin hard, dog
So y'all ain't fuckin with him
Know why, know why?
Cause I'm, that, nigga
Go on ask about me
I'm, that, nigga; know why, know why?
Cause I'm, that, nigga
Go on ask about me
I'm, that, nigga; know why, know why?
Cause
