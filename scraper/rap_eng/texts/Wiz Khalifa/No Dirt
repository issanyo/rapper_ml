[Intro]
Mhm
Let me talk to you
Show you something that you probably seen before, but you never seen it like this

[Verse 1]
Physically fit, smoking that shit you can't get
If it don't make dollars, then well it don't make sense
Got my crib out in Cali, buy everything for my kid
You hear me talk about it, fuckin' right, it's what I live
Lean back, hit the chronic
She like "Why it so intense?"
I say don't "Don't worry 'bout it, keep your mind up on these chips"
And these niggas out plotting
They broke so they got something against us
Pot, we smoke it anywhere

[Chorus]
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw

[Verse 2]
Don't get to a comfortable point
And back off
Gotta be sharp, the game's filled with whack artists
I ain't hating on you dawg, get yours
But don't ever think I'm convinced
These eyes covered by lenses
'Cause I'm probably high as your rent
See the Forbes list, think it got him content
But I'm not, I'm still hustling hard
Won't let my paper stop

[Chorus]
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw

[Outro]
I want some of that damn KK man
Some of that Khalifa Kush, man
Y'all niggas smoking OG Kush
I want Khalifa Kush, man
For'real
The one with that man name on it, man
For'real man, I'm tryna inhale that one time, man
For'real
