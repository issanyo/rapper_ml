[Intro]
Oh
It's kinda crazy 'cause
People think
I got it made just 'cause I got paper
I mean
I do got it made but
That's 'cause I made it myself
Gang Gang

[Verse 1]
Uh, people be all in my face
Wasn't the time and the place
Do interviews and I'm on stage
'Cause baby I gotta get paid
Don't matter what most people say
'Cause all of 'em get in the way
I'm working with more than I play
Which mean I'm gon' be here to stay
I roll me one up and I blaze
And take a tree straight to the face
Those thuggers keep hoping I change
But no, I'ma stay in my lane
I'm smelling like weed on the plane
And white people think it's a shame
As soon as they mention my name
They go back to being the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I did everything that I want (uh)
I still don't really care what anybody else think
Now I can have anything, I ain't gon' stunt
And I don't feel bad 'cause I did it my way
And now they all say

"It must be nice, it must be nice
To have them Washingtons on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have everybody on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have them Washingtons by your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have everybody by your side"

[Verse 2]
Whether you coming or leaving
Know everybody be talking
Nigga be having a problem
Straighten up soon as you walking
Some of them familiar faces
Fame is so easy to get lost in
So many different motives
If you slip up it'll cost you
Don't know who got your best interest
But you don't stop, you keep going
They really talking, you live it
When the time come you gon' show it
Keep on my heart and stay focused
Come with a different approaching
Go from a player to coach be
'Cause you go harder than most

[Pre-Chorus]
I did everything that I want (uh)
I still don't really care what anybody else think
Now I can have anything, I ain't gon' stunt
And I don't feel bad 'cause I did it my way
And now they all say

[Chorus]
"It must be nice, it must be nice
To have them Washingtons on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have everybody on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have them Washingtons by your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have everybody by your side"
