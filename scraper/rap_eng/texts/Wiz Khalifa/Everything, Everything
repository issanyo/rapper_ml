[Hook – Wiz Khalifa]
Everything good, my money real good
I’m rolling up good, she fucking real good
Her pussy real good, I’m rolling through my hood
And everything good, and everything good
Everything good, my money real good
I’m rolling up good, she fucking real good
Her pussy real good, I’m rolling through my hood
And everything good

[Verse 1 – Iamsu!]
I’m still fucking niggas hoes but I’m tryna stop
I’m on the grind like all the time, from 9 to 9 o’clock
It’s so much fly shit in my closet, let me take you shopping
Ain’t no stopping, got to get it, boy it ain’t an option
Niggas is watching, always up in something different
Put your ass on game
Money over all the bitches, split the profit with my gang
Smoking, I’m smoking, I’m smoking
Taking shots like I was open
No baby, we ain’t from Oakland
Roll it up, twist it up, smoke it
Me and John brought the rich back
OG telling us we did that
Suck and swallow me, she kidnap
Every verse pushing their wig back
So it’s homicide, oh my god, every vegan traumatized
It’s the squad, heartbreak, tell the gang, nigga do your thang
We get high

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Berner]
G double O D
Cookie that’s OG
I’m moving through your city with the thang
I’m tryna get paid
Nah, we don’t talk to the police
Four days straight on drugs
Four for the dud, everything’s good
Got a new gold chain, ice cold frames
Your weed look cool but I like more strain
Laid back in the Maybach
From the Bay, been on since way back
Keep a bitch broke, I’m deep in her throat
I only wrote this [?] to be [?]
They used to hate me but they love me now
Hopped out the game, I heard it’s dry, and it’s ugly now
Hit me when it land, 8 AM it should be touching down
Tell her turn around, back it up, make it touch the ground
Tell that bitch I’m good, pay me like she should
Shit on leather, grip on wood

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – JR Donato]
Everything good, to the hash up in the cookies
To the way she give me nookie
Be with killers if you pushing
At the tour I’m selling cushy
So baby pop that pussy
For a trill nigga, two cups
Might be too turnt with two sluts
[?] better my wallet
Bitches be running, I’m calling her runner
Blue hundreds will get you through college
They giving me knowledge

[Verse 4 – Kool John]
You know I do it magnum, you know my lifestyle
I fuck her real good, she tryna have my child
All my hoes got my name tattooed
I give em fat dick and fast food
I hit the thing till it’s red like a baboon
I give her big stick, no bamboo
I’m real chill, but I get wild
I’m a dog, [?] no puppy child
Million dollar hoes, Imma hit her now
Keep the car running, bitch I’m in and out

[Hook]
