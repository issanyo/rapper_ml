[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Drink so much I can't drink no more
You ain't having fun what you came here for
Party so hard that I jumped off stage
Wake up everyday, and rage
We just wanna party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
People on the floor people at the door
It's 4 in the morning but we want some more
People going home but we came to rage
I might miss your call, I might miss my plane
Roll another one I ain't the sober one
If your girl get too drunk and need an Uber call her one
We gon' party hard till the sun come up
Screaming fuck a job we do this for fun
Wake up get to it, late nights lets do it
Couple bands run through it, few pounds lets move it
Y'all dudes just music, I be out buying jet fuel
Your girl gone just let her chose, smoking on vegetables
We both know what's best to do
We both balling in the game but, Khalifa man's so ahead of you
Let me focus on my next move
Treat your girl so special too, take her out on a yacht
Then it's back to my spot, come to trees got a lot
Get the boss Cam and I'll teach her how to roll pot, I done

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Drink so much I can't drink no more
You ain't having fun what you came here for
Party so hard that I jumped off stage
Wake up everyday, and rage
We just wanna party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out

[Verse 2: J.R. Donato]
You know we don't party pass out
I brought the gas out
And shorty wore them daisy dukes to poke her ass out
I always cash out, Burberry on my linen
That CLS 550 man I'm bout to smash out
They smell that dank and they know its us
They see that drank that I'm pouring up
Niggas gon' hate on the low and stuff
Guess how it is coming up, guess that's how it is blowing up
I don't partied poured a four and stuff
I'm just trynna have fun with some bad bitches probably bring the 4 of them
Cookies and KK lets roll it up
Uber and bitches lets load it up
Money so long I can't fold it up
Kicked out the suite cause we tore it up
Shawty so drunk and she throwing up
Baby girl no you can't go with us
You can hit the joint but don't tap out, she done partied till she passed out
Uh, and you know how I get it
Doubled my cup so you know that I'm sipping
Give me ten pounds and you know imma flip it
I'm breaking it down right up in the kitchen
And she know I got the vision, kicking this pimping you know she gon' listen
Water all over me know how I'm dripping
Know how I'm dripping aye Cap whats the mission

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Drink so much I can't drink no more
You ain't having fun what you came here for
Party so hard that I jumped off stage
Wake up everyday, and rage
We just wanna party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out
Party pass out, party, party pass out
