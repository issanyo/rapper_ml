Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Crazy since the 80’s fucking, crazy since the 80’s fucking
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Crazy since the 80’s fuckin, crazy since the 80’s

[Verse 1]
If you wondering who it is I'm the youngest in charge
Back with another one of them classic ones, fuck with the boy
Say you tired of hired help come and fuck with the boss
Niggas say "Man you winning" fuck it I tell 'em of course
I get love like a star, units move, cake appear
412 PGH you hatin' cause we cakin' here
Ask around you'll hear about the noise the youngin's making here
Hit 'em with that 'Oh No', now I'm record breaking here
See this that slow flow you heard of
Seeing mo dough and re-ing more dro to burn up
Keep it low though before the po-po swerve up
Pull us to the side and them homos search us
Gotta keep the work up, cause I was taught supply-demand
Smoking putting Pistolvania on the map cause I'm the man
Hustle hard plus the ladies love the nasty flow, scrappy know
So why you hate me? Cause he crazy since the 80's (fucker)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah it’s young Wiz ain’t nobody do it how I done it son
Killed ‘em with the first and gotta hit 'em with another one
Not quite the remix, you see this G-Shit?
For you to Pittsburgh ditty-bop to the beat with
Fresh with my A-1’s, keep a leaning fitted cap
For those who sick of rap thank God ya niggas back
A lot of niggas wack and that’s just sad to see
We in a marathon you cats are lapped to me
Khalifa still the same, ain’t nothing change but my change
And my foot got a lil deeper  up in the game
It’s hard seeing through all this reefer up in my brain
Let the trunk bang while you weaving and switching them lanes
Hope if you in the club let ‘em know you moving through
To pop something, roll something, man do what you do
18, making major moves that’s why they hate me brother
Plus I’m getting cakey I been crazy since the 80’s fucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me make it clear, when that cake appear
Ima make more in one day than most niggas make a year
I put my time in, (what you doin’ man?) nothing but grinding
Moving these units they coming back for what I’m supplying
I’m from the Steel-City, ya’ll niggas still lost
I’m the youngest in charge spittin' that real raw
My dutchies real long plus I work real hard
Fuck a battle dog I’ll show you how to make a real song
Or how to switch states, get cake from a mixtape
Couple hundred-thousand off my face from Myspace
You’ll be frustrated from tryna keep up with my pace
How I control the track you fools get over-lapped
You’ll get left in the dust just cause you lesser than us
And coming at the kid? Simply said it’s just pressing ya luck
See I was hungry on this grind when you was lazy brother
So why you hate me? I been crazy since the 80’s fucker
