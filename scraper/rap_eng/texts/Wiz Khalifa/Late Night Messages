[Chorus]
Ridin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout what I might do
Don't know what got into me
Probably 'cause you keep sendin' me
Them late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Keep sendin' them late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages

[Verse 1]
You always talkin' 'bout you know your worth
You through with searchin' 'round, you know what you deserve
He put you through some wild shit, that ain't me
You know what I'm about, you get just what you see
Ain't got no time for discussion, tryna get into something
Shorty hittin' my phone saying she need it, she want it
At the house all alone ain't tryna be in the public
When I leave, say she still feel me in her stomach
She gon' tell you she love you, but she been with the kid
We get it poppin', send a message like he leavin' the crib
Like to smoke when I drive, roll some weed then I dip
Before I come through, she in the bed
And once I get over, I keep it goin', don't stop
You show how much you love it when you get on top
Your mans comin' home so we gon' keep the door locked
Been smokin' and drinkin' his liquor, now we both hot
We fuckin' like we tryna catch feelings
Got you bangin' on the walls, girl, you shakin' up the building
Baby girl, tell me what the deal is
Ain't nothing like them other guys, you fuckin' with the realest
Young Wiz

[Chorus]
Ridin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout what I might do
Don't know what got into me
Probably 'cause you keep sendin' me
Them late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Keep sendin' them late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages

[Verse 2]
Nothing's the same
Know I'm a player, come over play
I ain't with them games
Don't even call, I'm just comin' over
Fresh off the plane
You gave him a try, he left your heart broke
But never again
It's starting to get late
I know what you want, but I ain't gon' judge you
That ain't the case
Send me a message, soon as I get it
Tell me erase it
Usually don't do this, know what you're doin'
You ain't no lame
Are you ready for it? Are you ready for it?
Never bored, I'ma get my phone, press record
Girl, I'm grown so don't worry 'bout nobody knowin'
It was good, I just had to see what you was doin'
It's been a long time, but this thing ain't foreign
Give it to you hard, we fuckin' up the headboard
Switching up positions in the bed, we ain't boring
Takin' you up in the sky, feel like you soaring
I was supposed to be writin' songs but I'm in my low-low
When I'm

[Chorus]
Ridin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout what I might do
Don't know what got into me
Probably 'cause you keep sendin' me
Them late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Keep sendin' them late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages

[Outro]
'Cause when I say slide, you slide
And when you say ride, I ride
Keep a bad bitch by my side
And when I say go, you go
And when you say roll, I roll
You're the last one to hit my phone
In my car all alone
