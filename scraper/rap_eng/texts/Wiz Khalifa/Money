[Hook: Young Scooter]
Money, money, money, money
20’s, 50’s, hundreds
Money, money, money, money
We working them trenches
In my neighborhood
Everything all good
Everybody get in to it
Money, money, money, money
20’s, 50’s, hundreds
Money, money, money, money

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
A thousand, bricks
Hector, he keep it coming
Every day I cap a hundred
Thousand, nigga
I’m getting money
So it’s no more serving junkies
Thinking bout that half a mill, I drew it out the carcass
Real shit, no lie, just me and a couple junkies
That 4-4 shit have a nigga money hungry
Keep 100 thousand on me
To blow it with my homie

[Hook]

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Taylor, Gang
Nigga I rep that over everything
See me I live life in the fast lane
Nigga I’m taking shots, smoking Mary Jane
Don’t need security, I got my own goons
Keep Forgiato rims on all my old schools
Ain’t talking shit, boy i’m talking money
Khalifa, throwing hundreds
Fuck thirsty, them bitches hungry for this

[Hook]

[Verse: Young Scooter]
Money, I wanna marry you
You know I really need you
Remember that day you left me
I couldn’t believe it
Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn’t think
I couldn’t do shit without you
But them birds up under that sink
Stretch 'em out, that’s what Young Scooter do
Every hundred pack I get I bury bout a brick or two
That’s just for the drop
Whatever I get, that shit get ran through
Drugs in the south, I made drugs out west too
Take a chance for that paper, that’s what money do

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Money, money, money, money
20’s, 50’s, hundreds
Money, money, money, money
