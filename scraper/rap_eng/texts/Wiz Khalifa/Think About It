[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, you know it's Naughty Boy and young Khalifa, man
Hotel Cabana, Taylor Gang

[Hook: Ella Eyre]
Got me up all night
Just to start a fight
You don't wanna think about it
You drink about it
You smoke about it
Don't talk about it
Every night's the same
Who's the one to blame?
You don't wanna think about it
You drink about it
You smoke about it
Don't talk about it
Don't make it easy for yourself

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
13's on my Impala, raw cone filled with chronic smoke
Homie, I got game like the Shuttlesworth fam
Milk these lames for what they worth
HUF socks, ashes on my shirt, three wheel motion all you motherfuckers
The Porsche in the garage then got a life for my dogs
I had nothing at all but now I take trips to Vegas
Rolling up, playing songs on my oldies playlist
Diamonds on my fist, Rollie on my wrist, my life's the shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Standing over the terrace, made so much last year
These lil' niggas should be embarrassed
Claim we the same, but the difference is apparent
Copy my style so much they got me like 'where the fuck is their parents?'
Smoking so much that the public think it's scary
But I don't give a fuck, I'm rolling another one up
And giving middle fingers to you little fucks
Who get online and say I suck, long time you rolling papers and wearing chucks
And I ain't even had my best year, ten cars, 20 millions, fuck I'mma do next year?

[Hook]
