[Hook: B.o.B]
I woke up in the morning high as hell x4
Still faded, but nigga can’t you tell
Can’t you tell, nigga can’t you tell
I woke up in the morning high as hell
Can’t you tell, nigga can’t you tell
I woke up in the morning high as hell

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I woke up this morning so high
I probably never get low
R. Kelly, I think I can fly
But this is as high as it go
I can't recall being sober
Cause that was a trillion hours ago
You say you want to get higher than me
Well you got a billion miles to go
Nigga this stone age, roll up and put it in rotation
My dro potent and make show faces
Till I'm po' baby like an old lady
So faded like some old navy in an old basement
With my OG that's fresh off of probation
I bang, bang, you be ho saving
Ran in yo ho like home invasion
When I hit up my dealer I'm so impatient
I be hightailing and ain't no debating
I know the answer to the whole equation
Always baking like a local bakery
We pass it around like a roller skating rink
I go to the club, it stay open late for me
Just rolled up a blunt and it's motivating me

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Woke up in the morning, grab some weed, a joint and rolled it
Put some cheese eggs on my stomach, I don't need it bitch I want it
Crib in California, got a villa in the trump
I put some converse on my feet and told my bitch, "let's get this money"
One joint, fourteen grams, that's a half
Blow torch on the nail, that's a dab
Space cakes, Hemp2O, I'm getting blow
Budder in a G-Pen, man I'm stoned
One hit of this wax, got him high, he don't wanna say it
Try to call my phone, but I'm gone, me and Bobby Ray
I'm smoking Kush today, tomorrow, I'm a straight shatter
Hardcore budder, lookin' like some cake batter
It make me think better, fucking up you're dead wrong
Rasta told me "fat rips make the dread long"
I took a dab, past out fly as hell

[Hook]

[Bridge: B.o.B.]
High, in the sky, Superman
Am I high, yes I am
I done lost my mind (4x)
In the sky, ceiling fan
Purple haze, Afghanistan
I done lost my mind (4x)

[Hook]
