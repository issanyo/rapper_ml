[Chorus: Big KRIT]
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't, don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't suckin or fuckin than get yo ass out

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Dash digital situation critical
Hate to make it so blatant baby
But I ain't playing
Maybe you got me confused
With one of them other dudes
I ain't none of them
Under they breath mumbling
Scared to tell them hoes what it is
You put yourself in that position
Out-chea with all that baller fishing
You fucked around and you caught a shark
Cold heart tear your feelings apart
I'm more focused on getting my rims powder-coated
One of the dopest, I'm schedule one
You just ibuprofen, what is you smoking?
Them bogus growers, they got you choking
The options open, you can hide with them suckas
Or ride low and get higher than a motherfucka!

[Chorus: Big KRIT]
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't, don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't suckin or fuckin than get yo ass out

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Straight stunting, sucka niggas I take from them
They bitches that is, get up in the car with wiz
They know they gonna bake something, ain't frontin'
Smoking it all, the eighth onion
Get it twisted because you see me on your computer screen
Thinking because you got wireless you get as high as us
Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us
Planes over everything in the fly we trust
Just by the smell it's obvious
That my connect come from cali
Im good long as the money piling up
All the while im just quick lane pimping
Big jane twisting
Walking how I talk it bitch that's Pittsburgh pimping

[Chorus: Big KRIT]
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't, don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't suckin or fuckin than get yo ass out

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Now I was candy coated, bendin corners
5th, 5th wheelin' made a killin' with the bumper grill nd' chandelier cellin', plush linen
Is you fucking, is you sucking
I was wondering cuz if not
Don't be pushing on my buttons in my Cutlass
Unless you cuttin'
Bitch I'm just saying
I ain't tricking is the reason that this porno flick playing
Trunk shaking knocking pictures off the wall
Southern mating call, 808 mean no draws
You got friends, I fuck em' all
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Just imagine what you got to do to get up in my plane
Mississippi pimp mouth piece frigid
Dolomite out of sight
Show you right, can you dig it, shawty?

[Chorus: Big KRIT]
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't, don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't suckin or fuckin than get yo ass out
