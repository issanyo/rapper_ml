Uh, nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good had it made
But nigga im from the 'Burgh I was in the hood everyday

But now im hoppin' off of jets
And these people cuttin' me checks
And I say people cuz im richer
Rich people show me respect
This come from Atrium, he's from collect
These diamonds I got on, they are Baguettes
Or VVS so all of them see me
Used to just be that dude on the net now im all in your tv
Butler asked me what I want to get Bentley or Lamborghini
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all in Waikiki
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all with Luigi
Smokin all 8 ounces to myself ain't that often that sleepy
Realest nigga out, it ain't hard to believe me
Thats why all the people that you know try they hardest to be me

Cuz nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good got it made
But nigga im from the 'Burgh now roll up that herb
