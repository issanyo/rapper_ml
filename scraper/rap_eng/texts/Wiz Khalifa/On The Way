[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yeah, I'm no my way but I ain't tryina stay
I'm just tryina smashing dash like the other day
Ain't nothing changed, give me brain, I'm stuck in my way
I ain't tricking, I pay up bitch to get out my face
See, that's the pimping in, I want these niggas envy
I hit their bitch and I'd be gone she leave your pockets empty
I swear my trigger finger got her bustin' like a semi
I play these hoes like Michael Jordan, you just Scottie Pippen
See, I be dodgin' bitches, I got a lot of misses
May your bitches wanna get my dick a lot of kisses
She keep telling me she love me, I don't wanna hear it
Bitch the only time I'm tricky when I'm disappearing

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm always on the mission, I got a lot of women
Ain't no relationship after I get that mouth I'm dippin'
Put so much OG Kush upon a scale I got a tippin'
And now she caught me trippin', that wasn't my intention
Bombay I'm always sippin', KK that's my religion
Them niggas talking down to one come up missing
Them bitches on the ‘gram ain’t got a pot to piss in
Tryina get in, I don’t give a fuck about your mentions
Who paying for the clothes?
Why your clique full of hoes?
Why you always at my shows?
All the real niggas know!
And ain't too many left of us
She ain't new to this, she do this on the regular

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I just touch down in the city and I need that fix
If the head right it up, I might keep you on the list
I bet the bitch are coming fuck me for some kicks
She wanna fuck me cause I got a Maybach on my wrist
I call her hair darker, she keep the head proper
She need a head board cause I'm the bed rocker
Told her she running out of time, I got a shot clock
She wanna kick it all day, but we ain't playin' soccer
I hit her, she hit me right back
My nigga she know what I'm on
I'll let her play with the money
Other than play with my ball
She told me her nigga was weak
So I let her smokin' this strong
I hear that they're putting to sleep
But I get right back in my zone

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way
