[Verse 1: Lola Monroe]
Pullin’ 4 wheelers out
Fuck they talkin’ bout?
I put my 4 killers out
They won’t chalk ‘em out
My bitches in the trap
They be silent in the hood
Might push your wig back
Got me pillin’ what you should
Woulda could should nigga
Wish you woulda coulda figured
Pussy automatic target
Wish you woulda pulled the trigger
Wide receivers for them keys
Them niggas still coppin’ Ocho’s
Columbiano though
Bitch we get it by the boatload
We squeeze it like a toupee
And he tie me like a two piece
It taste just like some Koolaid
Threw it back just like a bouquet
I’m like ladi dadi dadi
But my stacks just took a potty
Money piling like a potty
Pockets poppin’ like a molly

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Gettin’ so much spending like there’s nothing to it
Got it so I show it that’s just how I do it
All this fucking money I been getting to it…
[Lola Monroe]
All this fucking money I been getting to it…
[Wiz Khalifa]
Get a hundred grand and I be runnin’ through it
Pull that Panamera up I get into it
All this fucking money I been getting to it…
[Lola Monroe]
All this fucking money I been getting to it…

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Okay, merkin’ with berkins
Bitches perpin’ I’m kerkin’
I put that work in this curtains
They conversin’ I’m lurkin’
Chickens cluckin' and pluckin'
Like they buckin' and duckin'
They be fuckin' and suckin'
Just to get them a buck (in)
I say my ?????????????????
But ????????????????????
From niggas with Bricksteen's ???
Enough to hit big screens
American Gangster, I felt them like cancer
And if you ain't got my cash I fuck around and bonk ya
The first young bitch to whip a Bentley through my city though
I was only 18, now the crib is worth a milli ho
I'll sick my dogs on you, bet you cough up the bread
All this money I've been getting bet I'd cut off your head

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Gettin’ so much spending like there’s nothing to it
