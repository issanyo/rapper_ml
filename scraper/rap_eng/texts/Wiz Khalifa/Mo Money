More money you spread around

They know that I'm goin ball (I'm goin' ball)
Ball (ball), ball (ball)

[Verse 1: Hardo]
Racked up with that trap money
All my niggas they got money
Goin' do it for a real nigga
Put ya' fingers off in that cat for me
Money flowin' like water, I know you thirsty
Girl if you ballin' then what your purse say
Nigga you trappin', then whats your work weigh
I said that I got it, I know you heard me
Ain't got time to fix no broke nigga
Oh that's yo' man? You better leave that nigga
Cause broke niggas get kicked out
I said broke niggas get kicked out
These bitches know that

[Hook: Hardo]
More money you spread around

[Verse 2: Hardo]
These bitches say I act Hollywood
Well ain't a nigga in Hollywood
Do you feel me, can you see it now
That pussy pierced, can I see it now?
I done fucked, all of the bitches
In my city that's worth to get hit
Got ya' bitch, all in my house
Gettin' nasty wit' all of her friends
She fuckin', not for a house
Just want me to pay all of her rent
Goin' up, Monday through Sunday
I spendin' it like it's no end
Got tats, all on my arms
You can tell that a nigga got money, I know
That all of these bitches goin' fuck
Cause' a nigga got money, I blow
All of this cash, cause I know that the shit keep on comin'
Hardo, the realest to do it
I keep a hundred, one hundred, I know

[Hook: Hardo]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Bitch I am a beast, off the leash
Blood up in my teeth
Do this in my sleep, so unique
Yo' main girl a freak
Give me tongue and cheek, once a week
Get the top, I peak
Then get underneath
She need me like her Summer's Eve
We go to sleep thinkin' bout money
Wake up in the mornin', go eat
Never seen this many hunnids
Ain't tryna do it, I done it
Damn, how these niggas talk about ballin'
When they can't get a shot cause I call em
I done walked through the club, now fall in
Told her bring two friends, they can join in
What's in your wallet? That money my nigga
She give me head like she won, get in front of me
She leavin' you to come stunt with me
Real niggas fuck with me
I'm in my own lane
Niggas still clap for me like Soul Train
I smoke a ounce everyday for the growin' pains
Don't want the half thang, I want the whole thang
Mayne
