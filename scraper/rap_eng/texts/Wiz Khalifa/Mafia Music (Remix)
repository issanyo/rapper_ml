[Verse]
Victory I envision
So my mission is to win
One look at my arm
She like "Wizzle, where your skin?"
Hatin' niggas talk
Hear they're whispers in the wind
But I don't wanna do 'em harm
So I kill 'em with my pen
Nicky Santoro
Money don't bend
Root of all evil
Guess my bank is full of sin
Couldn't be a suit and tie
Tired of barely paying rent
Told them fuckers
I'm doing numbers
So take it on the chin
Metabolism quick
So it's hard to see what I'm eatin'
Going on retreats
And rollin' sweets while I'm tweetin'
Paradise for a weekend
Then I'm back in the trap
Never dealt with any drugs
Still the Task's on my back
Money on my mind
Everything's strapped
You kiddin' and playin'
I teach a class how to act
Somebody tell Youtube
I prolly need a plaque
Couple hundred thousand views
And I did that on my Mac
'09's mine
'08 was great
They honored Kanye
And paid Lil Wayne
Gucci did a bit
But came home and got straight
And every nigga in the biz
Did a song with T-pain
No front page
But for those who did
I send 'em my best wishes
The industry's a bitch
That's why I'm on my shit
New luggage and a flip
Shooting movies all my life
No script, no script
