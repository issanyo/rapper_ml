[Chorus: Fre$h]
I asked her "Baby, who you with?"
Diamonds in my teeth, all I do is grin
Don't care what haters say cause I knew within
I got that type of money how you lose your friend
We ain't drinking Paul Masson
Anything you want girl you know who it's on
I bless the chain with the charm
Show me that you came to perform
And you can have anything you want

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Bout my money, I don't care about the fame yeah
See my chains, she act like she know my name yeah
Hit the loud, said she wanna smoke my strain yeah
See them clouds, throw this money, make it rain yeah
I'ma do my thing yeah
Bad one that's my main yeah
Touch me so amazing
Got me on my gang shit
Smelling like that KK every time I'm in the bank yeah
Thanking my bitch bad, she speak another language
Lately I've been grinding getting to this paper
Now I'm rich and I don't need no favors
Got a crib and Nelly is my neighbor
Come fuck with me, everything is paid for

[Chorus: Fre$h]
I asked her "Baby, who you with?"
Diamonds in my teeth, all I do is grin
Don't care what haters say cause I knew within
I got that type of money how you lose your friend
We ain't drinking Paul Masson
Anything you want girl you know who it's on
I bless the chain with the charm
Show me that you came to perform
And you can have anything you want

[Verse 2: Fre$h]
I told her "I'm a Capricorn, I came here to get [?]"
Diamonds around my arm, yeah they hula dancers
See me right where you were standing
Smooth as ballads but not too romantic
If she don't give head mean she blew her chances
Roof is absent while I think of jingles
Money fill my doubt sometimes and I won't speak to people
Got two in me grinding on me while I sprinkle singles
Knew I was a star when my momma sang me "Twinkle Twinkle"
Out here weed is legal
But what we do is confidential
Knew that I was in when she approved of my credentials
Said what you getting into
I got a ounce of something Wiz grew
It's cool if you bring in your friends too

[Chorus: Fre$h]
But first I gotta know baby, who you with?
Diamonds in my teeth, all I do is grin
Don't care what haters say cause I knew within
I got that type of money how you lose your friend
We ain't drinking Paul Masson
Anything you want girl you know who it's on
I bless the chain with the charm
Show me that you came to perform
And you can have anything you want
