[Intro:The Police]
Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could live together
Walking on, walking on the moon

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Private planes on my jet way
A hundred joints in my ashtray
A couple grand to get dressed, behave
My money come in a fast way
Thirty grand is on champagne
And that's because im thirsty
Ball cause that's what works for me
Fuck niggas take it personally
Uh
I drink Bombay
I smoke purple weed
Uh
You're money all day
Man i be gone for weeks
Im talking south of France
Over seas, kush get rolled that good cologne
Getting stoned
Smoking with the owners, if i'm in the club
I'm getting payed to show up, that's...
Gangster, little nigga that's...
Real gangster, bitch you looking at a...
Real Taylor, paper in my pocket, not to spend
That's to roll my pot with, Uh
Uh

[Outro:The Police]
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Feet they hardly touch the ground
Walking on the moon
My feet don't hardly make no sound
Walking on, walking on the moon

Some may say
I'm wishing my days away
No way
And if it's the price I pay
Some say
Tomorrow's another day
You stay
I may as well play
