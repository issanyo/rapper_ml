[Refrain]
I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl
Every night you keep calling me with the same shit I'm going insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff
Leave my keys
Get your shit
Gotta go
Told you that I'm moving on you didn't well you outta know

[Verse 1]
To shape you and hold you I admit that was my mission
But everything went wrong there cause you started acting different
The day you ran up on me I was smoking chilling
Swear you was trying to roll ain't know what was soo apealing
Fast forward I'm on the road your at home calling me back forth
Can't deal with this relationship but it's what you asked for
As for them picture of them bitches
Shit I probably wouldn't be with them if your ass wasn't tripping
Not to mention you actin like a kid is the fuckshit I gotta deal with
Send a text, leave me a message, try not to listen
Bring a ref you was the main player I had to bench you
When I showed your ass how to ball, that Louis I bought it all

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Gone on the road and I'm hardly home on the weekend
You be blowing my phone up trying to see who I'm seeing
But I'm chasing this paper so for this paper I'm reaching
Might fuck one or two bitches but dont consider it cheating
I consider the fact that we'll break up anyway (anyway)
Based on all the shit that you dont appreciate
Me switching states, working hard meeting dates
And you were thinking everything was sweet, piece of cake
Well that all changed
What we had was big, but you going to miss the small things
And that little cash I spent, that was small change
But above all things
I still love you
Just gotta do my own thing

[Refrain]

Now I go
I'll never come back
And when you call
I'll never call back
Cause I got a new girl
Yeah I got a new girl
Everything was all good
Then whent all bad
No, I dont think bout the things that we had
Cuz I got a new girl
Yeah I got a new girl
