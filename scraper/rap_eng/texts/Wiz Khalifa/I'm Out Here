[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
Came up on a lotta bread
Gotta slow down, I been gettin' a lotta head
Still sellin' cocaine
Girl goin' through my phone, I ain't storin' no names
Catch me if you can, bitch
Word around town, I'm the man, bitch
Sellin' all these grams, bitch
Gotta grip the money like I'm 'bout to eat a sandwich
'Bout bring the Mazi out
Money dance, Imma bring the Ricky Bobby out
Life in the fast lane
Smoke weed, pop pills, drink a lotta champagne
Met a bad bitch on Thursday
Took the bitch down on Thursday
Now she callin' my phone early
Oh you thirsty, damn girl, you thirsty

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Lookin' for a thug? Right here
Lookin' for some love? Not here
The man with the money, right here
Bitch, I'm out here
Just spent a hundred on my wrist, bitch, I'm out here
Spent three-fifty for the whip, bitch, I'm out here
And I got a brand new bitch, bitch, I'm out here
Bitch, I'm out here

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Out here stuntin', out here hustlin'
Out here cuffin' that bitch and she out here fuckin'
Out here thuggin', out here puff a whole ounce
Tryna see that thing bounce, shake something
On the couch, yeah, break you off, yeah
Imma knock the pussy out, put it in her mouth, yeah
Fuck you mean, bitch, I'm out here
Don't know where that pussy been so I ain't goin' down there
I got mushrooms in my lemonade
West Coast bitches gang bangin'
East Coast girls rollin' Backwoods
My Down South girls love me cause I fuck 'em good
As you should
