[Pre-Chorus: Thundercat]
Can't open my eyes, girl
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down, we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said, "Come to outer space"

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Then she said, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat, drink dat"
She told me, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat"
Then she said

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
The night is almost over
But we still wanna party
Ain't no one in here sober
The weed I'm rolling's gnarly
These bitches love Sosa
These niggas want some molly
I'm just chillin', getting high as fuck
Looking boss in my Cavalli
Smoking papers, no blunts
Writing "Turn up" on our cups
'Cause we gon' do that
Someone get another bottle of gin
We just ran through that
Made a million out of nothing, thought you knew that
Hating on my crew swag, that's too bad
Walk up in the party, they like, "Who that?"
Pouring shots, ain't worried 'bout precautions or the cost
'Cause we going far, another drink, it might be a problem
I can't...

[Pre-Chorus: Thundercat]
I can't open my eyes, girl
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down, we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said, "Come to outer space"

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Then she said, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat, drink dat"
She told me, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat"
Then she said

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
We young, black, Hollywood, we turnin' up
No turnin' down, even though we prolly should
I pass some drugs to you, it's prolly good
I know that we famous
Here's some red cups with shots
We should probably take 'em
Smoking out on private property
Haters stay up and watch while we drink
Music low in case the neighbors call the cops on us
Niggas hate and bitches hate, all in the same
So take this cup of Bombay and drink all of it straight
Starting to realize what this party shit can feel like
We take the movies and the songs, make 'em real life
Live for the moment, ain't worried what it end like
Go to the roof and hit the bong, have a good night
Now you should know what the play is
Don't really know what I'm feeling
Sometimes I go through these phases
That means we both feeling faded
I mean we both feeling faded
I really hope that we make it

[Pre-Chorus: Thundercat]
Can't open my eyes, girl
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down, we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said, "Come to outer space"

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Then she said, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat, drink dat"
She told me, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat"
Then she said
