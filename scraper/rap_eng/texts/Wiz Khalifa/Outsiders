[Intro]
You heard me?

[Verse]
Still the same Cam, who I was is who I am
Drive the Chevy like a Lam, rollin' up by the gram
Always stickin' to the plan, them other niggas lack the vision
I'm 20/20 and my eyes lower than theirs
I ride slower, supersize motor when you pull up they outside of the crib
You outsiders, we in, we outshine 'em
Taylor gang or outline 'em, ya dig?

[Hook]
Ridin' with my windows down, roll another paper up
We just on our grind, workin', tryin' to get our paper up
Workin' on myself, workin' on myself
While I work on everybody else, everybody else
Homie, I been workin' on myself, workin' on myself
While I work on everybody else, everybody else

[Instrumental Outro]
