[Intro: Ne-Yo]
Clap for her, clap for her
Cause they don’t make 'em like her no more
Clap for her, clap for her
Cause they don’t make 'em like her

[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]
Shawty, not the regular in all this
Tell me what you call it
When a chick don’t make decision based on a dude’s wallet
She ain’t in the club acting like an alcoholic
She’s a pretty girl, tipsy
No stumbling and falling
If she leave the club with me
Then her maturity gonna make sure she follow me in her car
She so responsible, she gon' make sure
She leave in time to get home, get ready for work
Or get ready for class, because shawty major
It’s business and accounting, know her mamma proud of her
So for my little mamma, anti drama
So in celebration of you

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Shawty, I'mma raise a glass
Here’s a toast to the ladies with class
I see you babe

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Saying hey-ey-ey
I love the way she make
Girl, the way you are
Cause they don’t 'em make like you no more
Baby girl, keep doing you, how you do
I love the way you move
They don’t make 'em like you, girl
They don’t make 'em like you no more

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
She a diva
Take a second to turn into a believer
She a fever
In the middle of the July
12 noon in Las Vegas, that mean shawty's on fire
She know what she want
Not afraid to get it, not afraid to have fun
Baby you the one, few and far between
Sexy as they come, swag so mean

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I'ma raise a glass
Here’s a toast to my ladies with class

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Saying hey-ey-ey
I love the way she make
Baby, I love the way you are
Cause they don’t make 'em like you no more
Baby girl, keep doing you, how you do, I love the way you move
They don’t make 'em like you
They don’t make 'em like you no more

[Post-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Clap for her, clap for her
They don’t make em like her no more
Clap for her, clap for her
Cause they don’t make em like you no

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Top notch, top floor
4-54, fully restored
Nice wheels, red bottoms galore
Been honest, they don’t make 'em like you anymore
We the hottest in my whip
Give me the promise
We’ll be dancing with the stars and throwing peace signs at the comments
We’ll be posing for the cameras when they bring us on the carpet
Eating breakfast in the morning while we reading the all the comments
Like ooh girl, aww man, y'all see her
Got me like I'ma spend my whole life with you
And make the perfect wife out you
And now the mother of my kids

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Oh, everybody raise a glass
Here’s a toast to my ladies with class

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Saying hey-ey-ey
I love the way she make
Oh, I love the way you are
Cause they don’t make 'em like you no more
Saying hey-ey-ey
I love the way she make
Said, I love the way you are
They don’t make 'em like you no more
Baby girl, keep doing you, how you do, I love the way you move
They don’t make 'em like you
They don’t make 'em like you no more

[Outro: Ne-Yo]
Clap for her, clap for her
They don’t make 'em like you no more
Clap for her, clap for her
They don’t make 'em like you no more
