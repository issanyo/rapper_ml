[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
See there's a big difference
Between the star life, and your life
Me, I live the star life
You smell it when I come through

[Chorus: Johnny Juliano]
When I come through watch me put my game on
Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on
This my life and stars shine bright
Yeah I am a star, look inside my car
They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar
Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
And you know that, but you can't stand it
Out of this world I'm from a different planet
See how I landed?, big ol' chain on
Tight ass white tee, black chuck tays on
I make great songs, my shit classic
See ya'll CD, walk right past it
Call me acid that's how I do ya'll
Heat niggas up till I can see right through ya'll
Never slipped out, goons right by me
Hear niggas talk shit but they don't try me
Can't do front door, don't got I.D
Straight up the elevator to the V.I.P
Drink my drink up, blow my weed smoke
Bitch don't say shit, let my team poke
Bout my money, you see me grinding
There go a hater, you see me shinin'?

[Chorus: Johnny Juliano]
When I come through watch me put my game on
Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on
This my life and stars shine bright
Yeah I am a star, look inside my car
They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar
Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Rocks in my charm look like boulders
Young and rich so my hoes much older
Me I'm cleaned up, tats all over
Know I'm getting it. home girl told her
No not sober, need my weed lit
Keep my blunt rolled, ain't no secret
Blow like 3 zips, me and po run
Brand new Guccis, big ass chain on
Where my plane goin'? down Miami
Sun gon' tan me, palm trees fan me
Takin pictures where my fans be
Niggas sit down, they can't stand me
Straight from the Burgh', taylor gang my family
Hustle heavy that's why we cakin
Get my shine on that's why they hatin
As soon as I pull up ya'll can't say shit

[Chorus: Johnny Juliano]
When I come through watch me put my game on
Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on
This my life and stars shine bright
Yeah I am a star, look inside my car
They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar
Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star
