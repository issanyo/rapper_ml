[Refrain]
Everybody wants someone to blame
Taking losses that's part of the game
Ain't forgetting how far that we came
Hey
Everybody wants someone to blame
Taking losses that's part of the game
Ain't forgetting how far that we came
Hey

[Verse 1]
Uh, if you made for the top, then you gon' make it to the top
And you gon' keep goin' because the game don't stop
If you always stay ten toes you ain't gon' flop
Lot of doors will get closed but ain't gon' lock
Things, they change it's a newer game
Niggas who talk but won't do the same
Plus they all broke, I see through the fame
Invest in yourself like you do them chains
Next year is you gon' be on private planes

[Chorus]
And you can't blame anyone
It's on you, you, you
Don't give in, keep on goin'
And you can't blame anyone
It's on you, you, you
Don't give in, keep on goin'

[Verse 2]
L.A. to Miami, Atlanta to Houston, New York
Do what you gotta do for now it makes you feel important
You could be in the room with bosses, won't even absorb it
Cause you too busy livin' out what you see in the portrait
All the things you involve with
Are just the smallest problems
I ain't gon' need a part in
And I'm just being honest
You need to take some time to yourself and think about it
Grow up, quit being childish
I wanna see you balance
Don't think you're being challenged

[Chorus]
And you can't blame anyone
It's on you, you, you
Don't give in, keep on goin'
And you can't blame anyone
It's on you, you, you
Don't give in, keep on goin'

[Refrain]
Everybody wants someone to blame
Taking losses that's part of the game
Ain't forgetting how far that we came
Hey
Everybody wants someone to blame
Taking losses that's part of the game
Ain't forgetting how far that we came
Hey
