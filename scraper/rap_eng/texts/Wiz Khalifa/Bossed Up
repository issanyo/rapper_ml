[Intro: Juicy J]
Time waits for no man
You gotta boss up man
It's time to stop playing around, being lazy nigga
Get up and get to the money nigga
Grind nigga
Believe in your motherfucking self nigga
Motivation bruh

[Hook: Juicy J]
Started off with nothing, now I'm bossed up
Started in the gutter now I'm bossed up
Got it out the mud now I'm flossed up
Yeah, all my niggas good, yeah they sauced up
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up
I'm bossed up, you don't wanna cross us
Bossed up, all my niggas sauced up

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
If you rich then you a gangsta nigga
All the tough shit, that ain't gangsta nigga
Fuck around and find you in a bodybag
I'm just tryna fill out all these moneybags
See me, I'm what a drug dealer dream about
Fucking bad bitches, backing beamers out
If niggas want some smoke we pull them steamers out
I be so damn fresh, I cashed the cleaners out
See niggas taking shots but I'm so bulletproof
I just laugh at 'em, cop a Bentley coupe
I swear I be so high I gotta loose the roof
See niggas gotta lie, they know I'm the truth
See where I'm from nobody gives a fuck about you
I know rappers, I know trappers, I know real clappers
If you ain't getting money nigga then you hustle backwards
Choppers on the backseat if you want some action

[Hook: Juicy J]
Started off with nothing, now I'm bossed up
Started in the gutter now I'm bossed up
Got it out the mud now I'm flossed up
Yeah, all my niggas good, yeah they sauced up
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up
I'm bossed up, you don't wanna cross us
Bossed up, all my niggas sauced up

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Bosses, I'm with bosses I don't care bout what the costs is
We ain't tryna take no losses, we don't deal with fake shit often
I ain't have to go to college, taught my self and now I'm balling
Like the summer when I went out to New Orleans and came back bossing
And if a nigga play me we gone toss 'em
I don't touch 'em, I just got to make call
They waiting for me to fall but that ain't bout to happen
They playing tough but they ain't saying much about the captain
My niggas bout that action
You rid that vegan your bitch heard about the thing I'm packing
I don't care about no fashion, I'm a writer not a rapper
No day moving past us, niggas moving backwards
I ain't worried bout the pussy I'm just wondering where the cash is
I just do it different, I just made my cake the fastest
If a nigga tripping get a thing and then we blast it
I just rolled some weed and fucked your bitch, thats why I'm laughing
It's young Wiz, Taylor Gang

[Hook: Juicy J]
Started off with nothing, now I'm bossed up
Started in the gutter now I'm bossed up
Got it out the mud now I'm flossed up
Yeah, all my niggas good, yeah they sauced up
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up
I'm bossed up, you don't wanna cross us
Bossed up, all my niggas sauced up

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I might be that nigga that might run your label
I might be that nigga put food on your table
I might bee that nigga that you see on cable
But I'm bossed up so my young nigga might pay you
The devil working on me so I'm prayed up
Them niggas went to bed so I stayed up
How many times I gotta tell you I'm a player
King of my city, I might run for mayor
Mafia yeah that's that new mafia
Niggas see you shining so they copy ya
Now they all sitting round plotting on stopping ya
But that's when all them bodies popping up
I got a dope bitch, she be on some dope shit
Your bitch on some hoe shit, she just want the dope dick
Coke in her veins now she wanna fuck the whole clique
She gone bust it open, she say she can take the whole dick

[Hook: Juicy J]
Started off with nothing, now I'm bossed up
Started in the gutter now I'm bossed up
Got it out the mud now I'm flossed up
Yeah, all my niggas good, yeah they sauced up
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up
I'm bossed up, you don't wanna cross us (cross us)
Bossed up, all my niggas sauced up

[Outro: Juicy J]
All my niggas sauced up (4x)
