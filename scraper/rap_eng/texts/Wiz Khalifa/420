[Intro: Lil Debbie]
Livin' everyday like it's 420

[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
Alright, I'm sparkin' up my purp, fire's all I got
Everythin' you not, this is why I'm hot
Whatcha gonna do with all this heat in your speakers?
Leave the booth just like a furnace, lightin' up this fire reefer
You know bitch, I'm stayin' lifted, I might be addicted
Twisting up a fatty, all I do is big shit
Mama said I need to go to rehab, I said hell no
I've been waitin' to excel, I spark it up and hell no

[Hook: Lil Debbie]
I'm livin', I'm livin' everyday like it's 420, 20
Livin' smokin' on that bomb, I got that goody, goody

[Post-Hook: Lil Debbie]
I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough
I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough
I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough
I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
Stayed smokin' at like yay high, now all I do is stay high
Kush relieve a muthafucka stuck, yeah, that's that Bay high
That no cal, my low cal, my city got the finest
Money calls the kush then best believe that's where you find us
Only blow the finest ganja, potent marijuana
On my mama I be fly and all my clothes, yeah, they designer
My mama said I need to go to rehab, I said fuck that
I just went and copped another pound because I love that

[Hook: Lil Debbie]
I'm livin', I'm livin' everyday like it's 420, 20
Livin' smokin' on that bomb, I got that goody, goody

[Post-Hook: Lil Debbie]
I roll up, I smoke up

I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Pullin' out the 62, you know how we do
I'mma roll one for me and one for you
Heard about me, yeah, you know it's true
I'm the one that smoked you out and watch Scarface a hunnid times
Livin' out what I speak in my rhymes
I'm a king in my own mind, no lease, bitch, I own mine
So high, hella fly, when I roll by, you scared to hit the weed, petrified
Paid the cost so I...

[Hook: Lil Debbie]
I'm livin', I'm livin' everyday like it's 420, 20
Livin' smokin' on that bomb, I got that goody, goody

[Post-Hook: Lil Debbie]
I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough
I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough
I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough
I roll up, I smoke up
I get high, I show 'nough
