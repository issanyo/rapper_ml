[Intro]
It's that moon rock shit
You gotta mix this with some
Regular OG
Cuz this shit be burnin' crazy
Damn

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Cum in a bitch and I go crazy
Spend all these racks and I go crazy
Leave out the parking lot doin' a 180
This how the lord made me
Drop the top and start sun bathing
Put her on a treadmill and then I make her run naked
Got all my side hoes frustrated
This the life I waited on
Seen a bitch from school, gave her number to a payphone
I don't know what you been waiting on
All that I know is that I been waiting long
I ain't waiting to get no lone
Provolone on top of provolone
Mobile phone on top of mobile phone
I don't know what you niggas smokin' on
Pull my closet got a upstairs
Mobile home on top of mobile home
I go to sleep with a rollie on
I start my car with remote control
Get so much pussy
I go to sleep with a condom on

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Fuck it, I want me a milli
Fuck it, I want me a milli

Fuck it, I want me a milli
Fuck it, I want me a milli
Fuck it, I want me a milli
I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it, no really I'm gettin' it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Fuck I'm the king of the city
I don't take a trip unless I got a bitch with me
I pull up wit pounds or I got a zip in me
You don't want no problems, my guys so don't tempt me
My niggas go bap bap bap bap till it's empty
Fuck 2 every night in 5 days that's a 10 piece
My bitch that I'm with that's a 10 piece
Iâ€™m pourin' that gin in a simply
You niggas so fake need assembly
I'm smokin' weed, fuck the penalty
Ridin' round in a old school, with 2 hoes and little old me
Fuck I'ma do wit this money
But walk in the club and start stuntin'
Push all my old bitches buttons
Came up from nothin' to something
Tell her take the stick, don't run from me
There's some for you, there's some for me
So if we have this 3 some, make sure you cum for me
All that bullshit is up under me
Smokin' gas ain't no tumble weed
All of this cash that's another thing
Black and yellow like a bumblebee (bumblebee)

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Fuck it, I want me a billi

Ran a 14 for breakfast, prime 112 for dinner (you can have)
Maison Margiela killer
