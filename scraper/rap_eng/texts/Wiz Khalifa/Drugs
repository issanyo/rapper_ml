[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ooh yeah
Right now sounds
Hitmaka

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't know 'bout you but I got my own drugs, yeah, yeah
Hit you with that 2345 when I came back, woo
You know we pop champagne and Ros√©
Spent that shit all on my Balmain
Yeah, jump in with the campaign, yeah
Popping seals up on an airplane
We all cruise through, we got red leather
Whip that wrist on your bitch and make her head better
She been having too much fun, she a bed wetter
Said hit me with that one and look back at it

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't know 'bout you but I got my own drugs, yeah, yeah
Hit you with that 2345 when I come back, woo
Got my own drugs, got my own drugs
Got my own drugs, got my own drugs
I don't need no plug, I don't need no plug
Got my own drugs, got my own drugs, yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
(Young Khalifa, man)
Walkin' straight into the club, been here with all of my thugs
I said I'm rollin' up drugs, told her it is what it is and it was what it was
She leave with me just because, say she in need of some love
And if Khalifa the one, hit her so good that she don't wanna leave in the mornin'
Got your own girl, yeah, I know you grown
You came here alone 'cause you don't get along with your home girl
Diamonds, they all on me dancin', I'm like just what is the chance
To pick you up sometime and show you that I am the man
I really don't care for them bands, I'm spendin' them, baby girl

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Wiz Khalifa]
I don't know 'bout you but I got my own drugs, yeah, yeah (that's kinda hard, bro)
Got my own drugs, got my own drugs (yeah, aw, c'mon Khalifa)
Hit you with that 2345 when I come back, woo
Hit you with that 23, and LeBron when you're on your back
Got my own drugs, got my own drugs
Yeah, yeah, got my own
Got my own drugs, got my own drugs
Yeah, yeah, got my own
I don't need no plug, I don't need no plug
Got my own drugs, got my own drugs, yeah
