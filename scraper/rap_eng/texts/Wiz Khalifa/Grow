[Intro]
412
I wanna do something a little different
Just to let y'all niggas know you can't fuck with me
Don't try this man, you are not me
Young Wiz

[Hook]
And if you fuck with me, grow

[Verse]
Used to just be a young'n spit-spittin' shit
Now I'm grown up in the game and get-gettin' it
Some of my old friends I can't kick it with
You a little slow, I'll show you what big business is
I be with those who own they own businesses
Blowin' big knots in spots where all the bitches is
I'm a star, don't talk to all the bitches-es
Give 'em time, they run to me like a finish line
Hatin' ass nigga actin' like a friend of mine
Get your day cut short like it's winter time
And I'm in the gr-grind 'til the end of time
The Young Beast, I'mma eat when it's dinner time
And my cig-cigarillo fill-filled with pine
Shit locked, but you still denyin'
That I'm the best that did, and the best that's do-doin' it
Prince of the city, I'm showin' and pro-provin' it
I'm on track, you cats are lo-losin' it
Go head, come at Wiz and look stupider
They said reach for the stars, I hit Jupiter
And now I'm workin' on my next galaxy
Never be another Young Khalifa after me
.25, you ain't even half of me
I work hard, dawg, no I don't relax a day
Could eat all y'all, but I don't like the aftertaste
What you niggas know about blowin' halfs of ray
In the lab gettin' 3 songs smashed a day
Got money up front, call it cash today
Got 3 bank accounts puttin' cash away
I do me to the fullest like Castaway
Throw a beat on and let a blunt ash away
I laugh today, and make y'all cry later
If the young boy reppin' the 'Burgh then why hate him
But I ain't worried cause my stacks gettin' bigger
If you ain't heard around, bitch I'm that ni-nigga
See me ridin' round window cracked, lit Swisher
Can't talk currency, I can't get wit ya
Who got it fucked up? Y'all convinced 'em
The hate in the equation just a small addition
My name Wiz Khalifa, but just call me mister...
4, 1, 2
