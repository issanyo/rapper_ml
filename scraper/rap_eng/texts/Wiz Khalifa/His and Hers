[Refrain]
Brand new tennis bracelet
My bitch rocking shit right off the run way
Brand new whip, it’s racing
Anything that I do my bitch do the same, hey

[Chorus]
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers

[Verse 1]
We got the cars to match
We got the clothes to match
We got Chanel to match
Got YSL to match
We got the chain to match
We got the charm to match
She want the names to match
Tat on your arm to match

[Pre-Chorus]
Got girls best friends, around my neck
I’m so deep in, up to my neck
You let me in, don’t let me go
She get the same for sure

[Refrain]
Brand new tennis bracelet
My bitch rocking shit right off the run way
Brand new whip, it’s racing
Anything that I do my bitch do the same, hey

[Chorus]
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers

[Verse 2]
Everything his and hers
Everything still a blur
Everything here to burn
Everything here is firm
All up on me
Choose up on
She up on me
Speed up on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Got girls best friends, around my neck
I’m so deep in, up to my neck
You let me in, don’t let me go
She get the same for sure

[Refrain]
Brand new tennis bracelet
My bitch rocking shit right off the run way
Brand new whip, it’s racing
Anything that I do my bitch do the same, hey

[Chorus]
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
Everything his and hers
