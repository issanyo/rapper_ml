[Chorus: Miguel]
Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, baby
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
You don't want war, we all want more
More hardcore drinks before I'm on tour
Got the kush in the cones, you know I stuff Raw
[?] encore, big balling wherever I ball
I'ma keep bragging on how I got here
20 year career it's always sincere
These dudes are just one hit wonders
You don't know who I am? Go ask your mothers
You got OG's, you ask your brothers
They will tell you what I [?] summers
And they gon' tell you that N.O.R.E. play to win
2018 feels like '98 again

[Chorus: Miguel]
Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, baby
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Talk slow chief, my pockets so deep
Grind all week, I hardly ever sleep
Shit ain't ever sweet, but since the hotel
Top notch freak, top me off please
Talking bout legendary, talk about me
Talk about P and they N-O-R-E
I play the game just like I been here before
Left the team now she ain't winning no more

[Chorus: Miguel]
Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, baby
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby

[Bridge: Pharrell]
I peeped what you goin' through, baby
You don't know, but it is in your eyes
I think you need a 180
The total opposite'll be nice

[Chorus: Miguel]
Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, baby
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby

[Verse 3: J Alvarez]
Otro trago mas…y enciende
Otro trago mas…otro trago mas
Que viva mi gente
Baby conmigo pásala bien
Sabes que te voy a tratar a cien
Hagamos travesuras
Si parece una locura
[?]
Soy el caldero y el sartén
Barbie yo soy ken
Fuego pa’ la hoja, te toco y te moja’
Llegamos y el lugar se desaloja
Te doy hasta que termine [?]
Si no es ferragamo es valentino
Mami somos gangster pero finos
La mesa con dj y botellas
Y de camino tomate otro red bull si mañana
[?]
Da te otro trago (Uno mas)
Y vamos a viajar sin que lo notes (Uno mas)
Y que tus labios
Quiero que pidas que yo te controle (Uno mas)
