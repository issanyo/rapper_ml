[Featuring: Wiz Khalifa]
They see me coming they say they come big time
Yeah nigga big money big rhymes
Big old thing in my past for big body dimes
Between hate and love is a very thin line
You see me coming they say they go big dope
Yeah nigga big money, big song
Big old thing in my short for big body bro’s
Between hate and love is where the guns pop off
Now I don’t buy shit, all of my chips go high lips
Boog it up nice jeans, born styling
Hot tack shit, expects shower hate TV’s
In the mirrors watch the house with my bad chick
Pull size to cruise, bubble back that oh we feelin in the move
With some slow wet sex she real splash it
She told me go long and do it bad at me
..what did you say you and I say
In love forever in life is but a dream don’t wait me
Spreeze at venees them little T-shirt look purp
When the titties my baby
Lip crazy and I..stress free everything is old love lately
And ever since we hooked up life is wavy
We at good the..wherever you sun blazin

Hook:

Come fly with me you’ll be my co-pilot

Rolling up before the first one is even over
We run the game till the game we never sober
The cush I’m smoking on is from the growl world
The smell is reminiscent of a molder
Cut from the same..is all the same

Get hot so much don’t know how to be in low
