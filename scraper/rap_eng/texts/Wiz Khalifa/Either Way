[Chorus: Dice SoHo]
Hop out fresh as fuck with a mink coat (mink coat)
All white, shawty thought she said coke
I'm from down south, you can tell by the lingo
Hit her five times in a row like bingo
She fell in love, fell in love wit' the dope (wit' the dope)
Damn right, I gotta get either way it go (either way it go)
Either way it go, either way it go (way it go)
Either way it go, either way it go

[Verse 1: Dice SoHo]
Either way it go, they know I make it snow (snow)
Swangin' lane to lane, pull up [?]
You ain't gotta act, you could smell the big dope
Let them hit the blunt once, 'til the fish choke
Smokin' cookie in the foreign on the way to Calabasas
I know, I could barely see through these dirty designer glasses
Got a 'Rari and a Lamb just to see which one's the fastest
Put my dick in her mouth, then nutted all on her lasses

[Chorus: Dice SoHo]
Hop out fresh as fuck with a mink coat (mink coat)
All white, shawty thought she said coke
I'm from down south, you can tell by the lingo
Hit her five times in a row like bingo
She fell in love, fell in love wit' the dope (wit' the dope)
Damn right, I gotta get either way it go (either way it go)
Either way it go, either way it go (way it go)
Either way it go, either way it go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
Rock Balenciaga, I just cop the pink coat
Shawty give me brain, she be givin' deep throat
I be actin' nice but my bitches mean though
We be on the low, we don't ever stream nose
Livin' dirty life but I'm rockin' clean clothes
She be ten toes but she on her knees though
Brought another plane, I'ma watch my weed grow
Smokin' on that turtle, Gucci on the shelf though

[Chorus: Dice SoHo]
Hop out fresh as fuck with a mink coat (mink coat)
All white, shawty thought she said coke
I'm from down south, you can tell by the lingo
Hit her five times in a row like bingo
She fell in love, fell in love wit' the dope (wit' the dope)
Damn right, I gotta get either way it go (either way it go)
Either way it go, either way it go (way it go)
Either way it go, either way it go

[Outro: Dice SoHo]
Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh
