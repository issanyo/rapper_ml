[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
On nights like this
Gotta pour something
Get right like this
They don't write like this
Hear them talk it up
But they ain't quite like this
And i'm light type rich
Hundred on the chain
With the light bright right wrist
And my pipes like vroom vroom
Thats why your chick wanna come with him
All my homies ballin above the rim
My pockets bulging a lump sum
You can come if you want
Just bring a friend

[Chorus: 3OH!3]
'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na  (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na

'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na  (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na

[Verse 2: 3OH!3]
Let's do this outside
Shut down the whole block
Watch the girls drop by like it's a catwalk
We're livin' easy
We got the whole day
And we can go hard don't matter what the cops say
I'm thinking maybe I can't have relationships
'Cause lately they're not making any sense
And baby your the one thing on my mind that can change anytime

[Chorus: 3OH!3]
'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na  (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na

'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na  (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
My red cup overflowing
The bartender tell me stop
I just keep on going
I don't even have to talk about it
I just show it
Umm its me they want to roll with
Don't need to know her name
Cause now she sleeping in my home
Drink by the case beer glass cup
Im at the bar spending cash up
And i probably told you this was my last one
But i'm trying to get trashed bro

[Bridge: 3OH!3]
I see not vitals on your EKG
Dead on the dance floor B.O.B
Clap because we need more 3OH!3
Blowing out your speakers
Hey, na na na
Blowing out your speakers

[Chorus: 3OH!3]
'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na  (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na

'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seeing double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na  (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
