[Intro]
Chamberlain, he's got it

[Chorus: Sosamann]
Told her be my ride or die, told the lil' bitch let's live this life
Told her let's touch the sky, smoke good weed, roll up, get high
Told her don't tell no lie, work a lil' bitch like nine to five
Got jewelry that shine and shine, I'm a big fish and they all small fries, like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy, everybody wanna ride this wave (Yeah)
Nigga get cheese like cake (Yeah)
Chopper eat beef like steak, like ooh-ooh-ooh
My diamonds, yeah, they wet like lake, ayy
The bitch get the sack like JJ
And make somethin' shake like earthquakes, like ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Sosamann]
Like lil' mama, she said she gon' ride today
With problems inside her, get all the cake
She lit, tryna take away all the pain (Yeah)
See shit like a mile away
I stepped in the game, I made all the plays
Give fuck 'bout the fame, I need all the change
Give fuck 'bout them lanes, they're not in my lane, like ooh-ooh-ooh
Told lil' bitch stack it up, show me what that do-oh, do
Need a lil' bitch back it up, baby, work your mo-ove
We always win, never lose
That's lean that you niggas can use (Sauce)
Ain't leavin' these niggas no clue
Handy man raw with the tool
I take no lies (I take no lies)
Gotta watch these people, they be playin' on both sides (Both sides)
Gotta keep a chopstick for protection when I ride
Told lil' bitch roll the weed, get high
And lil' baby go'n keep them lies, yeah

[Chorus: Sosamann]
Told her be my ride or die, told the lil' bitch let's live this life
Told her let's touch the sky, smoke good weed, roll up, get high
Told her don't tell no lie, work a lil' bitch like nine to five
Got jewelry that shine and shine, I'm a big fish and they all small fries, like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy, everybody wanna ride this wave (Yeah)
Nigga get cheese like cake (Yeah)
Chopper eat beef like steak, like ooh-ooh-ooh
My diamonds, yeah, they wet like lake, ayy
The bitch get the sack like JJ
And make somethin' shake like earthquakes, like ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Pull up, they don't got a clue
Don't know how much I just threw
Diamonds, they shine like a fool
Been on the grind with my crew
Don't feel like I gotta prove
Anything but really not tryna lose
Some just be bendin', but I break the rules, ooh
Tell me why you stack so much
Tell me why you grind for the racks so much
Why these fools lack so much?
Why they say that they real but they act so much?
Tell me why you work so much?
Why you high all the time? Keep the herb rolled up?
Why you come in first so much?
Keep the money on your mind, gotta earn so much?
'Cause that's just how I was raised
They wanna be us, but we ain't the same
