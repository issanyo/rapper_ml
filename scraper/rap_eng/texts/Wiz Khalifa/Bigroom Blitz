[Intro :  H.P. Baxxter]
Chapter five

(Bigroom Blitz)

International bitch!

It's, it's, the bigroom blitz!

Turn it up !

[Verse 1 :  H.P. Baxxter]
Shotta got the plan, man
Always like a Grand Slam
Big shot, hole in one
Shotalot is on the run
Crack on the whip, snap attack
Bars so tight, front to back
I reach my fate at the gates
God says shotta you was great

[Verse 1 : Wiz Khalifa]
When I’m shopping
And my bag filled with options so don’t ask
What it cost I’m in a Maserati
Coupe going so fast
That I lost ‘em
And my bitch got so much swag
That these bad bitches on us
Ah! Killing y’all, pow!

(Bigroom Blitz)
It's, it's, the bigroom blitz
[Drop]
Bring the noise !

[Verse 2 : Wiz Khalifa]
I jack them hoes, direct them hoes
Take ‘em home and let them hoes
Go live out their fantasies
They’re popping pills, I’m rolling weed
Even got a couple bad bitches overseas

[Verse 2 :  H.P. Baxxter]
Shotta got the slo-mo
You can call it pro flow
Every shot a straight flush
Shotalot is in a rush
Back on the floor, lyrical madness
On the mic, Jack the cactus
I reach my fate at the gates
God says shotta, you was great!

Shotta gotta the chicks
It's, it's, the bigroom blitz
[Drop]
Yee-haa !

[Outro]
Nobody's hotta than shotta! Thank you!
