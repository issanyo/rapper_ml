Steady chasing the money, it took me to better places
Black diamonds with the white diamonds
Yeah, we call that shit segregation
VVS's yeah, they always shining
Got 'em sick, you can peep they faces
Mighta said I ain't fucking with him
But you can never say, I ever hated
All this gas got me elevated
They ain't think that I will ever make it
Your bitch she gave me good brain
You can tell she was educated
I beat the pussy, I never ate it
She can never say we ever dated
She can never be my main
'Cause I'm in too love with the big faces

Go smoke 'til the ceiling (go smoke 'til the ceiling)
She ain't tryna fuck, get right in the truck
And move on to some' different
I'm always getting paid, doing new day today's so you see how I'm living
I hop in my ride two licks to the side and now that bitch tippin'

Whole lotta niggas 'round to hold down my enemies
Whole lotta weed getting rolled in a paper plane
Whole lotta bitches scream my name
