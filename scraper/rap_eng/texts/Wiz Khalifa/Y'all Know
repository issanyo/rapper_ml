[Hook х2]
Y’all know, someone tryin to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when i see you
Cowards ain't real you nigga see through
[?]


[Verse 1]
First off i'm a pittsburgh veteran
Stay true to the game nobody better than
Ain’t here for a minute I ain't just here to set a trend
Rap slow quick flow sick need medicine
Hard to get ahead and prevail
Keep my head and be well
When this cops
Want me dead or in jail
That's why i'm moving at a fast pace
Leaving you a last place
If you was brought up broke
Ho you know it's the cash taste
U see i grind for mine thats what u get from me
I work hard dawg cause ain't shit for free
So u can stand out waiting for a hand out
Me imma go get a no win a go figure
I got a hot rhime stop mine no nigga
In a hood with a good kiss turned cope flippers
Ye the block run us hot some us cole winners
Will we get the killers hoping that the lord forgive us


[Hook]


[Verse 2]
See this is more than what you used to, u dues
Probably won't admit i'm the truth when i'm through the roof
Wannin' with the yongin' I’m comin' at one a same kind
Hit the ground runnin' i'm gunnin' to take the game
President putting drugs in the hood that set the track man
With the laws sickening heart being a black man
No Pac so the flow rocks to the crack fans
I seen it all to soon you just a rap fan
And had to earn chips oh that i'm concerned with
Learn quick school everyday but don't learn shit
Most the teachers think i be a nigga turned stiff
I'm a Wordsmith next to nothing that you heard prick
Yeah i'm the birch prince
Because i'm a sicko with the words spit
Pittsburgh been through all the birch this
Fuck what u heard it’s
Enough to make a nigga turn flips
Sometimes i see why niggas turn bricks
Cause in the birds shits all about survival here
Niggas grind to get rich most die trying here
So imma spit till i'm considered a pioneer
You might be hot but Khalifa bringing the fire here!


Y’all know, someone tryin to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when i see you
Yeah the written be real and I hail from the ill pretty city a steel
Lets do it!
