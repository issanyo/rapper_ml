[Intro]
Cookin' Soul
Yeah
It's all about a dollar man
Don't let nobody else tell you anything otherwise
Unless it's me
Uh

[Verse 1]
Leave my iPhone cracked if I take a loss
Know I'm gon get it back, I'm always on attack
Learn to let the money stack, homies turn to rats
When you deal with certain cats, they deserve the facts
Stay in constant meditation, always burning back
Wipe them ashes off my lap, you ain't part of my set
It's harder to maintain than it is to get
That's why you hold on to it and don't ever forget
That you did good with less just gotta deal with the stress
It's part of the game

[Chorus]
Sometimes things ain't gon work out
How you think you want it to go
Sometimes you gotta keep going
When you think you can't no more
Sometimes you can't depend on
Who you think you can no more
Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and
Figure it out

[Verse 2]
Knowing your worth is half the battle
Keep fuck niggas out of your circle
Yeah they gon try to hurt you
See you focusing, they try to divert you
Being fake ain't rare, it's universal
That's why I'll never work with you
Family first, till I'm in the dirt
How these niggas bosses but they needing work
That's exactly why I don't believe em
Goals, set em, achieve em
Joints smoke em and leave em
Ten toes, no matter the season
Hot tub with my feet in
Living comfortably cheesing

[Chorus]
Sometimes things ain't gon work out
How you think you want it to go
Sometimes you gotta keep going
When you think you can't no more
Sometimes you can't depend on
Who you think you can no more
Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and
Figure it out

[Outro]
You know what, playboy?
They always gonna wonder why
You gotta have a brand new car
Or why you gotta have the flyest watch
But you know what, playboy?
You just gotta keep doing you
Coz ain't nobody do you better than you
You look good doing it too, playboy
And you know what else
Them haters, they just gon keep hating man
And when you on top, people always gon want your spot
But you know what, playboy?
It's up to you whether you give it to them or not
So keep that in mind, playboy
