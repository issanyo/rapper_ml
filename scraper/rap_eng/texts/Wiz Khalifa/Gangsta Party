[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Wiz khalifa man
What up meez
Everythings top notch
As it should be
Smoke the best we ride the cleanest
Drink the most expensive wine
Hahaha :)

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh!
(You grow one?) Im on one
Break it down and ill call one
So much weed ya think i grown some
Hatin' niggas lookin' lonesome
Young nigga but i grown some
Talkin cribs cause i own some
Talkin planes cause i flown some
Talkin mils cause i shown some
If its ol school then im ridin in it
Private dinner might fly up in it
Poppin in i get high up in it
Ain't in the club less my guys up in it
If its bout a check then im dyin to get it
Man of my city you hidin in it
Room full of money, im divin in it
Taylor Gang, skies the limit

[Wiz Khalifa]
Makin all the haters
Cause im chasin all the paper
Nigga's see you gettin money
Then they start to actin fake
Im in a class all by myself
Im on a top floor with no neighbors
An i get so fuckin high sometimes
I dont hear what they say

[Wiz Khalifa]
Cause now i get it
Hold up, wit it
Seven, digits
Rolly, minutes
All my, niggas
In the, club
We poppin, bottles
Ain't gone, finish
Ooh
Ridin round wit my old school
Smokin kush wit my own name
Never been a fuck boy
Always did my own thing
Own thing!
Uhh

[Outro]
Chillin in my car
Rollin another one up
Nigga thats how gangstas party
(How gangstas party)
How gangstas party

Everything on us
35 bottles ain't enough
Look at how these gangstas party
(How gangstas party)
How gangstas party
(How gangstas party)
