Let me introduce you to the Taylor Gang
That's my nigga Wiz and I’m Chuck Taylor mane
We both known in our hoods like Chuck Taylors mane
We get high, fuck hoes, and roll paper planes...
Cause we Taylor made, we the Taylor gang
Blowing smoke into the face of those haters mane
We all stars in the hood like Chuck Taylors mane
So throw it up and keep repping the Taylor gang, if you Taylor made...

[Game Verse]
I wake up in the morning to Red Converse
Dre Beats on, listening to Bomb first
You got a hangover nigga, mine’s worse...
Haze got me kicking knowledge like a Nas verse
Shit be complicated like out of towners trying to understand why we say: "Whaddup Blood" but we not related
That's how Compton made it
So don’t run around yelling Soo Woo without a Chuck Taylor confirmation
On that documentary shit I shocked the nation
Muhammad Ali shit like I boxed in Vegas
When it come to beef shit, nigga I’m the greatest
I knew I was next the night they shot 'Pac in Vegas
I ain't a killer but don’t push me
I see a bitch looking, I’mma end up in her pussy
See ya later, fuck haters, cause bitch we Taylors
Bitch we major...

[Wiz Khalifa Verse]
Probably heard I’m the tightest
And I heard that you never smoked so I rolled it, you light it
And I heard that you liked it
And I welcome you to my world you’ve been cordially invited
Now I got the whole world excited
Know every word when they heard that I write it
Know I can fuck every girl cause my jewelry the brightest
And my herb is the lightest
Some niggas mad I made it, blame it all on perfect timing
I say I made it big cause I stuck to the cursive writing
These niggas rather be a has-been
Then not be famous at all
I learned you ain’t really gotta be famous to ball
I’m hustling hard, and turning bitches to customers
Soon as they get in front of us
Bad hoes after the shows rushing up
Baby them niggas clowns talk down but they look up to us
May look the same but I’m nothing like them suckas so fuck what them niggas sayin’ and keep reppin’ the Gang...
