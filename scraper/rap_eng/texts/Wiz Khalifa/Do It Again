Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey "press play" while I press up on a girl
In a mist that I smoke in the air
The reflection of lights that glare
She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that's power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That's real big, pop my color, pop that lid

Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again

Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night
All seven days of the week, I live the party life
I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends
We going hard till the sun come up and do it again
I got a drink in my hand they playing my favourite song
This girl that's dancing on me ain't' got no panties on
And she gonna come back to my hotel, don't tell
Anyone about us, I'm here to party all night

Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again

Come to my section (my section)
And down some of this liquor
Then tell me what it hit for
Gon be some things I don't remember
So take some camera phone pictures
