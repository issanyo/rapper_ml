[Intro: Juicy J]
Yo my lil bruh Wiz just uh
Poured me some champagne man appreciate that bruh
I finna spit some real shit man, you know what I’m sayin so uh, you know
We trippy
Getting fucked up
You know what I’m sayin?

[Bridge x2: Juicy J]
Roll em up, pop em up
Roll em up, pop em up
Roll em up, pop em up
Got the bitch, get ya dick sucked

[Break]
Trippy niggas
Real shit, real shit, let’s get it

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Scared young nigga let me put you on to the game
Fuck who you think they know make sure they know your name
No trustin a nigga, don’t trust at a nigga
A nigga might come back and bust all you niggas
And these hoes sheist, make sure you get the price
Before you roll the dice
Ratchet ass hoes
Pocket full of money, know a lil somethin'
Light skin sell but you get more for a bunny
Take it from me pimpin, me I’m so different
The way I hear we don’t consider that lyrics
Fuck that bitch, mistreat that bitch
Say it again, say that shit again
If they start tellin' give em the barrel end
Give your all again, and this will never end
It’s the different type of Heaven for a man and a pimp
RIP Chad Butler these niggas still simps

[Bridge 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I’m so turnt up I won’t turn down

[Hook x2]
Not a TRY ME button so don’t play with me
Guns like roommates, they stay with me
Plenty goons and they gon spray with me
Nigga I’m 1000, I’mma stay a G

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Nigga pick the wrong day for they fuck shit
He mustn’t heard I’m bout that fuck shit
Baby choppa, fresh out the box nigga
You was hard then now you actin box nigga
I’m on the beam, I wanna pop a nigga
I blink my eyes, my youngin' shot the nigga
Ballin on these haters, I don’t need a gym
Shooters shootin at yo ass, like you a rim
Wet yo ass up like you took a swim
Choppa chop em down, call him a limb
Trippy ass niggas turnt up gin
Killers finding where you live then they going in
Run up in yo shit, take yo presidents
Kill everybody no evidence
North Memphis, we don’t talk, we'll kill a bitch
