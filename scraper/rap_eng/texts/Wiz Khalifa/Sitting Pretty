[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
That ass she walkin' round with is sitting pretty
I can't tell if it's real or not but it's sitting pretty
Forgiatos on the whip that be sitting pretty
Rollie on the wrist that be sitting pretty
Sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sitting pretty
Throwing 100's and 50's if she pretty
If she pretty, sitting pretty

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bae go shopping every weekend
Bae be killin' all these hoes, they be mad
They just jealous, bae gon' stunt when she pull up
Bae gone hop out then walk in then go up
Drink a little somethin' then pour up
From the city everybody know us
And me and Young Khalifa, nigga hold up
Little momma said "how you stay so high but be so focused"
Shit, I guess I'm the man, I feel like the man
I came with my dogs, we takin' no losses
We stuck to the band, I can't be your man

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
All that ass you walkin' round with is sitting pretty
I can't tell if it's real or not but it's sitting pretty
Forgiatos on the whip that be sitting pretty
Rollie on the wrist that be sitting pretty
Sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sitting pretty
Throwing 100's and 50's if she pretty
If she pretty, sitting pretty

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hoes in my section I gotta go old school collection
Rollin' up dope, wrappin' smoke my profession
My Rollie just won the election
Pull up, drop the top, hit the swish
Let it drop, stop and smoke out the whole intersection
I roll with protection
Pull up to the club late as fuck just to sow my investments
Send emojis, ya'll hoes get the message
Randy Moss is for sure a reception
Talk to God so I know it's a blessin'
Rollin' up on the phone, playin' Tekken
And the front got the batteries chargin'
And the kitchen got two bitches chefin'
One stuffin' clothes, one undressin'
I'm gettin' this money, finessin'
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
All that ass you walkin' round with is sitting pretty
I can't tell if it's real or not but it's sitting pretty
Forgiatos on the whip that be sitting pretty
Rollie on the wrist that be sitting pretty
Sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sitting pretty
Throwing 100's and 50's if she pretty
If she pretty, sitting pretty
