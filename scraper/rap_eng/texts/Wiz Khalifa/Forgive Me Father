[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Another one!
DJ Khaled

[Hook: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess again
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Don't even look back on it
You ready for change, better act on it
They look up to you so don't slack on it
It's a blessing, you know that you're talented
Some people don't know what their talent is
What's sad is they don't know what balance is
I ain't been the same since I had a kid
Look out for him and protect where I live
I done got famous for what I did
Rollin' up papers and showin' love, we all in the same
Now the bank come to where I live
Don't hate on another man, no that ain't part of the game
Did it all for the fame
And don't call it a game
Started small every day
We worked hard, and now they call us bosses

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
And I done seen so many people slow down
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
And I done seen so many people change up
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
When you doin' good, somebody wanna see you doin' bad
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
Just movin' forward, so why they wanna talk about the past?
I can't relate, I can't relate, no

[Hook: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess again
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons

[Verse 2: Wale]
Major, yeah!
I got visions, I miss fortune all day
What I'm sayin', I, tryna tell y'all
I shake these nightmares all day
How can I give you my mind?
When I try to think, it just race
How can I give you my heart?
When I call on it, it just breaks
I put the city on top
District, V.A. all day
PG MoCo on their sweaters
Guess who made their MDMA?
Amy Wine to Cobain
Qur'an, Bible or fate
Try not to feel like I'm Robin Will'
Would a hook change my fate?
Why you make me this way?

[Hook: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess of it
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons
