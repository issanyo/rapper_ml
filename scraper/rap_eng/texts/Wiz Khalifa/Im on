And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all
When you die you can't take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I'm drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke their bank is injured
And bitches gonna ride with who they think's a winner
And I'll be smiling encase they take a picture
Uh, I'm smoking weed drinking liquor make a hundred
Off a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I told 'em pick one
'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business don't play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah
I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
And blow it all away (way)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
And blow it all away (way)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone
All kinda of hoes in my car
They wanna feel that maximum speed
Never had an absence of weed
Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V
Plus the most exclusive tree in my jar
Making my bank, spending it all
And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on
She taking it off
Most of these niggas just talk ain't caking at all
Back in the day money was short, I'm making it taller
You know what I mean, some say it's a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No N.B.A. they say I'm a baller
Live for today, stunt like my father
I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
And blow it all away (way)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
And blow it all away (way)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone
