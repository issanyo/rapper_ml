[Hook]
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I work hard, niggas hardly work
Smoke good Swishers, y'all hit dirt
Talk bad 'bout that Taylor Gang swag
Now we hit the club in a small T-shirt
Hoping that somebody will notice him
I'm chavo chasing, that money keep rolling in
I step on stage and they say he's going in
Four hoes tryna leave with me and the motorman
I'm blunt roasting
On a cloud just coasting
Shift once, and I'm speeding
On my way, outer space
A couple niggas in this race
But it's one that I'm leading
Hoes see me, think they dreaming
I'm a star
Drive a space ship sweetie, not a car
Come on dog, we ain't gotta wait for the weekend
I'll hit the West Coast and be back for the weekend
Swag

I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh
