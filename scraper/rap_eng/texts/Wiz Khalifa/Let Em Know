Let em know
I was made for this, and gotta let the people know we from
Pittsburgh, Wiz Khalifa 'bout to bring it home
Is he shaking fools? (Yes) Is he making moves? (Yes)
What y'all gon' do, it's so 4-1-2

Let em know
I was made for this, and gotta let the people know we from
Pittsburgh, Wiz Khalifa 'bout to bring it home
Is he shaking fools? (Yes) Is he making moves? (Yes)
What y'all gon' do, it's so 4-1-2

[Verse 1]

It's Wiz Khalifa and I gotta let the people know
How a nigga feel grinding for the bigger dough
Put the city on my back, prince and that's official yo
Had to let these niggas know, youngin' with a sicker flow
And you knew the name, you can call me who to blame
For what I do to the game, fuck it I just do my thing
And I been focused on this rapping since the moola came
I make that money come back just like a boomerang
You dudes are losers lames blowing flips and losing change
A fly guy such as myself will come and scoop ya dame
The game is up for grabs and I'ma be the next to win it
Young but I'm a boss man, all you dudes is just beginners
And no soul when the flow's cold I spit December
You fools clones with no souls you such pretenders
I'll come through ya the young dudes a tough contender
Rostrum Records spitta, 4-1-2 representer

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

I was made for this, hustled on to pay for this
Now the youngin' next, receiving checks and gettin' paid for this
And where I'm from a lot of niggas on some slavery shit
You know the chains and whips, they get the 'caine and flip
And some niggas get they change and dip
Other niggas get trapped up in the game and they brains get split
Either that or they get knocked and they man turn bitch
Take the stand and they man turn snitch
This is the land where you gotta keep ya grass low, fucking snakes love to hate
Never let 'em stop ya dough, gotta learn to love the hate
Make ya moves, I've been on the grind since an early teen
Spittin' crack and servin' fiends, nothin' but raw 16s
And it's too late to start some shit up in here
What you crazy?  The whole Steel City's in here
I got the streets on smash and they with me in here
You act up, watch how quickly you 'pear
