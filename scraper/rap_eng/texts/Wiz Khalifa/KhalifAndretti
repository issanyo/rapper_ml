[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Out of range, never running out of game
Buy the chains, came with a lot of pain
Not a day goes by I ain’t got a jay
Spending change, where that Prada at?
I done blew a lot of money, got it back
Full of hate ‘cause they not on track
My niggas
Scraping them polish, chasing them dollars
We all live for today, but think of tomorrow
If that weed rolled up, I think she go holler
So much money stacked up, we ain’t thinking of violence
Before the plane take off, my seats are reclining
Asked how to be a boss, the secret is timing
Ain’t a boss if your reefer is quite
Your cheese declining
You niggas ain’t loyal, I rep Taylor Gang to the soil
And for Jet Life, you will be a memorial
You wanna learn how, here’s the tutorial
2009 nigga hit this new shit
Just bored, me and Spitta got a key, we been recording
Remember when we couldn’t afford it
Now it’s private when we boarding it

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Ay, ay, ay
Benz on [?]
Crawling past armour
Night crawlers on the corners, shooters what they call ‘em
I was watching Shottas at [?], 5 in the morning
Shots rang like an alarm, the target got hit in the forearm
Duck behind the car, switch hands, reloaded the cannon
And came back blasting that bitch like O-Dog
Wild gun firing
All the niggas clapping at the dawg but he survived it
Except an innocent man standing at the bus stop
Trying to get to work early and avoid rush hour
Yesterday he put the Chevrolet in the paint shop
It gotta be passed down
And his son gunned down and forgot about
Stuntin’ for the ones who never made it out
Stuntin’ for the youngin’ still in the struggle
Coming up with ways to making out
It's Eastside, Andretti reporting live
Stand behind the yellow tape, cover your kid’s eyes

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Twice upon a time
Chain cold, look like Vegas lights the way it shine
Changed the game
Bout to do it twice because we grind
You niggas ain’t tough, you’re more like mice compared to mine
3 McQueen shots taste like lightning every time
If her [?] good than I might be [?]
Nigga run up on me, won’t be lucky if he trying
You ain’t a big dog, you just a puppy in the mind
I’m like Puffy in his prime
Comfortable with mine
You ain’t a GOAT bro, you just a buster with some rhymes
The gas that I smoke, like an onion, have you crying
It’s gang Jetlife, we ain’t much to win a dime
My Benz new, old school custom when I’m riding
Forget about the nigga who be cuffing when she sliding
The weed good, sex good, ‘bout the way we vibin’
Gotta have a million Dollars, plus you want a [?]
Benz pulling up with a couple of trucks behind it
That paper works us, look it up before you sign it
Dickies suit on while I’m puffing on that Chronic
Jumped up in the game, I ain’t rush to go to college
I was 21 when I touched a million Dollars
Circle small, I can only trust you if you solid
Ain’t got no connection, so it must have been the talent
Rules to the game, made no hustle without balance
Always getting paid, stack it up and make a mountain

[Bridge: Spitta Andretti]
Me and my nigga from Pittsburgh
Started from the bottom
Nothing but [?] picking a sucker’s Dollar
But we had a support system that was louder
Gang-lifers, Taylor-jets, who was high as mountains
Revolutionize, [?]
Redefining, we was flying
Showed you how to become a man now online
[?] to the streets they wasn’t a lie
2009, him and I

[Verse 4: Curren$y]
Close the Maybach curtains, I’m in here working
My instrument is the pen, surgery begins
Air Max Nike, [?] suit, powder blue, deuce
Sweatpants rolled up a little bit
20 grand in each sock
Portfolio full of stocks
I’ma buy back the block
Invest in corporations
Paper into mom and pop’s shop
Putting our folks on top
What you know ‘bout
Really putting them on, looking out
We did it from the [?] nigga, this shit here must stop
It’s state of the art venue, now we sell out
Revolutionized, boosted the industry of pot
Even if they do not wanna admit
Really I don’t give a shit
I’m G’d the fuck up and I’m hella rich, look it up
Super tough, moving up in the world like elevators
Me and you like Roc-A-Fella Records in 2002
5 pounds of OG, a half p of Gorilla Glue
Writing a movie on the balcony, this could take a few
On the balcony where I take your boo
Back shots and a facial
Oh, how she disgrace you
Look at who you put your faith into
Funny thing about trust, everybody have some
Lesser of two evils, you’re gonna have to pick one
They bust Desert Eagles over funds like it’s fun
All full of drugs but running low on love
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
