Liam
What's up man?

All I need is you
See anything you want

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
You my bitch, ain't no time for hoe who can't if
Who can't walk in heels, who pussy smell like shit
If I told you tote that strap, you'll pop a lick
Never keep that drama you a real real, real real
I'm standing up like I rock it
I'm ready to blow and I ain't got to cock it
I got you wetter than ever
I'mma do it to ya begging me to stop it
You got the world in your pants
My heart in your hands
Ass softer than some jello
I'm gon' knock your boots into stilettos
Have your have your singing like Adele, (Hello)
Room full of chicks 'bout to line 'em up
If they go both ways I'mma sign them up
Girl take off them Vickys then take off my suit
Cause all I want is you and all you need is juice

[Hook: Liam Payne]
All I need is you
See anything you want
Anything you want girl
All I see is you (Tell 'em Liam)
Anything you want
Anything you open
All I need is you
Anything you want
Anything you want girl
All I see is you
Anything you want

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I bring the KK through you can grind it up
Work all day now its time to fuck
Coming up short no they not like us
Can't talk bank they got enough
Drink Bombay 'til I'm out of touch
Go good she gon' fall in love
Its been a long time since she got a nut
We can take our time we ain't got to rush
And nah she don't need no wedding ring
This the shit that we go through everyday
I let her know she can everything
Be a coach I can teach you how to run a play
Ba a boss tell you girls that you want to stay
Take if off when I give it don't run away
Your ex-boyfriend he a throw away
Seen him in the club hating the other day
But all I need is a big bag of weed and
You by my side, girl I know you down to ride
Big cribs got lots of those
Fast cars got lots of those
Khalifa man got lots of hoes
I ain't really thinking about 'em though

[Hook: Liam Payne]
All I need is you
See anything you want
Anything you want girl
All I see is you
Anything you want
Anything you open
All I need is you
Anything you want
Anything you want girl
All I see is you
Anything you want

[Outro: Juicy J & Liam Payne]
