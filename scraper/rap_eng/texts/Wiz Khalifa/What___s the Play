[Verse 1]
I'm a boss in the game
I deserve six rings
I go hard in the paint
They wanna know my number and my name
They swear to God I got a cheat code
I'm going for the three
This shit is easy like a free throw
I go beast mode
Ballin' on 'em
93 Mike Jordan on 'em
Swish nigga
It's all in the wrist nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
And we aim for the top everyday just to change our lives
Know the name, know the game
Know the things that they ain't gon' like
Not afraid to express what it takes so we made our own way
You not in the game, I call shots in the game like...

[Chorus]
Huh what's the play
Yeah what's the play
What's the play
Huh what's the play
What's the play
Yeah what's the play
What's the play
Huh what's the play

[Verse 2]
I'm on my Wayne Gretzky
I got so much ice on
Smoking on that strong pack, strong pack
Hit it hard, Mike Tyson
Sliding home plate, safe
Paid in full just like ace
But I ain't working at the cleaners
I get that pack and serve it like Serena
Ballin' on 'em
93 Mike Jordan on 'em
Touchdown
We got the club going up
I'm bout to roll something up

[Pre-Chorus]
And we aim for the top everyday just to change our lives
Know the name, know the game
Know the things that they ain't gon' like
Not afraid to express what it takes so we made our own way
You not in the game, I call shots in the game like...

[Chorus]
Huh what's the play
Yeah what's the play
What's the play
Huh what's the play
What's the play
Yeah what's the play
What's the play
Huh what's the play
