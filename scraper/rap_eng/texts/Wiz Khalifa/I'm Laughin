[Verse 1: Cory Gunz]
I’m full of myself – natural high, I’m pulling myself
Got my team, we’ve all got fam, nobody’s stomach’s full by itself
I hear the talkin’, they hatin’ – but I’m laughin’ in they faces, like…
No price to make the exchange, gave my life away to this game
Got my mics days ‘fore they came, my ice David is Blaine
I’m fresh to death and they know
I don’t give a middle finger ’bout none of them hoes
I was on the block and now I’m on the clock
‘Cause I was born to rock and y’all know I’m stoned
Young money, bitch, paid the dues – independent, major moves
Trukfit, YMCMB – can’t none of y’all…
If ain’t ’bout bank, don’t BS me
Got drink so dark like DFZ
Pain ‘fore play, no PS3
This thing ain’t no PSB

[Hook: Cory Gunz]
They hatin’ on me, I’m laughin’ … I’m laughin’
I’m laughin’, they hatin’ on me, I’m laughin’
They hatin’ on me, I’m laughin’ … I’m laughin’
I’m laughin’, keep hatin’ on me, I’m laughin’
They hatin’ on me, I’m laughin’ … I’m laughin’
I’m laughin’, they hatin’ on me, I’m laughin’
They hatin’ on me, I’m laughin’ … I’m laughin’
I’m laughin’, keep hatin’ on me, I’m laughin’

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I’ve got a foreign wife, I’ve got a foreign car
I get foreign money, and I’ve been goin’ far
Spend it all tonight, and get more tomorrow
I’m from outer space, I was born a star…
Instead of playin’ their part, niggas hatin’ hard, so I har-de-har
Get a hundred grand, I might take a flight and go party hard
Paris, done it, Vegas, done it, pick it, name it, they don’t want it
All my haters look surprised, but all my niggas seen it comin’
Always rollin’ up that stink, always got a shot to drink
…laughin’ all the way to the bank
And my car just pulled up…
Every time I see y’all, keep my weed jar filled up
Niggas smell that smoke and be like “bro, what is this?”
I’m leavin’ tracks when I skurt out
I’m on that pack, put that dirt out
I’m talkin’ loud, what you heard ’bout?
My nigga, pounds, but no work out
I’m talkin’ keys to the Chevy, 50 G’s to get ready
Need a pound of that lobster, we gon’ need some spaghetti
‘Cause my niggas is mobbin’, not to mention we ready
And you ain’t in our family…
Fuck nigga…
Never was, never will be, that's why I'm laughing at you
