[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: AxE Rifle]
I'm in a room thinking of you
Thinking about all the things we do
I was like a father and you were like a son
I'm sitting down thinking about all the fun
And all the memories we had done
I was the one that you looked up to
Only if you were here to knew
Now I'm all alone without a window to view
And now I know I'm never gonna get to see you again
I wish life wasn't really this hard
Dealing without seeing your face will tear me apart
But I do know that you'll always be in my heart
Only if you can hear this song so I can tell you I love you one more time
You were the one that would fight my crime
Now I have no one with me to walk on a mountain to climb
So now I could never see you for the rest of my life

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
