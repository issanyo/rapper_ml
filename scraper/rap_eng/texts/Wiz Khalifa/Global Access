[Intro]
You hear that?
It's paper
Its bout paper, get your money man
Get yours

[Verse 1]
Lay up, if you wanted me, I'm 6 o'clock
That mean I stay up
See you niggas standing in a line
I got my weight up
A lot of niggas owing dues, man
It's time to pay up
Smoke a joint with my girl every time we wake up
In your city, but don't plan on staying
If you ain't talking 30 million
Then we can't arrange it
Yeah
I treat the game like I'm renovating
They call me the landlord
I got all the tenants hating
Look at my tennis bracelet
There's all these diamonds in it
And plus my watch is icy too
That means it's time to get it
Yeah, I think they scared of me like I'm the dentist
Like it run in the fam, everyone 'round about our business
And I get high off fitness
That mean I'm smoking strong
Bet all these diamonds will you give you something to focus on
Your girl love my song
My chain cool the Fonz
My kush be the bomb
It sing like Solange

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't get dough?
All money
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't smoke?
Kush
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't rep Taylor?
Taylor Gang
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That we can't keep getting that paper?
Hell no

[Verse 2]
Big stunner, ex-weed runner
My bitch hotter than the middle of the summer
Rocking anything I want and
Still watch for undercovers
Like, I'm just on the sheet
Money make me feel complete
See, you don't do this everyday
That mean you can't compete
I'm on top of the game
But I came from underneath
Never tame me, I'ma beast
Watch my change increase
Used to just show up
But now I make them pay them fees
Used to smoke blunts
Now I need the paper
Being broke ain't in my nature
Either block out what they say
Or use the talk as motivation (uh)
We at the top and know they hating
Know sometimes they like the child that whine and get impatient
But there ain't no complaining

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't get dough?
All money
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't smoke?
Kush
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't rep Taylor?
Taylor Gang
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That we can't keep getting that paper?
Hell no

[Outro]
And that's how it is
I just got on the plane, you know what I'm saying?
Smelling like about 5 thousand dollars worth of Khalifa Kush
And I dare somebody to say something to me, motherfucker
Taylor Gang or die
And the gang is for gang
Yeah bitch, yeah
