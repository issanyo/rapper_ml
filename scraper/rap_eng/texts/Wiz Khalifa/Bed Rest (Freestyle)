You already know who the fuck it is man, Taylor

Uh, smoke Kush so I got no stress
Stuntin' it ain't no contest
Diamonds all in my Rolex, cuz' I go hard like P90X
See you dudes copyin' our moves, now you follow in our steps
Lil' kids just in the mirror, all insecure just trying to flex
Speakin' of Flex, shout out to Flex
And everyone else that said dude is next
Tell these lame niggas cut the check
Try the rest, now try the best
Gangsters, trippy niggas all here
With me nigga, my weed, so strong
My Brain, so gone, Ooh
Outer space

Solar, ooh
My Chain, polar, ooh
My bank, so long, ooh
Like I was playing poker ooh (poke-her ooh)
My face on the tele, so fuck what they tell me (what they tell me)
I always keep it real cuz' the people love the real me
They ran up on my bus cuz' police said they smell me
So me and L O L A, blow and smoke in LA

Flossin', Straight bossin', Take strains, we cross em'
My chains hang, they cost em', They hatin', we awesome
Throw back on drinkin' lately I've been thinkin'
I've been partyin' too much and livin' like the weekend
And then I think bout what my life could be
That's when I pour another drink and light this weed
You really sure you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Hook]
They say I'm livin' it
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Them, them haters, them ha-haters they sick of this
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
That, That paper, That pa-paper I'm gettin' it
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Them, them haters, them ha-haters they sick of this
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
