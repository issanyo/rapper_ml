[Verse 1]
They say the boy is sick and they can't diagnose my symptoms
Went and seen the doctor tryna find me a prescription
Told him since an early teen all I seen the color green
He said it ain't nothing wrong, probably wasn't listening
Listening, out of town
I'm anywhere the paper be
Grandma tell me go to church somebody need to pray for me
So I leave and go and see the preacher he said "holy smoke!"
See I'm nothing like you, my pockets got the holy ghost
From that side of town where you can get for the shorty low
Fuck about a price tag everything's affordable
And my homie told me you a nigga be a rich one
Why you on ya ass?
If you ain't got no money get sum

Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it

[Bridge]
If the streets know anything about me they know that I'm a ball
Different city every night I'm a star
And I don't need a piece I want it all
Tell em all
If the streets no anything about me they know that I'm a ball
Every night a different chick in my car
And I don't need a piece I want it all
Tell em all

[Hook]
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it

[Verse 2]
I wake up and think of bout how to get my paper
Then roll some and stink up say hi to all you haters
No teacher can school me I'm smart but not a scholar
Shit if I was a book Id be all about a dollar
I never had a job or something of that nature
I've been hustling since a cub had a buzz like a pager
You straight from the path and I'm on one that's narrow
I'm chasin' muchavo, that mucho deniro
Fresh like a Pharaoh, my clothes come from Cairo
The beat kick like Bruce Lee
My flow some like Pyro (Like Pyro?)
Like payroll and ain't afraid to spend it
That mean I'm getting money if you ain't got yours get it

[Hook]
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some Get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
