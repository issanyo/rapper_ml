I'm cool with the new me
Some niggas told me they wish I'd
Go back to the old me
But don't even know me!
Cause I be on some rich nigga shit
Guess they comfortable with the broke me
I blow by the O.Z
But you knew that and all you niggas knew this jack
And now you muthafuckas owe me
Some people ask why I be low-key
Guess I'm too real for me to act like I'm your homie
A lot of niggas try to get involved when they see you make it on your own
Hear they songs, but they not as real
Cause when you got it all, something's gotta give
And we ain't talking if it's not about a dollar bill

[Chorus]
I got so many things running through my mind...
Just drink and smoke, while the flow, unwinds...

Amazed how I get so much paper?
I'm more amazed how you could be such a hater!
Getting my lemonade squeezed fresh
No refrigerator touching my shit
Private island, waiter chef-made
Brother riding jet skis all day
Come home to bed already made for us
Niggas who's winning like it's the kind of name for us
Fucking champions cause we run the game, Forrest

[Chorus]
I got so many things running through my mind...
Just drink and smoke, while the flow, unwinds...

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
I mean why'd you do that?
How does that fall in line with your whole ideology of being a Taylor?

Taylors do what they want to do
That's the ideology about it
For me, personally, I prided myself on doing
Things that were different
And kinda like unacceptable and weird
So when I start seeing things become the norm
I kinda stray away from that
