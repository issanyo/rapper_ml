[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Aye, what up Krept
Konan, gang, Taylor, planes

[Hook: Konan]
Now she wanna know me
When she see the diamonds in the Rollie, yeah
Said she got a man
Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah
Gang, yeah, do it for the gang, yeah, gang yeah
Do it for the gang, yeah
Yeah she wanna know me
Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah

[Verse 1: Krept]
Bad B's , got a hundred choices
Two blunts, now she's double jointed
Neighbours ask what the fucking noise is
Nothing man, that’s just fucking noises
Oh, you know it's good if you cum that quick
And if she tie her hair back she ‘bout to suck that dick
Killed the game then went Casper
Been making bands, I’m the X Factor
Think they cool running shit
‘Til we come back and we dead sack ‘em
Hit the kitty cat, ain’t no brakes
Minus your clothes then get a takeaway
Watch the chest, I’m Flavor Flav
Cause she got some big titties
Wife hoes, you ain't serious
Bought her heels, you hilarious
White whip, red interiors
That’s a white chick on her period
Said she into girls, I’mma turn her straight
You gon’ learn today

[Hook: Konan]
Now she wanna know me
When she see the diamonds in the Rollie, yeah
Said she got a man
Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah
Gang, yeah, do it for the gang, yeah, gang yeah

Now she wanna know me
Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah

[Verse 2: Konan]
She said she saw me on the MOBOs, tell her go low
Got it all on the Gopro
(When she slow-mo
For the gang wearing no clothes)
Saying she in love with the coco
What you mean, you can’t twerk?
Tattoo on your arse, you better show me how that art work
You want the D? You better ask first
She see them blue ticks, now I can't swerve
Walk in, I'm like, "Nice to meet you"
If she ain't fucking then it's bye Felicia
Just make sure the bed's ready
She beautiful but her head's empty

[Hook: Konan]
Now she wanna know me
When she see the diamonds in the Rollie, yeah
Said she got a man
Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah
Gang, yeah, do it for the gang, yeah, gang yeah
Do it for the gang, yeah
Now she wanna know me
Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Black on black, pull up, I'm smokin' back to back
Jewelry, I got a lot of that
You the hottest nigga in Nebraska, where they do that at?
See you out there rockin' all them diamonds, where your shooters at?
Young Khalifa move that pack
Niggas out here slackin' on their pimpin', I ain't cool with that
Caught 'em slippin', lost the broad's attention, now she gone and missin'
Foreign play, Rollie be the Bay, like I'm goin' fishin'
No offense but this ain't for them niggas, this is for them bitches
Handouts, I ain't givin' nothin'
See that ass from the front, poke it out, give me somethin'
Why you playin'? She don't do it for the 'Gram
But she do it for the fam, they don't front, they know just who I am
Damn...

[Hook: Konan]
Now she wanna know me
When she see the diamonds in the Rollie, yeah
Said she got a man
Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah
Gang, yeah, do it for the gang, yeah, gang yeah

Now she wanna know me
Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah
