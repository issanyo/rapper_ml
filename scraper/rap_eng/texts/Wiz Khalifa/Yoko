[WIZ KHALIFA]

Shades on, polo white t
Me leaving here alone that's unlikely
Not a stoner bitch but she like me
Tryna get that final cut like Spike Lee
I check them ho's, direct them ho's
Take em home and let them ho's
Go about they fantasies, they poppin' pills I'm rollin' weed
We been got a couple bad bitches overseas
Out the back this ain't no tax
When I'm shoppin' and my bag filled with options so dont ask
What it cost, I'm in the maserati coupe going so fast
That I lost her and my bitch gots so much swag
That these bad bitches on this, ah, ki-killing ya'll pow
Blahh dead get a coffin

Call it Yoko Ono, ono, only ride solo, solo , solo
Mission for the dodo, dodo, dodo
One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive, she a man eater
Scheme man diva, she might of believe cuz you could never leave her
You will never have her so you could never keep her
Trippin' on the next man he can't have her either
I call it Yoko Ono
[BERNER]

Bust a couple benz, blow a hundred fast (a hundred cash)
I just made a hundred off a fifty bag
Where dem bad asian bitches holdin' down my city at
Where dem girls from the eight with that pretty face
Round thing yeah I'm on that loud thang
Pop another bottle shootin' corks at the crowd dang
Yeah, I'm a stunna but nah, I ain't baby though
Young do, with the lazy flow
Watch all these ladies go
Crazy when I pull up right beside em
I do a buck 30 yeah, I'm just in the flyin'
I smell like dirty money plus it's cookie that I'm lightin'
Big buckets full of ice with bottles on fire inside em, uh
Call it Yoko Ono, ono, only ride solo, solo , solo
Mission for the dodo, dodo, dodo
One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive, she a man eater
Scheme man diva, she might of believe cuz you can never leave her
You will never have her so you could never keep her
Trippin on the next man he can't have her either
I call it Yoko Ono
[BIG K.R.I.T.]

Kush it up in right there, way you send the messages
Talkin' bout a night care
She tell you she like
You tell her you might ,.
She pretend you she a jam, really you quite well
She just bought a nice bed
Wrist game, ice pad, prada clutch, price tag, , put her in the game
Cause you hope that she a high bid
So you can go along on the beat, catch a spike there
You could never wife that, never ever pipe that
Good enough to make her settle down, she ain't like that
Punch a nigga in the mouth, yeah nigga fight back
ROll a nigga weed up, ask him ask him where da light at
Call it Yoko Ono, ono, only ride solo, solo , solo
Mission for the dodo, dodo, dodo
One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive, she a man eater
Scheme man diva, she might of believe cuz you can never leave her
You will never have her so you could never keep her
Trippin on the next man he can't have her either
I call it Yoko Ono
