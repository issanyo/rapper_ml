Yeeeahhh
You know they say, God said, to whom he gives
Much is expected... Im living proof of that...
Got me drinkin this liquor...
Smokin this weed...
I been through it though

You see before this rap shit, i ain't really have no problems
Now i gotta carry revolvers, cause niggas is starving
And i ain't gave a plate out yet
Im goin hard and i ain't played out yet
And them hoe niggas talkin, i got somethin to say bout that
They talk greasy when they see me dog they ain't bout that
Niggas be feeling personalities and bang on wax
Im 100 you can bank on dat
Got my bank all fat
Yeah im doing my thang here
Heard my first track thinkin thats when i came here
Was actually raised here
But wasn't born who could give a fuck
My whole family as far as i can go back stays here
Its not a mystery
This where i graduated high school, went to middle school and elementary
So dont say shit to me
Cause bitch if i ain't the prince
Show me who the fuck it is, if it isnt me
You niggas history im lookin like the future
Only know how to ball something like a hooper
Swishas of that cali bomb smellin like a fruit cup
Yeah, i got heart but never claimed to be too tough
But never said that my homies dont shoot stuff
Real street niggas no talkin just do stuff
In the club patron and lime juiced up
Reppin that Rostrum, heavy huslte im trued up
Im wit some dudes you used to see blued up
On a get money swag we done moved up
Big crib nice chain, the new truck
Some say im doing good i say i dont do much, but go hard
Niggas say i wouldn't be shit with no squad, ha, ya so smart
Cause i was just 16 rappin with no job
Met chad and benji and now im a young star
He and hard basically molded the young boy
Thats why they do shit for me but they won't record yall
Knew i was the one when they first heard the boy talk
Got a horror flick flow, came to murder all em up
Addicted to it now its like im servin all em soft
Got my pockets all fat like im Sherman off the Klumps my money come in lumps
Yall dont really wanna get funky
Nothing but a bunch of funny acting chumps and i had shit boxed since day one
I dont advise niggas to say nun
You something like a clone, ima be known as one of them great ones
For those gone i roll and blaze some ya dug me

Time just goes by, and i dont know why i stay high
Time just goes by, and i dont know why i stay high
Time just goes by, and i dont know why i stay high
Time just goes by, and i dont know why i stay high

YEAH
Shits crazy man, (shits crazy), Seem like...
Niggas just wanna see you fucked up out here
Soon as you start doing good thats when shit change
They expect you to change but you know...
This the way we supposed to be
I thought we was supposed to move up
Fuck you mad at me for...(niggas startin' to get real jealous)
Ya know, got me stressed the fuck out man
Looking left and right before i go in my crib
(im too young for this shit) watching every move i make
And for what (nothing) Rest in Peace to Jayla Brown
(Rest in Peace) Rest in Peace Maina Ward (Rest in Peace)...412
