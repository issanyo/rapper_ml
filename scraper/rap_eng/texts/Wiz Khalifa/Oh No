[Verse 1]
Let me set it straight cake like a heavy weight
Still got a squad of crews moving that heavy weight
I'm past most of you lames
Brake fast off in the lane
You just ashamed cause you playin' and I'm coaching the game
Hat cocked to the side wide birds flock to the guys
Ride that Glock to ya side flyin' that hospital ride
I'm bout my money dummy
So we can take it there
All you need is 4, 5 niggas so we can make it fair
Take a pair, I'mma go
Hard till a nigga drop
Bigga chain, hundred cars
Starbursts is in the watch, oc
With these bars and lines
I dun' scarred some minds
Great plus the baby face got the whores in line
But the difference is wit yours and mine
I'm with a group of tens, friend
It's the march of dimes
(yea)
Cause I'm the lady lover, crazy since the 80's fucka
Nasty flow, scrappy no
Hate or love us baby brother
If rap was movin' packs I'm servin' pounds now
Yeah, you hot in ya hood I'm burnin' towns down
My main purpose to surface and switch the style round
The games turned to a circus too many clowns now
So move with the pump
Grab your tools split your blunts
Cruise with the crews that'll bruise if they hit you up
See I'm the cake'o'holic
Tryna' make this paper brolic
Trip or scrap listen this a rap man it's safe to call it

[Hook x2]
My weights up how I handle these beats
So wake up
I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow
Cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap
Niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"

[Verse 2]
Oh no keep an eye out for the po po
Bigger raps make my figures stack like a totem pole
Bigger stacks on to bigger gats on the road yo
Spittin crack, sick of niggas act like you don't know
Sittin' back, twistin' somethin' fat
It's that hydro
I know, it's a rap
Creepin' through the side door
Wiz Khalifa murk the game
Youngin' but my mind grown
It's a keeper worth some change
Youngin' leave ya mind blown
And when the winter get cool I switch the time zones
You's a beginner you fool, the dumbest I've know
You steady frontin' and rhymin'
Say you puttin' ya time in
Claimin' that you in diamonds but they rhinestones
See I'll crack a man
I don't wanna clap a man
So I put the cheese on ya head
Like a Packers fan
A hundred niggas in all black gon' pack a van
Hop out and get the shit to clappin' like in Pakistan
See I'll pack a stand
Say you deep but know you not
Bubble music blowin' pop
Pause I'm as hard as rock
All you other artists stop braggin' on the DVD
Fag is what you seem to be and tragic what it means to me
Laughin' when I see you be
Askin' if you think it's me
Relaxin' with my faction and we stackin' cheese repeatedly
And chicks dig the kid
Cook, clean, and ride for me
Birds flock cuz I'm hot
Stop you see a flying V
