{Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa} Correct

Uh, Floating off wax
Ask where I been going, The trust where I'm at
In a brand new Porsche, blowing strong
Man, you can do anything when your money long
Like tat your whole body
All this hard work I put in catching up finally
And I travel so much, got me thinking all cloudy
And my niggas all rowdy
And you know I got that strong when I pull up, it's not a prolly
Can't come to my hotel room, I got goons in the lobby, Church
I milk the game for what it's worth
I smoking more than what you're worth
Ridin through my city, did a bunch of dirt
Balmain that's an expensive shirt
Bout money but the TRUST is first
Niggas turn into fans but they was buster's first
And there's nothing worse
Wax thicker than some Mrs.Butterworth's
Better throw it in the freezer
Smoke till I got amnesia
Still shop at teesa
Y'all know the procedure, hands up!

Yeah, mhm
Khalifa man, Beedie what up?
Taylor Gang
Nah, I ainâ€™t go lie, man, I'm high as fuck!
