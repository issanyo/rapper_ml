[Intro]
New benz
Cop one for you and your friends
Papers two
Rolling papers two
I only do what gangsters do

[Verse 1]
Through with the basics
You think it's a spaceship when I ride through
Feel like I'm on ice, we just glide
Niggas is parasites
I get pussy in a pair of off-whites
Know I want it, you can see it my eyes, surprise
'Cause I visualized it
Always knew I was the man
You just realized it
Don't need a detector, I can see the lies
I'm a different type of being
Drive the type of whip your bitches like to be in
Smoke got my eyes lookin' Korean
Every time that I fly, VIP'n
All of my nigga's ride
Two joints, that's double homicide
Got you rolling papers to me while you gettin' high
We went from coppin' it to supplyin'
Be there at the drop of a dime
All else fails, I can depend on mine
Fuck signs, my niggas gettin' high
Party of flyest, Taylor gang or resign

[Verse 2]
Why you even come back to my crib if you ain't stayin'?
Ridin' with some real niggas, know that we ain't playin'
Pockets on swole and you know that I keep them faces
Money through the roof, I just crash it and replace it
All my bitches bad, I don't fuck her if she basic
Lotta niggas in the game, Khalifa man, the greatest
Blowin' all this money, need someone to help me save it
Lickin' on me all night, she said she love my flavor
Homie, I'm a boss baby, I don't need no favors
Got so many cars, I don't got room for my neighbors
Got a bad broad, but you know me, I might take her
Fuck about a bitch though, I'm all about my paper
Khalifa man will stick to the code, no I don't save her
Suckin' on me good, treat me like a Now and Later
Breakfast in the morn', we can get our dinner catered
Try to hit my phone, I don't pick up 'cause I'm faded

[Chorus]
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in

[Verse 3]
Anything I want, I pull up and stunt
Parking in the back, we can't do the front
Real niggas pay the papers, a plus
Ain't with the gang, you can't sit with us
Take them bitches phones, ain't no thang, we don't trust 'em
Send 'em for the gangs, why they came, we don't love 'em
Takin' all our time, we don't need to rush
Smellin' like the KK, it's serious
Grind every day, 'cause the process I trust in
Think they the way, but they bluffin'
Baby, I can spend it all, don't care how much it's costing
Grind and you get all this, my niggas is ballin'

[Chorus]
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in

[Outro]
Two joints, that's double homicide
Got your bitch jumpin' in my ride
She with the gang and she down to fly
Rolling papers up and gettin' high
