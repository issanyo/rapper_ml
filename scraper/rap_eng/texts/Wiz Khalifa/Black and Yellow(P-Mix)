[Intro: Wiz Khalifa(P-Dog)]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow(Let’s get this party started!)
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow, black and yellow (P-MIX!)
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screamin' that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot: that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamond, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

Back at it again, boi, this time it’s with P
I was drinkin’ that Coolaid, chased the cat up the tree
P called me up, said “Hey, dude, let’s make a mix”
Took a couple flights to Pittsburgh in my new P kicks
Now I got 4 more to set the tone for this track
Call me the pressure boy, baby, but I ain't never gonna frack
I'm sportin' black and yellow, purp and yellow, like a fellow, shout a bellow
Gonna draw the crowds out tonight as if I'm the third cello

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screamin' that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot: that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamond, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 2: PØ17]

Here we go, first time, P-Mix, with my homie Wiz
Black and yellow like Sora's shoes, solve the mystery of DiZ
Waking up from my slumber, homie and bae got my number
I'm saving princesses and stompin' Koopa's like I'm a plumber
We goin' throwback, Limit Form
