[Verse 1: Jonny Goood]
I ain't never gonna change
There ain't a damn thing different, but my money in a game
Now I'm givin' big tips through some hundreds, make it rain
Cause I'm rulin' in this bitch I'm Jonny Good Good, Good, Good
Still smoke 'til I pass out
You sound cool, I'm the best out
My flow is tight, got a nice bounce
You niggas hope that I jack out
I'm dope though, I'm decked out and gold ropes from my neck down
I stay true, rep the same town from East Hills where it goes down
Said I'm king of the Hills and you niggas are slaves (niggas are slaves, niggas are slaves)
I do what I want, give a fuck what you say (fuck what you say, fuck what you say)
I made you niggas consume all the shit that I do, you hate to admit, but you're lovin' me fool
UGH
I'm from the bottom like Drake now I'm high as the moon

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa
I ain't never gon' change, I'ma always stay the same
I ain't never gon' change, I'm still gettin' money with my niggas
I ain't never gon' change
Still reppin' from the same block
I ain't never gon' change, I'm still gettin' money with my niggas

[Verse 2: Jonny Good]
Don't need no machine cause I am on the ready
You niggas are fake and you built with confetti
I came in so hard that the game wasn't ready
Now I'm movin' so fast and my aim is so steady
I'm not changin', just a ruin
Fuck the fame im just the cool kid
412 where I be coolin' .Boolin'
Boy in my hood my musics boomin' and my moneys to the roof and my fly fashion got 'em droolin' (dr, dr, droolin')
I'm stayin' the same never reachin' for fame
I'm reachin for dough and you niggas are lame
I'm smokin' a joint and she pullin' my chain (Pullin' my chainnn)
I promised to God I never will change, give me a grammy I'll give it away
Ain't worried 'bout shit and my friends are the same

[Hook]
I ain't never gon' change, I'ma always stay the same
I ain't never gon' change, I'm still gettin' money with my niggas
I ain't never gon' change
Still reppin' from the same block
I ain't never gon' change, I'm still gettin' money with my niggas
I ain't never gon' change, I'ma always stay the same
I ain't never gon' change
Still gettin' money with my niggas

OWWWWW! (Ughhyuuh)
I ain't never gon' change
Still reppin' from the same block
I ain't never gon' change, still gettin' money with my niggas
