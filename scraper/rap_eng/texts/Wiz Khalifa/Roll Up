[Verse 1: Gianni]
Yo, it's your anniversary, isn't it
And your man ain't acting right
So you packin’ your Damier luggage up, callin’ my cell phone, try and catch a flight
You know one thing straight, I’ll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home, that's your man, soon as you land you say that's all me
But shit ain't all G with him no more, you ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago, you ain't been the same
Not sayin I’m the richest man alive, but I’m in the game
As long as you keep it 100, I'ma spend this change

[Chorus: Gianni]
Whenever you need me
Whenever you want me
You know you can call me, I’ll be there shortly
Don’t care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie
I ain't gonna flex, I’m not gonna front
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I'll roll up, I'll roll up, I'll roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I'll roll up, I'll roll up, I'll roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I'll roll up

[Verse 2: Gianni]
Stop, uh
I try to stay out your business
But on the real, you’re so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin' up, your man's gonna catch onto us
And that white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers
And if you roll, I got a spot where I can put you on this medical, and send you home doctored up
You wanna ride with me 'cause you say that he boring
Wake up, you rollin’ weed, cooking eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money, you know I'll get more of it
...is in the sky, now you say you in orbit

[Chorus: Gianni]
Whenever you need me
Whenever you want me
You know you can call me, I’ll be there shortly
Don’t care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie
I ain't gonna flex, I’m not gonna front
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I'll roll up, I'll roll up, I'll roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I'll roll up, I'll roll up, I'll roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I'll roll up
Stop
