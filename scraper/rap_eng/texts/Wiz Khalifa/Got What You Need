[Hook: L.C.]
I got what you need
The fetti and the cheese
The moola and the guap
Got moola and the guap
I got what you need
The fetti and the cheese
The moola and the guap
Got moola and the guap

[Verse 1: Lavish]
I got what need, boy, ya want it
That nigga price high
Mine cheap, so they love it
Do it big, shake 'em off
And these haters wish I wasn't
All about my job
And my guap keep it comin
Who you foolin boy? I does it
Your girl said she loves it
Pocket full of guap, and that moola keep it comin
Heavy hustle, Rostrum Records
On it big, man, its nothin
Cigarillo full of that Rain Man, I call her fresh puffin
It's-it's-it's smellin super bad; call me MC puffin
Stick that thing in oven
Turn it up and make muffins
Money comin up, that moola and the green
Money comin in, I chop it up between my team
I'm a star in the air
Doin big things
Why you think your lady stare
I'm stuntin like a stunna do
Fresh when I want to
Do my shit in front of you
Money everywhere
Look, dumbie, right in front of you

[Hook: L.C.] X2

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah..
I'm fresh up off the plane
I hit the town straight from tourin
I don't run up and down the court
But you can say I'm ballin
The money's not a problem
So you know they gon hate
When they see them yellow diamonds
You should see them hoes' face
I'mma need a whole case
Hit the club
And pop them bottles
In it with my thugs
Spendin dubs
Like no tomorrow
I make a lot of chavo
And meet a lot of bus-downs
Saw me in the club once
Shawty got a crush now
Don't got the time
Got a line
Of sexy women
Wanna fuck the team cuz they seen how we be spendin
Rock expensive linen
Yeah that baggy shit is finished
When you gettin money
Everything is fitted
Listen
This ain't nothin close
To most
Of you niggas, weirdos
My swagga is on one, followed by a zero-zero
I got up in her earhole
She hopped up in my seats
Told her ride with a G
If you like what you see
Cuz I..

[Hook: L.C.] X2

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I got what ya need
A blunt for ya trees
A lot of pipe for all that you got stuffed in them jeans
My ride got screens
I'm high, I got a lean
But I don't sip purple
I smoke a lot of green
300 dolla jeans
Tight white tee
I look at you and tell you to get right
Like me
And check your main broad
Because she might like me
Waitin for the right time
And tonight might be
--annhaa!--
She say she want a nigga with that moola and that guap
They see me, I don't have to say shit to em, bro, they flock
And as for all them hatin niggas, ooh I got 'em hot
They recognize that I'm on number two and ain't gon stop (two)
I rep my city (city)
Floodin my P (P)
Canary yellow diamonds
Lookin like my chain peed (wow)
A pocket full a dollas
My nigga, I gangreen (yup)
So if you bout your money
Boy I'm bout the same thing (yeah)
