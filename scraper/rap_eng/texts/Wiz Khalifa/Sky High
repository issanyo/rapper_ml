Yeah they talk but I can't hear what they say
Cause I'm flyin sware they see me but I'm too many miles away
Cause I'm flying in the air your all the way down and I'm flyin
To the sky I don't touch the ground! I'm flyin
So high I can touch the sky [x8]

[Verse 1]
I’m living this movie, you niggas like TiVo
See the same things twice, nothing like me though
Man they can dream, flow like a whole kilo
Now I got your bitch, try and find me like nemo
Spend a lot of cash, can’t front I might leave broke
One life to live, 800 on the weed smoke
Stacks for them Guccis like, fuck it im'a need those
Young superstar, but were feelin like heroes
Top down, and im flying like an eagle
Tats on my neck, face, hands like a cholo
All about my Green, bout my Green like Gino
Stars in my face, no scars no Cino
Smile hard, (hard) swag real mean though
Paid enough for it, show my ass with my jeans low
Started from the bottom, now made it like zero
/got it on lockdown, feeling like nino

[Hook]
Yeah they talk but I can't hear what they say
Cause I'm flyin sware they see me but I'm too many miles away
Cause I'm flying in the air your all the way down and I'm flyin
To the sky I don't touch the ground! I'm flyin
So high I can touch the sky [x8]

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in florida yeah they know me there too
Walkin with jewels out showin all my tattoos
Can't say my name right but they know I'm that dude
Walk 54 place niggas eatin fast food
Brother out in Lauderdale cousin down in FAMU
So that means I got a plug good drugs when I land too
Know I'm underage not much that I can't do
You don't talk money that's why I can't understand you
See I'm hot now going for a grammy though
Think this bitch bad you should see my Miami ho
Down in south beach met her at the Cameo
Told her what my life like took her to the Sagamore
100 grand on my neck just cause I gotta glow
Never buyin dubs, whole zips what I gotta blow
Always dressed to impress you can tell
She love my cologne that's money that you smell yeah!

[Hook]
Yeah they talk but I can't hear what they say
Cause I'm flyin sware they see me but I'm too many miles away
Cause I'm flying in the air your all the way down and I'm flyin
To the sky I don't touch the ground! I'm flyin
So high I can touch the sky [x8]
