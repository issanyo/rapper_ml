[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Is you rollin' up but you don't feel nothin'?
That's a simple conversation
Baby is ya fuckin' with a real one?
That's a simple conversation (x3)
Why these niggas keep hatin'?
That's a simple conversation

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Hop up in the whip, smokin' on the shit, you gon' need ventilation
OG tastin', don't smoke till ya choke, get the dope, don't waste it
I'd rather chill wit' a bad bitch, and see a bitch nigga later
Nah, nigga, I ain't waitin' up, nah nigga, I ain't waitin'
Niggas still hatin', niggas still on the shit
Bitches still on a nigga dick, word to the clique
Every verse like a bird, think I'm servin' a brick
Ya heard me? That's a simple conversation
Leanin' in my ride and smokin' weed up out a paper
Come to Gs, I got a nation, weed and gin, the combination
Need to legalize it!

[Hook]
Is you rollin' up but you don't feel nothin'?
That's a simple conversation

That's a simple conversation (x3)

That's a simple conversation

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
Broke ass nigga, stop hatin'
I'm fuckin' hoes off simple conversation
Keep it real, I ain't even gotta say shit
Whip the dick out, make the freak bitch taste it
Gears on the steering wheel, [?] race it
Grew up in a spaceship, shot right past
Smellin' like a bag, smokin' out the bag, sunny boy had
So many mothafuckin' hundreds in my hand, flashin'
Baby is ya fuckin' wit' a real one?
All these pussy ass niggas, I'll kill one
I'm in the mothafuckin' trap, vac-sealing
Breaking and rebuilding, snapping and concealing
Keep the heat compressor, straighten up the extra
Bankroll, you goin' hard, you a big flexer
I'm on the phone talkin' money, simple conversation
These broke ass niggas, they still waitin'

[Hook]
Is you rollin' up but you don't feel nothin'?
That's a simple conversation
Baby is ya fuckin' with a real one?
That's a simple conversation (x3)
Why these niggas keep hatin'?
That's a simple conversation

[Verse 3: Reese]
Money talk, talk money, that's a simple conversation
Three cellphones [?] nigga, that's how the plug conversatin', aye
My link was juugin' right back cross the nation, aye
I'm fuckin' up money, sometimes you gotta pace it, aye
Live from the bando, my partner operation
SS Camaro, nothin' like a star racin'
I buss on her chin, now she all in my facial
Hot sauce, I need a pay-cation
It could all be so simple, that's a little conversatin'
My niggas ain't bluffin' wit' you, that choppa gon' erase ya!
