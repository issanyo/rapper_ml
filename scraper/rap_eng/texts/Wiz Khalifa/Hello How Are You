[Verse 1: Leon Thomas]
Looking through my phone, passed by your number
Yeah do you remember, yeah do you remember
Last December I lent you my sweater
Yeah do you have it?
On my way to work I can grab it

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Been a while since I seen you
So I’m thinking bout picking you up
Taking you out, riding you round
Letting the top down
Letting you hang out
Both arms out
Flying for real say you love how it feel
I got my hands on the wheel
We can go to Vegas
Don’t care what no one’s saying
We don’t even gotta stay
Just came here to get turnt up and play this
Or, we could just get stoned
Buy red cups and take shots at home
To me we just too grown
To get messed up and spend nights alone
I like to party, you like to party
I got the paps who got the Molly
I got the dranks you at the bar
I’m acting straight
You back and forth, you acting hard (to get)
