[Intro]
League of Stars
Sorry Jaynari

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Still do this shit better
So why you fuckin' that nigga
He don't even ride foreign
He say he on deck
He might get it wet, but I get it wetter (yea)
I get it wetter yea
I do it much better
I get it wetter ooo

[Verse 1: AD]
I know you tired of these other niggas
I run the streets but I ain't nothing like these other niggas
You got your own and hold it down
That's why I'm fucking with you
Take off the night lets have a round girl Imma come and get you
Appreciation I know you used to them same lines
You waste your time when they keep shooting you them same lies
Get ya hair did let me see that lil hang time
She know I'm hood but made me put away them gang signs
You give it to me and I swear that I would over-please
Clear water island swimmin' too you while we overseas
You say your heart got a lock well let me hold the key
Tell the world who it is let 'em know it's me (they know it's me)
They can have the single life, I'm designed for two
Ignore the bitches in the past let me ride with you
Make you laugh, make you smile, that's what I can do
Forget the DM's let me slide with you

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Still do this shit better
So why you fuckin' that nigga?
He don't even ride foreign
He say he on deck
He might get it wet, but I get it wetter (yea)
I get it wetter yea
I do it much better
I get it wetter ooo

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Park the whip out front
Pull up it's a 6-4 dunk
Bring your friend it's a plus
Ain't the gang then it ain't no trust
Man these girls be scandalous
Gotta worry about where the cameras is
I'm just lookin' for a candidate
I want percentage like your management
Buy the Bombay, when I come through
I rep the gang cuz I'm supposed too
Yo bitch in my old school
You niggas broke I don't know you
Imma keep it real witchu
Y'all niggas fake I don't deal witchu
I'll pick up the bill for you
Imma treat you real official
(Hahaha, what up AD?)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Still do this shit better
So why you fuckin' that nigga?
He don't even ride foreign
He say he on deck
He might get it wet, but I get it wetter yea
I get it wetter yea
I do it much better
I get it wetter ooo

[Chorus to fade]
