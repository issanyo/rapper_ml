[Chorus]
Real deal, Holyfield
All my niggas real
Actin' brand new
Why the fuck you here
Uh, real deal, Holyfield
All my niggas real
Actin' brand new
Why the fuck you here

[Verse 1]
Uh, diamonds chill
All my niggas in the field
Money, pill, I'm a boss
They hatin' still
Chevy grill, hunnid mill
Always real
Never fail, don't "I will"
I don't chill

[Chorus]
Real deal, Holyfield
All my niggas real
Actin' brand new
Why the fuck you here
Uh, real deal, Holyfield
All my niggas real
Actin' brand new
Why the fuck you here

[Verse 2]
I'ma get high, for real
I'ma get mine, for real
I'm doin' my time, for real
I'm on my grind, for real
My diamonds gon', shine for real
It stay on my mind, for real
Take a paper plane, fill it up with kush
Goin' hard so you never say we lose

[Chorus]
Real deal, Holyfield
All my niggas real
Actin' brand new
Why the fuck you here
Uh, real deal, Holyfield
All my niggas real
Actin' brand new
Why the fuck you here
