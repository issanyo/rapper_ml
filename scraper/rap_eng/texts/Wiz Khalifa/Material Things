[Intro]
Lyrica
I know what you need, that's me
She just want your love on material things

[Verse 1]
Here we go, here we go, coming to you live in your area
My girls on a mission, you and your boys come with us
Seen you're taken, but your main girl ain't got no flavor
She gon' be hatin', when I get to playin'
You know, yeah, you might come home with a real one
Booty realyou can feel on, yea-yeah

[Chorus]
I know what you need, that's me
She just want your love on material things
You should spend some time, with me
I just want your love not material things
Woa-oh-oh, woa-oh-oh, oh-ah oh, oh-ah oh
Woa-oh-oh, woa-oh-oh
I just want your love not material things, oh

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa:]
Uh, tryna break that habit, but I run right through you
Tryna take you slow, but I run right to you
Take you down and get licked, I could taste you all on my lips
Brought some dank to roll with my clique
This that bomb shit that you gon' miss
When I'm in you you keep tellin' me that it's so good
But your home girls keep tellin' you that I'm no good
Ehe-ehe-ehe-ehe

[Chorus]
I know what you need, that's me
She just want your love on material things
You should spend some time, with me
I just want your love not material things
Woa-oh-oh, woa-oh-oh, oh-ah oh, oh-ah oh
Woa-oh-oh, woa-oh-oh
I just want your love not material things, oh
I know what you need, that's me
She just want your love on material things
You should spend some time, with me
I just want your love not material things
Woa-oh-oh, woa-oh-oh, oh-ah oh, oh-ah oh
Woa-oh-oh, woa-oh-oh
I just want your love and material things, oh
