Yes, sir!
Is the boy wiz khalifa, man!

I’m down here… so come holla at me
I came to kick it with my man, dj… you understand?
The whole town…
Shut up, stay bye
You know me!
The hottest around
Do this! yes!
I would tape that will light the talk as if it’s all now…
I ain’t about the …this bitch made ain’t the type of this …
You want me to switch blade like the knife i’m sharp
God damn, man!
I mixed steps to…
Yes, I was blessed to outlast you
My… so yes, i’m at the castle!
Put up big numbers, i’m not a little nigga
You do it way big, i’m just a little bigger!
And I move with the unit, I move …
Just stupid, you’re losing bitch!
Hey! and I ain’t here to entertain you, fools
I’m here to snatch my… give you lames, the news!
You all stay and impose… i’m on my job
Writing gems and flaws
..with a bird, no cameras, no
Long gone, i’m on the …lurking in the…
And it’s for certain i’m a channel
Because i’m perfect with the rhyme
And i’m hurting niggers, hey!
When the boss in the place gets paused in his way
Cause sees a skinny nigga
But its large in his ways
It could be the car or your face, bitch!
