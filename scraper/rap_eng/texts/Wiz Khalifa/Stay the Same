[Hook: Juicy J]
They say money make you change up
Fuck it then, I'm tryina change up
Yeah, I'm tryina get my change up
Bitch, I'm just tryina fuck the game up
(Woah) You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
(Uh) You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
(Uh) You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
Hell no, boy, I'm tryina fuck the game up

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Started from the bottom, then I came up
Niggas still broken tryna' blame us
I'd be on fire, they just flame up
You can never understand where I came from
Uh, you think I worked this hard to stay the same?
Hell no, we'd be in the thangs switching lane to lane
Bitch, you're still broke, I ain't the one to blame
Do your thing, just don't hate the player, nigga hate the game
Woah, woah, I work to esteem, to a beamer, pretty motto bitch
Pussy wet as Aquafina
I got things I used to dream of, everything a little cleaner
Every time a nigga see me, I'm in something new

[Hook: Juicy J]
They say money make you change up
Fuck it then, I'm tryina change up
Yeah, I'm tryna' get my change up
Bitch, I'm just tryna' fuck the game up
You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
Hell no, boy, I'm tryna' fuck the game up

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Started off broke, now I'ma change up
Nigga you ain't nothing, you are stranger
Seen you in the club upon the lame stuff
Probably cause your chick gave the thang up
Anywhere I'm at, get my gang up
You be in the cut with your chain tucked
You be into snitching giving names up
I ain't into that so I can’t look, can’t touch, can’t fake
Never met a chick that I can't take
Never had a patience, so I can't wait
Never been a hater, so I can't hate

[Hook: Juicy J]
They say money make you change up
Fuck it then, I'm tryina change up
Yeah, I'm tryna get my change up
Bitch, I'm just tryna' fuck the game up
You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
You think I worked this hard to stay the same?
Hell no, boy, I'm tryna fuck the game up

[Outro: Juicy J]
Broke bitches all in my business
Only thing worse is a bunch of broke niggas
You know how niggas get it when a nigga ain't getting it?
What's the use of making money if a nigga can't spend it?
I got broke bitches all in my business
Only thing worse is a bunch of broke niggas
You know how niggas get it when a nigga ain't gettin' it?
What's the use of making money if a nigga can't spend it?
