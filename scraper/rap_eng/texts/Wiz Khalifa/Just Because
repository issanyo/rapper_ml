[Verse 1]
This a feeling I wish could never end
Remember days they didn't let us in but now we in this bitch, rollin up medicine in my kush stronger than it ever been
My bitch don't know better than my clique, down for whatever
Thinking back, first time in Vegas, when I caught my first suite, thinking I was major
Looking at it all the light smoking on the paper
Thinking how to get it out my grind, second nature
I don't ever wait
I love the rush, I don't hesitate
I'm trying to teach my son a better way
Watch who you call your friends
Watch who you left right in your 9 11
Watch who you left sleeping at night at your crib
Its tatted on me: loyalty, and dog that's all I live
Some decent beats about a bitch to smoke this chronic with
I hit the streets
I'm fly as fuck, they say I'm on my shit
These unreleased and no receipts
They know about the kid
