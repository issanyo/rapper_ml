[Verse 1: Miguel]
These lips, can't wait to taste your skin, baby
And these eyes, can't wait to see your grin

[Hook 1: Miguel]
Let my love, just let my love adorn you, please baby
And you gotta know, you gotta know
You know that I adore you, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Baby these fist will always protect ya, lady
And this mind will never neglect you, yeah baby
Oh baby, and if they try to break us down
Don't let that affect us, no baby

[Hook 2: Miguel & Wiz Khalifa]
You just gotta let my love, let my love
Let my love adorn you
Ah, le-le-le-let it dress you down
You gotta know, you gotta know, know that I adorn you, just that babe
Let my love adorn you baby
Don't you ever, don't you let nobody tell you different baby
That boy can sing man, Miguel and Young Khalifa
Always adorn you, you gotta know now, you gotta know now now now

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Sippin' red wine
I roll another one up, but then its bedtime
Take one look at my watch, yeah, that's real time
Got a lot on my plate, I'm down to share mine
Keep it real with you, be honest, I'm tryna feel with you
A little life, you play your cards right, then I can deal with you
Say you don't like all this money, you peel soon
As you see the shit you got me doin', and you know that it's real
You've got your boy frontin' the bill, opening doors
Buying the chef, closing the store
You don't even got a question, you know what it's for
I can say I'll give you the world, but you know that it's yours, uh

[Hook/Outro: Miguel & Wiz Khalifa]

Haha, yeah, lemme hear that
Oh yeah, the same way that the stars adorn the skies
Now look up sugar, the same way that my whole worlds' in your eyes
Oh and it's time now, just let, let my love adorn you baby
Le-le-le-let it dress you down
You got to know baby, oh you got to know, that I adore you, yeah
Oh love ain't never looked so good on ya
Oh, put it on, baby, let my love adorn... You
