[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Niggas talking like they stunting
But real niggas ain't stupid
Who you think you fooling
You gon have to come prove it
You know me I'm a OG
I don't say it unless I do it
Got a pistol off in my 550 nigga don't make me use it
You rap niggas is clueless
Getting money is my duty
And if the truth is really naked then Juicy Js a nudist
Your girlfriends my groupie if I speak to her she gonna lose it
Fuck nigga you mad? I don't give a fuck, sue me
A hundred deep we all strapped
Pistols all on our waistline
Real niggas don't talk about it we shoot it out in the daytime
In the streets you really not
Extended clip I won't miss a shot
Try me I'll put you in a pine box
My trigger finger got the chicken pox
I got money I got hoes getting head in my drop top rolls
All this chicken and all this syrup you think we at Roscoes
I'm smoking and I'm driving while I'm rolling up
You broke so I smoke enough for both of us

[Hook]
Niggas don't play with me, these niggas know better
These niggas know better, these niggas know
These bitches don't play with me, these bitches know better
These bitches know better, these bitches know
Niggas don't play with me, these niggas know better
These niggas know better, these niggas know
These bitches don't play with me, these bitches know better
These bitches know better, these bitches know

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Talking shit but they know better
Talking kush but I grow better
Talking money my dough better
All my niggas rep mafia
Talking borders we crossing those
Talking pounds we got lots of those
Million dollars that's independent
Look at us say those niggas getting it
Niggas don't play with me
They know I got a couple niggas that'll spray for me
They know that if it come down to it that I'll pay the cost
Before you say your ready for war be prepared to take a loss, Bitch I'm a boss
I be rolling up that good, nigga
I keep both hands clean
Might be my goons that's on the crime scene
Throwing their gang up when they approach
Don't even talk bank cause you know its bigger
Ain't in first class cause I'm the only nigga

[Hook]
Niggas don't play with me, these niggas know better
These niggas know better, these niggas know
These bitches don't play with me, these bitches know better
These bitches know better, these bitches know
Niggas don't play with me, these niggas know better
These niggas know better, these niggas know
These bitches don't play with me, these bitches know better
These bitches know better, these bitches know
