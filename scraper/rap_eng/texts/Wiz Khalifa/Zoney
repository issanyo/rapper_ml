[Intro]
Yeah it’s real shit
Let me roll this weed up and wrap this shit, you know
Too much purple for me

[Verse 1]
Uh, coming up I always thought I’d be the runner up
Gave my all but it felt like it wasn’t enough
I remember spending summers in the studio
My pops told me have fun be a kid for once
What he ain’t know, was for a kid a that I had big dreams
I take a small frame turn it into a big screen
Taking best friends turn them to a good team
I’m watching Scarface living all the good scenes
Burning dope thinking about the days when I was broke
Desperate niggas in my city don’t know how to cope
Young nigga said he starving he ain’t got a meal
Down to catch a body all about a dollar bill
My niggas is all I got so it’s more than trust
We ain’t even have a car we was on the bus
Public transportation now it’s hundred grands we makin'
Throw it in the safe I can’t hear what they say

[Hook]
I’m packing up my bags
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags
I gotta catch a plane
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane
I can’t be at home
Can’t be at home, can’t be at home
I gotta be away
Gotta be away, gotta be away

[Verse 2]
There's just way to many niggas i use to know back in the day
Now when i see them out
I just don't got shit to say to you niggas
When i see you in the club i make my way through you niggas
You must be mad i ain't wait on you
But no matter the circumstances i never get hate on you
Im just taking all my dream trying to make it facts
Putting on for my team trying to make it crack
Getting all sorts of green trying to make a stack
Lose yourself in my city and never make it back
Said he will but the chances are he will never change
Daddy sold dope but you would probably do the same thing
If I get $30K i would probably spend it on my wrist
Fuck these politics when these kids ain't have a pot to piss
Fuck the Promises, the shit I'm on is common sense
If you ain't talking them I'm gone

[Hook]
I’m packing up my bags
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags
I gotta catch a plane
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane
I can’t be at home
Can’t be at home, can’t be at home
I gotta be away
Gotta be away, gotta be away
