[Intro]
Yeah
Whaddup Taylor Gang
Starpower
It's star year
You know what it is

[Hook]
Ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my whole body
Ink my whole body

[Verse 1]
Got so many tats
You can't even count 'em up
In the shop every week
I can't seem to get enough
My aunt say
My skin too clean to mark it up
But I'mma
(Ink my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck)
I'm blowing purp
No shirt
Windows down
Screaming "Cash rules"
Showing off my tattoos
Hoes spazzing when they see me
Run up on me starstruck
Asking can they read me
Seen Matt and told him "Sleeve me"
Heard your man got a star tatted
Tryna be me
I make it look easy
People say I'm crazy
Body marked up like a wall in the 80's
Speakers scream loud like a car full of babies
Chain's so sick, think my charm came with rabies
All I heard these days is
(I think you're going overboard with it)
I ain't addicted, I'm committed
It's Wizzle man

[Hook]
Ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body
Ink, ink my whole body
Ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body
Ink, ink my whole body

[Verse 2]
I got stars over here
Little star over there
Stars everywhere
Cause nigga it's star year
The name star power
My jewelry is star bright
The tat on my face
Say I'm living the star life
And by the way
You know it's Taylor Gang
Soon as you see us
I'm inked up
From my feet up
I keep blunts flickin'
New tats itchin'
Black Chucks coppin'
New shit droppin' (Star power)
I'm the one they call young
Body marked up like a subway in Harlem
Niggas say that's hard
White people think it's awesome
Chest, neck tatted
Whole sleeve on my arm done
They say I look like Tyga man
I put some lime in the Swisher Sweet
And twist it all up
Can't wear a shirt, the bitches lift it all up
I'm tatting my body 'til I filled it all up

[Hook]
I'mma ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my, whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my, whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body
Ink, ink my whole body
Ink my whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my, whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my, whole body
I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body
Ink, ink my whole body
