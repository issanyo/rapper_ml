[Intro: Millz]
Uh, I'm sorry Wiz..
(laughs)
It's Pilot Posse Who Gon' Stop Me Ho
Not you, not at all

[Verse 1: Millz]
Uh, yo I be chiefin' like I'm Matt Cassel
Got greens that'll surely relax you
Bring this quarter back to your smoking spot & like Allen watch this purp sack you
Got that orange like the Mad Sax dude..
Think about it, fuck it, niggas do not think like I
All the greens I drop bills for stink like Nye
Experiments, experiment with a substance when you bump this
I got that slut music everyone fuck with
No Doug Funnie town I don't bluff bitch, I
Tell the truth, never load no shells don't shoot
Unless a nigga fuck with family then we mobbin' goons in suits
I keep a bitch on balls: softball shortstops
Stay chillin with my dog like Porkchop
I keep it real for the Pilot Posse, niggas know fame will never ever morph I..
Fly away, twitter locale: sky today
Tomorrow, never sorrow, yeah never feeling down I'm high okay
Get off my back just chill & let me lax
& mob out like Mega man & let my high reach it's max huh?
High Max? Mega Man? You'll get that, connection then..
Your mind will blow like middle of Oreos
These niggas can't touch my flow, who's body-guarding my lyrics
Who never is called Crystal, I underline them, no clear shit
Simplicity is a weakness that I am just not known for..
Duh, haha nigga I'm raw!
But I don't drink because of my depression?
But I smoke weed like an obsession!
Cause I once heard to be high over all is the definition of succession
But to define something is to find something
In a certain way that you see it
So when it comes down to it, that succession shit can't be defined by me cause I'll be it
Yeah I'll be it, no speaking, just direct me to where those trees is
Only fucking around with Mary, no treason, it's pleasing enough
(ooo-ooo) I'm on this Wizzle beat, so it's safe to say, it's PPOD, fool
(laughs)

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Millz]
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fucking with no other drug (no other drug) x5
