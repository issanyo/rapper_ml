[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
We here to slump lames
I only rock with real guys and big willies
You niggas chump change
So let the pump aim
Go ahead and block your chest
By trying to rock your vest, it'll do nothing
We let the metal clap, and make you pedal back
Wait your face'll break, and your head'll crack
This for my guys no choice but to peddle crack
Beef we'll settle that drama we'll level cats
And on the block known
But never spots blown
Go ahead and chop them rocks, get your block sewn
And if you hustle grams, get more weight like a muscle man
And wrap them grands in a rubber band
A slug spark in your muscle fam
And I ain't never met Martin... But I'm the hustle man
Got what you need and you wanting fam
My dudes is rude, eating the food straight out your stomach damn!

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
This for my live niggas
Hit the strip move them pies niggas
Drop a stack to get fly niggas
Roll the leaf and get high niggas
Hustle just to get by niggas
Yeah you my niggas
And for them street cats
When it's beef let the heat clap
Leave you leaking where your feets at
Hold something, tell you keep that
It's clearly our year and we're taking the streets back

[Verse 2: Ekko]
Ayo, I'm trying to leave these pricks froze
So keep your lips closed
Cuz I done had it up to here, I'm bout to explode
[?], you know how the kid roll
Get dough, sick flow, but I make it sound so simple
Don't get it twisted though cuz nigga I could switch a flow
I ain't got a dime so the shine is my principle
You never catch me slipping cuz my rhymes never listen yo
I'm like the definition that defines what's invincible
This for my peeps stressed, let's take a deep breath
Cuz ain't too many real niggas on the street left
So I'ma spit it til I'm lamping with my feet stretched
Laying on the beach rest next to a [?]
This for my homies gone
That knew only wrong
Got popped left behind a daughter of a lonely mom
Niggas been tripping a lotta shit been going on
That's why I keep it different I ain't on the shit that no one's on

[Hook: Ekko]
This for my real niggas
Take a rap and never squeal niggas
Quick to make it happen in the field niggas
Ill niggas
That be clapping just to kill niggas
We got the [?] that you can feel, niggas
This for my wild niggas
Always grilling up and down niggas
Never scared to kill a couple clown niggas
We don't fuck around niggas
We will pound niggas
Straight suffocate and drown niggas

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & (Ekko)]
(Your boys are back now)
So put a stack down
You bullshit, we spit what's in them crack files
And (pull clips to rip and tear your back out
Take over strips with fifths and cause a black out)
Lil nigga listen here, I'm from a city where
You talk shit, the fifth will make you disappear
(If not fifths, then fists will leave you sitting there
Wishing it was just another time in a different year)
And I ain't nearly reached my prime but I'm getting it
This is real talk, not just rhyming and spitting here
(Bitch niggas, I can smell their kind when they getting near
Ain't got no place with them long as I keep away from them)
And as long as I'm alive, yeah, I'll be erasing them
No words, just drive by like we racing 'em
Plotting on my death, while I smile in the face of 'em
So chill niggas, we real niggas replacing 'em

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Ekko]
