[Intro]
Everything Taylor, dumb fuck
I ain't gonna say it again nigga TGOD, huh
It ain't the size of the man, its the size of the motherfuckin plan
You doin?

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
My flow so disgusting, hold on
My flow so disgusting, nigga's talking shit
Topic of discussion, at the boy that's on top
But they wish I wasn't, then they see me ballin in the two times,three feet fallin
Kiss they cousin, ewww

But the real niggas love it, and they keep that hammer
You lil niggas can't touch this
And I'm too legit to quit, Uh
Too much grip to trip, the weed I'm smoking on be like six a zip
The car I'm driving cause me a tick
To whip all these diamonds and be on me being ridiculous
And it's all this grinding got me on the millions list
It's all this time and I be in the trillions
You're on your iphone taking pictures
I'm on the island swimming with the fishes
I'll take your money, you can keep your bitches
Fake friends, I have those
If my niggas up in your vip
Feel that thing with some bad hoes
Some bombay and some champagne
And some ashtrays for them airplanes
I'm throwing up my damn game
Cause it's taylor gang over erythang

[Outro]
Ah, taylor ho, taylor, taylor ho, taylor
Taylor ho, taylor, taylor ho, taylor
