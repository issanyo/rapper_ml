[Chorus: Rome]
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I can’t come down
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I won’t come down
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I can’t come down
Can you feel it?
No I won’t come down

[Verse 1: Rome]
I hold my breath
Because I love the taste
And I stay happy
While the rest of the world just lays to waste, And it goes
Nobody and nothing can help me with all my troubles
Except for my only one light escape
Traveling around the world finding my place

[Chorus: Rome]
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I can’t come down
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I won’t come down
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I can’t come down
Can you feel it?
No I won’t come down

[verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Get high flying straight
And I won't come down
Get high flying straight
Oh oh oh
I'm rolling up a G6
Hit it once you won't believe this
You say your mind is racing
Let me try to help you pace it
See I be floating around space ships
All up in there where them planes is
Mixing my green with my breakfast
Waking, baking
I'ma roll my weed up everyday
Smoke everyday
Party everyday
Try'na reach the clouds
Are you on your way?
I'm rolling up good you rolling up trash
I'm burning them slow you burning them fast
You smoking on this I'm smoking on that
Ain't counting them grams just go in the bag
You rolling a blunt I'm rolling a zag
We grinding it up and mixing with hash and that's

[Chorus: Rome]
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I can’t come down
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I won’t come down
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I can’t come down
Can you feel it?
No I won’t come down

[Bridge: Rome]
And I push away, because I don’t like the way
You cut out and punctured and shoved it in my face
Nobody and nothing can stop our subsonic construction
Because we’re coming out to lay the waste
Traveling around the world serving the taste

[Chorus: Rome]
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I can’t come down
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I won’t come down
Can you feel it?
I’ve got my head in the clouds and I can’t come down
Can you feel it?
No I won’t come down

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
