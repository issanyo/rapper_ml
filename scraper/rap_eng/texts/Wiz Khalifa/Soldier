[Verse 1]
I would never sell myself short, I'm too cocky
Niggas got a problem with that, then you stop me
I think dudes is mad cuz you not me
So you get a pen and a pad and you copy
But at the same time
Man you could never get away with the same rhymes
So you could take mines
You fellas can't shine
I take time great lines from a great mind, was under wraps
But now youngins back, Pittsburgh's front and back
Hip hop's Maurice Green the way I'm running tracks
Man who could fuck with that, fam nobody
Got damn so hot, he got fans all on him oc
I said it before, I'll say it again
I'm playing to win, I punch lines grazing the chin
And then, the rhyme ends with a knockout blow
So you could call this a knockout flow
Come fuck with me

[Hook: Gene Stovall]
I'm a soldier
Cruising on the left like I told ya
Camouflage faces look colder
Make the wrong move and I'll fold up, whoa
I'm a soldier
Wiz been the best brush your shoulders
Hustling now so when I'm older
All my children will grin free from sin
And the poison that makes us the men
I'm a soldier

[Verse 2]
By all means necessary I protect the family
And lyrically, test to me you'll be next to bury
My brainstorms alone enough to force your worry
Yours is just a flurry
Fame short as February
You ain't ill, you just acting sick
This ain't no motherfucking action flick
Cuz if you actually hit
There's no more time given to tick
You like movies I'll give you a clip
And that's it nigga
Lights out game over
I'm sick and all about bank roll and large amounts can't hold him
Got the rap game sewn up
And anybody acting like they got fame
Pop and watch they whole frame fold up
Man I done got far
Besides the fact that I got bars
An attitude like a rock star
And if you got war keep it to your lonesome
And I ain't never claimed to be a killer but I own some

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I came back around
And anyone who couldn't stand me I sat em down
Go head and ask around
A skinny nigga, 6'3" with a massive sound
Fiending to back em down
See what will happen now
I'm only one man, but I came to change things
Still tryna maintain, new player same game
I'm like Leatherface, working with that chain thing
I don't rock bells, I ain't L son my name rings
I'm a soldier, stand tall screw face
I thought I told ya, fatigues on and boots laced
My crews breaking large sinning and lord willing
My talents will reach all women and God's children
You ain't hot, you should level yourself
Lick a shot, put an end to your health
But I ain't doing that
I rather murder all these heads on the shelf
Man I'm hotter than the devil himself
And that's real nigga

[Hook]
