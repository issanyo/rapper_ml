I'm ridin' in a Caddy
Stuntin' like my daddy
Rollin up my girlfriend her first name Mary
Last name Jane
Look at these chains
Afro, Nappy Boy call me T-Pain
Bitches hit my phone but see I'm probably on the plane
And my eyes low
Like I'm Liu Kang
Niggas want that flame so I supply it and it's perfect
Hear 'em hatin' some new sucka niggas try it but it's worthless
I'm Barry White deep
You guys are on the surface
Some niggas want the green
But I be where the purp is
Wit ya main bitch she forgotten where her skirt is
Heard my album drop and now you kinda gettin' nervous
See I be goin' hard
Cause this is what I do
I roll another one and tell that bitch to get a clue
It's hard for me to name all a the places I done flew
I did it all by reppin' Taylor Gang and stayin' true
Ya dig?
