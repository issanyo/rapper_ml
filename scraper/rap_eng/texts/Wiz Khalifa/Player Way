[Intro]
It was twenty bad hoes in my
It was twenty bad hoes in my

[Verse 1]
It was plenty bad hoes in my hotel suite, yeah
Plus my whole clique so that's like two bitches a piece
They ain’t tripping on no niggas we ain't trippin' on police no
Call up room service from that five star corner bistro yeah
Sometimes it’s hoodies but I love to rock a pea coat
Gio Armani mami don't forget that deep throat uh
Smelling like Carti no I ain't no little mijo
They know about him from the boroughs out to Pico
Yeah so we gon' have some fun and that's for sho
Last time I checked I cashed a check I'm on a roll
Don't trip I'll flip some shit I got more bread to blow
The player way we water man and watch it grow

[Chorus]
Don’t care what they say
I do things the player way
All day every day, I do things the player way
Everywhere I go, I do things the player way
You already know, I do things the player way
We gon’ have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon’ have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon’ have some fun, we gon' have a good time

[Verse 2]
Real Don Dada
Get a bitch bombard her
Got a blonde bomb shell
With a bomb ass body
Brunette Betty, booty meat heavy
Straight to the telly, tell her bathe in the Henny
Bitch is so saditty ‘cause her pussy and her titties
‘Til I'm in her city in a Chevy sittin' pretty
To the nitty gritty, get it poppin', bust a quickie
Then I ditch her, get to dippin' to a party, act illicit
Little D R E, G funk, Sade
Taught me all the game
To pull a big butt shorty
Neighbors know my name
Other People's Money
Niggas living mundane
Human form of Mondays
Reason for the complaints
Me and all my con men
Moola stacking knots francs
Doing shit one way
Moola stacking knots francs
Me and all my con men
Doing shit one way
Look me in my eye
You can tell me hi
Look me in my eye
You can tell I'm high
Look me in my eye
You can say I'm fly
Put one in the sky
And then catch a vibe

[Chorus]
Don't care what they say
I do things the player way
All day every day, I do things the player way
Everywhere I go, I do things the player way
You already know, I do things the player way
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time

[Verse 3]
We gon' have a good one
See me at the party and I might be off a good one
Yeah that's me I'm the lit one
And prob'ly breakin' bands, even with my new one
Then I saw you and your new man
Your new man is my step son
I know Sally from the valley
She done stepped it up
Used to jerk me in the alley now she suck me in Denalis
And I did that shit the player way
You a hater though
Taylor Gang one way niggas gotta let ‘em know
When you do this shit for real for real it's really easy pickings
Funk flexing on these bitches and I got a full extension
And it's been this way for years can a nigga get a pension
And it's been this way for years can a nigga get a mention

[Chorus]
Don't care what they say
I do things the player way
All day every day, I do things the player way
Everywhere I go, I do things the player way
You already know, I do things the player way
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time
We gon' have some fun, we gon' have a good time
