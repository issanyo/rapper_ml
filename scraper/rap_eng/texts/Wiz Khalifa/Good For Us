[Intro]
I love rapping in New York
KK and dirty lemonade
And I just checked the charts too
I'm still #1 (hahaha)

[Verse]
Uh
Wake up wake up
Bake up bake up
Money comin'
She lookin' good
With no make up
Pull up pull up
Full of that Kush
I wish you would
My neck of the woods
Is misunderstood
No pain no gain
I play the game
Got cars got fame
Got on these chains
I stayed the same
When she come over I need more brain
And we get stoned and we gon' ball a high scorin' game
Them niggas cool, they ain't right tho
I have you somewhere by the pool gettin' right
Leavin' school takin' flights
Sayin' you would, would you might tho
Stop fuckin' with the nigga that you with
It's Taylor Gang life
You be pourin' out champagne, spillin' it up
Puttin' money in the safe, would be fillin' it up
Got the number one record and I'm still in the cut
It's the Gang baby, ain't nobody realer
Roll the next one bigger

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing, oh baby
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing, oh baby

[Wiz talking]
Let's light a joint
Drink some [mushroom tea?]
Have a conversation
I wanna take you around the world
I wanna show you some things
I wanna get away from all that shit
Just leave it all
If you smoke a little bit of weed
I'll some a little bit with you

[Outro]
Yeah
Taylor Gang
We ain't going no where
We just gettin' higher
Tryin' to do things
