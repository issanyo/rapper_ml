[Hook: Mally Mall]
Hundred racks, all hundreds
Anything less, small money
Money so long, got a tag on it
Anything I want, drop bands on it
Bands on it, bands on it
Bands on it, drop bands on it
Bands on it, bands on it
Bands on it

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I’m stickin to the plan
Got a bottle in my hand
I wrote this off a dab
So drunk I need a cab
And I came in a Porsche
Getting brain like a dork
Good weed in my lungs
The way I hit it got her sprung
Fuck around and go broke in the club
They ain’t nothing like us
What you heard that's raw not a blunt
Bitch roll some up
If I ain’t getting high then I'm probably workin'
Spit the shit that got Miley Cyrus twerkin'
I go Hammer with the grammer
To spend this many racks you need stamina

[Hook]
Hundred racks, all hundreds
Anything less, small money
Money so long, got a tag on it
Anything I want, drop bands on it
Bands on it, bands on it
Bands on it, drop bands on it
Bands on it, bands on it
Bands on it

[Verse 2: Tyga]
New chain hundred grand on it
Bitch ass so fat just land on it
Just bought a drop top, get a tan on it
All this bitches on my dick, put your hands on it
Hot pussy, put a fan on it
I go old LA, just ram on it
Bands on it
Clap clap, mothfuckin' back hand on it, Peter Picker pipe em
T-Raww knife em, end them life up
Fuck your life up, turn up in a nightclub
Nice one, pop one in this bitch
Drum and bass molly on her tongue

[Hook]
Hundred racks, all hundreds
Anything less, small money
Money so long, got a tag on it
Anything I want, drop bands on it
Bands on it, bands on it
Bands on it, drop bands on it
Bands on it, bands on it
Bands on it

[Verse 3: Short Dawg aka fR€$H]
Fresh pull up in that new Royce 4 door, federally taking photos
Got the plug from the cholos, buy 2, he front me 4 more
I'm a fly boy on my high horse like Polo
Need a fly girl with fat ass like J. Lo
Hey ho, I stay on my grizzly no mayo
Got the killas on the payroll like kids spinning Playdoh
Collar pop like the fonz
My top go back like LeBron
Your girls head Is the bomb, she gave my dick a massage
Nigga can't get it unless it’s six digits
And your pockets shorter then 6 midgets
All this ice on my gold keep my neck drippin
If it get Iggy try to stick me with this murder business
This money got me lookin handsome
Roll the weed so I can smoke
50 models in my section
100 bottles of that Rose, everything on me

[Hook]
Hundred racks, all hundreds
Anything less, small money
Money so long, got a tag on it
Anything I want, drop bands on it
Bands on it, bands on it
Bands on it, drop bands on it
Bands on it, bands on it
Bands on it
