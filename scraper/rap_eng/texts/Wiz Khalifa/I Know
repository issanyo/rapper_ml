Dont you ever leave!
Dont you ever go away!
I love you, I love you!
Yea, Im begging you, dont you leave
Yea, Im begging you, dont you go!
Youve got my heart, youve got my heart!
I know I f-cked off, I know I f-cked off!
I know I f-cked off!
Im sorry baby!
Baby I need you, baby I need you, yeah!
I need you baby!
But now youre going
And Im forced to deal with your absence
All alone in this madness
All alone on my mattress
Dont know how the hell this happened!
You know loving me was a hazard
Outcome of my actions
I wish we could go back
Go back a couple of chapters
Back when there was laughter
Back when we first met
Before we came such a disaster
Before your heart got sharper
Before I forgot how much you meant it
Crazy we dont realize what we have until after
We no longer have it!
Dont you ever leave!
Dont you ever go away!
I love you, I love you!
Yea, Im begging you, dont you leave
Yea, Im begging you, dont you go!
Youve got my heart, youve got my heart!
You say youre out the door
Youre out the door
Youre sick and tired can't take no more
Can't take no more!
You know the game
And try to help it time and time before
Told me you dont have time to waste it
And hey, youve got to go, youve got to go!
Can help on thinking at you when Im alone
When Im alone!
Try in vain, I call your cell, you dont pick up your phone
Guess that you really mean you meant just what you said
You said just what you meant
Getting all this bread but it dont mean shit
Fuck the dough I get, plus the dough I spend, yeah!
Dont you ever leave!
Dont you ever go away!
I love you, I love you!
Yea, Im begging you, dont you leave
Yea, Im begging you, dont you go!
Youve got my heart, youve got my heart!
Hey superstar
Theres a raincloud above my heart
And its only because of you
I knew it from the very start
Running out of complaints
No, no! my bodies sedate
Looking at my heart Ill give it away babe
And Ima honor and cherish our blazer
Baby
Dont you ever leave!
Dont you ever go away!
I love you, I love you!
Yea, Im begging you, dont you leave
Yea, Im begging you, dont you go!
Youve got my heart, youve got my heart!
I know I f-cked off, I know I f-cked off!
I know I f-cked off!
Im sorry baby!
Baby I need you, baby I need you, yeah!
I need you baby!
Aww no, no you do
Aww no, no you do
Yeah
I love you!
