[Intro]
Ya'll ready know
When I walk the fuck back
You can't act like
That ain't the flyest thing you've ever seen in your whole entire motherfucking sorry ass life

[Hook]
Can't say I'm not the freshest nigga that you've ever seen
I keep a couple grand - nothin less in my jeans
That's prolly why your bitch keep ringin' phone
And when I pull up she can't leave me alone
Lil homie I grind - No sleep
I'm good in the hood errybody know me
I got my trunk on blast
Hit me when I roll through
Stunt'n like a young nigga supposed to

[Verse 1]
Stunt'n like I'm supposed to
Riding with my hat cocked
Smokin' something good - 3 blunts and I'm smacked out
City on smash, game on padlock
26 inch rims, chrome on a matchbox
6 bad hoes man I can't choose 1
3 cell phones I just can't use 1
You see how often I spit
You just off bread hun
This the shit they can’t do young
Talk fly if you look ‘em in the air
Too young, you wonder were I got these Gucci parachute from
A lot of ya’ll mad
To me it’s just funny
I see why ya’ll hatin man the hoes just love me
And you know I’m gettin’ shhh
Fuck it I ain’t gotta say it
The tab taken care of nigga I ain’t gotta pay it
Yea, I’m all day with it, year round
I bet if you was here now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Got a fat knot, blunt rolled up
Me I ride clean
Neck froze up
Bad bitch on the side
My niggas all rich
Foreign whips what they drive
Yea, I smell like Gucci and big money too
See them guys with me? they gettin’ money too
Ride 22′s and got heat so
If a nigga try me you a big prob you runnin’ into
I smoke a lot need blunt or 2
At a time whole pounds I be runnin’ through
Yea, I got a dime bitch coming through
Cause I pimp like I’m supoosed to
Wonder how I get it like this, I could show you
Butter soft leather in the whip when I roll through
This year I’m a get shit cleared
Take a look at this kid here

[Hook]
