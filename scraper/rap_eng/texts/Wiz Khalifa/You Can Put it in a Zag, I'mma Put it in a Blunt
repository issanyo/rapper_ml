[Hook](2x)
You can put it in a zag, I'mma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back, I'mma sit in the front
No stunt, no pump
It really don't matter cause I got what they want

Snoop Dogg:
They say all day we play in blow
This is the only thing we know
I blow kush again on the push again
With a bad little cute little Mexican

Wiz Khalifa:
Zig zag how I roll mine
You can tell I be a G how I hold mine
I ain't in a load of shit I'mma own mine
Bitch fuck with me stumble on a gold mine

Snoop Dogg:
Break bread
Fake dead
Punk bitch this is real life
Executive branch what it feel like?
Catch me if you can I'm your local kush man
Sitting in the stands with a hundred grand in my pants

Wiz Khalifa:
And I blow so much smoke
Pure OG hit it once might choke
See I'mma go kick it with a bitch I could poke
And you could ride to high school take a toke

[Hook](2x)

Wiz Khalifa:
No stems no seeds
Mac gave me all the class that a nigga need
Just taught my old bitch how to roll weed
And a nigga riding with me getting high with me

Snoop Dogg:
Squares are revving to my young nigga Devin
Got the hanging out with Mac now we 24/7
On the go smoking dro
Deep on the Westside
Banging where its hood at
Yep you gotta love that

Wiz Khalifa:
Yep I love that
Niggas used to offer but I wouldn't
Now I'm all asking where the bud at
Making it happen me and Mac just got two bitches cracking and they say they trying to smoke weed all night and down for getting tatted

Snoop Dogg:
Spatted up and tatted up
Suit it up and boot it up
Pioneers baby
Ain't nothing that you could do to us
N. Hale
That's the high school
Dev and Mac
You we act like a damn fool
Ya dig?
You know what?
It may sound crazy but uh
Yeah... Dev and Mac
High school...

It may sound crazy but uh (3x)
