[Intro: THEMXXNLIGHT]
(Call me, reach me)

[Pre-Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Call me, reach me
Only when you wanna see me
Oh, then we go dancin'
I can feel us romancin'
Girl, why you actin'
Goddamn, you attractin'
All the attention
You make a good impression

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
(I see the moon in your eyes)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I hear you ain't callin'
I need you in the mornin'
I feel you when you walk in
Conversation, I'ma spark it
No time, I ain't gon waste it
My time, I'm gonna take it
Slow it down, we love makin'
Speed it up, say that's your favorite
Say something good to me
Say something good to me
Say something good to me
Say something good to me
I got just what you need
We gon drink and roll the weed
Ain't gon fall in love with me
That's just how it's supposed to be

[Pre-Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Call me, reach me
Only when you wanna see me
Oh, then we go dancin'
I can feel us romancin'
Girl, why you actin'
Goddamn, you attractin'
All the attention
You make a good impression

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
(I see the moon in your eyes)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
(Uh) Ooh, wonder where you went to
I know what we went through, 'cause at first, we were cool
Now you up in my room, doin' what grown people do
You want me me on you, hit me when we're through
And say something good to me
Say something good to me
Say something good to me
Say something good to me
Hit it so good, you go to sleep
Didn't know you was a freak
Got me fuckin' up my sheets
Before I know, you gone away

[Pre-Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Call me, reach me
Only when you wanna see me
Oh, then we go dancin'
I can feel us romancin'
Girl, why you actin'
Goddamn, you attractin'
All the attention
You make a good impression

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
(I see the moon in your eyes)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)
All of a sudden (you go out of sight)

[Outro: Unidentified Voice & THEMXXNLIGHT]
Yeah
But she like, real cool
You don't wanna be bothered
She like, I'ma fuck her
Just don't lie to him
Call me, reach me
Call me, reach me
