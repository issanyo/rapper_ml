[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
If you at home letting her go out alone
Then I'mma take yo bitch
And if she keep jocking me
Stopping me every time she hear my song
Then I'mma take yo bitch
Said she getting tired of fighting
And running around with the same nigga
And plus, she know I ain't no lame nigga
And I ain't pressin her just to see if my numbers in her phone
But I'mma take yo bitch

You hatin from afar, she tryna get closer
Meet me at the bar and tryna be sober, no sir
So you come and kick it with my clique
And you nigga somewhere heated screamin thats my bitch

Everyone know you the man
With my hollywood hoes somewhere by the sand
Fuckin shit up with yo nigga tryna fit me in your plan
Tell him your a fan
Even though you were at my crib
Used to like my music now he sayin "fuck young wiz"
Thats how I live, and I won't change for the world

Says she been searching around for some change in the world

[Verse 2: Neako]
Jerz, Wizzle, Neako
Tell you a story
I see you stressing my nigga
Now tell me what is going on?
Somebody took your bitch?
I guess you wanna grab the ratchet
Go hit his hood
And do him wrong
All over your chick
Look at Lil Reak baby bro nope
He ain't comin' home
Because the nigga straight flipped
A nigga hit his bitch
Reak tripped
Then he hit him in his dome
He got a life sentence
You might wanna think about what you're doin'
Before you do it wrong
When you shoot don't miss
Cause if you do niggas'll catch you
And baby bro they wrong
If they put you in the ditch
I'mma tell you like this
Life is priceless
Because you took a shot don't mean it gon' miss
You never knew another nigga slid your wife the dick
And now you sitting back with a chick
Like this
Like this, ay
