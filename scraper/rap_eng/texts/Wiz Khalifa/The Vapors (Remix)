[Verse 1]
You been on my mind
I been tryna let it go
I been tryna find
Somethin' as incredible
As you and I
But that's a never
No feeling can compare to you
You just gotta let me know

[Hook]
Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again?
(x2)

(Take me over...
I'm under your control)

[Verse 2]
You stay on the grind
I'm always available
Rollin' in my ride
So I gotta take it slow
You got me so high
Up, up and away we go
Racing to the sky
I'm feeling unfadable
Cause the vapors
Could save us
And take us
And make us believe
That we are free
We can be free
So can I please

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Been on this road so long, don't even know where we goin'
Let's roll some joints, it doesn't matter how many we smoke
So many cars, need help decidin' which one I'mma drive
So many diamonds on my wrist, make my watch look alive
I ain't just talkin' all this shit, I'm really workin'
No days off, goin' hard, never takin' a break
And it pays off, more in charge, rollin' up on the job
Havin' fun with my life, you niggas hella borin'
So many flights it's like I'm teleportin', don't need a home
Bring the gin, bring the strong, bring the weed, bring the bong
Don't come alone, bring all your friends, I'll bring the smoke
How it feel when it's goin' in? Let me know

[Hook]
