[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Time to time
I tell 'em I don't love 'em I just fuck 'em
Then I move on to another one, pass 'em to my brother
Get that pussy under cover, got her ass from her mother
Got my weed straight from Berner, you a nerd so you cuff her
I could hardly trust these bitches I learn they no sucker
On that gas like a trucker, smack the ass when I fuck her
I get plenty love, it's all of the above
I'm on Gin and drugs, give me some
Then it's straight to the club, pockets fillin’ up
Niggas love trynna hate on us, they ain't real enough
Always fill the building up, young and I'm rich as fuck
Text your bitch, I ain't trynna "Netflix & Chill" with her
I'mma roll a joint, give her the best dick she ever had
She don't fuck then I'mma get her bestfriend instead of her
My cash is irregular, I bag bitches everywhere
Got some clothes still got on the tags that I don't never wear
You in last smokin', doin' dabs, I run through the cash


[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They tryna argue nah they lay with all this foreign
You don't believe a word, you hear us all the same
You been here time to time, you heard it all before
After I fuck you once I'll never call again

[Verse 2: Problem]
These bitches be like
Dick hoppin', clique hoppin' for better positions
Pillow talking to any nigga payin' attention
They on a mission tryna fog up a players vision
Fuck then I'm finished, before you leave bitch go clean that kitchen
I ain't gon lie oh yeah the Chacho was a victim once
Before that happened again you will catch me smokin' blunts
And all I do is papers, all I'm bout is paper
Love you for the night, tomorrow we are strangers
You ain't gotta call cause I ain’t
Textin' "Can we kick it?" no reply
You text again like I thought we had a connection
I text back "Bitch I ain't that type of guy"
Gang over everything
Taylor,  Diamond Lane we the reconnected
Bombay and bomb dick bitch is better then expected
Bossed up, fuckin' top so you better not disrespect it
Compton to the fuckin' burbs we connected
Hit the exit


[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They tryna argue nah they lay with all this foreign
You don't believe a word, you hear us all the same
You been here time to time, you heard it all before
After I fuck you once I'll never call again
