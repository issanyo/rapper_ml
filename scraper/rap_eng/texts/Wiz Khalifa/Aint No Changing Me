[Verse 1: Compton Menace]
Now look I know they love it cause I bring in better days
Probably thinking ‘bout paper I’m feeling a certain way
Inflicted to roll the trap of the truck on a certain day
My haters I know they love me just need me to lead their way
Just duckin them alphabets, but yeah play with the games
Hopped in bought that 6, holding money like a bouquet
But hey, no hope my real niggas gotta get it
Million dollar homes and next week we’ll be in it
Talking about the way we fuck them purps
Kick em up by the fortunes and then we get to the new
Reppin this money hard all the way from the first
All my niggas is real to the game and staying true
But look, niggas been the same since the same box
Shared the same shoes even shared the same Glocks
Saving greens, even played for the same team
But now I’m saving dreams, reality but I’m still me

[Hook]
Ain't no changing me
Still fuck with the same niggas I grew up with
Still thug with the same niggas that I thug with
All my day ones, that's who I fuck with
Ain't no changing me
Still fuck with the same niggas I grew up with
Still thug with the same niggas that I thug with
All my day ones, that's who I fuck with

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Throwing up the hood, rolling up that good
Never slipping even though I thought they wish I would
Got a couple homies and all of them different poppin'
Held the bottles in the club, but leave all of them spending comfortably
For rolling up that game, smoking till I faint
Smiling at you haters while I'm laughing to the bank
And the shit I got on you can't afford this
Let's get it clear, every year I make the Forbes list
It don't make dollars, don't appear is gonna make more sense
Jump in my cars it's like "YEEAAARRRHHHH" when I'm going in it
In this game I was born in it
Seem way too much shit to let these lame niggas go and win it
So I came up had to switch the game up
Told you when I was young, nigga hustle get the change up
Now everywhere I go they throw my gang up
Everybody blog everybody Taylor'd
