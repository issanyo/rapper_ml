See, we ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, damn thing
Hear you talking it, but you not about a damn thing, damn thing
So what you doing about it? Not a damn thing, damn thing
Keep it moving, I'm on over doing my damn thing
Keep it moving

[Verse 1]
You see I'm here now - that's right, you not the man
They say I spit coke, supply the block with grams
And I ain't liftwaiting, I'm taking lots of grands
Cuz I ain't got patience, I'm not a doctor, fam
My niggas get it crunk, chump rep the side you from
Smokin' somethin nigga, light ya blunt
Ain't got ya gun, you better find you one (why?)
Cuz this is Pistolvania - where them apes crawl
Bunch of shorties on the the corner, pocket full of 8balls
And you never gonna see one of my niggas sleep
Until they cake long
Aye what you mean, man? Something like the Great Wall
As far as rap go, yeah, its in the bag
Of course the haters wanna do me bad
Prolly mad because of the shit that I have
I never let them slow me down, dawg, I'm living fast
So as long as the chick want to get with the young'n
That's all about making this cash
I'm still a young'n, but niggas respect the flow
And don't check me, ya better check ya ho

[Verse 2]
I'm in the studio, making classic heat
You niggas mad at me, this cash I have to see
And you chumps can amount out for the ones
And I'm bout done with you punks
And you clowns wanting to come for the crown
I hear alot of talk, I gotta let them know
I put the bussiness on a nigga, really think he feeling nutty
When he come and try to test the flow (woah)
Cause I'm not for the games, opt you will not do a thing
See I was taught you gotta walk if you're talkin the same
And its 4-1-2 til I fall to the grave
They'on know what to do with the boy to this day
Cause I'm always pimpin'
If I put my voice on track, the whole world gon' listen
Some niggas might can hate, but you can say
I get away with murder like O.J. Simpson
I'm into all day grinding
Don't nothing come easy, I'm putting the time in
The young'n keep rhyming
So that one day I can sit back and reclining
I see you stressed out, man we do this shit for fun
Call me the best out (why)
Khalifa get it done (yes)
