[Wiz Khalifa] Verse 1
Yeah
High School Man
Taylor Gang
Young Khalifa
I'll show you how to do this shit
Uhh, (It Could Be Easy)
But you probably won't believe me
That's why I'm smokin, ridin, listenin
To "Doggy Style" on CD
They saw me on TV
Now they gon try they hardest to be me
Say she know just who I am
And plus my team is undefeated
I'm the man in my city
If you want I got the key
I could put you on the game
Or on the ocean by the beach
Everything you see I own
I don't got a lease
If your bitch outta control
Better put that ho on a leash, (Ummm)
If you listenin to what I'm tryna tell ya
Every dime pays, but they catchin messin with that high grade
They gon try and fail ya
Call up mom's tell her "You in the hallway, Plus your clothes smell kinda familiar"
I ain't trippin
I'm twistin up another one
Gotta couple problems with my bitches Dogg
Cuz Pimpin Ain't (EASY)
I'm Rolling up tree
Staying low from police
And don't ask where I've been
Dogg I'm going where the cheese be
Haters talk, When I leave
They just front, when they see
What they want, say they dont
But they need me...
I'm like a fucking Game Genie
Young Nigga, But I make it look EASY!!!

It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy

[Snoop Dogg] Verse 2
Flying on a plane, plane
Givin to the same thang
Never the same game
She ask me if I gang bang
If Peter Piper Pick em
Then Snoopy Doopy Pimp Em
The track is where I kick it
Now baby suck a dick or
Until you start to Hick Up
Now look here Breezy
It's real Hard, But you could make it Easy
I am pleasurable, now baby please me
And once I get up in it, I'll make you need me
Like I love weed leaf, baby starvin
Now she feed me, believe me, you complete me
Protect the spot, and when I'm in school
Lay Low, Be Cool, connect the dot.,
I do it vagrantly, truent agencies on my wing tips
I ditched English for Old English 40 oz low
With some Buddha Thai
Mixed it with some kush smoke
For the ET High, So I'mma phone home
Baby want some Knick Knack Paddy Whack
Give Her Doggy Bone
We Home alone, Now she sucking on my bone
Michauley Pfipher
Nascar Driver
Rolling wit real East Sider
It Could Be Easy....
It could be easy
Make the smallest little things seem oh so hard
It could be easy
Tell me would you really be who you are
Who you are
And it's been done before, I think you should know
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
