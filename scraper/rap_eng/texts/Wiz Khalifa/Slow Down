[Verse 1: Berner]
I be hella loaded when I grab the wheel
I ain't sippin' on lean 'less I crack the seal
2 dirty cups and a half a pill
Smoke 2 joints, count a half a mil
Got me askin' lil mama if the ass is real
I be deep in her pussy, bet her man can tell
And I ain't trippin' off him, I'm tryna' have fun
Bought more land, put plants in the sun
Brand new J's on my feet and all
I pray the drugs numb the pain of the shit we saw
And if I go young, it's prolly my fault
As least I got 2 or 3 mil in the wall
Thought small but we coulda went big
Play around with the Bern, put a hole in your wig
Got a bag full of cash and a whole load of flip
I'm talkin' in code on my phone as it click

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
No love, no it ain't no love
Ain't down with the gang, no, then it ain't no love
No love, no it ain't no love
Ain't down with the gang, no, then it ain't no love

[Verse 2: Berner]
I be hella loaded when I try to sleep
Thinkin' 'bout my mom, make me wipe my cheek
The drought came around, it's been dry for weeks
And if you need work, then the price ain't cheap
I been gettin' down, '96 was great
And I was only 13 on a plane with grapes
All in Arizona tryna get my cash
Mom caught me slippin', had to whoop my ass
Lil young motherfucker with lots of doe
I was only 19 in the club on blow
When we hit the nightclub, we don't tuck our gold
21, hot head, better cuff your hoe
32, 20Ms on my way to a B
Why we get hood rich and still playin' the street
It's the life we chose and I can't let go
Cookie, smell-proof bag with the fresh cut smoke

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
No love, no it ain't no love
Ain't down with the gang, no, then it ain't no love
No love, no it ain't no love
Ain't down with the gang, no, then it ain't no love

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I be high as fuck on a pound of weed
Rollin' KK, no it ain't no seeds
Do anythin' to see my gang succeed
Damn, my son 3 years old, he been changin' me
New rides so it's plain to see
I be gettin' paid, nigga, faithfully
If niggas go broke, they put the blame on me
That's why I grind everyday and try to stay low key
Cleaned up, ain't a stain on me
Ridin' in my ride, bumping lean on me
Bern here so it's all B on me
And I'm gang gang so the police on me
Ain't nothin' that we ain't gon' do
Shame on me, nigga shame on you
Been around the world, you could go there too
And if you got girlfriends, you can bring 'em through
I'm like damn

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
No love, no it ain't no love
Ain't down with the gang, no, then it ain't no love
No love, no it ain't no love
Ain't down with the gang, no, then it ain't no love
