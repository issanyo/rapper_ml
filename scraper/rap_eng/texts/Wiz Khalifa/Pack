[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, you know it ain't nothin but a buncha gang gang goin on
Keep that thang
Packs
Uhh

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, oh
The pack can’t smoke and run
Oh, oh...oh, oh
Your hoes ain't knockin' [?]
Oh, oh...oh, oh
Your money ain’t stackin' right
Oh, oh...oh, oh
It's why your bitch ain't comin' back tonight
Oh, oh...oh, oh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Break it down, roll it up
She a freak so she know what's up
Hit up [?], all my diamonds cold as fuck
Yeah, know I'm famous so she star struck
Run a play in the clutch
It ain't love, it’s just lust
Gettin’ money is a must
It be really hard to trust 'em
I just take my time, no, I ain’t the type to rush
You hop up in my ride, you know everything is custom
Let you roll a plane, rep my gang, it's no discussion

[Break: Wiz Khalifa]
I been thuggin', I can get'chu plugged in
I been takin’ K-K everywhere I been
Two cell phones, when I land, I'm spendin' Yen
The pack ain't right, hit up Berner, that's my man
All we do is win

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, oh
The pack can't smoke and run
Oh, oh...oh, oh
Your hoes ain't knockin' [?]
Oh, oh...oh, oh
Your money ain't stackin' right
Oh, oh...oh, oh
It's why your bitch ain't comin' back tonight
Oh, oh...oh, oh

[Verse 2: Berner]
Half awake, I'm sleepwalkin'
The jewelry store, yeah, I'm tryna see some options
It be hard to sleep at night knowin' that they watchin'
Take 'em on a highspeed chase, yeah, I lost 'em
The pack ain't smokin', I don't like 'em, then I toss 'em
Got a pretty white bitch waitin' up in Austin
Love to hit the road, groupie bitches used to dog 'em
Now I got 'em waitin' on the pack, catchin' boxes
Tell me how you livin'
If I lose, then I'm right back rollin' up the pack
Yeah, Bern, all white ash, floor flexin', veg bloom
Look at how that bitch stack
Almost got four pounds of light, yeah, that's quick cash
Why we all livin' fast?

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, oh
The pack can't smoke and run
Oh, oh...oh, oh
Your hoes ain't knockin' [?]
Oh, oh...oh, oh
Your money ain't stackin' right
Oh, oh...oh, oh
It's why your bitch ain't comin' back tonight
Oh, oh...oh, oh
