[Intro: M.I Abaga]
Yo yung6ix I swear my nigga when I be out here in ATL sometimes, I got this nigga called JC
He be taking me to stores where they ain't used to seeing niggas
We walking, they like, nigga you know you shouldn’t be here
Hehe, And we like Yeah, but we here. So serve a nigga. ..

[Verse1: MI Abaga]
Yo we never tired of balling
We incredible, legendary, Competition
Dead and Buried
Making money, Primary Goal, Schooling rappers
Secondary
I let the single drop sort of like I'm
Getting married
I'm laying low in the cut, your buzz imaginary
On to the next sport
On to the next store
I make the kind of hip hop Africa should export
I'm never backing down, tell these niggas
Rapping now, they should sign language
Their anguish lets talk
Why are they still rapping?
What do they think will happen?
Are they thinking I'll fade back
And someone new will pass him?
And if its you that gas and niggers
Ask if you d clappin
You don't want Jude reacting
That's one of them who attacked him?
Nigga I'm killing shit twice as nice two assassins
That means I'm four amassing many more
Chips to cash in
CBN we lock the house down padlock
I'm making capital call a nigga caps lock
We balling hard in dubai, check the shit I'm coppin
Y'all niggas picture what you like to buy
Photoshopping
My niggas wealthy too, we steady yelling YOLO often
We double dating models, you took the SOLO option
They say I shouldn't brag, but man this fuckin track
Y'all rappers really blow, you bring a sucker back
You tryna hold the game, it isn't hugging back
And I'm the MVP, there's no summing that
Y'all niggas tellin tall tales nigga I been short
I spit that murder rap, my lines are in court
And y'all are on the bench
You tryna judge me right?
You never loved a nigga, you super ugly dyke
You rappers taking shots, you'll end up blackin out
Plus you can't back up hardly none the shit
You rap about
The coolest cat, flow is so cold I'm spittin flem
My words confuse a nigga, now they not gettin M's
Get it?

[Verse2 Intro: Yung6ix & MI Abaga]
Cause when you diss, dope dealers wanna [Export]
Them say my swagger be like sometin wey dem [Export]
Eat alaba wit my CD tell dem [Export]
I say [Export]  You say [Export]

[Verse2: Yung6ix]
Hey yo
Always come first like the first day on january
And you not always there 29th February
It's Yung6ix and the incredible legendary
If hip hop is dead I must be rappin from
The cemetery
Sleeping on the nigga and they woke up
Just to realize that I am number one
Whenver they analyze. If shit ain't from choc city
I don't wanna know the price
Cuz I'm the real story all these rappers summarize
No dating, take em out like a sniper
I was made for this shit, you can call me diaper
King of the south, watch the throne
Cause I'm over it. And I'm the best
Like I tell my Ex , get over it
They say love it blind, haters do you see me yet?
Cause right now I think
I'm feelin like my p square
Cause all the girls wanna do me yeah
And I don't fuss it comes natural, Pubic hair
Nigerians living legend, like Wole Soyinka
With the kind of swag, Wole wants to show Yinka
Don't give a fuck like a chick seein a Mazdas
And I don't gotta calculate to know where my x is
Simple mathematics, cause she just left ma room
Solving some bedmatics
My flows are too sick, now call dat illmatic
And I'm still matic, It's Yungsix over six
Simple mathematics
That means I am the one
Plus I am the father, but shining like the sun
And dissin me is like preparing for your funeral
Olowu you can count on me Numerals
And you don't want me in your face , Eczema(s)
Simply cause the boys on point, decimals
And shout shout to everyone that's been reppin me
Cause now I blew like the game ended, referee
Like a conscience patience all my checks are
Full of commas
Used to be so broke , all my days were full of dramas
But now I'm at the top, and I'm relaxin
I mean like my hair, I'm relaxing
I see things clear now with the feelins of a blind man
More buzz than a bee, I got hype like a sand man
Pay my dues like I was fine man
Still rap like I’m on sand man
Like the second hand, Yung6ix is always on time man
And this the motherfucking life that I pray for
The same motherfucker weezy your girls getting laid for
So fucking fly that’s the same shit you need grades for
People paid up to see me, then that’s what I paid for
Ain't fishing but I got lines and natural hooks for
The kinda guy that your dream girl looks for
99 saw the crisis, no mid life
22 seen more pussies than a mid wife
