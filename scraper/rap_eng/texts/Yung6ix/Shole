Am more than a Christian, I gat some blood on my shoes

Your girl gave me time like my baswe from prison
New whips on the way eh, new trips on the way eh

Alert alert alert eh, new slips on the way eh
Shake it for me like it’s pokisis, I gat pills on the way

The popo stop me and they wanna check my phone
Cos am the young king who turn the chat to a troll

Gat out of prison, am back on my grind
I gat two baddies that stay on my lounge
They call me daddy, they say that they’ my own
They tell me they love me, I know that they lie
Rocking designers, am fresh outta mall
Jacking myself and am fresher than y’all
Came from the bottom, I just wanna ball
All my guys don dey ball, so I no fit dey dull
(No no no)

Yea, they digging my style, I put that on guard
I bought the bob put the bill on my card
I put the ball then she gat me on hard
Am taking my chick while she looking the frame
Made her come a few times and we did it again
Fu-king the hoe but I don’t fall in love
If you’ loving the hoe, omo boy, you dey dull
