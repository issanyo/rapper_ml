How you feel

In the night

Cuddle when we chill

Kiss your face

Take it  to your chest

Let me think

Going in

Got you begging please

Eat you up

Turn it to a feast

On repeat

Yeah I put it on repeat

No I never give my baby drama

And in the bed you know we skip the gramma

I just say I’m going in I don’t need a armor

Nah Nah

She say she love the boy from Africana

She get the fruits of her labour when she Take Banana
