Your body tingalingalean, then I make a ring
Down the the club make we go down
Down to the floor. Farabale baby wa je ka jo

Verse 2: Yung6ix
Shake it like u don't care, you got my niggas staring baby all night long, I just want to be there all day, and I be thinking about it baby all night long, I mean maybe we could go there, that's anywhere u want you can call my phone, so listen to me closely, we can start by been friends but I don't want that zone, Bombay B B your the one bae
And I figure out your the one bae
I probably put a ring on it one day, cause your the one bae
I ain't really into game but we foreplay
Head to head on the bed baby foreplay
Kabiru say u gotta leave but you know say
I full ground for you matter concrete
I got u smiling with my lines, I'm a killer on this beat baby you know this are crimes
All this women want me cause I'm almost in my prime, put a Rollie on your wrist if all you really want is time
