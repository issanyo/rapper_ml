[Intro: Yung6ix]
Hey yo man, turn up my vocals
Mhen I ain't fucking with these locals
Where am from, if you don't grind
You stay broke
That's why we stay woke
All you niggas funny to me you stay jokes, uh

[Chorus: Yung6ix]
Always grinding but i stay woke
Never sleeping but i stay woke
Always grinding but i stay woke
Haters creeping but i stay woke
Always grinding but i stay woke
Never sleeping but i stay woke
Always grinding but i stay woke
Fans watching but i stay woke

5million, 6million, 7million, more
1billion, 2billion, 3billion, 4!
5billion, 6billion, 7billion, more

[Verse 1: Dremo]
(hey yo, hey yo, hey yo)
I hope, I hope you've not forgotten
(stay woke, stay woke, stay woke)
Omo getting money no be option
Tell boss you know the repercussion
It's all over you with your copies
And then I no dey care why you push your buttons
We we we up in a re-up
Re me me me plus 6 there are two Bros
They angry but acting excited
Niggas are two sided like Regina in the Boondocks
Can't see me, we've plan to be this, they want to feely
Bang!

[Verse 2: LoolooWithTheJuice]
I got all these bitches on tap
These niggas you know we oppress
Am riding i pull in a Benz

Hustle a day gotta get to the bank
Kill off and sitches with you in the bank
You just lieing just to get in a bank
You making noise but you here making cash, no

[Chorus: Yung6ix]
Always grinding but i stay woke
Never sleeping but i stay woke
Always grinding but i stay woke
Haters creeping but i stay woke
Always grinding but i stay woke
Never sleeping but i stay woke
Always grinding but i stay woke
Fans watching but i stay woke

[Verse 3: Sean Dennis]
I tell them boys make them stay woke
Unless you niggas wanna stay broke
These niggas depending on lifeline
You gat to hustle mehn or stay broke
