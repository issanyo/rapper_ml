[Verse 1]
I Still shine in the dark
So all they do is look like the chapter after mark
They tell me that they love me but I simply know they pretend
So I stay strong unlike days I got no week/weak ends
Beat it up like Travis Barker on the drum-set
Am so hot I swear I could make the sun sweat
Ok now let me speak… further…..
If you ain't the customs then why should you border me?
Am not who I used to be, feeling like another me
If I ain't the best then I swear there is another me-eeeee
And my mama keep saying god bless you
So am the one but in the mirror, I'm the best too
I came with a bat am making hits in all my sessions
Always win their heart like I rigged their suggestion
Told them de gonna need a lifetime just to be me
Them say I too deform but you don’t need a pen to fill me
Am in like vip while u out like the bouncer
If the best is the question then my name is the answer

[Chorus]
Got me going oh my gosh oh
See people waiting on me
Anticipating on me
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
Some people hating on me some celebrating for me
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
The way she put it on , way she put it on
Got me going
Oh ma (gosh oh, gosh oh)
The way she put it on me got me feeling funny
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
See people waiting on me
Anticipating on me
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
Some people hating on me some celebrating for me
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)

[Verse 2]
Flow so natural, I burst like a pimple
And the flow continues just like the sequel
We are not the-same , I am not like u people
Just like my fingers we are not equal
I do it big u do it squat ……….little
I dey with one(1) girl but she fine like  people
So f— tommy am the ill-lfiger
All this people do is hate just like my girls figure
Never see where am headed u gonna need my lens(eye lens)
Steady killing the beats they screaming out, stop the violence
Leave the beats black and blue like cops and their sirens
At their neck like a bow tie while I play dem like a violin
Champagnes on me tell me what u sipping
I must look like a journey cos I got the girls tripping
And now my song is their wake up tone …ya
They can't sleep on the boy …….insomnia
Always in the boot like I was kidnapped …..abduction
That’s simply why am on-top and you honda(under) end of discussion

[Chorus]
Got me going oh my gosh oh
See people waiting on me
Anticipating on me
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
Some people hating on me some celebrating for me
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
The way she put it on , way she put it on
Got me going
Oh ma (gosh oh, gosh oh)
The way she put it on me got me feeling funny
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
See people waiting on me
Anticipating on me
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
Some people hating on me some celebrating for me
Got me going

Verse3
If your dreams are big, then what are youu gonna call this?
Look at the life that I made out of all this
Now I got ur old girl wishing that they knew (new) me
Built a career of the rocks that they threw me
Looking at a niggaa u would think they see through me
But nothing do me

See people waiting on me
Anticipating on me
Got me going
Oh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)
Some people hating on me some celebrating for me
