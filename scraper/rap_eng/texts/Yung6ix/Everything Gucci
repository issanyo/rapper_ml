[Intro]
This is not the usual African Music

Oh everything
Oh everything
Eh baby everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Everything Gucci around me
Red and green
Everything Gucci around me
Baby tell me how you feel
Everything Gucci around me
Everything soft, everything soft
Girl, everything Gucci around me
Baby, tell me how you feel
I heard you pulled up in the South Side for me
I heart you been lookin' for me
In the kitchen you be cookin' for me
And everything Gucci for me

[Verse 1]
Yeah everything soft, everything soft
I will find you for everything lost, everything lost
Got to pay attention because everything cost, everything cost
You hit me in my pipeline everything paused, everything paused
You hit me in my pipeline
I was in the south side for you, I was looking for some love
I had to pull up in west side for you, you know I had to take a bus
I had to pull up in the east side for you, did shit for 20 bucks
I hd to pull up in the North Side for you, I was searchin' up in Chorski

[Chorus]
Everything Gucci around me
Red and green
Everything Gucci around me
Baby tell me how you feel
Everything Gucci around me
Everything soft, everything soft
Girl, everything Gucci around me
Baby, tell me how you feel
I heard you pulled up in the South Side for me
I heart you been lookin' for me
In the kitchen you be cookin' for me
And everything Gucci for me

[Bridge]
Yeah and everything Gucci
Eyes looking red, baby everything loosey
Everything soft, baby, everything gucci
Out of this world, baby everything droopy
Everything bad

[Chorus 2]
Everything Gucci around me
Red and green
Everything Gucci around me
Baby tell me how you feel
Everything Gucci around me
Everything soft, everything soft
Girl, everything Gucci around me
Red and green
I heard you pulled up in the South Side for me
I heart you been lookin' for me
In the kitchen you be cookin' for me
And everything Gucci for me
