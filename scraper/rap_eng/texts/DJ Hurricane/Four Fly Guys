"Ay why don't you put your hands together"

Since '79 I was rockin' the rhyme
Standin' in line yeah listen one time
'86 I was in the mix yeah
This here ain't no fuckin' trick
Well it's the King AdRock, it's my time to rhyme
Pass me a mirror cut me a line
Now I'm rappin' in stereo yeah
Cocaine crew say Blow!
Introspective rhyme collective
Rockin' at the party yeah that's our objective huh
My man Hurricane, down since the day
Took over on the mix from Doctor Dré
Well to the blacks and the whites and the Puerto Rican
Everybody wanna' hear the words I'm speakin' yeah
4 fly brothers and we turn it out
And when we leave the stage we leave no doubt

"1-2-3-4"
"4 Fly Guys"
"1-2-3-4"
"Turn it out"
"1-2-3-4"
"4 Fly Guys"
"1-2-3-4"
"Turn it out"

Got my mop-head comb with my light blue Keds
Bob your heads check my threads
As I run from the feds, but I'm not alone yeah
King AdRock take the microphone
Well I smoke hemp like Sean Kemp gets high
I'm fly…  You won't know why
A fifty-dollar bet you can kiss my ass
So move on over and let The Kid pass
I'm on the microphone with the "Hoo Ha!"
I make all the people scream and say Sha-Na-Na
I'm an emcee like you'll never be
Rockin' to the hills of Beverly
When I grab the mic I see the ladies comin' after me
Cause my shit is OG and that is how it's got to be

"1-2-3-4"
"4 Fly Guys"
"1-2-3-4"
"Turn it out"
"1-2-3-4"
"4 Fly Guys"
"1-2-3-4"
"Turn it out"

Oooh ah la-la-la
I grabs a microphone and scratch a Mardi Gras
Platattoon gimme room, gimme space
You can get a taste of the funky bass
I like a full bosom and big buttocks
Hear a funky rhyme and you know it's AdRock's
Cause I'm the man with the goddamn plan
Can't front on me when the mic's in my hand agh yea
Me and Adam, Adam down with the Cane and
Down since '86 and there's no complainin'
Still not strainin' rhymes are reignin'
Emcee trainin' no refrainin'
Wheels of steel, my man is all that
So never doubt the strength when you hear the rap
Cause since back in the day you always had my back
And now I'm One Two Three Four on the track

"1-2-3-4"
"4 Fly Guys" yeah
"1-2-3-4" four, four
"Turn it out" well keep it on y'all
"1-2-3-4"
"4 Fly Guys"
"1-2-3-4"

"Ay why don't you put your hands together"
"Ay why don't you put your hands together"
