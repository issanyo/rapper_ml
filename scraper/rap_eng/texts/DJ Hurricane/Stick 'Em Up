Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick your hands up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up in the air

Face down don't turn around
Listen to the bass pound
From all types of angles
This ain't no star spangled banner
More juice than tropicana
Rock from New York to Savannah
Cause it's Macka Framma?
When I go to a show
Some run some come plenty have fun
To watch a nigga' kick in
The right way, the hype way, the tight way
You're fucking right that I might say stick 'em

Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick your hands up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick your hand up
Stick 'em

Fronters get confronted while stunts get stunted
And my homies get blunted while the rats get hunted
So if you want it here it is so put em up or shut em up
Smack'em down and I'll yell pick'em up so get'em up
So word em up, as I fuck it up I tear it up
So listen up and don't move just play the groove
Don't dime when I crime cause kid that's fessin' up
But when I pull out my mag just raise em up

Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick your hands up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up in the air

"Quiet quiet! I don't wanna' have to kill anyone
---- -- --- Now ladies, start removing your jewellery
Stop it in this bag - you hey, empty your pockets
Come on come on! I'm in business quiet.. This is my
Wedding ring do I have to..You can keep the ring but
Not that bracelet. Thank you"

1 to the 3 to the motherfuckin' 2
And you don't know what I'mma do
That's because you're new but
I got the kaya make you feel higher
So say what you want you motherfuckin' liar
Before you run your mouth like you think you're braggin'
Go brush your teeth 'caus you've got the stink draggin'
I just think you should do what he says
Do what Cane says and stick 'em up

Hands high reach for the sky
But don't try to get fly cause it's easy to die
Just like a blink of an eye when the shots rang
Boom bang rat ta tat tat
Watch your back cause I'm coming black
Kill that yig yag put the money in the bag
Pass the zags with the Billboard Mag
But freeze feel the breeze if ya sneeze than you're shot
Now ya gotta run what'cha got

Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick your hands up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up in the air

"Stick-stick 'em"
