[Hook: Beastie Boys]
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Mike D, come and rock the sure shot

[Verse 1: Mike D]
I've got the brand new doo-doo, guaranteed like Yoo-hoo
I'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock]
Well it's the taking of the Pelham 1, 2, 3
If you want a doody rhyme, then come see me
I've got the savior faire with the unique rhymin'
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and

[Verse 3: MCA]
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
â€˜Cause at the boards is the man, they call the Mario

[Verse 4: Mike D]
You pull up at the function and you know I Kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozac
I've got more action than my man, John Woo
And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew (yeah)

[Hook: Beastie Boys]
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
You know you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Ad-Rock, come and rock the sure shot

[Verse 5: Ad-Rock]
Hurra-, Hurra-
Cane will cross fade on your ass and bust your eardrums
Listen everybody cause I'm shifting gears
I'm fresh like Dougie when I get my specs
And on the microphone, I come correct

[Verse 6: MCA]
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)

[Verse 7: Mike D]
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate

[Verse 8: Ad-Rock]
Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on
Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard
Never quittin', so won't you listen

[Hook: Beastie Boys]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yes, indeed, it's fun time
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
MCA, come and rock the sure shot

[Verse 9: MCA]
I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end

[Verse 10: Mike D]
Well, you say I'm twenty-something and I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD

[Verse 11: Ad-Rock]
Well, I'm that kid in the corner all fucked up and I wanna
So I'm gonna (yeah) take a piece of the pie
Why not, I'm not quittin'
Think I'm-a change up my style just to fit in

[Verse 12: MCA]
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication

[Hook: Beastie Boys]
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Keep on and rockin' the sure shot

B-boys, b-girls...
Tick-tock, tick-tick...tock-tock
