They will say you don't belong
They will assume you don't relate
They will underline your wrongs
They will expect you to be late
You are special, your talent pours from your pours
Your foot steps in directions that are most certainly correct
And your absolutely unsure
Those cold lonely dark hallways called "what if", yeah those are around
But if you don't back down you unlock that door with a warm heart
And dope situations in a room full of us, called "what now"
You wake up you win, you try you win, you fail you still win
Long as you alive cause if you die what then?
They will tell you, you only live once and that's true
But if you live correct and inspire him, that's two
And she, that's 3, 4 and more
5, strive, create your dream that creates your
Team that crates your steam till your hot
You know what I mean?
The arrival...
