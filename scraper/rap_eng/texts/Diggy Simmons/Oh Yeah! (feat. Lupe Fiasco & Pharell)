[Intro] Lupe' Fiasco
Diggy what's good man, its your big brother, Lupe'
Long time coming
Its like the future meets the future, of the future
You heard
Its some of that laid back, light up that nine chomper, let it marinade
You know
Some of that make you wonder, make you ponder
What's he on, most likely i'm beyonder
Its a beautiful thang'

[Verse 1] Lupe' Fiasco
This gone be a fine ride, see it in my minds eye
Black man in a white mans world, ha, blind side
Sweeter then key line pies, look how fast the time flies
Where you gone to be when the parties over and wine dries
Yeah we got nine lives, but they got nine knives
We only got once chance, and they get nine tries
Tell you the dimes fly, and baby girls a fine prize
All i see is money when i look inside this dimes eyes
Lifes a bitch, i'll be rich if i make her cry
Tears soft tissue turns to money, if you let it dry
Increase my worth and she get hurt
I'll make a fortune if she dies
Take her off of that machine, i'll benefit from her dimise
Damn, thats how we are
Take a life, than buy out the bar
So lets celebrate, lets make a toast
To succeed in life, just make it go

[hook] Diggy Simmons
I got em' like, they screaming like
I can't hear ya, louder

Oh yeah
You hear the crowd, they want it now, i puts it down
Oh yeah
Oh-oo-oh yeah yeah, oh-oo-oh yeah yeah
Oh-oo-oh yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2] Pharell
The one metatronic, mind control sonics
Davis and shakira, if ya tryna get me phonic
Bitches miss me they on it, haters diss leave a comment
And if how i ride make you sick of me, vomit
Let me finish my composite
As the game change its interesting how odd the cards get
Such a random thing and so ironic
I used the whole year trying to defy logic
Trying to be the birdy, j said it was to early
Just tryna tell you whats happening surely
I use my guts when my vision gets mirky
Help me, but thankyou lord at the same time, mercy

Excuse my french i guess i am not worthy
Quietly touching numbers like your watch observe
Often misunderstood, ya usely get me wrong
Ya tryna get it in, im tryna get it on
Life is your wife, they keep callin me say he did it wrong
Life dont suck suck life, until her titties gone
You niggas missions wrong plus you missinformed
Hanging under assholes you get shitted on

[hook] Diggy Simmons
I got em' like, they screaming like
I can't hear ya, louder
I got em like, they screaming like, turn it up
Oh yeah
You hear the crowd, they want it now, i puts it down
Oh yeah
Oh-oo-oh yeah yeah, oh-oo-oh yeah yeah
Oh-oo-oh yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 3] Diggy Simmons
Uh, ahead of my time, sometime like a pre-me
And I got the co-sign from the dude who was pre me
I don?t see none of y?all, you see me
Y?all can?t see me ya Stevie
Blow up and I make it look easy
Yeah I'm so wack cause Im on TV
If I am such an amateur when I come around what you panic for
Cause you know I?m hotter than a planets core
Hands are sore from writing ice colder than a winters lighting device
My clock is mantle so my timing?s tight I know you think that Lupe?s writing right
But I?m this nice, foolish thoughts
Got more class than my school is taught
You haters talk out your cheeks I call it do it saw
I hold it down in the streets I rep that New York
Just a youngin' thats doing his thing so why are you distraught
I got you buster?s so gusted cause I wasn?t so much just discussing
And i dont get up g and krumpin' got signed my cousins been coming
Don?t watch me, watch the repeats
You ain't ready know I think I?m Big Meech

[hook] Diggy Simmons
I got em' like, they screaming like
I can't hear ya, louder
I got em like, they screaming like, turn it up
Oh yeah
You hear the crowd, they want it now, i puts it down
Oh yeah
Oh-oo-oh yeah yeah, oh-oo-oh yeah yeah
Oh-oo-oh yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
