[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
Send your little soldiers to my door
And watch them fall down
Fall down
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
If you wish to test me start a war
And watch them fall down
Fall down

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
I kill anything you send at me, got no time for frenimies
So either you respect me or neglect me, can't get rid of me
These fake, fake niggas they ain't who they pretend to be
These shake weight niggas out here ruining the industry
Either you a copy or a clone
You ratchet or you trapping or you tryna watch the throne
And I won't let they actions be distracting all my goals
Niggas I used to know acting like groupies in my phone, guess we on
We was home, now we made our dreams realer
And since they never pushed me, I don't know if I'm a killer
We can find out together, try to be a scene stealer
Man I'll bomb on you niggas in a minute, Reggie Miller
I ain't afraid to tango with rivals until they strangle
Cause ain't nothing ever shameful in victory if it's painful
And for the crown that dangles I'll battle at every angle
I run circles around your triangles
Wassup?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmmons]
Don't know how any grown rapper would consider me a subject
And I ain't even got my first Benz sitting on dubs yet
I guess I rattled you snaggletooth you know better
Thought J stood for Jermaine not Jet Setter
You see me and shook my hand copping pleas in person
Now you act less than a man mentioning me in verses
Man you used to have dreams of my big sister kissing ya
Now it's nightmares of a little brother dissing ya
Sneak disses and jabs I don't really see the benefit
But I guess you lame and I probably keep you relevant
Maybe you should sign with me instead of Mr. Carter
How you mad at me I got a relationship with my father, huh?
Guess I’m the second one to give this man a platform
But I won’t go as far as saying cats should clap for em
And if they did then this verse might as well be a hearse
Killed you, ain't even curse nigga

[Hook]

[Outro: Diggy Simmons]
Just a lil' nigga with talent!
