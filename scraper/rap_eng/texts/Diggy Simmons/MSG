[Intro: Diggy Simmons]

Jetsetters
In the place to be
I go by the name of D I two G's
And we're gonna set it off like we in MSG
Ya'll ready to rock?

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]

Yea, I said it's on like Madison Square
Another day, another blessing
I'm just glad to be here
See I do this for ya'll
I know ya'll rather be here
At first them haters will boo you
But then they'll gradually cheer
That's why a nigga be rolling
Always keeping it forward
Keep a positive vibe
And stay away from them almonds
Aye lil mama you holding
Yeah that thing is rolling
Right around your colon
Now turn around and show it
I can tell that she want it
Bet I can get at your lady
Don't wanna mess with my army
Or better yet it's a navy
They'll remember the feeling
They might forget what you're saying
So as long as you feel this
I'm unforgettable baby, DIGGY!

[Hook: x2]

Said it's on like Madison Square
All my hustlers, all my ladies
Let me know you in here
Middle fingers to suckers
Chuck a duece to the haters
I need a moment of silence
Now back to the paper

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]

I'm headlining the tour
Shoes lining the stores
I'm winning without a blemish
Good luck finding a flaw
You heard they signed me for thousands
Nuh-uh they signed me for more
Ya'll really think that I'm wavey
Then I'll tsunami you all
And there's no need to talk
Unless you talking bout commas
Cause we got nothin in common
Unless you talking 'bout rhyming
And if you talking bout spitting
I'm in a different position
So long freshman class
The principals bout to skip me
Graduating with honors
They all relate cause I'm honest
Here's the homie 'bout to go and get a burger from Hollis
They say the sky's the limit
Well I'm passing the margin babe
That's the name of the car
I wasn't asking for Martin, Ha!

[Hook x2]

Said it's on like Madison Square
All my hustlers, all my ladies
Let me know you in here
Middle fingers to suckers
Chuck a duece to the haters
I need a moment of silence
Now back to the paper

[Verse 3: Diggy Simmons]

To the competition, R.I.P
Rolling a 5 cop league
Stay in a 5 star suite
And I just order room service
Any time a nigga want eat
Just tell the hotel send a bill up, Chauncey
Watch ya gon't see
Diggy, Diggy, kill it
Was taught never reveal your intentions always conceal it
To traders like Don Cheadle
They messy like eating cheetos
And the world is a big haystack and I'm a needle
Really hard to find, truly one of a kind
If I give you my number baby, please don't run up my line
Cause I got business to handle
I got money to get
Talk is cheap so you'll never see me running my lip
Ya hear?

[Hook x2]

Said it's on like Madison Square
All my hustlers, all my ladies
Let me know you in here
Middle fingers to suckers
Chuck a duece to the haters
I need a moment of silence
Now back to the paper

[Outro: Diggy Simmons]

I don't wanna go to yoga
