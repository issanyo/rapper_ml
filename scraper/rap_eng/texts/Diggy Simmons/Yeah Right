INTRO - DIGGY VM (1)
Yo what up Dionne it's Diggy
I got erm caught up in the studio doing some things
So I'm erm a hit you later
Verse 1
Maybe you caught the train just like you said you did
Maybe it broke down but you didn't give up
Maybe you got pinned down by all the weight of gifts
That you were bringing me to show your love
Maybe you got lost on the way back to my house
Maybe you called and I was on the phone
Maybe you thought if you were late I'd throw you out
Maybe you think I like being on my own
Chorus
Yeah right
Yeah right
I mean honestly
You lied to me like I'm not there
Yeah right
Yeah right
You must be mad you lied so bad
Just listen to yourself
Yeah right
Yeah right
You'll lose my love
If you keep it up
Yeah right Mmm
Verse 2
Maybe you got messed up by someone in your past
Maybe you give me what they gave to you
Maybe it all makes sense of why you run so fast
Acting like this is some police interview
Maybe you're waiting for my birthday to arrive
And then you're gonna tell me everything
Chorus
Yeah right
Yeah right
I mean honestly
You lied to me like I'm not there
Yeah right
Yeah right
You must be mad you lied so bad
Just listen to yourself
Yeah right
Yeah right
You'll lose my love

If you keep it up
Yeah right Mmm
