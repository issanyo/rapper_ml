[Intro: Shianne Phillips]
Take me as I am
Or you can have nothing
Nothing at all

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Uh, yeah
Never understood why discrimination existed amongst us people
When all of us wanna be taken equal
Not for the colour of our skin, or the fact that we fit in
Criteria should be on what's within
The heart, mind and soul and where we tryna go
Cuase of we caught in the past, how we gonna reach our goals
People be so concerned about the cons instead of the pros
That preconcieved notions be blocking out on my flows
They be acting like they know they be real quick to throw it out
To turn about a kid of the numbers in his bank account
I'd appreciate it if you listen then open your mouth
Feel alot better if you knew wht you was talking bout
Just a youngin grindin feelin inside
That he hasnt got hes point accross after numerous times yeah
Tellin people hes a normal kid
Following dreams and hopes of one day to makin it big

[Hook: Shianne Phillips]
So why dont you take me as I am
Or you can have nothing, nothing at all
So take me as I am
Or have nothing at all

[Verse 2: Diggy]
Just looking around at all the people that surround
None of them was with me though, months ago but tellin me
The way that I should go about it the things that I should put out
When its expression to me you can tell me how
The ways the ropes of being a D I double G G Y
The little nigga, thats gonna be fly
But alot of the time hes just gotta swallow hes pride
Despite of all the people thats making him feel depride
Other feels shocked just because of where he came from
Labelling what i've done, when you ain't even here taste of
None of still on me, I dont even care say some
I done heard it all so your two cents won't hurt none
And I know that I'mma keep going wit it
And I know the ridicule im rolling with it
Just aslong im taking for who am
And where im going cause thats most important to my fam

[Hook: Shianne Phillips]
So why dont you take me as I am
Or you can have nothing, nothing at all
So take me as I am
Or have nothing at all
