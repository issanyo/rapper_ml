[Chorus]
Get on my dick on that dizzy shit (ya)
Cruising 'round the city with a pretty chick (swerve)
You can never get a baby Diggy did
She wanted me since I was a little kid
I can handle what you thought, you know it
You rockin' with the boy, enjoy (enjoy it)
They wanna be the man, I know it (I know it)
I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin' (yeah)
I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin' (goin' right)
Yeah, I'm the reason why they goin'
I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin' (yeah, treat you right)
I'm the reason why they goin' (swear)

[Verse]
Duck duck goose, knock knock boots, I'm that loose
She said down, I touched down, ducked the goose
She like white, she like brown, I like deuce (I like deuce)
She told lies, girl don't lie I'm the truth (I'm that nigga)
Annie, are you okay? Who would've known that she would go someday
Could've been awesome plan, not one thing that my bros could say
We ain't making while we in this club
She want a selfie with the boy, she tryna build a buzz
How you get it in them jeans, I'm tryna live in there
Her booty fluffy like some stuffing in the [?] bear
She dropped out of school, she said just because
Hmm, what a stupid ass, I get stupid [?]
She need money funny nigga, what the fuck is love?
She road trippin' with the bestie just to move the buzz
Yeah, she road trippin' with the bestie just to move the buzz
I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin'

[Chorus]
Get on my dick on that dizzy shit (ya)
Cruising 'round the city with a pretty chick (swerve)
You can never get a baby Diggy did
She wanted me since I was a little kid
I can handle what you thought, you know it
You rockin' with the boy, enjoy (enjoy it)
They wanna be the man, I know it (I know it)
I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin' (yeah)
I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin' (goin' right)
Yeah, I'm the reason why they goin'
I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin' (yeah, treat you right)
I'm the reason why they goin' (swear)

[Outro]
Ay, I'm the reason why they goin'
Ay, I'm the reason why they in this bitch
Ay, I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin'
I'm the reason why they in this bitch goin'
Ay, I'm the reason why they in this bitch
