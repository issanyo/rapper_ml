Live from the Apple
Slicing the American pie
With dope lyrics
Watch me get America high
By your appearance I can get a glimpse of your vibe
They say you are what you wear, I am Yves Saint Laurant
Mixing Martin Margiella
Catch me at the Montreyon
Fella I’m getting money thats why you all jealous
This ain't a rap song, this is a rap psalm
Immaculate so I’ma be the first to cast on
In kindergarten I was filling out my tax form
While my other class mates was learning Jimmy Crack Corn
? how can I go broad, riding shot gun with Lupe through Chicago hood
Hat tilted to the side like a GD bumping a Pac Cd
Picture me rollin’ holla when you see me
This easy sorta like my ABC’s
And I’ll take another ? nigga 1,2,3
Know my name when I spell, it’s D-I two G’s
Rather die before I’m telling see I’m too G

Digg is like
Life or death
I’m a rebel
My poety’s deep I never fell
Digg is like
Half man half amazing
Digg is like
Life or death
I’m a rebel
My poety’s deep I never fell
Digg is like
Half man half amazing

It’s the return of the light skin
Okay alright then
The king on my name is sperated by a hyphen
Looking at my Breitling it’s about that time
Stunting like a Badboy out the Porsche just shine
Gotta rap like a peda stomp a rat in front of pedo
When its comes to cooking heaters I’m a baker like I need her
Can’t come up ? like a phone off the reciever
I know you’re all eager to see me compete with Bieber
Not knowing thats my homie, we chilling kicking our feet up
Don’t do business with a worker so direct me to your leader
In a few years I’ll be the chairman of ?, Warner, Elektra, Atlantic, re-up
And when I go watch the money go pre-nup
We going hard in the paint nigga D-up
Try to bring the heat and you’ll still lose if ya’ll team up
This is for my fly niggas jetsetters we are
