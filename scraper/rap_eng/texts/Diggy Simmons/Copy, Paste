[Intro]
Uh, it's Diggy
Queens, you with me
Yeah, let's get it, let's get it
G-g-g-g go

[Verse 1]
Check my million-dollar swag
I tell em 10-4 cause they wanna copy that
Uh, in the mall, lotta shopping bags
Baby girl what you want, your boy got the tab
If your man say where you at
I'mma tell him I ain't seen her
Better hit her on the jack
She's gone for the evening
I make em lean back, Don Cartegena
You know what's up Martin, Tom, and Gina
I'm the lead-off like Derek Jeter
They copy my demeanor
They be rocking
I know they watching
They act like I don't see em

[Hook]
Yeah I'll never stop
Keep me on my job and
They be tryna copy and paste me
Copy and paste me
I'm on, and I be in my zone
And they be tryna copy and paste me
Copy and paste me, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Peep my shoe game
Look how I'm rocking 'em rahh
Moccasins or go Jeremy Scott on her, rahh
Loubotin
Look like they got spots on her
My ratings is up cause everybody's watching it
I be V.I.P. you in line where the rope is
Don't come any closer, you might step on my Cultures
Ladies it's your jam leave your jacket on the sofa
Have a little class, put your glass up on a coaster
Get up on the floor shake it shake like you're supposed to
If you know getting over tell them copy, copy, over

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Copy paste
Copy copy, paste
Everything that I do they trying do the same thing (same thing)
Copy paste
Copy copy, paste
Try to do it how I do it, they can't do it like me (like me)
Copy paste
Copy copy copy paste
Copy paste paste

[Hook]
