[Chorus: Bruno Mars (& Diggy Simmons)]
You shot me through the heart starin' in your eyes (your eyes)
So I might die a happy man today (today)
Just empty out your barrel, girl
It’s alright (haha)
Click clack away (click clack away)
Click clack away (click clack away)
Go ‘head (pull it, pull it, pull it)
Yeah yeah
(Pull it, pull it, pull it)
Yeah yeah
Pull it, pull it
Go ahead, make my day (make my day)
Click clack away

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
You got weapons of mass seduction
If I was broke I’d give you half of nothing
Or give it all then I'd give you more
I’m no decorator but the writing’s on the wall
Winter, summer, fall, April, May and June
You shot me through the heart but I don’t have a wound
You got a good aim cause I could’ve sworn I moved
When it comes to relationships I don’t have a clue
Love at first sight I don’t know I zoom
You put a hit on me ba da bing, ba da boom
If this is pain let me hurry up and suffer
What doesn’t kill me should make my love tougher
I’m tough now, wassup now?
Fire at me, I swear I won’t duck down
Wow, you had me in awe
You ain’t have to shoot girl you had me from your draw

[Chorus: Bruno Mars (& Diggy Simmons)]
You shot me through the heart starin' in your eyes (your eyes)
So I might die a happy man today (today)
Just empty out your barrel, girl
It’s alright (haha)
Click clack away (click clack away)
Click clack away (click clack away)
Go ‘head (pull it, pull it, pull it)
Yeah yeah
(Pull it, pull it, pull it)
Yeah yeah
Pull it, pull it
Go ahead, make my day (make my day)
Click clack away

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
You take away my very breath
Call 911 Mary, Clef
No need to ask if I’m ready, yes
I go get my tux and you go get your dress
And we gon’ do it big although we just met
I was just being fresh, yeah, I know I’m a mess
But I like spontaneity, continuity
Let it flow let it flow just you and me
And I’m not pressin' charges
Don’t want you to ricochet and hit another target
You take me to the edge, right up to the margin
All I see is fireworks, I can feel it sparkin'
Hope you keep me at the center of your bullseye
And you know it’s more benefits or full time
You are everything and more
You ain’t have to shoot, girl, you had me from your draw

[Chorus: Bruno Mars (& Diggy Simmons)]
You shot me through the heart starin' in your eyes (your eyes)
So I might die a happy man today (today)
Just empty out your barrel, girl
It’s alright (haha)
Click clack away (click clack away)
Click clack away (click clack away)
Go ‘head (pull it, pull it, pull it)
Yeah yeah
(Pull it, pull it, pull it)
Yeah yeah
Pull it, pull it
Go ahead, make my day (make my day)
