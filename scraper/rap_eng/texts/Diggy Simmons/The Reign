{Verse 1-Diggy}
This the type of joint to make my stock rise
The type of joint you gotta turn the volume clockwise
Hear it from down the block haters turn it counterclock
House party girls dancing on the counter top
The young boss, so do as he says and I'm only sixteen
Yeah dieciseis Ha, Life's a beach and I'm playing in her sandbox
I'm a lover not a fighter but my man box, time flies and I never been afraid of heights
Only beef I ever had was with a plate of rice, it cost to warn you niggas can't pay the price
So I ain't gotta say it let alone say it twice Right?

Gonna be a long ride, before I touch the ground
They been waiting for a long time, But I ain't falling down

{Verse 2-Diggy}
They say I swerved in the fast lane and I'm only on cause my last name
Can't choose your family but, you can friends
I got my own money now so help me choose a Benz
Beamer or Porsche Nine-Elev
I'm numb to the bull
So I'm kinda like whatev, whatev
Yeah, you know how I do Unexpected Arrival
Now I'm an idol's idol
If kings are born then I'm coming for my title
If kings are born then I'm coming for my title
If you ain't get that then light one and sit back
Im outta here nig I see you wanna get back
D-I-G and its

{Hook}
Gonna be a long ride, before I touch the ground
They been waiting for a long time, But I ain't falling down

{Verse 3-Diggy}
I guess this is the time for me to give thanks
For everybody that participated by they ranks
Starting with GOD, let me make apparent
And of course I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my parents
P. Boyd and Sean Garrett, Far laid and Atlantic
Paul Bulk and the Jones Girls forgiving the clearance
Now that that matter is all settled
Its back to the rhymes like breaks down to the medal
All black everything expect for the kicks
If the bottoms ain't red
Its Js the six
Can you stand the reign New Edition posts Bobby
Know ya’ll thinking “Damn this little man so cocky”

Im just me though...thankful...UA!

{Hook}
Gonna be a long ride, before I touch the ground
They been waiting for a long time, But I ain't falling down
