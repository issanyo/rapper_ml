D.I.G.G. he fly as they describe him
Why son blow up so high they crtitcize him
Besides Run prolly called Russell
They try to lie son
Naw son
I fight for the prize I got my eyes on
Mines on being a part of the new horizon
At&t deals done, next is Verizon
Flow more wiser than rhymes by womanizers
Finna blem blaze a party with Mike Casazza
Snapbacks and Jordans ain't that important when you headlining the Essence Festival in New Orleans
Super dome feeling super grown flow was stupid long yeah you know the song
Sometimes I get my cupid on
Don't confuse the tune with Jeremih
Like I won't spit fire and ruin your whole high
I say that to inspire the questions that you inquire
And I know that you admire A&R's a lie
Young king so my crown's big
Keep a tight circle nigga well rounded
I'm way more than who you put me pound for pound with
Weigh more, you don't get it? Stay astounded
All of that compounded by the blessings that I've counted
Ask Bert my accountant if I leave home without it
I stay dumbfounded got my SUV surrounded by the girls that crowd around it
And it's true don't it sound big
As they knocking on the window, they just wanna get close, pictures on they iPhone
She say she love me for my first rhyme and now she want me to be her first time
17 in the Seventeen same damn time, full spread Source magazine
Scream Tour's fully booked, money. But Prodigy said I killed the Shook Ones dunney
And it's the balance, that isn't so apparent when you'd rather pitch in homie than to see my full talent
Just because I managed to have them screaming like Khaled don't mean my raps invalid
JetSetters off the planet. Lemme hear that back...
