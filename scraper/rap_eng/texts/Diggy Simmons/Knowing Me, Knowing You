[Chorus:]
How are you I'm just fine How's you family tell them hi
Heard that you got another guy As long as your happy
Makes you smile Don't be a stranger you should stop by
Hmmm again no Cause knowing Me knowing you (we will be
Right back [x2]) Knowing you

[Verse 1:]
Right back to where we started All the arguing all the
Heart ackes All the good times too we used to party Is
It worth it huh Is it worth it cause Time is money are
We ready for this purchase Or are we gonna waist it
Face it it's just the surface Physical attraction but
We are here for a purpose Perfect women or really real
Women Ain't perfect I got to keep it real wiht ya girl
I'm kind of nervous cause knowing me and Knowing you we
Will have the time of our lifes Then tomorrow we will
Be through You say you ain't calling me I say I ain't
Calling you Few months and weeks and you out on the
Street Then we speck and you lesser then we re-choose
And I'm lesser then were weak

[Chorus:]
How are you I'm just fine How's you family tell them hi
Heard that you got another guy As long as your happy
Makes you smile Don't be a stranger you should stop by
Hmmm again no Cause knowing Me knowing you (we will be
Right back [x2]) Knowing you

[Verse 2:]
We right back where we started now Wish we could stay
Where we started out You can't put your hand back when
You card is out You gotta play it It's like the old
Saying"Better to love than to not of it all But we
Gotta keep it moving Cause all we do is star I'll be
There when you need me If ever you should fall You are
In my life like a season winter, summer, fall But I
Left out spring cause that's a new beginning And I'm a
Bout to start a new but I'm wishing you were in it Wish
You were here and be my buddy But you got a new man and
That's difficult to share When the music stops playing
And your siting in the chair Win some loose some it's
Like that But knowing me knowing you we will be right
Back

[Chorus:]
How are you I'm just fine How's you family tell them hi
Heard that you got another guy As long as your happy
Makes you smile Don't be a stranger you should stop by
Hmmm again no Cause knowing Me knowing you (we will be
Right back [x2]) Knowing you
