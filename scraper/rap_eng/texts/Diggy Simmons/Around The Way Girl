[Hook]
I've been all, around the world
And I finally found my true around the way girl
She so hood, that's alright
Cause I need that type of loving in my life

[Verse 1]
I like a girl with extensions in her hair
Or it could be hers, either way I don't care
Walkin to the laundromat in your uggs and sweats
With ya head scarf on and you still look fresh
And the, latest fashion hood but so classic
You got your own cash, you don't never have to ask
Cause you independent Chanel, Louis, Fendi
And on a light day, you might H&M it, Century 21, can't wait to be 21
And you know everybody so you stay in the loop
Kick it with your home girls after school on the stoop
You can have jays on and you still look cute
This what I like, man what a sight
Such a girly girl but you be ready to fight
Wasn't raised round here but sometimes I stay
So let's hear for the girls from around the world
I've been all, around the world

[Hook]
I've been all, around the world
And I finally found my true around the way girl
She so hood, that's alright
Cause I need that type of loving in my life

[Verse 2]
Standing at the bus stop, shuffle through your iPod
Hustlers try to kick it to you, every time they drive by
Bye, with the boom and system, if he don't come correct I know you'll dismiss him
Got style, you want you a man but not know
Cause you focused on school, so it's gonna be a while
You can walk with a strut and talk the streets slang
Mary J, Chaka Khan, you still my sweet thang
With a petite frame and your nice round round
From the projects, but you can fit in downtown
Summer time, at the park, while the homeboys ball
Everybody jocking you but it ainâ€™t your fault
Cause they don't do it like you, nah, and you know it
Got a lot of confidence, step afraid to show it
Wasn't raised round here but sometimes I stay
So one time for the girls from around the world

[Verse 3]
I've been all, around the world
And I finally found my true around the way girl
She so hood, that's alright
Cause I need that type of loving in my life
I've been looking for that special round the way girl
You were right here all along
Didn't never go that far at all
To find my round away girl
I've been all, around the world
And I finally found my true around the way girl
She so hood, that's alright
Cause I need that type of loving in my life
