[Verse 1]
I feel like I was never single, I was always in love
You kept it trill and some niggas kept tripping, you was my girl
I feel like I was running outta time giving you the world, world
Running outta time
Young nigga, young nigga telling them all I know
Bad boy like Diddy, like Martin, like Mike Larry
I feel like in any city, ain't no other nigga like mine, mine
Ain't no other city, with some other niggas

[Pre-Hook]
Like oh
Have you ready for a nigga when I walk up in the room
And I stay down so I'm up
Put that on mine, this shit so loud, I feel like God

[Hook]
Now have you ever been through a place? Tell me what it feel like
And when your heart turn cold, nigga it don't feel right
On top of the world, I wanna know what it feel like
Feel like, feel like
Now have you ever been through a place? Tell me what it feel like
And when your heart turn cold, nigga it don't feel right
On top of the world, I wanna know what it feel like
Feel like, feel like

[Verse 2]
Feel like if I'mma do it, I'mma do it on my own
I know that life goes on but right now, I'm in my zone
I feel like when I go under, I'mma go right my wrongs
Wrongs, wrongs and my rights
I feel I'm growing, I feel I'm growing, growing, growing
That feeling, love it, so I'mma keep going and going and going
We going for night, keep up with the good life
We ball 'til the sunlight, shawty with the headlights, tell me what it feel like, feel like

[Pre-Hook]
Like oh
Have you ready for a nigga when I walk up in the room
And I stay down so I'm up
Put that on mine, this shit so loud, I feel like God

[Hook]
Now have you ever been through a place? Tell me what it feel like
And when your heart turn cold, nigga it don't feel right
On top of the world, I wanna know what it feel like
Feel like, feel like
Now have you ever been through a place? Tell me what it feel like
And when your heart turn cold, nigga it don't feel right
On top of the world, I wanna know what it feel like
Feel like, feel like
