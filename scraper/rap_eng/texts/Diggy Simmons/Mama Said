My mama said: "Don't be afraid to shit on all these niggas."
My mama said :"Don't be afraid babe" (It's Diggy)

My mama said don't be afraid to shit on all these niggas (what my Mama said)
My mama said don't be afraid babe x2 (I'ma say what she said)

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Nigga
Mama said fuck'em, so I went and said fuck'em
They ain't do shit for me, so I don't owe a nigga nothing
No shade, no shots, no shows, no features, no drops
Go and listen to your gut, nigga, don't stop
Cause these ma'fuckas really don't know hot
Key Wane got to drummin', and I hit the track running
Niggas know i'm come from and I been froth coming
Till you know what i be coming just a young man stuntin'
Got racks by the hunnits and your girlfriend love it (HA)
You know what she might see, let her go low, now she got high hopes
Don't call her back now she spites me
Tell her on TV... yeah i know
Got a Georgia peach on South Beach
Yeah that's where i took my talent
Where you would've found me at that fount b
Yung boi stuntin' hard on cali
Wanna hear a challenge if i say put your balances
Nigga this ain't no allowances some niggas a cowards
Might have pretty good knowledge...but, damn they got limited powers (FUCK’EM)
So if you shitted on me, nigga that's your bad
Shit that happens everyday b
But, my mama said
I get it, I did it fuck niggas you see i'm on
I get it, I did it fuck niggas you see come on

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
All the of the days they said i wouldn't be shit, that’s why I’m the shit
All of the nights i spend in the dark without any light that why i get lit
All of the hell i endeavor for this
All of the hours invested into this
And you know what they said time is money if so consider this money will spent
And I’m laughing all the way to bank
When all y’all nigga said what i wouldn't be, what i shouldn't be
But just look at me now, you better look at me
And they gettin’ me now it’s booking fee
Came up from the crooked streets a wild child with some crooked teeth
They should put me in the textbook next to Booker T
Live it, live it
Living my life to the limit, but my card ain't got no limit
Doing all kinds of exquisite activities i don’t wanna get too specific
Living the lifestyle we’re living
Woman they friends call me .....
This entertainment buss ain't what it is if i don’t own your television
We don’t owe y’all, we don’t know y’all
Nigga cheers
On the phone call sending postcards from Brazil
