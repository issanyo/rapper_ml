[Tank]
We livin' good
Everyday it's all good
Alright

[Diggy]
Look, swag on inf a dag on pimp
Rock can make the stiletto drag on rough rider
Now miotis throw your flags up, yes sir
You a bird but that don't mean you dress floer
A lot of people hatin' on me, never seen me on
You grouch, Oscar, Academy Award
I can play now, first, yea I had to do my chores
Met a cougar and she told me call her madame me amor
Even though I'm a minor I can do what a major
Bring it to any rappers
Serve it to 'em like it's catered
Bet you bottom dollar
You could place a wager
Won't be saved by the bell
You ain't A.C. Slater
Mirror mirror on the wall tell me who's the greatest? You are
And what you do to the beat is just heinous
A few years back people use to play us
I can smell the vicks now somebody call the vapors

[Tank]
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Like every day is New Year's night (every day is New Year's night)
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Another day in paradise

[Diggy]
I'm hall SV and my father
Get my fly, get my fresh, I'm Armada
This is my house, gettin' rid of all these waters
If you ain't gonna do it you know get off off the pot,uh
First week watch my numbers match Harry Potter's
Blast off you can tell Houston we have a problem
My shoe felucca rude boy Rihanna
I'm tryin' to swim with the sharks but you just a sea otter
You're not on my level, we can never see eye to eye
On my fly, you can call me young Sodom
Gomorra, the mall, took the history as I got 'em
(Yo shorts that you got 'em?)
Yea, Perry I got 'em
And I'm about to run all you Jokers out of Gotham
You could throw shade but I'm a still blossom
A rose in the concrete, my echelon's peaked
She got my peak as an avatar sweet

[Tank]
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Like every day is New Year's night (every day we livin' good)
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Another day in paradise (it's another day in paradise)

[Diggy]
You say you're number one, I think you got your list wrong
This calculator like Bra-Man from fifth floor
Four fingers up and each will have a ring soon
The king of rap, yea that got a nice ring to it
All in the fam, Archie, and if you're pick of words go against me
I'm a make you eat it
I'm taking over, taking over Genghis Khan
So hot I can burn through the frame retort
Shh I'm talkin', everyone remain cool
I can teach you how to work it, trade school
It's my occasion, you're witnessing the torch passing
You can't buy love but I brought passion
I'm thinkin' massive, my money sick
I'm thinkin' magic, no pun intend
Believe me, I make it look easy
I'm good money, Yeezy, Weezy

[Tank]
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Like every day is New Year's night (every day for me is a holiday yea)
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Another day in paradise (it's another day in paradise)

The big homie Tank ladies and gentlemen
Oh livin' good
[X2:] All day every day
