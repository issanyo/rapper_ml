(Diggy)
Uhh yeah, uh uh uh uh yeah...
But girl, I gotta let you know that...

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
I know we're apart but
You still got my heart and...
Do you ever, think about me?
No I don't deserve this
What we had was perfect
I just want you to know, girl
That I'm always, Thinking bout you

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Hey Ms. Anonymous
Lately I've been reminiscing
On all our kisses and what we had
I'm kind of missing, it got me trippin'
Cause everything just been so different and
Every time I'm in the heights, It got a nigga thinkin'
What if she better off without me just runnin' abroad
Do she got a new man or just waiting up on my calls?
Can't figure it out but I know I gave you my all
Funny how you took it for granted and then just called it off
The jewelry , the flowers , them late night hours
When I would confess the way I felt told you
I thought the world was ours
But I guess I was mistaken
Because when I was in Vegas
I got a call when you were saying that you couldn't take it
What? Yeah she said it was just too much
Girl what you think this was a crush?
Nah, I wasn't even in a rush
But the way you had me feelin'
I thought you wanted us

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Verse 2: Diggy]
Everything seemed so perfect, almost like a dream
I guess a nightmare in disguise is all that you can see
But through the eyes of everyone around as well as me
We knew that our chemistry incredibly made us complete
So when it went down I was at a loss for words
I couldn't take it everything that I just heard
And anything that happened between us was now a blur
Cause only last week we were good then that occurred
So unexpected, your behavior didn't reflect it
Felt disconnected something between us intersected
All the affection gone, what happened to the blessing
We had together for so long, you and I perfected
I bet to you it didn't mean a lot
I mean I know you said it did, but right on the spot
You went and ban me from your life like a boycott
Well just imagine how much hurt this boy got

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Bridge: Diggy]
Late night just putting up a fight
With my feelings when I know it ain't right
Ain't never had this much strife in my life
But baby I can't stop
Thinking bout you
[X2]
