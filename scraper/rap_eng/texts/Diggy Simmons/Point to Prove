[Intro]
You know they said I was born with a gold spoon in my mouth right
Well actually it was platinum
But the real point is
I didn't plan on this type of life
I didn't ask for this honestly
But something I can plan on is
Wanting to be myself

[Verse 1]
Yeah, and I already know what you expect
Uh
Now let me tell you what you gon' get
You might've seen me in the fast lane flash frame
Now let me guess, you already know my last name
You probably seen me on t.v
Life so easy
But what is it even like to be me
People jumping to conclusions
My own name is what im proving
My independent movement, no illusion
But this ain't nothing new, been rapping since the age of five
Spitting in the basement in Queens in 1999
I'm writing my own rhymes
Even though my dad is Run you've never seen Mike Joran dunking for his son, huh
But just cause
Im backseat driven dont mean im not driven, trynna make a living
Best teen rapper in my division because they flippin his title is what im trippin im given yall something different

[Hook]
Cause I got a point to prove
And for all the nay-sayers this joints' for you
And for all the non-believers im spittin' the truth
And unlike these little dudes im paying my dues
So how canIlose?
I got a point to prove
And for all the nay-sayers this joints' for you
And for all the non-believers im spittin' the truth
And unlike these little dudes im paying my dues
So how canIlose?
I got a point to prove

[Verse 2]
I bet I'mma see about half a hundred comments
'Bout how I ain't the hottest and how I ain't modest
At least I ain't here rapping about some violence or nonsense of any age old-school or novice
And you know I got this
And they can't stop it
Andy Milonakis
Flow so retarded
Never wanna use my dads name as a crutch
So Im here to prove a point without him or my Uncle Russ
Don't get me wrong I ain't got a problem with the legacy
Im just tryna do me create my own credibility
You know them haters probably sayin' his daddy made a phone call
But he probably hearing this the same time as all yall
Ya boy digga is a young go getta
Bringin in that currency and he is a real spitta
They sittin at the keyboard bashing him on TwitterÂ®
Gossiping like girls, I'll send you Pastries from my sisters
Whoa, I bet you had the wrong assumption
Probably though I would be whack and rap about nothing
Yeah im just a youngin thats makin moves
And yeah I know that I got a point to prove

[Hook]
