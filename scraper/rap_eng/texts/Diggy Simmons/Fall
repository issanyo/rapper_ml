Verse 1:
Who said enough was ever enough?
When we let 'em make the rules for us?
And you know we shine like the sun
So put it in drive cause we're on the run

Pre-Chorus:
So let's break all the rules
I want you to hold me down like you love it
Kissing and touching all in public
It's like a scene from a movie, yea
And we ain't worried about nothing
We so high think I'm buzzing now

Chorus:
Since we're on the edge we should fall
Fall, Fall
No stopping us
We should fall
Baby we should fall
Fall, fall in love or whatever

Verse 2:
And we never pick up when they call (no,no)
We don't got time to get involve
Too busy running this world like we should be
And God only knows our destiny

Pre-Chorus:
So let's break all the rules
I want you to hold me down like you love it
Kissing and touching all in public
It's like a scene from a movie, yea
And we ain't worried about nothing
We so high think I'm buzzing now

Chorus:
Since we're on the edge we should fall
Fall, Fall
No stopping us
We should fall
Baby we should fall
Fall,fall in love or whatever

Ooh, we'll never apologize
We'll never apologize

They saying that we moving like we in a race
Probably shouldn't make it cause we didn't wait, wait
But I told 'em to ventilate
Let it breathe
If it's wrong
Let us see girl
We gone run the world like we supposed to
They think local
We think global
Ya girlfriends saying they don't know you
Used to do soul food now you used to Nobu
You learning all type of new things
I know they mad you my new thang
Changed your view now your view changed
Mm mm damn girl you ain't nothing to Wu-Tang
(Since we're on the edge we should fall)
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothing to ya
(Fall, fall)
No stopping us we should fall
Baby we should fall
Fall, fall in love or whatever
