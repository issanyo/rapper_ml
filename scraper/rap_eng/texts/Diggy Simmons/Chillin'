[Verse 1]
Before we even start we gonna need a break
The way we been on and on
Oh yeah, you better know
See the sun going down it's kind of late
Tell me what you want, what you saw
On the day when you fell in love

[Hook]
When I'm in the buildin'
Feel like it's the beginnin'
Feel like I made a killin'
Swear I just made a killin'
Gotta keep it real and
Oh, I love this feelin'
My nigga i'm chillin'
MY nigga i'm chillin'
Feel like I'm off a pill and
My whip ain't got no ceilin'
There goes another day
Here comes another million
Gotta keep it real and
They ask me how I'm feelin'
My nigga I'm chillin'
My nigga I'm chillin'

[Verse 2]
Oh girl i'm just chillin'
Don't know what's coming over me
But i love this feeling
Feel just like it's supposed to be
Go with me, homie we
Do them things you taught to me
And don't say i just read that
You know that this don't come for free
Lady, I want a lady, that want a lady
Get a few dices, gets invaded
I don't see no wrong
If you want to use your tongue
Take a look at the kid
Grown up, got big
Ain't no shit they can say
When i pull up in this whip
I'm the shit, I'm the shit
And your man the opposite
He going to always call you back
I just come over and hit
I'm a rider
Spy your girl tryna pull an all-nighter
Real nigga
See all that fake be counterfeit
Man this flow just make me sick
I overheard you got the boot
Cause you know we knockin' it now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I know how you feel about me
And all my past ways
Guess thats why your here
Without me couldn't meet you halfway
Sad face, sad face you giving me sad face
My bad bae, but you make me mad face
Giving ain't that easy
[?] you something different
They see me on tv now
They offer me the knees down
Peace out
