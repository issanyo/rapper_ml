[Verse 1]

They wanna take away my black card
Cause I gotta black card
Say I don't rap hard
Cause I don't act hard
But if I act hard
They would say that's odd
And they would still hate
I don't get that part
I'm too poise to be one of the boys
Think I gotta man servant with your pride or toy
Why yall so salty
Too much sodium soy
Kill your brother and it's you that you only destroy
Why should I apoligize?
For my father's wallet size
Now they wanna get volitile
Have my mother share the pain in Mrs. Wallace eyes
Nah
We done came too far
Why my brothers gotta fight like mufasa and scar
Get caught up in the system
That they profiting off
And they don't see none of the profits at all

[Hook:]
Look how far we've come
From singing freedom songs
So why can't we get along
My brother
Why you questioning of this blackness
(and to my homies I say you can't deny me my)
Unforgiveable blackness
Unforgiveable blackness
Unforgiveable blackness

[Verse 2]

I could see Malcolm at the podeom
On the ground and Betty Shabazz holding em'
He tried to fight it but his wounds took a tole on em'
Dr. King too
Man it got both of em'
The governments war for petrolem
And the streets too warm for control of it
Every hood from Oakland to Magnolia
Black men I don't know what came over us
Stop the silliness my Ni...
I would never really lynch my Ni...
And I don't spell it with an E R
I spell it with an A cause that is not what we are
We were once kings
Till we got consumed by material things
Womanizing all the women
And material bringings
This hook is powerful so lets hear it again

[Hook]

You think you know
But you don't know the half of it
I don't rap for the cash in it
I do it cause I'm passionate
It's my destiny
I have to spit
The real MC's
Im'm the last of it
I ain't down
Cause I ain't form the ghetto
Can't relate to scarface
But I read Othello
I ain't from the projects
I'm more from the meadows
We've both seen racism on the same level
From Memphis to Zimbabwe
Yall got the same blood that's in my veins
I ain't the enemy
So why you in my face
I ain't your enemy so let's make peace

[Hook]
