[Chorus]
It is what it is, yeah
It is what it is, yeah
Never play yourself, pay yourself, hmm
It is what it is, go 'head do it big

[Verse 1]
On your way to try to it big
Try your best not to do a bid
I wanted momma to be proud of this
Start the Porsche and see how loud it is
Start a business we could make a killin'
Stop the pain we could start the healin'
Was in my head around the clock
I had to tell the devil stop
Go and give it what you got
What you got is a lot
And that's the truth ain't no need to lie
I'm on the other side I don't need to die
I've been gettin' blessings, I ain't even tried
Took a break and they mistake it for demise
Lookin' dead at you bet I look alive
What you mad at? This a glad rap

[Chorus]
It is what it is, yeah
It is what it is, yeah
Never play yourself, pay yourself, nigga
It is what it is, go 'head do it big
It is what it is, yeah
It is what it is, yeah
Never play yourself, pay yourself, hmm
It is what it is, go 'head do it big

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh, look
Coming back's only for the GOAT
Jesus Christ on parade flows
Real rappers so rare nowadays
I was unaware they made those
Forget the memories of the old me
They better run me what they owe me
Cold shoulder don't hold heat
He ain't cold focus just on OD
I'm more than gettin' by, que sera sera
See the goal then I take 'em by surprise
I'ma thrive baby ain't a doubt of mine
Thinkin' otherwise than you out of mind
It don't matter what amount of time
If this ain't Heaven then I gotta climb
We puttin' God over dollar signs
The God inside me askin' "who am I?"

[Chorus]
It is what it is, yeah
It is what it is, yeah
Never play yourself, pay yourself, hmm
It is what it is, go 'head do it big
It is what it is, yeah
It is what it is, yeah
Never play yourself, pay yourself, hmm
It is what it is, go 'head do it big

[Verse 3]
What I don't have is what I don't need
Dive deep and I won't breathe
Under pressure in a dark place, what you don't see is what you should believe
Big mama clappin' tambourine
My momma clappin' Hercules
Lil' momma clappin', actin' up
My audience get me lit as fuck
Drop the world on a young nigga
Got surprised when I lift it up
When I was sittin' it was written I was-
Figurin' how to use my super powers
Every night workin' stupid hours
Through the city like an Uber driver
Pick the money up like we do the flowers
'Til this whole garden you and ours

[Chorus]
It is what it is, yeah
It is what it is, yeah
Never play yourself, pay yourself, hmm
It is what it is, go 'head do it big
It is what it is, yeah
It is what it is, yeah
Never play yourself, pay yourself
It is what it is, go 'head do it big
