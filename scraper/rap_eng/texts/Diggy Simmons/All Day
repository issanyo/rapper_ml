One time for your mama for giving you that figure
One time for your daddy girl for giving you that yea
First thing when I wake up in the morning
When I go lay down for the day
Girl you must be tired you've been running through my mind
All day, all day
You've been running through my mind
All day, all day
You've been running through my mind
It only gets worse when I see you
A nigga can't even think straight
Girl I know you tired you've been running through my mind all day

Baby this is your song
Baby you can't do no wrong
Only the best for you
Gave me your heart, now come give me the rest of you all day
Trace in my bed, you trace them away
When them niggas be trying to get at you but I got you now so they know they can't have you
When we together I'm caught up in time
When I'm too busy you don't even mind
I love when you sing all the words to my rhyme
You always know what to say at the right time

Now one time for your mama for giving you that ass
When you with me you get ratchet, outside you got class

One time for your mama for giving you that figure
One time for your daddy girl for giving you that yea
First thing when I wake up in the morning
When I go lay down for the day
Girl you must be tired you've been running through my mind
All day, all day
You've been running through my mind
All day, all day
You've been running through my mind
It only gets worse when I see you
A nigga can't even think straight
Girl I know you tired you've been running through my mind all day

All the girls in the wor-orld (wor-orld)
Ain't got nothing on you babe (you babe)
I know I fell a few times
You stayed by my side, you ain't go nowhere (nowhere)
I don't roll with no crew (crew)
My team is just me and you (you)
Told you we go to the top of the world
Now come here and come look at this view
You make me wanna sing to you
Tell me what I mean to you
And I ain't gone lie, I ain't gone lie
I'm ready to make you wake our neighbors up
Take off that dress, come get this bomb
Girl when I'm through you gone still feel it tomorrow

One time for your mama for giving you that figure
One time for your daddy girl for giving you that yea
First thing when I wake up in the morning
When I go lay down for the day
Girl you must be tired you've been running through my mind
All day, all day
You've been running through my mind
All day, all day
You've been running through my mind
It only gets worse when I see you
A nigga can't even think straight
Girl I know you tired you've been running through my mind all day
