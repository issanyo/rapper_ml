[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
Yeah, it’s been debated and contemplated if Diggy’s overrated
But what the haters have stated never penetrated, I’m so creative and innovative
And I stay motivated by the concept of famous and I ain’t even made it
The flow I cater is something major, an indicator of what happens later
It’s greater than you’ve anticipated, some people love it the way I does it
That’s why I leave them buzzing’ cause they calling me sick
Something like Robitussin, I hear you coughing, I treat you often with freestyle
And as I’m walking, the people talking, they see now
And I know rap for my age like Lil Bow Wow
Son of a king so why would I ever bow down?
Young lyricist uh, nigga be killing it
You hearing it the words out of my mouth, fresher than spearmint
It’s no experiment, independent appearances the way that I’m appearing
I did it without my parents but I’m still God-fearing
Filled with the holy spirit so I fly like an angel and none of y’all even near it
Life is just like a whip and I’m old enough to be steering
And now I’m born in Queens so Nas gave me the clearance

[Hook]
Flow stupid, I made you look
Y’all are slaves to a page in my Macbook
They didn’t know I could rap, I had them all shook
Yeah I’m a fashion nigga, here’s a new look
Flow stupid, I made you look
Y’all are slaves to a page in my Macbook
They didn’t know I could rap, I had them all shook
Yeah I’m a fashion nigga, here’s a new look

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
Yeah I got ‘em looking so pardon me as I check my fresh
Manifest success and end up truly blessed
They hearing guesses about the ventures I’m doing next
Is there a problem? Just trying to be the best dressed
Well I’m just aiming to be the greatest and nothing less
Entertaining stadiums, radios as I progress
On my whole tribe, on the quest to be the best
So I came in the whole Q in the tip, living with no regrets
No stressing is evidence of my confidence
Cutting down arrogance but still being monstrous
Part of the problem is it’s all about the politics
And most of what they posting on the blogs ain’t as hot as this
