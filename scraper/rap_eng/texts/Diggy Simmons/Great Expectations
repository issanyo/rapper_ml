Yeah, I'm ready, yeah

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
They want me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
With my back against the wall
Put my head to the sky
No, I won't let 'em break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I'm ready)

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
All the stares and all the glares
They waiting on him
And all the weight from all the hate
It's gaining on him
The intensity as it rises
Nobody can disguise it
It's like he got fire in his eyelids
The crowd is roaring, it's so enormous
His blood is boiling
His head is down and he's focused
He wishes they'd ignore him
Who in they right mind
Wants to let his light shine
He ain't even in his prime
Pressure of a lifetime
He standing steady, hands sweaty
May be nervous, but ready
The skepticism lies heavy
He's bout to make it petty
He got his fam on his back
Bout to carry like Chevy
So much on his plate
He hopes the repercussions ain't deadly
But he ain't gonna back down, for what?
He faces right now and he
Knows that he will out stand every
Doubter that's around
Misconceptions are knocked out
There will no longer be doubt
He hears them boo but he won't stop
Till his name is what they shout

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
He's no longer fearing
Now swerving past 'em and persevering
The way he's staring is clearing
All that could be competition
Immediate intuition is winning
He's never slipping
Been hearing them saying that
He could be the best that ever did it
Their expectations lie high
So he's just praying, "Can I
Be the best man I could ever be?
To exceed everything they want me to be
No anxiety, just gonna do me
And always proceed for the ones that believe
In the young man that's dedicated with a potential to achieve"
So I'mma keep going, keep flowing, keep knowing
I'm the dopest, my rhymes are potent
But I'mma need you to know it
I know where I came from but I stay so hungry and focused
Like I was focusing and wasn't nearly in one of the closest
Great expectations, I got 'em waiting, anticipating
They all debating on if he's hype or will he be staying
So now I'm saying, I'm reaching to be one of the greatest
So if you hate it take it cause I won't stop even when I make it

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Bridge: Bei Maejor]
Staring into heaven with my headphones on
You can see it in my eyes and know
That I'm the one they have been waiting for
I know my dreams are waiting for me
And looking down ain't the way to go, noooo
Follow your dreams
Follow your dreams
We got great expectations

[Outro: Diggy Simmons]
Not til' they screaming my name, yeah [x2]
I ain't gonna give up the game, yeah [x3]
Not til' they screaming my name, yeah [x2]
I ain't gonna give up the game [x3]
