[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Thank you for listening to the sounds
Of the First Flight Mixtape
By yours truly, Diggy
Presented by Ill Roots.com and DJ Spinking
But theres one last thing
I gotta say

[Verse 1]
Uh
Just a kid tryna make it by the name of Diggy
Born in the big city
The adrenaline of the streets
Keep him on his grizzy
Another man on the come up
Keep him on his tippy
So he's always staying busy
Full of pity
Thats why all of my lyrics so witty
When I say I wrote it, y'all never really believe me
The ignorance of every comment on each blog
He's a rich kid, why he rapping he don't need a job
They say they love jay, but every one of them out to hustle
There all close minded cuz I'm not going through struggle
The assumption that imma get a deal from uncle Russel
Is slim to none cuz I said I'm on my hustle and bustle
I Gotta make it thats the only thing on my mind
On my grind cuz I'm really feeling that it is my time
I worked hard on this for every last one of ya
Especially for the hater that'll never buy an album bruh
But its okay I'm just turning my stripes
[?]
Even though that they say I'm set for life
This dream coming true is the thing keeping my mind right
Cuz anything I try just seems to create strife
This is the only thing I really wanna do with my life
[?]
As each day goes on I'm feeling like this is it
No mike Jackson won't let hate cause my fear
Not comin off a high horse to shed a haters tear
You always hear a dude saying this is my year
But for the young gunna up
Can we please give a cheer to the future of the game
The first flight I'm taking off
And every last one of them gunna remember my name
