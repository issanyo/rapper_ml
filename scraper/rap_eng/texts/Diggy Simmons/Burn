[Verse 1]
Stay fresh, you can smell it on me
Peep the way I dress, you ain’t got this homie
Van Assche’s up on my feet
Some monster beats and they made by me
I’m all about it
Can’t talk about it
Tell C. Lotti go and get that feat
They awe struck when they see me
Got 'em going crazy like Stevie
Not Joselline
But got lots of them
And I stay with a couple of Ri Ris
And I ain’t talking retarted
But yeah that body retarted
Said she knows I’m 17
And she can’t wait 'til I get started
And that ain’t even what I’m tripping off
4th tour that I’m kicking off
Need rest after this jet lag and
These fresh tags that I’m ripping off
I rip 'em off!
I rip 'em off!
Cats out here with alotta fear
They looking hard, but they spitting soft
Shout out to the homies showing us love in the D
Had the line around the corner in the hood at Shantinique
You see Diggy out in Philly, so shout out my homie Meek
Had him come out out my show before he signed to MMG
See, I’ll tell you what you wanna know
I just seen the homie, Cole
He say he ain’t doing nothing to her
Hey, I let it go
You know that I’m smart enough not to get all swallowed up
By the crazy gossipers tryna make it popular
No amateur. See, You ain’t gonna catch me slipping on that camera:
Cheese,Ain’t feeling none of these young boys, I’m no Sandusky
Slow flow for my stamina, breathe
Y’all keep talking ’bout my first week
I don't know why y’all bother
Sold out every show this year, cheapest seat 10 dollars
Now, times that by 3 thou
Times that by like 18
And I ain’t even 18, so what you look like hating me?
I’m made to be majorly and creatively able
Because the greatest enabled me when he came out in ’83
And so basically, haters be mostly made up of fakery
Not as mad as they say they be
When they see me, they're neighborly

[Hook]
Like stop!
We ain’t caring when you pop
We ain’t caring when you drop
We ain’t grinning, we just grinding
Steady winning. Better let that just burn
Let that just burn
Let that just burn
Let that just burn
Yeah, I’m out here getting money, homie
I ain’t even 20, and I don’t owe my soul in return
Better let that just burn

[Outro: Perry}
Yeah, let that shit burn!
Don’t know what the fuck y’all thought!
That’s right, we back
2012, 2013
Say Cheese
P Water
And I’m out

[Outro: Diggy]
Jetsetters up!
