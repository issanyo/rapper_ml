[Verse 1: Marissa]
You know the right things to say babe
Even though some of what you saying I've heard before
I want you so bad boy I'm not playing
There's just something about you that I can't ignore
Oooo you making me want to do things I never dooo
Well I hope that you don't make me look like a fool
Boy I'm falling for you

[Chorus: Marissa]
Cause I'm ready
And baby nothing can change my mind
Cause I'm ready
Boy I want this to last a lifetime
Make your way to me touch me anywhere you please
Boy I want you right now
Cause I'm ready
Baby show me what your love's about

[Interlude: Diggy Simmons]
Ima show you baby
Ima show you baby
Ima show you baby
Ima show you baby
Make sure you ready sure you ready
Ima show you baby
Ima show you baby

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
I can feel it baby is you really ready
It's about to be a long damn night
Kissing on your navel Ima need a favor
Talk to me tell me what it feel like oh
Rough sex you like pain
50 shades huh like Grey
Get some handcuffs and some ice cream
Spike Lee now I'm about to do the right thing
Hold over your body that's the only way it gotta be
I'm tryna take you on a shopping spree hit it on the balcony
Yea pulling on your hair got you feeling every part of me
And the way that I be going deep I probably hit a ovary
You in Digg's world be a big girl don't trip know you a nigga been trill
Just shot a video in Bev Hills that shit was looking like Tip Drill
The funny thing about it we be synchronizing and when you think about me I be thinking about you
Put your fingers out let's put a ring around it wait
Now don't be telling me this if you ain't ready for that
And before we get ahead of the steps I mean what is the truth go on tell me the facts
This for a lifetime
We bout to get it with the lights on
But keep talking that freak shit girl you got a nigga ready right now

[Chorus: Marissa]
Cause I'm ready
And baby nothing can change my mind
Cause I'm ready
Boy I want this to last a lifetime
Make your way to me
Touch me anywhere you please
Boy I want you right now
Cause I'm ready
Baby show me what your love's about
