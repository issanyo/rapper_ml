[Verse 1: Diggy]
I got too much to lose to be sketchy
And if I yield be my shield and protect me
All I need is you alone, I do my own dirty work
Meet me and get ready for something new
December 31st
Mentally, spiritually, subsequently sexually
"Here's my number hit me with a text"
Is what you said to me
I gave you mine and said to do the same
It's a shame how we gotta play these petty little games
I'm just hoping that you...

[Chorus: Diggy, Leven Kali]
Text me
Yeah baby this Diggy in your DM
Maybe one day you can be my bm
But right now just...
Text me
Yeah, I know you staying at home still
I can do your parents a favor and pay your phone bill
Yea, two thumbs that's my type
Press send, change your life
Like oh oh oh
Please don't take your time
Don't make me wait too long

[Verse 2: Diggy]
Second week of August you be on the Vineyard
Parents got money but you ain't no big spender
Rather be out fighting for your people and your gender
I'm just seeing if I could fit into the agenda
Earthy girl, you be out at AfroPunk
With your crew drunk dancing, with that ass all plump
Saying that I know I press my luck
But I ain't trying to impress just to fuck
That's more stress for what
Girl...

[Chorus: Diggy, Leven Kali]
Text me
Yeah baby this Diggy in your DM
Maybe one day you can be my bm
But right now just...
Text me
Yeah, I know you staying at home still
I can do your parents a favor and pay your phone bill
Yea, two thumbs that's my type
Press send, change your life
Like ooh ooh ooh
Please don't take your time
Don't make me wait too long

[Verse 3: Leven Kali]
I been staring at my phone
Singing 'bout you girl, every single song
I don't even need a call back, yeah
Just a reason not to fall back, yeah yeah
Am I doing too much
Am I asking too much
I don't mean for you to rush
I just need for you to...

[Chorus: Diggy, Leven Kali]
Text me
Yeah baby this Diggy in your DM
Maybe one day you can be my bm
But right now just...
Text me
Yeah, I know you staying at home still
I can do your parents a favor and pay your phone bill
Two thumbs that's my type
Press send, change your life
Like ooh ooh oh oh oh
Please don't take your time
Don't make me wait too long

[Outro]
One second's way too long
