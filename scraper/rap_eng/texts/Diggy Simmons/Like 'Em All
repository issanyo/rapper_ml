[Verse 1: Jacob Latimore]
She's the prettiest thing that you ever did see
You may not see her in the magazines
But I know that she gotta be made for me
Cause we fit together so perfectly

[Hook:]
Ohh shes the baddest
Yeah yeah she the baddest
Oh she's the baddest
Yeah yeah she the baddest

I’m so impressed cause she got it all
So beautiful I see all your flaws
I like 'em all
I-I like 'em all
It don’t matter to me
Cause I like the way you are

Every single one of your flaws
It don’t matter cause you have a heart
I like em all
I-I like 'em all
It don’t matter to me
Cause I like the way you are

[Verse 2: Jacob Latimore]
Ain’t no way I could see someone else for me
She the Juliet in my love story
Back back back it up
Can't no one compete
If I was a snare she's the kick to my beat

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Diggy Simmons]
I like your flaws you are perfect the way you are
All I would change is your name to make you mine
I like your attitude can't even get mad at you
Whether its Malibu or Jamaica Avenue
With you its all the same
I like it when you wear your hair that way
I like it with no make up on your face
I like it mama say mama sa Ma Ma Mokki Sa

Anything that you want
I got you ma
We can head to Soho
The boutique shop
On your mark, get set, go
Shop till you drop
Here the key now let go
My heart solo

[Hook: Jacob]
