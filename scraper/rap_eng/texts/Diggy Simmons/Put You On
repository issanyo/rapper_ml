[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
You should roll with us, girl (I, I, I)
We got what you need, girl (I, I, I)

I'ma put you on, girl
I-I-I-I'ma put you on, oh, girl

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
Hey little miss, mama
Why don't you let me put you on game, ma?
That little young nigga they figure that take over someday so
Why don't you hop up on it?
These other suckers are no opponents
Say they got it but I flaunt it
Better than me? Hmm, girl, I doubt it
So tell me why you trippin' when I'm blazin'? Scottie Pippen
But I'm the main event, so you know I'ma go out and get it
Mrs. Simmons, may I please call you 'cause it sounds so nicely?
Never ever woulda thought that at fifteen I woulda done found my wifey
She just so bad with it, got a walk like a model
Got the perfect shape, make me wanna sip out that Coke bottle
Mmm, with a swag on full throttle
I'm tryna G her like there ain't no such thing as tomorrow
So Mrs. Fine, please let me just go and tell you why
You gotta be mine 'cause, girl, you are one of a kind
Stop wasting time 'cause, baby, it's only you and I
So we can talk all about us 'til the end of the night

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
You should roll with us, girl (I, I, I)
We got what you need, girl (I, I, I)
If you wanna roll with me, girl (I, I, I)
Don't waste no time (I, I, I, get in my car)
I'ma put you on, girl, yeah (I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
I'ma put you on, girl
I-I-I-I'ma put you on, oh, girl

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Uh, Breezy be my name (oh) I'm fresher than a pair of shoes
And haters mad 'cause I'm flyer than a parachute (Oh, oh)
Don't mean my dog when I say my car got no roof
Walk in my house, all my breezy's got on swimsuits
Get it wet, then I swim through (Yeah)
Then I take her to the venue (Yeah)
She like to do me, I eat sushi, she's my menu
I lace her up (lace her up) Michael Jordans (Jordans)
Fix the lense, my life's recording
'Cause I need all that, show me where them dollars at
You got a problem, I adjust it like a Starter cap
Me and Diggy gone, we on, nigga
He underage, I'm grown, nigga
But I bet yo wifey know all the words to our song, nigga
She fantasize 'bout Mr. Right and you're the wrong nigga
Haha, I'm kerosene heated
Spittin' like I'm bulimic
I live it, you niggas dream it

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
You should roll with us, girl (I, I, I)
We got what you need, girl (I, I, I)
If you wanna roll with me, girl (I, I, I)
Don't waste no time (I, I, I, get in my car)
I'ma put you on, girl, yeah (I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
I'ma put you on, girl
I-I-I-I'ma put you on, oh, girl

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
