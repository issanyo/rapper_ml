Sometimes it just feels like i'm gliding
Feels like I've jumped and can't come down
Feels like i'm out of space somewhere
Feels like i'm somewhere where there's no gravity
Everything ever could imagine
These dreams of mine that i'm crafting
In between the lines that i'm drafting
To the minds of teens that i'm impacting
This feels like, too surreal right
They all saying is he real tight or just tight
15 minutes of fame or is he the real deal
They all been waiting on greatness like mike
But i'm toasting, floating cruising, above
All the pessimist i'm the one choosing
My destination not their conclusion
Of negativity they been pursuing
So now i'm beaming some of them didn't believe in
My dreams and everything that i'm achieving
This is the reason gravity can alter i'm leaving
To the sky the future is the only thing that i'm seeing
Sometimes it just feels like i'm gliding
Feels like I've jumped and can't come down
Feels like i'm out of space somewhere
Feels like i'm somewhere where there's no gravity
Never been better cool like spring weather
On cloud 9 yea jetsetter
Never ever let the haters
Been get on my nerves
Cause with me everything is just coming together
Real good whether in the hood
Or the birds put ya hands up i know u understood
Lets celebrate life lets toast to the fact that
We could do whatever we want so don't go back
To living in doubt that isn't what life is about
Keep pursuing what u want there ain't time to pout
Only action no need to be running they mouth
Tomorrow isn't granted so you better be out
Go getting on grind times saying the worlds mine
You gotta believe it if you gon' do it right
So keep pushing for yours and putting up fight
And let or else be our side
Sometimes it just feels like i'm gliding
Feels like I've jumped and can't come down
Feels like i'm out of space somewhere
Feels like i'm somewhere where there's no gravity
Ooo Ohhh Yea (no Gravity)
I'm just floating in the air
And i can't come down (No Gravity)
Sometimes it just feels like i'm gliding
Feels like I've jumped and can't come down
Feels like i'm out of space somewhere
Feels like i'm somewhere where there's no gravity
