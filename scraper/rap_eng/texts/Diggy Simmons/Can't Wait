[Intro: Justin Bieber]
It's about that time Diggy
Polow tha Don out and over

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
Pardon, darling, put me on your line cause my heart is calling
Click over call wait tell them other dudes bye
They wasting all your minutes
Let me occupy your time keep you busy girl
I'm really tryna holla mama
Get to know you better if it's not a problem
So what's it gon' be? You always on my mind
You giving that feeling that I can die in your arms
Cause your body is so killing, I can wait as long as it takes
And you ain't gotta give me an answer today
Uh I just wanna hug you, love you, I can see me and you as a couple
Let me know when you're ready

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Ain't tryna speed, I ain't gonna lie
Girl I'm tryna get you on my side
Give it some time, time, time
But I wish it was now
I can't wait, can't wait any longer baby
I can't wait, can't wait 'til you belong to me
I can't wait, can't wait
'Til my dreams true me and it's you for the first time and I know

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
Ma, I love your Quincy Jones vibe, but you be acting shy and I think I know why
Okay let's play it safe, give me a chance
Girl let's spend out our days, I'm feeling like lil mama, I hit the lotto
There's no one hotter you a hard act to follow
You you really can't deny we look good together when we ride
I go for mine, when I see what I like
Girls just 'bout that life are usually not my type
I'm new when comes to love, but I'm willing to try just give me the sign

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Ain't tryna speed, I ain't gonna lie
Girl I'm tryna get you on my side
Give it some time, time, time
But I wish it was now
I can't wait, can't wait any longer baby
I can't wait, can't wait 'til you belong to me
I can't wait, can't wait
'Til my dreams true me and it's you for the first time and I know

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Put me up, up oh baby don't let another minute go by
All want is your body that's all that's been on my mind
Baby girl do you believe that you can be my only?
'Til you say yeah, all I can do is wait and see

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Ain't tryna speed, I ain't gonna lie
Girl I'm tryna get you on my side
Give it some time, time, time
But I wish it was now
I can't wait, can't wait any longer baby
I can't wait, can't wait 'til you belong to me
I can't wait, can't wait
'Til my dreams true me and it's you for the first time and I know

[Verse 4: Justin Bieber & Diggy Simmons]
Okay girl let's fly away, we can make a brighter day
We can fly to heaven, we can blow the sky away
I could be your man and no it won't be a secret
You can have my heart, and willing for you to keep it
Love I'm just tryna to seek it
And the top I'm just tryna reach it
Oh I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, I can't wait oh

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Ain't tryna speed, I ain't gonna lie
Girl I'm tryna get you on my side
Give it some time, time, time
But I wish it was now

I can't wait, can't wait 'til you belong to me
I can't wait, can't wait
'Til my dreams true me and it's you for the first time and I know
