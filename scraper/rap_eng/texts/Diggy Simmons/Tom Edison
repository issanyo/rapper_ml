Don't wanna look at me y'all crazy
Alpha Omega, the end all be all baby
I'm so authentic that they don't think your boy did it
They must be at their nooders that they don't pen it
Alla rocka I'd advise you notta
Go against me I'm I'll like Foxy Brands Nana
We party hard, yea honey this is hottie hall
And hall it hard that top go where your bodyguard
Kevin Costner, thick folium pasta
All to do is talk a good game like Rob Custard
Screamers that they have my bro hostage
Stop us and this mafia, we got all the bosses in pocket
In New York the ankles popping and the ball's the market
I may come across the lead till you cross the market
I'm a level one troop and never lost a target
You ain't talkin' big things, you ain't talkin' my joggie

I'm a mastermind who mastered money
Sayin' I can't rhyme that's a acid line
On a scale of one to ten I come after nine
You half a mind so that makes a Jackson Five
I'm a ambitious, all my vehicles match my drive
I' so strong like I could splash by tides
That's besides the point
You transgrammar with you glass disguise
Can't see that I'm the truth and need new glasses huh?
Oh it ain't fear, cha ching it ain't fear
Say I got a free ride, free ride no fear
I hear you never stood on the wealthy line
People be thinking just because I come from wealth all fine
No, I mean the money do help at times
Yea, I know you wanna judge for yourself that's fine
But trust me, you never know who's your friends
Upper class is phony, they all know how to pretend
I remember in school people used to be so cruel
Sayin' things like they didn't get coop cause of you
My reply was no, I think I'm cool cause I do
And I think I'm a pretty swell guy and sensitive cool
But anyway, back to the matter
I be dropping signs on them fractions of matter
I do it for all the people who actually matter
Those who hated wanna say once I passed on a ladder uh
Now we on, no cut off whispers
We came off what you cut off this this this
