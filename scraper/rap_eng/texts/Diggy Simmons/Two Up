(Intro)/(Chorus)

Two up, for this great life
If it feels right
Go head put it up
Everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes

Two up, for this great life
Yeah it feels right
Go head put it up
Everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes

Put your hands up high a-a-aa-a-a-aa-a-a-aa
Yeah, now keep them high a-a-aa-a-a-aa-a-a-aa
Yeahhhh

(Verse 1)

I'm feeling good, rather I'm feeling great
The game got me feeling older, but I don't feel the aches
I'm trynna eat
You trynna steal my plate
All the hate, throw it out the front door, Philip Banks
I know I can, but you feel I can't
You think my hype is all gas, but you fill my tank
How you fuel me, with what your cruelty
And I'm a beast on the mic and that's the beauty
I'm illmatic Nas, Reasonable Jay
My Adidas run, that's reasonable to say
And this season Ima rap it when I hit them with my ring
When your boy raises hell, everybody better pray
Ayyyyyyyy
Men, and women too
We don't hang cause misery loves the miserable
But if your life's love, let's kick it like flight club
Let's have a great day and see what the night does

(Chorus)

Two up, for this great life
If it feels right
Go head put it up
Everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes

Two up, for this great life
Yeah it feels right
Go head put it up
Everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes

Put your hands up high a-a-aa-a-a-aa-a-a-aa
Yeah, now keep them high a-a-aa-a-a-aa-a-a-aa
Yeahhhh

(Verse 2)

I got my smart suit on, I'm ingenious
I laugh but I'm serious, I mean it
I'm married to my craft and I don't intend on cheating
Might be tardy to the party but I'm early for the meeting
The smell of money lingers, go and take a wiff
You gone need some robitussin Ima make you sick
The first draft pick, I went straight into the pros
Now it's first class trips, I said later to the roads
I don't get elated, just creative with the flows
Sittin' on the globe and I'm using it as my comode
A-a-alone, that's gross I know
In a league of my own, ain't nobody close
So, clap your hands, For el Capitan
And somebody tell spin king to play this track again
And ain't no looking back, unless I'm backing in
Ima thank you in my speech when I win a-a-aa

(Chorus)

Two up, for this great life
If it feels right
Go head put it up
Everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes

Two up, for this great life
Yeah it feels right
Go head put it up
Everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes

Put your hands up high a-a-aa-a-a-aa-a-a-aa
Yeah, now keep them high a-a-aa-a-a-aa-a-a-aa
Yeahhhh
