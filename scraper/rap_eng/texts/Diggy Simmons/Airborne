[Intro]
As I take this journey I recognize my potential for success is just as great as my potential for failure
Fully aware of my current strengths and future weaknesses, experienced by those who came before me
The greats of my past have walked this way, left blueprints and they've lost themselves relapsed in recovery
I realize I am not the only young explorer however I am in no race the journey is all of ours, but I can not lie I desire the victory of achievement to be mine, humbled however fearless I am exposed to the criticism of onlookers, but my faith and direction come from above
I am airborne

[Verse 1: Diggy]
With doctors all around me, I live aimed through the atmosphere
Notions and adapts around me, but not impact no fear
Ya' want the celebrations, I want the constellations
Aline in all of my favor shinin' through all the nation
So when you kids wake up, I'm the brightest thing that you see
Cause I got my mind made up, and it ain't no sweet sixteen
Unless I write some down trend set and transmission
And as they float around, ya' get the first addition
Some said im spaced out, oh well I guess they right
Cause I got whole nother outlook I told ya on my first flight
Im just a youngin thats on a mission for the world to listen
An premonition a wonderful fathers had in vision
Im a rappers delight, these are the brakes
So heres the message, im on my way
Im a rare form, in rare form, young diggy im airborne

[Hook: Wynter Gordon]
I'm going airborne im taking me higher
I got the light now, and im on fire
Im on my way, (my way), (my way)
Im on my way, (my way), (my way) 2x
