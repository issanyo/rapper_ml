[Verse 1]
We throw a club in the clique nigga
I need a thug and a drink
Scream "The Inc" Till I'm "Gone" like N'SYNC
Bitches born for the scene
Ass fat like it was born in them jeans
They come on to my team
Now we on to a scheme
Ready for the tape on
Face on
Ass is up never
Glasses up better
Fuck it we brown paper baggin off the wagon
See who worth taggin
I play wit em but no slidin off
Im watchin him expression as I'm ridin off
Play 2-way tag but I'm not for baggin
Who press cats? Me
I was back like Jet Lagan
Your fuckin wit a I.G. associate
Want a dose of it?
Can't come close to it
Keep it brief like our game is been
With more albums I score see who worth more

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I play gats, knives wit em cause I love to chase
22"s on the Lex got em lovin my taste
Love ta pace
Mac doors got em lovin my face
38" on the waste you wastin wit your place
I don't know you better then I don't show you
But who's behind my chicks
Never mind
Never mind we never find one worth the energy
My angels on Hennessey thinking they see enemy
So keep it spinnin like Rule records on radios
Even out the ratio 7 and 1
All chicks from the front and the back
All cliques aw shit we here whenever we near
Sweetheart I ain't tryna swell you let me tell you
If you can bitter or spit me you can hit me
Shit I ain't met one yet
Ain't settlin foot to the pedal and cats keep on yellin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ok
Can go deeper then replies on the beeper
Ill work wit ya but lemme see if I fit ya
Im more complex then dinner and a movie
Nigga you gotta move me
A bitch kinda moody
So what's the plan of action
Get it crakin
What u working wit lets see if I can work wit it
Im no amateur game master
He has ta lay the mack down a little faster bastard
Too slow and I'm dustin em one up
Play the hood till the sun up they run up in
Im skirtin no flirtin
I ain't checkin em niggas still got the plot thickenin (thickenin)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
