[Merc]
Yeah, heh-heh
Not these niggas again
It's the world most talented record label
Murder INC

[Charli Baltimore]
Man you heard of us, murderous mamis
Cats observin' us, SL 430 Convertibles
Find me throwin' the M's at my mens
In timbs, mention $'s
It's hard to impress this
My boys rock T's over them vests
Thuggin' when he mash the ghetto princess
And no question, bag me baby daddy
Future will put you, main bitch will suit you
CHUCK!

[Ashanti]
I found something that could bring me joy
And I keep him right here next to me
My heart finally got a chance to see
How good loving came and set me free

1 - All my life
I've been searching for you
Everyday
So glad that I found you
All my life
I've been feeling for you
Everday
I'm so happy baby

Boy you know just how to make me smile
There's no other place I'd rather be
I'm so glad that you came around
And I know you know you knock me out

You blow my mind baby
I'm so alive with you babe
You blow my mind baby
I feel alive with you babe

Repeat 1

[Merc & D.O.]
Ashanti, yeah
How you ride man?
I ride out on daytons and dubs
What the deal cause these broads got me feelin' the bug
And you know when I'm up in the club I'm poppin' the bub
Ain't no stuntin' - frontin' for nothin'
We gettin' it up!
And it's all love for niggas that got love for I-N-C
Flossed up in the club, playa your eyez on me
I'll be in the drop top down
Something to see, hollerin' like shorty
We holler like whodi
It ain't nothing but a g thing, that's what's up
We gettin' it crunk and the bar is on us
I got like twelve bottles, I swiped the Visa, what
And yet you can't stand it, Chuck the red bandit
Chuck, Merc and D.O
You know its murda for sure, yeaaaaah
We throw a party tonight
Make sure the boss there, we feelin' happy tonight
You know!

Repeat 1

[Ashanti]
Boy you know, you know, you know you knock me out
So outstanding baby
Boy you knock me out

[Merc]
Ashanti, heh
Murder INC, the princess
Heh-heh-heh motherfuckers
