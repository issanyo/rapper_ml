Yo, this song is about four people that I loved and I lost
Try to feel me, yeah
Time flies
Still remember all the good times spent
Trips to the beach, watchin' horror flicks
And even though you and mom wasn't with each other
You all showed each other love like sister and brother
When I was small everyday you picked me up from school
Called you by your first name, you were so cool
You used to tell me everything I know from youth till I grown
So why you waiting to tell me how the problems grown
And you died on your birthday
It was my worst day
Call you dad know wish I did it from my first day
Just like my dog 18 with mad cream
Locked out on the drug scene
Had cats from other teams
Hatin', went from juvy hall to willy
In 6 months time Makaveli and Philli
But its hell when everybody's jailed
Gun shots to your back on Valentines Day
I miss you bell, damn

1 - [missjones]
Didn't we almost have it all?
But love was all we had worth giving
The rise with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you made life worth living

[Charli]
Seventeen when I met you
I never bet you would help me bring a life to the world
And bless it yo
I thought we were destined to have our names tattooed
But I guess your depression got the best of you
Stressing you, things gon' work out
Cause we still friends but you choose to murk
When you had many reasons to stay
Suicide ain't the only way, it's the lonely way
Now everybody just left me with death to except
But I still had you, still had my boo
And we was right there at the height of everything
The height of your career I still wear my ring
And you said you wouldn't leave me like everyone else
One bullet took you instead now I dread
Thinking back to the last day I saw you
Picking up the phone to call you
Damn we had it all too

[missjones]
Didn't we almost have it all?
The nights we had until the morning
You know you'll never love like that again
Didn't we almost have it all?

[Charli]
Everybody can relate to loss
Even just a pet, you never forget
Death is the final say but you find a way
And survive keep your memories alive
Yo everybody can relate to loss
Even just a pet, you never forget
Death is the final say but you find a way
And survive keep your memories alive
Sing it with me

[missjones]
Though we're apart it just seems so far
I know in my heart I'll always love you
Though we're apart it just seems so far
I know in my heart I'll always love you

Repeat 1

2 - [missjones]
Though were apart
It seems so far
(Didn't we almost have it all?)
But I know in my heart
I will always love you
(Didn't we almost have it all?)
