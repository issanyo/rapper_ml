Yeah, yeah, yeah
It was bad enough that I live a thug life, shit

Night in and night out, now I'm a clear it out
When I spit outta my mouth, niggas know what I'm about
It's no lookin back, tryin to get out of time to stack
Workin and puttin it in and waitin to get it back
Bloods thick and when money comes that's real phat
In tens and thin and a bitch then look at that

What the deal, wanna know how I feel right now?
Ready to kill motherfuckers and lay niggas down
Fuckin wit niggas that's clown, fuckin wit niggas that's wild
Be lost, can't be found
Be found somewhere drowned, motherfuckers

[Charli Baltimore]
Knock knock who is it?
The fuckin esquisit
Chuck spit for my bitches on federal visits
With the weed that cop smugglin
Baby daddies are not jugglin

Twenty five bitch ride and bitch lie
Cuz real chicks do their bid to wit kids to
And that's murda for real
Bitch thug me, hood niggas lovin me
Gangsta ass touchin me, Chuck

[Caddillac Tah]
Yo, yo
Whenever 'llac hotwire the 'lac
Niggas better get the fire and get the runnin
When the fifth spit gunnin, I'm leavin em numb and shit
Now he can't feel his legs, fifteen minutes away from death
Let us pray
I've been cut, remied up
In the box, the porshe
On the eighteen they ain't thugs but I keep em clean
And dope fiends, off the nine and a half board off they leanin
Whoever think shit don't stink I leave em stinkin
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder

[Black Child]
What, yeah, yeah, nigga
And we don't bang and ball
We burry the bubble and buy another one tommorow
Die motherfucker a head full of hollo's
Close your casket, them basterd in those apollo's
Wanna lock us up, stop our rush
Pop the clutch, split a nigga back like a dutch
That's what's up
Nigga, we still don't give a fuck [echoes out]
