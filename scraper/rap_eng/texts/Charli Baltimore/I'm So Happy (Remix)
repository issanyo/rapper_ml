[Charli Baltimore]
Man you heard of us, murderers

And tims, mitcheness, it's hard to impress this
My ball, rock T's over them vest's
Thuggin when he mashin the ghetto princess and
No question, bag me, baby daddy, future, recruit ya
Any bitch will suit ya, Chuck

And I, keep him right here next to me
My heart, finally got a chance to see
How good lovin can set me free

And you know, when I'm up in the club, I'm poppin the bub
Ain't no second frontin for nothin we gettin it up
And it's all love for niggas that got love for I-N-C
Bossed up in the club, playa ya eyes on me
I be up in the drop-top down, sunk in the seat
Hollerin like "Shorty!"
We holler like "Whoooaaa!"
Why don't you ride wit us
It ain't nothin but a G thing that's what's up
We gettin it crunk, and the bars on us
I got like twelve bottles I swipe the theives up
And ya you can't stand it, Chuck the red bandit
