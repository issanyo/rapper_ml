[Ja Rule]
Yeah, yeah, heh
You feel that
Can you feel that
Yall can't feel that, heh, yeah
We gonna do it like this
Real old school, shit
Take them back to the parks and shit
Do it like, we used to do it, you know
DJ Irv days, and shit

[Chorus]
Lets all get high, get out, feel free tonight
Temptations, is tempting
To have the time of your life
Lets all get high, get out, feel free tonight
Temptations, is tempting
To have the time of your life

[Ja Rule]
Come on y'all, tonight somebody sho nuff
Gon' tear the club the fuck up as soon as I hit the scene
All eyes on us, mean, and so vicious
A good nigga, bad intentions
Not to mention, them 12 engine benzes with fish lenses
We park right out front
To handle our business
The broads on the way in
Showin a little attention
Like, i fucked before but ain't never call
Thats life you either love to live it
Or just live it, i live it to the limit
Champaigne finish gangsta
Image, platinum shades swingin
Then i do that 2 step that niggas do
We dont really dance
We just rub the dick on the ass
And fill the glass with nothin but ??
And if they pop it gettin the poppin with me
Get my niggas tonight baby, lets partaay!

[Chorus]

[Charli Baltimore]
Yo, uh
Now a party ain't a party till chuck come through
Bring who? Rolled dolo jeans over Manolo's
Duke says I look better out the photos
And hotter in person, hottest when I'm cursin
Love my bitch thuggelbees
Strokin my ego, then he go
For the bubbly, nigga love me
We go to the vehicle, talk dirty
Past flirty, flight leavin at 5:30
It's hot in herre, foggin the windows
.......
Throw dat, I the designated driver
Chuck never the rider, gotta play
Passenger side beside them, whoa
Gotta be controllin when I'm rollin
Weed niggas swollen, cock blocker
Hands on my knockers, he feelin them poppers
But Chuck never givin it up, livin it up

[Chorus] 1x

[Charli Baltimore]
Uh, Count me and My niggas as OD'in
Rule got a bitch Korean, lap dancin
Off to the murder mansion, ride the shoulder
Benz and the Rover, Nigga we ain't sober
Girl Interrupted, murder got me corrupted
With shots so that any lickin shots with the semi
Out the sunroof of the Bentley
Bottles all empty but niggas got stashes
Never fuckin the glasses

[Ja Rule]
Ha, You know the Rule roll up in the party
Me and Charli, Ready to have them hotties
Rub up on my body, cuz after the club
Its the after set, with some pushin a little head
Is always the safe bet, she tell me V twizzy
In the Red Corvette, swervin lanes
?? a little pain and say what's my name, Rule Baby!
You know it, now lets get high
Take a ride with me tonight, yea

(Chorus) 3x

We gotta give a dance to this shit here ha-ha

Uh Murder Inc shit
Heh, yea Rule baby
Chuck B-More, its a family affair
Can you feel it, can you feel it
You can't feel it, heh
TEMPTATIONS!

(Chorus) 1x

Come On Yall!
