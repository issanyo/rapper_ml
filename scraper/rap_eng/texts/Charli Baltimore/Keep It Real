[Intro - Cam'ron]
Yo, you punk motherfucker! I get to fuckin' curse again!
Y'all niggas can suck my dick! I don't give a fuck about none of you niggas!
Cam'ron, nigga! I'm with Charli Baltimore, we about to let y'all know the fuckin' deal!

[Verse 1 - Cam'ron]
Check it out.. I'm on water like the navy, baby
Everything is gravy, da ladies, dusted off the AB
Cam got a ill swore, how the fuck they put a thug up a billboard?
My spot you kill for, but I kill myself before I let you take it
Cause I buy another pie and it's so great to bake it
And when I flip that you won't see me, no more
Less it's on TV with CB and no 4
Straight bone crushers, the diamonds to custards
Did it all baby, R. Kelly down to Usher!
A Cam is a hustler, I know you think a top meal
Fuck all these records, I'm worrying about Glock sales
I put the ham in hocks, lamb in chops
You are all what Cam is not - mm! - god damn I'm hot!
So girl just, follow procedures, call me Bill Clinton now
Swallow the leader!

[Chorus - Charli Baltimore]
You can keep it real if you wanna, turn to the steel if you wanna
I show you what the deal if you wanna
Bring it to your clique if you wanna, to your chicks if you wanna
Where my niggas, how you want it?
You can keep it real if you wanna, turn to the steel if you wanna
I show you what the deal if you wanna
Bring it to your clique if you wanna, to your chicks if you wanna
Where my niggas, how you want it?

[Verse 2 - Charli Baltimore]
Why should I remain nameless?
You done boned 50 stars and ain't famous, like Tellors, I'm shameless!
Rhyme flows at your veins, can't curse on this?
Commercialness, hmm.. y'all punks kiss the anus!
The Unter-Untertainment, and he ain't got the faintest
I write 'til I'm brainless, but shine 'til I'm stainless
Think that be painless, like Kevorkians
Done cats like a scorpion, 'til Un brought me in!
Now I'm tours be in, spots no wars be in
My gorgeous men, they scores to 10 (you see em!)
A E-M backwards and me, rippin BMs
And stay low key and wit' out the rolly in
All wit control bein', rap moguls
Turn off the beat, marinate with the vocals
And y'all local, I'm worldwide all stations
Rapping sales total worldwide populations

[Chorus - Charli Baltimore]
You can keep it real if you wanna, turn to the steel if you wanna
I show you what the deal if you wanna
Bring it to your clique if you wanna, to your chicks if you wanna
Where my niggas, how you want it?
You can keep it real if you wanna, turn to the steel if you wanna
I show you what the deal if you wanna
Bring it to your clique if you wanna, to your chicks if you wanna
Where my niggas, how you want it?

[Interlude]
Don't mean a thing, if you ain't got no wings
True dat, true dat true dat - ex-angels
Who dat, who dat who dat - Untertainment
New jack, new jack new jacks - ever fall off?
Screw dat, screw dat screw dat - watch your back!

[Verse 2 - Charli Baltimore]
How we flow flow (uh!) is cray-crazy (what?)
Charli in slow mo, and a homo
And when it's time to pay me baby, before the show end
Y'all be so oh-so-impressed where y'all dough went
Still go-going, y'all ain't know-know (what?)
'fore the love or what, what was promo?
Stayed on the low-low, now I'm debuting
Grabbed every taunt in, everybody want in
Cats was fronting, now Baltimore's something
L's for this wealth, try to down me, get from round me!

[Chorus - Charli Baltimore]
You can keep it real if you wanna, turn to the steel if you wanna
I show you what the deal if you wanna
Bring it to your clique if you wanna, to your chicks if you wanna
Where my niggas, how you want it?
You can keep it real if you wanna, turn to the steel if you wanna
I show you what the deal if you wanna
Bring it to your clique if you wanna, to your chicks if you wanna
Where my niggas, how you want it?
You can keep it real if you wanna, turn to the steel if you wanna
I show you what the deal if you wanna
Bring it to your clique if you wanna, to your chicks if you wanna
Where my niggas, how you want it?
You can keep it real if you wanna, turn to the steel if you wanna
I show you what the deal if you wanna
Bring it to your clique if you wanna, to your chicks if you wanna
Where my niggas, how you want it?
