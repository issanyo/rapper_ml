[Cam'Ron]
Yo, all my rhymes - I rip it; the song had to clip it
The cats in the street, nearly killing over snippets
Birds gotta feed 'em bread, so he can eat her head
I'm almost 21, but I still pee in the bed
Had to flead the FED's, all be trife
And I got a crush on Edith (who, Archie's wife!)
Yo not monagomy, pornograhy
On the outside, like an apostrophe
Tell my girls, I really like photography
Snap shots naked, the wildest boss
First night, head whop, and our salads tossed
While you in a mean Neon, I'm with Celine Dion
Throw her in the bed, she the next one I pee on

Say what bitch
Phase two
Yeah yeah
What what what
What what
What what what
What what what
What what what
Split that ass yo
Split that ass
Yeah uh, what
Yo yo yo

[Noreaga]
Yo, N-O-R-E; fuck y'all, niggas get hurt
You know I rock a Soul Train wit' a Cam'Ron's shirt
Doin' cartwheels, all my niggas got Hot Wheels
You a double A-R god, the bluntiest
You know we throw away, blunts for my niggas that's dead
Pour a Law Liqour, drink a long ligga
Then again I never beat, for my nigga Digga
You know I got, navigators, so we won't get lost
N-O-R-E, these Queens niggas call me the Force
At the arraignment, Thugged Out
Undertainment, for the lawyer - fuck 'em and the judge saves it
And I - did every crime - nigga name it

[Charli Baltimore]
Fools ain't ever know, the ghetto's be the baddest click
Charli's Angels, tangle with Devil's - Advocate
Hoes mad cause our pussy's got the fattest clits
It's some status shit, how we gon' have a bitch
Under pressure, the Un undress her
That's a tester, that's just the best flirt, to the best skirt
Ever make it to networks
Like N.B.C., N.O.R.E., B'More and Cam'Ron
Anything we put our hands on, soak up like a tampon, plan on
For puttin' out the hottest LP's
Since - shiiit yo, you gon' have to tell me
Cause this is hip hop, ménage à trois
And ya'll jealous cause what I'm fuckin' wit' the two hottest
Underground fellas, what!

Chorus (Noreaga, Baltimore, Cam'Ron)

Aiyyo Iraq, Harlem World, Philly, San Juan
Un-shit; N.O.R.E., Charli, Cam'Ron
Mansions, 6's, Richies, plan on
Cali, Houston, New York, jam on
Aiyyo Iraq, Harlem World, Philly, San Juan
Un-shit; N.O.R.E., Charli, Cam'Ron
Atlanta, Chi-Town, V.A., plan on
D.C., N.C., S.C., jam on

[Charli]
What!

[Cam'Ron]
Yo, all on the ballers shit
Nore, but we could call a chick
Head is what we all could get, biggest to the smallest dick
She gon' swallow all of it
Harlem gon' have a ball with it
After I get her credit, yo we goin' to the mall with it

[Noreaga]
Yeah nigga, you know the lie, fuck that bitch
The only reason I don't kiss her, is cause she sucked his dick
And I don't even trust, ourself bro, fuck dat ho
Pussy stinkin' anyway, let her go

[Charli Baltimore]
Yo ya'll niggas stay fuckin' with them grimmy chicks
On the real though, I wonder where ya'll find these chicks
West Haven it , I'm the type to split on niggas
But if they right, I'll fuck around and spit on niggas
And if they into that hot shit, I might let 'em hit my spot quick
But first they gotta pop shit
If not then they gettin' drop kicked
And I like 'em all, Black Jack ya'll
Near 21, all others gettin' cut cut
So be it, you see me!

Chorus (Noreaga, Baltimore, Cam'Ron)

Aiyyo Iraq, Harlem World, Philly, San Juan
Un-shit, N.O.R.E., Charli, Cam'Ron
Mansions, 6's, Richies, plan on

Aye yo Iraq, Harlem World, Philly, San Juan
Un-shit, N.O.R.E., Charli, Cam'Ron
