[Ghostface]
Be friends wit'cha gram!

I want everyone to stand up and be counted tonight

Hey you, blow your whistle (whistle sound)
Now clap ya hands and say yeah! (yeah)

[Ghostface]
Tune my voice up, tune my mic up
Tune my voice up, tune my mic up
Yo, this is how we rock
This is how we rock
This is how we rock, rock

Hey you, blow your whistle (whistle sound)

[Ghostface]
Yeah, we in the joint yo
We in the joint
Hey yo, hey, yeah, scream

Hey now, I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
(Ah shit!)
I want everyone to stand up and be counted tonight
(Stand up, yeah)
Brothers and sisters, if you know you've got your thing together
(Put your muthafuckin' hand in the air)
I want you to stand on up!
Now I got something to tell ya
(Swing it from left to right)
I'll tell you, now that I think about it
(Yeah)
And now I wanna tell ya how to get your thing together
(Play with this, you can't play with this)
Come on now, get a groove going
(Uh)

Yeah

Hey you, blow your whistle (whistle sound)

[Charli]
Yo, yo, yo
Yo Tony, what up?
Heard your dick was good

[Ghostface]
You should know, yo I fucked you on the side of my hood

[Charli]
Never that dawg
From where you can never hit it
Throw a razor in my mouth on the low
And suck ya dick wit' it

[Ghostface]
The world famous, priceless, steel stainless dick
Pray over this, sculpture of love, name this
Heavyweight dick in ya jaw
Good lickin' from ya lips, now babygirl throw the song

[Charli]
Yo, yo, yo
Aye yo Tony, you phoney
We both signed to Sony
But for half ya pub, ride that dick like a Pony, what

[Ghostface]
Yeah, what, put your money on my dick
Girls, all eyes on my dick

[Charli]
Yo, yo, yo
Cats fatigued out, thinkin' they armies
My crew arms me with beats, how we swarm bee?
Who bang?, B'More and Wu Tang, new thang
Mad at how we do thangs, RZA copped me two fangs
Official, now I bite through gristle
Gold teeth style in from Philly to Staten Island
While in the meantime, spit mean lines
Fuck clean rhymes, like mine's grimmy
Like my niggas be
Picture me, coming off soft
Ya'll just cough up shit, I swallow rhymes
Makin' bitches swallow 9's, re-define
This rap shit, make my shit a classic
Like Beethoven, stay posin'
For the camera, stamina
Like a crackhead, and crackheads are amateurs
You try me, no in-between like Y to Z
Pick brains like labotomies
Still thoughts to charts of Billboard's
Throw pour ill spores, leave niggsa stiff like still-born's

I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
(What, what, what)
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
(Stand up baby, stand up baby)
Brothers and sisters, if you know you've got your thing together
I want you to stand on up!
(Stand up yo)
Now I got something to tell ya
I'll tell you, now that I think about it
(Yeah, what, what, what)
And now I wanna tell ya how to get your thing together

[Ghostface]
I'm like Spider-Man, fifth brother up in the Clan
Drop like crack that's scattered all up in ya van
Skelly-man crook, character star
In Donald Goines book
MGM, Heaven and Hell, sat with the cook
With the big spice bone, red hairs is killin' it
Knotted up, twisted and green
See them crystals in it?
Rap Yogi Berra
Bear hug and five hundered ounce of that Staision
Wild man, Sarah
Rush after hours, Alfred in the Batcave
Hands like Dai Smith, rap Hagler with a fade
Magilla, Charli Baltimore witch hazel drip from your drawers,when faced off with the Killah
Stood still, a whole river chill
Looked up, it got dark, that's when RZA started to build

Hey yeah!
I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
Hey yeah!
I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up

Hey you, blow your whistle (whistle sound)

[Charli]
What, what, what, what!

[Ghostface]
Aye yo, you praise me, turtleneck nigga rockin' Paisley
Shots crazily, steady blazin' where the spades be
Teams like Starsky and Hutch, Super deluxe truck
Ya bankrupt, 52's Knox, I heard you Ku Klux, damn
Tear it out the van, sweat it with a tan
Wicked like Remo spray can, Sugar Duran
Fuck a cocktail, get my balls licked in Hell
Read his Igloo Tales, hell all the dogs with broken tails
Salt range, Salt-Water taff
Ironman, bubble bath, nucleus, split the atom in half
Meet damoes, fifth brother bug inside 8 pole
Change though, crush the birds inside shrimp rolls

[Charli]
Rap Conspiracy, hold songs for ransom
Lancin' in Ghostmode, coke mixed with Branson
Sheisty, tree's soaked in half-ki's
Sabotage N.Y. with snipe's and 79's
Channel 9's scene street team made news with who's
Charli, every 16 bars be
Sickening, peep the scription
Rhyme vixen
Keep the clips in tact, watch ya back
Ain't done yet, ain't spun yet
Poison web is
Spider-Woman, two legged, how we did it
What!

Come on and get a groove goin'!

Hey you, blow your whistle (whistle sound)
Hey you, blow your whistle (whistle sound)

Now clap your hands and say yeah

Yeah....

Now let me count it off
1.. 2... 3

Hey
Hey, hey, hey yeah!
I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
