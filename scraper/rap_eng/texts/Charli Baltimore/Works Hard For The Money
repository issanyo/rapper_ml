Uh, uh, uh, uh

Chorus

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
And you better treat her right

Verse One: Charli Baltimore

Whatever you gotta, do for the Prada
On sex, each minute, ten dollars
24 hours, on Beauty Parlors
Poppin' that tower, moves be power
Why ya'll sour, I deals in bragoits
See my thugs just ahppy with Nautica sweats
While I look vexed, these cats get over
Peace to the Rover, who sleep on the sofa
You nine to five, I'm five to nine
Sign dotted line, checks all mine
If ya'll haters wanna courtsy me fine
But I met mills, ya'll ain't worth a dime
Ain't worth my time, curves stay dented
Gotta do a bid, daddy watch the kids
Whatever I did, to get this cash
Did it hard, so spell me out real fast

Chorus

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
And you better treat her right

Verse Two: Charli Baltimore

Yo, yo, honey come, honey go
Money dough, money blow
Where should I begin, cash on end
Believe you me Charli pull no stunts
Jet black six stacks in the trunk
CB in a rut, work hard for the money
Trsut me boo, play hard for the money
Even if it's trippin', hey it's a living
Just make sure them old men is tippin'
Even the ones that be actin' hard
Put my mack down tehn get platnuim cards
Girls pop they four's, even drop they drawz
For the pool, the house and the parcae floors
Wanna take me out, don't need no roll
Impress me baby, my kids need clothes
If even I'm nervous, been out there flirtin'
One things certain, I'm always workin'

Chorus

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
And you better treat her right

Verse Three: Charli Baltimore

Yo I lie for the cash, die for the cash
Only time I'm on E, is when it's class
B fronted, don't Miss Thing lookin' pretty
Oh yeah baby, my bankbook pretty
Roll in a six, took his keys
My man stays at home, he cooks and cleans
While I get big, clockin' fast
He'll watch the kids, I'll watch the stash
And yo you think it's a figure of speech
When I say, I get six figures a week
And all ya'll think, that's ideal
I'm wit' fly wheels, in high heels
In tillin', that mink catch a feelin'
Heights in the billin' building, over seas dealin'
Yo you ain't treatin' me right
It's aight, cause at the end of the night
My money still tight

Chorus

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
And you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
And you better treat her right
