Uh, yeah
Adina
Cam

[Cam'Ron]
Yo, on the P to the R, R-O-N is the bomb
And when we at the bar, I'm gonna show you a star
The way I hop, the way I pop
Hold heat right too
Yo, what you think Adina, I'mma Freak like you
And I'm gearin' TLC, I Creep like you
Leave them panties on ma, I'mma sleep right through
So pull 'em to the side, and pop the Dom
I'm naked wit' my boxers on

[Adina Howard]
Picture this
I'm in my bed
Your body's hot
Soakin' wet
Flowin' with the things I like to do
I'm open minded when it comes to freakin' you
Feelin' me
Well asking me
Between my legs
You're tastin' me
Boy you make it clear, you know my love will over flow
And you ain't got to worry about my clothes

Chorus

I got my T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and my panties
Got my T-shirt and my panties on

[Adina Howard]
To your surprise
Uh, it's tight
Tighter love
You get it right

Bridge

Nothing better (ooh)
Nothing more (mm-hmmm)
Can you feel me?
Baby why don't you just

[Adina Howard]
Take your time
Tonight you're mine
We're gonna turn it out
Hit it from behind
Boy you make it clear, you know my love will over flow
And you ain't got to worry about my clothes

Chorus

I got my T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and my panties
Got my T-shirt and my panties on

Bridge 2

I'm feelin' kinda sexy
Now that we are all alone
(Now that we are all alone)
Baby can we do the nasty
In the privacy of my own home
(Baby come a little closer)
So come a little closer
I am hugged all the time, it's gone
Because tonight is special
I got my T-shit and my panties on

[Charli Baltimore]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
You can come if you want to
I'll make you cum too
Yo, you butt naked, laid out when you come to
Yo, when it comes to sex, none's better
Then a back-shot, head wop, Lex cop a setter rock
Bring ya girlfriend, yo, Chuck's the competetor
Anyone right, you can Demi Moore price
Yeah, let her come daddy
Have Gloria freak it
Cause C. B'More is Victoria Secrets

Bridge 3

Open the door
Take it cause I'm all alone
Got my T-shirt and panties on
Come in before
So when you get home
Got my T-shirt and panties on

I got my T-shirt and panties on! [echo]
