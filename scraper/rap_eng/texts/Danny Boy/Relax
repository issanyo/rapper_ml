Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it
When you wanna
Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it
When you wanna

Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it
When you want to come (come)
Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it
When you want to (come)

Relax, relax
(die die die die)

[Verse: Danny Boy]
Uh-huh, yeah, now, come on
Yo, bombs is dropping
Heads are clocking
?? rocking some
And it ain't no stopping
I'll tell you now, kid, we don't play
I'm up all night, sleep all day
So ease back, kid, you're playing me close
I gotta calm Desert Eagle and it's fitted with scopes
So let me know if you want to step to it
And holler at me when you're ready to do it
Relax

Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it
When you want to (come)
Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it
When you want to come

Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it
When you want to (come)
Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it

When you wanna go
When you wanna go
When you wanna go
When you wanna go
