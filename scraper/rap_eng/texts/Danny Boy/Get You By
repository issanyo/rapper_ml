[Intro: Slaine]
This is a movement; a real movement.(La Coka Nostra)
You motherfuckers talk like you a movement but none of yous are moving

[Verse 1: Slaine]
I walk the hills, I had to climb with these legs of my own
My hard days and dark nights put my head in the zone
Hustled for blood money, left my wife pregnant at home
We're on the television, everyone's regularly stoned
I flash back to a 70's song in a Volare with mom
Picture the future seeing everything gone
My wife is asking me, "Is anything wrong??
I tell her, "Erica, everything is. You better be strong."
America, where I was born, city blocks are where I was raised
I seed from the land of the greed, home of the craze
I never run, I'm unafraid, I'm known to be brave
Till my bitch dig me a ditch and she stone me a grave
Seven weeks in utero, you grow and don't be a slave
Just build your hunger and your power from your loneliest days
There were many before me who molded me and showed me the way
But I'm my own man, there's nobody that told me to say what I

[Hook x2]
Hate will fuel your rage
Drugs will get you high
Money buys respect
Love will get you by


[Verse 2: Everlast]
It's the Highland Samurai with the violent devil eye
Semper Fi qualified, sing your ass a lullaby
Rockaby, do or die, true Jedi status
You wanna learn to skywalk? Bitch come get at us
Dolomite, cenobite, canonite, fahrenheit, satellite
Mr. White got a light, do the right from your seeds to the block
Trooper with the future shock
Fumigate the paradox, illuminate the orthodox

[Danny Boy]
I feel the devil in my eyes, I see em in Hell next
I sniff and I sell death, walking up twelve steps
I live rock bottom with bitches that sell sex
This ice cold world has got me vicious and selfish

[Everlast]
Danny Man got a plan, Taliban outta hand
Pakistan to Japan, Darvocet, Percodan
Over stand fifty grand, Krugerrand who's the man?
Dapper Dan, Uncle Sam, bitch he never gave a damn

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
I walk amongst the reptilians and leather-skinned aliens
On inner-stellar chariots, post-apocalyptic gladiators
My electrons are Teflon, my protons are Tech Nines
My neutrons will shoot your motherfucking heads gone
They form molecules that move like death squads
That kidnap American tourists and make bombs
Standing at the gates of Heaven waiting to face God
Take part in criminology like Raekwon
We those killers that don't blink
The world's mostly billions that don't think
Controlled by the Skull And Bones triple six
Listen kid, the day the nuclear missile hit
Where were you? Probably taking a shit
While the sky hailed mountain-sized comets
And planet-shattering lightning
Gigantic fragments of ice like what the Titanic collided with
Society is not civilization, technology is Satan
In the hands of devil worshipers that praise him

[Hook x2]
