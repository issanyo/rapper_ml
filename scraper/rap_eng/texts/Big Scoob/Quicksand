[Intro: Big Scoob]
Yeah
The homie Don P called the big fella in to talk about this repetitive ass cycle that we livin' in the hood
No matter how much we struggle, how much we fight
It seems like the perpetual quicksand is always grabbing us and pulling us back down
So I'm not here to play the victim or no shit like that you know what I mean
But with that being said

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
If a pussy run his mouth about yo boy I'ma sock him
Hang a chopper out the window of the low, get to choppin'
Mind frame of a slave in the days of pickin' cotton
Only difference nowadays your favorite rappers say it's poppin'
Pushin' product to my people, living evil for the profit
Stay hungry, gotta get it any means, that's my logic
Who gives a fuck about destruction, who I'm crushin' for this dollar
Hard times make me holler, gots to get up out this squalor
Push a cherry red Impala with these cherry Chucks on
Who gives a fuck what you think of me, let it be known
So proud of my pedigree, strong as King Kong
Until the last breath of me, this the shit I'm on
Mind frame of a soldier, I'm at war with my people
Wicked teachings from these demons planted deep in my cerebral
Yet I'm smart enough to know it but the knowledge ain't enough
To get the fuck up out of here I gotta get above quicksand

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I ain't never been a quitter, they don't come no realer
I'ma stand up nigga, quicksand
As long as I'm livin' all I know is go get it
Ain't no fucks given, quicksand
I'm in too deep, no turnin' back now
I'm playin' for keeps, quicksand
I ain't had no sleep, I am these gutters, I am these streets

[Verse 2: Godemis]
I pray for anyone living under duress to be blessed
Created to be free ain't no reason to see any less
I peep the social media leading to giving me stress
The black lives matter is really a lot of BS
Could we just attempt to be honest with one another
Talk about the kid you know with no father who got a mother
Older brother was a positive figure in the community
Who caught a case and ended up wasting his opportunity
As soon as we get real with the will to address the evil
It becomes crystal clear every one of us still inequal
Don't believe in any system they say was made to defeat you
If any of it matters at all it has to be fecal
I've had it up to here about the talk about reparations
We need to steer the focus on getting some education
They say it's the white people hating, they ain't attacking you
Nobody black is packing up tryna go back to Africa
Facts

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I ain't never been a quitter, they don't come no realer
I'ma stand up nigga, quicksand
As long as I'm livin' all I know is go get it
Ain't no fucks given, quicksand
I'm in too deep, no turnin' back now
I'm playin' for keeps, quicksand
I ain't had no sleep, I am these gutters, I am these streets

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
Yup
They in the trap now
I said them backyard niggas don't back down
They used to bend a couple corners with the straps out
They got a short fuse, they act out
Got lean, got dope, got the packs now
All day in and out up out the crack house
Got to worry about the law, and the money, and the bitches
No love for the game, nigga everybody snitchin'
What's real

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I ain't never been a quitter, they don't come no realer
I'ma stand up nigga, quicksand
As long as I'm livin' all I know is go get it
Ain't no fucks given, quicksand
I'm in too deep, no turnin' back now
I'm playin' for keeps, quicksand
I ain't had no sleep, I am these gutters, I am these streets
