[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Who dat?
Say they goin' through dat
I'm hustlin' for real, to get my cash grip, true dat
It's killing my nerves, what I deserve's
Many dollars to splurge, some people follow my words
Still I talk slur
First to get drunk cause I lack it all time
I'm slammin' my liquor, my young nigga's still cryin'
Hollin' 'bout, "Huh? Daddy, wuh? Son, I was stuck, daddy was
Full of that E"

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Strugglin' tryin' get your paper right
Make you wanna pull a caper, right?
You get your money but a hater might
Stop you from rollin', pull up and straight put out your scraper lights
1 million sold independently
Tech N9ne, Strange Music, did it splendidly
Didn't pretend to be, anybody else in this industry
I blended the, gangster rap rockin' with tremendous energy
But when the money comes, yeah everybody's honeybunned
Funny ones runnin' come bum from me like
"Tech, can you front me some?"
And they don't know responsibilities that you got
All of the families that I support
All of the others causin a nigga to pop
On top of all that, when you make that shit
The IRS, spot your money and then they take that shit
You make the cake that split
Instead of honesty, I should have took that lick
Run up in the bank with strength and whoop that trick
Cause momma really needs homecare
But without Medicaid, no better days, pay your own fare
No assistance on there
I see the bigger picture
The government is fuckin' all of us, soon as you get your paper them motherfuckers hit ya

[Chorus: Uncredited Woman and  Krizz Kaliko]
Oh, man, I'm strugglin' but a setback happens every time
Gain green,  Getcha money, mayne
Gain green
Oh, man, I'm strugglin' but a setback happens every time
Gain green,  Getcha money, mayne
Gain green

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Back at it, it's the Show Me Homie givin' the spit
Had to fall back, the town is hot, I chill with the Yicks
Federation, infiltration, pussies flappin' they lips
If they comin', I ain't runnin', Imma get em these flips
Blood is savage, but the cabbage ain't fakin' with mine
Bout that paper, on my maker, I'm addicted to grind
With that grind there be setbacks, that's part of the game
If you fall nigga, then bounce back as hard as you cane
Fight the storm and push it hard and even harder in rain
Use your pain if you the hungerest, be bargin' the aim
I can see this boy, I've been there, and it's on me again
So I reach out to the best out, nigga messy and strange
Check my history, no mysteries, a hustler for mine
I'm a dog and dog will hunt so Imma get it every time
In the kitchen, y'all already know I'm whippin' up lines
In fact I'm winnin' with these kind of murder, heat every time

[Chorus: Uncredited Woman and  Krizz Kaliko]
Oh, man, I'm strugglin' but a setback happens every time
Gain green,  Getcha money, mayne
Gain green
Oh, man, I'm strugglin' but a setback happens every time
Gain green,  Getcha money, mayne
Gain green

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I used to sell pieces, but I never had a piece of mine
Piece for the cheese, so I had to find a way to grind
Way to round, or a way around it
Head in the clouds but I'm grounded
Find a way around it
Founded up my dead Jeffersons, evident
I need more precedence, said the presidents
Niggas get paid off saying clever shit
I'm the definition of what you never did
You gain green, I'm get colored money off in the Netherlands
Now I'm breaking bread with executives
Papers what I expect from this
Check his respect, saying Kali got a knack for this
Actually it's a game, gain green, that's my aim
Tryin' to get paid off Messy Marv's thang
KC and the Bay respect they stay connect
Hate reject, you pay for that
And even though Dre left, he still get a paycheck
And we on the same team, out for the same thing
My niggas is Regime, tryin' to gain green

[Chorus: Uncredited Woman and  Krizz Kaliko]
Oh, man, I'm strugglin' but a setback happens every time
Gain green,  Getcha money, mayne
Gain green
Oh, man, I'm strugglin' but a setback happens every time
Gain green,  Getcha money, mayne
Gain green

[Outro: Big Scoob]
Yeah, get your money mayne
That was right, Tech, Tech, that's what I'm talkin' about
That one's for the boy, boy Young Masta
All the way from the K to the Bay
We all connected, you dig
It's for the Young Thunders
When they get full of that kush
You know what I mean
This that real shit, that gutter butter, mayne
