[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Well uhh yeah
This is Energetik
Big Scoob, E-40 and Kendrick Lamar
Kali Baby!

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooooh
I stay on my toes, never caught digging in my nose
With my [?] delivery
[?] flows
I'm old school like [?] Vaults
Hundred Thousand units sold independantly we call it Ghetto Gold
I'm allergic to suckas achoo like I got a cold
And I don't hang around bustas like you, you's a hoe
You's a cub, I'm lion!
Why y'all always be trynna throw rocks at a giant?
Let me rewind it and define it
Pay hommage to KRS-One, Criminal Minded
OG [?] desperado like the bike club
I'm almost finished with this jug
[?] out of my body [?] me and my nigga at once
Talking loud in the hotel lobby
[?] hella sloppy
My brain's hella clouded, BITCH!

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Yeah, Big homie from the Show Me all you niggas know me
Run up on me, Nakatomi from the peperoni (Brrrrat)
Keep it on me lil homie, I ain't dinner time
Pump your brakes stop and think 'fore you fuck with mine
HOG niggas, HOG ways, get it always
From the burner to the [?] now I'm on the stage
Energetik, old nigga on the paper chase
Do it my way, fuck what you niggas say
[?] authentic boy, I come to get it
No mimic, no gimmick, causin' pandemic
Epidemic: I invented what your man winnin'
Spitting venom watch me kill him when the venom hit him
[?] Killer City reppin' for the Villies
Five Block, so you know I brought the Fifties with me
[?] got me actin' wild
Aggravated for the paper I be showing out

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, back on the block with it
Back when I had worn my cousin’s shoes with holes and socks in it
Eatin' top rhymin', walk to school with a prepaid cellular
Crackheads tried to sell me a stolen Sox fitted
I tend to look at my upbringing a lot different
From where I’m at I inform you like Armonax that I’m two levels of terrific
Ya dumb bitch
We in yo hood with the transmissons, ya dumb bitch. Yee!
See this is Compton at its best, your four-o
And I’m loco as an esé with a fo-loco
And I stay local, I’m from the soil
Come from the bottom like the earth’s oil
Meet your SIHI at the coffee table
All that tough talking just telling me you poyo
I’m a rare breed, high off life without a gram of weed
Kendrick Lamar, a block off palma leaves
Sip the same palmasa my uncle put me on
This is me!

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik
