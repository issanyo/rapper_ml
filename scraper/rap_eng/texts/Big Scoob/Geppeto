[Hook 1]
Geppeto, Geppeto, Geppeto
Straight from the ghetto, pull strings (Geppeto)
Boss dog, call me boss, hoe, who am I? (Geppeto)
No soft, I'm so raw, who am I? (Geppeto)
Jack Frost, I'm so sauced, who am I? (Geppeto)
Straight from the ghetto, pull strings (Geppeto)
Push buttons, don't touch nothin', I'm a boss (Geppeto)
Push a man, push it all, man, get it off (Geppeto)
Hella game in the mind frame, this toast (Geppeto)
Straight from the ghetto, pull strings (Geppeto)

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
String pull, I feed the wolves, I'm making sure that we eat, nigga
Boss dog, I play cold, don't fuck around in these streets, nigga
Five block, I'm a beast, nigga
Runnin' wild on these beats, nigga
Wildin' out in these streets, nigga
Either way, it's for keeps, nigga
Young gunners, extreme thunder
In motion on my word
Hundred rounders, them drum pounders
Don't act like you ain't heard
Big fella, real peaceful though
Layin' low and I'm gettin' dough
Stayin' ready for the creed or code
If you want it, here we go

[Hook 2]
Geppeto, Geppeto, Geppeto

Scared money, don't eat, nigga, I feast (Geppeto)
Greedy nigga, need two spoons when I eat (Geppeto)
Too late, no turn arounds, I'm deep (Geppeto)
Straight from the ghetto, pull strings (Geppeto)
Gutted butter like a motherfucker, this heat (Geppeto)
You squared up, old sucker niggas can't peep (Geppeto)
Tied to it, I only do it for the streets (Geppeto)
Straight from the ghetto, pull strings (Geppeto)

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Aggressive, expressive, matches my blessin' (uh-huh)
Smith and Wesson, that's the protection (50-cal-wow)
Puffin' a stogie, pitchin' the package (underhanded)
Wrist is terrific, it's like it's magic (understand it)
Live and die by this street shit
H.O.G. ass on a steep cliff
Bangin' gears and I'm hugging curves
Runnin' laps on you fucking nerds
Sheep niggas, y'all moving herds
Pinocchios, you niggas scared
Fall back and let's go get it
Show you what to do with it

[Hook 3]
Geppeto, Geppeto, Geppeto
Straight from the ghetto, pull strings (Geppeto)
Aggressive, expressive, matches my blessin' (Geppeto)
Smith and Wesson, that's the protection (Geppeto)
Puffin the stogie, pitchin' the package (Geppeto)
Straight from the ghetto, pull strings (Geppeto)
Hustle got hustle, I'm trynna double (Geppeto)
Hundreds and fifties stuffed in the duffle (Geppeto)
Go get her, I get it up in the struggle (Geppeto)
Straight from the ghetto, pull strings (Geppeto)
