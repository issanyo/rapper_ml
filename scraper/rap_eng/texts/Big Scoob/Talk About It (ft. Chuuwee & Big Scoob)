Get off right here, this is the stop make a left
From Compton to the Ilin, I deserve my respect
I can walk through any block without a pistol or a vest
Because I’m the one they bumpin’, they be chunking up the set
Niggers ask me where I’m from and I respond with ‘the west’
I ain't never been scary I ain't never been impressed
I ain't tryin be the hardest, I ain't tryin be the best
I am trying to make a living, a nigga trying to invest
All I know is git it, just spin it and flip digits
This is legit business, I was never in the kitchen
I was broke beside……. Around the city with my niggers
We were scratching for a dollar, this is …………
We ain't like the party, we were trying to fuck bitches
All we do is kick it and talk about getting riches
Black talk digits, put money behind the image
If I said it than I did it, if I mean it than I win it

Chorus (2x)
I you want it we can talk about it, Cause you don’t want it
Everybody want to talk about it
But they don’t know it, they like how we lay it down
I’m high when I face the crowd, the weapons gonna stay around
My niggas don’t play around

(Chuuwee)
All my life
All I wanted was drugs, money and power
Puerto Rican freak that be taking too long showers
The yellow bomb Asian that come from a foreign isle
A very long reign, the king of my own crowd
Yeah, I got these dreads that I wear as my own crown
Treat snakes like the grass, they in …………
Put some respect on my name, and don’t address me as general
Call a pall, bitch have a coconut smile
Bow, bow owowow dog, you bow down
I’ll jog you world star, I’ll block you little clowns
Keep my motherfucking legacy far away from your mouth
You rarely leave the house and already know what I’m about
Now, shout block up calling the plays now
These worried niggers got played out, they out a stow
A jab straight, one left hook, he laid down
Ran through his pockets, I’m tryin to get paid now

Chorus (2x)

(Big Scoob)
I been on, fuck a record deal, know what I’m talking bout?
Fuck a record label, I got skills, know what I’m talking bout?
You rap fans, I know you just missed what I’m talking bout
But street niggers, they know how it feel what I’m talking bout
Watch your mouth, pussies will be killed for what they talking bout
Doggy mound, showing daddie’s real, now what I’m talking bout?
Walk about, on a journey, tryin to find my soul
Tryin to fill this dark hole, just to fight the road I chose
No regrets no excuses, damn sure……………
I’m an unfinished painting, and tryin to find what truth is
I’m a house, but I’m ruthless
I’m a gutter nigga that’s roofless
Bang the walls with my two fist
To tell me where proof is
The truth is, we all lost in this motherfucker
Tryin to ……. One another, like we’re better than our brothers
So I glorify the street shit, gangbanging the dope pussy
Tryin to find a better life but this was it when I was it

Chorus 2x
