[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Struggle make you humble as a motherfucka, hungry as a motherfucka
Perception is a bitch but the truth is a motherfucka
Tired of you motherfuckas, tired as a motherfucka
Ready to load a clip and get to bustin' in this motherfucka
Lately I've been on some other type of shit
Tryin' to find some light in this, searchin' for enlighten-shit
Exorcising demons every evening I been fighting with
Yard full of broken bottles, fighting not to take a swallow
Fully loaded clip I'm 'bout to flip and get to dumpin' hollows
Now everybody excited and I'm ready I'ma die to win
Head first I'm diving in, anybody fuck a friend
A word with no meanin', so I'm plottin' and I'm schemin'
I'm so done with this dreamin', dyin' slow and barely breathing
Ain't no future in this bullshit, rappin' or the street life
Carvin' my intestines, and deception is the dull knife
Switchin' my direction want perfection and a new life

[Chorus: Big Scoob]
High prices on the blow (let go)
So it's hard to get dough (let go)
Tried to run up in my pad
Trying to hit me for my cash
So I thum-thum-thum (had to let go)
Sick and tired of this shit (let go)
Old homie turned snitch (let go)
Homies brought it to the light
Redded all in black and white like oh no (had to let go)

[Verse 2: Darrein Safron]
G shit my jeans ripped
My homies hold double XL magazine clip
The heat spit like loose teeth
The kid kick like Bruce Lee
Y'all false as Bloods that bleed Crip on that weak shit
I'm 2-3 ballin' but I peep shit
This for anybody that say that I'm on some sweet shit
This is for the Darrein is just too R&B shit
This one for the money cause y'all always on some free shit
I'm from the city with a system of poverty
I've seen my homies go from ride or die to a rivalry
I've seen these hoes loyalty turn into a robbery
Like God can you please bless these hoes with more honesty
But trust me I tried it before
They say my city on fire like the devil home
I been talkin' to God he don't hear me though
Sometimes I just wonder should I let it go

[Chorus: Big Scoob]
High prices on the blow (let go)
So it's hard to get dough (let go)
Tried to run up in my pad
Trying to hit me for my cash
So I thum-thum-thum (had to let go)
Sick and tired of this shit (let go)
Old homie turned snitch (let go)
Homies brought it to the light
Redded all in black and white like oh no (had to let go)

[Verse 3: Tech  N9ne]
Everybody hungry
Every night we on three
Aaron fight the Fahrenheit of very trifling homies
When they staring right before me like they care but they parasites and only
Wanna rare bite of millionaire Rice-A-Roni!
On yo nose, the flare light is there like a Hongi
Lead your layered life to lonely
Nigga you best leave my premises
You don't wanna be my nemesis
I'ma put it on the B.I.B.L.E. (Die!)
Then I read my Genesis
Nigga I train and I train for when they aim for my change
At the range ain't a thang they know my name and it's Strange
Leave your brains on the terrain dead if he came for the games
Not to explain but me and my dame keep a thang and it bangs! Ekk ket ket ket ket ket pooh pooh pdddit nigga
Taking the living to necro
They never knew Missouri killas would be hillbillies like Jethro Bodine, slept slow, codeine I'm so mean like Destro
And I got the green like a gecko
And I'ma never let go of it

[Chorus: Big Scoob]
High prices on the blow (let go)
So it's hard to get dough (let go)
Tried to run up in my pad
Trying to hit me for my cash
So I thum-thum-thum (had to let go)
Sick and tired of this shit (let go)
Old homie turned snitch (let go)
Homies brought it to the light
Redded all in black and white like oh no (had to let go)
