[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Pushing pounds by the thousands, feel me?
Bread counting for hours, hear me?
Real niggas no cowards near me
Real life, no acting in me
Sipping liquor, I'm tripping bro
Told you niggas like years ago
Showed you niggas no fear in bro
I'm papered up but I still a go
I'm getting older, I'm supposta to grow
Got the message but fuck it though
Head to Texas and grab some blow
It's bullshit but it's still a go
Push it nigga, I push it man
Stop and grab some rubber bands
Enough to rap a hundred bands
Man I love this gutter dance

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I won't ease up till my G's up, that's all that I know
I won't freeze up when that piece up, I'll reap what I sow
I don't sleep enough and can't drink enough, it's all getting old
If I ease up or I freeze up, that's all that she wrote

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Soil living, I'm from the mud
Block nigga that's were I'm loved
FTB with a villain twist from 56th and we with the shits
My star is shinning, they watchin' now
Pussies prayin' that they knock me down
Nuts hanging, my cock is out
You even tried but can't stop me now
Gorilla with it, call me King Kong
Boss nigga, my team strong
Caked up and my green long
Villain nigga with a theme song
Can't stop and I won't stop
I won't ease up till my G's up
I won't freeze up if that peace up
I need a peace bruh till I'm peaced what

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I won't ease up till my G's up, that's all that I know
I won't freeze up when that piece up, I'll reap what I sow
I don't sleep enough and can't drink enough, it's all getting old
If I ease up or I freeze up, that's all that she wrote

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
I can't sleep enough, I can't drink enough
I need blinders for these visions
I keep wakin' up and then drankin' up
I'm so blinded by this mission
Poured a full cup, now I'm spillin' liquor
Gives a fuck, I'm like fuck it nigga
Fallin' in places, linin' up
Bread keep coming, it's pilling up
Solo dolo, no pillin' up
Vato, loco when a pile truck
Dumped the truck and then add it up
Keep it pushin', I ain't had enough
Used to dream about tearin' it up
Pen and picture, I was mad as fuck
My gutter dreams and my gutter schemes got me winnin' niggas
You mad or what?

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I won't ease up till my G's up, that's all that I know
I won't freeze up when that piece up, I'll reap what I sow
I don't sleep enough and can't drink enough, it's all getting old
If I ease up or I freeze up, that's all that she wrote
