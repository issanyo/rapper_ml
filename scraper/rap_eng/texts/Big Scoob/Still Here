[Intro: NOWDAZE]
Said a silver lining is getting hard to find, yeah
And the end of the tunnel ain't shining so bright
But I keep on striving every day and night
So when the smoke clears
I'm still right here, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Down back, my path, no cash
But niggas wouldn't know that
No texts, no calls
My back's pressed up against four walls
I ain't say you owe me, act like you don't know me, nigga
Shouldn't have to ask you twice if you my homie, nigga
We been through the trenches together when we was down and out
But money makes niggas change is what I'm finding out
Soon as you sign a deal, next thing you making mills
But I'm still living in the field try'na pay these bills
Niggas thought I got the bag and I've been holding out
But for real I've been down, trapped up in the house
Man my health fucked up
Bills' still piled up
Homies ain't pulled up
Niggas ain't pulled up
Guess I ain't shit now
They know I ain't rich now
Niggas love to see me down
Ain't that a bitch, wow

[Bridge: NOWDAZE]
Said a silver lining is getting hard to find
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the end of the tunnel ain't shining so bright
Feels like I can't see the light
But I keep on striving every day and night (every day)
So when the smoke (when it clears)
I'm still right here (I bet I'm still right here)

[Hook: NOWDAZE]
I'm still right here if you want it (if you want it)
I'm still right here (I said I'm still right here)
I'm still right here if you want it (said I'm still right here)
I'm still right here (I said I'm still right here)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Rise up out them ashes, can't let nothing hurt me
Treat these niggas like they bitches man they all deserve it
My whole world damn near ended, damn near pulled the curtain
My existence feeling distant, trying to find my purpose
So I'm cashing all my favors, need the will of God
If you feel me and you hear me, please help me lord
Got me searching for the answers, who the hell is Scooby?
Read the scripture, got the picture, now I don a Kufi
Solo dolo on my journey now I ship the good feast
Hearing voices in my head don't do nothing stupid
And if you really what you say you are its time to prove it
I'm bout to light my darkened life so pussies watch me do it
Yeah I made it through the fire and I'm up and moving
Tell the devil, you a liar this ain't nothing to me
Full of steam, chasing dreams, come and watch the movie
On me, it'll be, ain't no stopping Scooby

[Bridge: NOWDAZE]
Said a silver lining is getting hard to find
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the end of the tunnel ain't shining so bright
Feels like I can't see the light
But I keep on striving every day and night (every day)
So when the smoke (when it clears)
I'm still right here (I bet I'm still right here)

[Hook: NOWDAZE]
I'm still right here if you want it (if you want it)
I'm still right here (I said I'm still right here)
I'm still right here if you want it (said I'm still right here)
I'm still right here (I said I'm still right here)
Yeah

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
If all these women bitches tell me who the mothers
We can't unite and give a fight if we still kill each other
I was blessed with game to gave it to my younger brothers
Each one, teach one, definition, help each other
I'm giving pieces to the puzzle if you listen up
Blueprints to reach a gold when my time is up
Niggas tried to wait it out, thought I'd disappear
But the proof is in the pudding that I'm still here

[Outro: NOWDAZE]
I'm still right here if you want it (hey!)
I'm still right here (I said I'm still yeah I'm still here)
I'm still right here if you want it (if you want me)
I'm still right here
Yeah
