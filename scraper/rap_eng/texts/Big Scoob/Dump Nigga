Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump

[Verse 1: Boogieman]
Nigga I'm dumpin' like a yopper, fully auto it's boogie bravo
Killing everything around me, you niggas will surely follow
Yeah I spit it like a cobra, a seasoned misery soldier
Boogie definitely doper, infectious when you get closer
Infection is with the poker, I'm stickin' bitches, bend over
You love it and then it's over, no need to be seekin' closure
I'm frequently off the dojer, it's hard to keep my composure
He's better when he ain't sober, I'm driving, baby, pull over (yeah)
Damn right, I kill 'em when it's my turn
Any disagreement: we gon' settle it on my terms
I can call a couple niggas, make the block burn
Show up with them dreezies, guranteed to make the block learn

[Hook: Godemis]
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
However you want it, whenever, wherever, for real
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
Forever we put it together, we better with skill
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
Get on my level, reconsider, you think it's a drill?
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
You muh'fucka's poppin' too many pills

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Bustin' like a Ruger, I'm a high powered shooter
I'm surrounded by these yopper thangs, but I'll get down and knock it, man
Yeah, Scoobie do the foolie, and roolie moody gets groovy
I don't need the whole drum, I'ma walk up on and do it
Blame it on the liquor, I'm a full bottle sipper
What's a fool to the limit? I'm a full throttle spitter
With the tricky hair trigger, ain't no love for that nigga
I be killin' with the rhythm like I practice terrorism
In a battle I won't rattle, sittin' solo in the saddle
Need to slaughter all you caddle, got's to get them 40 titles
Yeah I'm pickin' on you feminines with metaphors and synonyms
We can switch it up, I gives a fuck, I really get it in

[Hook: Godemis]
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
However you want it, whenever, wherever, for real
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
Forever we put it together, we better with skill
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
Get on my level, reconsider, you think it's a drill?
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
You muh'fucka's poppin' too many pills

[Verse 3: JL]
Dump in, they can't stop, but to get it out may take a while
Nothin' they can say about this skill level, chop and lay 'em out
Magazine, hundred round drum, nigga predict that outcome
Automatic when a mouth run, I'm a killer, keep it one-thousand
It's school time, my [?]
Scoob called, nigga I'm there
Gun's out when I bust with 'em, when I come get 'em it is unfair
Two time, nigga's fine dine, uncommon mind mind like Einstein
Fuck categories and labels, I'm not confined on a fine bind
No filter, I'm Monsterifik, Damn Fool, plus been the truth
Off kilter, my grind terrific, can fool, chase in a loop
All nine identical, see stealth faces when I shoot
Now squad's not bulletproof, leave shell cases in the booth
Huh!

[Hook: Godemis]
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump

Forever we put it together, we better with skill
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
Get on my level, reconsider, you think it's a drill?
Dump nigga, dump nigga, dump nigga, dump dump
You muh'fucka's poppin' too many pills
