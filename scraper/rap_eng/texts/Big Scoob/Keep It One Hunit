[Intro: Tech N9ne]
If you at the rink, put ya skates on
Roll with the Nina celebrate and that the day gone
Just because the DJ ain't diggin and pumpin they song
Mediocre rappers pick Tecca Nina to hate on
And they do it all night and day long
But when they see me that frowned up hatin face gone
Ain't no rah uh reason ya fronted ya should've just kept it one hunit Learn how to make ya face stay stone

[Hook: Irv Da Phenom]
Why you comin at me like that, is it cause I came up you mad
Cause ya see me with all this cash (Keep it one hunit)
Homie it ain't no changin me
Yeah I'm still the same OG and on my momma I'm always be
(Keep it one hunit)

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
One hunit that's the reason big dog was called
Representer of the five block
Villian nigga dog
Well respected in the crime knot
Way back to Paul's
That's my liquor store
My hood
Where I swing my balls
For you young niggas that ain't know that really don't know the name
Check my history eventually you'll get told the same
Nigga big dogs a damn fool a fixture in the game
And I play it by my own rules damned if I'mma change
I was raised in this gang bang
Lived through this gang bang
Homies that done died so I got pride in this gang thang
Fuck nigga bring it
If it's beef then I'mma eat it
I'mma beast and I'm conceded I have yet to be defeated naw
I'm indefeated that's a hard days work
Boy don't make me pull your skirt and show your pussy on the turf nigga!
I'm vill walkin' shit talkin' on this fucking track
Show me's finest
Show your highness how you love that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Glasses Malone:]
Im a playa, ma'fuck haters, and this a thin line (shit) but thas what separates us
If they smart, they are the segregaters, team of Kansas city chiefs, wit a ma'fuckin Raider
Thats a problem in the makin', a problem in the matrix, people thats unplugged (man) would probably be the safest. So understand I hope this hood shit sacred, hand on the bible I shoot it out to Satan, if he ever did say shit, I really would be finer, ya you heard me nigga, anytime cuz, still serving nickels, step ya grind up, I knew the game was dirty b'fore I signed up, ya this rap shit is circus full of clowns and, otha weirdos acting silly for the croud, then they think we all the same till my pistols get to plowin, so a hunit ain't enough, gotta keep it one thousand

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
It sounds like they wanna claim KC king
They can't advance in this game cause they weakling
When in the trap making peanuts that can't see things
Like me at marina grog and galey mane feasting
Party of 70 at the (fogo da'chao)
You niggas small time, me and travis moguling now
Holding us down almost everybody know of the sound of
Tecca nina despite the hate you be throwing around
From now on they will not talk nay talk
And they family won't have to walk cross grave moss
I'm the king it because I mob boss pay cost
I pro ball on em they Rock Chalk Jayhawk
So bow down cause the king gets hyphy
If you slight me ain't no stopping the nina the almighty
Don't you see the snake and bat shining brightly
Keep it one hunit if you rappers don't really like me, fight me!

[Hook]
