[Intro: Big Scoob]
I don't know how you live, but how I live, I don't step out the house unless I'm going to get some fucking paper
There's only two things to do when you step out the house: That's either get some paper, or die trying..

[Bridge: Big Scoob]
Raised in it, and I lived in it
No way to win it, but I'm still in it
Scared money, don't eat, nigga
Beast mode, so I feast, nigga

[Verse 1: Young Bo$$]
The game's shook, it's Young Bo$$ the Kansas City crook
And I don't fuck with bigs, nigga, the Big Bad Wolf
Hustle hard, and loyalty: That's all I constitute
If you ain't talkin' money, then nigga it's fuck you like a prostitute
But if you talkin' benjamins, I'm cummin' like an ejaculation
Test me, I empty the whole clip like an evacuation
Money still the conversation, when money talks, I'm all ears
Switchin' gears, hit the club, then bottles pop like New Years
No fear, gotta rush and chop like I'm from Moscow
Let off five shots with five niggas, I need five towels
Milk the game like five cows 'till money's sittin' in five 'Pal's
If I get caught and go to trial, I'm pleadin' amendment five now
If you a witness, I'm takin' you out of the game like you got five fouls
Watch your back, cause I-O-U like three of the five vowels
Fuck that it's time to switch it up
I'm high as fuck and drunk with a pistol tucked
I'm in traffic just like the morning rush
And I'm the shit, when I hop out, toilets flush
Bo$$

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Doe-Rey-Me
Money minded, motivational
Appetite, I'm insatiable
Don't blame me
Gritter grinding, I'm greedy, nigga
Fuck the talk and just feed me, nigga
Doe-Rey-Me
Raised in it, and I lived in it
No way to win it, but I'm still in it
Don't blame me
Scared money, don't eat, nigga
Beast mode, so I feast, nigga

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Listen here, let me teach you something
That nigga livin' don't owe you nothing
Block niggas, we come from nothin'
Take these scraps and make 'em somethin'
That's the way it was told to me
Think about it, it was sold to me
Laughin' 'bout how these hoes would be
Talkin' bout how it's supposed to be
Little buddy, try'na walk'n my shoes
Shed no blood, I ain't paid no dues
Fuck with me and I'll fuck with you
Loyalty for just a few
Take this package and distribute
Pay your debts and follow suit
Link up a team, hustlers with dreams
Killer gorillas that'll die for you
Eye for eye, we ride together
We eat together, we'll die together
Always, any type of weather
Blood line can never be severed
Blood in, nigga, blood out
We beat these streets 'till they bled out
Beat these streets to the bread count
Get your bread out 'fore the feds pounce
Work this shit like a nine to five
Hustle, hustle, always keep it in drive
Hustle, hustle, help your people survive
Hustle, hustle, get your piece of the pie
Dream big, nigga, reach for the sky
Many dreams in these gutters have died
Spread your wings and take your flight
Fearin' nothing, now chase the light

[Verse 3: Boogieman]
Don't blame me, I'm a product of the painting
A fragment of a faint dream
I'm a song that niggas can't sing
Forty-one-eleven blam team
Twenty-seven-hundred champion
Still involved with them same niggas that'll pull up and do the damn thing
That's all sides, got family ties that'll all ride
Death dealers in different colors, they my brothers, ya'll all die
No lie I'm truth tellin'
Got niggas gellin' cause dudes' yellin'
Snuggled up to them same people that'd shoot you down and recruit felons
Ya'll can have it, I'm done with it
Don't [?] me, follow none, nigga
Do it all for them funds, nigga
I'm turnt up like a young nigga
Best to watch your tongue, nigga
I yank it out 'fore you done, nigga
That tough talk'll get fucked off
Touch jaw, and I won, nigga
I pledge allegiance to the people
Power to the unequal, courageously fighting evil
We hustle like it's the sequel to barely makin' a livin'
For family it ain't no livin', I get it chasin' my vision
