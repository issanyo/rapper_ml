[Hook]
Everywhere I go, hoes jocking
Let a nigga know I still got it (let 'em know I still got it)
Rubber band on the grams in my pocket
Let a nigga know I'm still poppin' (let 'em know I'm still poppin')
Had hits, got hits, still make hits
Still keep the club rockin' (keep the club rockin')
I was with 'em then, still with 'em now
Still fuck with my partnas (still fuck with my partnas)

[Verse 1]
Big fella boss nigga bitches know the name
Scooby there from 56 where them niggas hang
With the shit to be makin hits they control the game
Since '96 we been dumping flames
From the bricks to the pits and the game thang
All red til im dead ima gangbang
All my niggas that is living still rocking with me
All my niggas that is missing i still carry with me
Opposition i be wishing ima knock a nigga
Ammunition in position I'll pop a nigga
Headhunters young gunners, ain't no stopping niggas
Knife one to know blunders, we on top of niggas

[Hook]
Everywhere I go, hoes jocking
Let a nigga know I still got it (let 'em know I still got it)
Rubber band on the grams in my pocket
Let a nigga know I'm still poppin' (let 'em know I'm still poppin')
Had hits, got hits, still make hits
Still keep the club rockin' (keep the club rockin')
I was with 'em then, still with 'em now
Still fuck with my partnas (still fuck with my partnas)

[Verse 2]
Same niggas from the grade school with Scoob
Day ones, I ain't fucking with the day twos
Paid dues, so amazing what we made it through
Same crew, came from nothing now we making moves
Lost some in the field where the shit's real
Vivid pictures in my mind like you still here
Dark days in the way, tryna interfere
Keep it pushing on these pussies, man I'm still here
Count it out roundabout on top now
Counting funds in the sun with the top down
Feeling young from the cum in the bitch mouth
High strung, last rung, this shit wild

[Hook]
Everywhere I go, hoes jocking
Let a nigga know I still got it (let 'em know I still got it)
Rubber band on the grams in my pocket
Let a nigga know I'm still poppin' (let 'em know I'm still poppin')
Had hits, got hits, still make hits
Still keep the club rockin' (keep the club rockin')
I was with 'em then, still with 'em now
Still fuck with my partnas (still fuck with my partnas)
