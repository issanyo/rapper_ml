[Intro: Big Scoob]
Say you got me when you know that you don't
Why you say you love me when you show that you don't
You only hang around me cause you know that I'm real
And everytime that you need me dog you know that I'm here
But when I need you

[Verse: Big Scoob]
I swear you ain't never around
I knew that you would let me down
But still let you do it
I told myself that was the problem
I shouldn't have left feelings into it
Admit that you got me, yeah admit that you got me
I promise that I did see her coming
I thought we was brothers, why do you treat me this way
You say this is love but this is hate

[Bridge: Big Scoob]
But I can't go tripping off that
I gotta keep my cool
When you realize what you did
You gon regret that soon
And I ain't gon be here to accept your apology
I hate to show this side of me but

[Hook: Pretty Boi Beats]
If it ain't real
No fake love
That way
