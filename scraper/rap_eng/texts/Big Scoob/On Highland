[Intro]
It ain't no bribin' on highland, no buyin' time on highland
Only my dawgs barkin', breakin' the silence, yeah
And it's always so violent on highland
That's right, so even if I die tonight
Better know that I tried to start a riot, ra-ra- a riot
Ain't no bribin' on highland, no buyin' time on highland
Only my dawgs barkin', breakin' the silence, yeah
And we always in [?] on highland
That's right, so even if I die tonight
Better know that I tried to start a riot, ra-ra- a riot

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
They got me trapped in this maze I've been in it for days
So many ways to get paid that it's making me crazed
I stay blazed off the liquor, least a fifth when I move
And if you catch me off a traffic, know I'm clutching it too
Got the stripes to be a boss but still make moves like a goon
Disrespectful with that chatter you'll be seeing me soon
Kinda repetitive but evident big homie's a fool
Boy I'm a tyrant off of highland, I was raised with the goons
Make noise, bring thunder, making sure that I'm heard
Tryna channel mister [?] and we keen to his words
Born trooper, pistol shooter gives a fuck when I die
Ride [?] it's all forsaken for the land if they die

[Hook: Big Scoob]
If I should die a youngster
Make sure that some highlanders swear to put me under
Take care of all my kids and don't forget about my mother
I'm resting in peace, I'm in the grave and not the gutter, hey!
I said if I should die a youngster
Make sure that the highlanders there to put me under
Take care of all my kids and don't forget about my mother
I'm resting in peace, I'm in the grave and not the gutter, hey!

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
The underbelly of my city man it's really a beast
So I'mma beast in my beliefs 'cause I was raised in these streets
Life of struggle, bringing hustle [?] on the block
Fourth and twenty, ain't too many, I'm too strong to be stopped
I'm suited down in Duckie Brown, a villain playing my part
I got the soul of all the soldiers buried deep in my heart
And for my dogs behind the bars I spit these venom for y'all
Keeps it raw just what I saw and let the memories talk
I walk the walk and talk the talk until they lie me in chalk
And when they bury me [?] that's what I'm told
I'm HI 'til the day I die, high 'til I land
It's do or die for the vilian tryna stick to the plan

[Hook: Big Scoob]
If I should die a youngster
Make sure that some highlanders swear to put me under
Take care of all my kids and don't forget about my mother
I'm resting in peace, I'm in the grave and not the gutter, hey!
I said if I should die a youngster
Make sure that the highlanders there to put me under
Take care of all my kids and don't forget about my mother
I'm resting in peace, I'm in the grave and not the gutter, hey!

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
In '86 I was jumped in screaming 5'-6', ain't that a bitch
'Cause it's the same gang we still hang we still bang
Whatever it takes to maintain the dope game or this rap game
I done made dues my real truth fuck a OG I'm Oh-Be real
A nigga's big homie, nigga big dawg, ya'll know me
Front line doing war time
Held it down while my niggas caught time
Hold my grind, hustlin' hard
Staying strapped prepared for war
Anything for my villains nigga
[?], bust that nigga
If he don't pay, rob that nigga, all in the name of villain
Now I'm killing him in this rap game
Fuck that fame, chasin' cheddar
Make him a vettar, way too clever, had to fit the script
But I'm still screaming 5'-6', highlander niggas ride shit

[Hook: Big Scoob]
If I should die a youngster
Make sure that some highlanders swear to put me under
Take care of all my kids and don't forget about my mother
I'm resting in peace, I'm in the grave and not the gutter, hey!
I said if I should die a youngster
Make sure that the highlanders there to put me under
Take care of all my kids and don't forget about my mother
I'm resting in peace, I'm in the grave and not the gutter, hey!
