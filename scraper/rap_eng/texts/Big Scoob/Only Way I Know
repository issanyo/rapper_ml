[Hook]
Got it out the mud, only way I know
Came up dealing drugs, only way I know
If you try me, I'ma bust
Disrespectful, that's a must
Then it's back to getting bucks the only way I know
Got it out the mud, only way I know
Came up dealing drugs, only way I know
If you try me, I'ma bust
Disrespectful, that's a must
Then it's back to getting bucks the only way I know

[Verse 1]
I remember hopping fences
Popping yola, popping pistols
Running wild through residentials
Try'na dodge the penitentiaries
You might say that I was wild
But I'ma say I was surviving
If you acting like you want it
I'ma show you that I'm mobbin'
I been down and then came up
I done took that risk
I done made that and then lost that
I done flipped that shit
Nigga talking 'bout what he would do
I done did that shit
Don't care about what you seen boy
I done lived that shit

[Bridge]
I done did some things you only do in dreams baby
And no secret, I done made my living off of fiends baby
And you can't play me like no monkey, I'm a king baby
You keep playing with me, you gon' need the '380

[Hook]
Got it out the mud, only way I know
Came up dealing drugs, only way I know
If you try me, I'ma bust
Disrespectful, that's a must
Then it's back to getting bucks the only way I know
Got it out the mud, only way I know
Came up dealing drugs, only way I know
If you try me, I'ma bust
Disrespectful, that's a must
Then it's back to getting bucks the only way I know

[Verse 2]
I done came up, had to step my game up
Hustle got my change up, still I didn't change up
Partners from my neighborhood
Clicked and then we gamed up
5-7 RDVs yeah we had our names up
Music wasn't my passion though
That's just the hustle, I hopped in
Fuck spittin' it, if it's real lyrics
Go toe to toe with your top ten
Rappin' made me feel boxed in
Pussy never had me locked in
I was always out on the go
Makin' money moves trying to get it in
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothing
Ate it all never save me nothing
How you blaming when I take something
Used to heat the house with the baked oven
And now my daughters never have to go through that
Never have to play with traps
I sacrificed it all for that

[Hook]
Got it out the mud, only way I know
Came up dealing drugs, only way I know
If you try me, I'ma bust
Disrespectful, that's a must
Then it's back to getting bucks the only way I know
Got it out the mud, only way I know
Came up dealing drugs, only way I know
If you try me, I'ma bust
Disrespectful, that's a must
Then it's back to getting bucks the only way I know
