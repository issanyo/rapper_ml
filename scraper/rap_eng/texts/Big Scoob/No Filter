[Intro:Big Scoob]
No filter, the latest entry from the big fella
The definition of no filter
Is I say what the fuck I wanna say
When I wanna say it
No matter who's listening!
The truth is
Half of these niggas don't fuck with me anyway!
So what a fuck am I losing?
Fuck y'all!

Chorus: (x2)
No control on these thoughts I've been thinking
No filter on my words I just serve you what I'm thinking
And please don't be mistaken, it's not only when I'm drinking
When I choose to share my mental, it's a problem in the making
Feel me nigga!

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I ain't never been one to bite my tongue
I see the very first thing I'm thinking just for fun
I call it whiskey thoughts, the thoughts that whiskey bought
If that's the way I feel, then that's what I'mma talk
Most of what I say, turns around and bites me
But I don't give a fuck, cause y'all don't really fuck with me
They say I say things that don't really need to say
But if I hold it back, then it means I'm being fake
I'm in a pit with snakes, slimy bastards filled with hate
But I'm trying to feel my plate, so it's really no escape
Maybe this is fate, I can be the voice of reason in a business where it pays for you to be deceiving
That's why it's open season on these pussies when they speak to me
I don't get no closer to these niggas than I need to be
That was my mistake, niggas first go around
No new for no feelings in this business so I'm showing out
Feel me nigga!

Chorus: (x2)

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Mind of a maniac, the pictures where I'm living at
Rhymes of a braniac, now that I remember that
I'm defined with these rhymes and the way I act
Hard times left the grind in every rap
Hard times left your homie mental scars
That's the reason I'll be drinking
I'm just drinking, drinking hard!
Though I try to write these bars
But these bars bring up memories
These memories bring up violence
That I'm trying to keep within me
So I'm hoping that you hearing me
Better yet, you're feeling me
I'm trying to give you niggas
Simple ways how to deal with me
Always keep it real with me, keep your shit intact
Lying is the number one reason I react become a silverback
Introduction to this animal, no tolerance for no sucker shit
The shit is not understandable
I'mma keep it with my hustle that's the motto of the hood
Fill up that bravado boy I wish a nigga would
I ain't up to no good, I'm just trying to chase a dollar
Watch your tongue and how you come or it just might be a problem
Feel me nigga?

Chorus: (x2)
