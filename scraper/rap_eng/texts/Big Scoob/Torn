I'm torn, I don't know which way do I turn how do I use all the lessons I've learned (yea,yea)
Man it's like a weight on my soul for the confusion and it's taking a toll (yea,yea,yea)
Trying to find a way I can live and be respected by the wife and the kids (yea,yea,yea)
All I know is hustle and struggle chasing paper but ain't no future in the end


[Verse 1]
I'mma try to spill my thoughts on this blank sheet of paper
Deep drinkin as I'm thinking straight whiskey no chaser
My head hangs low and my heart weighs heavy
I'm lost with no direction and I'm tryna hold steady
Supposed to be the big homie, 'posed to have the answers
But it's my turn to be concerned I'm running out of chances
Scared of my future and the vision that it holds
Try to run from destiny but this is what I'm owed
At the prison foul living, I'm a straight up hood n***a
So it's written, I'm submitting, but I'm still a good n***a
But I gotta feed the fam and I gotta be a man
This rap s**t ain't working so it's time to switch the plan
So it's back to what I'm good at, push a man push a pie
Hit the road, bring it by, get to dumping wing pies
Get them fluffy green sacks, bring the whole team by
I miss it and mean that, get me where the greens at

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can spend but I'm drowning, ain't no way around it, I'm stressing and I'm losing my mind
If this is all that's meant for me, then really am I wasting my time
Heading for them gutters, backed it up in butter, I'm a beast with the hella of a grind
Give me death or prison, if that's a n***a sentence, at least let me die with my pride
Strange fans'll probably hear this song and not really get it, or not really feel it , or not really dig it, then that's cool, I'm just writing this trying to free my mind, of these thoughts that's inside of me in this place and time
Plus y'all probably thinking that I'm leaving out my dreams, just remember, everything ain't always what it seems
Can't believe what you hear and only half of what you see, so listen to my lyrics, the message is the clearest
I'm at a crossroads tryna chose which way to go
Road 1 is my destiny, the price is my soul
Road 2 is what's best for me, but is there room to grow?
I don't really know but it's time to choose a road
Let go and let God is what the big homie tell me, but God ain't gotta pay these bills on time, n***a feel me?
Stressed out, fighting gout, gripping on my bottle
Strong enough to smack a barrel, scared of tomorrow
