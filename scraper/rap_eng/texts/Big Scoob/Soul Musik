You've chosen "Big Scoob's Soul Musik Playlist'

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Such beautiful music (so beautiful)
From deep in my soul
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's a beautiful movement
(Oh it's a beautiful movement)
Such a sight to behold

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Push play, Kansas City's on blood stones
Natural high, got me vibin' to these love songs
Switch it up a bit and change the mood to make ya slick
Can't stop, won't stop, blood with this shit
Nas told a nigga, "All I need is one mic"
So I listen to the message, made you look at my life
Get ya hustle on, juvie made me go and get it
Slow motion, but as long as I'm in motion with it
Back stab, 'cause the love of money is why they do it
The O'Jays really taught me how to love music
Let the spinners make this ghetto child into a man
The rubber band man, cold handed wanded man

[Bridge: Big Scoob]
I'm in the mood for some sexual healing
My lover is distant, takes to for this feeling
I'll be your puppet, I'm ready and willing
I'm a stubborn kinda fella, but tonight I'm submittin'

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Such beautiful music (so beautiful)
From deep in my soul
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's a beautiful movement
(Oh it's a beautiful movement)
Such a sight to behold

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
From foreplay to Gunoplay, Wuzhanindoe?
Got my Bible on the dash, how I have to row
Then I back your boogie with that Inglewood front
Chicken hawkin', blood walkin', Mac Dime's in the trunk
Now it's me against the world man look at Brenda's baby
Dear mama, all this drama got your baby actin' crazy
Twistin' up my fingers, but I'm big and back boolin'
Man this YG indignant plus the young blood groovin'
Rock bounce skate vine, Mason said, "Do it mane"
And I lost a few with that one, but I gotta keep it movin'
Since we groovin', push play on the god of the slaps
Play anything from Rodger man, anything from Zach
To the gooner boom bap, yeah shakin' down the industry
Freddy Fox to Enemy, I love this nigga's synergy

[Bridge: Big Scoob]
And the love's gonna get ya, gonna get ya
Said the love's gonna get ya
BDP paint it bitches

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Such beautiful music (so beautiful)
From deep in my soul
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's a beautiful movement
(Oh it's a beautiful movement)
Such a sight to behold

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Miss Patty Uretha(?), from smokey Detroop
MJ, the one way, now switch it to blues
Bessy, then BB, then waters get muddy
Then Eda, then Elmo, then Gayas and Buddy
Sunshine in KC, they told me how to get down
Let [?] get funky, and kill 'em with this new sound
Play that funky music, white boy, tear it down
Welcome to the Terradome, soundin' how we livin' now
Wearin' double [?] bones, lettin' 'em know I get around
Pocket full of stones, I'm the king of the underground
Knockin' over buildings in the city with the dog pound
Letin' 'em now it's on with my Villains screamin, "Hog style"
Mobbin' through the bay with the savage, tryna' be legit
Face twistin' ugly on my Mac Dre shit
Man, so much music that it's seepin' out my soul
And I'm hopin' that you feel like I feel when I flow

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Such beautiful music (so beautiful)
From deep in my soul
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's a beautiful movement
(Oh it's a beautiful movement)
Such a sight to behold
