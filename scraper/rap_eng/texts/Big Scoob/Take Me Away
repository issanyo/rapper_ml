[Intro:Big Scoob]
Lord, Grant me
The serenity to accept the things that I cannot change?
Courage to change the things that I can and the wisdom to know the difference?
Learning to live one day at a time, Enjoying one moment at a time
Accepting hardships is my path when it peaks
Taking as he did, My sinful world as it is, And not as I would have it

[Hook: Irv Da Phenom]
It's like everywhere I go the drama follow me
I try to get away, The streets is calling me, Lord Please?

Take Me Away (x3)

And the hood is all I know, So I'm just trying to stay strong but
I don't know if I can make it on my own, Lord Please?

Take Me Away (x3)

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
They got me scared to pick my phone up, It's always bad news
Seems like lately, Lord I ain't winning, All I do is lose
I done lost so many people, I got nothing left to lose
They done turned the chess to checkers, They ain't playing by the rules
I done paid so many dues, Feel like I should know the moves but
I'm blind and I can't chose, How much longer in these shoes?
I've been walking down this same path, It's time for something new
I keep trying to add up numbers but subtractions all you use
Man, I'm sorry for these questions but I need to see some truth
I've been waiting on these blessings, I don't think they coming through
Man, You told me put my faith in you but now my heart is bruised
I got nothing left to do but run these streets and hunt for clues

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Big Scoob]
I'm so tired of gutter livin, How the story stays the same
How I see the same picture and it's always full of pain
Life is cloudy in these pitchers and it always brings rain
That's the reason, I be itchin in the kitchen, twistin' caine
Ain't much different if it's prison or the block it's all the same
So I get it how I'm livin don't make sense to leave the game
I ain't trying to place the blame, I'm just asking how to change?

Tryin to find a different lane, That's the reason I'm with Strange but
With Strange brought the fame but it's slow to bring the change
So I'm right back in the game and I don't think that I can change
Man, My home will still remain, Still got greed for fancy thangs
So I'm right back in position on a mission through the rain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Man, They tell me it's a reason, While I'm still upon this earth
Am I the only one dont see it, Please? Show me what I'm worth?
Just a glimpse of my destiny? I swear to give the best of me
And till there's no more breathe in me, All I got that's left of me
I'm trying to clear the pitchers with my very last shot
If a switch don't come from this one, Then I'm heading for the block
Time to holla at my mexicans and dust off my pa
Yeah, You know I had to keep it man, I knew I couldn't stop
I'm a pusher that's my nature, So I'm trying to push these records but
I speak a different language, So it's hard to get my message
Vent aggression, Under Pressure, Like the lids funna blow
Got my eyes on the prize but, It's still far to go

[Hook]

[Outro]
So as I stand here before you, Lord
I take this opportunity to humble myself and ask you for your help
It's like at this point in my life right now
I need something different or I just need you to let me know
This is the path that you intended for me and I'll walk this path with no resistance
