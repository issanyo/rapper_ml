[Intro: Big Scoob]
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh

[Hook: Big Scoob] (x2)
Fast forward, no repeat
(We push start with no key)
Y'all on one, we on three
(We push start with no key)
All talk, gotta show me
(We push start with no key)
It's big dog and Don P

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I push start with no key
Gritty nigga from the show me
Reverse the letters of OG, think about it (I go big)
Slippery tongue, gotta spit that game
Sickening numb when I dump these flames
Wait of a ton, hit like a gun (bang, bang, bang)
What y'all doing I already done it
Get down through it, nigga, let's run it
Simple and plain, I'm trained for this
I come from the gutters where anguish lives
Look in my eyes, I'm dangerous
They mock me and copy, they (Yankovic)
Yeah, Johnny's, I walk a life
Trappin' and rappin', respect the stripes
Hustle and struggle, get game from strife
Money and muscle, pain from plight
Hard scars, made me a blight
Dark hearts, searching for lice
Sick of the same, I'm ready for change
Something within me keeps wanting the game
Avoiding the voices deep in my brain
Gorilla within me could never be tamed!

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Fast forward, no repeat
(We push start with no key)
Y'all on one, we on three
(We push start with no key)
All talk, gotta show me
(We push start with no key)
It's big dog and Don P

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Don P's where the dough be
(We push start with no key)
I drink liquor, I blow tree
(We push start with no key)
All the niggas and the hoes see
(We push start with no key)
So tell the crooked ass police
(We push start with no key)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Repping KC I eat Niecie's
Go Chicken Go and at Lutfi's
That's family nigga, don't ever scam me nigga
You getting gone if you talk too loosely
Word to Ivy, aunt Susie, you can ask my big brother Puchie
We good ghetto to ghetto we get to murdering medals
Back in the day motherfucker we Gucci!
Dumb bitch, I'm on young shit, many bitches on this one dick
So many more wanna come get
But I can't have a whole lot of sprung chicks
Bum nigga to a plum gritter
You don't gotta have a million to run with her
She got a gun witcher, and a tongue spitter
You gotta get 'em believing there ain't nothing bigger
Tell a real G to get a meal free
'Cause the drive and the level that is skilled, B
You wanna kill me, then we will be getting filthy
Nigga didn't know I'm with Big Scoob, I'm with Big Nick
I'm with Big Shug, I'm with Trick Trick
I'm with O.G. Mugs in this quick list
And you don't wanna get your motherfucking wig split
I'm with Big Chuck from Fillmore, me and my niggas, we will go
When approaching us, take your hands out your pocket real slow
Kill foe! 56 where my rouges be
Ask around, all the real niggas know me
Nigga, free O.G. B-O-P, we push start with no key!

[Hook: Big Scoob] (x2)
Fast forward, no repeat
(We push start with no key)
Y'all on one, we on three
(We push start with no key)
All talk, gotta show me
(We push start with no key)
It's big dog and Don P

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Hahaha, my nigga Scooby called me Don P
'Cause back in the day when we was young, man, you know
They called me Donny Punani because my middle name is Dontez
And my nickname is Donny and they say I love Punani
So, that's why he call me Don P (hahahaha)
