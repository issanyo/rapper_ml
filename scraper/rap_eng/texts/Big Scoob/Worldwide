Gutter butter, I'm hustling (ay)
Border brothers hunting. all ends (ay)

Born to get it bro, strong chin (ay)
Bout to ask you no talking (ay)
Bout the business but I'm fucking with this music thang (ay)
Worldwide get 'em live when they hear the name (ay)
From the town where the underground run the game (ay)
Put it down for the crown, niggas know the name (ay)
