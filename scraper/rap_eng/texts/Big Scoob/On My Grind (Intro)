[Intro]
Inside of me there is two dogs
One mean and evil
And one good
They constantly fight
When I'm asked which one will win
My reply is "The one I feed the most"
Shit

[Bridge]
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war

[Verse]
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
Anything for my villains, nigga
Sell this ye, fuck that nigga
He don't pay, rob that nigga
All in the name of villain now
Been killing them in this rap game
Fuck that fame, chasin' cheddar
Make 'em more better, way too clever
Had to flip the script now
Everybody screaming "Five, Six!"
Worldwide with this block shit
Black folk gon' knock this
White folk hit the moshpit
Fuck everybody that's anybody that ain't slapping Big Dog's shit
Hop up on it, take it all bitch
Gutter nigga, makin' all hits
Hundred rounds for the underground
Scooby gettin' down, emptied all clips
Clone niggas, they all pimps
Rap game lost all grips
Everybody's like everybody, if you ask me, it's all shit

[Bridge]
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
On my grind, hustling hard
Staying strapped, prepared for war
