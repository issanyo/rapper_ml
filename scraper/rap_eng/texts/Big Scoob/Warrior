[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
I'm a warrior, what you know about me, for real?
Warrior, if I said it, I did it, for real
I'm goin' beast mode, from the west to the east coast
Always stickin' to the G-code
Warrior, and I'm made that way, say it that way

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I've been stepped on, and felt low like less than a man
But I bounced back, we get back, got back to the plan
I been bust on and bust at, been hit with a few
Then I came back, and bust back, I'm hittin' 'em too
Let this liquor get the best of me, I'm drowning in this bottle
Only speakin' on my demons, I ain't looking for no sorrow
Fuck tomorrow, I'm just livin' in this moment that I'm in
Keep it hollow in the chamber, if it's danger I'ma win
And anger is my issue, that keeps me from my issues
Fuck you funny niggas, I'ma miss this just to get you, if you
Claiming that you real, but you see though
Claiming you's a pitbull, but really you's a shih tzu, you bitch, you
Tryin' to shake the ground I'm standing on
Feet planted firm in the sand, and I'm strong
Understand that I'm ready, bro, for anything I'm facing
I'm a warrior by definition, any situation

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
A juggernaut, a giant, my heart beating like a lion
If I'm breathin' I'm defying
Takin' form, no compliants
Obstacles and hurdles
Now the rabbit beats the turtle
It's different where we livin' in
But I ain't one for givin' in
My cut of cloth is different so I chose to say it different
Different codes, I live different, man
Face it, I'm just different, nigga
Scratchin' claw and get it, man I'm always tryin' to win it
I had missteps and setbacks, but as long as I'm still in it
Ain't no quitter in my blood, I'm a demigod of sorts
You can't see me on the court, man my life is like a sport
I'm Jordan, I'm Jeter, I'm Tyson, I'm Floyd
I'm Barry, I'm Sosa, I'm pumped up on 'roids
My own screamin' cheerleader, "Scoobie you the greatest!"
"Look here, let's be clear with it, homie you gon' make it"
I done made it, I'm still breathin' I done lived a full life
Ain't no plans of leavin', man, this dog's in the fight
