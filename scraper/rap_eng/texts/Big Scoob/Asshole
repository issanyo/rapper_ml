[Intro: Tech N9ne]
A.S.S.H.O.L.E
The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like, whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
MC's come around me talkin' 'bout
"Your stage show is off the hook" as I'm walkin' out
As if to say my performance is why they gawkin'
Outside that I'd be lost in doubt the lyrics
That a nigga be tossin' out
You motherfuckers can't see Tech, I mean be Tech
And these rejects lyrically don't got no electricity
We that quick-ily eject when your shit inside the CD deck
We just put in the dope shit we rep
Then we jet I mean split like a V-neck
Nigga that's disrespectful, never test the next bro
When he up the air like Craig Smith, Tech and Nesto
Standin' next to Necro we blessed to let flow, get dough
Even though you know we gets the pest-o
Kali say that it's a compliment
When they say that they love the show, but I spit that monster shit
All you mediocre rap motherfuckers tryin' to spit
I'll murder yours ya I'm an asshole when its time to shit, nigga

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
You can label me an asshole
'Cause I'm fast, puttin' yo ass on blast, I'm a natural
Call me sphincter, little stinker
You ain't touchin' me in this arena (noo!)
You can label me an asshole
'Cause I'm fast, puttin' yo ass on blast, I'm a natural
Little dook shoot, don't make me toot-toot
You don't wanna make me have to shoot poops (noo!)

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Let me at 'em, nigga line 'em up, I smell pussy
These niggas funny, nigga battle rappin' and steady wolfin'
They barely eatin', but believin' they can see me heathens
Or be my heathens, best believin' it's gonna end with squeezin'
I'm not a rap cat gives a fuck about your vicious flows
Big homie stay strap with the force so I got heat to blow
But I don't freestyle and waste rhymes like half of ya
I'm still spectacular It's just a different vernacular
I'm disrespectful Gives a fuck bout your hip hop
I'm tryin' to eat you niggas meat, I'm coming for your spot
Fresh off the block and I won't stop until I reach the top
I'm Killa City's B.I.G. I'm guessin' Nina's Pac
Damn right nigga quoted and unqoutable
Any problems we can solve them nigga let me know
We the new niggas Strange Music takin' over
And there ain't nare nigga safe, nigga even Hova

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
You can label me an asshole
'Cause I'm fast, puttin' yo ass on blast, I'm a natural
Call me sphincter, little stinker
You ain't touchin' me in this arena (noo!)
You can label me an asshole
'Cause I'm fast, puttin' yo ass on blast, I'm a natural
Little dook shoot, don't make me toot-toot
You don't wanna make me have to shoot poops (noo!)

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Asshole mio, I'm super sick and sodomize ya bride
My bad attitude will be my demise
Don't look me directly off in my eyes
I might get insecure bout what you starin' 'bout
Rip you fuckin' hair right out
Mr. Nice Guy I might seem when you meet me
But niggas might die if I'm deeming your speech beefy
Kiss him bye-bye if he ain't speedy to leave me
Had to nighty-nighty 'im cause a nigga seemed sleepy (What an asshole)
The world did it to me, staring at my face like it's playing a movie
Twist my lip off and my lip off, not polite type so that mean I'm soft?
You think I'm chicken I think your bitch is the dipping sauce
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
Can't give ya neither one, you bitches is too troublesome
Yeah I'd like to sign my name on your poster
But don't slip me your demo it's gon' end up as a coaster
I'm an asshole

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
You can label me an asshole
'Cause I'm fast, puttin' yo ass on blast, I'm a natural
Call me sphincter, little stinker
You ain't touchin' me in this arena (noo!)
You can label me an asshole
'Cause I'm fast, puttin' yo ass on blast, I'm a natural
Little dook shoot, don't make me toot-toot
You don't wanna make me have to shoot poops (noo!)
