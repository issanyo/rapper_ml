[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Tramp, yap, yooby or yicky it's all ratchet
Whore, slut, bitch or a floozy the same reaction
Blood, cuz, nothin' but thugs, we all active
Mean mugs up in the club, them niggas active!
Hard heads, goonies so loony, ready for action
Five blocks, six and a seven, nigga what's hapn'en!
Hood shit, hoodies and dickies - that’s how I dress
Real spit, homie, you know me, I am a mess!
White V diamonds be shinning throughout my teeth
No sleep, hustlin' and grindin' and tryna eat
Brain wired, all I desire is grimy shit
Flame fire out of the muzzle when choppers spit
Dice games stay in my lane a gutter bitch
Thick hips loving my fame, but she ain’t shit
Hood rich, chef in the kitchen, I got that twist
So slick, planning and plotting my next lick

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Big Scoob]
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood

All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Yada, yams, yayos no difference, it’s all yickins
Drop it, lock it, rock it, I’m twisting it in the kitchen
Pistol popper, knocker, a chopper it’s all heat
Glock 'im, pop 'im, drop 'im or stop 'im if I don't eat
Body with me sticky or difference, it all moves
Hustle, juggle, cope with the bubble, I can’t lose!
Chips, cheese, paper and yaper, it's all bread
Gridders, grinders, hustlers in bushes, we all fed!
Snitches, bitches, witness, informant, it’s all the same
Shaking, backing, kidnapping, taking piss on his grave
Gang bang, reppin' the name I’m from the soil
Rap game, nothing but flames, I got that oil!
Gudda budda, seepin' and leakin' like I’mma boil
Old school, acting a fool, that delta royal!
Slang speech, talk of the streets, I’m tryna teach
Preach, heat over these beats, expand my reach

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Big Scoob]
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood

All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Pistols, packs, pieces, my pirates, my bushel fire
Pussy, power, privilege, I live this, this all I got!
Fiends, phonies, fakers and flunkies they want it from me
Muscle, hustle, tussle and struggle, I need my money!
Snitches, bitches, leeches and rickets, now I’m the target
Bad intentions, vengeance, I’m with this, let’s get it started!
Rain, pain, walk with the flame, I gets retarded
Street beast, bring me the beef and watch me char it
No sleep up for a week, I’m chasing paper!
Slow creeps back with the heat, I’m in my scraper!
So deep, most of my peeps - they didn’t make it!
Locked back or resting in peace, this shit is sacred!
Music moving up in this movement, but I’m still losing
Tryna do it, prove it, pursue it and get down through it
Slept on, comin' to get it, I knew I could
So strong, taking the throne back to the hood!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Big Scoob]
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood

All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood, all I kno is hood
All I kno is hood
