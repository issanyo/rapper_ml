[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Busy try'na block my blessings
Now the Catholics, since I'm rapping, this is my confession
Complete disclosure, full exposure, vocal indiscretion
Heavy message from a ghetto legend in your presence
Missed the past try'na get a grasp on the present
The world is spinning as I'm holding tight, I'm slipping off
No longer winning or contending, all I know is loss
Broad shoulders, heave loader, I can carry boulders
Steps lower, slipping more, I must be getting older
But half of me is more than any average man
So as I calculate and formulate my formal plan
With repentance and redemption and complete attrition
All me, no more we on this solo mission

[Hook: Auni Saxton]
I don't need no one
To get where I'm going
People all around me
But Ima leave this place alone now
I know that it's all me
I'm all that I need
You won't see the vision
Because I'm on a solo mission

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Solo dolo lately, that's the only way I know
Solitary, constant prayer, hope my soul'll grow
Drop the bottle, clean my mind, change the way I think
Overrated, overstated, I would rather drink
Sober self minus wealth now in better health
Like a two knot used that's the only shelf
Out of place, anyplace, man it's all fake
Different days, different ways, different plays to make
They say the maker only gives the man what he can take
Enough just to see what he needs just before he breaks
No mistakes have been written in the man's fate
I see bitches in the scriptures so I grew my faith
Healing slowly but I'm better than the average man
So as I calculate and formulate my formal plan
With repentance and redemption and complete attrition
All me, no more we on this solo mission

[Hook: Auni Saxton]
I don't need no one
To get where I'm going
People all around me
But Ima leave this place alone now
I know that it's all me
I'm all that I need
You won't see the vision
Because I'm on a solo mission

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Here's the moment that I prove it and I let em see
Bright lights got em looking like who is he
Gangsta nigga out the middle, good at twisting riddles
Block hero, hunt dinero, hungry hunting vittles
Dark shadow in the battle with my inner thoughts
I don't travel with the cattle so they think I'm lost
Dodging prison with the rhythm tryin' to make a living
Clear vision on a mission trying to learn the -isms
Racism, dualism, and my gangsterism
Fatalism, hedonism, no fucks given
Sidetracked for a moment almost lost the vision
But I'm back and in the moment, I embrace the vision
Here I stand, chin up, ain't a better man
So as I calculate and formulate my formal plan
With repentance and redemption and complete attrition
All me, no more we on this solo mission

[Hook: Auni Saxton]
I don't need no one
To get where I'm going
People all around me
But Ima leave this place alone now
I know that it's all me
I'm all that I need
You won't see the vision
Because I'm on a solo mission
