[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
Can you hear me right now?
Please forgive me for the moves that I made
The jungle gets dark outside
Got the heater as I'm headed out the gate
Oooooh Oh
Pledge allegiance to the streets, have mercy upon me
Lord have mercy upon me

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Yeah
Hypocritical as I beg for forgiveness
As the lord be my witness, man I'm still with the bid'ness
'Fore I fall on bended me and pray for mercy on my soul
Who am i to think Allah stick the time to make me whole
My pathetic need to feed, my embedded seed of greed
Holds me heavy like a leash, and keeps my soul from finding peace
I don't fuck around with these fuckarounds keeps a hundred on my seat
So fuck around when I come around I'ma give yo ass this heat
Hope y'all listening, when I speak through the sounds of grit and teeth
Astounded by your grief heavy liquor, i can't sleep
Pledge allegiance to the streets, that's an oath that I must keep
Ain't no love in this mud only hopes to rest in peace
So i toast to my deceased
Rock a picture on my teeth
Fallen soldier rest in peace
Drown my sorrow in defeat
On my mom they gonna feel the way I'm feelin' right now
Put a comma on this drama, ain't no endin' shit now

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Oh my lord, oh my god
I've done dirt, and I've done wrong
And I know better
I know, I know, I know (Lord I knowwww)
Ooooh-oh
Pledge allegiance to the streets
Have mercy upon me
Lord have mercy upon me

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Poison push ya, I push the poison in all ways
Different products, narcotics, trust me it all pays
Ain't no difference from pushing pieces to 16s
From movie stars, to owning bars, I served fiends
From record labels, to banging bricks on the table
A bad bitch in my stable, I'm ready willing and able
Ain't no love in this funky ass world we livin' in
So open up bitch so i can gently shove it in
Lady liberty's virginity, an aire of divinity
Describe me as an enemy, but i know this bitch is digging me
I'm the product and the passion, know the way this land was fashioned
In god we trust, you ain't shit without bucks
So my spliff is not enough, so i grit to get it up
I gives a fuck if you get cut, we ain't brothers that's a bluff
And it's never what it seems, underhanded greedy schemes
That's the plan that I was handed in this land of many dreams

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Oh my lord, oh my god
I've done dirt, and I've done wrong
And I know better
I know, I know, I know (Lord I knowwww)
Ooooh-oh
Pledge allegiance to the streets
Have mercy upon me
Lord have mercy upon me
