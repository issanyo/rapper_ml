[Intro: Boogieman]
God forgive me I ain't never been the type to get a nigga no no
You get exactly what you pay for
I ain't faking blaze on the stage bro
I'm doing bad my nigga, bout to paint my own fucking picture
I'm doing bad my nigga, catch me on the flip and ima hit ya

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I'm fucked up in the game blood
Ribs touching my situation done changed up
Sick tucked and I'm on the hunt for that change bruh
Dummy pack with no money back its the same what
With hoping that I'm done toting
Brain fried and I'm wide hoping
Slamming liquor and im barely coping
Breath stinking on halitosis
Head napping, i done lost my focus
Homocidal with no refrain
On the bible im not the same
I'm a fighter but I'm in pain

[Hook: Boogieman]
Yeah yeah I'm the nigga
Anything I'm dumping I can get ya
But I'm on a whole different mission
Riding with the dummy gon fix ya
I'm doing bad my nigga, bout to paint my own fucking picture
I'm doing bad my nigga, catch me on the flip and ima hit ya
Said I'm tired of playing these games (no more games no)
Sick of hoping things'll change (you just won't change no)

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Yeah, I'm fucked up in a gang blood
Overheating, my shoulders beating
My mode is leaking, I'm dangerous
Can't be fucking my name up
Undereating, I'm unachieving
I'm barely breathing, my name's fucked
If I'm fucked then we fucked
If I'm stuck then we stuck
And if not, then you fucked
You fucked up, now the apes up
I see through your makeup
Your vitals bought to get ate up
You motherfuckers with the plate up

[Hook: Boogieman]
Yeah yeah I'm the nigga
Anything I'm dumping I can get ya
But I'm on a whole different mission
Riding with the dummy gon fix ya
I'm doing bad my nigga, bout to paint my own fucking picture
I'm doing bad my nigga, catch me on the flip and ima hit ya
Said I'm tired of playing these games (no more games no)
Sick of hoping things'll change (you just won't change no)
