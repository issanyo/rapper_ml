[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Oh I know I can't be here forever
Yeah, one day I'll be gone forever

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Tear jerking, ain't nothing else working
Pouring whiskey, I'm knowing for certain
My nigga's gone, he ain't coming home
I'm left alone and I'm motherfucking hurting
Over and over and over again
So many losses, when does it end?
My body's tired, my mind is lost
Sick of the fire, sick of the cost
Sick of these liars, sick of it, boss
Need to retire, go and get lost
Far from a pussy, just mourning a loss
Full of this liquor and needing a talk
Who's gonna listen alone on this walk?
All by my lonely, the way I was taught
Continue this run until I get off
Live by the gun, and die by the yawk
One thing for certain: we all gonna die
We all got it coming so take it in stride
But this one is painful, it's hurting inside
I miss you my nigga, I'm tryna stop crying
No healing with time, no needing me lying
They say it gets better, I'll never be fine
I'm losing my mind a piece at a time
It's dark and it's lonely and nowhere to hide

[Hook: Big Scoob] x4
Here today and gone tomorrow
Losing only's filled with sorrow
Living out this liquor bottle
How much longer 'fore I follow?

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
One day you'll look up (true) and I'll be gone (gone)
I've been blessed to live this long
These city streets getting colder
And I'm getting older
Gotta get my mind right, yeah

[Verse 2: Bakarii]
Niggas die every day
Still I think about the time when it might be me next
Still tripping on the daily
When it came so real, niggas ain't been the same since
Still I gotta find a way
To hide the pain that I feel, make ya wanna take a nigga face
Put his mouth on the AK, then I let it flame, leaded pain, nigga bang 'til he thrown away
But I gotta think smarter
Cuz shit gets a little bit harder
Gotta be there for my son, gotta be there for the winning, gotta be the one that feeling for my daughters
Cuz we living in a way
If you get caught slipping, nigga, might be your last day
So you better think twice when you run up on a nigga with the milli that'll hit you like Pompeii
For this, I miss, my niggas, my sorrows I drench
I hit the hemp, drink a fifth, while pumping my grip
I wish that this was it, but still I persist
With a bunch of niggas coming from the gutter
Got 'em running for the cover when I hit 'em with the shit

[Hook: Big Scoob] x4
Here today and gone tomorrow
Losing only's filled with sorrow
Living out this liquor bottle
How much longer 'fore I follow?

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
See there's some truth to this (life)
Don't get too used to this (you might)
Wake up one day and everybody's gone
Wake up one day and everybody's gone
