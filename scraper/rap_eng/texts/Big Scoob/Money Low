[Verse 1]
Dirty game, fuck the rules when it's hunger pains
Everybody, anybody, they can get it man
Judgmental, you can judge me, just don't try to fuck me
Shit get ugly for this money, blood, really trust me
I done seen it, I done done it, I done played the game
I'm older now, so I tried to find another lane
But every now again, the devil creeps inside again
The voices make my choices and reminds me just what violence is
Rubbing on my callouses, slamming liquor, dial it in
Switching on the heathen for the evening, blood I'm diving in
Rolling in the Taurus, gripping on my Taurus
Seventeen with the bean, headfirst I'm a Taurus
Windows heavy tinted making sure they never saw us
Mind ready for this fuck shit, way too late to duck this
Duct tape and [?], the money or your fingerprints
There's ways to get my money, ain't no way to get my fingertips

[Hook]
When my money low, when my money low
Ain't no feelings, ain't no love if I'm coming bro
When my money low and my hunger grows
I let the voices make my choices when my money low
Time to run it bro for the bun or blow
Anybody, everybody when my money low
Switch to hunting mode as my hunger grows
No peace, no sleep when my money low

[Interlude]
[Rat] Hello?
[BS] What's up with it man? It's Scoob
[Rat] Big fella, what's going on?
[BS] What's happenin' man? You know, uh, hollered at my guys man. They say pull up
[Rat] Shit man. I mean, how many y'all need man. I got --
[BS] Woah, woah, easy! We on the phone, but uh --
Rat - Oh, my bad, my bad
[BS] We on deck though man. I'm talking bout whatever you can handle, ya know what I'm talking about?
[Rat] Ah, say no more. Say no more. Imma get my shit together and I'll pull up on you

[Verse 2]
No pulling back, it's set in motion rolling downhill
My niggas hungry, ain't no paper shaking 'round here
Won't think about it, niggas 'bout it so we all in
You gotta get it how you live it, blood, tag me in
A murder mission, the money's coming, my motivation
No getting distant, no running from me, my situation
The underbelly, the fucking gutter's my preparation
So run it nigga, I'm greedy needing the explanation
I ain't sleeping, I'm sleep deprived and deprivation
Pouring whiskey, I'm pissy, the only way to face it
In the basement I'm hanging plastic, this shit is drastic
Like a movie but real and ain't nobody acting
I only laugh to keep from crying, keep a clear mind
I'm built for it by design, it's a filthy grind
On my soul I ain't whole, got a debt to pay
And Lord knows that I owe when I step away

[Hook]
When my money low, when my money low
Ain't no feelings, ain't no love if I'm coming bro
When my money low and my hunger grows
I let the voices make my choices when my money low
Time to run it bro for the bun or blow
Anybody, everybody when my money low
Switch to hunting mode as my hunger grows
No peace, no sleep when my money low

[Outro]
[Rat] Hey man, it ain't gotta be like -- (muffled)
[BS] Shut the fuck up nigga
[BM] Hey big dawg, wanna deal with this problem in the future or you wanna end it now?
[BS] End it
*gunshot*
