[Intro: Tech N9ne]
If you don't drink much
If you wake up and you don't think bucks
If you ain't tryna smoke the green stuff
If you the opposite of these let's link up

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I ain't fuckin' with you if you ain't livin' driven
No matter how much dirt you diggin' even if you is in prison
If you stay on a mission in the kitchen whippin' chickens
If you a miss who love getting dickin' then diggin' thizzin'
If you a money maker, and not a funny faker
Bunny chaser, but your behavior is a heart and tummy acher
If you got spit, hot for real, you don't pop shit
And stop lips, to cop scripts not, wit' a nigga on the block tip
If you ain't-a bitch, thank ya, and you really want gangsta shit
Bang to this, if a nigga ain't soft like a handkerchief, drink a sip
If you wanna come and get the money quickly, and I'm talking brains grip!
If you wanna hunny me and not a dummy wit' me, let's link bitch!

[Hook: Big Scoob]
You can miss me with that bullshit, pussy nigga
And I can't hear them suckas talkin' 'less they talkin' figures
And I ain't checkin' for no broke ass bad bitch
Keep your pussy, keep it movin' over there, bitch
Money getters, turf the realest over here, bitch
Far from sucka, never trippin' over that bitch
I'm allergic to these suckas, never had shit
Either hate me or you love me with a bad bitch

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
If you fed up, with the bullshit, with the pulpit
If you fed up with the bully at school sick
If you enemy and wanna let the tool spit
If you rule shit, and wrong with a crude clique
Who gets everybody zooted, woo chicks making 'em lose it
If them fools rich and taking group pics
Of huge chips on Instagram, tempt the man to go move quick
To make them dudes strip
Put the milli on the loose lips
If you the nigga with the Ruger spitter and you 'bout to come out on a true lick
If you fuck with Tech N9ne in this hoe
And if you always wanted to see him rhyme at a show
So if you bring that greenery and wine in the do'
Baby girl if you get naked and waste no time then you blow, let's go!

[Hook: Big Scoob]
You can miss me with that bullshit, pussy nigga
And I can't hear them suckas talkin' 'less they talkin' figures
And I ain't checkin' for no broke ass bad bitch
Keep your pussy, keep it movin' over there, bitch
Money getters, turf the realest over here, bitch
Far from sucka, never trippin' over that bitch
I'm allergic to these suckas, never had shit
Either hate me or you love me with a bad bitch

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
If a sucka don't fit you if you never be slippin' without a pistol
Quick to run up on a nigga that tried to diss you
Too bitch to say it if you pit bull then he a Shih Tzu
If you like it insane and you ain't with the norm, you with Strange
And you ain't what them stupid pity games
That motherfuckers play try to mess with your brain
Yeah, if you ain't-a stink butt, if you and the name fuckboy
Never synced up
If you mama nem didn't raise a cream puff
If you swing cuts that have they dreams crushed
If you a bad bitch and you inked up
If you ain't faulty and never have a nigga jinxed up
If we broke and you would help me rob a Brink's truck
Then give a clean fuck, baby let's link up

[Hook: Big Scoob]
