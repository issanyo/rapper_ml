[Intro: Big Scoob]
You motherfuckers keep talking about gun control
First off I'm tired of being controlled
I'm tired of you motherfuckers trying to control me and mine
You better get your motherfucking weapon
'Cause motherfucker I got mine
And I'm not scared to use it, they're not scared to use it
So motherfucker get prepared
'Cause it's 'bout that time to prove it
We're trapped off in these fucked up gutters
Everyday preparing for war
So motherfucker get ready for it
It's about that time to even the score

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
We on
If you ever test us we swarm
So the devilish best be warned, reform these Don peons
Who keep a lot of artillery
Then taking all of the hate
Applyin' to race
Then innocents get a taste
So take a bullet to liberate, off in the trigger state
We stock up to be with the free, locked up to these pop up
When they tryna penetrate it; we boss up
Don't wanna have to do it but indeed shot ya
How many more people gonna fall from this evil?
It'll never stop 'cause we don't care if it's illegal
But the weapons charges foul and fecal
When the demon is coming after you with a plan to deceive you

[Hook: Gary Clark Jr.]
Just because we're carrying guns don't mean we wanna use them
People abuse 'em, yeah we all losin'
Look at (you!) 'Cause they all shooting
Uhh, hey, yeah everybody shooting
Uhh, and you should be scared of us
Ahh, they scared of us
'Cause we out of control
We ain't got no gun control

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Feeling nervous, got a little trouble on my mind
I can turn a murder around and turn death fear to it
Now damn near do it
Think it's exposed
Just 'cause I'm sagging my clothes and tagging my toes
And beat the peace out of peaceful nigga
Thanks for yanking the breaks off a gangster hate officers
Got a lot of mo', I got a lot of mo'
I see Trumpâ€™s got a lot of votes
America is a salad bowl
And you can put the dressing on it
Chop it up and fool a lot of folks
If it's coming my way after trunk 'cause the Trumpers get carried away and I'm thumpin' my thumper 'cause gum bumpin' don't mean nothing if people is out of control

[Hook: Gary Clark Jr.]
Just because we're carrying guns don't mean we wanna use them
People abuse 'em, yeah we all losin'
Look at (you!) 'Cause they all shooting
Uhh, hey, yeah everybody shooting
Uhh, and you should be scared of us
Ahh, they scared of us
'Cause we out of control
We ain't got no gun control
