[Hook: Big Scoob]
Came out the trap spot, recording on laptops
Fucking off money fucking on women
Love me a thirst box
I left out the work spot
To come for the first spot
And now that I'm winning
I'm getting the feeling these niggas hurt blood
I kick it like Bruce Lee
I kick it like Bruce Lee
I walk in the building looking like millions hunting for groupies
I kick it like Bruce Lee
I kick it like Bruce Lee
We walk in the building looking like millions stopping like true G's

[Verse: Pretty Boi Beats]
Sensei Pretty Boi Beats
Fly kicks little banger on the seat
Where I was no dog I'm a beast
No big deal chain I'm free
I do who I wanna, she want to too
So you know I'm gonna
Personal heads gotta give me diploma
And we dont leave you know I'm a lotta
We ain't friends baby, I'm just saying baby
Understand im about these bands baby
I got plans baby, no no games
My squad lit we ain't fucking with no lames
On the road to fame I might hit that gas like smash cause

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Came out the trap spot, recording on laptops
Fucking off money fucking on women
Love me a thirst box
I left out the work spot
To come for the first spot
And now that I'm winning
I'm getting the feeling these niggas hurt blood
I kick it like Bruce Lee
I kick it like Bruce Lee
I walk in the building looking like millions hunting for groupies
I kick it like Bruce Lee
I kick it like Bruce Lee
We walk in the building looking like millions stopping like true G's

[Verse: Big Scoob]
I step in with true G's, they hollering Scooby
I'm hunting for groupies and one of you Goofy's
