[Intro]
Just when you think I'm done I go harder
I just get it done and raise the bar up
The game needs me I'm a starter
Just when you think I'm done I go harder
Hey-ey-ay

[Verse 1]
Just when you think I'm done I do it
Always get it done in spite of doing music
Hustler from the jump I'm dumping lighter fluid
Phoenix on the scene of my ungodly movement
Had to learn it while I'm tryna do it
Weather the storm tattered and torn through it
Fall from reform dumping arms I'm wounded
Fall through the storm time to show em improvement
Raise the bar up to Mars tryna hit em hard
Life scars in these bars, gutter metaphors
Mind torn from the wars that it has endured
Painting pictures of my journey I won't be ignored

[Hook]
Just when you think I'm done I go harder (hey-ey-ay)
I just get it done and raise the bar up (hey-ey-ay)
The game needs me I'm a starter (hey-ey-ay)
Just when you think I'm done I go harder (hey-ey-ay)

[Verse 2]
Just when you think I'm done I do it
Drowning in emotions I been going through it
Fighting through the pain I'm stuck in driving rain
Tryna hold my lane but I just hide your plane
Tryna keep it tame I'm bout to go insane
Tryna get this change but I don't wanna change
Got the blood of kings in my veins
Rising from these ashes, gutter Superman
They can't keep me from my destiny
I'm bout to take it all I got to see what they done kept from me
Some enough was left in me to offer up the best of me
God wrote this recipe but cooking it is up to me

[Hook]
Just when you think I'm done I go harder (hey-ey-ay)
I just get it done and raise the bar up (hey-ey-ay)
The game needs me I'm a starter (hey-ey-ay)
Just when you think I'm done I go harder (hey-ey-ay)

[Outro]
Just when you think I'm done I go harder
I just get it done and raise the bar up
The game needs me I'm a starter
Just when you think I'm done I go harder
Hey-ey-ay
