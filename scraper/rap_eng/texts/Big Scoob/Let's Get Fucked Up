[Intro: Tech N9ne]
See we tryna make all the Biancas and Beatrices shake that ass to the 5-6 Villians bitch, hahaha, y'all don't feel me? This how real 5-6 Vills do it, nigga. Like this

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Let's get fucked up)
Let's get high let's get drunk (Let's get fucked up)
We got that weed that ain't no punk (Let's get fucked up)
Let's get high let's get drunk (Let's get fucked up)
Pumpin' highlanders in the trunk (Let's get fucked up)

[Verse 1: Bakarii]
Nigga, This is Kansas City (You got me fucked up)
Highland and Short Nitty (Nigga we can knuckle up)
I got fifty-six with me (Strickly for my rouges)
With me until they lift me (We can meet for shows)
I see they lovin' us (So let the world know)
They hoes is fuckin' us (If not, they hoes go)
My villains and me yellin' (We relish until we perish)
Original rock wellers (My niggas and me releasin')
Bone and CD's (With money steady increasin')
For hooligans like me (Money by all means)
Focused on paper daily (Smokin' on collard greens)
But mobbin' off in a eighty (56th and highland)
Livin' and never die (Young, heartless tyrants)

[Spoken: Bakarii {T-Will}]
Man y'all gone fuck or what? (Let's get fucked up)
{I don't think they are, man} (Let's get fucked up)
Bitches gotta get out if they ain't gone fuck you know what I'm sayin' (Here comes T-Will)

[Verse 2: T-Will]
(Here comes T-Will)
Bringing the heat from the streets (I'm a 5-6 Vill)
You wanna drink come with me (Now I'm rollin' with my dawgs)
Nigga where y'all 'bout to be? (On our way around the park)
Nigga, you go get the weed (Now the party's on)
Got the liquor and the hoes (And it won't be long)
Before we gettin' 'em out they clothes (Nigga show some love)
Where the weed? Pass the bud (The hoes wanna fuck)
If you can't fuck, pass the rug (Let a real nigga do it)
'Cause you know I ain't no punk (Off the fifty-one fluid)
Gettin' blowed, getting drunk (Spittin' shit, sparkin' blunts)
That's all a nigga do (If I get too drunk)
Rogue doggin' it with my crew (Never givin' a fuck)
Now my head startin' to spin (Don't wanna upchuck)
Open a window, I need some wind (Now I'm on the floor)
Nigga, leave me alone (You don't need no more)
Too drunk to drive home

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Let's get fucked up)
Let's get high let's get drunk (Let's get fucked up)
We got that weed that ain't no punk (Let's get fucked up)
Let's get high let's get drunk (Let's get fucked up)
Pumpin' highlanders in the trunk (Let's get fucked up)

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Got these dogs on a hunt (Let's get fucked up)
Smokin' them honey Cognac blunts (Let's get fucked up)
Tried to quit, but now I'm back (Still gettin' fucked up)
Pump them heater, spray the pack (Mic check one, two)
It's them Rouge Dog Villains (And we come for you)
Stick em up, touch the ceiling (Let's all get drunk)
I got the thick one in the back (And I wanna get fucked)
First night, like a mac (Fuck a hoe, neva' trust)
We all about the bucks (Cock it back and kick it clutched)
So them fakers can't touch (Master blaster cause disaster)
I wanna go out in a blaze (Set the glass on the dasher)
Paw prints on my gauge (So much money to be made)
Let's all get paid (Get the clutch of red spaids)
Good fellas on a rain (Hungry, hungry eat 'em up)
It's a must that I bust (When I'm on stage, on my nuts)
Let's get fucked up!

[Verse 4: Short Nitty]
(Nigga I will dump)
I got my thang off in the trunk (I ain't lookin' for no funk)
Tryna find some hoes to fuck (Man, I want my johnson sucked)
Bakarii's puffin' on the blunt (While I'm steady gettin' drunk)
As we swerve off in the 'burb (Rimmy got my hoppin' curves)
Now I'm smashin' to the land (Fifty-six with my mans)
Now my pistol's close at hand (Heard these haters makin' plans)
Tryna' get me for my grands (It's the world of Short Nitty)
Now I got my villains with me (On the corner, countin' my scrill)
On a mission, around the balls (Got to pick up one more dog)
He's over from Ike's up from Paul's (Man, I'm speakin' of Donny Questions)
Y'all done heard him on them records (And he gets them bitches naked)
Man, let me hit it for a second

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Let's get fucked up)
Let's get high let's get drunk (Let's get fucked up)
We got that weed that ain't no punk (Let's get fucked up)
Let's get high let's get drunk (Let's get fucked up)
Pumpin' highlanders in the trunk (Let's get fucked up)

[Verse 5: Tech N9ne]
(Nina, give me 1-5-1)
With that pineapple up straight (Plus that Malibu Rum)
Got these hoes and I can't wait (Yum's make me cum)
And the know what I want to do (Get y'all straight stuck)
Get 'em all of Caribou Lou (So I can fuck)
When I'm rollin' with my dogs (Hit the 'burb on swole)
Bitches know that we hogs (So they dress like hoes)
They keep comin' out them draws (They don't get ner' dime)
And if you ain't with it, fuck y'all (Y'all don't know Tech N9ne)
I'ma highlander, 'til I die (On Midwest Side)
Never gettin' drunk, I'm gettin' high (Bumpin' cloudy eyed)
Givin' mean mugs to my foes (We can all square off)
Nigga we'll fight all of y'all hoes (We don't neva' wanna talk)
Now the parties hella packed (Hoes straight star struck)
Givin' blow jobs in the back (Bustin' fat ass nuts)
Tell ya partners, tell ya friends (Even though we threw up)
Fuck it tomorrow we do it again! (Let's get fucked up)

[Bridge: tech N9ne]
(5-6 vill)
Yeah, y'all drunk yet?
(5-6 vill)
Y'all high yet?
(5-6 vill)
That's how we do it on 5-6, nigga
(5-6 vill)
Check it

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Let's get fucked up)
Let's get high let's get drunk (Let's get fucked up)
We got that weed that ain't no punk (Let's get fucked up)
Let's get high let's get drunk (Let's get fucked up)
Pumpin' highlanders in the trunk (Let's get fucked up!)

[Outro: Bakarii]
