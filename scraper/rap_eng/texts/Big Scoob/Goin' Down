Young disciples with they sights on rittz I snipe those rifles
Thats how I moves never snooze keep my goons with me
A damn fool breaking rules when I'm off this whiskey
Life of the party good hearted but I gets retarded
This moonshine twists my mind makes my thoughts distorted
Its really party time but me I'm thinking more time
Drinking got me thinking but I'm thinking with this scorned mind

Best believe it's goin' down

I'm falling all apart I hope somebody help me
I'm on a bad trip all the walls started melting
I swear I can't smoke another blunt nigga I'm so high
Wasted liquor on my shirt still I'm so fly
Need a gallon of orange juice my mouth so dry
If I pop another pill nigga I'm gon die
Zombiie
I probably wake up in a hurse
I'm going backwards in time watching y'all move in reverse
I sip lean, I pour that liquor up
I don't take care of my health I don't give a fuck
I'mma pop a molly, wild boy and get fucked up
Nigga when I wrote this I had a double cup and it was going down
Going down going down going down

Got a gallon of the crown
Pour a little out (pour a little out)
Best believe it's goin' down

Got a gallon of the crown
Pour a little out (pour a little out)
Best believe it's goin' down
