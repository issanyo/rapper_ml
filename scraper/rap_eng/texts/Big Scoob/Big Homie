[Intro]
You suckas not used to this
And some of y'all new to this
I have been doing this
No need improving this
I am the Big Homie

[Verse 1]
Let me teach for a second
Have a drink and preach and speak for a second
Evil devil is present, I speak my mind and keep me a weapon
Tell the truth it's a blessing
One hundred proof in the booth ain't no guessing
I get down from the getting
Stay on my square, I'm a bear, don't upset him
Ain't no faking and jeffing
Rear end, I'm fair out, break bread with my brethren
If you need it I sell it
Dope fiends want 16s I ship it and mail it

[Hook]
When dealing with niggas like me in the streets
Man there's one thing you gotta know
I'm not taking no shit, I don't trip off no bitch
I'm just focused on getting dough
You not taking nothing from me
Especially not no money
I got the stick on me
So please don't walk up on me
If you do not know me
I am the big homie

[Verse 2]
Trapped in the struggle
Out in the rain, I'm in pain
Steady dodging these puddles
Hard to be subtle, stars on the brain
I'm insane got me aiming the muzzle
Piece in the puzzle, slamming this liquour
I'm different, I'm banging my knuckles
Fuck yo rebuttal
I gives a shit what you with, I'm out hunting for trouble
Flexing my muscle, in it to win it, gon' get it
No stopping this hustle
Breaking the huddle, stick to the play, what I say
Make our way out the struggle

[Hook]
When dealing with niggas like me in the streets
Man there's one thing you gotta know
I'm not taking no shit, I don't trip off no bitch
I'm just focused on getting dough
You not taking nothing from me
Especially not no money
I got the stick on me
So please don't walk up on me
If you do not know me
I am the big homie

[Verse 3]
Killing the mic, give you my life up
The hype spill the dyke when I write
Ready for flight, damn near can touch it
Gon' crush it, this shits in my sight
Move with the night
Slippery rope on the slope
Hope you holding it tight
All of my might, far from a quitter
A gritter, I'm still in the fight
Counting my stripes, swinging and missing
Not out and I'm proud of my stripes
Ignition ignite, my motor is revving
I'm ready, gon' blow through the light

[Hook]
When dealing with niggas like me in the streets
Man there's one thing you gotta know
I'm not taking no shit, I don't trip off no bitch
I'm just focused on getting dough
You not taking nothing from me
Especially not no money
I got the stick on me
So please don't walk up on me
If you do not know me
I am the big homie
