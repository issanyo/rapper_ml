[Intro: Tech N9ne]
This is my dayyy!
All the punk muh'fuckers who ain't feelin' that
Get the fuck outta my way
'Cause I'm intoxicated

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Drink, drink (hey!)
Drink, drink, drink (hey!)
Drink, drink, drink (hey!)
Drink, drink, drink, drink, bitch!
Drink, drink, drink (hey!)
Drink, drink, drink, bitch!
C'mon everybody let's get..

[Hook: Tech N9ne x2]
Intoxicated!
I've been told I can still stand on all ten toes
Intoxicated!
'Cause I been throwed
When I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold
Intoxicated!
I've been told I can still stand on all ten toes
Intoxicated!
'Cause I been throwed
When I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold
Intoxicated!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hill billy bar is the route
'Cause not too many know what me bein' a star is about
I ask for Hennessey up at this bar and it’s out
So I told my homies “fuck it, I got a bar in my house”
Full of whiskies and wines
Mixes, full liquors and bitches and pine
We smokin' 'stead of Sid Vicious-ing lines
If you the bartender this is the crime
Servin' me a margarita, I get a heater if it's missin' the lime
Drinkin' Caribou plus
I swear if you fuss
We added pineapple slices, even more flare when you fuck
Have 'em [?], intoxicated, get a little pop inflated
Sprite and Moscoto, then add a bit of vodka to get you rocked and faded
Have you contemplated
How you gettin' home this spot that's overpopulated
With lots of ladies
That's wit it and sex is non-debated, and none of 'em is ovulatin'
My na na puh wah wah dated was..

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Intoxicated!
I've been told I can still stand on all ten toes
Intoxicated!
'Cause I been throwed
When I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold
Intoxicated!

[Verse 2: Txx Will]
Walk up in the party, chicks throwin' me their pussy
Told her later, now little bitches on me, the pussy
I can turn down bitches like that, it ain't nothin'
Even though she owe for two nights of flat-back fuckin'
If you lookin' for me, you can find me where the bar's at
Intoxicated, inebriated, don't know where the car's at
I started drinkin' 'fore I came here tonight
Blazin' blunts back to back, so I came feelin' right
Lookin' for the right chick to put this thing in her life
And if a nigga wanna trip, it ain't a thing, we can fight
We can party, we can fuck, or we can kick it
Or we can tear this motherfucker up, you dig it?
Either way, it don't matter, 'cause I'm with it
I'm beating something the fuck down, do you get it?
If a nigga stepped quick, he get slapped quick
Then I pull the next chick, take her to my house and watch Netflix

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I've been told I can still stand on all ten toes
Intoxicated!
'Cause I been throwed
When I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold
Intoxicated!

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Drinkin' since the sun came up, or 'fore it went down?
No tellin' man, I'm drunk as fuck, that's how I gets down
And I'm about to fight or fuck, after this next round
Big fella like a monster truck, be knockin' shit down
They hate it when my villains is deep, and we in the building
We keep 'em deep in their feelings
We drinkin', cheefin', and chillin'
I'm clutching, touching the Ruger
And practice active as shooter
The whisky make me ruder, so I'ma blame it on the liquor
Big fella drinkin' and trippin
My phone bangin', I'm missin'
I'm laughing, mackin' these bitches
And I fucking these snitches
I'm rowdy, wild, and aggressive
A bar brawler, the best-est
I'm hooded proof, and I'm tested
Intoxicated profession
The top dog in my section
My balls is hangin', I'm flexin'
I'm way past the jeffin'
Which one of you bitches sexin'?
Undressin', blessing my brethren
Bitch, bust it open and get it
An average night when I'm present
You're more than welcome to test it (Bitch)

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I've been told I can still stand on all ten toes
Intoxicated!
'Cause I been throwed
When I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold
Intoxicated!

[Verse 4: Bakarii]
I'm strictly business, I got paper on my speakerphone
I seen her booty, I said "Baby what you drinkin' on?"
I'm sippin' Bailey's, plus the Rémy try'na creep up on
But I never stumbled, I just rolled up a bubble clone
Another shot, let me get the mob up in the b-b-block and
We put her puffin, plus I'm countin' on them panties droppin'
But don't mistake me, fake me, 'cause I'm mackin'
I grip the milli, really, peel it back and
More than a rap song, bubble on my Motorola
They got them straps on 'em, they ride around the corna'
They got the axe on 'em, tippy on my tippy toes
They got the max on their backs, out to get you gone
Intoxicated, we just faded, get the swisher gun
We cop a fifth, and tip it back, and puff another one
We in this bitch, all them other niggas' overrated
You in the presence of them dogs, nigga

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Intoxicated!
Drink, drink (hey!)
Drink, drink, drink (hey!)
Drink, drink, drink (hey!)
Drink, drink, drink, drink, bitch!
Drink, drink, drink (hey!)
Drink, drink, drink, bitch!
C'mon everybody let's get...
