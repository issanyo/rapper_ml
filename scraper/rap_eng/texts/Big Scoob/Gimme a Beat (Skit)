[Intro:]
Hey Tech give me a beat man..

[Verse:]
In '86 I was jumped in
Screamin' 5'6", ain't that a bitch
Cause it's the same gang, we still hang, we still bang
Whatever it takes to maintain the dope game of this rap game
I done paid dues on my real trues
Fuck an OG, I'm OV
Villain niggas, big homie, nigga, big dog, ya'll know me
Front line doing war crimes
Held it down while my niggas' called time
On my grind, hustlin' hard
Stayin' strapped, prepared for war
Anything for my villains, nigga
Sell this Ye, bust this nigga
He don't pay, rob that nigga
All in the name of villain
Now we killin' 'em in this rap game
Fuck that fame, chasin' cheddar
Makin' more better, way to clever
Had to flip the script now
Everybody screamin' 5'6"
Worldwide with this block shit

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
*laughing*
I'm just fucking around dog! Alright?
