[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Unleash me, let the world know who I'm is
I'm here to get it for the city with the head of the git
Repping Villain Dog'n venom 'bout to kill 'em again
If you missed me on the last one, where the fuck have you been?
Gut of Godzilla, they don't make many realer
I'm a hard hitter, plus I'm good with the milla
This is God's picture, I'm tryna bring to you niggas
It's a hard mission, I don't have room for your feelings
See the road with me or take a picture of the train
Bringing souls with me of all my villains in the gang
Represents the team, I got the streets on lock
You ain't gotta like it, they gon' love it on the block

[Hook: Big Scoob & Tech N9ne]
And end up in the morning, in the evening it's a twist
Top by my down and my ride's so sick
Gangstas don't dance but we all do this
(What's that?)
Akka damn fool
Say what I want, do what I want, play how I want
Live how I want, slang if I want, bang if I want
(And I'm strapped?)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool

[Verse  2: Big Scoob]
I been sipping all day so I really gives a fuck
'Bout your man and your problems, bitch shut the fuck up
I ain't listening but I'm wishing I could get up in them guts
But you bickering and bitching, bitch shut the fuck up!
Double fiskey with my whiskey as I'm posted at the bar
I been drinking all day but I still want more
See these youngins looking rowdy but I know they heard about me
I'm the show me homie nigga, I dare you pussies doubt me
Still drinking, breath stinking boy I'm sloppier than a motherfucker
Hit the lot, mashing out, laying down, hella rubber
Fuck a designated, I get liver than MacGyver do
A 100 up for sale like a Nascar driver

[Hook: Big Scoob & Tech N9ne]
And end up in the morning, in the evening it's a twist
Top by my down and my ride's so sick
Gangstas don't dance but we all do this
(What's that?)
Akka damn fool
Say what I want, do what I want, play how I want
Live how I want, slang if I want, bang if I want
(And I'm strapped?)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool

[Verse 3]
Baby mama bringing drama when I fall through the door
I been drinking so I'm thinking should've fucked me a whore
We wound a movie, keep it moving, slides back to the whip
I thought you knew me bitch, I'm Scooby, I don't need this shit
Say I'm arrogant, I keep my nose in the air
That's irrelevant, watch how you talk to a playa
Bitch I'm heaven sent, that's why my nose in the air
And I'm hella vent, I'm getting the fuck up outta here
Old school, damn fool, drunk and smashing through the birds
Tryna make it to my soil but my vision's hella blurred
Dale Jr. at Daytona I'mma beast around the corner
One mistake and I'mma goner, nothing's left - a organ donor

[Hook: Big Scoob & Tech N9ne]
And end up in the morning, in the evening it's a twist
Top by my down and my ride's so sick
Gangstas don't dance but we all do this
(What's that?)
Akka damn fool
Say what I want, do what I want, play how I want
Live how I want, slang if I want, bang if I want
(And I'm strapped?)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool (Big Scoob damn fool)
Akka damn fool
