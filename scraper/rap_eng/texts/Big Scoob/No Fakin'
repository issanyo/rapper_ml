[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Rapper trapper chasing the dollar, that's all I know
Fence hopper, running from coppers, kicking the door
Bred winner, far from beginner, hunting for dinner
Head spinning, plotting and mobbing, dodging the prisons
Gutter living, death is a given, fuck being timid
Hungry nigga, hair in my stomach, I'm here to get it
Sick and tired of walking the line, Big Homie's livid
Uncontrolled explodable, I am with the business

[Hook: Pretty Boi Beats]
I am with the shit no fakin'
Lights camera cut no fakin'
Ten toes down no fakin'
All my nigga around no fakin'
No fakin' no fakin'
Where I'm from we don't do no fakin'
No fakin' no fakin'
Where I'm from we don't do no fakin'

[Verse 2: Boogieman]
Where I'm from nigga no fakin' we actin dumb
Tough niggas roguish and ready and packing guns
Grim niggas causing a murder come get your sum
I'ma sing it like I bring it in silence you niggas tums
I'm a savage ain't no habit I'm loaded from brick crumbs
Switch jobs up and yapper and taking you niggas funds
Ima get mad and dump off emotions I'm acting numb
It ain't nothing but a gang when I'm busting
I'm having fun

[Hook: Pretty Boi Beats]
I am with the shit no fakin'
Lights camera cut no fakin'
Ten toes down no fakin'
All my nigga around no fakin'
No fakin' no fakin'
Where I'm from we don't do no fakin'
No fakin' no fakin'
Where I'm from we don't do no fakin'

[Verse 3: Big Scoob & Boogieman]
Lights bright, stuck in they sights, it's all hype
Life strife, stuck in a bubble all day and ice
Late night, stuck in the struggle, but still fight
With all my might, built for the hustle, but do it right
Done it, do it, did it, I move it, can still prove it
Loyal to the soil, I'm royal blood, I'm the truest
Gangbang, repping the name, blood I'm influenced
By certified killas, investing time in your ruin
Funk struggle locked in a tussle, it's all war
Brute force, I am the muscle guarding the door
Thot, tramp, trollop, a pussy, it's all whores
Molested with the metal and ended up on all fours
Dumping, busting, bringing destruction, deep in the action
Fear enough, then you niggas bluffing, acting, and rapping
Faking, shaking, facts in the making, stuck in the matrix
I'm done with it, hell with this business
These niggas faking

[Hook: Pretty Boi Beats]
I am with the shit no fakin'
Lights camera cut no fakin'
Ten toes down no fakin'
All my nigga around no fakin'
No fakin' no fakin'
Where I'm from we don't do no fakin'
No fakin' no fakin'
Where I'm from we don't do no fakin'
