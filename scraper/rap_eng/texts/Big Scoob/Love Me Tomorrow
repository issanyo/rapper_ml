[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Yeah
You might not like some of the things that I do
Or the things I say
But guarantee you, you gon' love me tomorrow
Fo' sho'

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
She love she love me not
But I never real touchy lovey dovey for what he got
Suddenly kissy huggy what is for me the buddy slot
But they callin' me to put it right in the open it could be an ugly stop
She's lookin' to be caressed on the reg
Fetched on the reg, sex on the reg
Only Techs on the bread
With nothin' but busting percussion and checks on the head
As she huffin' and puffin' 'cause wasn't no Tech on the bed
And she don't like that Tech N9ne persona
Groupies more groupies for true they be juicy like John Bedushi
Like the one that do movies, man ay caramba
You google me I'm beyond the boobies and champaignya
Bumbaclot don't shrug me 'cause I'm the rapper
But again you fond of da slacker who's been on your love
Peace in your honor, just trusting can calm ya
She stoned now I'm home but she gon' love me ma√±ana

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Can't stand to hear my name or see my face
But every time she does she feels disgraced
But she gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
What kinda fan are you
Just because I expanded you ban a dude
Like I do soft musical Xanadu
But I'll be damn if you slander who Tech N9na
My crew cannibals ain't no fan of a true man
Who do a lot in a jam or two
Said I'm a sell out 'cause I worked with Wayne
First your brain needs work you hurt the game
Every lyric that we blurst put the earth to shame
How do we burst to fame if both of our verse the same
We supposed to be different, you know that we gifted
'Cause what we spit you know that we live it
We grow 'cause we vivid
You's a fair weather fan, your predictions will never stand
Like you know something better than when I'm chopping
Whatever man

[Spoken]
I told my fans, that, I told them this years ago. I said Tech will never go mainstream, mainstream will go Tech

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I hear ya saying that I ain't the same
But in order to grow you know you got to change
But you gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Here today but be gone when you blink an eye
Constant drinking got you thinking and you about cry
I was forsaken life taken can you feel the pain
Heart breakin' body shakin' can you stand the rain
I was a friend of thee but treated like an enemy
But now I'm gone just a portion of your memories
But in your memory 'member this vividly
There was no other villain from the hood real as me
From the soil none loyal like the B.I.G
Homie from the show me, hope that's how you 'member me
And we'll soon see I ain't got long to be
On this earth claiming turf running in these streets
I apologize homie look me in my eyes
Time to turn the page be a man and swallow pride
Too many homies died before I got to say my piece
So I just said my piece and hopin' that it brings us peace

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Today is gone and I left this place
But I'll be the sun shining on your face
So just love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
