[Hook: Big Scoob]
Woof, woof, woof
I'll buss, I'll box, I'll do anything but talk
Anything for my dogs
On the frontline with it, but deny it if we ever get caught
Anything for my dogs
She said boy stop playing
Why you always tryna fuck on my friends
Bitch, I'm a dog
Always speaking game
But when I'm drunk it probably sound like this
Woof, woof, woof

[Verse 1: Bizz Gotti]
Hang up the phone we on the mission with it
My nigga said he got some bottles and some bitches with him
Now we riding through the city on some dog shit
And if you trip it get stinky and then hog shit

[Verse 2: Mr. Whitebear aka Bakarii]
Pull up parking roll it up spark it
See some fine bitches I'm a dog, I'm barking

[Verse 3: Boogieman]
Ain't no barking bitch I'm biting
Not a poodle I'm a lycan
In my yard yeah we fighting
Ain't no smelling I'm a titan

[Verse 4: Txx Will]
When them niggas hit first
Gotta hit 'em right back
It's a fact push em back with the mini MAC
Still I kill another verse
Get-go really with the track
Got the knack with the passion
Pull it back

[Verse 5: Tech N9ne]
You don't want me to pull it back
If you do then I will attack
Hit them fences in the trenches
This is where my crew is at
Worse than a shark bite
When my governor sparks light
Never ever make these niggas bark like

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Woof, woof, woof
I'll buss, I'll box, I'll do anything but talk
Anything for my dogs
On the frontline with it, but deny it if we ever get caught
Anything for my dogs
She said boy stop playing
Why you always tryna fuck on my friends
Bitch, I'm a dog
Always speaking game
But when I'm drunk it probably sound like this
Woof, woof, woof

[Verse 6: Big Scoob]

Frontline with the .45, go time
Fuck with mine anytime push a hard line
In love with the block sign always
Boss nigga, hit me bitch

[Verse 7: Boogieman]
Long way from pushing pieces in the hallway
Straight up to the Tempe I'ma get nigga all day
We gon' flip it nigga always
Pulling back the curtain
Show the people that you all game

[Verse 8: Txx Will]
I just wanna fuck bitch
Grape ape in my vapor
Juggernaut living all about my paper
From the soil we just get it my nigga
We in the kitchen make it bubble and boil
Still pimping

[Verse 9: Tech N9ne]
Still pimping on hoes
Tripping on foes
If they hissing 'cause they bitches
Quick to licking on those rogue dog niggas
Talking tall get ya jawed quicker
If you wanted me from this paws liqour

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Woof, woof, woof
I'll buss, I'll box, I'll do anything but talk
Anything for my dogs
On the frontline with it, but deny it if we ever get caught

[Verse 10: Mr. Whitebear aka Bakarii]
Ain't no talking, ain't no jeffing
Who this nigga, get to steppin'
Me, my villains, we connecting
We'll be beefing in a second
If you thinking 'bout trippin'
I'm advising you don't
Because we fresh out of pork
Unless it's beef is what you want

[Verse 11: Big Scoob]
Bet this beef ain't what you want
Knee deep up in this funk
Make me creep off to the trunk
And get to speaking to you punks

[Verse 12: Boogieman]
Talking loud with the chopper
Have them leaking in the dump
Bullets slapping like a mother
Sound like speakers in the trunk

[Verse 13: Bizz Gotti]
Then we ride out to the hideout
I got your bitch, she posted up
She got her thighs out
And if your chick hug me
Gave her something to cry about
Tell my nigga roll it up. pass it, and then I'm fired up

[Verse 14: Tech N9ne]
Fired up quick
We gon keep it lit
'Cause I got the caviar, bitches all on my dick
Caviar is a strain, we take it to the brain
Tecca Nina gon' be here showing love to my gang
Nigga soo woo woo

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Woof, woof, woof
I'll buss, I'll box, I'll do anything but talk
Anything for my dogs
