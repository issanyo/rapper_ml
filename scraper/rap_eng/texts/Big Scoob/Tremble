[Verse: Big Scoob]
Hands I'm diggin in ya
Dripping wet as you can get, I call you Aquafina
Scratching, biting, then we fighting like Ike and TIna
Capture lightning in a bottle every time I beat it
Where you run get you some every time you need it
Chiropractic fantastic how I touch your body
Blasphemy to capture me man my six is godly

[Bridge: Pretty Boi Beats]
She like it when I go, slow
Baby let me know
What is hitting for
I love the way that you tremble
I promise I'll be gentle
But only if you want me to

[Hook: Pretty Boi Beats & Maez]
Tremble
Watch it, i love that way that you tremble
Tremble on my body
Tremble
Watch it, i love that way that you tremble
Tremble on my body

[Verse: Storm]
When he pull up to my spot
I tremble at the door
