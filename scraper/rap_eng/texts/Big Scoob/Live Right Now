[Bridge: Auni Saxton]
Yeah I float on ya
If it's holding you up
Then it's dragging you down
Why you carrying all of this baggage around
Put it down put it down
Take a rest yeah take a rest from your stress yeah
Put it down put it down
Take a rest yeah
Breathe in breathe out
Take a breath yeah
Take a rest from your stress yeah
Breathe out
Take a breath yeah

[Hook: Auni Saxton]
Say alright if we living free tonight
And I ain't worried about what I can't figure out no
Ima live right now, I'm alright
My mind is so free tonight
Gotta let go
