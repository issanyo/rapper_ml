[Intro]
Judge not, let you be not judge
For with judgement you pronounce that you will be judged
And with the measure you use, it will be measured to you
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother "Let me take the speck out of your eye"
When there's a log in your own eye?
You hypocrite

[Verse 1]
Got to get it nigga
Ain't nobody gon' give it to me, nah
So I stay driven, hunger pains, throbbing shooting through me
Lord's dreams, lord's schemes, lord's appetite
Hit the road with the smelly, hope I wrapped it right
[?] it's my life, I be living trife
Heard them birdies 'bout to touch, intercept their flight
Man my daughter need this car so we move tonight
If it's fire, I'ma make these niggas see the light
Fallen angles, soul tangled in this greedy life
I used to lay and pray the Lord to save my soul at night
But now I know that I gots to do what I gots to do to get it
I can't stop to think, just got to keep on moving with it
Pop the top and drink, inebriated, bull-headed
Enough to storm a bank and pass the plate like I'm a reverend
Steady stressing over paper, man this shit's pathetic
But it's embedded in my DNA I gots to get it

[Hook]
Wrong or right
Barely missing prison, nigga
Wrong or right
But I gotta make a living, nigga
Wrong or right
And can't nobody change the fact that I gots to get that dough
Wrong or right
I do it for my kids, nigga
Wrong or right
Tie you up inside the crib, nigga
Wrong or right
And can't nobody change the fact that I gots to get that dough

[Verse 2]
Wrong or right I gotta make a living
From the bottom, so I'm gutter driven
And I know I'm barely missing prison
But losing just ain't in my vision
Wrong or right I'ma do what I gots to do
Barely make anything for my babies food
Fightin' in the ghetto where you're supposed to lose
You choose
It ain't a hard choice for me though
Sick of try'na make some paper fucking with this freak show
Gotta get up off my ass and take it to the streets, bro
Gotta get some money fast, I'm letting down my people
It's man up or man down
Talking what you gonna do ain't working in this damn town
Hands down I'm a bad muh'fucka
Talented with this music, plus I blast muh'fuckas
It's Scoobie I breath ruckus
I'm claiming to be the toughest
And battle, defeat suckas
Don't rattle when heat's bussin'
I'm pulling the peace, brothas
Skedaddle, these feet touches
They dying when we rushing
Devour these weak suckas, nigga

[Hook]
Wrong or right
Barely missing prison, nigga
Wrong or right
But I gotta make a living, nigga
Wrong or right
And can't nobody change the fact that I gots to get that dough
Wrong or right
I do it for my kids, nigga
Wrong or right
Tie you up inside the crib, nigga
Wrong or right
And can't nobody change the fact that I gots to get that dough
