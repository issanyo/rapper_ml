[Intro]
Yeah, right here is where all my villain niggas ride with me, ya dig?
We 'bout to rep that 5-6 block, boy!
Highland & Wayne, don' act like y'all don't remember!
This how we do it, does it, this how we done it, ya dig?
Get up on it, if you ain't wit it you slipping! 5-6 shit! Let's go!

[Hook]x2
5-6, 5-6
5-6, 5-6 (villain nigga)
5-6, 5-6
5-6, 5-6, I'm from

[Verse 1:Big Scoob]
Repetitive as evident, I'm proud of my soil
And every verse of every song I be repping it royal
Got it tatted on my shoulders, nigga dig that
Introduce you to my hood when I spit rap
Got you drinking what we drinking when you parted out
Got every city 'cross the globe screaming Vill wow
It's amazing how it's changing with this rap thing
A gutter movement with this music now we got fame
But I remember when  this music wasn't cracking man
On the block with my Glock doing my trapping thing
Ain't much difference in existence man we still the same
The only difference 'stead of Highland now we moved to Wayne
Still got villains from the block steady trapping caine
That sticky icky,PCP, and some went back to caine
I'm tryna make it for my dawgs, put em on the plane
I'm tryna fly so they can fly now what's that block name

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2:Txx Will]
If you ain't from 'round here then you 'gon need a pass
Cause if I say let's get this nigga then that's gon be your ass
There's plenty violence 'round here man but pity it runs low
Where young killers getting high off gunsmoke
In weekends on Wayne get the work up
From Friday nights till Clever open church up
Around the clock, [???] 3 days no shower, newspaper says we average 62 quarts an hour
56 is the hood, it's the hood, and ya heard, 7 out of any 10 niggas putting murders down
Fuck ya weak ass block cause it's not mine
Mine the one with bullet holes in the stop signs
This is real shit, Vill shit, let's get this clear
Pizza Hut ain't delivered round here in years
They say we roguish and we way too violent
Remember that the next time before you turn on Highland

[Hook]x2

[Verse 3:Big Scoob &Txx Will]
This the part where my villain niggas stand up
Got 'em rocking on the movement with they hands up
I remember seeing hands up for a different reason
Pull that pistol tell them pussies that they ain't leaving
Take it easy for me villain that's all in the past
Got these people screaming villain time to get the cash
Big homie it ain't nothing you just make the call
Imma fall back play the role for my dawg
Best believe me, gutter living made us too greasy
So from that, then go to this man it's too easy
I said I'm with it but it still got my heat with me
Play me funny, Imma gun a nigga real swiftly
Once a fool, still a fool how the game goes
If I can change, then you can change let's get this change bro
Hell yeah, money motivate me real tough, keep it street, we gon eat, so through the block up
