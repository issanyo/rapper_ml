I am a black cat
The sweetest smallest black cat
All day I sit and wait in the window sill for the passerby to notice me
When they notice me, it is with a look of horror
Because to them -
the color of my fur is scary
But it is just my fur,
Just my fur and not  a true reflection of what's inside

I spend my days watching the other cats finding someone to love them
Hoping and praying that the day would become my luckiest one yet!
But the hours accumulate,
And all of the cats have been chosen
And I'm the only one left
I feel so lonely
Lonely black cat
Little unloved black cat

But tomorrow is another day
So I must put on my brightest smile,
for today the passerby may look upon me with love
I will jump and play with my yarn hoping that the passerby notice that I'm the sweetest, happiest, little black cat
