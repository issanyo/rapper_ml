Listen up, my nigga
Little sis, little KitKat
Kit never chip that chit
Less it's chit-chat
Haller here Bonita
On a jick jiggy jit-jat
Dollars for Chiquita
Get the gist?
Let me get that pricey diamond feisty niña
Icy diva, ¡ay que linda
Like nigga Swiss, rich like Geneva
I'm so eager, nice to meet ya
If you wanna pump that missile
You bitch better drip, better wet that whistle
Scripts in the jitch
Just the witch black sickle
In the crypt with the click, better flip that nickel
Fucking with the get 'em girl in the campaign gully
Spill that girl if you the champagne bunny
It's your world, live it up, it ain't nothing
Spend that girl and keep the damn thing running
