[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room
You know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know
Gangster
I know
Gangster
I know
Gangster
Gangster
Gangster

[Break: Lana Del Rey]
Gangster
Gangster
Gangster
Gangster
Gangster
(Gangster)
(Gangster)

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks (Lana Del Rey)]
Let's go
Tell me what bad boys do
I'm a bad girl, if you into that one too
My American Dream in jeans all blue
Keep it cool like crushed ice cubes
It's you felonious in a foreign coupe
In the blue range across my view
Better crush like my c*** too
Ain't 'nough said about his moves
A real tough one, sometimes two
Bet you fine about lifetime sunshine boo
(Say you remember!)
Bananas and bow ties, whips and handcuffs
Tied down the club like living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bodies all around, put it down like an
Anchor
(Say you remember!)
Hardcore bottles
Try more than just anger
Passion like fever
Hot like Jamaica
Real rude boy, no problem for later
Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper
Truth be told he's locked down with his flamer
Really like his flavor
Wanna slow dance with the devil
Click-lick, the look of an angel
Took a small chance with a rebel now my flesh is amazing
Now we shooting them lasers and laughin' at haters
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em
(Gangster)

[Azealia Banks]
Gangster's not dead
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Say you remember!
Say you remember!
(Gangster)
(Gangster)

(Gangster)
Say you remember!
