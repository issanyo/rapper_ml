[Intro]

I love the way you do it
I don't know how you do it
Now I'm watching you and
I love the way you move
Tryna keep my cool, yeah
Boy I think I'ma lose it
I love the way you do it
I don't know how ya...

[Verse]
Ugh. Yo
I’m with it. Bitch, come get it
Automatic clip when I flame on the fitted
Dat nigga running on  campaign for the winning
But I hit em like JFK on the ticket - Ima
Stay on it. Bitch who wanna it?
Looking too paid cause I ball like Odom
Check for the best. It be I only
The black too hot show stealer, handsome phantom
Money bag, running with ransom
Buck in the tuck, I’ma  bandit
Counting my advances
Any level, I advance it - Nigga wanna jump, I answer
Sorta like fly guy - yes I
Been around the world like Aye aye
Slide on the bass like dope line
In a red kick like roll tide
Mul-ti colored my chip
Hot nigga frigid n rocking the climate
My devices diminish ya light they vibrant
Young pilot flying where the sky is
Niggas tryna get like me, don’t bother
Get a better gist on your gems and your garments
Flame with the ices, call me young bomber
If a nigga jump, Ima hit em no problem

[Chorus]

When I'm repping this crown
I be stepping in style
I be breaking it down
Doing gentlemen things
Black rich with the caine, that’s ying for the yang
When I come for this cash
Not a regular twist, don't you ever forget
That I'm repping this crown
So you better wild out when the king is in town
