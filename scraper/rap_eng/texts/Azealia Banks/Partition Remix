[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Let me give you the 2014 talk
My girl like Beyoncé, me too
This what me and her be doing in the back of the Maybach when we're listening to Beyoncé
Listen

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Driver, roll up the partition, please
Blind your rearview mirrors with the end of my sleeves
The shit that's on my wrist, you probably wouldn't believe
Every symbol of success levels you couldn't achieve
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I'm alarmed at how she's looking, and she's starting to breathe
Move my arm and grab my john and now she's starting to squeeze
She dropped it with me, fulfilling my need
She swallowed my seeds, she's ready to go
Partition is up, the curtains is closed
Mommy nice with it like she play for the pros
She gag from her throat, while she breathe through her nose
She starting to choke, she curling her toes
Look how she trying to take it all down, come out your clothes
I waited for a second and I thought for a minute
Ain't no loving good enough to give her while I'm up in it

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Stress never, the sex better, the sex wetter
Check cheddarer, etcetera etceta
Bet bet you could get severed and left deaded
Slept slept and I crypt crept in the s-seven
These niggas be puffing, they piff in the public
They digging, they lusting, the feminine strutting she hitting that button
I dip in the function
I’m prissy, I’m pumping
The tit & the rump
And I’m flipping 'em, dumping 'em
Tricking em trumping em
But if these niggas wanna spend they cheese
Tell em hit up little miss AZ
Very heavy-headed, dick take heed
I'm-a flip out if a bitch play me!
