[Intro]
Riding with my niggas who hustle
We with all of that
Hundreds stuffed with hundreds in the duffles
Trunk full of moneybags
We in love with the money and it loves us back
Bottom to the top of the globe, so where the fuck is that

[Pre-Hook]
Niggas, bitches, killers, bust that
Hustlers, ballers, gangstas, hoes
Harlem, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx on my back
New York City, you with me, let's get involved

[Hook]
I said that money keep callin', yeah it keep callin'
If you ain't with the shits bitch get up off the toilet
Snatch a nigga's wallet, ditch 'em and ignore 'em
Skylar Diggins with the wrist
That bitch ballin'
That bitch ballin', yeah that bitch ballin'
Skylar Diggins with the wrist
That bitch ballin'
That bitch ballin', yeah that bitch ballin'
Skylar Diggins with the wrist
That bitch ballin'
That bitch ballin', yeah that bitch ballin'
I said that money keep callin', yeah it keep callin'
If you ain't with the shits bitch get up off the toilet
Snatch a nigga's wallet,  ditch 'em and ignore 'em
Skylar Diggins with the wrist
That bitch ballin'
Bitch ballin', yeah that bitch ballin'
Skylar Diggins with the wrist
That bitch ballin'
Bitch ballin', yeah that bitch ballin'
Skylar Diggins with the wrist

[Verse]
Watch bitch run through that ring
Getting back in her thing
Make shit move without making moves, I'm feeling like Jean Grey
Feeling like EA, it's my way, I'm in the game
I'm on the roll, I knock 'em down, bitch stay up out my lane
Really ma, I let 'em fly, let one go in your frame
I ain't with the games, no, I ain't with the games
Run 'em down they acting shocked like they just got tazed
Going through a phase while I'm running through these ends
So much love feel like a honeymoon
Watch them other goon and her Timbs
My bathroom like your bedroom, bitch better clean your lens
And it's so much, I won't run out of it
I be the realest, them bitches is counterfeit
Way too fly, racking up mileage
And balling so hard I had to skip college, bitch
