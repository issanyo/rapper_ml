[Verse 1]
I like to masturbate
When a nigga just came
And it's just tight lame if he don't give brain
Procrastinate and play with the nipples
Touch it in the middle then pop it like a pimple
There's no debate, gotta do it, impress
By the right index in that pink flesh
Yeah, nigga, I'm a vet
Learned how to get wet when I turned 11
Late night robin bird was heaven
I got a little porno obsession
Now I got skills in the trade like Stefan
If you got skills, we can trade like best friends
But I don't mind going solo
No homo, but I cum better dolo
Wish all dicks had a switch for turbo
Took batteries, and came in purple

[Chorus]
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
I can fuck you like a pornstar
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
On your couch or in your mom's car
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Front shot, side shot, back shot, cum shot
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me

[Interlude]
Don't stop
No, no, no, keep going
I like that

[Verse 2]
Touch it, rub it, squeeze it, pull it
Hit it up with a silver bullet
Turn up the pinky, that bitch is freaky
Really can learn a few things from her
But I will not suck a tit like her
Lick a clit like her, cause I prefer
To get stuffed up like animal
And let a nigga eat like cannibal
Wax that ass like candle do
And gimme my spread like cancer do
Yeah, you better follow my format
Or get back to the steps and doormat
No jokes, no games
Yank my weave and scream my name
Say my name like a Ray-Ban frame
Keep that stiff like John Mccain

[Chorus]
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
I can fuck you like a pornstar
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
On your couch or in your mom's car
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Front shot, side shot, back shot, cum shot
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me

[Verse 3]
How much cum could a bad bitch suck
If a bad bitch could suck cum?
I splash like pools, I teach them students
Then I let 'em eat free lunch like school
Get up for the mission, get in position
I'm a suck it like Maggie Simpson
That gagging sounds explicit
Pull hard on my extensions, yeah
I gave head for a week or two
Went so long he was shocked like a Pikachu
And I'm on point, with a top like beetle do
I stay wide open like a jiggaboo
And the mascara is kinda poppin'
So a bitch ain't stoppin'
He shoots and then reloads
Tryna get it in the weave
So I leap like toad
