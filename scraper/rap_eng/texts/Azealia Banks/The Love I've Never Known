The more you anger God, the harder you fall from Heaven
'Cause even Satan was a angel 'fore falling to Hell
It's the young disciple, picked the prophecy, born with the message
And either way these niggas feel it, they gonna respect it
The makers form the faithful daughter that waters the essence
I cried a river just to swim and then learn a good lesson
Burning 'em baby, burning 'em bridges
We wanna wreck it
Oh baby, you danger
I'll never change ya, I know you reckless
That pain is that proof of pleasure
I tangle with seven devils
You doing the wrong things
You sexing the jezebel
I can tell you a 'LOL' type of fellow, you funny nigga
Who gets the last laugh?
It's who gets the cash fast

You are the love i've never known
The only one that knew me
Learn your lesson boy
You're turning my life to stone
