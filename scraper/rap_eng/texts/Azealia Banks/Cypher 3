I'm hot, blow me
I'm tryna be the greatest ever
Male or female
I don't wanna talk to you, homie, hit my email
My mentality is like professors grading papers
Cause we know it ain't correct if I ain't looking at a check
Staten Island where the youngin' wildin' for respect
They wanna see you capped in like a pilot on a jet
Who got it, you got it
Oh, you gotta be kidding me
Slidin' through with guap
Just to buy a few products at Tiffany's
Imma do pop and rock
Every time a new victory
Wanna turn tides, tryna get rid of me
Is we washing clothes
Flows out of nowhere, you gotta pardon those
I'm part monster, part martian, part Domino's
Whoa, cause my delivery hot
Lyrics she got, they come 20 a pop
And not dollars either
How the student gonna defy the teacher
Son, this is rap 101, just like a high fever
I'm a diva, yes
I don't need the press
I don't be depressed about things that I don't need to stress
Honestly you're like my toddler tryna bother me
Relax now cause Harlem need a rest
