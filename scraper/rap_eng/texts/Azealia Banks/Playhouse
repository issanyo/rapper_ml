[Verse 1]
Come into my playhouse
I've a lot to show ya boy, you know I would love
Love if you would stay around
So much because you are a phenomenon
Every town's my favorite, town
When you're in touch, oh boy I feel so at home
Every time we play house
I fall more in love with ya, cause you are the one!
You don't have to take me out
I'm comfortable enough on my sofa
When I fix your plate I'll put some vegetables and love - nah nah nah!
Every time you lay me down
I'm sexual, I'm good to ya boy ya know
Every time we play house
Boy I love to love ya

[Refrain]
Prayed to God for love and art and pain to draw from
Maybe you're the work of art I'm praying for?

[Hook 1]
I want you to come into my house
Undress when you come into my house
The best sex- baby, tongue and poom poom bounce!
Ya never had a love like you do now
Now what's next? Maybe bubbles, loofah, the towel
Bonita apple butter- smooth butter brown
I'm laying naked if ya wanted, to take it down
I want you to come into me now

[Verse 2]
When the rizzap begin
We jazz and bend
You got the ends ?
Just clap ya hands and move ya feet
When I snizzatch ya man
C-cash him in, p-pawn ya jawn, just don't be, don't be mad at me
I'm a rrrrippat-p-pat, an acrobat! Get back get back, a-rrrrat-t-tat-t-tat-t-tee
Come and sit back relax, sit back and breathe
With me between the sheets and blast the reef
When ya win some, spend some, get her DONE
I'm the lucky lady in the glitter, pumps
Might just let ya take her out to dinner, once
Fucker how ya figure cause I'm finna front
When I J-J-J-Jiggy Jamboree, in this here dancerie.... Make some room.....

[Verse 3]
When my DJ plays house
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Every time we play house
I fall more in love with ya cause you are the one
Come into my playhouse
I've a lot to show ya boy cause I would love
Love if you would stay around
So much because you are a phenomenon
Come into my playhouse
I've a lot to show ya boy cause I would love
Love if you would stay around
So much because you are a phenomenon
When my DJ plays house
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Every time we play house
Boy I love to love ya

[Refrain]
Prayed to God for love and art and pain to draw from
Maybe you're the work of art I'm praying for?

[Hook 1 / Outro]
I want you to come into my house
Undress when you
Come into my house
The best sex- baby, tongue and poom poom - bounce!
Ya never had a love like you do now
Now what's next? Maybe bubbles, loofah, the towel
Bonita apple butter- smooth butter brown
I'm laying naked if ya wanted, to take it down
I want you to come into me now
