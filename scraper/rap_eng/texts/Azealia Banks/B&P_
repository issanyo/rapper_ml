[Full lyrics available upon release of the song]


[Intro: Azealia Banks]
Psychosomatic, addict, insane
Psychosomatic, addict, insane

[Intro: Rihanna]
She's breaking out to go on an adventure

[Hook: Azealia Banks]
Fly up in the sky so high
[?] what you love
[?] I'ma let you in
I'ma let you in, I'ma let you in
I'ma let you in, I'ma let you in
