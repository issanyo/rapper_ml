[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
This rhyme is rugged, it's stamped for the streets
It's nice, it's thuggin' it, damn
NYC reppin, bricks is mints with my Nikes
It's steppin, its stance
Fuck fine french feminine, slammin' petite
Such a price is precious, this jam
Got my flights, I'm pressure than
They ain't ever seen nothing like this mademoiselle
Do all this cruise and blazin'
And beige and ocean island vacation
Tannin' all this, ooh I'm sexy
Pussy pop like a Pepsi
And I'm all on this new expression
Shades of mocha like his complexion
Tannin', foreign cruisin', blazin'
Baby, hope you like this one

[Hook: NEWBODY & Azealia Banks]
Wut-U, Wut, Wut-U, Wut U Do
Wut-U, Wut, Wut-U, Wut U Do
Wut-U, Wut, Wut-U, Wut U Do
Wut-U, Wut, Wut-U, Wut U Do

[Bridge: Azealia Banks]
I try to hide my feelings
And every time you touch me
I could break down and cry
Let's expose my devotion
To get next to you

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
I'm all caught up on you
What am I gonna do?
Our nights of pleasure
Only fade until the morning new
And if our love is true
I'll give it all to you

[Verse 3: NEWBODY]
Don't you ever worry
'Cause I'm gonna make you fall in love
Kiss me all night
I'll never leave you
Ooh, you do it right
In the middle of the day
I need you in every way
Kiss me all night, set my body free
I'll never leave you
Ooh, you do it right
In the middle of the day
I need you in every way

[Verse 4: Azealia Banks]
Anytime I jump in the Jeep, yes the boys
Wave they hands cause they lovin' the beats, bass, the noise
Ice on my bezel, the keepsake a choice
I'll be damned if I'm fuckin' a cheap Jake, keloid
Now we're together, we'll be more than friends
Through the years we forever, we'll be 'til the end
Now we're together, we'll be more than friends
Through the years we forever, we'll be 'til the end

[Hook: NEWBODY & Azealia Banks]
Wut-U, Wut, Wut-U, Wut U Do
Wut-U, Wut, Wut-U, Wut U Do
Wut-U, Wut, Wut-U, Wut U Do
Wut-U, Wut, Wut-U, Wut U Do
