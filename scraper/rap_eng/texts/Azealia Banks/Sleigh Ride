Just hear those sleigh bells
Jing-a-ling ring ting ting-a-ting too
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling you - hoo
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy and cozy are we
We snuggle up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
