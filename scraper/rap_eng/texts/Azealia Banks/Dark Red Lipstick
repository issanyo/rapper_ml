[Verse 1: Lola Monroe]
Move back, I'm on ya, new black Madonna
You lack persona, you stacks up on a
Only do zeros when it's plus commas
Comma, comma, comma
The queen in this bitch, all my diamonds royal blue
Taylor Gang, only team I'm loyal to
Tell 'em bring the bottles out, bring the red bottoms out
Pointin' at the map, I just pick a island out
Best believe I'm outchea, broke bitches hidin' now
No, really, I'm what ya niggas fighting 'bout
Versace for the duffel, pardon if I'm a fool
But I'm a bad bitch, diamond-covered muzzle
And all you hating bitches always gonna struggle
I just do the Loubie stunt and cop a couple doubles
Motherfuck a bitch hatin', I'm getting too much money
When it gets cold, I take my bitches where it's sunny, ah

[Hook: Lola Monroe]
Dark red lipstick on
6 inch pumps, I'm about to do me tonight
Sitting on the passenger side
Let my best friend drive
We on one, 'bout to get right
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
We on one, 'bout to get right

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
These bitches don't know, got the Liz and escrow
They need to let it go, stop feelin' so special
Y'all bitches sophomores, I mastered the whole course
That whip is chauffeured, I'm flippin' out both doors
Dark skin slim bad bitch who so cute
Petite witch, some sweetness, some raunch too
My thesis, no pitos, yo, Monroe
You peep this, bitches lookin' for loopholes and weakness
Kill 'em on the constant, this the shit they ain't seen yet
Young, behind my mama, order brunch wit' the ski jet
Notice I'm a problem, bitches, they can't breathe yet
Trendsetter mama, sweat me much, my weave wet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
I'm like "eenie meenie minee mo"
Which one of y'all wanna get my bow?
Better hit that pole then hit that floor
My shit so potent, gotta hit that slow
You do that, I'll get that dough
I'll get king then check that ho
All these bitches scared, you could tell 'em that I said so
Beggin' for a yes, you could tell 'em that I said no
Saint Laurent on her lips, gold Rollie on her wrist
That ass thick enough for the whole wide world to kiss
Fuck tulips, I just put your two lips on my two lips
Let me show you how to do this
Motherfuck a bitch hatin', I'm gettin' too much money
When it get cold, I take my bitches where it's sunny, uh

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro: Lola Monroe]
We one on, bout to get right (x4)
