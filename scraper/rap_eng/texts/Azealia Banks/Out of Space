[The Prodigy Intro]
I’ll take your brain to another dimension

[Verse 1]
I’ll take your brain on a parallel universe trip
I'm the only, no parallel bitch
Banks running this shit, maneuvered then dipped
Venom'll burn ya 'dulla, then spit, spew spit
Get ya noodle al dente'd, frozen and hid
Auto-weapon, click-click
I'm adjusting this clip
I'm blasting off, NASA - you might be stuck on his dick
Look at this bitch
Tick-tick
Which dude, wanna get hit hit?
Four fifth real quick
Four clips in the whip
My dimension is this

[The Prodigy Interlude]
I'm transcending to outer space, find another race (x4)

[Verse 2]
Pay close attention: I'll take your brain on a parallel universe trip
I'm the only, no parallel bitch
Banks running this shit, manoeuvred then dipped
Venom'll burn ya 'dulla, then spit, spew spit
Get ya noodle al dente'd, frozen and hid
Auto-weapon, click-click
Auto-weapon, click-click
Yo, what's up neutron?
You ain't gettin money, what planet ya flew from?
Crashed on a hard rock, comets and group homes
Cosmo's kitchen known as the New York
Outer world witch, birthed as a new born
Space-ship Porsche, the roof gone
Platform boots hanging out the Coup door
Harlem world make chips and move on
Nebula Rapunzel, welcome the new star
I'm ahead of your shake and your shoes Ma
E.T. phone home, or fold it like a futon
Comparisons, no need for the use of
Keep on, the phoenix, the phenom, fuse bolt, fire and speed off
Here to take you higher, the leader
Balance off, the sign of a Libra

[The Prodigy Outro]

I'll take your brain to another dimension
