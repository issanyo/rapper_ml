Give me a bump and a hop out the whip
Girl what you drinking, boy give me a sip
I'ma get looser than you do and then do my voodoo
Then chill in the booth with your bitch
And that bitch don't have the cheap on
I don't know what drugs is she on
She gon' bring her friends and we go'n
Hand in hand that's word to reach on
I got the purp and the rizzilific
He wanna get sentimental with shit
Let's get this show on the road where the grass is the most
So you don't get no weeds on your lip

I was walking and talking
'Bout this bitch I met out in Boston
Who I didn't see very often but
Mmm-hmm Mmm-hmm
She gon' vote for Obama
And she likes to dance to Madonna
Chops an eighth just like Benihana, so
Mmm-hmm, Mmm-hmm
We gon' hop in this hoopty
And she'll take me out to the movies
Let me feel all up on her boobies, so
Mmm-hmm, Mmm-hmm
Now she's touching my booty
And she's rolling on a black beauty
I'm gon get-to, get to my duties so
Mmm-hmm, Mmm-hmm

[Bridge: Jake Shears]
One jock trick shows on the top when the jig's up
Come get your man, cause he on my block
We fly cause the nips don't slip
When they flick them flips da-da-dit
Cause the beats don't stop
My ice tea's your skeeze, his knees
I pop that cork in his face
Then I just say "Cheese!"
Got stacks, got chips, got G's
Watch it bubble up, double up
Baby, come snuggle up in the jacuzz
What cha know 'bout the rub-a-dub?

[Hook 3: Azealia Banks]
Why so tough
You see me running, but you can't keep up
So let me slow down for you
Baby what, say what ya looking for
I can give ya, give ya
