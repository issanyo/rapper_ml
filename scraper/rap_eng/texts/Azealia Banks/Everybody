[Verse 1: Elliphant]
Everybody got a nine
Everybody is a bad boy now
Everybody wanna shine
Everybody drink your champagne now
Everybody is the shit
Everybody is the big thing now
Everybody is the boss
Everybody rocking gold chains now

[Verse 2: Elliphant]
Ain’t nobody wanna work?
Ain’t nobody wanna open up?
Ain’t nobody wanna give?
Ain’t nobody wanna wrap shit up?
Ain’t nobody wanna fail?
Ain’t nobody doing real these days?
Ain’t nobody being true?
Ain’t nobody ever go my way?

[Chorus: Elliphant]
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 3: Elliphant]
Everybody wanna bite
Everybody want to pick a bone
Everybody gotta eat
Everybody think they are their own
Everybody can not win
Everybody want it fresh and fast
Everybody wanna fuck
Everybody think that time gon' last

[Verse 4: Elliphant]
Ain’t nobody wanna pay?
Ain’t nobody wanna clean shit up?
Ain’t nobody built the base?
Ain’t nobody reach the goddamn top?
Ain’t nobody looking here?
Ain’t nobody gonna leave this shit?
Ain’t nobody wanna say?
Ain’t nobody really know a thing?

[Chorus: Elliphant]
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 5: Azealia Banks]
I'll be sippin' lemon-lime
Got diamonds on my neck and wrist, hold me
I'll be really tryna chill
Tryna roll a little dope and just smoke it
In and out of deals
I ain't fucking with tha industry
All these bitches wanna steal
All these rappers wanna sleep on me
But I peel off in that Benzo
I'm shinin' when that camera click, nigga
Was poppin' with that shit today
Is you really, really finna trick, nigga
Cause you know I'm major overseas
And I'm way too hot for TV
Verse flock and clock like a seed
They better all tryna beat me!

[Chorus: Elliphant]
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Bridge: Elliphant]
To not be just not anybody
Everybody be somebody
Oh-oh, eh eh eh, oh-oh
To not be just not anybody
Everybody be somebody
Oh-oh, eh eh eh, oh-oh

[Outro: Elliphant]
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh (Everybody got a nine)
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Everybody wanna shine)
Woah oh oh oh (Everybody is the shit)
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Everybody is the boss)
Ain’t nobody wanna work?
Ain’t nobody wanna give?
Ain’t nobody wanna fail?
Ain’t nobody being true?
Woah oh oh oh
