NEEDSUMLUV (SXLND)

[Verse 1]
You don't really wanna leave her but you're tired of her
She know you don't love her either and you lie to her
But if I was her I'll be on ya day and night
I'd take back what's mine because your kind is hard to find

[Verse 2]
But if she ain't gon' be watching means you gotta skip
Skip to the lady with that Ohh because she well equipped
Forget your pride, let me free your mind
Let me get you high, boy I do just what you like
Cause I'm down for everything you need and who you are
And my door is always open and I'm never far
You are the star

[Verse 3]
You tell me the story bout' who was right before me
And how she became boring, you make her look so corny
You ain't in love with her but she still lives in your heart
But you be in my apartment, tearing me apart and
Jingling my jewelery, you don't know what you do to me
I feel like you be using me
I know that's where you choose to be
She stay where you choose to stay
Not tryna' make you choose today
I'm tryna' get you through the pain
I'm tryna' smoke this Buddha Babe
You know what's up
You said you need to roll another O
Because I'm here for a reason and you know what

[Outro]
I need some love, ohhh, I want some love
Oh I need some love, ohhh, I want some love
Oh I need some love, ohhh, I want some love
Oh I need some love, ohhh, I want some love , want some love
Oh I need some love, ohhh, I want some love
Oh I need some love, ohhh, I want some love
Oh I need some love, ohhh, I want some love
Oh I need some love, ohhh, I want some, want some love
