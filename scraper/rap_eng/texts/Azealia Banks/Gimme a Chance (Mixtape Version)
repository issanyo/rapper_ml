[Intro: Azelia]
Turn that shit up

[Verse 1]
I was on 145th up town on Lennox in Crown's trying to order some fries
And a bunch of rude dudes from the east side
Rolled up curb side looks like a drive by
But the dark skinned one hops out
No doubt any moment he might pull a trigga
Constructs, antiques and a wife beater
Look at those six packs on a nigga and
He got big hands big feet
Like a Size thirteen, dick must be bigger
Than my boyfriend's - yeah, I got a boyfriend
But I'll lay him off if you wanna get employed and
I would prefer guys into streetwear
But he toss bricks and he's running these streets here
Got knots like a pack of cheap weave hair
Gotta make a move so I step to a nigga like

[Hook: enon]
That's the way that our love can grow, make the play and then not to slow
??????????
Give me a chance (give me a chance), I will have to make you dance~ Make a play upon the dance floor, I'll be waiting there 'till knock the door

[Verse 2: azealia banks]
Lets peruse the essentials a dude
A brief study of the bitch every nigga should persue
To make 'em feel flyer than coming out a cacoon
Will interlude in the nude and make a nigga some food
This is to allude to the dudes in soho
But I stay hood for the niggas and they solo
So i keep the booty in nudies, the 14 inch
In the doobie, a pack of piff by the boobies
I got the bud like rudy
Even white fellows wanna jump in the hot chocolate like marshmallows - get it?
I am delicious, so I cop them digits
Gas them up like civics
Then I hop like ribbit - yeah
Back to the back of the bus
I like king-size chocolate
Bars with nuts
And I got the ill sweet tooth
Couple cavities too
Hit a bitch up if you think you even need proof

[Hook: enon]
That's the way that our love can grow, make the play and then not to slow
And we can roll a fat bag, ... pass that kush. let me get it in
Give me a chance (give me a chance), I will have to make you dance~ Make a play apon the dance floor, I'll be waiting there 'till knock the door
