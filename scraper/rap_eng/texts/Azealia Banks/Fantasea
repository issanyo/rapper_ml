(Intro)
Close to the moon
Close to the moon
Close to the moon
Oh so close to the moon
Close to the moon
Close to the moon
I wanna take you so close

(Verse 1)
A passion for life fantastic
Nest egg in a gold basket, next to go
Ima hug kiss the good life, X n' O
Hey, feel better than X and Blow
Get high from myline turn text to notes
Get these niggas gassed up like Texaco
Watch your bitch pop like Pepsi Co
Ever since I was an embryo
Had magic flow, young dynamo
Young killa, young illa with the finer flow
Young rapido, never will, never half a ho
Came to celebrate and have a toast
Young sis livin' fancy - yo

(Chorus)
Boy me and you, oh
So close to the moon
If it’s okay-ay for you
Close to the moon
And I wannna take you so close
Tryina say I’m here for the fantasea
I'll be, your fantasea
I'll be, your fantasea
Take you close

(Verse 2)
Fast forward live half your life
No wrong cause the cash was right
Have a bitch blink twice like hazard light
More than a great way, pass suffice
Non believers all asinine
Burning people like Fahrenheit
Round the world like Satellite
Baby girl got, baby girl got options right
PJ to the PH, pass the light
Far from the passive type
I excite your life and that's it
Better than your average
Status, Captain mother ship to the bliss imagine
Everything you want, you can have it
Trip, trip, trippy on the magic
Do you really, really want the access?
Of the Phoenix, fire and the ashes
Coin' in the Cash in
No Quota, No Ration
Numbers on the masses, wonders of the na-tion
Anything you want is established
Anything you want you could have it

(Chorus)

(Music Interlude)

(Bridge)
So close to the moon
If It’s okay for you
Oh so close to the moon
Oh so close to the moon
And I wanna take you so close

(Spoken Section)
Life is a series of choices
What you eat, how You Look
Whether you do drugs or not
See only you can decide because the only person responsible is you
And if you make the right choice, theres nothing you can't accomplish
If you make the wrong choice, all your decisions will be made for you

(Bridge x2)

(Chorus)
