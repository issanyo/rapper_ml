I'mma  give it to you now nigga
Of course I got the crown nigga
Just to bow down or fight another round
Since you off off the ground nigga
How you gon block the mission?
My steeze got you boo leville
Them lames been reviewed those winnas by a flute
Since you lose once you cross the vision

Don't cross the vision
Nah, don't cross the vision

Take a breather take a easer
Work from the roost like Santeria
Shoot for the loop betta ante up
This big boss talk  or we count the re up
You can see that we up
Spin that thing tell them relup relup
Beehead queens I'mma kelup kelup
Then strut like what with my tea cup tea cup

Keys open this, head
Believers in this, real
We reminisce back into a time
When we tease with a kiss
Play, at your own risk
I'm master on this
Fantastical hit
I'm Point Guard with this
I pass and assist
I'm bad that new bitch
They basketball tricks

You mad, cause I'm snatch back DUECE
You mad, cause a caboose Too juice
You mad? you mad? , you mad ?

Get up get up
Pump pump
Get up get up
And cunt what what
Get up get up......

[Britney Spears]

Break it up
Break it down
See me coming
You can hear my sound
Tell somebody in your town
Spread the word
Spread the word

Go call the police
Go call the governor
I bring the trouble
That means the trouble y'all
I make it bubble up
Call me the bubbler
I am the bad bitch
The bitch that you'll never know

Hold your head high
Fingers to the sky
They gon' try to try ya
But they can't deny ya
Keep it building higher and higher
Keep it building higher and higher

So hold your head high
Fingers to the sky
Now they don't believe ya
But they gonna need ya
Keep it building higher and higher
Keep it building higher and higher

Work work work work work work work work (Work!)
