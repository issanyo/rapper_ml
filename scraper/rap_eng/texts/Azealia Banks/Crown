[Verse 1]
Chance you've seen her once in a dream
Let me show you better, bring you closer to see
Can you undress her down to her lingeries
Run your fingers through the middle while I smoke potpourri
Got champagne spilling on the sofa, the seats
Looking cocaine dealer white - a code for the key
Hit em' with the venom
With the cobra, the squeeze
And I really wanna wrestle with the boa in ya jeans
I look at you
Look at us, look at me
Got a vision of a lovin'
That we both wanna see
Shouldn't I, wouldn't I
Couldn't I be your lucky lady f-forever f-f
Come on

[Hook]
When I'm repping this crown
I be stepping in style
I be breaking it down
Doing feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm repping this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in town

[Verse 2]
Mami on a mint Kawasaki in the Chlo√© khaki
Issey Miyake, folding yen with Miss Origami
I'm a global bitch, you a local thotty
I be, I be in a Paris lobby
Playing Tamigotchi, who Pocket Polly?
Hop to Mali, sisters in Bali
Get the picture, papi, get richer mami (Uh)
It really ain't fair
You see me, you see me, you stop and you stare
Finessing and flair
You see me I'm sexy, them bitches they jealous
I step in the room and I'm breaking your focus
I bet you your fellas be checking up on it
I jump in the Rover, I rip up the road
And I'm ready, I'm naked
I'm knocking, now open up

[Bridge]
And once you find out what I'm talking 'bout
You'll never be lonely
You see the stars and the clouds up above you
And baby no one will ever, ever love you like I do
(Yeah)

[Hook]
When I'm repping this crown
I be stepping in style
I be breaking it down
Doing feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm repping this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in town

When I'm repping this crown
I be stepping in style
I be breaking it down
Doing feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm repping this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in town

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Hook]
When I'm repping this crown
I be stepping in style
I be breaking it down
Doing feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm repping this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in town
