[Full lyrics available upon release of the song]

[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
Ladies and gentlemen, cinnamon, feminine
Got plenty of flavor
I'm popping and non-stopping and
Keep dropping that paper
This popular chocolate confidence
I'm blocking them haters
I'm opulence, prominent, time for this
Gun pow to the blazer

[Chorus 1: Azealia Banks]
Got liquor on the pour
Throwing money on the floor
Pussy swinging from a pole
Gotta pick it up and go
Got your nigga on the phone
Bet you bitches ain't know
Got liquor on the pour
Throwing money on the floor
Pussy swinging from a pole
Gotta pick it up and go
Got your nigga on the phone
Bet you bitches ain't know

[Verse 2: Safaree]
Yo, Teflon on the vest
Pump in the trunk in the tech
Hoes really thot for a check
Niggas wild for respect
Pull off the lot in the S
Scooped up your bitch now it's off to the jet
Go, let me see your thighs and your breasts
Better yet, make this a bet
Putting list on the set
Slide into style, when it's wet
Ménage à trois [?]
I'm that gentleman, [?]
Quick with that trigger hands
[?] man
Who the fuck wanna ride?
[?] 45
[?]
[?] for the crown, now [?]

[Chorus 2: Safaree]
Got liquor on the pour
10 carats on the lobe
Yeah, nigga got hoes
New pussy on my phone
Gettin pussy on the go
She got a pussy made of gold
Got liquor on the pour
10 carats on the lobe
Yeah, nigga got hoes
New pussy on my phone
Gettin pussy on the go
Bet you bitches ain't know

[Verse 3: Azealia Banks]
Back to the boom boom bass
Little bit of booze and a chase
Wiggle when I move and I shake
Lady snake, dominate
Jigglin the boobs in ya face
Hit the perico with some old niggas
Mm, mm, aye
Jimmy Choo shoes in the safe
Two chopsticks on the plate
True to the game
Roof off the coupe in the day
