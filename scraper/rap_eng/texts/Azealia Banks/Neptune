[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
More breeze in your hair, huh?
It's the one that your bleep took a chance on
Dan-ger the bitch that grease with the champion
Looking for my nigga my feast is the phantom
Phantom the sis, that young bitch, a kiki
"Bonita with the plum," with the cheeky
Chillin' with some killers, it's rum and dashikis
I'mma get 'em, get 'em to come hit the repeat
One!

[Chorus]
Baby, you 'bout it
Baby, you know
Can I turn you out here?
Can I turn you on?
Tell me now what is your fantasea
Can I hear about it?
Tell me what you need

Baby, you 'bout it
Baby, you know
Can I turn you out here?
Can I turn you on?
Tell me now what is your fantasea
Can I hear about it?
Tell me what you need

[Verse 2: Shystie]
Hey yo mister come whisper
Hey what's your sign, tell me all da shit ya into
We can make your ex girl real-real pissed
Ticking off your wishlist, can you feel-feel this
I'm the type of girl yo mama warned ya about
Stop fucking with your head, blow your brains all out
Tell me what you like, me a real bad gyal
Give it to you good, make ya head turn mad now
I'm not vanilla or a cinnamon sticks, still be killing it bitches
I'm on my liquorice shit 'til the niggas be getting stiff
Like rigor mortis , riga-rigamortis, dip it, dip it on his lips
We could take flights to the West Indes
Take a dip ina dis seas where them mermaids be
Sip ah lickle bita rum right under the trees
Tell this London girl, what's your fantaseas, boy?

[Bridge 1]
In fact cat
Know I been bad, and you know
I-I I'm trying (I'm trying, I'm trying)
To give that cat to ya, kit-kat all night night
All night (all night, night)

[Chorus]
Baby, you 'bout it
Baby, you know
Can I turn you out here?
Can I turn you on?
Tell me now what is your fantasea
Can I hear about it?
Tell me what you need

[Bridge 2]
I'ma sweat you, I'ma go out my mind
I'ma lead and conceal my pride
I pretend you are on my isle ay night
I ain't even gon' even lie
Boy ya know ya st-stay on my mind
Can I wet you up?
Baby you know
Am I sexual enough?
Can I wet you up all night?

I don't wanna play with your time-time
Tonight
Alright, alright
Alright, tonight, ahaaa

[Chorus]
Baby, you 'bout it
Baby, you know
Can I turn you out here?
Can I turn you on?
Tell me now what is your fantasea
Can I hear about it?
Tell me what you need

Baby, you 'bout it
Baby, you know
Can I turn you out here?
Can I turn you on?
Tell me now what is your fantasea
Can I hear about it?
Tell me what you need
