We gon' do something
That yo've never heard before!

[Verse 1]
These public pool bitches
Ain't really mermaids
Private beach Malibu, nigga!
Weave up in the shade
How do you? Hardly figure
That you that other wave?
She party pretty
She party plenty
It's like everyday
Documentary, will film the picture
Itâ€™s a fantasea
Get another, pitcher (of) liquor
Off that tanqueray
Okay, celebrate, let's celebrate
That aquababe, sashay
Boulevard, Runway
Bitches, witness bitches
They've been afraid
These nigga's bitches be bitches
They smellin' of fish and eggs!
She sell the bigger, the bigger
Difference gave it all away
Seashells on my two ta-tashies
See she got it up on display
Hooray!

[Verse 2]
We knockin'
Got it poppin' like a parade
Your opinion is just a option
Fucker what you say?
I'm looking like, I look right
Niggas look-a-ways
I pop 'em, clap 'em, cock 'em, blam 'em
Let the choppa spray
The brolic Madame
The chunky clunky, 3-8
Trust me you don't want that
Rusty, rowdy piper, okay?
Okay, okay, huh?
(Okay, okay, huh?)
(Okay, okay, huh?)
(Huh? Huh? Huh?)

[Verse 3]
Cinnamon: gentlemen
Want that kind of taste
I be killin' 'em, killin' 'em
Like murder everyday
When Azealia
The AB is on display?
I hit you, split you
Lift you, dip you
Get up out the way
The niggas is swank
My bitches is stank
All these chickens
Out for dollars
All they get is the franks
The linens is blank
The middle is pink
He gon put that snorkel on
We gon dip in the tank
I'm focused
I floated out the bluest ocean
To splash on your set, honey
Get the ships in motion
Bitches seasick
These bitches be opposing
Bitches see me
Yes, these bitches be all open
You don't want it
No you don't really want it
I'm drownin' all on my haters
And surfin'  in the moment

(Swimming in all this paper)
(Back, strokin' hundreds)
(Swimming in all this paper)
(Back, strokin' hundreds)

[Verse 4]
The chitter-chatter
Don't really matter
You silly rabbit
That could get'cha
G-get'cha get'cha
Your carrot splattered
All linens, fabrics
I'm diving backwards
And livin' lavish
Aqua-fancy
She get it, splash it
Then dip it back in

Ha, ha
