[Verse 1]
Back to the base, cocoa candy, fella's wanna taste
All these niggas want cream and a shake
But do you got the cream for the cake?
Peeped you pullin out the pape, tell me what it taste
Do you wanna be with a babe?
Keep away, running it away
Keep away, running it away
Hey, keep calling my name while you’re holding my frame
You know what I’m saying
Nigga do this spring fling
Chitty Bang Bang
With this pretty young thang
I'm the realist in the game, spillin' Champagne,
Got the ticket I’m game
Wicked Witch from 55th, broadway

[Hook]
She claiming uptown then she bring it down right
You take it up, up, then break it down, like
You strut your stuff and he wanna pound, right
You shake it up, then you shimmy down like ..

[Verse 2]
Shift my hips, left to the right, - aye, this shape looks better in the light
You can sip if you like
Chocolate deluxe, taste yummy on the tongue
Got your hunny on the hunt
Got your hubby in the front, winner of the bucks
It was never bout' the lust
The x and the o’s, the exes and hoes
I exit and ghost, no escape through the goal
You shake when the pressure’s exposed
I’ma, I’ma, I'mma make it and know
I’ma, I'ma, I'mma take it and grow
I’m from harlem, what’s an eighth to an o?
What’s shake to a pole
What’s bait for the boa

[Bridge]
Shimmy, shake it and keep it rollin'
Rotate it, circle it, and shift it and keep it going
Now you made it, and now he know it
Your shake’s the favorite, and now they want it
Shimmy, shake it, and keep it rollin'
Rotate it, circle it, and shift it and keep it going
Now you made it, and now he know it
Your shake’s the favorite, and now they want it

[Hook]
She claiming uptown then she bring it down right
You take it up, up, then break it down, like
You strut your stuff and he wanna pound, right
You shake it up, then you shimmy down like ..

[Verse 3]
Clap to it, I’m back to it, 212 it
It’s that knew it, that bad view, that half doin'
Yo eyes glued, on my view, better behave
Better maintain, or you’re in my square
Licking my sway
Just look at my cake, just look at my shake
Certified top grade
Little ma I’m made, every time I ape
Every time I ace, I be on my taste
I be on my grapes, They be on my cake
Just give me my space, let me sip my shake
Mocho latte

[Hook]
She claiming uptown then she bring it down right
You take it up, up, then break it down, like
You strut your stuff and he wanna pound, right
You shake it up, then you shimmy down like ..

[Outrox2]
Whether it’s A-train, or A-list
A bad bitch be fast flippin' the cash quick
Now ain’t this, so Harlem you got ends
I pops in, if pop trippin' you pop spend
