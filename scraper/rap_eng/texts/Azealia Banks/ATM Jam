[Chorus: Pharrell]
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
Said you a bad ass bitch, a bad ass bitch
That thong get lost in a fat ass, bitch
I got racks, racks, racks 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
Said you a bad ass bitch, a bad ass bitch
That thong get lost in a fat ass, bitch
I got racks, racks, racks 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do

[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
Thank you, darly
Buy the barry
I can admit I likes to party
I spent a grip, I swipes the cardy
When I heist, I'mma drips my pricey garmy (garment)
I'm the swami
Hyphy hip-cat
I'm "freaky-fit-that"
I could I could rrrrr-ip-pap
Ice on her wrist like high-sophis-chat
When I dyke with a bitch,-that's spicy! Get that!

[Chorus: Pharrell]
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
Said you a bad ass bitch, a bad ass bitch
That thong get lost in a fat ass, bitch
I got racks, racks, racks 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
Said you a bad ass bitch, a bad ass bitch
That thong get lost in a fat ass, bitch
I got racks, racks, racks 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Ayo P. Do that freaky jam on the beat
Iz you with that butter shit-that, that *bonne vie?
Did you divvy, did you double dig that?
That song sings- freaky deeky, whistle-wetter, slip that slit (that thong thing)
Hyphy-cheeky-cheddar-checker get her own cheese
That's a chicken w/ her head off
That's that bitch that won't be with her
Official with that with that whole steez
Flighty-fleety-feather-witch that whip that long weave nigga

[Refrain: Pharrell]
They shootin' in the parking lot
Everybody get low
They shootin' in the parking lot
It ain't where you wanna go
Now standby soldier standby soldier
And work it with the motherfuckin' ass like I told ya
Standby soldier standby soldier
And work it with the motherfuckin' ass like I told ya

[Verse 3: Azealia Banks]
Ice the berg, white’s the fur
Im's in the house, like nice suburb
Pipes on her pout, might pipe the purr
Peter pipe been about my pint for sure
Ims a mermaid, rhymes the Nurse
I'm little red ride, ride the verse
My shimmy-shake’s inside the shirt
Should a dyke and a gay guy try to flirt?
(laugh)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
I got racks, racks, racks til the ATM jam
Tell me what you gonna do?
I got racks, racks, racks 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you gonna do?
You a bad ass bitch, a bad ass bitch
A thong get lost in a fat ass bitch
I got racks, racks, racks 'til the ATM jam

[Refrain: Pharrell]
They shootin' in the parking lot -
Everybody get low
They shootin' in the parking lot
It ain't where you wanna go
Now stand by soldier, stand by soldier
And work it- whip that muthafuckin ass like I told ya!
Standby soldier standby soldier
And work it with the motherfuckin' ass like I told ya
