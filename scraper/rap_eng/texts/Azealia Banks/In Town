[Verse 1: Kevin Hussein]
(?) solo....In town
Midtown to Melrose, slipped down in ya night gown
Almost grown now
Showed up at new round
Can't turn down this (?) now
Debonair-air (?) the lux files
Urban and sincere I'm close by
I hope you're seductive in swimwear
You know why

[Chorus: Azealia Banks]
I don’t need you, I’ll spend time alone, do ya
Part or do you try when tides erode, ooh
How long do we (do I) can I hold on to us
Love will live and die and I remember once
What a freer time when I belonged to ya
Fallen tears, I am crying for you
I don’t need you, I’ll spend time alone - do ya?

[Bridge 1: Azealia Banks]
So, so you say you need time to be- alone?
Ay, hey you you
I'mma let you breathe
Boy, breathe....you

Tip toppa

[Chorus: Azealia Banks]
I don’t need you, I’ll spend time alone, do ya
Part or do you try when tides erode, ooh
How long do we (do I) can I hold on to us
Love will live and die and I remember once
What a freer time when I belonged to ya
Fallen tears, I am crying for you
I don’t need you, I’ll spend time alone - do ya?

[Bridge 2: Azealia]
So, so you say you need time to be- alone?
Ay hey you you, I'mma let you breathe
Boy breathe, boy breathe
Ay hey you you
Now you want to leave, don’t leave (don't leave)
No, stay stay, no no
Why you want to be?
Don’t be so cold to me

[Chorus: Azealia] (x2)
I don’t need you, I’ll spend time alone, do ya
Part or do you try when tides erode, ooh
How long do we (do I) can I hold on to us
Love will live and die and I remember once
What a freer time when I belonged to ya
Fallen tears, I am crying for you
I don’t need you, I’ll spend time alone - do ya?

Uptown from downtown
Fitted for crown cars
King Louis cinnamon, brown bod
Influence the sound god
Jig jig-setter, trendsetter, impound side
Send me to south-side, whoa
Site with the cool lines
Catch on my (?)
Peruser, straight kick-kick it like (?)
Four five ride through, smooth through Dubai
Who I? Cougar
Chill chill illy and frostbites
Big Will Wily the orca
Mill Mill milly and Motown

Tux and a bowtie
Nat King Cole on they court side
