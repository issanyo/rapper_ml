[Intro]
You are now listening to AraabMUZIK

[Verse 1]
Since Fantasea quenching your thirst
They want the mermaid bitch to water they verse
These bitches is bad, but AB is worse
These bitches is sad, but lately it works
I'm crazy with math, add me a purse
Plus you a hearse, minus that church
You dead on the first, divide from the jerks
Supply 'em with work
Fishscale, seaweed get ‘em higher than church
Taste me, saliva to squirt, hot lava
Erupt and a burst
Ain’t no bitch been better been birthed
The Luxury Witch, Galliano the skirt
From today I reign, tomorrow is hers
Pardon my curve, these basic niggas rattle my nerve
Why battle a bird? a Harlem girl flip ‘em
Bag 'em and sell
These niggas snitches, tattle and tell
Watch where you dwell, these niggas bitches
Hair braided with gel, the pussy I smell
Why these niggas push me? I get spooky as hell
You local fucker, I’m kooky with spells
These niggas suckas, be groupies as hell
Comment my hair, comment my nails
This nigga’s a girl, you want diamonds and pearls?
Designer clothes, attention and stares?
You’re a man though, why would you care? (Boy)
You’re not a fan though, cool off my air
My man ho, come jones on this dildo, while I pull on your hair
Yea, look at this queer
His booty prepared, your uzi is where?
Liar liar, never fuckin fire fire
Here’s a reminder, Hymen
Tru Life, stole all your chains? (Yes)
Max B, wrote all your flames? (Yes)
Montana, rode on your wave? (Bet)
Killa, called you a lame
It takes a Harlem bitch to execute a Harlem bitch
You pop shit, I pop shit, no problem bitch
