[Intro: Azealia Banks]
Give me, give me, another
Take me, take me, discover

[Chorus: Azealia Banks]
Give me, give me, another
Take me, take me, discover
Give me, give me, another
Take me, take me, discover the blue

[Verse 1: Rocky Business]
Deep in the ocean of addiction
Blue skin pale to the pain that's within it
Who's him? Another one lost to his religion?
Power to the ghost of the Christian
Pressure of restriction
Power to the most that resist it
Life of the tenant, color of a prison
Painted in the hues of a blue
A hard rock of domic, is within him
Just use all the talents that's forbidden
Battleground when you close to finish
Body is a host to a spirit
Nonchalant, master to apprentice
Ambiance, closer to a Kendrick
Victim that grows from that trenches
Nigga with a scope of the business
My nigga I'm the hope of the victims
Approach with a candle and an incense
Handling the ghouls and the henchmen
Third eye on hot noon like a western
My weapon!

[Hook: Azealia Banks]
Give me, give me, another
Take me, take me, discover
Give me, give me, another
Take me, take me, discover the blue

[Verse 2: Rocky Business]
Passion is a ice cold blue, imagine if I draw you
Catalyst a icon too, pattern designed by who?
A character who dies off soon?
Plot thickens up, at flower pot thickens up
At hours clock ticking up
Soul turns blue, right before the rush
Holiday for senses, can't tell the samurai bout the sensei
Can't turn a pussy into a pup, manipulate you up
Really afraid of a rush, renegades are front
Once you place motel food on the rush
Food to a once, system approved from the blues to the rock
Move from the tomb to the block
The muse not amused, you can say what you want
(You can say what you want)

[Hook: Azealia Banks] (x2)
Give me, give me, another
Take me, take me, discover
Give me, give me, another
Take me, take me, discover the blue
