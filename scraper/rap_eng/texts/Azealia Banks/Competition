[Intro]:
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)

[Verse 1]:
Okay, soon as I step in the club
I hit up the back, show my nigga some love
Hit the restroom up when I'm finished
I seen some bird I ain't seen in a minute
She's like "Banks, where've you been honey?"
What it look like bitch? Getting this money
Buying more clothes, I look nice right?
You be in that fake shit, and I seen yours twice
Your shoes, your weave and your purse
If you're bad, believe that I'm worse
You be online doing mad research
Tryna cop some shit she's seen me in first
Yeah, I make this way too easy
You can watch me more than your TV
Make sure she see, I'm the main bitch on the show like Mo
Y'all can't be missing

[Chorus]:
Cause I give all them competition
They don't even deserve my attention
And she can leave before her entrance
I don't give a fuck bout none of y'all bitches
(And I don't give a fuck bout none of y'all bitches)

[Verse 2]:
I wanna get drunk, I'm tryna get lit
I wanna get fucked, I'm tryna get picked
These bitches looking like they wanna get hit
Razor or the taser, take your pick
Feeling outspoken and I'm hoping you speak
Cause my homegirl hoping she can open your cheek
Think twice 'for you open your beak
Cause you can get buck fifty then your face'll be open for weeks
But that breaks no sweat, no key
Bitches always got my name up in they mouths like teeth
But they do treat treat in the chic boutiques
And her shoes and her brows look cheap
Baby girl hair so brown but her weave look black
Bitches on (?) cause I seen their tracks
Lip gloss caked up and her make-up baked up
Baby girl did you just wake up?
Bitches need to get their cake up
But these smuts got nut in the gut and it's so, so saved up
Real shit, she's the Krasdale version
Dust bunnies under rugs like Persian, but because

[Pre-Chorus]:
I'm here, and if you're popping that six shit
Bitch, I'm right here
We be sippin' and trippin', you know mine's clear
I would let you come toast but we don't like beers
No, no

[Chorus]:
Cause I give all them competition
They don't even deserve my attention
And she can leave before her entrance
I don't give a fuck bout none of y'all bitches
