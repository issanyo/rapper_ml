[Intro]
I see colors changing away
Every holiday is amazing with you
Happy holidays to you, baby

[Verse 1]
How do you feel about the pale moon and stars above?
All alone I anticipate the first fresh blade of green
The young hydrangea blue, in bloom
Pink rhododendron too will all be gone by June
But now that we have grown so near beneath the August sun
Lover of mine, let's catch some shade beneath the fading trees
Of all the seasons jewels, it took
One autumn afternoon to fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
The Benz is butter beige
I whip that Benz like "what a slay"
Got that good good
Make you wanna stay, home for the holiday
This that flow you been missing
Dashing young Vixen
Fly like Blitzen, back on my business
Ice on my neck, frosty and vicious
What's on your wishlist?
Got what you want, my love is like Christmas
Candles, kisses, diamonds, frigid, fashion district
Sip this witches brew, first class ticket to you
Fantasies come true when I kick it with you
In the winter wonderland when you hold my hand
Came back on the block where the guns go blam
We pick out the tree like Amsterdam, damn

[Chorus]
When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet
I need your love
I see you through my rosy colored shades
Sit on Santa's sleigh for me
Bet I'll keep you 'cause you're my cozy candy cane
We [?] all the same
I need your love
When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet
If I be yours and you're mine
Every other day will be a holiday for me and you
When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet

[Verse 3]
See lights in the night, you could feel it in the air
Party over here, we getting naughty over here
Santa Claus know I floss and shine, Rudolph
Talk - New York, style - catwalk
See me in the streets like "how much that cost?"
Can't keep up with the queen, baby, that's your loss
You know I get dough
Kiss from the lips under mistletoe
Now you in my spell, ringing up my cell, hitting jingle bells
It's the hot coco, not for show
Lock n' load, rock n' roll, I gots to go
Pack your shit, start the whip
Ride with me, fly with me
Keep it real but you could lie with me
And you ain't gotta say goodbye to me

[Chorus]
When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet
I need your love
I see you through my rosy colored shades
Sit on Santa's sleigh for me
Bet I'll keep you cause you're my cozy candy cane
We [?] all the same
I need your love
When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet

[Outro]
A doe, a doe, a deer anew, a fawn
A doe, the day, the dew, the dawn
What sort of déjà vu's upon us?
Wood blocks of A-B-C strewn through the hall
And gold champagne for two adorers
A song to celebrate our love
Red garland drapes the tree like you
When your arms are 'round my waist, I feel the world
Our love will grow and take us farther
Now I've a reverie of you and you're a
You're a ray, a view of sun
A star ablaze the moonlit water
