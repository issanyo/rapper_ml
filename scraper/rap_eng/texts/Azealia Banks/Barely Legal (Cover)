[Verse 1]
I didn’t take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama's runnin out of luck
Feel like my sisters, don’t give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it just don’t make any sense
Stranger manners, how I love em so
Why won’t you wear your new trench coat?

[Chorus]
I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain’t never had nothin I wanted
But I want it all
I just can’t figure out, nothing

[Bridge]
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Then he says, oh you’re a freak
He ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
For the record, just between you and i

[Verse 3]
I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
Oh, you ain’t never had nothing I wanted
But I want it all
I just can’t figure out (nothing)
