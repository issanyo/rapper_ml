In Excelsis, that's where you'll find me
Up above the rain cloud
Gliding past the blinding sunbeams

It's a new day, sky blue
Candle to flame, I'll burn your wick new

Little blue jay at my window, I've do it all day
Watch you far beneath the rainbow
Let me take you back to Excelsis
Up where all of the angels, stars and moon collide

Watching the days roll by me
Watching the time go by me
