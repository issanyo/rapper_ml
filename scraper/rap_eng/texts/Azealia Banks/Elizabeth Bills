[Intro]
The gangsta shit
I spit that murder, murder, murderous, mu-mu-mu-murderous hit
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
Believe it or not, the fever I got, I'm speakin' it hot
Don't peek in the pot, you seekin' them shots
For real will bank on ya block
Billionaire bitches, Oprah and lot
It's fresh out the box, the host on cock, uh
Provokin' the cops, assault on the watch, uh
The murder in hands this lady be firm, uh
Elizabeth Bills, 380 will burst, you play with my mills
It's curtains and kills, can't purchase my skills
These niggas in skirts and a kilt, truth
The verses like churches and hymns, uh
Don't cross, you will end up frost
Blue balls, you get sent up North
Dead dick, this puss done lost
Spit that gut-gut-gutta that gloss shit
That black bitch posted on that Forbes list
That money maker boss bitch
Meet me at my office
Plus, nigga, I'm gorgeous, ha haaa

I spit that uh uh
They wanna fuck with me, ha!

[Verse 2]
With real looks, nobody rep beauty like me
Look here look, nobody rep the city like me
Took a 1 to a A then I came up with 3
Took a A to the deuce then I came up with G's
Lit a A for that ooh, then I skipped to Ibiz'
What other bitch in the booth who could kick it like me?
A Wang boot, maybe color the weave
Everything that I utter, straight butter, believe
Yeah, the eight wonder is me, the ninth and the tenth
I'm about a dollar, where the fuck these bitches been?
Hypocrites'll holla, wanna play innocent
I know I got 'em straight fakin' for they friend
Easy breezy bitches just waitin' on they wind
Champion, Lady Dame, dominant
Niggas know the name, now the fuck acknowledge it

[Outro]:
I spit that, uh, uh
They wanna fuck with me, hah!
