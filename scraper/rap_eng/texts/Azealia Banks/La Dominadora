[Verse 1: AB]
Now!
I could pop the pussy like a cola-coka
Take the stick of bubble
If you ballin, bet em double
Bet the base, I'll break ya
I could make the call and get the
And getcha ace to snake ya
It's that primadona, diva don
Let's get that fuckin' cake up

[Bridge]
Look at that feminine switch
Look at her lickin' her lips
Look at that body, - my niggas they love me
I whip it in circles
They spend like they owe me
I get it, I get it, I get it
Bitches be all in they feelings
Got the game on lock, the illest and I run it
Niggas come about a dime a fuckin dozen
You could think ya hot, but who already done it
Bitches talkin shit but never got budgets
You know what it is
That's what it, that's what it is
Then fuck what it is
It's always official whenever I'm at

[Verse 2: AB]
Doin' - it propa
I flew in on a choppa
I pull up, I shock em
All my weaves colossal
This is sexy, persuasive
My house on 40 acres
I wake up, count cake, yup
That's million dollar pay stubs
Buncha lawyers and bankers
Email me my statements
Rubber bands, silver Lam
Hunnid grand in my Jacob
I see ya man, he a fan you a hater
You know Rih gettin' cash
Blowin' gas in the air
