[Intro]
Listen, listen, listen
I told you once, I told you twice
You're not on the list, alright?

[Hook]
What's a girl to do?
Boy, it's so sad to see you go
I wasn't out for you
Didn't have a plan to break your heart
All them regular dudes
Don't understand the reasons why
I don't do regular dudes
Don't need a man, don't need nobody

[Chorus]
All I want is to live in this world
Express my femininity
Learn myself more
And be free to explore my sexuality
All the girls if you're feelin' me
Find your bliss, spread your wings, live your life
Don't let no one get in your way girl

[Spoken Interlude]
Your name is not down, you're not comin' in

[Verse 1]
1, 2, 3
Now this that very ghetto acapello
Dinero, sport the season to date, my nigga
I been getting cheddar since whenever
Ever since quarters in piggy bank
Now it's pricey diamond, feisty niña
Icy diva, ¡ay que linda!
Hoops with a zoot suit, like Khadijah
Single life, single letter on my flight to greet ya
If you wanna pump that missile
You bitch better drip, better wet that whistle
It's still the young 21, bitch hungry on a hunt
For the chip, better flip that nickel
Fuckin' with the get 'em girl and the campaign gully
Spill that girl if you a champagne bunny
It's your world, live it up, it ain't nothin'
Spend that girl and keep the damn thing runnin'

[Spoken Interlude]
Listen, listen, listen
I told you once, I told you twice
You're not on the list, alright?

[Hook]
What's a girl to do?
Boy, it's so sad to see you go
I wasn't out for you
Didn't have a plan to break your heart
All them regular dudes
Don't understand the reasons why
I don't do regular dudes
Don't need a man, don't need nobody
Don't need a man, don't need nobody
Don't need a man, don't need nobody
Don't need a man, don't need nobody

[Spoken Interlude]
Your name is not down, you're not comin' in
