[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
The sure shot, miss sex pot, straight shooter
The best round, miss flesh brown, who bang beauty?
That brand newbie, my clan cutie who [?]
Off eight doobies and champagne, and pressed grapes
The best maid, the checkmate, the check mate
The best babe especially, I'm taste's state
The princess of pretty, the belle of the prissy, you dig me?
The moisture is plenty, you got nothing for me then get me
The pick of the litter, these bitches is bitter
Banksy is better, these bitches is dinner
Throwing my letter, Banks clearly the winner
Notice the grave on the breast
Scraping the plate
You know how I play

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Healer, winner, bring it back on rewind
There's no time to heal her, take her back, rock yo' spine
Pussy whore, talk your shine
I can see how we in great shape
Flatlining everything and this bitch is my taste's state

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yo
The boisterous bully with lyrics to master the creature
I chop up and get to you niggas like slicing a pizza
The cypher gets deeper
Yes, I line niggas up like a zebra
[?] diarrhea, niggas no lie it gets deeper than
Rhymes is a keeper
Bitch, we scorching it hot like a fever
Fuck what you talk, your bitch a thot and she'd like me to meet her
Cooked every boil up in the pot while the water will heat her
Smoking some OG in the drive while we blanket your street up
And basket your meat up
And throw away the auxs and casket your 3 up
And bury the boxes, my loose screw niggas
And let em freeze her (brrr)
Bitch, I demolish and disrespect niggas
Now fuck the responses that's how we do niggas

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Healer, winner, bring it back on rewind
Theres no time to heal her, take her back, rock yo' spine
Pussy whore talk your shine
I can see how we in great shape
Flatlining everything and this bitch is my taste' state
