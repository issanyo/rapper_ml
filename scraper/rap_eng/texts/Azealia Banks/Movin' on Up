[Intro]
Listen, listen, listen
I told you once, I told you twice
You're not on the list, alright?

[Hook]
What's a girl to do?
Boy, it's so sad to see you go
I wasn't out for you
Didn't have a plan to break your heart
All them regular dudes
Don't understand the reasons why
I don't do regular dudes
Don't need a man, don't need nobody

[Verse 1]
Keep checkin' it, clockin' it
Bitches be jockin' the hip hop phenomenon
I'm livin' life larger than Buddha
I'll freak him then leave him there in astonishment
My diamonds keep hoggin' it
Winter storm pilin', the kids all tobogganin'
I'm really hot lava lit
Put the pussy right on his dick, he won't get out of it

[Chorus]
All I want is to live in this world
Express my femininity
Love myself more
And be free to explore my sexuality
All the girls if you're feelin' me
Find your bliss, spread your wings, live your life
You're free to fly
All I want is to live in this world
Express my femininity
Learn myself more
And be free to explore my sexuality
All the girls if you're feelin' me
Find your bliss, spread your wings, live your life
Don't let no one get in your way girl

[Spoken Interlude]
Your name is not down, you're not comin' in

[Verse 2]
1, 2, 3
Now this that very ghetto acapello
Dinero, sport the season to date, my niggas
I been getting cheddar since whenever
Ever since quarters in piggy bank
Now it's pricey diamond, feisty niña
Icy diva, ¡ay que linda!
Hoops with a zoot suit, like Khadijah
Single life, single letter on my flight to greet ya
If you wanna pump that missile
You bitch better drip, better wet that whistle
It's still the young 20 somethin', bitch hungry on a hunt
For the chip, better flip that nickel
Fuckin' with the get 'em girl and her campaign gully
Spill that girl if you a champagne bunny
It's your world, live it up, it ain't nothin'
Spend that girl and keep the damn thing runnin'

[Spoken Interlude]
Listen now
I told you once, I told you twice
You're not on the list, alright?

[Hook]
What's a girl to do?
Boy, it's so sad to see you go
I wasn't out for you
Didn't have a plan to break your heart
All them regular dudes
Don't understand the reasons why
I don't do regular dudes
Don't need a man, don't need nobody
Don't need a man, don't need nobody
Don't need a man, don't need nobody
Don't need a man, don't need nobody

[Verse 3]
Throwin' a fit, he holdin' his dick                                                       Lick his lips, grab on her tits, then lap up clit
He wish he had her for keeps
All these bitches holdin' they seats, I'm holdin' the heat
Fashion police, bitches on some fashion decrease
I'll fashion a beat, bitch spit fashionably
It's magic you see, sis swam out of the sea
Partin' the weave, fish scales sparkle when I'm choppin' the ki
Chopper on me
Chop niggas down like I'm lumberin' trees
Dump the clip if a clown think he fuckin' with me
Break a bitch nigga down like he fuckin' for free

[Chorus]
All I want is to live in this world
Express the love that may live in me
Learn myself more
And be free to explore my sexuality
All the girls if you're feelin' me
Find your bliss, spread your wings, live your life
You're free to fly
All I want is to live in this world
Express my femininity
Learn myself more
And be free to explore my sexuality
All the girls if you're feelin' me
Find your bliss, spread your wings, live your life
Don't let no one get in your way girl
