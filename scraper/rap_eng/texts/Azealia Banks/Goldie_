[Full lyrics available upon release of the song]

[?] body, I whip it, I sell it
I'm watchin' them dollars, I'm [?]
Bitch, it ain't hard [?] I'm with it
Keep pumpin' 'em dollars, keep spendin'
I don't look for them broads, I don't give 'em no credit
'Cause a lot of them, lot of them jealous
Take a look at the store, keep your endless fetish
Keep droppin' them dollars, let's get it
They watchin' my body, I whip it, I sell it
I'm watchin' them [?]
