[Verse 1]
It would be so nice to take you
I only ever try to make you smile
No matter what, we're gonna keep you occupied
But only at your place
Only at your place

[Pre-Chorus]
It would be no price to pay
I only ever lie to make you smile
All kinds of dust are gonna keep me satisfied
But only at your place, only at your place

[Chorus]
Tonight, a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find the wrong way
Tonight, a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find

[Bridge]
It's over, it's over
I feel like, the feeling is like, it's over
Why is it so hard to stay away?
(Why is it so hard)

[Chorus]
Tonight, a special memory serves me
And I'll play to find that I'm gray
Tonight, a special
I only memorize those dates I deny

[Verse 2]
And I forget why we'll say
Let's seize the day
You won't have to say that you'd love to
But, baby, please, that you'd want to, someday

[Pre-Chorus]
It would be no price to pay
We began this, we began this our way
And I'll pay all live, now, we're saying
'Cause it would be no price to pay

[Outro]
You don't have to say that you'd love to
But, baby, please, that you'd want to
Someday
You don't have to say that you'd love to
But, baby, please, that you'd want to
Someday
You don't have to say that you'd love to
But, baby, please, that you'd want to
Someday
