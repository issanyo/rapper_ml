I be winnin', yes, I be, I be winnin'
These bitches talkin' but they ain't built for the scrimmage
At the entrance they callin' me the empress
The game's over, million dollar bitches listen
Don't forget it, that I be, I be winnin'
These bitches talkin' but they don't be what they livin'
Now they livid, yes, I be, I be winnin'
The game's over, uh, the door's open
For the challenge, drive with the mileage
I'm steady with the beam like Gabby I got the balance
Number one talent, sippin' from my chalice
Fantasea waters, deep in the hole like I'm Alice
Interview stage posted up in the seas like coast guards
Risin' over water, rose throne, I won't fall
Climbin' up the ladder to the stars, I'm on mars
Bad bitch, porn star, seashell gold bra
Chanel studded clutch, top down, deuce en garde
The pretty chocolate diva, the witch switch on y'all
This is how you freaky, that kinky shit on y'all
