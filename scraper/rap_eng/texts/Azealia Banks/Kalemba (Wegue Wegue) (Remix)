My face, my weave, my nails
My bag, my jeans, my shoes look perfect
You H&M hoodie, what's goodie
Bitches under my feet like the Converse surface
I keep more scales than a serpent
Do the real long shots where the work is
Dry denim Nudie jeans with a tight stitch
Back pocket full of snort for a white bitch
Only lady in the crew is me
But I got a batch of babies that'll shoot for free
[?] looking at her dude
Now she got an attitude
She thought she was fly
She ain't even in my latitude
Nigga stepping on my new suede loafers
Now I gotta piff her up with the testarossa
Put her in a toasta, swish her like a sandwich
Everyone know Miss Bank$ cause mad damage
