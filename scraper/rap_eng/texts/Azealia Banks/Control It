[Verse 1: Shystie]
I’ll run up on a brother, what's your age, what's your name?
Do you drive? What suit do you wear? Where’d you stay?
Do you stay with your mother, have you got your own place?
What car do you drive? Do you smoke, do you rave?
Let me get into your mind, let me fuck with your brain
Come fuck with your girl, I'm the best, what you saying?
I'm the best what you saying, what size is ya feet?
Is it just a myth? Let me judge, let me see
Yo, let me touch it up, hands on ya pants
Rubbing on your Woody Woodpecker, pecking out your pants
I'm a bad gyal villain, if I like, then I wanna
Homewreck your whole motherfucking house, cause I'm proper
Nah, I'm playing, my mother raised this chick better
Other bitches got the rabies
Other bitches on their back or on fours getting dick
They don’t even know his name, but getting new laces wigs
Brand new weaves all down to their butt
In exchange letting niggas put it deep in their gut, man
I just want a fella that can give it to me good
No two minute shoulda-coulda-would, listen to me boy
I just need a man with that good D game
Love brain, I ain't fucking with you lames
Spend all your money on me honey, whats ya range?
Look I just wana live life fast in these lanes, got a taste for it

[Pre-Chorus: Shystie]
You got a taste for it? Come and taste it
Strawberry milkshake all up in your face bitch
Slow down baby, we ain't even got to race
I just want to burst in your face, haha
Nah, I just want to have some fun with you dude
Sip until my rouge lipstick turns nude
Sipping on that swag juice, get us in the mood
What you saying? Can you-Can you come through?

[Chorus: Shystie]
Control it, work it, show me why you deserve this
Control it, work it, show me why, can you show me why?
Ooh, can you show me why?
Ooh, can you show me why?
Show me why, can you show me why?
Show me why, show me why?

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
I'ma show you what I want
Lick the bitch down and dick her from the front
Elicit details make a nigga "Ungh"
Bring a female, the bitch is getting done (done, done)
This is what you want?
You in the back, boy, and me up in the front?
Screams in the background, I've got the yummy yum
He calling me honey bun, he never follow up
You... You getting a dial tone
The brown loud bambi, lickin' his smile off
Tasty candy, this what you asked for?
Make a nigga spend all of his cash on..
Then all of his cash gone
Niggas know my name, never one to pass on..
Little bitch in the fast joint
The mermaid wave, chocolate water to splash on

[Chorus: Shystie]
Control it, work it, show me why you deserve this
Control it, work it, show me why, can you show me why?
Ooh, can you show me why?
Ooh, can you show me why?
Show me why, can you show me why?
Show me why, show me why?

[Bridge: Shystie, Azealia Banks]
Whats your flavor boy? Tell me now
Tell me can you, turn me out?
Are you really 'bout it 'bout?
If you are, then I'm glad I found you
Tasty candy, this what you asked for?
Tasty candy, this what you asked for?
Tasty candy, this what you asked for?
This what you asked for? This what you asked for?
Tasty candy, this what you asked for?
Tasty candy, this what you asked for?
Tasty candy, this what you asked for?
This what you asked for? This what you asked for?

[Outro: Shystie]
