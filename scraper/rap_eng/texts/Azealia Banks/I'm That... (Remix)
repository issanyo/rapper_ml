Step out to the big crew and bro dem boy no think ya about peacock
The last boy passing place boy passing place a load then they sit back

[Verse 3: Theron]
Yo, who's that man from Houzin, comin' and he never gon' stop?
Who's that man that come from nothing straight off of the block?
Who's that man that don't say nothing, don't talk to the cops?
Asking the man where they from, you don't know what we do say
We come from the rock! Rock
City's the name, me and you, we not the same
That's why we changing the game, simple and plain
Big man, you know that is weak
When you say "There goes ya chain"
When I was small, used to pick up girls in safaris!
Now I pickin' up punanis in Ferraris!

[Verse 4: Timothy]
When niggas hear you from a island
First thing that they think is you live on a beach
Grew up in the ghetto where they packin' metal
That will lift you off your feet
They be acting like they want some beef
Until you see 'em in the streets
And find out that they vegetarians
These haters never wanna meet
You should already know who it is
Dem Virgin Island boy
Who runnin' the game and doin' it big
You know what them call me
Timo, Timo, it's Theron brother, Timo
My father name me Timo
When you see me! (Call me Timo)

[Hook: Timothy]
Sim simma

Tick tick, blow up!

Who am I?
I'm that nigga!
Who am I?
I'm that nigga!
