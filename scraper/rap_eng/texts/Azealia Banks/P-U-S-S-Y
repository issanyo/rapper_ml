[Intro - Azealia Banks]
Hit it from the front
Hit it from the side (x3)
Drum this is hard I’m gonna slip and slide
(x2)

[Verse 1 - Azealia Banks]
I wanna see what you're all about
Can you let me ride the dick and keep a nipple in your mouth
Can you let me turn around without taking you out
Position my shit then bounce, pow
Weave smelling like shampoo
Don't be afraid, boy, grab a whole handful
I can do some things your girlfriend can't do
In a car or a hotel, yeah

[Hook - 77KLASH]
Gyal di way yuh pussy tight, mek yuh man treat yuh right
X-amount a loving tru di night
Gyal di way yuh pussy clean, you a every man dream
Hot body gyal, young fresh and yuh green
Gyal di way yuh pussy tight, mek yuh man treat yuh right
X-amount a loving tru di night
Gyal di way yuh pussy clean, you a every man dream
You know what I mean... zeeeeeen?

[Verse 2 - Azealia Banks]
This pussy is domesticated, well fed, and fat
Them other bitches got them alley cats
I be down for a Cudi but I ain't playing that
S-M-U-T, I'll never be that
I been a freak since '91
Used to get my ass squeezed on the line at lunch
So misbehaved in the 7th grade
Now who's jerking off to my MySpace page
Put a few pearls on my necklace, babe
I'm gonna squeeze and ride 'til you go cock-eyed
And I can suck a ten inch cock drier than a raisin
Brain is amazing, baby
Your insides are so luxurious
Weave long, got the white man curious
Angelica Pickles got nothin' on me
I'm mean from the feet to the stitching in the weave

[Hook - 77KLASH]

[Bridge - Azealia Banks]
I get sauce like pasta, smoke like a rasta
Let 'em pet the kitty kick 'em out right after
Niggas like Pokémon, I gotta catch 'em all
Like I'm in the Amazon, look at how the rain fall
Suck, fuck, roll up the dutch
Smoke, toke, put on ya coat
Get like a blunt Zilla and roll out quick babe
Before I stick it to your back like duct tape
I keep 'em like more Ovaltine please
AZB sweeter than a bumblebee
I do the right thing like Spike Lee
And send this nigga right back to his wifey
