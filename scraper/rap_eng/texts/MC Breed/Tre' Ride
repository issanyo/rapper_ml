(Intro)
Bounce the Tre'
Bounce nigga, bounce nigga, bounce the Tre'
Bounce nigga, bounce nigga, bounce the Tre'
I said bounce the Tre', I said bounce the Tre'

(Verse 1)
It's a fly day, a hot July day, in the Y-O's
Bounce or fly your Tre' straight out the driveway
Bouncin' in the sunrays, going one way, flossin' in the ride
I hit a left, then popped in the cassette
Of the bounce-rock skate, and blast it as it
Gets much hotter I just gotta gain...
One of these so called Don-Dada's
That's starin' me up & down, I say what's up and clown
Coz I get around
Like my nigga Pac do, and once I start
Wiggling my thing back and forth I've got you
(back, back, forth & forth)
Hypnotised, and uh, Mesmorised, but uh
Nigga get your eyes (wide)
Cause I'm comin' out with the mighty flow, so now you know that uh...

(Chorus - MC Breed)
It's a fly day to twirl them D's
On the W-E-ST-I-D-E
Rocks stay high, rollin' in my Tre' ride
It's a fly day to make some G's
On the W-E-ST-I-D-E
And I'mma stay fly, bouncin' in ma Tre' ride

(Verse 2)
And it goes one to the deuce to the tre' to the four
Just I told you Yo Yo's your
Gene of amazing female... I lay in the Tre', cause I know
I've got the bomb-shit, that you feen for
I've got the bomb-shit, that you lean for
I've seen your Coupe and I'm just not impressed
You can keep your double S, cause my Tre' is double fresh
And I get much love, from the Westside, Westside...
And I bet I... can hit three wheel motions straight to the ocean
Me and my homies straight coastin'
Toastin' the glass in the air, so pre-pare
For Y-O's fly flow, oh yeah
And I'mma keep my ride on this side of LA
And I'mma bounce nigga, bounce nigga, bounce my Tre'

(Chorus)

(MC Breed)
What side, nigga, ride, westside (x8)
Get it right...

(Verse 3)
Now I'mma swerve to the top
And press all you niggas hangin on the block
Come around the corner and let the ass drop
C'mon and let me rock, c'mon and let me rock
Well it's the green eye, you see I lean fly
In the cut, so what's up with the mean eye
Mad doggin' me cause I got the fly anus
Sparklin' D's, with ??? gold ???
Chillin' in the hood I'm the centre of attention
Sixteen switches controlling my suspension
So, uh, which way you want me to dip it?
Front to the back? Or just plain kick it?
And if it's a hot summer's day
Then you might catch a galnce of the Y in her Tre'
Bounce, nigga, bounce

(Chorus till fade...)
