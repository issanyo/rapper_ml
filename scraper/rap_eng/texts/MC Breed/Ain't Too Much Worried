[ Night & Day ]
I ain't much too worried about the past
(Past)
Worried about the past
(Yeah
That's the way I like it
Laid back, just like that
Now what that music feel like?)
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ VERSE 1 ]
Growin up in Flint, I went to Gundry Elementary
A Little fat kid who ain't have shit, lived on Lorado Street
Don't get me wrong, cause we was far from po' though
But up-to-date tennis shoes was far from affordable
A runaway, well, that describes me best
Cause if things ain't go my way, it was time to jet
I ran back and forth from my mom's to my pop's house
And by the 9th grade I was a high school drop-out
15 and my life done went bad
By this time I was livin with my dad
Not thinkin 'bout what's goin on in life
And if I have to carry a gun or a knife
Will I have to use it, if so, then it's on
I never had a girlfriend to call my own
So what I'm seein now I'm really hopin it'll last
But if not - hah, I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ Night & Day ]
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now my old man, yo, he doesn't say much
He works every day and fiddle-faddle with his truck
And when I went to school he was home in the bed
But when I came home, he was up gettin fed
Now people, don't trip, see, my pops never hang
But I can tell you this: that he is up on the game
Seven in the morning, I'm dressed in my Levis
Headed for school with my nigga, my nerve, T-Ray
Reached into the room and got my dollar off the dresser
Knowin when I get to school I get ganked for the rest of it
Huh, I saw an apple on the table, had to get me one
Threw on my Crew hat, the first kid in Flint with one
Me and T-Ray walkin up Dupont
All I'm thinkin about is skippin, that's what I'll probably do
But it really don't matter, nowadays it won't last
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ Night & Day ]
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
(I ain't too much worried 'bout the past)
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ VERSE 3 ]
So now I got a baby and a baby on the way
As long as me and both of the moms are cool, I'll never have to pay
It's not what I bargained for, but it's what I've bought
And if I have to pay child support, I'd be my fault
But I ain't the type to get uptight and fighting things
I'm tryin to be like Spike and 'do the right thing'
I'm never ridin dirty nor negotiatin kilos
Me and Pop Breed and Al Capone, we ride in trio
Coolin in the Cherokee, them girls hollerin "Eric Breed"
Puffin up on the dank, cause I ain't messin with no generic weed
I'm in the world, I'm tryin to make a livin, son
We need money, and ain't nobody givin none
My own boss, I'm workin at my j-o-b
No more kids and no more women playin me
And as long as I keep my mind on straight, I'm gon' last
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ Night & Day ]
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
(Huh, nah...)
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
(I ain't too much worried 'bout the past)
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
(I ain't too much worried 'bout the past)

Past tense...
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past
Past tense, nonsense
Past tense, nonsense
Past tense...
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past
Yo

In '95...

But right now I want you to enjoy this
Cause in '95 - believe me
Your boy Breed, I ain't too much worried 'bout the past
I'm outta here
