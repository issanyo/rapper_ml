Work it out!!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
We off the chain
Love to swing (who that)
Rap Game
Do your thing
Even if it means flip bricks
Even if it means hitting licks, we stack chips

[Verse 1]
What up though, bout to put a lock on the dance floor
My game got game and it easily provoke yours
Believe it, Breed been official
Ceritified grade A Michigan figure (go figure)
Whether in the block or in the river
Like my collar pops all By itself with a double shot
For the players, Women getting paper y'all
Do the damn thing and change on them later listen
I'm here to tear up the club like three six all on the floor
Like Thats My Hiiiit
Or like a junkie with a fix, nonstop and if it ain't poppin' I'm piiiisssed
I'm the original numero uno big Breed
All I do is club and smoke ooo wee if I doze
Thinkin that I can't come up pimp chill It's still very difficult to touch with

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a cold piece, dog with no leash
Fresh off the streets and hotter than a four piece
Big talking, people C walking hitting
Harder than Jordan can get the front row coughing
I turned it out
You ain't gotta let me let the bass drop heavy
So I can chase feri my nig
Club hopper pop cone doctor
B-R double E-D rap stara you dig
I got it in me hella flowing never empty
The club get it quick spin it like a 20
Put your cell on vibrate and girate with it
Put it on and hit the highway with it yea
Starting to get packed, line getting longer
Time getting shorter my drink gettin stronger now
Keep it real and keep that fake stuff on standby
Gas up the ride and go hit seventy five

[Hook]
