[Intro]
Yea it's goin down for real now
It's your boy Breed and Prozak yea and Bootleg
This pain is going on inside me so what you know about us? (2x)

[Verse 1: MC Breed]
There's seven steps to my attic follow me in
Keep it simple like a violin
Fall in the pit- and then you try again
Try again for thinkin your shit can win
Cuz you a star livin in the monetary art
Till ten white uniforms break your jaw
Got you twisted, we had a real king but missed it
With all these trigga happy niggas actin like bitches
I'm sick, it got me fed up with shit
That's on the real you suckin on my skill like a dick
I ain't your family and you can't damage me
You know what I listen to your rap style and throw up
No blow up and show no real potential
You fake, but you got an instrumental
Now with this, let us redefine this word bitch
Cuz all these bitches I know they got dicks!

[Hook x4]
Bitches ain't shit, the scripts been flipped now
(Ya'll bitches ain't Shit!)

[Verse 2: Prozak]
We flip the script and bustin shots
Bustin clips and bustin Glocks
Bodies broken and fallin from brawlin
Niggas crawlin
Revenge and retaliation, mass murder extermination
No frontin' in your future, this 12 guage you're facin
I'm thinkin about the fact my mind is gone
Plottin battle plans like the Pentagon rockin it til the break of dawn
I'm knockin mother fuckers down like the twin towers
Me and Bootleg and Breed causin death showers
Still venemous with the flow Prozak's about to blow
Cock the hammer back let it go, get my dick sucked at the show
Enemies all engulfed in flames ,shotgun cocks when I blow your brains
911 when I inflict the pain, when I diss I say no names

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bootleg]
I know that you jealous of me and my fellas you traitors
Bootleg's the storm that was born to crush all of you haters
So no hesitatin we eliminatin on Dayton
Follow my path in shadows and blood like Satan-
The year was 1992 when we were screamin fuck cops
Summertime, we on the grind, what's on my mind just dropped-
All I need is 1 mic- 2 dykes- 3 drinks and more-
Don't hate me bitch I done said that before!
Gettin tired of the okey dokey
Disrespect me in anyway I'll bust at your mama while she at kareoke
Cross Prozak once, and you'll die twice-
Fuck it, let me whipe my ass with your life...
Cuz bitch you ain't shit!!!

[Hook]
