[Chorus]
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)

[Verse 1: Eightball]
Time for me to smoke, blaze a spliff of hay
Got no time for the stress so don’t bring it my way
I’m the god of smoke, the almighty chiefer
Roll another spliff so I can make you a believer
Choke as I smoke as I reach for my 4-O
Beeper going off but my weed come before hoes
Mary Jane, I’m in love with this hoe
Ain’t no pussy in the world that can fuck with that indo
First, take a blunt, cut it down the middle
Why do I smoke blunts? ‘Cause papers are too little
Fill it to capacity, lick ‘em up and stick ‘em up
Dry it you’re your lighter then fire it up and take a puff
Straight to a nigga’s brain, that’s what  made me a junkie
It keeps my head bobbin’ to whatever sounding funky
If I was down with Nancy Reagan, I’d say no to drugs
But I’m in Orange Mound with the pimps and killer thugs
All my niggas drink ‘gnac and smoke hella weed (Really?)
Well, t-Money is the only nigga drug-free
But me, I’m like an Energizer battery
Still smoking and smoking and smoking and smoking…

[Chorus]
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)

[Interlude]
Can I be a funk junky? (Yes, you can)
Can I be a funk junky? (Of course, you can)
Can I be a funk junky? (Yes, you can)
Can I be a funk junky? (Of course, you can)
Come on, can I be a funk junky? (Yes, you can)
Can I be a funk junky? (Of course, you can)
Can I, can I be a funk junky? (Yes, you can)
Now can I be a funk junky? (Of course, you can)

[Verse 2: MC Breed]
Check it out, uh
Now my daddy told me, “Boy, don’t be swinging on your own nuts”
But, my nuts are the only nuts that I have to own up to
So what in the fuck is a nigga to do
When I make more money when I’m hanging with the crew?
Now I’m like, um, hell yeah, open up the door
‘Cause it’s the B-R, we are comin’ at you once more
With this ill flow, real flow, light another joint so
Me and my niggas can straight to the point and anoint
Any muthafucka who wants to be down and see
It’s so many niggas wanna be G’s now
Freeze froze and close doors on those
Wannabe pros knowing that they hoes
‘Cause it’s Breed with the funkdafied fried lied laid to the side
Pass the joint and I’m tired type shit
Split me a blunt and fill it up with dank
Don’t ask me if I’m smoking, what the fuck you think?

[Chorus]
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)

[Verse 3: MJG]
Give me a chance to enhance on this muthafuckin’ reefer
Let me teach a young bitch how to smoke ‘til she choke
One puff got her fiendin’ for a whole sack
Can’t hold back on the indo and don’t try to pretend no
Nigga ain’t ever had the tip of his blunt in your nose
About to let the smoke roll
Baby, I’m a 24-7 bud smoking poet
You should know it ‘cause the red in my eyes show it
King Edward of the hood
Quarter-pound toting, big smoking going on in the Backwoods
I got the mask, Breed got the bomb
Ball got the chief and the liquor it’s reached
And we each got love for the Capital W
Double-E-D as we talks to the industry
80 Proof in my hand as I stand
Gotta go to the wall ‘cause I think I’m ‘bout to fall
After all this getting fucked up
Nigga still got a pound in the closet and a halfway-full cup
So what’s up with the worldwide bud lovers?
Smoke one with the sesshead funk brothers
Step right up, son, hit me with a shotgun
But buckle up, you’ve gotta take one to give one
And that’s the way it gotta be
MJG, full of that muthafuckin’ sess tree

[Chorus]
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
