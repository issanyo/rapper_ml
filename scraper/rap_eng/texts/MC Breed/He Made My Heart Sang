Intro: Quala D

Yeah, it's the Q-the U-the A-the L-the A-the D 'n'....
Tellin you about how I caught a crush once upon a time ago
Yeah, you wanna hear it?
I wrote a song about it, here we go....

Verse 1:

I first saw him in the back by the bar
Nope, come to think he was just steppin out his car
Seen him in dining at the court wit some Miss
Don't jock him, I sweat him girl cos don't you know that he's a jokester
Don't you know I couldn't do it
I had to hunt, I had to what? I had to hunt, I had to prove it
To myself, hurry up and move the line!
Nine times outta ten, a ho done dropped the dime
Uhh, about the cutie in the bizzack, straight gangsta Mrza
Pockets bulgin out because he's busy
Tall, slim, lanky like Snoop
And both ears hang two gold hoops
The kind of guy that teases ya, he'll make ya beg for more
And if he goes downtown, ???? ???? ???? ????
And then I started hearin crazy little thangs
Oh my god, the honey made my heart sang

Chorus:

Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
He made my heart sang
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
He made my heart sang
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah

Verse 2: Quala D

My hands got all cold 'n' clammy
Other chicks around they couldn't understand me
They couldn't believe that it was love at first sight
Brother man looked MMM MMM MMM, good enough to bite
Lashes like 2PAc, murder one like Onyx
You knew I had the jock, right?
All of a sudden he stepped up
I'm sure glad, I thought I lost my touch
He grabbed my hand, said "Let's dance"
Thought to myself 'Now here's my chance'
To whisper freaky things in his ear
Wet my lips then I gave a freaky stare
Now for the moment I'm tired (right), feelin alright (right)
Havin a good time so I'm straight down on mine
	Uhh, so whatchu doin tonight?
Whatever you're doin, baby
He made my heart sang

Chorus:

Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
He made my heart sang
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
He made my heart sang
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
He made my heart sang
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah

Verse 3: MC Breed, Quala D

I remember when I use ta love em and leave em
Uhh, nowadays ???? ???? it was just hard for me to believe em
Havin you thinkin it's all about me
But in reality, she's just a casualty
See, I'm hip to ya female ways
The ways you's play witcha boy, but I ain't fazed
I'm just amazed, dazed, it's all in my face
Time's all mine and I got time to waste
So wassup

I made my way back to the bar
	Check it out baby girl, I don't know who you are but aaah....
Look, y'all they call me Quala D
Are you gonna spend this time flappin your jaws? I needs some drink and
Shit
	Tell me this, what ya drinkin?
Absolut, but don't forget to add the cranberry juice
DJ's playin, knock-knockin the boots
I hate to go but go my words but I wanted to do the Do
So whatchu wanna do?
	Aaah, whatchu wanna do?
Give me a minute, I gotta say peace to my crew
On the way out, yo, the sister kept bangin
But I don't give a damn, the honey made my heart sang

Chorus:

Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah
Oooh oooh oooh, aaah aaah aaah

Heyayayyy!
Heyayayyy!
Heyayah, heyayahhh

Outro:

Something about him, he makes my heart sang
