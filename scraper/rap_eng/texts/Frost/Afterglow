I know we said that it was done
But my feelings haven't gone
Now you're on your way back home
And I can't wait - we don't have to be alone

Be there
I'll be there

Be there, for you
I'll be there for you
And I'm feeling maybe we should see it through
Ain't nothing together that we couldn't do

We could live in freedom
If only we could see it
We could have a kingdom
If only we believed it
We could be the movement
If only they could chase it
We could be the future, future, future

We could live in freedom
We could have a kingdom
We could be the movement
We could be the future

When the lights go down below 
Through the night let's stay afloat
And I'm never gonna let you go
We'll be together in the afterglow

Be there, for you
I'll be there, for you
And I'm feeling maybe we should see it through
Ain't nothing together that we couldn't do

We could live in freedom
We could have a kingdom
We could be the movement
We could be the future, future, future
