[Verse 1]
Wake up, all I do
When I look into the mirror
I see a vision of you
Feels like Déjà vu
As I'm running through the city
You come out of the blue
Shake up, breaking loose
But it doesn't make a difference
I ain't over you
Tried out everything
But it ain't no use

Wake up, all I do
When I look into the mirror
I see a vision of you
Feels like Déjà vu
As I'm running through the city
You come out of the blue
Shake up, breaking loose
But it doesn't make a difference
I ain't over you
Tried out everything
But it ain't no use

[Chorus]
Tell me why I feel this way
Caught up in your foolish game
Makes no difference, either way
On my mind you'll always stay

Tell me why I feel this way
Caught up in your foolish game
Makes no difference, either way
On my mind you'll always stay

[Break]
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind

On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind

On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind

On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind

[Verse 2]
Wake up, all I do
When I look into the mirror
I see a vision of you
Feels like Déjà vu
As I'm running through the city
You come out of the blue
Shake up, break and lose
But it doesn't make a difference
I ain't over you
Tried out everything
But it ain't no use

Wake up, all I do
When I look into the mirror
I see a vision of you
Feels like Déjà vu
As I'm running through the city
You come out of the blue
Shake up, break and lose
But it doesn't make a difference
I ain't over you
Tried out everything
But it ain't no use

[Chorus]
Tell me why I feel this way
Caught up in your foolish game
Makes no difference, either way
On my mind you'll always stay

Tell me why I feel this way
Caught up in your foolish game
Makes no difference, either way
On my mind you'll always stay

[Break]
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind

On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind

On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind

On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On, on, on my mind
