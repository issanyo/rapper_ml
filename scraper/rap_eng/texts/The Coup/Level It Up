[Intro]
We gon' level it up
We gon' level it up

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
I'ma lev, I'ma vel

Next level that shit, you shovel that shit
I'ma L-E-V-E, level that shit
I'ma lev, I'ma vel

Next level that shit, you shovel that shit
I'ma L-E-V-E, level that shit

[Post-Chorus]
We gon' level it up
We gon' level it up
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
We gon' level it up

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
Work furlough, mixed with some Merlot
A key of cocaine in the ass of a burro
Dollars, pesos, crowns, euros
Expensive ass nouns in the plural
You got cash on the bureau
Your money long like a churro
But that don't mean shit to us
'Cause our bank account damn near zero
Now you see us standin' in the shadow of a five-dollar bill
Tryin' hard to pry off my collar still
Some try to deal through a whole lotta pills
We comin' out the field and we all want meals
Got us flippin' through the trap like a acrobat
Every hour we work, you snatch a stack
Meeting in the back, we want some of them racks
Here's how we handle that

[Pre-Chorus]
We gon' level it up
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
We gon' level it up
We gon' level it up

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
I'ma lev, I'ma vel
I'ma level that shit
I'ma N, I'ma O
Aaron Neville that shit
Next level that shit, you shovel that shit
I'ma L-E-V-E, level that shit
I'ma lev, I'ma vel
I'ma level that shit
I'ma N, I'ma O
Aaron Neville that shit
Next level that shit, you shovel that shit
I'ma L-E-V-E, level that shit
We gon' level it up!

[Bridge]
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up

[Pre-Chorus]
We gon' level it up
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
We gon' level it up
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
We gon' level it up

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
I'ma lev, I'ma vel
I'ma level that shit
I'ma N, I'ma O
Aaron Neville that shit
Next level that shit, you shovel that shit
I'ma L-E-V-E, level that shit
I'ma lev, I'ma vel
I'ma level that shit
I'ma N, I'ma O
Aaron Neville that shit
Next level that shit, you shovel that shit
I'ma L-E-V-E, level that shit
We gon' level it up!

[Bridge]
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
Make you get down, make you get up
We gon' level it up!
