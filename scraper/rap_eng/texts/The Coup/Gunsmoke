Chorus
Smell the gunsmoke

[Verse 1: Boots]
I be having homicide running through my mind
Don't know what's up with me
Shit fuck with me all the time
Eating at my spine
A motherfucka in my prime
How you gonna get yours
When you're too busy getting mine
[E-Roc]
Now who is this murderous criminal
Coming through
If you think it's E-Roc the subliminals
Is working on you
There's thirty million of us buried in the fucking sludge
Can't go straight or budge
I got a bloody grudge
[Boots]
Dead bodies lying all around me
But the real murderers ain't never got no bounty
County coroners be spittin' out statistics
With this ass if you think this
Blast is coming from my residential district
[E-Roc]
There's something that I think you should know
It's the motherfucking Coup we from the eastside "O"
Peep my flow creep by slow
See all my folks is broke
Survivors for the crushes of the low
Take a whiff and smell the gunsmoke

Chorus

[Verse 2: Boots]
I'm getting white hairs
From the nightmares everynight
Cos somebody's got a contract
On my life
Im in a gang that's in an all out war
They jump me in when
They knife my umbilical cord
So it begins with a slap on the ass
Now you in the working class trick
You here so fast we already made your casket
Wallet gots one buck
So the phrase gun suck
Gets hella tired
Cats ain't the only motherfuckas getting fried
[E-Roc]
Skeletons deep down in the ocean
Cos them slave ships had that three stop motion
Face down, floating on the Mississippi river
Burning crosses and motherfuckas saying die nigga die nigga
It all started when we start producing scratch
Some of my homies got no legs attached
Without no food up in the fridge
You ain't go never have peace
Cos with a trigger
You can finger fuck without no grease

Chorus

[Verse 3: Boots]
I said fuck the whole judge and the jury
My mind got delirous
My eyes got blurry
Had my uncle strapped to the chair
Hands oxtied
Breathing in gas
Breathing out carbon monoxide
Whole systems stacked like a loaded bowel
Cos ain't no billionaires on the murder trial
Make the ghetto concentration camps every mile
So march your ass to the gas chambers single file
Whos the biggest problem that they show on the tv?
More peoples die of starvation and TB
See me with an angry face and a beanie
Cos my relationship with Uncle Sam is steamy
Its what I've been through
Iâ€™m like Cinque
What I got you got to get it put it in you
The ruling class was cut throat since fresh off the boat
Show em we ain't no joke
Let them choke off the gunsmoke

Chorus
