[Verse 1]
I'll have a Long Island Iced Tea, neat
Or whatever kinda poison knocks me back in my seat
Cuz a little earlier we was out in that street
The police tried to smash and they felt defeat
You know they got no idea what they done unleashed
Keep my card open but it's done deceased
Them thiefs wanna talk when they cash decrease
Here's a toast to the folks who let action speak

[Verse 2]
I'll have a Long Island Iced Tea, straight
But the way my heart thumpin, I already levitate
Cuz a little earlier we made the whole earth quake
When we shut they shit down and had the boss irate
We only a fetus, we are modeling the shape
We gon make a masterpiece out of all the mistakes
But man I'm too damn drunk to continue this debate
Cuz I can't articulate and I need to urinate

[Verse 3]
I'll have one Long Island with one ice cube
Cuz as far as Rap go, he the muthafuckin dude
Let the record reflect that today we lit a fuse
(if I take one mo shot, I'm dancin on the bar nude)
Ay-Ay you talkin in my ear wit like hella amplitude
Every little fight could build up for the big feud
Today we struck a blow for all us in servitude
But the thousands of people got me drunker than the booze
