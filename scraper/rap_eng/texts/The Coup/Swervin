Now another FBI monitor with no feedback
See me on the street, ask me where the weed at
Or the coke, "I don't sell", I yell, they don't believe that
Set me up for running, breathin' like a Sleestak

Run into a car and almost bent my knee back
'S better than the sale where my lawyers fee stack
Run into a liquor store, they ask what you do
Wearin' boo boo, I'm with my man M'duku

The fact don't come through, I said merci beaucoup
If they ask you was I runnin', tell them bastards I flew
Made it to the hood, palace to catch a few flicks
Police did a raid, terrorizin' crew shit

Bustin' dope eatin' mommas while they makin' cool whip
Face down, gettin' dirt on my back to school fit
My neighbor next to me got black and blue lips
When the fuse lit, you goin' see the view flip

Kick our boot up they ass, ask 'em if the shoe fit
'Til then they wanna see us pushing up tulips
Press my nuts so much, shit, I think I'm sterile
Got up, brush the gravel off my appeal
This girl, Sheryl got parole violation
Said she was high 'cause of pupil dilation

If you never been to jail now since infinity
You'll get searched livin' in this vicinity
Or harassed, beat the shit, I mean the living daylights
Wouldn't be no dope slangin' if McDonald's paid right

The ruling class ships dope to you and me
And don't get arrested, is this lunacy?
Or is it diplomatic immunity?
Is it a war on drugs, or just my community?

Now who gets paper and who gets perved
Who gets slapped and who gets served
This type o' shit get on my last nerve
I think about in the car and it starts to swerve

Who gets paper and who gets perved
Who gets slapped and who gets served
This type o' shit get on my last nerve
I think about in the car and it starts to swerve

I got a communist plot to get the federalizes out
So many cops'd run in flock it's been away
2Pac, you got a flake and two rocks and two Gs in the shoe box
'Cause was it after two knocks, you hurdled fences in your socks

This is full a junta, keep it caliente
Let's send the president on a one-way
Trip to Kaiser permanent not a teacher, but a sensei
These rhymes are for battle, plus you gotta get the rent paid

I bust a donut up in front of Winchell's
Make this police state officials
'Cause they talk differential, now it's essential
These rhymes ain't provincial

Coroners call our bodies white chalk stencils
Broke as fuck eatin' lentils with no utensil
That type a shit motivated my pencil
It ain't mental, it's material

Police are the fists of the imperial
I'm spittin' through your stereo
Babies need cereal folks, need currency
My job got a crowd wavin' applications fervently

Some'd get accepted, most'd get rejected
Guess they goin' have to hustle 'til the new prison get erected
And now they sully unemployment street
They be microchips for two dollars a week
And they'll be packin' us in there in droves and fleets
And Channel Two goin' call it cleanin' up the street

Now who gets paper and who gets perved
Who gets slapped and who gets served
This type o' shit get on my last nerve
I think about in the car and it starts to swerve

Who gets paper and who gets perved
Who gets slapped and who gets served
This type o' shit get on my last nerve
I think about in the car and it starts to swerve

Now who gets paper and who gets perved
Who gets slapped and who gets served
This type o' shit get on my last nerve
I think about in the car and it starts to swerve
