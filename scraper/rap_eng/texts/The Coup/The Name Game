[Intro: Boots Riley]
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
But a name don't mean wealth, let me up you on this shit
If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
I spit game on a regular basis; now everybody
Looking at my hand like I'm holding all the aces
Cool that they know our faces, from different places
But you can't catch up if you don't know what the pace is
Everywhere we go you know especially in the O we hear
"Coup, Coup, you know we got love fo' sho'"
But even mo' when they see us on B-E-and-T and
M-T-and-V but me and E can't pay the P-G-and-E
Power come from the barrel of a bucker
I use the mic so that we aim at the same motherfucker
Cause your shit could go gold, and the only cash you got
Is the silver kind that don't fold
I'm gettin dope when they ask about the road that I passed
My peoples really be thinking they gon' come up fast
And then come rap and shake they ass
You ain't the first motherfucker who done scheme to scam
Then plan to scram up out the ghetto let me break this down
From kids to Grams, fuck the videos with the Benzes
And the cellular phones, spending hundreds like quarters
The Benz is they partner's, the money's on loan, and umm...
"The cellular number you have reached is out of order."

[Boots] Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
[E-Roc] But a name don't mean wealth
[B] Let me up you on this shit
[E] If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves
[B] But a name don't mean wealth
[E] Well let me up you on this shit!
[B] If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit

[Verse 2: E-Roc]
I mocked Rock Box wearin socks in my basement, told my pops
I'm fitt'n to have as much mail as they got -- not
I still plot to keep my cash clot flowin'
My mind is bent on the rent, I'm barely makin it microphonin'
It's true, it's a few getting fund expansions
It ain't like Acorn Projects gon' move into mansions
Straight authenticized shit, over synthesized hits
With this misty eyed 'mental make your teeth grit
And I'm not tryin to diss like it's a bandwagon trend
They selling six-packs of them wavies out the ghetto again
In the 20's it was rocks, in the 50's doo-wop
It's nineteen-ninety-fo' and everybody's store hop'n
And ain't nobody really trying to hear me speak it
They too busy watchin luke, gettin interviewed by Robin Leach
So if you're modest and don't hire economics
Just kick it with The Coup, smoke this dub sack of funk!

[B] Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
[E] But a name don't mean wealth
[B] Let me up you on this shit
[E] If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves
[B] But a name don't mean wealth
[E] But let me up you on the shit!
[B] If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit

[Bridge: Boots]
I'm gon' die before I lie to my peoples on the block
It's like frontin' you gon' shoot when you ain't got no Glock
You bet' not (that's a punk trick) this is how we run shit
I'm fitt'n to pitch a fit cause I'm tired of hearing dumb shit
Why do motherfuckers get up out and go for single
When the real high rollers draft a army to protect they Pringles?

[Verse 3: E-Roc]
Confusion, just a system based on prostitution
They done ganked you, don't be no stank fool with they solution
Unless you got about a million semi-automatics
You gon' think you strivin doin them ho-style acrobatics

[Boots]
No I don't have it like that, Planned Parenthood ain't got it
I keep my whole life savings stuffed in my back pocket, flock it
I'm scraping fronts off like plaque, no slack
I come realistic like Radio Shack
Intact and fat motherfuckers finally get they shit right
Ain't no fight, they scared shitless, all they do is grab the mic
Ain't no organizing real shit on the street, it's a fleet
Of revolutionaries in the studio making beats
So fuck the fame, fuck the game, fuck the riches foo'
I ain't got shit unless all my folks gon' have theirs too

[B] Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
[E] But a name don't mean wealth
[B] Let me up you on this shit
[E] If we was up in this, just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves
[B] But a name don't mean wealth
[E] Well let me up you on this shit!
[B] If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit

[Outro]
[B] The Coup is up in the house, and we run this shit like diarrhea
[E] Cheerio!
[B] You know?
[E] Check it out!
[B] Cause we up out
