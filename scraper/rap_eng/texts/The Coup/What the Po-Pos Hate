What the fuck?

This is that shit that the po-po's hate
Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate
Shaking in their boots when we start to bust
They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us

This is that shit that the po-po's hate
Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate
Shaking in their boots when we start to bust
They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us

I write my lyrics on parking tickets and summons to the court
I scribbled this on an application for county support
I practice this like a sport
Met Donald Trump and he froze up
Standing on his Bentley yelling "Pimps down, hoes up"

Stop tryin' to front off
Break your ass a clump off
We gon' stop the world and make y'all motherfuckers jump off
Watch me chunk off molotovs and bricks

Is you a have or you a have not?
When you run out of bullets, grab rocks and throw ham hocks
'cause the door to the pen slams locked
It don't open when your fam knocks
'less you rich and have stocks

I eat my dinner out of spam box
They carry cash off in glad-locks
This is for them babies with the empty plates
This is that shit that the po-po's hate

This is that shit that the po-po's hate
Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate
Shaking in their boots when we start to bust
They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us

This is that shit that the po-po's hate
Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate
Shaking in their boots when we start to bust
They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us

Life in the game
Showin no remorse and no shame
Rocks share up on thangs
Due to the imminent cocaine
In my brain
I know it's wrong
But a job would take too long
I'm robbin niggas at gunpoint
Just to keep my PG&E on
And we own
Kodiacin narcotics
To keep from going neurotic
Pushin the product
Padna was finer than gotti
Got shot in my body
Dropped a chopper in his lap
This shit is a distraction
From all the black on black
A systematic attack
On me and my race
Face it, found a way out
This cycle before
I'm six feet deep in the dirt
A consequence of puttin' it worth
This money and ho's and clothes ain't worth it
Even those my pockets is hurtin'
For certain, it's gonna be curtains
If I keep on for certain
As you get older you just realize man
It's human nature to have thangs
But I got to get out the game
Don't be shoutin my name
Temptation callin
Will I sacrifice my life
In order to be ballin' this all in time

This is that shit that the po-po's hate
Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate
Shaking in their boots when we start to bust
They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us

This is that shit that the po-po's hate
Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate
Shaking in their boots when we start to bust
