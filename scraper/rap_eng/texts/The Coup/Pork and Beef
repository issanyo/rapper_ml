[Intro: T-K.A.S.H.]
Yeah, it's all good man, we off in the Oakland Hills
Dodging em' one time, check it out

[Hook: T-K.A.S.H.]
If you got beef with C-O-P's
Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's
Cause they be harassing you and me
Ya gotta understand that we still not free
If you got beef with C-O-P's
Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's
Cause they be harassing you and me
Ya gotta understand that we still not free

[Verse 1: T-K.A.S.H.]
Don't trust the police, no justice no peace
They got me face down in the middle of the street
Pistol whip me with the heat, chicken shit's Sizzlean
Trying to serve me the all-you-can eat murder beef
I'm a young, black, heterosexual male
Don't drink drank, don't smoke, don't sell
That's the real reason that they want me up in jail
They want me to fail, I resist and rebel
See I give a fuck about the C-O-P's, P-I-G's
I wonder if I can shake em' like a P-I-T
Cause they wanna see me D-I-E
Tomie Kash, UnderMobb, I'm a pre-O.G
Dark Soviet socialist, vicious, venomous vocalist
Chrome 4-4 toting, holding it down for Oakland
Folks do be smoking and shit we do what we holding
Some just don't notice they get demoted
Throw 'em Molotov Music

[Hook: T-K.A.S.H.]
If you got beef with C-O-P's
Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's
Cause they be harassing you and me
Ya gotta understand that we still not free
If you got beef with C-O-P's
Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's
Cause they be harassing you and me
Ya gotta understand that we still not free

[Scratching]
"Come on, word, word"
"Come on, word, word"
"Come on, word, word"
"Come on, word, word"

[Verse 2: Boots Riley]
This is for them ladies with them empty plates
For that raise rent that you didn't calculate
If you ever in your life been a ward of the state, on the corner with cake
If they send an undercover and you took the bait, huh
Next time I see 'em with no hesitation
I'm peeling off like stolen registration
And leave a lot of smoke, see I'm that sort of folk
That been pig hunting since my mama's fucking water broke
Cause they the henchmen, nah they the lynch men
Between the rich and poor so we donâ€™t entrench them
Cause they dispense with the dollars and cents
So when you stand, go get candles, flowers, and incense
Behind steel gates is fifty percent of our bill rates
A pre-kin making microchips for Bill Gates
Pelican Bay, T-shirts for the workout
Police station where the slave catchers lurk out
Listen to the thunder, I'm no more taking under routes
We'll synchronize and give 'em shit to wonder bout
The DEA is filthy, yell not guilty
We need control of the cash and the realty
And get rid of all the motherfucking parasites
More than weed burn at 420 Fahrenheit
Shaking in they boots when we start to bust
They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us

[Hook: T-K.A.S.H.]
If you got beef with C-O-P's
Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's
Cause they be harassing you and me
Ya gotta understand that we still not free
If you got beef with C-O-P's
Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's
Cause they be harassing you and me
Ya gotta understand that we still not free
