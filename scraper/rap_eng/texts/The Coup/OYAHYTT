Oh yeah, alright
Hell yeah, that's tight
Oh yeah, alright
Hell yeah, that's tight
Hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
I'm Boots Riley, they ain't merc'd me yet
Gon' get shit popping like Percocet
Got pent up anger that ain't surfaced yet
Two stepping like the boss dispersed the check
Imagine this hymn is a hand grenade
Asphalt sheet rock serenade
Jack and Coke is the marinade
But we sober up quick at the barricades
Joint in my mouth, pass the fire
Everything out they mouth is a pacifier
I'm not preaching, ask the choir
The green one, the red one, mash the wire
Capital camouflaged with fashion
Fasten the shelltoes on to the assassin
Dash in security, mall expansion
Whatever I wear, know I'm here to be clashin'

[Hook]
Oh yeah, alright
Hell yeah, that's tight
Oh yeah, alright
Hell yeah, that's tight
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey

[Break]
We came to bleed electricity
We came to bleed electricity

[Verse 2: Lakeith Stanfield]
It's a celebration
Just got mail for the sales I'm making
Dressed up, I'm Big L, tell the neighbors
We the new beat party, don't stop the rage
It's profit, boss shit gains
You know me, I been killing the pain, feeling the rain
When I'm feeling this I'm feeling estranged, venomous rage
Getting into this, filling the page, criminal gangs
Do my nigga shit, militant aim
Brrrrah, gimme that change
I got a bullet and I'm willing to bang
Get your ass so benedict you're willing to get slain
Get dangerous with me, baby
Wanna see to blame me with big black reins
Beat change, switch lanes on the L train
Get your brain blown back, that's a 12-gauge

[Hook]
Oh yeah, alright
Hell yeah, that's tight
Oh yeah, alright
Hell yeah, that's tight
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
