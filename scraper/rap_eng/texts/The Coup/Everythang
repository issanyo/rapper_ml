[Intro: Sample]
And it was just about time for the party to close when the hinges went to flyin' off da motherfuckin' doors
Sup-sup-sup-superior sound quality
Sup-sup-sup-superior sound quality
Sup-sup-sup-superior sound quality
Sup-sup-sup-superior sound quality

[Chorus]
Everybody put your lighters up

Everybody get your shit started

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
Every death is an abrupt one
Every cop is a corrupt one
Without no cash up in the trust fund
Every cat wit a gat wanna bust one
Every guest want a plus-one
Every tenement's a penitent
Every tried man is innocent
Time served should be the sentence spent
Everybody wanna hear the lick
Every one a y'all is getting pimped
Every time I spit, I'm finna rip
Every cancer is a homicide
Every boss better run and hide
Every human is some kin to Black
Every Visa got a PIN to crack
Every verse is from the cardiac
Every search is involuntary
Every inmate want commissary
Every bank note is promissory
Every broke motherfucker finna form a gang
And when we come we takin' everything

[Chorus]
Everybody throw your lighters up
Tell me, y'all finna fight or what?
Everybody get your shit started
This is y'all motherfuckin' party!
Dub your shit, baby
Everybody throw your lighters up
Tell me, y'all finna fight or what?
Everybody get your shit started
This is y'all motherfuckin' party!
Dub your shit, baby

[Verse 2: Boots Riley]
Every mack want a Cadillac
Every mark want they scrilla back
Every narc want a hit of crack
In the park or a Pontiac
Every little cent is to the rent
Every roach is a resident
Every truth ain't evident
Every slave story, present tense
Every uprise, a consequence
Every time it be something sweet
Every banker is a fuckin' thief
Everybody betta holla wit me
Every fiend need a dolla fifty
Every crime that I do is petty
Every criminal is rich already
Every lender got a complex
Every single is a bomb threat
Every sellout, may ya hate my verse
Everybody, they gon' get it first
Every broke motherfucker finna form a gang
And when we come we taking everything

[Chorus]
Everybody throw your lighters up
Tell me, y'all finna fight or what?
Everybody get your shit started
This is y'all motherfuckin' party!
Dub your shit, baby
Everybody throw your lighters up
Tell me, y'all finna fight or what?
Everybody get your shit started
This is y'all motherfuckin' party!
Dub your shit, baby
