[Intro]
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Hey, hey!

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
Well if you thrust, eventually you gonna gush
And I'm implying I ain't had no business crying
'Cause we used the rubber twice
And we knew that shit was dying to bust
Well, we was only seventeen
But you was older in between
And in my fresh Adidas kicks
I used to come more clean than Jeru jerkin' off in a can of chlorine
Sophisticated with the game I was spittin' in
A nymphomaniac but which lacked discipline
Or experience, feet on my chest when I was put to the test
You said "goddamn nigga, that ain't how ya get it in"
Dashboards for leverage, tall cans for beverage
The weed can make you courageous
Make a Honda Civic seem so spacious
Make five minutes seem like ages, anyway

[Chorus: Keneice]
You smell like Care-Free Curl and Nowalaters, baby
Said you like high-top fades
And Jesse Johnson's "Crazay"
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much today I'm still campaigning

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Hey, hey!

[Verse 2: Boots Riley]
The lake don't smell so bad, now do it?
Don't trip off your hair, baby; just re-glue it
The windows is fogged up, can't nobody view it
Put down the O-E and turn up the Howard Hewett
In some months we had things to discuss
Like how we blew it, we got amniotic fluid
And a baby floatin' though it
Hey, imagine if it look like us
It was way up in the vaginary
And I'ma love my kids whether real or imaginary
Quit school, work for the parents at the mall next to FashionBerry
Operation cash and carry
Manual labor from six to noon
Making six doubloons, got a baby that's fixed to bloom
And he we fixin' to groom, plus grits the spoon
So let me twist the plume
We inhale and emit the fumes

[Chorus: Keneice]
You smell like Care-Free Curl and Nowalaters, baby
Said you like high-top fades
And Jesse Johnson's "Crazay"
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much today I'm still campaigning

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Hey, hey!

[Verse 3: Boots Riley]
I was composed, I didn't even crack a frown
I was supposed to let my pants fall down
And show my ass when I found
Out the baby was four months early and around ten pounds
I heard a lot of bad things about teenage mothers
From those who don't really give a fuck about life
They say "it ain't so much that they startin' out younger
It's just they supposed to be more like a wife"
Meaning you ain't shit without a man to guide you
If your mama tried to feed you that, she lied too
Fate can grab any motherfucker that ride through
If jobs are applied to, knots can get tied too
Plus I know that you must have been scared
It made it easy when the feelings were shared
Flashbacks are 20/20
I know you wasn't for the dollars 'cause you knew I had funny money
Yelling all loud like I'ma tear the whole hood up
You said leave 'cause the real daddy stood up
He said I was a mark for believing in you
Now it's more that I'm seeing is true
There's a few things I'd like to say in this letter
Like I wish I would've seen him grow
And ask my wife, I learned to fuck much better
And thank you for letting me go
Yeah, thank you for letting me go
For real, thank you for letting me go

[Chorus: Keneice]
You smell like Care-Free Curl and Nowalaters, baby
Said you like high-top fades
And Jesse Johnson's "Crazay"
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much today I'm still campaigning

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Hey, hey!

[Outro: Keneice]
Hey, hey, hey
