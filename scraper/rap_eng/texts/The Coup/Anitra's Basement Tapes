[Intro]
Turn me up a little bit
Up a little bit more, yeah

[Verse 1]
We've made our lives so complicated
We search for simplicity of fingertips
The answer in my hand's debated
But you got all kind of yes across your lips
And even much more than I want you
I want each moment to be true
I want this love I have to haunt you
I think this ritual will do

[Chorus]
I just wanna smoke a Taylor with you, baby
I just wanna see you dance across the living room floor
To them tapes my mama left in the basement
She just loved it when the music made the whole world go
I just wanna smoke a Taylor with you, baby
I just wanna dance-battle you and kiss on the couch
To them tapes my mama left in the basement
She was happy when the bass made the whole world bounce
Bounce (bounce) bounce (bounce)
Bounce (bounce) bounce
She got happy when the bass made the whole world bounce

Yeah
I like how this feel

[Verse 2]
Mistook your mouth for the ocean
I built a ship and sailed for war
When you divide, I love your quotient
My answer trembling on the floor
You hope the whiskey poisons all the ghosts
I drink to bring mine back to life
Come into me through my invisible door
Here's my agenda for the night

[Chorus]
I just wanna smoke a Taylor with you, baby
I just wanna see you dance across the living room floor
To them tapes my mama left in the basement
She just loved it when the music made the whole world go
I just wanna smoke a Taylor with you, baby
I just wanna dance-battle you and kiss on the couch
To them tapes my mama left in the basement
She was happy when the bass made the whole world bounce
Bounce (bounce) bounce (bounce)
Bounce (bounce) bounce
She got happy when the bass made the whole world bounce

[Outro]
I wanna know you, know I know you know me
I want a fire that can extinguish the sea (I want a fire)
I wanna crush my loneliness into dust
Please ride with me until this whole thing busts
I wanna know you, know I know you know me
I want a fire that can extinguish the sea (I want a fire)
I wanna crush my loneliness into dust
Please ride with me until this whole thing busts
I wanna know you, know I know you know me
I want a fire that can extinguish the sea (I want a fire)
I wanna crush my loneliness into dust
Please ride with me until this whole thing busts
I wanna know you, know I know you know me
I want a fire that can extinguish the sea
I wanna crush my loneliness into dust (into dust, into dust)
Please ride with me until this whole thing busts
I wanna know you, know I know you know me
I want a fire that can extinguish the sea
I wanna crush my loneliness into dust
Please ride with me until this whole thing busts
I wanna know you, know I know you know me
I want a fire that can extinguish the sea
I wanna crush my loneliness into dust
Please ride with me until this whole thing busts
I wanna know you, know I know you know me
I want a fire that can extinguish the sea
I wanna crush my loneliness into dust
Please ride with me until this whole thing busts
I wanna know you, know I know you know me
I want a fire that can extinguish the sea
I wanna crush my loneliness into dust
Please ride with me until this whole thing busts
