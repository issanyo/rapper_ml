[Chorus]
Gods Of Science have spoken:
"Grab the wire and choke them"

[Verse]
Hypnotic, the noose is slip-knotted
In a fourth-quarter audit and pumped through the carotid
Many bought it, got it in patch, pill, or tonic
Get your credit card, slot it, and sign it on the dotted
Billionaires have squatted on the Magna Cum Lauded
Hollered, "Take my wallet, make the people robotic
Catatonic or harmonic with what they've been alotted"
And methodically they plotted against those who fought it
Whole cities are haunted cause some money bag nodded
And dropped the thought product of a Harvard grad upon it
Dollars turn the table boardroom and periodic
Listen to the sonics going through your electronics
You can catalogue it as harmonic or atomic
Howsenever, when I bomb it molecules turn into solids
Some pray to the Christ, look to Buddha or Mohammed
Some pray to the crack of a rich man's pocket
The biggest advance was plumbing to the projects
Now the scientific process got hijacked for profits
It flows in the direction that a Silver Spoon prodded
We'll get science for the people when we run the economics

[Chorus]
Gods Of Science have spoken:
"Grab the wire and choke them"
