[Hook 1: repeat 2X]
Now's the time for you to show yo' ass
They ain't handing out no mo' cash
Mommas imitate my logo fast
Daddies take the safety off and blast

[Verse 1: Boots]
Now this is mo' mean than fo' fiends with Glocks unloading
Scrapping for a bag of gold rings and codeine
Whole life savings hid under the molding
"Mama Said Knock Them Out" and I'm quoting
You're voting, which you're hoping
Will stop the guns from smoking
Is someone fucking joking?
They're bankers in sheep's clothing
I know places where the kids keep croaking
Lacking the essential vitamins and protein
Hustling and hyphy are eloping
I'm the best man busting shots and toasting
Sipping Grey Goose get clipped off the bird
Come Sunday morning get tripped off the word
TV and them preachers got pimp talking verbs
Setting us up to get ripped off and stirred
You flipped all them birds so your funds act right
Here come the drought whole thang's half price
My high school career counselor's advice:
"Lil' niggas act nice for your beans and rice"
I got some light baby, take it to the head
Who gives a fuck if it's permed or dreads
Never snitch to the locals or the feds
See they tryna break us so they don't have to break bread
Cause Uncle Sam ain't the baker, he's the butcher
We all on "Punk'd" with no Ashton Kutcher
We're ballin' (no broke) cutthroats kaput ya
Ain't never took dope but them dopes done took ya
Stop flying Ol' Glory man, cut it down
If your job ain't paying right, shut it down
If your car got 18's, let it pound
And if we ever gon' do it let's do it now

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: Boots]
You're in a system where they flirt with disaster
Tongue kiss death, have mass murder orgies 'til there's no one left
They're finger-fucking Lady Liberty under her dress
And since I didn't say this under my breath
I might be under arrest; now lemme introduce
My slave name's Ray Riley, you can call me Boots
Cause we gon' boot 'em outta power then spread the loot
We need to drive that freedom train, not ride caboose
And you can tell by the way I walk my walk
That there's a coroner behind me holding chalk
Cause he works for the county who works for the state
Who works for the boss man eating off your plate
We ain't one dimensional, max-detentional
Looking for the liquor store, what them hubbas hitting fo'?
We raised by the street light, praised for the street fight
Days we ain't eat right, hazed to complete life
Had to make homes outta muck and dirt
Just to get dinner take luck and work
They don't read me my rights, they induct a curse
So you're cordially invited to go buck berzerk and um

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2: repeat 2x]
The block is heated; baby, yeah
A hundred Fahrenheit
Act a fool, show yo' ass
Let's make it alright

[Boots - repeat 4X]
It's introduction of a new breed of leaders
Stand up organize

[Hook 2]
