[Chorus 1: Janelle Monae, Boots Riley & and Silk E]
I get out and get over, over you
You just hold all your soldiers close to you
And I might not be there
When your world comes fallin' down
But I'll be somewhere near, dancin' to the sound

[Chorus 2: Janelle Monae, Boots Riley & and Silk E]
What I saw broke my eyes
And you were all my lies
What I saw broke my eyes
A sticky sunrise
What I saw broke my eyes
And you were all my lies
What I saw broke my eyes
A sticky sunrise

[Chorus 1: Janelle Monae, Boots Riley & and Silk E]
I get out and get over, over you
You just hold all your soldiers close to you
And I might not be there
When your world comes fallin' down
But I'll be somewhere near, dancin' to the sound
