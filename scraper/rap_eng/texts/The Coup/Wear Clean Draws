[Intro]
I want everybody to like cha-cha when they hear this
That's if you can
Check this out

[Verse 1]
You know you're my cookie baby and you're too smart
I can read it in the lines of your school art
True heart, I mean courage, expressed with care
Go on draw them superheroes with the curly hair
You're my daughter, my love, more than kin to me
This for you and the woman that you finna be
Tell that boy he's wrong, girls are strong
Next time at show-and-tell play him our song
Tell your teacher I said princesses are evil
How they got all they money was they killed people
If somebody hits you, hit 'em back
Then negotiate a peace contract
Life is a challenge and you gotta team up
If you play house, pretend that the man clean up
You too busy with the other things you gotta do
If you start something, now, remember follow through
Later on you gon' blossom like a lotus
You'll get into boys and the boys gon' notice
It don't matter who you do it with
Just remember when I tell you baby you the shit
Handshakes are promises, lies can spoil it
Words should be bond and seal
Wash you hands after using the toilet
Brush after every meal
And also

[Chorus]
Wear clean draws
Every day (every day)
'Cause things may fall
The wrong way (stay ready)
You'll be lying there
Waiting for the ambulance
And your underwear (ooh)
Got holes and shit
Wear clean draws
Every day (every day)
'Cause things may fall
The wrong way (stay ready)
You'll be lying there
Waiting for the ambulance
And your underwear (ooh)
Got holes and shit

[Post-Chorus]
Pam can I get a little scratch right here? (Yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right there? (Oh yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here? (Yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right there? (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
My boogie baby now, the world ain't no fairy tale
And it's ran by some rich white scary males
To make it simple for you, let's call 'em the bosses
They take money while the people take losses
Stole Black folks from Africa to work for free
And we still barely get paid enough to eat
That's what I told you I be saying in my vocals
That's why the woman got the gun on the logo
The star is the future that we gon' create
Where nobody steal money from the things we make
The revolution take time and space
But you as a woman gotta know your place
That's in the front, baby
I'm being blunt, baby
If they get mad, say it's they time of the month baby
Your face is just like the sun when it raises
Thank you for adding beauty to my phrases
Handshakes are promises, lies can spoil it
Words should be bond and seal
Wash your hands after using the toilet
Brush after every meal
And like your granddaddy told me

[Chorus]
Wear clean draws
Every day (every day)
'Cause things may fall
The wrong way (be ready)
You'll be lying there
Waiting for the ambulance
And your underwear (ooh)
Got holes and shit
Wear clean draws
Every day (every day)
'Cause things may fall
The wrong way (stay ready)
You'll be lying there
Waiting for the ambulance
And your underwear (ooh)
Got holes and shit

[Post-Chorus]
Pam can I get a little scratch right here? (Yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right there? (Oh yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here? (Yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right there? (Oh yeah)
If you stay ready you don't gotta get ready
Alright, baby, this is for you
