Baby boy (get it together) with big brown eyes
And oh my god with thick long lashes mind you
Crying to the beat of the words project complex
Looking out his window (get it together)
Wondering if he is now the owner of a complex
Living in the projects
Yeah, well, er um, mama's living on welfare
And she ain't been living well
And that for damn sure ain't fair
That's 360 degrees of poverty
(get it together)
Baby boy with big brown eyes
And oh my god with thick long lashes mind you
Realizing living in a society with a bunch of menaces
Can't be all damn bad when labelled a menace to society
Well shit, he fit right in
Looking at you like youre mad (get it together)
Cos you talking out your butt, wah wahwahwah
Just say no to drugs, but say yes to what?
Baby boy (get it together) with big brown eyes
And oh my god with thick long lashes mind you
Thinks he's a man now
Cos he now has a baby boy (get it together) with big brown eyes
And oh my god with thick long lashes mind you
Crying to the same beat of the worlds project complex
Looking out his window wondering am I not the owner of a complex
Living in the projects
You see what goes around comes back around
And oh goddamn here it come now
