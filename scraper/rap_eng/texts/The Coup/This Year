[Intro]
Alright!
Alright!

[Verse 1: Silk-E]
This year will be the year
That we do what we've been waitin for
This year will be the year
That we stop knockin and kick down that door
Loved ones, we on the wire
Hesitation is the drug of choice
This time we on fire
Make your mark on the world
Let em hear your voice (alright!)

[Verse 2]
Cuz our life on this ball is just a blink of an eye
And ain't no fairy godmama gon' help you and I
Woke up this mornin
Brushed my teeth and spit out the lies
Decided I'm gon' live if I am gon' have to die (alright!)

[Hook]
And you can take it anyway you want
You can take it anyway you want
You can take it anyway you want
You can take it anyway you want
You can take it anyway you want
You can take it anyway you want
You can take it anyway you want
But just take it (alright!)

[Verse 3]
This time we get it in
We gon' get em out they body, baby
This time we gon' bust the ceiling
O-o-o-o-oh fa sho
We comin' with tens of millions
Them villains be oh-so-shady
It's gonna be ending
With us winning
You already know (alright!)

This time we get it in

O-o-o-o-oh fa sho
We comin' with tens of millions
Them villains be oh-so-shady
