[Hook: Boots]
This is the place where I take my stand
Take my stick and draw a line in the sand
Show my hand, initiate the actions planned
Now meet the rubber on my shoe or meet my fuckin demands
Here's the place where I take my stand
Take my stick and draw a line in the sand
Show my hand, initiate the actions planned
Now gimme time for assault or gimme back my clams

[Boots]
As saltwater drips from my oculars
I got the urge to just squeeze on the Glock and burst
My fingertips wipe away my teardrops, I curse
You diggin in my purse, so may you rock a hearse
This feeling's popular, cause people's kids need socks and shirts
And if you po' you get woped the worst
Hopes of Hollywood endings without plot the first
Be happy all I did so far is drop a verse
See I'm old school, like coke lines and LP covers
Learned how to hustle then run when the heat hovers
Fist to my heart, warm embrace how I greet others
Cookin with no lights make my +Fishburne+ like _Deep Cover_
Keep cover cause I'm fin'sta spray
I go from sun up to sun down and miss the day
You been sayin for months that you gon' fix my pay
While the hours of my life get pissed away

[Hook]

[Boots]
Weed and dope, speed and hope
When we bleedin broke, we get keyed and cope
When ecstasy pills don't stop SBC bills
We get all depressed like we need a rope
Poundin walls, cain't handle it
Ten days with the candles lit
When the fridge cheese green and the pocket cheese silver
Ain't no hustle too scandalous
And I'm a champion, at runnin my mouth
But I'll be campin if I'm kicked out the house
So here's my anthem sing it to the music or shout
I forfeit the rat race to start the 12 round bout
I got your damn IOU in my hand
Thankin of things I can do with two grand
But I'mma light it with a Bic then use it as a wick
To burn your shit down cause I'm through with you man
Less you pay me

[Hook]

[Female singing]
Mama, never raised no punks, now
Brawlin but not crawlin
Time to put my all in
Mama, never raised no punks, now
Brawlin but not crawlin
We starvin but y'all ballin
