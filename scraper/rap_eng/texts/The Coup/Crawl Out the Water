[Chorus: Silk E & Damion Gallegos]
Calculations and equations
All the way down to your molecules
I'm evolvin', Cro-Magnon
Crawl out the water, but I still keep crawlin' to you
Calculations and equations
All the way down to your molecules
I'm evolvin', Cro-Magnon
Crawl out the water, but I still keep crawlin' to you

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
Love to the people who done struck a fire
Sirens and helicopters, such a choir
This ain't a song, it's a multiplier
This ain't a job but you are fucking hired
They say we look like we're thievin'
We walk like we're leavin'
We laugh like we're grievin'
We dance like it's treason
We breed like we're breathin'
It seems we're in season
Believe in the heathens
Let's fight till it's even
Good mornin', this evenin'
The night is yours
Six-million budgets as tight as yours
Land of the free-but-can't-quite-afford
Stars in the sky, but the light is yours

[Chorus: Silk E & Damion Gallegos]
Calculations and equations
All the way down to your molecules
I'm evolvin', Cro-Magnon
Crawl out the water, but I still keep crawlin' to you
Calculations and equations
All the way down to your molecules
I'm evolvin', Cro-Magnon
Crawl out the water, but I still keep crawlin' to you

[Verse 2: E40]
I just seen him yesterday, he died the next day
He always said he 'bout that life and he with the pistol play
I put a prayer in the air for his family
Some things you speak out your mouth can be reality
The state of affairs are he gon' end up dead
Funeral homes gettin' they bread
Rejected mortgage loans, veterans can't afford meds
Done came a long way; Olympics, track, prosthetic legs
Family don't believe in cremation, Church of God in Christ
Life support decisions ain't nothin nice
Beef and pork, obesity, no exercise
Police report: no truth all lies
Last resort: get a job or sling pies
Come up short, double agents in disguise
Satan be tryna mess up my plan
But I'll slap that mark with my back hand

[Pre-Chorus: Silk E & Damion Gallegos]
Calculations and equations
I'm evolvin', Cro-Magnon
Crawl out the water, but I still keep crawlin' to you

[Chorus: Silk E & Damion Gallegos]
Calculations and equations
All the way down to your molecules
I'm evolvin', Cro-Magnon
Crawl out the water, but I still keep crawlin' to you
Calculations and equations
All the way down to your molecules
I'm evolvin', Cro-Magnon
Crawl out the water, but I still keep crawlin' to you
