[Chorus: Silk E]
We gon' hit 'em till they break down (break it down)
That's the function (yeah)
We all know about the shakedown (shake it up)
We need an eruption (that's right)
We gon' hit 'em till they break down (break it down)
That's the function (yeah)
We all know about the shakedown (shake it up)
We need an eruption (that's right)

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
I hope you beat the case
Walk out, middle finger to the DA face
I hope your game is hard
And you can pay your light bill with a EBT card
I'm thinking positive
Cocked gun to your head and they let you live
Hope you don't need the strap
'Cause your landlord said you don't owe them racks
But come on bro, you know how it go, though
Click up with your folks and throw them bolos
Out there solo, you might get so low
Snatched in the back of a black and white fo' do'
Constant fits, tryna stop that sitch
Make you drank a fifth and can't drop that shit
We just really wanna see you rock that shit
Get together like a fist, straight clock that shit

[Chorus: Silk E]
We gon' hit 'em till they break down (break it down)
That's the function (yeah)
We all know about the shakedown (shake it up)
We need an eruption (that's right)
We gon' hit 'em till they break down (break it down)
That's the function (yeah)
We all know about the shakedown (shake it up)
We need an eruption (that's right)

[Verse 2: Boots Riley]
We gon' take the plastic off the furniture
Drive a blown head gasket to the curvature
Asterisk, they murderers, we faster and we furtherer
Just blast him in the vertebrae; have you ever heard of a
Muthafucka that could give less than a fuck
'Bout sayin' that for freedom we gon have to go buck?
Squeezin' through the cracks, you finna get stuck
Fuck the FBI, SWAT, and their big black trucks

[Chorus: Silk E]
We gon' hit 'em till they break down (break it down)
That's the function (yeah)
We all know about the shakedown (shake it up)
We need an eruption (that's right)
We gon' hit 'em till they break down (break it down)
That's the function (yeah)
We all know about the shakedown (shake it up)
We need an eruption (that's right)
