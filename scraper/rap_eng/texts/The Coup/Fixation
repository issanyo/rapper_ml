[Verse 1]
Well this is verbal penetration, alert your school administration
If you act like a dick: castration, it just brings me elation
Your misleading presentation was just boring oration
Gun claps from my TEC will be your standing ovation
Beat-per-minute calculations match aorta palpitations
Which speed up if you eat that greasy defecation at Nation's
Tear along the perforation: means collection notification
And you know I stack my scrilla in negative denominations
And that's a damn abomination, it takes all my concentration
To not rob armored transportation and collect compensation
But it takes contemplation, conspiration, conversation and propagation
Information disseminations and tribulations, no hesitation
Indoctrination, affiliation, penitentiary and jail evasion
For liberation, for publication spell THE COUP with capitalizations

[Verse 2]
I was on the verge of ejaculation, police performed a home invasion
So I cut off the illumination and jumped up out the ventilation
They were in anticipation, waiting in Voltron formation
I performed circumnavigation, and then crawled through the foliation
Started my legs to gyration, caught me, took me to the station
Valuables: confiscation, started the interrogation
Wanted know 'bout this organization, causing business complications
Said they wanted pacification, said "I know all yo machinations!
What you want: mo' exploitation, you gets no respect, no information
One mo' thang fo' yo' gestation: Think you should try self-fornication!"
