[Intro: M-1]
Dead Prez, The Coup
People Army, where the Gs at? C'mon
Fuck the police
Ay, y'all ready for this shit for y'all trunk?
Y'all ready to get this bitch crunk?

[Chorus: Martin Luther McCoy & stic.man]
You got to get up right now
Turn the system upside down
You're s'posed to be fed up by now
Turn the system upside down
Get up!

[Verse 1: stic.man]
Honestly, I'm against this government
I ain't gotta cover it up, that's what I meant
I'm sick of paying bills and I'm sick of paying rent
Seem like I work all the time but don't know where the money went
And the funny shit is we supposed to like this shit
But all y'all politicians can bite this dick
It's a war going on, the ghetto is a cage
They only give you two choices: be a rebel or a slave
(So, what you do?) So, I rebel
Like a ulcer in the belly of the beast staying true to it
Since my home street days in the blue Buick
Niggas been fighting so long seem like I'm used to it
Now what y'all know 'bout how The Coup do it?
Truth fluid, Boots put the funk to it, ain't nothing to it
This is for the Gs all the way to the Bay
From 'Frisco to Oakland, all over L.A., ya gotta get up

[Chorus: Martin Luther McCoy & stic.man]
You got to get up right now
Turn the system upside down
You're s'posed to be fed up by now
Turn the system upside down
Get up!

[Verse 2: Boots Riley]
Now uh, this fella spits yella', never been a snitch teller
One pay stub from a homeless ditch dweller
Yelling "Fuck 'em Rockafella", my shit bump in a capella
My lyrical quotes are nervous notes to bank tellers
When we call it off, we hauling off, Molotov's and bricks
Mr. Bailiff you could put that in the transcripts
Hope your motherfucking paddy wagon van flips
Some saw it off, I prefer hand-grips
Quote us, you know we're stronger than a three-day notice
Pay or quit, it's more of us than the lies your mayor spit
I'm on some, "Ma hate the game but love the player" shit
Is you a "have" or you a "have not"?
When you run out of bullets, grab rocks
'Cause the prison don't slam locks
It don't open when your fam knocks
'Less you rich and have stocks
Fight the power like a motherfucking Zulu
It's the Coup, plus Kanume and Mutulu
So raise your hands in the air like you're born again
But make a fist for the struggle we was born to win

[Chorus: Martin Luther McCoy & stic.man]
You got to get up right now
Turn the system upside down
You're s'posed to be fed up by now
Turn the system upside down
Get up!

[Verse 3: M-1]
When I hear the whoop-whoop, I be ducking them hoes
I can smell a pig coming, so I stay on my toes
On the low from po-po, so fuck the Ho-lice
'Cause piece to me is loaded under my seat
And I know power respect that, so 'serve and protect' that
I'm young, black, and just don't give a fuckâ€”try me!
Grilling you right back, you better drive by me
We the People Army is known to get rowdy
And even if you a friend of the blue
You can get it too, snitching is never forgettable
This hell we living is never forgivable
It come down to DP and The Coup
Remember Huey, Bobby Hutton, George, Fred and them
Fuck the po-po, local, state, fed and them
You better choose your side Crip, Blood, 415
It's one team, get up and let's ride!

[Chorus: Martin Luther McCoy & stic.man]
You got to get up right now
Turn the system upside down
You're s'posed to be fed up by now
Turn the system upside down
Get up!
