[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
The valet pointed me through the door
One more shot and you're on the floor
If cash talks, yours is a lion's roar
Ghesquière, Christian Dior
You're the asshole ambassador
But your friends obey like Labradors
I vomited on the alpine décor
It’s okay, your daddy gon' buy some more!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Chorus 1: Justin Sane]
All your friends from school are here
Your frat boys got the roofies near
What do they want when you're out of beer?
Your parents' cocaine!
Your graduation monster bash
The maids will pick up all the trash
In almost every room is stashed
Your parents' cocaine!

[Verse 2: Boots Riley]
Your daddy gon' make you VP of sales
Don't mix good shit with the ginger ale
Pacific Heights ain't Sunnydale
You could murder somebody and be out on bail
Your mom's Amtrak, she's on the rails
So many bumps thought it was Braille
One day, we’re all gonna tip the scales
'Cause I got a crew too big to fail!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Chorus 2: Justin Sane]
Steve and Katie shut the door
And fucked all on the bathroom floor
Now they're up and looking for
Your parents' cocaine!
Until you get that trust fund check
Pretend you worked for your respect
Janie's asking if she can test
Your parents' cocaine!

[Verse 3: Boots Riley]
All your esteemed colleagues and guests
Are here to celebrate your success
They only say "Good Luck!" in jest
Your fortune guaranteed at the breast
And Dave, who lets you win at chess
Is with your girlfriend in her dress
They're tired of being your marionettes
You'll mourn in Rio via company jet
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Chorus 3: Justin Sane]
Your daddy's got a business plan
Which made wars in Afghanistan
It bought your house in Bangkok and
Your parents' cocaine!
Narcos kicked my windows out
They beat and dragged me out the house
They don't give a fuck about
Your parents' cocaine!

[Outro: Justin Sane]
Oh no, I don't give a fuck about your parents' cocaine, boys and girls!
And another line for you, and another line for you!
Now do the world a favor and blow your fucking brains out!
