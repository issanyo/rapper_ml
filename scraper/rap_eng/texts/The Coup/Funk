I used to kick it with a brother named, Moe
Moe used to kick it with a brother named, Joe
Joe used to kick it with his girlfriend Lateisha
Whose brother Elmo, looked like me
Elmo used to elbow lots of brothers in the nose
Kick em when they down and he'd steal they shoes and clothes
Elmo would develop lots of beef as a tweaker
And all of them was mostly come lookin for me
Imagine that, fat motherfuckers with bats tryin
To rat pack, hmm, time to get a gat
So I'm strapped cause I'm trapped like brother Thomas in his fat
Momma's lap, what's happenin here's a rap
Saturday twelve o'clock, told E-Roc, the whole block
And what not, about, how men are spottin he said
"This little homey gets bread like flossin
You ain't Steve Austin, Elmo got paws in Boots
Maybe you should move to Boston"
But you get lost when you play like a punk
Pile on the Right Guard I got SERIOUS funk

"I'm trying, not to lose..."
"I'm trying, not to lose my head..." -- Melle Mel

"I plan to tell you what it is later"

Bet George and Bootsy, never had funk like this
Catch twenty-two, twist no fist can dismiss this
Rip that I'mma go through, maybe I can flow through
This whole ordeal and not pull out the black steel
And my friends make suggestions...
That I should squeal to the cops but that's out of the question
If I die by the trigger of a misled brother
Could he be judged by the system that is scared of me and others?
I believe no, so I don't go, with the flow
Even though I'm bout to roll with no paddle
Up a creek called shit, light is lit on the situation
Cause me and him is gonna decrease the population
Now we wonder why our revolution never grow
Killin motherfuckers just for steppin on our toe
If we had as much funk for our oppressors as we did
For ourselves, the blood would never flow again
And then, the uzis that were once used to kill each other
Could be used, to serve and protect the brothers
And the sisters and the cousins or whatever others
But the funk keeps growing like a fungus...

"I'm trying, not to lose..."
"I'm trying, not to lose my head..." -- Melle Mel
(repeat 2X)

"That's Elmo, get that fool" "Yeah get that fool"
"Ay, I'm Boots, I ain't Elmo -- I'm Boots from The Coup!!"

[Boots]
Four years til I'm twenty-five, now I got a forty-five
Caliber don't take no jive, just pull to fix
Don't want to be eighty-sixed, three six and six ain't in my mix
Don't flap your lips about me takin no, trips
You won't be takin no sips from a milk carton
Seein my face with a caption, askin
"Have you seen Boots, he's missing in action"
This shit is more Off the Wall than Michael Jackson
Cause brothers who be doin brothers who be doin others
Screwin brothers but The Coup be doin more than shoo-be-doin
On the corner, talkin revolution from Victoria to Florida
It's why it don't make sense that they want me a goner
On a, run cause some brothers in a ratpack think I'm
Poppin junk cause they don't see for centuries
The genocidal funk so I'm a punk if I don't blast they ass
But I gots more funk for the rulin class
Will it ever end, will we ever win, drinkin juice and gin
Five-oh gets again, gets off with a grin
National Guard sent in for when we got beef
You wanna pop the trunk we got serious funk

"I'm trying, not to lose..."
"I'm trying, not to lose my head..." -- Melle Mel
(repeat 4X)
