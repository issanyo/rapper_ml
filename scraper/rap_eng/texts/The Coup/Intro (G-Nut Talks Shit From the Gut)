[G-Nut]
Hey, how you do?
And if you don't already know about my partner
Let me introduce you to the nappy headed crew
The Coup, Boots, E-Roc, and Pam the Funkstress
Damn these motherfuckas jam
Bopping in the ninety-four to slide
Into 95
Riding like so
And if you ain't already know
Act like I told you punk
This is the foundation of funk
But before I let them loose
Don't worry pass me some of that genocide and juice
