[Intro/Hook]
Bush and Hussein together in bed
Giving H-E-A-D head
Y'all motherfuckers heard what we said
Billions made and millions dead

[Repeat 8X]
Work it out; set it up

[Boots]
In a land not very far away from here
George W. Bush was drinkin beer
His daddy was head of the CIA
Now listen up close to what I say
The CIA worked for Standard Oil
And other companies to whom they're loyal
In a whole 'nother land by the name of Iran
The people got wise and took a stand
To the oil companies, ay ain't shit funny?
This is our oil, our land, our money
CIA got mad and sent false info
To Iraq to help start the Iran/Iraq wo'
Pronounced war if I have to be proper
The CIA is the cops that's why I hate the coppers
Saddam Hussein was their man out there
They told him to rule while keepin people scared
Sayin any opposition to him, he must crush it
He gassed the Kurds, they gave him his budget
Said you gotta kick ass to protect our cash
Step out of line and feel our wrath
You know the time without lookin at the little hand
Time came for them to cut out the middle man
Children maimed with no legs and shit
Cause the "Bombs Over.." you know the OutKast hit
And they really want you to hate him dead
When just the other day they made him head
War ain't about one land against the next
It's po' people dyin so the rich cash checks
