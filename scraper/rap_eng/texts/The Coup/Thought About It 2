Have you thought about it too?
Because we are here for you
When you have nothing to lose
All the people feel it too

You do have a way out baby
And together we can breath free air

Have you thought about it too?
Because we are here for you
When you have nothing to lose
All the people feel it too

I know they wanna isolate you
(yeah)
Give you nothing to relate to
(yeah)
We're gonna have to break this whole mother fucker down
So loneliness
Don't let it overtake you

When you feel so all alone
Know you have a home
