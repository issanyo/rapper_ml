[Intro]
We gon' have a sing-along
Turn up Janelle for me

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe & Boots Riley]
This the part where we sang on top
Thought it was but it ain't gon' stop
Wanna keep her with you but the girl finna do
What the girl muthafuckin' wanna do
This the part where we sang on top
Thought it was but it ain't gon' stop
Wanna keep her with you but the girl finna do
What the girl muthafuckin' wanna do
Hey hey hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe & Boots Riley]
You know her, she won't let nobody control her
Hefty bags in the hall full o' draws, waitin' for a good reason to stay
She scooped 'em up and smashed out
And only then was you convinced she wasn’t made o' clay
She felt like her destiny was much bigger than
It looked in that greasy reflection from that fryin' pan
You said "aww baby let's do it once mo, lemme show you"
And she was down
Nobody coulda did it good enough
To make her bad ass hang around
Now lemme tell you why

[Chorus: Boots Riley and Janelle Monáe]
This the part where we sang on top
Thought it was but it ain't gon' stop
Wanna keep her with you but the girl finna do
What the girl muthafuckin' wanna do
This the part where we sang on top
Thought it was but it ain't gon' stop
Wanna keep her with you but the girl finna do
What the girl muthafuckin' wanna do

[Verse 2: Janelle Monáe, Boots Riley & Nate Wonder]
Hot vinyl seats in the taxicab starting to burn
You thought she wore that miniskirt to make you learn
You never wanted a partner, partna
You just want an assistant
And every time she tried to shine baby
She would shonuff meet resistance
Behind many great men is a woman with her dreams left on the ground
Here's a story 'bout a woman I know with no time to be fuckin' around

[Chorus: Boots Riley and Janelle Monáe]
This the part where we sang on top
Thought it was but it ain't gon' stop
Wanna keep her with you but the girl finna do
What the girl muthafuckin' wanna do
This the part where we sang on top
Thought it was but it ain't gon' stop
Wanna keep her with you but the girl finna do
What the girl muthafuckin' wanna do
