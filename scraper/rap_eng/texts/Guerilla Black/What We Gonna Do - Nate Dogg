La la la la la la
Whooooooooo

From coast to coast
From sea to sea
From ghetto to ghetto, yeaaah
From street to street

La la la la la la la la

From the 310, 323's, 213's
You want me, you find me
My mind be, unlike these MC's
Compton is back, we ridin with long beach
Where the sawed off pumps
Thats them call off them trunks?
Full of alcohol and the _____ of blunts
___ than j kwon on my side
Hope the paramedics pick you up  for they life?
Oh no, it ain't no love blood
Got the raider beanie and some gloves cuz
Bouncin like a motherfucker on the one ten
With the gun under the hood, ill run again

While they out smokin and drankin all good liquor
Im on the grind and my rhymes are gettin slicker
While people think that this game gone last forever
My people throw me green pain in every letter
La la la la la la la la
And thats whats im gonna do

A minute in the sauce and la's mosh pit
Where the blood flow just like a faucet
Oh shit, you gone got yourself in the situation
Better ask nate dogg about this gangster nation
Where the weed smell musty like armpits
Hood talk is touchy, make niggas bear arms quick
And im just gone play my position
Like a general and do dirt down to the mineral
I got the method man like tical
Get in the way and get your ass took out, shiet

While they out smokin and drankin all good liquor
Im on the grind and my rhymes are gettin slicker
While people think that this game gone last forever
My people throw me green pain in every letter
La la la la la la la la la
And thats whats im gonna do

While they out spendin and layin with strange women
We out here stackin while they be straight fake pimpin
While they wheels turnin my mind is steady spinnin
Money been all on my mind since the beginning
La la la la la la la la la
And thats what im gonna do

Yes you are my, my west empire
With my texas fires, your chest expires
Ill make niggas come up short like danny devito
Zap the caddy burnt on like a dorito
It couldn't be laws in the hood they all get vetoed
Like god to turn on my ones with c notes
And we know you ain't got that desert eagle
Like j said "no we dont believe you"
Its best not to portray somethin that your not
At the end somebody always get shot

While they out smokin and drankin all good liquor
Im on the grind and my rhymes are gettin slicker
While people think that this game gone last forever
My people throw me green pain in every letter
La la la la la la la la
And thats whats im gonna do

While they out spendin and layin with strange women
We out here stackin while they be straight fake pimpin
While they wheels turnin my mind is steady spinnin
Money been all on my mind since the beginning
La la la la la la la la la
And thats what im gonna do

Girls flip out when we hit the club
And get turned out when we leave the club
And scream and shout cause they want some lovin
Im gone give it to em, every one of em

Girls flip out when we hit the club
