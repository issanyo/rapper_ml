You know what time it is man
Ay man its goin down in a real way its your boy Guerilla B-L-A-C-K
Ladies and gentleman, i welcome y'all to 400 Shotz: The Funeral. Yeah nigga 400 Shotz the Funeral
I know yall probably thinking "What the fuck is this nigga bouta say? This nigga crazy!
Yo, you know how we do it man

{Verse}
If you look up the definition im the meaning of dope man
I ain't about to talk about all of the coke man
All of the pounds that was stronger than toe jam or all of the jugs in the back of that Broham
Ain't nothing hospitable about me i send niggas to hospitals without knees
Imagine the West without me thats like having a vest without heat
I got 100 heats nigga ,100 streets nigga fuck what my album sold ima eat nigga
Go ask my rivals about my survival Im ether nigga so go ask Nas yo
Look what u made me do raise the tool all yall my children in baby blue
Yall can't even stomach yet eating baby food
How yall gon deal with beef with 82s?
40 Navy Blue vest and all that
Jokers while raise the bets I call that
Yo Hot fall back to hit up Bo
So he can come and annoint me with holy oil
Cuz after tonight shit its only war
Whats dinner without dessert? Im wanting more
I told you once Watts was my closest neighbors
Them niggas in the projects owe me hundreds of favors
All you hear is "Baby look" before they blaze ya
I run everything from Central to Acacia
Yes this is King im sending apologies
For all my siblings and they dishonesty
You ask me who the dopest that did it?
I say Scarface, Ice Cube, Big Daddy, and Biggie
2pac, Em, Nas and Jigga
Dj Kayslay then come that fucking Clue nigga
Not to forget Felli Fel and Dj Khaled
Heavy hitters raise hell from Miami to Cali
I was lead away and crucified
You knew i was resurrected when the Uzis fired
You ain't never heard me screaming crip or blood
All you heard was momma leanin up over her son
All u seen was his tats on hiphop.com
And the M-16s and the new shotguns
Somebody call Act Rite, the Dolla Figga butcher
Cut him up in the tub leave his foot in the kitchen
Just a reminda when i find ya
They find you face-up, eyes open and mindless
Yeah its all Black yeah its Guerilla Black
Yeah the killer's back to bring bullets to tracks
Yall part time with it your skills they show
Im hard on the grind all of the real ones know
Im hard on mine tryna get a million sold
Yall all fall in time thats why the deals come slow
I was a hustla way before id eat off rap
Had whips and ice way before i seen contracts
Ask them 6-0s where I made Gs of sacks
Charlene smile in heaven when she see where I'm at
I know how to get a good workout and I ain't talkin Bally's
I know how to send the work in and out of Cali
And when the work's hot it never go wrong
The ? look like they on Creatine when i work em out over the stove
Man how i hate a snitch
I keep my lips and tongue on Lox like Im Jadakiss
Yall mouth bout as big as that Fantasia bitch
Like ? said you can't change a bitch
I stay read with gloves, masks,and mini-MACs
Outside the club like Webbie screaming "gimme that"
You got guns i got guns
Get in my way and ill pop you have you dancin around like Lil Jon
I got 100 weapons; you gon need a old box with gold handles church jacket like John Legend
When i pull out that chrome shotty and start spittin
Niggas face on the block get long as Scottie Pippen
I ain't tired im hungry; i stay on the go everyday like the Energizer bunny
You dudes dont amount to nothin
Yall lookin all soft like yall was on Brokeback Mountain or somethin
You talk about the hood, but that's my life
Yeah you rap good but im twice as nice
I can flip the flow or twist the style
I keep a pistol for those that open they mouth
Man thats unacceptable, and Im impeccable
Skill level so high call it extraterrestrial
Im extraordinary, yall is ordinary
And if there's beef, yall will see what the boy carry
I move with them hammers hard fuck the camouflage
I want yall to see my face when im blastin dog
Yall with them games like Ubisoft
I got a ? and fuck that nigga ima blast the Uzi off
Pull the mask off so u can see thats its truly yours
Fuck all that humble shit u knew me for
I stay crispy like Pringles pushing a candy ride
I was doin this before you was a twinkle in your daddy's eye
You niggas is withered and wrinkled up like dandelions
I dont think of you unhappy niggas with half the mind
