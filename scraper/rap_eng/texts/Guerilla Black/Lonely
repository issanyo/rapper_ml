They see me hustling hard at the barbershop
I’m getting hated on now these niggas call the cops
Just because I’m trying to pay my rent
With the note on the F1 they hate that shit
I see the ? when I get new weed
Damn near blue and green I ain’t new on the scene
The Ds be mad when I make transactions
With no look passes that keeps them asking
How does he do it? It’s hard to imagine
With the clean handoff like Joe Montana man
I kill my competition off slowly
Fuck 0.9 its 1.3 but you don’t know me shit
2 for 15 and 3 for 25
I put the pressure on them chumps when i bring the fire

[Chorus]
See we been hustling for too long
Hustling for too long
You don’t know me like that
You don’t know me like that
We been hustling for too long (Too long)
Hustling for too long
You don’t know me like that
You don’t know me like that (Oh no no)

I’m tired of being stuck on a deadend job
I wish I used my head and took my ass to college
But no a nigga had other plans
Tryna blow a double up do 100 grams
Damn it didn’t go exactly that way
Moms tripped and kicked a nigga out of her place
And then a nigga seen some real hard times
In the ER line I had to swallow my pride
But damn how I’m gon fool these cats
When I’m at the liquor store pulling out food stamps
My mom said if I’m old enough to hold heat and smoke weed
Then I’m old enough to own my own shit at fourteen
More or less my morals was messed the fuck up
I can’t blame mom for my fuck ups

[Chorus]

Muthafuckas wanna see the big man fall but I won’t at all
I will continue to shine and drink Cristol
I deal with the everyday problems and the stress
That’s why I keep my revolver wearing my vest
Bitches they yapping niggas they keep acting like they so hard
I pull they hoe card I got the 8500 with the green screen so customers can hit me up
Whenever they need me throwing rocks out the penitentiary
A scary thought is this what God meant for me
On the block with the savages pushing packages
?
And heaven I’m asking please have mercy on a young thug nigga in this white man’s world
The money guns and liquor they keep us going round and round
That’s why I drink a lot so I can drown it out

[Chorus]
