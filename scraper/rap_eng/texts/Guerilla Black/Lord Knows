[Chorus] 2x
Lord knows i lived a real hard ass life
On the boulevard all my life
And I hope that my mama keep praying for me
Because the game ain't what it used to be

[Verse 1]

Around '89 I left southbound to westbound I'm 13 now
Out in Long Beach living out in the shelters
Dear Lord help us my family is so damn selfish
My uncle Junior he never gave a fuck
Had 3 kids of his own and never raised em up
Moms keep scheming, California dreamin'
Reality didn't set till i hit the Jim Beam
Now I'm in the CPT splitting Mexicales knee deep in the street
We deep in the street dreams I did what i wanted to do
Fuck Compton High School I'm gettin' high with the crew
But bitches fantasize them riches they tantalizing
Life ain't all about gettin' drunk and higher
I got a bigger picture meeting these different niggas
I got big dreams and bigger ambitions
Whoa

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 2]

At the end of '99 I was so dead broke
But in the 2000 watch my bread grow slow
I got a connect, two pounds and two weapons
New hood no clientele my boo stressin'
Lights gas and food the money was tight
With dime bags to move my hustle was nice
We got it in a few months my customers grew
Bought a new outfit for my boo a bucket to move
I used to pack that work in that Toyota
With my love Big Kiesh my number one soldier
She was down with me whether i had a nickel or a penny
100 percent TC tattooed on her tittie
I heard the rumors that niggas was gettin jealous
The niggas who know us told us watch those fellas
I used to hit the block in my cut-off shorts
Pistol in my pocket smoking mad newports
Come on

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 3]

When i first hit the block the block was so dry
Within a span of a few months they whole block was high
I was the man product in demand
From hand scaling my grams to hands counting my cash
It used to be ugly then it became lovely
Went from skimpy bags to bags that's mad chubby
My boo used to say let's shake the block
Vacate the spot or face this hot
I couldn't hear it the hood I wasn't fearing
Just the po-po in case they rush my do'
My brother ? AKA the HotBoy told me change the game
Take off your chains, bracelets, and rings
You doing too much
TC i love you but you losing your touch
Never keep your product where you rest your head
Much less them straps you don't know where they been
So i took off my gold i stashed my dough
I came back to the game with my game face on
Come on

[Chorus]2x

[Outro]
That's real you know the game ain't what it used to be
Know what I'm sayin?
It's alot of shit going on out here baby you know
I done been through alot of it I know you been through alot of it
I hope moms keep praying for me
Stay on her knees and say a prayer for her son for real though
And i hope God make some room for me up in heaven
