Pull out the black suits and start singing Amazing Grace
Cause im bout to blaze his ass from his face to waist
Fuck Hussein I’m America’s threat
A terrorist with a Tec and I ain’t scared to shit
Like I said I’ll die for this shit
Create lines of infrared standing over your bed
With the pillow over your face to muffle the shot
Creep out real quiet jump back in the drop (Ha)
I’m so black fuck a mask for the robbery
All I do is close my mouth you see my eyes then heat
And a blast if that nigga don’t act right
Six days from now he laying in a casket upright
With the choir singing is there a heaven for a wanksta
Fuckin’ with me even your momma will get shanked up

[Chorus ]2x

These niggas they got problems (Problems)
But I got something to solve em’ (Solve em’)
Don’t get hit with the revolver (volver)
Lay that ass up in a coffin (Coffin)


I’m 350 nigga fuck the scuffle
Have the coroner pick that ass up in the duffle
Calling your mom at three in the morning
Sending they condolences the tears is pouring
Like the Hypnot in my cup 6 shots to his neck
The boy played me for pussy but all he got was nuts
My sick and disturbed thoughts almost earned me a trip to the California gas chamber
You done passed danger you going towards the light
Can you see your homeboy kicking it with Christ
Psyche that’s the devil
One of your niggas’ throat cut
The other one’s skull bashed in with the shovel
Then I’m there helping your girl get through the shit
Tucking in your son giving her all this dick
(Oh you wrong) But you can’t judge me
I went from good bad to the mad ugly
I’m a guerrilla raised in these habitats
Niggas with red and blue burners and hood tats

[Chorus] 2x

Yeah (Yeah)
Problems (Problems)
Nigga we solve em’
Dolla Figga
Joint Custody
