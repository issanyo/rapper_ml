Hello little girl, little boy, with the creams you have eated
Crowling up your boys, Crowling down your face

We're going in that "Yes Sir"
We're going to paranoia
And I can't never pleased up
Why you are so glam

Remember when I was i he grocery store, now's my time
Rock this world and never cline or bad away

We're going in that "Yes Sir"
We're going to paranoia
And I can't never pleased up
Why you are so glam

We're going in that "Yes Sir"
We're going to paranoia
And I can't never pleased up
Why you are so glam
