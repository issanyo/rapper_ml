You was never really good to me
But every night you was chillin' in the hood with me
Have me thinkin' back when I was slingin' crack

Hook:
Every since I met you, I've been a whole lot better
Life's been a whole lot better
Everything in life take time, I need you to hold me down
Youuu, whole lot better
Everything in life take time, I need you to hold me down, you
