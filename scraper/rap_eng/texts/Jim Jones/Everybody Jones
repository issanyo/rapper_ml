[Verse 1 - Jim Jones]
Catch me in Soho getting stupid fly
Or catch me uptown getting super fly, can hold me?
Or catch me just riding my coupe’s fly
The beast, trendsetter, never pan better
Yeah I love my bags but the bank better
Going after you niggas is a vendetta
She saw the car when your girl start getting wetter
And she was hot but I didn’t sweat her
Cause I’m way too cool you can get a sweater
I’m in the club with the 2000 dollar leather
And they say birds of a feather flock together
So, you and you get in the drop together
It was cool outside not the hottest weather
But a nigga still stuntin, drop it on them heifers
And we pull into the deli knock the salt and pepper

[Hook]
Funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to start
Everybody Jones, everybody Jones!
Everybody Jones, everybody Jones!

Like oh my god, you guys isn’t that like Jim Jones?
He’s just totally amazing, do you know that he did that song
I mean, what it’s called, "Popping Germaine?"

[Verse 2 - Jim Jones]
I got more kicks that Jack Chan
In the face, in their eyes like black sand
And I used to sell smack like a backhand
And I see through you niggas like a CAT scan
And fuckers getting felt like a lap dance
They say I’m a rock star like The Gap Band
It’s new whips, I pull into the night club
I got them Jordan number sixes out of "Fight Club"
Sway still in seats all piped up
And we ain’t leave the club until the lights out
One more bottle!
Everyday I stay splashy like it’s Easter
That’s why they say I’m something like a fashionista
Wow some, bow some, pass the reefer
I turn the shit black and yellow, tape, not Khalifa
I’m so fly, tell me where I’m landing
I hope this Summer hot, nigga where we tanning

[Hook]
Funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to start
Everybody Jones, everybody Jones!
Everybody Jones, everybody Jones!

How many pairs of Louis Vuittons do I have to have
Before Jim Jones is gonna, like, fucking talk to me?
