[Chorus: Trav]
Ten toes in the trenches
It was me and my niggas with a prayer, we just wanted it all
We just wanted it all, hey
Hundred million with the gang
We ain't in it for the fame, we just want to take care of the dawgs
Want the family to ball
We just want it all
We just want it all
We just want it all (We just want it all)
We just want it all (We just want it all)
We just want it all

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
Them pies in the kitchen
I still remember tryna keep them flies out the kitchen
Grandmama mad it's residue on the dishes
I went to the pen, got out and started breakin' bitches
Shit, I should've been doin' that in the first place
Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon was my first case
Put me all on the news, now my whole city know my damn face
But they ain't know that I was gon' make 500 thousand off a mixtape
Shit, after all that I'm still livin' great
The bitch just sent me a 100K, she ain't talkin' on interstate
Steak and shrimp my dinner plate, codeine, I'ma pour an eight
This shit's a hundred percent pure, I cannot feel my face

[Chorus: Trav]
Ten toes in the trenches
It was me and my niggas with a prayer, we just wanted it all
We just wanted it all, hey
Hundred million with the gang
We ain't in it for the fame, we just want to take care of the dawgs
Want the family to ball
We just want it all
We just want it all
We just want it all (We just want it all)
We just want it all (We just want it all)
We just want it all

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Breakin' bricks on the cop and go (Facts)
If I did have to pimp, break a bitch and I knock a ho, like (Silly rabbit)
Shrimp and fish like a Pappadeaux's (Uh-huh)
Got thirty on the hip, lil' bitch, we poppin' those, like (Like)
Hungry, wanted more than we could chew (Eat)
We did have to hustle, it was nothin' more that we could do (Nothin')
If I bought it for myself, you know I bought it for the crew (Double up)
And I know it's some real gorillas that got caught up in the zoo (Freedom)
Ever since I bought the Rollie, it's been stuck on a quarter two (Frozen)
If I did buy the Rollie, then of course I done bought it new (True)
Ain't nothin' secondhand on my watch but the second hand
So I bust down the bezel, of course the rest of the band, like

[Chorus: Trav]
Ten toes in the trenches
It was me and my niggas with a prayer, we just wanted it all
We just wanted it all, hey
Hundred million with the gang
We ain't in it for the fame, we just want to take care of the dawgs
Want the family to ball
We just want it all
We just want it all
We just want it all (We just want it all)
We just want it all (We just want it all)
We just want it all
