They say you look as good as your team
Well, my team looking good, baby
You know we got it
I said we got it, we them niggas, yeah
Cars way sicker, bitch, bitch way thicker
Money getting niggas, we got it
We them niggas
Cars way sicker, bitch, bitch way thicker
Money getting niggas, we got it
Ill music, drug dealer music
That fly girl, Isabelle, high heel music
Smoke loud, drink rows so you can feel the ripple
Two step with guns on me, got killers with them
I'm even offshore or deep-sea in the submarine
In each V I keep heat like a marine
Fuck all girls but bad girls are way better
She say throw the money, I make the pussy way wetter
Take another shot, take away the pain
Till I make it drop, I'mma, I'mma make it rain
Fuck her all night till she tap out
And this beat beat, might break legs when I back out
I said we got it, we them niggas, yeah
Cars way sicker, bitch, bitch way thicker
Money getting niggas, we got it
We them niggas
Cars way sicker, bitch, bitch way thicker
Money getting niggas, we got it
We got it, I got it on me
Even in the club niggas plotting on me
You know I never slip, only time you get to drop on me
From outside in the thunderstorm, my top gone, rain drops on me
Try to party hard till the club closes
You know I kill the club, RIP, I need more roses
Love a bad bitch with a nigga whip
Not her nigga whip, I mean a big whip like a nigga get
Big dog make boss moves, just money talk no luck involved, no horse shoes
Just Porsche shoes, all drop tops, it costs you
House money but that house money we used to make off dog proof
I said we got it, we them niggas, yeah
Cars way sicker, bitch, bitch way thicker
Money getting niggas, we got it
We them niggas
Cars way sicker, bitch, bitch way thicker
Money getting niggas, we got it
Martini and the money, we keep 100
Haters, they funny, we laughing like it's nothing
I just topped another bottle, I'm looking for a model
Living like a king, Tony Montana
Got goons with me and they know we got it
I said we got it, we them niggas, yeah
Cars way sicker, bitch, bitch way thicker
Money getting niggas, we got it
We them niggas
Cars way sicker, bitch, bitch way thicker
Money getting niggas, we got it
