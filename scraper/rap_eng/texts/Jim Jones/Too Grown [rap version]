I don't like it, I don't like it man
When every dude in the club tryna grab my hand
I don't like it when I'm walking by
You tryna say something sick 'cause I'm looking fly
I don't like it when you calling out my name
And get mad 'cause I said no to your drink
Why can't you just let me breathe?
Enjoy the music, get off of me, you
You make me wanna pull my hair out
You're the reason that I don't like going out
Stand here kickin' that madness out your mouth
I'm too grown for that, I'm too grown for that
You make me wanna pull my hair out
You're the reason that I don't like going out
I'm too grown for that, too grown for
I'm just too grown for that, too grown for that
I don't like it when you're standing by me
And you tryna sneak over and stand behind me
I don't like it when you step on my feet
'Cause you dancing all hard to them Darkchild beats
I don't like it when you pullin' on me
Talkin' 'bout, Can I get you in VIP
Why can't you just let me breathe?
Enjoy the music, get off of me, you
If I didn't have to I
I wouldn't even be here
Because I don't mean that, that I
Want you all up in my ear
Just in case you didn't hear me
I'm a say this once more clearly
Why don't you just give it up?
I'm not gettin' in your truck
Boy, you make me wanna
You make me wanna pull my hair out
You're the reason that I don't like going out
Stand here kickin' that madness out your mouth
I'm too grown for that, I'm too grown for that
You make me wanna pull my hair out
You're the reason that I don't like going out
I'm too grown for that, too grown for
I'm just too grown for that, too grown for that
You say you wanna take me to islands, I did that
Say you wanna lace me with diamonds, I got that
Say you wanna make me a star but I am that
When you gonna come with some new game
Say you gonna buy up the bar, I don't drink that
Wanna get me a new car, ooh, yeah
I'm too grown for that, too grown
Just too grown for that, yeah
You make me wanna pull my hair out
You're the reason that I don't like going out
Stand here kickin' that madness out your mouth
I'm too grown for that, I'm too grown for that
You make me wanna pull my hair out
You're the reason that I don't like going out
I'm too grown for that, too grown for
I'm just too grown for that, too grown for that
You make me wanna pull my hair out
You're the reason that I don't like going out
Stand here kickin' that madness out your mouth
I'm too grown for that, I'm too grown for that
You make me wanna pull my hair out
You're the reason that I don't like going out
I'm too grown for that, too grown for
I'm just too grown for that, too grown for that
