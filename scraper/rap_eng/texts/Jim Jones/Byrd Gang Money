Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot
No, we got the bomb
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot
No, we got the bomb
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money

Reminiscing on my first slant
By the time I was sipping on my first Schlitz
Hit the game, I started as a look out
See the fly cars that the big wheelies pushed out
Dirt bikes popping wheelies by the cookout, that was that summer
I was thirst to be plumper. It pays better but the risk was worst
Save the fly leather copping kicks with the work
It didn't work; I was fucken up the re-up
Bottles at the tunnel, that was 98, I called papa for the bundles
An easy ten grand, it felt like a hundred
These Gucci belts by the stomach, with guns in them
Its only wealth that we want, if we run wit em
Till the death, until the feds come and get em
Byrd gang money, it started off that Byrd Kane Money
New cars, in that third lane money!

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot
No, we got the bomb
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
Only real niggas spending that Byrd gang money

Getting money is the hardest
Your first hundred grand is a job
Your first cool million, you're an artist
Especially if the niggas up the block, sell garbage
Told it, crumbles all apart when you hold it
Wasn't naturally born a crook, I was molded
Drugs kept my uncles in the green, so I sold it
Even learned to smell a good grade through the packing
Headed Midwest and got financial backing
Started networking with the wheelies on credit
Any concepts of being robbed I was debited
Anybody get it, don't come a day later with the eigth money
Got to play it out, cause I said it
Courts an acquittal, coming in the club with an entourage
Me I'm the boss in the middle
The brain and the bran roc-a-house rope around the neck
A lot of letters for the chain, and the charm. Come on man

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot
No, we got the bomb
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money

At a young age, no bricks just grams
Nigga stuck, then your mans a flip
The situation real, then your mans a hit
You slow on the get-a-way, the can you get
You circle the block, you play track and field
A lot of real niggas on that track got killed
But you know me forever manning up
Never sit down when I pee, forever standing up
I'm a boss, so I'm calling the shots
Big homie, pioneer of the block
You wanna pump, nigga Ill tell you when and where at
Don't face-fight; I'm not the one to stare at
Matter of fact dog, you and your man sits
In the back off cop car, dog, pointing your index
I guess you could, cause you a Sammy the Bull
But somebody gonna die if a hammer get pulled

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot
No, we got the bomb
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot
No, we got the bomb
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money
