[Chorus: Trav]
20K dice game, I ass bet my bet
Niggas ain't catch on yet (catch on yet...)
I told papi all of the keys, then I foreign the V
I ain't pay that shit back yet
I gave grandma the rent money just for the rent
Eviction notice ain't come yet
All that grinding you did, all that money you spent
These niggas ain't catch on yet

[Verse: Jim Jones]
Don't ask me no questions about my political views
You know I'm out here making all these invisible moves
It's hard to make a profit off these residual dues
I'm trying to get my credit just like them Hasidic Jews
A part of me is left with every bitch that I screwed
A part of me has no respect, they say this nigga is rude
I'm smart, but where I'm from God don't petty no fools
When I was young in high school, we had to dribble through school
With no court involved, thoughts of a Porsche involved
Fast life, nigga if you slip you get your thought revolved
Plus the fact that, I was young when they brang me to the crack trap
Dollar off a bottle or break the money from the pack pack
(?) in the house, we putting guns up in the backpack
Damn, I hate to backtrack
All them horror stories, we got marytr stories
Man, the Carter wasn't real, I'll tell you Harlem stories
Yeah, ran off on the plug twice
Robbed him three times, and we ask that nigga if he love life

[Chorus: Trav]
20K dice game, I ass bet my bet
Niggas ain't catch on yet
I told papi all of the keys, then I foreign the V
I ain't pay that shit back yet
I gave grandma the rent money just for the rent
Eviction notice ain't come yet
All that grinding you did, all that money you spent
These niggas ain't catch on yet
