[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Too much Chanel in the closet
Tripped on a red bottom, damn near fell in the closet, I make hella deposits
She got it all, just bought the new Bentley truck
But the one she want was at the west coast lab so I had the dealer go and send it up, I'm a
Real nigga, that's my bitch, I'ma deal with her
Park up then spark up and do nasty shit behind the wheel with her
We like two and the same, so we can do a few things
Hop on a jet, me you and your crew on a plane
Or hit the block at the Chinese store, get you lo mein
Get the iced tea, and I promise girl, drive you insane
What you know about chopped cheeses?
Double park with my top off, with the hot sauce in my drop V like

[Chorus: Trav & 5AM]
She come from a city where it's full of bright lights
Never been to the trenches where it's chicken fried rice
Never been with a hitter that just live a hard life
She come from a city where it's full of bright lights

Never been in the trenches eatin' chicken fried rice
(Hit me on the FaceTime)
She come from a city where she livin' hard

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
She fell in love with a trapper (Gotti), then I turned rapper (okay)
Shawty give me handful of heart, ain't gotta ask her (love)
Put pistols in her name for me
Start actin' different, she like you changed homie
Shawty keep a nigga on his game homie (facts)
She said fuck a ring, she just want my word
Only animal she care for me is birds (brrrt)
Only secrets that I kept from her was quiet (shh)
If them people come I know she down to ride
Hood nigga with a hood bitch plus we hood rich (I am)
Go and wrap the Ghost pink and purple for my hood bitch
You and your bitch rock matching outfits, we got matching forties
Yeah I be with a lot of bitches but I fuck with shawty

[Chorus: Trav & 5AM]
She come from a city where it's full of bright lights
Never been to the trenches where it's chicken fried rice
Never been with a hitter that just live a hard life
She come from a city where it's full of bright lights
(Hit me on the FaceTime)
Never been in the trenches eatin' chicken fried rice
(Hit me on the FaceTime)
She come from a city where she livin' hard, yeah

[Outro]
Sonny: So you must be pretty upset after the Yankees lost
Young Calogero: Bill Mazeroski, I hate him. He made Mickey Mantle cry. The paper said the Mick cried
Sonny: Mickey Mantle? That's what you're upset about? Mantle makes a hundred thousand dollars a year. How much does your father make?
Young Calogero: I don't know
Sonny: You don't know? Well see if your father can't pay the rent, go ask Mickey Mantle and see what what he tells you. Mickey Mantle don't care about you, so why should you care about him? Nobody cares!
