See this is the life that most people dreamed of but this what we live for
They wanna take this from us why
'Cause we young black rich and famous, I wouldn't trade it for the world
And there's no regrets in life, how that sound

This is the life
When the champagne spills and the Rollie on a nigga wrist glows
This is the life
When the spotlight shines and the camera gets me with a sick pose

This is the life
When the night time falls and the cash shuts everything down
This is the life
I'm escapin' on a heartache so why you gotta blame the hood?

Main dragon chin chillied up
Took the champagne glasses, please fill 'em up
Don't be scared that you spillin' it
And tell the truth is you feelin' it

That's the breeze from the gutta
We make cheese cop V'S and burn rubba
The latest coop V's got the ladies loopy
Indulged in the world so we spend the paper loosely

Life in the lime light, pretty, pretty bitches
My ice shine bright, break bread wit my niggas
The feds takin' pictures, we call 'em paparazzi
I tell my possie vogue strike a pose
I hop up in the Rolls, blunt, I'm gonna smoke

This is the life
When the champagne spills and the Rollie on a nigga wrist glows
This is the life
When the spotlight shines and the camera gets me with a sick pose

This is the life
When the night time falls and the cash shuts everything down
This is the life
I'm escapin' on a heartache so why you gotta blame the hood?

I wanna tell my problems to the reverend
Prayin' to God is there Harlem up in heaven?
Gazin' at the stars Ferrari engine rarrin'
At the red light and Harlem was the settin'

I'm married to a gang but didn't come for the weddin'
It started with the dealin' and dreams of four wheelin'
Comin' up I ran a amuck in the streets
Chasin' the fast bucks, stomach touch gotta eat

Now we orderin' breakfast, I'm sittin' at the table
Stackin' up my pancakes the syrups on maple
I gotta watch my brothers 'cause Cain can turn Abel
Gotta watch the money 'cause the thing can turn tables

This is the life
When the champagne spills and the Rollie on a nigga wrist glows
This is the life
When the spotlight shines and the camera gets me with a sick pose

This is the life
When the night time falls and the cash shuts everything down
This is the life
I'm escapin' on a heartache so why you gotta blame the hood?

All I need in this world of sin is just me and the pearl twin turbo
Blowin' smoke through the pipes, gettin' ghost through the night
This is fast life livin', pick a coast if you like

The day we cell dope, the night is velvet rope
Party with the chicks from the club with hella smoke
Whips that we valet soon as we hit Cali
Call the more buckets, ask the waitress what's the tally

Swipin' all da cash, lightin' up the grass
Four Seasons stays, more reason for us to play
Doin' sunset the Porsche Caberlay
Or the red eye flights like the Jedi Knight in Star Wars

This is the life
When the champagne spills and the Rollie on a nigga wrist glows
This is the life
When the spotlight shines and the camera gets me with a sick pose

This is the life
When the night time falls and the cash shuts everything down
This is the life
I'm escapin' on a heartache so why you gotta blame the hood?

Heaven for us
I wanna know is there a heaven for us, us, us, us, us?
Heaven for us
I wanna know is there a heaven for us, us, us, us, us?

Heaven for us
I wanna know is there a heaven for us, us, us, us, us?
Heaven for us
I wanna know is there a heaven for us, us, us, us, us?
