[Hook 1: Dan Auerbach and (Nicole Wray)]
You don't know, hey, what you do to me (What you do to me)
Now all I see, yeah, is new to me (New to me, yeah)
Just cause dolla bars and Barrett Strong
Said you had done me wrong, but we'll see (We'll see), yeah
What you do to me (What you do to me)
(In the meantime, in the meantime
They won't bother me)

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
They don't bother you, well they don't bother me
Engine too loud on this brand new Ferrari V
So we couldn't hear the haters anyway, pardon me
Girls say I'm one of the biggest heart breakers arguably
Cupid shoot arrows but this girl make my heart bleed
I swear to God if I die she could make my heart beat
Beat, please resuscitate a G
Give me mouth-to-mouth or even give me south-to-mouth
Damn cause you don't know what she do to me
She could kill my soul only thing left is a eulogy
She so hot and ain't another brother cool as me
To get her cold as me I think I gotta buy her jewelry
What she do to me

[Hook 2: Dan Auerbach and (Nicole Wray)]
You don't know, hey
What you do to me (What you do to me, hey)
All I see, yeah, is new to me (Is new to me, yeah)
These strange colors, and all the others, no, they can't see
(Done me wrong, we'll see, we'll see)
Oh mama, (oh) what you do to me
(What you do to me, yeah), yeah
(In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me)

[Verse 2: Billy Danze]
I'm from the hell hole, the total opposite of Melrose
It's where the homies get the money through the steel doors
If you don't know me I suggest you ask your kinfolk
Tell them the man here
Billy Danze here
Black Keys here
Mo-P's here
You say its poppin', if its rockin', listen, we there
(You don't know) come on be clear (whatever you do to me)
You could never ruin me
I'm good, I flooded the hood like AC
I'm modest, so you ain't really gotta praise me
I'm the artist, that's ghetto-ly known as OG
With the (magnum), with forever kid (swagger)
You could never get

[Hook 2: Dan Auerbach and (Nicole Wray)]
You don't know, hey, what you do to me (What you do to me, hey)
All I see, yeah, is new to me (Is new to me, yeah)
These strange colors, and all the others, no, they can't see
(Done me wrong, we'll see, we'll see)
Oh mama, (oh) what you do to me
(What you do to me, yeah), yeah
(In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me)

[Outro: Nicole Wray]
In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me
In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me
Cause in the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me
Oh, yeah, ooh, hey, oh
In the meantime, in the meantime
They won't bother me
In the meantime, in the meantime
Don't let them bother me
Yeah, oh, mm, lord
In the meantime, in the meantime
They won't bother me, oh
They won't bother me, ooh, ooh
In the meantime, in the meantime
They won't bother me
