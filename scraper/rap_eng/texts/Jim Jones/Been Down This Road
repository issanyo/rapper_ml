I been on this road before, I seen this place
I swear I know this hoe, I just don't know her name
Smoking all this dope, I can't feel my face
Using all these drugs, I can't even taste
I been on this road before, I seen this place
I swear I know this hoe, I just don't know her name
Thumbing through the check, I'm just getting paid
Livin how you live, so I got it made

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Lord knows, it's been a long road
And I know niggas took the wrong road
Ended up down shit creek
Think about, so that shit deep, so I pour liquor for all my niggas
That's down bottom like 6 feet
Said throw the money let a bitch eat
Said baby girl I ball hard hear my kicks scream
With D's up when my jumper hit
I might crossover, might duck your bitch
Might drop twenty, hop in the Bentley
Leave out the club all drinnk and shit like
Last nights a blur, but I woke up with a fly girl
So I guess I spent last night with her
Took her back like she had mike in her
Like the bitch like she had dick in her
I beat it up like I was ightin her, puttin in the work
Pipe in her

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Harlem nigga, been everywhere
Everywhere been heavy there
New wheels, every year, no ceiling, be very clear
No roof, so loose like diarrhea from the dairy air
Ghost shit it's been a scary year
Froze wrist like periaer
New watch, rich nigga shit
Coupe top is like a stripper bitch
So loud when I hit the spliff took 4 bottles to hit the bitch
Ugh, baby girl say need some change
I talk to her, and baby girl gave me some brains
College girls, she was in the books
But this college girl was a wild girl
Cause this college girl she was into crooks
In and out when I'm in the pussy
I'm talkin in and out like I'm in the juice
When I whip away, watch a nigga push like
