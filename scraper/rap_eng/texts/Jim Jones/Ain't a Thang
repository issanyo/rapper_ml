[Hook: Paul Wall]
Money ain't a thang, paper ain't nothin'
When you're in a black Maybach on buttons
Cutting these bops, got dimes by the dozen
Higher than a kite and I'mma keep on puffin'
Money ain't a thang, paper ain't nothin'
When you're in a black Maybach on buttons
Cutting these bops, got dimes by the dozen
Higher than a satellite and I'mma keep on puffin'
'Cause money ain't a thang

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
In all black like a funeral
Hustle all night long to stack numeros
Serve 'em up something raw like a tuna roll
I'm in love with dead men but no Bruno bro
I'm talking presidents fresher than a peppermint
Grinding while you waiting on your workers comp settlement
My sentiments are get money and keep it trill
And I ain't stopping till the earth stays still
A wild one for real, my grind never yield
Paper chasing while you with your girl watching Dr. Phil
And fuck how you feel, what you think and you say
Get you wig split open like a fillet

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Hoodies and checks, blow
I'm back from the death like The Crow
All black trucks, strapped up .44
I'm all that and what, act up there I go
And that's just a warning, black Murci√©lago
That's just the foreign, we likes to party
That's to the morning, I got 'em in deep like a coffin
The pink dolphins got 'em freaking, take caution
The Vs are awesome, we straight speeding all you see is exhaustion
I'm paranoid, detouring to the home
We don't say two words on the same phone
That's how the game go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Time flies when you're dancing on the clouds
Grill got 'em seeing stars, you'll swear it was Tinseltown
I'm holding it down, profile is profound
And profit for seeing profits, post it ten [?] down
See I get it year round, I serve 'em like subpoenas
On the Melbow tippy toe strutting like ballerinas
Fresher then the cleaners, eight series beamers
If you jealous and hating then you can eat a whole penis
TV Johnny timepiece, mouthpiece reign
Educated dime giving Einstein brains
I'mma get mine snow, summer and rain
Now I'm clocking my gain, hold up mane

[Hook]
