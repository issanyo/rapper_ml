[Juelz Santana]
I'm overdosin again, I'm oversmokin again
That potent smoke I'm smokin is comatose in my wind
And I only know a few friends that's oh so loco to man (C'Mon)
They will C4 the whole Volvo you in
And ladies let me zoom, zoom
All through your poon, poon
And this will be Santana's boom boom Boom Room (Yup)
I'm a new breed or what y'all call true G's
I'ma start to make you fleas, start to salute me (Come On)
Swim fish I'm a shark in this blue sea
Hungry, I swam from Antartica's blue sea (Whoa)
Override the pressure for coke I buy compressors
Oversize the stretcher 'til it's oversized then sell it
Oversize the shellin to oversize the swellin
Overpop the led in to oversize his melon (Go, Come On)
That's what you call overshot you get it?
I'm over hot you get it? Like coke in pots you get it?

Your ride ain't safe (Warning) As I flyin up 8th (Warning)
Gettin high like space (Warning) .45 on waaiiisssst ('Jects, nigga!)
We don't need to see no badge
Cause we racin up on this highway
Speedin like we gon' craaaash (Fuck Police)
Let's go sightseein, but this cold night scene
Got my homey shot dead, he was only 19 (19! RIP)
They blew his brains off his shoulders
That petty money over slangin them boulders (Continues everyday)
Pumpin grams off the stoop (Uh-huh)
Cold nights, sold white
Duckin a van full of spooks (Watch the squalies)
Hundred gram on them coupes
Blow Dice, rolled dice
Underhand to the deuce (Life's a gamble)
I done spent some days
In the midst of the 'Jects
Gettin bent some days (Twisted, backwards)
With my trip, below set
Runnin up on you niggas cause that rent had to be paid (That's right)

[Hook - short version]
Niggas come along would you ride wit me? (Go, come on)
Bitches come along would you ride with me? (Go, come on)
People come along would you ride wit me? (Go, come on)
Ride wit me, Ride wit me, Ride wit me.. (C'mon)
