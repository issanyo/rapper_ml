Dipset, Jim Jones, Freaky
Aight, Santana man
Killa, let's do it man, killa
Aiyyo, I argue with my mother, spring, summer, fall and winter time
Get that off the table Cam'Ron, it's dinner time
I got a line downstairs ma, I'm in the grind
From ten to nine, you do your business right, let me attend to mine
You cooking pork anyway, I ain't into to swine
You out ya mind, nah, you don't know what's in my mind
I'ma surpass crack, move on to Nasdaq
But still my connects move anthrax on Amtrak
Aiyyo, Cam before the cops rush, close the spot
Load the Glocks they stuntin', we control the block
They frontin' we throw them shots and laugh at 'em
Shoots from the forty-four Magnum, that's how we get back at 'em
Trap 'em, grab 'em and clap at 'em
Yeah, I do this for my lost tribes and Africans
Who lost lives in battling, forty-five's and hackling'
I believe in black soldiers, black clovers
Black roses on your grave, snakes and black cobras
Black vultures, rats roaches, sleep now, the laugh's over
Fucka
You can catch real niggas, doing some real things, for real money
'Cause real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas don't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich
You could catch real niggas, doing some real things, for real money
Real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas won't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich
Now how you losers want it , tell me
We can leave the war out, or ball out I used to frontin', holmes
I throw away 20's on boots and stuntin'
Waste 50's, and abuse my hundreds, I'm getting money, yep
I spend thousands on the shoes for the coup it's nothing
Plus big truckin', too it's nothing
I lick a shot, so he know I meant it
His soldiers dented, so is his rented
Supreme soloist and still co-defendant
A mean motorist that blows the fifth on defendants
Since roota-rooda, the Motorola, yes sir, I'm splendid
You see the furs and pendants, Austin Sigoto, drop though
Hitting curves like Emitt from Europe, Smith
If you ain't get it, the fifth'll hit your fitted
Clips I get it spitted, flip your wig I really lift it
I'm this burgundy Benz, swervin' B as I'm watching the snow fall
I'm watching the heads they copping the coke y'all
And to the fiends and junkies, that go through dreams of drunkies
Hoes with low-esteem, you know they scream in their monthly
And to my soldiers rocking green in the country
Keep your dean and stay hungry, let's get this cream and get money
Them haters wishing they could see my demise
Break my moms heart, the grief in her eyes
Man that eats me alive, roll the weed and get high
This what keep me alive, listen to me
My Dip Gang man, the peeps that'll ride
Over me the same peeps that have died
If it's me that catch
Real niggas, doing some real things, for real money
'Cause real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas don't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich
Yeah, you could catch real niggas, doing some real things
For real money
Real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas won't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich
