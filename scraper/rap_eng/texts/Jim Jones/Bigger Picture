Yo these stories I spit, I seen 'em I wrote 'em
Like a teen he was boastin, "La Vida Loc'in"
In his dream I awoke him, the Beamer I drove it
It was the beam that I showed him, that I keep by my scrotum
I seen him I showed him, I leand him I told him
The Demons arose and, bullets, pull it
A hour just to clean 'em and load em, doggy
You had a slow summer, I didn't H.2 gold Hummer
Not to mention new Range, no number
And you know the Rover...so move over soldier
Flavor Coca Cola, garage the soda holder!!
And its over over!! heres a clover dojer
I'm that nigga now, everyone that knows ya told ya
Byrd Gang but we live by the codes of Coberas
Hoopties, drive by's, long nose through Nova's
If you dope I dope ya, where the pimps are colder
The end is over, Coroner come roll him over
And I dont just look real, this crook deals coke
Only thing whiter dog is Brooke Shields
Harlem, holla back, how the hood feel
Platinum, Im that real...you that shook deal
Took deals out the building, up the block
Up 29 flights, plugged up with the Roc
Now its...hurtin ya heart to see Dame fuckin wit me
Worse than that, the whole game fuckin wit me
A little beef, a few lames fuckin wit me (Nas)
They actin like success it came luckily
The same lame duckin me, the same dame in love wit me
Dip-Set be one set I claim is sucker free!!
Dont Fuck Wit Me

When it comes to beef, YES!! indeed it get hazardous
Seeds can't be saved by JESUS Of Nazareth
Sell my nigga weed, its halarious
They squeese at the cabbages, seeds in the carrage's (the kids)
Thieves, Bronx, Queens, and the Razamith
Milk, and Ock Mu will come steaming the Ratchet BITCH!
Transactions, (in the) loby get done
Being cocky is fun, and these are Versace air ones!
Yea, thanks alot, its been great Dame
My bitch is a great Dame, my dog is a GREAT DANE
You know me, Iâ€™m from the 2, 4, and A train
Now I got 6 homes, 10 cars, 8 names
I might be Charles Johnson, John Bronson
Oscar Martinez, Omar Swanson
And dont front, I'm jingelin baby
Chains, bracelet, rings, blingin all crazy
Rob me? I think that he's crazy
Violets, Orchids, reefs, roses, they'll be brngin him daisys!!
I tell bitches that I'm "Sa Da Te", Fellacio in the tower of my casa...AYYY
All they say is "Papa play" but I pop shit, pop guns, and pop some Ye!!

And I dont care where you been, or what Jail
GO TELL DISNEY ALL YA FUCKIN DUCKTALES!!!
