[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
I'm black and proud, with a big 4.5 and a pack of loud
I stay gased up, my kick-door niggas stay masked up
Had the drop head back but I hopped in bad had to pull a Mike Tyson off and crashed up
Look too good and you come through the hood then a stupid motherfucker get his ass stopped
Give me ten birds I'll wrap the town, nigga push up in the back and get 'em
Graduated class cause all I need is math in the school of hard knocks, no cap & gown
Riding around with Scooter, with my top down let them see the hooters
Road killers you can get the shooters, eating dinner dinner Peter Lugers
Riding dirty on Pete street, come by yourself when you meet me
Make one call to my nigga young street you gone have them young killers with the street heat
With the street heat, you gone have them young killers with the street heat
Either that nigga or you see a black nigga riding by in Lamborghinis going beep beep
