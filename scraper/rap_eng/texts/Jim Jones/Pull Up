[Hook]
Pull up with a hunnit niggas
Smelling like a lot of weed
Pocket full of hunnit beans
We them niggas on the scene
We been them niggas with hunnit niggas
Smelling like a lot of weed
Pocket full of hunnit beans
We them niggas on the scene
We been them niggas

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Still running around like a hunnit deep
Fuck you think, ain't nothing sweet
Might fly to your town, then fly niggas down, then come to your block like a hunnit deep
All black truck, guns in the jeep
Loft Miami straight from the beach
Might ? liquor, get something to eat
A nigga do trip, give him something to keep
New York nigga don't play that
2 door with the seat way back (Facts)
Nigga due owed better pay that
These niggas right here want pay back
When I had the braids going straight back
I was straight gang banging like A wack
Now my wrist all rocky like A$AP
You about that life then say that
Shouts to my niggas in Ksack
Some come home, nigga some go straight back
My nigga side ? did 8, came home nigga like "Yo where the cake at?"
Niggas wanna trip, then we hit em with the clip, and we shoot a nigga up like take that, take that, take that
Like Diddy voice in 94' we ?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
A hunnit deep looking like a stampede
Who you muggin' nigga? You don't do a damn thing
Touch one nigga get your whole head knocked off
Big blunt got me smelling like hot sauce
Pocket full of money I feel like a teller
Slide in a bitch I'm stepping on Marcellos
Step on a scene got these niggas all jealous
Whole team fresh like a pack of gum
Hunnit niggas yes that's a hunnit guns
A hunnit funerals, that's a hunnit nuns
Touch Capo get a shot to the head
Touch ? Feel your ass up with lead
Touch Greezy we'll leave your ass sleep
Yeah we them niggas that's up on the scene
Got niggas watching you, watching with beams
Vamp life, all you fuck niggas in dreams
Freddy on the beat I'm a nightmare nigga
A hunnit deep so don't fight that nigga
If I don't got my gun, got my knife here nigga
So don't fuck around, lose your life here nigga
Up in the club we mobbin' with Zoe's
Miami vamps you know how it goes
Fresh as fuck we bring the cameras out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
These niggas be fraudulent and these bitches be faking
All my niggas not cases, but never made no statements
I dropped out of them bandos
I kept me some montaga
When the night fall I switch cars, my garage look like acres
I feel like Floyd when he in the ring
Made a quarter mill with the Billie Jean
Big 45 with the limousine
Turn a nigga beef into chili cheese
Keep my lungs full of collard greens
But we on though by any means
I need sprite and a pint of lean
All broads get the Jimmy Dean
Hit the block with a Glock, it's a rock, watch the ball like I'm in the league
It's a blackout
When I'm booked for a show it's a packed house
I live that shit y'all rap 'bout
Get a bad bitch blow her back out
You know a nigga bringing them stacks out
Straight to the studio from the trap house
Got my first rap check blew it all on a chain
That's 20k on a nigga neck now
