Capo, what's my mother-fuckin name (DipSet)
Eastside (code red) say what, what's my mother-fuckin name (DipSet)
DipSet, Byrd Gang

[Hook]
Catch that boy Capo
Cruising up 8th with the top low, and the cops low, (Squalie)
I'm a DipSet boss
You don't wanna get clapped get caught up in the cross, (dip low)
And I'm caught up in the floss
Chain 500 thou' cause I'm brought up in the gloss, (Balling)
And I'm caught up in the cross
I'm a winner I ain't tryin to get caught up with a loss, (No way)

[Verse 1]
Now when the hell would it stop (never)
I keep evading the law getting tailed by the cops (Fuck 'em)
I keep breakin the law got a bail on spot
You can't cool me off, tried to tell you I'm hot, (sizzlin')
Goin hard for 16
Livin that fast life like I'm made for the big screen, (Lights, Camera, Action)
And y'all know how I get in the club
A nigga knew the bouncer, a 4-fifth in the club
I try to two step, 4-fifth can't budge
So I'm posted in the back while I'm twistin up bud (Haze)
Got some hoes in the back and they sippin on suds
Blowin smoke on the dough, poppin Cris' with the thugs
Shit, I'm a boss I said
A DipSet gangsta I don't cross my legs, (what else)
G's up eastside code red (DipSet)
Beef what, we ride low pay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What they gonna do with the Capo, (nothing)
Got a hard body clique that'll shoot for the Capo, (that's right)
When they drive by the strip they saluting the Capo, (Eastside)
Keep one fly bitch up in the coupe with the Capo, (You know)
Now a days all it pays to come jukin them macho's, (say what)
The other half must think I'm suite cause I gato, (Fuck 'em)
Or maybe its because I keep pants off my ass, (kiss my ass)
I am my own boss, I only answer for cash, (you hear that)
I only fear the law, so fuck a man with a badge, (Fuck bullies)
And I'm tryin to duck the law dogs I'm getting indicted
They done showed me the money shit the kid got excited
So if the kid get an inch well I'm takin a yard
And if the kid do get bitch well I'm takin a yard
(that's right the life nigga) That's till the day that I'm charged
We be leavin out the club my crew racin the cars
Who's at your favorite broad

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I done ran through most clubs that they have in my city (what else)
Dancing in the spot with my hammer getting pissy
One hand up on the bitch other hand on my blizzy, (gangsta)
I kicked my G mac tryin to slip her a mickie
Lord help the boy they tryin get me (what else)
Always pull me over they be dyin to frisk me (fuck 'em)
Car smell like weed and I be reakin of liquor, (always)
Told me I was free but they see I'm the nigga, (just mad at me)
I gotta leave 'em one bigger
I said I'm from a hood where police getting hit up
Get up, lets not make it a issue
But if a nigga piss me off I'm goin straight to the pistol, (that's for sho')
Then we could make it official
Next time you see ya mom, won't be awake when she kiss you, (My baby)
I'm just tryin to get some paper
And avoid all the haters

[Hook]
