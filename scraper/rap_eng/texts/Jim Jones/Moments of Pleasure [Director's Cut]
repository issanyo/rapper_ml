[Intro]
Some moments that I've had
Some moments of pleasure

[Verse 1]
I think about us lying
Lying on a beach somewhere
I think about us diving
Diving off a rock into another moment

[Verse 2]
The case of George the Wipe
Oh God, I can't stop laughing
This sense of humour of mine
It isn't funny at all
But we sit up all night talking about it

[Hook - Humming]

[Verse 3]
On a balcony in New York
It's just started to snow
He meets us at the lift
Like Douglas Fairbanks
Waving his walking stick
But he isn't well at all
The buildings of New York
Look just like mountains through the snow

[Hook - Humming]

[Verse 4]
And I can hear my mother saying
"Every old sock meets an old shoe"
Every old sock...

[Outro]
Hey there, Bubba, dancing down the aisle of a plane
's Murph, playing his guitar refrain
Hey there, Teddy, spinning in the chair at Abbey Road
Hey there, Michael, do you really love me?
Did you really love me?
