I need to rewind these plays from the top
Hey, call me...
Baby girl sweat cold as a cellar
So cold I'm about to go get a sweater

Ka-ching!
Go Cinderella!

Put me on the mix
You so spin, Cinderella!
A towel, show me the coat for the weather
A chauffer, how about a holly umbrella?
Go Cinderella!
Let's go Cinderella!
Let me now when you wanna go
Cause whenever, ever, ever I'll be...
I will never do the... I'll be your patron
Yeah! You can turn me in my zone
Ain't nobody throwing rocks, but I'll probably get in stones

Be aware what you want, girl

Came to the club just to borrow a vanilla
I know I do, I trust...
But the bitch start acting a little too Cinderella
No glass slipper...
Shit it!
Both hills above one hill
And I watch getting you chills...
You all looking good in a skirt and a brow
With them big body...
With the bitch getting touching feelings
Cause I took the...
Now we're in the street with the nipples out

She rocks Luis Vuitton, Gucci, Fendi,..

In the club getting low, with a tag on the dress
You know that, take a close back
After the party to the morgue, get her dough back
Take a code act, grab my balls at
F*ck all these models with a...
Yeah!...

Got slow, no, no ex-games
Get straight to the... sex cage
