I use my
Youth blood to get through the night
Cause I'm a vampire
Vampires hurting for fun
(Who's vamping)
I use my
Youth blood to get through the night
(I get my money in the night time)
Cause I'm a vampire, vampires hurting for fun
(Who's coming out at night baby)

Come alive in the night time
Come alive in the right time
When the sun goes down and the moon go up come alive in the night time
A hundred thou for the right time
Fifty thou make Christ shine
This casual swept minds
Live fast with the right line
I am on that roll scoop
Lane back on that orange juice
Few cups of that get them hoes loose
So we can take this shit to London
Passport is your stepped up
I beat that fish she jumped in told us she is all vamped up
She from up town rock high heels, top down my fly wheels
I am sick of my YL pop champagne I am a lot of steel
So god bless that hard stress
Say a Prayer it Could be worse, if thatâ€™s beef then wheres desert
I am pimping hard till I hit the dirt

I should down before I wait
Till I die watering
Presidential type of face
Heavy metal was side to waste
Made back (?)
Rose get higher grades
Take you up to a higher place vampires out of space
Penthouse with a fire place clear view of Empire states
Clear view get your mind astraid talk slick I fire
Trash back of (?)
Most niggers is disgrace
I am drop top down the real ave drop the top just to hear them hate
Gotta (?) made to the porsche, switch lanes six things of course
Life is a bitch, wife that bitch, married to the game (?)
Big wash like I'm here to floss
My niggas hustle like fuck the struggle
FED is a scary thought

Only we vamp through the night
You niggas keep sleeping and get slepped on
Or get crapped on
My money coming bank rolls nigga

So I need my cash on demand)
