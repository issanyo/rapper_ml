[Hook: Pooh Bear]
I need the pots and the pans
I cook that dough with one hand
Fuckin' bitches then I leave 'em
Bitches hit me then they bleepin'
I pull up in foreigns, I hurt 'em
I bust and I bust, I got work
Sippin' champagne with two bitches
They know I'm that nigga
Excuse me my dear
These shoes cost a couple of thousand
This watch and this ring on my wrist
This shit cost a couple of thousand
My bag and my shoes and my bling
This shit cost a couple of thousand
This woman I'm [?]
This shit cost a couple of thousand
Excuse me my dear

[Verse 1: Pooh Bear]
9-11, yeah I rollin'
Panamera, got the hoes in it
Balenciagas, niggas strollin'
'Bout to buy it, nigga, no limit
I get to the money, there's no limit
You can get your bitch back when I'm done with her
Got the Rollie and cuban links on the jacket
With the Kickz that's sold in it
This Fendi is holdin' my pants up
That 30 is holdin' my pants down
Nigga, fuck what you heard, I do way better
Black foreign and the seats leather
Nigga black minx and the shades leather
Bad black bitch and her name's Sarah
Talkin' first class, I can fly whenever
Talkin' first class, I can fly whenever
Whippin' that dope in the Bentley
I'm sippin' that lean when it's empty
Rollin' that dope in the backwoods
Keepin' that .30 extendo, I wish you would
Excuse me my dear for the foreign bitches
Phone calls, many mentions
My flow is so stupid, so brazy
You might just mistake me for Marilyn Manson

[Hook: Pooh Bear]
I need the pots and the pans
I cook that dough with one hand
Fuckin' bitches then I leave 'em
Bitches hit me then they bleepin'
I pull up in foreigns, I hurt 'em
I bust and I bust, I got work
Sippin' champagne with two bitches
They know I'm that nigga
Excuse me my dear
These shoes cost a couple of thousand
This watch and this ring on my wrist
This shit cost a couple of thousand
My bag and my shoes and my bling
This shit cost a couple of thousand
This woman I'm [?]
This shit cost a couple of thousand
Excuse me my dear

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Ain't no excuses in here
Kobe numbers, adjustin' in my whip
I make my roof disappear
I buy a newer Sedan
I bought the shoes that I wear
I drop a cheque on my fly
Them bitches check out my fly
We ride in foreigns on land
We takin' jets in the sky
We poppin' bottles on Sunday
We livin' cause we all destined to die
I was just cheffin' the pies
I was just stretchin' the pies
I still be ridin' through the hood
In the drop just to go check out the 5's
Niggas know I bang with the Bentley gang
Reppin' the 5
But don't be silly man
I get illy man, takin' a ride
I got broads in the H
Strap my broads up and wait
Buy new cars with the plates
All my cars in the race, nigga, nigga

[Hook: Pooh Bear]
I need the pots and the pans
I cook that dough with one hand
Fuckin' bitches then I leave 'em
Bitches hit me then they bleepin'
I pull up in foreigns, I hurt 'em
I bust and I bust, I got work
Sippin' champagne with two bitches
They know I'm that nigga

This shit cost a couple of thousand
My bag and my shoes and my bling
This shit cost a couple of thousand
