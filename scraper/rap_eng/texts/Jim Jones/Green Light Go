[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
And every summer buy the newest drop
Popping bottles, taking super models to the block
If it ain't fat, put two up in the back
Alligator strapped, why you do it like that?
Pour so many bottles I'mma need another section
Blowers on the shoes, but the feet was P.M.S.ing
Bad rap bone, valentino clutches
V-12 automatic Lamborghini clutches
Party all night and we duck the morning
It's vampire life, nigga, fuck the morning
Leaving out the club, jump in the foreign
Then we valet the car leaving with the tourin'

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Got whip all clean and top off too
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?
Got shorty in the club and her girlfriends too
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?
Green light go, green light go
Green light go, green light go, green light go
I got all this money and nothing to do
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
We ain't worried about no petty threats
Big jewelry on nigga making heavy bets
We got the bank stop and whatevers left
I hit esage back, but he never left
One thing about beef, man, it never rests
Catch you in the street and put your head to rest
Matter fact it's double R's in my head rest
Get money, BIG said it best
Snatchin (?) put the (?) on her
Blow her brains out like I put the fifth on her
Should be a crime the way I catch them bodies
Now I take her down for a sexy hottie

[Hook]

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
We got loomy in the club with his fake ass crew
Damn, tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Green light go, green light go
Green light go, green light go

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
From millionaires, fellas too
I'm on like the Cardier Bell on Blu
Listen clear what Im tellin' you
I make the roof disappear when I'm bailin' through
Two shots, that's a bad attempt
Circle around your block paper tag tents
Spend a couple hundred when I had to vent
Dealer didn't have it then I had to sin
Chanel bags cost six large
Pretty women hopping outta big cars
500 horses with the Ferrari sounds
And I solemnly swear I will never tell

[Hook]

[Outro]
