[Intro:]
Ain't nothing else to do, yeah
Ain't nothing else to do

[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
I still get the call from my up north niggas
I ain't had no time to write a letter to you
I'm hopin' that you got the money sent to you
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
Ain't nothing else to do
I still come through drop top no roof
I still see the hatin' man the hate is in you
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper

[Verse 1: Trav]
Taking all these drugs so I could stay up
Remember plenty nights that I would't wake up
Praying on my God to get my weight up
No 9 to 5 for no paper
I would rather hustle get this yayo
Hoping one day that it pay off
They don't see me how I see you
Free Rock, free Body
Free Rich, free Twin
Free Dove, free Ty Ty
Them my niggas till the end
Last time my homie going in, here we go again
I gotta get this paper
Everyday I win

[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
I still get the call from my up north niggas
I ain't had no time to write a letter to you
I'm hopin' that you got the money sent to you
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
Ain't nothing else to do
I still come through drop top no roof
I still see the hatin' man the hate is in you
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Think about the times that I had my rights read to me
Few niggas I was scared they might bring feds to me
Had to switch it up had my whole life ahead of me
Think about Light can't forget what he said to me
He told me get money stop selling drugs
It didn't make sense until I stopped selling drugs
And then we started selling raps like we was selling drugs
And then I bought cars didn't know where the ceiling was
Sport cars show you what a quarter million does
In a room full of hate tryna feel the love
But, ready to step it up though
If I ain't got the hammer steal a nigga like a klepto
Shit, drop a bag and kill a nigga like muerto
Young nigga had a ulcer from the XO
Shit, these young niggas show em culture like it's strep throat
Woah, it's too deep something you might not catch though

[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
I still get the call from my up north niggas
I ain't had no time to write a letter to you
I'm hopin' that you got the money sent to you
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
Ain't nothing else to do
I still come through drop top no roof
I still see the hatin' man the hate is in you
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper

[Verse 3: King Jigg]
South Beach in Miami blowing them bands
Heard we was stunting in the Masi like damn
He just want a couple flicks from the gram
A package and a pinky free my niggas in the can
Feds scoop the cheese they talking kingpin charge
Tryna give him 25 with a L in the yard
I miss my lil brodie AR
I told him fall back but he wanted to go hard
Shit got hot I told him to cool off
Caught him by them crackers in Maine where they go off
Still getting it shipped by them boat yard
Had him snorting lines by the bar with the coast guard

[Bridge: Trav]
My niggas go retarded yellow school bus
You don't want me call up my young shooter
Drive-bys out the uber
EMS coming scoop ya

[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
I still get the call from my up north niggas
I ain't had no time to write a letter to you
I'm hopin' that you got the money sent to you
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
Ain't nothing else to do
I still come through drop top no roof
I still see the hatin' man the hate is in you
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do
Ain't nothing else to do but get paper
