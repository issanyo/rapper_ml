American Gangster is what i want to be
The song goes thru my ears,but it's to loud
My feather used to be a gangster in his band
He was a mexaen then he turned into a american
So everyone called him AMERICAN GANGSTER
I became one just like him
I got in a band just like him

I did everything just like him
I came home my mother just stared at meee uh...i screamed just like
Him. then i looked him
