[Intro: Jim Jones]
(Heatmakerz, crack music)
Dipset
It's more than just music
You know the rest
Jones, nigga

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Try to blackball me, so I ask 'em where the hoop at (ballin')
Then in SOHO in LA, askin' the valet where the coupe at
(What up with that?)
80 for the jet that meet with Jay and then I flew back (facts)
The Ace of Spade they put up on my tab, a extra two stacks
Signin' my deal, they asked if I would sign for a mil' (for what?)
I ask them why would I do that when I already signed for a mil' (You hear me?)
I'm a contract killer, bitch, had to sign up to kill (B-b-boom!)
Put you on the boom list, the homies'll line you for real (FACTS!)
But I'm tryna just chill, 'cause my mind is too ill (Oh)
Don't provoke 'em too much, 'cause we commit crimes for the thrill (Grrr) I'm a fuckin' bandit, you under-fuckin-stand it? (you hear me)
I run with G's, nigga, fuck who the fuck you ran with (Fuck 'em)
New York City, home of the pretty women (Harlem what's up?)
Where you gotta get the dough before you get the women
(Get your money up)
Middle of the winter, I'm buyin' shit to swim in (facts nigga)
Nigga, you just buyin' them cars that my niggas been in

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
So there was once upon a time when them niggas tried to kill us
Started gettin' money, so them bitches start to feel us (hey baby)
DA told the judge they a bunch of drug dealers (fuck 'em)
Throwin' up gang signs like they on them four wheelers (Eastside)
So there was once upon a time when them niggas tried to kill us
Started gettin' money, so them bitches start to feel us (hey baby)
DA told the judge they a bunch of drug dealers (fuck 'em)
Throwin' up gang signs like they on them four wheelers (Eastside)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I-I, I got acres in the boonies, I remember it was gloomy
And I only had five on it, somethin' like the Luniz
Now the Maybach is roomy, spent a 100K in Bloomies
But I got my own clothes (3 million I made in Zumiez, baby!)
Legend, I maneuver cars (true)
Who want smoke? I have it lookin' like a hookah bar
Superstar, car ceiling lookin' like Mars, Venus, Jupiter
Pull strings like Garth Brooks on a new guitar
We the shit, we the shit, some foul manure
Long live the Set, GLORY GLORY HALLELUJAH!
Welcome back to the hallway loiterers (hello)
I made mils off the white girl, I exploited her (fact)
No disrespectin' the ladies, words from my team (why?)
That's the reason Dame smacked Harvey Weinstein (pervert)
On the set of Paid In Full, y'all gave him hell about it
Some foul shit happened once, Capo, tell 'em about it

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
So there was once upon a time when them niggas tried to kill us
Started gettin' money, so them bitches start to feel us (hey baby)
DA told the judge they a bunch of drug dealers (fuck 'em)
Throwin' up gang signs like they on them four wheelers (Eastside)
So there was once upon a time when them niggas tried to kill us
Started gettin' money, so them bitches start to feel us (hey baby)
DA told the judge they a bunch of drug dealers (fuck 'em)
Throwin' up gang signs like they on them four wheelers (Eastside)
