[Intro:]
(Ice, ice, ice, ice)

[Pre-Chorus:]
I’m a n*gga in the hood that’s what they’re telling me now, now, now
I put the ice in it it’s a different felony now, now
I push a button in the shit and watch the hoes go different
Man listen rags cover my n*gga lips
You gotta be waiting till 4:50
Y’all know me

[Chorus:]
Pull a bullet
Pull a bullet on my dope boy shit
I know you see the ice cold risk
Pull a bullet n*gga
Pull a bullet n*gga do you take a bitch

[Verse 1:]
Show shorty at the dealer
A bad bitch didn’t know shorty was a killer
You know we keep it reala
Shoulda take a trip and put the 40 in the villa
When a bitch gets a chance in a hits in the bungalow
With my drop laid back in my seat with a gumbo lo
They say I’m living high strung
So I gotta keep it humble oh
And my little n*gga just caught a body bout a month ago
He didn’t make it through the summer
That’s the pure definition of a cold summer
Trust the daddy-o on a fed charge
Back a n*gga bitch still on a head nod
All I need is eye contact

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I am the n*gga they talking about
Off of my neighborhood cuz they know I’m the shit
Wrap up that coker and stuff that big tofer
It’s common my n*gga let’s go and get real
Ain’t nothing to it, my n*gga let’s do it
We got it let’s get it don’t work in the risk
Them twenties them fifties them hunneds
Be calling me constantly calling me get off my biz
Maintain that swing low
Remind me how the big B hoe
In the biz by the tango
Got your biz popping pussies on tango
Keep a big bankroll
Get your head in a body bag
Bout to stream a n*gga on the missed you for a lot of bread
How the fuck you gonna renig when your home is spread
You used to be Gs, working with the feds

[Chorus]
