Don't know if I want Keyshia, Felicia or Emma
There's somethin' 'bout each one of them, all of them special
Been all around the world
There's so many girls with different qualities
Everyone seem to have somethin' I want

I need that one
Couple of things [Incomprehensible] she's the one
Think I'm sure, tell me what this grown man should do
I gotta have her but I want you too, I'm so confused

I love her, I love you
But I love her and her too
They all could be the one
So how can I pick one, one, one, one
When I love them all?

I love her, I love you
But I love her and her too
They all could be the one
So how can I pick one, one, one, one
When I love them all?

I love her but baby, I love you
Good with love but money's feelin' nothin' like I knew
Give me dear if only she could dress like you
And you could walk the way she does, ooh, ooh

I need that one
Couple things [Incomprehensible] she's the one
Think I'm sure tell me what this grown man should do
I gotta have her but I want you to I'm so confused

I love her, I love you
But I love her and her too
They all could be the one
So how can I pick one, one, one, one?

I love her, I love you
But I love her and her too
They all could be the one
So how can I pick one, one, one, one
When I love them all?

I gotta have it now what I'm gone do
I gotta have her but I want her too
So now I need help with my obsessions
I'm workin' on my addictions
By stoppin' for all the pretty girls
In the cars I be whippin'

In my position, I'm ballin' like the Pistons, I'm on fire
I stop drop and I roll and I watch 'em get it
They see the moon is like a vampire bit 'em
I scoop 'em, hit 'em and dip 'em turn 'em into honey dippas

The money gettas is what the ladies be callin' us
Actin' like they ignorin' us really they be on all of us
And all of us we can take a flight
You, you, you and her and we can make it right

I love her, I love you
But I love her and her too
They all could be the one
So how can I pick one, one, one, one?

I love her, I love you
But I love her and her too
They all could be the one
So how can I pick one, one, one, one?

I love her, I love you
But I love her and her too
They all could be the one
So how can I pick one, one, one, one
When I love them all?

I love her, I love you
But I love her and her too
They all could be the one
So how can I pick one, one, one, one
When I love them all?
