[Hook: Axel Leon & Jim Jones]
Raindrops fallin' in the drop
Whoa
No ID blowin' on the couch
Whoa
*scoff* *scoff* I'm lettin' yo man know
If he front he's never leavin' the bando
Raindrops fallin' in my ?Dom? (whoa)
Took ya bitch home early in the morn (whoa)
*automatic gunshots* start lettin' yo man know
If he front, he's never leavin' the bando

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Start lettin' these chumps know
Bout to cop the new Prezzie like Trump hoe
Game, we got floor seats, vice in the front row
Niggas want war then we right at your front door (knock knock)
Suicidin' the door up while the sun glow
Bitch hangin' off the roof of the drop, tell her jump hoe
I'm not Jamaican but you dun kno I been duckin the boys since the 21 Jump show
Shit, they tried to trap me off while I was trappin' soft
Huh, I let the roof fall while I was backin' off
Shit, you gotta watch the Feds they tryina snatch a boss
A nigga too slick I get a bitch to drop the package off
So the boys can't find a connection
I be in places where ya phone can't find a connection (Rome)
So fly that they think I get dressed in the air
I'm at the dealer tryina buy what's next for next year, like

[Verse 2: Axel Leon]
Rag missin' on the rooftop
Reverse bandana bitch I feel like 2Pac
I'm with Jimmy like Juelz Santana, Freekey, Killa, we know niggas who call niggas to get you shot
Pink slip we put up Lambos
Red flaggin' with guns, shoot 'em up Rambo
*scoff* *scoff* start lettin' ya man know
If he front he's never leavin' the bando
Got the plug for the drugs, that ???
Got me shinin', I ain't a blood, but I'm icy ?
She got that, love is love, that wifey vibe
Violate, you be runnin' out yo Nikes 5
I'm that Puerto Rican puto
Not Punisher but you know
To tell that truth, I got the juice now, Jugo
Bad stripper in the coupe
Let it rain in the two door
Fucked in all positions like Judo
You know
