[Jim Jones:]
No competitions with these niggas I'm just...
Raised in the green light I'm a go getter
Wrote letter to the money till it came back
And I saw working out no jumping chats
A lot of shit upon my mind that's why I need the flush
I love life but they'll say she got a crush
I never sleep stay awake won't miss a thang
Dream with my eyes open I can see the change
Looking for a speed ahead you can never stop me
Cause my flow is the key, eat your own coffee
I got boss, these rappers don't wanna shot
Cause of what they can't see, I'm a blind spot
Haters misplace love quote Wayne for that
I say it's HIV... blacks
That's that, you know what it is
Don't need to name names you can suck my shhh
If yo all like me don't love me when I'm gone
If yo all like me don't love me when I'm gone
That's right, curse you when you're living, bless you when you dying
See the boorish that this people be on
If yo all like me don't love me when I'm gone
If yo all like me don't love me when I'm gone
That's right, curse you when you're living, bless you when you dying
See the boorish that this people be on
Don't talk about stars and stripes like you got a gun
[The Game:]
I got balls for fights nigga I'm not the one
Compare me to none I can't be 2
And I ain't scared of go so I can't be bulled
You know I stay truth like religion all of my chainz
Everything all good to the dough come between
You mean the Hummy with the big screen
Snatch my niggers out the...
Want that kind of dough... king even drema
On assignment with the team
They be climbing for the green
But I never make it rain, make the snow... me
Fall back like... then the...
Whatever I wanted there's a kid who couldn't afford it
Get deported to the paper, I'm an immigrant
And I want my green card so anybody getting it
You rapping I'm living it you playing I'm a...
On go line I finish score...
If yo all like me don't love me when I'm gone
If yo all like me don't love me when I'm gone
That's right, curse you when you're living, bless you when you dying
See the boorish that this people be on
If yo all like me don't love me when I'm gone
If yo all like me don't love me when I'm gone
That's right, curse you when you're living, bless you when you dying
See the boorish that this people be on
