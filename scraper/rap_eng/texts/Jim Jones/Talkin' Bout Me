[Hook – DJ Spazo]
Man they’re talking bout me
When they’re talking bout getting money, they’re talking bout me
Whole lot of bottles and the models, man they’re talking bout me
Man they’re talking bout me [x3]

[Verse 1 - Trav]
I tell her do it for the Vine, she don’t want to do it
Do it all the time, bitch who you think you fooling
Got money on my mind, only think bout them bands though
Roll another pill, got me feeling like Rambo
Body off the chain, Django
Beat it like a drum, banjo
At the minute getting money, only fronting for the gram though
I do what I want, he do what he can do
[?] bring your bitch, [?] cancer
Running through a check, I got bands though
Want to see you shake it, but no hands though
Bring you back to the crib so I can hand dough
Yo

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Jim Jones]
They used to talk about you now they talk about me
You should hear the hoes, how they talk about me
Brought like two, but it brought me back three
And I thought I was the man when I brought the first key
300 grand when I bought the first B
500 horses when I porsched that V
44 racks when I brought the first Dwelli
I was living like X when the nigga did belly
Fuck you gon tell me, ear to the streets
Gun up in my waist in this million dollar race
If I want him dead, then we kill him, no trace
And I just left the dealer, motherfucker, paper plates
Get money!

[Hook]
