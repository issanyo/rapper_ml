(Let's go home, C)
Young Calogero: Sonny and my father always said that when I get older I would understand. Well, I finally did

I learned to give love and get love unconditionally
You just have to accept people for what they are, and I learned the greatest gift of all
The saddest thing in life is wasted talent...
