2  Worlds, 2 Girls, It Turns Into A Love Triangle
I'll Tell You All About It

So As I Zoom On Blowing Smoke To Get The _ Perfume Off
I Try To Make It Home At A Decent Time So I Don't Look Suspicious
Check The Cell Phone, Erase All The Pictures
Baby Got Me Twisted, Delete Text Mails
I Need To Slow Down, Breathe, Exhale
I Crept Through My House Like I'm On Eggshells
I Was Almost In My Bed So She Believe The Next Tale

Make Me So Happy
And I Don't Wanna Go Home
You Know I'd Rather To Get With You Than Leave Him Alone
Cos You Know Just What To Say, It Seems Like You Understand
You Know Me Just Like A Book, Just Like The Back Of Your Hand
And...

Sometimes I Lay In My Bed
And Think, What Would It Be Like If You Was In My Life
And By My Side
Oh Boy I Can Not Lie
'cos Sometimes I, Sometimes I Wish You Was My Man
Wish You Was My Man

'cos, You'd Be Checking Up On Me
You Make Sure That I'm Ok
You Say That If I Need Anything You're A Phonecall Away
Because My Own Man Don't Take The Time, He Don't Understand
You Treat Me Like I Wanna Be Treated But You're Not My Man
Oh No, You're Not My Man
Oh No, You're Not My Man
You Treat Me Like I Wanna Be Treated But You're Not My Man

And...

Sometimes I Lay In My Bed
And Think, What Would It Be Like If You Was In My Life
And By My Side
Oh Boy I Can Not Lie
'cos Sometimes I, Sometimes I Wish You Was My Man
Wish You Was My Man

So I Would Be More Secure
And I Don't Wanna Cheat
You're Making It Deep...

Sometimes I Lay In My Bed
And Think, What Would It Be Like If You Was In My Life
And By My Side
Oh Boy I Can Not Lie
'cos Sometimes I, Sometimes I Wish You Was My Man
Wish You Was My Man, My Man, My Man
'cos My Man Don't Understand
'cos Sometimes I Lay In My Bed
And I, And Think What Would It Be Like
Sometimes I Wish You Were My Man
