[Intro]
Shit, I done came up baby
You ain't heard?
Vamps

[Hook] x2
I remember when everybody said a nigga wasn't gon' be shit
I was so broke, ain't have no bread
Young nigga couldn't get no bitch
Yeah now, young nigga blessed now
Now I got a check now
I done came up when everybody doubted me
Young nigga on the set now

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
You niggas is buggin, my niggas ain't budging
They stuck in they ways, like fuck it it pays
You get outta line, they busting away
Now trust what I say, I said it before
We ready for war more than every before
We been through some shit, you could never endure
Let's settle the score cause it's way more to it
Talking liquid I need way more fluid
The 40 didn't work told them circle back around
Guaranteed muhfuckers, the K gon' do it
J I double M too
Fly nigga bitches what a couple M's do
I'm at a crab table, what the fuck you into?
I done been around the world, where the fuck you been to?
Every turf you could name a hood
Still get work cause my game is good
I'm great with the heat cause my aim is good
I keep my face on fleek cause my game is good

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
I done came up like a lottery
Nickname me food I swear to God knowing these bitches wanna swallow me
These haters wanna hallow me
But I ain't slippin, even if I'm dolo bet my niggas still there following me
I got the 40 nigga we could engage them shots
Ya brain get popped when I let off them shots
Came up on a check so these niggas hating on me
Got bitches debating on me
And mama she praying for me
Yeah, nigga all this money on me
Got bees they buzzing around me like its honey on me, Ah
Niggas acting funny on me
They love it when I was broke, now they funny homie, but
Nigga I done came up on a check
Name ain't Keith how I make bitches  sweat
Member I was broke living in the projects
Now a nigga on now, they saying I got next

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
I was just a young nigga, been jumped off the porch
Teachers told me I'll never get a Porsche
Now she reading about a nigga on the source
I done came up
Looking like a milli when I step out
A lot of niggas went left on me, now them niggas feel left out
Shit, I was at the bottom, fresh out of jail shit I ain't have a dollar
Back to the trap I was too into the projects
As long as the work good I ain't got a problem
Blame it on the streets, keep a 30 in my shorts
I ain't have a silver spoon I just had a fork
Capo said summertime we should visit north
We squares ? for them prices in New York
I done got my check right, living in that jet life
Drug money, sex life
Went to Vegas one week, 3 bitches in that lingerie
Ain't sleep till the next night
Ayo!
