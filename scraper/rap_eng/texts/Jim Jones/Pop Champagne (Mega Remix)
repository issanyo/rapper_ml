At the pool party chillin, she takin off their towelz

And it's about to get wild, hot tub chillin with bubbles and crystal
About to do it kinky, manage with two girls
Double up a chocolate caramel swirl
Ooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Hot 16, you can tell I'm a freak
I'm a big boy girl, you can tell I like to eat
This is a grown man's game, lil boy go to sleep
But don't trip shawty, I'm so so street

Every verse is fishscale, I triple beam it
Then I freeze my hand up and pinkie ring it
When from nobody on the block to super stardom
Now I got women in Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Harlem
Hit me crib on the Hudson, only if you worthy

I Pop champagne, girl I really love it how you pop that thang
Tell the DJ to never stop that thang
So you can back it up and just drop that thang
Rock that thang, lock that thang
And not even Patrick Willis can block that thang
Got my balls on my back when I cop that thang
Take ya to home base and sock that thang
