[Bridge]
Murder, cash, cars, hoes
Fast life as usual is all that we know

[Verse 1 – Jim Jones]
He has risen, started from a G.O prism (hooptys)
It was hard for me to see my vision (blinded by the light)
Because it's blurred by the V’s, I was driven
I also was distracted by head she was giving (she kept playing)
It made us wonder, it was bread we was getting
And everything we did was forbidden, forget what they do to the law
Well some guys nasty to tame (like who?)
But we must stay anonymous, don’t ask me no names (where’s my lawyer?)
Cause it was all for the capital gain (OK)
How we broke bricks a world and castles of cane (that crack)
The flipside, sports cars faster than lane (Ferrari)
Over the money, bullets’ll tap on your brain (bang bang)
They showed me the money, I started attacking the game (the industry)
I blew a half a mill on my Agassi chain (that’s so ice)
That’s tennis on the neck (ow) now feel the agony
We eating dinner on the jet (yum yum) we spending all the checks
It’s drought season, ain’t looking for life lines
And I’m just reporting like night line

[Hook][x2]
How to be a boss, follow this blueprint
‘fore you kick the bucket, get rich, leave a shoe print
Get your game grown, get your name known
Double park, grab a bitch and get your brain blown

[Bridge]

[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
Nigga we used to shoot bullets in the stop sign
But it would take a thousand bullets and the power of Jesus for you to stop mine
Born a hustler, came here to blow the place up
And swore I was rich till dame told me get my cake up
So more money, more power, more clothes
More overseas Buggatis, more powder, more hoes
I’m the American dream, American cream
Got America leaning and see how we serve American fiends
That’s how we get it, we spit it, split it, and get it good
Snatch it off Wall Street, take it home and get it hood
I wish a nigga would, but a nigga can’t
Tell me I ain’t the boss, I’m fully loaded and you shooting blanks
You couldn’t touch me with your finger
It’s Dipset, bitch the whole city’s full of bangers
And they gang the entertainers
So get your game grown, get your name known
Then say hello to the stainless

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3 – N.O.E.]
Come an hour out of DC, met him at the BP
20 minutes late because his chicken had to pee pee
Feels sneaky, kept in touch weekly
Broader cause he says he hits the pipe and gets sleepy
So hello to VC, watching Anna [?]
My niggas hit the checkers while we wait, it’s greasy
Finally I spot him, he pulls up and sees me
Told me he could front me, but I’m lifting off him easy
Thinking he should keep it, and who you in the Jeep with?
My business is a secret, you too eager to leak it
Too eager to front me, too eager to pump me
In Baltimore them Fetti boys are too eager to hunt me
So I grabbed the rachet, told him “you can match it”
Knowing once he tossed the product over I would mash it
Ain’t pay him but I flashed it, enough to get his pass it
The black owl made his answer classic, the bastard

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro – Jim Jones]
It’s all we know
That fast life
Getting that fast money
Sun down to sun up
This what they taught us from a young age
We was put here people
That’s why they follow us the way they do because we made it lucrative
We turned a negative into positive and we me making a lot of fucking money from it
By the way, smile for the camera
It’s not only paparazzi taking flicks out here
I guess they pissed off at us people
We young, black, rich, and famous
Yo we got buttons to press, shit
Sounding like Bush, nigga I start a war off the bleep of my phone
That’s boss talk for you
But I’d rather get the money
The best wars are the ones without violence fucker
Bang bang
