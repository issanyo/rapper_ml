[Hook: Quicktrip]
I got a pack that said jumpin' out the gym
I took a flight to Harlem just to fuck with Jim
You know my diamonds dancin', jumpin' out the gym
And when we cookin', boy jumpin' out the gym
Out the gym, out the gym
Out the gym, make them motherfuckers swim
It's out the gym, it's out the gym
He 100, you know my partner out the gym, gym

[Verse 1: Quicktrip]
Young nigga brought you west side
Feel like I'm Santana
Rockin' red bandanas
I don't do it for the camera
Ridin' round with them hammers
Call 'em motherfuckin' toast
I was sleepin' on floors
Say what up to my roaches
Keep playin', I smoke
Young nigga stayin' focused
Yeah, I keep my hitters
Just me and my niggas
Don't took these bars lightly
Me and Cash stay shiney
Tourin' got me in the Bronx
I ain't fuckin' with you punks
Young hoes gettin' jumped
Young niggas gettin' trumped
I don't fuck with that nigga
I ain't votin' Donald Trump
Nigga talkin' 'bout me
Quicktrip so street
Hit his bitch 3D
Man want my heat

[Hook: Quicktrip]
I got a pack that said jumpin' out the gym
I took a flight to Harlem just to fuck with Jim
You know my diamonds dancin', jumpin' out the gym
And when we cookin', boy jumpin' out the gym
Out the gym, out the gym
Out the gym, make them motherfuckers swim
It's out the gym, it's out the gym
He 100, you know my partner out the gym, gym

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
This for 2017
Pullin' somethin' out the lot
Keep a bad bitch with me
Gettin' blunted in the drop
These 458s
We just jumpin' out the top
Them some big ass diamonds
This jumpin' off the watch
He in the middle of the ocean
Just jumpin' out the yacht
Kept them flights in the winter
So the summer don't stop
We was just in the kitchen
Grams jumpin' out the pot
Yeah, we had the spot clickin'
Fiends runnin' to the spot
Keep the gun by the crotch
Case you run into the ops
Boy hop, boy hop, boy
Street money off top
These niggas just frontin'
We made 100 off the block
These rappers just frontin'
Ain't put 100 in a watch

[Hook: Quicktrip]
I got a pack that said jumpin' out the gym
I took a flight to Harlem just to fuck with Jim
You know my diamonds dancin', jumpin' out the gym
And when we cookin', boy jumpin' out the gym
Out the gym, out the gym
Out the gym, make them motherfuckers swim
It's out the gym, it's out the gym
He 100, you know my partner out the gym, gym
