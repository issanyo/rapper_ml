[Intro:]
It's a party going on in Atlanta
Stevie J nigga what it is
It's some bad bitches here tonight
Look at the ice look like scroll lights

[Verse 1:]
Order up some bottles like its no tomorrow
Spending drug money like fuck the law
I'm on my Birdman and Diddy shit
Super clean on my pretty shit
Ten stacks on hundreds ball nigga rich
Living life off benefits, ask around hoe, I been this shit
To get this dick you need a membership
Patron shots with the heavy line
You want to hit the blunt better get in line
Flirting with yo pants got you super hard
(and you already know)
She a super hot, balling like I got to turn myself in
Popping bottles with some made niggas
When it come to bricks I could name ten
That I broke down at the J's it

[Chorus:]
Where my bad bitches on fleek
From the hair down to the feet
Imma a real nigga so i'm gone speak
What you zip it cause it's on me

[Verse 2:]
Just had an epiphany
My bitch be rocking diamonds out of Tiffany
The pool deck wet when slippery
We just cop cars from the Sticker B
One time for my bitches up in liv
Two times for my niggas running up in cribs
Three times for my lifers all doing bids
All my get money niggas you know what it is
Black bottle for the roll benz
Who about to get off in my car with
You ain't suck a dick girl that's nonsense
So don't meet me by my cottie
Where my Instagram bitches at
When you comment on that page, they donâ€™t hit you  back
Bust it open for a real nigga
Around 1:12 we eat a meal with

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
So now we leaving out the fountain blue
Got me feeling like a nigga smoke tha
