[Intro]
Pay attention
D Rock, D Rock

[Chorus]
Talk bout the live that I'm living, look at the price that was paid
I had to go grind to go get it, nothin' was given to me
I put my bitch in the four, then put some ice in my chain
You had the struggle like I did, you'd probably do it the same

[Verse 1]
Huh, I know you probably hate me on the low, ain't that's because a nigga gettin' doe
But I could give a fuck about your feelings, am tryna make some millions
And you can't do shit about it, but you watch me get it
Now girls you keep that shoes on running with
Sits at the table count these money with me
Itâ€™s about that bread you know I'm running with
And if is war you know I'm gunning with it
Huh, Jones
Let me talk mine (talk nigga)
If a nigga fuck no second thought it'd be chalk line
Gotta, for my second part, the 4 doors on the Porch now
(Slices) you spoke the row, you did 5, you got short time
Huh, they stash this 4 and 20 man drug dealing date
Take stashed up ammo and an old case on the selling date
(Yow say what it is) Would I need a boss and I hit the club I don't feel excitement
Huh, I just pour liquor out, pray to God let all my niggas out

[Chorus]
Talk bout the live that I'm living, look at the price that was paid
I had to go grind to go get it, nothin' was given to me
I put my bitch in the four, then put some ice in my chain
You had the struggle like I did, you'd probably do it the same


[Verse 2]
Huh, I was built for this, I know a lot of niggas that would kill for this
I keep a hot 4 5, then I chill my wrist, and shit on these niggas till they don't exist
I see you hatin' on the low doe, starring hard, might a sweat, take a 4 doe
Pull up in a coop, no photo, hang like a yo-yo, them body
These bitches, they boss them like codo
Had a game up quick, fuck the game up quick
Had them bored all year, am nigga like the first Brad Pitt
Talk bout the live that I'm living, if she was yearn like giving
Stacking these doe to the ceiling, and don't give a fuck about your feeling

[Chorus]
Talk bout the live that I'm living, look at the price that was paid
I had to go grind to go get it, nothin' was given to me
I put my bitch in the four, then put some ice in my chain
You had the struggle like I did, you'd probably do it the same

[Verse 3]
Huh, never had my hand out, for hand out
No, Oh head told me to grind and then do it
Time need a pan out, time couldn't fix broke, so fuck that
I with the pans out, end of flippin' old cookies then the girls scout
Real shit, you don't know my life, no, no
Help the stomach in no lights, how you hit this mike
You don't know this grind, no, no
So I got to shine, and put in work like it's overtime
Queen B

[Chorus]
Talk bout the live that I'm living, look at the price that was paid
I had to go grind to go get it, nothin' was given to me
I put my bitch in the four, then put some ice in my chain
You had the struggle like I did, you'd probably do it the same
