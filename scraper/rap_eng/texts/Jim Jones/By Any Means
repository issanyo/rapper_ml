[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
By any means necessary
Couple million buried in the cemetery
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, jealous niggas envy
Gotta me grippin' heavy 'case a nigga tempt me
They ain't really ready, they ain't really ready
I'm really deadly, pussy, quick to pop a nigga cherry
All my women sexy, all my women sexy
Always in designer, watch how you address me
Hopped off the porch at a young age
Hopped in the Porsche at a young age
She got stupid head, she give me dumb brains
I'm big news like the front page
Yeah, neck shinin' like the sun rays
Got your girl pussy poppin' like a gun range
Yeah, she take it off, she don't complain
Get it? She take it off, she don't cum playin'

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yeah, we gettin' rich by any means (By any means)
She want the dick by any means (By any means)
We let it rip by any means (By any means)
Death to my enemies by any means (Any means)
Yeah, we gettin' rich by any means (By any means)
She want the dick by any means (By any means)
We let it rip by any means (By any means)
Death to my enemies by any means (Any means)

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Capo
That full contact, we ain't playin' Madden (Get 'em)
Niggas frontin' 'til them bullets start sprayin' at 'em (Hit 'em)
Drippin' Gucci hoodie with the flamin' dragon (Drip, drip)
Them bitches used to hop up out my Range and bag 'em (Skrrt, skrrt)
Shit, them side bitches get you sidetracked (Listen to me)
Niggas catch you with that bitch and get your side wacked (Boom)
I told the pilot have some Wendy's when we fly back (Facts)
I'll have niggas in your chimney for like five stacks (Smoke that nigga)
They just givin' out that smoke you been askin' for (True)
I been bringin' back that coke when the crack was raw (Work)
We just gettin' rich by any means (Grr)
I keep twenty-thousand dollars in any jeans (By any means)

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yeah, we gettin' rich by any means (By any means)
She want the dick by any means (By any means)
We let it rip by any means (By any means)
Death to my enemies by any means (Any means)
Yeah, we gettin' rich by any means (By any means)
She want the dick by any means (By any means)
We let it rip by any means (By any means)
Death to my enemies by any means (Any means)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
If-if-if you get twenty years in the league
You still couldn't ball with us (Nope)
Seven-foot-four, boy still ain't tall enough (Sorry)
Jim and L gun case, lawyer on the call with us
Me and Zeek eatin' bullets, fuck wrong with all of us? (I don't know)
Come to the mall with us, the scene'll get slippery (Whoa)
Drippin' outta Barney's and I know Neiman's sick of me (Yup)
Beamer on lean, it's a dream just to get wit' me (Hello)
Ivy on the neck, earring bling, Tiffany (Bling)
Four cars, three clubs, twenty bottles done right (What else?)
Two keys, three girls, Four Seas in one night
Put it in her mouth, I could tell you what her tongue like
Put it down her throat, I can't lie, I was tum height

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yeah, we gettin' rich by any means (By any means)
She want the dick by any means (By any means)
We let it rip by any means (By any means)
Death to my enemies by any means (Any means)
Yeah, we gettin' rich by any means (By any means)
She want the dick by any means (By any means)
We let it rip by any means (By any means)
Death to my enemies by any means (Any means)
