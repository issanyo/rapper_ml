Featuring Jim Jones

[Intro]
You can't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna (uh) with me
Got dem boys in the back with me
Chicks is wishin' they could stunt like me

[Verse 1:]
So I was up to the club around 12'oclock
I pull up into the spot in the pecan drop
I'm just a pretty little thing with the _ on lock
When I step up inside the building, make the whole room stop (oh)
I just wanna have a good time tonight
Can't knock my swagga, mine is badder (watch me ride, yeah)

[Hook]
You can't deny, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna (uh) with me
Got dem boys in the back with me
Chicks is wishin' they could stunt like me

You can't deny, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna (uh) with me
Got dem boys in the back with me
Chicks is wishin' they could stunt like me

[Verse 2:]
Now I done been through some things a lot of y'all can't do

I been up out of the light about a year or two
Some of 'em questioning my function - can she do it again?
And so I came through with a smile and a few new friends
I just wanna have a good time tonight
Can't knock my swagga, mine is badder, watch me ride ( yeah )

[Hook]
You can't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna (uh) with me
Got dem boys in the back with me
Chicks is wishin' they could stunt like me

You can't deny, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna (uh) with me
Got dem boys in the back with me
Chicks is wishin' they could stunt like me

You can't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

Got dem boys in the back with me
Chicks is wishin' they could stunt like me

You can't deny, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna (uh) with me
Got dem boys in the back with me
Chicks is wishin' they could stunt like me
