DJ SpinKing baby, oh!

[Hook: Don Q]
Back in the kitchen I'm whipping that shit that they asked for
I hop in the foreign I'm whipping that shit like a crash course
200 the dashboard, I'm ducking the task force
I run through my passports, I'm punching the last 4
Back in the kitchen I'm whipping that shit that they asked for
I hop in the foreign I'm whipping that shit like a crash course
200 the dashboard, I'm ducking the task force
I run through my passports, I'm punching the last 4

[Verse 1: Don Q]
Spend some bands down in SoHo
I dropped a dime on a coat though
Just to go style on my old ho
And I show my faces where they don't go
Them niggas gon' panic I'm whipping the Phantom
That shit 'bout as big as a boat though
She calling me handsome
I think it's the way that the piece dancing and the rope glow
We got the city put the house on it
Louis belt with the pouch on it
The bully I might just but they don't know
They wanna know the amount tho
I told her lay on her stomach and I'll throw them racks on your back just to count on it
I bought my momma a bag and it come out of Louis so I spent a pound on it
I got a cup full of red and I'm stuck off the meds
And I'm driving I'm highed up
I can not fuck with no feds yea they come for my head
And I'm ducking the line up
You never know where you'll wind up
I pray they ain't snatching my guys up
I'm drinking codeine out of wine cups
Pour a nine up till my eyes shut

[Hook: Don Q]
Back in the kitchen I'm whipping that shit that they asked for
I hop in the foreign I'm whipping that shit like a crash course
200 the dashboard, I'm ducking the task force
I run through my passports, I'm punching the last 4
Back in the kitchen I'm whipping that shit that they asked for
I hop in the foreign I'm whipping that shit like a crash course
200 the dashboard, I'm ducking the task force
I run through my passports, I'm punching the last 4

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Foreign cars when we uptown
Private jets when we touch down
Bentley's out bring the truck around
Got the bag don't fuck around
Flood it up or I bust it down
What the fuck is up when I touch the town
Pack toast like it's Bucktown
They shooting there better duck down
Fucker, it's Jim Jones
Got ten phones
I spent half the day (and what?)
I got ten gone
House on the water, nigga might swim home
Hopping out the Wraith, with my Timbs on

[Hook: Don Q]
Back in the kitchen I'm whipping that shit that they asked for
