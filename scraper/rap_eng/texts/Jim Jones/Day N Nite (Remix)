Jones
We born to die so i get high just like im born to fly{to the moon}
Im in the court with marijuana eyes{sorry judge}
We hit the clubs until the morning rise
{'cause of last nite}
'cause day n nite
We run the streetshope i don't pay that price
{pray for me}
They got the nerve to tell me press my brakes
And if i do then how will rent get paid,paid
So now im thinking that
2OO stacks whatwould it bring me back {thinking to flip}
Especially now that recessions here
{it's hard out here}
My only answers to my questions is is
Ok now here's a thought(1 more thought)
Streets is a marriage that you can't divorce
Life is abitch but i think i fell in love
Im still on drugs

[Chorus]
Cuz day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
