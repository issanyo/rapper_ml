[Chorus: Sen City]
Sunny days, bitch, I'm in the trap real low
They wanna know, you sell Cocaine
All the hoes be callin my name, everybody wants fame
Now tell me, nigga, will you sell Cocaine

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
I fixed my viser, blockin out the sun
I double park, until the block is done
Sittin low, you here them hoes yappin
If you listen closer, you here them foes clappin
Pop shit, like Zip did
Cop bricks, like Rich did
Sold Coke, and got fly with it
Won 60 at the dice, and bought a ride with it
Reffrance raw, we was sellin raw
Tree bought the game, and I was left up north
I listened close to what the streets was teachin
They made more doe than what my teacher teachin
The only traide was to traide the snow
Talkin to the dealer, traidin off my porch
This game is insane, a crazy sport
You be thinkin of mistakes, on the way to court

[Chorus: Sen City]
Sunny days, bitch, I'm in the trap real low
They wanna know, you sell Cocaine
All the hoes be callin my name, everybody wants fame
Now tell me, nigga, will you sell Cocaine

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Sunup, loyalty to sunup
When it come to Killa, boy, and Santana
I could tell you about the joy and the blunders
Surv up white mix, and callin it Piranha
They make cowboys out of Cocaine, hundred thou toys, out the dope game
Bout 5 ticks rite by the
Propain
Make it disarmed, than harder, nigga, know James
Getting block money, put you in a different place
Told a chick I love her, tell her get lost, you should've seen her face
Should've saw mine, you thinkin bout love, crazy lady, and I'm thinkin bout Carbine
No Shamone line, shit, if not, grab my gun
Fingers so sticky, feel like I could wall climb
Hold me up with fish scale didgets, I met the guy, rite out doing trailer visits

[Chorus: Sen City]
Sunny days, bitch, I'm in the trap real low
They wanna know, you sell Cocaine
All the hoes be callin my name, everybody wants fame
Now tell me, nigga, will you sell Cocaine
