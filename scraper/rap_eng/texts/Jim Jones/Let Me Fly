Whatever you wanna do, girl, we gotta do it tonight
You don't wanna let me go, I can see it in your eyes
But you know I gotta fly 'cause baby, this is my life
Baby, this is my life, yeah

She's spillin' drinks all night on my favorite pants
She was all up on a nigga, givin' crazy stares
The loud knock in my door had me wake up scared
As I looked into my bed, she had her makeup smeared

Damn, it's like a party what we made in here
And I was tryin' tell the time through the Jacob glare
Can't front the fat ass and the wavy hair
Had a nigga contemplate about stayin' here

I missed the flight, I got to pay delay
She tried to do it all again, she ain't playin' fair
She reached up like, "Do you gotta leave?"
I wanna stay but baby girl, I gotta breathe

Jet lag screamin' that we runnin' late
My Louis bags on wheels runnin' to the gate
Party all night to the a.m
And it kinda pushed my time back like daylight savings

7 a.m., turning over in the sheets
Manager blowin' up the phone in my sleep
A smile on my face, I don't mean to make 'em wait
But she's that much sexier when she sleeps

Throwin' on my clothes, put my shoes on my feet
Bags packed up and now I'm ready for the streets
Glanced back at her, now she's staring up at me
She wanna pull me back but she know I gotta leave

Flight's at ten then we land at twelve
Then we then check-in to another hotel
Oh well, do it all again
I think I want her an' my homie wants her friend

Ball like tomorrow might be the end
We can let it all go, we can play pretend
We can do it up from the dusk til' the dawn
Like the Marvin Gaye song 'Baby, Let's Get It On'
