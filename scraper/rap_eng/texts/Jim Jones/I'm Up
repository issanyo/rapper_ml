When it gets messed around with I'm the one, one
Uh huh. Uh

When it gets messed around with I'm the one, I'm the one

And I'll be happy to give all up

Up on the dancefloor (like I'm catchin a seizure)
Damn, it should phase me (I'ma bout to re-up)

All the things you do, all your lil moves (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Every chick in here wanna get a piece of you
All the things you do, all your lil moves (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)

New koofs got the partial greys (stuntin)
And movin through just like a horse race (see this)
She want a bottle so I brought the keg (it's nothin)
I stared at her and took a double take (BALLIN!)

No offense b, girl I need a boss (you ready?)

Bossy as I wanna be

Believe that I can ride
Keep you by my side
Bossy as I wanna be
Shit don't even try

All the things you do, all your lil moves (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Every chick in here wanna get a piece of you
All the things you do, all your lil moves (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Every chick in here wanna get a piece of you
When I gets messed around with I'm the one, one
