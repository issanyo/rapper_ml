[Intro]
Uh kitchen
See the kitchen ain’t about what I’m doing presently
It’s about what we ain’t doing presently
So I’m just trying to remind Young Goddess the hustle
Y’all welcome

[Hook]
I’m just married to the street chasing dollar and a dream
Can’t nothing hit the bossman
Same shit different story
Either get rich or get a coffin
I’m just chasing my dream I did it for my team
I did made some profits
Can’t take nothing from me
Either get rich or get a coffin

[Verse 1]
You see we grew up kind of optionless
Stomach touching and we only had a pot to piss
Came up fast cause I hardly see my pops and shit
Started with a thirst in the first to cop the hottest kicks
Ten grams with my man we was choppin it
Cook it soft let it harden on some rocker shit
Like a nine to five it’s a job you hit the block in shifts
And move smart you watch the cops so they stop and frisk
Shit now they see the trapper when you stop the whip
Way before the champagne and helicopter list
It was one million two million three million four
Poppin the blue prim while we was dealing out the store
Now I’m conversating with the dealer on the floor
Like I rape a suicide you could kill him with the jaws
Drinking the drug I’m trying to catch me a vibe
The way I be feeling they never catch me alive
Houses on the water with the jet-skis outside
Member they was in the building but they left me outside
Cook coke with ammonia yeah disinfect it broke a few pots
Until I finally got this shit perfected
And [?] where my wrist reflected feel a cold chill but this chill Cause that’s just my necklace
Shit I’m just fronting the way out of line
I bought a new watch just in case I’m way out of time

[Hook]
I’m just married to the street chasing dollar and a dream
Can’t nothing hit the bossman
Same shit different story
Either get rich or get a coffin
I’m just chasing my dream I did it for my team
I did made some profits
Can’t take nothing from me
Either get rich or get a coffin

[Verse 2]
We was n*ggas with hammers without a shit to give
And thats a good explanation for all the shit we did
Kitchen vision clear Scottie Pippens all my bitch can get
This chicken head keep grinding and f*ck around get a breakfast Yeah
And then out the back block trying to rap hittin crack spots
Might setup to get caught they won’t give him no last shot
If you ain’t trying to hustle my n*gga we gotta master plan
Cause being broke is shit that make you feel like half a man
Oh no if it’s the henny and capsules I’m off a half [?]
It’s trippin off the set kind of dangerous I got to stack some bands
I know if Dirk was here he have a plan how t to do it different
It’s learn to make the same mistakes it got me moving different
I’m fully loaded these hammers ain’t trying to lose my n*ggas
Put the game back together a couple screws was missing
If  I don’t make it f*ck it I’m a die here cause I bang cause I thug cause I ride here

[Hook]
I’m just married to the street chasing dollar and a dream
Can’t nothing hit the bossman
Same shit different story
Either get rich or get a coffin
I’m just chasing my dream I did it for my team
I did made some profits
Can’t take nothing from me
Either get rich or get a coffin

[Verse 3]
Sever we start stupid system in the back
That was 03 we made a quarter mil of crack
Beepers on site we kept it glizzy in the back
Ten ninety young bishop with the strap
Die Hard no Bruce Willis I’m in the store reenacting the old quilis
Crack baby era number spots in the dope blocks
Boy george stamp on any dog I got the strip hot
Take me through my hood it’s like I rap warfield
F*ck a health care these bitches concerned with welfare
Government assistance wasn’t doin too much
Really paid a lobby sick shot til the sun came up
In my era no IG now I do see dreaming trying to stack for the M3
I used to be really post up on the strip made him get used to me
Red showed me how to cook up n it was history

[Hook]
I’m just married to the street chasing dollar and a dream
Can’t nothing hit the bossman
Same shit different story
Either get rich or get a coffin
I’m just chasing my dream I did it for my team
I did made some profits
Can’t take nothing from me
Either get rich or get a coffin

[Outro]
Step 3
We need a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care Of a higher power as we understood him
