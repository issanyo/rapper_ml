[Intro: Jim Jones]
East side to all my real rights
West coast, what's up?
Tell my billies what's up?
Bompton, what's poppin'?
Back to back, side to side
Neighborhood chopper
Billy got 'em, billy shot 'em
Huh, huh

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
They was bangin' on the west, I was bangin' on the east
They was bangin' in the jails, I was bangin' in the streets
Shit, almost went to jail, I was bangin' in the streets
Camp signed a deal, start bangin' on the beats like
Shit, I made this bangin' kinda famous though
I made that bangin' kinda famous though
Never slippin', kept the bangers in the Ranges ho
I love the gang, I even banged when I was famous ho

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Put the bity on my back, had my bity screamin' blat
All the main events with forty niggas in the back
I was bickin' back boolin', skippin' all the schooling
Small twenty-two in the Timbs'll get to tooling
My hat and my MAC and they call me Billy the Kid
Sex, money, murder, we been killin' these kids
Shit, I send a missile, I get you killed in your bed
We use the blood as the power, it's what we built in the sapce
I used to rock a vest 'cause in my streets, no love
I was the first to hit the west and show 'em east coast bloods
Everybody screamin' gang but nobody put in work for it
Shit, my whole gang was puttin' bodies in the church for it

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
They was bangin' on the west, I was bangin' on the east
They was bangin' in the jails, I was bangin' in the streets
Shit, almost went to jail, I was bangin' in the streets
Camp signed a deal, start bangin' on the beats like
Shit, I made this bangin' kinda famous though
I made that bangin' kinda famous though
Never slippin', kept the bangers in the Ranges ho
I love the gang, I even banged when I was famous ho

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
Granny stayed up on the Ave, we was bangin' on the Ave
Back when Black Sam copped a murder case up on the Ave
Ayy it be mainy where I'm at, you need a stainless where I'm at
Make a statement, you're a rat, and you'll never come back from that, facts
We throwin' packs to them niggas that's catchin' bodies
The shooter get a chain and the driver get a new wallet
Yeah, pull up and I call him like anything for the Mozzy
Body anybody that's bangin' outside the posse
Nick and them were down for the haul when I said I got him
Green dot for him like water to keep him charlie ahky
It's four fingers, I'm bangin' until they pop me
Back to back gang world, leavin' the city sloppy

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
They was bangin' on the west, I was bangin' on the east
They was bangin' in the jails, I was bangin' in the streets
Shit, almost went to jail, I was bangin' in the streets
Camp signed a deal, start bangin' on the beats like
Shit, I made this bangin' kinda famous though
I made that bangin' kinda famous though
Never slippin', kept the bangers in the Ranges ho
I love the gang, I even banged when I was famous ho
