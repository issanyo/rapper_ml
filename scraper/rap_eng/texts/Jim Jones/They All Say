[Verse 1]
For all ma niggas that's locked up
Yo real that up (dreams stay killing us, dreams stay killing us)
Cause a fuck nigga faded tho
They got that wassup
Still some real ones left
Ay dealer see who’s that at the door
Nigga rich ball on these niggas till you come home
More champagne

[Hook]
Ma side bitch told me she love me cool that’s what they all say
Revenge is like the sweetest drug next to getting pussy and foreplay
You know I live by the mob way
Life is a first class trip do you know it’s a one way
I never snitched I never told
I promised to be a G and never fold
I swear that I know that’s what they all say
That’s what they all say

[Verse 2]
I’m limping limping coco limping
Big money shit helicopter to the heavens
Flights to miami drop toppers when we landing
Top shatt hope you get the proper understanding (blood claat)
Do the knowledge do the two dollars do the three cents
Ma team will demolish your whole team your whole crew and your bench
Every movie leave you in suspense
The jewels is intense the bling is offensive
Everything is expensive
If a nigga front you see the gun you bringing him to intensive
Shit i’m riding dirty but the car is immaculate
Beam joint so when I clap it’d be accurate
Shit I always kept it a thousand I butts before I [?]
Started with a dollar now a nigga batting with thousands
I’m on top of my mojo fly kicks like i’m on top of the dojo
Got bricks yeah black with the logo
We got priors like rich that nigga JoJo
Dance on em like he was clapping a po po
(you heard that you heard that )
We got priors like rich that nigga JoJo
Dance on em like he was clapping a po po

[Hook]
Ma side bitch told me she love me cool that’s what they all say
Revenge is like the sweetest drug next to getting pussy and foreplay
You know I live by the mob way
Life is a first class trip do you know it’s a one way
I never snitched I never told
I promised to be a G and never fold
I swear that I know that’s what they all say
That’s what they all say

[Verse 3]
They told me that there’s more that meets the eye
They copping all these foreigns beat the drive
We would order pizza pie I ain’t talking bout domino’s
We was in the kitchen and my mama knows
On them night shifts like them camadors
You want it everything good they crack up your [?]
Hoping that the D.A coming back with a offer
Forty with extension just to back a nigga off us
And on them bad days it’s still back to back Porches
(still getting money tho)
It be all good till it goes bad
When niggas die in the hood it be so sad
Ma young boy hop out with the forty four mag
Had a G pack on him still have forty four bags
And then they taught me that my future’s twisted
I’m just feeling like the rules is twisted
If I say too much then i’m snitching if i’m too specific
Let’s just leave it that you dudes is bitches

[Hook]
Ma side bitch told me she love me cool that’s what they all say
Revenge is like the sweetest drug next to getting pussy and foreplay
You know I live by the mob way
Life is a first class trip do you know it’s a one way
I never snitched I never told
I promised to be a G and never fold
I swear that I know that’s what they all say
That’s what they all say
