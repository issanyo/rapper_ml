[Verse 1]
With the coke price at a all time high
How the fuck we supposed to eat
Got grown man praying to God hoping for rake in prices
Game is twisted got these young niggas running in banks without A gun
Talking bout they pulling scams niggas acting like they scared to Sell Yayo
Where the hustlers at

[Hook]
My soldiers keep on lock
Can’t ride without the piece no more
Almost fifty a gram God damn
How we gonna eat oh lord (oh lord )
I ain’t with it (I ain’t with it )
Yellow tape cause i did it (i did it)
Got the streets talking shit bout another bitch
But I ain’t even hit it so

[Verse 2]
Uncle Ricky need bail money
That was a [?]
He had a substance problem started off selling bricks
I thought that was very clear (true story)
Thirty years out of his life [?] never snitched
Shit that is very rare
And my little buzzer Renny he beat the death penalty
That was heaven to ma ears I would do it all over again
I wouldn’t change nothing at all
And all the coke that I sold I would move it all again
I’m getting ahead of maself chill
Let me reel it back in
I was dealing crack when
There was no cell phones and I swear it was iller back then
It was beepers on streets [?] first Mac ten
Uncle Ronnie had the old black benz
And they say that i'd be iller now
I used to let the Mac go off just to watch the shells spill
And now mother fucker let me spell it out

Mo fuckaz play too much but I bet that on some chill [?]
Fuck you and your friends I slay two slugs in em
And I got a the bomb dicl that will make you [?]

[Hook]
My soldiers keep on lock
Can’t ride without the piece no more

Got the streets talking shit bout another bitch
But I ain’t even hit it so
It’s me nigga

[Verse 3]
Mama raised a boy the streets made me man
Why the fuck you think ma heart froze
Late nights on the corner
Twelve to a skinny big thirty eight [?] (ninety eight)
Young boy shooting on the block
Shit they say I caught a body like wondo
Sparked at crossroads four billion up
North road heading on state road
Some niggas ain’t get a date
Real life betting on murphy and [?]
Came up broke we as hungry as stomach
Turn a work to a pack I was pitching and dodging
To fuck these bitches they the least
Gossip with they friends in the next nigga V
Niece on max with the nine in the seat
Before [?] took the stand he used to be the plug sheets
Now it’s fifty

[Hook]
My soldiers keep on lock
Can’t ride without the piece no more
Almost fifty a gram God damn
How we gonna eat oh lord (oh lord )
I ain’t with it (I ain’t with it )
Yellow tape cause I did it (I did it)
Got the streets talking shit bout another bitch
But I ain’t even hit it so
It’s me nigga

[Verse 4]
Go, ain’t got clocks in the roley unless the time tick
I’m on the [?] beretta is ma little sidekick
Bitch got a hold in your life told her hold on she my bitch
Then went and put that daytona shit on my side bitch
Cruising fly whips tryna [?] with the drop in it do the limit
But further move with the mop in it
Once I seen them cooking for me I looked at the pot different
On the rise to the top you gotta drop niggas
Been a hot nigga don’t worry I put in work
A nigga make a move and the shotty will put in work
And all you gonna hear is that shawty was in his [?]
I done took so much trip that I probably go bizarre
We fell in love with the coco with a lil coke flow
Everyday we hustling the same shit
Knew the neighbor wanted coke so I had to get my own flow
Niggas gonna hustle in the main strip

[Hook]
My soldiers keep on lock
Can’t ride without the piece no more
Almost fifty a gram God damn
How we gonna eat oh lord (oh lord )
I ain’t with it (I ain’t with it )
Yellow tape cause I did it (I did it)
Got the streets talking shit bout another bitch
But I ain’t even hit it so
