God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own

Papa left me at war
In the Croix-des-Bouquets slums
Out in Haiti
I used to hunt for my food like wolves hunt sheeps
From the whole to the project
Learned to slap box cause I couldn’t take the disrespect
Asked Mona Lisa for a date on Friday
She heard I was Haitian and she said no way
But God blessed the child
I could have been that juvenile
Yep, but that’s my cousin selling crack
And that’s me with the black and white notebook writing raps
And the words became real
And I got a record deal
And I went from last to first
I put Haiti on the map, if you're looking for my country Google Earth

God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own

God bless because the streets is hard
We living in a world we only see facades
But check the stats, you won't believe the odds
From who make it out to who see the bars
Only a few make out the two seated cars
I hope my crew make it out and don't see the bars
When Wyclef was on tour with the Fugees
I was with Boyz n the Hood, you can't pause the movie
Thought I was hot shit when I bought the coopy
I was down in the tunnel when I wore the goofy
I was the ice berg shit, 400 sweater
I put ten up in the bank, bet I form better
It was love in the bitch way before I met her
Just was spending all my chips on the softest leathers
I told my niggas meet them at the crossroads
Until then I'mma see how fast this Porsche go
More money well them more foes
But shit I ain’t scared of you mofos
You funny niggas like Bernie mac
I do something til you same niggas turn a rat

God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own

It’s much deeper than a rap song
Think it’s sweet until this beef is getting clapped on
I’ve seen sweet dreams turn in nightmares
I watch street dreams turn to life years
You can hear the loud screams when they cry tears
Now I take my whole team and we fly Leers
If it’s New York then we’re up town
California sport when we touchdown
I’m getting money, wouldn't call it fame
It was right before she nutted when she called my name
Backing out the telly, wheels in reverse
She had the telly slippers on, heels in her purse
I put her in a cab, you dealing with a jerk
It's atleast a quarter mil when a nigga murk
Shit they follow me like i’m racketeering
They must have got fed with the black McLaren
And yea they racial profile my black appearance
And I always ran the streets, I had absent parents
And every night we pray to the sky
In the hood where is 9 million ways to die

God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the child that can hold his own
