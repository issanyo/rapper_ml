[Intro: Max B]
Now I done told y'all niggas in two-thou-four, we ain't the niggas to fuck with
And I done told y'all niggas if you fucking with the Dips, then you pressing your luck, B
I'm a pop the trunk and then cock the pump and do lots of dumping and
We don't ever leave them chromes at home
Y'all niggas better leave them boys alone

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
There's parts of uptown that we call Purple City
Holler at Shiest from the circle to the piffy (hey Bubz)
Wrist look good, worth about fifty (blingy)
Whip look good, worth a buck-sixty (flossing)
Shit goes fast, about a buck-sixty (speeding)
Life goes fast, if you blink, you might miss me (you got one chance)
And fuck a glass, if I drink, it ain't tipsy (nope)
It's more like pissy, standing on a couch trying order more Crissy
You order more drippy (right)
Hammer bulging out, hope the Lord don't frisk me (squalie)
I still get it in, guns on the waist (click-clack)
Blew about ten grand when I come in the place (balling)
Now it's all in them ones (yup)
All just for fun (flying)
See, the bitches be players, so we roar like the Suns (balling)
I'm addicted to the lifestyle
Blowing weed, piffing G, riding on the night route

[Hook: Max B (2x)]
G-A-N-G-S-T-A (gangsta)
The first we spit, the rest we spray (gangsta)
Y'all ain't built for this thing we after (gangsta)
We bang and clap ya, sting ya, whack ya (gangsta)

[Verse 2: Shiest Bubz]
Yeah, it's Shiest Bubz the Emperor
Go uptown to Broadway, tell them that I sent ya
Bullet from the 40 will flip ya
Nigga we sporty, look at shorty, she'll all the way from pictures
I showed ya, told ya niggas that I'm a clap ya
I'll fold ya, told ya niggas I'm not a rapper
Heavy on the wrist-wear, I know what ya heard, man
Shit on my arm, run ya 'bout thirty grand
It take a lot to get me high
Half a P of 33, a whole P of 65
I put a price tag, eleven on your dome
Move weight like I ain't never going home
I'm a Purple City boss and ya dig
Fucking with this money I'm a send y'all to Big (Rest In Peace)
And understand I'm the world of this piffing
Coming through the city with the spoilers and the system

[Hook: Max B (2x)]
G-A-N-G-S-T-A (gangsta)
The first we spit, the rest we spray (gangsta)
Y'all ain't built for this thing we after (gangsta)
We bang and clap ya, sting ya, whack ya (gangsta)

[Verse 3: Max B]
On One-O-Six and pop up
Hopping out the chopper, fresh outta lockup
I'm 'bout to be up
Start handcuffing your hoes
I'm the type to leave your baby mamma knocked up
I keep the baby llama cocked up
Max'll out ya, shoot shit up out ya
Young boss, I could either recruit you or scalp ya
Snake me and I'll make a pair of boots up out ya
He what the game need, he so hungry
Got it down packed and he don't even need to be punchy
He's cozy, he don't need to be comfy
Wrap crow-bars around your heads like scrungies
They got an APB on your boy
And I got the grade D-E in the choy
In the stash box, low in the holster
Hit the switch, gonna hop out like Brenda in the toaster, you's a snitch

[Hook: Max B (2x)]
G-A-N-G-S-T-A (gangsta)
The first we spit, the rest we spray (gangsta)
Y'all ain't built for this thing we after (gangsta)
We bang and clap ya, sting ya, whack ya (gangsta)
