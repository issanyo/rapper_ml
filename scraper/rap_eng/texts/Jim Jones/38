[Chorus:]
I make them n*ggas 38 [x4]
I make them bitches 38 [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Hatin this life
Entering heaven’s gate number 4
Know that the paper’s straight
Keep em hundreds of reasons
To fucking hate like some
Past due rent can’t stand the place
I made them bitches 38
Him talking saying the ass is fake
What’s real
Ya n*gga keep his face in it
Spend a day in it
Send him home with his face tripping
Got the n*ggas all tight dope
Think you can take my spot
Take a hike hoe
Been known to win a hike hoe
Be a winner check the score
Ain’t no mother fucking spike hoe
Me and success we got a date
Gettin cashed in y’all back to minimum wage
Top down now I am fighting at a pace
It’s not hate they want to be me
Me and my bitch we belly day
Too much money on the way
I put that pussy in my face
She tripping with it, beggin me to stay
I got them n*ggas 38
But they didn’t get to third base
I got the keys to her pin to the credit card
We’ve been fucking all day
She got a chick so I could deal with her
She got a n*gga but I still hit her
No relationship but I can deal with her
Shorty got those red bottoms on slim waist
But that ass fat
Girl, how you get them jeans on
Let a n*gga get some face time
You ain’t fuckin with them other n*ggas you ain’t wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I like wasabi
I’m digging her body
I’m swerving that pussy
I go Ricky Bobby
Fucking the world
No one can stop me
My heart’s been cold
It was born playing hockey
Been a monster
The fuck you mean n*gga
Even at a red light I’m seeing green n*gga
Hate all you want but watch your tongue
I ain’t hard as a rock but my watch got stones
I make them n*ggas 38
If heaven is golden, I’m jumpin that gate
In the fast lane I’m not stepping on the brakes
Like the floor elevating I’m just holding my weight
Been a man, still a man
Money keeps spinning like the ceiling fan
This vamp life living we been a clan
Take over the world boy that been the plan

[Chorus]
