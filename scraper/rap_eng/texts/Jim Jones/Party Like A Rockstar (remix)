[Intro]
Yeah (Remix baby) [x4]
T-t-t-totally dude

[Fat]
Hey, this the remix
And I'm the prefix
You know (uh-huh)
This rock-n-roll street shit
Hand me the mic
Sheed got the bass
Meany got the guitar
(guitar riff)
Now I got mo' dough
I ain't heard no mo'
With all the loop we get (uh-huh)
We could pull a no-show
Got diamond wallet chain
Diamond watch, neck, and ring
I need a monument with diamonds in my name

[Hook]
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar (remix baby) [x4]
T-t-t-totally Dude

[Lil Wayne]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
It's young Weezy F. Baby, no abortion
I have foursomes
And I don't have to force 'em
They just do what I say, jack
Like Wheel of Fortune
I'm heartless and iced out, see
I got an icebox where my heart used to be
Young Money baby, you know who we are
And I can play with that pussy, like I play that guitar

[Hook]

[Meany]
I am a Shop Boy
Something like a rockstar
I make 'em party hard
Now they using guitars
The bass rock drum
Make the crowd act a fool
I got them gangstas, hood stars, pop stars screamin'
(Totally dude)
Make clubs rock-rock
They know that I rock
I ride in fast cars
And plus my chick's hot
Diamonds in my store
They know that I'm the hardest
Black shades around my face, lookin' rockstar-ish

[Hook]

[Jim Jones]
Now who started this?
Your boy Jim Jones on that rockstar shit (say what?)
And who car is this?
300 grand for that drop top, bitch (ballin')
A young Tommy Lee (who's that?)
Big house on Connie V's (okay)
Get two broads, a dime a piece
Them white girls sniff a line apiece
Do it like Ozzy
Blue Mazi
On Patron like I was on kamikazes (go crazy)
Keep a whip and a biscuit
Rockstar eatin' kizzle and biscuit (and what)
Keep the waves swim
New pair of kicks
So you can "Walk This Way" like Aerosmith
And you can Run DMC in a flair eclipse

[Hook]

[Sheed]
Yeah we the Shop Boyz
Nobody could've did it better
We on fire
The black Red Hot Chili Peppers
My rock swag
You can tell and see from a distance
Keep a chick with a Mohawk
They're way thicker than Delicious
She stay head-hearted
When I speak, she don't talk
It ain't the braids that got the A rockin' Mohawks (come on)
Chamillinaire, Wayne, Jim, yeah we rock hard
This is the remix so party like a rockstar

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
First they rockin' and then they lean
So we plottin' to get my bling
But you know that metal rocket always pocketed in my jeans
Heavy metal
Jewelry yellow
I'm obscene
Plus I'm ghetto
Have your queen in stilettos
Pulling strings like Geppetto
All I know is Fetty
Tell me what you mean
Call me the Grinch, Shrek (yes)
All I like is green
I am Bruce Bling-steen
Step in the club then I grab her
If I want her I can have her
Mick Jagger with my swagger

[Bridge]
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Need another couple names
Shop Boyz, Lil Wayne (Jones) and Cha-military man (yeah)
Come do the show if I get the call
Tear up the club just to piss you off
Get on the bus and go hit the mall
And buy an earring the size of a crystal ball

[Hook]
