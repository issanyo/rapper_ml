You ain't gotta love it they gotta fuckin respect it..(You betta do that)
If I were you, I would get up on some neck shit

Wanna buy you pretty things like bags from Chanel..
Texting on the phone I got you laughin on your cell.. (You like that?)
SMH, LOL, with a smiley face (Nasty) talking dirty got me hotter than a fireplace.. (Go)
Whats the deal, is you tryna get baked, take you out the fridge and put your ass on broil.. (Go)
Treat you like milk I'll let your ass get spoiled.. (And?)
Said you wanna ride, I bought you brand new toys..(Take that take that)
So tell cupid that I seen my target, pretty face, and a body like a Greek goddess..(She's a dime)
