[Verse 2]
Fuck y'all watching me for? All I do is get the bread
I'm the bomb like C4, hope y'all heard what the bitches said
Up and down like a see-saw, then hopped off and kissed the head
Damn,he came so many times you'd thought that bitch had pissed the bed
Big ass coupe, erase the top
Brand new Rollie, face with rocks
She was gone off straight Ciroc
Then next think you know she defaced a cop
Face the cock, give face to cock
Picture this, no, picture that
Trust the game, bitch I'm hip to that
With that big body frame, put dick to that
She start talking back
You know what happens when you talking back
Fuck around, be walking back
Treat you like the dog, caught the cat
She had the fatty
Spanked that ass and she called me daddy
Made her scream, you should hear her climax
Made a movie, but I ain't IMAX

[Hook]
I'm hella straight, and I just got paid
I'mma hit the club, and I'mma get laid
Getting laid, ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-getting laid
I'mma hit the club and I'mma get laid

[Verse 2]
Go, every day is friday, cashing checks and getting paid
If she walk by my way, that ass as fat as Gimli
Plus I think I need a tutor, class in session, get your grade
And I start busting at the bitch, when it hit her face it ricochet
Park the whip, hit the shade
Hopped on the dick when the system played
New coupe, inside the whip is suede
It's hot outside, but my wrists is glazed
Then I told her blow the gun
68, I owe you one
Just like a stick-up, showed my gun
And put your hands up high and show me some

[Hook]
