Now I am fresh out of bail harder flyer than a muthafuck
I don't do the baby, sumthin' like a rubber nut
Sumthin' like a hustler, got it runnin' through my blood
You ain't bout dat money, well, honey I don't give a fuck
Trynna ball wit a hoodie on cost about a stack
Got my booty shorts on but you can't see da stash
My shawty in da hood said he like it like dat
He put it on me good and I throw it right back
I'm a playa, I'ma pimp
I'll stick ya up for ya cheddar and all ya chips
Gimme da keys, I want da juice
Da credit cards, Da dogs and house too
Dey see I'm doin' me, dey see I'm gettin' paid
I still be in da hood, representin' for da days
Mercedes wanna hate, try to stomp em
I'ma fake, o it's all in da game but I'm still gettin' cake
If you a G, lemme see
You ain't gotta pay for da dinner, it's on me
Let's get it poppin shawty, let's get it poppin shawty
I get it poppin shawty, let's get it poppin shawty
We got da cash, buy out da bars
Drop da tops out da celing, you see da stars
We get it poppin shawty, I get it poppin shawty
We get it poppin shawty, we get it poppin shawty
Now what bitch don't want me, young rich G
Gun beneath da seat, pushin' a hundred on da V
Hand on da rocks two seater what you call dat
Lambergini drop, two divas how ya solve dat
Easy just loosen up da bra strap, make 'em feel sexy
Push dat seat to da coupe back
And den you let da breeze do da four play
And den you let da V do da horseplay
Turn da city streets to a horse race burn rubber
And word motha I got no cover Hoes love us
And I only fear da Lord above us
So if you want me come and get me make it good muhfucka
Tell da hatas cuff at dat
I play wit paper by da ten stack
I love ladies wit a shoe fetish
I tell her baby I got a coupe fetish, you wanna ride wit a G
If you a G, lemme see
You ain't gotta pay for da dinner, it's on me
Let's get it poppin shawty, let's get it poppin shawty
I get it poppin shawty, let's get it poppin shawty
We got da cash, buy out da bars
Drop da tops out da celing, you see da stars

We get it poppin shawty, we get it poppin shawty
Now 'bout to get it poppin if you ready for us
Startin' wit dem shoppin' sprees, I'm givin' honts so dey know it
Who said love don't cost a thing I'm from da city
Were da chicks are thick
Blingin' on dey neck and wrist and niggas poppin bottles
While da ladies rock dey hips
You get to know me and I'll teach you somethin'
To go from lil' money flossin' to doin' super stuntin'
I'm always griindin' so I'm gettin' money stick wit me and you'll go far
Dem otha chicks dey come a dime a dozen
You say dat you a G, well nigga let me see
I'll take you places where you neva thought dat you would be
I got a sassy mouth and yea I'm from da south
And you could tell because you see my ass and hips poked out
I'm best dressed no doubt, lets go it ain't no thang
Princess I'm da chick and don't forget my name
And this here won't change, you betta sho respect
Or we'll really get it poppin, Jha Jha, Crime Mob, and Dipset
If you a G, lemme see
You ain't gotta pay for da dinner, it's on me
Let's get it poppin shawty, let's get it poppin shawty
I get it poppin shawty, let's get it poppin shawty
