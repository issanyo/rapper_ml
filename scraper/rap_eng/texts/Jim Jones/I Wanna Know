I Wanna Know
Prince Malik ft Jim Jones

(Prince Malik)

I wanna know
Have you ever met somebody like me, me, me
I wanna know
Imagine driving cars, like this without keys, keys, keys
I wanna know
Have you ever had real sex on the beach, beach, beach
I wanna know
Have you ever met somebody like me
Tonight’s the night, tell me your fantasy

(Jim Jones)
I’m in that pop top rosey
Poppin’ that rosey, (Jigga)
Bad bitch ridin’ shoty like my coatie
Bonnie, Clyde, (Yup) homicide, (Ah)
The way I killed them all, I left them traumatized (Clear)
Get your breath (Clear) I told her get your breath, (Hah)
It ain’t over, tell the pilot go and get the jet, (Where we go)
To run away, (What) we on the runway, (Wow)
I’m dealing with some cakes so put your crumbs away, (Gettin money)
Now get the map, and pick a place
And bring some suntan lotion for your pretty face, (You hear that)
Penthouse crib to see the cityscape, (You see that)
No diet, but I get rid of weight

(Prince Malik)

I wanna know
Have you ever met somebody like me, me, me
I wanna know
Imagine driving cars, like this without keys, keys, keys
I wanna know
Have you ever had real sex on the beach, beach, beach
I wanna know
Have you ever met somebody like me
Tonight’s the night, tell me your fantasy

(Verse)

New coupe phantom, roof back tannin’
Drive along the coast, spend a week in Athens
Now you’re, now you’re with me
Your broke man’s history
The Prince is here now, (Yeah, yeah)
I’m on the fight scene heavy
Throwing dead prezzies
Ring side drinking wine from 1920
So tell your friends bye, unless they wanna ride
We’ll stack them all inside, (Yeah, yeah)
I know you love the life I live, (Uh huh)
My Angelina, you can have 7 kids, (Uh huh)
And I look better than Brad Pitt
And I just wanna know

(Prince Malik)

I wanna know
Have you ever met somebody like me, me, me
I wanna know
Imagine driving cars, like this without keys, keys, keys
I wanna know
Have you ever had real sex on the beach, beach, beach
I wanna know
Have you ever met somebody like me
Tonight’s the night, tell me your fantasy

(Repeat)
