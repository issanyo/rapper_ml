I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, got everything in motion
Smoke, ride
Smoke, ride
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Riding through the city top down blowing kush smoke
Black Amigo mafia so no I can't stop selling dough
And we smoke out of pounds and in the club we let that money go
I just left the Onyx, I left 20 thousand on the floor
50 thousand dollar ring, 50 thousand dollar chain
60 thousand dollar watch, plus my arm bout to ring
Plus the 40, it's in range
Extended clip on that thang
I get so much street money, how can I explain
They got me riding and thinking bout the moves that I'm making
I'm a millionaire now nigga, you could stop the hating

[Hook:Young Scooter]
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, got everything in motion
Smoke, ride
Smoke, ride
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
If I get a real jug, get smoked
On my momma it ain't no joke
See I'm riding and smoking
All my niggas they toting, my niggas they blowing, but niggas they go in
If you a stank kick your door in
And I don't do no new friends
Can't trust a soul so won't shake everybody hand
Can't trust a soul so won't shake everybody hand
I'm going crazy but don't make me have to clap a fan
The nigga hating he a opp man I think he a fan
I never lost it but I'm back at it, I'm on yo ass
I never lost a year I'm back at it pick up yo head

[Hook: Young Scooter]
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, got everything in motion
Smoke, ride
Smoke, ride
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
My niggas got that work
They ain't got no jobs
You know the rules in my hood, protect yourself or get robbed
Gangstas do what they want, you do what you can
Came down to that A, than I fly through with them bands
Nigga been on this grind since a nigga been 9
Tell the crack heads chill if you want that six nigga get on that line
So I smoked to it, I got bad nerves
I'm having flashbacks make a whole thing from a half bird
Nigga hold my wheel almost crashed the curve
Driving smoking [?] nigga that's my work
Need a steady hand, and a good wrist
That white girl is my hood bitch
Please let up some good shit

[Hook: Young Scooter]
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, got everything in motion
Smoke, ride
Smoke, ride
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
