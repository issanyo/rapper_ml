(Turn me up Stevie Q
Make sure these niggas here me clearly
Why you niggas sleeping while we working?
Understand that
There's money to be made
Its that sleep when ya dead where I'm from
If I died I woke up a Vampire
No more sleeping baby)

Jim Jones:
With every breath that's inside of me
VAMPIRE LIFE my debt to our society
Half my niggas paying debts to their society
So I been having problems with my sobriety
Word, I'm paranoid, I know they rioty
I watch the feds, I know they eying me
Promise myself never let a ho lie to me
I watch myself, Im getting bread in low economy
I pray to God that there be to lining me
I got thirty stacks in my designer jeans
Word, we getting wasted like the whole day
The bitch said my kisses taste like Rose'
But my dick harder than a roll of quarters
Twenty champagnes was the total order
A hundred grand for that frozen water
Hope you got your passport just to show the border
Up in Harlem, If I ain't God then I next to him
Drop top hard, something sexy sitting next to him
WHO GON GET IT NEXT NIGGA
I got fatty, fuck a muthafuckin cheque nigga
I keep twenty cash on me daily
Guns on blast cause they wanna kill me
We in Jamaica off Miami Vice
Catch us up in leers on Miami nights
See, ya might not understand the life
Word how I splurge about ten grand a night
The beast holding the swammy tight
Tryna tell my white girl make sure the candy right
I still hit the block if I fucking please
No roof just a watch on my fucking sleeve
Make you wanna stop an feel the fucking breeze
I told her brush the suede of my fucking sleeve

Trav: Hook:
When them lights go low (go low)
Everyone's a tough guy
I seen 'em till the shots fly
Then the sames ones that talking
Write to homicide
No way no way couldn't be my nigs
No way no way swallow my pride nigga
No way no way I'd rather die nigga
I'mma ride for my niggas
Tellem that I said no way

Jim Jones:
My statements are inadmissible in court
Cause I used to dribble hard with them bricks I brought
Get them cars, like the wicked porsche
Niggas act hard, then we load the clips in the Taurus
Ya thats sure to clear a nigga thoughts
Well if I'm underrated, that's your richest thought
Think about it, here's just a thought
They got me looking at this game like it a bitches sport
Niny says she can make ya do magic
Have ya block clicking like its blue magic
I watched the Eighties
I killed the Nineties
Now I'm having scary dreams from all this guilt behind me
So then I party like its '99
Towers hitten, it was hard for us to find a line
The drop rate is just silent dry
Me and Trav in the drop head on Sunset Drive
Now I slip in, gun by my side
Paranoid for every fan that run by his side
Trying not catch a homicide
Trying make it back to the east, where mamas fried
