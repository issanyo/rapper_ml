[Intro]
Dre the drama
My mama said  it was too hot for you
Stay ut the kitchen cause we cooking up in here

[Hook]
In the kitchen with the stove on
Here to finish up but he just dozed off
Cook the work as it won’t cook itself
Gotta hit the block as it won’t sell itself
No trap house doing numbers
Made a hunnid thousand on this corner
Here today gone tomorrow
Live fast die young

[Verse 1]
I done parked foreign cars in front of crack houses
Popping champagne standing on the back of couches
We stuck up in a cycle that’s hard to break
I did the impossible God is great
I got a couple partners tryna dodge the state
And papi bugging on the price he tryna charge for weight
I’ve been attracted to the game is always my mistake
But society is to blame is been my debate
Shit we on the hill just tryna buy some weight
At the time that the fiends was getting off bait
I’ve been up for three days I’m still wide awake
When you start to cook crack that’s an acquired taste
He had a legal defender when he tried his case
He fucked around a blew twenty five up state
Damn but that never stops the operation (not a all)
I told G to throw the gun when the cops was chasing
When mane had the five hunnid the streets was hot
You know the police was tryna raid tryna sweep the block
They was slinging pies it’s like the pizza shop
We was pushing weight just like equinox
Damn, Harlem had so many kings
I could name a bunch of niggas that saw so many things
Tiny bum was junior half a mill [?] trip
He be laughing he caught a dub and life is still a bitch
We ride through the sixteen gave him our first bricks
We did ten thousand by the first trip
Shit I’m on ace right now I still got a cousin in one “O” eight right Now
Nigga

[Hook]
In the kitchen with the stove on
Here to finish up but he just dozed off
Cook the work as it won’t cook itself
Gotta hit the block as it won’t sell itself
No trap house doing numbers
Made a hunnid thousand on this corner
Here today gone tomorrow
Live fast die young
Ay ay Live fast die young
Ay ay Live fast die young

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to black ball a money maker
You see we always made the money
The money never made us
He chose to sell drugs until they come and take us
Bust a move in LA like I’m running with with the Lakers
You know them guns they come with the lasers
I used to pray to god I hope that someone come and save us
When I was down and out my phone never ring
It had me back to selling coke just like the [?]
I’m talking bout them birds without a set of wings
Remember I got locked and never said a thing
And now now I’m with shine shot the club up
I was riding round town Billy screaming blood up
Ducking the racketeering and in the regel
I seen the cops coming steering through the peep hole
Went into the toilet tryna flush polico
Life’s a fucking movie bitch ain’t no fucking sequel
I’m just reflecting on deep thoughts
You had a brick you had to be rich what we thought
The crack house was like the skii resort
My man fighting cases right now in three courts
And he just hope it run concurrent
If not he’s on the run I hope he got endurance
Got snatched on his secret indictment due to informants
So I hardly use the phone is how I usually be on it
Doing it

[Hook]
In the kitchen with the stove on
Here to finish up but he just dozed off
Cook the work as it won’t cook itself
Gotta hit the block as it won’t sell itself
No trap house doing numbers
Made a hunnid thousand on this corner
Here today gone tomorrow
Live fast die young

We die young nigga love it tho
Live fast die young, we still in these streets
How you feeling
Live fast die young how yo temperature feeling
I still got that squad I still got that plug
I see a lot a niggas using drugs
Might as well sell em wholesale
(ha ha ha step eleven)
We sought through prayer and meditation
To improve our conscious contact with our higher power
As we understood him praying only for knowledge of his will for Us
And the power to carry that out
Step twelver
Having has a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps
We tried to carry this message to alcoholics and addicts
And to practice these principles in all our affairs
