[Intro: Jim Jones]
Now, do these niggas be banging like me?
No
They say they G, is they gangstas like me?
No, no, no
Is my guns good?
Yes
Is my ones good?
Yes
Do we run hoods?
Yes, yes, yes

[Verse: Styles P]
Mr. Pinero, the President of the hood
Rob shit, extort shit, embezzle shit when I could
My man's in the cell, but he still got his bums as H
So when he touch back down, he'd be straight
To stay loyal, niggas stay real
I'll leave you hurt and put in work to Curtis Mayfield
So when I kick down the door, niggas stay still
And don't say, "chill", everybody die when I spaz out the spray grills
Do I play games?
No
Do I trick dames?
No
Do I say names?
No, no, no
Do I kill shit?
Yes
'Til the death, nigga?
Yes
Do I rep, nigga?
Yes, yes, yes

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
Who them niggas painting? the town red? Dipset
Banks stop and we lay down bets, Byrd-Gang
Who them niggas getting that money man? Dipset
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset
