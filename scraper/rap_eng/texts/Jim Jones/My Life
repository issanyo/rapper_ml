Jim Jones (Talking):
Uh huh
We back
We still on the streets
Rap game is now the crack game
Watch out for them rap police

Jim Jones (verse 1):
The rap police is on my ass
Searchin for the ratchet
Im stepping on the gas while im swirving through the traffic
Watching the sun rise, twisting up the grass
Money on my mind, got me thinking bout the cash
'cause i heard the plottin war
You gotta have your paper right
They knocking at the door
Im hoping they dont raid tonight
We moves pies
Trying to get the treasures
Plush rides
Getting high till the FBI come and get us
And we hit them clubs in the city
Now i got the thugs and all the drug dealers with me
Splergin on the bottles
Hope the groupies follow
Im tryin to slide baby beeze of in the garllodo
The life styles of the thugs
Young rich and famous
Give a f**k about the judge
We runnin from arraignments
Speeding through life at a faster pace
So i pray to god tonight and im hoping i dont catch a case

Chorus:
Trying ride the wave in a deep sea
'cause i like to spend my life, my life, my life, my life

Ducking dt's in the z3 or the gt this is bg
Trying ride the wave in a deep sea
'cause i like to spend my nights, my nights, my nights, my nights
Ducking dt's in the z3 or the gt this is bg

Verse 2:
Now i ain't sleep about a week
My 7 Day theory
Im gunning in the streets everyday is getting scary
And any minute meet aquittance wit da reeper
But we gotta stay alive getting fadedd of the reefer
Liquor, no chaser, shits gettin major
F**king with the guns gotch ya nigga all cased up
Its for the thrill so we do it for the love of it
Like oh what a feeling mother f**ker when we thuggin it
One for Mob, two to stay free
Three to cop a ride, hundred thousand on the V
Wallin in the whip, lets talk politics
They say niggas from new york is all about a flip
Got gas on my brain, cash on the chain
And im flying up lennox fast in the lane
They say its hard up in the streets
Trying to make a million while im dodging from police

Mother f**ker can u fell me

(Chorus)
(Outro)
Pay attention while i mention
That the birdgang is on the move
While you talking here we walking
Like the way you want to do
We dem rock stars, keep dem hot cars
And a hot one for you lames
Just griding for all the paper we can get up out this game
