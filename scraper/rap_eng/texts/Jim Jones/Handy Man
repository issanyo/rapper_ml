Listen to what I'm putting down
Hey baby, I'm your handy man

I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule
I'm handy with love and I'm no fool

They'll come running to me

Here is the main thing that I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know that I really can

If your broken hearts need repair

I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
They'll come running to me

Here is the main thing that I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know that I really can
