[Intro: Red Cafe & Jim Jones]
(Vamp life)
My niggas is up (we are)
My niggas is up, my niggas is up (uh huh)
Livin' the life, (livin') livin' the life and lightin' it up (SHAKE DOWN) (we lightin' it up)
We lightin' it up, we lightin' it up

[Chorus: Red Cafe & Jim Jones]
I got a squad a hittaz (I got a squad a hittaz)
I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz (I got a squad a hittaz)
We got all the money, got the baddest bitches
I got a squad a hittaz (I got some rowdy niggas)
I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz (I got some fly bitches)
Got a pound of smoke, e'ry night we winnin'
I got a squad a hittaz

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
(Jones!)
I got a mob of niggas, I got the hardest niggas, I got my Harlem niggas (15th)
You like CP3 vs Steph, so you know you can't guard me nigga (Gotti em)
I've been shaking up the pot with the rock like a nigga in the garden nigga
I'm like a God to niggas, I'm like Gotti nigga, I got the baddest bitches (work)
They rock Lou Bouton, and Valentino shoes, and every bag is vicious (you see that?)
I'm talkin' Berkly bags, they only rock Chanel, I mean cash bidness (where the money at?)
So fuck the hate and get some cash with us, and buy Rolley watches (sky dwellers)
So the hoes could jock us, and the foes could watch us...

[Chorus: Red Cafe & Jim Jones]
I got a squad a hittaz (I got a squad a hittaz)
I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz (I got some rowdy niggas)
We got all the money, got the baddest bitches
I got a squad a hittaz (I got the baddest bitches)
I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz (I got some rowdy niggas)
Got a pound of smoke, e'ry night we winnin
I got a squad a hittaz

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
I got for the low, I got the premo (bang)
Whole squad sticking to the G code (bang)
I don't do small talk, straight drug talk (yea)
Woke up with a mission: get the drugs off (woo)
I don't work fish scale in fish tank (brrr)
I'mma have my big bank take little bank (brrr)
Niggas said "all money ain't good money" (bah)
250 for this zone, that's good money
Street nigga push weight, no bowflex (hanh)
Leave the scene bloody, no cortex
E'ry summer, bring the drops and bikes out
Let's keep it 100, we them niggas right now
Fuck the law, get money
Use the money to make more money
Pray for me to make more money
'Cuz if I lose, I'm takin' your money

[Chorus: Red Cafe & Jim Jones]
I got a squad a hittaz (I got a squad a hittaz)
I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz (I got some rowdy niggas)
We got all the money, got the baddest bitches
I got a squad a hittaz (I got the baddest bitches)
I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz (I got some rowdy niggas)
Got a pound of smoke, e'ry night we winnin
I got a squad a hittaz

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
(Capo!)
I'd done paid the dues, even made the news
Stayed down and I played the rules, hotel suites with the crazy views (shit)
And all praises due, buck-twenty, let the Mercedes cruise (easy)
Take one brick and make two, then get real a bitch that'll take you through like... (work)
I take trips to the beach just to see how the water feel (clean)
And if you talkin' money, between the wrist and the whip, that's at least like a quarter mil (ill)
You see something funny, I got young boy that'll hit you up just for the thrill (deal up)
And that's all mine, half these niggas all fakin' ass on the rhyme

[Chorus: Red Cafe & Jim Jones]
I got a squad a hittaz (I got a squad a hittaz)
I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz (I got some rowdy niggas)
We got all the money, got the baddest bitches
I got a squad a hittaz (I got the baddest bitches)
I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz, I got a squad a hittaz (I got some rowdy niggas)
Got a pound of smoke, e'ry night we winnin
I got a squad a hittaz

[Outro: Red Cafe & Jim Jones]
My niggas is up (we are)
My niggas is up, my niggas is up (we gettin' it)
Livin' the life, (huh) livin' the life and lightin' it up (we light shit up)
We lightin' it up, (uh huh) we lightin' it up
(huh, we lightin' it up, we lightin' it up
We been gettin' money
Who you think invented the mob?
Shout to my squad
You ain't really a hitta unless the young boys get ya
Work
Squad)
