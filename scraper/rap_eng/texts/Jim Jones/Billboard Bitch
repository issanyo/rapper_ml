[Verse 1: Avian]
I need a pretty raw chick like Rihanna
Touch a bitch for the first time like Madonna
Strap it on the bass like Gaga
You didn't have it, girl, but I'mma put it on you

I want a ménage with Nicki
Be a slave with Britney
Make Alicia hear that slow long up here

[Chorus: Avian]
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
Put that platinum pussy on it
And I'mma make you famous

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I need a billboard bitch
Man, I had a few of those hoes
Guess what? I'm still bored, bitch
You still a broad bitch
I hit it from the back, I tell her sing my chorus
Yes, I put on that side not, yes sire
And I quote, she ride the beat then ride today
Oh, shit, she hit that high note
That billboard chick's on the block where I sell keys
I done named names, check the credits on my LVs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
With a ratchet or a billboard bitch
They all just want this real good dick
I'm bait, I reel them in like fish
Big pimp, oh, she taste like shrimp
All I do is hit, I never miss
Fucked her so good she left a Tip
Front, back, side, I hit all spots
But like the billboard, I love her on top

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Britney or Estelle, hit me on my cell
I don't discriminate, I put that dick up in the jail
Catch me with Keyshia, I tell you how I sex her
In my drop top Ferrari, call it mustard back ketchup
And tell Rihanna I will call her off a nanny
Fuck her from the back while she holding all the Grammies
With Nicki a ménage, if it's me, her and [?]
Or catch me daydreaming about JLo and her body

[Verse 5: Avian]
Oh, you about to be a star
Coming for you quick, girl
You're top ten or better
Oh, make you known around the world
I know you're a sexy girl
Let's take it to another level

[Chorus]
