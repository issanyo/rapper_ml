Aha! Yeah!
You're OK?
Aha! Yeah!
What's that smell?
Aha! Money!
And that's?

Don't know why I'm so incredible!
Don't know why I'm so incredible!
I'm their fellow,?and say hello
No one in their corner?
You do TTA, the aka spray
The best thing to do is pray!
Guns and? like a stage or a play
And I don't play, but I will lay anybody down
Cash is clay, ?let it spray like a ? blaze
Your chick eat your dick, let me write Dr. Dree, yeah!
.. soccer play, and everyday I'm fresh
.. get off my air, you're occupying my space!
Three feet and oppression
Better ... your breaks
It's so.. relaxing, check my resume
Shall I e-mail it or fax it?
I'm chasing paper, walk into the action
Eat gold, sh_t diamonds, ?

Chorus:
Don't know why I'm so incredible!
Don't know why I'm so incredible!
Don't know why I'm so incredible!
I'm their fellow,? and say hello
So incredible! Hello, hello!
So incredible!

Born in the 80s, sex like the 60s
Smoke like the 70s, make classic like the 90s
Allow me! Too segregate like the 50s
Cause we are not a light ball especially with the 16s
Bitch please, the world revolves around me
Do as I say and that will be the smart thing!
For peace sake, I never heard what she..
I do.. this, but it's all on me!
As you see, tame me, keep me tamed
The haters.. like a crochet brace!
So with this f_ck me, I'll f_ck the
Trust our papery, ?!
Stop like parades, read letter from your ?
Son, we are juniors like eleven grade
That's the level, you 're on!
Daddy is home!
I'm all about the Benjamin, like Diddy song!

Chorus:
Don't know why I'm so incredible!
Don't know why I'm so incredible!
Don't know why I'm so incredible!
I'm their fellow,? and say hello
So incredible! Hello, hello!
So incredible!
