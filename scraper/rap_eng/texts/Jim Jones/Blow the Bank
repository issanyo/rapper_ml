You know, everybody expect a baller but I'm like
Why you worried about balling, 'cause I am balling
I'm just ready to blow the bank on you, girl

You know, we just splashing them this year
It's all about that splash life
I still live the fast life, I blow the bank though

I got at place in mind, for my move to LA
Or my mansion in NJ, we can party in the sky
Where you wanna go?
From Manhattan to my hood
Where my money's never good
We can spend it playa, tell me what you want

Trying to scoop something nice
(Fly, girl)
Trying to put you on the flight
I'm a jumper, we can do Aruba tonight
Or we can jump in the coupe and just shoot for the night

She was dancing in the club with her pumps in her hand
Trying to tell her that The Trump was the plan
Trying to get her out of the club
And have her jump in the Lamb
(Murcielago)

Konichiwa, we can jump to Japan
(You like sushi?)
Or we can just do the tropics

We need more problems cause the money ain't the object
Probably get mad cause the smokes in the cockpit
(So what?)
Chest cold as a froze up locket

I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash
I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash, let's go

In Atlanta, popped up like a toaster
(I'm burnt out)
Did Miami in the soft-top roadster
(drop top)

Rose champs, spilling drinks on the sofa
(Champaign don't stain)
Thank God for the chauffeur

Where to little lady?
She's my designated driver
Bad little B, like the destiny survivor
(She's a dime)

We can see the sun rise up
Speeding to the room in the V getting highed up
(Hit that, hit that)
Or we can jump through the block

Brand new whip, so you can jump through the top
Hop out like who got bank
Then we blow it all cause you know we gonna ball

I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash
I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash
