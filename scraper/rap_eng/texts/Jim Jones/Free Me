[Intro:]
Hey y’all
(musicians, musicians, musicians)
D Rock D Rock

[Chorus:]
A lot of n*ggas hating when they wanna be me
Hoes go crazy when them bitches see me
Started on the block and now that I’m on TV
A whole lot dumber yelling free me
Yelling free me
No more deadly cops running from the DC
Kids growing up and they wanna be me
Just like my homies [?]

[Verse 2:]
Consequences when you in the streets
Gotta always keep a pistol when you in a beef
I saw a n*gga get a meal and lost it in a week
Same n*gga sleep on your couch will kill you in your sleep
It’s a cold world but I done seen it all
Sometimes you gotta ride with no team at all
You can have the passion
You can dream it all
Believe in God and you can fly with no wings at all
Have my own back
Moved my own stack
Before rap, real rap, I had my own track
From fist fights to shoot outs
I had my own strap
Life front you the worth but
I got my own back
Yeah I got my own back
Ten toes n*gga’s been hoes
These bitches beggin I just give em NOs
Lookin Cali top down n*gga as the wind blows

[Chorus]
