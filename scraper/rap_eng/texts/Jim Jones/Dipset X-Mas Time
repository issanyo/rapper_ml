Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time
It's fin to be a good Christmas this year
Santa know when you're good or bad and we're ballin'

The music's tight, the block is stuffed
We're here tonight and that's what's up
Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time
Livin' fast it's dipset Christmas time

Look I'm tryna live everyday like it's Christmas
I shovel yay so everyday a *** risk this
Blow from the copeyes, feelin' like popeyes
'Cause I'm in the coupe with a chicken and a biscuit

My *** get the same thing every year
Different mew new year match the color with they hair
And you know it cost kitty if I wear
A red monkey on the jeans, eleven hundred for the pair

Might show 'em how to ball this year, yeah
The dogs the fresh London fog this year
Put the box up pull out the foxy long hair
Fresh ta death might open a morgue this year

That's how I'm feelin' holiday season
That's the holiday greeting
Buy a ratchet for the holiday heathin'
They might be doin' holiday squeezin', ya dig?

The music's tight, the block is stuffed
We're here tonight and that's what's up
Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time
Livin' fast it's dipset Christmas time

I want it all from racetracks to the ball games
Now we race fast in the Porsche thing
I gotta ball gettin' cash of the raw cane, I got it
And wifey want the super charged range, she got it

I think the coupe might do the hard thing for real
Gotta do seventy and I pops the wing
A little car trivia, every car giddy up like a Clydesdale
The mood is right and I'm high as hell
Big trucks through the snow like a one horse slay

The V-12 come with five hundred horses
And my whole team ballin' and we all flossy
Now I'm hearin' piff while I'm sniffin' the eggnog
Pumpin' my *** and I'm whippin' the best cars

That's 'cause we get dough
So this year mommy Benz with the red bow
You know we gettin' dollas like pref low
Holiday season so we sippin' on the XO

The music's tight, the block is stuffed
We're here tonight and that's what's up
Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time
Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time
Livin' fast it's dipset Christmas time

It's Christmas time everybody jolly
Feel it blood, everybody wanna party
Get ya flag on red rags out
Feelin' good pull the red jags out

We gonna ball at the red lights
Shit pretty ***, blind a ho with the head lights
Oh, I heard lotus poppin'
A lotta pretty *** with the fishnet stockings

Hit the club by the bar route
Where the dutches at get the jars out
And put the piffy in the air
I ain't that bent don't skip me, give it here

And we could one two step
Throw ya gang up what hood you rep nine tres
And everybody spazz out
Get blowed homie 'til you *** pass out, it's Christmas

The music's tight, the block is stuffed
We're here tonight and that's what's up
Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time
Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time
Livin' fast it's dipset Christmas time

Hey, hey, have a very merry Christmas
Have a dipset Christmas and a happy New Year
