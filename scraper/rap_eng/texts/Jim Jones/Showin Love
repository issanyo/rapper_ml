Fuck the po's from my Jersey
Just gon' make 'em wanna murk me
But that big one won't let 'em hurt me
Y'all niggas oh shit
Y'all niggas do not make me nervous

Y'all niggas don't want the work
I'm bout to show y'all boys the worst
Until they lay me in a hearse
And you can label me as first, uh
Icon in your eye
Champagne on they face
Every table I'ma stand
Ragtag with my mans
Damn we gon' ride till the casket
Drummer need a bigger plot
To fit the jewels and the rocks

Walking and I made a (?)
At the top boy I'm locked on
Top chart, Billboard
I keep putting on where I'm from
And they show me so much love

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
These bitches niggas help me throw it off
Cop the foreign then show it off
Riding shotty, no sawed off
Hopping out of them four doors
My bitch packing that .44
Told the plug I need more raw
Cop cars you never saw before
Pop bottles in Audemar
Got the big crib, six rooms, AKs in my corridor
60k for that Audemar, bad bitches like Bora Bora
Uptown always had the work but I got it cheaper from Florida
Sold rugs from shore to shore
All facts, I'm sure, I'm sure
Whew look at my dab
Nah bitch look at this bag
200,000 look at the cash
Half of that bag I will put on your ass

[Hook: Eearz]
Oh they showing all this love, they showing all this love

They showing all this love, they showing all this love
I can't forget my thugs and all of us is thugs
I do this shit for y'all, they showing all this love
They showing all this love, they showing all this love

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
I ain't even from the city but they treat me like I own it
Breakfast in bed, good head in the morning
They showing all this love, they showing all this love
Put that on my mama, I'll never be a scrub
Fucking bitches, popping bottles, smoking what I love
Bend it over, let me see it, like my name Bun
I said bend it over, let me see it, like my name Bun
You don't wanna lose your bitch to a nigga this young
Feeling like I'm at the crib how they showing all this love
All the money that I'm getting, gotta thank the Man above
Everybody dapping, everybody want a hug
This one for my city, this one for my day ones
I say everybody dapping, everybody showing love
And this one for my city, this one here for my thugs

[Hook: Eearz]
Oh they showing all this love, they showing all this love
I can't forget my thugs and all of us is thugs

They showing all this love, they showing all this love
I can't forget my thugs and all of us is thugs
I do this shit for y'all, they showing all this love
They showing all this love, they showing all this love
