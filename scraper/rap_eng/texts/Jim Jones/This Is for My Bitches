This goes out to all my fly ladies, all across the world
You know I love you
And I'm sorry if I called you a bitch
Sincerely yours, Jones

Shawty's like the sexiest thing that I've ever seen
She is like a drug and you know Im'a fiend
When we sexin', shawty let me
Do the different freaky things to her

And I like the way she kiss me when we're all alone
And like when she miss me, she be callin' ma phone
Like where you been? Let's get it in
Scoop her up like, baby, let's roll

This is for my bitches
All around the world and they straight up sexy
All around the world ladies can you feel me?
That's the girls I like I put your hands up high, I, I, I

This is for my bitches
All around the world and they straight up sexy
All the girls around the world ladies can you feel me?
That's the girls I like I put your hands high, I, I, I
This is for my bitches

From New York, she was summer laid
(Like a star)
Pretty thang from around the way
(She was all)

Body like she was from the A
I like I like M.I.A
High drops that's the way we play
Top down major would a made ya day
Spending money like a Vegas day
