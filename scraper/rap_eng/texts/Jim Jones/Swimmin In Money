[Intro:]
Honorable C note
Dip dip dipping the rope
Police they pulling me over
I’m up in the kitchen my bitch is so vicious
Whipping y’all
My n*ggas from Haiti
They sending em over

[Chorus:]
The way that they wrap if you coming through customs you can’t smell the odor
I don’t want to name my plug
We n*ggas swimming in money
He got me swimming in money
Real n*ggas swimming in money
I don’t want to name my plug
We n*ggas swimming in money
He got me swimming in money
Real n*ggas swimming in money

[Verse 1:]
I was just in the hood with the catch up
In the projects took the crack up
When I first met the plug man he was so big
He was bringing in weight in a Mack truck
Now when they be swimming in money
Like cuban n*ggas swimming for the border
I was doing swell till the towers had fell
Then I started getting things for a quarter
Before that they was like 19
That was not 5 I was like 19
At the same time I was in Mack’s truck
I remembered Wu Tang had dropped ice cream
I can’t front when a n*gga used to bump
Just to serve white fiends
I was always scared that they might beat em up
Didn’t want get bit something like sharks
So I cut all my losses
And amidst the crash got cautious
Got me some iced up crosses
Jimmy Chu bear all white forces
Got a bad bitch looking
Can’t far she was real good looking
She throw it I’m a catch like it back catcher
N*gga throw it, I’m a throw the whole mack at ya

[Chorus:]
Police they pulling me over
I’m up in the kitchen my bitch is so vicious
Whipping y’all
My n*ggas from Haiti
They sending em over
The way that they rap if you coming through customs you can’t smell the odor
I don’t want to name my plug
We n*ggas swimming in money
He got me swimming in money
Real n*ggas swimming in money
I don’t want to name my plug
We n*ggas swimming in money
He got me swimming in money
Real n*ggas swimming in money

[Verse 2:]
Taking the plug
He got it ready to win it
Got a coop for the chickens
Two mexican bitches
One washing dishes the other one whipping
Drop the top on the Bentley
Miami vent how we livin my n*gga
Whip up the dope got em fiending
Papi no speak no English
Calling my phone, send me the dope
We hook up with Papi this weekend
Asian connect got a jeep
Sending them over the water
Wrap up the brick like I told ya
Hide the dope in the motor
Moving the yolo
Crossing the border
Dodging polices
Tucking my forty
I cannot serve you if I do not know you
I’m counting the hunneds we blow it like that
And we swimming in money

[Chorus]
