[Intro: Jim Jones & (Trey Songz)]
You see rap music is subliminal
But the music for us is like our own diary
Something like a confession
They tell me life is a bitch (That's a summer with Miami)
She somethin' like the seasons just like mother nature
She comes and go as she please
Thats why they get their period once a month (Yeah)
I say that to say this if you think that bitch
The summer is yours (That's a summer with Miami)
She could be cheating on you
Ya heard

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
It's got me feelin' like opium
I'm tryna dance with the loaded M
Open a bottle and it goes around
I'm leavin' drunk 'bout 4 A.M
And watch me jump up in a Dolce Benz
Top down with the pokey rims
And now I'm swervin' so you know I'm bent
I lost count, who knows what I spent
I recall nine cleavers
Bitches steppin' on my Nike sneakers
With one hand in the sky and the other hand was on her thigh
I was grindin' to the beat with my hammer on my side
Now the G's only as we speed to the Rolex
And three or four G's is what we sneeze at the Rolex
Playing some, glance at my Chopard, it's 'bout 6 A.M
You think the night is over but it just begin
They say Club Space like Bad Boys 2
You can see the snow bunnies doin' what bad girls do
Thats ecstasy weed that had girl to
Scoop the bitch that had keys that sellin' fast off blue
Now I'm speedin' to the telly got the Porsche behind
Tryna get in her belly the only thought on my mind
Like damn, not tryna be pushy or nothing
But since the strip joint girl, I should have been fucking

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Spendin' my summers with the drop top low
Throwin' my 100s at the top notch hoes
And we smokin' on the top notch dro
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air, livin' without a care
Shawty beside me, blowin' through her hair
Hold on, no
That's a summer with Miami

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
I can't keep it long anymore
I be with my girl when it starts to snow, I get bored
And when you love three women, it's hard to keepin' up with the lies
You see spring's my first love, I started creepin' with July
Used to say I had some shows, catch a plane to M-I
Then I started trickin' dough and bought a Range for July
Mama said I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie
And I first seen her when I told Nas I'd slap off his kufi
We don't play disrespect but that was the day that me met
Summer jam '02, I hit the stage with my set
But her man, he was from Brooklyn she still slipped me the number
She said he's on vacation, so get with me this summer
Then I been flirtin' with her over the past two years
Now she hates seein' me in the winter, ain't gon' last through the year
So now I'm lookin' at winter like life's an adventure
And then when June comes, I'll be gone 'til September
Now would you hate me for that?
I know your heart's cold could you wait 'til I'm back
I'm just a sucker for love
But a nigga hold you down if you wanna fuck with a thug

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Spendin' my summers with the drop top low

And we smokin' on the top notch dro
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air, livin' without a care

Hold on, no
That's a summer with Miami
