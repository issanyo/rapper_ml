[Intro]
So now ladies and gentleman it is star time
Are you ready for star time
Uh, you ready

[Hook]
In the jungle where it get risky
Where we are
Damn that bullet just missed me
Here’s go roley kinda iffy (say yes)
But they got bottles for two fifty
Leaving out that bitch all pissy
Fresh trunk load on the wristy
Killing this shit coming in so who gon

[Verse 1]
I couldn’t see what I was destined to be
Between the fumes in the kitchen
When I was chefing to see
Like the piano man I’m step on a key
Then ran up in the dealer dropped a cheque on a v
Nobody riding shotty just a tech in the seat
You drop money on my head you need to check the receipt
When them boys crash cars they just wreck it and leave
I’m six points in the stones vvs in the piece
Yankee to the back I’m still repping the east
Ballman level something fresh on ma feet
Shit, I still drive reckless in a foreign car
Crash this one today I buy a car tomorrow
Too much drinks I see [?] in the rr
I got a lawyer turn a murder to an r and r
Shit, holy water quenching ma thirst
Been a long time since grandma send me to church
Popping out the drop with a forty in the house
Feeling like I [?] when [?]
Or better yet fresh when he got rich from bricks
Feeling pretty good but I get sick with the whips
Know a couple niggas who got rich off of licks
I could still cook a burro with a flick of the wrist
All I need is a crib with a stove and a fan in it
I’m cooling best like whatever is in my hand in it
One watch having two hundred and eighty grand in it
Middle of the winter nigga standing with a tan in it
Main event with the red carpet photos
Lost a couple dollars just betting on [?] tho
Heard niggas talking but this ain’t what you want
Far from a saint but hail saint laurent
This ain’t just for front we  do bird off drive by
I blow a bag swerve off a fly ride
Shit now I got this bitch [?]
She should be happy she got all the garden bread sticks
Bird ass niggas watching who you getting prey with
You see them niggas start snitching when them feds hit
Shit still show you where bodies is buried
We sell drugs buys maseratis and cherry
Putting nice man in the lobby [?] scary
Praying to the sky thought god couldn’t hear me
Think about ma mans man ma eyes turning teary
That’s why in this  day I still keep the llama near me
Niggas play me close but I always been larry

[Hook]
In the jungle where it get risky
Where we are
Damn that bullet just missed me
Here’s go roley kinda iffy (say yes)
But they got bottles for two fifty
Leaving out that bitch all pissy
Fresh trunk load on the wristy
Killing this shit coming in so who gon

[Verse 2]
When you see me in the street don’t surprise me
My grandmother raised me and she don’t even recognize me
But they respect and eyes me
Cause I stay with the weapon by me
I did this shit in [?] cause I forgot when he testified me
From the deficit of death and zombies dressing army
Making decisions should I listen to the best of [?]
Got a lot off the market tryna catch the timing
The foulest thing I did was steal a tech when they left it by me
Shouldn’t have kept it by me he shouldn't have next to try me
But not to worry I probly got extras
Try to fuck around with I’m not that anybody
I march pit but the pit is a new part of the pity party
[?] with ma siblings I’m the oldest
But when it’s big the difference when you act like this
We’re dealing villain I spit like I’m on adrenaline
Get in the feeling’s real and the children in the building chilling
Watching and dealing killing
Way my pen is spilling you think I’m the penicillin
Still I’m kneeling to god how did I get in sin is killing
Used to watch my uncle billy sit and look in the ceiling
Something chipped would often when [?]
He’s off the gill again [?]

Hey
Star time star time star time
Jimmy’s business is jimmy’s business
We all need friends, even jimmy even you
