Hey Jim Jones, let's show these boys how it really goes down
Hey Lil Jon, you know what we tell these boys when they campin' out wit' the blunt, right?
We tell 'em puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass

I smell that sticky icky, who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky icky, who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky

I smell that sticky (oh yeah)
Who got that sticky? (I do)
I smell that sticky (oh yeah)
Who got that sticky? (me too)

I smell that sticky (oh yeah)
Who got that sticky? (I do)
I smell that sticky (oh yeah)
Who got that sticky? (me too)

You know the drill, break it up, break it up
You know the drill, roll it up, roll it up
You know the drill, light it up, light it up
You know the drill, smoke it up, smoke it up

Now puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass
You fuckin' up the rotation, that thang there burnin' fast
This ain't a joke, stop playin', I need to smoke
This thang can get dirty and I ain't talkin' 'bout sprinklin' coke

I need that sticky icky, that Miami crippy
That Washington High purple, watch out that thang will hurt you
I need that Cali chronic, damn, a chico on it
Some of that Seattle supersonic will have you like Nevada want it fucked up

That's right, high as a kite
Now roll the next one and pass me the light
'Cause we ready fo' sho', ready to go
Ready to blow, let's roll

I smell that sticky icky, who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky icky, who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky

I smell that sticky (oh yeah)
Who got that sticky? (I do)
I smell that sticky (oh yeah)
Who got that sticky? (me too)

I smell that sticky (oh yeah)
Who got that sticky? (I do)
I smell that sticky (oh yeah)
Who got that sticky? (me too)

If thirty's the new twenty, Patr√≥n's the new Henney
Roll in a new Bentley, blowin' like two twenty
That ain't the price of the car, now that's a half ounce of piff, dawg
You gotta have a strong chest just to hit the raw

Or you'll be coughin' up a lung
Harlem, where we from so of course we gettin' drunk (twisted)
We hit the parties, poppin' bottles just for fun
Smokin' weed in your club, call the coppers, let 'em come

Miami, Trey O Five, we cop it out the bro house
A generator so the lights don't go out
A big profit in that greenery
We now stoppin' by the beach just for scenery

When here it's 45, up here it's 65
Meet you in Carolina, get it for 55
(We got them pounds) Nigga 'cause every day we hustlin'
It's heavy cake and druggin' it, so heavyweight we smuggle it

Who got that sticky? (me too)

Puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass

Puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass

Puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass
