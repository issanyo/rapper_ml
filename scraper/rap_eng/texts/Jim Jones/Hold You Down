Uh, Chris, what up
Long time
It ain’t been long enough though

Anything you need
I’ma hold you down
If you call on me
I’ma hold you down
Whatever you need
(You know them late nights is crazy)
I’ma hold you
I’ma hold you down, down, down

Anything you need
(Just chasin’ that paper)
I’ma hold you down
If you call on me
I’ma hold you down
(I ain’t goin’ nowhere)
Whatever you need
I’ma hold you
I’ma hold you down, down, down

First option and my last resort (Chris)
We was both laughin’ when you crashed the Porsche (Word)
I still remember when you bring the cash to court (Remember that?)
And sometimes though I feel we on a crash course (Forreal)
When we first met we was flying back and forth (You was open)
New York to Miami back to New York (Just jokin’)
I can’t front, I’m sorry ‘bout our last fight (Word)
I’m just happy that we can joke about your crash pipes
(I got that fixed though right)
You been through real situations
A couple times you had to punch a couple bitches faces (Almost got me lawsuit)
And all that pain you endured (Sorry bout that)
I’m tryin’ to tell you it won’t be the same moving forward
(I’m tryin’ to work wit’ it)
You know I buy you what you want when you want it (All the time)
I love how you get silly when I get you glunnin’ (You sour head)
But you smarter than most niggas (Forreal)
You tell me even watch out for the close niggas (I love you for that)

Anything you need
I’ma hold you down
If you call on me
I’ma hold you down
Whatever you need
I’ma hold you
I’ma hold you down, down, down

Anything you need
I’ma hold you down
If you call on me
I’ma hold you down
Whatever you need
I’ma hold you
I’ma hold you down, down, down

We go together like Martin and Gina
You lay me back like a Bentley or a Beemer (Oh, do I?)
You push my buttons like a coupe two seater ina wife beater
Baby bring it back cause I’m a keeper

And I can tell you gettin’ tired for bein’ all alone
(It’s worth it though)
My late nights in the stu when you call my phone (Chasin’ paper)
And through that you hold me down like we strings (I love you for that)
And you still goin’ hard like you in the paint (Like Flocka Flame)
But your friends probably still think I’m the worst yet (Fuck em though)
But they probably still mad at every purse you get (Which one next?)
Been a long time since we first met (Miami)
Six years and you went and took the first step (You crazy for that one)
You used to ask when we goin’ see a ring
Got tired of that, went and bought me the ring (Funny nigga)
But we did it all, got a dog and a house with it (House!)
I guess you was tired of playin’ spouse wit’ it (I love you boo)

Anything you need
I’ma hold you down
If you call on me
I’ma hold you down
Whatever you need
I’ma hold you
I’ma hold you down, down, down

Anything you need
I’ma hold you down
If you call on me
I’ma hold you down
Whatever you need
I’ma hold you
I’ma hold you down, down, down
