[Intro: Jim Jones] + (Wayne Marshall)
Ok (Uh huh) You know what it is (True true true true true true)
Another DipSet rudeboy shottas connection
Shoutout to my man Vybz Kartel (Vybz Kartel: Up to di time)
All my Portmore shottas, Wayne, I see you Wayne

My Kingston rudeboys, you know, we DipSet mobsters now
So Wayne just holla at 'em, holla

[Chorus: Wayne Marshall]
Straight off the top, we gettin focus now
We gonna top the pops, wait until Def Jamaica drops
We gonna make it clear, we gonna take you there
I told you when the smoke is clear

You know we'll be there

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Catch me hoppin through your lobby boy
I'm what you call a shotta with a shotty boy poppin at you batty boys
Pon Di River Pon Di Bank row your boat
Oh no it's boat loads of coke (Yeah!)
And we got pounds of kiki that's brown and green weed
Think you found a kiwi (Yeah!)
We lock it down fa scheezy
Lock down this easy clown around I squeeze three (Yeah!)
You might catch me packin a fo' fifth
After a good plate of some ackee and saltfish
I take a plane straight from the eastern
Fly straight into Kingston call Wayne and his peeps man (True)

Bang in the heat man, we pay the police man (Yeah!)
We don't go to jail for this
We won't go to jail for shit now run go and tell your bitch

[Chorus: Wayne Marshall]
Straight off the top, we gettin focus now
We gonna top the pops, wait until Def Jamaica drops
We gpnna make it clear, we gonna take you there
I told you when the smoke is clear

You know we'll be there

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel] + (Wayne Marshall)
Diplomats gimme Diplomatic immunity
From Portmore city to Harlem community
Nuff thanks fi di opportunity
Now reggae and hip hop hand and hand like love and unity
Mi come collect weh due to mi, benjamins crazy props
Platinum from out di shops wear furs like di fox
Flow sick like anthrax pon dem tracks, we use to fire shots
Now we call di shots no need to call di cops
Everyday Jimmmy J Mr. Juelz
In a crazy throwback with matchin old schools
Dem and Marshall tek it to di fools
Vybz Kartel style technological like protools
When we roll people watch we more than di nightly news
Dem seh, up to di time dat's di slang we widely use
Wayne it's di right time we choose (True)
Fi get record sales bigger than sale of di Nike shoes

[Verse 3: Wayne Marshall]
Yep, that's who we are (Oh)
Straight thugs and superstars (Superstars)
They know we would a reach this far (Reach this far)
Now hip hop and dancehall a par (Oh oooh)
Yes, from di gangster flex (Gangster flex)
Now we be flashin and cashin checks (Cashin checks)
Can't predict what's comin next (No no way)
We movin up and makin giant steps

[Verse 4: Jim Jones] + (Wayne Marshall)
Booyacka booyacka off a Jimmy Rankin
Rudeboys fight for white they pumpin
You know Harlem's hard
Like Kingston Jamaica down in the bottom yard (Boom!)
Yes we bringin our paper comin to charge our cards
See my paper so ill, it's in Jamaica for real
I'm 'gon straight to Negril that's where they make it for real
(True) Cruise through the ghettowith Wayne (Hey!)
We got them foreigner plates you know my ghetto the same

Up in them foreigner states
You know what's terrible things we got the horrible fate
Rudeboy shottas that move on shottas
Fuckers! Tuesday blockers can't do much nada
Eh eh! DipSet mobsters
We there connectin with some Kingston rastas, shit, wooh!
Hit the block kill a dread, get a Glock filled with tech
Lick a shot kill him dead

[Chorus: Wayne Marshall]
Straight off the top, we gettin focus now
We gonna top the pops, wait until Def Jamaica drops
We gpnna make it clear, we gonna take you there
I told you when the smoke is clear

You know we'll be there
