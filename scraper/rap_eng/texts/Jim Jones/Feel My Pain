Money changes everything

A lot of real niggas that’s dad ain’t going to prison
Cuz these fuck niggas jumpin on the stainless steel snitching

I wish a nigga try me for a sucker, ima bust em and leave his old girl with a broken heart
I'm only killing off the block, that's why i ride with the Choppas on deck
I drop the top like a star, you know i ride with my hoppers on deck
Got the good and the car, I'm getting money so you know I stay fresh
Don't see these pussy niggas cause they flaw, and they hating cause they bitches gone sweat
I keep me shooter on deck, that'll leave me a fuck nigga where
That'll open up a fuck nigga chest, with the two twenty-two
Yeah, I'm in the hood like a Don, I ride with the choppers on deck
I'm getting money off the high, that's why I ride with the choppers on deck
