Verse 1
Jim Jones:
I'm Rick James
"I'm rich bitch" is what I tell her
Just left the bank, I took 50 from the teller
I finna make it rain, so get you an umbrella
We also make it snow, we cocaine gram sellers
Ballin', gettin' high, dollars fallin' from the sky
Big reefer cloud, got a stormin' inside
Pourin' outside, I'm usually flooring when I drive
That a buck 60 feels like you soaring in the sky
Blowing money on the liquor (twisted)
We at the strip joint blowing money on the bitches
We standing on the bar throwing money like a pitcher
But nigga, I ain't slippin', got a fully-loaded trigger
And that can cause a heatwave
I mean, you diggin' you a deep grave
Niggas Trump yo' ass, have you missin' you for three days
Cam said that this nigga's a sucka

These niggas just sweet like a ta-he-she treat
Okay, they say I'm fulla hot air, then I release the heat

Stack Bundles:
Look, nothin' changed
I'm shot-callin' like I'm supposed to be
