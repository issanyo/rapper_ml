[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
I put it all on the line
Now I'm out here living my life (best life)
My best life (best life)
Ooooohhhhh!

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
I put it all on the line like clothes hanging out to dry
Used to pack the 5, my clip hanging out the side
Front the club, bagging bitches while we hanging out the ride
Since a young boy, man, the gang been outside
Pointing at the cars that belong to the dealers
Now we point and buy cars when we going in the dealer
Had the same jeweler for at aleast the last 20
Million dollar crib and I was down to my last 20
Niggas ain't shit when you down to your last pennies
3 homes, 1 bad mortgage, a crashed Bentley
They tried to block me out of the check race
Don't make you be the reason for my next case

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
I put it all on the line
Now I'm out here living my life (best life)
My best life (best life)
I put it all on the line (flooded my Rollie, oh!)
Flooded my wrist, now they gotta watch me shine (best life)
Living my best life (best life)
Ooooohhhhh!

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
From all the bad times, now I'm living my best life
Few niggas that I wanna see in my next life
Talk about that white girl 'cause she was my ex wife
I was cooking up the coke like I was scrambling egg whites
Well, and plus I got a problem with attachment
Bad bitch, won't catch her in the party being ratchet
She know that I'm a G, I be in parties with my ratchet
The way she threw it back you know a nigga had to catch it
She asked if I was wild, I said, "Yeah, I could be reckless"
Drop (?), drop another hunnid on a necklace
She tried to gimme me head before we hit the exit
So I parked and dropped the top
And watch 'em both get naked, I mean

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
I put it all on the line
Now I'm out here living my life (best life)
My best life (best life)
I put it all on the line (flooded my Rollie, oh!)
Flooded my wrist, now they gotta watch me shine (best life)
Living my best life (best life)
Ooooohhhhh!

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
Ooooohhhhh, ooooouuuuu
Flooded my Rollie, oh!
Ah yeah, now I'm living my life
Living my best life, oooohhhh, ooohhh
Yeah yeah ye-yeah, yeah ye-yeah
Yeah yeah ye-yeah, yeah ye-yeah
Flooded my Rollie, oh!
