[Intro]
Dipset, Jones! Huh
How G is this? Gangsta [Jim Jones]
How G is this? Gangsta [Killa Cam]
How G is this? Gangsta [Santana]
How G is this? Gangsta [Freeky!]
How G is this? Gangsta [DipSet!]
How G is this? Gangsta [DipSet!]
How G is this? Gangsta [It's Dipset!]

[Hook 1]
I'm from this other side where brother ride
You bangin' all these colors, right? [Brraaat]
Get caught up on the wrong turf and you a bitch
They goin' up in your skirt [Nigga's pussy]
And life, man
The stakes is high
Cause my niggas tryna eat, and
The price of the steak is high
But my niggas ain't go'n settle for no
Cheese steaks and fries [Nope!]
Every nigga in my ghetto
Could you please relate to I? [Holla at me]
You see the boys that police chase to ride, and [Fuck Squally]
Speak no name in the [?] train [Screw police]
Dangerous ground where gang'uhs get found [Brrrat Brrrat]
Slumped, slain; with their brains on the ground [flash!]
I've been through the marathon, and singing the saddest song [Struggle continues]
And crime ain't go'n stop if you speak to Minister Farrakhan [?]
How could you wack somebody to a tone [screw that]
When we grew up hard body, and
No body was at home? [Where's my mother at?]
So, of course, we plagued the lobby with the chrome
And my city filled with thugs
Place Gotti on the throne [RIP], or
Niggas like Fritz, to get it like Rich [Harlem!]
And I would'a said Alpo
But the nigga's a SNITCH [Don't respect that!]
I'm from the projects where the B's ride hard
Taft and Foster where they breathe 5 Stars, and
Task Force in the Caprice try hard, to get you
Trapped and caught on a 3 to 9 charge. [Fuck the judge]
Convicted to sales, restricted to jails [8x10], I guess my
Vision just failed, but this isn't hell
Shit

[Hook 2]
In every ghetto, niggas hanging just like us, and uh
If beef come, think "Ain't no thing." and just go'n bust
But I don't know what the fuck they thought
Them niggas go'n bang, just like us, and uh
Rep they set for their gang, and this I trust. [East Side!]
I'm from where we get drunk and wild blunted [Harlem!]
This is Harlem, y'all, aka the Wild Hundreds!
[B-B-Brraaat]

[Outro]
J-eah!
DipSet, you know what it is. Capo status!
How real is...that? G's up!
[laugh] You heard me! East Side!
It's your boy, Jones. Dipset [That's right]
New York's rider man, tri-state bandit [Capo!]
50 State Rebels, you know what it is
My slogan; "Fuck a button up, I'm never shuttin' up." [Til the wheels fall off!]
Government'll never stop me, ya herd!
Dipset, Killa, holla at me
Juelz Santana, Freeky Zeeky, they can't stop em
Hell Rell come home, free Shiek Ali [G-G-G]
You know what it is, all my soilders behind the G-wall, keep your head up and your eyes open [G-Jo-G]
I'll see you when you get out here. Til then?
Inhale, exhale, shakin' nuts, nigga, no homo
I'm outta this biya-ya-itch
G's up. East Side!
How G is this....gangsta
