Oh, yeah
Da, da, da, da, da (Bad boy)
Oh, Yeah (come on)

(Verse 1:)
Boy I trust you and all
But i've been here before you
You remind me of pain
But i can't ignore you

After i met you boy
I try my best not the think of you
Such a silly game to play
To eventually just lose to you

(Bridge:)
Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Dance on my left and things feel so right
Hold you boy with all of my might
Just don't let you slip away
I pour my heart out to you from now to daylight
For you could know hurting you was never my right
I'm trying to see what's in the cards for tonight
Boy accept this as my plea...

(Chorus:)
I love you
I love you
I love you (Hey, hey)
So don't break my heart (Repeat 1x)

(Verse 2:)
I felt a weight lift from my chest
Now that you know just how i feel
I held it in for far to long
I couldn't tell if this was real

I never thought I'd understand
How it feels to be hurt and to love again (Oh, no, no)
You made it possible for me
That's why I'll give you anything

(Bridge:)
Can I get another chance to hold you tonight

Dance on my left and things feels o life
Hold you boy with all of my might
And almost let you slip it away
I poured my heart out to you from now to daylight
So you can know hurting you was never my right
I'm trying to see what's in the cards for tonight
Boy accept this as my plea...

(Chorus:)
I love you
I love you
I love you (Hey, hey)
So don't break my heart (repeat 1x)

(Verse 3:)
Just like the stars in the sky
You brought light to my life
That's why i love you
Just don't break my heart

Without you by my side
I was wasting my time
But now I love you
Just don't break my heart

(Chorus:)
I love you
I love you
I love you (Hey, hey)
So don't break my heart (repeat 1x)

(Verse 3:)
Just like the stars in the sky
You brought light to my life
That's why I love you
Just don't break my heart

Without you by my side
I was wasting my time
But now I love you
Just don't break my heart

(Music fades)
