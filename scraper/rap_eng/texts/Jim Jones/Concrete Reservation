Funky smell in the midnight air
Woman crying 'cause her child got lost somewhere
Neighbors upstairs had a fight
They had a fight
'Cause someone's old lady stayed out too late last night
Hey!

[Chorus]
Here (in the ghetto) it's just a bad situation
Call it what you wanna, it's just a concrete reservation
Here (in the ghetto) it's just a bad situation
Call it what you wanna, it's just a concrete reservation

At night I can't hardly sleep, y'all
There's always a baby crying that lives across the hall
Last night they had a fire on the fifteenth floor
On the fifteenth floor
The whole family died, 'cause they didn't have no back door

[Chorus]
Here (in the ghetto) it's just a bad situation
Call it what you wanna, it's just a concrete reservation
Here (in the ghetto) it's just a bad situation
Call it what you wanna, it's just a concrete reservation

Here (in the ghetto) it's just a bad situation
Call it what you wanna, it's just a concrete reservation
