[Intro: K$upreme]
Monsta's gon' tear it up
Ooh, Dipset

[Verse 1: K$upreme]
Came in this bitch, I'm with Jimmy
Came in this bitch with a fifty
Came in this bitch with a semi
Iknow these niggas against me
This niggas really be frenemies
Don't fuck with these niggas they envy me
Leadin' the game, I'm the MVP
Smokin' on gas and I'm sippin' lean

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
[?] in the buildin' with K
We ran in the buildin' with K's
I got some killers for pay
I was just dealin' the yay
Hand-offs goin' back and forth
Cook it up if the cracker soft
Lil pocket rocket, that'll back 'em off
I just had a bad bitch and backed the Porsche

[Verse 3: K$upreme]
Off of the lean I feel numb
Get in your bitch and go dumb
Eatin' on steaks, I was just eatin' crumbs
Smoke a big backwood, gelato in my lungs
My shooter got big guns, hundred round drums
Fuck on your bitch then I nut on her tongue
Walk inside Louis and I blew ten, that was for fun

[Verse 4: Jim Jones]
I get in the pussy, go ape
My young niggas go Bape
My fly niggas do Givenchy shit
Summertime, I'm on winter shit
Cool nigga and my neck is ice
Private jet, that's just the flight
While you on the jet then I'm all ears
Still shootin' shots like Paul Pierce
Shit, news drop when the phone's near
Let me know if a mall's near
So I cop some 1's like fall pair, uh

[Verse 5: K$upreme]
New Ricky (Owens), I got a Glock with a dicky
I like my bitch thick, I'm so picky
My hundreds is bangin' crip like they is Nipsey
But I hang with the slimes in the swamps
Ride with the MAC and a pump, yeah
Ride with the Glock, don't get dumped
No one-on-one's, bitch, don't get jumped

[Verse 6: Jim Jones]
His family will cry at the wake
Pull up to that bitch in the Wraith
You know we gon' boom at the opps
I got a broom and a mop
I got the chicken
If I drop the bag, then you come up missin'
See me in face
Don't do no phones, them people do listen
Y'all niggas better chill
You talkin' money, bet a mil
You pack guns never kill
You never have never will
