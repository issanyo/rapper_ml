[Jim Jones]
Its nobody gods I'm puffing marley ducking squalie's cars

On the corner where cotchies died now lets go to n.y. and love it
But out on the west I don't step out of my vest unless doggs I'm about to have sex
Wherever I go
You know my wrist stay naughty
No bitch can afford me

And the places I go we making the dough

So where frequent flyers we cheat on flyers so please be quite

[Hook]

[Juelz Santana]
I'm so built for doing this here

Keep a thick chick with me
Taggin along fat ass and thong attached to my arm
I might grab it I might smack it tell her to tag it along mack and then we gone
You already know

[Jim Jones]
Wherever I go
You see the cop over behind him fronting rocking them diamonds
Glocking my lining till I spot me a diamond
Cause a bitch into fucking
Talked her lips into sucking coughing up shit when I'm puffing
Man I'm talking like shit ain't nothing popping cooks of chris and I'm stunting
I plays the bar for the night
But shit I got to start me fight
I said excuse me doggs pardon these Nikes (and Ones nigga)

[Hook]
