The things I tell my pillow
Are things I wish you could hear
They are the plans we made together
When we were sincere

The dreams we shared together
Those moments I held you near
They are the things I tell my pillow
In between each tear

Now you're gone
And I'm alone
If I knew what I did wrong
I'd begin to make amends to find your love again

I'm lonesome to hold you near me
I promise to make things right
These are the things
I tell my pillow
Every lonely night

I'm lonesome to hold you near me
I promise to make things right
These are the things
I tell my pillow
Every lonely night

I'm lonesome to hold you near me
I promise to make things right
These are the things
I tell my pillow
Every lonely night

These are the things
I tell my pillow
Every lonely night
These are the things
I tell my pillow
Every lonely night
