[Intro: Jim Jones]
Jones!
We born to die (For real)
So I get high just like I'm born to fly (To the moon)
I'm in the court with marijuana eyes (Sorry judge}
We hit the clubs until the morning rise (Cause of last night)
Cause day 'n' nite (Day 'n' nite))
We run the streets hope I don't pay that price (Pray for me)
They got the nerve to tell me press my brakes (What)
And if I do then how will rent get paid, paid
So now I'm thinkin that (What's your thought)
Two hundred stacks what would it bring me back (Thinkin to flip)
Especially now that recessions here (It's hard out here)
My only answers to my questions is, is (Let me figure out)
Ok now here's a thought (One more thought)
Streets is a marriage that you can't divorce
Life is a bitch but I think I fell in love (I love that bitch)
So I treat the game just like I'm sellin drugs, drugs
[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite
Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite
[Verse Two: Kid Cudi]
Day 'n' nite...
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace and see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play...play..
Now look at this...
Madness to magnets keeps attractin me, me
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first, but surely finish last...last...
[Hook: Kid Cudi]

[Verse Three: Kid Cudi]
Hold the phone, the lonely stoner Mr. solo dolo
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep, a silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
[Hook: Kid Cudi]

[Verse Four: Kid Cudi]
Slow mo, when the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive, though he is feelin blue
The sun is shinnin man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
