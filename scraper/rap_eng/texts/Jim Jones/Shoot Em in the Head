[Intro:]
Yeah
Oh you feel it dawg
Hell no, shit me neither
I heard he police
Shit what you want to do
Talking about he want a brick
Fuck n*gga
Three way (fuck)

[Verse 1:]
Shoot em in the head then
Too many police n*ggas playing the fair game
N*ggas kicking your dough and taking their thing
Institutional style n*gga on the airplane shit
Fuckin where the bread at
In my circle of n*ggas where all my spread at
Well at 1800 call it a hair crack
I got your bitch on my dick and you really hatin’ that
I ain’t with the face shit
One of the realest mother fuckers out of the day bitch
What a n*gga doing on a mother fucking spaceship
You gotta hate it when a mother fucking face twist
Cuz I dirty mind on stereo
Play these n*ggas like a Nintendo
Take a penalty like I was Timbo
And if you ain’t getting money what you in for
Somebody let the double in
Just trying to roll my weed and hit the metal sin
Now I see these n*ggas I got my metal in
I’m bout to pop these n*ggas up in a double in

[Pre-Chorus:]
Kill the head and the body dead [x3]
Fuck, shoot em in the head then
Kill the head and the body dead [x3]
Fuck, shoot em in the head then

[Chorus:]
I got a bullet for my n*gga killer
I gotta keep the peace for all you fuck n*ggas
I might show my piece but I won’t fuck witcha
In the day we meet I gotta fuck witcha
N*gga, I got a bullet for my n*gga killer
I gotta keep the peace for all you fuck n*ggas
I might show my piece but I won’t fuck witcha
In the day we meet I gotta fuck witcha, n*gga

[Verse 2:]
I got a quarter mill for my n*gga shooter
Smoke a n*gga like I hit the hookah
What I need is the line and the drop and
I pull up on the n*gga hunned rounds go pop (boom boom boom)
Run up in this spot and everybody dead
If I hit him in the head then the body dead
Would have shot em all in his head
Then n*gga tried to run and shot him in his leg
I’m a cold n*gger with a lot of bread
So I keep my toast with a lot of spread shit
Let the dealer Mazarati red
N*gga we the mob now cuz Gotti dead
N*gga Joe took her cuz she probably fed
If she don’t call back she’s probably dead
Cuz I kill the bitch like a body bag
And then I told the bitch she need to holla back
I’m a rich n*gga with a bunch of cars
Free my n*ggas are stuck in the bars
Until you free my n*ggas I’m going fucking hard
I mean free my n*ggas I’m praying up to God

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Chorus]
