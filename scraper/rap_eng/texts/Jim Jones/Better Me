[Jim Speaking]
Love is a funny thing, you gotta watch what chu ask for, you could catch it

[(Intro) Chorus] I'm your moon, you're my star
You're my sun, I'm you're sky
You shine right through those cloudy days
You drive all my pain away;

[Verse 1] If you the sun, then I'm the rain
People say opposites attract, (true)
But really girl we like one in the same
How opposite is that? (you crazy)
And, there's no comparison
Or, No one to compare you to, (who)
Cuz, no one gets near to you, (never)
At night time I say a prayer for you
When I'm With my son, and my moms, and my sisters too
I'm, love sick like its just the flu
So, just for that I'm forever in-debted
Get Chanel bags girl, get whatever, don't sweat it, (cop that)
My better half make a better me, (what)
What's done in the past is dead to me
I'm only looking at what's ahead of me, (Clear) If you could see my thoughts, (uh) Some say, "Louise and George"
Others say, "Claire and Cliff”, But I say Bonnie and Clyde, (Clyde) Everybody know that my mami'll ride
Till the wheels fall off and the sun collide
The ups and the downs
The richer or poorer, What the fuck is rich
Without a Mrs. to adore?

[(Full) Chorus:]
I’m your, moon you’re my star, you're my sun, I'm you're sky
You shine right through those cloudy days
You drive all my pain away;
Make you smile, when you frown
Pick you up, when you're down
You're the reason, can't you see?
The reason I'm a, Better Me;

[Bridge]
With a little bit of love and a little bit of trust
And a little bit of faith
We'll be alright
Just as long as you love me girl
And stay by my side
You're the air that I breathe
Girl you make me so complete
You're my total opposite
Bringin' out the best in me;

[(Full) Chorus]
I'm your moon, you're my star
You're my sun, I'm you're sky
You shine right through those cloudy days
You drive all my pain away;
Make you smile, when you frown
Pick you up, when you're down
You're the reason, can't you see?
The reason I'm a, Better Me
