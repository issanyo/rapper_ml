Hey girls gather around
Because of what I am putting down
Oh baby I'm your handyman

I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule
I'm handy with the love and I'm not no fool
I fix broken hearts
I know I really can

If your broken heart needs repair
I am the man to see
I'll whisper sweet things
You'll tell all your friends
And they'll come running to me

Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy twenty-four hours a day
I fix broken hearts
I know I really can

If your broken heart needs repair
I am the man to see
I'll whisper sweet things
You'll tell all your friends
And they'll come running to me

Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy twenty-four hours a day
I fix broken hearts
I know I really can
