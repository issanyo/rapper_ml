[Chorus:] (x2)
Oopsy daisy daddy went and threw me up
And he let me hit the ground
I'm a gangster
I'm a bad man runnin wild
In the heart of these streets
I got plenty love from niggas who can understand
I'm a full grown man
But I love who I love
And keep all my money right
That's a byrdgang plan

[Verse 1:]
Yeah I talk a little shit
I lost money gambling dice
Step back and let it spark a little bit
I'm a shark a little bit
Take a visit to the pen and see my homie
T-fizzy and we talk a little bit
I done lost a little bit
But I hate to let these other niggas breathe
So at night time i floss a little bit
And I toss a little bit
I'm used to tellin niggas the price
Now i tell em it cost a little bit
I'm a boss a little bit
But trust me i swing a big stick around the hood like laccrosse a little bit
And I cry a little bit
But only when my niggas fail
Cause i like to see em try a little bit
Get em high a little bit
And teach em how to wash up
Currency maybe we can fly a little bit
So I give a little bit
And I got one request for the cops
Let a motherfucker live a little bit

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Okay we all make mistakes
But some we make twice
Some get us cased up
Some will take your life
Some of us hardheaded
Some take advice
Some play it safe
Some shake the dice
Some fly standby
Some make the flights
Stuntin in my hood
Some don't make the night
You know I love my town but something ain't right
(Something ain't right?)
Yeah something ain't right
If he's the heart of the city
Why we all need a bypass
It's just my thoughts as they bypass
It's move porchses when they fly pass
Watch how you talk cause the lines tapped
And the courts will keep your mind trapped
Hit the clear pool tryn'a change the climax
We fuck whores till they climax
And let the time stack
We in two zones
And when i land i need a new phone

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Poppin nights wasn't rolling stone
So I guess that's why I roll with chrome
And I can turn the jungle to my home
And I'm well known in the streets
Been on (?) with my heat
That nigga so sweet
Knock him off if he innocent
Be the witness that remember shit
We show him torture if he tattles
We shoot shots that will
Crack his sales
Cause i ain't tryn'a scream
'Crack my sales'
And I still got packs for sale
Even though they tryn'a pack the jails
Have a nigga blowin stacks on bail
And the squalie still on my tail
Wanna see a nigga dead kneel
But I'll never squeal
And I'm still mobbin
I gotta break bread with the goonies cause the little homies still starving
So fuck patience or waiting for better looks
I'm out sly foxxin I'm gettin it with the crooks

[Repeat Chorus:] (2x)
