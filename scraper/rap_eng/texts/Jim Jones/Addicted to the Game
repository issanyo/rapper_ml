[Intro]
I’m addicted to the game
I’m addicted to the game
I’m addicted
I’m addicted to the game

[Verse 1]
Ready on beyond a reasonable doubt
We’re still buying v’s every season they out
Shimmy knew a plug catch a keys in the trout
To protect the guilty names I be leaving them out
This is one one key it’ll get you eighty g’s in the south
If you worry down for a week without leaving the house
But junk on bendos we were setting up shop at every trip we were Staying at
So you can cop that
We talking powder give me a stove and let me rock that
Now I be doing shows in different states my n*gga be about that
Shit I’m comfortable where my top at what n*ggas did to get comfortable you gotta watch that
I’m trying to find my direction
Watch these silly hoes try to climb up in my section
Look up in the mirror I saw crown up in my reflection
Strow is kept it home she just did nine in the correction

[Hook]
Life is all I know and I cannot pretend
I have tried so hard to hear myself away
But everyone is calling out my name

[Verse 2]
I’m from a different era a different time a different mind frame
I’m from the time there were lines with a dime and a cane
Way before the dotted I would sign my name
The shit is spilt over like the time I’m sipping wine in Spain
More like dancing on my diamond chain
Smoking good cause I got to keep my mind sustain
I sold crack to pregnant woman so how much change
Nelly said he full of pain in his ghetto everytime it rain
I seen dope feens tap they arm trying to find a vein
Me I’m popping rolls trying to drown the pain
But the story so compelling how the rap game saved us from the war that we was selling
Some chose to abide by the law and start telling
But my n*ggas studied the law they smart fellas

[Hook]
Feel it in my heart in my soul again
This life is all I know and I cannot pretend
I have tried so hard to keep myself away
But every voice is calling out my name
I’m addicted to the game
I’m addicted to the game
I’m addicted to the game
Addicted to the game

[Outro]
Feel it in my heart and my soul again
This is the most addicting thing that probably ever existed in the world
It will make you a slave
Step seven we humbly asked our higher power to remove our Short comings
