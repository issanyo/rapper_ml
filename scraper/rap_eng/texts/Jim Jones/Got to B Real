[Intro: Jim Jones (Alexza)]
Ayo, shit, we all get caught up
Sometimes we think money, money solves all the problems
(Ooh ahhh) huh (yeah, yeah)
Time is more valuable (oohh, nice things, nice things yeah)
We deserve nice shit (but damn, yeah, yeah, ahhh)

[Verse 1: Alexza (Jim Jones)]
Nice things come a dime a dozen (you a dime though)
You think you special, then all of a sudden
Yeah, it's anywhere and everywhere (everywhere)
I know you came, know I care (know I care)
You the one I needed all a sudden
Better come find me, now it's sudden (I'm here)
Every lean on you, try, now I'm fronting
Baby ain't you tired of all this running?
(Ain't you tired of running, yet?)

[Chorus: Alexza (Jim Jones)]
You the one on my mind (shit)
You the one I find time for
You the one I don't mind (you know I go hard for you)
You the one I won't find no more
You the one who come back like you never left, wooahhh (yeah)
You the one who come back like you never left, sooo
(I, I know it's hard)
It's got to be real
It's got to be real
(Shit, know it's real, baby)
It's got to be real
It's got to be real (it's me and you)
I let you do your thing, I been waiting for a minute
(I been waiting for you)
Sooo, I was hoping you'd come back for the winter
(Summer's over, baby) wooahhh

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Now you got me rapping my heart out (listen in)
'Cause it almost feels like somebody's snatching my heart out
As I'm, backing the car out, just smoking my brain up
Tryna stay focused, praying, hoping this ain't us
It was the, Range trucks and the Chanel pocket books (I was fucked up)
I was way too worried 'bout you having the hottest look (stupid)
When I should've been worried about spending quality time
But I figured a new watch could probably, buy me some time
But um (you like the watch, right?)
This is not material love (no)
I will kill for you, girl, this is serial love (you know I'm pulling up)
Shit, look at us now going through relationship woes (fuck)
With these petty ass vibes from these hating ass hoes
And I (fuck them bitches)

[Chorus: Alexza (Jim Jones)]
You the one on my mind
You the one I find time for (I find time for you)
You the one I don't mind (I don't mind at all)
You the one I won't find no more
You the one who come back like you never left, wooahhh
(I know it's hard)
You the one who come back like you never left, sooo
It's got to be real
It's got to be real
(This the realest shit I ever wrote)
It's got to be real
It's got to be real (ain't nobody else I need)
I let you do your thing, I been waiting for a minute
(I been waiting for you)
Sooo, I was hoping you'd come back for the winter
(Summer's over, Chris') wooahhh

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
It got us in a peculiar position (twisted love)
You ain't said nothing wrong, I gotta feel your position (I feel you though)
Let me talk, let me talk, let me get a few letters in
You said it the first time, you just repeat what you said again
On how, my attitude done became the worst part of me (I know)
Certain situations I admit I react horribly (it's hard)
You got Ghost like Swayze without the pottery (where you went?)
But, a heart can't live without it's artery (I need you though)
So, you know I chase you like you never left (I'm coming)
But, we just backtrack through every step
Damn, it really feels like you never left
If we kill each other we just end up on heaven's steps
(You hear me, Chris'?)

[Chorus: Alexza (Jim Jones)]
You the one on my mind (huh)
You the one I find time for (you you the one I find time for)
You the one I don't mind (I don't mind at all)
You the one I won't find no more
You the one who come back like you never left, wooahhh
(Just come back, fuck it Chris')
You the one who come back like you never left (uhh), sooo
It's got to be real
It's got to be real
(You the realest, you know that)
It's got to be real
It's got to be real
(They don't make 'em realer than us)
I let you do your thing, I been waiting for a minute
(I been waiting patiently)
Sooo, I was hoping you'd come back for the winter
(Summer's over, baby) wooaahhh

[Outro: Alexza]
Nice things, nice things yeah
Ohhh, yeah
