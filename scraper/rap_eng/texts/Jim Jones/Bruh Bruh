[Intro]
Como estas gatosito putos?
Yo tengo 2 comidos latinas

[Verse 1: Will Roush]
One time like uh
You think you know 'bout me bruh bruh?
Oh they don't know 'bout me bruh bruh
You ain't my enemy bruh bruh
You think but you can't see bruh bruh
Hopped out the Phantom man, it's all black
Told the motherfucking hater "Hold my ballsack"
But it's way to heavy and you just can't lift it
Got a shoutout to God because ya boy be gifted
I be whippin' that work on the PJ
JetSmarter membership on replay
Sitting courtside up at the west, it's Mr. Dunk Show
So I can learn about these bitches and still eat nachos

[Chorus]
Uh, you think you know 'bout me bruh bruh?
Oh they don't know 'bout me bruh bruh
You ain't my enemy bruh bruh
You think but you can't see bruh bruh
Bruh bruh (bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh)
Bruh bruh (bruh, bruh, bruh)

Uh, you think you know 'bout me bruh bruh?
Oh they don't know 'bout me bruh bruh
You ain't my enemy bruh bruh
[Jones!]
You think but you can't see bruh bruh

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Yuh bruh
I told 'em free my dogs (true)
They put the bounty on 'em
In the county, that's a hood now, it's a G reward
I was at the dealer, had 'em feelin' 200 G's a car (G)
So I drop the top, too much pollution
No, I can't see the stars (shit)
Got big guns with scopes on 'em
You can see for Mars (trash)
So I fucked the bitch for like thirty minutes now I'm breathin' hard
She had a fat ass, good red bottom, double-D the bra, shit (ooh, ooh)
I'm a dope boy, dope boy, smoke weed cigars, nigga

[Chorus]
Uh, you think you know 'bout me bruh bruh?
Oh they don't know 'bout me bruh bruh
You ain't my enemy bruh bruh
You think but you can't see bruh bruh

[Verse 3: Will Roush]
Big Will in this bitch but they call me Dub (sub)
I be Upscale Vandal when I hit the club
Holla back baby if you really think you know me
If you got big titties then I hope you show me!
What's up, what's up you say "what's up" and then you know what's up
What's up? That's too many what's up so you know what's up (Look it up)

I be back up in this, you think I'm hot
We be harder than cinderblock
I got chains and you think they rock
One more time and you think like "what?"

[Outro]
Uh, you think you know 'bout me bruh bruh?
Oh they don't know 'bout me bruh bruh
You ain't my enemy bruh bruh
You think but you can't see bruh bruh
Bruh bruh (bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh)
Bruh bruh (bruh, bruh, bruh)
