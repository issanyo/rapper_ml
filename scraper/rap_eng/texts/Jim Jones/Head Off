[Chorus: Lil Durk]
If we knock the head off, the body fall deep
I just popped a Xanax, help me fall asleep
Look at you crazy, like how you cross me
Years of my life, what the streets cause me
Down in Baltimor, I got some killers in New Yourk that drive to Baltimor
And if they payed to kill, they gon slide for it
And I love my savages, we in the city making all the noise

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Jones!
Arm, leg, then we bustin the head
New Yourk niggas, we hustle for bread
My man got shot, and he got cuffed to the bed
I watched his mom pray for him, while she was touching his head
Lord is my witniss, so I can only spit the truth
Like he did with his gun, and he didn't get to shoot
Top off all Summer, like he didn't get the roof
We was young, smoking Reefer, blowing smoke out the roof
Now we on plains, with the Mack like a laptop
Tryna catch my balance and terbulance when we slap box
Still cop them pretty forin cars from them Crack blocks
Give my niggas inspiration, cause they still trap locked

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
If we knock the head off, the body fall deep
I just popped a Xanax, help me fall asleep
Look at you crazy, like how you cross me
Years of my life, what the streets cause me
Down in Baltimor, I got some killers in New Yourk that drive to Baltimor
And if they payed to kill, they gon slide for it
And I love my savages, we in the city making all the noise

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
We got all the cars, you know we bust down all the Audomers
You can catch us in the Raith, you see all the stars
We flying through your town, we making all the noise
Nigga, call the boys
I'm from a town that kill you dead on the spot
Know a couple druglords that turned to federal cops
Been in the kitchen when the Coke was ready to rock
Know what to say, hoped the run was never ready to stop
That's my favorite, plus these ngiggas I was raised with
Took them to buy roes, and never even apraized it
Who am I, cause I been accused of the same shit
These bitches and the jewelry, I made it

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
If we knock the head off, the body fall deep
I just popped a Xanax, help me fall asleep
Look at you crazy, like how you cross me
Years of my life, what the streets cause me
Down in Baltimor, I got some killers in New Yourk that drive to Baltimor
And if they payed to kill, they gon slide for it
And I love my savages, we in the city making all the noise
