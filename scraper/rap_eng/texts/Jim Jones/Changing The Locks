Verse 1 Jim Jones:
And i know our reltionship i neglekted
So im hopin this apology you'll accept it
And i know up in ya mind you feel disrepekted
Just think about the time that you invested
But somewhere along the line we got diskonnekted
And you tell me i was wrong so i stand korrekted
You ain't up here in the mall girl i kant accept it
And so a woman skorned is wat this man was left wit
I got her feelin like no otha option
Back against the wall love got ha boxed in
Fightin wit a hard love got ha boxin
And all those bruises on ha soul like she was fightin Hopkins

Chorus Ashanti:
See i dont want to love you anymore
And i dont want to touch you anymore
Im changin all tha locks thats on this door
So gone so goooone
I used to give you every piece of me
Until you fucked around and lost that key
I used to really love you now i think nothin of you
You ain't gotta kum back no more kuz im goone

Verse 2 Ashanit:
See i was wit you
I split it wit you
I lived it wit you
Did it even when i didn't wanna do it just to let you know i was different from the rest put an "s on my chest
To relieve all your stress when i gave you my best
You betrayed what was left
And i didn't understand now im leaving
Im so gone movin on
And i ain't gotta take ya shit no more

Chorus

Nope i dont think nothin of you
Aye ayyyyyeeee aye
Said i dont wanna love
And i dont wanna touch you
Nope i dont think nothin of you
Yeah ayyyyeeee wooooaaaahhhh
Mmmm mmmmmmmmm nooooooo *fades out*
