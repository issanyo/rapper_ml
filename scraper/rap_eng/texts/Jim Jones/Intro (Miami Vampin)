[Verse:]
Fab life, what’s my confirmation number?
Feezy wad up? From New York to Miami
We got one way. Huh, first class right?
Work from Miami [words unclear here]
First position for me to be in
Was the worst from the ship that I was seeing
The aisles on the rod was shaky like Korean
The make of the ride itself was European
Can make up these lies myself  no reason
Pick up the flattest self when it was freezing
Might be bogus for the happiest human being
Big head, drunk pissy from the hole she was peeing
Sub Miami club in the bathroom stall
Pimp some hoes, damn cash fooled ya’ll
Blast two shows like Sock Passy
Sun up, sun down, just another hot hot day
Who that nigga bringing cases from New York to Miami
First nigga bring me to the port of Miami
Pay that nigga twenty in the court of Miami
When a nigga got locked, man I thought about his family
Needs to take his time when he’s going for the most part
Playing with them keys, man I should have called a mosser
Caught sixty fishes and got jammed by the coast guard
He be writing case from Miami on a postcard
(Think about that)
This is my Miami history, who shot Shory, still a mystery
Same old telling when they try to stab Jack
That nigga walked away like he had a scratch
As the world turn, heard the phantom got burn, and a couple a bridges
Niggas gonna beef, don't come across the bridge
That’s another story, heard another rapper got robbed of his Ferrari
OG got shot cause he was clapping at the phase
Shouts to the Haitians with them nappy ass dreads
What about Detroit with the tech and the drop
Building house, getting off, Rolex no chat
Bringing up the date, got the dirty on me
Standing on the couch but the handle broken now
Getting drunk in the club, fucking with Feezy
Top in the night time when it get breezy
Just cash money, yeah I’m the millionaire
Still with the beef, but the killers be mad
Leaving out the club with a half full bottle
Trying to kick game to this half fast model
As God as my witness to the buck on the cause
Bringing in two bitches, get some dog three the hallway
Home of the palm trees, bitches in the speed boats
Niggas getting rich off the traffic in the get go
