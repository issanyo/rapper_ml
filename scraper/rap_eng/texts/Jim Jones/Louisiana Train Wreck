Down by the riverside the corn is creaking
The moon's on high
Bodies broken
A house on fire
Down by the riverside

I hang my head and tears I start to cry
I see the river
The river's wide
A mile of moonlight
So much to hide
I see the faces
I get the news
I see the water
I read the shoes, they were down by the riverside
The corn is creaking
The moon's on high
Bodies broken
A house on fire
Down by the riverside

Now me and you, we were born to disagree
Out on the highway, it's a mess of a night
Tank car burning with a terrible light
Be the boss
Look here son
You go far
You be the one down by the riverside
The corn is creaking
The moon's on high
Bodies broken
A house on fire
Down by the riverside

Of all the dreams that will haunt the awful black
I see the steamboat- golden stacks!
Jump the river
Won't go back
Face to face
Me and you
Then there's one
And I'm going, too, down by the riverside
The corn is creaking
The moon's on high
Bodies broken
A house on fire
Down by the riverside
