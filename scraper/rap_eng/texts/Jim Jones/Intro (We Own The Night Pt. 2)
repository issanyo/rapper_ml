[Chorus: Sen City]
Gettin this pack money, we never die
Shoot at me, I let m lie
These hoes all up on me, never mind
Bitches hit me before I'm free
Hit me before I'm free

[Verse 1: Mel Matrix]
Summertime's here, I still got this hammer on me
Sun up to sundown, I'm just tryna get it, homie
Tellin me it's love around here, I don't feel it, homie
Ain't no handouts here, I took it, homie
Real soldier, man, I wouldn't change nothing
I wouldn't change to the gun
Wouldn't change nothin

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
A couple hittas got caged up, I guess it's been a long year
Sellin drugs will get you cakes up, it can also get you long years
A ghetto nigga, in some forin whips
The coke so hard, man, it's hard to deel
And he took 300 K, put it in lardge pails
And it's crazy, when Stick and Kiss start to kill
Things different, get with the times
Happen to the hustle, nigga on the grind
Started as a pumper, ended as a tenint
Takin trips in the ten, got the bitch to get the rent in
Niggas on the bloc, gettin chaced by the Ds
Niggas on the run, gettin fake ID
Jimmy buy a car, just to race IVs
This a metaphor for life, no break, just speed
And you can still hit me up, for a face to face
I let the feend cook the brick up, and he can taste the base
I used to have 2 shifts between A and A
And I was at the BBQ, bitch, paper plates
This one for my niggas still pushin, stacks is loyal, money case you ever hit the book end
Stunt on these niggas, every time you get the feeling
Don't forget to pray, every time you hit the ceeling

[Chorus: Sen City]
Gettin this pack money, we never die
Shoot at me, I let m lie
These hoes all up on me, never mind
Bitches hit me before I'm free
Hit me before I'm free

[Verse 3: Trav]
Authentic nigga, no fraud
Black and blue his eyes, call him Snoop Dogg
I'm shootin out the window, what the Coope cost
Talkin slick, boy, get your head popped
I'll have the shooters on your front porch
To shoot a nigga off his high horse
The jeap pass get revoked, niggas be swarmin on me, like I'm part of a culte
And unlike you, I'm smart
Ride around with yello tape, and I'm toppin the charts
And like drugs, I got a hundred rounds
Imma gun a nigga down, that's all the pounds

[Chorus: Sen City]
Gettin this pack money, we never die
Shoot at me, I let m lie
These hoes all up on me, never mind
Bitches hit me before I'm free
Hit me before I'm free
