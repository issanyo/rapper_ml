[Verse One: Jim Jones]
I'm blowin smoke with my top back (UH!)

Can't front I was watchin where the cops at
The sun is out my wrist rocked up (Ew!)
I miss all my niggas locked up
So I roll a blunt for the good times (Right)
We was just in the slums like "Good Times" (JJ!!!)
Keep a bad bitch like Wilona
Me and Doe was doin henny's and coronas (Eight stacks!!!)
Hustle hard gettin money hustle hard they was on us (Taft!!!)
And we still poor liquor for the goners (Light!!!)
We blow smoke like we blow money (For real!!!)

[Verse Two: Jim Jones:
Spend a couple G's on my bitch's purse (A few stacks)
Lookin at the screen as I hit reverse (No rims)
Lightin up backin out of Neiman's (Some shoppin)
My jewelry loud like it's screamin (BOW!!!)
And when the last time you seen him? (Heh Heh)
Shootin past somethin fast european (That's regular)
Capital B on the gear shifter
No ceilin from the breeze let the air hit ya (You feel that?)
And God bless like a Prayer scripture (Amen)
Lord knows tryin to make it up there with ya (For real)
Until then I light one up
And stay strapped 'case a nigga might run up (I'm watchin)
I'm still watched by rap police
They still search me in the club like I'm strapped with heat (Damn!)
They might catch me parked out on backstreets
I might be diggin out your broad in the backseat (FUCKER!!!!)

[Hook: Rell]

[Verse Three: Jim Jones]
Uh! Spike the Coupe with the tee top (Mean)
She had the Louis booster when her knees stopped (Mean)
Thirty grand in my jean pocket (Light change)
Then rehab now we need detox (UH!)
Then Vegas white tee and a mean watch (Where to?)
Then hit L.A. like I seen 'Pac (UH!)
I blow smoke like I'm George Burns
See it comin out the window when the Porche turns (Damn)
U-turn on Rodeo (And!) Juelz do his cars all mayo (Santana)
We scooped the fly broads all day though (For real)
Pop six bottles more on the way though (No sparkles)
We all know when the night end (Uh huh)
So we'll burn another blunt the life end (Right)
And I'm slidin with a light skin (Right)
I peeled off fly car with some nice rims (Right)

[Hook: Rell]
