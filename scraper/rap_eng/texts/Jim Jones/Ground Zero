[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Yeah
Y'all know what this is we back at it (uh huh)
Come on (uhh, yeah, yeah)
It's that 9-11 music right here man
We in the building man
Welcome to ground zero everybody
Juelz Santana
Dipset (Hell Rell)

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Yo, yo I speak pain, I spit power, talk courage, breathe flowers
Follow me through the debri of these towers
The rain, the sleet, the street showers
Don't get caught up when the street showers
When the guns rain, the clips pour
The soldiers grip fours, then begin war
Come on, it's Santana the Great
Tie 'em up, bandana his face, hammer his face, fucker
I'm trying to get my act together
In the booth now trying to get my rap together
You know, I got the fire to heat the street up
Abuse the track, and beat the beat up, you know
You already know what I'm about homie
I'm young, I'm focused, I'm just coming out homie
You can go by what you hear through word of mouth homie
Or step out of line, Cam betting the house on me (woo!)
No, I ain't stopping yet (yeah)
No, my album ain't done, it ain't dropping yet
I'm in the midst of a bidding war
And we need two mil' more just to move in the door, shit

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it
So line 'em up, shoot 'em down
Do it now
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Line 'em up, shoot 'em down
Do it now
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa, yo
Your girl told you I'm the man, right? (Right?)
Well listen to lover
When I beef, visions are gutter
Kids clapping, kidnappings, heard her missing a brother
I'm hitting your sister, you kissing your mother
This shit'll disgust ya
Underground with people, lethal
Trapped in the desert, surrounded by Eagles (Dipset, girl)
Yeah, I see your bitch is impressed, my kicks is all fresh
This shit on my chest by Mitchell and Ness (jersey)
Got her open, hoping she's not
I'll have her, crack in her tits, coke in her twat
Have her crack up the strip, coke up the block
She get cracked up and hit, keep soap in your sock, mami (mami)
My girls lay up in suites
A half a cake a week, and masturbate like Tweet, Killa
I be popping them Uzis, copping them Coogis
Eyes on the drop real droopy
Mair is Snoopy, look at your hooptie, rocking her rubies
Hop in the hoochie, popping her coochie
Chill while I'm chasing millions
I'm a baller that'll merk you like Jayson Williams (uh huh)
Don't play with villains, vacate the building
Or the apes'll come and rape your children
Yeah, it's a kilo to a milligram
I'm still the man, word to Killa Cam.. Killa

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it
So line 'em up, shoot 'em down
Do it now
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Line 'em up, shoot 'em down
Do it now
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
To all of my cons and crooks, slash that to of my pawns and rooks
For all the charms they took
To my head of security, British the Titan, clicking the fifth, and gripping it tight, goddamn it
Not to mention my bishop and knights, soliciting bricks of the white
Making crucial trips through the night (highways)
And Prince Juelz, I told you ever since Juelz
If them faggots even flinch Juelz (bluuuuatttt)
My dogs gonna 'em alive
Forty-four's depleting, deleting they lives (come on)
And Killa while he's leading the movement
For realer we wouldn't be in this movement
Over him I might kill ya (kill ya)
Be in the tombs, just facing my time
Lawyer on side, outside spoiler on ride
System bumping, bumping Oh Boy in the ride
Oh boy I done slide, shit
He done came got his boy, it's a shame that his boy
Had to flame at a boy, over the name we employ
Which is none other
Than Dipset, for y'all dumb motherfuckers (holla)

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it
So line 'em up, shoot 'em down
Do it now
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Line 'em up, shoot 'em down
Do it now
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it
