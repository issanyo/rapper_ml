[Intro]
Federico still famous in this bitch
Crack music

[Verse 1]
Dope feens get your spoons out
Finna drop a bomb clear a room out
Still got the thick skinned n*gga hook
You can get it soft or you can get it cooked
I can take thirty six o’s bring back two keys if a n*gga hit the stove
Fast take a flick shit let a n*gga pose
Standing on couches when that n*gga hit the roads
I done bought so many cars n*ggas never had
I done brought so many cars so I serve up fat
No bad bitches brought heavy back
And I beat a bitch body like a heavy back
I done take ten grams to an eighth
Shit after that had a n*gga straight
Dipped in my stash hundred grand out the safe
Now they chain three keys hundred grand worth of bass

[Hook]
Two keys of that cocaine
Bake that cookie on that propane
But you don’t like that shorty is like that shorty is like that
If you can get down on it get down on it get down on it

[Verse 2]
The coke is a team you know the asking price
As far as dope the db you know why I’m asking why
Did the grams together then we stash the ride
I am so whatever so just ask me nice
I’ll spark this black beretta in a fur la marcus
Trying to trade the trailblazer for a spur
Memory shy yesterday already a blur
Truthfully think we was better the way we were
Bronx shit f*ck you I don’t know how they touch you
Nickel line like a [?] buckaroo
Don’t let your man gash you see this big as desert I prolly build castle
Soon you feel the doubt we at your room like jewels just Jim and I
Say a Hail Mary God forbid I get caught just have my belt with me

[Hook]
Two keys of that cocaine
Bake that cookie on that propane
But you don’t like that shorty is like that shorty is like that
If you can get down on it get down on it get down on it

[Outro]
Step six we were entirely ready to have our higher power remove all these defects of character
