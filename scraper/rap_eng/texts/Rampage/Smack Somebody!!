[Intro]
Yo Fel, they just - they shoulda let me out the cage Fel
I wanna smack somebody
If you at the bar or you're in the middle of the club it makes you wanna smack somebody
This music's crazy yo
Smack somebody

[Verse 1]
Supreme with adrenaline rush
You can catch me state to state [?] rollin' with bus
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
[?] butchin' the game right now got you foolin' with us
Yo I'm here to set it off I'm 'bout to crush
If you stuntin' so heavy son you could get touched
Over the clutch, now you just hating my guts
Real brute who got goons that'll mess you up
I'm in the club send you best to duck
How many words could wood chuck chuck, a wood chuck chuck
I know you new dudes y'all really suck
Talking all the jazz I ain't backing you up

[Hook]
Get up stand up BUCK BUCK BUCK
If you in my way I wanna smack somebody
Hatin' on your boy you wanna smack somebody
Buying out the bar I wanna smack somebody
Get up stand up BUCK BUCK BUCK
If you in my way I wanna smack somebody
Buying out the bar I wanna smack somebody
Shorties in the middle I wanna smack somebody

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't think y'all be hearing me
Now I'm about to cause a state of emergency
Here come the firetruck
These new dudes is infiltrating, down on their luck
Now what you gonna do Rampage? I'm here to save the day
News flash just a play-by-play
Double banana clips hit you with the AK
They frontin' on the kids tryna take mines away
Word is bond I'm here to get it on
Imma beat your ass up like Chris [?]
In my Everest jacket I'm cool like the Fonz
Give me the loots I want the stocking bonds

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(RUN)
Yo, the party is shut down
Ramp is back up in your town
You know the street motto get down or lay down
New York, New York, I'm here to take the crown
East coast to West coast I'm Brooklyn bound
All you fake ass dudes how you like me now
Yo I'm triple overseas and I'm getting them pounds
Yo I'm hungry for this gwap, can't fool with you clowns
Yo From city to city dog I'm making my rounds
Me and my mans we choking on that dookie brown
You don't really want that drama let me hit you with this pound

[Hook]
