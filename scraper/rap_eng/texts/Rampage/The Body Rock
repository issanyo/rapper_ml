[Intro: Puff Daddy]
See when we get on shit we like to make you
Shake your ass, move your hips
So we gonna do a little something like this
Flipmode, Bad Boy
Check this out

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Tell me how it feels, is it hot is not
Does it drop cash like a slot
Does it stay streeted go pop
Checkin out what Flipmode got, mad hip-hop
Chartin number one, drinks in the sun
Eighty times so we can get sponged, shake it hon
All a brother know is make the hit get the dough
Makin grandmas hit the floor, really though
It's my thang my slang
Rich motherfucker, getting chicks at the Rucker
Bringing my team to the joint wit Allen Iverson running on point
Don't smoke a spliff on the joint
And when you see me they on point
Cause I, I be that nigga wit the million dollar figures
Gettin all up in they bitches
Leavin they pussy in stitches, uh

[Verse 2: Rampage]
Ayo I'm on to the next level
I'm gettin rich, friends said I switch
I got me a bad chick, live up in the hills
Pay my mom's bills, recoup a half a mil
Still got my deal, pop the 700 Benz-o
You never seen, cash money fiend
A lot of cats wanna dream
Pack a shorty black or Phillipian
The way I eat my shrimp with steam
I'm the man with the gangsta lean, what, what
Yo I split your whole spleen if you know what I mean
Call me little rabcash, I get you for your stash
VIP pass, save all the gas, I make it last

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
To my people in the front, if you ready to bump, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the back, if you're not a wack, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the left, if you hot to death, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the right, wanna party tonight, just say
"Don't stop the body rock"

[Verse 3: Mase]
Since Mase refuse to lose, we makes numeral moves
Cause I'm smoother than them dudes and them two thousand dollar shoes
When I move to new Jerus, cause I like the cruise
And my six double-o, blast weed, love the dough
I'm that Goodfell-ay, what the hella they can tell me
Smoke my la la out in LA, who's ready
Juice heavy back in blue Chevy
See Angelettie when a nigga need his chedd-ay
Cause I'm rawer than a broad way
With all A's and platinum
There been many things we touch
Never had a partner so I never had to deduct shit 1.8
And every week I have to re-up
So what, so what

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Ay yo, check out the way me and my niggas always be rippin' shit
The way that I display new flavor and do it so intricate
Pitter and patter, patter and pitter all over this shit
Uh uh uh oh, y'all niggas be yappin' till I be sick of it
Hit you with shit that y'all niggas will never ever forget
Fuckin' with my niggas is like you playin' Russian Roulette
Ooh me and my whole platoon coming soon
Nigga make room, we diesel like a bunch of baboons
Hey yo yo, think you can manage all of my niggas damage?
Tryin' to alter our lavish livin' niggas will turn savage
Yo Flipmode and Bad Boy collabo'
Makin' sure all of you niggas all say, “Hoooo!”

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
To my people in the front, if you ready to bump, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the back, if you're not a wack, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the left, if you hot to death, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the right, wanna party tonight, just say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the front, if you ready to bump, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the back, if you're not a wack, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the left, if you hot to death, say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the right, wanna party tonight, just say
"Don't stop the body rock"
