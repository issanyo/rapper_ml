[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah , see , see nowadays young niggas get a lot of money
See, the fact is that young niggas is self employed now
We living in a time frame where it's all big business
We gotta understand that the young niggas is running big business
This is how we gonna do it , check it out

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Before I sing another song, nigga owe me money
I take away your belonging, no prolonging
Till you give me my money you see me every morning
Got something wicked for all the niggas you calling
Fuck with the stallin, split a nigga till his shit
Leave him a little boy, watch a nigga crawling
Pay my money or you better keep you hall in
Dig up on my get money niggas so keep falling
Cheers making you happy keeping your bubble pouring
Getting money on corners or even if you touring
Older cats used to do the big money scoring
Now they once upon time money niggas who start falling

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Niggas wanna analyze my money like a hawk
Money talks , bullshit walk
A lot of  jealous niggas wanna see me outlined in chalk
Money talks , bullshit walk
Flipmode get money stay holding down the fort
Money talks , bullshit walk
Bless every living soul we got playing the money sport
Money talks , bullshit won't

[Verse 2: Rampage]
I work so hard to get what I got
Number one spot, now I'm hot hot hot
(What? What?), I'm hot hot hot
(What? What?), I'm hot hot hot
Mansion and a yacht, baby blue Nav in the lot
Ice on my hands, I got future plans traveling to distant lands
A hundred G cash, money coming out my ass
First to first class, now I'm a rap nigga living life fast
Keep my enemies close, watch what I gross
That's why I pack my toast, nowadays cats adios, uno, dos, you fall off and you can't come back
You get the hit single, your album sound wack
I give you the leeway, you sound like us
Rock like us, squad like us

CHORUS

[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
Niggas killing me , talking that hope you don't change shit
Hell yeah bitch , from the door I get on some mad gear shit
Type vibe carry studs in my ear shit
Who the fuck type yelling , say crud selling
Ain't said hi in years think I'ma pay they bail and
The '98 people get this right
I be a diamond in the rough like the Arabian Night
Going after ends , only keeping friends
Making their own moves , driving their own Benz
I'm supposed to change you just didn't
Stuck in low income homes blaming Clinton
Bitch like me, gon rock till my last batch of breath
With a grade full of ASCAP checks

CHORUS
Corporate niggas want my money gotta take me to court
A lot of niggas wanna analyze my money like a hawk
Money talks , bullshit walk
A lot of  jealous niggas wanna see me outlined in chalk
Money talks , bullshit walk
Flipmode get money stay holding down the fort
Money talks , bullshit walk
Bless every living soul we got playing the money sport
Money talks , bullshit won't

[Verse 4: Spliff Star]
Spliff doin things , pursuing things , I'm getting money
Chop the hand off the man who try to take from me
My guns go POW from Brook to Moscow
Tear a hole in your biddad for messing with my triddad
Stack ones into lump sums you know the motto
See me on your block with Black Rob throwing bottles
I'ma a hard act to follow, love girls that swallow
So crazy I don't know where I'ma be at tomorrow
Yeah , I heard that money talks so I wrote this commentary
Every move that I make for sure is monetary
Our squad legendary, I'ma bump it till you hear me
Spliff doing love scenes on big screens with Halle Berry

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Ahee hee hee hee hee
See , it's a serious serious serious thing now
Big business , allows young niggas , to comfortably eat
Every motherfucking day now , ahee hee hee hee , aight
Struggle process is now kept to a minimum , ahee hee hee

Couple bags of weed , a motherfucking 500S98CL version
And a couple of bitches , ah ha ha ha ha ha
