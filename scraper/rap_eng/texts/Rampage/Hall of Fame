Intro:
Uh, check it out
No doubt son
Flatbush nigga
Yes yes y'all
It's that Hall Of Fame joint
This how we do it, tell em son

[Rampage]
Aiyo I pack more students, than whole Westberry
I'm legendary, I'm killin mad brothers at the ferry
I brings it all the time, I'm nice with mine
I be damn if I let the next nigga take mine
I'm like a 97 Blazer, I'mma phase ya
That's word on my Goddaughter Salasia
I take it to the street, like the average doopy brother
I'm N.Y.P.D. like New York Undercover
Money's bustin out my socks, from Flatbush to HeadCox
Flipmode iz my Squad, plus we got it on lock
When I roll up on ya set and bust two to your chest
I'mma show brothers thru ya bullet proof vest
I'm the blast master, just like KRS
Yo who wants to test the Boy Scout for real?
Yo i'm that rugged scout that a punch ya in ya grill
In ya grill, in ya grill, I'm in ya mothafuckin grill

Chorus 2X: Rampage
I refuse to lose, I pay dues up in this game
I should be awarded to be in the Hall Of Fame
Rollin with my Squad that's how I maintain
I should be awarded to be in the Hall Of Fame

[Rampage]
I run up in ya jurisdiction, make you catch the Holy Ghost
Worser than the worst Christian
I'm in this rap game now front save that bullshit
Cuz I'm not the one, I'm my moms last son
I fly you like Brisco, eat ya like Nabisco
I rock heads from St. Louis to San Francisco
I turns it out, Boy Scout is a warrior
I stomp thru ya crew, like Hurricane Gloria
Fuck the World Senate, I'm in it to win it
Lyrical Lieutenant, that's my word and you can print it
Take it how ever you want it, yo I did it
This is dedicated to those who bullshitted
They got admitted at Kings County Clinic
Everybody in the worls wants to be a critic
I broke the Y-O route, shit is gettin clout
Flipmode's my Squad, So I'm out

Chorus 2X

Outro:
Boy Scout son
Notorious B.I.G. rest in peace
Flipmode is the Squid-A
Violator, Elektra
DJ Scratch
You know how we do, you know how we do
I should be awarded to be in the Hall of Fame
