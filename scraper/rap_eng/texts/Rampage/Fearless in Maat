[INTRO]
Never known to talk

Always known to spark

Fearless in Maat(2x)

[LEAD VOCAL]

Fearless in Maat

Fearless with my art

I just talked to unc

Told em we the one

Really from the sun

Always rock the ankh

Black as they gone come

Tapped in like a nun

Crazy how I come

Mansion from a crumb

Really on a run

Oj wit the run

Dirty as the glove

Fearless with the art

Fearless in Maat

Told you we the God

Really from above

All we give is love

Fearless in Maat

Harmonize wit God

Started with the thought

Now we own the law

Now the dream is brought

Now this thing is ours

Fearless in Maat (2X)

Tried to throw us off

Caught the play from Thoth

Never took a loss

Never known to talk

Always known to spark

Fearless in  Maat
