I got a 30 clip for them niggas that talk that shit
Dont play no games cause niggas we blow that shit
Everywhere i go my niggas rollin'
Holdin' big guns nigga yeah we blowin'

[Verse 1: JohnnyMayCash]
Niggas mad 'cause of a bitch, but the hoes come and go
I'm a let you niggas know that my niggas damn blow
So from head to toe I let rockets go
Yeah, my head just froze and my watch is cold
Yeah, I'm a keep it 30 'fore you fuck niggas
I don't trust niggas, can't fuck with 'em
These niggas is snakes, these niggas is fake
Get in the way, I'm a get the k, I'm a spread his face
But the game nigga you don't wanna play

[Hook x2: Johnny May Cash]

[Verse 2: Rampage]
I got a 30 clip for the next nigga that talk that shit
And best believe when my niggas shoot they don't miss
Got your mean bitch and your sad bitch on my dick
I kick them out, I don't need them hoes for shit
We flexing, they intelligent, they sexy
If you a man whore then we take them down for them bricks
We ain't got time, we reckless and we get it
If your men die don't ax, we will beat it
If you talk money then best believe I'm with it
I'm a spark up just give me one minute
And your bitch always said that she with it
So I might just go get her a minute

Your bitch going but you already know it
