[Intro: Rampage]
Yeah, Rest in peace Heavy D
Prayers goes out to my brother Eric Sherman
Real hip hop we in the building, we don't die!

[Verse 1: Rampage]
[?] stalker, hat flipped back just like I'm Jimmy Walker
Writer, author, 92' Jetta, just caught the red eye
Haters said I said, I never said that
Now I'm back to the gamin', now I keep flamin'
Callin' my name and, fella keep bangin'
Back to the UK, shout out to the DJ's
No more delay, North Philly EA
Hit the turnpike now I'm back to the BK
Barrels on the bridge through the 95 freeway
Huh, I'm just breathin' on ya'll
Lifestyle is crazy, bouncin' off the wall
The way I work my game I'm like 6 ft tall
The way I break it down I'm like uncut raw
The word in the street, yo, I'm that bull
Break it down, real science, Jolly Green Giant
Steamin' like a iron, roar like a lion
Killin' up the game, all the rules I'm applyin'
This time around I'mma form my alliance
I'm not playin', I'm not jokin'
In and out ya city, yo your boy stay coastin'
20 for the walkthrough, oh ya boy is hostin'
Huh, let me clear my throat
Boxin' so hard, knock you against the ropes, yeah

[Hook x2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo zig zag zig
Gotta make moves, gotta think quick
Gotta move fast, gotta haul ass
Come around here, yo you don't get a pass

[Interlude]
Yeah, Ladies and gentlemen
I'm here to bring on my dude
(No, don't do it...)
Ya'll know him as Mr. Bad Man
I'mma give it up to my man, R.A. the Rugged Man

[Verse 2: R.A. the Rugged Man]
[?] boom
I'm a soul man like Sam & Dave
The Rugged Man, Rampage, back on the damn stage
My flow hot, you can use it to light fires
R.I.P Heavy diddly diddly diddly D, Dwight Myers
Walkin' in between the Twin Towers on high wires
This for Harlem, boogie down Bronx, Brooklyn, the do or diers
Flippin' tables in restaurants, I don't need no reservation
You more artificial than artificial insemination
I'm the king forever reignin', from generation to generation
Remain' from Genesis to the Book of Revelation
I was born pissed off, I stay hatin'
I walk the streets lookin' like Onyx with the mad face invasion
I remain the heaviest livin', spittin' the deadliest venom in 'em
And if it wasn't for rappin' I'd be buried and dead or in prison
I rhyme with a vengeance, my opposition is never forgiven
I wreck 'em and get 'em spittin' green soup and their head'd be spinnin'
I'm like, zig zag zig, I flip it to zag zig zag
I'm the George Thorogood of rap, I'm B-B-B-B-bad
Ain't impressed by steroid needles and weight trainin'
You 300 pound bouncers get knocked out, I ain't playin'
Tales from suburbia, rock the party
The home of Roc and Prodigy, Bus-a-Bus, De La, Punk, Nucks, and Rock Marcy
E-Double, MP, Chris Paul, the whole army
And Rugged Man you don't want no parts of me, come on

[Hook x2]
