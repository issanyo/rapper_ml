Verse One: Rampage

I went into the Mirage, parties on charge
10 bottles of Dom P, I'm feelin' so large
Chickens shakin' they asses like ya don't care
Guess what (what?)
This is the party of the year, flooded out Cartier
Tell 'em stop and stare
Rocks in my ear
Weighing two point eight, so I'm livin' life straight
Fuck all you player haters, I got them Now-And-Later gators
The mad future flavors
Niggas pass 'em like a pack of Life Savors
My whole cup is lime green, Flipmode is on the scene
Call me the black Charlie Sheen
The rap Itty Ammine
That makes you wanna scream, throw ya hands in the air
If you know what I mean, I countin' one (one!)
Like a basketball team
Makin' sure that you shake your ass
Till you fall out on the ground, you better bring you oxygen tank
We gettin' down

Chorus (702)

I wonder why...
We're getting so much paper
I wonder why...
And that I've never, that I've never feel
(Never feel like that)
I wonder why (why)
We're getting so much paper
I wonder why (why, why, why, why, why, why)

Verse Two: Rampage

Gramp I'm a Big Willie, from New York to Philly
I Take You To The Streets like Billy
Shady niggas actin' silly
They watch my back, I still got my shit millie
I'm a cool cat, that says to myself
No fakin' jacks
My accountant pays my tax when I shop at Sax
Just bought a gold Acs, that's fully loaded
Now I'm bloated, you know my name in this rap game
I'm doing many things I can't explain
Buying it in twenty's
Back with a hundred tellin' them to keep the change
Take a long trip to Spain, I got a phat house in the ill (hill)
Sippin' Marguritas like Shaquielle
Bout to see three mill'
And build and empire, yo, yo, yo the Ramp is on fire
I won't stop rocking until I retire, Flipmode toughest squad
And we still on fire, we getz down

Chorus (sung by 702)

I wonder why...
We're getting so much paper
I wonder why...
And that I've never, that I've never feel
(Never feel like that)
I wonder why (why)
We're getting so much paper
I wonder why (why, why, why, why, why, why)
