Busta:
Uh-uh
Fears, real fears
The universal Flipmode Squad
Known to every existing life form as the Imperial 6
Has formed an alliance with the official Cluemannatti
Whatever you want, we do whatever you want

(in the background as Busta speaks)
Whatever you you want (4x)
Do whatever you want, whatever you want (5x)

Baby Sham:
Yo it's time to make these moves
Me and my Flipmode crew
Baby Sham spit the hot shit just for you
Make you get off your seat so you can cop the Clue
Q.B.C. and killer kids never obey these rules
That's why we roll deep and always carry the two
Smack a nigga face, fuck up his mood EXCUSE YOU
When we perform, bitches stand still like statues
Borrow this game, so y'all can proceed to move

Rah Digga:
Uh-uh the ruggedest thing as far as chics go
Watch nigga grow away faster than a pit bull
I tell them all they ain't got nothing for 'em
Platinum and album with no singing in the chorus
You get ate like you was peanut butter and swarma
Go tell yo' people I got a shitty karma BRICK CITY
Home of the crush MC's and my shit be the joint like I was Black Eyed
Peas

Hook (Busta Rhymes and Lord Have Mercy)
Wiggle how you want, shake it how you want
When you get a lot of money, spend it how you want
We always got the new, always coming through
Buck wild, do whatever that y'all wanna do

Wiggle how you want, shake it how you want
When you get a lot of money, spend it how you want
We always got the new, always coming through
With my nigga Clue, rapping with my Flipmode crew

Rampage:
Ramp, I'm still jig
I'm in the party taking a swig
I'm rich, yo I gotta think big
Holding the bar, me and Busta Bus, Lord Have and Spliff Star
Driving foreign cars, open club speed
Sham and Rah Digga had the weed, pass the duche
That all a nigga need
Twenty to one, y'all know the whole gamble
All my life I had to scramble WHAT

Spliff Star:
I be that thug back in the club
Puffin' on bud, chics eyein' me
Niggas through the street show me love
Gettin' paper now, Bill Gates is my neighbor now
Chics all flavors now, cause a nigga kinda famous now
This here, my year turn millionaire
If it's well, cop a beach house, kick a seashell
If I got it, I'mma flaunt it
That Brooklyn shit, I'm on it
Spliff Star, America's nightmare most wanted

Hook (DJ Clue shout outs)

Busta Rhymes:
You want beef, my name Beef Steak Charles
With deeper frequency than Lou Rawls
Drop like Niagara Falls
Soft like Quaker Oats whippin' in speed boats
Make y'all niggas BA-AH-AH like a bunch of billygoats
BA-AH-AH back to you, while you take notes
Rippin' shit down from the arena to parade floats YO
Yo, Flipmode Squad lock yo' house up
Quick to talk shit, nigga we lock yo mouths up

Lord Have Mercy:
Landlord confusing you chumps
Doing it up off rhymes
Scarring, shooting up the club
Like pharmaceutical drugs
You stupid as fuck, doing 'em up
Losing your blood
It's a cold world, with beautiful sluts screwing for ones
King of the jungle(jungle), swing on a humble(humble)
Stay grippin' on bundles, scattered in pieces
Chatted with Jesus
Niggas salute the dead and gone, the dead and gone
Flipmode and Desert Storm, Desert Storm

Hook (2x)

DJ Clue:
DJ CLUE

Busta Rhymes(talking):
It only gets better motherfuckers
Flipmode the Imperial, Cluemanati
Do whatever the fuck y'all wanna do
