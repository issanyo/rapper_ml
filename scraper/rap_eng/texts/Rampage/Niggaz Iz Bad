Chorus 4X
Simma rhyme, simma love, niggas iz bad
I was sure a sucker nigga, whose the dick iz bad

[Serious]
Yo yo yo yo
In ya face, in ya face, in ya face
Come taste the paste their is inside the hell's place
Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up and give me space
I set the pace in the race
Gloom I count baroom baroom and then soon
Like a locomotive hard explosive
Rims that's reem and concrete, yes an asphalt
Guess it's my fault, no It's a Earth shattering experience
To get strangled from ya clearance gon sample as an example
What make ya creep or make ya crawl
O must fall into the yard, guess it
Yes it, yes it, yes it, yes y'all
Feel the vibe of the wall
Step in, step real like a record reckin' reckin ball
That's how I deck the halls
Just check ya skills, you don't got the balls

[Arguing]

[Rampage]
Simma rhyme, simma love, I'm a show brothers
As I walk thru the valley of death, check the sonic boom
Pass the lighter, I beat ya down like Street Fighter
It's the Boy Scout, true game
I'm the eighth wonder of the world
Now I'm goin trial, cuz the Boy Scout fit down ya girl
Know I'm the heavy weight, the Brooklyn Bomber
I got to represent, word to Scout's Honor
I got my hat turned back, nigga don't say that
I bet ya catch ya contact, cuz Boy Scout is all that
Aiyo Ra, flip the drums, I'm gonna break gums
I peep for MC's, with the sa sa swollen thumbs
I'm a broadcast, yo a brother I'm a bast ya isle
It's the Boy Scout, doin the desk
Now I got the broadcast to represent
I'm lettin brothers know the Boy Scout don't give a fuck
Cuz I'm a rock rock rip, too young to slip
Rollin down with a nine clip, plus I gotta rip a rip
I break it down to the dozen, I be with awesome shit
I even live with all my fuckin girl cousin
I lived in mountain nigga, Rampage is the bomb
Cuz I'm tell ya, Rampage is the bomb
About to break two, 1994
Flipmode is the Squad, raw
