[Intro]
Uh yeah..
Mmm oh..
Mmm ooh..
Hey ey yeah..
Ooo-o-hoo-ooh..
Hey ey..
Hey ey..
Oooh..
Mmmo..

[Verse 1]
In tight situations (I'm there to call on)
If ever in a crisis (I'm to your rescue)
And when you feeling nasty (my mind is open)
Even your darkest fantasies (there's nothing that I can't handle)

[Hook](2x)
Say what's on your mind
Say what's on your heart
Your love gave me a brand new start
Only here for you
You know that this is true
I'll break my own rules for you

[Verse 2]
I'm never too busy
Cause you're a priority
If I already made plans
Use your seniority
For you I will cancel
To show you my loyalty
Your thoughts are never minor
More like the majority (oh no)

[Hook](2x)
Say what's on your mind
Say what's on your heart
Your love gave me a brand new start
Only here for you
You know that this is true
I'll break my own rules for you

Nothing is too big
And nothing is too small
Comfort through it all
That's even if you fall off
You're against wall
I'm against the wall
For the long hall (2x)...
