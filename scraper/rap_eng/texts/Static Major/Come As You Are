[Verse 1]
I was just a girl, innocent like a dove
I was just a girl, no thoughts of making love
I was just a girl, holding hands was enough
I was just a girl, a man didn't mean as much
Now I'm a woman, a passionate woman
Now I'm a woman, a true leading woman
Now I'm a woman, a sensual woman
Now I'm a woman, a woman, a woman

I was just a girl, flirtin' was all it was
I was just a girl, kept feelings bottled up
I was just a girl, never knew how to trust
I was just a girl, love didn't mean as much
Now I'm a woman, a passionate woman
Now I'm a woman, a sensual woman
Now I need someone, to have somethin' in common
Now I need someone, someone, someone

[Pre-Chorus]
He don't have to make lots of cheddar
He don't have to bring love letters
You don't have to flirt with the fellas
Some'll let you know if you can get up

[Chorus]
So come as you are, baby
So come as you are, baby
So come as you are, baby
Different from her

[Verse 2]
I was just a, I was just a, I was just a girl, sweet like honey
I was just a girl, used to spending money
I was just a girl, you couldn't buy me
I was just a girl, that wrote in a diary
Now I'm a woman, a passionate woman
Now I'm a woman, a true leading woman
Now I'm a woman, a sensual woman
Now I'm a woman, a woman, a woman

I was just a girl, so soft spoken
I was just a girl, mind wasn't open
I was just a girl, I work and make full checks
I was just a girl, I was lonely in the showbiz
Now I'm a woman, a passionate woman
Now I'm a woman, a sensual woman
Now I need someone, to have somethin' in common
Now I need someone, someone, someone

[Pre-Chorus]
He don't have to make lots of cheddar
He don't have to bring love letters
You don't have to flirt with the fellas
Some'll let you know if you can get up

[Chorus]
So come as you are
So come as you are
So come as you are
Different from her

[Bridge]
Its what I want, what I want
Its what I want, what I want
Its what I want, what I want
Its what I want, what I want
I need a man who's sure of himself
I need a man who's true to himself
I need a man who does with himself
I need a man who'd weigh more for self

[Pre-Chorus]
He don't have to make lots of cheddar
He don't have to bring love letters
You don't have to flirt with the fellas
Some'll let you know if you can get up

[Chorus]
So come as you are
So come as you are
So come as you are
Different from her
