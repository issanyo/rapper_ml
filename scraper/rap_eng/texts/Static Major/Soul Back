[Verse 1]
Once upon
Upon a time
I had it all (I had it all)
Happy high on a hill
A fancy car (a fancy car)

I seen the stars ( I seen the stars)
I lost my heart
I lost my job
I lost my love (I lost my love)
I couldn't think

I wanna leave (I wanna leave)
Until you came
Back in my life
To re-unite
Now I'm making a come back(???)
Making paper chase
This is where it stays (stays, stays)

Passed us by
Without a surprise (without a surprise)
The circumstances
That I made
Led us goodbye
I got to say ~ I got to say ~ I I got to say
I thought I saw some lonely days (lonely days, I thought I some lonely days)
Now through the job(???)
That I see proud(???)
I want it all (I want it all)
Cause I had mind
When your eyes
Collecting the thighs (collecting the thighs)
