[Verse 1]
It's Wintertime 2013 you head over heels for me
Always hittin' my phone up you really had the feels for me
Lord, oh lord  you a blessing
You seemed so perfect
Seemed like a real good person
Seemed like you might be worth it
God, thank God, thank God she feeling the kid
Remember that night you know what we did
Remember on Cinco de Mayo?
That was the night you got wild
That was the night that you told me you like me
Girl that shit had me excited
Then you told me that if I don't stop flirting with them other girls you gon' fight me
Then you got on top and I liked it
Never met another girl like this
Remember me kissing your lips
Feeling your waist and grippin' your hips
Remember I gave you that Ferro Rochero
Gave you it to you cuz I knew you were special
Remember that Yogli Mogli I can't forget that day
And you kissed me goodbye I know you can't forget that Kay
Now you taking your talents to Auburn
Can't lie it's kinda depressing
But I thank God I met you Lord knows you a blessing
But you don't believe in us
I believe in love and you believe in lust
You feeling me but you don't feel the trust
Cuz the last man fucked up
But I'm not the last man so wassup?
Lord I don't know what else to do
I was focused on us you were focused on you (Aghh)

[Chorus x3]
This was never really about us
And everything was always 'bout you
You never knew a thing about trust
And I knew everything about you, what's happening

[Verse 2]
Conversations with King Bouba at the market
He asked if I'm gon' follow up with Kay and I said hell yeah
Then I asked why
He said 'She's a very good girl the commitment type
A rare breed that's hard to come across in this life'
(Damn) Damn that shit me
I gotta turn in this love for infinity
Girl I got plans you know you deserve it
I give you my all cuz I know that you're worth it (it's all good)
So in love I told you to your face love
Your head down your face down
Can't even pick your face up
Then you told me you never heard those words before
But if we got together girl you bound to hear those words more
Thank God you a angel I'll say it again you a blessing
The ball is in your court I hope you swish in my direction
But you don't feel me the same
Not anymore your feelings done changed
You don't text me like you used to
You ain't tryna be next like you used to
Lord how we get like this
I don't know what else to do
I was focused on us you were focused on you (Aghh)

[Chorus x3]
