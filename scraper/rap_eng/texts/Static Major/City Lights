[Intro]
City lights, it's on tonight

[Verse 1]
Out on the street
I'm looking for the celebration
Come roll with me
Together, we can crash the party and
Get on the floor
DJ, please play my song
And we can do this all night long
Once again it is on
I'm on a high
I feel like I'm on medications
I'm open wide
And we don't need no complications 'cause
I feel alright
And all I see is red lights
And blue lights, it feel like
And it's real like it's out of sight

[Chorus]
I'm under the city lights
It's on, it's on tonight
My mood is right
It's on, it's on tonight
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Tonight it's our world
Tonight it's our world

[Post-Chorus]
World, I'm out tonight
World, see I'm out tonight
World, hey
World, come on now!

[Verse 2]
It's after dark
Another story's in the morning
I can see the stars
Crimson cars in the boulevard and now
I'm so inspired
'Cause I wanna buy me a Lexus
Or maybe I'll get me a Beamer
Or a Hummer for summer
It's never too late
There's always more fascination
Just turn the page
And I won't be hesitating 'cause
I can hardly wait
To do my dance, to wave my hands
Hear my jam, you can count me in
I wish tonight would never end

[Chorus]
I'm under the city lights
It's on, it's on tonight
My mood is right
It's on, it's on tonight
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Tonight it's our world
Tonight it's our world
I'm under the city lights
It's on, it's on tonight
My mood is right
It's on, it's on tonight
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Tonight it's our world
Tonight it's our world

[Bridge]
I'm out tonight
And it's alright
See, I'm out tonight
And it's alright
JoJo, do that thing
Said JoJo, do that thing
JoJo, do that thing
Said JoJo, do that thing, aight!
I'm out tonight
And it's alright
See, I'm out tonight
And it's alright
JoJo, do that thing
Said JoJo, do that thing
Jojo, do that thing
Said JoJo, do that thing, aight!

[Chorus]
I'm under the city lights
It's on, it's on tonight
My mood is right
It's on, it's on tonight
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Tonight it's our world
Tonight it's our world
I'm under the city lights
It's on, it's on tonight
My mood is right
It's on, it's on tonight
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Tonight it's our world
Tonight it's our world

[Outro]
World, world, world
