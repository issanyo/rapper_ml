[Verse 1]
I know I'm not what you need
Baby, why you trying? Come over and comfort me
Ain't no sense in lying, do you deserve it honestly?
We could just part ways, find out our own destiny
Baby, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'm more than just a girl
That you can meet walking down the street
I think you know that I'm the one
That you want in your company

[Chorus]
I'm too much of a woman
Too much of a woman
Too much of a bad ass bitch
Too much of a boss, baby, it's your loss
Now you gotta live with it

[Post-Chorus]
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you
(Too much, too much, too much for you, yeah)

[Verse 2]
There ain't really nothing left
Baby, that's a promise, you were fucking with the best
Something I will say, that I might just miss your sex
That don't mean I want you, you can go and stay my ex
Baby, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'm more than just a girl
That you can meet walking down the street
I think you know that I'm the one
That you want in your company

[Chorus]
I'm too much of a woman
Too much of a woman
Too much of a bad ass bitch
Too much of a boss, baby, it's your loss
Now you gotta live with it

[Post-Chorus]
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you

[Bridge]
You told me you love me, I told you I wanna see it
You told me it's mine and I could have it when I pleases
Every night we sexing, you wearing your Jesus pieces
Like Jesus Christ himself gon' save a nigga from misleading
I want you to know that I meant that, gotta know that I sent that
Text in the middle of the night
To tell your ass how to fuck that flight
'Cause I can't sit at home on your couch
Listening to word of mouth 'bout how you been out
And about fucking hoes, playing out

[Chorus]
('Cause) I'm too much of a woman
Too much of a woman (too much)
Too much of a bad ass bitch
Too much of a boss, baby, it's your loss
Now you gotta live with it

[Post-Chorus]
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you

[Outro]
Too much, too much for you, baby, yeah
Too much, too much, no
Too much, too much for you
