[Intro: IamSu!]
It's been a long time, shouldn't have left you
Without a dope rhyme to step to
It's been a long time, shouldn't have left you
Without a dope rhyme to step to

[Hook: IamSu!]
I be dipped when they see me
Chuck a deuce when you see me
I be dipped when they see me
Chuck a deuce when you see me

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
ALIFE, Y-3
Got racks, in my jeans Nudie jeans
Rich city, that's the hood
Let's get it, understood understood
Royals, James, Stealths, Knicks
Nigga I done copped all them kicks
Ice cream, Bathing Ape, Pink Dolphin
Everyday everyday
Heartbreakers to the top boy
Don't stop the boy, young shmop boy
Yeah a nigga got his style from the Hot Boys
That's so hard till I caught the fucking drop boy (ooh)
Get money, that's that
One tour, hundred racks, hundred racks
All my homies iced out
Nigga play, lights out

[Hook x2: IamSu!]
I be dipped when they see me
Chuck a deuce when you see me
I be dipped when they see me
Chuck a deuce when you see me

[Verse 2: Chipa$$]
You got no swag, you washed up
Facing me don't try to
When you witchu baby she on me
Watching me I'm Caillou
Pressed fit I'm a freshman in this letterman, high school
I'm on the paper like all day until the sun down, night school
Styling, fliest in the classroom, flight school
Blowing on that [?], mellow, Valium
I got bars, like cities, death row, Suge Knight
I'm poppin niggas like gimme that, land down, good night
All rest we street wise, no jewels just Levi's
Bay shit don't wear that I've been fresh since knee high
Original these niggas tryna get outta here, three strikes
All rest I rock it like Houston, Dwight
Bitches and chippas and suzy it's a movie
I'm so dope, pookie, I don't rock no Louis
Armstrong like BJ, blowjobs that real [?]
No police I'm tryna cop me a Maybach like Rick Ross
Choppas!

[Hook x4: IamSu!]
I be dipped when they see me
Chuck a deuce when you see me
I be dipped when they see me
Chuck a deuce when you see me
