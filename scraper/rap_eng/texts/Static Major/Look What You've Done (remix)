[Cizzle]
Its 2k10 i was fucked up had to find myself/
Like a poker game play ya Cards rite baby i can deal/
But you know tha deal like chief keef you know tha drill/
I luv yo luvin but baby girl i luv tha pills/

I was doin xanz and i stuffed err single blunt with kush/
Made a toast to life and did champaign with percocet/
Set my pride aside girl i was wrong admit to you i was wrong rite now/
She said save ya shit cuz this ain't time  nor tha place for rite now/

She dnt weight gain cuz she eat rite and she waist train thats a great thing/
Boss bish but she maintains them jelious hoes made a fake page god damn/
You tha truth will set you free when ett nigga do you wrong dnt come running back to me/
I met baby moma on a sunny day down in louisville them was good days/

Did i miss those yeah i could say we grew apart and she jus changed/
I pull up in that new thing matte black bruce wayne/
Gat man no robbins tru religion I'm sponcered/
I'm sorry fa all the bullshit i put you through with my selfish ass/

Took a lot but I'm built too last/
One day i'll leave tha trap/
One day i ant need to trap/
When i leave i ain't coming back/

Dnt call my phone nor send a text bcuz tha next level is where I'm at  Cizzle/
