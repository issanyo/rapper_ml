[Verse 1]
Hey what's your story
Hate to see ya lookin' worried
You know you can tell me
Cause I am understanding
Would you mind sharing
What's bothering your happiness
Turn that frown upside down
What's with all this madness

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it somethin' (somethin), somethin' I should know? (Somethin' I should know)
Is it somethin' (somethin), somethin' I should know? (Somethin' I should know)
Cause I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
Then I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
Yeah, well

[Chorus]
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on
That's what friends are for

[Verse 2]
I know it's a struggle
You gotta flex your muscle
Don't be scared to hustle
There's no reason to wrestle
Take your time
Clear your mind
You know I am here for you
Don't be scared
Pour out your heart
I'll be there wherever you want

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it somethin' (somethin), somethin' I should know? (Somethin' I should know)
Is it somethin' (somethin), somethin' I should know? (Somethin' I should know)
Cause I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
Then I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
Yeah, well

[Chorus]
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on
That's what friends are for

[Bridge]
You can tell me (Tell me, tell me)
I'll help you when you help me
Oh baby I'll listen to you
Everything you're going through
I swear I will
I swear I will
You can tell me (Tell me baby)
And you know you can trust me
Baby I'll listen to you
And everything you're goin through
You know I will
You know I will

[Outro]
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on
That's what friends are for
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on
That's what friends are for
