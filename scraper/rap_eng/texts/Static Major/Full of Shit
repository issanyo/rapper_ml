[Intro]
I know you full of shit...

[Hook: Nayer]
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit

[Post-Hook: Pitbull]
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
(Tell you what I think about these boys out here in the state they call the game)
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm sick of these rappers slash actors pl-pl-pl-playing a part
All they talk about is they money, je-je-je-jewels and cars
So put pha-pha-phatoms & bentleys & how they squeeze 'til it's empty
How they move - yay hooray!
Another dope boy wannabe
All in the club talkin' 'bout
Wha-wha-what what they got
Pull out the club on 26's
Go str straight to they mama's house
Like southern Cali they hardly make it rain or drizzle
That's why I do them so opposite of these nizzles for shizzles
Uh, tell 'em!

[Hook: Nayer]
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit

[Post-Hook: Pitbull]
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
The boy know his alphabet, so now he think he a G
Run a little Pac so he think he a thug
Bu-bu-bu-but all eyes on me
They used to wanna be like mike
Now they just want a piece of the mic
They cut fucked-up deals in music
Imagine if they got 25 to life

They'll be singing like Whitney
Before - before she met Bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowin' they green like wasabi
They'll be singing like Whitney
Before - before she met Bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowing they green like wasabi
Now tell 'em!

[Hook: Nayer]
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit

[Post-Hook: Pitbull]
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
You heard me?

[Bridge: Pitbull]
These boys right now they got a house full of cars
A bank account full of money
They act like they on full
But check this out fool
I know you're full of shit

[Hook: Nayer]
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit
You're so full of shit

[Post-Hook: Pitbull]
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
You heard me?
