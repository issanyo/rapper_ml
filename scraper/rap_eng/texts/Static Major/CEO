[Verse 1]
Being in love is hard (it’s like a job)
That’s why I make it a point to step to, each issue we go through (it’s always something new)
I gotta keep up my guard (being in charge)
Can’t let no one give me heart breaks
It’s one thing when you explain (minds do change)

[Pre-Hook]
Who you fussing with?
I’m the only boss that can boss around here
I’m the CEO, stay on your job, or you can be replaced
Don’t you order me, cause I’m calling the shots that go on around here
You can’t tell me no, I send you home
Thought I’d let you know that

[Chorus]
I’ll be running the show, I’m CEO, I’m in control, that’s how it rolls
If you didn’t know the scenario, I run the show
I’ll be running the show, I’m CEO, I’m in control, that’s how it rolls
If you didn’t know the scenario, I run the show

[Verse 2]
I’ve got to wear the pants in a true romance
That’s the only way we’ll ever stand a chance
So I ain’t taking orders from a man, You got to understand
See I can work with you, long as you are true
Change out the blue and I’ll start taking interviews
Let me give you a list of my demands, never raise your hand

[Pre-Hook]
Who you fussing with?
I’m the only boss that can boss around here
I’m the CEO, Stay on your job, Or you can be replaced
Don’t you order me, cause I’m calling the shots that go on around here
You can’t tell me no, I send you home
Thought I’d let you know that

[Chorus]
I’ll be running the show, I’m CEO, I’m in control, that’s how it rolls
If you didn’t know the scenario, I run the show
I’ll be running the show, I’m CEO, I’m in control, that’s how it rolls
If you didn’t know the scenario, I run the show
I’ll be running the show, I’m CEO, I’m in control, that’s how it rolls
If you didn’t know the scenario, I run the show
I’ll be running the show, I’m CEO, I’m in control, that’s how it rolls
If you didn’t know the scenario, I run the show

[Bridge]
I’m gonna keep handling my business baby
Cause I’m a real lady
And I hope you take care of your business baby
I wanna be your lady
