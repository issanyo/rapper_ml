[Verse 1]
Oh, I've been watching you like a hawk in the sky
That flies, and you were my prey
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads
You know that one of these days
We gon' hook it up, probably talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell you, but

[Chorus]
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody, nobody
Hope you're responsible
I gotta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
I really need somebody
Tell me you're that somebody?

[Post-Chorus]
I've been watching you like a
I've been watching you like a
I've been watching you like a hawk in the
Like a hawk in the

[Verse 2]
Oh, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block, while everyone's sleeps
I'll be waiting there with my trench, my looks, my hat
Just so I'm low key
If you tell the world
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't tell you, but

[Chorus]
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody, nobody
Hope you're responsible
I gotta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
I really need somebody
Tell me you're that somebody?

[Bridge]
Baby boy, I'm the girl from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Don't you know that I am the girl
Rock shows around the world
Make people shake it
Don't you know
Gotta tell somebody
I really need somebody
Tell me you're that somebody

[Chorus]
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody, nobody
Hope you're responsible
I gotta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
I really need somebody
Tell me you're that somebody?
