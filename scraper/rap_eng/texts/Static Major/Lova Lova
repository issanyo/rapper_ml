[Verse 1]
You're controlling me
You turn my world upside down
There's always time and always a right place
Everything's cool
Cool like an ice tray
Commonly me and your touch more and more
Ninety six glasses calling for reckless
Seven days a week
Cool like the guess list

Every night it gets better-better (Ooh-yeah)
Lova - lova - I love her - love her (Always oh)
It seems every night it gets better-better

[Verse 2]
Sexuality is running from your head to toe
You always know how to say the right thing
The way you put your lips always the right place
Constantly on my mind like a video, (Constantly)
Press rewind and watch it once more, (Like a video)
More and more [x2]
