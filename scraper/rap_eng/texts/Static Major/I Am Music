[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I'll be with you on your way to work
When your car turns on, you'll probably hear me
You can't run your car without me (Without me)
Want a deal, costs you a hundred G's
I am, I am

[Hook: Static]
I am music
I'm melodies and harmonies
Stereo and mono
On the radio, the radio
I said I am music
I'm simply dope beats
Intros and drum rolls
On the radio, the radio

[Verse 2: Static]
I'll meet you at a summer jam
I'm with you PM or AM
I'll work out with you when you're at the gym
And when you clean the house, I'll be in the den
Cuz I am

[Hook 2: Static & Timbaland]
I am music
Melodies, harmonies
Mono, stereo, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I am music
Simply dope beats
Tempos, drum rolls, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Verse 3: Aaliyah]
You may find me at a shopping mall
I'm not buying but I'll be for sale
I'll be your theme in one of your talent shows
Might even hear me at a restaurant
Cuz I am
