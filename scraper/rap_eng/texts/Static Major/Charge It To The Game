[Intro: Static Major]
Uh
Hey yeah

[Verse 1: Playa]
Cause if she's fly
What man gon' turn her down?
And if she's right
Got to keep her around
And if she's got a man
That means no obligation
Don't be mad, it's in our nature

[Chorus: Playa & Aaliyah]
And I don't know if we gon' ever change
Ask the next man he'll probably say the same
Don't hate me, just charge it to the game

You ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
No love

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
Cause if he's fast, home boy you'll never last
Somebody who's talkin' right, can't come with just all night
Boy you don't know me, try and you'll see
So what you tellin' me
Won't spend my day on me

[Chorus: Playa & Aaliyah]
And I don't know if we gon' ever change
Ask the next man he'll probably say the same
Don't hate me, just charge it to the game

You ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
No love

[Bridge: Playa]
Don't hate me, just charge it to the game
Don't hate me, just charge it to the game
Don't hate me, just charge it to the game
Don't hate me, just charge it to the game

[Outro: Aaliyah & Playa]
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good (Don't hate me, just charge it to the game)
You gets no love in my hood (Don't hate me, just charge it to the game)
If you ain't no good (Don't hate me, just charge it to the game)
You gets no love in my hood (Don't hate me, just charge it to the game) (x4)
