[Hook: Digital Black]
I don’t think they know
Do you think he knows
I don’t think she knows
I don’t think they know the truth they say they saw
I don’t think they know
How could they know
I don't think they have a clue

[Verse 1: Digital Black]
See you either in the studio
Or on the go
I'm on the road
With my clique
We cannot quit
'Cause I know you want some more
I do more than sing
I'm a hit writer now
I'm in stable now
'Cause I got my own label now
Interviews that I do
With my crew
We can choose
Cuz we can loose
We pay dues
And I know you want some more
I trully believe that
If you knew the real me
Then you'd know I do this shit for free (free, free, free...)

[Hook: Digital Black]
I don't think they know
Do you think he knows
I don't think she knows
I don't think they know, I bet you
Say they saw
I don't think they know
How could they know
I don't think they have a clue

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
Thank you for the autographs
Energy is what it gives
You still find me
You can't doubt me
I think you want some more
I do more than sing
I'm older now
Actin' now
'Cause I got my own movie now
After all
Through all this
You can give me
You still find me
You can't play me
You can't doubt me
And I think you want some more
I truly believe that
If it was not for you
I don't know what I would do (ooh...)

[Hook: Digital Black & Aaliyah]
I don't think they know
Do you think he knows
I don't think she knows (yeah...)
I don't think they know, I bet you (no, no...)
Say they saw
I don't think they know
How could they know
I don't think they have a clue
I don't think they know
Do you think he knows
I don't think she knows (baby, baby, yeah...)
I don't think they know, I bet you
Say they saw
I don't think they know
How could they know
I don't think they have a clue

[Verse 3: Digital Black & Aaliyah]
All we're tryin'to say is
It's not about the monopoly
It's only about the love we see
He'll be up in her space
Transcript it with one of your hands
It's all about the love you show
And we just want you to know
We'll be there to be your soul (We all can see you)
Demonstrate through our thing (yeah...)

[Hook: Digital Black]
I don't think they know
Do you think he knows
I don't think she knows
I don't think they know, I bet you
Say they saw
I don't think they know
How could they know
I don't think they have a clue

[Interlude: Aaliyah]
Do you know
Does he know
Does she know (no, no...)
Say they saw
I don't think they know (no, no...)
Oh, oh, no, no...

[Hook: Digital Black & Aaliyah]
I don't think they know (It's been over ten years...)
Do you think he knows
I don't think she knows (I've cried some tears right over you...)
I don't think they know, I bet you
Say they saw
I don't think they know (I'm about to get your ass together...)
How could they know
I don't think they have a clue
I don't think they know (ooh...)
Do you think he knows
I don't think she knows
I don't think they know, I bet you
Say they saw
I don't think they know
How could they know
I don't think they ha
