[Verse 1 - Static:]
It's Been A Long Long Time Since I've Seen Ya Girl
And You Still Lookin Damn Good
We Go Way Way Back Back In 86
You Was The Star Of The Hood
But Ain't A Damn Thang Change
Since You're On Your Feet Cause Baby I'm On Mine Too
Don't Forget Those Days In Mama's House
And All That We Used To Do
Come here and ....

[Chorus w/Static adlibs]
Unzip Your Dress Im Out My Suit
First We'll Get Hot Then We'll Get Loose
Unzip Your Dress, Im Out My Suit
Tell Me Your Mind
Girl Its All Good

[Verse 2 - Black:]
Baby Girl Lets Shake This Spot
Til Your Team Goodbye
Cause You'll Be Ridin With Me
We Goin Back To My Crib
Been Up A Long Time
If You Know What I Mean
Its Them Damn Bedroom Eyes You Been Givin Me
Ain't A Thang U Can Say
Uh Dont Forget Those Days Back In Mama's House
And The Way We Would Play
Let Me Help Ya

[Chorus with Black adlibs]

[Static Rap:]
Check This Out
I Hit Ya Before I Miss
My Lovin' Ridiculous
One Peck On The Neck
Don't Know What The Heck
Or Maybe I'll Lick The Lips
Or Maybe I'll Grip The Hips
What A Relief It Is
The More The Cushion The Better The Pushin

Im Noticin Youre Impressed
Im Drawin Your Interest
I Losin My Tie, I Look In Your Eye, You're Fixin To Lose The Dress
Dont Gimme No Mess And No Hassle Cause Im Not The One To Wrastle
Its Either You Ready To Deal Or Girl You Gon Have To Skedaddle

[Chorus]
