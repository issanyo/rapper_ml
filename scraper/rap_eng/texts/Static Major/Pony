[Verse 1]
I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off

[Verse 2]
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off
I promise that you won't wanna get off

[Chorus]
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

[Verse 3]
Sitting here flossing
Peeping your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I will do to you

[Verse 4]
You and your body
Every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your thigh

[Chorus]
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

[Bridge]
If we're gonna get nasty, baby
First we'll show and tell
'Til I reach your ponytail
Lurk all over and through you, baby
Until I reach your stream
You'll be on my jockey team

[Chorus]
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
