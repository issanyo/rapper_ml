Passion, instant
Sweat beads fill me
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing

Tempt me (tempt me), drive me (drive me)
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It's yours entirely

(I'll be)
More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

(I'll be)
More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

Midnight grinding'
My heartrate's climbing'
You go, I go

'Cause we share pillows
Chase me, leave me

There's still no separating
Morning massages
With new bones in your closet

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More enough for ya

Constant pleasures
No scale can measure
Secret treasures
Keeps on getting better

Do you wanna roll with me?
We can go to foreign lands
Your hand in my hand
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can be like Bonnie & Clyde
Be by your side

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

[Music break]

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya

More than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover
More than enough for ya
