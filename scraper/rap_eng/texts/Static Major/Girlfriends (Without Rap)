[Verse 1]
I pulled up to the bar, in my halter top
Know I'm lookin' hot, we hit the spot
So many eyes on me - Yaushameen
Did you see, what I just seen?
Said he caught my eye
Took a double take
Let's double-date - pick a place
Go ballin' out of control"

[Chorus]

Me and my girlfriends
We talk like ya’ll do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don’t do?

Me and my girlfriends
We make creep calls too
And if you start actin up
We got someone else to fall to

Me and my girlfriends
We talk like ya’ll do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don’t do?

Me and my girlfriends
We make creep calls too
And if you never start actin up
We got someone else to fall to

Me and my girlfriends
