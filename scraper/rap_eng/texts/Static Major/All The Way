[Verse 1 - Smokey]
Well I'm the type of guy
That likes to ball with a girl
A couple of friends and a beer
Have a drink or two
But then im all in for the night
Cause see tonight
Imma need it more than twice
Maybe three a do for me you see
And we can go...

[Chorus w Smokey adlibs]
All the way, starting today
I'm on my way, round your way
I got haze and a bottle of zay
Hey hey..hey hey hey hey

[Verse 2 - Static (Playa)]
(now im so glad that we set aside a day
A special day for us)
Just to chill and barbeque
And discuss the feelings we have
I know you have cause i can see
Baby you ain't foolin me
Not today or any day i say

[Chorus with Static adlibs]

[Bridge - Black]
Oh i, oh i oh i
Girl i'm feelin you
Oh i oh i oh i
Think i can deal with you
Oh i oh i oh i
I'm really feeling you
Oh i oh i oh i
Think i can deal with ya

[Chorus with Black adlibs]
