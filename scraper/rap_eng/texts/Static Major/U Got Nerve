[Intro: Static Major]
Come on
Watch out
Come on
Come on
Come on

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Gave you chances on top of chances
Opportunities taken for granted
(Watch out)
My reality is all your infidelities
Cause insanity why you askin' me?
(Come on)

Took my kindness for a sign of weakness
(Watch out)
My own blindness cause my sadness
No longer am a slave over your madness
(Watch out)
I am glad it's finally over
(Watch out)

[Chorus: Static Major & Aaliyah]
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
See I'm tired of all the games that you seem to like to play
See what you can do for me is forget you knew my name
(Watch out)
See your qualities are less than pleasing
I got more than one reason for leaving
(Watch out)

It's time to close shop open new chapters
(Watch out)
See new beginnings is what I'm after
Get your skeletons up out my closet
(Come on, come on)
Don't make me lose it I just might lose it
(Watch out, watch out)

[Chorus: Static Major & Aaliyah]
Who do you think you are now?
(Yeah)
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
(Can't believe)
Who do you think you are now?
(Yeah, yeah)
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
(Oh yeah, babe)

Who do you think you are now?
(Who do you think you are?)
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
See I'm tired of all the games that you seem to like to play
See what you need to do is forget you knew my name
I'm a play ya till you've left cause you talkin' me to death
See I ain't even sad that I'm here all by myself

[Chorus: Static Major & Aaliyah]
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
(Yeah, yeah)
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
(Yeah, yeah)

Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
(Yeah, yeah)
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
(Yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Aaliyah & Static Major]
Yeah, yeah
You've got the nerve boy
Yeah, yeah
You've got the nerve boy

You've got the nerve boy
Got the nerve boy, got the nerve boy
You've got the nerve boy
Got the nerve boy, got the nerve boy
