Hey, there you boy I've done, had it with this
All day I've been watching your ways
It seems when the ladies walk by
Your head can't keep from turning, see finally I'm learnin'

Oh, no way, not me, I'm not havin' that there
I see soon we'll be headin' our own ways
There's no explanation for me
'Cause you can't be huggin' on me when your eyes are across the street, oh

I could care less in how hard it may be
Your eyes better not wander while you're walking next to me
And if she's so fine then that's where you should be
Your eyes better not wander while your walking next to me, oh

Okay, that's it, I'm not feeling like this
I see I'm just cramping your style
Boy, don't you walk faster than me
Lemme holla at cha later, I refuse to be a hater

Go 'head, get that, you go kick it with her
Don't trip, I'm gonna find me a new friend
It's so disrepectful to me
When you're hangin' out with me, but your eyes across the street, oh

I could care less in how hard it may be
Your eyes better not wander while you're walking next to me
If she's so fine then that's where you should be
Your eyes better not wander while your walking next to me, oh

I could care less in how hard it may be
Your eyes better not wander while you're walking next to me
If she's so fine then that's where you should be
Your eyes better not wander while your walking next to me, oh

Don't go let 'em wander wander wander wander wander wander
Don't go let 'em wander wander wander wander wander wander

I could care less in how hard it may be
Your eyes better not wander while you're walking next to me
If she's so fine then that's where you should be
Your eyes better not wander while your walking next to me, oh

I could care less in how hard it may be
Your eyes better not wander while you're walking next to me
If she's so fine then that's where you should be
Your eyes better not wander while your walking next to me, oh
