[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah, whoo whoo
This one feel real nice man. Ya dig?
Yeah yeah yeah, whooa whooa. Whooa whooa
Na na na na, yeeah

[Hook]
You'll get fire lovin all night if you were my girl
One position at a time if you were my girl
Fire lovin all night if you were my girl
One position at a time if you were my girl
(I tried to tell that we won't stop)(x4)

[Verse 1]
We might go catch a movie
Or a dinner for two, me and you
Have a bottle of Louis sitting on the table
You know I got them pesos
I'll take you around the world
If you were my girl
We would stay in five star hotels
I'm not stingy, but I want you all to myself

[B-Sec 1]
Cause when we turn off the lights and light a candle
You make me wanna hit a high note
Like "Oooo whooa whooa whooa"
Kiss your body soft and slow
While I'm taking off your clothes
We listen to slow love songs
The feeling is oh so strong

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let me be your masseuse
Call you, sip some Goose
Make you relax and make your body feel loose
Drip drip drop like a water faucet
Put a few skeletons in your closet
Cause my body's calling for you
I don't see nothing wrong
If we bump and grind all night long

[B-Sec 2]
I'ma take you to the boom boom room
I'm like zoom zoom zoom
Kisses like ooo ooo ooo
Shawty, I'll give you the business
If you give me the digits
Won't you be my boo?

[Hook]
