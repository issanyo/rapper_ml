[Verse 1]
I saw you on your cell
And I said to myself
(That's what I like, that's what I like)
I can smell your cologne
And it's turning me on
(That's what I like, that's what I like)
Just the sound of your voice
Is making me moist
(That's what I like, that's what I like)
Those sexy brown eyes
They're talking to me
(That's what I like, that's what I like)

[Chorus]
You make me a feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like, that's what I like)
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like, that's what I like)

[Post-Chorus]
So I'm on my way
He stay on the other side of town
That's where he be getting down
So I'm on my way
Cos he stay on the other side of town
That's where he be getting down

[Verse 2]
I don't know your friends
And you don't know my girls
(That's what I like, that's what I like)
And you got your own car
And your own nice place to stay
(That's what I like, that's what I like)
We could go get some dinner
And you would not let me pay
(That's what I like, that's what I like)
And we still haven't made love
And you're still willing to wait
(That's what I like, that's what I like)

[Chorus]
You make me a feel like i'm in la la land
(That's what I like, that's what I like)
You make me feel like i'm in la la land
(That's what I like, that's what I like)

[Post-Chorus]
So I'm on my way
Cos he stay on the other side of town
That's where he be getting down
So I'm on my way
Cos he stay on the other side of town
That's where he be getting down

[Bridge]
Keep on doing what you doing what you doing to me boy
Keep on doing what you doing what you doing to me boy
Keep on doing what you doing what you doing to me boy
Keep on doing what you doing what you doing to me boy

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like, that's what I like )
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like, that's what I like )
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like, that's what I like )
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like, that's what I like )
