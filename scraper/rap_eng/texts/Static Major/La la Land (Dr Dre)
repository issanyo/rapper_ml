[Verse 1]
Breathe in breathe out
You keep me on a cloud like no other lover
We get high on each other
We can roll out you blaze me at your house
You stay on my system everytime I get with ya
Oh can't wait no longer
Move, feeling's getting stronger
Take me you know what I need
Oh I need you daily
Move, feening for your baby
Take me boy it's plain to see that

[Chorus]
You make me a feel like i'm in la la land
(That's what I like,that's what I like)
You make me feel like i'm in la la land
(That's what I like,that's what I like)

[Post-Chorus]
So I'm on my way
He stay on the other side of town
That's where he be getting down
So I'm on my way
Cos he stay on the other side of town
That's where he be getting down

[Verse 2]
You're like my dream come true
I'm addicted to you
I don't need much of you, all you got to do is
Come in sit down get comfy on my couch
I feel like I'm in heaven when I'm here in your presence
Oh, My heart is racing
Oh, One more talk I'm taken
So good, I wouldn't leave you now even if I could
Oh you light my fire, oh king of my desire
So good, boy you make me feel make me feel

[Chorus]
You make me a feel like i'm in la la land
(That's what I like,that's what I like)
You make me feel like i'm in la la land
(That's what I like,that's what I like)

[Post-Chorus]
So I'm on my way
Cos he stay on the other side of town
That's where he be getting down
So i'm on my way
Cos he stay on the other side of town
That's where he be getting down

[Bridge]
Keep on doing what you doing what you doing to me boy
Keep on doing what you doing what you doing to me boy
Keep on doing what you doing what you doing to me boy
Keep on doing what you doing what you doing to me boy

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like that's what I like )
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like that's what I like )
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like that's what I like )
You make me feel like I'm in la la land
(That's what I like that's what I like )
