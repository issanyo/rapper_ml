She smelt like a rose,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  even down in her sure,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  she offered a smile even on the day she was down.                                                                                                                                                                                     She captured a room, something like a princess would do.                                                                                                                                                                           Cause the light that shined on her always came through.                                                                                                                                                                         Sweet like an angel, that's what I remember.                                                                                                                                                                                             And any time you was with you, you'd never want it to end, yeah yeah.                                                                                                                                                       And she felt like a sister Cause you knew you could trust her (yes you could).                                                                                                                                               she'd never discarry you, she only tried to encourage you.
