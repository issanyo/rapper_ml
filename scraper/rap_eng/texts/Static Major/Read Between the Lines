Late afternoon, the sun's goin' down
A ca-ca-call on the cell (why's he in such a hurry?)
Leavin' the room, he's mumbling too
Now,now lookin' for his shoes (he's leaving out the room)
No explanation, no actual location
Just watchin' him pacin' (wonder who he's stressing)
Little conversation, leavin' no debation, he left the door Swingin'

You better open your mind
You gotta read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines

9 in the mornin', up, up, up way before breakfast
Homeboy gettin' restless (the room is full of questions)
Little replyin', whole lot of denyin'
You're steady collidin' (so why do he keep on tryin'?)
I search for the median, now he's a comedian
That's all the more reason (he's changin' like the seasons)
Are you still pleasin'? Well soon you'll be leavin'
Which one will be grievin'?

You better open your mind
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines

Your replies are getting old
It's in his eyes, gotta read between the lines
Lies are getting told
Look in his eyes, gotta read between the lines
Your replies are getting old
It's in his eyes, gotta read between the lines
Lies are getting told
Look in his eyes, gotta read between the lines

Hope you don't think you're pullin' one over me
Cause I, I know what's going on
I hope you ain't been plannin' on runnin' me
Cause that, that ain't what I'm on
Hope you don't think you're pullin' one over me
'Cause you'll look up and I'll be gone
Hope you ain't makin' plans on runnin' me
'Cause I read between the lines

Who got ya thinkin' ya ish ain't been stinkin'?
My temperature's peakin' (why is he barely speakin'?)
I'm bustin' his bubble, and he know he in trouble
He's talkin' in doubles (I'm listenin' but hardly believin')
Ch-changin' the story, or tryin' to ignore me
Still reachin' out for me (but still I'm hardly reachin')
Give me a reason to put you back on the line
You've wasted enough time

I had to open my mind
Gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines, lines
You gotta read between the lines
