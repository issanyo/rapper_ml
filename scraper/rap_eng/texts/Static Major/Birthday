[Static]
Oahahohhhhhhhh
Happy birthday baby
Baby, baby, baby

[Verse 1 - Smokey]
Girl when you're with me
You know we ball
For sure
And baby every time I have a ball
With you
So I made reservations for, this special day
Baby
Baby bring your baby oil, and your lingerie
C'mon

[Chorus w/Smokey adlibs]
We got a five star room, the luxury suite
With marble floors, and don't thank me
Cause I did -- I did this for your birthday
All for you, all for you
With a king size bed, the Cognac bar
The sweet TV with the VCR
And I did it -- I did this for your birthday

Yeahahahah, yeah yeah yeah
Whoahowhoa, ahh yeah

[Verse 2 - Black]
I felt like I could break a couple of rooms, for you
That's how I brought myself to buy this expensive room
Let's do it in the jacuzzi
On the balcony, baby, whoahhahhh
Girl let's enjoy this special night
Cause the bill's on me

[Chorus w/Black adlibs]
We got a five star room, the luxury suite
With marble floors, and don't thank me
Cause I did -- I did this for your birthday
(didn't i, didn't i, didn't i
Didn't i do it baby)
With a king size bed, the Cognac bar
The sweet TV with the VCR
And I did it -- I did this for your birthday
(I'm what you want, I'm what you need)

[Bridge x2 - Static]
Let's get on the floor - let's get on the floor
Let's get in the chair - in the chair
On the sink - on the sink
In the bed - in the bed
Back on the rug - back on the rug
In the tub - in the tub
I perform - I perform
Anywhere - anywhere

[Chorus till ride out- w/Playa adlibs]
