So many times
Tell me your favorite and I'll tell you mine

Here we go, Here we go, Here we go, Here we go

Remember when we started having sex
Remember when I first got it wet
Call after call tryin to hook it up
Remember when we thought it was love
Fussin and fightin all of the time
Remember when I said it was mine
I can think of numerous times
On your couch, on your porch, takin my time

I want it like I'm fresh out of jail
I want it like I'm fresh out of jail

You always unlock myself
Oh you know you do me so well
Come before breakfast you know what I want
I like it from the back to the front
You never pulled no stunts
We might make love and then not speak for months

CHORUS:
There's so many times
So many times
We done hooked up, so many times
Tell me your favorite and I'll tell you mine

I want it like I'm fresh out of jail
I want it like I'm fresh out of jail

There's so many times
Tell me your favorite and I'll tell you mine

Remember when we went on the lake
You wasn't scared of the snakes
Out in the woods, nobody but us
There was no reason to rush
Down on the ground, dirt all around
I still remember the sounds
And everytime you wear your braids
I get flashbacks of the day at lake

I want it like I'm fresh out of jail
I want it like I'm fresh out of jail

Cool me down before I melt
You know how good that it felt
In the back of the truck at the mall
So many times I recall
But it I had to choose one
I would go with the day you almost had me sprung

CHORUS:
There's so many times
So many times
We done hooked up, so many times
Tell me your favorite and I'll tell you mine

I want it like I'm fresh out of jail
I want it like I'm fresh out of jail

There's so many times
Tell me your favorite and I'll tell you mine

Moan and Groan on the floor
Tossin, Turnin, and Pushin
To and to the flutish
Being wit you is a fetish
You think it'll stop girl forget it
Positions are invented
I can see us at a weddin
Speaking of you tryin to get it
We both are like magnets
Because we're always attachin
Both of us gotta have it
Plus we keep each other laughin
You never can tell what'll happen
Always stickin and jabbin
All over scratchin and grabbin
I don't think I'll ever break this habit

CHORUS:
There's so many times
So many times
We done hooked up, so many times
Tell me your favorite and I'll tell you mine

I want it like I'm fresh out of jail
I want it like I'm fresh out of jail

There's so many times
Tell me your favorite and I'll tell you mine
