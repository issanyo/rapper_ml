[Verse 1]
So, he got big brown eyes, so he built nice
Oh, comin' on strong, six pack showin'
Oh, he's too cool for his own shoes
Oh, nothin' rude, but way too sure for me!

[Chorus]
He tryna be extra smooth, extra smooth
Extra cool, extra cute
Am I supposed to talk to you, be your boo?
Don't come tryna be extra smooth

[Verse 2]
So, he got line for line, wastin' my time
Oh, frontin' in the ride tryna catch my eye
Disturbin' my groove tryna be smooth
Get the boot
Boy you can go 'head
And work on yourself another quick romance
A little too hot for me
You act like you already got the number

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish you quit tryna be
Extra smooth, extra smooth
Extra cool, extra cute
If I'm supposed to talk to you, be your boo
Don't come tryna be

[Hook]
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
(See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth)
Extra, extra, extra cool
(See he tryna be, see he tryna be cool)
I won't talk to you, won't be your boo
(Talk to you, won't be your boo)
Extra, extra, extra
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth

[Instrumental]

[Hook]
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
(See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth)
Extra, extra, extra cool
(See he tryna be, see he tryna be cool)
I won't talk to you won't be your boo
(Talk to you, won't be your boo)
Extra, extra, extra
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth

Trya be extra, extra, extra smooth
(See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth)
Extra, extra, extra cool
(See he tryna be, see he tryna be cool)
I won't talk to you, won't be your boo
(Talk to you, won't be your boo)
Extra, extra, extra
Trya be extra, extra, extra smooth

[Outro]
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
Extra, extra, extra cool
I won't talk to you, won't be your boo
Extra, extra, extra
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
