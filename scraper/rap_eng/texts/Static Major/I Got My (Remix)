[Intro: Static Major]
Tip it, ah, ah, tip it good
Ah, sip it, ah, sip it, sip it, sip it, sip it, sip it
Tip it, ah, ah, tip it good

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Haha, let's roll, baby
I got them greens and them yellows
And them purples and that purple
In my duffle like I'm in a Playaz Circle
And homie you's a square, that's why yo' girl in my circle
When I be killin' these hoes and she just another murder
I should be arrested, I should be molested
I told you I'm the best and that should not be contested
Flow so sick, how could you not be infected?
I got that dope dick, how could she not be injected?

[Hook: Static Major]
I got my, tailor made suit
I got my, rims on shine
I got my, goons in the cut
I got my, ahhhhhhhh 'ey

[Verse 2: Static Major]
Party like a rockstar, Russian cut rocks y'all
Yeah I got that gwap y'all, lookin' for a hot broad
And she can get knocked off
Once we get our rocks off, it's a UPS drop off
I'm ridin' with the top off aka Boss Hog
They said I was a lost cause, naww
I'm ridin' with the top off aka Boss Hog
Watch me brush them haters off

[Hook]
I got my, tailor made suit
I got my, rims on shine
I got my, dobbs with the feather
I got my, purple in the bag
I got my, bottle on ice
I got my, first class tickets
I got my, goons in the cut
I got my... block on hot, hey!

[Verse 3: Static Major]
First I valet the car, check into my five-star
Ho-tel, oh well
I got five hundred horses on four wheels
And the ice around my neck'll give ya cold chills (chill)
Brrrr! aka Eskimo
Grew up on dixie loaf, but now it's just filet mignon (non)
Ah, I chase it with a lobster tail
I insist I got the bill, I got the bi-yahye-yahye-ill

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We gone play it like we at the fiesta
I go in hard at the grand Casin-a
Flippin' chips to all my mamamitas
..let me see you shake your keista

[Lil' Wayne]
Check it, shawty do what I want
Who I want, how I want
The way I want, when I want
Even when I don't and now I do
So gimme you, all I want for you to do, and all I want for you to do
All I want for you to do is me, heh!
So dig that, find a shovel, dig that
I say I'll just take the hit and you can take the weed back
You can make 'em in fact, if you keep me intact
And I'll just play the friend, I got them goons in the back

[Hook]

HEY!
