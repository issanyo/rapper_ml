[Verse 1: Aaliyah, Ginuwine]
Ooh who keep calling you? (who me)
Boy I ain't scared of you no no
You see I got your number
Tell me who you snuck and
Gave your number to

[Verse 1: Ginuwine]
Ooh your trippin' now

Girl quit fussin' now
No, you can't go
Jumpin' to conclusions
It's ringin'
But that doesn't mean I've been cheatin'
Does it?

[Hook]
Not right now I'm busy
Call me in the morning
Whoa-whoa-ao-ao

They keep callin' in the morning
Whoa-whoa-ao-ao)
That was your final warning
Don't call me in the morning
Whoa-whoa-ao-ao

[Verse 1: Aaliyah, Ginuwine]
Who keeps buggin' you? (who me)
Or who's been lovin' you?
Tell me
Are you..."Are You That Somebody?"
Or is it you've been lovin'
On somebody else

[Verse 2: Ginuwine]
Woo what the hell
