I got a car a J-O-B
I'm an independent man God is blessing me
A lot of girls that I can call
9 times out of 10 I don't call them at all
The fun and games are overdue
I miss having someone to answer to
I got a house I got a key
There's one more thing that I really need

I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause I'll be your man plus your friend (Well here I am)
I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause we can be lovers and friends (Well here I am)

I saw you out with all the guys
I love the way you look with those big brown eyes yeah
And if it were up to me
We'd both run away and start a family
And on a scale from 1 to 10
I'm giving you 11 boy you're worth that much
Only you can rescue me
I will provide anything you need

I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause I'll be your man plus your friend (Well here I am)
I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause we can be lovers and friends (Well here I am)
