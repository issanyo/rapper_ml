[Intro]
Erica Kane

[Verse 1]
She's back on the streets
A fee for the night
Fill you with grief
She cuts like a knife

Make you do things that no others could do
She’ll turn a professor into a fool
Oh, she ain't hard to get
The girl gets around
And those that she met
They're destined to drown
She'll make ya change like you’d never believe
She’ll turn a working man into thief
Oh

[Chorus]
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica
(Erica Kane)
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
(yo yo)
She's Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica
(Erica Kane)

[Verse 2]
Oh, back on the block
She's at it again
She'll be your friend
As long as you spend
I know she’s torn whole familes apart
She’ll shoot a poison arrow straight through your heart

Oh, this is the day for Erica Kane
There's nothing to lose
None for her to gain
She'll make a honest man steal from his folks
And drain a million man til’ he go broke

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge]
I really don't think you should mess around
(I really wish that you wouldn’t mess around)
Cause all she'll do
(All that she can do is bring you down)
And there's nothing for you to gain
(There’s nothing to gain)
And she goes by this name

[Chorus: x2]
