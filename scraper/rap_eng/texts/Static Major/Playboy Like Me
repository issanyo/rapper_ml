Whoa, babygirl
You ain't been with someone like this
Had chills like this
Tell me how would it feel
You know what

Bet you ain't never
Never met a playboy like me
I'll lick you from head to toe
First thing in the morning, morning
Before you know it
Girl you be shaking at the knees
I know my love's off the hease
You better believe it shorty
You can say I'm like drugs
Cause after I've given my love
Girl I bet you be fiending, fiending
I have them things
Recognize that I am that man
I hope you've been peeping game
I'm trying to tell you baby

I know you ain't never
Met a playboy like me
I know cause you cuss a lot
And with me you're smiling, yeah
My love don't play
(This is your lucky day)
Ooh girl I can hardly wait
Wait to see you shorty
And so it seems
(You've been moping around)
Don't let yourself get you down
(Don't get discouraged baby)
Ooh baby I got you
(Better days headed your way)
I think we should celebrate
I bet you ain't ready baby

I know you ain't never
Never met a playboy like me
I bet you've been cheated
Don't worry I got you covered shorty
I know I ain't perfect
From head to toe I'm real as can be
And I know I'm up in your mind
Lovin' is on your mind

Never known a playboy like me
Let me sweep you off your feet
I know how to get you heated shorty
Send you chills from your head to your feet
You best to believe it girl

Never met a playboy like me
