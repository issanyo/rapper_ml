[Verse 1: Yaushameen]
Met a nigga in this chat room in Yahoo
Said meet him at the saloon at high noon
At the corner of a market in June
With the option of coping a room
How i'm already knowing that
He’s tryin' to persuade me
Generously tryin' to penetrate me
Wanna run and stop me
Wanted me to ride him
How dare he try to put a price on me
It is I the great one
And that’s an understatement
Had to stay to steps ahead of him
Give a hell about the ice, or the rose, or the rims
Or the house at the lake with the Benz
I'm as priceless as priceless gems
I'ma fight for the right for the fends
Just for the sake of these niggas like him, do you feel me?

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
I, pulled up to the bar in my halter top
And I'm lookin hot, we hit the spot
So many eyes on me
Yau-sha-meen, did you see what i just seen in them jeans?
Said he caught my eye (Eye)
Took a double take (Date)
Let's double date
Pick a place, go ballin' and outta control
Drive him home, use my phone
Call Tyrone, and tell 'em

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Yaushameen]
Me and my girlfriends
We talk like y'all do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don’t do? (Don’t do)
Me and my girlfriends (Girlfriends)
We make creep calls too
And if you start actin' up
We got someone else to fall to
Me and my girlfriends
We talk like y’all do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don't do? (Don't do)
Me and my girlfriends (Girlfriends)
We make creep calls too
And if you never start actin up
We got someone else to fall to
Me and my girlfriends

[Verse 3: Yaushameen]
We can double date 'em, shake ’em, heartbreak 'em
I'll say i'ma like em, and just
Let em keep on kickin' it, fakin'
For goodness sake'n
We gon'
Never gonna catch no feelings
These dealings are awful phony
Willin' to get somethin' poppin'
Don't clock when they'll be no panties droppin'
Huh

[Verse 4: Aaliyah]
I'm a big old flirt, in a mini skirt
Hey muscle shirt, get your feelings hurt
Don't get to cozy with me
Pri-va-cy, we don't need
We'll be just conversating
On a scale of 10 (10), he's a solid 5
Tryin' to get some play
No, not today
So sorry I gotta go
Don't he know?
Head to toe (To toe)
I ain't feel nothin' but his clothes?

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Yaushameen]
Me and my girlfriends
We talk like y'all do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don't do? (Don't do)
Me and my girlfriends (Girlfriends)
We make creep calls too
And if you start actin' up
We got someone else to fall to
Me and my girlfriends
We talk like y'all do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don't do? (Don't do)
Me and my girlfriends (Girlfriends)
We make creep calls too
And if you never start actin up
We got someone else to fall to
Me and my girlfriends

[Verse 5: Yaushameen]
What? (x4)
We talk y'all (Y'all)
We creep like y'all (Y'all)
We ball like y'all (Y'all)
Like this (x5)
We're undeniable
We talk like you do
We ball just like you do (No denying it)
We get numbers too
We creep just like you do (Sure your proud of it?)
We pick out the studs (uhh x2)
We creep just like guys (you know he's hiding it)
We do just like you
We do like you do
