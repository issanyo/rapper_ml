I got a question for you, tell me is it true?
True that you're mine, all mine then let's put it on the line
I wanna kiss from you 'cause I see all the girls in our business
Is this silly of me? I want the whole world to see

Suga, see I'm just testin' our love for the record
Just testin' our love
Ohh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record
[Incomprehensible] ohh suga

Don't you get funny with me, give me your hand, let me hold it
Do you have got something to hide or maybe too much pride?
You say I'm the only one, doesn't show as good as you tell it
I want the world to see that you're happy with me

Suga, see I'm just testin' our love for the record
Just testin' our love
Ohh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record
[Incomprehensible]

Suga, see I'm just testin' our love for the record
Just testin' our love
Ohh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record
[Incomprehensible] suga

Got us testing

Suga, see I'm just testin' our love for the record
Just testin' our love
Ohh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record
[Incomprehensible]

Suga see, I'm just testing our love for the record
Just testing our love
Ohh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record
[Incomprehensible] suga
