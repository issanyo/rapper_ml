[Chorus]
La la la, la la la, la la
When you're lovin' me, when you're lovin' me (oh)
Baby, when you're lovin' me (oh yeah)
La la la, la la la, la la
There ain't no place I'd rather be (no)
There ain't no place I'd rather be

[Verse 1]
Time goes by and the days get long, but still
Our love keeps goin' strong
Each and every moment, of my time with you is so sweet
Boy, you bring out the best in me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's about me (mhmm)
And it's about you (it's about you)
It's about [?]
And the things we wanna do
You know, nothin' really matters as long as I'm with you
Oh baby, you make me say

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la, la la (ooh)
When you're lovin' me, when you're lovin' me
Baby, when you're lovin' me
You make me say
La la la, la la la, la la
There ain't no place I'd rather be (no)
There ain't no place I'd rather be

[Verse 2]
I feel I got the morning in
Each time I look at you smile
Boy, it feels so good (when you're holding me)
I don't wanna ever (see, I don't lose this love), uh uh
Every night I pray, the love will forever
Be here in my world
'Cause I believe (I believe in eternity, oh)
In eternity with me
Me as your girl
'Cause you make me say

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la, la la (la la la la la)
When you're lovin' me (la la la la la), when you're lovin' me
Baby, when you're lovin' me (baby)
La la la, la la la, la la (baby, yeah)
There ain't no place I'd rather be
I can't get you off my mind, oh baby
There ain't no place I'd rather be

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la, la la (la la la la la)
When you're lovin' me, (when you're lovin' me) when you're lovin' me
Baby, when you're lovin' me
La la la, la la la, la la (oh)
There ain't no place I'd rather be (there ain't no place, baby)
There ain't no place I'd rather be

[Bridge]
Before the day you came around
I never knew what love was
I knew you had to be right for me
Because your face was in my dreams
You got it goin' on in every way
And you know that I like it
There's just one thing I want to say

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la, la la
When you're lovin' me, (oh, I can't get you out my mind) when you're lovin' me
Baby, when you're lovin' me (oh baby)
La la la, la la la, la la (oh)
There ain't no place I'd rather be (la la la la aah aah)
There ain't no place I'd rather be (oh yeah)

[Outro]
Everyday, you make me say
