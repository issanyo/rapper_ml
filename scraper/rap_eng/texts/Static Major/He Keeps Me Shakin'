[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Hey there, you nasty boy, it's been a minute (minute)
And I could say my life has changed, since you hit it, (hit it)
This is your strongest trait, you work the middle (middle)
While they say I’m sprung, I'll say, maybe a little

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Keeps me shakin' (keeps me shakin)
He keeps me shakin’ (mm)
Your love makin'
It keeps me shakin'
Got me chasin'
He must be taken
I ain't hatin'
Cause I like shakin'

(instrumental break)

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Keeps me shakin'
He keeps me shakin’
Your love makin’
It keeps me shakin'
Got me chasin’
He must be taken
I ain't hatin'
'Cause I like shakin’
