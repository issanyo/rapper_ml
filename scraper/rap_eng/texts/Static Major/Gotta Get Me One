Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one, yeah
So I can creep up on her
So I can ease up on her
So I can get touchy feely (touchy feely)
Put a dip in your back
And get me one slow jam

Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one, yeah
So I can creep up on her (creep up on her)
Everybody's trying to get with somethin'
Can I get one slow jam

[Verse 1: Twista]
When it come to ballin I do it with no hands
Left the Lamborghini home and took the Brougham (damn)
I think the club finna close man
But I be the Twista; you know how I be doing it with the slow jams
Take a look at the shawty chilling by the door man
I'm really into her persona cause she don't be taking drama
But she thick; when I ask her where she get it then she say she get it from her mama
So I think I'mma (what)
Pop champagne cause the glass tall
The bartender said it was the last call
I told her give it to me fast so we can slow dance
And I can put my hands on her ass (yes)
And she like it when I hold and grip, control them hips
And you know I like it when she get low and dip
Plenty swagger when she move slow and sip
When they cut the lights on you gon roll with the Twist
Lookin so lovely in the fit you got on
But it don't matter if you was in a dress or you was in some jeans (nope)
Fragrance by Adidas, purse from another country, look at you, girl, you doin your thing!
Everybody leaving with somebody and I gotta get me somebody so I be doin' what I do
Gotta get me one too; before the night go I tell the maestro "that's your cue!"

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Static Major]
When I get on my way to the floor
Baby, hold on to my shoulders
Girl, I won't let you fall
Just hold on to my shoulders

[Verse 2: Twista]
She was lookin nice
Too hot for the Cardi, yeah, she'll melt the ice
Lil mama kinda like Rihanna, she was livin the life
She be givin advice
But just to have an orgasm she gotta get a device
What's that for?  Is your man a boy?
Cause he don't know how to give you what you're here for
I think I gotta show you what the pilot gear for
And the question is "What I'll whisper in your ear for?"
You nasty, love to be on top
Mad if I pop, if you miss the drop
You nasty, how you made me choke you
Told me I can put it anywhere I want to
Sex so good she do it with no hands
I met you while the DJ was playin the slow jam
As soon as we got into it (into the slow dance)
Is the beginnin of when I was feelin the romance
Now I be Twista with the super tight flow, one might go, that's so true
I gotta get me one; before the night go I tell the maestro "that's your cue!"

[Outro: Static Major] (2x)
What happened to the slow jams in the club?
The DJs don't play them anymore
I used to meet the ladies on the floor
And wait for the DJ to play one
