[Verse 1]
I still got your picture, in the frame
Still staring at you, looking in your eyes
Still wondering where you are (where you are)
And wonder who you with
I still be hanging at the clubs we used to be at

[Chorus]
And I swore saw your face
But it was just an illusion
I thought I saw your face
But I couldn't find you nowhere
I could've sworn I say your face
It was just an illusion
I thought I saw your face
But I couldn't find you nowhere

[Verse 2]
Said I had a vision, from the past
When we meet at the Embassy Suites
Said I use to stay there, all the time
I go back every now and then

[Chorus]
And I swore saw your face
But it was just an illusion
I thought I saw your face
But I couldn't find you nowhere
I could've sworn I say your face
It was just an illusion
I thought I saw your face
But I couldn't find you nowhere

[Hook]
Say my mind's playing tricks on me
Say my mind's playing tricks on me
My mind is playing tricks on me
My mind, my mind
My mind playing tricks on me
Somebody put a hex on me
My mind playing tricks on me
My mind, my mind

[Chorus]
And I swore saw your face
But it was just an illusion
I thought I saw your face
But I couldn't find you nowhere
I could've sworn I say your face
It was just an illusion
I thought I saw your face
But I couldn't find you nowhere
