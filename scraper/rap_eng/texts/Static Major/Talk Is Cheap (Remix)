[Intro: Cassius]

Can I?, Baby?
Can I?, Baby?
Can I?, Baby?

[Verse 1: Cassius]

Where you stay at?
You know I don't play that
Hop on the express, just to come lay back
You been acting very, very distant lately
I been starting to think that you might hate me, now
Why you wanna play games with all my emotions?

[Hook: Aaliyah + Cassius]

Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

[Verse 2: Cassius]

I notice you don't pick up
I notice you don't want my heart no more
After you thief it like stick up
I seen you out in Brighton Beach with them niggas
You know I put my wheats to them niggas
You know you gotta teach me how to be the best for you
Can't just cut me out the picture
You could come eat with me
Make your choice, who you wanna be?

[Hook: Aaliyah + Cassius]

Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

[Verse 3]

Move my body, come and get this work
Baby, overdose like you sipped the purp
You gon' oochie wally when I lift your shirt
Make sure that I gets it first
Keep your timbs on, and your Jesus piece
Papi get inside, you don't need a lease
Put your mouth on me like you got to eat
I know you uptown

Show me some new shit
Yeah, I'm the witch, you the broomstick
Yeah, Ima fuck you till you lose it
When your alarm ring, you gon' snooze it
Ima give you everything choose it
Anything you want you could have it
You gon' wanna
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it, turn it, leave it, stop, format it

[Hook: Aaliyah + Cassius]

Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

Turn me on, turn me on
