[Verse 1]
I can be in New York
I can be in LA
I can be in the A
I'll still be checking on ya
And seeing if we
Can get a little closer
Baby can I come over
I'll be ya special kind of friend
I'll be ya special kind of lover

You know I'll be there
I'll be there when you wake up
I'll be there in the evening time
I'll be there, be there, be there
I'll be there when you need me

[Chorus]
I know a lot of girls
Said I been all around the world
Still I keep running back
Running back, running back to ya
I can't put my finger on it
Cuz it's something, something
Something got me running back
Running back, running back to ya

[Verse 2]
See the seasons may change
But I'll remain the same
Even through stormy weather
Can we be together
I wanna know where I stand
Because I wanna be your man
Said I wanna hold and kiss your hand
Will that be alright
One of these nights
Can I put you on a high
Cloud nine is right around the corner

[Chorus]
I know a lot of girls
Said I been all around the world
Still I keep running back
Running back, running back to ya
I can't put my finger on it
Cuz it's something, something
Something got me running back
Running back, running back to ya

[Hook]
Honey love, honey love
I can't wait to get back to my honey love
What I'm serving up
Butter love, butter love
I can't wait to get back to my butter love
I can't get enough

[Chorus]
I know a lot of girls
Said I been all around the world
Still I keep running back
Running back, running back to ya
I can't put my finger on it
Cuz it's something, something
Something got me running back
Running back, running back to ya
