[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I still pour purple in my Sprite
Real candy paint and them lights [?]
How the fuck the H fall off when niggas everywhere like where we like
Keep a country chick on my right
Shotgun when you see me rolling
I'm a vet to my bitch in my ride
You gonna see all that shit holding
Them Texas boys be glowing
Got diamonds all in they mouth
We came out shining got niggas buying they diamonds outta that South
Sitting in the slab like I'm sitting on the couch
Shitting on boys every time I pull out
I'm a real nigga, real niggas gon' boss [?]
Come to the H you gon' see we bomb on
31 retired, my bitches like Maliah[?}
Some thick, some slim but all they head and pussy fire
Been pimping since before Still Tippin
Thugga still slab gripping while you niggas still simping (Thugga!)

[Hook]
Creepin, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Look who creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Creep-creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Look who creeping, look who crawling
Look who creeping, look who crawling
Look who creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Look who creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Creep-creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Look who creeping, look who crawling
Look who creeping, look who crawling

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Well let me creep and let me crawl, it's the champ Paul Wall
All that hating is futile I keep my paper on file
Got the screens falling down, they clumsy just like a child
Incredible is the smile, interior reptile
My batting average is horrible cause I swang too much
You can take a picture but oh baby, please don't touch
Out here walking around with a limp
I be leaning with no crutch
Nah these hoes can't fade me, but they pay me we going dutch
So that dutch is what I clutch
Cause that hating's such a [?]
You need to get up off of our nuts
I'm on my grind getting them bucks
And you a fool if you think I ain't
Out here chasing after that bank
Go and get it until I can't
And then it's back to the city of drank

[Hook]
Look who creeping look who crawling still balling in the mix
Look who creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Creep-creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Look who creeping, look who crawling
Look who creeping, look who crawling
Look who creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Look who creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Creep-creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
Look who creeping, look who crawling
Look who creeping, look who crawling

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I'm representing that South
Boys with gold teeth in they mouth
Ones with gold chains on they neck
Boys that roll in streets with respect
Chunk a deuce and keeping it G
Chuck a fo' up in a two-liter
Clip on full inside a new heater
Fuck your gal as soon as I meet her
Send the homies soon as I'm done
Bust your bitch just like she's my gun
Bust my gun wherever I got her
Trill OG, yeah top shotter
Recognize me as a don dada
Kiss my ring and kneel before God [?]
Get off the dick and back on your job
It's that land of the trill we go hard
And my squad ain't playing no games
They go gladiator it's no thang [?]
Get you outta the box and your frame [??]
Get up outta your socks with no shame [???]
Best that you can do is maintain
Ain't no ground to gain on this side
Everybody down with me is gonna ride
Everybody down with you is gonna hide (bitch!)
