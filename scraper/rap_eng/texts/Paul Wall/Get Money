[Intro: Paul Wall **Pitbull**]
Bitch, we going down
Paul Wall, the people's champ
Out in Stores
**That's that little chico Pitbull**
**It's the bottom mate**
Between what they talk right
**DJ Ideal!**
DJ Ideal, what they do

[Hook: Pitbull]
I'm running laps on these boys
I don't even gotta pull gats on these boys
These boys like 7-Eleven
They don't mean crap to this boy
24/7, my money stack on these boys
I'm coming from the bottom
Harold-smacking these boys

I'm running laps on these boys
I don't even gotta pull gats on these boys
These boys like 7-Eleven
They don't mean crap to this boy
24/7, my money stack on these boys
I'm coming from the bottom
Harold-smacking these boys

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Growing up I had my fair share of family problems
Now I'm grown, touch my family if you want a problem
I'm a die hard fan of, making money
Now my money makes me money, now I'm making money
Everyday I thank god that I'm making money
Is your friend a foe, will you ride or rode
This is the life I chose, no longer selling oz
El Mariel, with God's help boy, it will blow
I've attained, the unattainable
Done, the unimaginable
It's unbelievable like B.I.G when he died a passenger
I think B.I.G ride with God as a passenger
Keep hating while I'm passing ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Paull Wall]
It's Paul Wall from the Swisha House beat
I've only been grinding and hustling, since I was six
Remember back in the days, I used to drink tabs
Now I buying at the bar, baby put it on my tab
I'm a national prospect, like my boy Brandy Washington
I'm sipping on that bar, so you never see me coughing
I've never had a cavity, you know I stay flossing
And Imma keep hustling 'til they put me in the coffin
I got some good advice from box and papa Joe
If I swallow all my pride then my bliss is to blow
I shoot a kite to my dawg Roger
Locked up in the form, he doing 45
Hey, got him tatted on my arm
Catch me at the sky bar, posted low key
Reminiscing 'bout the old school with my OG's
If you waiting for me to fly, the JTRL
I can buy my sound skins, so you know Imma sell
I got an album called the People's Champ, In stores now
I got them diamonds in my mouth, baby bling bling bow
It's Paul Wall baby, representing Swisha House
Y'all already know, umm, it's going down

[Hook]

[Outro: Paul Wall & Pitbull]
(Paul Wall)
Hey, if you trying to get a grill in your mouth
Fuck with this TV jewelry
832-661-5664
832-661-5664 baby
Where they do all that custom jewelry
Top quality diamonds
You know what I'm talking bout
I let my boy TV done it
Paul Wall, the people's champ baby

(Pitbull)
Lassarito, I appreciate the love
Khaled, I appreciate the love
Ideal always, true what they do
Mike Calderon come pinga, que bola
Juan filipi come mierda, que bola
Julio mamatranca, que bola
Look out for El Mariel coming out
Spanish Album behind it coming out
Called Armando, so ya tu sabe
Preparase porque la cosa va esta fea
Dale joputa que bola con Pit
