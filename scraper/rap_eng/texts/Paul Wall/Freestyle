They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot:
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge
