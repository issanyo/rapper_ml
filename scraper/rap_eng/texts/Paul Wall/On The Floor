[Intro: Paul Wall]
It's all live, [?] a player when I enter the club
I'm tryin' to find a little mama for some part time love
And you just the right type, just the right size
I'm diggin' your demeanor with your deep brown eyes
You turn me on like a light switch
I'm just tryin' to groove a little good without stepping on my white piece
I really like the way you look in them pants
Just follow me to the floor and let's dance, tell 'em J

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
What's a dime like you holdin' up the wall for
You should be dancin'
You should be dancin'
All the guys in the spot better yet
Nobody had the nerve to talk to you
So let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
You lookin' good from your head
Down to your shoes girl
What's your name and who you with
And do you got a name
I can't believe that you came in by yourself girl
But if it's up to me I'd guarantee
That you won't leave here alone

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Oh oh oh
Your body's like whoa
Oh oh oh
I'm trying to get you on the floor
Oh oh oh
You already know what it is
So girl stop acting and get to dancing
Oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Now quit playing
Come on get in the groove
Back it up, get low
Let your body move girl
The DJ's playing my song
I've been waiting all night long
And I'm glad to be dancin' with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You looking good from your head down to your shoes girl
'Cause the way that you're grinding
Has got me in a trance girl
I can't believe that you came in by yourself girl
If it was up to me I'd guarantee
That you won't leave alone

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Yo body's like whoa
Oh oh oh
I'm trying to get you on the floor
Oh oh oh
You already know what it is
So girl stop acting and get to dancing
Oh oh oh

[Bridge]
Girl I know that you want to
So let's stop wasting time
And let's dance all night
'Cause I know what you want
And I got what you need
So girl just come with me
I wanna make it good for you

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I know you're tired of fellas all up in your face
But I can't [?] no time to waste
You babysittin' your drink, go on and take a sip
Let me see you shake somethin' girl, move them hips
I must admit, I'm captivated by your style
I can tell you sweet things that would make you smile
I'm Paul Wall, you're makin' all my hormones rise
Can I [?] or get lost in your eyes
You're lookin' real good, baby girl, you already know
I'm tryin' to get you on the floor, let's go

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Your body's like whoa
Oh oh oh
I'm trying to get you on the floor
Oh oh oh
You already know what it is
So girl stop acting and get to dancing
Oh oh oh

Your body's like whoa
Oh oh oh
I'm trying to get you on the floor
Oh oh oh
You already know what it is
So girl stop acting and get to dancing
Oh oh oh

Your body's like whoa
Oh oh oh
I'm trying to get you on the floor
Oh oh oh
You already know what it is
So girl stop acting and get to dancing
Oh oh oh
