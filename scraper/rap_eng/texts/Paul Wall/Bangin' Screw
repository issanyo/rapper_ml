[Intro]
(Fire!)
(Hey!)

[Hook - Paul Wall]
I got that trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (hey)
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (uh-huh)
Comin down so fly-y-y-y
Smokin leaf so high-igh-igh-igh
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (cheah)

[Verse 1 - Paul Wall]
What it do, it's Paul to the Wall
Trunk up tall, let the four screens fall
Spider's crawl, gon' turn up the dial
And the heads all nod like a bobble-head doll
Bendin corners up and down Wayside
From Greens Road to that Antoine Drive
Crew on the side playin NBA Live
I'm too cool for school, ridin on buckhide
Turnin heads when I'm on that Scott
Hit that French's for a quick pit stop
Boys in the mail talkin about they on top
Eight months later, all them boys flop
Like it or not, I'm in the game and I'm showin up
Keke got that oil and we pourin up
Hit the club
With Captain Jack and Big Steve representin my hood -
Still throwin up
Big money in the game, cause the bread grow
Candy oldschool droptop, for the ho
Boys used to be sleepin on me, but The Champ is here
I guarantee that they ass woke
Ridin on spokes, that's the elbow
Still rockin in the ice white shell toe
This for my boys for that Kelso
And you already know

[Hook]
I got that trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (hey)
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (uh-huh)
Comin down so fly-y-y-y
Smokin leaf so high-igh-igh-igh
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (cheah)

[Verse 2 - Paul Wall]
Yeah, I'm still on that 59
But might see me on the 58, comin down
All over the town, I like to get around
Jammin my 'Fat Pat' screwed up underground
Comin down in the lime green '88
While them boys on the sideline wanna hate
Bumpin Kid Paul, fuckin up the state plate
I must admit my life's great
T. Ferris with me in the snow bunny Benz
Lookin through a Louie lens and we stackin up ends
Bros over hoes, yeah I'm talkin about friends
Got 'Freedom' on my arm for my dog Lil' Twin
Dub on the rim, that's TIS
Just like Pretty Todd I'm 'G-Boy Fresh'
Got oil comin in, and it's straight from the West
And the grill chrome mesh on the Cadillac crest
Head of the best, I ain't messin with the rest
Santa Claus sled, that's pomegranate red
Sippin the taste, I take it straight to the head
And the Swishahouse what I rep 'til I'm dead

[Hook]
I got that trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (hey)
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (uh-huh)
Comin down so fly-y-y-y
Smokin leaf so high-igh-igh-igh
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (cheah)

[Verse 3 - Paul Wall]
I'm tippin fo's and I'm sippin fo's
And I'm flippin hoes with my partner, Clue
Posted up at that TSU
Or that Prairie View with my partner, Lew
Hawk
Boys get outlined in chalk
Tryin to run up and jack my slab
This one here for my boy Lil Ke
I'm throwin the deuce up and givin boys dab
Pourin the juice up and grippin that Ave
Wavin hood so the bass showcase
Settin the trends, steady choppin up wind
With a diamond ice grin
That paper I chase
Take a fade by that Bad Boy Shop
Tip up slow, I'm screwed up and chopped
Listenin to some of that Robert Earl or them Choppaholics
Maybe that Michael Watts
Choppin the block up
Holdin a full cup
Breakin a strut
Now I'm on new swang
Grill and woman popped trunk full of bang
I'm third coast raised
And I'm drippin stain
I'm hittin stank, tryna break that bread
Slowed and throwed 'til the day I'm deceased
Leanin tough
I got a cup full of stuff
With a starched crease
And a Johnny Dang piece

[Hook]
I got that trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (hey)
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (uh-huh)
Comin down so fly-y-y-y
Smokin leaf so high-h-h-h
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw
Slowly rollin, I'm bangin screw (cheah)

[Outro]
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Cheah!)
