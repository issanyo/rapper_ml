Hey, yeah
Come on, let's go
Let's go, come on, let's go
Konvict, hey

She said she wanna go, go, go, go
Back with me to the mo, mo
Wanna ride on them fo's, fo's
Player's get yours, girl, let's roll

Head to toe, fasho, you cold
Me and you like diamonds and gold
You got a partner for Colby O
Lil' mama you looking cold

Why these other girls on my jock?
Always talking 'bout what I got
That's what we like to call a bop
Girl, you know that you looking hot

All them other broads need to stop
Have a seat while I drop the top
Come on, let's roll back to my spot
Your world's about to get rocked

(Uh, oh)
You live in this lane, your body's insane
You wanna do the motion like the ocean, hey
(Uh, oh)
And I'm gonna do what you want me to, girl
Hey

All you gotta do is let me know, me know, me know
And I promise that I won't say no, say no, say no
Said she wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Said she wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

(Uh oh)
A hint of the life, a sweet paradise
It's all the things I'm laying on the plate for you

(Uh oh)
I don't wanna stall off from girl at all
I just wanna be with you

All you gotta do is let me know, me know, me know
And I promise that I won't say no, say no, say no
Said she wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Said she wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

(Uh, oh)
Nice thick frame off the chain
Damn, you look good, what's your name?
Sweetest candy cane, thick like cookie dough
Down at bank watch so the wrist glow

Miss so and so move like a yo yo
Up down get low, stop, go
Baby got more back than a little bit
Apple bottom main brand you a little thick

(Uh, oh)
Top pick super fly bad chick
Drop down to the flo' low like a bumper kit
Same color as a Reese's cup peanut butter on your skin
Yes, that's what's up

(Uh, oh)
So soft like ice cream, hot like chicken wing
How the hell did you fit in them jeans?
Bouncing up and down like a spring
Come on over and join the team and let's go

Said she wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Said she wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Said she wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Said she wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Uh, oh
Uh, oh
Uh, oh
