[Chorus: T.Y.]
Shit I like to get high to the point it feel like I can fly
It's just what it is I don't know why
I don't bossed up on so many niggas ran through so many hoes
Counting money til' my hands swole

[Verse 1: T.Y.]
Ain't nothing but a mother fucking G thang
Rolling up this weed while my nigga Paul swangin
H-Town flossed out, bitch I get around
Tipping on fours yea a nigga comin' down
Excuse my paint 'cause my shit super wet
Light hit the flakes watch em shine like baguettes
Son of a Gangsta mother fucker you gon' respect
I'm young, but I'm more than a vet
I gets money hoe
And all this thumbing through these hundreds they make my hands swole
I got a whip that bitch could sit high and low
Pinky rings and thumbs nigga you know how we roll
I hear a lot of shit but I don't ever see it though
Bussin them moves, 'cause I gotta fill up some shoes
But Imma lace 'em, and watch a nigga walk through
Never showing no love to a bopper
And you better watch who you call your patnas

[Chorus: T.Y.](x2)
Shit I like to get high to the point it feel like I can fly
It's just what it is I don't know why
I don't bossed up on so many niggas ran through so many hoes
Counting money til' my hands swole

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
All I do is smoke kush, stunt and get money
10 racks all 20's count 500
Drank thicker than some honey it ain't never running
Diamonds brighter than 3:00, my neck look sunny
I hit I-10, H-Town to New Orleans
Full of marijuana and lean, (?)
Hit the scene, go gleam I'm muddy as a stream
Getting paper no strings, and share with the team
I never been a hater 'cause I'm player made
Top down no shade but never throwing shade
I gotta get out and get it 'cause it ain't nothing free
The only thing free to a playa is the penitentiary
3-2 said it best, Cadillac on the crest
T.Y. and Paul Wall on a quest
A real hustler in the flesh
One time for all my patnas in the crest
We smoking satellite, blessed
Never stressed

[Chorus: T.Y.](x2)
Shit I like to get high to the point it feel like I can fly
It's just what it is I don't know why
I don't bossed up on so many niggas ran through so many hoes
Counting money til' my hands swole
