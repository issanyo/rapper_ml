[Hook: Beatking (Paul Wall)]
Working that wheel, working that wheel
(Cup don't spill)
Bitch I'm working that wheel, working that wheel
(Cup don't spill)
Bitch I'm working that wheel, on my dick is that steel
On my dick is that steel, jackers get killed

Bitch Swang on them hoes, swang on them hoes
Yeah swang on them hoes, swang on them bitches, I'm rich hold up
Swang on them hoes, swang on them hoes
Swang on them hoes, swang on them bitches, I'm rich hold up

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Swang on them hoes, fresher than vogues
Trunk in the air with the neon's exposed
Coming down candy [?] 4's
Bitch I'm the man, I'm too trip for you hoes
Look at these punks, look at my trunk
Blocking the traffic, I drive when I want
[?]
Load [?] up, if a hater jump
[?] watch how you handle me
Bitch I'm too trill, never fake how can I be?
Walk away our pockets fat as a manatee
Probably cause I grind like there's 10 in me
Tin it up not rented, sprayed it 3 times but I ain't finished
Swung on a pot hole,  4 got dented
4 in the cup came straight from the clinic
Whip this wrist this not a test
Me and King fish right and drop a wrist
You looking at a Slab God in the flesh
If it ain't complete then I'm not impressed
Pressing them buttons, swanging them buttons
[?] with the diamonds floodin'
Riding on 16's just passed [?]
Jacky in the rear view all of a sudden
I'm

[Verse 2: Beatking]
Club god I'm the truth, my slab ain't got no roof
My trunk sit obtuse, It was installed by Jesus
I will swing on your main bitch and them ratchet hoe she hang with
I just bought a car made by Google
I type in my destination and it take me to that bitch
My trunk go up and down like a bitch ass on Instagram
4 clip the half [?] before I hit the ave
These hoes call me Club Godzilla
Texas hammer game, my squad triller
Yo broad in a [?] international side nigga
Club God I got the juice, tryna jack then I shoot
My ho picked up a strong, I'm turning heads on a loot
R.I.P Paul Walker, he got me swanging slow
From the north side to the south side, H Town we bangin' smooth
