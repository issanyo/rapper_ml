So hot she burns like fire
Blue dreams is our desires
She backs it up on to me
I leave the club like
Oooooeeeee!

She's a phenomenon
The way she turns me on
So right but feels so wrong
That's why I wrote this song
She's a phenomenon
The way she turns me on
So right but feels so wrong
That's why I wrote this song

I'm in the A, all day
Mackin' all the girls lookin' my way
No way, she say, that she wanna go all the way
Okay, we can do this
Shawty lookin' good
And she's trying to get to it
Pop a couple drinks girl
We can get stupid
Drop it to the floor
Show me how you move it (move it)

So hot she burns like fire
Blue dreams is our desires
She backs it up on to me
I leave the club like
Oooooeeeee!

She's a phenomenon
The way she turns me on
So right but feels so wrong
That's why I wrote this song
She's a phenomenon
The way she turns me on
So right but feels so wrong

Hello Kitty, Kitty
She's thick and she's pretty
Must have came from out of town
Now I love that city
She can't keep her lips off me
Oh please no hickey
Let me help you with that bra
It looks kind of tricky
That round caboose, so big
It's quite obtuse
She's a beast
That booty is bigger than a moose
Skin tone lookin' like 24 karat gold
Rock it, let's roll
It's all cake, no casserole
Baby got that bigger
And she shake it like she shootin' craps
Smack her like a baller
Now she's going home with me perhaps
Booty thicker than a smoothie
Back it up like you's a freak
Go ahead and bust it up like a greek
Let me see that ass shake

So hot she burns like fire
Blue dreams is our desires
She backs it up on to me
I leave the club like
Oooooeeeee!

She's a phenomenon
The way she turns me on
So right but feels so wrong
That's why I wrote this song
She's a phenomenon

So right but feels so wrong

Yeah, it's goin' down
Shawty like the sound
Now we got the whole world
Talkin' like cellular phones
Full blown, and my style is phenomenal
So I gots to go
All around the world
I'm a A-Town stunna
With my ID as a passport
And you never felt a G like this before
I'm on some other other shit
And she ain't use to it
So she's always on my dick (sorry)

So hot she burns like fire
Blue dreams is our desires
She backs it up on to me
I leave the club like
Oooooeeeee!

She's a phenomenon
The way she turns me on
So right but feels so wrong
That's why I wrote this song
She's a phenomenon
The way she turns me on
So right but feels so wrong
