[Hook]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up a duece and ridin' slab

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Now I gotta work my woodgrain wheel
Poppin' trunks, poppin' pills, still poppin' seals
Higher than a hill with my mind on mill
Piece and chain swangin', bankroll, shiny grill
Baby, I got million dollar dreams, with my mind on cream
I'm in that mean, green machine; clean, on 19s
Flatscreens in the headrest, swingin' like a swingset
Brandywine paint wet, comin' down, that's a bet
I'm in the lot chasin' broads like a lesbian
Full of that kush-flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians
Higher than a streetlight, floatin' like a parachute
Buzzin' like a bumblebee, mustard-green Bentley coupe
Young gangsta mack game sharper than a thumbtack
Breakin' 'em off, makin' all the boppers attract
Then they watch me, I'm rocked up, fully loaded and sloppy
Tryna hit it and quit it and walk off like Big Papi
Break 'em off

[Hook]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up a duece and ridin' slab

[Verse 2: Lil' Keke]
Aye, aye
I pull up like this, untouchable white wrist
I'm hotter than warm piss, berry grape Sunkist
The truck gold mist 550 snow bunny
Bentley Continental with the mink floors dummy
Paul Wall money, that's expensive taste
And them friendly ass fools we send 'em to MySpace
I'mma break 'em off until the backbone broken
Stainless steel drop Phantom, leave the top open
Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose
And the kush done start burnin', better cover your clothes
(That's right)
Concrete crumblin', glass shootin' lasers
Crawlin' and cuttin' up on 24 razors
I'mma show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal
Chasin' paper in the mornin', call me Houston Chronicle
Hold on, then you buckle up the seat belt
SwishaHouse, Young Don, capital TF

[Hook]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up a duece and ridin' slab

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Already
I'm higher than a satellite, crawlin' like a baby
Maneuvering through the traffic like I'm Tracy McGrady
Still choppin' on them buttons, I'm struttin' and lookin' fresh
Switch hittin' like Berkman, this is ballin' at its best
In that Minute Maid dropper with retractable roof
Finer than wood, wavin' the hood, student loans on the tooth
The fifth wheel on the ground
And the trunk in the air
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa
My skills is so ill when workin' that wood wheel
Tippin' 4s like a waiter, beware of the oil spill
Widescreen mindframe, panoramic pimpin'
I'm sippin' on that Osama, baby, leanin' like I'm limpin'
In that two-seater feeder, it's me and a se√±orita
Three ounces up in the liter
And it's ten up in the heater
Mackin' a mamacita
Runnin' game like a cheetah
I'm knockin' 'em out the park similar to Derek Jeter
Break 'em off

[Hook]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up a duece and ridin' slab
