Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ
It ain't easy bein the People's Champ
It's the new me, new me, new me, new me...
True, a lot of struggles I done been through and still goin through
Let me show you what it's like to be me (Paul Wall, Paul Wall baby)

I'm not your average guy, I'm more than meets the eye
I know I'm friendly and fly, but let me tell you why
I was abandoned at an early age
My daddy was a dopefiend, I ain't seen him since the second grade
I sing the same song, baby dad, single mom
I was always in the crawl, yet and still I was alone
I kept my faith in God, even in my younger days
I gave my life to Christ, got down on my knees and prayed
And God answered our prayers and momma remarried
All the burdens she carried, I must admit that it was scary
Somehow I got a real man as my father figure
Thangs started gettin better for my momma and my sister
Pain took me from a boy to a man
I knew I'd make it to the end if I could stick to the plan
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me - Paul Wall baby

[Hook: Paul Wall]
See I've been doin this here for a while
Eventually y'all boys gon' respect me dawg
I'm Paul Wall - until it's over I'ma ball 'til I fall
I'm the greatest in a minute ch'all
Let me tell you if you knew me (knew me) yeah the true me (true me)
Not the glamour and glitz that y'all do see (do see)
I'm just a regular G, I gotta do me (do me)
I'm 'bout to introduce y'all boys to the new me, c'mon

[Paul Wall]
It's more to me than all this glamour and glitz
I spent my whole life broke, I'm just tryin to get rich
I kept it real all my life, I never stepped on toes
But somehow my friends keep turnin into my foes
My ex keep callin me, but I don't wanna talk to her
So then she call the laws on me like I'm the one stalkin her
My new girl say I don't love her enough
But all the hatin friends jealous cause I love her too much
I'm drinkin bottles of Patron tryin to drink away my troubles
But bein an alcoholic only make thangs double
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me - Paul Wall baby

[Hook]

[Paul Wall]
You think you know me mayne?  But you don't know me mayne
Just because you shake my hand don't mean that you my homey mayne
It's people prayin on my downfall
And I can't understand why, cause I show love to alla y'all
People are grateful for the favors you show 'em
But when they need you for another one they still act like you owe 'em
Everybody be takin credit for somethin they ain't do
But you need to quit reachin and stand on your own two
I always stayed humble, I never once changed
I never got a ego or a big head cause of fame
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me - Paul Wall baby

[Hook]

[Paul Wall]
I'm Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ
But it ain't easy bein me
I done put in my fair share of work, {?}, f'real
Passin out flowers at the club
Doin freestyles that don't go on mixtapes
I ain't understand it then but, now I understand it
It's a bigger picture than just what you think
You gotta think outside the box and try to make it
It's chess moves, not checkers baby
