I got polo on my body, smelling like
These twinkles and the
Cause my mouth is rather starry
I call a bitch a bitch, call a lady say I'm sorry
Then ask her if she f*cking the reply is I was party
Cause I treat
Gucci and I keep a way in Prada
Man I can't tell her skin tone cause she covered up in dollars
My hustle is the hardest so my paper is the tallest
Everythang name brand, color scheme flawless
I got all the jays, new pair fresh
Like I cut hair
Rocking new jury cause I own the store
These boys tell me it ain't fair
Horses on my underwear and true religion bridges
But I don't even like them, I just do it for the bitches
Where we at? Top boy, top boy
What you want to drink she say sirock boy
20 women round me standing on the couch
They getting drunk and getting hot so now it's going down, down
I just do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
We do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
We do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
Do it, because they like it, pull up to the club, f*cked up
Walk up to the door then I'm right
Pictures be the section type
Got a big blunt
High up on my swisher
With my head first
Standing up, I'm drinking till my head hurts
Talk about my best work, crazy how my words work
Better than your best verse
Mama says she's so
She needs to stop tripping niggas
Sirock with me and my brother pow-wow
Say I'm g
Where we at? Top boy, top boy
What you want to drink she say sirock boy
20 women round me standing on the couch
They getting drunk and getting hot so now it's going down, down
I just do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
We do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
We do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
Money over bitches, still the same motto
At the parking lot, watch the bitches follow
They just wanna
Show time at the apolo
Cause the bread up in my pocket, all green like avocado
Let's
Lots of chips
Long stamina
Plant the
But it ain't no roof
Cause it's diamonds and gold on a nigga tooth
That's the power of the Gucci, so sue me, f*ck it
I'm probably somewhere f*cking, while your bitch is over there fussing
I'm a beat down
Where we at Marcus
Where we at? Top boy, top boy
What you want to drink she say sirock boy
20 women round me standing on the couch
They getting drunk and getting hot so now it's going down, down
I just do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
We do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
We do it cause these bitches like it, like it, I like it, I like it
