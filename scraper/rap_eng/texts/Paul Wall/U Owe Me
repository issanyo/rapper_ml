[Chorus]
U Owe Me, but you act like you don't know me
Next time I see ya you better have something for me
You better show me every single dime
Cause when I see ya its payback time, give me what's mine

U Owe Me, but you act like you don't know me
Next time I see ya you better have something for me
You better show me every single dime
Cause when I see ya its payback time, give me what's mine

[Chamillionaire]
Ugghh..
My stocks missing, as soon that im not trippin'
The clocks ticking, there's no overtime and im not Pippen
That means that im not kidding, ain't hide and go seek
Cause you ain't gonna hide while I go seek, my money all weak
They say that I'm like diva when its pay back time
Anything that shines I'll grab it and I'll say thats mine
Give me that before I really act ignorant
The landlord have come to collect and get your rent
Don't miss a cent, pay later don't think about it
Niggas that owe they try to sneek and never think they spot it
The walking bank teller, tell a nigga make a deposit
Say he ain't got it, cuz his wallet, he left home and forgot it
What?..

[Chorus]
U Owe Me, but you act like you don't know me
Next time I see ya you better have something for me
You better show me every single dime
Cause when I see ya its payback time, give me what's mine

U Owe Me, but you act like you don't know me
Next time I see ya you better have something for me
You better show me every single dime
Cause when I see ya its payback time, give me what's mine

[Paul Wall]
This is your final notice, before your slab advection
When you walk outside and notice that your slab is missing
Your stories are conflicted, but you already know
Its time to confiscate that what you already owe
Im getting fed up, my patience is already low
Your short changing me, your payments are always slow
The reimbursements past due and I ain't want to forget
Your barking up the wrong tree, but your about to get bit
This ain't a game, I think it be in your best interest
To pay me everything that you owe plus interest
I suggest increasing up for something a little bit stronger
Or next time its not going to be such a friendly reminder

[Chorus]
U Owe Me, but you act like you don't know me
Next time I see ya you better have something for me
You better show me every single dime
Cause when I see ya its payback time, give me what's mine

U Owe Me, but you act like you don't know me
Next time I see ya you better have something for me
You better show me every single dime
Cause when I see ya its payback time, give me what's mine

[Paul Wall]
When I come around you run away like a coward
Your digging yourself a hole that you can't climb out of
Your attitude is sour, but really is sweet
You squealing squeak like broad cause your brain got a leak
Word on the street is that you think as dead as a sleep
Your bills are getting steep, boy you're into deep
Next week, if you want to be still standing up right
Somehow you better make these numbers better start adding up right
Or you'll be out of luck right before its goodnight
Your eating into my funds, you didn't take a good bite
Reimbursement is mandatory, get it correct
Pay back time, I want mine, time to collect

[Chorus]
U Owe Me, but you act like you don't know me
Next time I see ya you better have something for me
You better show me every single dime
Cause when I see ya its payback time, give me what's mine

U Owe Me, but you act like you don't know me
Next time I see ya you better have something for me
You better show me every single dime
Cause when I see ya its payback time, give me what's mine

U Owe Me.... Owe Me.. Owe Me.. Owe Me. [Fades]
