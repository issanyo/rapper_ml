[Paul Wall: Chorus]
Correct me if I'm wrong
These days hard to tell who to trust
These days hard to tell who to trust man
Correct me if I'm wrong
Staying true to yourself is a must
Staying true to yourself is a must man
Correct me if I'm wrong
I don't want the fame I just want the bucks
I don't want the fame I just want the bucks man
Correct me if I'm wrong
In the end we all end up dust
In the end we all end up dust man
Correct me if I'm wrong

[Paul Wall: Verse 1]
Riding down the boulevard clean than a b****
Everyone waiving at me taking my pic (taking my pic)
They so called want to be my friend: they not slick
If my pockets wasn't thick they would be gone quick
Hit the left lane tipping as I tap that blinker
With a bad mamacita crawling slow on the feeder
Saw jack boy creeping with a side eye
Cup colors look similar to tie-dye
!Big time that's a fact (!wth u say Paul? !)
Roll'-ie on my wrist (my wrist)
Boys talking down I got haters in my mix (my mix)
Made a lot of profit
!On that switch/swish
!But that's/there's too [much] broke for most so they pissed man

[Paul Wall: Chorus]
Correct me if I'm wrong
These days hard to tell who to trust
These days hard to tell who to trust man
Correct me if I'm wrong
Staying true to yourself is a must
Staying true to yourself is a must man
Correct me if I'm wrong
I don't want the fame I just want the bucks
I don't want the fame I just want the bucks man
Correct me if I'm wrong
In the end we all end up dust
In the end we all end up dust man
Correct me if I'm wrong

[Paul Wall: Verse 2]
Back when I was broke it was all good
Nobody jealous when you poor it was understood
I never had to watch my back for a hater
Nobody envious when you ain't got no paper
But I could sell water to a rain cloud
Now I got that bread everybody got their hand out
I got a good heart I tend to try to help them, (try to help them)
Lord help them running game on me ain't helping
As soon as I leave they talk down every time
They point out my flaws but they don't mention my grind
Fake friends turn foe at the drop of a dime
But really they just want what's mine

[Paul Wall: Chorus]
Correct me if I'm wrong
These days hard to tell who to trust
These days hard to tell who to trust man
Correct me if I'm wrong
Staying true to yourself is a must
Staying true to yourself is a must man
Correct me if I'm wrong
I don't want the fame I just want the bucks
I don't want the fame I just want the bucks man
Correct me if I'm wrong
In the end we all end up dust
In the end we all end up dust man
Correct me if I'm wrong
