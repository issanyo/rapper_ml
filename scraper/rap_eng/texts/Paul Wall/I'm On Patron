[Intro]
Beanz N Kornbread

[Hook](x2)
I'm on Patrón, I just took seven shots to the dome
I'm gone, so gone
So dude, can I get a ride home?

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Ay, what it do?
I'm on like a light switch
My wrist wear froze up like a computer glitch
I'm drinking 151, Caribou Lou
Tech N9ne 'gon get it jumping like a kangaroo
Is it your birthday? Let's go and have a shot or two
My partner Glu you put me on to something new
Snuck in a gallon of lemonade from Chick-Fil-A
Mix it up with this Ciroc and we 'gon parlay
I'm looking for a hot girl that like to a-bay-bay
Come out and play and let me see you shake it this way
That Patron clears day, I'm on it hard
Getting lit with my dogs, having a party with these broads

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Go and pop another bottle, get this party to cracking
All these barbie doll models make the champ start macking
550s everywhere now Big Cat in heaven
He on his fifth Remy at 7
It ain't even 11
Thug boss Slim Thug drinking GPO
Grey Goose, Patron, and Orange Juice
Pour me some more
Now Box and Poppy Joe just ordered the rose mo
Chucking deuces to my partner, Hi-C and Big Do
I'm loaded like a full clip
Leaning like a sinking ship
Lit up like a Christmas tree
How much throwed up can I get?
C-Stone and Lil C, bringing out the Jägerbombs
If I get pulled over DJ Jonny pay my bond

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I keep bumping into people say
"Man my bad. I'm intoxicated a tad and the DJ acting bad"
Miskin Mike and Stag, my family getting slammed
Beanz N Kornbread just bought a round of Belvedere and cran
Man, I'm so throwed I can't think
Who the hell been putting their lips on my drink?
What the hell the waitress doing with my change?
Somebody slipped me a thizz pill, I'm feeling strange
Maybe some Red Bull will help me sober up
Matter fact, mix it with this Grey Goose in my cup
I can barely stand up, I'm about to throw up
If you can't roll with the big dogs, go hang with the bucks

[Hook](x2)

[Outro]
Beans and cornbread
