[Hook: Chamillion]
When we come through in Caddies on swangaz and vogues
I would tell the outcome you already no dough
I'm the reason these boys hand cuffing these hoes
You know she's about to get chose

You know the routine when a true player come through
She's leaving with me although she came here with you
I'm sorry to tell you but I got really bad news
Game Over you lose

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Ughh..
I know you want to heat me up and make me stiff like Stay Flow
Cause your woman loves the way my voice sound when the tape slow
Better stay more than 50 feet away from my space so
They won't have to replace yo' neck with a brace bro'
Better take yo' re-whining ass to the Ricki Lake show
Where did they go? With Koopa but was it a mistake? NO
I pay for, nothing partna only mistakes
Is when you took her on dates and start buying miss steaks
Thanks to this, little lesson the game get switched
The lames get dissed, can't admit they can't resist, Koopa
Relationships I relate to ships, you took her on a trip
When you love both, sank, she split
You bumped into the walking iceberg in Iceberg
Don't get hyper and try to fight cause your life turned
Gotta quick jab better duck like a damn white bird
Baby shitting ass nigga go change your diaper

[Hook: Chamilllionaire]
Listen, the same women's always claiming that they independent
But the same ones staring at the diamonds In Da Pendent
Ladies want him to spend it, he gets offended
And kicks them out the car like a license being suspended
Pockets green like a pool table, since we on the topic
More numbers than a pool table in my corner pocket
When they ask where the hell is Carmen Sandiego
In Chamillionaire's car man in San Diego

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Please sir, tell me why you always trying to please her
Your just her preview partner but I'm her main feature
Cause while you all hot and calling your Ex cursing
Me and your Ex getting hot in back of an Excursion
You was worsem, tricking all your dough to a gal
You need to learn how to be firm, say no to a gal
One things for certain, while you so searching and hurting
I'm working on her like a surgeon, close the curtain, we flirting

[Hook: Paul Wall]
Peep game, broads be knowing about my sweet thang
They want to see how my meat hang
When I pull up to the club I'm on the G Bone thangs
While these other boys broke like a cheap chain, you weak man
Afraid that I might take your chick
Conceited, cocky, or confident you take your pick
Your game is lame, it got outdated quick
But as soon as this girl see my face they can't wait to strip
Adulterous relationship, something you never should doubt
You trusted in your gal, but something has been ruined about
Because while you at your crib looking cool on your couch
Your girl iron me, drool in her mouth, a Chick Magnet
A heart throb, I'm smooth, smart, and soave
A macking artist, check for the mark on your broad
With you, there ain't no benefits like a Wal-Mart job
It ain't no competition boy, I'm a shock to these frauds

[Hook]
You know the routine when a true player come through
She's leaving with me although she came here with you
I'm sorry to tell you but I got really bad news
Game Over you lose
