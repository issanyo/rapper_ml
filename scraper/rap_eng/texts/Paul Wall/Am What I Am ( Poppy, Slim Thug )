This is ghetto reality in Texas
Aye, aye, you see I am what I am and it is what it is
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been
Live what I live, see what I see
So get out my ear and just let me be
See I am what I am and it is what it is
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been
Live what I live, see what I see
So get out my ear and just let me be
I'm a survivor of the struggle, I lived life hard
Single mama with half a job, I was raised by God
No dad, the only role model I had
Was a ounce of that white powder in a Ziplock bag
I don't brag about the struggles, I endured as a child
So you don't know the pain I went through, to create this smile
I got one life to live, know I'm talkin' 'bout?
So I enjoy it, cause I earned everything that I got
They hate what I got, I hear 'em with they cape talk
They thinking that my life, was a cake walk
I'm a man of principles, I live by my word
So it's obscured when I hear sour words
They gon' get what they deserve but I don't wish no harm
What goes around comes around so partna' you been warned
In the midst of all the trouble, I still remain calm
'Cause sunny days, will follow the storm' man, just let me be
You see I am what I am and it is what it is
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been
Live what I live, see what I see
So get out my ear and just let me be
See I am what I am and it is what it is
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been
Live what I live, see what I see
So get out my ear and just let me be
Somebody questioned, if I got the right to recite what I spit
'Cause I've never been indicted or divided a brick
But my life is grit, all types of crisis and shit
But I decided to risk it all to try to slide in the mix
And get what I can get
See, I'm fighting negative bars
I knew it wouldn't be easy but no one said it be hard
As it is, I mean the evil in the heart of these men
Got me wondering, if I'll ever see the reward at the end of the road
It's kind of hard to remember your goals
When you grow where not many live to get old
I played the cards that I was given and never listen to those
Who think different 'cause they inner soul is bitter and cold
I seen death and folk get destroyed by do'
Nevertheless I'm blessed so your boy got hope
I show love to get it is a beautiful feelin'
If you hate me then blow a dick 'cause it's a mutual feelin'
You see I am what I am and it is what it is
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been
Live what I live, see what I see
So get out my ear and just let me be
See I am what I am and it is what it is
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been
Live what I live, see what I see
So get out my ear and just let me be
All outsiders looking in, think they know where I been
Trying to be my friend 'cause of the position I'm in
They know Slim Thug a hustler, that's destined to win
So I guess they figured they can hold my cotail in
But I ain't the type to play that roll and sell a nigga gold
Pretend it's all cool when I know you a hoe
'Cause you'll do it again, if you done it befo'
It's just a matter of time or you doin' some mo'
I done witnessed all type of snake niggas and hoes
From my family to my friends, to these bitches I know
It'll surprise you, how much a lil' change bring change
You get a couple dollas and people ain't the same
They quick to holla at you capping now, since you rapping now
See them the type of folks, you need to be packing 'round
'Cause first time to miss 'em when you passing a blunt
They plotting up on you, trying to pull 'em a stunt
You see I am what I am and it is what it is
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been
Live what I live, see what I see
So get out my ear and just let me be
See I am what I am and it is what it is
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been
Live what I live, see what I see
So get out my ear and just let me be
