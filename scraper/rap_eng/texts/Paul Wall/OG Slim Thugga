[Verse 1:]
Word on d street I’m a suspect
Take a good change get it back here
Drop hit got yo girl soakin wet
Never leave d crew without a loaded tick
Boss like team man I live dat
Couple acres where d new crib at
Four five tuck in ma wheel back
Anything run up wrong ima kill dat
OG Thugga still eatin, boss like management set up for meetin
Tryna make a fuckin meal fuck all dat beefin
Ima get money for a while for a reason
Ridin out season, mindin my business
Keep a bad brawd diggin all in d kidneys
Started from d bottom yea y’all my witness
Sixteen years later yea bitch I’m still gettin it
I’m OG Slim Thugga, OG Slim Thugga, OG Slim Thugga
Mothafuckas!
Chicks season, baby
It’s d OG Slim rider
I been waitin, drunk on yo punk
Enjoy the view
Word on d street is I got a cheque
I put it in d slabber get it too quick
Eddie spread it over made it extra wet
I can use ma iphone an make d trunk lift
First XTS with a candy fifth
And d first DTS boat back in ‘06
Matter of fact ‘05, had it early bitch
Pearl black canvas top wit d gold strip
One time for my slambo G fish
I been down wit ma dog since ’96
My first drop was a brand new wine Cadillac
Elbry brought a maid back in 1976
I sold 18 fares -a colick, I had so many slaps man, do not forget
Ray-Ray, street killa, Ray turned heads
Ma girl mayne all a ham, ronisherm heads
Dirty bandz on d grill, get d job done
Paint wet, wait until you see it in d sun
I had more slaps than suckaz had hoes
And did I mention that I had a mash in 9-1?
Rest in peace to ma boy lil E man
Every slap dat I make got a matchin gun
Me an you, you use to swing in the river
That I bought for bought an man I beat a pop to jump
I’m d OG we workin baby
