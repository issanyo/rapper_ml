[Intro]
Rest in peace Fat Pat. It's a wild world we livin' in man, gettin' crazier by the day. But don't get caught up in all the bullshit man, don't be a crash dummy for this shit man. You gotta stay solid out there man, you gotta hold on man. Sometimes you gotta get your smoke on to hold man. Do what you gotta do, stay strong out there. It's gettin' crazy

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Things are crazy in this life
Gotta get my smoke on, it's gettin' hard to hold on
Things are crazy in this life
Gotta get my smoke on, it's gettin' hard to hold on

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
They say we live in the last days
They killed Josh for a pair of J's
Too many dark days, gotta stay prayed
Hard times still gotta give God praise
I watched a brother die on Instagram
The day before I watched a brother die in my hands
Fourth of July in the (?)
Shots rang out and Screwball was on the floor
I say young man layin' in blood
I grabbed his hand and I prayed for God's love
His eyes rolled back as he took his last breath
Hard to hold on, Fat Pat said it best
I don't want to be another hashtag death
I wonder who's next, (?) be blessed
Prayers and love for every mother heart pressed
So much stress time for a smoke sess'
Oh yes

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Things are crazy in this life
Gotta get my smoke on, it's gettin' hard to hold on
Things are crazy in this life
Gotta get my smoke on, it's gettin' hard to hold on

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I wonder if the Lord even hear my prayin'
Like I can't and he deaf, he can't hear what I'm sayin'
Givin' probation, a car note, that's what I'm payin'
It ain't no love for a real nigga, that's what I'm sayin'
My partner caught a misdemeanor, why he doin' 10?
Cause the prosecutor got his partner to do him in
Now he in jail and the same partner that rolled on him
At his baby mama house, he straight answered the phone on 'em
These niggas ain't shit and these bitches even worse
Havin' babies not out of love, tryna fill up they purse
So I'm one deep, these niggas can't get down with this
Because they really filmin' when they sit down to piss
Give a fuck a nigga shoot me, I'll set it off like Boosie
It's gon' take a whole team, no one man can do me
I'm sick and tired, I'm so sick and tired of bein' sick and tired
Throw my shit in back, murder 'em all and throw my shit in drive

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Things are crazy in this life
Gotta get my smoke on, it's gettin' hard to hold on
Things are crazy in this life
Gotta get my smoke on, it's gettin' hard to hold on
