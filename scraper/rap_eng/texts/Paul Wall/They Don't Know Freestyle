Mike Jones...Paul Wall

What you know bout livin' lavish
What you know bout reebok classics
Down south is where I stay
We sit drank and rock RBK

[Mike Jones]
I hit the block and I'm lookin' lavish
White t-shirt, pants baggin'
Wit a fresh pair of reebok classics
On the grind tryin' get cash
Down south is where I stay
We sit drank and rock RBK
I hit the cabinet everday for a fresh pair
Cuz I don't play

[Paul Wall]
Its Paul Wall and Mike Jones
We street legends and mic breakers
Its fancy footwork on my toes
I hit the club wit my reebok classics
Its gotta be reebok on my shoe
Their all white and they brand new
When the swishahouse and down south
We wear reeboks I thought you knew

What you know bout livin' lavish
What you know bout reebok classics
Down south is where I stay
We sit drank and rock RBK
