[Intro]
Swang on!

[Verse]
I could write a book on how to work the wheel
Candy watermelon with the bumper grill
It’s floodin’ outside and I’m the wettest steel
Windows roll up, cold cup and some kill
Let me explain the way it feel to ride on 84s
A different level of respect amongst yo peers and foes
Anotha victim for the streets if you ain’t on yo toes
My took palms might leave you, betta watch my toes
Rain comin’ down while I’m comin’ down
Ears turn around when ’em swangers turn around
Shout out to my OG slab riders
Big mick, sport black, balley all my patnas
Swang around the puddle, drankin’ muddy as the puddle
Softer than a puddle, leather proferated butter
This for all the hustlers out there gettin’ it in the rain time
So turn the music up and go swang

[Hook break]
Swangin’ in the rain
Swang on!
Swangin’ in the rain
(So much love between us)

[Verse 2]
Rain drops on my window
Elbows poking out past the fender
Turn sharper than a No. 2 pencil
The way I avoid hitting curbs is monumental
Slow pace drankin’ on my last days
Ridin’ one deep cause my ace caught a case
Somethin’ on my mind, so I’m turnin’ up the bass
On my zone, I’m swangin’ with finnesse and grace
Forecast muddy, atmosphere cloudy
Growin’ up while the rain pourin’ up around me
Shout out my boys Big D up in the county
Pop a trunk on a cop, fourth Ward where they found me
Rain drops on my panoramic roof
Check the red light cameras if you want the proof
Candy apple ova silver, I’m swangin’
To turn a lane turnin’ heads every time I swang in the rain

[Hook break]
