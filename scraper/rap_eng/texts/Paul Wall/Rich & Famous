[Hook]
Got the whole world with me in this club
I got all these hoes with me and they on drugs
Boys mad cause they broke, so they mug
Man, I got yo bitch up on my dick and she finna turn up
Lifestyle - rich and famous
Diamond chains hangin'
Lifestyle - rich and famous
Diamond chains hangin' (pull up)
Lifestyle - rich and famous
Diamond chains hangin'
I can ball like Michael Jordan
I don't need no hangers (swish)

[Verse 1]
Lifestyle - rich and famous
Diamond chains hangin'
I can fuck yo baby mama and the hoes she hang with
Club God-club-God-club-Godzilla
Pull up with some bad bitches
And all they' titties pierced with they' bras missin'
In the club, grabbin'
My dick like I'm Michael Jackson
Pull up in that Rarri
Hoes hoppin', we don't ask em
I'm with Riff Raff
I'm with Paul Willaker
Tag some hoes, Mortal Kombat
Let my boys finish her (come here!)
Club God the Don got a chick look like Mulan
All my shows crazy look at the pictures on Noisey dot com
Fuckin' hoes in a loft
Bout whateva, no matter the cost
Shit from Godzilla
Gorilla-r, bitch I'm thriller
Like some of my [?], hol' up

[Verse 2]
No [?] but syrup for breakfast
No salad, but lots of legs
Every group is in-dominant [?] cause I graduated like eight semesters
I'm smokin' the Cali and drinkin' on Texas
I'm turnin' these blocks for lines like Tetris
[?] fucked up 100 in Vegas
8000 a month, that's just my [?]
I switch chains and switch cars
Got four slabs in my garage
Let's push it dame in nomenos
Then disappear like a mirage
No training wheels, just handle bars
Satellite gush high as Mars
My first check for Michael Watts
I win bout 100.000 cigars
Mouth full of doughs, ridin' on 4s
I stay on my toes
Run off and get more, living full of hoes
Get rid of the Rolls
I'm textin' these hoes, I got 24s
So pimpin' is swolls
Blood stains on all my clothes
They got me froze at Genesis shows
