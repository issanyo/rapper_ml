[Intro]
It's the parking lot heart breaker turning lane head turner anyah boyd
Paul Wall Baby

[Verse 1]

Aye, I turn heads like a coin toss
Red Line Boss
Sideways Down Voss
Please don't ask the cost
Unless you want your feelings hurt (hurt)
'Cause for what it's worth
You can't afford what it's worth (worth)

Search the whole earth
You'll never find some paint that's wetter
Perforated custom leather
Spent a lot of Cheddar
My wood stern-ing wheel
Got the wristwear to match
My stash spot got a kill-switch
And secret latch

Everybody looking for me
Where's Paul Wall though?
Boppers follow, crowd slow
Fifth wheel, follow
Never hesitate to grab your camera
Take a snap (snap,snap)
Never touch the paint
Unless you trying to get slapped (slap, slap)
Screwtape tapped
Knocking pictures off the shelf (shelf)
I got bumper and mesh grill with matching Belts
Riding Han Solo
All by myself
'Cause associating with suckers is bad for my health (bad for my health)

[Hook]

I'm riding Han Solo on 4's (on 4's)
Han Solo on 4's (on 4's)
No fake friends
No fake hoes
I'm Han Solo on 4's (Han Solo on 4's)

I'm riding Han Solo on 4's (on 4's)
Han Solo on 4's (on 4's)
No fake friends
No fake hoes
I'm Han Solo on 4's (Han Solo on 4's)

[Verse 2]

They wanna know
Why I'm always riding one deep (deep)
'Cause most people sheep
Like my bumper kit they sleek
Sometimes I crank my music up
And just slow creep (creep)
Whole fleet, on fleek
Nothing Incomplete
It wasn't cheap
It costs more than a couple friends (friends)
'Cause jealousy turn 'em to foes
When you buy a Benz
And when they broke and on they ass
They'll try to make amends
Just turn the camera sideways
Use the wide lens

Every time I get gas
It turn into a meet and greet
Slabs so pretty, a homeless man saw it and beat his meat
Chrome feet, custom seats
Motivate I don't compete
I turn heads I don't turn my back on my peeps (my peeps)
I got angels watching the haters
That been watching me (me)
And I got Boppers watching
Every time I turn the street
I'm the only occupied seat
When I come down
All my true friends are locked up
Or in the ground

[Hook]

I'm riding Han Solo on 4's (on 4's)
Han Solo on 4's (on 4's)
No fake friends
No fake hoes
I'm Han Solo on 4's (Han Solo on 4's)

I'm riding Han Solo on 4's (on 4's)
Han Solo on 4's (on 4's)
No fake friends
No fake hoes
I'm Han Solo on 4's (Han Solo on 4's)
