Don't do me no favors (Not one)

Do me a favor

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Don't do me no favors bro
All I know is hustle but you asking for a hand-out though
Tellin' me to look out for the kids bitch I got my own
You ain't even speak to me until you see me on some chrome
Bitch you must be crazy if you think that I ain't peep your game
Plottin' on me thinkin' you finesse me but I ain't no lame
Telling me its hard times ho go get a hard grind
All you do is whine bout an hour, talk shit complain
Ain't nobody owe you nothing, everybody go through pain
Use your brain
Broke and lazy motherfuckers everywhere is all the same
Envy anybody making change or makin' a change
Think I owe em something just because I'm wearing chains

[Hook: Paul Wall]
Do me a favor (Just one)
Don't do me no favors (Not one)
Do me a favor (Just one)
Don't do me no favors (Not one)
Do me a favor (Just one)
Don't do me no favors (Not one)
Do me a favor (Just one)
Don't do me no favors (Not one)
Do me  favor

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Don't do me no favors
I pray one day hard work and dedication is contagious
I wish that loyalty could be as common as a STD
But jealousy turn friends to foes I should have listened to my OG
Now I got these crumb snatchers tryna sell these wolf tickets
Why you steady asking for a hand-out you could be out getting it
Bitch you tripping listen close, I'm giving you this game for free
Everyday you wake up is a day get your cake up G
Loyalty and faith,  hard work is all it takes
When oppurtunity come knockin', partner it don't wait
I would rather smoke alone than smoke in a room full of fakes
Cause as soon as all the kush gone everybody vacates

[Hook: Paul Wall]
Do me a favor (Just one)
Don't do me no favors (Not one)
Do me a favor (Just one)
Don't do me no favors (Not one)
Do me a favor (Just one)
Don't do me no favors (Not one)
Do me a favor (Just one)
Don't do me no favors (Not one)
Do me a favor
