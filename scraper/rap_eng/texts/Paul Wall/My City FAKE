[Chorus]
I believe I can fly fly fly
I believe I can fly fly fly
I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
I believe I can fly fly fly
I believe I can fly fly fly
I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
I Believe I can fly

Aye Aye Aye
Bitch I'm sittin' so high, I believe I can fly
The coupe looks delicious the rims are waving bye
? long like Diddy, I put on for my city
Cologne Kush and Henny, I'm gone in that Hemi
I'm gold but you don't hear me, four to the dome if you can hear me
They say I need a pull-up when I pull up I'm the shit man
When I grow up I wanna be like t-pain a hit man
But do yourself a favor partna don't be talkin' shit man
Your broad done up and broke your heart my whole squad hit man
Hold up I see dead people, its just the dead white guys on my bread people

[Chorus]
I'm high as the moon and I'm flyer than a mosquito
Stacking my chips I got a bank full of Doritos
I'm too cool for school so I'm teaching a class
Chiefin' on that purple rain partna puff puff pass
See im higher than the price of gas gone off vanilla cream
Rolling off of mac Dre leaning like a triple beam
I got my wrist froze up like computer screens
So fresh so clean exhale sticky green
I got the top steady droppin' like record sales
Paint changing colors like Tyra bank's finger nails
Choose the fast life I'm the flashy type
Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite
I'm so high

[Chorus]
I believe I can lean spite and codeine
Someones sleeping on the scene
That's a hell of a dream I'm a hell of a guy
That's a hell of a blunt fire it up lets get high
You can call me g5 cause I be in the clouds
Somewhere in the club with my clothes smelling loud
And never will I smile cuz I be biting down
Rollin off a p probably muggin' with a frown
But naw ain't nothing wrong how could he be on rich
Bitch looked at my whip bitch looked at my wrist
My wrist is tricked in ice my neck is dripped in ice
Bitch look at my life don't you wanna be my wife?
Would you like to be my girl? dont you wanna change your life?
I can change your life grab the credit card and swipe, like see?

Fly fly fly

[Chorus]
