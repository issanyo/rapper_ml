[Hook]
All I do is make money, make money, make money (money, money)
But the money don't make me, no the money don't make me
All I do is make money, make money, make money (money, money)
But the money don't make me, no the money don't make me

[Verse 1]
I woke up with them dollar bills on my mind
I pray to god, and then I go get on my grind
They wanna gossip, sorry I don't got the time
I'm lining up my licks, the packets coming in at 9
You learn the merit of a hustler when he lose it all
You learn who really down with you when you take a fall
All you gotta do is focus, and you'll make it back
But boys would rather spend a stack, than save a stack
Riddle me that, riddle me this
Let um hate, let um talk down
Do you, use it as motivation for the grind
Prove um wrong, you got the vision let um watch you blind
Never give up, never stop trying

[Hook]
All I do is make money, make money, make money (money, money)
But the money don't make me, no the money don't make me
All I do is make money, make money, make money (money, money)
But the money don't make me, no the money don't make me

[Verse 2]
Some of my partnas are rich, some of my partna's are broke
But all of my partnas are go getters, homie you know how that go
I pull off the lot in the drop, jackers are watching, I know
Instead of grinding, they watching my door, but I'm strapped with the four-four, ready to blow
You never know who watching, and plotting, you never know
But either way I ain't stopping, no sir, never, no (no, no, no, no)
All of my partnas grind, none of my partna's hate
Ain't got no time for female traits, even the female's getting the cake
Some of my biggest haters supposedly supposed to be friends
But in the end they change up, like a leaf in the wind
I put my faith in god, not men
Work, win, spend, do it all again

[Hook]
All I do is make money, make money, make money (money, money) (Do it all again, work, win, spend, do it all again)
But the money don't make me, no the money don't make me (Work, win, spend, do it all again)
All I do is make money, make money, make money (money, money) (Work, win, spend, do it all again)
But the money don't make me, no the money don't make me (Work, win, spend, do it all again)
All I do is make money, make money, make money (money, money)
But the money don't make me, no the money don't make me
All I do is make money, make money, make money (money, money)
But the money don't make me, no the money don't make me
