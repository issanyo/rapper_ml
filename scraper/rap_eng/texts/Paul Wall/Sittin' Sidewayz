[Chorus]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

[Intro: Paul Wall]
Swisha, House, Big Pokey and Paul Wall, baby

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
It's the People's Champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppa Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Hoes that diss me in the club, the same hoes in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T. Farris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm with that Gu U on 5-9-double-O
In the Tahoe on 24's I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Coota Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say "cheese" and show my fronts, it's more karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm...

[Chorus]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gangbangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Tryna find some Honey Love, my macking game is top rank
These hoes peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, tryna figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm

[Refrain]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

[Verse 3: Big Pokey]
Maybe O'Jays, hoes be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's, watch ya ho
Bunch of money, bunch of clothes, Cigarillos, Optimos
Glidin' like a ice skater, motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sensei, Don 'Ke, Paul Wall in the place
Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Raised on Scott in the Yella
When I blaze, boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking off intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the plate
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm...

[Refrain]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze
