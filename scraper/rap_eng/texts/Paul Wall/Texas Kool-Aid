[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'm down in South Memphis drinking on that Texas Kool-aid (mud)
Out in Chi-Town drinking on that Texas Kool-aid
Out in MIA drinking on that Texas Kool-aid
Just like these niggas jury I swear these niggas Fugazi
Down in ATL drinking on that Texas Kool-aid
Out in LA smoking kush and drinking Texas Kool-aid
Just like these niggas jury I swear these niggas Fugazi
Down in Houston, Texas drinking on that Texas Kool-aid

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Got piston on me, and a pint of fucking raw (mud)
Got strong in my swisher, and your bitch in my car
R.I.P Pimp C; I'm still sipping bars (the pimp)
Nigga a blind man can see that I'm a fucking star
No matter wherever I'm at I'm drinking screw juice
Out in New York City drinking on that Texas Kool-aid
Crack the sealing; I ain't drink no H20 in two days
Its Thursday night, so I ain't drink no water since Tuesday (damn)
Nah I don't sip red; I drink purp (what)
Last night I fell asleep up under your bitch skirt
Woke up this morning; brush the residue off my shirt
Now I'm headed to South Memphis, to my trap to go to work

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Whats the deal; I keep it realer than a double seal
Soma, Norco, and Xanax, triple kill
It came straight from Walgreen's, because I'm that ill
But enough with all that dry snitching; Imma yeild
My partner Pascal got a snow cone maker full of mud
And South Memphis drinking DJ Screw getting full of that good
Have you ever smoked a backwood extendo
Try that shit one day and have your brain froze
In Kansas City, but I'm chiefing on that coughing killer
Split these boppers then I trash em like tobacco filla
5 grams, 4 swishers; I call that a forilla
Rest in peace to my boy Big Moe; put an 8th; tell me who realer

[Hook]
