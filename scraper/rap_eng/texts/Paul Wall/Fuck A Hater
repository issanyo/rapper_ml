I'm Charles Barkley I ball till I'm hairless
My sprite pink for breast cancer awareness
When dogs barking loudest it mean they the scardest
2 cups, 2 rubbers, you can never be too careless
Grindin all day, I'ma get it till I perish
I'm head to toe in hermes I bought it out in Paris
In love with my money, it's something that I cherish
3rd coast residence...
Boys skip the steps, they resume is scarce
They don't mean what they saying, they just talking like some parrots
Keeping it 100 these days is the rarest
But I'm with the same crew dru cat and t faris
Fuck, fuck, fuck a hater, that might mean you
Mind on my paper, I'ma get it then I'm through
Hoes tend to over do me, cause I'm long overdue
Out here, out here getting money you should try to get it too
Fuck, fuck, fuck a hater, Fuck, fuck, fuck a hater
Fuck, fuck, fuck a hater, might mean you
Pull out the old school slab, time to rep again
Crawling slow, I'm spotted like some leopard skin
Fifth wheels suplexing like I'm wrestling
Polyscience, I know all about the them presidents
Riding dirty, courtesy of a Columbian
I got the loud from my home boy this Mexican
It came from the same place I got arrested in
My hustle strong, money long as the old testament
Just like some yes man, I got all the heads nodding
Steady mobbing so these b*tches wanna give me noggin
They trying to touch the knots, I don't need massaging
I'm running this sh*t, even when I'm joggin
Fuck, fuck, fuck a hater, that might mean you
Mind on my paper, I'ma get it then I'm through
Hoes tend to over do me, cause I'm long overdue
Out here, out here getting money you should try to get it too
Fuck, fuck, fuck a hater, Fuck, fuck, fuck a hater
Fuck, fuck, fuck a hater, might mean you
