[Intro]
Say man
It's hating season, grab your coat

[Verse 1]
I do it with ease so they think that it's easy
When you doin' dirt, expect to get your hands greezy
I'm all about getting cheese but I'm never cheesy
Never greedy, always keep it one peezy
OG Backwoods, wrap blades up the bleezy
I'm the We-G, and I ain't talkin' 'bout a ouija
Plottin' schemin', while I'm chiefin', listening to BG
My life struggle was explicit, story wasn't PG
Free my dog 50-50, free my homie Peedi
Undefeated people's champ, still I eat my Wheaties
Everybody hand out, please stop the reaching
I don't need your adlibs unless you Young Jeezy
You see me shining and you get offended, what's the reason?
Neck freezing, all VVS, no ZZ
God blessed me, and no I wasn't even sneezing
Hold your nuts and guard your grill 'cause it's hating season

[Chorus]
(Hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(Hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(It's hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(Hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(It's hating season)

[Verse 2]
When my name comes up, please hold the salt
Actions speak louder than words, I ain't with that talk
Think I'm lying, listen close, watch how I walk
Paper route from West Lil York to New York
No doubt, you already know what I'm about
Go ahead and gawk, I'm used to people having doubt
Let the fake ones crumble, let the humble ones exalt
Let the hating halt, long live Big Hogg
I don't talk behind backs, don't whisper, shout
Say it to my face, let me hear it out your mouth
Don't blame me, your downfalls ain't my fault
Why you don't get up out the house and get up off that couch?
I'm not responsible for your loss just 'cause I'm a boss
No way around it, no easy way out
Talking down ain't the way to make it out the drought
It's hating season, please watch out, the trolls are out

[Chorus]
It's hating season
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(Hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(It's hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(Hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(It's hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(Hating season)
Hold your nuts, guard your grill, 'cause it's hating season
(It's hating season)
