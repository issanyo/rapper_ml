[Intro]
Yeah
In the house
Ladies and gentlemen
Paul Wall

[Paul Wall]
The balling is big
Cuz the hustle is hard
The grind is rather huge
So the jealousy is quite large
With credit cards and cash stacks
My mind focused on greenbacks
I go and get it
I don't relax
The player hating is to the max
Kush sacks and powder packs
No time to eat
It's just snacks
That's whiskey shots and cognac
Getting fucked up like college frats
No exaggeration, just facts
Fascination with paper stacks
And masturbating on bubbas' backs
They're assassinating my player stats
Gang sharp like thumb tacks
Go dump on horse gump
They chew me up like Orbits gum
Swallow cock and eat cum
Go get rocks and eat crumbs
I run from cops but bar none
I'm in the streets just like a bum
If you don't like it, come get you some

[Hook]
I hear em talking that shit
But they ain't saying shit
They don't wanna start shit
Tell them they can eat shit
They all full of shit
Cuz they nuttin' but shit
If they keep on talking shit
I'm a-make 'em eat shit
Motherfucker, fuck you
With my middle finger up
Motherfucker, fuck you
With my middle finger up
Fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you)

[Fred Durst]
Hold up
I got moves to make
I cruise this globe you
Gonna have to wait
I'm a-slap that bitch upside your face
But bitch don't smile
I'm a-have to hate
I don't think it that shit too lightly
Microphone got me in the zone
With a shot of Patr√≥n
We're gonna have to brone
I'm a-slap this bitch upside your dome
Y'all know what? Me and Paul Wall
Gonna hold this white bullshit up
Gonna fuck them guts like some slut
Yo bitches better go lube up
Get chewed up and spit out
Like snot i blow this shit out
I love when rock and roll gets mixed with hip hop, ho!
This gun is clocking
Hit the show
These pockets fat from shows I stole
This cobra gold like days of woe
We're blasting classics
Now you know
I'm head to toe
You're on Abbey Road
I flip this super nasty flow
It keeps the ladies on the go and they all coming back for mo'

[Hook]

Fuck all the haters!

Seize the fake
Increase the stakes
This Gold Cobra and Wall the Great
Please wait no sweet escape
Just swisher sweets
And kush grades
Police on the take
No peaceful fate
For peace is the shit they speak the hate
Just broken bones and body heads
You gotta leap from the waist
Hello police state
Keep my mind up on my cake
I'll fly like Superman
But no cape
Dripped and draped in that street scholar
Hardly awake and half baked
Peak the technique
Clean the slate
The flow is so well done like steak
Break em down
I got some moves to make
Go fuck yourself if you can't relate

[Fred Durst]
They talk yeah
They talk
They talk
They talk
They done dug themselves a hole
They know it's all they fault
Gonna pour this salt straight on the wound
Better catch this jet it's leaving soon
Infection might be settling in
But this doctor done checked out the room
We blazing through like Xanadu
What?
Now y'all know what not to do
This crack here might not be for you
But I'm a-leave you crackers black and blue
We wreck this shit like hand grenades
You've blown to bits and get thrown away
This blunt done smoked up half a day
But I had to piss on your parade

[Hook]

Take all the pieces of the puzzle
If they ain't fittin', we're in trouble
Busting all your asses like a bubble
You know I'm made at you
Fuck you and your attitude!
