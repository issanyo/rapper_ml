They think I'm a drug deala, I'm dealin large
Cause I'm playin with more diamonds, than a deck of cards
My wrist light up the room like a bubbling light
I'm not your bud but I shine kinda like Bud Light
I'm thoed but you can catch me macking somethings is yella (Yellow)
Sippin coconut rum with a lil umbrella
Game shooter, I take trips to the Bermuda, so many cars
I got more keys than a computer
Screens fall like snow on a vacation to Alaska
Fly to Nebraska for a date with Toni Braxton
Ice look like a drunk princess shaving her legs
Princess cuts from my toes to the braids of my head
I'm bolted down, I got more bolts than home depot
Crawlin low like a bettle more fly than a seagull
For my people I'm a leader give them something to follow
My Roley's show time but this ain't the Apollo

[Hook]
Whoa
I'm feelin so really throwed that I can't pour
Pardon that Courvoisier puddle on the floor
Body froze mouth glows why you think those
Hoes follow close tryin to get my pesos
Ice sparkle color shows like a rainbow
Yea fa sho tell me somethin that I don't know
They can't beleive its not butter on my bankroll
Money grows but I'm sure that I need more

[Chamillionaire]
Look, look its Chamillion the rap ruler
I run with a black crew of
Niggas that give a round of applause and clap rugers
Being in black cruisers, sip drank outta fat coolers
And being in every Chinese restaurant like fat Buddhas
Man we stack movers, everyday is a pay day
Only thing I do Free is that girl next to AJ
This ain't 106th and Park stick shifts and park
But Great Scott the bloody rims keep forgetting to stop
Gotta get them things fixed, buy but I can't tip
No chasing my drink mix, but hoes wanna take sips
Nah I think not, see you couldn't get shots
If you were the blood doing the crip walk
And get caught by yourself on a crip block
The cheese be gotsta be more than just our noodles & meat on our pasta
See through in imposter, you got some locked lips
Ain't gotta buy Doritos cause we already got chips, nigga

[Paul Wall]
They think I work for Kellogs mouth full of Frosted Flakes
I wreck the mic like if you drivin and lost your brakes
My mouth got ice shattered with princess cuts swollen
I'm the ish like if I had a uncontrollable colon
I'm thoed but you can see me mackin somthings thats chocolate
Sippin' on some lemon squeeze with a cherry on top it
Game damager I take trips up to Canada
So many cars I got more keys than a janitor
Crawlin low like a tarantula, here I come grab your camera
Even though I'm a rookie I'm still far from an amateur
Its the trunk dismantler from Antawn Drive
But catch me being on satellite over in Cancun live
My screens fall kinda similar to coconuts
I'm trying to keep my pockets fatter than Oprah's butt
I'm sitting crooked and thoed, wide squatted and slow
It goes down boy you already know.hahaaa
