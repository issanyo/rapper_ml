[Hook: Le$]
I got the wind in my hair, pistol on the seat
Bass beating hard, puffing on a swisher sweet
I'm third coastin'
I'm third coastin'
I got that money on my mind
Chain on neck
UGK jamming in the tape deck
I'm third coastin'
I'm third coastin'

[Verse 1: Le$]
Picture me rolling on chrome
Coming up, but a nigga still coming down
Them gorillas in the trunk
Shaking up the ground
Fo's poking we keeping them boppers open
That brown is what I be drinking, that purple is what I'm smoking
Suckers hoping that we fall off
If y'all ain't fucking with us, homie that's y'all loss
We slab riding through the city in a single file line
Just doing all this shit that we saying in our rhymes
Sipping smoking swanging banging popping trunk and talking shit
Creeping down another strip, got them bitches on dick
And I make the screen flip out
Switch rocks
Tell your ho what a pimp bought
Going hard on that boulevard, I can show you boys how to get clout
But I'ma take it back to slow motion
For the g's and the real niggas out loc'ing
And them candy-painted spaceships floating
Got the good kush blowing and we just 3rd coastin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
Bitch I'm Bun at his best
I'ont want no disrespect
Chad in the flesh like I came out mama west [?]
I put that on my Caddy, my candy and my swangers
Yeah bitch I'm riding dirty, that's why i keep that banger
I'm a underground king, they done dug C up
Top down on it
Make sure them boppers see us
When I'm crawling, hoggin, bumper kit fallin
Them boppers yelling 'who that?' like I play for New Orleans
Run this shit like McAlister's [?]
Pull that bullshit outside of mine I'll embarrass ya
Po'ing up that potion when I'm coasting on a fresh set
20 inch gorillas wrap my vogues, that's the best set
Oldschool Super Tight, I left it wet
Haters trying grab my style but that ain't happen yet
Jewels on neck
Piece and chain hanging
Butter seats reclining
Wood grain strangling

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
That's me in that  [?] butterscotch 'lac
Slab wetter than a school of ducks no quack
T.V. screens on, homie, balling is my knack
On candy I'm a legend in the paint like Shaq
My fo's never clack [?]
So my fo's tryna jack [?]
That's why that .44 snub-nose in my lap
My hustle don't slack, my pockets intact
So get up off my nutsack, that jealousy is wack
I pull up knocking like somebody order pizza
Fresher than a [?] and it's smelling like some reefer
Them reachers in the bleachers they hustling for sneakers
I'm a dividend seeker
So my pockets getting deeper
My hand's full of sleepers [?]
I'm handlebar-rolling
My nuts what I'm holding
In the gutter like I'm bowling
I grind so I'm shining
Yeah I'm icier than Poland
And my mission everyday is how to keep my wallet swollen
Home boy I'm 3rd coastin'

[Hook]
