[Intro: Baby Bash]
Boppers on my nuts, boppers on my nuts
B-b-boppers on my nuts, boppers on my nuts
B-b-boppers on my nuts

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Pocket full of blunts, styrofoam cup
Tell the DJ turn this motherfucker up
Stuntin' like a million bucks, boppers on my nuts
We only roll with bosses so you know we coming up

[Hook x2: Baby Bash]
We comin' ayuhh, we comin' ayuhh
We comin' ayuhh, cause I got boppers on my nuts
We comin' ayuhh, we comin' ayuhh
We comin' ayuhh, cause I got boppers on my nuts

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Now here comes trouble and she dancing on a strobe light
She know my fettish so right and I rock that thang like all night
Bouncing like a bad chick, make me wanna grab that
She better quit playing before I take her home and stab that
Playboy mansion can keep it lit, [?]
On my grind and on my crib, with a top notch bitch all on my hip
Boppers club hopping, chicken head still flockin'
Haters cockblocking but we keep this thang poppin'
Barbie bitches lookin' yummie, she can snort some money
Her moma didn't raise no dummie so she gets neck'd infront me
Her moma didn't raise no dummie so she gets neck'd infront me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
I got boppers on my ballsacks claiming me like income tax
Simply cause I'm balling and I got paper like Office Max
I got a lot of stacks, piled up in boxes
The [?] is ostrich but the floor mats made of foxes
Them broke bustas hating cause my stunting is obnoxious
But please pardon, all that talking down is rather toxic
My wardrobe is kinda flawless like them carats up in my ear
I'mma have them dimes broadless by the time you finish beer
Then I skeet all in their ear, they be talkin' 'bout me all year
Cause the forecast is clouded but my wrist [?]
Gridnin' is my career, I'm out there chasing them bucks
So I got haters in my rearview mirror and I got boppers on my nuts

[Hook]
