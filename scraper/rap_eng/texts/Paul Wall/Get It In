[Intro]
Look, the people you are after are the people you depend on
They cook your meals, they haul your trash, we connect your calls, we drive your ambulances, we guard you while you sleep
Do not fuck with us

Inkredibles

[Chorus: Masspike Miles]
I live everyday like its my last
Hustlin' to get this cash
I get it in, get it in
Whatever it takes, I get it in
We gonna push to the limit on the grind 'til the clock stops tickin'
'Cause I get it in, get it in, whatever it takes, I get it in

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I just push and push, smoking purple kush
Every time you look, ridin' 'round with crooks
Is you down with us? It's that sound you love
We just loungin', uh, we just stylin', bruh
Hope you crowding us, though we sold dope
I got thousands but don't see no hope
In a P-world, nigga, it is no joke
'Bout to hit another bank and a store, loc
You don't see the warning post in the store bro?
Can't let 'em catch a nigga, can't go home no more
Gotta carry on, only the strong'll know
What I'm really on, but it's time, the raw should know
We out here thuggin'
Wrong wit'cha, black? Why you out here strugglin'?
Chrome on my lap, I ain't gotta say nothin'
Just go on with the stack
Never seen my face but my name is The Jack

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
We goin' hard for three days with no sleep
In the streets, I can do this all week
A lot of kush and syrup, my bottle be on steep
So from sun up to sun down, I'm on the creep
I won't stop 'til my casket is six feet
But all the hatin' got me movin' around on the street
I ain't goin' places as long as I'm on my feet
But cross the line and your mama and your wife beat
Jealousy got 'em both out spreading lies
Instead of hustling they plotting on my demise
All the while my mind is on cream pies
I'm on the rise, my pockets bigger then Beyonce's thighs
Damn, why they hating on a playa, mayne?
Fuck 'em all, I'm just tryin to get that paper, mayne
And I'm gonna get it any way that it come
If you looking for me, I'll be in the streets like a bum

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Here I come again with that thunder, mayne
I'm gonna go to jail if they run my name
So I'm outta there with that powder there
Hear some gangsta been in custody and await appeal
Come upstate, in Allah, my faith
On the block with my nigz, up dumb-ass late
Gettin' paper, shook the boys but I barely escape
Eyes wide, not fly, but I'm barely awake
Gettin' high and my memory's fading away
But I remember all my niggas from back in the day
For my nigga ridin' 'round foot, hop in the J
Took a hit from the stick, we was lovin' it, boy
'Til this day I'm the shit and I'm lovin' it, boy
This street shit mine, yeah, they lovin' the boy
A couple suckas act like they don't know me no more
But I never gave a fuck 'cause this shit ain't for you

[Chorus]
