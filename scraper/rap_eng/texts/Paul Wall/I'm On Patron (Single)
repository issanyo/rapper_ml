I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
Hey wat it do

My wrist well froze up like a computer glitch
I'm drinkin 151 karaboolu take nine gone get it jumpin
Like a kangaroo is it cho birthday let's go on have
A shot or two my partner glu you put me on to somthin new
Snuck in a gallon of lemonade from chic-fil-a
Mix it up with this a rokin' we gona partay
I'm lookin for a hot girl that like ta ay baybaybay
Come out and play let's see ya shake it this way
That patron clear as day I'm on that hard
I'm gettin lit with my dawgs havin a party with
There brods...
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
Gone and poppin' another bottle get this party to crakin
All these barby doll models make the champs start backin
550s everywhere nothing can't depend it, hes on his fifth premiere
At seven it ain't even eleven
Thug boss slim thug drikin gpo greygoose patron and orange juice
Po me som mo
Now box and poppy joe just ordered the rose mo
Drunkin duces to my partner how I see him big go
I'm loaded like a full clip
Leanin like a sinkin ship
Lit up like a christmas tree
How much throwd up can I get
C stone and lil'c
Bringin out the yeager bomb
If I get pulled over dj jonny can pay my bond off...
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
I keep bumpin into people say man my bad
I'm intoxicated a tad and the dj had to be
Miskin mike and scad my family gettin slammed
Needs a cool waiges bought around another damn grand
Man I'm so throwed I can't think
Who the hell been puttin they lips on my drink
What the hell the waitress doin with my change
Mabey some red bull will help you sober up
Matter fact mix it with this greygoose in my cup
I can barely stand up I'm about to throw up
If you can't roll with the big dawgz go hang with the pups...
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome
