[Paul Wall - Talking]
Paul Wall, the Chick Magnet's in stores baby
It's the People's Champ, The Future's comin' soon
Pimp Squad Clique, Grand Hustle where ya at
It's Paul Wall

I'm 23 and I'm on top of my game
I'm in a CaddiLincoln on swang with a fist-full of grain
5900 South Lee, boys hustlin' stain
Weed, water, ex, crack, oil and cocaine
Wrist-wear, ear-muffs and a iced out chain
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm just gettin' this change
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
I'm iced out, mouth and neck
Princess cuts in baguettes
The figures in my check
Puttin' competition in check
These boys try to race me
But they too far behind
While they worried about playin' catch-up
I'm at the finish-line on my grind
I chose to be a playa
You chose to be hater
That's the reason you stuck at home
And I'm on the road gettin' paper
Stackin' cash and gettin' dough
T-Farris be bookin' shows
Money, hoes, and fancy cars
That's the playa life that I know
From MLK to McCalver Rd
I'm takin' every dollar that's sold
It's the People's Champ
