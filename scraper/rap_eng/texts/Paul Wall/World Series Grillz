[Intro]
Let's go, we're going to the World Series
We got World Series grills baby
World Series grills, World Series grills, World Series grills, World Series grills

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
World Series grills (grills)
World Series grills (grills), World Series grills (yeah)
World Series grills (yeah), World Series grills
World Series grills (let's go), World Series grills (bling bling)
World Series grills (bling bling)
We finally got our World Series grills (bling bling)
World Series grills (bling bling)
We finally got our World Series grills (bling bling)

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Fifty-five years is a long ride
We at Minute Maid park baby goin' live
Cup double like Correa, time to pour the Sprite
Grind hard, money long like Game 5
Dallas Keuchel on the hill, World Series grills
Wayne comin' round the corner like Altuve on the steal
Morton got to seal the deal, Bregman how you feel?
It's the Houston strong, Astros always trill
Springer dinger out the park, MVP
Verlander strike 'em out, one two three
Lance McCullers curve, haters can't see me
Slab squatin' like McCann, it's the Astros baby

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
World Series grills, World Series grills (grills)
World Series grills (grills), World Series grills (yeah)
World Series grills (yeah), World Series grills
World Series grills (let's go), World Series grills (bling bling)
World Series grills (bling bling)
We finally got our World Series grills (bling bling)
World Series grills (bling bling)
We finally got our World Series grills (bling bling)

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
The strobes hit the field, I swear we shining
George Springer just caught fire, it's perfect timing
If you're Houston Texas born it was a dream
Now it's World Series grills for the team
From Hurricane Harvey to a party
Altuve on the play, go kill 'em shawty
Blow the roof off Minute Maid, make some noise
And we keeping everybody, pay them boys
Hitting homers, stealing bases, going live
Yeah, been tryna get it since the Colt-45
Them throws here to stay, keep grinding
At the parade coming down with a mouth full of diamonds

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
World Series grills, World Series grills
World Series grills, World Series grills
World Series grills, World Series grills
World Series grills, World Series grills (bling bling)
World Series grills (bling bling)
We finally got our World Series grills (bling bling)
World Series grills (bling bling)
We finally got our World Series grills (bling bling)

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
H-Town throw it up like I been drinking Henny
Go 'Stros, got my whole city dranking with me
We celebrating, we gon' drank until we break a kidney
I love my city, when I die I want to take it with me
[?] when I'm feeling like a real boss
DC Minute, look I could never take my grill off
We goin' hard on them boys, them boys real soft
Time to turn all the way deaf, it's time to turn your chill off
Bet I'ma knock it out the park like Altuve
Cut your camera phone on, we making a movie
We poppin' bottles, throwing money like some strippers with us
All you gotta be is not hater, you can kick it with us

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
World Series grills, World Series grills
World Series grills, World Series grills
World Series grills, World Series grills
World Series grills, World Series grills (bling bling)
World Series grills (bling bling)
We finally got our World Series grills (bling bling)
World Series grills (bling bling)
We finally got our World Series grills (bling bling)
