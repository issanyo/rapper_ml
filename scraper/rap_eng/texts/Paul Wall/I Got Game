It ain't nothin to a playa baby
Im babalous, i got game
Read my slang, baby
It ain't nothin to a playa cause im babalous, i got game

Its just a day in the life
Play like im shy
But im fly
Say what I like
A lot of dudes prayin i dont lay with they wife
But you can have her back
Its ok, you alright
I dont want her for life, she just gon stay for the night
So calm your nerves, cause your way too up tight
Your sharin your girl wit a playa tonight
So deal with it homie

My honey gets jealous everytime i hang with they fellas
But my money gets jealous when im hangin with cinderellas
They think i got they glass slippers, but i got a news flash
I not your ass-kisser, you'll get cruised past
Scoop up a lil momma in a H2 hummer
Grab the cucumber
You a woman?do somethin
Id cut for ya, but your not the one
So go back to ya baby-daddy, just call me for fun
Hun
Its all good, girls come and they go
I gotta get one thing straight when they come through the door
No, i ain't trippin, but if your trippin, keep trippin, you'll fall
And that means you'll be replaced to take a trip in the fall
Im undefeated when it comes to hollarin at white girls
When im in the club dudes be got somethin like girls
They askin if im mackin to they ex-girlfriend
Well, that all depends on what your ex-girl spends

Ok, let me break it down
Its a numbers game
Im gunna give you a few examples
Just peep what im sayin
Im 72 percent mackin to hoodrats
The other 28 got STD's
Thats true facts
Picture me in a honey-dip, off in the benz
Off with the top, now we flyin off in the wind
She offerin skins but, no i just wanna be friends
Cause lil' momma steady coughin up flem
I can't do it but
Movin' on in the blue Yukon
This lil chick on the side, steady usin the horn
As she demonstrates all that she can do with her tongue
Invitin me to come through for some bun
Give me ya number, Im 88 percent on them dark-skinned ladies
They be tellin me that we would make beautiful babies
But that translates to, I wanna drive your mercedes
But this boy spittin game ain't lame
Know what im sayin man?

I pit stop
This lil chicks on my jock
Im rich but she think im not so i switch to a six drop
Its a mystery like hitchcock
Why the rims keep on spinnin when the car makes a quick stop
I love mackin to some stuck-up chicks
I treat em like piss, and still pull five out of six
They in my mix for my 24 inch chrome kicks
But fix ya brain, cause papa-bear dont trick
Give me a kiss, muah
I love hispanic girls that resemble selina
They tell me, Aiy papy, bomonos seena, coseina
But all of those dont translate
What this chicka sayin?
I ain't playin
I like girls all types, all colors
I got a army of temporary part-time lovers
When through with em, ima scoop up one of my many others
Its probably they sisters, they cousin, maybe even they mothers
