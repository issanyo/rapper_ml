(feat. Chamillionaire & Lil Keke)
[Paul Wall: talkin]
I'm Comin Down, Bangin Screw
Lookin Good, Feelin Good

[Chorus:]
You know I'm a crawl slow
Popped up sittin on my swangas & 4
Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on
I'm a stay playa, you know playas dough
So when I come through
I got my diamonds exposed
I'm comin down, crawlin slow[4x]
I got my diamonds exposed

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Well it's that grain gripper
That hold the throne
I'm straight up outta dat third coast
I split cigars, and pour up bars[? ]
So pop it seal[? ]
Let's take a toast
I stunt the most, I'm still holdin
My paint wet, and the streets soakin
I'm runnin diamonds like James on it[? ]
With the top down & windows open
Posted up just like da rat[? ]
On South Lee with big mix
My partner Black got 2 chicks that's turnig tricks
And work for Texas[? ]
Stayin licks since I was six
With ice grill and diamond lips
So boy I'm about to pull Alboricks[? ]
Now watch your step, my paint drips
I'm dueced up in Seirra Mist
My bass loud, and I'm crawlin slow
I'm draped up, yea that's fasho
Them karot stones they make me glow
I'm slamin do's, and I'm sitting low
I been in the game since 94
I'm gettin dough, my pockets fat
And all black, just like the crow
Where tha hoe's, where that drink
Where tha money, I need that bank
Come up of out that, cash my dogg
I'm bout that bread, you think I ain't
I'm a country boy from South Texas
Better known as the land of the trill
I'm tippin 4's, and I'm flippin hoe's
And I'm comin down with it yea! [? ]

[Chorus:]
You know I'm a crawl slow
Popped up sittin on my swangas & 4
Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on
I'm a stay playa, you know playas dough
So when I come through
I got my diamonds exposed
I'm comin down, crawlin slow[4x]
I got my diamonds exposed

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Chamillitary Mayne!
Takin pics with this model chick
And she lookin thick, said she from atlanta
Tellin me she love my talk, and she live in texas
And love the grammer, tellin me she banged it screw
And she need a pic of my on the camera
Whole crew say that boy bad
So I looked at them and said "Gon have her"
Uhn, Playa don't have to talk
Look at my chain and ask the cost
Diamonds on my neck yea that's a house
Soon as I'm done might pass her off[? ]
Red double seal[? ], yea that's the south
Blue upper seal[? ], yea that's the north
AC blow, yea that's my frost[? ]
All of that smoke yea that's his house
In my I-M-P-A-L-A, Impala
I-M-A-P-L-AY-A and balla
I drop her off and say call ya tomorrow
She callin me back askin how come I ain't call her
Cause I'm chasin my paper still & you know how jealous my papa get
You know I'm attached to my paper
Tryna hold it down like a paper clip
Pimp C had told me if you see the chick then take the chick
And if you a playa you'll get chose
And these other boys will go pay for it

[Chorus:]
You know I'm a crawl slow
Popped up sittin on my swangas & 4
Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on
I'm a stay playa, you know playas dough
So when I come through
I got my diamonds exposed
I'm comin down, crawlin slow[4x]
I got my diamonds exposed

[Verse 3: Lil Keke]
Dirty south stand up
H-Town's finest
Don Ke
Aye, I ride big, and I shine bright
And I'm lookin good, and my swag right
My paint wet, and my slab tight
My chain gold, and my diamonds white
I'm Don Ke, and this H-Town
Them playas chose, and them hatas mad
I'm screwed up, and I'm underground
And I'm still trill like, Bun & Chad
Gucci shades, with them new lens
Crawlin slow in this blue Benz
Comin through with this bad broad
Me, her, & her 2 friends
Hatas lookin, I still ball
26's they real tall
My grill did, my rocks big, my screens on, my top fall
Popped up with them 4's on
21 but she still grown
I let her ride & get inside
Cause "I'm A G" was her ringtone
Hit the stage with my diamons hot
They don't know what my shine bout
Dirty south my grind spot
Boys hatin but I still hot
So clean in this dirty game
Still a legend with plenty fame
My ice nice like Paul & Cham
Pay attention it color change
TF Records & Swisha House
Chamillitary & SUC
Ask the streets I'm still the best
This whole state it belong to Ke

[Chorus:]
You know I'm a crawl slow
Popped up sittin on my swangas & 4
Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on
I'm a stay playa, you know playas dough
So when I come through
I got my diamonds exposed
I'm comin down, crawlin slow [x4]
I got my diamonds exposed
