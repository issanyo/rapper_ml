Sippin the barre, grippin the grain
I got seventeen karats in my piece and chain
I'm Sip - sippin the barre, grippin the grain
I got seventeen karats in my piece and chain
I'm Sip - sippin the barre, grippin the grain
I got seventeen karats in my piece and chain
I'm Sip - sippin the barre, grippin the grain
I got seventeen karats in my piece and chain

[Verse 1 - Paul Wall]
Go on and open up ya map and take a trip down south
Come on over to Houston, Texas - welcome to the Swisha House
It's the land of the trill I'm comin live from the block
I got my mind on my hustle I'm tryna make it to the top
So I put in work and stackin knot, determination is all I got
On the grind I scheme and plot whatever it takes to raise my stock
I'm breakin bread out here tryna survive
I'm under water with these sharks, praying I stay alive
I'm puttin up numbers like Garnett on that 6 - 10 south
Ain't nothin soft about my block - except them packs of the soft
You see that People's Champ talk it's the expression of a G
And I'm a be chasin after them G's until I R.I.P
It's Paul Wall baby what it do been bangin Screw since '92
Fat Pat, and Lil'Keke, Pokey, HAWK and the rest of the crew
So who's next with the plex I'm flippin slab and wavin hood
With screens hangin down from the roof I'm ballin like a true playa should I'm...

[Verse 2 - Paul Wall]
They got you thinkin Houston, Texas the home of David Carr
But really it's candy paint - playas sippin on barre
Come take a walk with a star straight outta that lone star state
Where Michael Watts trained and taught me I gotta hold my weight
That motivation is the key when you movin them ki's
Entrepreneurs up in the game out of the 7 - 1 - 3
See one of the keys to my success I switched up like Greg Maddux
While maintainin my composure to become one of the baddest
I stick to the G Code and my (?)is closed
While I'm tippin on 4 - 4's with these suicide do's
I buy the dro and po' a 4 for my doggs that died in the past
Prayin to God I stay afloat just to make this hustle last
It's grind time, obeying the laws while my life is on trial
I'm tryna knock off piece and chain and throw some ice in my smile
It's all work and no play I'm out here punchin that clock
It's hustlemania out here grindin on the block, I'm tryna ball baby...

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Paul Wall]
From the third coast trenches where the killers don't think
Where these boys be slugged up and tatted up with that ink
These little cowards tryna assasinate the character of a G
But I'm squashin all of that chatter keepin it real and being me
It's G's up and marks down while I'm makin my rounds
I'm up in NYC with DipSet we shuttin it down
Shouts out to Kenyon Martin holdin it down in the low post
While I'm on the block grindin tryna hold my post
A glass house on the grill, my necklace glow like toxic waste
I'm iced out like frozen food sippin on the skeet chase
I'm overtime on that grind it ain't no time for playin games
That's why I hustle 25/8 accumulatin this change
I got the diamonds up against the wood, grippin grain and sippin good
Hustle town that's my hood gettin money is understood
I'm on that hustle baby all night and all day
A hundred D up in my safe, it's safe to say that boy is paid
