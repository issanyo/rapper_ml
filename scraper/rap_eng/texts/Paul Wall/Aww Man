[Intro: Noochie]
Ayy
Yeah
Yup

[Chorus: Noochie]
Aw man, goddamn
Aw man, goddamn, uh

[Verse 1: Noochie]
We don't pay no attention to niggas wantin' attention
Deebo-ed your whole position, now look what it got us hittin'
Alright, this shit I'm feelin', don't give a fuck how you feelin'
My life consists of livin', I want something, I get it
D-damn, I been a menace, they treatin' me like a villain
If you need you a grill then why don't you call up the dentist?
With diamonds, I'm shinin' in it, my problem is private bitches
I'm tryna fuck with some sisters, my mindset is monumental
My Sprinter is not a rental, my breakfast ain't continental
My flexin' ain't accidental, who fronted the fundamentals?
I body these instrumentals, who said I had to be gentle?
I run this shit like it's Temple then hit you right in your temple, d-damn

[Chorus: Noochie]
Aw man, goddamn
Aw man
Why the fuck they let us in here?

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Lord, have mercy, fire to help us out
I got them all lookin', starin' every time I smile
Sittin' sideways like a profile
You think I ain't the shit, you in denial
I'm sittin' crooked like a politician
Diamonds twinkle and glisten
Bitch, shut up and listen
On a four, I'm sippin', real low, I'm sittin'
Boys wanna talk down, on my haters, I'm shittin'
Never get caught slippin', trippin' on a bitch for what?
I'm all about them Franklins, frankly not about no sluts
I know you see me gettin' bucks, now you got hope
You should be focused on your paper but you're watchin' me close
But you can watch these nuts, please raise up
Hard work keep my bank account paid up
Took a loss, bounced back, never gave up
Still sittin' clean on chrome, gettin' back caked up

[Chorus: Noochie]
Aw man, goddamn
Aw man
Why the fuck they let us in here?
