[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Let me tell you about the time I smoked with B-Real
Smokeout '09, that shit was mad trill
Fresh off the plane in LAX
From Houston Texas, 'soon as I land my game blessed
RAW cone so thick with the glass tip
I hit that shit and coughed up a lung quick
Sen Dog laughed and said "homie, don't trip
Catch your breath and take another hit, playa keep it lit"
I'm chokin', still smokin', choppin' game with the smoke gods
Oh my god, leanin' like a tripod
[?] rolled it up so large
Going so hard I swear I could see stars

[Hook]
Let me tell you 'bout the time
Let me tell you 'bout the time I smoked with Cypress Hill
Let me tell you 'bout the time
Let me tell you 'bout the time I smoked with Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill, Cyp-Cypress Hill
Cyp-Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill, Cyp-Cypress Hill
Cyp-Cypress Hill

[Verse 2: Berner]
Let me tell you 'bout the time
Let me tell you 'bout the time I smoked with B-Real
I had flavors, we was gone, we burnt a weed field
Made a album in a week, we smoked with Snoop Dogg
Wiz Khalifa, Baby Bash, Devin and Paul Wall
We was all across the world burnin' pounds with fans
Cops hopped on the bus, he told us grow more plants
Let me tell you 'bout the time I lost my mind
I was on jet fuel and cold Moonshine
Papers burnin' slow, B-Real rolled good
With some hash in the middle of a fresh backwood
Paul got me chillin' with a cup so white
Let me tell you 'bout the time I put bo on ice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Now let me tell you about the time I smoked with B-Real and Sen
It was 2010 way out in Amsterdam
It was hella cloudy backstage, the crowd was ready to blaze
And Bobo and [?] turn't it up to a race
I smoked a swizzle, that's a joint laced with kief and hash oil
Cause Dr. Greenthumb grows in [?] and soil
Light 'em up back to back like a merry go round
Some bad bitches VIP passin' Mary around
Then somebody passed that vapor
Now I'm high as a skyscraper
Cause if you smoke with Cypress Hill you know you smokin' major
Yeah yeah, you know you smokin' playa when you put that in the aiar
What about that time we smoked in Hollywood right on La Brea

[Hook]
