[Hook: Pony Boy]
I light up, I get down
I crumble medical and pass it around
I light up, I get down
I crumble medical and smoke by the pound
Grinder grinder fill it up
Twist it till I break a bird
All the homies know what's up
It's all about that buddah love
Buddah love, buddah love
Buddah love, that buddah love

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Buddah love is on the raise, gotta get it every time
You know I'm higher than a fire
Escape through the gather, smoke that pound
I blow that lime all day, fuck around with Ronnie Ray
Bay batch on the cash and the hash
Motherfuck you and that shit you say
I ain't no player hater, I smoke a vaporizer
I bump the badest bitch in the club
In the late night get inside her
You best believe it when I breathe it I get ultra high
And I don't hide it, I devide it cause I'm ultra fly
That cotton candy kush, don't smoke that reggie bush
Got stopped at the border one time and I asked my girl hide it in her bush

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
When I wake up I break it up
Roll it, light it and take a puff
Every morning I go green
It comes from the earth, it's the greatest stuff
And that satellite had me feeling right
Party all night till the sun exposed
Hand full of [?]
And I'm ready to go, is the liquor store still closed?
No? Yes? Oh, let's smoke some
Need a weed fix like I just broke something
I need a vacay from my vacay
Cuase I'm all alone [?]
House party got my crib like a [?] house
Full of swisher wrappers like the Swishahouse
My living room look like dorm room
5 people laying on the couch all passed out
I'm drinking beer for breakfast
I'm pouring liquor for lunch
But I can't find any oil
I'm looking for some money to [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Berner]
It's the weedman, no cigarilla
I stay loaded, throw me a pillow
I ain't talkin' 'bout a nap when I'm talking 'bout a pillow
I'm on [?], please no White Widow
Young burn, I'mma stop with the smoke
I put good dick and strong in her throat
I been high since 96
I brought a trippystick and a bong for the hoes
Oh, money don't grow on trees?
Ever thought about growing weed?
Cause I got a big room 'bout to bloom that's worth atleast 400 G's
