[Chorus]
All the haters hate, every time I shine
I'm like why they mad at me, cause I'm on my grind
But I'm here to tell you, you can do it too
But if you're always roaching, I can't fool with you

[Verse: Z Ro]
Uh, everywhere I go it be a hater
But I can't see them, all I be seeing is the paper
If she don't give it up, this sucker gon try to rape her
Ol "pedophile face ass" nigga, you a faker
Ol "hate me, cause he ain't me" ass nigga
I'm a "ain't rapping til you pay me" ass nigga
You a "laying on the couch lazy" ass nigga
"Bum boy, you must be crazy" ass nigga
Took too much blood, sweat, and tears just to get this far
I ain't never ever think I could get this car
As soon as I'm settled in, I'll be moving again
A quarter mil down payment, Imma do it again
Made it hardly in the club, and Imma do it again
All the dancers leaving with me, I guess they choosing again
Going home by yourself, that's why you mad, my nigga
Don't hate me, I'll help you get a bag, my nigga

[Chorus]
All the haters hate, every time I shine
I'm like why they mad at me, cause I'm on my grind
But I'm here to tell you, you can do it too
But if you're always roaching, I can't fool with you

[Verse: Paul Wall]
They say good things come to those who wait
But fuck that bullshit, gimme the cake
Every dollar, dime I can make, keep the hate
Just gimme what's mine, and fix your own damn plate
I put it down, but I'm not down with lying
All I know is hard work, I'm not afraid of the grind
And when you shine, boys love to talk about you
Instead of trying, they'd rather be on the side watching
Don't be afraid to fail, you just gotta try
All businessmen don't wear suit and tie
Don't let your opportunities pass on by
If you want handouts and titty, I am not that guy
I made somethin out of nothin, you can do it too
No excuses, just grind. Pahtna, what that do?
Stay true to the game, don't fall for the bait
And when they swerve, Imma be straight
Get the cake, let them hate

[Chorus]
All the haters hate, every time I shine
I'm like why they mad at me, cause I'm on my grind
But I'm here to tell you, you can do it too
But if you're always roaching, I can't fool with you
