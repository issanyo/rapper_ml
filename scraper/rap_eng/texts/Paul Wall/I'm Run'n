[Intro/Hook]
I'm running I'm running
Ran up on a plug (dab)(plug in)
I'm runnin' I'm runnin'

[Verse 1 - PyRexx]
Jesus is the plug go on and plug it up
Show you what it was teach you how it's done
Never will I give up
Put that on my kids I
Put that on my mama
I'm livin' and breathin'

This is the season

All up in your hood preachin'
All up in your hood teachin'
Open your Bible and makin' disciples
This is what they needin'
Body of Christ and I represent
And I'm gettin mine's
Everyday you can see I'm on my grind
I'm in the streets an ambassador
I got ? all up in Canada
I'm poppin just like a panda does
Panda panda panda panda

[Intro/Hook]
I'm running I'm running
Ran up on a plug (dab)(plug in)
I'm runnin' I'm runnin'

[Verse 2 - Paul Wall]
I'm runnin' from my demons
Full sprint gotta catch my breath
Hard times sometimes it's hard to tell what's a test
I pray when I rise throughout the day and when I rest
Renewed spirit I got's to keep my faith refreshed
Gimme success, keep the stress
Saved, I don't fear death
I'm running late to Bible study traffic was a mess
God's love is simple. Checkers bro, it ain't chess
Whenever I'm lost I follow God's GPS
Ran up on the preacher said a prayer, then kept on my quest
I always give my best, nothing less
We spread love you can save the drama, keep the mess
Reppin for that Houston Tex: Paul Wall and PyRexx

[Intro/Hook]
I'm running I'm running
Ran up on a plug (dab)(plug in)
I'm runnin' I'm runnin'

[Verse 3 - Canon]
Can't stop it
I'm insane get the baton I can't drop it
? Get up out of pocket
? stay constant
? Stay conscious
What's the option?
?
All the people
?
I been running like 2 Chains
? 2 Planes
? 2 Lanes
? Skiert
? Runnin
?All Hundreds
?
Scummy
?
Come with it
?
Run with me
