[Big Cat]
You about to witness the strength in front of a bitch

[Chamillionaire]
Sony Music, Interscope, Universal Records and Def Jam
Let a nigga speak to the head man, ya lookin' for me (Here I Am)
Attention to all of my best friends, and bootleggers hell yes Cham
Crush anyone up against him, ya lookin' for me (Here I Am)
Even when he ain't got no weapon
Niggas that's street they was wit' Cham
So give a nigga respect damn, ya lookin' for me (Here I Am)
Dirty-South (Here I Am), is ya wit me (Yes I Am)
Color Changin' Click clack, gimme the gat nigga (BAM!)

Where Mista Madd? (Here I Am), where the boy Yung Ro (Here I Am)
What up Paul, what up Rasaq and Lew Hawk, what up Twin
Big Cat (What up Cham?), they say that you think that you tough man
Get on the mic and say somethin, to the major labels (Fuck them!)
Haha, a wise man once said don't diss the majors cuz you might need em'
But it's obvious by this intro a nigga like me didn't believe em'
Rudest, the way the labels percieve him, but I ain't - in this game to make friends
Make love to ya label or hold hands, so tell em' again (Fuck them!)
The difference between them and me is I AM A G
While you still tryin' to fix up your I M A G E
Fix up your image, ya click is a gimmick, ya pistols are rented
Ya click will diminish, cuz this is ya finish, nigga admit
Cuz every line you spit is invented, nigga I'm in it
My zone, I'm hungry I won't turn down a meal
But don't shoot a deal at Chamill, and think that he won't turn down a mil'
Better get a whole 'lotta mics for this one, cuz no magazine wants to piss him off
Because I gotta loud voice in the south and I promise, niggas is listening
Koopa

Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas (Where else Cham?)
Mississippi, Georgia and Texas, I know ya wit me? (Yes I Am)
Color Changin' Click yep thats my fam
Paid in Full Records thats my fam
And anybody else I'm forgettin', Swishahouse (Here I Am)
Radio DJ's (Here I Am), and to all my fans (Here I Am)
Where that Northside (Here I Am)

The world ain't ready but here I Am
