Jesus Christo
Mucho Bendito's

[Verse 1: Husalah]
Bitch I rolled off the pot
Shell catcher hanging off the air-15 that's a 40 chop
High school dropout to a drop
Tell your bitch on my dick it was all off the rock
Poured a four off in my soda pop
Hit the block imma show you how I rock
Young Husalah
Bitches Husalah's
Knocking shots at the fusspots
Who fucking wit the mob bitches nobody
You nigga's run your mouth but ain't got no bodies
Your bitch is on my dick I bet she know me probably
Off top, they call me Hussy
Your bitch got me saved in her phone
It's Geico, there's no insurance on the bitch


[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
No insurance, cash only baby, cash deposit
Red soda, Red soda
I'm getting muddy cup runneth over
I got that bread that's why I keep the toaster
Watch out for the pigs trying to meet their quota's
Grab your camera, watch how I pull up on them pokers
Watch how you approach us my partners on wanted posters
Chain smokin' backwoods like Newports
I took your bitch bro you was a good sport
Rest in peace Miso shout out to my partner Sport
Boys hatin' I wanted to box they wanted to go to court
Your paper short, you's a dork, bitch pour court
I pour up, pop pills, and smoke, I don't shoot or snort
You snitches watching bout to go report
Write a report on Al Rucker and who came to report
Its Mr Paint Bottle, AKA A today
Put your hate away, bitch I'm muddy like the month of May
Muddy like the month of May
Extra money
Ditch out there rain, it's muddy

[DJ Mr Rogers]
Ain't no courage for your hoe when she slippin' through Mr Rodgers neighbourhood
So watch your bitch
Watch your pockets cause we coming for both
One time for the homie Paul Wall he the slab God
One time for the wild figures
H town to the Bay connect
Ain't no insurance on a bitch
Never have been, never will be partner
What's understood ain't gotta be said
You know what it is
RIP to the Jacka
Rest in peace homie
