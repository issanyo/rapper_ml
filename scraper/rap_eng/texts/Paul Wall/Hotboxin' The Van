[Intro: Paul Wall]
What you mean you don't smoke?
Then you not rollin' with us
We hotboxin' this van up

[Hook: Paul Wall]
We hotboxin' the van hoe, hotboxin' the van hoe
If you rollin' then you smokin' cause we hotboxin' the van hoe
We hotboxin' the van, we hotboxin' the van
If you roll with us then you smoke with us cause we hotboxin' the van hoe

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
When we roll out we roll up
Simply the best and nothin' but
Roll that window all the way up
Light the bud and pass me the cup
Codeine over ice with no cut
Them boys smokin' I don't know what
I'm twistin' up that OG, that ill wax 'bout to have me stuck
Open the door, let the smoke escape
Paperplanes with some good kief cake
Turn the grinder and roll that shake
[?]
Five cigars, light 'em all in once
Backwood leaf rolled tight as a blunt
Shirt will smell like kush for a month
And brush your teeth, your mouth is a skunk
Roll with us and come smoke with us
In the SUV or a long white bus
Hit it, slow it long, no rush
Pass it around but please no dust
We hotboxin' the van up, all my smokers stand up
If you rollin' with us and you smokin' put your hands up

[Hook]
We hotboxin' the van hoe, hotbox-hotboxin' the van hoe
If you rollin' then you smokin' cause we hotboxin' the van hoe
We hotboxin' the van, hotbox-hotboxin' the van
If you roll with us then you smoke with us cause we hotboxin' the van hoe

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside
It's ain't no squaredance, take your asses home
Over here by the astrodome and I just rolled me a massive cone
Yeah you gonna need some fog lights
Cloudy and all white, we gon' do this all night
Sometimes we crack the windows mane
But when it's popo's around, disappear like David Blane

[Hook]

[Bridge: Paul Wall]
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside
And we hotboxin' that van up, hotboxin' that van up

[Verse 3: Marcus Manchild]
So hotboxin' that van, lil mama know my plans
Hit the vaporizer with 3 grams, get a little weed, that's to enhance
Now I'm in the whip with about 10 freaks
[?] just brought me 10 sweets
So I got the purple then I got the diesel from Paul Wall in about 2 weeks
I'mma hit St. Louis with my pictures, they keep that country grammar
[?] from my nigga Playboy who stay out in east Atlanta
So I hopped in the whip, pushed back on black and tinted so you know it
Them braids is straight flew open when I roll it bitches smokin' cuuuuh

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro: Paul Wall]
So whatchu gonna do? You smokin' or you walkin'?
Cause we gon' hotbox this van up baby
