[Hook: Paul Wall]
Please don't spill my drink, please don't spill my drink
Straight up out the pharmacy, it cost up bout a frame
Please don't spill my drink, please don't spill my drink
Cause it can knock it over, you gonna come up off some bank

Please don't spill it, please don't spill it
Please don't spill it, please don't spill it
Please don't spill it, please don't spill it
Please don't spill it, don't spill it
Please don't spill it, don't spill it
Please don't spill it, don't spill it
Please don't spill it, don't spill it

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Sipping on the coldest of the potent codeine in my cup
Bartender i could have been the way I mixed em sodas up
Different combinations, mixes, everyday I switch it up
And if you ain't think that I ain't muddy, bitch you got me so fucked up
So we can not go blow this cover, I'ma let this shit be known
I'ma knock you in your dome, if you so touch this Styrofoam
Swang on you like I was swanging, tippin' on some chrome
If a single drop spill, then its on, its on

[Hook: Paul Wall]
Please don't spill my drink, please don't spill my drink
Straight up out the pharmacy, it cost up bout a frame
Please don't spill my drink, please don't spill my drink
Cause it can knock it over, you gonna come up off some bank

Please don't spill it, please don't spill it
Please don't spill it, please don't spill it
Please don't spill it, please don't spill it, my drank
Please don't spill it, don't spill it
Please don't spill it, don't spill it
Please don't spill it, don't spill it
Please don't spill it, don't spill it, my drank

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Hold up, look what you doing nigga watch my cup
Smoking cookie blunts, Memphis nigga drinking yellow tuss
And I'm bumping Pimp C, riding with me a thick yellow slut
Yeah she just give me head, nah, she gonna roll my blunt, uh
Pour me up a 8, then I dip my blunt in it, ay
I'ma keep it pimpin', sneakers by Givenchy
Medicine what I'm sippin'
My boy Paul Wall just hit me,  said he on the way to Memphis
Damn the yellow got me itchin'
