(Akon: Konvict, Konvict ....)

[Intro : T-Pain]

Damn lil' mama
You thought Akon & T-Pain was the only ones in love with a stripper?
Forgot to mention Twista, Pimp-C, Pall Wall, MJG , AND Too Short?
Y'know we had to remix this
.

[Verse 1: T-Pain]

She got the body of a goddess everybody knows that
Super Cute face and a booty so fat
I'm in the club dropping twenty-four stacks
Cuz I'm in love and that's a well known fact
Like, yeah she know what she doing
If a nigga chillin' with a stripper then he never go back home
She got eyes butter pecan brown can't leave it alone
Likin' the way she break it down to the flo'
Need to get her over here show her where
It's about to go down right now
I'm in love with a stripper


[Verse 2: Twista]

You wanna know where Twista be on fifty
T-Pain invited me to Magic City
I'm about to have some fun 2001, in these pocket all my e-fizzles with me
I like the way mama get up on the table
I like the way she pour the honey in her naval
I like it when she smack her fatty and open it up in front of me
I wanna touch it but I ain't able
The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole
Look at the laffy taffy when she pop, she roll
I wanna get her in the bed right after they close
When I do a video you get the popular role
In the V.I.P. they get a little lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear telling me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on your nipple like Pac-Man
She freaking she licking she rubbing
Then she pulled my dick out and start sucking
All because I be the Twista
Even though T-Pain told me shorty was a freak
I asked her can I take her home (Down right now)

[Chorus: T-Pain]

I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She took me for a joke when I said it
I'm in love with a stripper
Got it real hot, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She took me for a joke when I said it
I'm in love with a stripper
Got it real hot, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club

[Verse 3: Pimp C]

Uh, yo I'm Pimp C
I'm a P-I-M-P, tricking ain't in my pedigree
It really ain't bout no square love
It's strictly cause she paying me
She be wantin' lay me but I can't do too much of that
Cuz even though yo ass fat, freaking off ain't where it's at
But I can show you how to get out there and get it
You love yo daddy I know ya with it
That's why I got love for you
Cuz you get out there and do what it do
Workin my piece and work the pole
Break the trick you gotta pay to roll
Get the money break 'em off
And we in the Benz and we scratchin' off


[Verse 4: Paul Wall]

It was love at first sight when i've seen that ass shaking
And 'bout fifty dollars later it was love in the making
You simply won my heart when I saw the way you work that pole
And when you bent over you had my wallet in a choke hold
I saw you in your birthday suit and baby it was fate
When you give me a lap dance its like we gone on a date
But I feel like ya cheating on me when I see you dancing with other guys
I'm runnin' low on ones, I can't lie I'm in love baby

[Chorus X2]

[Verse 5: R Kelly]

I must be the first man to ever fall in love with a ass
Gonna bow down on my knees and ask that ass to marry me
That booty makes me forget about any chick i freaked with in my past
Cause we got a lot in common: she's a stripper, i'm a freak
Made me wanna grab it
I got a habit
I gotta have it
You can call me the man of steel
Cause that ass is just like a magnet
Damn! You got me so in love
Can't stay away from this club
Everytime I find myself rolling up on them dubs
I've been around the world
Seen booty all the time
I never seen a booty thats so pretty so so fine
(Eerwuurwuurwuur) Coming down the pole
No secret why i'm cause girl you keep my donk on swole
When it "drop drop" when it "pop pop" and when it "hop hop"
Baby the way you doing that thing don't you stop stop
I want to stick it, want to kiss it
If I could I'd put my whole damn head in it
Cause I'm in love with a stripper

[Chorus X2]

[Verse 6: MJG]

I'm in love with a stripper, I need to get some stripper -counselin'-
Cause I'm the first one in the front row when they make a stripper announcement
I think I'm falling in love with the one with the most ass
Thin, little bitty waist, I'm go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen
MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tipping stop the bill
If I come in here one more night I'm gonna need Dr. Phil
But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright
Ain't no way I can turn a stripper to a housewife


[Verse 7: Too $hort]

The last girl was pretty but she wasn't fine as you
She was sexy but she couldn't do the things you do
She could dance but nothing like the way you move
I used to want her until the day I saw you
I'm a grown ass man I thought I'd seen it all
Doing all that on the pole and didn't even fall
And right then I knew exactly what it was (What's that)
I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club
