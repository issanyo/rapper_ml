[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Texas tatted on my arm got Houston on my back
Cause I love the city I'm from hands up if you feel that
I ball hard like a Texan every Sunday you catch me wreckin'
Better look fast through them intersections
Coupe named Foster cause you can't catch it
And they catch them bops like Dre do
Ball hard like I play too, run that back like Jay do
Bet a couple pounds and we play you
We came to win, can’t take a loss
Ain’t shit ‘bout that H South
Team strong we’ll break ‘em off, lay ‘em down then rake ‘em out
Car roof like Reliant when the sun’s out I drop the top
H-Town we shinin’ red white and blue in that lot
See you boys in the playoffs, bet you this year we on top
And if you from that H like me, you already know what I’m talkin’ ‘bout

[Hook]
I’m from Houston, Texas home of the Texans [x3]
Texas Tatted on my arm, Houston on my back
I’m from Houston, Texas home of the Texans [x3]
Texas Tatted on my arm, Houston on my back

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
I’m from that HOU TEX, non-believers get put to the death
Then hard times, we get put to the test, but dedication turn the last to the best
Stop complainin’ just a little bit less and start to quest on the road to success
We got now and we got next, say it loud with some bass in your chest
Haters hate but now they on jock like Joseph and Quinn the corners on lock
I come through the line like Brian Cushing and I can’t be blocked like JJ Watt
Now we on top, no more middle, like Super Mario I’m a hard hitter
Can’t be stopped, don’t be bitter, never give up ‘cause I’m a go getter
In the groupie and I wade through you, she like Torro and the whole crew
In Battle Red or Liberty White out, I might come out in the Deep Steel Blue
I thought boys knew, don’t be surprised, tell them boys about Texas pride
We ride for each other when we on the otherside and if you ain't got it go on step aside

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N T-E-X-A-N-S
Touchdown after touchdown we gonna win it
Runnin' over everybody that get in the way, we started it so we gon end it
24/7 We keep it real on field the other team they ain't spin it
Drop the top like Reliant do
I'm like a running back whenever I slide through
You say Texas ain't ready you lyin' fool
And we gon win the superbowl without trying too
Yeah you goddamn right we in the playoffs
Give you haters time to take a day off
They said we wasn't gonna make it they was way off
You better get out of town and stay out
We gon win this week next week and the week after that
Still winnin we dont plan to leave
Homies Andre Johnson and Jacoby Jones can catch anything but a damn disease
Represent like Z-Ro, represent like Slim thug, represent like Paul Wall
If they run up in the stadium [?] I better see all y'all

[Hook]

Game day when I walk up in the stadium, every body in Houston I better see all y'all
