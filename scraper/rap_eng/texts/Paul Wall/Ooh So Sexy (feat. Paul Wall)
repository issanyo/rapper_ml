(feat. Paul Wall)

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
The way you moving ooh that's crazy

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
Off you so intoxicating

Pretty feet with open toes
Scent of your neck is like a fresh red rose
X-ray vision passing through your clothes
But I really can't wait to see you naked though
The way your body move and you dip it slow
I try to play it cool but I gotta let you know
The way you looking I can tell you wanna go
Skip the preview and let's get to the show

[Paul Wall:]
My baby she kick it, she cool with all the fellas, she hood
Like taking chances but classy like Cinderella
She down like four flats, my baby girl is real, she done weathered the storm and baby down with you still

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
The way you moving ooh that's crazy

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
Off you so intoxicating

Now we at home and were all alone
With no interruptions just turn off you phone
Daddy's little girl but now that your all grown
Birthday suit is all you got on
Got the radio on and it's playing your song
Touching on your body all night long
Feels so right that it can't be wrong
Sexual healing coming on strong

[Paul Wall:]
Them curves like a coke bottle can't be beat
Pedicure every week on them cute little feet
She a freak under the covers but she keep it discrete
She's my midnight treat baby for real that's why I remain

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
The way you moving ooh that's crazy

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
Off you so intoxicating

[Paul Wall:]
She shaped like an hour glass
Slyer than a mockingbird
Baby got that smooth skin softer than some fox fur
We go together like sweaters in cold weather
Nobody can do it better baby down for whatever
She gangsta like lil kim sexy like Alicia Keys
Funny like smoore baby cooler than a summer breeze
Man I swear my baby cuter than a teddy bear, nobody compares
Lil mama baby that's why I am your man

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
The way you moving ooh that's crazy

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
Off you so intoxicating

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
The way you moving ooh that's crazy

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
Off you so intoxicating

Oh so sexy, oh so sexy, oh so sexy, oh so sexy
