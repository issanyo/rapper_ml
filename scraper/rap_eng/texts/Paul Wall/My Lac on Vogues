[Pre Hook] x 4
My lac on vogues

[Hook] x 2
Wait to see my lac, my lac
Wait to see my lac, my lac
Wait to see my lac, my lac
You ain't never seen nothing like that home boy

[Verse 1]
My sprite is each to pay one
Gucci lows, Gucci lows, you can't see me bang
5 percent my tent so you can't see me blowin' this thing
My candy is amazing, it's the color you never seen
I'm leanin, I'm leanin, so twisted I can't think
These boppers, these boppers (I'm swingin')
They'll run you dry like a sink, my paint wet is a sink
In your parking line you'll find me
I pull up in that XTS that Lincoln right behind me
My ride was in the shop last week, you boys were tryin' to clown me
Now I'm coming down and your gal on me, but I'm tryin to get this money
I got 10s on my Lac, you ain't even know what I'm talkin' about
That [?] pokin' out
You should go on and get your cameras out

[Verse 2]
I'm sittin' crooked on candies, go on and Instagram me
My surround by sound is so click, it got nominated for Grammy
I pull up, my speakers bumping loud, all my neighbors can't stand me
At the car show, I win the trophy my competition can't stand me
You punk slash, tryin' to look like me, you copy cats tryin' to stand me
Ain't nothing in life was handed to me, but the money sprite and a xany
I ride in a removable canopy who can it be, with a codeine cup
My top down and my trunk up, I'm bangin' screw when I pull up
Top notch slop, turn that up, a lot of clear coats on top of my paint
I work that wood wheel like a pro, bow down like the saint
(Drive Slow) Don't spill my drink, hold up wait, hit the breaks I'm getting that cake
Breaking of these cakes on bow ties and Texas plates I'm holdin' it
