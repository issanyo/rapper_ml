[Intro]
Pour that shit up homie
Hey man don't spill that shit though
Fill it to the top though you know what I'm saying?
Light that shit man fuck the cops

[Verse 1]
Muddy cups on Sunset
Getting money till the sun set
Leaving when the sun rise I ain't done yet
Bet on me losing that's a dumb bet
Flexing on a cheque, student loan on my neck
Everybody break their neck but I ain't even break a sweat
[?] off in the Feds he just called collect
My left wrist got more diamonds than a full deck
Coming from the San Fernando lit up like a candle
B-Real hit me with a sample, hit the wax it's hard to handle
Shout out to the pan-handle we don't pan handle
Plottin' on the scandal, why you wit yo gal, wit your scandal

[Hook]
Muddy cups on Sunset
Muddy cups on Sunset
Muddy cups on Sunset
Gettin' money till the sun set
But even when the sun rise I ain't done yet

[Verse 2]
I got more pints than an Irish pub
I got my cookie straight from burner this ain't overdub
I got more gallons than a bath tub
Better yet a whale tank, where you think I'm from
Work the wheel they goin' dumb
Clothes covered in Kush crumbs
I'm sittin' low, you low on funds
RIP Big Pun
Before I smoke, I bake the blunt
Free slab king call it blunt
Free Fishy, and nah that ain't no church fry
Double knotting and I ain't talking bout a tucked shirt tie
I'm certified til pigs fly
Slab God, slap the vicious, satellite supply

[Hook]
Muddy cups on Sunset
Muddy cups on Sunset
Muddy cups on Sunset
Gettin' money till the sun set
But even when the sun rise I ain't done yet
