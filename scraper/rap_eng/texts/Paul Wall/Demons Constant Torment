[Intro]
Not today
Not today, mm-mmh
Ayy

[Verse 1]
Temptation seems so sweet
The devil knows exactly where Iâ€™m weak
See, I got a monkey on my back
I can constantly feel my spirit under attack
Everywhere I go I see him lurking in the shadows
Waiting just to tempt me and lure me into battles
Trying to bring me down, I feel him pulling at my leg
Trying to bring me down, I feel him messing with my head
Weighing down my chest like a Kevlar vest
Preoccupying my mind 'til I forget that I'm blessed
They always want to lead me astray
But get up out the way, not today

[Chorus]
Talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'

[Verse 2]
I feel the devil comin' for my soul
Truth be told, it tends to take a toll
Cold world, keep the hating on hold
Stay prayed up, real G's don't fold
My vice look nice, but think twice
A man's soul has no price
I've gotten counseling and spiritual advice, all types
But I can still feel the demons in my head like lice
I wonder if I'll ever shake this curse
No matter how hard I try it only gets worse
There's a whole lot of pain behind this smile
They been tormenting me for a while

[Chorus]
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
They talkin' to me, sayin'
I hear 'em talkin', sayin'
