[Chorus: Paul Wall]
I'mma ride for My partner, I'll die for my dawg
If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all
I'mma watch my boy back and stay down 'till the end
And if you don't feel the same then you're not my friend
I'mma ride For my partner I'll die for my dawg
If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all
I'mma watch my boy back and stay down 'till the end
And if you don't feel the same then you're not my friend

[Verse 1:]
Man I ain't got no friends motherfuck all y'all
But when the shit goes down I'm the one y'all call
Like I Ain't Good Enough To Kick It
But I'm Good Enough To Crick It
Tell The Truth Ya'll Ain't Ready Ya I'm The One Whos Really With It
For The Ones Who Really Down There's Nothing But Love
But For You Fakers And Haters Man There's Nothing But Slugs
Catch Your Fame Get To Busting That's The End Of Discussion
You Need To Quit With All That Tough Talk Huffin And Puffin
Fuck Puffing We Could Do It We Could Go From The Shoulders
And When You Get Stomped Out I Bet You Run With The Rollers
Game Goofy As A Groupie Need To Stay In Your Lane
And Slow Your Motherfucking Roller Don't Be Saying My Name
Bitch!

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
I'mma ride for My partner, I'll die for my dawg
If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all
I'mma watch my boy back and stay down 'till the end
And if you don't feel the same then you're not my friend
I'mma ride For my partner I'll die for my dawg
If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all
I'mma watch my boy back and stay down 'till the end
And if you don't feel the same then you're not my friend

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Say I'm a Stay Ten Toes Down On The Dirt
And I'm a Ride For My Partnas Till I Get Murked
Everybody Says They Love You When You On A Shirt
But No ONe Hold You Down When Your Pockets Hurt
I'll Stay Down For My Homies Like A Friend Should
Fuck Around Boy I Wish A Motherfucker Would
You Come around when You Hear A Playa Paper Good
Or Catch Ghost When Drama Jumps Off In The Hood
I Roll Doug Raw Down For Whooping Penny Ass
Pull Out The Strap And Load Till You In The Grass
All These So Called Friends Ain't Really Down
When The Shit Pop Off They The First To Lay You Down

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
I'mma ride for My partner, I'll die for my dawg
If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all
I'mma watch my boy back and stay down 'till the end
And if you don't feel the same then you're not my friend
I'mma ride For my partner I'll die for my dawg
If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all
I'mma watch my boy back and stay down 'till the end
And if you don't feel the same then you're not my friend

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
I'm a Ride For My Niggas I Die For My Niggas
Go To War And I Let Them Slugs Fly For My Niggas
Ain't Many Real Niggas You Could Trust
Cause When Shit Go Down? Too Many Niggas Ready To Bust
Everybody Say They Friends When Shit All Good
How Many Will Be Down If You Still In The Hood
How Many Got Your Back Like A Real Friend Should
If The Day You Go Broke They'll? You Some Of That Good
You Better Wise Up And Open Your Eyes Up
Cause If You Know Like Me They All Disguised Up
That's Why I Ride Solo Even In The Photo
I Ride With My Fo Fo Smoking On That Do Do

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
I'mma ride for My partner, I'll die for my dawg
If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all
I'mma watch my boy back and stay down 'till the end
And if you don't feel the same then you're not my friend
I'mma ride For my partner I'll die for my dawg
If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all
I'mma watch my boy back and stay down 'till the end
And if you don't feel the same then you're not my friend
