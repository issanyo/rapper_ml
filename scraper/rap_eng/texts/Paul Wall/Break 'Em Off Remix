(feat. Lil Keke)
[Intro: Lil' Keke Samples]
[Scratches]
I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab

[Chorus: Lil' Keke Samples]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Now I gotta work my wood grain wheel
Poppin' trunks, poppin' pills, still poppin' seals
Higher than a hill with my mind on mill
Piece and chain, swang & bang chrome shiny grill
Baby I got million dollar dream with my mind on cream
I'm in that mean green machine clean on 19's
Flat screens in the headrests, swangin ' like a swing set
Brandy wine, paint wet, comin' down that's a bet
I'm in the lot chasin' broads like a lesbian
Full of that kush flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians
Higher than a street light, floatin' like a parachute
Buzzin' like a bumble bee, mustard green Bentley Coupe
Young gantsa mack, game sharper than a thumb tack
Breakin 'em off, makin all the boppers attract
Then they watch me, I'm rocked up, fully loaded and sloppy
Tryin' to hit it and quit it and walk off like Big Papi and break 'em off

[Chorus: Lil' Keke Samples]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab

[Verse 2: Lil' Keke]
Aye.. Aye
I pull up like this
Untouchable white wrist
I'm hotter than warm piss, berry, grape Sunkist
The trunk glow mist, five-50 slow bunny
Bentley Continental with the mink floors dummy
Paul Wall money, that's expensive taste
And them friendly ass fools, we sell 'em to Myspace
I'mma break 'em off, untill the back bone broken
Stainless steel drop Phantom leave the top open
Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose
And the kush done start burnin', better cover your clothes
Concrete crumbling
Glass shootin' lasers
Crawlin' and cutting' up on 24 razors
I'mma show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal
Chasin' paper in the morning', call me Houston Chronicle
Hold on!, then you buckle up the seat belt
Swishahouse, Young Don, Capital TF!

[Chorus: Lil' Keke Samples]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Already!
I'm higher than a satellite, crawlin' like a baby
Maneuverin' through the traffic, like I'm Tracy McGrady
Still choppin' on them buttons, I'm struttin' and looking fresh
Switch hittin' like Burton, this is ballin' at it's best
In that minute maid dropper with retractable roof
Fondling wood, wavin' the hood , student loans on my tooth
The 5th wheel on the ground and the trunk in the air
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition on player
My skills is so ill when working' that wood wheel
Tippin' 4's like a waiter, beware of the horse field
Wide screen mind frame, panoramic pimpin'
I'm sippin' on that Osama, baby leanin' like i'm limpin
In that two-seater fleeter, it's me and a senorita
3 ounces up in a liter, and it's 10 up in the heater
Mackin' a mamacita, runnin' game like a cheetah
I'm knockin 'em out the park similar to Derek Jeter break 'em off

[Chorus: Lil' Keke Samples]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma break 'em
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up deuce and ridin' slab
