[Hook x2: Angie Stone]
It ironic, it ironic, it ironic
All you wanna do is smoke chronic

[Intro: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall, Paul Wall
Roll it up, smoke it up, light it up

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
All I wanna do is smoke, roll up
All gas, no reggie no sir
I'm talkin' 'bout the type of kush that blow your wig back
High dollar sack, had another sample pack
Pack the blunt with a grandma wax
AU gold leaf, roll it tight
Light it up, man hold up
Smoke a ounce all night, I might
Do you, I'm doing me
Purp and green but no white
Heavy smoker, not light
Nothin' but that satellite

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Roosh Williams]
Young Sky Walker, I'm a high talker
Chronic bagged up, I'm 'bout to fly off to
A different state where they legalized it
So high I don't realize it
I'm swangin' through the south in a black Cadillac
Smokin' loud, eyes lookin' like I got cataract bitch
They should get an Emmy cause they just fuckin' act bitch
I'mma take [?]
Roosh Willie the mane, take a dab while your baby mama givin' me brain
Catch me smokin' out in public like it's actually legal
And you prolly gonna think the kid is really insane
And my crazy ass with the big homie Baby Bash
Got two broads sittin' on Mercedes glass
Smokin' legal like we raise some grass

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Yeah we rap a lot and we smoke a lot
That's two labels we know about
And we grow the crop and we know the spot
And these big boy blunts we smokin' on
Dabbin' on these concentrates
Got a motherfucker higher than Devin
Edible kush, Obama cakes
How many milligrams? Ain't no tellin'
Secret session, private party and it's invitation only
Cause you smokin' with The Legalizers
Trick come check my clothings nigga
