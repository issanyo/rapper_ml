What it do its Paul Wall from the 713
I'm only 59 on the block in south beach
Its all eyes on me, soon as I step on the scene
Them stars down lookin' clean drained in the skin
From the shirt to the jeans, I'm lookin' doped boy fresh
Hangin' from my neck is a deep freezer ice chest
Catch me in Omaha but it ain't like Belly
Them boys is breakin' bread out there servin' that jelly
I'ma old school player wit a new school hustle
Boys talkin' down only gettin' lost in the shuffle
Its paul wall from the lone star state
Swishahouse through the door puttin' food on my plate
Boys tryin' hate 'cause they broke and lonely
Boys used to be my homie but they all turn on me
But they don't want me they full of baloney
We'll recongize real and we'll recongize phoney
The chick magnet thats my album in stores
I'm in the compree's class bouncin' on 24's
My money run long like a wide reciever
I'm at the blue flame watchin' girls shake it like a seizure
Catch me in colorado popin' patrome bottles
I'm somethin' like Mekhi Phifer where I go, hoes follow
Boys say I'm slick at the mic 'cause the hits are out of sight
I swing the block like a fish in a fight
Its paul wall and its another platinum promotion
Since I got the swisha love hoes want my love potion
The motion of my ocean got me rockin' they boat
Not to mention they jockin' my quotes and bobbin' my quotes
I'm on another level, step ya game up
Go get some new jewelery partner get ya change up
I'm fix to change up and switch the rotation
It feels like I'm on a stakeout I'm "patiently waitin'"
These boys hatin' on me but they gettin' there own grade
I broke free from momma's chain I ain't nobodys slave
Its paul wall swishahouse swishablast
And its another platinum promotion baby

My album the chick magnet and its in stores
I'm just sayin' its goin' down baby paul wall
Chick magnet people's champ how to be a player
I'm just sayin' though know talkin' bout....
Its goin' down baby 713 new south movement in stores now
Paul wall
