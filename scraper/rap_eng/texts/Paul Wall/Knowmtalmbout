[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Two tone lac' with the sunroof rack
Parked outside, sitting on 4's
Jump out, boy still hot on my trial
I'm on that oh and it's still on my toes
20 top mop filled up with hoes
Bop was bitter cause they been exposed
Pull yo' feelings up out of your pockets
Get on your grind and stack up your O's
Where there's dough, is where I roam
I drive slow, no school zone but I'm in the zone
Sippin' the 4
Smoking that cone, hell yeah I'm blown
I'm getting that money until I'm gone
They on that hay, but still I'm on
I'm on they cake
I'm on these dimes
They on my nuts, lemme get that dome
They want my bone, I don't love these sluts
Windows up and I'm on my way
Off that bullshit, on my pay
Above these seats is blue over gray
I grind all day, no time for play
Get money is all I do
I got cash to make and hearts to break
And I'm on that, baby and thats true

Im cruisin' down the ave and im looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood

Im cruisin' down the ave and im looking good
