[Chorus]
I got the heart of a hustler (heart of a hustler)
I got the mind of a G (the mind of a G)
I'm out here gettin' my paper (gettin' my paper)
So don't fuck with me (don't fuck with me)
I got the heart of a hustler (heart of a hustler)
I got the mind of a G (the mind of a G)
I'm out here gettin' my paper (gettin' my paper)
So don't fuck with me (don't fuck with me)

[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning when the sun rise
I got my mind on paper chasing them dollar signs
It ain't no time for resting or taking naps
I got to have something so I'm counting all paper stacks
I got dreams and aspirations of ballin' big
I want a crib in the hills out there where Kobe live
And I can get it if I put my grind to it
Quit making excuses up and get out there and do it
Ain't no time for games when your chasing after change
But you can face some cause that paper and close range
My mind on a range fly chains and diamonds rings
My skills are making bills with profit and high game
Ridin the fast lane that paper in my vision
My mind on a mil ticket I'm chasing that commission
Money is my mission give me all I can get
Until they put me in a grave man I just can't quit

[Chorus]
I got the heart of a hustler (heart of a hustler)
I got the mind of a G (the mind of a G)
I'm out here gettin' my paper (gettin' my paper)
So don't fuck with me (don't fuck with me)
I got the heart of a hustler (heart of a hustler)
I got the mind of a G (the mind of a G)
I'm out here gettin' my paper (gettin' my paper)
So don't fuck with me (don't fuck with me)
Don't fuck around man

[Verse 2]
That's right doin' and moving
White linen on my tuff tails
Not an illusion three sheets to the wind
I ain't gotta be boozing
Go bad on a bitch 'till I get her improvement no I'm not with the losing
I'm dying to win I'm goin' try it again, I'm goin' cry for my sins
I live the fast life yeah and I'm not stoppin' for shit bitch
Half a tank of crank and a plot to get rich
I got money out my mind likes its a price out my hat
Still smokin' even though my lung twice to collapse
I'm right back with the sack then I'm burning the shern
You know
Better learn still yearning to earn
And really I don't listen when I talk to myself
So how the fuck you think that I'ma listen to somebody else
It's a fast life ho you know like pushin' and shit and when I run up out of gas then I'm pushin' this bitch

[Chorus]
I got the heart of a hustler (heart of a hustler)
I got the mind of a G (the mind of a G)
I'm out here gettin' my paper (gettin' my paper)
So don't fuck with me (don't fuck with me)
I got the heart of a hustler (heart of a hustler)
I got the mind of a G (the mind of a G)
I'm out here gettin' my paper (gettin' my paper)
So don't fuck with me (don't fuck with me)

[Verse 3]
I grind hard from the second I awake
When you play with high stakes you profit at high rate
No more top roman I'm tryna eat steaks
So I get up off my bump and go get that cake
It ain't no time for sleep
If you snooze you lose
If you broke it mean you're lazy that's the choice you choose
If you grind and you complaining and you wasting your time
Better correct your mind, suck it up and go grind
It's money to be made when my phone ring ring
I'm not to impressed with all the bling bling
I'm much more motivated by all the ching ching
Been grindin' since kindergarten back then it was a dream
It's money over everything family first
They goin' to bury me a G and bost swangas on the hurst
I'm on the block posted making money disperse
I thirst for dollar bills bein' broke is the worst

[Chorus]
I got the heart of a hustler (heart of a hustler)
I got the mind of a G (the mind of a G)
I'm out here gettin' my paper (gettin' my paper)
So don't fuck with me (don't fuck with me)
I got the heart of a hustler (heart of a hustler)
I got the mind of a G (the mind of a G)
I'm out here gettin' my paper (gettin' my paper)
So don't fuck with me (don't fuck with me)
