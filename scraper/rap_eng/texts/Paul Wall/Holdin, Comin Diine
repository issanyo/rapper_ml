[Intro]
Yup
Holdin, comin diine
Poker on board, with the trunk up
Swangin' extra wide
Dripping candy, holdin

[Verse 1]
In the slab game I’m LeBron James
Michael Jordan six slabs bit six rings
Belts and buckles on the back like a fashion statement
LED Cadillac emblem clean ain't it?
Both tires stripe whiter than a foam cup
Mustard strip all gold like King Tut
[?] following got police wanting to take a selfie
I never ride 4 deep my partners say I’m selfish
Chop not slop with a bumper grill
Texas trill riding apple over seals
Kush blow like the wind around mid march
Wheels poking out large, slab breaking hearts
I’m a parking lot heart breaker
Have your asthma pump ready it’s a breath taker
Take your time looking at it tell me how you rank it
Texan Wire Wheel chrome makers top baking and I’m holdin

[Hook]
(Where my cup at, though?)
Holdin, comin diine (Haha hey, for real where my cup at, though?)
Holdin, comin diine
Holdin, comin diine
Holdin, comin diine

[Verse 2]
The picture clean but wait till you see it in person
Fresh tires got titties like a baby nursing
Paint wet trunk wave you would think I’m surfing
When I pull up to the light cameras start emerging
I’m better known as the turning lane head turner
The satellite OG kush burner
Smoking on that murder interior rug Persian
If you ain't ever rode 4s you a slab virgin
Insurance searching car hotter than a pan of bacon
I’ve been known to cause accidents people neck breaking
Driver awareness got all their chairs vibrating
You in a Nissan that’s the reason why you hating
It ain't no debating how I work that wood wheel with ease
Candy paint so thick it might dull your keys
Bottom line I invested over 50 G’s
Not including the title
Bitch I got the title and I’m holdin

[Hook]
(Where my cup at, though?)
Holdin, comin diine (Haha hey, for real where my cup at, though?)
Holdin, comin diine
Holdin, comin diine
Holdin, comin diine
