For the hoes, my nigga, that pussy poppin, that magic city
Got the strong my nigga, then come match that shit with me
Smoking mid my nigga, then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas, and bitches bout that money

[Verse 1 (SLIM THUG):]
Gold all in my rang, gold all in my chain
Bad bitches give me they brains
All my hoes so insane
I stay smokin on them planes
Coastin on them swings
Poking up them lames, I'm so fly I need me some wings
I got the baddest bitches in texas
Brightest diamonds in my necklace
We smoke the best, you smokin' stress
I eat Pappadeaux for breakfast
Every line watching them Texans
We super thrown, I'm thinking Super Bowl
Shit I'm tryina pick which coup to road
The Camaro cold but the Rarri hoe
1 50 on 45, 1 80 on the billway
In the boondocks ridin in my drop
Out where that boy Paul Wall stay
I'm the club king on the club scene
50 knocks fetish a dream
I'm pulling out every week something clean
Leaving with a bitch that you see in your dreams

[Hook:]
For the hoes, my nigga, that pussy poppin, that magic city
Got the strong my nigga, then come match that shit with me
Smoking mid my nigga, then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas, and bitches bout that money

[Verse 2 (PAUL WALL):]
All gold everywhere
Got a few different chains, I keep a spare
New jewels every week I don't play fair
A new slab once a year like a state fair
Talking down catch your fade like short hair
Perforated leather on my chair
It's chick season, quality test is treason
You square as a cube I'm so clear
I'm real, drank sipper
Drop a 4 in the 20 that's a Kobe Bryant
I'm a Texan wide wheel tipper
I put the 'Lac on the streets and you haters got quiet
I'm watching The Rockets play the Clippers
From Texas to Cali like Nolan Ryan
O only drive wearin' slippers
I got a meek girl showing nipples
All I do is pull broads like wisdom teeth without tryin
All I do is cover up my neck and wrist with diamonds
I don't fuck with no boppers so don't tell me who shining
And I don't fuck with no haters, so don't knock a man for grinding

[Hook:]
For the hoes, my nigga, that pussy poppin, that magic city
Got the strong my nigga, then come match that shit with me
Smoking mid my nigga, then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas, and bitches bout that money

[Verse 3 (D-BOSS):]
This one here's for them hustlers
Who don't really, really, really want for nothing
Who keep a bad bitch and keep a couple cars
And with a side hoe know we just fucking
She smoked my blunt then we sexin
She smoked my blunt and we sexin
What started out with us texting
Lead to me getting head at the intersection
D boss I be him, a street cat I represent that
Hit my plug on my travel line
They told me I already sent the pack
Working and it's gone, check out my watch, it cost bout a hund
And I ain't finna break nothing down
But I bet that I stay in my zone
All I know is go get it
She called and told me come get it
I told the bitch that I was on my grind
But later on I'm a get in her kitty
This one here direct
Strip a flow, show naked
Represent for that Houston Texas
Check the watch, no necklace

[Hook:]
For the hoes, my nigga, that pussy poppin, that magic city
Got the strong my nigga, then come match that shit with me
Smoking mid my nigga, then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas, and bitches bout that money
