[Hook – AD]
When I walk down the streets
Got my eyes wide open, got my eyes wide open
Don’t worry about me
Got my eyes wide open, got my eyes wide open
Wide open, got my eyes wide open, got my eyes wide open
Wide open, got my eyes wide open, got my eyes wide open

[Verse 1 – AD]
Ride around the city, got these haters in my rear view
Play dumb, but on my mom I got a clear view
Joke a lot but I’m smarter than I appear to
All bleed the same, I don’t fear you (Nah)
I’m from Compton city nigga, home of the greats
Where niggas run up on you, blow up your wait, hold up
I ain’t got say too much CPT niggas spray it up
If you ain’t bout best be on your way (ok)
Couple of rabbits hating, god told me to keep it patient
Bitches watching my phone, turning off these notifications
Half these niggas faking to make it, this shits so flagrant
Got some game from tetris, on these records I be blazing
Cali full of this Indo, roll up let that shit blow
Big pimping and my brim low, RIP to Pimp though
You niggas quiet I’m outspoken
Go to sleep even with my eyes open
I don’t trust you niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Paul Wall]
Pull up poking with the sun roof smoking
On the four, floating with a chick deep throating
Trunk slightly open, but my eyes wide open
100, never folding, jump out, boy scolding
Breaking boys off is a slab obligation
Paper chasing is my occupation, miss me with that hating
Little creep pacing and that muddy drink tasting
Got a bad ho adjacent but that ho shit is vacant
Trill talk on me, if you’re faking keep skating
Pouting up the activation for the double cup nation
First gate knocking got the whole block shaking
Faking, OG satellite spaceship
Orbit round the corner slow, I hope you got patience
Eyes wide open for the jackets and the Asians
Hard to be discreet on [?] and chrome feets
You know I keep the heat on my lap and underneath the seats
