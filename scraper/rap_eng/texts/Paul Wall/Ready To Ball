[Intro (Archie Lee)]
Mista Masta I got a couple of my partners with me
My nigga Paul Wall
My nigga the Chamillionaire
It's Swishahouse 2000, you niggas know how we do it
I don’t know what's up with these niggas mayne gettin' mad at us
Cuz, a nigga don’t wanna hang out with them and get blowed [?] with them
Nigga my mind on some mo' shit man, I'm try'n'a get paid in the bitch you feel me?

[Archie Lee]
Money over bitches
That's for me to motto
Sippin' [?] straight out the [?]
Guess you can call me a criminal
Shit it's gettin’ critical, hey, ballin’ individual
Meanwhile
Fire up the damn dope
Nigga what you a'int know
Swishahouse through the do’
Draped up in my, brand name apparel
Me and my nigga black, ridin' in the new Camaro
Ridin' high
2000 do or die
If you 'bout your fetti put your rollies in the sky
And who you know flyer than me?
Who you know get you higher than me?
Who you know that’s liver than me?
Who you know roll on chrome like me?
Who you know be in the zone like me?
Pat chrome like me?
Now who you know get you rowdy-rowdy?

You're thinkin' 'bout gettin' blow
Damn [?] my time with you
Shit, I be broke
Would have to endo to smoke
Or no wood wheel to choke
I don't know why these cock suckers steady pagin' me
I'm try'n'a live my life in the lap of luxury
So thanks for the offer but I can't dawg
I a'int fuckin' wit y'all cuz y'all a'int ready to ball

[Hook (Archie Lee)]
They want me to sip drank and just roll with them
But I a'int fuckin' wit y'all cuz y'all a'int ready to ball
They want me to hit the club and pull hoes with them
But I a'int fuckin' wit y'all cuz y'all a'int ready to ball
They want me to fire up some endo with them
Nah I a'int fuckin' wit y'all cuz y'all a'int ready to ball
They want me to grip grain and flip 4's with them
I a'int fuckin' wit y'all cuz y'all a'int ready to ball

[Chamillionaire]
You know I'm a gold grinning young thugga
Hustler representin' for the, gor-illas in the gutter
Sittin' pretty on the butter
[?] on the rubber
See I'm like no other
Girls see me on the block and just st-st-stutter
I'm a lover and a stunner
See I'm in love with my chips
But the, ice on my wrist is a little too cold to kiss
Can't fall in love wit' your miss
Cuz my money be gettin'  jealous
And that's the same reason I can't be out hittin' licks with the fellas
Cuz naw, I a'int wit' it
Although I hate to admit it
But if I go by myself and get it
I won't have to split it
So I be frontin' like I'm busy, every time that you call
Cuz I can't be thuggin' wit' y'all
Niggas a'int 'bout paper at all
I can't be frontin' like I'm broke
Niggas can see I a'int broke
A thousand dollars worth of ice just glistening off of my rope
Cuz you out, smoking your dope
And you're out, puffing your Jane
And you're out, grippin' your grain
Then I'm out, spittin' my game
In a reign
Pimpin' your game
You got to be about your figures
I roam with the realest gorillas
And the realest 20 inch wheelers
I'm not from Pittsburgh niggas
But I roam with them stealers
So hop out a 6 if you wit' us
If not, mind ya own bidness
And show me where the, money at
Chamill gon' be right there

[?]
You got a 500 dollar bill?

[Chamillionaire]
See I'mma be like "yeah"
And you can call me out my name Chamillion really don't care
If I'm changin' my name from Chamillion to the Chamillionaire

[Paul Wall]
Paul Wall the trendsetter
A'int nobody better
A'int no time for lollygagging I'm a cheddar-go-getter
Damion Davis strapped up Beretta
Put a hole in yo' sweater
If you a'int payin' what you playin' [?] surf gets wetter
You deserve that
I'm on my hustle, you heard that?
With gorillas in all black ready to serve that
Got haters on all fours and they kissin' on floors
No remorse of course
Quit yellin' your horse gettin' horsed
Paul Wall kickin' down doors
And I'm bringin' the force
You lil' boys get on your chores on serenity's [?]
When they see me at the awards girls pissin' they drawers
I could catch boppers if while I rode on a skateboard ([?]: hey Paul Wall)
Wearin' Reebok [?] and some [?]
Swishahouse bringin' paint like [?] (?)
While you guards chasin' the broads
And stuntin' they cars
I'mma gets mine and then I'mma go get yours (?)
