[Verse 1: Bun B]
Trill OG, you know I'm all about the kind
BAT, with THC all up on my mind
Gotta get the Benz, Bun, you already know
I'm headed to the place where the good already grow
Coming first thing right to Los Angeles
On a mission for that grade A Canabis
If I make the right move, I could get rich
So in the words of Young Pimp, smoke something, bitch
Like 2pac said, it's elementary
You get the groth spot, then set up the dispensary
Open up the loud pack, and slap you in the face
All legal, baby, we ain't bout to catch a case
Man, I used to slang switches in the alli
Tryna save up, and buy a fresh pare of Calli
Now we just sit back, and watch money tally

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work from California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
First off, long live King Jack
Mack Dre, Pimp C and Big Pat
I learned the game from 40 Water in 99
He told me and Chamillionaire to get on the grind
I hit up Uz, on my plug for the juice
Satalight suply, only blazing on the truth
I'm on that 5, pourin up a 4 with Trae Tha Truth
Chuck a duce, one time with Z-ro in the candy coope
Third coast reppin, only on the west
Scooped up, glewed up, staying blessed
Forever oaks, in the Ghost seein ghosts
Got that 10 with Slim Thug, yeah, boss hoggen
Out in Longbeach with Daz, we pourin up a coffin

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work from California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali
