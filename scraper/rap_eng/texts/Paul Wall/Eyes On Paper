[Sample: 4X]
"Keep your mind on paper, keep your mind on paper"
"Keep your eyes on paper, keep your eyes on paper"

[Z-Ro]
Uh, I was down to my last dime with my stomach touching my back
Instead of my partners helping me, I was what they were laughing at
You can't approach the girl of your dreams in Pro Wings and Wrangler jeans
A white five-oh shirt with the collar, plus no dollars
It's been a long time since I stepped outside, next stopped at my daddy house
Back then Darryll Lewis was McVey Junior in my daddy house
I'm not tripping, I'm actually glad that they turned they backs on me
Fuck family and fuck friends too, it's just me and my strap homie
Yeah I was that nerd nigga yesterday, the day I rapped homie
A pocket full of pencils became a pistol in my lap homie
I was voted most likely to become a teacher
Everybody class is in session, put your ear up to the nearest speaker
Today's lesson is simple, if you don't work you don't eat
And the lowest level of a man is when he is living on the street
Whatever you put in the game, the game gon' give back to ya player
That's why my mind ain't on these bitches, I keep my mind on paper

[Chorus: 2X]
"Keep your mind on paper, keep your mind on paper"
"Keep your eyes on paper, keep your eyes on paper"
I got to keep my head on son
"Keep your mind on paper, keep your mind on paper"
"Keep your eyes on paper, keep your eyes on paper"

[Paul Wall]
I got my mind on that paper mayne, I'm thinking bout them stacks
My motivation is Benzos and Cadillacs
My decoration is candy coats and super boats
My worst nightmare is waking up and being broke
My mind frame is go get it with no excuse
If all that crying don't help me then tell me what's the use?
My hustle schedule is all night and all day
If there's some paper to be made, then I'm on the way
My daily routine is stacking change and hitting licks
I use my wits to go get it when stacking chips
Now haters bumping they lips to try to throw me out
But my eyes on the green like I was playing golf
I'll never ease up mashing until the day I croak
I'll be eighty, selling plain meals to old folks
I keep my mind on bread just like a baker
My eyes on that paper till I meet my maker

[Chorus: 2X]

[Z-Ro]
See I might meet a chick, fuck the shit out her then take the hoe home
When you meet a chick, you fuck and the next day her home is your home
But at my crib, them type of shenanigans just don't go on
Thinking I'm gon' pay to see your pussy, bitch you got me so wrong
I might spend a lil' here, spend a lil' there
Never spend any of it on pussy, I'm a real player
Early birds get the worm, I'm up when the cock crows
I must live in a bakery cause I promise I got dough
This ain't pay rent money, this play with money
When my friends stopped playing with me, I started to play with money
My nigga my ass, ain't near one of y'all my nigga no more
Except for Jimbo, one night he caught me creeping up out of the bio
He knew I was down on my luck so he threw me a bone
Put money in my pocket, rented me a room and then my nigga was gone
Every since then I've been chasing paper like paper murdered one of my people
Having money ain't wrong, the love of it is evil

[Chorus: 2X]
