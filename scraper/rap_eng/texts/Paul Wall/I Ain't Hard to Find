If you're lookin' for me, I ain't hard to find
(Know'm sayin'?)
I'll be right there posted on that 59
(Already)
I got a burner in my lap at all times
(Know'm sayin'?)
And a bag of sticky-icky green limes
(Already)

[Verse 1]
I got that paper in them rubberbands
Stacked up
And I got somethin' hidden in the stash
Wrapped up
If you see purple in my cup
That mean I'm leanin' tough
I got them haters on my back
So I be strapped up
I'm in a league of my own
While them haters throwin' stones
But my mind on cash
I'm in the zone
I'm grippin' wood
And tippin' chrome
I'm well known
My wrist is Rocky like Stalone
Southlea is where I roam
The champ is here
And there is no clone
Off top
I'm well respected on many blocks
So I'm pullin' hunnies and smashin' cocks
Knockin' these broads up out they socks
I'm in the hood like wig shops
Look close, I ain't hard to spot
I'm right there at that gamblin' spot
Stackin' up a fat knot

[Verse 2]
I'm a block burner like Lil Wayne
Revisin' the game like King James
The heads turnin' like Slim Thug chain
I'm bangin' hooks like Sugar Shane
I'm throwed off like Major Payne
Talkin' shit like Clubber Lang
These boys talkin' down on the name
But they all washed up like Eddie Kane
The slab roof like David Blaine
(Why's that?) It disappear like magic
Glock 19, made of plastic
Might stretch you out just like elastic
I stay up on my toes
'Til the day that my casket close
Bankrolls and fine hoes
Fancy cars and starch clothes
Weed cigars and Moet rolls
Pints of Barr and kushy dro
Dime collector outside the club
In candy toy with the trunk exposed
Swishahouse, baby, that's my crew
Roll with us or you'll get ran through
We loved by few, and still true
Let me tell y'all just what it do

[Verse 3]
It's Hustle-town Texas
I do this for the streets
Grindin' with no sleep
Because that paper what I seek
That hatin' need to cease
I'm evadin' the police
And I been hustlin' since Hulk Hogan
Body-slammed the Iron Sheik
My flow is outta sight
But them boys is all hype
They can't see me up on the mic
So they be hatin' me out of spite
Some potent purple Sprite
I done paid my dues
Out hear the strong survive
But the weak end up on Fox news
Sleepless nights with burner in hand
'Cause nowadays them jackers plot
Jealousy turn friends to foes
I'm packin' Glocks around the clock
Stackin' knots and mackin' hoes
Chasin' paper and ridin' vogues
Get that dough what I propose
On 5-9-double-O
