(featuring 50/50 Twin & Lew Hawk)

[Hook]
She wants me to give up the life, of being a playa
And running the streets with my partnas, but in exchange fa'
Plenty of love and the comfort, but I don't blame her
If I give you the world, would you do me a favor
Promise to deal with the life, of a entertainer
I'm grinding 24/7, so I can't save ya
Maybe one day, I'll put that ring on your finger
I can't give you the world, until I get this paper
[Chamillionaire]
Now we arguing and she curses, saying the money's worthless
Arguments turn to fights, and as soon as she throws that first fist
I'm ready to hurt this girl, look how she turned this
Thang sour, when every kiss use to seem like the first kiss
Now do I desert this partnership, or just work this out
When I know damn well, the problems gonna resurface
Forget the less cause first it's money, cause money turned this
Into real estate purchases, and Gucci purses
I ain't no expert kid, but I'll tell ya I learned this
Entertainment game can, come with permanent curses
Either she telling you, you the father of her kids
Or slamming the do' in your face, like it's none of your biz'
Living this earth is, harder than red dirt is
Plus society gon judge you, on what you worth is
I'm trying to make sure, the finest food touches your lips
So I'm grinding daily for both of us, we deserve this

[Hook]
[50/50 Twin]
I put a ring on your finger, when the time is right
Love can't pay the bills, so I grind all night
Don't come to the block tripping, trying to find a fight
God don't see us through, we gave Christ our life
See you gave me the world, when you gave me a girl
Peep this we made a heaven, so that's heaven on earth
I'm trying to make sure y'all set, before I'm buried in dirt
We done cheated on eachother, causing worry and hurt
But despite of your past, despite of my past
Everybody make mistakes, we both learned from that
You Bonnie I'm Clyde, let's earn this cash
For you if I was in the gang, I would burn the flag
We knew each other for a week, you put up your cards
And brought me out of jail for three week, filled cigars
I was like save your money, but you said hell naw
I explained myself now, must go stack mail girl what

[Hook]
[Paul Wall]
I remember the first time, that I saw your face
I got shivers when I looked in your eyes, but times change
And even though, you'll never be replaced
I let love loose and got wise, but I ain't tripping baby
I use to feel like, we was made for each other
But you was taking up, too much of my time
Cause how can I support a family, if I'ma make you a mother
When I ain't got time to go grind, so get your mind right
I'm feeling like, it wasn't timed right
Cause we started getting involved, right after I hit the limelight
It started seeming like, you want me to choose
But I'm right in the middle of a game, that I can't lose
I had to put our love affair on hold, so I hope you don't think
I'm trying to do you wrong, and leave you out in the cold girl
Me and you, was like best friends
Maybe later on in the future, we'll decide how the story ends girl

[Hook]
[Lew Hawk]
I'm trying my best to give you the world, but you just don't feel it
I'm trying to keep your wrist iced, and your waist Gucci fitted
And I know your friends jealous, when we flossing the scene
Cause you be Prada head to toe, while I'm starched and clean
And a love like this, it's gon cost a little
All I ask in return, is you cool off a little
While I'm stacking this cheddar, making a life for us
Is it really hard to see, I'm doing what's right for us
I'm thinking bubble baths shorty, while we sip champagne
Reminiscing good times, while we play kiss games
And this flow is from the heart, ain't no need for games
And you've been down from the start, and I don't want that to change
Speaking of change baby girl, please remember this
If your ass block my change, then your ass get dismissed
This bout walking papers, no remorse at all
Psyche I love you girl, I just want's to ball
