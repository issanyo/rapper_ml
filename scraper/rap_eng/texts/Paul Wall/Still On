[Chorus:]
They're Trying To Block My Shine
Doing Whatever They Can To Stop My Grind (Ey Ey)
They Hate Seeing My Stacks Getting Tall
And Even Though They Plotting On My Downfall
I'm Still On (Still On)
I'm Still On (Still On)
Go Ahead Tell Them Haters I'm Still On (Still On)
I'm Still On (Still On)

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I'm Tired Of Being Broke Something Gotta Shape
I'm a Get Off My Ass And Go Get That Cake
All Hours Of The Day The Hustling Never Stop
So From Sun Up To Sun Down I'm Punching The Clock
While Them Other Boys Sleeping I'm On The Grind Creeping
When The Daylight Dawns In All Hours Of The Evening
They Peeping Through My Window Tryin To See What I Got
? Hustling On The Side Partna I Think Not
Tryin To Plot On A Jack Move The Haters Is Watching
And The Law Is Looking At Me Cause The Fours I'm Coppin
But Ain't No Way I'm Stopping I Done Worked Too Hard
And I Ain't Paid Too Far So There's No Hoes Barred
My Back Against The Wall And My Hand On The Gun
But I Pray To God For Peace So Thou Should Overcome
When Victory Is Won And My Crib On The Lake
I Ain't Never Gonna Stop Grinding After Getting That Cake

[Chorus:]
They're Trying To Block My Shine
Doing Whatever They Can To Stop My Grind (Ey Ey)
They Hate Seeing My Stacks Getting Tall
And Even Though They Plotting On My Downfall
I'm Still On (Still On)
I'm Still On (Still On)
Go Ahead Tell Them Haters I'm Still On (Still On)
I'm Still On (Still On)

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
They Talking Down On A Playa Cause I'm Breaking Bread
But Would You Rather I Be On My Ass Broke Instead
Everybody Jealous Of You When You're Paperspread
But They Quick To Wear Your T-Shirt When You're Dead
It's Just In Me To Be A Go Getta
Tied At Hard Times Partna I Wanna Live Better
You Know Ain't Nothing Coming To A Youngn Sleep Up Your Dreams
So I'm Swallowing Them No Dose And Leading my Team I Want That Green
And Ain't Nobody Gonna Stand In My Way
I Give A Fuck What A Hater Say
Let Them Other Boys Play

Go And Get Everyday From Home Staying To The Tray
If I Work Hard Then Good Times Are On the Way
I Know Alot Of These Haters Just Want Me Out The way
But Not Today The Champ Here To Stay
I Live The Fast Life Daily That Paper What I Need
While Them Haters Falling Off The Lazyiness And Greed
But I'm Still On Baby

[Chorus:]
They're Trying To Block My Shine
Doing Whatever They Can To Stop My Grind (Ey Ey)
They Hate Seeing My Stacks Getting Tall
And Even Though They Plotting On My Downfall
I'm Still On (Still On)
I'm Still On (Still On)
Go Ahead Tell Them Haters I'm Still On (Still On)
I'm Still On (Still On)

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
While Other People In Bed Trying To Count Sheep
I'm Clocking Dollars Counting Paper Out There In The Street
The People Hating They Judge Me Cause I'm Ballin Hard
I Guess They Rather I Out House To House Mowing Yard
You See The Cadillac And Benz Parked Out In The Yard
When I Pull Out In That Bentley Coupe I Fool All Their Cards
I Fool Broads For Years I'm Talking Down Pieces
And Now I'm Pulling My Hand Away From All The Reaches
Focused All My Thoughts On Paper Stacking
I'm With T-Farris Everyday And We Ainy Never Slacking
I'm Out Here Racking These Meal Tickets I ain't quitting
So Get To Packing If You're On Your Ass Bullshitting
They Steady Knock Me For Making Money Ain't Counting Change
But I Ain't Changed When I Was Broke I Acted The Same
And Now They're Jealous But Fuck 'Em Tell 'Em Kiss My Ass
Sun Up To Sun Down I'm Getting That Cash
Tell 'Em I'm Still On

[Chorus/Outro: Paul Wall Talking In Background]
They're Trying To Block My Shine
Doing Whatever They Can To Stop My Grind (Ey Ey)
They Hate Seeing My Stacks Getting Tall
And Even Though They Plotting On My Downfall
I'm Still On (Still On)
I'm Still On (Still On)
Go Ahead Tell Them Haters I'm Still On (Still On)
I'm Still On (Still On)
