[Slim Thug]
I'm hard to hate but I'm easy to love mayne. Huh, Thugga
Ya'll know how I do
Huh, it's over, huh

[Slim Thug: Verse 1]
Huh, I'm stuntin' pullin' out the foreign
All them boppers love it
We can fuck around
We just can't fuck around in public
Let me switch the subject
I'm shinin' on Westheimer
At the Gallo tryin' to pick out which chick is finer
I wear designer
Talk down I find ya'
It's Thugga mothafucka, in case I need to remind ya'
Let me go and wreck, so I can go and bring the techs back
Wake up in the mornin' and I'm headin' where them chicks at
Grindin'
That's why you see so many diamonds
Shinin'
Like a light bulb I'm blindin'
Them boys, watch me make them put away they toys
Trunk making noise
Haters better avoid Thugga (Thugga)

[Paul Wall: Verse 2]
Shout out
To any body that's getting money
Period
When it comes to hustles
Best believe I got a [?]
My footwear is so tight
Of exotic material
One of the persons to sip' drank
It was a miracle
[?]
Watch that drank got me irritable
When the haters hate it just expose who's been inferior
I don't know what you smokin'
But I swear my shit superior
When I flash my wrist
The passersby go hysterical
And when I work that wheel and pop my trunk
It is historical
And when her ass get fake
I give a fuck that is rhetorical
Switch up cars like audible
My changing cars are assort-able
My slab come with an arsenal
But my grill is not affordable
Hold up (Hold up)

[Chamillionaire: Verse 3]
(Here lizard lizard lizard)
Real recognize real, you can tell
Thugga just hit me on the cell
If you can sell water to a women with a water hose
And I can sell cameras to a jail
Plenty ice is sittin' on my chest
I should bake a cake, might as well
Take the money
Then you put the money on the money counter
Put the money counter on scale
If time is money then I need it on the dot
Time is money then I'm always on the clock
Got a 40 caliber for the plot
150 thousand on my parkin' spot
Not the type of rapper that bargain shop
Before you realize it I'd barged your shop
Ridin' in car with a revolver top
Ironically the weapon got revolver shots
The platinum rapper that's standing here
The only that can confer
Got some plex, then don't say my name
Like Candy Man and watch him appear
Grab a deal, candy clear
Candy clearer than a chandelier
I compare myself to the best
So I should probably go grab a mirror
Like Sammy Sosa, do certain pitchers
I'll probably hit, so keep secure your mistress
I prefer to keep girl suspicious
Dig a hole it's feed first for snitches
Known for fittin' certain inches
Candy coat it then swervin' digits
Gettin' paid, so I got it made
Get's paid too much to touch dirty dishes
Strippers flock's in me in the club
Talkin' like they wanna learn the bidness
Thinkin' I should go buy a gym
Make 'em work for me
And call it "Twerk For Fitness"
Diamonds shinin in 3rd dimensions
Bosses life like we had earnt the riches
She sipping' the syrup, when you look at my shirt
You can see where your girl left purple kisses
Haha
