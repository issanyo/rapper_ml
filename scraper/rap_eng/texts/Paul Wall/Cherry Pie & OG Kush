[Hook: Baby Bash]
Out here ridin' smokin' good
That Cherry Pie and OG Kush
Out here ridin' smokin' good (smokin' that good mane)
That Cherry Pie and OG Kush (that OG Kush mane)

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Rolled up a whole leaf in the nano
Bash, Cherry Pie on some OG presidential
Rollin' slow through a school zone or your residential
Or ridin' on the freeway bumpin' instrumentals
And you can keep that hatin' bullshit to your person
Talkin' down on a real player, bitch it ain't worth it
So keep up the bad work, keep lookin' for some dirt
And everytime I see your ass in traffic I'mma smerk
Cause you are what you smoke, and I can tell you smoke bama baby
So I'mma keep on pushin' and keep jammin' baby
So spark it up in the ride, leanin' sideways
You know it's all fire, you know it's bombay

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Rollin' up some Cherry Pie fresh from the bay
Cigarillos split in half but a fly fil√©
Eyes red as a tomato from the Cali hay
Mind blown like the top on a six tray
Music loud, crawlin' as the crowd wow's
Everywhere I go I'm followed by a kush cloud
And everytime I smoke with Bash I forget my name
Scoop DeVille just came through with the strongest strain
High as NASA, feelin' fantastic
Ridin' in the classic with a chick with nice asses
Paper no plastic, vapor no caskets
Prayin' that the laws keep drivin' on past us
When we smokin' out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scoop DeVille]
I just smoked a hundred blunts to this
What makes you think you was gon' keep up to this
I'm hotboxing and laughing, gettin' at your bitch
I promise you ain't never had no smoke like this
Relax your mind and then climb on my mothership
Cause we be on some other shit, I'm puffin' big
I'm rollin' up in public cause I love it
Blow it down like fuck it, all my homies smoke somethin' potent
Ganja now this gigg on my level
Smell the [?] as I pop the top
I'm feelin' like superman and I never want it to stop
Cause we on tonight, we out here gettin' money
So it's only right that we stay super high, who am I?
Scoopy

[Hook]
