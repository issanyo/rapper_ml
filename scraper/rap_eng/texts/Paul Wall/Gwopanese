[Hook: Paul Wall]
I only talk money bro' Gwopanese
If you talking 'bout some money come and talk to me
If you talking 'bout some bread better keep it G
So if you talking down please don't talk to me

I only talk money x6
If you ain't talkin bout money don't talk to me

It's on my mind like my Louis frames (my Louis frames)
I swear to god its all I think about (I think about)
I love my money like I love my hood (I love it)
If you talkin down then fuck what you talkin 'bout
Back to work, sleep is for the broke and lonely
Focused mind make the money double like James Loney
Hard grind make the cash triple like Carl Crawford
All profit paper chasin is the topic (topic)
I leave that gossip to them bitches
Johnny told me "your chain is filled up with crystals"
If you talkin 'bout me don't forget to mention my pistols
I'm down to my last ace, I got drink withdrawl issues
I'm holdin tissues, save that cryin for them losers
I've never seen a champion without scrapes, bumps and bruises
I swear i'm up so early ill be waking up the roosters
Out here gettin too it and workin for it and talkin 'bout that money

I only talk money bro' Gwopanese
If you talking 'bout some money come and talk to me
If you talking 'bout some bread better keep it G
So if you talking down please don't talk to me

I only talk money x6
If you ain't talkin bout money don't talk to me
