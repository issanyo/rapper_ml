[Intro: Chamillionaire]
I'm a hustler, ladies man, of course a player
So say ya prayers when I park the gator
Your neighbors suspect some suspicious behavior
And ready to call ya captain saver to come save ya
But you're not in danger cause I'm not a stranger
I just came for, one night to entertain ya
Came to your crib I know it'd be a shame to
Waste this evening trying to be a complainer, let me in

[Hook: Heather Nicole]
If you would've known 20 inches of chrome
Was really turning me on, then we wouldn't be friends
Cause we'd be alone somewhere getting it on
And I don't want to be wrong, then we'd be cheating
Never let you know how I feel on the phone
Cause I don't want this to go off the deep end
So I'm afraid I can let you know, that I want to get sexual

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire (Girl)]
Watch me, I go pull up outside, your crib in my ride
Tell my girl that I'll be at the studio, lie
No one will know I've even arrived
I'ma show up at 4 and be out the door before 5
Let me get inside (You got a nasty mouth)
I wasn't talking about ya draws, I'm talking bout ya house
Cause that's the first step after I get in the door
You already know how the rest of the script go
Me and you on the floor, your knickers gone I think we
Can get kinky, drink the liquor lengthy
Sips of Henny and soda got you so, uh
Far from sober, I'm like, "Man, hol' up"
You're fine but I kinda feel ya tryna
Turn me on showing designer panty liners
If I ever get the time or day then I'm a
Make you come like the space after the comma, for real

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
If I woulda known 20 inches of chrome
Was really turning you on, then we wouldn't be friends
Cause we'd be alone somewhere getting it on
And I know that would be be wrong, then you would be cheating
Never let you know how I feel on the phone
We both got lovers at home but we ain't gotta tell them
Don't be afraid baby let me know, if you want to get sexual

[Bridge: Chamillionaire & (Heather Nicole)]
(No, oh) What you mean no?
I give you what you fiend for, you gotta just let me know
(No, oh) Hand me the keys to your sexual needs
I'll drive slow, I won't speed
(No, oh) Is this your last answer?
This is your last chance to let Chamillion' romance ya
Don't be afraid baby let me know
If you want to get sexual

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Catch game, I'm pitching to ya, come up out of the dark
Step up to the plate, swing, and hit you out of the park
Could you meet me out at the park? Let me seduce you
I'm kinda like Chris Tucker, tryna get me some moo shu
Let me introduce you to Pablo's Peter
Take ya shirt off, and, "Ay ay ay!" It's unbelievable
Why ya always actin like I ain't bout nuthin?
Girl, you bluffing, you a turkey, let me stick you my stuffing
Wake you up out of ya dreams, it ain't what it seem
Let me get inside ya coffee and squirt my cream
You understand? Hear me out, peep my slang
Quit acting like you aren't attracted by the way that I swang
I know the 20 inch thangs keep catching ya eye
Don't let me catch you in a lie, let me caress ya thigh
Let me play the itsy-bitsy spider under ya skirt
I wanna flirt but you don't wanna be hurt, you think I'm a jerk
