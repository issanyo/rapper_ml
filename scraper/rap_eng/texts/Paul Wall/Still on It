(Intro)
There can be only one
Swisha house
Ashanti
Pall Wall what it do
Murder Inc

(Paul Wall)
It's the Houston hard hitter out the seven one three
It's the people's champ, Paul Wall yeah that's me
Come take a ride with the player out the Lone Star State
I'm just a hustler on the grind known for getting that cake
I came up from the bottom now I reside on the top
I used to run away from cops but now its Benzes I cop
I used to pump stuff on the block like Yao Ming on the paint
But now I pimp the parking lot drivin slow and sippin drink
With Ashanti on my side as I glide like Clyde
Ain't nothin less than with twenty-fours on my side
It's just something about the way I tip fours and grip grain
And got the boppers on the sideline going insane
I got them on it, my macking game is out of control
But I don't know if it's my looks or my big bank roll
I'm tweny-four years old with a mouth all gold
My game's cold and the story's been told, it's Paul Wall baby

(Ashanti)
See I dunno why (why) I'm feeling just the way I do (do)
It's been a long time (time), I thought that I was over you
But now you coming around again, I be remembering what you said
I just can't take it, and I don't wanna go back (oh no)

(Hook - Ashanti)
What is a girl to do if she still on it? (Yes)
And she done been there before with you, and now she don't want it (Yes)
It's been time and time again, I just wish this thing would end, tell me
What is a girl to do if she still on it?

(Ashanti)
Whenever we talked (talked), it feels like we had something strong (strong)
And knowing it's wrong (wrong), we tried to do this thing before
But when you coming real close to me, bringing back all the memories
I just can't fake it (fake it), but I don't wanna go back (Oh no)

(Hook)

(Method Man)
Ah, yea
Auntie Ashanti is a problem, the track here's a problem
The best thing rocking since that Cotton came to Harlem
Meth darling, I'm like that Hershey with the almond
And I don't beg for nothing but your pardon
They start and I finshed, my animals is starving for dentist
Straight up menace, y'all don't get involved in my business
Look eyewitness, spotted like a blemish all gimmicks
I'm 5950 authentic
Tilted with that NY on it, there's money to be made and I want it
See my palm been itching for the longest
But scratch that paper like NASDAQ we laugh at like
Roll the dice, get the cash back, I'm nice
Plus I got the juice so I go well wit ice
Been drug tested three times failed it twice
Ashanti you doing it big, don't hurt 'em auntie
Matter fact you killing 'em girl, you murder mami
Yea, yea

[Hook]
