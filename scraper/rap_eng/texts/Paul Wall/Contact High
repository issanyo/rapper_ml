[Intro]
Nigga all my sessions cloudy (reeezy, reeezy)
??, Hey yo, he don't smoke but he feelin' it, huh
You already knew that was gonna' happen, man (fuckin' with me)
(Nothin' but the best!)

[Hook]
You gonna' catch a contact high
All my niggas smoke is potent, fuckin' with us you might just
Catch a contact high
Windows up, hot boxin' in my ride come catch a
Contact high
You ain't even gotta' hit it, you can watch me hit it
Catch a contact high
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: Demrick]
She don't like to smoke, but she can come and kick it
It's so cloudy lookin' like we burning down a building (light one up)
Don't get caught up in your feelings
Me I'm getting money smokin, ridin', chillin'  (light one up)
Mind on a million, like a millionaire
Smoke in the air, yeah my shows is cloudy everywhere  (light one up)
For the road, this the life that we chose
Spending nights, running Nikes to the souls
And too much hype just ain't right for the soul
That's why I'm spending life high as kites could go
So light one up and come and burn it with the homies
You my broadie, you know anywhere I go it's gon' be smokey
And even if you don't smoke, you gon' catch a buzz
It's all love, got you feeling like you really want
And if you Wiz, I ain't trippin, you know I ain't judge
And baby want to kick it with me just because

[Hook]
You gonna' catch a contact high
All my niggas smoke is potent, fuckin' with us you might just
Catch a contact high
Windows up, hot boxin' in my ride come catch a
Contact high
You ain't even gotta' hit it, you can watch me hit it
Catch a contact high
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, all these bad bitches like to sit in on our sessions (Woah)
They just like to be around [?] leverage
Picking money up for the weed, taking money off for the debit (True)
Make it bad from this Dizzy OG we been selling
So we package it then we vacuum seal it, that's evacuing
She don't smoke but she trust me cause I got that practice in
But I could tell by the way she acting that it's happening
Contacting 'em but I'm loving the way this hash taste
I'm on some fuck the attitudes and pass me the ashtray
Look, yeah you high but only halfway
Look, I escaped from life, you playing with it
I'm one of the realest that's smoking the fire, you know you can't prevent it
Now can you dig it
You talking about it but do you live it
This is real rap over them gimmicks
Only smoking the best weed, you could probably smell it if you hear this
I been generous lately, making these general decisions
Look all I know is that we locked in so when you drop in...

[Hook]
You gonna' catch a contact high
All my niggas smoke is potent, fuckin' with us you might just
Catch a contact high
Windows up, hot boxin' in my ride come catch a
Contact high
You ain't even gotta' hit it, you can watch me hit it
Catch a contact high

[Pre-Verse: Paul Wall]
That's right, you gon' catch a contact high when you hop in my ride
You ride with me, you gon' catch that contact high
Hey, hey, hey, Paul Wall

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
She say she don't smoke, I'm 'bout to change that
Satelite slugger fatter than a ball bat
Back to back Backwoods, baby it's all good
You know how we do it, it's already understood
Roll it up and light it up and pass it here
OG top tier higher than a Lear
Smoke cloud thicker than a fog damn near
Peer pressure kicking in, not to worry my dear
I get you lifted like a Lyft, Uber, or a cab
Have your mind, body, and your soul feeling fab
Elevate your mind, brain, gon' and take a dab
Slab god taking rips off a seven gram slab
I got them Swishers rolled cause I got them RAW cones
All we smoke is weed, no spice, Meth or stones
But when it come to blazing up, baby we all grown
I get the whole car high even if I smoke alone, baby

[Hook]
You gonna' catch a contact high
All my niggas smoke is potent, fuckin' with us you might just
Catch a contact high
Windows up, hot boxin' in my ride come catch a
Contact high
You ain't even gotta' hit it, you can watch me hit it
Catch a contact high
