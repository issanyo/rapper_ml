[Verse 1:]
Long live the trill, and death to all the fake
The last of a dying breed how much can I take
If I die tomorrow who gon' show up to my wake
And lie to my gal tell her that I owe them all my cake
My yard full of snakes, it's time to move around
Or maybe I should pull out that mower chop em down
I knew it when I pulled out that Bentley in the town
I was looking for congrats all I got was mad frowns
I stayed up in that line til I finally got my turn
I hustled and prayed that the tables would turn
I worked for what I got, every penny I done earned
See I shared my hard times but I guess they not concerned
I hustled and I grinded so it struck me as a problem
They used to be my partners jealous turned them into gollum
I guess I was naive to the lessons of the fallen
They don't like it when you're shining boys hate it when you ballin

[Chorus:]
You know they hate to see you ballin, they rather you was broker than a joke
See I made it from the bottom but they rather I was hanging from a rope
I show alot of love and them favor weigh more than I can count
But the first time you say no all the shit you said before don't count

[Verse 2:]
I put on for my crew, that was my objective
I never show hate showing love was more effective
Strangers think I owe them even though were not connected
They looking for my flaws searching for em like detectives
Jealousy and envy is something I expected
But friends turning into me is something I neglected
I can't please everybody that's what I dissected
How can I put on for Texas if I never leave Texas
My resume is long not to say quite impressive
I could've been incarcerated freedom is a blessing
These weak-minded fool get egged on like some breakfast
But why would God bless you, you're out there living reckless
Why these cowards threatened by another mans successes
They smile in your face but when you leave they get aggressive
Be honest with yourself they're ain't no need to embellish
You can look them in the eye and in they heart they just jealous

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I've learned a lot of game from the players that I've known
And I've never understood how these haters still on
I show them all love but they wanna do me wrong
I try to show them game but they think they all grown
I've made a few mistakes opportunities I've blown
But I've asked for forgiveness for my sins I haved tolled
I've flown around the world but there's no place like home
Til you're home full of strangers and your neighbors all gone
Unity these days is a virtue unknown
There's room at the top but they rather be alone
Somehow these boys got it twisted like a cone
They think they know it all they'll learn it on their own
I'm right here in my zone somewhere far away from them clones
By myself all day posted up you already know
Boys wishin that I was broker than the touch screen on their phone
I gotta go out there and get it I can't sit at home and get stoned
I'm gone

[Chorus]
