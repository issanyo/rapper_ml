[Hook]
Please point me to the money
They call me the Po Up Poet
Please point me to the money

[Verse 1]
If it ain't muddy don't po' it
The call me the Po Up Poet
Just made a ticket time to blow it
I'm getting blowed off that Fillmore
Straight out the Bay I got that real smoke
I got  a connect that's somebody you don't know
Big Moe got me moving real slow
I got the Snoop Dogg rolled up
They better bury me with a cold cup
I got the Screw Juice on deck
If it ain't purple partner hold up

[Hook]
Please point me to the money
They call me the Po Up Poet
Please point me to the money

[Verse 2]
They call me Mr. Muddy
Don't call me with no fuck shit
Unless you're trying to come and fuck me
But fuck that hatin'
Where the weed at
My work uniform is all black
I'm getting money so my haters back
I got that Texas T on tap
They tappin' phones better talking cold
Cold red homie slow yo' row
So I'm rollin' now zonin' bro
Slowly leanin' trying to cure my cold

[Hook]
Please point me to the money
They call me the Po Up Poet
Please point me to the money
