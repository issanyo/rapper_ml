[Intro: Baby Bash]
Lamborghi' and lemon tree, baby that's our destiny
When you smokin' next to me that cookie gets the best of me

[Hook: Fingazz]
Smokin' on that finest, smokin' on that finest
That California finest, that California finest
Smokin' on that finest, smokin' on that finest
That California finest, that California finest

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I'm smokin' the finest trees that money can buy
OG Kush top shelf, satellite supply
You say that you smoke the best but that's a lie
My OG told me that if you ain't coughin then you ain't high
Roll up the satellite, can you pass me a light?
12 grams in a cone, 14 rolled it tight
Half a poud every night, edible, take a bite
Maybe I should take a light, smoke a pound of spike
Vanilla cream in the sprite, three lines, do it right
No cups take the light, a big blunt before I spark
Waxnate on the wood, I roll it like I work the bar
High grade, A+, we don't smoke no weak shit
Got the Cali blunt and the Texas cup
My weed grade and my mud be the finest

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Baeza]
Yeah we be sippin' playa, then you rollin' up
Yeah we gettin' high, we stoned as fuck
And these model bitches wanna roll with us
I got a hunned on a [?]
But the tatted boys they don't smoke like us
Yeah we gettin' blown and we throwed as fuck
Get your lighter out if you going up
I'm with Paul Wall and Bash pourin' up
I got a pound of that purp in the deck
You so gone like I'm catchin' a cab
Losin' my brain, man I'm gone off the dabs
Blowin' that strong, we call it the gas
Hittin' it fast, sippin' it slow
Eyes sittin' low, I'm gettin' the dough
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
I'm gettin' the swisha and roll up some more

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Yeah that weed porn, Insta Weed
Scrollin' down my timeline
Cause I blow these sticks with the badest chicks
And I'm always up in Hightimes
I'm at Hempcon, champion, blowin' on these moon rocks
I roll two chops above 2Pac, and I never smoke that [?]
Lamborghi' and lemon tree, baby that's our destiny
When you smokin' next to me that cookie gets the best of me
Lamborghi' and lemon tree, baby that's our destiny
When you smokin' next to me that cookie gets the best of me

[Hook]

[Outro]
You knamtambout? I'm a OG triple OG, can't tell me shit, you knamtambout?
Roll that Fanta up, roll that AU, roll that gold leaf up mayne
We ain't rollin' out the G-pack, we rollin' out the turkey bag, you knamsayen?
Roll up that satellite slugga in that AU leaf, that's how we get down mayne
Can't tell me shit, legalize it
