[intro]
Rest In Peace
To my real first true love
Can't say ya name, cause I don't wanna hurt no feelings
And never gone forget ya

[Verse 1]
They say you gone and you ain't coming back
I can't believe it damn I miss that act
At first time they said you were leaving but it was a rumor
Maybe that was a sign I should have quit you sooner
Barely departed, you left me lonely broken hearted
And nah this was because of beaver, please don't get me started
They say the rappers glamourize it true I can't deny it
Dr. supplied but Dee Jay Screw had me want to try it
I'd never known how much I loved you to you were through
I never knew how much I loved till you cost me two
Hunder for a line now I'm losing my mind too
You left and never said goodbye that's not what friends do
