[Hook: Paul Wall]
I'm poured up, I'm gone
Countin' up this money on my iPhone
I'm screwed up, I'm throwed
That Girl Scout Cookie got my mind blown
My mind blown, my mind blown
That Girl Scout Cookie got my mind blown
My mind blown, my mind blown
I'm double cup, styrofoam

[Verse 1: Lucky Luciano]
Cookie got my mind blown, sippin' out my styrofoam
Money on my iPhone, it's [?]
In a Lamborghini with a bag of weed
It's tax season, I'm stackin' green
I rob the plug, he can't believe me
[?]
I'm tellin' you I'm a player, felonies I don't care
Laws kicked the door and all they found was resedule on the scale
Rollin' up that cookie, sippin' Actavis lean
20 guage'll make your chest look like hamburger meat
Pimp the blood out the bitch and have her worshippin' me
Met her out of town when I was out on tour with T
Even with your shades on you can't ignore my ring
Paul Wall bring the hood while I pour this lean

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dat Boi T]
I'm on these cookies and Codeine, screwed up like M-o-e
My mind blown, I'm known to act a fool, yeah they know T
I pull, swangin' with the trunk in the sky
Orangutangin' Mary Jane with [?] cause I'm high
Ay, I smoke with them and I smoke with Bash
Might smoke my dro with a little hash
How much drank you got? We want it all
Bring all the seals, we got the cash
[?], we smokin' like Hendricks
That kill for, that fizz, that high, that eerie
I'm smellin' like [?], make bangs off my iPhone
They callin' for that esse that be wreckin' them microphones
Got two cups like Paul Wall, fed up with that Texas
[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Every morning, every evening I continue beasting
I continue feasting on these slaps that I'm releasing
I'm continue cookie chiefing, smokin' with the highest
Willie Nelson status, nigga we smokin' outrighteous
And it's nothin' less than OG, nothin' less than Berry
Some of y'all favorite rappers in this game is hella scary
I can tell you this I betcha mane, my ribs ain't never showing
I'm eating like gorillas while kin folks steady pouring
Since your baby mama hoeing, she brought back every dime
Playa made mexicans, yeah it's going down

[Hook]
