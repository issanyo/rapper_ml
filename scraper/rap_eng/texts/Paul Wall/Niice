[Intro: Quavo]
Money comin' in
Money comin' in
Money comin' in
Ohh

[Verse 1: Berner]
I love this shit
Hella drugs and shit (hella shit)
That pussy so tight, made the rubber rip (damn)
Real D-boy, I got a dub to flip
And the coke so clean, I don't cut the shit (it's pure)
I'm young, fuck your life
I got a hundred lights (hunnit lights)
I got a dirty ass bottle and a cup of ice
When it's dry in the city, then I up the price
Why you got a gun on you if you tuck your ice? (pussy)
I took all fifty, but one was light
When you ridin' like this then you run the lights
I'm in the H-Town, I miss Mr. Niice
The good die young, you better live your life
Now I'm back in the city where the shit don't stop (it' don't stop)
I'mma blow the house up, 'til my shit get popped (popped)
My stomach get to hurtin' when the shit get lost
We do the touchdown dance when we get it across (hello)
Two girls in my S-Class (yeah)
Twenty pack in the black bag (uh huh)
Hundred grand in my backpack
Yeah, we get real trap money, fuck a rap check
Dog, I don't ever wanna be broke again (damn right)
I take two big puffs and I hold it in
I'm on the Golden Gate Bridge on my way to Marin
I been in the game, I just pray that I win
It's young Berner

[Chorus: Quavo & Berner]
(Money comin' in)
Ridin' round with the burner
I'm with Berner (aye)
Ridin' round with the bags on me
'Bout to serve 'em (serve)
Got all these blue Benjamins
Yeah, I earn 'em (cash)
Yeah, I earn 'em (cash, racks)
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
(Serve, cash, racks)
(Serve, cash, racks)

That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Money on my mind like a pair of shades
Grind all week, I ain't slept for days (days)
Paper routes, I know many ways
I got plenty traffic, no need for waze (waze)
Stay prayed, get paid, hustler made (made)
My money too dirty, I need a maid
Broke boys talk down, throwin' shade
But real hustlers are never phased (phased)
High grade twist up like a braid
My money keep comin' like porn star (pornstar)
Tight grip, mine sharp as a blade
I got all the game like a sports bar (sports bra)
For the money I go real far
I gotta get it today, I'm not promised tomorrow
Look for it, I don't beg or borrow (borrow)
I'm worried about mine, homie, not about yours
Wake and bake and get straight to the cake (cake)
Never talk down on the next man (next man)
Never ever do it for the Gram
Nah, stackin' up bread is the game plan (game plan)
Wrist light up like an ambulance
Satellite plant got my eyes on slant
28k stashed in my pants
And I keep my mind on bands, baby

[Chorus: Quavo & Berner]
(Yeah, yeah)
(No, no, no)

Ridin' round with the bags on me
'Bout to serve 'em (serve)
Got all these blue Benjamins
Yeah, I earn 'em (cash)
Yeah, I earn 'em (cash, racks)
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
(Serve, cash, racks)
(Serve, cash, racks)
(Money comin' in)
(Serve, serve, cash, racks)
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'

Money keep comin' in (cash)
Put it in mattress (the matress)
Nutted and piped up (pipe up)
Fuckin' on actress' (some actress)
I'm the new bachelor (woah)
Yeah, that's how we actin' now (we actin')
She want some Cookie, Lean and Molly
Now that bitch passin' out (she passin')
I got that flame with me (flame)
Like I stay in the dragon house (whoosh)
'Member the bando (bando)
Trappin' that gas out the boarded house (gas)

Beat the pot, Ronda Rousey (beat it)
Feel like I'm on the mountain
