Gotta get it... [x3]
I gotta get it
Girl you gotta grind
I'mma put it down, gotta get mine
But you gotta get it, girl you gotta grind
I'mma put it down, gotta get mine
Gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine
I'mma put it down, gotta get mine
Gotta, gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine
I'mma put it down, I gotta get mine

[Verse 1]
I'm on the road to success, I strive to be the best
I never settle for less, if I'm broke I can't rest
A hustler in the flesh, and I'm smokin on the best
Cause I deal with lots of stress, out here in this paper quest
I'm makin progress, so I'm blessed, oh yes
And I'mma get it to my last dying breath, then its in peace I rest
I'm working with that bread like a chef when he cook
Now I'm back to flippin paper like I'm reading a book
Staying real with your partners that's a real good look
But when your cash stash low all your boys get shook
I been searching for that paper like its Natalie Holloway
8 days a week, plus I grind on holidays
There ain't no excuse for these boys to be broke
I know some hustlers in wheelchairs, we get it til we croak
From south pole, to south Post Oak, I gotta stack them C notes
So listen up close
Say I gotta get it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I gotta get them dollar signs, all of every kind
Partner, I need mine; even them nickels and them dimes
I'm out on the grind, stingin every lick I find
Go & get it myself, there ain't no time to stand in line
I never fall behind, and yeah I'm full of that purple slime
But I ain't dead yet, I'm just fine
I'm still in my prime, so I pack at least a nine
Cause these haters trying to block my shine like mini blinds
(I gotta get it)
Long as opportunity knock, I'mma get that guac
And give it all that I got until my coffin drop
The sun rise, I'm the first hustler on the block
And when the sun set, I'm still out here on the clock
I'm trying to hustle for them tickets, like a traffic cop
I gotta hustle and get it partner, I never stop
I take that paper real serious, like Dwight Schrute
Stacking up loot all around the 610 Loop

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I know the world in a recession, but I'm still progressin
Take heed to my confession, never fall to oppression
I learn from life's lesson, if you keep on pressin
You'll eventually end up on top like salad dressin
I'm never second guessin, I abide by faith
And however long the race, gotta maintain pace
When the haters fall to waste and my God grant grace
No matter what odds I face, I'mma be in first place
They hustlin in haste to feed expensive taste
But me, I gotta grind out there on that paper chase
They turn they back on clements, but I'm still gon ride
Too many fish up in the water trying to float with the tide
No matter how high the gas price, I'm still gon drive
Quite crying and complaining, partner, swallow your pride
While you blaming everybody for your same bad luck
I'mma be on the come up, sun-down to sun-up
I gotta get it
