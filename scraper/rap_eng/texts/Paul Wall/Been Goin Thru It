I'll be alright I just been going through it
I'll be alright I just been going through it
I'll be alright I just been going through it
I'll be alright

First, they call me brother then they steal from me
Then they tell the world that I'm the one that acting funny
Hating spreading like peanut butter
And the closest ones to me hating undercover
They waiting on me to fail with a smile
But you better grab your sneakers
You're going to be here awhile
First they love you then they hate you for the same thing
Because you made it out the struggle and they can't
Going to places and doing things that they ain't

I'm trying to show them they can make it out too
But they'd rather sit around gossiping like fools

I'm still here breathing courtesy of God
Loyalty and faith never turn on the squad
But I'm still here
I know God has plans
Boys switch up on you soon as they get the chance

Why don't you ask who gave who what change
They label me a bad guy cuz I can't pay their bills
I got my own bills b**** go buy your own Grillz


Telling me I ain't keeping it real
