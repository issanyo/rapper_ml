You know I'mma crawl slow, popped up sittin on them swangaz and fo's
Jockin all haters with my gucci shades on
I'mma stay playa, you know playaz get chose
So when I come through-I got my diamonds exposed

(Verse 1-Paul Wall)
Well it's that grain gripper, that hold the throne-I'm straight up out of that third coast
I split cigars, and poured up barre-so pop the seal, let's take a toast
I stunt the most I'm still holdin-my paint wet and these streets soakin
I'm runnin diamonds like James Loney-with the top down and windows open
Posted up just like Durant, on South Lee with big mix
My partna Black got two chicks that's turnin tricks and work for tips
Stayin licks since I was six with ice grill and diamond lips
So boy I'm bout to pull out Beritz, but watch ya step my paint drips
I'm juiced up in Serria Mist-my bass loud and I'm crawlin slow
I'm draped up...Yeah that's fuh sho-them karat stones they make me glow
I'm slammin do's and I'm sittin low, and I been in the game since '94
I'm gettin dough...my pockets fat-in all black just like the crow
Where the hoes?, where the drank?-where that money?, I need that bank
Come up off of that cash my dogg, I'm bout that money you think I ain't
I'mma country boy from South Texas, better known as the land of trill
I'm trippin fo's and I'm flippin ho's and I'm comin down with woman and grill

[Chamillitary Mayne!]
Takin pics with this model chick and she lookin thick-said she from Atlanta
Tellin me she love my talk, and she live in Texas and love my grammar
Tellin me that she bangin Screw and she need a pic of me on the camera
My whole crew said that broad bad so I looked at them and said gon'and have her
Uhhh, playa don't have to talk
Look at my chain and ask the cost
Diamonds on my neck...Yeah that's a house
Soon as I'm done might pass her off
Red over seal, Yeah that's the South
Blue over seal, Yeah that's the North
A.C.blow, Yeah that's my frost
All of that smoke, Yeah that's exhaust
In my I-M-P-A-L-A, Impala
I-M-A-P-L-A-Y-A, and balla
I drop her off and say call you tomorrow
She callin back askin how come I ain't call her
Cause I'm chasin my paper still and you know how jealous my paper get
You know I'm attached to my paper tryna hold it down like a paper clip
Pimp C had told me if you see the chick then take the chick
And if you a playa, you'll get chose and these other boys will go pay for it

(Verse 3-Lil' Keke)
[Dirty South, Stand up...H-Town's finest Don Ke]
I ride big and I shine bright
I'm lookin good and my swag right
My paint wet and my slab tight
My chain gold and my diamonds white
I'm Don Ke and this H-Town-them playas chose and them hatas mad
I'm Screwed Up and I'm Underground, I'm still Trill like Bun and Chad
Gucci shades with them new lens
Crawlin slow in my new Benz
Comin through with this bad broad-me, her, and her two friends
Hatas lookin, I still ball
Twenty-sixes they real tall
My grill did, my rocks big-my screens on, my top fall
Popped up with them fo's on-twenty one but she still grown
I let her ride and get inside, cause "I'm A G" was her ringtone
Hit the stage with my diamonds out
They don't know what my shine bout
Dirty South my grind spot
Boys hatin but I'm still hot
So clean in this dirty game-still a legend with plenty fame
My ice nice like Paul and Cham, pay attention it color change
TF Records and Swisha House-Chamillitary and S.U.C
Ask the streets, I'm still the best-this whole state it belong to Ke
