Sweeter than a cherry pop, pop
I be at the very top, pop
Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop

Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
(P. Wall, Baby Bash)
Pop me like a lemon drop

Pop that thang baby, shake watcha got
Yeah, you workin' with a lot, baby, please don't stop
Gotcha body lookin' hot, don't mind if I watch
Ya head is top notch, ya skin is butterscotch

Into the club, all eyes on you
Baby you look good, you're thicker than stew
You got friends, boo? Well, I got mine, too
The club closed at two, can I roll with you?

You hip like MK, hood like Mary J, pretty as Lisa Raye
Baby, can we play?
I call you lemon drop 'cause you look so sweet
Gon' pop what you got baby, be my freak, come on

Sweeter than a cherry pop, pop
I be at the very top, pop
Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop

Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop

I don't just want the table girl, I need a whole wing
Keep the bottle pourin' 'til we need a submarine
When she off caffeine, baby girl you're so active
Strong as a mattress, grab on my package

Go-go boots from the stage to the cage
California wild fire, hot in a rage
Check her Facebook page, video upload
My number one hina, so damn throw, so damn cold

Candy-coated like Skittles
I'm a pop that like I pop two thizzles
Girl, get your smash on, sweet and low so tender
When I got you, I don't need no Splenda

Sweeter than a cherry, pop
I be at the very top, pop
Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop

Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop

Baby, gon' do that, fine but you knew that
Holla at a man and break me off that Kit Kat
Lookin' so mean with them dangerous curves
I'ma have you wet and needy by the end of the verse

You're the first number one top pick of them all
Bring your girl for Bash, you can roll with Mr. Wall
You the baddest I saw when you're ready to bop
Baby, be my lemon drop, don't stop, don't stop

Sweeter than a cherry pop, pop
I be at the very top, pop
Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop

Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop

Sweeter than a cherry pop, pop
I be at the very top, pop
Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop

Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop
Pop me like a lemon drop
