[Hook: Baby Bash & GT Garza]
Smoke a cookie pack and keep rollin', keep rollin'
Told her I'll be back in the morning, I'll be back in the morning
I don't even know where I'm going, no, no
Smoke a cookie pack and keep rollin'
Rooooll, roooll
Rooooll, roooll

[Verse 1: GT Garza]
I like Super Blue Dream, I like Super Lemon Haze
I got OG by the rillo and that double dutch for days
I got Sour Diesel strains, chronic runnin' through my veins
Yeah I'm cool with Mary Jane and she coming on the way
I got paperplanes for her, I got different names for her
She'll be [?], it depends on what I order
I like LA Confidential, or that leafy Merry Crystal
When you twisting up that Cookie, Bash let me smoke that with you
Let's get high

[Hook: Baby Bash & GT Garza]
Smoke a cookie pack and keep rollin', keep rollin'
Told her I'll be back in the morning, I'll be back in the morning
I don't even know where I'm going, no, no
Smoke a cookie pack and keep rollin'
Let's get high
Rooooll, roooll
Rooooll, roooll

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
I be cruising down the sunset, smokin' on Sherbert
Rollin' up Gelato, gettin' high cause I'm a stoner
Everytime I pull up you can smell the aroma
3X Crazy or that OG odour
Smokin' on that Cookie pack cause I prefer that good
I don't know where I'm going but I'm grippin' on wood
Paintin' through the town, smokin' marijuana
A little bit of Hennessy mixed my [?]

[Verse 3: Lil Raider]
Smell so good when I break it down
Got my Cookie grinder going 'round and 'round
Cookie packs, want bags from town
Satellite when poured around
Secret session, H-Town
Smokin' on weed [?]
UPS, Graham
We get it there, let's blaze now

[Hook: Baby Bash & GT Garza]
Smoke a cookie pack and keep rollin', keep rollin'
Told her I'll be back in the morning, I'll be back in the morning
I don't even know where I'm going, no, no
Smoke a cookie pack and keep rollin'
Let's get high
Rooooll, roooll
Rooooll, roooll

[Verse 4: Paul Wall]
Roll it up, light it up
I'm gettin' higher than a price of gas during war time
Satellite supply, buds bigger than a lime
Bubblegum Cookie wrapped in the gold leaf
Roll a fronto up pronto and add some kief
Add the wax, higher price
Higher grade, had to tax
Top Shelf, top notch
First crop, best batch
Light it up and pass, minor carpet, watch the ash
High octane gass, smokin' on the finest grass

[Outro: GT Garza]
Let's get high
Rooooll, roooll
Let's get high
Rooooll, roooll
Let's get high
