[Chorus: Paul Wall & Crys Wall]
You could catch me ridin' in the Lac, top down, seat back
Keepin' heat up on my lap, I'm throwed (I'm throwed)
Every hood that I'm in, white cup in my hand
Blowin' kush in the wind, I'm blowed (I'm blowed)
Any day of the week, new grill, new piece
From my head to my feet, I'm cold (I'm cold)
New shoes on my ride, bad bitch on my side
Man That's how gangstas roll (That's how gangstas roll)

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I'm higher than a top flite, throwed like a splitter
My pockets keep gettin' bigger cuz I'm one bad figure
Boppas n gold diggaz on the track at work
I'm hurtin' feelings in the Benz wit a deuce and a squirt
I'm a fillibuster for hustlaz invadin' them mark bustaz
Leanin' like I'm on crutches as I ski taste slurp
Swangin' and woodworkin' convertin' this closed curtains
For certain, I betta not spill no purple drank on my shirt
I'm hustle for occupation, I'm grindin' paper chasin
Deez boyz is steady hatin', so this pistol I'm embracin'
Dat Lac is so amazin' when the elbows is skatin'
Cranker wires and vogue tires, one hell of collaboration
Amos, Farris n Slaton, we Jordan, Jackson and Pippen
Banana clip for dem snitches tryin' to monkey wrench my pimpin'
Neva been caught slippin' cuz dat Glock I hold
Now let me tell ya how I roll, come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Comin' down in a candy Lac, old skool
Wavin' trunk on dem punks, act a fool
Tippin' paint, drippin' wet like a pool
Breakin' brews, neck cool, it's full of jewels
Rumor is dat dem jackers on da sideline schemin' and plottin'
But my mind on dem boppaz if I spot'em I got'em
I got slabs, I got foreigns wit the seats all plush
I got brandy wine gloss, baby please don't touch
I got 20's, I got 4's, I got screens and such
Boppaz yappin' cuz they say I tend to cap too much
I got starch in my jeans and da crease so sharp
Headlights on my ear when the night get dark
White ones on my toes, brand new out the box
Interior decoratin' the watch, I'm connectin' the dots
I got stocks, I got money, that's a fat billfold
Now let me tell ya how I roll, come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Hatin' is so contagious these days, there's no cure
This new outbreak in Houston is out of hand for sure
These boyz is steady lyin', my money is multiplyin'
Look close there's no denyin' them boyz softer than fur
Killa kush smoke I blow as the lungs inhale
Gangsta leanin' on dat oil, I got a story to tell
Lawz trippin' when they see me askin' "what's that smell"
Raw fed exed me some X pills we call it e-mail
Lights, camera, action, I'm the shit and I show it
A young gangsta hood boy, so fly and I know it
Steady breakin' boys off, 5 karats in earlobes
Givin' somethin' that you can feel, my swangin's is En Vogue
I'm too cool for school, all work no play
Impeccable with this pen, I got somethin' to say
My repertoire is throwed, I follow tha G code
Let me tell ya how I roll, come on

[Chorus]
