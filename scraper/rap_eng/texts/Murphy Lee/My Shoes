[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kanja]
Now look at me, look at everybody else in the parking lot, take a look at my shoes
Cause I do what I do everybody else talkin' like, take a look at my shoes
And it's amazing how real I am and how lame they are, it's the shoes on my car, or the shoes on my body?
I'm a do what I do, whilst you take a look at my shoes

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Hey rich boy looky here, just got my cutty back
Threw some D's on that, Now I want my money back
They only 20 inches, and ordered 28 o' those
69 Blue with' new pirelli panty-hose
I call her crutches, my car seat
Ya see I wake up to a chick so it ain't hard to get up
And all ya haters play in tha back, so you can hate me from a distance
Cause I'm lookin' down on ya boy, I'm 28 inches from the ground

[Chorus: Kanja]
Now look at me, look at everybody else in the parking lot, take a look at my shoes
Cause I do what I do everybody else talkin' like, take a look at my shoes
And it's amazing how real I am and how lame they are, it's the shoes on my car, or the shoes on my body?
I'm a do what I do, whilst you take a look at my shoes

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
These ain't comin' out pimpin, naw naw naw
You see me dirty now, haters gotta point em out
My sneakers stage frighten, sorry they ain't comin out
Them camp boys go to jail and I'm a ride em out
And I ain't gotta holla at unk, for them to walk it out, (walk it out)
See I'm a real boss, say homie that's real talk
I make ya see my vision clear like a tear drop
I'm gettin' real guap, I'm poppin' like pills pop
Graffiti shell toes, I'm real hip-hop
Now take a look at these, they ain't even been released
I got em 2 months before they even hit the streets
That's thinkin for the future, and everything exclusive
Ya money in the bank and still shoppin with the boosters
So while you lookin' stupid, I'm spittin like I'm toothless
Pay my respect to Eazy when I got the coupe roofless
These dudes think they winnin' all along they really losing
So St. Louis go on tell em who the truth is

[Chorus: Kanja]
Now look at me, look at everybody else in the parking lot, take a look at my shoes
Cause I do what I do everybody else talkin' like, take a look at my shoes
And it's amazing how real I am and how lame they are, it's the shoes on my car, or the shoes on my body?
I'm a do what I do, whilst you take a look at my shoes

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Ay yo murph man was homeschooled, clean as a cop car
Stay in a shop boy, and party like a rockstar!
Monte Carlo pullin up, parkin lot eye stopper
Chrome all on that bitch, look at it and need an eye doctor
Fresh pair o' everything, smellin like dough, got the hood, paparazzi
Dirty everybody know me, I'm a St. Louis Lunatic
You can call me Dirk, rim burstin with my style
See ya lookin like murph, but these shoes hard to fit
Might end up blindin ya, my best BMW sittin on onion
Now I bet ya never ever seen wheels shinin like these, (nooo)
And I bet ya never seen kicks change colour like these, (nooo)
Now when I'm rollin through my hood, girls wanna cruise
Dudes all wishin they could walk in my shoes
But I'm just doin me and so should you...

[Chorus: Kanja]
Now look at me, look at everybody else in the parking lot, take a look at my shoes
Cause I do what I do everybody else talkin' like, take a look at my shoes
And it's amazing how real I am and how lame they are, it's the shoes on my car, or the shoes on my body?
I'm a do what I do, whilst you take a look at my shoes
