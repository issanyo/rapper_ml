Can I get a hey hey?
I get a ho ho
Can I get a hey hey?
I get a ho ho
Verse one, what's it gon be today? Let's see
The yellow Benz or the red Navi', iny, miny, minne, mo
That's the way I pick when I'm ready to roll
Murph Dert got the limos wit his vehicles
Yeah that's the way it go when you got money to blow
Ho well then, say no mo', just think, I was on my way to the sto'
I got scratched but I don't got nails
Got my own truck but I wanna drive trails
Plus I won a house in A T L and that depends on my sales
And I'm tryin' to get a mil before my album hit the shelves
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no signin' bonus
'Tics went platinum to remind ya homey
I'm not a restroom so ain't no need to stall
I don't run or walk now so I can give it to 'em all
Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I ain't been in this spot for a minute
I say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get derrty with it
Now baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish
I don't wanna leave by myself
Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself
Ooh, shit, taxi
Verse two, I call her back from an earlier week
Four in the mornin' they be like mm-mm nah I ain't asleep
Career whore, stay on top of convenient stores
Get pictures of me in they Victoria Secret drawers
Keep summin' hot on tour, couldn't keep anything hotter
Make sure they know before what is really in store
I adore the ones that call me Tohri, true story
I created Hoodrats, so these new models bore me
See I load up the 7 wit 7's, for 8's I can't wait
9's be one time and Dimes we won't date
So now I got 11's and 12's
Wit at least 13 or 14 reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blue Cantrell, he-he-he-he-he-he-he-hell
I remember when you smashed the bail
I'm just a, dirty who can and you hatas stand out
I'm like that pie in the window, I'm just too damn hot
Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I ain't been in this spot for a minute
Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get derrty with it
Now baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish
I don't wanna leave by myself
Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself
Ooh, shit, taxi
Three, can I get a hey hey? I get a ho ho
Not you the one behind ya girl
I done spit two verses tryin' to find ya girl
And if you need a sex deal, lemme sign ya girl
Just give me your information and I'll keep you in heavy rotation
I wanna touch you where the sun don't shine
I got a watch but I don't got time
So if you wit it, then you wit that's good
'Cuz if you not then I could simply take you back to the hood
'Cuz I love my hoes, pimpin' ain't easy but it's under control
I got a lot of shit in me but I'm a commode
Cell phone, area code overload, I called Mannie in Louisian-ny
She said the Mo's is off the hook and make 'em move they fanny
Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I ain't been in this spot for a minute
Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get derrty with it
Now baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish
Hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I ain't been in this spot for a minute
Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get derrty with it
Now baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish
I don't wanna leave by myself
Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself
Ooh, shit, taxi
