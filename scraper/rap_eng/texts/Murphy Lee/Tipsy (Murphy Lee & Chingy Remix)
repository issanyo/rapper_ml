[Intro:]
[J-Kwon]
Ay yo
Track Boys
This possibly be the biggest remix ever
Let's go!

[Verse 1:]
[J-Kwon]
A here comes the B to the C to the D
No cat out the Lou
Gangsta as me

Ya'll hit two, I'm jus goin' for three
Bottle full of Cris
But I still rock a T
And ya'll gotta love the fact
That I'm from the streets

Drink so much that
It fucked up my T
People wasn't drunk
So why they wanna be

'Cuz you get eleven thousand dpins in a week
Here comes the C to the
B to the A
Never fall off like B2K

Wanna get tipsy
You one drink away
Why would I buy
When it's better when you pay

Track Boys from the Lou
Jermaine from the A
But they got the boy gettin' tipsy
With Sway

Then she said she had somethin to say
"One hit wonder"
Bitch, I'm here to stay!

[Chorus repeat 2X]
Now everybody everybody
Everybody everybody
Everybody in the club gettin tipsy

Now everybody everybody
Everybody everybody
Everybody in the club gettin tipsy

[Verse 2:]
[Chingy]
I pulled up to the club already filthy
She say she don't get fucked
She innocent til proven guilty
Walkin' VIP

Cats screaming GIB
Skull cap with a bib?
On the back DTP

This girl staring
So I put a spell on her like a gypsy
We bought up the bar
With hundreds
Some drunk
Not tipsy

Don't trip cuz the whole
St. Louis is riding with me

Cats start hating
Tell them people come get me
Yeah!

Here comes the king of the Midwest
C H to the I to the N to the G Y
My homies in the back
Puffin' on some ooo wee

I know the owner
So I snuck in the ooo zee
Plus if I blow somebody
They gon' try to sue me

If rapping was a film
I'm starring in this movie
The Git It Boys hurr
They gon get some boozee?
Lets take it from the club to the ja-cuzzi

[Repeat Chorus 2x:]

[Verse 3:]
[Murphy Lee:]
(Ay yo) 1 I am the dude that the people call Murph
Check my resume
You can see I put in work

Two (two) women
That I add to my phone
Three roll [?]
Smoke one when I get home
Four real dirty you and I [?]

Those the people I thank
For my damn record sales
Five new broads and one ain't broke

White Porsche truck
Wood grain like coke
Now everybody in the club
Lookin spiffy
Mamma got on a dress
Boots from the sixties

Oh girl
Shantay tipsy
Kim, Kesha and Pam
All leaving with me

Jackers wanna get me
It's not that simply

Seventeen fillin' up
But you can make it empty

Now which one of ya'll
Niggas wanna tempt me?
(Now which one of ya'll niggas wanna tempt me?)

[Repeat Chorus 2X:]

[Repeat 4X:]
Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy
