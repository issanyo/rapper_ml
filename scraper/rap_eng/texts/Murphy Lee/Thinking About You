[Intro]
(Scoo - by - Doo)
It's that girl Solange (don't stop) and Murphy Lee
(Scoo - by - Doo - by doo)
We are the Scooby-Doo, uh oh, from that and mo', you know
(Scoo - by - Doo)
(Scoo - by - Doo - by doo)

[Chorus]
Thinking about you, where are you?
Cause I need to hear from you know (need to hear from you)
Is this a mystery, can't help but think
What is happening to you now?
Thinking about you, where are you?
Cause I need to hear from you know (need to hear from you)
Is this a mystery, constantly (don't think it is)
If you love me, Scooby-Dooby dooby doo

[Verse: Solange]
Where did my baby go?
Boy take that mask off
You used to be all upon me
Now you just trash talk
Split personlaity, pullin' 360's, don't even call me
It's such a mystery, my Scooby-Dooby dooby doo

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Scoo - by - Doo)
Murphy: Doo wop, doo wop
(Scoo - by)
Murphy: Oh, oh, yo, yo, yo

[Verse: Solange]
Bring back my baby so
We can be like old days
I cannot take much more of
You and your silly ways
I'm tryin' to reach you, but I'm not Miss Cleo
You got me so confused, Scooby-Dooby dooby doo

[Verse: Murphy Lee]
You know my 7 digits
You know my address Solo come and visit
I'm just keepin' it realistic
I'm young so I'm gon' kick it from Atlantic to the Pacific
Forget it, I admit it, I only leave it to missin'
Now listen, meet me in Oklahoma
We take a private jet to West Bahamas
Mami wherever you want 'a just don't trip
We can dip just let me make it legit
Permission slip for permission to slip

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Scoo - by - Doo)
Murphy: Doo wop, doo wah
(Scoo - by)
Murphy: Oh, oh, yo, yo, yo

[Verse: Murphy Lee]
C'mon Solo, you know I ain't your average young dude
You know I can go wherever whenever I want to
So if I could stop at Lou, she's mystery and confusion
Frequent flyer miles from St. Louis to Houston
I would do it, see most girls be kind 'a mad
Like Usher, "I Got It Bad," so introduce me to Dad
So we can, read the psalms, make clothes with ya Mom's
Thumbs up like the Fonz, Murphy Lee and Solange, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solange and Murphy Lee]
Uh oh, oh
Uh oh, oh (uh)
Uh oh, oh
Uh oh, oh (uh)
Uh oh, oh
Uh oh, oh
Doo wop, doo wah
Yo, yo, yo
Scoo-by-doo
