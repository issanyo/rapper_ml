Can I get a hey, hey
I get a ho, ho
Can I get a hey, hey

(Murphy Lee)
Verse one
What's gon be today(Let's see)
The yellow Benz or the red Navi
Ani mini miney moe
That's the way I pick when I'm ready to roll
Murph durph got dillenmas wit his vehcle
That's the way it go when you got money to blow
Ho!
Well then say no mo
Just think I was on my way to da sto'
I got scratch but I don't got nails
Got my own truck but I wanna drive trails
Plus I want a house in ATL
And that depends on the sells
And I'm tryna get a mill
Befo' my album hit the shelves
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no signing bonus
Ticks went platium to remind you homie
I'm not a restroom
So ain't no need to stall
And I don't run, I walk by
So I can give it to dem all

Chorus
I said hold up
Wait a minute
Let me put some
Pimpin' in it now
A big booty I'm recommending
And I ain't been in this spot fo' a minute
I said hold up
Wait a minute
Cause she wanna get
Dirty wit it now
Baby gurl wanna handle her business
I guess we'll be back when we finish

Bridge
I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself)
Shit! Taxi! Awwwwwwww

Verse Two
I caught back on a earlier beat
Four in da morning they be like "UH-UH naw I ain't sleep"
Convenient whores
Stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in they victoria secret drawers
Keep sumting hot on tour
Ken and Kiana make sure they know before
What's really in store
Our daughter wanted to call me Tori
True story
I created hoodrats
So this new might bore me
See I normally settle for sevens
For eights I can't wait
Nines be wanting time
And dimes be wanting dates
So now I got elevens and twelves
Wit atleast 13 or 14 reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
He He He He He He Hell
I remember when you smashed the bell
I'm just a dutty who can now you haters can't lie
I'm like dat pie in the window
I'm just too damn hot

Chorus
I said hold up
Wait a minute

Let me put some
Pimpin' in it now
A big booty I'm recommending
And I ain't been in this spot fo' a minute
I said hold up
Wait a minute
Cause she wanna get
Dirty wit it now
Baby gurl wanna handle her business
I guess we'll be back when we finish

Bridge
I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself)
Shit! Taxi! Awwwwwwww

Verse three

Can I get a hey, hey
I get ho, ho
Not you the one behind ya gurl
I don spent two verses tryna find ya gurl
And if you need a sex deal let me sign ya gurl
Just give me your information
And I'll leave you in heavy rotation
I wanna touch you where the sun don't shine
I got a watch but I don't got time
So if you wit it, then you wit it that's good
But if you not I can simply take you back to the hood
'Cause I love my hoes
Pimpin ain't easy but it's under control
I got alot of shit in me but I'm not a comode
Cell phone, Area code overload
I call Mannie and Lil' Wheezy in
They said put Moses on the hook
And make 'em move they fannie

Chorus
I said hold up
Wait a minute
Let me put some
Pimpin' in it now
A big booty I'm recommending
And I ain't been in this spot fo' a minute
I said hold up
Wait a minute
Cause she wanna get
Dirty wit it now
Baby gurl wanna handle her business
I guess we'll be back when we finish

Chorus
I said hold up
Wait a minute
Let me put some
Pimpin' in it now
A big booty I'm recommending
And I ain't been in this spot fo' a minute
I said hold up
Wait a minute
Cause she wanna get
Dirty wit it now
Baby gurl wanna handle her business
I guess we'll be back when we finish

Bridge
I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself)
Shit! Taxi! Awwwwwwww

Just give me your information
And I'll leave you in heavy rotation
