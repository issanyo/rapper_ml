[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

[Verse 2: Kyjuan]
Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

[Verse 3: Ali]
Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

[Verse 4: Murphy Lee]
Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 5: Murphy Lee]
We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, "Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes"
She said, "I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue"
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice"
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), "Thanks for the advice"

[Verse 6: Ali]
I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force, "NE" behind the "O"

[Verse 7: Kyjuan]
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

[Verse 8: Nelly]
Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 9: Kyjuan]
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

[Verse 10: Murphy Lee]
Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

[Verse 11: Nelly]
Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Verse 12: Ali]
Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine , (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl
