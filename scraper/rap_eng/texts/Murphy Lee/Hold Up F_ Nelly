Can I get a hey, hey?
I get a ho, ho
Can I get a hey, hey?
I get a ho, ho

What's it gon' be today?
(Let's see)
The yellow Benz or the red Navi', iny, miny, ony, mo
That's the way I pick when I'm ready to roll

Murph Dert got the limos with his vehicles
(Yeah, that's the way it go when you got money to blow)
Ho, well then, say no mo'
Just think, I was on my way to the sto'

I got scratched but I don't got nails
Got my own truck but I wanna drive trails
Plus I won a house in ATL and that depends on my sales
And I'm tryin' to get a mil before my album hit the shelves

And I ain't talkin' 'bout no signin' bonus
'Tics went platinum to remind ya homey
I'm not a restroom so ain't no need to stall
I don't run or walk now so I can give it to em all

Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I ain't been in this spot for a minute

Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get dirty with it
Now, baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish

I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself)
Ooh, shit, taxi

I call her back from an earlier week
Four in the mornin' they be like
(Mm-mm nah I ain't asleep)
Career whore, stay on top of convenient stores
Get pictures of me in they Victoria Secret drawers

Keep summin' hot on tour, couldn't keep anything hotter
Make sure they know before what is really in store
I adore the ones that call me Tohri, true story
I created hood rats, so these new models bore me

See I load up the seven with seven's, for eight's I can't wait
Nine's be one time and Dimes we won't date
So now I got eleven's and twelve's
Wit at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell

I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrall, he-he-he-he-he-he-he-hell
I remember when you smashed the bail
I'm just a, dirty who can and you hatas stand out
I'm like the pie in the window, I'm just too damn hot

Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I ain't been in this spot for a minute

Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get dirty wit it
Now, baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish

I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself)
Ooh, shit, taxi

(Can I get a hey hey? Can I get a ho ho?)
Not you the one behind ya girl
I done spit two verses tryin' to find ya girl
And if you need a sex deal, lemme sign ya girl
Just give me your information and I'll keep you in heavy rotation

I wanna touch you wherre the sun don't shine
I got a watch but I don't got time
So if you wit it, then you wit that's good
'Cause if you not then I could simply take you back to the hood
'Cause I love my hoes

Pimpin' ain't easy but it's under control
I got a lot of shit in me but I'm a commode
Cell phone, area code overload, I called Mannie in Louisian-ny
Said the MO's is off the hook and make em move they fanny

Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I ain't been in this spot for a minute

Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get dirty with it
Now, baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish

Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I ain't been in this spot for a minute

Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get dirty with it
Now, baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish

I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you ain't gotta leave by yourself)
Ooh, shit, taxi
