Hunt someone and lick em, make em salaam
Praise the Lord or say peace to God
I'm just a Skool Boy, call me Mr. Do-What-You-Do-Fool
Claim where you from or we will claim where you move to
Home is where you make it, eat a meal and get naked
You could, walk in yo drawers and nobody could say shit

I ain't dyin' but yo I'm definitely fight for em
And keep it tight for em, and keep it hype for em
And buy at the bar whatever gon keep the night goin
Do what you do and you do it, just do it big
And if you live to get it then you gon get it how you live cuz..
