Watch it
Move back away from him
Is he dead?
[Sigh]
He passed out on the sofa
Whoa!

[Pacewon]
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Light a blunt, get pumped
P-A-C-E
Live entertainment, replace TV
Made for the kids, the DJs and fiends
Makin' y'all jam like freeways and streets (Screech!)
I keep it moving like soul to soul
Record label, my whole team going gold
Dumbin' out
You run your mouth rapid
'Till I see your face and I slap it
Yo! I'm a wizard at this
Weave a spell, it's like magic
Turn that bully boy into a faggot
Turn that pig cop that been jockin' you right back to maggots
Turn his blue steel into plastic
Yo! I turn boogie in the goodie, sit back and roll a fat one
Turn a vinyl record into platinum
Turn a real calm motherfucker to a thug that want action
I'm here to heal the sick, I'm like aspirin
Yo! I walk on water like the saviour (Pacewon!)
I declared war on the mayor
You know me, low key
Sittin' on my porch gettin' high I'm like Smokey
Chipped up celly
Cussin' out Sony (Where the fuck is my cheque?)
Yo! I don't just live by reputation
I'm thuggin', with a weapon waitin'
To slug you
Love to
Treat me like Gotti when I come through
Run crews, aunts and uncles I love

I touch (You! You! You!)
Let me set it off for (You! You! You!)
Always keep it raw for (You! You! You!)
Rock it to the core for (You! You! You!)
Yo! What you want? Yo! (You! You! You!)
Yo! Can't touch me (You! You! You!)
Mad 'cos your girl wanna...Uhhh (You! You! You!)
Who got as much money (You! You! You!)
Yo! What you want?

Yo! I always think busy
Keep the money crispy
Smoke out back to back phillys
Let's go half
I got fifty
You fuckin' with a grisly
Hippie, make you feel jiggy
Make your girl wanna fuck, wanna cuddle up and kiss me
Licky, licky, tricky, dizzy, silly
I don't need game, I just keep it on the real-ly
Bust shots like they 9 mill-y
'Tis for my people in The Bricks
For my people out in Philly
Connecticut, New York city
Bad Boy, see the no smokin' signs
Still light a blitty
Dance around like P. Diddy
Greedy motherfucker, don't care
Grab your kitty by the titty
She love it
Like Kim do Biggie (Huh!)
Dig me, the world move quickly
Killin' off the weak and the sickly
Believe it or not it's like rippies
Some niggas rap, some niggas flip keys
Some bitches strip-tease
Some work at Wimpy
Gotta crush, hot and heavy on an MC
And like Fat Joe, jealous ones envy
Pacewon, you wanna be like me
Carhartt cap on, new pair of Nikes
Virgo vibes, might pull a Piscies
Too close to Aries, turn out to be sheisty
Yo! I'm being watched by a strike team
Wanted by the feds before the age of nineteen
Yo! Yo! Be careful standin' by me
I'm tricky, might slip a mickey in your ice cream
Yo! Yo! Yo! 'Till my day come
Best regards all of y'all
Pacewon

You! You! You!
You! You! You!
Keep it raw for (You! You! You!)
Rock it to the core for (You! You! You!)
Yo! What you want? Yo! (You! You! You!)
Yo! Can't touch me (You! You! You!)
Mad 'cos your girl wanna...Uhhh (You! You! You!)
Who got as much money (You! You! You!)
Yo! What you want?
