One time for my people, my blunted out heads
We represent the real, let the underground spread
To the kids in the high schools, hoods that you drive through
Made for the kids with the higher I.Q
Got sent to that Rah Rah, I Declare War shit
Outsidaz, Night Life, witty metaphor shit
Start in the basement, push til it's corporate
Put in a place, to be sold and make a fortunate, for example

[Azz-Iz]
The deeper it get, the deeper we go
Ya talk tough, but beem in the O's, weak in the blows
Plus you don't go enough meat on ya bones
Mess around'll you'll sleep from this weaker then nome
I'm like M.L.K., when I'm speakin' a pawn
Settin' mad bullet sprays til they reachin' ya thong
For cats that grow naps never seakin' a comb
Sloman Shield couldn't help you when we creep in ya home

[Nawshis]
To ya fake niggas, that said I'll never make it
Ya trick is in my bed right now, ass naked
I taught ya ho, how to properly act
Now she got three cribs, you pay the property tax
You can catch me in the Bricks, lookin' plush in the six
Wit ya main chicken, she suckin' my dick
Fuckin' wit God, producin' nothin' but hits
Wanna battle my click, go ahead and spit
You not fresh, nope, you not def
Like Tribe Called Quest, I gets served flat as a Hot Sex
To take a chick to shop at lot less
Date a bitch from my projects, she runnin' ya pockets

[D.U.]
That's you-a, grindin' in that cat Cougar
Gat smoother than Zab Judah in black Puma's
Cash ruler, change my name to Abdullah
While ya A&R trynna make ya track smoother
Hit the liquor store than get the raw in ya jaw
That stick ya, then chill like it's still vinegar
From projects to Bel-Air, models chicks to welfare
Do we get the punky? (HELL YEAH!)

[Hook 2X]

HELL YEAH!
HELL YEAH!
HELL YEAH!
HELL YEAH!
