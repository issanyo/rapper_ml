[Hook 1]
I've got the mind of Einstein
Your favorite rapper loves me, he said it on "Fine Line"
Ask Royce da 5'9", Spunk, or Bizarre
We used to smoke while Kim was cuffed in the trunk of the car
We used to write, rap, crack jokes, and perform
Backstage at our shows be like a scene from a porn
We'd party every night, be hungover in the morn'
It seems like a dream, man, what were we on?

[Verse 1]
I was so intrigued when I heard Shady mention my name
I felt relieved cause for a while I was thinking like
Wow my pal bounced in the bottom of the ninth like when every out counts
And it made me kind of mad to the point I started dissin' him
I don't know if you've been listening
The dissin' was a cry for help, cause I was missin' him
Imagine if your best friend was fuckin' missin'
And you know he's still alive, but you can't get in touch
And he's not reachin' out to you so now y'all ain't gettin' up
And in your head you're like really? am I tripping? what the fuck?
Then you see on TV, your friend is worth a million bucks
So that's why I did it, let's leave it in the past
Tie it in a bag and put it out with the trash
And let me take this time to put my pride to the side
And honor him correctly while we're both still alive
See I know why his fans come out and form lines
When it comes to emceeing, he's the greatest of all time
Yeah I said it, dude is iller than Biggie and Pun
He done sold more records than Diddy and Run
Then he took a fuckin' chance, signed 50, and won
So I just wanna say I think he's nifty as fuck
Susie and my fellow stans, are you with me, or what?
I'mma tell you all about it, just give me a buck
Bitch

I've got the mind of Einstein
Your favorite rapper loves me, he said it on "Fine Line"
Ask Royce da 5'9", Spunk, or Bizarre
We used to smoke while Kim was cuffed in the trunk of the car
We used to write, rap, crack jokes, and perform
Backstage at our shows be like a scene from a porn
Every song that we did, lines was gettin' quoted
Like this next verse, Eminem wrote it

[Verse 2]
Scrub bucket, step in the club rugged
Grab a jug, chug it, and talk some ol' bugged drug shit
Thinkin' you tough nugget, you see this slug? hug it
Harm anybody's bones for thinkin' they thug ruggish
Walk around the streets sluggish, fucked up, but fuck it
I'm fuckin' the world like I love public
This style is hard to swallow so you upchuck it
Get obstructed, handcuffed, kidnapped, and abducted

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
I remember gettin' high and ridin' over a bridge
Pullin' up in San Francisco and fighting some kids
And it was cool cause it was our first scuffle as a unit
We don't back down from a beef, we step to it
We don't give way to a storm, we get through it
We even took our motto from Nike, "Just Do It"
We made an oath, cracked a bottle, made a toast
The oath should be honored cause I feel I'm kind of dope
So uh, keep it real, my brother
Hook your mans up with a deal my brother
Child support's killing me, my license suspended
I can't even get behind the wheel my brother
Sometimes I feel my brother
I let the music industry steal my brother
So I'm out for vengeance, screamin' and blastin'
And I'mma start a new group and name it after him
I'm startin' up the Shady Corps
Spittin' that real hip-hop like this was Eighty-Four
That Role Model nigga, that rah-rah, that crazy raw
Music people payin' more attention than they pay to y'all
So I'mma be fine, just like these ho's that I'm meetin' online
Just like these ho's that I meet at the mall
If you see Eminem, tell him give me a call, yo

[Hook 1]
