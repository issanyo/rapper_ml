[Intro]
In the end, there can be only

[Hook]
One, Pacewon
Live from the bricks
(yeah), Mr. Green
Ripping through the mix
One, Pacewon
Live from the bricks
(yeah), Mr. Green

[Verse 1]
Ever since the day my mother pushed me out her stomach
I strive to be the best MC that's ever done it
So every time I come with the songs, just remember
I do this for the chance to be the greatest rapper ever
And if not the greatest, then I'mma be the freshest
Witty and poetic, yet rough around the edges
Just like KRS, Redman, Biggie and Das
Busta Rhymes, Method Man, Common and Nas
And if I can't, I'mma still be the people's champ
And save hip-hop from the man's evil plans
Be there when Jay-z and Cam need a hand
And jam like the stuff you eat with Peter Pan
Tour around the land, open up a few spots
Have you hating on me because your crew's not
And get more play than Snoop Dogg's debut got
'Till I make history and outsell 2Pac

[Hook]
One, Pacewon
Live from the bricks
(yeah), Mr. Green
Ripping through the mix
One, Pacewon
Live from the bricks
(yeah), Mr. Green

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Ever since the day my mother pushed me out her stomach
I always felt deep inside that I would run it
Cause all these other rappers I hear wasn't making
A noise that they should be making, I was hating
Thinking up a way to be the slickest rapper spitting
Using similes when these little rappers didn't
Living mad large like the king of Arabia
It would take 80 Eminemâ€™s to be shadier
It would take a whole psych boy to be crazier
What could I say to ya, I just may be the
Freshest baby ta, pierce the labia
Charles Xavier, cause a mania
Causing an outbreak Spreading like bird flu
Spreading like any catchy thing in the world do
Spreading like any little germ that could hurt you
Take it from me our Hip-Hop is a virtue

[Hook]
One, Pacewon
Live from the bricks
(yeah), Mr. Green
Ripping through the mix
One, Pacewon
Live from the bricks
