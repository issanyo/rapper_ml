[Intro]

[Verse 1: Pace Won]
I'mma take you back with a heavenly rhyme
To me in kindergarden back in '79
Back to the essence when hiphop was precious
First I heard rappers delight, then the message
When planet rock dropped I remember it was hectic
The double dutch bus dropped, I bought the record
Made my boys check it, the drum beat was deep
Then came the fat boys and run dmc
UTFO was rappin 'bout a girl
Then roxanne shant√© shook up the world
I remember ladi dadi made me wanna party hardy
We knew every word and we ain't sorry-orry
No sir, the chauffeur, the greensocks
Songs about being late for work had me locked
Weedspots, sittin' by the radio rappin' along
I'd wake up out my sleep to record that song

[Hook: Pace Won]
I remember the tunes, I remember the food
I remember the clothes we were all into
All the little things that inspire a man
Made me who I am, check it out

[Verse 2: Pace Won]
Do the Pee-wee Herman, mostly thugs
Would dance everytime we heard (josky love?)
And latoya latoya bought this boy up
Along with goya and chips ahoy (uh)
5 cent candies, they called 'em jingles
Who didn't have the fewer for the flavor of some pringles?
1 cent big balls bag of cheese-doodles
Too many of 'em used to make me boo-boo
Swedish fish, blow-pops and chick-o-sticks
All before evil chicks and ego-trips
Illegal clips, rolling sacks and stolen gats
Holding packs, getting jacked then owing back
Getting clapped, being better off ownin' that
Being better off broke with your dome intact
Than somewhere rich with a hole, infact
Bullet lodged in right where your colon's at

[Hook: Pace Won]
I remember the tunes, I remember the food
I remember the clothes we were all into
All the little things that inspire a man
Made me who I am, check it out

[Verse 3: Pace Won]
(?) and la tigres, le coqs sportif had shell toe
Sneakers with velcro, kangaroos mark fives
Navy blue puma's I used to shop at (?) square
Heated juniors, clique is out frames
I remember the days with the big stopwatches like flavor flaves (yeah)
Nike cortez, cotler jeans reebok's and guess, helped me rock the scene
It was: main source, epmd, big daddy kane, me skee & zee
I remember (?)
I'd turn the volume up and dance to it
Drinking pina colada's from sunnydale farms
I used to backspin and pop-lock my arms
Style and culture molded the man
Just like some pudding that you hold in your hand

[Hook: Pace Won] (2 times)
I remember the tunes, I remember the food
I remember the clothes we were all into
All the little things that inspire a man
Made me who I am, check it out
