..refrigeration down the hall because t

In the window

[Pacewon]
If you didn't know, now you know, now you see me now you don't
Both hands wrapped around your throat squeezin
Emcees get choked for no reason
The feeling to me is so pleasing
I'm so ahead of the curb I'm like the Predator, breaking down molecular compounds on the regular, and I'm the man around town I'm like a Senator, download my songs on your cellular
I'm great like the jaws on a great white shark, plus I'm sharp as a steak knife
My life's filled with hard work and late nights
But my skills make me shine like some brake lights
And let me say it so you young fools know I beat that ass like Kung fu joe
