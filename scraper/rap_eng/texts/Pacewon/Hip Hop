(Hiphop) was set out in the dark, they used to do it out in the park
Yeah thats a quote from MC Shan without it I'd be an empty man, I said
(Hiphop) was set out in the dark, they used to do it out in the park
Yeah thats a quote from MC Shan without it I'd be an empty, man I said

(Hiphop) is the way we talk you know (hiphop) is the way we walk it's all
(hiphop) it's the clothes the style little brothers see the grill everytime we smile
It's all (hiphop) it's the love the life you know (hiphop) it's the dubs the ice it's all
(hiphop)
On the M.I.C your favorite hardcore rapper in the place to be

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
Yeah, raise the banner, emcees it's time for you to man up
Cock ya hammers, but instead of bustin' off slugs we use grammar
Rappers better dip like Juelz Santana
Cause rappers nowadays are weak, they want glamour
While real emcees got more gifts than Santa
Chillin' like a bat inside the Wayne manor
It ain't fair we get to climb the same ladder
Risin' to the top, I take a look around
And there I see 'em, actin' like a hooker now
They think they gettin' back
But what they don't know is the songs they sellin' wack
If they hustle, I wish they get back to sellin' crack
I wanna pack they CDs up and sell 'em back
I paid 12, just give me 7 back
I'll even take it back to the store and get it wrapped, yo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pacewon]
Your rhymes are weak, I don't mean to insult ya
But you're an embarrasment to the culture
So I don't want you, representin' me
You're not ready mentally, friends with the enemy
But I'm the remedy, quick as a centipede
My own posse like it's freakin' ten o' me
I don't know why these record labels signed him
If being wack was breaking the law you'd be a convict
Locked up behind bars
I throw on my hiking boots and climb charts
All from the skills I got, I stay true to it
You wanna, take hip hop and neuter it
I wanna, take hip hop and tutor it
Update all the rap heads new to it
If I'm lonely, add my freakin' crew to it
Write a jam and all my people move to it
