[Sample]
Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news, everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
What's hood yo?
Let me tell y'all
When the guns blow and the shells fall
And the slugs fly, I'll be well off
Holding a shotgun, busting the hell off
Like soldiers in Iraq
You don't want that
'Cause once you die you don't come back
Brother I'm on point, like a thumb tack
The last thing you'll hear will be a gun clap
You looking for action? Let's get buck
You wanna get hurt? brother just step up
Brother your tough talk doesn't effect us
So just like Rambo you'll get your neck cut
You'll get aired out
You'll get pounded
You'll get your mom's house fully surrounded
By niggas I'm down with
Don't act too hard
Or they might find you dead in the school yard
Be cool god

[Sample]
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 2: Nutso]
One shot, two shots
Now here come the cops
Three neighbors all seniors seen you running down the block
Backdoor open ran to the rooftop
Homicide might even search my damn boom box
Nothing there but batteries
My stash is their salary
Now they tryna hit me with a murder and a battery
Helicopter bird eyes view, dogs they after me
Ran up in apartment 3-B, shorty ask to leave
Only girl to hold me down when I was doing one to three
Had me up in Rikers on the yard rocking Wallabees
And if I get back at the job, I'm doing robberies
Fugitive making sales in hotel lobbies
Stick up kids know me, they won't even rob me
Grew up with their sisters, sold coke to their mommy's
My gang bang [?] can join it like the army
But all you really got to know is Nutso gonna let that gun bust

[Sample]
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 3: Punchline]
My name in this game will rain like monsoons
Thoughts sharp stay on point like harpoons
Cat's screw facing acting like they goons
Until the guns go bang bang like John Witherspoon
They don't really care where the bullets fly next
Just another day living in the projects
Up in the club I see mad bodies dropping
Champagne bottles ain't the only thinking popping
At the funeral, cat's paying you homage
Cops put two in your dome just like knowledge
Nonsense, crazy, shot if you look wrong
Thug on, hope your Sean John come with teflon
Situation is trife, nobody cares
On the rooftops, cat's shooting the air
Mom's at the church now saying a prayer
Cuz every night on the block all she hear is

[Sample]
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 4: F.T.]
This is the era of the digital pranksters
But me I'm an Original Gangster
Known to make hits, classics, unlimited bangers
Shoot bullets but be spitting them razors
We getting this paper
A lot of these niggas is haters
I'm a boss, independent, I'm major
Nigga embrava
My chicks got that cinnamon flavor
On vacays women in Asia, I raised ya
It takes five of your paragraphs combined
To make the kind of sense that I make with one line
I know you like that simple shit, but sometimes
I got to show y'all the reason that son shine
A lot of young niggas is weak with a young mind
I sleep with a 45 and creep with a 09
No secret we gon' rhyme
Baby we gon' shine
And I don't give a fuck as long as I get mine
Niggaaaass!
