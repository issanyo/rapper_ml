(Intro)
This is real life x3 (scratched)

[Verse 1:Pacewon]
The cops are all over
Packin' semi-autos and shotguns like soldiers
Hasslin' the public to reach their little quota
Of how many people should be locked up or wrote up
And brought to a judge
Who in his heart never had real love for a free-spirit or scrub
And who doesn't care if it's parking tickets or drugs
He'll lock you in a cell with car thieves and thugs
Lock you in a cell with stick-up kids and rapists
Crooked CO's in love with bein' racist
It seems now, the only way stay safe is
Remain indoors, out of sight, remain faceless
Tucked in the cut, makin' money off your talent
Life can be a struggle, every day's a challenge
When your gas prices are high causin' a crisis
The more we need, the higher the price rises

[Chorus ]
This is real life, not what should be, or what you feel like
This is real life, a quest for success, you know the deal right?
This is real life, although it's been dark my future's still bright
This is real life, and everything's a struggle to keep the bills tight

[Verse 2:Pacewon]
Shoot first and ask question's afta
Cops use force even when they don't hafta
Faster than you can say "Sean Bell", they blast ya
Lock you inside of a chamber and gas ya
Uncle Sam wants us, to trust in him while he repos our stuff
To go fight for him, strap up and start bustin'
And when you can back from the war you get NOTHIN'
Uncle Sam wants me, to go join the USMC
Then join the USMPs, but all I want's a new fresh M3
To drive around town with the top down, be hot
Until they say that I'm wrong and gotta stop
And profile me like I'm standin' on the block
Bustin' two shots like 2pac at cops

[Chorus]
This is real life, not what should be, or what you feel like
This is real life, a quest for success, you know the deal right?
This is real life, although it's been dark my future's still bright
This is real life, and everything's a struggle to keep the bills tight

[Bridge]
Keep 'em tight, my dude, keep 'em tight
Keep 'em tight, the bills, we keep 'em tight
Keep 'em tight, my dude, keep 'em tight
Keep 'em tight, the bills, we keep 'em tight

[Verse 3:Pacewon]
In the streets there is no peace
We got innocent men runnin' from police
We got innocent people just wastin' away
When they could eat off what Wall Street makes in a DAY
We got kids havin' kids, corporate crooks
Junk bonds and dummy companies of corporate jerks
Wing Tips, business suits, corporate looks
And social brackets where the real people all get put
And mad drugs on the Ave so we all get high
You gotta be like Kanye if you wanna get by
Or even stick somebody up if you wanna get fly
You'll have to put a bullet in me if you wanna get mine though

[Outro]
This is real life, not what should be or what you feel like
This is real life, a quest for success, you know the deal right?
This is real life, although it's been dark my future's still bright
This is real life, (scratched) real life....
