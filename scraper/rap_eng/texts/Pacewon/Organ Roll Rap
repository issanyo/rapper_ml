[Verse 1:  Starang Wondah]
I'm so hood, you don't wanna make me mad
And shit's so good, niggas say I'm breaking bad
My whole (?) legs with an incredible walk
And I believe her, cuz she got that credible talk
We no joke, smoke an incredible bulk
Her ass make me wanna smash like Incredible Hulk
It's them again, nah yo, it's him again
4, 5, 6, I roll, I win again
Her outfits here, that means we in again
I live, I die, I live again
And to y'all who don't put this shit out, it's Duck Down
I only rep one hood, nigga it's Bucktown
