Yeah! My life's an open book
To get here, to this point
You can't imagine what it took
The courage and the struggle
And the fear of being shook
?
It seem like I was running
From the obstacles they put
In front of me
But I was moving forward like a rook
And never looking back
?
Just beacause the past is like a vault
You can't escape it
And it hurts because it was your fault
The choices that you made
?
You chose to run
But you've got to crawl before you walk
You see it takes mistakes to put ? to a ?
You learn from 'em so you won't make 'em anymore
Mistakes are like a ?
They can ? on every door
You need them for the ?
To be connected to the ?
We need mistakes to achieve the visions that we saw

Recently developed ways of life have me ?
Now thinkin about the days of my people picking ?
And forced to be ?

Fact that people hissed and might not view me as an equal
Kinda ? can really be so evil
The people might get even by picking up a pistol
? clearer than the crysta
Expressing what they feeling by balling up a fist
And being violent just to make sure you get the gist
Being violent so the people know just what it is
Violent for the sake and make ? you don't miss
See if I start the war we have to talk the former treaty
But if I acted peacefully, people won't believe me
? simple overlooking ?
But when a person screams overlooking ain't so easy
?

I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
