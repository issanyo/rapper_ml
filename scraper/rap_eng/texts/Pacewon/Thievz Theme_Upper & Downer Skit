Yo.. yo..
You see bein this Outsidah that I am, huh
We be havin the representin type theme (.. the Thievz Theme)
KnowahtI'msayin? I be retreivin equipment
From all type people (.. the Thievz Theme)
Consider it boosting
Yo, yo-yo, yo
Niggas like me sting kingpins for ki's
Pacewon, I made a theme for the thieves
The shifty two-sixty bench child with foul comments
GOT DEEP POCKETS, and +Sticky Fingaz+ like Onyx
If I see a crew sleepin on they coiner
With funds I'ma stick 'em and run like Jackie Joyner-
-KERSEE, all New Jersey heads know that Pace be
A SNEAKY STAR, stealin VCR's out of Macy's
Takes we, eight-speed bikes, loaded rifles
I roll with pyshcoes, that make noise like motorcycles
My crew's sick, on some real shit
You leave your wallet just layin around and I'ma steal it
Easy as that, I kill the crap, word is bond
I gaffle your jewels, and break moves to the pawn shop
When dough low a nigga gotta start juicin
So I made a blend for the men that be boostin
(The Thievz Theme..) "A full-fledged thief"
(The Thievz Theme..) "Always have beef"
Aiyyo, I'm the number one crook on the streets
(The Thievz Theme..) "A full-fledged thief"
Yo I boost like kleptos
Steal more than a college have step shows
Don't get close to the ruler, eatin crews up
Stealin all types of new stuff, the definition of a booster
One who robs shit the dopest
Can stick items in his pockets without bein noticed
The nigga flex like aerobics, check it
Pace got a shopliftin record
I'll rob you in a second, cash and clothes, bathrobes
What? I have to roll on assholes
Give me jewels, silverware, and the keys to your cars and
I won't draw down and fire like arson
When dough low a nigga gotta start juicin
Sing like Whitney Houston for my niggas that be boostin
(The Thievz Theme..) "A full-fledged thief"
(The Thievz Theme..) "Always have beef"
Aiyyo, yo yo yo, yeah I'm the number one crook on the streets
(The Thievz Theme..) "A full-fledged thief"
Aiyyo, I'm the number one crook on the streets
(The Thievz Theme..) "A full-fledged thief"
Aiyyo, yo
Pacewon the biggest, the overload punkin niggas
Fingers, adhesive like stickers
Heat and simmer, cook dinner in a hot plate
Those who got weight, Pace'll stick like scotch tape
Use a gun, king thief Ali Baba
Complex like data, cowboy with a dagger
On a quest to get G's (G's)
Singin the theme of the thieves
(The Thievz Theme..) "A full-fledged thief"
(The Thievz Theme..) "Always have beef"
Aiyyo, I'm the number one crook on the streets
(The Thievz Theme..) A FULL FLEDGED THIEF
(The Thievz Theme..) "A full-fledged thief"
(The Thievz Theme..) "Always have beef"
Aiyyo, I'm the number one crook on the streets
(The Thievz Theme..) A FULL FLEDGED THIEF
