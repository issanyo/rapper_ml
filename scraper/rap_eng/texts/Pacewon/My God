[Verse 1: Pacewon]

It was all a dream
Faith and BIG up in the limousine
Back then Wu-Tang had Dropped C.R.E.A.M
The Source Magazine was Vital
I remember back then it was like the Hip Hop Bible
Nas got 5 mics so did Brand Nubian, Tribe Called Quest, Rakim, Ice Cube and them
And De La Soul had a graceful flow they sampled Hall & Oats and made Say No Go
These memories are a thing of the past but I remember RedMan got a four and a half
Masta Ace got a three and a half, I start spazzing
I always thought his "Slaughtahouse" album was a classic
Just like Das EFX album, it was blasting
Out every jeep and car that drove passing
Onyx first album was purely engenius
Your girl sucking on a next brother's penis

[Hook]
I remember, it was hard
Times when my father didn't have a job
But music was still right there making me nod
So I reminisce over you, my god
I remember, it was hard
Times when my father didn't have a job
But music was still right there making me nod
So I reminisce over you, my god

[Verse 2: Pacewon]

Adina Howard, S-W-V
If you don't know, ask the next brother you see
Sisters With Voices, the other one is a freak
If you're my age and you don't know
Then you're a geek
Tha Liks was drunk off O.E
I was pumping Prince Po, Pharoahe Monch and O.C
And Common Sense, before his goatee
Just Ice, Nice & Smooth and Easy Mo Bee
Jazzy Joyce, Sweet Tee and Special Ed
When they play, "I Got It Made"
I can't keep a level head
The Bricks will keep rocking
Yes, yes, we'll keep rocking it
If you don't know what it is
Put a sock in it
B-Boys, working it out
But pop locking it
Dropping it, the culture lives on
There's no stopping it
Even when we pass on
They'll keep copping it
Even when they start to charge more
They'll keep swapping it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pacewon]

2011, Pacewon jumps up on the scene
With his team and his partner, Mr. Green
Even caramel sundaes are getting touched
Scooped in my ice cream truck
I was a fiend before I became a teen
I worked this flow
Now I'm a pro just like Kurtis Blow
And Mr. Green is like the Grandmaster, Flash
You never seen no hands faster
He reminds me of the Grand Wizzard, Theodore
French vanilla chicks say "mi amore"
We are more like Busta mixed with the Arsonists
Mixed with the Ra, Cash Money & Marvelous
Mixed with Run, The Jungle Brothers
And mixed with a little Public Enemy and Souls of Mischief
A little Lords of Underground, Pun, in my mind
I used to turn back in the days way up in my ride

[Hook]
