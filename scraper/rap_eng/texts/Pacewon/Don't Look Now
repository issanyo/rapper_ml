[Pace Won]
Slap y'all hacksaw ask me what you rap for
Run up in your crib with a hacksaw (BANG)
Tired of cops, I put your life in a box
Before I tie up your pops and let him HANG
Yo, as far as this go, I'm like the mummy
Exploiting the ancient Egypt science of life and math for money
The Godfather flow I'm like Sonny
The number one thief; Mr. Wild Out like KEITH MURRAY!

[Young Zee]
Yea
When I'm drunk, puffin canibus skunk
I start shit with ya, beat ya manager up
Then battle every one of y'all that're rattlesnakes
It's like I haven't ate, and your clique smell like carrot cake
?Place lead in chicken's head? give up cookies
Then pass the fuck out like piss in bitches' pussies
The Capricorn, my dick be lastin long
Fuck raw first, GET THE RUBBER SLAP IT ON!
So girls I'm scoping you, who could hold me closest
Curve your back like multiple scoliosis
Fellas' beef, only start if you whiffin
I turn your chest into barbecue chicken

Chorus
[Pace Won]
Don't look now, we top billing it, filling it
My raps, my life, my style, my crew, we killing it
Money in the head we ice grilling it, stealing it
Your raps, your life, your style, your crew, we killing it

[Pace Won]
I drink too much liquor, got a bad liver
Streets is watching me like I'm Jigga; STARING
Chew your crew up like they was spearmint
Kick a verse, people go crazy when they hear it (HYUH!)
First I had no deal, now I'm living lovelier
Cause I'm on Columbia, spending all they money up
I got that hurry up, quick quick
Bust raw style in the pussy, like when me and my honey fuck
*Pacer, Pacer, don't make me chase ya with a razor
Blow up like Michael Jordan pager!*
It ain't a thing thing thing
*First week I'm goin gold!*
That's that ring ring ring
*Just like De La Soul?!*
No matter what the job, I hit the task faster
Educate and teach y'all like the Blastmaster
And from the vision Heaven sending me
I can see myself on the cover of Ebony
The cover of XXL, the cover of Fresh
The cover of the Source, and the cover of Stress
Pace Won, lace buds, smoke with Gov-G
Or tour around the world with my man Young Zee

[Azz-Iz]
Left bolt, bust off, see me hit the deck first
It's like my tech's curse, you be giving me expert
You know the difference, Az the type to go the distance
And you ain't, so we can't have this coexistence
Yo it's only rich, ain't no getting poor
Dough is what I'm on a misison itching for
For the love of this I get the four kicking door
Leave a fella's bra twitching saw him on the kitchen floor
Most of y'all sound retarded to me
I'm the hottest shit, since that nigga Moses, parted the sea
And y'all can keep hating when I'm the one you like
Weed got my eyes squinting like the sun too bright

[Pace Won]
YO!
