[Hook]
I wake up to a drink and a blunt in a tray
I make, what you make per month in a day
That's because I always got a little Something to Say
Just because I always got a little Something to Say
I said
I wake up to a drink and blunt in a tray
I make, what you make per month in a day
That's because I always got a little Something to Say
Just because I always got a little Something to Say

[Verse 1 - Pacewon]
Yeah, I started off good and ended bad
Got a bill that I thought was a check and sent it back
Was a bully on the mic before they invented crack
Before my dude Kool Herc invented rap
Now I'm here wrapping like Masons on Christmas
Iller than your body being covered in blisters
And you know I only do this for my brothers and sisters
Cross the land with my jam pumping out of they systems
Solo on the mic, I don't need no assistance
But I run with my team like I play for the Pistons
I'm the P to the A to the C-E-Won
Walk in the bank, and rob you with the BB gun
Then stroll on out with two bags of money
Like Ellen DeGeneres, you fags are funny
Dummies, homies don't got no fame
Tripping like Snoop Dogg, worse than Soul Plane

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Pacewon]
Yeah, when it comes to guns, I do bang
Puffing on that sherm stick, talking that new slang
Representing Jersey and the World Five Two gang
Hanging on the avenue, deep as the Wu-Tang
Not afraid of cops, selling lots of blue tops
Stash in the crib, a couple stacks in a shoe box
Underneath the Ford, pannel, mags and oo-ops
I'm armed, my life seems harder than 2Pac's
I sleep very little, gat up under my pillow
My wife thinking any day she could be a widow
It's like God and the Devil playing monkey in the middle
I'm the monkey, way less hairy but more brittle
Life is like a riddle and I'm trying to solve it
Like I graduated from Harvard, I'm a smart kid
Eating like it's Thanksgiving, I ain't into starving
So if there's any problem, a .38 revolver

[Bridge 2x]
One, and in comes the two to the three
(Ain't none of y'all better than) ME!
See I suggest you go back where you came from
(Pacewon!)
Come on, don't play, son!

[Outro]
Yeah!
