[Verse 1]
I started out hardcore, spinnin' on cardboard
Run up with a TEC-9, open your car door
Muy caliente, selling weed around my friend
When breaking bread with Diesel Don and El Da Sensei
And now I'm back to smackin' you, rapping till capital's made
Gat's in your face, cop killer strapped to the waist
Easy, goofy, catch a doozy for being a groupie
I got the Uzi that you only might see in the movie
Truly greedy, grimy, shifty, I'm witty, I'm silly
Really sheisty, but I'm chilly as Philly, you tiny
Mini minor, Mr. T, I'mma pity the rhymer
On call like Sean Paul just give me the lighter
Pass the dro, mastered flow I carry on
With AK's and cherry bombs, shittin' on every song
I get on, the Billy Idol of rap
Talk shit, I'll lay you down right on your back
Little brother..

[Hook]
I'm getting good, I'm getting clever
I'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better
I'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar
The girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter

[Hook]
I'm getting good, I'm getting clever
I'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better
I'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar
The girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter

[Verse 2]
Mmm-hmm
Splish splash, I was takin' a bath
Then I hopped out the shower, snatched up my doo rag
Started flipping through my stash, got cash in two bags
Then I hopped in the 5-2-8 with new mags
Spinned out like a Nascar race, putting my thing down
Proud like Return of the King, Lord of the Rings now
Fly like a '68 'llac with chrome spokes
Straight talkin' that hip-hop slang to grown folks
Like word? Oh really, no doubt, no diggity
Spittin that East Coast straight talk so wickedly
Authentic b-boy hip-hop, no trickery
That's why my 16 bar scheme so slippery
Fuck at least one broad a day
And like Chingy, I'm only one call away
So if you're tired of the norm and you want more tricks
Dial 373-2146
And I'm there..

[Hook]
I'm getting good, I'm getting clever
I'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better
I'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar
The girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter

[Hook]
I'm getting good, I'm getting clever
I'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better
I'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar
The girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter

[Bridge]
Say it with me
I'mma just push and push until I get it
I'mma just push and push until I get it
I'mma just push and push until I get it
Suicide doors, G4's, and good credit

[Bridge]
Say it with me
I'mma just push and push until I get it
I'mma just push and push until I get it
I'mma just push and push until I get it
Suicide doors, G4's, and good credit

[Verse 3]
Before I pull up and park and bust in your apartment
I'mma just perm my hair like Al Sharpton
And get a picket sign just to protest your flow next
Your little pussy rhymes need Kotex
There's mad little tricks hittin' up in my sleeve
Don't be naive I'll have you screamin' out "Why me?"
You soft motherfuckers come a dozen a dime
I'll fuck you up and walk off like it wasn't a crime
Stick my gun where the sun don't shine
Have you fuckin' a nine
Have sodomy stuck in your mind
You'll probably want revenge
Sneak up on me, stick a knife in my back
Take naked pictures of my body like they did in Iraq
And then, wake up sweaty in a puddle of piss
I'll fuckin', bust your shit, call your brother a bitch
And then leave you where I met you brother, holdin' your mouth
Holdin' your jaw in awe, nigga, over and out

[Hook]
I'm getting good, I'm getting clever
I'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better
I'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar
The girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter

[Hook]
I'm getting good, I'm getting clever
I'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better
I'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar
The girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter
