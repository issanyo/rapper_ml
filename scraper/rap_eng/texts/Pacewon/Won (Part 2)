This is a story, of a man
Unlike any other man, for this man is the.. WON!

[Break: repeat 4X]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo (WON!) (Pacewon..)

[Pacewon]
All across the world from the UK to Canada
Never have you seen a rapper of this calibre
Rock the microphone with energy and stamina
Brother so nice you could spell it out in algebra
P-Won MC = 10 of y'all squared
A hundred rappers scared I'll put dent in y'all beard
Grab you by the neck, stick a pen in y'all hear
That's what your label get for sendin y'all here
Why fight when you know you can't win?
You climbin up the ladder but I'm the champion
And these some awfully big shoes for dudes to stand in
Despite who you know or where you campin
You see, what y'all flip and make on the first
I trick off on broads, take home ya Earth
Fuck with a creole girl, take home the curse
Leave out the hospital, take home the nurse

[Hook: Pacewon]
All these lil' jokers wanna play my game
But I'm boss here, say my name (PACEWON)
See I'm comin with the rhyme, my crew mad deep
I declare war, who that be? (PACEWON)
All these thick-ass pretty women checkin me out
"Say My Name" like Destiny's Child (PACEWON)
Just speakers in the car baby no backseat
Hear the bass kick, yo that's me (PACEWON) c'mon

I'm way out of this world, superspectacular
I'm the O.G. that bit Dracula
Make a slick kid mackadocious
Stay away from young girls, I crack a ol' bitch
Wifebeater, like Ike Turner
Carry five heaters and like 9 burners
Your homegirl like it, 14 guns
The more heat I bring, the more she cums
Debonaire, never fear
Mad tipsy off Grand mixed with Everclear
I got a, QB of 'dro and like 60 bucks
Parked my whip, a limo driver picked me up and
I jump in and smokin Hawaiian
Watchin "Late Night with Conan O'Brien"
Hit the studio your homegirl meet me
Deeply entranced by my CD, easy

You can see it my aura
I'm happy as a lil' kid playin Pop Warner
And it's all thanks to my pops and {Ipora?}
I'm a performer not standin on the corner
Made my house warmer than a sauna or jacuzzi
Flew me to Italy
P.E. #1, I'm the epitome
I, dribble a riddle, hit a kid with a fiddle and
Wiggle a lil' with my dick in the middle
Just pull up in the alley with 10's on the chariot
Got a 9-M-M and I do carry it
Rock hell's bells, smoke weed, sell shells
Cool as LL, well well
See me like 6 tours later, superfresh nigga
Best lookin girl in the club, I left with her
Shocked the fuck out, yeah we all are
We ain't wannabe b-ball stars this is rap music
