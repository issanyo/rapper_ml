[Verse 1:  Pacewon]

I'm the truth
Like Wonder Woman, tie me with a golden lariat
I'm Jesus, you're a Judas Iscariot
But this time in now you want a verse, there's a variant
Cause this time I'm gonna drop the cross and make you motherfuckers carry it
Get down on one knee and ask to marry it
Count each time it says, "No retaliate"
And I'll be in the Caddy with [?] and Dirty Harriet
So high I feel like I'm being pulled by thirty chariots

I can't explain the frame of mind that I am in
But I feel rejuvenated like I took a vitamin
Now let's fill what I am in, I'm seeing all these images
[?] limitless
Every Emcee needs to mimic this
And keep it pushing like cartels and syndicates
I don't know what has gotten into kids
They must be smoking to much indica

I'm here to heal them like the Book of Leviticus
Sorry that I'm blade, I was in the cut
I write a letter to the hood and seal it with a kiss
Take a picture of the hood and pin it up
I'm attached to it
Like a puppet
And the string I'm hung from; I can't cut it
So each and every time you hear my fuckin' song pump it
And don't act like an ass with a stick stuck up it, motherfucker

[Chorus]

Make no mistake, for real
I wouldn't hesitate to kill
(family, killin' all these weak rappers)

Make no mistake, for real
I wouldn't hesitate to kill
(family, killin')
You mothafuckin' bitches

Make no mistake, for real
I wouldn't hesitate to kill
(Weak rappers steady makin' hits, fuck that)

Make no mistake, for real
I wouldn't hesitate to kill
(Weak rapper, yo fuck that)

[Verse 2:  Cy Marshall Law]

I come
Hot in the game
Ya'll Rockin' the same
Channel, the spirits of Roc and McCain
Start cockin' the flame
Like cool[?] You gonna' be chalkin' the name
Don't be surprised when I rocket to fame
I got hip-hop in my vein
I'm super sane cyclone
On the mic' device
You would think there was a Cy clone
But twice as nice
I got friends to hold the toasta'
When I go to unholsta'
They shoot bullets that fly from here to Nova Scotia

The flow is dope
When I'm done I'll have them throw it to Nova
Skin is the color of Coke-a-Cola
Rock the coast, talking head
God know even ghosts walk through walls to hear my flow
[?] illin' now
With that killin' style that's longer than the river Nile
Consider how old these emcees [?]
Fly from thirst (Jerz) to Hungry
Humbly I can't fuck with me

I stay sucker free
You coming out but I'm going in
And trying to put me in a box is a vote to win
The inner tornado
I'm as calm as the Dalai Lama
I know it's not the ganja
I know that God is my body armor
I ain't American Pharaoh but the nigga sounds
Every verse is triple crown when I rip it down
I'm either for or against you
Fuck a middle a ground

Even in my own house party-in
Kid I don't play around

[Chorus]

Make no mistake, for real
I wouldn't hesitate to kill
(family, killin' all these weak rappers)

Make no mistake, for real
I wouldn't hesitate to kill
(family, killin')
You mothafuckin' bitches

Make no mistake, for real
I wouldn't hesitate to kill
(Weak rappers steady makin' hits, fuck that)

Make no mistake, for real
I wouldn't hesitate to kill
(Weak rapper, yo fuck that)

[Outro]

Step up and test the skills
You can get my testicles
