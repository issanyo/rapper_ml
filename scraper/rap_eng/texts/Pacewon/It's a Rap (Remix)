[Pacewon]
Me and TJ Muham' like Eric B. & Rakim
Girls watchin me like white people watch "Friends"
Every show you see me in, premium helium
Accent my medium b-boy ingredients
I sell the track then stack it away
Still crackin like back in the day
Have you holdin both arms up like twelve o'clock
With two guns, 16 shells a pop
Runnin game, call me Earl the Pearl
Put her on, turn her out, show your girl the world
I'm thorough - God made in July in nine-five
My crew throw slugs in the clip and driveby
Snatch your little chain and step off like my my
The price of this ice these days is sky high
You can't bring the drama I can so why try
You need to go chill the {fuck} out like Fly Ty

[Hook: LongShot]
It's a rap, {nigga} ain't no fussin with that
PaceWon, LongShot, ain't no {fuckin} with that
(Let's go!) From the Bricks to Cali and back
To the Illa' where real spitters buck at your cap
(Let's flow!) {Nigga} ain't no fussin with that
PaceWon, LongShot, ain't no {fuckin} with that
(Let's go!) From the Bricks to Cali and back
To the Illa' where real spitters buck at your cap

[LongShot]
Real {niggas} start {shit}, bust shots up at your coffin
Catch me knee deep in the weed wheezin and coughin
Deez leave earth in a hearse, screamin and barkin
While the rest of my life likely, dangerous talkin
Every other rapper I've battled aimlessly talkin
So step the {fuck} off cause you soft like chicken squawkin
{*bawk*} I spit to make the cypher look exhausted
Crossin {hell} against me, I leave your meat beaten and darkened
Turn the V up, now the verbals blaze your mind
Blame the rhymes on the fact I ain't got {shit} but flamin rhymes
I flip the diction for these half spitters
Wishin they could spit it like this, picture that ridiculous
When I spit it like this, I make your skin bubble over
Punch you in your chest 'til your shoulders sag right
Half-sober, tryin to get over a relationship
Bein broke got me wonderin - is God on some racist {shit}?
