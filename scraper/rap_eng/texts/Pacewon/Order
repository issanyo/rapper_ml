[Verse One:  Mic Rippa]

Brothers be knowing that I like this sport
Niggas get dropped in thought
Skinny jeans, these faggots be saggin' in their boxing shorts
They already know that most you niggas is remedial
They used to be like, "Think like Mike."
Just do whatever he would do
Fighting is a crime
Some niggas do it like it's seasonal
My shit be off the rocker
I be giving ya'll a reason to
Yo Rippa's that dude in real life
And yeah I kinow its nice to be hard but look its hard to be nice
Just name the price, I ain't even gonna backtalk to you
That's money in the bank, I heard your shit, you pack awful
But somebody got to talk to you like your trash is possible
When you get bagged, his ass responsible
Period
Shit will get ugly, it will get bloody, period
And now you all inferior and it wasn't that serious
My material is hazardous
And you, you're whole pattern is nothing but an embarrassment
You should hire a strategist
You tacky
I mean what could you do to get through, past me?
Attack me?
My crew will pull up in a blue taxi
Ya'll just doing demos, getting [?]
I'm like a demolition team
I'm getting paid for beating up the booth
You hated in the bricks
I know you mad, but
When you pull out your pad you full of air like a bag of potato chips
Or get ate like nine
Going line for line with me
You better take your time
When you make them rhymes
Before I brake your spine
Snatch your nickel bag and tell you, 'Make me dime'
You'd think I did some time for Diddy just the way we shine
Looking for at least a milli before I say, 'We'll sign'
Or make up my mind
I rip straight lines
You hungry for your chic to be a ten but she a six
That's what, seven, eight, nine
Let me reiterate on my eleven-state crime
I levitate spines
That don't ever take time
You say you got it locked, but stop
That is not the case
You say you used to run up in the spot with a stocking on your face
Over on your block just to pop the safe
But when you got knocked I was shocked
You cooperate
That's why I'm mad when I'm hearing trash ya'll write
I done slayed cats in the past that ya'll like
Getting cash but that don't mean that I laugh at ya'll life
But ya'll niggas ass like that show Basketball Wives
There's nothing that can catch
But listen I don't really need attention
I just like taking a tissue from your ass

[Verse Two:  Pacewon]

I've got the powers of Stephen Strange
My raps seem magical
It's the rap radical
Back from sabbatical
Riding through the capital
Drunk, holding the calico
The best player out on the court
I'm Earl Manigault
Larger than you might think, my nigga
My attack is tactical
To have fans chasing after dude
If they catch up I hope they act rational
Or I'm gonna be on national
News cause I blast a dude
Somebody's [?] a windshield and crashed into
The back of a van, hit a can and I slammed into
The front of car that was carrying Samuel Jackson
And that dude that played Hannibal's animals
[?] I'm so hot I give off fumes
When I walk in the door, I'm the elephant in the room
And tunes, I just shit on them just like I'm eating prunes
While I'm sitting on a pile of records howling at the moon
And I'm fly as a witch while she's sitting on a broom
Been hot as June since I was in the womb
I'll throw salt on your wound
Like Dee-Bo I'm a goon
All brawn, no brain, I eat spaghetti with a spoon
And I can see it now, my name in lights, "Coming Soon"
So official [?] at noon
And I'm Shady motherfucker like Slim eating shrooms
Rap is like a pretty, young bride and I'm the groom
Motherfucker

[Verse Three: Milkbone]

Yo, yo
[?]
Grease is meat sauces
Meet me on the corner
We can speak in the office
Scarface
Walk in the wedding with bleached Dockers
Rich dudes looking at cash for boss dudes
I know broke kids picking up stash from bar stools
Come on bro, I been around the block after [?]
Spin around clocks for half the price, sacrifice
Milk B, no flashy ice
Stash the vice
Parasites want to marry me, better ask me nice
Milk laughs at life and he throws [?] at [?]
Am I doing the right thing?
I even asked the pastor twice
He spoke through his peephole, said I'm a deep soul
The weak don't grow, you need to speak what you know
You sleep for one second, you could dream it all away
I don't speak more than you, I just mean what I say
Yo and look ma'
I like to cook ma'
I'm never shook ma'
I'm hungry, why let me look at your bra?
Born, bred in the streets of Jerz' beef's occurred
I'm the host with the most coast, the east, it's the merge
I get in where I fit in
Everybody finga' lickin' stickin' dick up in a chicken go to prison for spitten' what they ain't livin'
They just hippin' [?] what they driven'
I don't know I'm just the Alamo
Give these hitters a ribbon
I been through the storm I got rolled and drove in it
Ice-cold weather permittin' umbrellas with holes in it
No disc-jockey hockey, there's got to be goals in it
You go to sleep for one minute, and you dream it all away
I don't speak more than you, I just mean what I say
Bro
