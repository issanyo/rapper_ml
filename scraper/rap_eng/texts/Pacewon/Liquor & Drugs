[Intro]
Yeah
18 to party, 21 to drink
Lets go Green

[Hook]
Here we go
We got the L-I-Q-U-O-R
Patrón’s about the best that I’ve tasted so far
Then we got the D-R-U-G-S
I think ecstasy and marijuana suit me best
(x2)

Here we go

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I’m talking ‘bout drugs, I’m talking ‘bout liquor
Which one will get me high quicker?
Which one will keep me high longer?
Stronger than a beast that could beat King Kong, I’m
So strong I start grinding my teeth in
My eyes look like they’re about to start bleeding
In my tummy is a real warm feelin’
Of coolest Fred Astaire like we’re dancing on the ceilin’
Smoke these blunts ‘till my lips get the peelin’
Better dope that you can get in New Zealand
Better dope than the cannabis cup got
So strong I start to speak Spanish and what not
Hit the cardboard back spin and up rock
Singing hold it down by 9th & Buckshot
It makes me want to give Anita Baker a hug
It feels like I’m caught up in the rapture of love

[Hook]
Here we go
We got the L-I-Q-U-O-R
Patrón’s about the best that I’ve tasted so far
Then we got the D-R-U-G-S
I think ecstasy and marijuana suit me best
(x2)

Here we go

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Where’s the bourbon, where’s the Ripple at
Roll a blunt, I just dumped a triple stack
Can you get with that, I take E’s yo
‘Till I look cross eyed just like Deebo
Sipping on Guinness playing 'Scene it?' with my peoples
Happy as Paul McCartney singing with the beetles
Not viewing life through the eye of a needle
Or keyhole or smoking weed rappers think that we all
Butt it at the tip then blow it
All the safeguards you put up will get lowered
All the little fronts you put up will get pounded
‘Till you can’t stand fronting or to be around it
All the little hate that you have will be abolished
Knowledge make it lost but you’ll be hella polished
There’s no joy like when you’re real inebriated
That’s the reason half the nation’s getting faded

[Hook]
Here we go
We got the L-I-Q-U-O-R
Patrón’s about the best that I’ve tasted so far
Then we got the D-R-U-G-S
I think ecstasy and marijuana suit me best
(x2)

Here we go

[Verse 3]
Can I name all the drugs? Well let’s see
I’ve tried acid, LSD
PCP, mescaline and even some shrooms
Speed and sizzurp, I’ve tried that too
But I’ve never sniffed a line of coke
‘Cause I always thought I’d like it then I’d go broke
And I’ve never tried heroin, p-dope or diesel
I’d have to bang it and I don’t like needles
You see bang it means inject it, drugs been selected
I’d be too high to rob stores or set trip
I’d rather have a shorty with a body and wet lips
When I’m drunk I’m the perfect guy to get with
When I’m high you might see defensiveness
Sometimes I get spaced out and sensitive
It depends on the mixtures I choose
And the chemicals involved in the drugs that I use

[Hook]
Here we go
We got the L-I-Q-U-O-R
Patrón’s about the best that I’ve tasted so far
Then we got the D-R-U-G-S
I think ecstasy and marijuana suit me best
