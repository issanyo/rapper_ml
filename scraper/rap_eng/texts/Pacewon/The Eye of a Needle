[Verse 1: Pacewon]
Cold days, Long John, snorkel
Eyes scoping all new heads that walk through
Stick-up kids, narcs and them auto squad Newark dudes
Customers and new chicks to talk to
Money in my pocket, the hustler's love
You can't knock it, first the re-up, then the profit
Next is me shopping for a cute new droptop to hop in
Candy apple, let's get it popping
Or maybe it's midnight blue, let's get it cracking
Bathing Ape fashion, mall-to-mall dashing
Chick to chick skipping, tricking
Eight thousand dollars on champagne, sickening
Eyes pop right out the sockets, locked on what I'm dipped in
Like I'm the Highlander and this is the quickening
Sporty like the Thievz, I got Pigeons
Like Milk and Giz I'm Top Billin'

It's been a long time coming, I've seen a lot of evil
Felt a lot of pain and I lost a lot of people
Did a couple things that I really didn't need to
Hurt a couple people that I really didn't mean to
If I could turn time back I would treat 'em regal
Matter of fact, I'd treat everybody equal
Then my world might just be so peaceful
And I wouldn't view it through The Eye of a Needle

[Verse 2: Pacewon]
Chancellor and Union like Crenshaw and Slauson
There's more Bloods here than Red Sox in Boston
One came through with a semi-auto, flossing
My boys didn't hesitate to let one run across him
Now he know but look what it almost cost him
His moms, grandma and his friends almost lost him
We had him running more fast than Steve Austin
He didn't wanna do it, somebody prolly forced him
I hope he told that somebody that I'm awesome
The .380 stay in the whip as a precaution
A nine-m stay in my grip for any horsin
Around, in a showdown, clown, I'm taking yours, son
A little quote from Kane, Big Daddy
I walk up and down the block with six baggies
Looking for the customers headed to me
I hope I won't have to leave a brother dead in the street
You know

[Verse 3: Pacewon]
My life is like a sitcom
With Mac-10s and Uzis getting gripped on
Little teenage bitches getting they strip on
By the day, by night getting they trick on
Little teenage niggas getting they flip on
Long tee hidin which gat the hip on
Which hip the gat on, each beat I rap on
Just another platform for me to yap on
Peepee and crap on, repeat and slap on
Freak-leak and mack on, sneak, peek and snack on
See me get back on beef, speak and snap on
Mr. Green made 'em, just for me to crack on
To explain how I used to get my jack on
And how I've changed to where you hear it in my rap song
Extend my hand and get my dap on
Do like Martin Luther King and get my black on
