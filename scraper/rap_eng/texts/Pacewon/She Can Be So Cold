[Hook]
So what, somebody left you in a rut
And wants to be the one who's in control
But the feeling that you're under
Can really make you wonder how the hell she can be so cold
So what, somebody left you in a rut

[ Verse 1: PaceWon ]
I once met a chick
Cute face, small waist, legs kind of thick
I pushed up on her quick
Checked for a ring
Seein she's a queen and she probably got a king
He probably do his thing
But she said that she didn't
She asked did I have a girl, and I was like "Eh eh
Nah ma, you kiddin?
If I did have a girl I would be true
Standing by her side, not here talking to you"
Then she said I was sleeping
She said "mad dudes out here claim the same damn thing but keep creeping"
I said "Not me though!
I'm so sick of sad love songs, I'm like Ne-Yo
Looking for a Leo
And if you not a Leo, then don't be a meano
My heart is like a lock, and you've got the key, yo
You see, through my life, I've shut many doors"
I asked for her number and she said "Give me yours"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: PaceWon]
I gave it to her, one day she called
She sounded nonchalant like she might've been bored
Then she asked what it was
Was I busy? Did I want to get a slush from Dairy Queen, or what?
Or what? No big thing, I said yeah
Within a half hour, little shorty wop was there
Lookin like mirror mirror, who's the fair
-est one of all with her long ass hair
So I jumped in her ride
Happy like all the children on my mother's side
Cramped with butterflies
But otherwise I was just chillin like champagne
We went and had drinks, curry chicken, and plantain
And even under the spell that I was under
I wondered why she always called me from a blocked number
And just when I thought that props was all due
When I asked for her math she said "I'll call you"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: PaceWon]
Okay now, I've been seeing mami off and on for months
She said she's got a crib but I ain't been there once
And I think I really like her but I feel like a dunce
Because she still blocks her number when she calls me at lunch
I can't call her when I want, it's making me blue
Cause now I'm starting to think that she lives with a dude
But each and every time I ask her is she seeing a boy
She starts fluttering her eyes, and being so coy
Her little ploy to be evasive keeps making me annoyed
I feel like my ego is being destroyed
When I ask her for her number, she buckles her lips
When I ask her where she lives, she blows me a kiss
Then she glances at her wrist
I'm feeling like this:
Is she stupid? What's really good with this chick?
"Delete my number out your cellphone, we couldn't be througher"
Months of dating and I never really knew her
