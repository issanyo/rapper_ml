And so the end begins
As thunder rumbles in
Odds are stacked against us
Fat chances now seem slim

Get along
Get acquainted
Get along
Demonstrate it
Get along
Get creative
Get along

And so the deep ends
As day breaks swaggers in
Stagerring with no desire
I lose to watch you win

Get along
Get acquainted
Get along
Demonstrate it
Wooh... I'd give my life to win some love from you

Yo'
I'm Pace Won the gapper
Blast past the rapper
Laugh at your master
Snatch bags and smack ya
Rough songs AOP ass cap and afta
Add mass I'll grab ya
Fast as ya blasta
Can't match the bastards
Stand back ya haveta
Rap times are crackin
Randsack your asthma
Ladies trends
Mercedes Benz
Shady friends
Lady's bend backwards

Get along
Get along

Get along
Get acquainted
Get along
Demonstrate it
Wouh... I'd give my life to win some love from you
