[Verse 1: Blu]
Yours truly
A cutie with no brains, a booty
The Lovebug Starski tape with the dookie
I took her to the drive in movies with the toolie
Yeah, in case she tried to do me
It was hot as July without Julie
Just true newbies in the back, twist the loose leaf
The system hittin' bitches in Jacuzzi's
Said it wouldn't be Cali without the Uzis
Bet, slide through, the in-and-out drive-thru
With the 2 Live Crew
The fly chicks I knew she knew me
She said I liked you in high school, she blew me
I bought her an iced tea with ice cubes
Word up
We was 'bout to go to work, but we murked to the jam
And all the girls threw their shirts up
It's summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2: Bombay]
The dope touch like Magic, static get stuck
Cool cat must of spit lead, lyrics is buck
Smash through your speaker and get an upgrade
Hit the shop fresh cut high top fade
Cool water freshness, car painted glaze
Hittin' corners 22 inches and no blade
Ride dirty, dip through the traffic, stay paid
Hit the court AI cross I'm snug in the J's

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blu]
We dump the 1's on the block when the sun get hot
Hit the beach with the freaks, Chucks with no socks
You know the steelo, my people got it locked
Pelligrino's for 3 hoes easin' up the block
They turn around and see what we peepin at
That all natural type of aphrodisiac
We leavin at noon, the drinks was consumed, we all buzzed
But back then we ain't really know what it was
Summertime

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bombay]
Finger roll on bosses
Self made and well connected brothers
Cuttin butters lavish livin' base wonder
Count skins like a deer hunter
You know how we do
Many dishes and bottles for my people
It's illegal how the steez do
You know 2 miles an hour so everybody see you
Bass bang out automatic buzz, light that
Good, good five techin' with the walkin' fuzz

[Hook]
