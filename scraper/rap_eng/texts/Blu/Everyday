[Intro (x2)]
The best time to my life

[Verse 1]
Ay yo I wake up in the morning
I light it
I kiss my girl, bless my first born
Back to slapping rappers
Back in their (?)
Another classic
Once again it's on
California native born

Cause my paper long
Remote gold
Earthquakes
Dropping the latest
Like I play my song
Funk Flex had the
Making a million
I'm like a don

The calm in the eye of the storm
Lighting up lungs
Blow the boys out the water
Hear them vikings come
Biting them bison's
Sliding dough, like (?)

Like I'm done dude
Drop a line on you, like a skunk do
Kick the doors out the mortgage
Fuck the feds, the force, the air force
Full force, the course
She waiting till kingdom come
Who you got kingdom from

Them slums
Rap laws, we taking it back
Nigga don't wanna, got one more

24/7 on the microphone
Everyday...
I'm writing for the people
Every day, all day to the max

[Verse 2]
Ay yo wake up
Feeling like we was straight outta Compton
Hands to the (?)
We still' mobbin'
Los Angeles, boy, we still flossing
Cause we sell tix like (?)


What do you know groupie
Tryna survive in them same streets
My poppa riding, grinding
Lamping on the block
Red shots on the eye lids
Take it positively tho
Optimus Prime
This time I'll probably swallow relief
Instead of frowning
My brain blinks


I change what I be
I fathom over the
She was on me

I'll be on one
Whatever it was
I roll the dope tree
She told me to pass it
But I killed it before I asked her
No feelings after, nigga

24/7 on the microphone
Everyday...
