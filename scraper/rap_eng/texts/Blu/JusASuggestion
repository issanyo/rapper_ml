Its only this one time
You only get one swing
May I suggest that
You use it for something
Find you a home son
Find you a love kid
You can grow old with
I'm telling you one thing
You only get one try
Its only this one swing
May I suggest that
You use it for something
Maybe you'll find love
Maybe you'll find friends
You can rely on
I'm telling you one thing

I said I'll never let her change me
Funny all my buddies say you know I ain't the same me
I'll be joking back like see the HD
High definition of my times
I'll be sitting on my rhymes like I can't speak
I don't even wanna see the light
I'd rather read than write
But either way its just the same sheets
Newspapers complainin' bout the same streets
The cops got me once
I said it ain't me
But like I ain't clean
They ask for I.D
Might mess with the boss?
Thats why I can't sleep
Turnin Tossin
Signs in my path tell me caution
Though I been ignorin them since 18
What you can't see can't hurt
So I dont judge another man's worth
Who am I to say he can't dream
I just play the cards they hand me
And ante up when my chance peeks
Can't see the limelight
When you sittin on the sidelines wishin it was your team
Betta go eat
So if Tomorrow comes
When Tomorrow comes
Give your heart to hearts
Forget the hollow sun

Think about let it rotate... 1
Think about for your own sake... 2
I suggest you start gettin in tune
About time you start makin some moves playa
Never had the last laugh
I was busy workin
Tryna fight my inner urges
I was hurtin' for some fast cash
Breakin every option
I would see the cops past watchin
Tryin to find a reason so they could bypass
All your homies grind for... respect
My fault
I don't got respect
They say I gotta try more
Livin in the jungle
Humbled by the tribe wars
Owls flyin round me
Shivered by the fine force
Watchin as the sky falls
This is for my people
I'll be equal for the time saw
They don't treat me equal
Homies told me that his life is a bitch
Feelin cheated like his wife is a trick

Playin melodies for remedies
To light up the grid
Now the devil has on it
Fightin the depression
Reefa bags on him
Nigga in his livin
Had the heater flashed on him
He didn't even blink
He gotta leave his rock
His jobs and his problems got him sitting on the brink
Che you got a thing keepin calm
Watcha drink
He drivin with the bags
He ain't even from the city
