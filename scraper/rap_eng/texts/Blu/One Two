[Verse 1]
Yeah, check it
Ayo, you want me like I want you
You got me doing things that I don't do
Yeah, you say you want the one but I want two, that's me and
You, yo tell 'em what we can do, I can see it in your
Eyes where the truth lies, two times that's
One Love produced by Q from the Tribe (right
Right) yeah, but really this is Blu and U-N-I (right
Right) and we on like your favorite song, she felt the
Vibe like Roy Ayers even though we killed them
Vibes like Milt Jackson, still you could catch her
Relaxin' to Cal Tjader, right after she bring that
Heat like Toni Braxton, my homie asking if my
Music always feels like this, hypnotical hump-
Thump on a [?] kick, I just wish I had the
Time to do the things that you wanted me to, she said it's
Cool, you take a number, you one me two

[Verse 2]
Check it, yo
If you ever fall in doubt and you can't crawl out, just
Remember how it feel's at the start of the count, A-one-
Two, me and you, and we ready to bounce, we comin'
Out the realest state like we buyin' a house, you got
Style, grace, cake by the case-loads
Pockets on swole, Jose Canseco
Still it ain't the same yo, Adam and Eve, it's like I'm
Naked in front of a crowd grabbin' for leaves, I need a
Two guard, ayo, I could play the one, we can
Both push forward to the center of the Sun, but
Still it's just a game, we can play for fun but if it's
Just the two of us who cares who won, we movin'
Up like stairs do, huh, one pair, two
Guns, shootin' flares in the air, 'til up rescues
Us from all the things that may stress you out, one
Groove but I'm guessing that you wanted me to, ayo

[Verse 3]
Check it, yo, what-
What you want it all, trust you can have it all, all them
Different department stores, you can have 'em all, hundred-
Thousand dollar cars, in and out of bars like a
Star, I just want to be the one you call when you
Fall into love like you fell in heaven's arms
I'm guessing who you are is everything you got from God
All them little extras you can charge to my card, and if we
Ever disconnect I'll never be too far, wanna
Brawl with your broads, don't forget me in the city
Spending all your money on dinners in other countries, know Your hubbies at home when you laughing on the phone and I Don't ask where your goin' 'cause ain't no way you haven't Gone yet, That song that I wrote, you know it's about you, the Only reason I do it is 'cause you wanted me to, you
May have wanted another but you wanted me too, wanted
Me to do whatever you wanted me to
