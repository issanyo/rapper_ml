[Verse]
Time is money I can’t wait to change
Hopped out gully with the skully on my brain
They ain't staring at my chain, know my name heavy
Shame, staring at the - know my aim steady
Tell 'em meet me at the spot with a leopard coat
Hit the cuzzy in the stup, love to - ay yo
I never met a hoe who is never broke
She said, "I never hoe", never let her know I know
Her portfolio glossed let me talk bossy
Course guy gotta floss, keep the moss off me
Y'all lobby on the shore, Maui in the Porsche
Get them wild freaks, now we in the Source
Give it 'bout a week and I'll be in the Forbes
YG talkin' 'bout, "Na, just record, nigga"
Freestyle beasts bound to get awards
Other day, I just kick it to the - when I'm bored
Easy, Bob James release LeBron James, stop playin'
God’s game, y'all ain't even got aim
Rock chains like I'm Kanye West out of LB, eastsiders jail free
Should I have to sell keys on 'em
Cold day fans hoping Hell freeze on 'em
I'm sounding like a siren though I never sweat
Step in front of your honor and get respect, nigga
'Guana leather hit Geico direct
Fresh to death, talkin' pressure to the press
Through the setup, enemy land never steup
Sit up in a king's chair, square with your head up
Told the chick, "Come in and catchup
Meet me at the rest with your dress up"
Easy, uh
