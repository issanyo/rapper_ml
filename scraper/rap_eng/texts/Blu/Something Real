[Verse 1: Rowlan]
Let me put some words in your ear
Don’t explain to you what I mean
Don’t talk like you on edge
Let’s act like we on scene
And stop with all of that guessing
And stop with all of those questions
Stop with all of those screen shots
We Snapchatting not texting
I wonder what you love like
I wonder what you fuck like
I wonder what you'd think like
If I give it to you rough like
Not assuming not guessing
You yelling answers no questions
No pretending you a real one
I’m on room service before the meal come


[Chorus: Blu]
Making up lies
All night
And I’m taking his time
But he don’t mind
And I’m only here for a minute
Concentrate tell me are you with it
Make me feel some type a way
All these words I wanna say
All these things I start to feel
Boy we onto something real


[Verse 2: Rowlan]
You should show me what you want
You should tell me how you feel
You should shut your fucking mouth
That's how we talking now for real
I’m with it let's move how you wanna move
I’m with it let's out run our last
You just finished now you asking for the real thing
Foreplay got you good I ain't even smash
We on about 50 minutes in
And we both just got the day
And honestly you loud as fuck
Fuck it let those neighbors know my name
Screaming daddy, God, and Fuck me
Your neighbors know the deal
They learn the sounds and picture this
But can’t imagine how you feel


[Chorus: Blu]
Making up lies
All night
And I’m taking his time
But he don’t mind
And I’m only here for a minute
Concentrate tell me are you with it
Make me feel some type a way
All these words I wanna say
All these things I start to feel
Boy we onto something real


[Verse 3: Rowlan]
Told me sometimes you don’t want love
And I understand that’s why you fuck with me
Say sometimes you just want it rough
So I grip your neck when you under me
All foul play scared to hit it right
I finish last and you let you sleep the night
I fold you up I love to bend you back
And you flexible so you don’t ever snap
And it's not the moves that you love
It’s who I am and my energy
I rock the boat and can’t wait to dive
Tell me swim careful when you enter me
No lifeguard's on duty
But feel free I got zero doubts
I’ma drown girl that's on purpose
Just got it but can’t do without


[Chorus: Blu]
Making up lies
All night
And I’m taking his time
But he don’t mind
And I’m only here for a minute
Concentrate tell me are you with it
Make me feel some type a way
All these words I wanna say
All these things I start to feel
Boy we onto something real
