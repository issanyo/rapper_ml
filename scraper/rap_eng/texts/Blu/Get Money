[Verse 1: MED]
Yeah, bling bling, money machine
50's under my pillow to have these dreams
Do it ditty, Caitlin queen with him like
Sex dice, dice, pretty price, living total
Paper fold so it's free, can spend the night?
Walk with a lean like I need a Sprite
False alike, get the money twice
Fuck the cost, only broke niggas need a price
Northern lights tap flash and the wine glass
For the life, ride a grand in night in white Gucci flats
Hundred's in the stash (yeah)
Tryna get a hit like Miss Honey on the rag
Take money, leave your pants, pockets Bugs Bunny
Keep the funny, niggas ran from me
Yeah, she love me, told me never let me fall
She call when the ringer on the phone ring

[Hook: Blu (x2)]
It goes, ring-ring,ring-ring my money ring
Ching-ching-cha-ching, money machine
I want that big bling and everything that money brings
Whip creme
Nice broads
And all the right things
Ching-ching-cha-ching, money machine
It goes, ring-ring,ring-ring my money ring
For that big bling
And all the right things
And everything that money brings

[Verse 2: Blu]
That's talking cake, mom
Plus more weight, if you talking bass
Oceans, lakes
If we talking space
And by the way I admire taste
Like how all them different fine wines taste
By the way, your fine lady got with Don daily
Miss Daisy, you can drive me out of my mind daily
The Mercedes and Coupe
I got to re-coupe
You break my heart in five heart beats
I gotta regroup
Tell my dollars, dogg pounds
I gotta be snoopin'
And if they lock down the blocks
We go to courts and shoot for the loop
I give you that bulletproof truth
Like you sat in that diamond in the back
No roof rap
Pay your dues, cause I do's that
While niggas do it for the love of the money, like a New Jack
But still in all, you the realest, dawg
Shit, I give you 50 mil and tell you build 'em all
Just get money, don't make money
Heard, on the lighter notes
It's just money to burn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Frank Nitt]
The hustle don't stop like one pimp and two hookers
Niggas doin' drive-by's, tryna keep up with them onlookers
Cause I need to look out for that bread, cuz'
God bless me and I whip up in that bread truck
Beat, beat, the money don' move the man
But damn, they man  be moving when that money's in his hand
And I stay after the grands like a trap house or a bando
So I can get a mansion and my wifey go commando
We are preimo (?)
Niggas so bellissimo
First that quality we bring it to you wonderful
And niggas continue to get money
The money got discontinued
The shit's funny
Meanwhile, on the go
Women be like where you been
Every time I leave, they be begging me to come again
And I don't mind going to collect Swiss Francs
And you know they all lust Swiss Francs

[Hook]
