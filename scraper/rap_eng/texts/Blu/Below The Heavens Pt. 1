[Intro]
Uh, Yeah, Uh
Sing it, Sing it
C'mon Love the whole world
Hug the whole world
Trust the whole world
Fuck the whole world
Stress the world
Bust the whole world
Motha fuck this whole world

[Hook]
Whose World Is This? The world is yours, The world is yours
Whose World Is This? Bet you feelin like the world is yours, Right?
Whose World Is This? The world is yours, The World is Yours
Whose World Is This?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm tryin' to get this place that my grandpa told me bout as a child
Told me only few can make it and the faithless ain't allowed
Be a star out your gang & aim above the clouds
And if you miss, you at least be amongst your own crowd
I smile cause now I see what he meant
I see it in the eyes of mothers when they uncover their sins and repent
Getting closer to Jehovah on they old knees bent
Praying our mind frames switch and our times change quick
But I hate to say it brother, the youth is too stubborn
Too stuck on themselves to ever think about others
They must uncover the scales, on they eyes called lies
Leadin' the deaf dumb and blind
To a place my mom told me bout (hell)
Where your sins get cleansed cause they bathe in flames
And the only route out, is to shout out his name
I was trained to be a soldier for god
But as soon as I used my own thoughts
I kinda got lost in a small called reality
Where hell is a falacy
And heaven is a fantasy created by man
So don't believe in it
You came here with nothing
And you leavin' with nothing
So retreat from this world of deceitfulness
My people it's time to rise
Realize it's a heaven whether you think it's inside
Or in the sky reach for it
Before it's gone internally
And you're stuck here below the heavens for eternity

[Hook]
Whose world is This? [x4]

[Verse 2]
Somebody once told me that I'm already in hell
Freedoms a state a mind
And just the heart of me's in hell
I free my slave mind so a part of me's in hell
And when it's hard to breathe, a part of me inhale
So pardon me, you gotta' try hard to be yourself
Cause you can't get to heaven being anybody else
And I was raised by a reverend yet the lessons didn't help
I had to get 'em for myself
I was told hell is hot, but had to feel it for myself
So I left home, as a young child smiling as I stepped on
Facing the world buty naked, without my weapon
I lost my smile and in exchange, I put a vest on
Now that my premature stress is gone
I got problems to face as a man
I was told you either stand or you fall
As long as you know when you walk you holdin' hands with a god
That alone can turn the dark to a walk in the park
I only talk from my heart so open yours when you listening
Every man has his own heaven the difference is the way that he envision it
So if you make your heaven picture less
By the time you die
You'll be driftin' in an imageless field
So build your heaven full of blessed thoughts
That's real, you can stress it or just let it walk
I got a question if a man can make his own heaven
Can he make his path to get to it too?
I only spit through a truth
And I spit it for the listeners
So I'm spittin' to you
You say it's hell
I say it's bullshit we getting through
Just think about it every man has his own heaven
But shit you gotta' go through hell to be a man first
And understand first
Hell is what you choose to call the present
That's why you're going through it
I just choose to call it stressin'
To tell you fools the truth
I don't feel that why I'm destined
So you can call it hell but bro
I'll just say I'm below the heavens
