Now does it really feel this good when you're at the top?
Or am I just this good? This hood
This life that I lead, this music I slave to
Been paying dues, when the fuck do they praise you?
When the fuck do you say it's enough?
After slaving for months and entertaining these chumps in the front row
Looking at you twisted cause you ain't got a blunt rolled
Cause these niggas is ones-and-dones
You couldn't kick it if the chick was a punt, you a cunt bro, wake up

Early bird gets the worm and I don't even go to sleep
Barely hit the scene so you probably never notice me
Married with a ring, once had a fling with poetry
Slowly had to leave her cause the beat was taking over me
No dreams ever come true without you
No sunshine's bright without a blue sky right?
Shit I'm about to do five mics in one year
One mic, one blunt rolled, and one beer
One breakbeat banging over one ear

One take, one way to the top and I'm taking it, thanks
No need to weigh it out, it's all here
All dressed in new LR Gear, all fresh
And I used to wear Wu Wear sweats from Ross
Now I stay in new pairs of Airs
Just to floss, who cares the cost
Shit I spit to rare to price, the new heir to Christ
Mic Chairman and I'm not sharing it
I swear it's like a God-given right to take care of this mic

And Blu is truly Huey Newton when he writes
And if he knew it he would lead a whole movement to the light
With his music, students ain't doing it right
Since the teachers started doing it for Christ
Losing my life to Live Kane's and Chuck D's again
Back to black Compton hats, Chuck T's and white tees again
Ever since I heard Cube, Ice-T and them
I knew I had to lead the next movement, and I'm doing it biatch
