[Intro: Narrator]
Were you scared?
Of what?
Getting killed
You'll never write well if you're dying
Do you?
Yeah, I do
I'd say it's my greatest fear, actually
Well, it's something all men before you have done before
All men will do
I believe that love that is true and real creates a respite from death
All cowardice comes from not loving, or not loving
Which is the same thing
And when the man who is brave and true
Looks death squarely in the face
It's because they loved with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds, until it returns as it does to all men

Push death out of their minds.. (x3)

[Verse 1: Blu]
I've tried to tell 'em don't die, don't die
Go fly, wear a bow tie
Dress in all black to the pine, Los Angeles times
Wake up for your cake (?)
Make your bed and keep your head up
You got bread to big up
You got a job, got that J-O
You don't fuck with yayo
Fuck the yayo, play the radio CA all day
What's the prob?
I threw a (?) to you, you brutal bomb
Do your momma know you playin' the Don
83, nigga you was asleep
Blu was born in uniform, probably blazing a beat
I had to find (?)
Every week, changing them sheets
I can write you my days of life on a leave
Put the gun on no police
That's not a way to show our chief
Clap rappers in half, I don't play around bitch
Ready to die,  before you pass
You gon' duck around, or you gon' turn the fuck around
Pick this microphone up, you better buckle down
Yo, fuck this song shit
You fuck with fakes, you know the cross fit
You in LA, you know you lost it
