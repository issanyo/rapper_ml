[Verse 1: Ta'Raach]
Allow the flow to blow the steam, hostile
Whenever I spit, you just swallow like it's part of the seam
Offin' the green like, Tiger-Tiger Wood, just tryna lean
You might have tried if you could but it might have been
You like a bitch fall why the bling
Saying how that shit go, my cock in this king
Niggas tryna get this cold, put rocks their rings
It's like my face on they wrist cloacked
But them lines to tight they slit throats at shows
Hit your lights at midnight
I beat you with a kick and a snare, fuck a fist fight
We light it up in the air while you twist mics
11 steps to Heaven's in here, get your bitch right

[Hook: Ta'Raach] x2
Put your juicen dranks up
A toast to the most and bank us
I sold hoes, pretty toes with anklets
Mad cuz' you ain't us, here put some light in your life

[Verse 2: Blu]
It's like he ain't ignited it right
He ain't the rioting type
So tell him to silences his pipes
Before we invite him to fight
Cuz' I'll arrive in the height of the night
Spitting that spice that'll widen your wife
And have her asking you "Why don't we fight?
So I can leave and be with Blu, cuz' he sliding me right"
See I done put the fear of God up inside of her twice
So ain't nothin' you could tell her that is wiser, aight?
My shit is dynamite, I'll probably die on the mic
You out dining the mic
Just lyin' life
So I'mma lie in your light
Take the lime from your life
And shine bright as a diamond with dimes dying as dykes
Tryna find that feeling I give her night after night
You left out, now I'm righter than right
And every rhyme that I write is like you writing a rhyme
Feeling my lines like life
Rising as high as my high without lighting the lye
So I'm like

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Ta'Raach & Blu]
[?], kiss of death, don't get it confused
I'm a marksman on the ricochet
Flow bite into fools
Dudes tussling with cigarettes
And hoes fight the blues
While I go and get these bigger checks then [?] you lose
So cold it's like i'm in his breath and did his best to lose
When the rules say a minute left, I'll put you in the dark
I brought shadow for them nigga steps, give 'em best regards
Charged it to the game 'til they put a hold on his card
Crash knuckles, back up or catch a uppercut or two
Got knocked but got right back up to bust a few
High shot, moms and pops broke up, so fuck rules
Getting laid plus paid doing what I wanna do
True rebel, see the cause? I'm effect
Any songs I'mma bless
Any squads I'mma wreck
Any broad I'mma catch
Any y'all wanna catch up? 'Fess up
Blu got fools in Detroit throwing the west up like

[Hook]
