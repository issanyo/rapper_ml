[Verse 1]
Look, it's six o'clock, I'm hoppin' outta the bed
Rain fallin', callin' X, but my phone line's dead
I guess my bills ain't paid, no ride to work for the day
Second option, hop the bus, but there's a traffic delay
My boss trippin', ‘cause I'm runnin' late and ain't no excuse
When I'm about to be 22 without a whip I could swoop
Feel like I'm finna shoot my own dome with chrome to escape
Zonin' out ‘cause working-working out ain't worth what I make
My lady callin' buggin', always fussin'
Just because we ain't ballin'
But it's hard because her cousin's fuckin' rich
‘Cause her husband's hustlin'
And I ain't fuckin' touchin' nothin' but a mic
Five o'clock and off the work, ready to go home and write
But I ain't got a buck to catch the bus, chillin' at the stop
Rain fallin' hard as ever and it's soakin' my socks
Fuck it! Kicked my kicks off and took off my jacket
Rolled my jeans up, beat up, and my headphones blastin'
Blazed some weed up and started laughin'
While I'm splashin' in puddles
Like, "Mothafuck a struggle! We dancing in the rain."

[Hook]
Don't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
Just move your ass, just move your ass
Don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
Just move your ass, just move your ass

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I hate taking trips to the lab
Got my pen and pad bookin' instrumentals in smash
Catch the bus regardless, trying hard to be an artist
But my A&R be callin' me out my zone into his office
Being cautious, ‘cause he don't want my record to brick
Asking me how he think my projects progressin' and shit
I said "Cool," but the truth is I'm stressin' to grip
‘Cause it's hard to make music when this depression exists
They say "Use it as inspiration; the best of them did."
Well, that's them, see, I can't handle this pressure for shit
And if you ask me, stress is a bitch
My girl needs more attention
And my record label's desperate for hits
Now I'm pissed, ‘cause I'm getting out the zone again
Makes me start to dread when I see a microphone and shit
It ain't supposed to be like that, I said I'll be right back
I left the office, got a phone, and called my partner Jac
And I asked him: "Remind me why I'm rappin'."
And right before he answered I remembered my passion
In the past, when I was scribblin' in my tablet
To box out my mom and dad scrappin'
To help me when my grandmother passed
Plus the many times when I was homeless
And the times when I was broke
And the music made a way when I was hopeless
He told me to remember the rain, it'll diminish the pain
And he told me not to ask him again, ‘cause I know…

[Hook]
Don't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
Just move your ass, just move your ass
Don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
Just move your ass, just move your ass
Don't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
Just move your ass, just move your ass
Don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
Just move your ass, just move your ass

[Bridge]
Don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
Just move your ass, just move your ass
Don't nobody wanna
Don't nobody wanna
Don't nobody wanna
Dance – slow – in the – rain
Don't nobody wanna
Don't nobody wanna

[Hook]
Don't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
Just move your ass, just move your ass
Don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
Just move your ass, just move your ass
