[Verse 1]
Ayo I never banged, and through it all, never changed my name
They used to call me Young Blu, before the fame
Like my cousin Smurf, heard about a OG who used to run that turf
Then he got murked
Puttin' in work with the Blacks when the Browns was beefin'
I got my griefin' after school with the chicks grievin'
Like Blu, thank God that wasn't you, ayo
One week later, they got my homeboy too, ayo
Dang, my cousin used to tell me, "Boy watch for them colors."
Other than that, you be the illest mothafucka"
So I pushed to the streets, I pushed to the beach
End up pushin' more raps than I ever pushed trees
I had beats from the best
Just to make it known, I was a beast from the West
Tryna get put on with the Snoops and the Games
The Cubes and the Pacs
Next thing you know they bangin' Blu on the block
My nigga, bang!

[Hook]
When the times get hard in the streets, niggas bang
When them right bars sit up on the beat, niggas bang
When niggas sling cocaine all day to make change
Niggas bang, niggas bang, niggas bang-bang
Tryna tell ahk, "Watch where you walk", niggas bang
When that spark set fire to that heart, niggas bang
From the rollers to the lames, ain't a damn thing change
My niggas bang, niggas bang, bang-bang

[Verse 2]
Now I'm back up on the block, rap shit locked
Pocket full of money, no crack in my socks
Shouts to the homies in jail with no bail
And props to the homies that blow but don't sell
They be like "Oh well, more room for the real"
Popped a fake in the face for actin' like I can't tell
Yeah it feels all good in the hood, I know it ain't
Should be smellin' all good, but, I know it stank
Tell the homie hold the shape while I blow that dank
Roll the streets with that cannon like we rollin' tanks
Unh, gold plates ho, I know they gon' hate
Might as well get the gold plaques, and the platinum chains
See me when you see me, 'til then, kiss the genie
Spell G, me, you could never be me, believe me
Put your CD on smoke, fuck PDs and the hoes
And them niggs talkin' 'bout their shit bang when it don't
My nigga, bang

No stranger to the game, but you can't seem to relieve her
You'll see her, when the morning comes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ayo, next thing you know, I'm in that county
With a whole bunch of real OG's surroundin' me
What you do when your name's Blu
And you run into a Crip, a Cholo, a Piru?
And everybody wanna know on the coast, what set you claim
All my life I had that name, but never banged
I'm from the Bridge, my folk from the 4th
East side to the dro, and all the way back home, let it be known
I got love for my block, love for my color
Love for my streets, and love for my brother
But a nigga put his hands on me, we catch fades
Fuck I look like? 30, gettin' jumped in a gang
And my peeps say, "How you keep peace these days
If you ain't got a piece by your reach these days?"
I say, my nigga, when you victim to the system
It don't matter what you do, they always fuckin' with you
So just bang

[Bridge]
