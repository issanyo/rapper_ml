[Intro]
Ayo, this the wordsfrom the Prezident, El Prez
I’m here with the rest of the niggas: New Wes, Blu, Pac Div
UNI, J Davey, Tiron, Ayomari, aye yall

[Hook]
A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live

(Verse)
Yeah Killa Cali, up top like a nigga Fowley playin park ball
Something like a young Nate Archibald
Lower than my arts draws like Warhols, ugly like warhogs
We gather round sports bars and court yards
Lookin for Double D’s like that report cards
She lookin for millionaires with sports cars
She end up with broke niggas and porn stars
School never meant much, I rather kick rhymes and count big bucks
Rather hit dames who got big butts
Rather get miles, we just live once, why not get it?
These labels are in business to get bucks
Moral of the story – don’t get fucked
With the right to impress yo mind
We gotta cut it short, look I’m pressin time

(Verse)
Said I always been a man plus none of my girls had the flat ass
They let the Jim Carrey battem like my ass
I’m a permanent stain up on yo brain
That made up love supreme, no John Coltrane
Saluting to lieutenant, I play the earth wind and fire
Minus the water, call me Captain Planet
Creator of the earth and the giver of rain
I strike thunder in yo lightning, nigga watch what you say
Pray to Allah
I can’t even begin this, setting D’s, I hope you’re taping this
Minus Mariah, fucking bitches snap turn at this age
Born in that dirty South, and the flies that we put in don’t believe that you atheist

[BLU]
Uh ayo, wutchu call God on a rap?
Wu Tang laid in the shade like head tracks, toupe
Kool Aid, potter in the pound
Something wrong? Young tune hung like drugs, lunch
Peak on rewind sunshine, ganja
Mind in front of the yall probably
Legals in space bar, hot technology
Got 80 babies on that Viacom, stop me
Even rain goes to ride, come tsunamis
Blue beach, I get in the mist, karate
Chop beats meets the aki
Not needs, blocks like keys but we unlock these
Buy lean, how could you say that we not G?
Weight of the world on these shoulders, spot me

(Verse)
Parallel parking, no power steering
Clearing, air it and there in a bang in a spot
Dreaming like I’m Captain Kirk, wuddup Scott, ock?
Guess I’m hard but layin, killin birds got mocked, rock
With a cold heart, result to blancos
See bank roll s through peep holes
Peep in time, no pesos, pay roll turns me on
Like a born hop sluts, spatulation talk with nuts
Dick up in a rent pipe, ass right, cheech right
So what it is? Tryna live what like this
Minus bitch nigga that go like they made from a rig

(Hook)
My nigga gotta live, my nigga gotta live
My nigga gotta live, my nigga gotta live

(Verse)
You can’t talk slick to a can of oil
You can’t talk fly shit to a falcon
You lookin sad Mike, you’re so cool
I say you’re damn right, bitch buy my album
Throw a nigga on the blog and I rock thousands
Yea nigga on the job and I’m not countin
Zoomin up, I’m with the emblem with the black stallion
Got these bitches and I’m in the middle like Malcolm
Triple X rated, we from the west baby
Today I’m getting high, homie I’m frustrated
Cuz I want success, I guess I’m just anxious
It’s always on my mind, I feel like a fuckin rapist

(Verse)
I aspire to be iconic
And it’s ironic how I can’t get out a pocket like your wallet
In my city with no college and I fit it, feelin like I hit a Philly really high
Not really, but kinda like it though
Five Michael flow, peace to Weezy out of rykers
But I’m writin for them lifers that unlike me had a writer’s block
For lack of an Iverson cross so maybe guidance talkin to em
In that lightin which I’m walkin to, I kick that
You call it science lyin like I ain’t applyin
This shit like religion, listen niggas tuck on the pivot
I’m shootin and hittin every shot, and I ain’t even hotchis
Sizzling shit get fizzling bitch

(Verse)
I roller skate backwards, sick like cancer
Dirty rat bastard, bow to the master
Take take take it, if you want it I’ll give it
I’ll kill it for the sure man, come get with it

(Verse)
Pike up the bong, bang a gong, get it on
Lend a list lumps for the chumps get gone
Aggressive, so what may seem wrong
It’s major, hit the sky high wave pager
Lowlife poster, hash is my ashtray
Roll stiff, west coast shit, let’s toast it
Feelin ferocious, just my wife
The bug, to right, excites the low light
Guess who, that guy is in
Like eggs on grits bitch ask a friend
You smoking serves gangs with a 3rd brain
Race palms hard is the main thing

(Verse)
I break bread,ribs
100$ bills, peel out buckets with the datings for the wheels
The block get hard, niggas bangin' like Shaquille
Them fishy ass niggas, we just shake em from the real
Slake em when we bill wipe
Thinkin with the mill, my niggas at the table
But you fake it and you squeal
Now shake it with the broad, it’s just Jason in the thrill
A southern Cal nigga but my fragrance from Brazil, steel
Catch me out in Austin with the Texas toast
Them thick white girls get ahead in vote
It was written we was leavin with the freshest quotes
Gotta live, we get it off the chest and go
Go go go

(Verse)
Let me go let me go let me go let me go let me go
But I open the door
Don’t put it on should an old nigga go nigga go
But I’m all for the coast
Hope that it both to the floor bout the time you reach to die
You look in her eyes frozen safe, we should dive now
What will it be? What would it be? Wake up
Bitch I feel what could it be?
My shoe size fuckin huge, now could it be him?
Better head back to the beehive
We died and get return now
Believe these creeps please feel quicker than you work how
We could leave no bird trail, no fingerprints, no perfume
You can’t compare to the debonair
That we better dug, dog cover that
Country got no challenges, I don’t even know bout child niggas
Now we smoke for all the whip up
Please excuse these amatures
