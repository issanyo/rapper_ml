Last Winter, I had a Little fling
Fresher than the spring, Fallin' like
Autumn and it seems, my summers never ended whenever we did our thing
But,seasons changed and its a shame so did he
And in return so did she, I wonder if she'll ever return, well we'll see
Seasons change, and I figured so can we, to the figure that she wanted me
To be,Young G O D, I need your L O V, Easy, trynna take at ease
But I, can't breath,Cigarette stank teeth, blunt holes in my jeans
I gets no sleep,These days, can't find peace, cuz I don't wanna wake up
Without she, And fucking out of place?with somebody I can't please,so peace
Till we meet again,Maybe you can be my friend,Have a couple seeds
Make a couple dreams come true, uh
