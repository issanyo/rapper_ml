[Verse 1]
Kiss the sky
In the middle of the winter with you
Under covers feeling like mid July
Take me up to cloud 9 with you
Chill with me while I twist a la
Twist the locks let me find a groove
I got modern bangers old soul and funk
But I usually bump Jazz or Blues
Hows Marvin Curtis and Thelonious Monk?
Books by Saul Will and Langston Hughes
She probably thinking who the fuck is that?
The reasons why you tryna fuck with Blu
She said well really I don't listen to rap
I said I know, that's why I'm fucking with you

[Hook]
'Cuz I'mma classy man (Man)
It ain't no regular players in here
'Cuz I'mma classy man (man)
It ain't no regular players in here
Lets Go!
Lets Go!

[Verse 2]
Yo, karmas a bitch
Excuse me for talking in French
But I had no intentions on harming this chick
Even though I have in the past
I never put my hands on her unless I was caressing that ass
I probably shouldn't have even done that
Cause all that led to was wanting calls back but it's cool
But I ain't got a phone besides my house phone
And I'm usually gone send me a message at the dial tone
[Girl voice]
*Dial Tone* Fuck you blu
You think you can just fuck me and cut me off?
I will cut your meat and make you *Dial Tone*
(Pshh) Message deleted
You wonder why I see your emails and don't read it
Drama, don't need it mama
So beat it
Think I can't find another chick with your features?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Kiss one, Teach one
Some love and some cheap
Some run so far from the heart it don't beat
Some need love and end up mistaking it for lust
One day I gave it all up and had to tell a broad hush
Never punch a lady cause the way I'm brought up
But dog you kinda crazy tryna play for me a chump
I let her put her hands on me once
Good thing I wasn't drunk cause I would have left in cuffs
Cause fuck
When love gets forced to something violent
Turns to Tug-Of-War and of course you're invited
Turned up the beat to ignore her while I'm writing
She took my pad and threw it on the floor tryna fight me
Like the fire inside her was gone ignite me?
I was like please hit her with a nice breeze like
PEACE!
I'm outta this bitch
You need God but I ain't got no time for this shit

[Hook]
