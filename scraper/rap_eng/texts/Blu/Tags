[Verse 1: Blu]
Beat still letter man jacket
Yeah, ill flavored tags in the backpack
Drinks sequence old one, scratch that
But them brown J3’s drop, I had that
Yea, tags all over the two-tints and Melrose
Verses on the soul of my shell toes, wallows
Wutchu know rubbin elbows?
’09, glad to see them doors to hell closed
Close call, Basquiats bout smashed city hall
Weaving round all them laws
Wutchu know about tags?
You got em all over them final sleeves
Drunk chicks, signing they tits flip
Putting mustaches round the models and the maggots
Fat ass John got er fast just on the Jag
And you know for the clouds we got tags
Snap bomb wires off heaven for tags
But we ain’t just talkin bout graffiti
’94 plates, insurance needed

[Verse 2: Blu]
Yea, beat still under the bridge shit
Shoppin with a dip on some chick shit
Still got the New Era still on the cap
Plus the fat cap just to bust a fat ass
Black white bubble of the rap jazz
You know rhyme of the Ratpack
Crossin out facts, we don’t hold no bad flow
Sick with the graph, make em throw up (tags)
Quiet line dime, Montana Max
Fairfax sendin' out our facts
We ain’t just talkin bout graffiti
’94 plates, insurance needed

[Verse 3: Exile]
Killers of giants, the kings of (tags)
LTS, MSK's got (tags)
Every time he go off air he’s got (tags)
Shivers every moment, pace that (tags)
The mere woman got some big ass (tags)
Thanks to that Basquiat ho (tags)
You know what I'm sayin, its so cold
Saber in the LA river go
