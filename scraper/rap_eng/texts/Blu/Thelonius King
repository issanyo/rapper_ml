[Intro: Blu]
Thelonius King, Thelonius King, Thelonius King

[Verse 1: Blu]
They bring the ceremony to me
I kill that opener with the opening speech
Closing your sheets
Please, hoping I slip is ridiculous, too deep
Too street for you niggas, I’m concrete
High priest nigga, chief, rock a beat to sleep, like a G
With the gold teeth, gold on my neck, gold on my sleeves
On my ring I got the black spinel stone of the onyx
Pulitzer Prize like a king I should change my name to Nobel Peace

[Hook]
But it's Thelonius King, Thelonius King, Thelonius King

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
In a world of murderers and rapists
And children with exposed rib cages
Organ damage from famine, flies on their faces
Blood thirsty baby killers and mental cases
Gun toting cops born racists
School districts preaching hatred
Angels with black wings holding automatic guns like gatlings
Bodies blown to bits, bloody torsos that lack limbs
You beating me, that’s like a Ku Klux Klan white supremacist
Tryna have a Klan rally, uptown Harlem on Lenox
Ruining nations with bloody mutilations
Cult practitioners, voodoo Haitians
Colonizers shooting, boozing and raping
I’m bringing ruckus, they licking rubbers, hip hop is starting to scare me
It’s a circus of clowns like Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey
I hurt any pagan, I murder any mason
I smack up any herb that’s perpetrating
More disturbing than D.W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation
Media playing the race card, avoiding the rape charge
They robbing the graveyard, these devils disgrace God
Ain't tryna create jobs, they leaving your bank robbed
They feminine, hate hard, I’m leaving you face scared
Come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tristate]
Gold kufi, jewels droopy, the rock’s ruby
From King Uchi to King Tut, the rope’s dooky
Bow gracefully and face death, erase you the hateful
Barbarians overthrowing your stable
Kemetic wisdom, they can’t shatter the Sphinx
Move spirits through the infinite plains where we exist
Slang ancient into the triple stage of darkness
Spoils of war, carve your sword to be the sharpest, shank shit
Protecting the think tank, sank ships
No papyrus, I’m writing this one on a blank disc
The Nautica god, pirate of society
Address my empire as the Durag Dynasty
