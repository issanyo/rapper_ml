[Intro]
Uh.. never
Yo

[Verse]
Eat a cobb
Leave it to Ma
I'm out the decibel lie
Co-75
Szechuan to the bomb
Kitchen crumbs written for bums
I rather mesmerize
And rode eyes
Herod her eyes
While I bury my soul
Gold brick road
I watch a second time
5 minutes fast on my ass
I'm on the ave
With the sess of Ethiopian royalty
Playing (?)
Life is over yo
I'm on my 20-20
Andre Gillian
Overcoat money
Bagging the gestures prize
Weed sacks, relax
Playing the best of Nas
The best blessing in life
I name my daughter my love
Pour out like water
For all of them dead doves
I'm red, a black and white at a McDonalds on a Wednesday

[Verse 2]
Yo, not a beamer
But my dope lean meaner
Roll chain
Dream I saw my spokes shine cleaner by
Hope poor niggas don't mind
Corners are not turned on ah
Nina meta nina
Now she blow the 9
I'm rocking gold like I cut up that Apollo
Wish to be the C
How you fit that in a bottle
Make a nigga spit a hollow
Out a bottle for my role model, uh
Pour my four old bottle out
Bottled and Prada shit
Probably kiss
Spragga Benz
Fog a Cartier lens
Fuck your soggy friends, nigga
Always win
All this hen up in my cup dry
Fuck me up when I'm dumb high
Fuck me up like that one time
Thugs cry
Dust this heart up off my sleeve
Doesn't all this stuck in fame
Fucking through all this cream
When you paid, nigga
