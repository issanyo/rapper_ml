Ayo
Sittin' on my back porch,rolling up a raggedy blunt
Told the ho, she just a raggedy stunk
Used to watch, raggedy ass Andy growing up
Now I watch Andy Allo ass bubble when she stuck
Can't believe she told my lady I was stuck up as fuck
Had to think about that bubble as I puff, what the fuck
Sittin' on my dad's porch, crack open a cold ass brew
'Til the homie hand colder than Blu
So cold no one told no one what went through
We just sat, lit a match, and do what young Gs do
We the Lysol, shittin' on you niggas with the oop
We just shat, lit a match, and do what young Gs do

Crown rock royal Blu...Boo
