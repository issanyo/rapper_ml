[Hook]
There is no greater love
Yeah na, cause on the real y'all there is no greater love
People try all the time trying to break us up
We keep it high up in the sky ya gotta take it up
Then what I feel for you
Take it up take it up take it up

[Verse 1]
Fuckin' up my mental when I think about you
In my room plotting how to start reaching out to you
Cause at first the situation had me deep in doubt
But the beauty evened out the beast and I can't be without
Your love
It's by far the most dangerous subject to touch
Yet we actin' like its lust, yeah right
Will lust have you up at 5 writing a text
Trying to get a thought up off of your chest
And her all on your chest gotta work so you calling to rest
For a second then you call her for sex
And she there in a second and her parents are stressing
Cause she missed a whole semester fucking round with this peasant
Named Blu and Juliet is you the two connected as one
Fun is endless getting drunk and fucking bitches is through
Sun back with the moon to balance out how we shines on the planet
And you try to understand it but you can't cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fucking up my mental when I think about you
Cause the truth is I know I couldn't leave without you on my side
At the time I was feinding at her beautys
Been thinking bout the beast and she can't be without -your love
Plus all the drama thats included with it
Ya heard the song and still rush like the foolish in it
Stuck like a clueless in love with every movement she makes
Even that ugly shit she do with her face
When she fussing with ya but you love it so you fuckin with her
And she knows it she just wants to make you fucking kiss and make up
You throwing out her blush stick and make up
And she don't need it anyway silk skin pretty face
Horny as a devil with her little bitchy ways
But she all natural cause I don't like my titty's fake
And her attitude bitchy but hey what can I say
I love it when I tell a chick to chill and give me space and she can't cause

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuckin' up my mental when I think about you
And all the little shit we used to speak about
Like having kids getting married trying to lease a house
So we can buy one up so we can find one
With a little room for Azulito when the time comes
Plus a studio for all my people trying to find some
Into inspiration like the way my girl is tired
But I'll still have a meal waitin' for me when my rhymes done
What a feeling when you're life's done building
And you chilling in your house with a wife a few children
Feeling like you struck a million looking at your kids like shit
This is my son this nigga came from my nuts
Same feeling when you first heard times up
Same feeling when I first heard Com' bust
I used to love her but I found other kinds of
So I left her like I really really tried but I can't cause

[Hook]

[Outro]
Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolfman
The Invisible Man and Hercules don't scare me
The FBI, Anti-American Committee, J. Edgar Hoover, President Nixon
President Johnson, Martha Mitchell
And her husband or her man or her woman Ethel
Kennedy, all the Kennedys
Bank of America, Chase Manhattan Rockefeller
None of these people scare me
What scares me is that one day my son will ask me
What did you do Daddy when the shit was goin' down
