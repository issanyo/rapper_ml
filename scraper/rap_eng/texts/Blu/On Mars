If space is the place for the stars (the stars)
Then you can probably catch me on mars (that's where I'm at)
They said we won't get very far (uh huh uh huh)
But now everybody know who we are (everybody knows)

If space is the place for the stars (the stars)
Then you can probably catch me on mars (everybody knows)
They said I won't get very far (yeah)
But now everybody know who I are (ok)

[Verse 1 : Sene]
(I've got to keep on)
Yeah leapin', leavin' every year that hands me incomplete odds
Delete and obsolete's on (?) (I got to keep)
Walkin' forward with my head up so I don't seem lost
I just seem as though I'm dreamin' or I'm seekin' more (I got to keep on)
Smilin' though at times I feel like getting violent I just breathe it off
Feelin' lucky that I'm breathin' through fall (?)
Seem to fall like leaves in Fall, name's Sene but now I'm rarely seen at all
A rare breed of dog (I got to keep on)
In the caves, hittin' waves, now and then I hit the stage (yo)
Twinkle in my eye cause I'm high as heaven's gates
If I die before I shine, shit I hope that heaven pays
My momma need to change clothes, (I got to keep on)
Workin' hard so I don't have to smell the blood that's on the devil's gold
It's hard earned, burnt, (?) y'all hard work
These bars over Barnes helpin' god's green's earth
(Aye) please, let's go to Mars

[Hook]
If space is the place for the stars (I know it's ours)
Then you can probably catch me on mars (let's go to mars)
They said we won't get very far (so take it far)
But now everybody know who we are (aye)

[Verse 2 : Blu]
(I got to keep on)
Yeah, skippin' through my life blindfold like I don't see wrong
Balance like a see-saw, (I got to keep) a piece
Or a peace of mind at least to keep calm in these streets
Then it dawned on me y'all (I got to keep on)
Yeah, no matter what the struggle is, the object is to be strong
So be strong brothers, keep calm and collected like ya records bruh
Keep pressing on, though I keep ejecting songs (I got to keep on)
Started compressin' the depression out my message, now let's get on
With no protection, I've changed my direction
I'm reflectin' a projection of intelligence to manifest it
Fresh is it, stress then isn't it (?)
Droppin' gems for niggas listenin' for benefits, this is it
If Christmas is the gift she get
Then every night should be the birth of Christ
How I enter it, my enter prize, guys

[Hook]
If space is the place for the stars (visualize)
Then you can probably catch me on mars (realize)
They said I won't get very far
But now everybody knows (It's real, it's life)

If space is the place for the stars
Then you can probably catch me on mars
They said we won't get very far
But now everybody knows who we are

(I got to keep..... on)
