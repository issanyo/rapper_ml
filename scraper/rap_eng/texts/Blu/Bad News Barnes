Word to Jimmy, he the remedy to rap
Flow so butter but he sting like a beehive
Knee high cowboy boots
Hat to match Button ups tucked into them Levis
Arrived in the game like "Fee, Fie"
Cool as they came like Kane to a Kool and the Gang
A Blues Brother stuck in his ways but stayed true to his color
Since bitches was in love with his waves he had a fresh fade
Now they rubbing the braids
Trying to figure what was going on up in his brain
He told em (bad news)
Yeah, you don't wanna know
It's a long ride downhill filled with some (bad news)
And that's why I write rhymes, the shit
I could skip to
To get through the (bad)
Like bad dudes with pistols
And issues involving missiles that may miss their target and hit you
Sending you to war
To fence through the gore
To come back with nothing but a gun and a numb heart to show for
What do we go for?
My mama ain't trying to hear no more (bad news)
Plus it's so much drama in my grandmama's day anyway
If I wanna get a gun and start shooting for fun
My target would be somebody with funds now wouldn't that be (bad news) if it was you
But they wouldn't give a flying fuck if it was Blu
Cause he black and he never paid a tax
Or his tickets It don't matter if you got dope rims, nigga
Get a life 'fore you get a mic
And get real 'fore you get killed
Cause if you're living like a slob at your mom's and you're like 25
No job and you're trying to get a deal
Most likely when you get one all you're about to do is kick dumb shit to young kids about how
Rims make the world go round And how hoes are your homegirls now
And if you ask me that shit's done
So go drown with that (bad news)
But as far as the dudes who keep it true
No matter what they lose
Or the loot they could get if they switched, they spit truth
I owe my accomplishments to you (I'm gonna do it for ya)
Yeah, you can pitch that baton to Blu
I'mma spit that blind in the booth
I promise
I'm not modest but I'm just honest
