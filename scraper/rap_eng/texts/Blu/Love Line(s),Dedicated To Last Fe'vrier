(I fall in love)
..A little too fast
(Too fast)
Here we go, uh

[Verse: Blu]
Kissed her on the cheek said peace
Each and every week no sleep
Just dream states, far fantasies
Far fetched catches, stretching the galaxies
I asked her if she like the pasture
Where flowers bloom under grass skirts
Candle lit cancer sticks, casual cannabis
Can a bliss be so simple?
Sanitize samples that vandalize vandals
Caught them on the beach, eating peaches, rocking sandals
Passed them pamphlets, pleasant passed her
Ayo I asked her, if she liked the pasture
Sun bathed and pampered
Of course she declined, lying yes, like a lioness
Maintained, maintain bed frame
Under the summer dress, tasting like rain
Spring and December when I enter
Stolen pictures, posing pain
Open to it, she knew it but he blew it
Or vice-versa, might church
Worshiping the first bit of bliss abysses
Similar to this, wish, wonder and write
Fly kites to the mistress filling my nights the right way I say
Touch and tangle like the tango
Sippin mango on that same old, same old plain Joe
Jane Birkin put in work and worth more then purses
Pushing hearses since the first kiss
And between sheets, said peace
Each and every week no sleep
Dream states, far fantasies
Far fetched catches, stretching the galaxies
I asked her if she like the pasture
Pierced ears with the atmospheres ring around
Sat her down on Saturn, put the single out
Singing bout the last time I had her
Falling in love, calling me up
Darlin we was so marvelous lust, so starving to bust, trust God is in us
Was offering love, but now Im offering what
What a difference a day makes, age old playmate
Smoking on a cig, taking lame breaks
Lavish life, later wait till the day dawning on
Whatever bullshit she got John on
