Yeah
See if you can relate to this one

Hope I'm not disturbing you
Because you look into thought right now
I don't mean to be rude
'Cause this is normally not my style
Can I take you out
I feel that if I don't ask chance will pass
And I'll never see your face again
I'll never see your face again. No

You maybe thinking I am strange
Not every single day, no, beauty comes my way, so

Do you believe in love at first sight
Tell me does that book that your reading
Tell the story of your life
Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye
To love, love at first sight

I could be the man for you
I can make all your dreams come true
Maybe I'm a fool
For saying I'm in love with you
You may be thinking I am strange not every single day, no
Beauty comes my way
Oh

DO you believe in love at first sight
Tell me does that book that you're reading
Tell the story of your life
Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye
To love, love at first sight

You Say farewell
I'll say so long
Say goodbye
I'll say your wrong
Cause here in my arms you belong
Woo
Oh

Do you believe in love at first sight
Tell me does that book that you're reading
Tells the story of your life
Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye
To love, love at first sight

Do you believe in love at first sight
Tell me does that book that you're reading
Tells the story of your life

Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye
To love, love at first sight

To love, love at first sight
