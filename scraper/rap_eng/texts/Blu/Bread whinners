[Verse 1: Breeze Embalm]
Salutes to the rich folk
Keep doing ya thang
Don't worry where your dollars come
Or if its birthed in pain
Just know that your gains
Will get you champagne
Peeping through window panes
I observe the game
We trying to reach the top
We go against the grain
Ya were born in it
That's a quote from Bane
My money is like Parker
I'm trying to get to Wayne
But what's my odds really
Nah, I don't give a
We must protect the richest Interest
I ain't one but I soon might be
Forget the poor
They ain't nothing like me
I got 99 problems
But I think I'll be the one percent
Dreams up in a villa
Pushing whips colored vanilla
The cane or the cream?
They both on the scene
Fly chicks, watch me Mack it
Ain't no tax for my bracket
Easy living man this feeling
Is up lifting winning off the backs of the poor
And that's just how you roll when you balling

[Chorus: Eliki]
The writings on the wall
You know your gonna fall
And it will all come crashing down
Come crashing down come crashing

[Verse 2: Blu]
Ayo I really like your style and the way you wear your crown
And I admire your taste, fine wine is like grace
And I bet your designer suits, cost a lot of loot
And all them foreign cars man they must go far
You call it butter allah, mustard poupon all???
I bet you got a toilet of gold, that you poop on
Do all them ladies visit at once, or they got schedules
And if ya always do the same shit you homosexual
I wonder what if feels like, to be privileged and white
How do you buy hats, sophisticated and black
You can act, like its cool but we all know the deal
And if we ever dined out I hate to take the bill
Still I roll with cha, coast with ya on the coast
Blow some dough with cha, we can go half on a boat
And then stroll through the city like we built it from scratch
So when the last piece built, we can scratch each others backs
Rich or poor

[Chorus: Eliki]
The writings on the wall
You know your gonna fall
And it will all come crashing down
Come crashing down come crashing

[Verse 3: Breeze Embalm]
To my third world babies
Wearing jerseys from losing Super Bowl teams
I hope you know that I'm keen
On adopting your whole nation
And showing what it means
To be philanthropic
Making use of my means
But not cause I'm good
This image helps my regime
A good news piece
To roll across your screens
Cause my mission
Lay different than missionaries
So my Vision
Is being labeled a visionary
I got a lot of hope in this lottery ticket
I got a lot of hope in this birthday wish
I love basketball but I aim to play cricket
I love my moms food but I need a new dish
Ain't nothing better than being better off
And Money is happiness right
I hope I ain't wrong
Hands up for the job creators
Keep em up so we could rob you later

[Chorus: Eliki]
The writings on the wall
You know your gonna fall
And it will all come crashing down
Come crashing down come crashing
