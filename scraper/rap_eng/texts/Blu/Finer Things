[Intro]
It's about 12 o'clock

[Hook: Phonte]
She say she want the finest things
She say she want the finer things in life
She say she want the finest things
She say she want the finer things in life
And I know she wanna (x2)
She say she want the finer things (x2)

[Verse 1: MED]
Trying to put you on beyond
We on eon, the stars away
No neon thoughts about Broadway
Cigar, the don way, calm
Hard, ain't a damn thing flown
Poor thing miss, soft kiss the scars of kings
Crowns made of skeleton to bling
Caffeine to the nerve
Wait, I verb it out
Got to sing it to the words, off key
Peace, beauty and the beef
Beats at your piece with a 3-piece crease
Tryna to impress the fee
Holla with a dollar, get a hotter product
The winning team velvet me out the goblet
How they won't tell
Our love will fail with a author
I pen her to the sheet, stroke novels
Full throttle on the link cast beats
Like Sonic underwater for the brink
Need dollars
Do the knowledge right
Lit a blunt from a candle light
Candle lies, find finer things in life

[Verse 2: Likewise]
This remind me of Merlot
This remind me of fur coats
This remind me of purple, crown royal
It sound royal when you let Madlib design sound for you
Boomin' out the Yamaha's violent
Killing like a Kamikaze pilot
Spit flames like a Molotov ignited
But somebody got to write it
Songs for the girls cause somebody got to buy it
Soft skin and scented lotion, liquors open
Hop in girl, let's get in motion
Bending corners, bumping the Emotions
Left coasting, let's smoke it
Going deep like I’m breast stroking
Going long like I’m Rex Grossman
Have you stretched open
Head banging, shit neck broken
Cause it be like that
Baby girl, don't look at me like that
(She say she want the finer things)
Cause it be like that
Baby girl, don't look at me like that

[Hook: Phonte]
She say she want the finest things
She say she want the finer things in life
She say she want the finest things
She say she want the finer things in life
And I know she wanna (x2)
She say she want the finer things (x2)

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Hold me down when I'm on a tour
A marriage of the minds, no common law
Dance floor, two-step into some old school
Cause bands  make her dance
Like the Commodores
Do me long, do me strong
Make me want it more
Make me give to  you whims
Make me want to crawl
Make me want to ball, drop all of it
Spend a night on the town, so star studded
Black car, living on the rush, card budget
Y'all love it

[Verse 4: Blu]
I kissed her with a goodbye after breakfast
She sent the text saying she was back in Texas
I miss her like the night we would drive the Lexus
The homie owe me lettuce, so he let us
I find her phone number in my old cell
Try to build a home with her, not a hotel
Mama stay put, oh well, she don't tell
Cellphone clientele, no Hov and Kells
Fiesta, she all dressed up
Back in my mind I'm tryna find when we messed up
She whine and dine but when dimes get spent up
I wonder will she give me back that time I lent her
We gettin' bent in the Benz with the friends
Makes you think was she worth in the end, huh?
I wonder what she do when she think players
Players

[Hook: Phonte]
She say she want the finest things
She say she want the finer things in life
She say she want the finest things
She say she want the finer things in life
And I know she wanna (x2)
She say she want the finer things (x2)
