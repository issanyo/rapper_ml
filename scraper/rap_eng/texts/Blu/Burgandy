Come on
Do it
Do it

88s systems in the park
With a stunk full of moon leave
Coughy with the soups
4 finger gold [?]
Sittin all alone
And my chest talkin bout i need a facelift homie
Ahmm
What you think the color his logo was
It made him wanna powder his face with it
Boots babes with it tuck in aces
I though that it was used to get paid with it
Stuff a case fit duckin the [?]
It was nothing
Exchanged it on a bracelet
No button, out the rose colored candy
Rose on them toes and them hoes can't stand me
Rose colour fitted caught a vision of Miami
Some, some looked liked john Candy
And she ahh
What you think the color the caddy was
When he pulled up on the curb with it

Burgandy, burgandy
Why don't you hop on this curb with me, baby
Break down a little herb with me, baby
I might have to take you to church

Forget us
Sprinkle little crumbs for the business
Musta had that phone be out there
No he wasn't
He off to some of that
Women wonder what he guzzlin
Its just sips, dawg, Cristal, naw
Had a bottle of it rot in the fridge
I'm on the [?]
With the chucks scuffed up
Brushed the dust off
Show you how to run yours
Down to the [?]
Young boss said its dumb
But its done wrong
Still had a up up on the John Johnson song
Suck on me Sean John
What you think the color her heart was
When she heard he wouldn't stay with her

Burgandy, burgandy
Why don't you hop on this curb with me baby
Break down a little herb with me baby
And i might have to take you to church
