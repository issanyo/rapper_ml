But now we can't sit up where they go
Yeah that's what I'm saying
So we come to find out the real deal right about now
If yall can get hip to it or if yall heard it before
We want yall to get down
In a little soul clap with us or something
And I want everybody (?)
If yall know the words to the record just sing along alright

Deadly combination
