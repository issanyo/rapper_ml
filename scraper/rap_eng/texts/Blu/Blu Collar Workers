[Hook]
Please don't take it personal
But I gotta go and work some more
And I know deep down it hurt your soul
But I'm a blue collar worker, girl


[Verse 1]
Now it's a long road ahead of me
Eyes wide open, trying to rock my flow steadily
Trying to stay focus so these broads dont get to me
But dog it gets hard cause they seem so heavenly
Humming Stay With Me trying to make my day as sweet
As aunt Tiombe on a Sunday with a cup of Angel's tea
I'm trying to find the happiness that couples claim to be
But it's hard to balance loving when you busting over beats
Sounds strange but it's hard to explain it over beats
In the lab daily rocking two or three shows a week
Going mad crazy stressing over press and your release
Trying to please labels while you keep your rep up in the streets
At the same time trying to breath
And on my down time, trying to find a fine breeze
But see im underground so now I gotta find cheese
Just to take her out to dinner
Just to eat and get a kiss up on the cheek
But for me it's even harder
Cause I ain't got a car to pick them up in
So chicks already think they put enough in
Plus im kind of cute so its hard for them to trust him
Asking what im doing every night like I be screwing every night what
Truth is, im bruising every mic that I come across
And every now and then, drop a hundred off
Just so you can fucking floss, but that's not enough for you
So I take another loss, wondering why I fucked with you
Knowing I got stuff to do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They say misery loves company, word
But I dont need shit, so dont come to me
And I dont eat dick, so dont cum to me
When you see me in a fucking Beamer
Leaning tough as fiends with winter fever
Your nose itching, hoes wishing he was a keeper
Fucked up girl, he was a keeper
Fuck the papers, shit he was the reefer
Now he's meaner than meaner
Was sweet now he keeps his heart next to his nina
And you used to see him, saving up his money from shows
To get her a rose, turning down ridiculous hoes
All he wanted was a chick with his back, but his chippers was whack
Now he adding on the Royce when he rolls
Sounds smoother with his voice when he flows, missed out
Keep woofing all you want girl
I'm in a brick house
With a thick spouse, pimped out, blue diamond dripped out
In my helicopter love, fuck your little Benz bounce
Fuck you think I work for huh
