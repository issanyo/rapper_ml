[Refrain: Co$$]
See my thoughts be so deranged, hey
Weed lighter, feet on fire
I be walkin' through the flame
Got me runnin' from my pain
More than a hundred miles a second
Tryna make that great escape
But some things no matter what, they never change
While lookin' in the mirror I feel his shame
Don’t recognize my face, who I became
I be walkin' through the fire
He told you life was easy
He’s a liar, he’s a devil, he’s a saint
No longer in my sleep and I’m awake

[Verse 1:Co$$]
It go 1-9, 8-4, 80 baby, April
Gates opened up to let a tainted saint become the mold
For a iller emcee, need to feel the empty
Been walkin' these streets where the peeps ain’t friendly
Spent g’s to buy my freedom a million years been lost on earth
They never err, but now my words is touchin' like a zillion ears
I used to get high in high school
Sniffin' coke, even thoughts of doin' H
Smokin' water, lost my dad, that’s the point I lost my way
Cross my path, bluest flag
Cheerleading for heathens, but the blue is sad
Greyest sky, hovered above my faithless life
It’s my choice to make this life
The greatest life or forsake my life
But sometimes it’s so hard
Just to say goodbye to habits
You know my obsession with affection and
My addiction to friction and the static
Happy never had it, had it hard
Drivin' demons not Ms. Daisy through the fog
Be the ones that drove me crazy, but made me Co$$

[Refrain]

[Verse 2:Blu]
And I be doin' the same thing
Rollin' a leaf up, prayin' up to the same Jane
Like Mary Mary could you carry me a couple steps beyond this bliss
I’ve been involved since the same days of, Kane
Like we was meant to be gods
You think this history’s for?
Rewrite that history ours, it makes no sense to me
They saying that we meant to be stars
I’m a sun cause I shine like one, bangin' that crown like one
Grim grin lent cents off that chinny chin chin
Then again I shouldn’t have to pen a gem
Blend it in, sittin' slim, with them pockets sittin' fat, wishin' that
Manifest metaphysics, you give it and give it back
Simple stats, add it up
Count blessings, stack a buck
Facts of life, almost had me flaggin' life and givin' up
Boy Smoke said “You shittin'. You kiddin' me bruh?”
My boy B said “You really must be kiddin' me bruh”
The same folks that, I would give a kid-a-ney (kidney) for
Climb a tree and find a dream, acknowledge life supreme, bruh

[Verse 3:Co$$]
And knowledge, I’m supreme being
Lower self-esteem, dreamless
When awake I can’t recall the scenes
I’m blinded by the green
Defined it by the theme
Schemes written in the scriptures almost ripped me at the seams
Seems I’ll never leave this place, I used to say
Until I left, I used to swear I’ll never fall again
Until I leapt from highest heights
And I teach my seed that he can fly as high
And be the king and make reality his dream
When I used to never think
And now I contemplate, I used to close my eyes
And now I never blink I said I didn’t believe in God
And now I count on faith to counter pain
Countin' blessings, heaven’s with me through the flame
I said I didn’t believe in God
And now I count on faith to counter pain
Countin' blessings, heaven’s with me through the flame
And even though
