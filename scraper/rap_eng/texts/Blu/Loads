[Intro:]
Yea, ah-ah, oo ah
Lives
What do you know about
He's back in effect (is back in effect)

[Verse 1:]
I got a girl that know all the words to O.C. Time’s Up
A bunch of others take me out to dinner and try and fuck
Cop tried to pull me over on my bike. Kill that noise
I had to peel, yelling, “get a real job, fat boy”
Subjects matter and my bones don’t break
I ain’t scared of a bag someone left on the train by mistake
I’ll fall flat ‘fore I fall back
I ain’t scared of dying. This planet ain’t all that
I restore order off border. Meet the baddest biddies in the world, then forget to call 'em
I ain’t even tryin'a balance true moderation and instinct
I ain’t even got a balance. I ain’t even got a bank
If I ain’t gettin’ paid, somebody should not care
If I came late, be happy I got there
And I don’t give a damn 'bout cleaner sample
Shave and a haircut, shampoo

[Chorus:]
Loads and loads [x8]
Been up since 1 been up since 2 been up since 3 [x2]
Been up since been up since

[Verse 2:]
Waddup, this song don't make no sense
Most chicks I know don't pay no rent
And on some g shit
My name's blu
I rock a halo like a california angel
Knowledge deeper than apollo would played up
I make gold rain down on your rain pole
Homeboy sandman killed draino cuz he mr clean with the washing machine
My floss lean the most awesomest thing
So no use talking to blu if you not talking green
Presidential marker versus sargent slaughter
Put bargen in your office with the burrell
Double burrell like burgalina beef murder
Waking up niggas with the word
My momma said I walked a mile before I ever fell
Niggas need to wash their mouth out with forever soap

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Down for whatever
I'll talk to strangers the stranger the better
My name jonwayne we take multiple trips
Look people in the eye longer than they comfortable with
My bad, I dont give a shit when you tryin to show me your ipad
Or when you try to show me your iphone
I'll be too caught up with shit i'm ready to die phone
Switch blade picking my teeth
Straight pitbull licking my cheek
Nothing goes down on my watch
Super duper bad chick folding my wash (know all this)
Bill collectors have no clue where I live
Pocket full of snickers and sweet dreams
Not only the president but the head of the street team

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
De de [x24]
