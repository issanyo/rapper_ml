Its all my fault?
Or somebody elses
It feels like my fault
I take everything, till i break
Can you honestly save me?

And im not even sure
If I’m in love if im just horny
Do you love me?
Make this weird, don't break me
Not again

Im looking for you
While you look at him
What can i do
If you are into somebody else?
And i wonder if they’re in love

(i wonder if they're in love, i wonder if they're in love
I wonder if they're in love, i wonder if they're in love
I wonder if they're in love i wonder if they're in love
I wonder if they're in love, i wonder if they're in love)

Wake up now
I can't live this dream anymore
It's not even a dream
Wake up now
I can't think how many times that i got hurt

I just can't believe
How deep you are in my skin
Again and again
Can't i break free?
Can't you leave me?

And im not even sure
If I’m in love if im just horny
Do you love me?
Make this weird, don't break me
Not again

Im looking for you
While you look at him
What can i do
If you are into somebody else?
And i wonder if they’re in love

(i wonder if they're in love, i wonder if they're in love
I wonder if they're in love, i wonder if they're in love
I wonder if they're in love i wonder if they're in love
I wonder if they're in love, i wonder if they're in love)

Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone (x4)
