[Blu]
It just does not stop (stop, stop)
It never ends
Like a precious blend of life
Wrapped into heavens winds
Like sex and infinite
With every second and minute
Sending love for his missing
Killing, stressing and sinning
Then it begins. You meet her
And the first eternal cycle of life seems to occour
First your vision is blurred
Trying to figure out how to get her peeps jockin
Til you eavesdropping listening to her words
First time "love at first sight"
Is relevant in your life
A glow like an angel on earth
Her soul was so bright that your nights become

Days
One way or another she'll discover your praise
And someday you'll be
Lovers
That's just to say the least
And if you ever get the guts to speak
Nothing but a couple of feet away from
Making love complete
But you love the discreet thoughts that cross in your mind and that's it
Like an isolated island in the sunshine, is that chick
Next day, the same shit, same time, same impression you get
Same kinda
Feeling killing your mind cause you're too shy to say shit
Not even "hi"
Wishing a perceptual state
So you visit this same place envisioning
The chick as a fix for this
Silent as a predator
The prey you stay picturing
Your souls walk across the ocean
Both talking of emotions
'til your
Hearts' caught in a moment
Of an omen called love
Supposed
To last forever
Awakened by a waiter asking if you have his cheddar
And you realise nothing can be better than having
The pleasure of sitting at
The table that she's giggling at
But never will you ever get at that so you smile
While the world continues
And thoughts sink you to the clouds
Where Flora Purim
Sings of dreams

And you absorb the never ending
Feeling that you're living for nothing more
Than her.
