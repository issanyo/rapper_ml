[Verse 1: Jeff Bernet]
The simple things
I do that make me think of you
Being at home or when I'm on the move
From when I brush my teeth to when I go to sleep
But even then I'm dreaming about you

[Chorus: Jeff Bernet]
That shine on your lips
Those curves on your hips
Girl I swear I could get lost
Looking into your eyes
I'm tryna focus but can't help notice
Feels like everything I do is a sign
Can't get you out my head my head

[Refrain: Blu]
Girl you're just too fine
I know it's slow but we're getting closer
No need to pretend, instead
Let's not waste our time
So come on over give me some closure

[Verse 2: Jeff Bernet]
The way your chemistry is like poetry
Got me thinking it's too good to be true
From the way you walk
To the way you talk
Got every man out there tryna pursue

[Chorus: Jeff Bernet]
That shine on your lips
Those curves on your hips
Girl I swear I could get lost
Looking into your eyes
I'm tryna focus but can't help notice
Feels like everything I do is a sign
Can't get you out my head my head

[Refrain: Blu]
Girl you're just too fine
I know it's slow but we're getting closer
No need to pretend, instead
Let's not waste our time
So come on over give me some closure
(Can't get you out my head, my head)

[Refrain: Blu]
Girl you're just too fine
I know it's slow but we're getting closer
No need to pretend, instead
Let's not waste our time
So come on over give me some closure
