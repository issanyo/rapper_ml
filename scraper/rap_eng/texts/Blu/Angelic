[Verse 1: Co$$]
For real
Chill
It all started with the wheel
Till the wheel’s fall off
But the beats keep droppin’
The fiends keep coppin’ they rocks God
And the rock stars sell souls whole while they CD’s floppin’
From Crenshaw to
The made men boss-men
Ain’t the only breed, cause the seeds breed profits
Like the knuckle royal blue
Just another from the crew
And you know who keep it true
We beat the streets, stompin’
With the impact of Timb boots
Make the tin booths
Till it’s so damn hot, the AC can’t stop it
I’ll be rockin’ like I’m crazy
Microphone insane, imbrain
I’m the same MC
Pocket’s full of lint balls
Maybe cause I’m clutchin’ on my last dollar
I’ll a pop a collar without a penny to deposit
I was duckin’ paparazzi, kinfolk
While my kinfolk wanna treat me like a klutz
Like I rock a Neo-Nazi symbol
On my arm or somethin’
And I ain’t armed with nothin’ to dunk
Running from myself like my karma’s comin’ for me
The homie rode to Philly with the indo
Trash-mouth in his glass house feelin’ holier than thou, huh
See I’ma smack a sucka mouth
We protect those
Kleptos
That jack a brother’s style, foul rapper
Maybe he just another poser
Somebody should have told him that the masses run the town
We about to take it over
Scratch that, about to make it over
And snatch that poser out his crown
Hold it down
I hold it down
I hold it down

[Verse 2: Blu]
Co$$ chill; try to tell him shit is real
But he still dreamin’
We in the film tryna kill demons
And still kneeling to god
While my squad gets praise, this the real Benz
I feel weakened by my need to change
Folks be hopin’ that I keep the same metamorphin’
Power Range, extra foreign
How I’m out to spend once again
Out to lunch while you barely wakin’ up
Brunch and takin’ up punches
I can out-face by the hundreds and the thousands
Feelin’ proud to be somethin’ in this day and age
Black and white, still a shade of grey
I used to be ashamed to say where I used to stay
When I’m out the States
I was a slave not too long ago
King right before that
God of this planet now I’m payin’ taxes
Killin’ my brother for a fuckin’ chain
When we were once in chains runnin’ things
Shit is backwards
Feel the Wrath of Cain
I never listened to the Wrath of Kane
But I did bang No Vaseline
It’s a shame where these mind-states keep us
Bangin’ and slangin’ caine
Till the fiends noddin’ by the speakers
Crackin’ up, like I’m laughin’ but I’m really crass as fuck
Stackin’ books, I bought my Dad a Caddy truck
And my little sis a savvy bug like fuck Beatles
Fuckin’ with you, I love The Beatles
But they did jack my people
According to the laws that you make and the commandment you created
That shit’s illegal
So fuck a reparation, give me my royalties
Crownin’ the freedom to live royally
