Yeah, drive me crazy wild
They say oh here we go again
Aye Ex heh, I said we'll never be the same
I wonder if I left my stereo
Would you care to let me go
Or would you keep me shackled in your chains
I know the game is missing heroes
And I started here from zeros
To the season where I came in to obtain
See my aim's simple
I have laid it on your instrumentals
So it's no coincidence I'm in the game
I plotted, planned it for a year or so
Hoping folks hear Below
And see I'm not the same as Lil Wayne
They say I bond with the spiritual
But hollar if you hear me though
My life is more than rims and getting brains
They say I bond with the spiritual
Yeah, they never let me go
Until it's time for me to board a plane
I know the fortune and the fame
And the performing for the change
And paying for important poison in my brain
And Mary Jane that keep me miserable
And if I'm singing miracles
When all you do is bitch and you complain
Bout how you wish you were this way
And your butt was bigger that way
I would fuck you this or that way till you came
See the way I feel about you
Is like nothing left without you
But I doubt you think it's nothing more than game
But the game is lame
And the fame ain't special
Since I met you I have nothing more to gain
Except your love
And harmony
Who's to say that I just can't give you what all you need
Just relax your mind
And relax some time
To harmony
