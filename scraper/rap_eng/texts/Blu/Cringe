[Hook: Mibbs]
I say, goodbye to you assholes, my past hoes
My enemies and my fake friends
I send you all my best wishes, and collect my riches
Yes, the best form of revenge
(x2)
Cringe

[Bridge: Mibbs]
Cringe, nigga
Repent for your sins nigga
Cause this is revenge nigga
Where must I begin, nigga?

[Verse 1: Mibbs]
Remember when...
Remember back when I used to ask momma for five dollas
Gettin' treated like shit cause I drove a Honda
By who? By Tanya, Rhonda, and Sasha
Funny how tables turned, now I got them hoes lined up
Yeah
It’s dedicated to niggas, bitches who ever hated
I’m celebratin’ cause now my status is elevated
Tours all on my own, the symbol of success
I know some niggas back home wishin’ for much less
And what’s best is the genius is never recognized
‘Til the world needs it, now peep the secret
We the Einstein of fine rhyme, cause we can draw
The fine line between prime time and weak shit
Now turn to other cases where mothafuckas made it
And everyone around ‘em was curlin’ up they faces
Look what Kanye did, the whole world was frontin’
Now he pickin’ up Grammys and you can’t tell him nothin’

[Hook: Mibbs]
I say, goodbye to you assholes, my past hoes
My enemies and my fake friends

Cringe nigga
Repent for your sins nigga

[Verse 2: Like]
Remember when...
Yo, I gots no love for the funny style that was around
Until they see you shinin’ or they think that money pow
Girls slide you their numbers and they call you honey now
Before they had no time, ‘member they used to cuss you out
Wow, it’s killin’ me, cause most of these niggas be
Worse than these bitches be, thirsty to get a piece
Of fame plus the name and the glitz and the glamour
In line at the club, I’m in that bitch for an hour
Because they at capacity
You let in these two niggas cause they athletes?!
Wait, who you gassin’ man?!
They came here after me, fuck if they athletes
Get off they dick, that's why dudes be clappin’
Heatin’ clubs cause they sick of gettin’ treated like a scrub
See me I kept it love, ain’t no need to beat some up
Just wish these niggas luck ‘til they see you gettin’ bucks
Now the same mothafuckas on ya nuts
What the fuck?

[Hook: Mibbs]
I say, goodbye to you assholes, my past hoes

[Bridge: BeYoung]
Cringe, nigga
Repent for your sins nigga
Cause this is revenge nigga
Where must I begin, nigga?

[Verse 3: BeYoung]
Remember when...
Oh yeah, see I remember well
Vividly, niggas be all in the streets, hate is all in they teeth
Chewin’ it, always talk shit and put you in it
You know them types, wanna talk hype but ain’t doin’ shit
Them be the niggas who be out they neck talkin’
Probably them niggas who be internet bloggin’
And hoes no different, they so gold diggin'
Never showed me love when I was in my debt walkin’
The Volvo whippin', old school, four-door tinted
Dented with the logo missin’
Now I’m oh so pimpin’ and my polo vintage
With a bad piece smilin’ so photogenic
You hoes don’t get it, revenge of the nerds
Now I’ma flash so much ‘til it gets on ya nerves
You niggas that slept to you trickin’ ass birds
Revenge, now cringe at my words

[Verse 4: Blu]
Must’ve been around ‘05 niggas finally noticed the dope rhymes
And all the folks around me would cosign
They knew that he was gon’ sign the deal
His high ill, I would flow live
And hoes finally showed up at showtime
But I remember ‘03, niggas won’t give me no dope beats
Bitches wouldn’t let me get no squeeze
He was just a hype man, and every chance I got I would flow beast
And back then I even did shows free
But who remembers ‘04, when I finally decided to go pro?
And smash on any nigga spittin’ I don’t know
And no doors had them boys sleepin’ on no joke
But deep down you knew he was gon’ blow
Now skip to ‘06, got rid of that old shit
So sick with it, niggas thought I would own sick
Starin’ at the throne like homes in ‘07
Then I started livin’ life below the heavens

[Hook: Blu]
