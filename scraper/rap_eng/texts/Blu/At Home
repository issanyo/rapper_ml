Verse 1 (Blu):

I'm back like I never left you, god bless you (blu)
B-L-U
I'm extra special from the zoo
Crack your melon in two
Ain't no telling what i'ma do
I'm so ill
I'll turn spike lee to pineapple juice
To try collateral commission
Getting stacks off ya loots
You ain't know my pockets deeper than black
Over your roof and like that
We back in the groove or in the air
I write raps
You write squares like a square
I light squares and ignite
And blow your mind into the night air
Uh
And like nike airs we do it all the time
Raw shit
Rough rugged and raw
Rippin rhymes out the note pad
Like when I write the rhyme its a rap
And I can have that back in no time
Free pick me up
I cut the record beat for show time
Beat in the trunk
Had be beaten it up
When I wrote the rhyme
Yo, izzy fin em'

Second Verse (Izzy Strange)

Yo
I'm back without out a sequel
Splashing paint on your isle
My whole look is illegal
So your parents probably think that i'm evil
Every good philosopher was
Now we got way better drugs
Put my morals to beats
And shake ya ass in the clubs
That's we know that its real
I don't care how ya feel
I'm spittin rhymes so you know what the deal
Like 50 a sack?
What kind of chitlens is that?
Must be coming with heat
Like after the team got rid of shaq
Now let me draw you a picture
Whats the diagnosis?
Cause i'm just getting sicker
Add blu and I in the mixture
And we serving a classic
Put it in a swisher and serve it to the masses
I'm riding this bitch until the plane crashes
Into bushes crib
Seatbelts remain fastened
Tell me how you live
Do you got passion?
I'ma do this for the kids like old dirty bastard
It's izzy

(Hook)

(Izzy Strange):

It's Iz and Blu coming thru
Dropping through, making this look overdue
Your like iz, I never heard of you
Sure your true
But after this, i'll make sure you knew
Grab a clue
Izzy strange poppin on the avenue
Tell em' blu

(Blu):

I tell em'
Iz and Blu coming thru
Wicked like some witches brew
Bitches too
But I probably never even heard of you
Do your dew
And after this
We'll make sure ya do
Take your cue
When royal blu hit the avenue
Izzy too

Third Verse (Izzy Strange):

I'm back like repeat offenders
Iz and blu the main contenders 
Holy ghost these holy smokes
Make sure to tip your bartender 
We make it cold 
Like harsh winters
You were close
But no cigar hitter
Quitter 
Going hard Like  the river
Of phoenix
You knew we were genius 
But i guess you gotta see 
To believe us
So mark it down 
Like the moment you loved her
Cause i ben savage like freds brother
Since its boy meets world
Then boy meets gutter 
Make your mother wish 
She woulda wore a rubber
Asking is he strange
For running with her favorite color
Better come from the rock that you under
Cause i'm sure to be discovered 
Opinions are like mouths
I dont listen to much
Everyone got one
And yours probably gotta dick to suck
Wish ya luck
Tit for tat, serve it up 
Me and blu just serving lunch
Eat it up

Fourth Verse (Blu)

We back at it
While rappers get canned
Like trash maggots
You rap average
In layman terms
Craft-matic
Hap hazard
Some industry standards
Pack cancer
I'll pack pampers  for shitty rappers
That pack hampers
Bro, clean it up
No one mean as us
When me and izzy teaming up
It's like a grizzly and a wolf in the city
So bring ya guns
And ya whole military committee
We not leaving like brent, barry, johnny, and ricky
My confidence will turn the competition into ambience
Amputate rappers reaching for mics
Take an ambulance
If not
Take two dope emcees and calm ya down
Pump you up
Just to pop your balloon
You got clowned
You not down
Like brandy before she dropped the first single
You a female in the club
You roll up, ready to mingle
Izzy finna blow up
Don't ask
Its not a question to collab with blu
It's already manifested

(hook)
