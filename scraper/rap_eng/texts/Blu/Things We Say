[Hook: Both]
(Blu) Man if
(Aloe) Man if what
(B) What if we can just
(A) Just what
(B) Just blink yourself away
(A) Man if
(B) Man if what
(A) What if this is just
(B) Just what
(A) Just dreams from yesterday
(B) Man if
(A) Man if what
(B) Whatever we make
(A) Make what
(B) Is what we make in the scenes to play
(A) It's kinda crazy I guess, when words become flesh
(Both) And brings life to the things we say

[Verse 1: Aloe Blacc]
To the things we say, to the things we say
Maybe it don't ever happen so simply
Cause sometimes when you be right
In the narrative to your life
And somebody throw a (hype?)
On the pain you weigh
I mean it's cool for me to speak a bunch of live that life
But I ain't ever have to sleep under a bridge at night
Food spoiling in the fridge
All alone in the crib with no kids
Now come on, what gives me that right
See I'm tripping if I'm thinking this is simply positive thinking
To stop a hooker from hooking to alcoholic from drinking it
Maybe it could be what I know
That it takes more than water for a flower to grow
And a diamond might gleam and glow
But without sunlight, that little shining won't dream and show
So set sail if you catch my drift
No (net/knit?), thumbs up, come and catch a lift
You can Plead the Fifth
But a baby who don't cry or eat
Gotta be careful what you feed em with
And in a way we all babies, still growing up
Sucking down the milk with the guilt, keep us throwing up
And at the same time, it's like we all parents
Let us help each other grow with the dreams that we sharing
Man if
(Blu) Man if what
(Aloe) What if we could just

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Blu]
To the things we say, to the things we say
I guess I gotta start rapping bout bling today
In order to get a check
Cause if words manifest in the flesh
Then I gotta say for pay
So I'm gonna scream out C.R.E.A.M til I leave the bank
And keep repeating the hook like a mean delay
Like a mean delay, cause what I mean to say
Is to make your dreams reality in the scenes you play
It could be cold as December or spring in May
And yet my hunger to succeed won't leave my veins
For my jerseys, my worthies
Or I leave the game early
Cause a birdie said god you need to stay
Bye, until then I got hope to supply on
Like dope/dough, sometimes I gotta smoke to get by and
I choke, cause I wish I could blow through life
