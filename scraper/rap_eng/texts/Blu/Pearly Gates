[Hook 1]
Ay, One for Dilla, Two for Proof, Three for O.D.B
Five for Aunty Crystal, Six For Aunty Walker
Seven for Heaven cause the list goes on
I hope I make it to the pearly gates the day my name is drawn
Buck a shot for Big and Pac, Scott La Rock, and Eazy-Z
One for Left-Eye, Aaliyah, and Big-L, rest in peace
Farewell to the deceased because the list goes on
I hope I make it to the pearly gates the day my name is drawn

[Verse 1]
John Barnes, born poor but I still wore Jordans
My mamma slaved just to make us look a bit important
She couldn't raise us Christian cause my pops was pimpin'
So she flipped the script and married a reverend, Kevin Cain
Hated his name, and the way that he would preach
Made me sing in the choir, and couldn't listen to no beats
Fuck 'em, I would visit my cousin and bang nothin' but hip-hop
Cusin' and all, 'til that one time I got caught
It was when Biggie Smalls said "Coogi down to the socks"
He thought it said "Coochie, down to the socks"
Blaw, got socked, dropped my sister out my arms
He bought me Kirk Franklin for Christmas and said it was the bomb
And then my mom made me read this Jesus book
A little bread a couple fish, didn't need no hooks
Funny, these dummies mention him and seem so shook
But uhm, we don't believe you, you need more crooks
I was, clean as a cook, now I'm hooked to all kinds of shit
Used to laugh when I'd break my grandma's cigarettes
Her daughter picked the habit up when she was just a teen
So I lost my Aunty Crystal this year from nicotine
And now I smoke packs of tobacco, and can't even get clean
Kinda, sorta alcoholic and can't even quick weed
I tried E times three, now I'm trying to find peace
I just hope the doors open when it's time for me to leave

[Hook 2]
Ay, One for Pun, Two for Perry, Three for J.M.J
Five for Mac Dre, Six For Professor X
Seven for Heaven cause the list goes on
I hope I make it to the pearly gates the day my name is drawn
Keep your lighters up for Dusk one time
Two for Poetic, let it bang again for Freaky Tah
[We need these compasters](?) the list goes on
I hope I make it to the pearly gates the day my name is drawn
