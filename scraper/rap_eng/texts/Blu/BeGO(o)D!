Verse 1
[sene]
We all trying to wear pinstripes
And not have to get life pursuin' it
Leather chairs with cocktails
Ya we doin' it
Six rooms with six baths
Plus the groove is sick
Slick rick the new edit(ion)
Each week the newest kicks
"but why you doin' it?"
Probably cuz they said i couldn't
Mama always said i shouldn't
Papa said i wouldn't/couldn't
Fuck - maybe i should quit and get a degree
Drop my microphone off and shit on my peeps
Pops always said never keep your heart on you sleeve
People see it as a weakness
Cut your arm and your sleeve
So it's only natural (unclear) have the heart of a gee
Cats follow him
Funny now they followin' sene

Chorus
[Blu]
Like, be whatever you wanna be
If only if you just believe surely you can achieve
Whatever's in your dreams can be your reality
No matter what it seems
This is your L-I-F-E
So be whatever you wanna be
If only if you just believe surely you can achieve
If you wanna be a thief, firefighter or police
You could be O.G
But you could be a G-O-D
Just BE

Verse 2
[Sene]
Call me bad news
15 with 2 tattoos
Always out with the crew playing loud rap music
What they heard as noise
Me I turned into a future
[Blu]
And i felt the same way
So i turned into a producer
Used to tell Exile what i wanted to loop up
Now I'm at the table puttin' needles to the cues
Cut
Cuttin' fools up
Lovin' what i do and get a pretty penny doin' it
Payin' off dues in the process
Money is the object yet I...
Thank god that i can make rent and make dollars
See everybody wanna be theyself but need a reason to
So, i'm here to let you know i believe in you
First you need to put more thought in who's leadin' you
Cuz those can very well be the same people deceivin' you
Used to look at rappers as the leaders who could lead us through
But really
It's you

Chorus
[Blu]
So be whatever you wanna be
If only if you just believe surely you can achieve
Whatever's in your dreams can be your reality
No matter what it seems
This is your L-I-F-E
Just be whatever you wanna be
If only if you just believe surely you can achieve
If you wanna be free or if you wanna be me
You could be O.G
But you should be a G-O-D
So BE

Verse 3
[Sene]
I said that's cool in the gang
You pullin' a few chickens
But i seen your contract
You missin' a few digits
No roughneck you just got a few (unclear)
Prob'ly only seen the precinct as a witness
My folks first son
Only go to sleep when works done
Knew i had your ear since verse 1
Don't cry when my hearse comes
Go get yours
Fuck 2 - go get 4
'til your fo'er (foyer?) got marble floors
Very important person
Never card(ed) at door
"calm down chief he's part of the tour"

[Blu]
YEAH AND AIN'T AN ARTIST AS PURE
BEHIND BARS LIKE ASSATA SHAKUR
SLAP COPS, PEACE TO ZSA ZSA GABOR
TELL'EM PARDON MY GORE
HAD FLASH BACKS STARTED A WAR
WHAT'A LOSS GOT CAUGHT INA STORM
SPORT A CROSS ON MY BACK
BETTER THAT THAN A BOSS ON MY NECK
TELL'EM SNEEZE CHEESE N COUGH UP A CHECK
BREATH EASE GODS IN AFFECT
EVERYBODY TALKING WHATS NEXT
DON'T GET YOUR NECK
SNAPPED
TRINA TALK BACK TO THE CHI-RO-PRAC-TOR
ACTOR
GET SEVERED IN HALF
BY A RAPPERRR
HAHA!

WASN'T EVEN FUNNY
WHERES MY MONEY
CAME THRU, TWO PLAYBOY BUNNIES ON MY ARM...


WHAT RHYMES WITH ARM?
(EXILE:) CHARM!

CHARM-SCHOOL FOR FOOLS
WHEN HE COME THRU, YOU LOSE!
MIC CHECK ONE TWO GET BRUISED!
HAHA!!"
