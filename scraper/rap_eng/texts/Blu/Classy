[INTRO]

[ Verse 1:Blu]

Dadada da da daaa
Kiss the sky in the middle of winter with you
Undercovers feeling like mid july
Take me up to cloud nine with chu chill with me well I twist the lye, twist the locks let me find the groove
I got modern bangers old soul and thought but I usally bump jazz or blues
Miles,marvin,curtis,thelonious monk books by sawwheel and langston Hughes
She probably thinking "who the fuck is that" the reasons why you trying to fuck with blu
She said "well really I dont listen to rap" I said I know thats why im fucking with you

[Hook:Blu]

Cause im a classy man, mahm ain't no regular players in here , less go less go [x2]

[ Verse 2:Blu]

Yo karmas a bitch excuse me for talking french, but I had no intentions of harming this chick
And even though I have in the past I never but my hands on her unless I was caressing that ass
I probably shoudln't even done that
Cause all that lead to was running calls back and its cool
But I ain't got a phone besides my house phone
And im usally gone so leave a message at the dial tone

[Outro:Blu]

Boop* fuck you blu , you think you can just fuck me and cut me off, ill will cut yo meat and make you *boop

[ Verse 2:Blu]
Psssh message deleted
You wonder why I see your emails and dont read it
Drama dont need it mama so beat it
Think I can't find another chick with your features?

[Hook:Blu]

Cause im a classy man, mahm ain't no regular players in here , less go less go [x2]

[ Verse 3: Blu]
Each one teach one
Some love and some cheat
Some run so far from the heart it don't beat
Some need love and end up mistaking it for lust
One day I gave it all up had to tell the brod hush
Never punched a lady cause the way im brought up
But girl you kinda crazy trying to play me for a chump
I let her put her hands on me once
Good thing I wasn't drunk cause I woulda left in cuffs
Cause fuck when love gets forced to something violent
Turns to tug of war and of course your invited
Turned up the beat to ignore her while im writting
She took my pad and threw it on the floor trying to fight me
Like the fire inside her was gone ignite me?
I was like please hit her with a nice breeze like "Peace'
Im outta this bitch you need god but I ain't got time for this shit

[Hook:Blu]

Cause im a classy man, mahm ain't no regular players in here , less go less go [x2]
