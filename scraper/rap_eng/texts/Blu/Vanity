There we go, there we go
I think we're live again
Yeah
Check it

[Verse 1: Blu]
All alone, unplug my phone
Back in the zone, been home but been gone
Prioritizing life in case I do not live long
And finally found some time to sit down and pen this song
Might as well try to tell you how I feel when I feel
And not just when it's time to pay some bills, life is real
You can miss it everyday, trying to get a little pay
Fill the page with some change
Try to feel a little change on my mind
I be thinking about the rain but
Sunshine shines everyday but hey
What can I say?
This is sunny California where the phoneys run up on you
Cause they want you to be just like them
I'm on the corner 'bout to get a swisher from the liquor store
Twist the dro, sit at home, pen a song
Call a chick, get some dome
Play my shit, when I roll
Cause nobody knows my mental like me
Open my window let you people get a peep, peep
My life is simple, yo they think the shit is deep. Sheep
Be sleeping on me cause I finally got some sheets. Please
That's for wifey not just hoes that want to ride me
Cause they like me when I'm riding the beat
"To each his own", niggas say. They gripping chromes
Splitting domes in they song, when
I just feel I'm pennin' a poem
Peace

[Chorus]
I can't believe they think it's (Vanity)
Even my peeps say it's (Vanity)
(They call it Vanity)
Just because I'd rather eat in peace
My life's been a bitch like this chick named(Vanity)
(They call it Vanity)
Sitting alone on my own dick is (Vanity)
And when I'm gone, "home sick" is just (Vanity)

[Verse 2: Blu]

Yeah
All alone
Back in the zone. No, wifey at home
Been home but ain't boned though
Threw a few dollars to her
Told her get her comb out my hair
Turn a square to a spliff and lift my dome in the air
Above clouds where the rain falls all inside my home
Like, pain colored paint balls
Call it what you want
Niggas laugh cause my faith strong
All I know is no one knows the places that I've gone
Or faces that I've seen cry, seen laugh, seen die
Seen eyes with my life in all of them
Seen signs of falling but I caught hope
Will in my wings, halo, I'll haul hope
To faith like a new black pope
Fuck a debate
I am dope when I want to be
And flow when I'm on the beat
I stroke when I want to; need to skeet
Fuck the streets
They will fuck you if you don't
"Keep your enemies and homies on the ropes
When they supposed to be close"
Poppa told me. And the few that know showed me the ropes
Hanging on dreams to be happy, whether lavish or lean
I've seen enough to make a boy die nappy
Now a man on a search for the God that I am
But actually I'd rather be me

Is that (Vanity)?
My poppa told me it was (Vanity)
My old lady said it's (Vanity)

[Outro]
Because I'd rather be all by myself
Instead of laughing with the crowd
If I don't care to be part of their gaiety
They'll often say to me, "Don't be so proud."
But how are they to know?
I'm looking high and low
For love that used to be my own...
