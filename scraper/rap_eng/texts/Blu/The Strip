[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
That's my space to park, yeah

[Verse 1: Blu]
And from the tip i’ve been down for the trip
Down for whatever, whenever but don't trip
Just don't get all sentimental with a nigga
Don't hit, I just won't get the rental

Tell me what it is

Frontin'
I'm a humble (?)
Settle but nothing, pushing a button
Whippin' a new honey, mustard, mother sips
Hit the switch
Ducking a bitch
Fuck the pigs
Still sit that turkey bacon on my eggs and grits

Still flip a bird

Cause you's a sucka
Never fell off, you trippin' nigga
My niggas don't slip
Don't picture no pigeons, no chickens,and no chicks

You know, the pimp man
Smoke another clip
Set on the sunset, strip
No money to get, the strip

We slip like bananas, panoramic vision was so sick

[Hook: Anderson Paak]
Shining!
I did it for the strip
Can’t you see me coming
Thick bitties in the buggy
Pitch black tinted windows
Sitting on the money clip (smoke something)

[Verse 2: MED]
With finesse on my BS
Spent three decks
Felt like a Phoenix, PS
Do it for the lex
G-check homie, you a defect
Set it off
Been a boss
No pimp
Up in the raw
Like magic (?)
My limp heavy
Heavenly dip

French, (?) clips

Thick with it from the get
Ass kinda (?)
She tell me and the clique


Now double on the rent
Show you why

Like Playa Mike
Told me if you, kill a killer
Then you save a life
Told her save the night
'For I hit the light
For what you want (?)

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Shining!
I did it for the strip
Can’t you see me coming
Thick bitties in the buggy
Pitch black tinted windows
Sitting on the money clip (smoke something)
It’s where you find me honey
Bending corners on the strip
And the crowd loves me
Same brothers that I grew up with
We come together like a black fist
(Smoke something)
That’s my place, my space to park yeah
Anywhere you want, no matter who you are
You can all get it
Let’s slide, lets slide to the west island
Let’s slide, lets slide we can all get there
No matter who are
Keep mashing get your money nigga
Hit the strip showing your whip off
Keep mashing get your money y'all
No matter who you are
