[Verse 1]
But make sure they call me GodLee
And I haven't been the same since
Genesis and it's just the beginning in this bitch
Heaven hasn't been the same since God found heaven
And the hell below, lift
No more jail cell for me, tell hell I'm free
Spit dark as my yellow pea, crisp
Drop the P in that (?)
Blu dot, tho I have to rock T dot
I have rocked spots and spots that rock
Push pop, pistol that pop
Wrist watch, that glow
Cold doctors that grow
Notorious BIG, victory to grow
Victorious sins
The world can be cold
Hold love close, fuck what it is
Reach for it and ask
God give but no, God take it away
Lord, may we pray so
Cause you know these streets ain't really that sweet to play no mo
Sweet (?) dont play no mo
Sweety, had the beast saved
(?) raps
Bad bored of rap
Mid 93, Shaq
Who's bored with rap
Meet me, beat (?)
Who's flair is dead
Tell 'em I already played the show

[Hook]
Feeling like Chris
Genesis and it's just the beginning in this bitch!
Hell fell like the rain during Spanish winter
And I'm finna get it warm in this
Feeling like Chris
But make sure you call me GodLee

[Verse 2]
Dance with me till the darkness, darling
I never really meant to seem heartless, doll
But I'm far from heartless, darling
Started as a martian, departed as a God
Lampin' on (?) where the women are
Living off flesh with enough left to drink it all
Speaking like a seminar, listen
Settle down, I told you I never settle down
So pardon if I'm coming off stealth
It's probably really hard for you to see me
See weeds and be floating through the ocean, no help
Put in a genius in a bottle for a genie to read
President open the message
Said don't push us close to the edges
And red ink script to the edges
And still ain't none of us collected
Cause niggas got they hands too tight to accept it
Except us, the rest collects dust
Connect, collect bucks or respect
Correct cuts
(?)
B.C., be real
Be still, be see, be ay!
Make sure you get the name straight
It's the GodLee, bitch!

[Hook]
Feeling like Chris
Genesis and it's just the beginning in this bitch!
Hell fell like the rain during Spanish winter
And I'm finna get it warm in this
Genesis and it's just the beginning in this bitch!
Don't forget to call me GodLee
