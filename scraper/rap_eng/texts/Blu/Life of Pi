[Intro]

[Hook: Rapsody]
Keep yo head above water my nigga, we all there
Keep yo head above water my nigga, somebody care about you

(Take it back like hockey jerseys, guest jeans, and butter Timbs)

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Yeah, yo, Richard Parker, spark up the mighty Pi
Like in the Y, MCA beast you today and forever
I never lost the love from a cub, I had to mistletoe
Kiss 'em goodbye, I cry but I don't miss 'em though
Mister Mos Definitely, Misses Recipe, what he made of?
All me, gave em everything, OV
O, October's very own, far from heaven
The cost is leavened bread
Death from the flesh I blessed the estimate
Another skin broken again, poking
Skins, it ain't me, just my friends, well fuck love
Try to take your mind off water for story
The hotels for coattails, everything
Still I really bring
Shine silver linings the lines looking for better
No matter what you've been through, I promise there's better weather

[Hook: Rapsody & Blu]
Keep yo head above water my nigga, we all there
Keep yo head above water my nigga, somebody care about you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep yo head above water my nigga, we all there
Keep yo head above water my nigga, somebody care about you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Blu]
Now you could dream a pretty pilot more colorful than a Pixar
Picture or live pixelated tryna place
Your puzzle pieces, pivot the pumpkin pie slices
Prism, the pinnacle pimp
Pinching pretty pennies for picnics while picking them profits
No prophet, nigga play me like humpty
While I stand and never fall on that wall, you box my pride in
Pride open the palm of the poet, holding my prize in it
Psalms open the palm of the hand, I hold a nine in
Song of the lost traveler's goodbyes
Private hellos, rubbin' elbows in the party
Pardon me for my pellfold
Part of me played his partner before he offered me jail clothes
Permanent black mark on my soul, dark or get charcoaled
Harder to hard his hurt over waters
Often I fell up on that same face, got washed off with lost grace
Why this talk and taste, 4 in the morning, when nothing fills you
Eating, but no one fills you at the bottom with the bass
You await, with a lion in your face, in the center of troubled waters
Repenting, knowing revenge is sweet
Falling on bending knees, praying you could taste a plate of victory
Knowing the credits after the mystery made history, nigga
(Take it back like hockey jerseys, guest jeans, and butter Timbs)
Blu

[Hook: Rapsody]
Keep yo head above water my nigga, we all there
Keep yo head above water my nigga, somebody care about you
