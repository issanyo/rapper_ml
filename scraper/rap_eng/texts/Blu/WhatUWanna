[Verse 1 - Blu]
It's like Cap Planet threw his Palm Pilot in the sea
Servin' earth, water, fire, and wind
We'll see; he'll be in around 3
Said the secretary carryin' a bag of secrets
That made him legendary
"Pleased to meet you" he said to each and every Godlee
John Gotti had to bury the body
With a shotty
Word to the squad of Shocklee
I be, Young Hoffy over hip hop beats
Tax free like a national free from all actual greed
Tall Statue, but I still talk at you, B
Native chief but a taboo tea smackin' apples out of Eve's hand
Standin' in the garden of Ed'
Bumpin' eon beauty in the beat on repeat
Any treason I be sleepin' on the sea ridin' waves like skis with rhymes
Might catch me on the Caspian castin' out a line
Eat fish, no swine, get swallowed like Jonah
Cuz she know the ocean flow is one of a kind - ask Noah
Polar bear cold stare smiles is so rare
File out ball-hogs that don't share the globe fair
Cold carry over crossover flow son, fuck Colbert I report to no one
Grown up young but I'm having adult fun
No funds holdin' up the joint with no gun, showin' up stunned
Cool as the fan smokin' blunts with a brew in my hand
With a plan and a shovel to plant it
And watch it grow all across the planet like I planned it;
Young Captain Planet

[Hook]
You can do what you wanna do but I'mma do mines'
Touch the mental with a pencil and a rhyme
And I don't need a gun to shoot cause ain't no where I'm runnin' to
Move all you wanna move, you know you feel the rhyme
You can do what you wanna do, we doin' just fine
Touchin' the mental with a pencil and a rhyme
And I don't need a gun to shoot cause ain't no where I'm runnin' to
Move all you wanna move, we know...

[Verse 2 - Blu]
We on that new height, talking like I grew like 8 inches
The roman numeral of great vision
I make predictions on the state of spittin'
Whack rappers will remain gettin' a gang of riches, lame bitches
I'm in the game lane switchin' - already late bruh
Got no time to hit the breaks or the switches
Blazed off the j's and the swishers - tobaccos for wack folk though
My black hope used to whisper
Shaytaan was all up in my face - god listen and John bitchin'
Mom wishin I'd stick with all the Christians
Sometimes I go to church just to toss my sins
At the altar we all fall victim to systems
Mine and this business, figures and interviews no time for interludes just to screw it up
Needing to use a buck without feeling like a jerk
For what it's worth I almost blew up
But I heard ya'll had to kick back wipe my shirk off
Was on my dick so tough I could've jerked off
The old head said watch the cursing
Losin' work cause' I'm thinkin' of my first job servin'
God every mornin'
Mournin' over earns with a burp feel and think about my friends as the earth spins
As we worship war ships on the spiritual war tip
Ya'll listen: We all up in this
Forfeit a joint with the forces and don't forget ya'll admission tickets
To get up in this, gotta break through the laws of physics
Simple as arithmetics
Twist Wisdom
Get lifted
