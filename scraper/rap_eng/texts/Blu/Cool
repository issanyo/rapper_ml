Chorus BOJ -
Its you i want oh sister Yetunde
I don day tell you since e no be yesterday
Mo ni pe, wa ba mi sere
Mi o fe ja rara, i just dey pray oh

Hook - It depends on you girl
It depends on you..
I day trip for you girl

Anytime that I’m not with you, i day lose my cool
Ha.. i day lose my cool

Verse 1 - M.A.K

Somebody help me i’m in love with Yetunde
Im thinking bout her every second everyday
I’m losing control she got me spending my pay!
And i don’t wanna see her love go away
I know you older but age is a number
If no be you then na who, i day wonder?
Gucci belt on my shorts in the summer
Back it up, feel on my anaconda
Girl stay down and keep it a hundred
Ill give you love and loyalty if you want it
I’m not taking advantage of you for the profit
And i can never judge coz no-one is perfect
I wanna lay my hands on you like a prophet
But man am just a human being far from a prophet
Let the people talk girl all they’re saying is nothing
I just want a piece of your sweet sweet loving forever

Chorus -
Its you i want oh sister Yetunde
I don day tell you since e no be yesterday
Mo ni pe, wa ba mi sere
Mi o fe ja rara, i just dey pray oh
No day delay oh..

Hook - It depends on you girl
It depends on you..
I day trip for you girl
I day trip for you
Anytime that I’m not with you, i day lose my cool
Ha.. i day lose my cool

Verse 2 -

Oh baby it depends on you
What do you want to do
We can make it last forever if you want it to
Anyway, Anywhere i go stay with you
I no dey lie when i tell you I’m involve with you
And girl i know you worried thinking that I’m playing a game
Its not a question girl I’m with you either sun or the rain
I wanna give you my all
The good the bad and the pain
Buy you Gucci everyday and make it clear you’re my main
I’m tryna paint a beautiful picture with you in the frame
And if i run out of colors ill use the blood in my vein
And if i leave you follow Monica i must be insane
Oh baby let me put M.A.K at the end of your name
You got me pooring out my emotions on extremes chords
And I’m obsessed with hearing your voice every time that I’m bored
I don’t know what life will be like without you in my world
Let me show you love is way more than a four letter word, yea!

Chorus
Its you i want oh sister Yetunde

Mo ni pe, wa ba mi sere
Mi o fe ja rara, i just dey pray oh
No day delay oh..

Hook - It depends on you girl
It depends on you..
I day trip for you girl
I day trip for you
Anytime that I’m not with you, i day lose my cool
Ha.. i day lose my cool
