[MED]
Stuck in the memory
Lost while forever sing
Songs stayin’ centuries behind you
Just remind us where we finna be
History repeats like, ex-men synergy
The life sippin’ Burgundy
Relax, she feelin’ me perhaps, rap
Tickle when she whistle; wet, I never leave ‘em chapped
Flicks like eyelash, photo-snap worthy but I pass
Stand behind the Flash like Gordan
Rappers floss cash, now they doin’ bad
Playin’ steeze, scrambled in the pocket McNabb
Run with it
Harassed by the thug
The fans want support
And the grams come up short
I’ll be damned on the fools
West coast rider now you know
If that ain’t the best, then the spot’s not occupied
Hard to fill a spot
Eff rap, I been bumpin’ Stevie Wonder all summertime
It’s my life

[Refrain]

Mom, I want to be a genius; John you can be a genius
Told the teacher give me brains and I blow ‘em out the speakers
Man jesus where the peace is?
No wear a Jesus piece
Jesus know the Greeks
Introduce me to the Greeks
Got the knowledge from a Pastor
Well, here’s peaks
I peaked after on the latter no one walked under my ladder
Doesn’t matter
Wifey took a block; pick a Saturn
I ain’t gonna lie yo, she then pulled a picture of Saturn
I said it’s fly with the ? Earth kiss the seed high
If this is rap, I go first like Busta Rhymes
Felt ya rhymes keep the bottom line to himself
Got honest, they lyin’ to theyself
Ya’ll ain’t lions
King, I am
Black and bling giant
Green tyrant, trees fire hydrant
Hydraulics
Soft side hittin’ switches hydraulics
Big body
He was a sob, shoulda drove a Saab
Gimme a Caddy
Call me Daddy and I never rhyme
Heart as steel with the hardest heart to still stop
Parted real like I’m partin’ Red Seas
Reds and the C's
Hennessey for G’s
Spend it please
Spend legal tender with ease
Since teens know employers coach teams
No Hoyas
Bridgetown met when BM dubs
We get in
We say we win
We get dubs just to talk yourself up another echelon
The upper edge you’re on, don’t push, just the message you on
Seven minutes, you on
Six minutes, you on
Five minutes, niggas is already on it
It’s your life

[Refrain]
