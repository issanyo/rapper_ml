[Hook: Jontel]
As I open up my eyes
And finally see the world
I discover victory
And the sun is in my face

[Verse: Blu]
Hey yo - Black and white cinema
Picture the profile with a black gold child
Back with a vengeance, from the rags to the riches
Reminiscin' back when this shit was mad twisted
If we rapped then they dissed it like it's crap
Cause they wish the height in blacks wouldn't grown but nah -
We takin' over game is over hit the door
We done made it out the gates, made a culture that you praise
Gettin' throwin' makin' videos to wave it in your face
Coldest days been as made men soldiers in the game
Then again it's probably payin' holdin' those you wanna brain
Like.. Things gettin' racist in the days of colored ganstas
We angels with dirty faces, fallin' off the pavement
If we ball good you paid us, if we talked hood you played us
But it's all good - They play us all day on they playlist
Get your brakes fixed
Breakin' chairs anytime they play this
Take it back where cultivated ages makin' papers
Fix your faces
The haters want to take us out to dinner now
Sit us down with shiny plates and make us feel richer now
Shit is foul as fuck and we finally makin' bucks
And the bills is gettin' paid, but - The shame is pilin' up
Get the picture now?
Well this is how you change that
Flip the style put it out and bang that, come on

[Hook: Jontel]
As I open up my eyes
And finally see the world
I discover victory
And the sun is in my face
As I open up my eyes
And finally see the world
I discover victory
And the sun is in my face

[Bridge: Blu]
It's that 'Ach shit
Ride with us
Dealin' with your boy Blu make money
The D is for the -
Los Angeles
Across land sit your pants stand up
Fly with us
Fly with us
Hot niggas ride through the sky with us
Fly with us
Fly with us
Hot niggas ride through the sky, come on
