[Verse 1: Blu]
Yo, Car swiped Susie for the gucci
Monica Bellucci with the cool G
Uh Yo, my bubble goose grey goose Hoochie
Slip my uzi in the movies like a roof
Excuse me
She say my new Steeze too inapprope'
I say new freak, Henny & a 2 liter Coke
Put the roach out
Niggas still doin' it tho
They tryna move keys better than a pianist compose
She say my single put that tingle in her nose
On the coast where the summer is the season for the snow
Yeah, the niggas ain't checking for flows
They sending dough
With the hoes like X's and O's
I've seen it all out my window
Watching asphalt grow
Uh, Reason my peoples
Keep a tall cam fold
In Los Ange', in the land
Where them camera's blow
The boss man even hustle hand in hand for the dough
Peroxide

[Hook: Pac Div + Dam Funk]
Bout to bubble like peroxide, layin' in a cut
All you need to know
(?) Is to be straight
Cause you know that we trues
And we don't fuck around
We stay fly
Without lie(?)

[Verse 2: MED]
Oh yeah I'm from CA, City of the Ox
Bang forward like doors in D.A
Heavy with the knock
Nigga you not fucking with the clique
Get the cops, shit
My sister beat the jury out the box
The block on smash with cash
You get rocked
Tryna' make bands like slash
Above hash
Flash on the dash talk trash 'till
Them Hefty bags filled with cash
She feel me on that feel nigga rap
For real, gold grill, chain every champ
The ill
Payback gold, get a ransom
Now we pick the finest cotton off the racks
Relax homie, still keep the flashlight
I can see me taking pictures in the past life
Why write it cause my mind right
You need iron like a bad dye
Fucking with the west-siders
Peroxide

[Hook: Pac Div + Dam Funk]
Bout to bubble like peroxide, layin' in a cut

All you need to know
(?) Is to be straight

Cause you know that we true
And we don't fuck around


We stay fly
Without lie(?)

[Verse 3: MED]
Laid in the cut like (?)

Hustle the same one
Flow dope like (?)
Buzzin', the reason why the males
We comin', 2 hundred for the shirt

Hustlin'
Like a  flat stomach
Who run it?
A fave color
I put my money on it
Dam-Funk over Madlib product
The rough beat, husky deep
Heavy in the trunk

Money bubble up
Off the block, when I post up

[Verse 4: Blu]
Post up, bubble in the cut
No struggle, shit crack
You bubblin' the butt
Get bags out the huddle
While you fumble on the hut
King (?)
Play the humble on the hush
From the jungle through the train line
Hustle through the great vine, day time
They heard
Like Jesus was on the main line
Nigga please, no need for them K9's
These got the (?)
With a great rhyme
Just stay lines
Drop the homie, but  I broke free

Like  a OG

Tryna make a buck

[Hook: Pac Div + Dam Funk]
Bout to bubble like peroxide, layin' in a cut
All you need to know
(?) Is to be straight

Cause you know that we true
And we don't fuck around


We stay fly
Without lie(?)
