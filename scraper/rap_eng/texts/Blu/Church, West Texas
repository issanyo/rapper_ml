[Intro]
And my God
You say you're listening but we all
Handle it different
And I admit that I'm flawed
So when I don't see you
I think nothing at all

[Verse 1] M.I
All I want is for you to be real
For you to be what they told me you’d be
When I couldn’t deal
With things that I shouldn’t feel
And thoughts that I shouldn’t think
But im singing about it still
I got singles that shouldn’t sink
But they do
Through & through I’m a sinner & this is proof
Realistic with this, im questioning
His existence cause who
Knows if he’s even listening
Nobody knows the truth
But they holding on to a remnant, exposing it to the youth
& im hoping that what im doing with vocals up in this booth
Is supposed to be why he put my here, why I open up to
All of you / im assuming that all of yall feel it too
That you won’t believe it but people got hope that all of its true
& I do too / am I a fool?
I know im the last one you should be listening to
Ive said it im hypocritical with it / with different views
Conflicted cause they killing each other over religion im confused

[Hook]
& my god
I know you say you listening but we all
Handle it different & I admit that im flawed
So when I don’t see you.. I think nothing at all
& when I don’t hear you I think its typical
Father forgive me for what im saying, im playing
I ain’t been the same since pain
So don’t be listening to me when I say
[This ain’t (x4) Faith] x2

[Verse 2] – Blu
Church
First off, niggas wipe ya shirk off
Dust the dirt up off of ya shoulders, brush ya shirt off
Cleanliness is next to godliness
I could try to pretend like im the godliest
But tell me, what would my goddess think?
I don seen the clink, seen niggas with no religion
Search for god just because of them situations they been in
When your backs against the wall, who you call?
I look at my 2 fist clenched, ready to brawl
I ain’t never had to crawl, I ain’t never finna fall
You can bring all of your squads & squad cars to box with the laws
But when gravity fails you, & hell is saying ‘hello’
And the halo lost the angel that rocked it, how does your day go
I just think about the mothers in church that put in work
So we can find some peace without finding it under dirt
I told my mama it’s a time bomb beating under my shirt
I be ready to burst but god knows I squirt first
So I murked out / Instead of murkin a ignorant verse
I pulled a verse out the good book when I wasn’t at church
I said fuck ho’s, fuck whips, fuck gold & all that
Now I see that god is everything, I want it all back

[Bridge]
I want it all, want it all (x2)
Aay, we sinning over here but
God is everything
I give him the benefit of the doubt
But my god
