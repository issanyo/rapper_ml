[Verse 1: Blu]
And we back like cartoons after commercial
I told Warner let me sign Universal
I hear niggas need work like WWE need shirts
Get the first and get back to me
Bro, we exactly
Rhyme local, but the flow go global
International, accept cash and collateral
All latitudes, niggas with automatics
Just to keep the acronym accurate
Slow motion to the avenue
Traffic, I ain't mad at it
And I got a new bad bitch
My switch cracked it
Mr. Magic
Miss a magic
Get attracted
Get that ass right quick
My shit classy
I like it lavish
Everlasted
Bass blasted out the 808s
My game Gatsby, the great gangster banging
But get real like Banksy at the bank, bitch

[Hook: Blu]
Ayo, I never watch cartoons on Sunday because I was always thinking 'bout making money on Monday
Never watch cartoons on Sunday because I was always thinking 'bout making money on Monday

[Verse 2: Blu]
Cold crush on the bus shit
You ain't touched yet, trust that
One flip to the remix, run that
Hundred stack, bunch of crack, bundle bag humble rap
Never was a hustler rap
Never brushed a shoulder that wasn't colder
Bro, she rolled the blunt in front of you
No way, I showed her that
Chauffeur at the laundromat
Chronic wrapped, liquor and roger that
Po-po on the Dodgers cap, pop it back
Papa ask what I do Sunday
I said besides make money?
Probably cop a strap
He said what
I said I'm kidding, you was tripping
The po-po on the floor [drippin' out blood], it's nothing really
I'm fucking Diddy
I run the city
Or I a bust it, get a lift from somebody, borrow money
Fuck a broke flow, operas to the coke flow, cold flow muted over Bugs Bunny
Dope, bro
