[Intro: OG]
But the shit that I'm giving coming right from the source...
Good and bad
'Cause like I told you
Nigga can talk all that shit they wanna talk
Bout this street shit this, this street shit that
But at the end of the mothafuckin' day 'cause...
It's cold
It's dark
It's lonely
And it's a miserable muthafuckin life
BNYX

[Verse 1: Miles Chancellor]
Feel like I got everything ahead of me except a nigga
A lot these guys attachment 1 image. it ain't no message in it
As a adolescent they tried to stress to me in that it's best to listen
But you only get what we have here cause I never listened
Momma said you never listen, I do
She my biggest inspiration
Pay attention, every gem, every phrase
Go through phases, til' I hit the next stage
When she see it she amazed
I'm no angel, but you couldn't tell by my wingspan
They on angles, so much politics, I think I need C-SPAN
I don't have no sympathy for niggas tryna move like me & fracture sumn
'Cause You ain’t doing a fraction
The work I put in with faction
And imma reap the satisfaction
You niggas' average
I remember high school it was me in this shit
Five years later niggas joking bout leaking my shit
Youngins come up to me tell me they be needing my shit
Ole heads really feel me but they don’t be streaming & shit
OG never steered me wrong, but I had to get the crash course
The food for thought saved us, everything we ate was bad for us
I knew niggas ready to die for real
They just labeled them niggas Bad Boys
They never considered the pickings is slimmer for niggas
Well, I’m sure that they but that just the system for niggas
Provoking them criminal tendencies & I hope it don’t get the best of me
A method to my madness and I got mad methods
Sturdy shit nigga, we ain’t gon half step it
I bake before I have breakfast, and it last seconds
Been burning the candle from the first and last ending
Is that reckless?

[Chorus: Miles Chancellor & BLŪ]
Can’t put much past you
Got my demons too
She not no angel
Not to angel
No not at all
Them boys on angels
On that same old why get involved
They tryna keep me in that same place I got my start
No angel at all
Land on clouds from stars
Stand my ground when wrong

[Verse 2: Miles Chancellor]
Slime told me she remember when we were kids I used to be different
Like I was more happy or
I guess you'd remember better, she said I start drifting
Seeing me in my bag these days, that remind her how I used to be
When we spent that time recently
When I was starting my last LP
She brought out the best in me
West End Chza, put that on my block
Key to success gotta put shit on lock
They freed Thon though, they freed Thon
Everybody say it wit' me right now they freed Thon
Nigga put me up on so much game
I'm able to bring back to y'all
Prayed on the daily for my dog
I had to go check up on his mom
Them people tried to define who he is
But we get that bag on em, and paper  take you off the grid
Niggas' swearin' they got game for sale
I don't say nothing, imma let you play yourself
I'ma make it hard for you to embrace yourself
Only advice I could give you young bull is just brace yourself

[Verse 3: Anyee Wright]
I ain’t never gon doubt myself again
I can’t let nobody who hurt me in
I'ma change the world one step at a time
Claim what’s mine
And find the truth behind my destiny
And all I want is real 'round me
All I ask is you to pray 'bout me
I wish I could see where Imma be
When I'm about thirty-three
Success for me
But I gotta get on it
I’m learning how
Something  left to figure out
What Life’s about
Don’t blink eyes
You might miss something
Everything happen so fast when you put it on the line, whoa
Momma told me go for what’s mine
And I ain’t never in it for the eyes, no
Gotta keep my faith on cruise control
So I can go harder than I ever know
If I don’t move forward then I’ll never know
Never know

[Chorus: Miles Chancellor & BLŪ]
Can’t put much past you
Got my demons too
She not no angel
Not to angel
No not at all
Them boys on angels
On that same old why get involved
They tryna keep me in that same place I got my start
No angel at all
Land on clouds from stars
Stand my ground when wrong

[Outro: BLŪ & Lucas Wolfe]
Yeah, no, no
No angel, no angel
No, no angel at all
No angel at all
No angel at all, all, all
Oh, yeah
You know I ain't no angel
We both know you ain't no angel
No angel
