[M.A.B. Freestyle Verse]

Came from the bottom where the punk niggas die, (Look)
Came from the bottom yet a nigga end up fly. (Look)
I be on my grind, tryna get some suicides
While some shit be on my mind, that'll cause a homicide. (Look)
Where my friends now, to tell me slow it down?
Needin 8 hands just to break it all down
The way that I be liven, can't you tell a nigga live?
Laugin to the bank, while you silly niggas jive
Lil dancin ass, turkey 'lookn ass, I'll murk your ass!
Lookin at my path, you hurt and mad because I worked and passed?! Huh?!
Lil nigga stop loafin!
I be out Ballston, you niggas out boastin!
Tryna get on, while you lost in the moment
Bring your girlfriend, then I'm lost in her gourmets
Tryna go hard, but you soft and you know this!
Tryna get on, while you caught in emotions!
Ugh, Lil Nigga straight bogus
Gotta loco chick who's flower's a lotus
Gotta MoCo chick who thrives for the potent
Man, she Oh So thick, so she must be from Georgia
Gotta SoHo crib, she tells me come over
Her love is an art, when I'm drunk and I'm sober
Lend me your heart, then I'm ended up ownin
Where did we start? I don't know we was rollin
You must've forget that I'm young and I'm on it
We both go to sleep at 10 in the mornin
But only a sec, girl I live like I'm wanted
Grew up with Lisa's, Spit game to Mona's
But Morning Critique showed her breathe was too mournin
Now I'm straight Jonin', Back then i want it
Back then I did want it, Now she hot, the block got it
Darling now you cautious, Now I'm back to ballin
I show you lil niggas how to tax a fuckin foreign
The shit you niggas bumping now is wack and fuckin borin
M.A.B. got some stacks now from tourin
Selling raps like they Jordans
And sense the wisdom of a Tortoise Nigga!
Yea, and now that I'm here, Hip Hop is never at a fuckin shortage nigga!! (Yeah!)

Saint Lui in this bitch Goâ€¦
