[Verse 1: Blu]
Blu!
Blow that indo out
Let me get in your mouth
Yeah, let me get in your house
Let me sit on your couch
Yeah, let me feel on your crotch 'til I hear you go ouch
(Yeah) Let me turn you out
Let me burn you out
Yeah, she don't wanna bounce
She just wanna count days
Each day that I be getting paid, she be getting laid
She be feeling made
She wanna get a maid
She don't wanna leave
She just wanna bathe
You could sell the water that she wash in
Talking about flossing
I'm talking 'bout bossing
I'm talking 'bout tossing ass back to Boston
Back, back to Slauson
Back, back to Orange
She don't wanna go home no more
She just wanna throw dough
Wanna go, go
Wanna hold on 'til she can't no more
I don't blame those same ol'
No gray day
No nine-five talking 'bout a payday
Talk about AK, spray gay
Make you wake up, get your cake up
Black coffee

[Hook: Dave Dar]
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(It's percolating, percolating)

[Verse 2: Blu]
I'm just trying to make cheese
Make dreams come true, nah'mean
Tryna make that green
Make greens like grandpa do
Let me get in your head, get in your bed
I don't give a fuck what such and such said
Tell such and such that or such and such this
Tell such and such ...
All I want to do is win
Take you to the Wynn
Get a bite to eat then her to the gym
Flip on that mattress
Pull out that actress
Pull a hat trick, silly rabbit going in
Making magic with a friend
Half on a [?], half on the Lambo making them ends
Make you feel bossy no matter what it cost me
In a loft lofty, you can smell the blend
Black coffee

[Hook: Dave Dar]
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(It's percolating, percolating)

[Verse 3: Blu]
You could smell that Folgers sitting in air
Sitting with her legs folded posing in a chair
Sipping them beans
Blowing that steam
Blowing that tree while she pouring my drink
I be thinking 'bout money every day of my life
She be thinking about seeds, being my wife
She could be that breakfast, lunch, that supper
Filling them downs, she could be my upper
Touch her like I love her, touch her like I love her
Touch her like I never put another one above her
Put her in that deep sleep, sweet dreams slumber
Just to wake up all alone under covers

[Hook: Dave Dar]
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(Percolating, percolating)
First thing when we wake up
(It's percolating, percolating)
