Ayo take a bow, kiss the sky
Lifting money, lit as a kite
I’m living my life and never missing a flight
Man I’m tryna stay down to earth but them boys too high
They too high
Too high, look man they too high
They too high, they too high
Yea I’m tryna stay down to earth but them boys too high

(Verse)
Yea uh, hey kid walk straight, maps to my heart, state of livin'
Sober down my brain, get to trippin'
On a plane, no luggage at all
4-20 flights, after that I’m out for the night
I light it hit with no pass, nuts got a nigga crash
Black and blue motherfucker, blues brother go fast
7 grams, no bad kush, promo swag
Fine told me for the back grew up blowing the stash
As for the blendo, endo, pretendo
Sho nuff Leroy Green watched the pen glow
Last dragon, my suicide info
Smoking but I shut the window

(Verse)
Man get talkin to yo brain, get swollen and takin flight
I got no weed left but you could bet I’m alright
All night up in the dressin to this level of life
Close my eyes when I’m tryna find what heaven is like
I keep my own vision of the sky limit livin' mended
I ain’t gotta smoke trees to speak bluntly
Swisha sweet in front me
Wanted when them old spirits haunt me
I don’t even seen the lyrics, I just hum it
Country in my stomach when no butterflies layin' low
City stay with me but I’d rather let my mans go
Lost tranquility, I sit and lit a candle
My feet stay planted so you shouldn’t have to ask what I stand for

(Hook)
Ayo take a bow, kiss the sky
Lifting money, lit as a kite
I’m living my life and never missing a flight
Man I’m tryna stay down to earth but them boys too high
They too high
They too high, man they too high
They too high, they too high
Yea I’m tryna stay down to earth but them boys too high

(Verse)
Elevated 365 with the skyline bright
Most of yall just only fly by night
Those longevity know to bring me heat to yo box, rock steadily
All across the globe, rip shows, compose melodies
And say the flow’s heavenly
No point if they say they hot
It’s the perception I give you with the scots
And if the move is illucrative then you coulda slide
See I gotta this loot to survive
I stay true to the rhyme as a reflection of self
The music and the essence of my presence is felt
Like rough turbulence, aliens known as definite mass like turned services so
Peak the servant in the word I give

(Verse)
I know I’m wrong, how I live before the victims seeing
Look for ways to leave the hood as they boxin me in
Nowadays many gone names blow in the wind
And build me up just to feel them a teach of the wind
Place some people in the system to control with the spin'
Bust some cats like me to have to hustle for ends
I can count too many times I was stuck in the airplace
I never should’ve made it alive
Now I think of how the good dying cowards survive
Lost some homies so it’s tears in my eyes
Can you hear from the sky? Peace God, please send a reply
For the vibe and now I’m feeling a rise

(Hook)
Ayo take a bow, kiss the sky
Lifting money, lit as a kite
I’m living my life and never missing a flight
Man I’m tryna stay down to earth but them boys too high
They too high
They too high
Too high
