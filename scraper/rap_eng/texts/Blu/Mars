[Hook]
Yes indeedy wrote graffiti on the bus
Now I'm on the cusp
Ok, so hush
Hey, grown man talk don't interrupt
Tell her where ya been
Jake sitting on the cuffs
Making all the distant stars dust

[Verse 1]
Hey yo yo trust taht we go
Where no man been before
Deep as any seashore
High off the trees
Those the purple of diesel
I debone decoys
Surrender my peace in a circle of emcees
Surrounded by B-boys and Cali chiefs
My words are like weapons, I direct 'em when I speak
Kapish and kush blunts
Quiche for lunch, eat rappers like takeout
About once a week, bout to make it once a month
Hibernating in the cut
Sleepwalking, writing raps dreaming about counting bucks
But still busting free for my peeps
When we bump into each other on the street
Cause we do it for the love, just to bust over
Beats, rhymes, and life
When it gets together dog it sounds so nice
Ain't it right
Tell Mr. Jones it ain't dead it just came back home
Had to paint black poems for a fake flat world
Trying to take back rap like a lost black girl
While the whole world naps and the sunshine showers
Sittin' on hills counting down final hours
Thinkin' bout if I ruled the world
And I already got the power

[Hook}

[Verse 2]
See I found God within me
Now we kick free sipping on a bottle of Hennesey
Blazing Christmas trees on a cloud of infinity
Blank out, and forget the crowd is with me
Forgive me, my energy can't be gangster
I wanted to be a painter, but I decided I should live a life of danger
Remind me Pops to thank ya before I cock the chamber
Aim it at the top spots and cock-blocking haters
Block, Block my Glock shot the inner heart
Cause one day I got high and mistaken for a shark
Pardon me doc, why isn't my artistry (?)
Everytime I bring reference to a broad on my jock
Cars on my lot
All my money balled in a knot
Would niggas rather hear me rapping about harvesting crops
Probably not
Honestly I'm trying to be dope
That's being modest, I ain't trying to be broke
Thats on my momma
Trying to figure how do we cope with all the drama when theres so much
