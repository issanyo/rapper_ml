[Intro]
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Just another day, another day

[Verse 1]
They say rap's like a trap
So I'm looking for the map to the back door
Sometimes I sit and wonder what the fuck I'm rapping for
So many cats more talented
That never had a chance in it
Not to mention niggas tryna damage it
Cold hearted vandalists
Fucking up the culture
They acting like it's kosher to rap for the advantages
Making the game scandalous
Stranded so far from the art
You start to wonder if they ever was a fan of it
I'm digging in the crates with the candles lit
Looking for a record to describe my anger so I can sample it
Condense my feelings into sixteen bars
And try to sugarcoat my quotes so they won't seem raw
And I can tell what you folks' dreams are
Cus all the video shows
Is hoes jocking
Niggas knocking on cars
Now the young'uns want a piece of the pie
So the devil let's them starve and start feeding em lies
Now try to digest that
And you wonder why we buy stress sacks
To shit out what niggas
Dish out without Ex-Lax
I'm trying to get outta the west coast, Blacc
It's a bad place
To raise fam
And I'll be damned if I ever get back
Where shit's at now
It'll make Martin Luther shake his head
And sit back down
Like these niggas had the same dream
And Malcolm X would wonder
All y'all are on the same team
The way these fiends keep
Droning on in the mainstream
The lame thing about it
The same teams that bought it
Probably skipping this song
Build the walls around the ignorance
Defending what's wrong
Instead of fighting for freedom
That's why I only write in what I believe in and nothing less

[Verse 2]
I shoulda listened when my Moms told my ass to stay in class
Shoulda listened instead of ditching to get a little ass
Or maybe I shoulda listened to my Pops when he told me hip-hop won't do shit
But keep me on the block
Or maybe I shoulda listened to my niggas pitching rocks
Cause they pushing nice whips from cooking white bricks
Or maybe I should be like my uncle
That nigga be pimping White chicks
But none of em lead a life like this
It's like the right do righteous
To try to stay the fuck out of hell
But me, I'm tryna stay the fuck out of jail
Cause I can smell trouble coming my way
Plus there's so many reasons a nigga want to keep a gun to his waist
It don't take much to make him pull out
Cause niggas die for they rides, money and broads or calling the wrong hood out
And suckers still tripping on colors like a motherfucking racist
My cousin was banging at my Aunt's cookout
It's a full-out war and I don't know who to listen to
I thought rap was a positive gap I could get in to
But nowadays you gotta bust a cap if they dissing you
Either that or be labeled a bitch cause you didn't shoot
It's hard to pick and choose right from wrong
Like if you rap about freedom, nobody likes your song
But do a track about cheating, bitches will play it all night long
I don't get it why the righteous fall
Like my ex used to bump Xzibit and her favorite line was
I be catching bitches while bitches be catching feelings
Yet she don't want me tricking around
See, she idolize the lifestyle but don't want none of it going down
It's kinda like these phony clowns thinking they hood dwellers
Acting Mafioso cause they seen Goodfellas
Now they running through the hood yelling Blu is bucking rounds
Bet you're giving your attention to me now
