[Intro: Mayer Hawthorne]
Can you feel the buzz?
Feel it baby, love

[Verse 1: MED]
Look, yeah she got her head on right
Must thank the queen that gave her life, yeah
No flaw, few scars like beauty marks
New car, good job, know she got
Good, good scarf with a skirt
Some they say looks is a curse, you
Make them hate all when they works
Talk with a flirt
Accents and asserts
Church girl, came live, heard about y'all
Good girl till them lights go off
One hit, got me starin' at the light switch
And man, she, she got me hooked like Catfish
Face of a actress, caramel, delight fine
But the mind so attractive
Damn, yeah, here's the digits, love
When she called up, I knew she feel the buzz

[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
I'm buzzin' cousin
And I feel okay
She got that real good lovin'
The kind that make you say
Oh, Oh, Woah
The kind that make you say
Oh, Oh, woahh, woahh

[Bridge]
When my world was falling down
You came around, yeah baby
Pick me up, and dust me off
And I was on the ground, yeah

[Verse 2: Blu]
Yeah all she wanted was the, (Uh)
Swear to God, all day put it on repeat with the iPod
So love, put that shit away, when you on the job
No love, niggas need a break from the fake stay awake
Fuck a chase, when I'm on my way to cake
Them niggas lost tryin' to boss with that little face
What she feelin' ain't the lyrics or my tape
What I'm killin ain't the instrumental
Go get them rentals for them sentimental dates
We linkin' continentals ah, thinkin' 'bout our issues
With them pistols on the lake
Initials on the place read; "Something Vibrates"
Told her, bow face love you fuckin' with a great
Special like a 38, bezel with the pearly lace
She never puff, cause it take her to a whirly place
I told her chill, I always roll a double up
So when she hit it, I knew that she could feel it buzz, word up
