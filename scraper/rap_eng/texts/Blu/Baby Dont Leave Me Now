Please
[Verse 1:Blu]
Just the sound is humbling
Each dog eats dog each day wondering
How come she left
What has become of me?
Fumbling the ball but it all comes tumbling down (damn)
But picks up (ok)
If only he could keep his bottom lip up (how)
Ship-shape up but git your cake up (why)
Cause if you don’t pretty hoes won't date ya (Ooohhhhh)

Stuck up in the minors thinks he’s the major
Also thinks the finer things in life are man created
So he sees a pretty face
And yea he chases it
After he unmasks her he says he couldn’t face it i-mean take it
Mistaked her as a vase and he breaks it
She never put her heart back together again
She’s been through a few stormy weathers
But she gets to take her sweater whenever she’s with him

Then again he was never there
She was always lonely but he would never care
The best times in life he had would never share
But she never cared cause her best times in life were with him
Wow what a friend
He says we should just- that’s how it ends
At least they pretend till the weekday begins
And the next thing you know the kids are tryin’ to make amends
Look it just goes in cycles
The way Bobby Brown fucked up like Michael
She plays the psycho
He hates the title
So every arguments like a soap opera recital
Now
It seems love tainted the vows
Because love turned into a word he couldn’t pronounce
Scene
She never grew up
He was just a child
Before it was pure
Then it all came tumbling down
