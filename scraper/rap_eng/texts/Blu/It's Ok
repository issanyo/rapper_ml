[Intro: Blu]
This right here's
A feel good song
So no matter what you're going through
Feel good!

[Hook: Blu]
I say they wake me up every morning
They got me hustling from dusk till dawn
I said I rarely get to see my sunshine
And all I really tryna do is sing her a song


[Verse 1: Blu]
See all I wanna do is drink all night
Smoke all day, party with my peeps
Till some pussy come my way
Hit it all night, flown by the day
I gotta make papes, cause money make us live
I gotta work, but I rather write a verse
Reminds me of the times I had to write for church
And all I really wanted to  do is watch toons
Turn my boombox for notching (?)
Pulled a dummy move, dropped out of school
Started working at a mom and pop shop, selling shoes
Started jacking Jordans, of course I got fired
But then I got hired at a warehouse storage
Quick before I even got me my own check
Next was a  pharmacy  gig
And they gave me my own desk
All I did there was write rhymes and watch porn
Got bored, got signed and I started touring like..

[Hook: Blu]

[Verse 2: Myth]
Reminiscing of my own lady, whole shady
Drinking off in front of both babies
So I had to think about a remedy
For me to face reality
Cause we became casualties, love was a battlefield
Of course she had a feel by lying at my face
Keep the thighs by the waste
How much time I wanna waste
All this time I been straight
I tell myself (it's okay)
I guess losing love is like slow pain
Or taking walks in the rain
Cause there's no sunshine left
I know for us there was no more time left
And now the sunshine's best
When he's riding solo, doing his thing
Times are much better due to the change
Honestly, and all this hard (?)
Blows out of me
It's gotta be a natural response
Cause love is gardened and tarnished
He crying ... garments (?)
Soon as  I pick up the phone and call
It's gonna be okay

[Hook: Blu]

[Verse 3: Definite]
As I wake up from my slumber in an elevated stance
Tempting to dance, music got me in a trance
Playing traps on my favorite CD's
From my favorite emcees
No longer feeling empty in this spot filled with enemies
Catch me
As I look up to the skies, Below The Heavens
My soul is swelling, pocket full of (?)
Telling that man to kiss my ass
I go by so fly, I try to be
But I never even know why
I be trippin sometimes, I still rhyme
And do time, find a way to move man
With the rhyme, yes indeed
See, indeed these words were never truer
Ay, it's okay cause I'm spitting  with the flu
Most definitely as I hang up in them streets, daps to my peeps
So free from the east to the west coast
Holla at ya boy man, big ups to all my folks

[Hook: Blu]
