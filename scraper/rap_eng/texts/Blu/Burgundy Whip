[Hook: Jimetta Rose]
It was a burgundy whip
And it was something to see
He had me up at the wheel
And he would fuck with the beats
It was a burgundy whip
We know, we know
And it was something to see
We know, we know
He had my roll down the window
We know, we know
And he would blow out the weed
We know, we know
It was a burgundy whip

[Verse 1: Blu]
Buck 5th and a hugable dip on the flip
And it was hugging the strip
Puffin a stick, whipping something legit on a bitch
Kibbles and bits for the way you got missed
While we was, tryna get what we could get and got rich
Thank God nobody got hit or got pinched or got
Body the hit without a shotti to grip, I got
Just a few tryna get on the flip with the flu
Spitting the sick shit we been through
Benz with the tint, no roofs on the coupe
Friends with the two door, swoop on the loop
Had 'em on the clue calling two more through and it's true

It was a burgundy whip
And it was something to see

And he would fuck with the beats
It was a burgundy whip
We know, we know
And it was something to see
We know, we know
He had my roll down the window
We know, we know
And he would blow out the weed
We know, we know
It was a burgundy whip

[Verse 2: M.E.D.]
Roll in, like waves in the ocean coastin' we
Wait, sun rays, pretty babes open
Moisten like Hostess Cakes, life, being what you make
Let's make it, yeah, wait for nothing to live, yeah
Something to spend in this, up in this bitch
Hey, listen mo', indent space for the 'centric
Hop in the whip with a piff lit
Go, dipping through the one way
Swoop, maroon moon burgundy coupe
Flew past hands through the deuce through the moon roof
Cruise alone, got the cell phone
Find peace with the owner of the inner home

We know, we know

We know, we know
And he would blow out the weed
We know, we know
It was a burgundy whip
