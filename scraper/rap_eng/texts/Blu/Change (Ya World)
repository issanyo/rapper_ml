[Intro: Blu]
You should be ashamed
Throwing dirt on my name  like we ain't the same
Like we ain't on the same plane
Like your brand is worth more than change
Makes you wonder why you look at it like
Like one big game
Play around, play around

[Verse 1: Blu]
And by the way I got a message from the future past
It said if you want your loot and your computer back
Learn what to do with that and
Quit producing trash
And stupid shit
Like you student in a foolish class
You use money cause you don't know what to do with grass
Blowing green like the leaves when it's sunny
As sweet as the honey asks the bees about butter baby
What a lady and you treat her like she fucking money
Like she ain't a lady
Don't be dummy, dummy
You think you ain't returning after you done that shady
And you  worry about owing someone money
You must be fucking crazy, or you must be running from me
And it's funny that you think you running me
But humbly look up, all you see is the sun
B-L just keep it in the fucking seat
I'm only saying one thing, stop

[Outro: Blu]
Just change, making money (?)
Wondering when the change came
Same loot stay the same
What's the difference when it all feels
Swing around, play around
Sorry brother, but I'm getting mine
Living my life through these frames
To change.. we can do it if (?), no playing games
Change..change
