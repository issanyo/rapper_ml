[Intro]
Yah yah
Yah yah

[Chorus]
I like counting hunnits every day
I can't love no thot you bitches lame
Your girl like an uzi when she spray
I put heavy metal on my waist
X2

[Verse]
I like counting bands but I lay low
Tell that hoe not to touch my bankrolls
I like mixing colors like a rainbow
I need lots of syrup in my faygo
Counting racks I'm flipping bands I don't know
Living fast I'm gripping cash I'm counting dough
Flexing all these diamonds I got new stones
Keep on calling bitch you get the dial tone
Pouring all this syrup I got percs too
There ain't no telling where we going too
Slipping in a coma I can't feel shit
Got your bitch she's bumping all my new shit

[Post-Chorus]
No joke
Really on the floor
Really counting money baby yeah I'm with your hoe
Really no joke
Think I need a Porsche
Pouring up the Henny baby go get me some more

[Chorus]
I like counting hunnits every day
I can't love no thot you bitches lame
Your girl like a uzi when she spray
I put heavy metal on my waist
X2
