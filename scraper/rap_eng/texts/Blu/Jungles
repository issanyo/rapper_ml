[Verse I: Blu]
Yeah, word up, uh
Something weird no king could’ve dreamed of
Path took me to shookers and fevers
Ain’t no killers here other than me, sir
Clean cut in a 9-6 beamer I let'cha queen touch [?]
Self-made, pay a son-of-a-bitch
And all the hoes holler (he ain’t shit), word up
Track kills still running your kicks
We go the block party already lit
Bob Marley with the spliff
Jumping like hard bodies with the switch, then it hit
Just step, throwback they couldn’t forget
It’s kinda like, ha, bacon set with eggs and grits
We got the bay chicks feeling the vibe, word up
My LA town chick right be by my side
And she pop like a word with the nine
We make it, we make it
For the heat coming out of the ride it's that

[Chorus: Black Shakespeare]
Big sound in a continent trap
Bust caps if we under attack
The smoke overload in the shed
We in the jungle, the herbalist hustle
Who do refuse MED, big Blu
Meanwhile the women roll up the bamboo
King of kings, pharaohs to Zulus
Living in the jungle

[Verse II: MED]
Tell me how you want to get served
Over beats or take it to the curbside
Nothing but a word, prefer
Perform hard bodies send shoties like Big Worm
I’m not where I earn, confirm
Hot perm won’t know you wet till you feel it burn
Hard fetch, who all slept, won’t freight
That’s when you wipe your nose from the cold sweat
Till we run the door first, door sets
Snub nose looking like a fat nigga, no neck
Big shot will make the freaks hot
Hollow pops, lord of the headboard knock, uh
She step out the shower on fox (so soft)
Everything you doubted now haunts
The Ox, hot with the nine
We make it, we make it hot
Feel the heat coming out of the box it's that

[Chorus: Black Shakespeare]
Big sound in a continent trap
Bust caps if we under attack
Lift that smoke coming out of the chairs
We in the jungle, the herbalist hustle
Who do refuse MED, big Blu
Meanwhile the women roll up the bamboo
King of kings, pharaohs to Zulus
Living in the jungle
Lord have mercy
