[Verse 1: ScienZe]
Well, I guess I'm making love to this phone
Field goals on my mind while I'm stuck in the snow
I want to kick it with you
Dust it off as we go
But you keep moving that ball, like the call wasn't yours
So peace, peace boo
Holla when you ready to go
I heard Sally want to grab me as a full time Joe
I may be with it if she with it
Keep a full time ho at bay, hey
She calling the plays and I'm game
Word
They call me Linus, charmer at its finest
Stress ever mindless as a philosopher and stylish
Prone to nostalgia
Baby blue sheet up on the futon that I drag from the kitchen eating croutons
And OJ
Ol√©
Your flattery is okay, but
Step it up a notch, show me off, show me spots
Introduce me to your friends
Get a comb, twist the locks
While my homie plays Sebastian Bach
Schroeder style

[Hook]
Everybody gets lonely at the end of the day (but hey)
Ain't that what they say
I heard it's hard to let go with your pride in the way (but hey)
Ain't that what they say
Love jones tend to be right under your nose (but hey)
Ain't that what they say, Ain't that what they say
Ain't that what they say, Ain't that what they say
Ain't that what they say, Ain't that what they say

[Charlie Brown]
Why, oh why do I let her do this to me?
Why, why?
Maybe she's right, this time I'm really going to kick it
I'm going to kick the habit! This is the end of all my faults!
AGHHH!

[Lucy]
And now, for the surprise

[Verse 2: Blu]
Yeah, word up
This is living when living is lie
Living is love, living is life
Whatchu living it for?
I'm living for life
Give me a life
I would close my eyes and give it to Christ
Buddhu, Muhammad, Noble Drew Ali
Elijah Muhammad
Martin, Malcolm, Master Fard Muhammad
Give it to God, Jah
Give it to Allah
Give us a new law, new love
My new love
Never knew who I was, love
Was love, I touch, bust, fuck, love once
Wants lust
Send my condolences
Tell my emotions I been eloping
I'm in love with love
I've been evoking all the dopest shit I'd never spoken
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
Crush your melon open with another note
On another note, dopest
Super Cali nigga
Rapping the dopest
Love love, third power devour cowards with love
Rain showers 'til we gain back what was ours with love
Yup, yup

[Hook]
Everybody gets lonely at the end of the day (but hey)
Ain't that what they say
I heard it's hard to let go with your pride in the way (but hey)
Ain't that what they say
Love jones tend to be right under your nose (but hey)
Ain't that what they say, Ain't that what they say
Ain't that what they say, Ain't that what they say
Ain't that what they say, Ain't that what they say

[Lucy]
Here you are, Charlie Brown!
Now, I'm going to run through this at slow motion
Now, see the look of determination on your face?
Oh sham, Charlie Brown. A failure face if I ever saw one
In turn, see how benign and composed my face is, Charlie Brown?
And your clumsiness, Charlie Brown!
Shall we run through it once more at normal speed?

[Charlie Brown]
No, no I don't think so
