[Refrain x2: Blu & Ta’Raach]

I don’t rock parties
I drink Bacardi
See me in the club, with a gang of shorties
If they got problems
Holla at the bouncer
If they ask questions

[Verse 1 - Blu]
Let them learn
I burn trees, I drink heavily
Let me breathe, I need space to chase the bass
Watch it, tell the cat the pack’s back Barach-ness
Magic with a mic, like a rabbit’s in my hat (bitch)
The C.R.A.C.hole anthem’s back
But a bit more crass though, I’m showin’ my ass more
So, tell the dips it’s Aristocrats (bitch) equipped with bags more
Show the bashful to the back door
C.R.A.C. so arrogant, ask ‘em why they like that
Ask ‘em do they ever plan on givin’ the mic back
Ask ‘em can I have them sign this, my daughter - Stop!

[Refrain x2 -  Blu, Ta’Raach]

[Verse 2 - Ta’Raach]
You don’t want to test them boys
Avoid stressin’, employ heaven and a host of - Yeah, it’s reverent
Rock with a flock of estrogen
Dough for the show, got hoes to blow medicine
I ain’t here to talk flows and sentencing
Choke up off it (bitch), check the thin line
Sharpie by the godly
C.R.A.C. will shine, the ass is mine
Even when I don’t

[Refrain x2 - Ta’Raach, Co$$]

[Verse 3 - Co$$]
I got a number two pencil for testin’
Plus it’s matter fact that I’ve been ill, impressive
Cashius, not your court jest’ but your  majest’
Leave a white stain on your mattress
Remorseless, in my white tee lookin’ gorgeous
Shoot paint balls at your wifey
Turn a sick pad to a fortress, with balls on the Nikes
Quotes on the tongue of the kicks, my fit classic
Can match with the kick of the drum
Get some, get hung from the tip of your tongue
When I move Tecs, I two-step
But I don’t rock parties

[Final Refrain - Co$$]
