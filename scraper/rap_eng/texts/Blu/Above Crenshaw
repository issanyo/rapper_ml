Excuse these daggers, swagger so mean
UV raiders, ain’t showin no green

Blu (Verse)
Since I was a yella comin out of Centinela
Vernon Infada had them goatees in the fish tank
Bad on cassette tape, bad on cassettey
Guttenberg, French fries, drinks to Mike Lauries
Go up to the store and seen a rise on the corner
On some holy mission missionary waitin for the war
Fuck Jerry’s Atari, got great grades off robbers
Martin Luther King parade, it’s 1st grade
18 when she first taught me how to French
And I was 12, got a brown sugar from the Slauson Swap
Pop cigarettes that ain’t smell like my grandma’s
Baby Lucas poured into that California popcorn
Pourin on a Tuesday, pourin on a Wednesday
Fore I’m at Thursday, Woody on my birthday
Hoodie on church day, squab it to the curb surf
Word, finding out my girlfriend sold crack
New pair of panties and patent leather grants
Doors on that ’75 Burgundy Chrysler
Marty’s first rap, fish house bout Woody’s member
More pains whoopings after propane’s cooking jug
Marla woofin out and done in every club
Every chocolate I dodge try to get knocked up
Every fuckin cop dodged fore I got locked up
Every shout out that I got for every pellet gun
Shout out i Bust, what the fuck you doin in some PK’s?
Getting busy in the Burger King bathroom
Full even niggas at the Demi’s with the building
Peal to the crib, Tele Mundo, killin kids
Pink sober’s cop the most pink tacos
Titty squos, pig latin to the vatos
In the boonies where nobody really knew me
But the hood was still in me even when I didn’t knew it was

(Bridge)
Excuse these daggers, swagger so mean
UV raiders, ain’t showin no green

(Hook)
I’m so fluorescent, I could light up yo dreams
Just so caressin, no touchin, no don’t you know?
Wanted that bass, that clappin that boom
That backseat swinging the EP but no room

Co$$ (Verse)
Since I was a shorty coming up with trays and 40’s
Used to pretend with the homies, playin cops and OG’s
Are you dancing with the handsome ugly darkness?
Posted up on Stocker like pardon me
Could you buy a blunt for me?
We wrote it up with Marcus
Front of Bone’s apartment stone laughin
Flickin roaches, we was coaches
Lost and something found, they was playin Snoopy cube
Even a youth I was bumpin underground yo
I knew I was late runnin out home
I knew I was slippin with some crips runnin from stone
Photo we wore sneakers, we ball, we all innocent
Took a hit, started losing grip off our own standin Colliseum
As my dome bled, beat me like I stole something from er
Went to school in Santa Monica
My mama must be home, summing the drums and her harmonica
Remind me of the Christian choir, all for Lincoln
Pee Pee burnin dipped in fire, Bonnie burn me off a great burn
Take a right back when daddy was alive
Days turn to nights, Philipp’s barbeque, house at Darnes, Murphy high
Aim up was my first, touched it by the bungallows
Never could afford it for the forward was reversed
Been broke since out of bonds
Statuary situations, grown men and little girls
And there was girls at the shows, chorus and the verse
Fore I was a spitter was a nigga from the dirt
Staring at the ass on the back Miss Scott
Hopscotch, butterscotch, now it’s butter when I rock
Came a long way from 4th ave at the bud spots
(Came a long way from 4th ave at the bud spots
And whatnots, yes)

I’m so fluorescent, I could light up yo dreams
Just so caressin, no touchin, no don’t you know?
Wanted that bass, that clappin that boom
That backseat swinging the EP but no room

So sassy, meet me at Telly or Gotelly
Straight shoppin what I wear, paint the luggage when you’re ready

(Hook)
I’m so fluorescent, I could light up yo dreams
Just so caressin, no touchin, no don’t you know?
Wanted that bass, that clappin that boom
That backseat swinging the EP but no…
