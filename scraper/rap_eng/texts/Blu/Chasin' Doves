[Blu]
Love is so difficult
And this is how it goes

Always late but thank God I'm here with you
Love is so young unconditional
But now it's just one-dimensional
Can't be chasin' doves
Days go by but thank God I'm here with you
All in my face I'm not hearing you
Ain't know my name for a year or two
Can't be chasing love
Always was but now I just visit you
Playing my part by my principles
Ashamed of my art I can't picture you
Chasin' days and doves

Always late but thank God I'm here with you
All in my face I'm not hearing you
Playing my part by my principles
Chasing love
Always late but thank God I'm here with you
Love is so unconditional
Now it's just one-dimensional
Chasin' doves

Always late but thank God I'm here with you
Love was so unconditional
Now it's just one-dimensional
Can't be chasin' doves
Days go by but thank God I'm here with you
All in my face I'm not here with you
Ain't know my name for a year or two
Can't be chasin' love
