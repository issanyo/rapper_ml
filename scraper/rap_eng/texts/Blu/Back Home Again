Theres no love like yours (and mine)
I wanna tell you baby
(Your one of a kind) yes your are
(Theres no love) no baby
(Like yours and mine)
I, I'm tryna tell you baby your one of a kind

When I wasn't quite myself you gave me love and joy
Now I'm like a little child with a brand new toy
Girl, you came along, and gave me hope
Peace and happiness
And I'm so thankful for your love
I really wanna say
There's no love (Like yours and mine)
I'm tryna tell you baby (your one of a kind)
Yes you are (there's no love)
