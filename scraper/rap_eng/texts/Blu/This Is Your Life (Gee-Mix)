[Verse I: MED]
Stuck in the memory
Lost while forever sing
Songs stayin’ centuries behind you
Just remind us where we finna be
History repeats like ex-men synergy
The life sippin’ Burgundy
Relax, she feelin’ me perhaps, rap
Tickle when she whistle, wet, I never leave ‘em chapped
Flicks like eyelash, photo-snap worthy but I pass
Stand behind the Flash like Gordan
Rappers floss cash now they doin’ bad
Plans get scrambled in the pocket, McNabb
Run with it, harassed by the thought
The fans want support, and the grams come up short
I’ll be damned well of course
West coast rider now you notified
If Med ain’t the best, then the spot’s not occupied
Hard to fill a spot
Eff rap, I been bumpin’ Stevie Wonder all summertime
It’s my life

Yeah, shout out to my nigga, Baby Band, hold your head up

[Verse II: Blu]
Mom, I want to be a genius, John you can be a genius
Told the teacher give me brains and I blew ‘em out the speakers, man
Jesus where the peace is?
No wear a Jesus piece, Jesus know the Greeks
Introduce me to the Greeks
Got the knowledge from a pastor
Well, here’s peaks
I peaked after on the latter no one walked under my ladder
Doesn’t matter
Wifey took a fly pic of Saturn
I ain’t gonna lie yo, she did pull a picture of Saturn
I said it’s fly with the map of Earth, kiss the seed high
If this is rap, I go first like Busta Rhymes
Felt ya rhymes kicked the line about lying to himself
The honest ones, they lyin’ to themself
Ya’ll ain’t lions
King, I am, black and bling giant
Green tyrant, trees fire hydrant, hydraulics
Saw a sob hittin’ switches, hydraulics, big body
He was a sob, he should've drove a Saab
Gimme a Caddy, call me daddy and I never rhyme
Heart as steel with the hardest heart to still stop
Parted real like I’m partin’ Red Seas
Reds and the C's
Hennessy for G’s, attendant, please
Spend legal tender with ease
Since teens, no employers coach teams, no Hoyas
Bridgetown met when BM dubs
We get in, we say we wait, we get dubs
Taught myself up another echelon
The upper edge you’re on, don’t push, get the message, you on
Seven minutes, you on
Six minutes, you on
Five minutes, niggas is already on it
It’s your life

[Outro: MED]
Yeah
Shout out to Young Guru
'Cause you know when it comes to this art
We put our love into this
Expecting that, that person will love you back
That person ain't neva gonna love you
And I understand that
These corporations ain't got love for us, shit
I ain't go love for the corporation
They don't own me or owe me nothing
Imma get mines, man
