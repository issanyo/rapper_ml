[Intro]
My days are cold, my nights are slow
And I can't take it
My days are cold, my nights are slow
And I can't take it

[Hook]
I can't cry you a river no more
That river ran dry and frozen
And every time that I try, I can't cry
And when I do, still nobody notice
And it's hopeless man

[Verse 1]
I said I wonder when the pain will let up
Or better yet when the rain will let up
Cause on the gloomy days I swear it's like a pain to get up
Same stress while me and my lady ain't together
Realize house was just our little game and get up
Then I told her I can't play games forever
My fam's hurting and I told them I'll make it better
Got cousins who got nothing
And one of them is just a little girl who asked me which dress I'll get her
Right before she turned and asked me if there's a heaven
And if I know their number maybe she can leave a message
If I'm dead, I'll be dialing it daily
And I feel I need a miracle because nothing else can save me
Fussin' like a baby, maybe this is just a sign I be going nuts
Yup, it say I'm going crazy
Probably sniffing coke and listening to too much Jay-Z
So I left home and ain't move back since eighteen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now my unc' got cancer
Lungs got cancer
And he ain't ever smoke once
And me all I do is smoke blunts
Puts my life into perspective
All I do is smoke weed, have sex, and make records
Nothing I'm promoting, I'm telling you it's hectic
Trying to draw a line every time you overstep it
Running through here everyday but smoking got you breathless
So now the doctor clearing up (?)
Either way I fuck it up instead of get the message
Believe me it's depressing
Even when my days all done
Instead of getting sleep, I'm letting beats still pump
Dreaming of a better feature
But until that day comes
Guest I'm just another (?) speaking raps (?)
And every time I (?) I just (?)
Homie told me I should chill
I said relax, I'm done
Truth is I never am
I got habits that I ain't better than

[Hook]
