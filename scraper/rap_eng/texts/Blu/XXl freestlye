Say Say
Who says I can not build rome in one day?
Thanks, now move out of my way
Peep
You better not be the niggas left screaming "help me!"
If you wanted to be free all you had to do was tell me
Guess Who
I be a sky captain
Aye aye captain
Fly guy lampin' in the clouds like the Hampton's
From dark Los Angeles but brought up so scandalous
Where everybody hands be in the sky like they champions
Joe, my tone alone will leave your microphone damaged
Wrapped up in the
Bandage, up in the ambulances
Raw and uncut
Candy man shit,chicks say the name once and get cut
Panic
Fucking up this planet
Smoke till it's plantless
If it equals bucks, I give a fuck what the plan is
Either making cake or I'm trying to make a sandwich
Using either lettuce bread or cabbage
That's it
Cheese, whipped cream, cake, dips, chips,scream ice ring
Nice bling, long johnï»¿ sliced thing, pipe dreams, I reach for daily, stone dazey
Daydreaming 'bout boning J Davey
