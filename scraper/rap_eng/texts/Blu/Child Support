[1st Sample]

[Verse 1]
Yo I was yay high, sittin' like a baller, calling shots
80 blocks, put it on the line for the slaughter
Real J serving niggas base and I kill breaks
Spill a little water for my daughter
Still face and it tastes sweeter than your water, dope
No love, niggas catching for the food
You a fool tryna park on the block, balls, hot sauce
Red barns with that arm chopped off
Don't get your block chopped up
When that Glock pop hot shot
As the important cha cha
Ayo money green jealousy run deep in my dungarees, clutch heat
Hot as the hell I'm pullin' from underneath
That boy Barnes a fucking beast, she want a piece
I wanna piece for them cold nights, huggin' my piece
Fuck ducking police up in the street nothin' but grief
They want the food you eat my G no love!

[Verse 2]
Ayo Andrews, boy I'm the boss
The address on my neck, became a man, take it off
To [?] cut it up, cut it out I made it out through the paper routes
And now we back like the sacs from the drought
You chicken back to the house
Baby bags in your mouth
To save these stacks if it's only eighty hops we out
I got the whip, got as far the block
Was on the dip from the strip, caught a line from [?] you need a life nigga
Reading my rights once forced me to read and write, green light
I hit them niggas like I had 3 strikes
Your lucky, pen is rusty sometimes it gets muddy in the sunny
Where it only rain Money, play dummy
Be the billionaire boy with the bunny
I'm tryna stay out the game, young niggas wanna bang for me
They hear my name and throw they chain for me
We bout to get it cause it's niggas who don't, simple as that with it

[Verse 3]
If she need it, I get it
If she want it I'm on it
She got it, my [?] 100 percent
My nigga pompous as Prince, parking the whip playing Pac
I'm pondering if I should pop shit like my Pops
My level is like that, she credit incredible with that ice action
Get your life back, get your prize snatched
If you want it no need to covet, it's covered, my cup runneth over
It's nothing, it's more normal to find a syringe for you
More on the block real, but still I spit formal
The streets my money's formed, we run em, niggas torn
We warn for you [?], get your feelings torn
Get a reason to love life, we busting just to keep blood pumpin'
Crush mics when we touch life
Spending ones like we spend the funds
Get the huns like we used to get the guns
When we did the runs
Steady counting with my lady steady bouncin'
Baby ain't even counting the age nigga, we getting thousands
Give her hundreds when I wanna give the world
Pop them niggas life for my baby
