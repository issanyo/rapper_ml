[BLU] Verse 1:

Ayo Sunny days cloudy nights Larry King Heidi Flights
Picture the Maui life hoppin' out of Audi 5's

Miami Vice Don Jon with the mic
Pom Pom pageant pouring Sean Don with the ice

Krondon spilling something viscous in the system like
Liqour lights , make catch me missing with your Misses like i'm Mr.Right

I'm like air jordan , different Nikes
Clark Kent Burgundy whip blowin' that Kryptonite

Evergreen with the wings , never missed a flight
This is like scripted ridiculous on a Wednesday night

She kissed it like the ring on my pinky she never seen me
Gave her the 3rd wish on the genie she played my repeat

'88 Lac back seat seat the squeeze out here cashmere jeans
Not my CD nigga

Told the FeFe she could meet me off of queen street
Dean with my math supreme holler if you see me nigga

[Chuuwee] Chorus: You just do you While i do me
When i step outside its a movie we on

And we about to bubble like the bubbly
And the bubble butt floozies who was up in the Jacuzzi

Nigga you just do you dont worry bout me
The repercussions are terrible you wouldn't wanna see

Everything is everything homie just let it be
You just do you and i'll be doing me

[Chuuwee] Verse 2:

Aye i was backyard barbecue, Sideline niggas still talkin
Phil Donahue Come on how hard are you?

I can see the dweeb i can see the Nardwaur in dudes
Why they tryna front like they really had the nards to do it

'97 coupe Chuuw was lookin Crucifix
Holy Moley Jesus Piece suit was on some movie shit

Snoop was on the radio, i was on the way to be
The flyest nigga saying so tell me why you playin'

Why you low key, hatin allah tainting the agua
I drink from smell you guys you like stink bugs

Roller Blading on daytons on these hating ass niggas
To the deepest part of hell with my asian

Wasn't no half steppin back then
Wasn't playing playstation with you lazy ass pedestrians and patrons

Powder Inn, Rutter park game i was raised with
Fliest nigga living South East Sac Made him

Chorus:

Bridge Intro: Yea ... It's a lot of shit going down right now
Sometimes you gotta slow down and evaluate everything

Take some time off, let some shit off

It's hella shit going on right now , Real Shit

YO

Bridge Verse:

First Litte Brother split up now everday i get up
Im dealing with some shit that make a basic nigga give up

Surviving a city where niggas love to see you quiver
Im just trying to get my weight up fuck push ups and sit ups

Baby Bibs all my old friends got children
It get harder to make a living 2 of em suicide victims

Who am i to bitch and nag about trivial and simplistic ass things
Some of my niggas barely have a kitchen

Though i wish that i could help all of my people fill they pockets
I gotta make a way out for myself secure my options

You get one shot that i can either pass like Stockton
Or take it to the hole like Malone bitch i got this

I feel king of my castle ring on my pinky
Lean in my chalice queen is the baddest ass the fattest

Ashy to lavish poet to rapper start a new chapter
Follow my life and dont you skip before or after nigga

I'm comin back like i left something
Based God dope on the stove watch me chef something

Dress so fresh so cold , in the best garments
Niggas would do death for these clothes i sent a text for em

So now i'm living LRG
Half man half devil giving hell on beats

Im layed back Cause i'm way to self when i tweet
I let you do you just let me do me
