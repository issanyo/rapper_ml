[Intro: James Vincent McMorrow sample]

[Verse 1: ANTHM]
Before I watch it all vanish, like the lost city of Atlantis
I'm taking advantage of the mechanics that I was handed,
'til I give up the ghost, see my soul still riddled with hopes
In the sky see me scribble my quotes, that be my legacy
I'm blazing like armageddon, I started betting on me
Instead of bombarding heaven with my prayers
Driven by competitive edge, fully fledged
On the ledge, next to veteran heads like Mt. Rushmore
Clutching the mic', see me bust raw
Reaching for pinnacles that I lust for
Pure artistry, from the heart of me, 'till I depart
Whether or not I'm arguably regarded like rap martyrs be
21 gun salute, before they shoot
How I be living proof, niggas shake this destiny then Poof!
One day, the dark nights might fade us
At least I got to shine like the greatest

[Verse 2: Blu]
Turn me up...
Yeah
Guess who
Eyyo it's all elementary dawg, I was a 10 year old
Spitting flows, dreaming of being dipping the prince's gold
Picket fences blocked the visions I was sent to hold
So I kicked it open like Eminem did at Interscope
I sip the OE, thinking of those before me
Who never made it, sharing the stage with fakes and phonies
But I never hated, elevated the ceremony
Listed on your homie's all time favorites
I should get a Rolly
'Till I'm at the Tonys
Posting like a trophy, I would never act
When I'm on track, people know me from the West
To East so far you see the Bering Sea
Holding my gullying gold until they bury me
Like an Egyptian God probably be in hieroglyphs
So all my niggas reminisce as they bottles sip
Pac shit, I get the chills when I play this
At least I got to shine like the greatest

[Verse 3: ANTHM]
Relenetlessly, I reinvent this
So called thing, you call a dream
When I sent this, Message in a bottle
Up to Mt. Olympus
What's the use, hollering Zeus
Are we calling a truce?
Can I
Live?
Won't spare you my tongue
You know I gotta shine if there's air in my lungs
So when you stare, picture the glare in the sun
The suns sets when I perish
I'm done
One

[Outro: ANTHM]
One day, the dark nights might fade us
At least I got to shine like the greatest
I said:
One day, the dark nights might fade us
At least I got to shine like the greatest
Today, the dark nights might fade me
But the shine never made me
It was the, heart of the lion
See a man's vision, praying in the church of ambition
Amen
