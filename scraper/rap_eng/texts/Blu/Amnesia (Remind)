[Verse 1: Blu]
Check it
Somethin' bout the little things you make say
Amazed by the ways you be keepin' me dazed
Tried to spit game but these girls don't play
Bangin' little waist with a cute-ass face
Somethin' 'bout the little things you make me do
Somethin' 'bout conditioner with no shampoo
Tried to stick around without the Elmer's glue
Told her anything she needed I would help her through
Rule number one: You gotta quit runnin' from fools
Campaign or no campaign, they're runnin' for you
I mean, the way you do your hair and the way that you move
Acting like you don't care when deep down you do
Like the way you ride your bike through the park around 2:00
Told 'er don't believe the hype you got flav plus juice
And only if it's right, I'll write my love too
Nope, I'm not down I always was Blu
But, I knew your favorite color was another, butter pecan
Praline dream, picked her up for the weekend
Tried to hide feeling but they just kept leakin'
Had the M-A-S-K but wasn't trick-or-treatin'
One thing about love, it's worth seekin'
What's the point of cheatin' when it's nothin' worth keepin'
She asked why I did it, I didn't really have a reason
But there's somethin' about her grin that had me che-che-cheesing
Back of my mind I had my subconscious speakin'
Note on the door said, sorry but I'm leavin'
