Yea uh, that Miami base
To them San Fran quakes
Thought you could play me baby, no not at all
She’s Annie Hall, Annie Hall

Sunlight, moonlight, star through sol
He tried to play me out, no not at all
Like a yoyo I walked his dog
To my heartbeat yes he will crawl
Move that thing like thumb thumb cardiac
Til I attack then he will fall
I don’t answer phones when my lover calls
All strung up with no guitar
It’s when he kept begging me
No I’m not a box but I do box steadly
Went around the service when he never got the best of me
Just like a toy, oh boy better cherish me

That Miami base
Oh boy better cherish me
To them San Fran quakes
Thought you could play me baby, no not at all
She’s Annie Hall, Annie Hall

Deal no deal when you deal with me
Our love connection Chuck Woolery
All the ways in fortune now we in jeopardy
So press your luck, big box, no whammy
Turn the date in game to the newly wed pair
An amazing race to the Hollywood square
So please no cheating cuz that’s not fair
Then you can find out who wants to be a millionaire
Truth, dare, double dare, promise to repeat
Playin late hopscotch in the middle of the street
Let’s make a deal and if it goes down
If the price is right then come on down
Come on down
Then come on down
Then come on down

Watch out man, what does it mean?
Thought you could play me baby, no not at all
You couldn’t phase me with my back on the wall
She set me up and knew just how I would fall
She’s Annie Hall, Annie Hall

She’s not like every deal, she’s not like the fam
She rides me like I’m falling soft to the plan
She run the turner kit, a yellow dress
But don’t tell my real deal
She’s not like the feel
She’s not like the what?
She’s not like the what?
She hangs with others
But she knows we see fair

You tried to play me baby, no not at all
You couldn’t phase me with my back on the wall
She set me up and knew just how I would fall
She’s Annie Hall, Annie Hall
Annie Hall, Annie Hall

Sometimes I need her
And I believed her
Sometimes I need her
Not like the last
Tell me those
Yea

You tried to play me baby, no not at all
You couldn’t phase me with my back on the wall
She set me up and knew just how I would fall
She’s Annie Hall, Annie Hall
Annie Hall, Annie Hall
She’s Annie Hall, Annie Hall

You tried to play me baby, no not at all
She couldn’t break me with a black stickin saw
You tried to phase me baby, but you’re not that far
Misses Annie
