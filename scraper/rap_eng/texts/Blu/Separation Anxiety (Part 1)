[Verse 1]
Baby, you should take a trip and spend
Time with me, come down with me to the west end
But baby, loving me comes at a cost
And loving anyone else is your loss
I'm not trying to be conceited baby
Don’t have to do much to drive you crazy
Once you find yourself between these thighs
Won't be able to distinguish truth from lies

[Chorus]
Truth from lies
Distinguish truth from lies
So once you find yourself between these thighs
Know you're mine

[Verse 2]
Baby said my loving gets you high
But you go down for me time to time
Addict to my body’s every vice
Withdrawal when you draw away from I
He steady calling me hypnotic, too
I guess I really am what I consume
Once you find yourself between these thighs
Better separate them and my truth from lies

[Chorus]
Truth from lies
Separate my truth from lies
And now you found yourself between these thighs
Made you mine
