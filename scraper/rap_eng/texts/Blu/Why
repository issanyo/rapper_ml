[Chorus: Dustin Hill & Blu]
She keep asking me why
Why you gotta act like that
Know I love you that’s true
You ain’t gotta be rude
2x

[Verse 1: Rowlan]
Why you act the way you acting on the daily
Why you run it run your mouth until I’m crazy
Why talking like our love ain't enough
Why you acting like my ex is trying to fuck
She said it's coffee and it's just so we can speak
You always telling me that I’m just overly naive
I know you dont get it, but its more than just an ex
It’s more than just our past, and its more than just some sex
It's complicated, I get that you don't get it
But if you knew where I was at you wouldn't sweat it
The things we can,t control are usually strongest
We been going for a while, but that was the longest
You have me now, so that past shouldn’t hurt
You gotta trust me, if you want this to work
I’m being honest I don’t want to tell lies
But your attitude is present, so I need to know


[Chorus: Dustin Hill & Blu]
She keep asking me why
Why you gotta act like that
Know I love you that’s true
You ain’t gotta be rude
4x


[Verse 2: Rowlan]
Show me what you talking bout
Tell me what you need to do
Why you need to link with her
Fuck what she been going through
Moving on is moving on and ain't no half in shit
She just gets emotional and probably try to spin shit
You know she in love with you, you got to see intentions
I met her twice and tried to like two different first impressions
Stop with all this past shit
I’m better than your last chick
Remember how she did you wrong
You never did get past it
I’m sorry if it's coming off like I care
But I care for you and when it's bad no ones there
Besides me and these emotions
And this heart and this brain
My ex man did me wrong
And since then ain't the same
But I don't link with him or talk to him
And fuck how he feel
When I signed up for us
Well that's when I broke the deal
It's you and I, and me and you
And ain't no reason lie
So you should go ahead and tell me
I just need to know why

[Chorus: Dustin Hill & Blu]
She keep asking me why
Why you gotta act like that
Know I love you that’s true
You ain’t gotta be rude
4x
