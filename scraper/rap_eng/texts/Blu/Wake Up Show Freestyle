      You swore you was the dopest vocalist till I came and spit that hot shit
Dropped it with Metropolis to melt your fiber optics
Just for ice grilling
The mic villain up every night
Killing the bombest beats with cinematography done by Hype Williams
I like feeling like having the best, passionate sex
My trigger-happy ass, be classy like a Jag or a Lex
I stand grand like a man, you just a fag in a dress
Catch me fitted nightly with Nikes, my cap, and my sweats
Relaxed at my desk, pen and pad rapping my text
Writing about cars, clothes, bitches and cashing my check
Like cats in the West
To ever stay strapped with a vest
Better believe I gotta dark side like the back of your neck
Packed with a Tech, blasting if you asking for death
Sack full of stress
Sky-high flag in the West
I’m scratching your decks
First Funk Master the Flex
Steady laughing at these rappers gasping, asking the rest
Smash your set, plus with ? the vet
I blast past your whole staff and pause to catch my breath
Smash on set, even crash the last two-step
Garbage disposals, whack rappers are trash unless
I have interest
My minimal will match your best
So you think the rules done changed, mane
Ask the rest, my class is vexed
You need to get your glasses checked
Cause when you focus right mind, you never have to guess
We passed your test, J Barnes demand respect
I ain’t check nothing less than what the fans accept
Grand by stress, pumping what the fans suggest
So if the question’s in my Heavens then the answer’s yes
Ain’t no commercial interruptions, this is branded best
I’m fully clean like the soap commercial man for Zest
I might take shit in but never stand for less
