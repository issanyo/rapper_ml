[Intro]
(Excuse me as I kiss the sky)
(It was something in the air)
(Rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa)
(Put your seatbelts on, we 'bout to gain altitude)
(Excuse me as I kiss the sky)
(It was s-s-something in the air)
(Rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa)
(Up to the sky!)

[Verse 1: Blu]
The introduction I'm
Best to your average, better with pads
And raps that make you bask, but don't gotta master
Mistresses meet the bastard, kissing it, a hazard
Lips have been killing niggas since niggas was spitting classics
Venomous with the vixens, vital for idle vagges
Midas this still like I'm touching his prices so like a plaque with it
Smack, wack, written off the tracks, wheel it back for me
Stacks I eat like snacks, meals for raps homie
Skills you lack attract to me like black pussy
Rap cookie monster's back giving cats noogies
Trap bully rap like the gat
Fully automat, autograph the rack that Giuseppe hoodie
Hook her up for a brother, put her up on that other
Put a love on my rubber and cookie cutter
A smooth lover wonder what was under covers
When I woke, all my CDs was gone, she left the covers
What the fuck

[Hook: Mela Machinko]
Excuse me as I kiss the sky
It was s-s-something in the air
Rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Up to the sky
I'm fly, I shine so bright up like the star up in the sky
I'm up into the sky, I'm so fly
I'm gonna shine light like the star up in the sky
I'm up into the sky, I'm so fly

[Verse 2]
My name is up there, I'm on my God shit
Got lifted below the heavens and ain't stop since
Mob shit, why should I pimp live shrimp
A picture worth a million words, I'm Gustav Klimt
Bitch, get your name tag aimed at
Lyrics headed straight to your heart, you need a vein slap
I took the game, now I'm here to give that fame back
Cause really, it's way too many lames tryna claim rap
Rugged and powerful, hustling without a group manager
Label'll budget fuck the shit out of loots
Fuck, you're born to bust it, what could a condom do, nothing
No fucking around I ain't a prostitute
Bumping underground when my partner swooped me up
I got lots to do, running errands im wearing Yacchi shoes
Hop got hip and dropped the new from out the blue
Outclass and outrap niggas, now I'm out for you
Blaow! Giving a shout out to my child
And another shot for anybody tryna do us foul
The truest now, been the truest then, you a sin
You a lie, I should look you in your eyes when you spit
Turn the sky a different tint, when I'm pissed, pitch a tent
This is my house, I'm nothing this is my cloud, bitch
On my brand new heavies, eating my veggies and grits
Ready to pimp, stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready trick

[Hook]
