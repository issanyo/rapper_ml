It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor, won't you be mine
Good morning sunshine
I mean the sunset
And still ain't wanna yet
I'd rather have a dream
In some gorgeous place
Sucking your gorgeous nests
So I went back to sleep
Me and my morning bone
Would have been on and on
Probably from dusk to dawn
Instead I'm rusting chrome, busting poems
Living like a gnome
Posted at the home
Half asleep and stoned
Chop the beats until I'm gone
Must have been on my dome
Can't get her off my mind or on the phone half the time
But still I had to try to satisfy this appetite
Might even grab a pie, mad high bagged eyes
I was that happy guy taking naps at 5
Working early days leaving smashed in half the night
Gladys and the Pips
Gorgeous in the simp and the glorious tilt
Til somebody spilt milk
But yo you still chill
I started bugging out like "who the fuck spilled milk?"
Knowing damn well it must've been my dumb ass
Now I'm drunk passed out having dreams about my love past
Had brunch ass, lunch ass, dinner ass
But never in the ass and never did ask
I just slid past, back to the sunshine
Smacking that behind, mind stuck on rewind
Like hold up this is fresh
Ain't met a woman fresher
Much better than the rest
And may I add the best
Perfectly round ass
Perfectly round breasts
Purposely frownless
Smile like a ad from crest
Oh yeah, I got a request
