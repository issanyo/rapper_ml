DMV, you never see me, I’m in the street, my shit be on creep
My lean be on, my lean be on sweets
DMV, you never see me
DMV, you never see me
DMV, you never see me
DMV, you never see me

You need my love
I need your love
Hold up
You need a life though
I need a mic, yo
It's like a drug
It's like a fight
So you can take a ride
Or take a hike
Hold up
You heard me right
Or heard me wrong
You heard me wrong
Then you probably didn't hear my song
I'm on that all night, day dawn, all day long
All I wanna do is fuck
All you ever do is yawn
All you ever say is hush
Fuck is wrong?
She be a little nicer
I can't be no nicer than this
I'll be your light, I'll be your fire, be your hydrogens

DMV, you never see me
DMV, you never see me
I’m in the street, my shit be on creep
My lean be on, my lean be on sweets
DMV, you never see me
DMV, you never see me
DMV, you never see me
DMV, you never see me
