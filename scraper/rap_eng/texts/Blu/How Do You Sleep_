[Andrew Thomas Reid: Hook]
How do you sleep at night without me?
Without me?
How do you dream during the day without me?
Without me?

[Blu]
Yeah
I just dream about another
Finding beauty 'side the minds undiscovered
Hinding under covers
So let me climb up in and sit and wonder
'Bout a distant lover or about a mother
Makes you ponder 'bout creation
All I am is creative
The monster or the nightmare
Staring darkness in the eyes until I rise
Staring at the hands of time
As if a button could rewind it all
Have you ever slept and dreamt you were a god?
Will you leave this life the same or will it actually evolve?

[Hook]

[Sene]
Yeah
Night lights, I ain't never used
Didn't know I could paint Mona Lisa on a Light Bright
Drift off to a place where I is
Scream then I talk through dreams in the twilight
Halfway through hell then heaven called
Who me? My fault, I never called
Don't wait up I'll be late
Got a date with death
You know he's never wrong
He's early all the time
Pick my friends off the line like dry clothes
Still we all got high hopes
Dreams start walking on tight ropes
If I fall, does that mean I can't reach exactly where I won't
Exactly where I won't in a bit of time
I'll be spilling from the sky with the city in my eyeball
