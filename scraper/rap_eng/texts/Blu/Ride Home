She couldn't romance the [?]
He wouldn't hold hands and dance
Still, it was a long summer
I'm fanning down my fans
Car trouble, hoping the [?] doesn't charge me double for cans
Good thing my rent was only a couple grand
She knew nothing about hustling, or struggling
She was fussing about nothing, cussing her cousin out
She just loved running her mouth
I would drive by the city, just to smoke a cig
You ever kiss the moon and drew?
Ever hugged your lover winter?
You ever lose what you never had?
I miss her
She would drive by the city, showing her ass and titties
I would lie about leaving
Just to lie in a house, and counting money was funny
You gotta get gas to get your checked cashed just to get ass
I would just laugh and pass out, waiting in my car
For this broad to shake
My heart was on Mars, my love was on a plate
She ate it up, never stayed for lunch
Pride gone, thinking about the ride home
Where do you go? What do you do? Who do you know?
I asked love, where should we go? What could we go?
Nowhere was better than somewhere
She said one day, we could find some day. Funny
Stay don't pay
Busy getting my one save, where did the huns go?
Where does the fun go, after the funds go?
Crack a blunt, slow
Smash the rum, making my tongue slur, easing my nerves
Free as a bird, lettin them birds go
