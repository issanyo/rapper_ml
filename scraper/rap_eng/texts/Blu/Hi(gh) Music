[Intro]
Get High
Everybody
Cups Up (Yup)
Solid gold wrist plush
Black fist up, hands in the sky high
High, nightlife
My life
You might want to ride by
Lift it up lets get sky high

[Verse 1]
So much built frustration
I puff away as much as I can before the day ends
Trying to re-channel that hate up inside you
To give a little thought to the beats that we rhyme to
But, see I bust from the heart
So, beats keep rocking while the paws patrol
Be trying to take away my soul, but it's so much left
The stress can arise, but I ride til' death
And I still be me
Free as a drum roll
Solar to sunset, shining
Hiding from the moon like
Life, living it full blown
Stoner philosophers, the home of the hollow
It's beating for my people to follow
Throw it like a message in a bottle
Was sent for the senseless to sense it
And since this is the sick, sick, times
Of that six, six sign, I'mma say this
Play this in your playlist
And watch how the planet goes ape-shit
As soon as the bass hits
Big up to Basic for giving me the basics
And props to Rock for copping keys to that spaceship
We about to take it up a notch ma rock with us
And watch it bang on every block before the cops get us
Hip-hop shop lifters
We taking back our spot like Indian givers
So give it up (Aye!)

[Hook]
Get lost in love until you get high
Get high and buzzed and put your cups up
Touch, solid gold wrist plush
Black fist up, hands in the sky high
All day making music for the nightlife
All night, we just party til' the day comes
Play dumb if you want, or you can ride by
Lift it up, let's get sky high

Get high
Cups up
Solid gold wrist plush
Black fist up, hands in the sky high
All day making music for the nightlife
All night, we just party til' the day comes
Play dumb if you want, or you can ride by
Lift it up, let's get sky high

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I be feeling like my life
Is kind of like the new testament how I
Sacrifice for what I represent, Saint John
See that church, and it never let me play God
Cause, now I'm walking through the streets trying to play God
With the top twelve, running with the same squad
And you might want to log on
Three "w" cantbegodtoo.com
On some wild cowboy like Sadat songs
Saddam John in the flesh, drop bombs
And cock arms like I'm cop deep
But I rock calm, and collect my checks, feds respect me
And I don't mean to play a villain
But, I ain't leaving the building until I cop a couple billion
Russel with my hustle
Simmons with the business
With a witness taking pictures every time I say a sentence
Playing eight positions
Starting five and sixth-man
Coaching a goal, it's my sixth sense
With a sick sense of humor
Since six playing tricks on the kids and
Telling them it's all about the Benjamins
And get them
And man, turn it up in your system
And throw a middle finger to the system
Cause we just making music for the few that need a place they can drift in
I just hope this dope uplifting
So get it

[Hook]
Get lost in love until you get high
Get high and buzzed and put your cups up
Touch, solid gold wrist plush
Black fist up, hands in the sky high
All day making music for the nightlife
All night, we just party til' the day comes
Play dumb if you want, or you can ride by
Lift it up, let's get sky high

Get high
Cups up
Solid gold wrist plush
Black fist up, hands in the sky high
All day making music for the nightlife
All night, we just party til' the day comes
Play dumb if you want, or you can ride by
Lift it up, let's get sky high
