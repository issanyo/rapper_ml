[Verse 1: Kota the Friend]
Fuck the world, I don't need friends
I can do this shit alone, same way I came in
It's the only way my cynicism intend to make sense
Cause ain't nobody by you when you trying to make rent
When a dollar hard to find, when you trying to scrape cents
Just to get a small meal when the living get real, yo
Backstabbers in the shadows
Used to be naive, now I got them on my maps bro
I dodge 'em like the toll roads and I don't even fully trust the app yet
Fuck banks keep the real money in my mattress
Cause I don't trust no one, and I don't need a cosign
Trying to get they fingers in my gold mine
And I believe in myself even when the world don't
And I don't need to worry 'bout the weak links
Standing on my O-line
I read the gaps closed and create my own holes
Third string winning titles on his own, dog

[Chorus: Kota ]
I be on my island
'Cause niggas always coming at your soul
Praying that one day you gonna fold, dog
I be on my island
Cause people finna stab you in the back
In your face steady putting on an act, so
I be on my island
Cause ever body playing fucking games
So we all look at everybody strange, dog
I be on my island
Cause I be sick and tired of the garbage
Hop into my ship and I be off this

[Verse 2: Blu]
First we was only after G's like the letter H
Then we was only after meals like we never ate
Only thing after bills is the trill face
And the thrill only tastes better when it's with the grill
Grace in your face like a hundred mill
Hungry meals was the hundred year milk
How do you feel in the field when it's real
And them bills make you feel like you drowning in your own house
Blowing clouds, I might go mouth on the mountain
Counting all my blessings trying to tell it to my hot men
Muhammad, Mandela, Malcolm, Martin
And still can't fit all the merits in the margin
I be having thoughts of becoming a farmer
Getting married or being a single father for my daughter
I bought her all the water on the planet
And put it on a song in case she ever gets stranded

[Chorus]
I be on my island
Cause niggas always coming at your soul
Praying that one day you gonna fold, dog
I be on my island
Cause people finna stab you in the back
In your face steady putting on an act, so
I be on my island
Cause ever body playing fucking games
So we all look at everybody strange, dog
I be on my island
Cause I be sick and tired of the garbage
Hop into my ship and I be off this

[Verse 3: Kota the Friend]
These fools mad shameless
That's why best friends become strangers
Always gotta watch for the danger
Everybody suspect, all I see is snakes
So I keep my hair straight till I passing through the days
I be dolo, brim bank kicking in my dojo
Free spirit living like I'm yoko
Small town full of small minds moving slow-mo
Stuck in the moment, still staring at a photo, it's all the same
I be on a plane with a knapsack
Looking at the clouds moving mad fast
Driving on the 99 going 85 in the Saab
Switching lanes on the California high
Island man in full effect
My current being forced is no regrets
I make tunes sleep water bread
And live free of every complex
Dropping out the contest
Hoping you don't take me out of context

[Chorus]
I be on my island
Cause niggas always coming at your soul
Praying that one day you gonna fold, dog
I be on my island
Cause people finna stab you in the back
In your face steady putting on an act, so
I be on my island
Cause ever body playing fucking games
So we all look at everybody strange, dog
I be on my island
Cause I be sick and tired of the garbage
Hop into my ship and I be off this

I be on my island
Cause niggas always coming at your soul
Praying that one day you gonna fold, dog
I be on my island
Cause people finna stab you in the back
In your face steady putting on an act, so
I be on my island
Cause ever body playing fucking games
So we all look at everybody strange, dog
I be on my island
Cause I be sick and tired of the garbage
Hop into my ship and I be off this

I be on my island
Cause niggas always coming at your soul
Praying that one day you gonna fold, dog
I be on my island
Cause people finna stab you in the back
In your face steady putting on an act, so
I be on my island
Cause ever body playing fucking games
So we all look at everybody strange, dog
I be on my island
Cause I be sick and tired of the garbage
Hop into my ship and I be off this
