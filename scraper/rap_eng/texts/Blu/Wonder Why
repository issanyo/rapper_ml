(Hook)
Dreams come true, Blame One and Blu, listen if you didn't know i learned it when I was 6 years old, we were going to surely die but...I wonder why...Timing is moving oh so slow, when you got no place to go, why can't we live in the sky...I wonder why...

(First Verse: Blame One)
Yo I wonder why so many guns alive
Politically propaganda funs alive
Humanity casting reactively in my world motherfuckers plan to be
You can't stand that you've seen it or heard of it
It's certain you gotta see it to work it
Can't find it or seek it or searched it
You can't see it without doing a searchin
Whack music dies unless you purchase it
Music goes wild that's how you interpret it
It's just another man with a top notch
It's a man that has got props
Just saying caught him in a voodoo, plus in signs can't do it in a Blu do
I know you really want to try but...I wonder why...I wonder why my spirits keep moving me
To improve in me, so I can proven to me
You can't stare when you reach for the skies...I wonder why...

(Hook#2)
If you didn't know, I learned it when I was six years old, we were going to surely die but...I wonder why..Timing is moving oh so slow, when you got no place to go, why can't we live in the sky...I wonder why...

(Second Verse: Blu)
I wonder why seen straight from the sun and skies
Licking the tears from my eyes
I'll just say I know why, I know time is a bitch and I know it flies
In what direction, which direction have they gone by
Fast away from the sky, singing away "Why some eyes"
Asked a million questions, questions and answers I only founded one and a million, but which one is true
...I wonder why...So you never knew, you never know
Plants and seeds needed grow back and grow
Meditate on your own truth to watch your own flow
The point we all we know, there's a truth and a foe
We go go up up we go relax and go slow
Fuck the reason why, we all going to die but but...I wonder why...

(Hook#3)

(Third Verse: Blame One)
I wonder why, what some consumes the lies, it will soon rise
On this no new demise, show him the prize, but not the past
Drop the mass, Stop the task, you unity forgot the math
Each one, teach one, some has reached the gun
Pull yourself down one equals none
One becomes the one who has the rums
The round starts a drug one drunk
Becoming it, the power has some of it, steady running it
Chasing your tail for the fun of it dun of it
Too much drinking of a glass and weed of dutch
Cocaine leaving a rush, breathing it in enough?, trust
It's not the even stuff that makes you do it
Bravery is not a savior you, but you knew it
You're not grounded you surely can't fly...I wonder why...
I wonder why reality restored when you see
Distorted In the data reported to the base of the government to the plan of the new world rise...I wonder why...
