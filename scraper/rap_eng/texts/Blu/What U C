[Verse 1: Blu]
Swoop, swoop
Belly full, heavy on the wool, cheeba
Heaven on cool, FM on ya dual speakers
Roof mission with some cut, sitting plush
Sitting up in them trucks when niggas is whippin', sess
Dust niggas, split a blunt, dutch with vanilla clarks
Lit up with her denim art bending hearts
Bitch, it’s more than just a dick, it's the feeling
System in the park I was killing
Touched a sister in the heart, I was healing
Pick ya part, shoot ya darts right, fuck a reptilian
Got niggas pushing hearses, we pushing verses
Lincoln continental, delta service

[Verse 2: MED]
Time traveling life through sound passages
Town champions, surrounds pound for the crown
Count 'em in, bounce from the crown
Victoria magnolia brim cover the tent
Lenses script rigid, fit but its fitted
Under linen cloth, minutes off
Back in ’em in the park
Women holds the stem of, commend a thought
Phone a friend, let her pick her part
In it snark, get the bread man heavy on the starch
Chevy on the front lawn parked
Spark clear leafs, let it breathe, breathe
For the prestige feeling let ya ears feast
I be on the crease, sharp with a dip
Like arms in the sleeve, nigga came from the pits
Nick drop from the backseat, tell 'em where to get
Chauffeured, over, behind tents sipping burb
Easy on the turns
I almost spill my shit
Slow down
Hey man, slow it down

[Verse 3: Black Spade]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We cruising, 88 delta black bruising
Tan with the burgundy seats, twisting a susan
Smoke while I'm rolling, park the chi, choking
Spark like fireworks, the samurai shogun
Slicin', rap blows like Tyson and his youngin
Banjo shoot nigga while the strings is strumming
Black sabata, African ensenada
In it for a little bit more, the whole enchilada
Roll with me, chop it up, go half on a fifty
Petro, fuck the metro, lets go sample clepto
Double dice swinging from the rear view
Add it up, 12x12, speaking the amir do
I'm at jummah tryna follow the sunnah
Making salat, tryna keep my deen in a dunia
Inshallah
