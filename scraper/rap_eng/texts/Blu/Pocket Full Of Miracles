[Intro]
P-racticality D-oesn't interest me
Love the life that I lead
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles

[Verse 1: Blu]
Yo, it’s all [?] people and poetry and [?]
I been to the east coast, it’s knowledge [?]
But I’m west coast though, best coast, Pacific coast
With the most, you always think of the coast
So check I’m on the east, I’m always on the beats
I’m a beast, but then I run into The 45 King
Yo! MTV Raps, I’m on the raps, bro you on the beats
45 King, you a beast!
He said “kill the façade, take my card
1 900 Number, you gonna be large”
So I dialled it, feelin’ like Staten Island, wylin’
45 been on Hov and Eminem’s albums
It’s on, we do one song and we on
Money, fame, women, fly cars
The platinum, diamond, gold, silver and bronze
But first I gotta drop a real gem in this song
So check it out y’all

[Sample]
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles

[Verse 2: Blu]
Eh yo, we probably get the radio, prime time cable and Clark Gable
Blast red alert, hit all the record store crazy
Get the streets on lock, we pace every block
About to be the number 1 jam boomin’ out your box
Hit the Billboard charts with somethin’ real they could feel
It’s bout to be bigger than any rapper with a deal
Worldwide overage, UK they gotta love it
Hundred thousand first day out with no budget
45 King live on production
Remix with my diamonds, [?]
Starring your favourite MC for every day of the week
We even started presales on the next LP
You gotta cop that, labels tryna tell us not to drop that
They top acts couldn’t sell a beat in a sea
We got hot tracks, y’all got hi hats
I pull a hundred gems outta one dime sack
Word up

[Sample]
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles

[Verse 3: Blu]
Eh yo Blu too old school bro, yo where’s the Digio and Pro Tools?
You puttin’ too much rails and amps out your vocals
What’s up with all the rappers in the game these days?
Bro yo, they ‘bout to bring back crack and gold chains
Where’s the platinum at? What’s the new shit after that?
Singing so much, I wonder who gon’ bring rappin’ back
You keep clappin’ that and no one gon’ be clappin’ back
But don’t trip we got boom-bap for that
And 45 brought it back like the wax type
When whack rappers drop flat lines
We bring tracks to life when we grab mics to rap
Last time we spoke your last rhyme was whack
I drop rap dope, now rappers rap dope
But the code holds, ain’t bein’ broke, gotta go
You gotta prove that what you do can improve rap
When my man said “black, how you plan to do that?”
I just said

[Sample]
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
But there’s that pocket full of miracles
And with my pocket full of miracles
I’ve got a pocket full of miracles
