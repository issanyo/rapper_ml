[Intro]
Hocus pocus to throw a scare at me

[Chorus]
"The difference between me and them" "Skills"
"I gotta be me, I gotta be fresh"
"Start sleepin', catchin' you off guard"
"I'm the definition of ill" "You not an MC"

[Verse 1: Blu]
B-L-U from out the live, sell the truth
I keep a female or two, thought you was fly, fell off the roof
I never fell off from Blu
I wrapped the planet like the ocean and I flow like the breeze
I'm after green because I'm blue and 'cause I smoke lots of green
Leave microphones broken with ease, squeeze until speakers bleed
Please, if my tongue was like a gun I bust it like a Desert Eas'
Never question the expertise, I'm a Letterman
On a veteran team, niggas could never be better than
Got more stripes than the peppermint or Parisian tees
There's no comparing 'em to, who?
Any challenger will get embarrassed with ease
They used to speak highly of you till you fell like the leaves
In the fall, all them times you thought you would be boss
But got crossed off the list, don't trip
My flow thick, I'm so hard, my whole squad all-stars
Rough, rugged and raw, it's all ours

[Interlude]
The magician waved a long finger at the girl and said

[Chorus]
"The difference between me and them" "Skills"
"I gotta be me, I gotta be fresh"
"Start sleepin', catchin' you off guard"
"I'm the definition of ill" "You not an MC"
"The difference between me and them" "Skills"
"I gotta be me, I gotta be fresh"
"Start sleepin', catchin' you off guard"
"Around rappers, I'm bound to sleep"

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Look, PSA
Y'all plain jane like sneaking Mary past TSA
That contain strains of Reggie
You wouldn't feel I was edgy if I ain't know the ledge
I put the nail in the coffin below the sledgehammer
For your grandma, rather you sink or you rise notches
Y'all can catch my sneaker size, not just
These hands that move like synchronized watches
You hate I was given a gift, then sue me
Since I got the juice and your pulp's fiction, we living in a different movie
You're just a brash type, some little shit that turned into a asswipe
Throwing rocks at a glass house that should be for a glass pipe
Street cred was charged to the game until last swipe
Where all my fruits and labor are past ripe
What, what, I been local
On labels that threw me inside a chokehold
Just so that I couldn't be vocal
And it must've sucked, you tried to put a diamond in a clusterfuck
But what's a Cadillac with a diamond to a monster truck

[Chorus]
"The difference between me and them" "Skills"
"I gotta be me, I gotta be fresh"
"Start sleepin', catchin' you off guard"
"I'm the definition of ill" "You not an MC"
"The difference between me and them" "Skills"
"I gotta be me, I gotta be fresh"
"Start sleepin', catchin' you off guard"
"Around rappers, I'm bound to sleep"

[Outro]
Got my heckles up
