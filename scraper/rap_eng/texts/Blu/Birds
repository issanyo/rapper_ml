[Verse 1: Blu]
Word up, true pimp
Rock ice that donâ€™t drip
Too nice, but don't kiss
She fell, but don't trip
Tight grip on the mic, It's like this
How you dip, slip right in my life?
You like fish in water, I can't breathe
With you pulling cards out of my sleeve
I'm like trick
Pulled a hat on a rabbit, tryna catch it
She heard the Johnson was magic like
The light switch turn on
Got the burner on
You gotta stay protected in times like this
Let a man bust in, I start busting
Left the boy handicapped like ...
The time ticks, the night switches to morning
Your bird's still chirping the horn
Just like a ...
Just like a ...

[Hook: Blu (x10)]
Move 'em out

[Verse 2: MED]
Chick, please
Jeez, but won't please
Performing R&B
Jacket with no sleeve
Shit we G's round this piece
2-piece, box in the biscuit, KFC
Birds playing inside, smack cheese
Dollar signs blocking the eyes from bad weed
Do ya thing tho, spread your wing, bro
On the low stone, let the bruised knee show, shawty
Hit the party like she on that
Gobble up and get the dough back
Throw the stacks
It's not love but chicken scratch
Fix ya act and calling off ya income tax
Yeah, fear of facts but no winds but dressed up
Can't shots from a hen
I yell 'duck'
Past tense through a fence, I'm passed up
Backstage, tell 'em to bounce and round 'em up, then

[Hook (x10)]

[Verse 3: Blu]
I used to wonder, do they cluck for the bucks
Or are they sick from the duck
We run through em, dust the feathers off the chooks
Ride rooster
Let it slide with the shooter
Pinching me away
But too fly, high students
They kinda true and my love, we grade A
Red eye through the skies like melee (melee)
Mayday, you bomb, but don't blow
That's strange, I'm John, but I'm Blu
And I don't mean to intrude, but if I swoop
It be foolish from you to ask
What I'm getting into
Unless you meanstrual
That may offend you
But other than that, let her dance like the hens do
And I can put my Indian like a Hindu
And give her place to spread her wings with a friend too
Cause birds flock together, my swan
You ain't know what we do after dawn

[Hook (x10)]

[Outro: Blu]
What you do with the birds?
We move 'em out!

[outro]
Good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome, here in Los-Angeles, its four o-clock in the morning, after hours
Bring 'em on!
