[Verse 1: Blu]
Check it, uh
Jazz loops, mad shoes
Piled up at the crib
The bad news all up in the fridge
Black and whites, all red
All day, what a way to begin
A sad song when the rain fall off your lid
But the love for, I just might offer a rib
A long story
Probably never told you, kids
It's a long way from home when you all alone
Nobody calling on your phone
Dial 1, 9-0
Where the fuck is my folks
Them niggas on an other coast
Yo, this mo' I woke up
And I opened up the cereal box
I never got to the prize tho
I'm from the L-O-S An'
Jealous niggas testing
Need to find a best man
Go be somebody's best friend
Put down the weapon
Go another direction
My flow, other dimensions
I know, none of your business
Busy signal, sinful
Minded ripples
I be ripping through that fresh crew of losers
You was in
Probably threw your shit  over the fence
I know you wanna get in
But know you can't get in
You just don't get it

[Verse 2: Blu]
Rap Mercury, black burgundy, rap prime burglary
Certainly bout to murk that boom bap over that cool jazz
Curtains opened up
Behind the 88-grand
I'm on grams with my man
We making grands
You're shaking hands with the president of underground rap
The Best Lyricist Underground
B-L-U the smooth, educated
Adequate, accurate, a average backpack
High school dropout
Pleased to meet you
My name is Blu like the color of my LA hat
Your rap group is spoiled milk
I spit that shit out, I don't play that
Kick the shit out of the break and the sample
Make the bass catch claps like
High hats, they can't handle the swing on the samba
Hips on the Black Mamba
Mama, hot chicks in the sauna
Stick 'em up, I came to rob 'em
All of the sudden stuck in drama
Like fourth, I trap 'em
When my nigga rob 'em
