[Verse 1: Rowlan]
Damn what a crazy ride they can’t prep you for
Nine years they couldn’t prep me more
Release forms and all they said it wasn’t safe
Even the buckle's broken never question faith
No
The room went silent think it's time to leave
My stomach drop I feel the energy
I cut my soul mate off so that my heart could breath
Damn, yeah
It’s all been celebration or sacrifice
I check the mirror I don’t know that man
And I don’t recognize him in this newfound life
No, yeah
All these tendencies that you could hate me for
Enemies successfully forgotten
Reality that you may thank me for
I see potential so I maximize
Careful of the man you take me for
I met you lost and help you find a legend
Used to always tell me you could make me more
I do my best I try to stay in touch
Even prep myself for when that time come
You say I’m new, I tell you off
But still don’t forget that place that I’m from


[Chorus: Blu]
These days it’s been so hard
Chasing and dreaming and being pushed so far
These days you're on my mind
But I’m alright
2x


[Verse 2: Rowlan]
It’s self reflection more times than not
But go hit Genius so you catch it all
I start for me but when I end these verses
It’s so fuckin obvious I write for y’all
It was my way out
But now its our way up and shit
They say you saved my life
I said please stay up and shit
And no I don’t know love
But I like how this feel I guess
And look I’m far from broke
But I don’t got no deal, just stress
I been working like I owe my fam
There's more to this than just to talk to fans
There's more to this than just dropping work
Turn to a paramedic when I hit the gram
They spill their problems and though can't relate
I wanna tell them that they gon' be alright
But honestly I’m bombarded daily
Could read every word and still not know their life
They spill their problems no I can't relate
I wanna tell them that they’ll be alright
But honestly I’m bombarded daily
Could read every word and still not know their life


[Chorus: Blu]
These days it’s been so hard
Chasing and dreaming and being pushed so far
These days you're on my mind
But I’m alright
2x
