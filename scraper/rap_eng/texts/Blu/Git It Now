[Intro: Blu]
Uh, you got to get it
Right  now
Uh, you got to get it
When? Right now

[Verse 1: Blu]
Rocking steady with the rhythm, get 'em loose
They heard y'all rocking long enough
It's time to give them truth
They say they want a hit?
Here's a needle, find a groove
It's for my people tryna choose between sex, drugs and violence
'Cept thugs be lyin'
They say they fire two's when they bustin' in they rhymes
But they ain't got a 9 to shoot
Bet they got a mom Dukes who can't listen to they shit cause
It ain't fact we make tracks for people with they fist up
Prayin' spit to switch up
But that's asking too much
They feel real content selling lies to make them two bucks
Hanging on a dream that one day they finna move up
Now they crazy, glue stuck
Cause move.meant got some new cuts
For trekking, yes
Blu 'cuz is with them too, ripping booths
Spittin' through the box labels thought that he would fit into
I rock steady with the rhythm just  to get 'em loose
Y'all rocked long enough
Its time to give these  niggas truth

[Hook (x4)]
Git it....now

[Verse 2: Trek Life]
I got so much on my mind, but I'm still flowing
Still rolling, writing rhymes in my worst turmoil, turn soil
Dig deep in the dirt
Rhyme talk, speak my hurt
You can hear it in my verse
Even when I'm at my worst
Ima take action first, spit action
Reveal me in it, you feel me in it
Cause even the problem's done it still be vintage
Others relate to it as the world keep spinning
I smile through these difficult trials
Keep ripping it, wow
Track like John and I reach out
So I have no choice  but to manifest greatness
Cause every chromosome given
Just forces me to make it
But it's so hard for ya boy
Lows only getting lower
But I keep pushing harder
I will not be slaughtered, drowning in these deep waters
Every rhyme scheme darker
Here's a life preserver, that's why I write these verses
Get it now?

[Hook (x4)]

[Verse 3: Champ of Move.Meant]
They told me I was born ready, steady
The type that hit the ground running
Form steady, every night fight from round one till the last bell
I take it back to four tracks and max cells
Y'all soft like pastels is
The combination of 9 years spitting
Now I'm hitting my prime
Dope for ever line written
I shine bright like (?) light
I send a tone like it's my fine birth right
The first type given
So best believe it, ima keep on livin'
Till I see 'em drippin' (?)
And I get my money up, call it fund raising
We taking more (?)
And we goin' out guns blazing
Tracking Blu with my crew got so much heat, y'all don't understand
And if there's no such thing as a short thing
We the closest thing to it
This step fam got a nice ring to it now

[Hook]
