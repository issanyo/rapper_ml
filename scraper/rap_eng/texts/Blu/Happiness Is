[Hook: Britain Park, Intro]
And all the rain just fades like sound
And there are days that bring us down

[Verse 1: ScienZe]
Thank you God for another day
Please help me move in a way where it doesn't fade
Even if it change, I made this lemonade
I wasn't getting paid
For every sour there's that sweet, sweet getaway
So where's the better way? I threw my bed away
I hardly use it now, forgot to stand its way
I'm laying tracks down, the only way I know
This Blackberry Bold, it ain't a metaphor
This little memo pad, is full of letters now
I keep it basic man, I'm trying to show them how
I'm just a Brooklyn kid, who wanna make it big
I want a comfort zone, a wifey and a crib
A baby with a bib, a simple place to live
Good credit and some music strong enough to give
And if this microphone can get my fam up out this hole;
I'll never leave this mic alone
Happiness

[Hook: Britain Park]
And all the rain just fades like sound
And there are days that bring us down
But on the days just spin around
Happiness is this. Happiness is this

[Verse 2: Sene]
Yo, Peep
I ain't gotta do shit to stay brown and lay down for the dirt nap
When cats bite, go throw rights and get my verse back
Somebody did me dirty on credits and I ain't sweat it
I'm on it and I ain't even heard that
Could be pushing herb sacks, instead I pushed the earth back
Felt sweet as pussy when my pencil brought my first stack
Recording in headphones, day I got my first Mac
I promised on that day my feet would never move reverse, Jack
Got my eyes, on a house in the California south
Eating gumbo, and dumbo, shrimp in the mouth that feeds me
Because my mouth feeds me, now needs me, future too boy I'm greedy
Fuck poverty, shit I rose up from it no probably
Makes pop laugh, makes mama proud of me
Daughter dressed like she won the lottery is bliss
Trust when I say happiness is this

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blu]
Yeah;
Happiness homeboy, William Smith
Big shark in the pond killing your fish for a pinch of delicious dishes
Vengeance of penny pinching, many men be wishing death on me, but never get it
Heaven's riches, exquisite feminist visits
Exotic products, fly mileage and a mistress, nigga
Days ended, stay fitted for living
It's that linen and them fascist; got my fashion looking splendid
Then again it may be childhood wishes
From looking out of the window when all the ballers was pitching
I wonder why that nigga been shine so?
Why that ten high folks, some things you couldn't imagine, with your eyes closed
Riding down the same block, pivoting with the thing cocked
Aiming at the age old prize;
Happiness homeboy
Yo, we won

[Hook]
