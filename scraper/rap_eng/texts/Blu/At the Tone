Verse 1:

My life is two-sided, similar to a wager
Leave a message at the tone or hit me on the pager
Me and you fit together like animals and nature
But we can't stand the fact that we both have different saviors
Tryna mine my way into your heart like I'm playing Minecraft
This isn't Watch Dogs, but my heart is feeling hijacked
I've put so much effort into trying to get you, baby
But you're just jumping away from me like a caribou, maybe
Maybe, if I kept going you'd soon figure out I love you bae
You're probably taking this the wrong way though
Maybe if we were grown enough than you'd be with me someday
But my soul has been yearning for your love, please don't go
I just strive for my personality to be perfect just for you
I bought you a ruby necklace and some copper earrings, too
I don't get it, why can't my actions just get through to your mind?
I must be blind, or we just have different likings at this time
I must not be the one, you must be looking for another
This sucks, I can't take it, just tell me if you don't wanna be my lover
My brain is so messed up when I just want it to stay complete
It's like my everyday life is changing, I thought it would stay concrete
And that's the truth, all of these emotions are screwing up my youth
That's why I try to keep it real when I'm spitting in this booth
Back to her, the unnamed girl I ever so long for
These mixed feelings I've been having is taking my lifeline offshore


Verse 2:

I've felt this deep abyss lurking inside of my soul
Just an infinite empty hole of nothingness on a sole
Feeling crammed and filled with sadness like I'm stuck in a box
Gotta make it back to land, cause I'm on the sea and you're at the docks
I thought you was my treasure chest and I was the key
Guess that wasn't correct, hmph, obviously
You know what? I'm done with her, I gotta focus on myself
And vibe out to some tracks, preferably Dizzy or Wyclef
Breaking free from all this pressure, this is my great escape
Now it's time to put my life back together, Imma reshape
If it don't work out, a gun is my last resort
Nah, what am I saying? I don't mess around with that assort
My parents been divorced for around a year now
But I manage to keep my head up and hold up my crown
I don't want anyone to bow down, I just want y'all to listen
To the realest words you'll ever hear from me, it's what I'm spitting
If I memorize my mind then it should run just like a train
My soul is my engine, and the conductor is my brain
Creating new lyrics to speak what I truly say
But I just wished that one girl would be my newly-wed
Uh, uh, but nah dude, I gotta stay on my grind
Take my time as I write and simply listen to every line
As I record, I can't complain, my words I speak are calm
I just hope that this won't be the last time I see my mom
Even after all of this, you better not have skipped this track
I just want you to relax and just sit and play it back
If you don't like what I'm saying, then I dare you to scope me out
Just know that I'll probably never live my life and hold it down
