[Verse 1: Blu]
She know that I be around the way
All day with the lights off
Turn my mic on
Niggas know we coming out of L.A
Ray West, play the K. West
Make 'em say yes
This is how we do it every day
You just on it sometimes
Like the one time
Jealous looking at me cause you broke
But your hoe know you're homo
Working that po-po
Fuck is you be doing in my face
All gay wearing all black
Take off all that
My shorty walk around with the gun on the waist like a true
You's a true
Tell the man I'm the man with the plan
And you'll never make it 'til the end
Let me begin again
She know that I stay around the way
All day 'til the lights out
Turn them lights out

[Verse 2: Blu]
Shout out to my niggas on the block
Tell the cops they should go home, they should stay home
My niggas make this world go 'round
And we do it with the girls now, don't be a girl now
Mad cause there ain't no room for you
We in the room with the boost juice
You a fruit juice
Don't be trying to kick it when you fat
And you can't lift your leg up
She ate a donut
Tell them boys don't walk up to me naked
Guaranteed you won't make it
You won't make it
This is how we do it every day
You know the money make you look small when you see us ball
Tell the squad you looking at the squad
No dogs, just dog with us
You know God with us
This is how we do it every day
All day to the street lights
We in the streets like

[Verse 3: Blu]
Tell me what the deal with the dough
Now that the feds and the po's gone
I need some more dough
Nigga, where the fuck I'm finna stay
Now the whole world is all mine
Maybe mountain high
Tell them broke bitches I said what's up
Who didn't think that we would make it but, we made it
Ask 'em how them hoes feel now
All night with the lights on
Turn them lights out
How finna ride around town now with nobody fucking with you and your rent's due
Tell him don't forget his day job
Or his pistol and his bitch, too
