[Verse 1: Blu]
Yeah, you know my name rings a bell
Or should I say rocks 'em. I'm shell toe rockin
Females I don't got 'em but get em with no problem
And I don't pack stadiums yet, I still rock em
And they still spell my name fucked up on their flyers
It's B-L-U, and if you see the E, drop 'em
It's like they dropped E from the beats E's dropping
Got your peeps eavesdropping and the world keeps watching him
(Huh c ya'll)
I see 'em checking out the scenery, they seem to be jocking him
Chicks scream his name out from the bleachers like they proud of him (BLUUU)
A product of a God-fearing pastor who was quick to whip my ass but his whoppings wasn't hot enough
So I flow conscious but still rep the Koochie Monstas
And still crush the competition no kid is hotter than (BLUUU)
Your momma's kitchen, beg your pardon darling listen
I'm a nigga on a mission and these bitches ain't stopping him

[Hook:]
Blu (Stop jocking him)
Blu, My world is Blu

[Verse 2: Blu]
So you can ride if you want nigga
I skipped class in school a few times but I ain't dumb nigga
Pitched grass too a few times but I don't pump nigga
Never was the fastest in class but if you put me on the track
I was guaranteed to run niggas
Like back when I was a young spitter
Bitches used to ask me kick a flow to em
Next thing you know I'm stroking em
But I was into older ones kind of like my teachers
On the first day of school I would say it's nice to meet ya I'm...

[Hook:]
Blu, (But you can call me)
Blu, (I ain't stopping till)
My world is Blu

[Verse 3: Blu]
And my mission's just beginning call it Genesis
I'm God's eye messenger but the devil's nemesis, It's no better predicament
I'm straightenin' out the facts cause you twisting it
Nigga this a Bridgetown crown rocker not a fake affiliate
I been in many cliques but this is where soldiers are bred
And many members fell off cause they didn't know the ledge cause
They heads got gassed up, they still ain't got no drive
I'ma ride till I crash and I still ain't got a ride
I move slow cause bro I got a lot on my mind
That's why I'm quick to get to pieces when I'm jotting my lines
Still grinding at the drop of a dime
Trying to rob the world for every cent cause shit I owe a lot to my moms
And I ain't stopping till I change it for my 5 little sisters
Cause the view from their window consist of strippers and hookers
And all my brothers see is the pushers, hustlers and killers
So I walk down blocks as if the sun had called me nigga
Mad at the world
But Nas told me it was mine right before Halftime
But it's 4th quarter and we just getting it
Lying for the benefits
I told you If I wrote I'm sticking with every cent of it
Cause if it goes down I'ma be sinking with my penmanship...just like a captain
And you can only imagine how much passion that I put in this
But some magazines try to rate me on how good it is
Please fuck a critic nigga this is my life; if you ain't put in it
Don't think I need your two cents now like you been pushing it
Cause opinions are assholes; They full of shit
And everybody's got one, if not they trying to cop one
I'm balancing my options...
I can be hustling on the block or moving rocks like It's under construction
Or really busting for change cause I want to come out of these boots
Like I'm superman here to save the day
And hear the crowd screaming my name
Like, "look up on the stage it's a bird, it's a plane"
No nigga that's, Bluuuuu
