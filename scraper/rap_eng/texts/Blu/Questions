[Verse 1: Arima Ederra]
Where do the birds go in their sleep?
Sleep
Where do they travel in their dreams?
How come all the time you see them,
their wings are fluttering and their happy?
Where does my mind project into?
How come you got me singing the blues?
Why's the world so far screwed so far screwed?
And people still are watching the news?

[Hook]
Questions
In the back of my mind
Questions
Killing all my time
Questions
Like who did what and why?
All these questions...intertwined

[Verse 2: Blu]
I got a question,
Whats the reason for your stressin'
And whats the reason behind my mind guessin
is the right time really the right time for me to ask you?
What exactly it'll take for me to have you?
Ayo, I passed you a note marked yes or no
If I picked you up at 8 would you be set to go?
Or would you diss me?
If I left would you forgive me?
Or be running up the block all sad 'cus you miss me?
Heres a question love
What's love at first sight?
If your heart has eyes, would they cry every night?
I got a question, what if I never got an answer?
Where would we be if I never stopped to ask your name?

[Hook]

[Outro]
La la la la la la
Doo doo doo doo

Ayo what's your name?
Where you goin?
Why you askin' all these questions?
I just wanna know one thing...
Wheres your mind at?
