[Refrain]
Yes indeed, I wrote graffiti on the bus
Now I'm on the cusp, okay so hush
Grown man talk don't interrupt
Tell 'em where you been Jay sittin' on the cusp
Makin' all existing stars dust

[Verse 1]
Trust that we go where no man before
Deep as any seashore high off trees
Those the purple diesel
I De-Bo decoys
Surrender my piece in the circle of emcees
Surrounded by b-boys and killer Cali chiefs
My words are like weapons
I direct them when I speak
Capisce and kush blunts
Quiche for lunch
Eat rappers like take out, bout once a week
Bout to make it once a month, hibernating in the cut
Sleep walking, writing raps, dreaming bout counting bucks
Bust still bust it free for my peeps
When we bump into each other on the streets
Cause we do it for the love, just to bust over beats
Rhymes, life; when it gets together dog
It sounds so nice, ain't it right
Tell Mr. Jones it ain't dead it just came back home
Had to paint black poems for a fake flat world
Tryin' to take back rap like a lost black girl
While the whole world naps and the sunshine showers
Sittin' on hills countin' down final hours
Thinkin' 'bout if I ruled the world
Now I already got the power

[Refrain]

See I found God within me
Now we kick free sipping on a bottle of Hennessy
Blazin' Christmas trees on the clouds of infinity
Blank out and forget a crowd is with me, forgive me
My energy can be gangsta, I wanted to be a painter
But decided I should live a life of danger
Remind me Pops to thank you, for I cock the chamber
Aimin' at top spots, and cock blockin' haters
Bla' bla' my Glock shot in the heart
Cause one day I got high and mistake you for a shark
Pardon me dog, why is it my artistry rots
Everytime I bring reference to a broad on my jock
Cars on my lot, all my money balled in a knot
Would niggas rather hear me rapping bout harvestin' crops?
Probably not, honestly I'm trying to be dope
That's being modest, I ain't trying to be broke that's on my Momma
Tryna figure how do we cope with all the drama
When there's so much room in the sunshine showers
And we're out here, tell your boys to tell girls
That we're out here, sittin' on the cusp
Making all exisitin' stars dust
