[Verse 1: Blu]
So glorious
Never was a valedictorian, more like a hip-hop historian
I kiss the morning when I wake up and thank God
Fresher than a born again baby, I stay fly
Since ye high dreaming of creamin' panties
And performing in auditoriums in Miami
Granted the Grammy's, they'd hand me the planet
You think if opportunity knocked I wouldn't snatch it?
"The millionaire, the mansion"
Reluctantly I let them have it (take it)
And they still couldn't fuck with me
I'm into more important things now
Like my Porsche keys and importing rugs
You know, important stuff
Tell Bubba once the tables turn around
F trying to end careers, let the labels turn them down
You boys on that same ol' chasing rainbows around
Trying to find a pot of gold but ain't no paper around
Nowadays they frown, when yesterday they crowned you
'Til they heard about all the new fans that found Blu
True fam do know, no matter what the pseudo say
"If you okay, Blu's okay, I will hold you down B"
Even when the business try to drown me
Under all the love I've received is where they found me
Boys talking what? Tell them hush hush they mouth piece
Because somebody with me will (blaw!) bust they mouth piece
Pro box feather weights, levitate out B
If you ever need ring, no doubt count me
In it, for pennants
Penmanshipping and handling business is what I'm 'bout B!
Bout to be bout some down South beats
Don't be surprised if you close your eyes one day
And they open wide to a brand new Blu soaked in ice
F being broke and hot, I rather be spoken broken English
Folding Benjies not Lincolns, Biddies
F was ya'll thinking? First CD I ever rapped on was called "Glory"
End of story, and even I don't write it down
God surely, records it for me
Glorious
