[Intro: Nola Darling]
I be catching flashbacks
To time before we spoke in hashtags
Sons and daughters of Midnight Marauders
Sha-clack-clack even back before we spoke like griots here
Now everybody say, "I remember way back when"

[Break: Sa-Ra]
Soupa Deville '78
Sun up in the sky when the clouds was grey
There we exchanged those ropes for chains
Some things will never be the same

[Verse 1: Blu]
Ayo, look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Ya'll niggas know the name and ain't a damn thing change
But I'm saying, the game needs to, get a make o'
Everything they play is just that same 'ol, same 'ol
Smoking on that Jane, yo, riding in that Range yo
These niggas still doing songs 'bout slanging cane bro?
That shit is way old, still getting paid though
Fuck you think we came for? To be on the Today Show?
Ya'll need to slide a few more O's up on that payroll
Matter fact, bring the money bags off a crane yo
Tiger style, like I bring that Wu-Tang flow
Used to bust to bust, now they do it for the fame yo
I heard that Jay still getting '88 dough, I'm sayinn

[Hook: Sa-Ra]
Some things will never be the same
As they came
Peopled changed
And everybody knows
Some things will never be the same
As they came
Its a shame

[Verse 2: Blu]
Ayo, the radio, the TV yo, and even the press
It was the reason for the stress that they pile on your chest
But I said "Fuck that!" Make sure the system in my truck stacked
I'm sick of cruising around the town off this bus pass
I used to bust back when ya'll was watching Rugrats
5'10" pimp, growing out that little mustache
Watching sluts pass, wishing I could touch that
Pose on the scope on that all black chuck hat
They brought the Chucks back, but who the G's above that?
Had them all whites like, "I dare somebody scuff that"
They know the drama, but it ain't no need to talk that
Feel bad cause I never brought my poppa's gun back
Run niggas when I never used to run track
Shit I used to get a young snatch off of one rap
I was a Slick Rick since I was a young cat - Yuppp
When I got that BDP poster I hung that uppp
Can't believe my teacher put me in a dunce hat once - Say what!?

[Hook: Sa-Ra]
Some things will never be the same
As they came
Peopled changed
And everybody knows
Some things will never be the same
As they came
Its a shame

[Verse 3: Blu]
Ayo, the Kangols, the jumpsuits, the fat gold chains
The 3 stripes, the Cortez, stacking old tapes
The boombox, the flat-top, the lines, and the fade
The beepers, the speakers the 4-finger rings
Rakim's G-Raps, the Big Daddy Kanes
The Biz, the real roxanne, Dana Dane
LL, The Fat Boys, Ice Cube, and Dre
Ice T, just ice, D Nice, and Flav
The Beasty Boys - Yup! - Even 3rd Bass

[Hook: Sa-Ra]
Some things will never be the same
As they came
Peopled changed
And everybody knows
Some things will never be the same
As they came
Its a shame
