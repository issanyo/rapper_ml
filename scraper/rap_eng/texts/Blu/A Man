[Intro]
So many people, that wanna know my opinion on the whole situation, but...

[Hook](x2)
A man, a man, a man, a man

[Verse]
I wonder
Who do you believe in? I know it ain't me
I hope it ain't a priest or who you see on TV
I hope it ain't your poppa, partner, he only raised you
And I know it ain't your mom, even though that's who you came through
I'm asking who you pray to, some believe in angels
Some believe in one God, some believe in Jesús
Some believe in all of it, and I don't mean a part of it ain't true
I know that someone started it, and I know it ain't you
The creator of them blue skies
The great blue sea, or hey me, a cool guy
Who few relate to like, I'm confused too, what does a Jew do
What does a black man in Iran who's never heard of Jesús choose
And who do you choose, the heart said the youth, the mind said the truth
The blind led the blind here to heaven with a sign saying 'I choose you'
But left you behind, like no one can explain it
It's like one religion can't contain it
And I ain't the man that's tryna change it, I just want answers
Live no cameras, fuck the propaganda
Many souls stranded cause they took a book for granted
Some planted seeds to feed the mind peace over greed
I just keep the truth that I read
World on their knees while their innocence bleeds
And you keep funding wars with money from your source
The shame is all ours, but God, I'm all yours, save me
Before the doors close and them horns blown
And I'm alone in my grave thinking maybe
I shoulda prayed more for peace, love, and unity
Between you and me, no matter who you choose to be
Pop telling me that, the Muslims won't make it
And the Muslims telling me my pop won't make it
Yet they both praise Him, night and day raise His Name
Until they day he came back to claim them
Is one gon' save them? And another take them? Doubt it
They telling me I shouldn't live without it
Belief, relief for the doubters, it keeps me clouded
Confused while I'm doing the knowledge, but my God said choose
I choose you, who do you choose?
I hope it ain't me, 'cause I'm just a MC
