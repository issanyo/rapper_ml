Responsible for our actions
Stash the cash before realizing what would happen
Now it gets tragic. More than we would imagine
Enslave the masses. Surrender assets
Patriot act like they ain't underneath our mattress
Radios tapped on every berry that is black
And the media's fascist. Feeding us only the fat
While they speeding up the meeting. Fuck concealing of the facts
I see it at last. There's a method to the madness
They take our freedom than lead us to the traps
From actions to actress. Politician passed us
Wearing the mask, and as we ask “Who's our master?”
Reveal the evil. Belief we battle
Without God or Jesus. We just sheep and cattle
Sleep, eat, paddle through the griddy and the gravel
For a little love when the money's all that matters
Yeah, it's so sad that we're too blind to see
That all our beliefs came from the same tree
Same roots; new leaf. Same rules; new dreams
New scheme. No beef, no pig. All from the same thing
So sing, dance, dream. Start rapping
The take the heart, but they can't take the passion
It's time we get active. Take back the power
Ever since the kid from the patch went sour
Scream out loud, real proud, as we wait for the day
'Till they take me away, all I say is
