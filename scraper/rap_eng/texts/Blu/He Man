[Verse 1]
Ayo, its beautiful as beautiful gets, suitable musical riffs
With the Ruger, two stepping prince
Im a ruler yo, definite slick, rebirth of the cool
Birth of the new with this new version of blues
In the street niggas begging for food, playing the fool
Playing with tools, We kiss the night giving it jewels
Living the life of the limitless rule, My vision Abdul
Im seeing Kareem, milking my dreams, kissing the moon
My wishes are small
Shit you did with a ball, I did with a bar
Dipped with a broad, A crib in the stars
Illustrious feeling guitar
She got me amped like I came up in Watts, living in Mars
Women and Cars, Its funny how priorities loss
When more importantly, you become who you're born to be boss
I see you talking it, You dont need no nigga for parking it
Weed sparking it, we been living it now we barking it
Perfect person to share an apartment with
Im more of the perfect person to kick a verse to
Dream farther with, and here we are growing apart
Farther in width, No one to talk all of my shit to
How am I the shit? Part 2 of the blues
I wish.. you was here
Loves just keeps get it more fucked up, every year
But it's clear, cause she made it clear

[Hook]
I just want a He Man, A love that last for times
And I just want a He Man, Your heart close to mine

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I know you dont think that its cool to up and leave me
When you know I know half of them people you seen on TV
Yo believe me my queen, when there ain't no one there to king me
I'll be chiefing, turning castles to teepees
Fuck a VP bitch I've been that, been backwards and been back
Got shut up and woke up, Another day to kiss that
Like I wonder what it's like to be
So beautiful people fight for me
Truthfully, I will fight for you religiously, righteously
Evil over Ego, you know I got the right to be emo
Although we know all in front of my people you put a knife in me
Niggas say i sold my soul, I just told it bold
You was a wife to me, bitch you said you would die for me
Then you turn me right around when i got my crown
Cause you know I've been around and this is your town
Makes you really miss a smile when you get a frown
You fell in love with my potential, I get it now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She the one that thought i'd be God if I didn't rap
Thought i'd be a true chief if i didn't smoke
I thought that I was Kool G. tryna get you furs
Gucci purses and products, but i take them back
I promise that I'll be more modest if you take me back
And i won't run and blow my stacks on a Ti$a bag
Complete the map I've been making for my thought
And plus that book on my life that nigga Siddhartha authored
As a queen, what you think a king's dream?
Between me and you it gets deep, but do your thing
I'll be your back, be your black, be your anchor
Be your mack, be your match, and I thank you for that
And I'll be back, til then
Hope the wind gets to kiss you when nobody does
And if it whispers I loves you, I most likely was
Flip a coin down a bottle make it spin
If it wins we can dream it all again

[Hook]
