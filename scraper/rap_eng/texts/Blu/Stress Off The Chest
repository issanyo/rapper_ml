[Verse]
I'm from a city where pollution is ruining minds
More than lungs I'm from the source of Los Angeles Times
Rhyme slums spit ghettos and barrels and kettle minds
Whistle riddles of hitting switches
Singing carols of crimes
Shine dimming, spine's itching to snap from backs
Parallels are being broke trying to fit into gaps
Of infinite traps, the projects invented for Blacks
To have problems
I'm giving it back cause that's nonsense
Com sense and black I've been calm since
Mom spit wisdom of the system I was brought in-to
Walking through the walls made to hold me
Homie papa once told me he was part of this group they called Piru's
Niggas get bright over chips, they grip riffles as means for survival
And he was once my idol, so how the fuck I think I'm raised to think
My mind's too deep, a visionary never raised to blink
Cleanse my soul brush my teeth
Spit in faces fuck a sink, repent before I sleep
Cheat religion, a nigga fina piss on each amendment
Wipe my ass with the Constitution
Constipated feelings trying to shit it out
And get it out of my system
A frustrated nigga pissed, cause they tricked me
They fed me bull instead of full course real when I was empty
They made me believe the world's against me
They told me they was friends of me
Closed my eyes and pre described my enemies
Without no one even offending me
But eventually I learned though
I opened up a journal and I found eternal me
Drowned under a seashore of unsure facts
So fuck that we got beef
Not only did you mix up my picture of life
But you twisted my sight
You had me writing shit and spitting it tight, to my people
Sold it to the labels and they sold it to my peoples
More lies to believe in, on sale for the Christmas season
12/25 gift wrapped and more deceiving, it's deep isn't it?
And if you with me than you feeling this
Mind rattled rhymes off without a sense of time caught in between a thought
And a heartbeat, niggas think as far as they arms reach
Or as far as they eyes see, but fuck that I think way out as I mind reach
And ya'll way behind me
So next Halloween, be a condiment and try to catch up
You can find me cloud 9 in with my head up
Designing ways to eff up the world
A vindictive little fuck but disguised as a pearl so girls like him
Still writing, I bust raps that impregnate thoughts
That can give the world light in the dark
A verbal Viking still riding the ark
With a nine millimeter shooting seeds of light right at your heart
I got a grip with a grip of bullets and if I pull it it'll blast comments
And comments with conscious thoughts coming out of it
So don't test him, you might be smarter
I doubt it cause my mind's darker
Write in permanent black marker over asphalt
Walk like my dad walked, talk like my mama but I think like my grandfather
Ain't no prescriptions needed for me I'm a man doctor
I can stand lots of shit, don't try to talk me out of it
Grinding like an occupant
Lost as a prophet is, waiting for apocalypse
Chopping it with college kids, a school dropout with a scholarship
To teach niggas how to spit
And it's a mess that just started, nigga
