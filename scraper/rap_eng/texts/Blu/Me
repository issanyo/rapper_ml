[Verse 1]
Yo I've been in this world for about 16 years
But love and respect is something you dont find here
So try the next planet, fly your plane and then land it
And tell me what you find, if you even understand it
I've been searching and lurkin' for something in the shadows
But all I could find is jerk offs and assholes

[Verse 2]
Yo what has this world come to?
I've been stabbed in the back by the people that I run to
Now I ride by myself with the music and my friends
The ones from the beginning that will stick 'till the end
Yo we don't pretend we're tryna cop a fucking zip
Roll it up, burn it up, and put the blunt to your lips
Yo we call that "The Daily", no need to hate me
Cos we got the dro that will mindfuck your lady
Plus I got the flow that will make her say whoaa
This kid got flow, fasho

[Verse 3]
Now it's not a big surprise that I'm slowly on the rise
It's bound to happen when you got your eyes on the prize
I got too much to drink, too much to think
But I still got more flow than the water in your sink
I'm on the brink of reality, so don't get mad at me
When I diss your favorite rapper very happily
They'll never know me, so there always below me
So they can blow me, that's how much they suck my homie

[Verse 4]
Yo fuck everyone and anyone who doesn't get it done
I'm just out here tryna have a little bit of fun
The only Vacaville sound, so you better bump it
Fuck it cos most of you faggots are fucking puppets
Follow a mainstream rapper and everything that they say
And all they want is for you dumbfucks to get 'em paid
That's why the lyrics suck dick, so you can understand
But I write about whatever cause I'm a free man

[Verse 5]
I do whatever I want, cause I'm not tied down
Well I am... but only by the words that I write down
These words are my life, it's a way for me to express
The words in my head just to get 'em off my chest mothafucka
