[ Verse 1 ]
I told 'raach I need a crown
He gave me chakra wisdom for the third eyebrow and now
Well spoken and wrote like a true poet
Felt heroic at first and get your hearse
I was born again
Like the church say to rope em in
Praise god down on earth rocking gold skin
Letting my ego go again
Trying to make space for my soul within
Somebody told me then
I said I'm getting in
You smell the tortoise and the hare tale up in the air
Bed hair, used to toss tails in the air
Taught some heads how to get ahead of billionaires
No feelings but the thrill is there
And no shilling for the children's care
It's just chitlins for the niggas there
You know ????? learned to swim scared
I'm just making more noise to fill a void that isn't there
I swear
Gods rock gems
Kings rock gold
And hoes buy ice for the price of their soul
They say keep what you know
It increases as you grow like interest
So invest in more
Crowns

[ Verse 2 ]
I told joe I need a crown
He said visualize a price before you shout the prize out
Nevermind a mind in doubt
Found out when I shouted out "the king has arrived"
But got crucified
I wonder who's next
Losing line pompous
Like I heard his conscious ain't true as mine
Pow! shot down for such a stupid line
Remind me of the dude in the mirror that used to rhyme
My mind clear, divine sight to overstand knowledge by acknowledging life
It's like molding this globe, it takes both hands
I balance planets on my fingertips
Looking back at life like I'm old, damn
Hipping kids to my old plans
Like if the master asks have you seen the coats just say no and dance
Picking cotton is the easiest job I've ever gotten
It's like throwing products in the shopping bag
Fuck you doing with a prada bag, trick?
Can't bitch cause I'm bout to buy my dad a jag right quick
Tight grip on the mic
Give a shout to my ancestors for living their life
Walking over cloverfield like shit's starting to feel right
Rebuilding then chill drunk can't wait till my kingdom comes
Young child, smile
You think I'm grinning now, just picture me in a
Crown

[ Verse 3 ]
I told my mom I need a crown
She said put your head down and picked the thorn out my scalp
I smiled like I seen her now
Like I smiled on the culture so bare with the essence I had to bow
Proud to be where I was found
On the ground
Still feeling like I'm in the clouds
Haven't smoked for a while cause my highs had me feeling down
When I'm around crowds can't seem to hide behind the frown
I even tried to be like a clown and paint my face on
And keep my faith strong in a movement that got their brakes on
But why make songs
Eight long years spitting spins with a cape on and couldn't even save J barnes
Let alone those hoping for somebody to give them some soul over this okey doke
And when you blow don't forget about the people
They thought I sold my soul but I just sold them my ego
Counted my change, realized it wasn't equal
Doubted my name until the game became my easel
Fuck blu
I'mma paint the town you
Left home like, you can have my throne, and my crown too
