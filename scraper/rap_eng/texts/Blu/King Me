[Hook: Blu & Sene, alternating]

I just want to be a king
Chip on my shoulder and in my ring
Pushing big wheels, Chicks on my shoulder and on my ding
With a Magnum on the clutch doing big boy things
No exaggeration love
Every Bridge boy dreams
To be king!

[Verse 1: Blu]
Be President Barnes, impeach G.W. Bush
Push BMWs, Kush chiefing
Drinking W down, Double-bets
Humble-ness, finally got me a crown
Speak loud, mumble less
Speak less, settle down with a queen
Leave stress, in the dust with the ducks
Pedal down in the clutch
Duck split, blunt lit, in a ruck
Fuck penicillin, this is medicine
When I be feeling like giving up -- Shit!
Quit giving me shit
Give up, slush ‘til I get drunk
Crush grapes, what a lush
Gold rope -- what a show off
Plus, my shoulders got dust I’m trying to blow off
Plush, got a tell-all
Trust how I sell off truth
Threw the boots on, Rock the bell off, fell off the roof
Shooting too high, kiss the blue sky
Follow loot, swallow pride
Empty fifteen ounces outta my forty ounce bottle, I’m
Caesar with a better line
Doc Marten, with a darker side
I’m like the story of Christ written in clever rhyme
Never measured, none-comer ever better
Dumb-dumb, forever fresher
Live like I press pressure, less effort
And I still leave the scene the best dressed
Me and Sene in a Lex
About to head to the West
In separate jets
Check the press, heifer I’m a king

[Verse 2: Sene]
King Midas, King Tut
Gold is anything that I touch
So everything that I touch comes, I trust none
Plus, Corrine we like a million plus sums
So come fuck Young, in the back of that black junk
Ghetto bucks, bomb breezies
And tax dollars killing freedom
No Games on the schedule, we hunting, Sene season
Plus I’m high up now Caeser, you can take that robe
And if the crown gets re-fitted I’ll be posted by the throne
Rolling Cali blunts, and mail them all the way home
So all the Nostra Ave.-ers chilling and they eyes look blown
And when I return to the K, they like ‘Aye--You ain’t grown!’
So I might as leave this pond
I’m a king, now though

[Hook: Blu & Sene]

[Verse 3: Sene]
Holding my own homies hostage ‘til they meet my request
And can’t release ‘em ‘til I see the karma’s coming correct
‘Cause honest truth is, you been losing while scholar was on the bench
Now the pitcher’s on the mound throwing darts, signing checks
I’m a beast
I moved on, but God
When I’m beef, I put a bully on the corner
Make him suck you off for cheese
And plus, if it’s skills, I’m well above decent
Your a dame on a side team
Don’t wanna fuck frequent
Don’t trip, rock with it
Control those lips
‘Cause your gun is made of paper
I can fold that clip
And homie, your team knows me
Ask ‘em how I get down
The Stretch Armstrong
From Brook-lawn to Bridgetown!
