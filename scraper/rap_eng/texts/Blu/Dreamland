Dreamland
Give me your hand
Let me take to my dreamland

[Verse 1: Andy Allo]
Last night I saw Charlie he was walking with his cane
Then he came crashing down on the pavement
In amazement I gazed 'cus I didn't know what to do
Tears streaming down his face
How could I ever replace the memory of his pain
He had a cast on his leg
Eyes are bloodshot red
Oh if you knew how i felt
I'm so sorry Charlie
For being so weak

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Blu]
Escapism, chase wisdom if you dare to
In the cloud steez, lampin' in a mansion off the Nile
Breeze blowing off the days
Warm smile,fell back into the maze
No way out, the playhouse the car cost
All lost, its just life
Living it lush like Nancy Wills
Brushing off my cuff links
Thinking about my last dance, sleeping on my bills
Taking stills, living in a film reel
Chills build through out me, when I feel ill about you
Doubt you feel the same
Still I return to learn more, followed your folklore
Floating forth in a lucid state of truth
Tasting the juice, sunbathing on the pavement
Woke up in a rolled blunt of amazement
Gazing, walking through the days
Dreaming about a jewel

[Verse 3: Andy Allo and Blu]
Let’s take a jet and get to this place
That I never really been to
Where
If I knew I would get you
A first class ticket on Jet Blu
I hope its somewhere special
I hope it is too
And don’t forget to bring
Um, a couple extra spacesuits
Make the moon smile
And the sun glow
Take the show on the road
Make tons of dough
And now that we’re rich where do we go
I don't know, maybe back home
Drink some wine
I’m down get stoned
Go to sleep
Talk about it in the morn
Andy Allo in the house
We got Blu in the house
