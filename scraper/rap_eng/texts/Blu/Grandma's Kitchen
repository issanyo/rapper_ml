[Intro]
I ain't got no phone, no no home
No place where we can go and be alone
No hotel tho, no motel, she said hell no
But I left you with my microphone

[Verse 1]
But now I'm in my zone, ditched my cell phone
Fell back in my pad like
Damn, it feels good to be home
Blown off light
Getting cash to perform
Pouring out my soul, every night glowing
Sippin' on patron, no ice leaning
Like I'm throwin' dice
Flowing like this open mic
I told them if you didn't hate them so much
His girl probably wouldn't want to bone them
But oh well, she rolling
I told her..

[Hook]
I said love (?) my grandma's kitchen
I told her she can meet me there (yeah)
I say before we get to touching and kissing (kissing)
I got to make a few things clear

[Hook 2]
I said love (?) my grandma's kitchen
I told her she can meet me there (yeah)
I said I wish we had a car we could dip in
But I got a couple bucks for your bus fare
I say before we get to touching and kissing (girl)
I got to make a few things clear

[Bridge]
I ain't got no home , no cellphone
No place where we can go and be alone
No hotel tho and no motel, she said hell no
I left you with my microphone

[Verse 2]
But I was in the wrong
It's not like I was grown
But how can I be faithful
When I didn't have a place to lay my dome
I was coming from my homegirl's home
Showing up to (?)
Tryna clash, tell them on
Drop you off at work

Said it was all for her
After I offered you all of me
Pardon me darling
My karma's all fucked
So if you ever wonder why  I couldn't call you up
It was simple because...

[Hook 2]
I said love (?) my grandma's kitchen
I told her she can meet me there (yeah)
I said I wish we had a car we could dip in
But I got a couple bucks for your bus fare
