[Hook]
Wake Up and pray
Give thanks for another day
Take a little time to stop and praise
Then be on your way but first
Wake up
Give thanks for another day
Take a little time and meditate
Get busy then be on your way

[Verse 1]

Wakey Wakey, mans all snakey
Man up gracefully and you'll thank me
Stand up face the streets and proceed
Go leave the hood to more good
Knowledge is power, dollar is the model of tomorrow
Yesterday, present day, can I ball
A resurrection in my deck since I'm listening to beats just to see where my head is, bet it
Ahead of this I wreck it
Stress free I'm destined to be I once dreamed
Deeper than kings 6'3" I was 6'4"
Living his dreams in 3D
Memories visit me like remember me?
When we was free Jesus, Kings even
Think about it
Nothing odd about it
Hard for me to doubt it when I'm sitting in history
Pissed cause the only time you're benching me is when you're lynching me
Woke up and they was lending me money
Killing me many
And when I speak about it they just look at me funny
Like isn't he funny?
What is he rapping about now honey? Money?
No dummy, I think he said God
Apparently black people think their Gods
Have we been sleeping?
I think we need to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

I seen a lot of dreams at long beach
Chillin' in the breeze when you walk by the sea
See it in the eyes of most folks you meet around the lakes
So I know what they expect me to be
Just another MC out to be big Will
Get mills and park my wheels all up in the hills and peace, please
I knew I'd get this far, the hard part is putting art over the cheese
Artists tryna steal something weird from here
Trying not to leave a homie at the rear
I fear one and trust none but the G O
Even though the love for my people is sincere
Made it to the pier
I just became peers in this weird life like "How the fuck you get up here?"
Realized I was following a dream I had and didn't notice I sleepwalked out my little sphere
Smoke clear, mind open
Sunshine over 'em
Usually go gold as a God
Eyes is bliss
Wipe the crust out your eyes and shit and realize that you really God
But first you gotta

[Hook]
