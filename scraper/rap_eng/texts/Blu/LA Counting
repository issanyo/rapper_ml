[Verse 1: Blu]
Ayo, that 808 bass and treble
Them twelve by twelves echo through ghettos
That four by four hollow barrel
Put ho's through the homies apparel
Yo homie don't know me, so chill
44 chrome berries
You know my flow crime kills
My grill is a hundred karats
You met me out makin' paper
I told her I live in Paris
My shirt is a Liberace
You can spot me out with the man
I carry a milli with me
I spend it on all my ho's
I always be makin' paper
And that's how the story goes

[Hook: Blu]
Ayo, I grew up in LA County
And if I'm not chasin' ho's
I'd probably be makin' paper
And that's how the story goes
I grew up in LA County
And probably be makin' dough
And if I'm not chasin' paper
Then I be out chasin' ho's

[Verse 2: Blu]
Ayo, at '83 baby G
NWA-T
The feds know I'm makin' paper
But can't keep me off the streets
I'm cleaner than all you ho's
Cleaner than all you niggas
When clockin' I'm Flavor Flav
Makin' money and politickin'
And I be whippin' like I'm whippin' bricks in the kitchen
Keepin' that heat closer than I keep my family business
Cause, man, these bitches had your children on the evening news
Try not to sing no blues, but so many people do

[Hook: Blu]
Ayo, I grew up in LA County
And if I'm not chasin' ho's
I'd probably be makin' paper
And that's how the story goes
I grew up in LA County
And probably be makin' dough
And if I'm not chasin' paper
Then I be out chasin' ho's

[Verse 3: Blu]
The LA counter clockin' thousands by the hour
Cloudy in the city with a chance of money showers
She touched power like she heard about the laws
Lawbreakers making paper with the squads
Different cars, different broads, different jobs
All them clockin' paper like they work in different malls
Different clip installed every time I spit a bar
And every time I'm in the bar you see me with a different dog

[Hook (3x): Blu]
Ayo, I grew up in LA County
And if I'm not chasin' ho's
I'd probably be makin' paper
And that's how the story goes
I grew up in LA County
And probably be makin' dough
And if I'm not chasin' paper
Then I be out chasin' ho's
