[Intro]
Guy 1: Wait, whose this guy?
Guy 2: Oh that's Blu, yeah, but don't worry about it, he's legit
Guy 3: It's go time!

[Verse 1]

[Cookbook]
Strong to the finish 'cuz I eat my spinach never diminish
The tie that binds or masterminds the rhymes the size of Grimace
Rise of interest coupled with the time I spent on grinding gives this
Rhyming man surprising visits from the peeps in line to get it
The rap DiCaprio of rapid flow and rapping slow
You can bask in the afterglow the classic ask me McEnroe
Hot headed holy mackerel the Ang Lee of collateral
Damage the music admiral of cabbage supernatural

[Pigeon John]
Sippin' a Budweiser on a porch in a lost forest
And of course she shows up in a Porsche and I'm like why now
She gets out in a tight blouse and a jug of Hefeweizen, wow

[Cookbook]
Ha, you know how we do it every day
Every time I flip a style I leave the town in disarray
But this display you try to play I smack 'em make 'em history
David Beckham when I check 'em bend it wreck 'em Rachel Ray

[Hook x2]
Phenomenon one, phenomenon two
Me hit em with the rhyme and they don't know what to do
The rhythm is designed by the righteous man Blu
Phenomenon one, phenomenon two

[Verse 2]

[Cookbook]
Ug-ug-ug-ug-ug-ug-ug-ug-ug
Anchor tatted, anger manage pack my pipe full of my drug
My drug is love the drug of choice I drug my voice all through the mud
Now I'm forced to drink the poison girls and boys into my thug
You got busted with mollies by federales
I ollie over your folly and stay on track like trollies
The makaveli, making calls to Vali and Abu Dahbi
Still ball out like volleys
Spend my days in utter jolly (c'mon Cookbook)
The veteran letterman, letter depending better jams
The Penn and Teller pentagram on pendants on Pantera fans
The big hair 80's metal band with mental fans and devil hands
Cannot compare to Cookie's specimens penciled so genuine

[Pigeon John]
I'm up in church like the new Lurch
Deucey down to the tube socks so sweet that my tooth hurts
And my crew pops up leaps up to new perches
Loaded on the boxes I'm barely [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

[Pigeon John]
I miss smoking on the rooftop and falling in love
I know it sounds faggy, I used to wear my dickies baggy
Bump bump doobie, and kiss Mexican groupies
Now I'm back in a feathered hat. Where the cheddar at?

[Cookbook]
Why diddily, diddily, diddily diddily, dee
Rest in peace [?] we used to listen to him speak
[?] C.L. and Mecca were shocking gangsta [?] were jocking
As we drove by in Uno's jeep

[Pigeon John]
All hail El Salvador
Savior till later days
And the ways all lead to the same or relieve the pain
It's a drain that leaves you the same damn mouth
That packed up and took a plane down south like the Spruce Goose

[Cookbook]
Pedestrians, thespians, lesbians, equestrians
Love the luscious lyrics party harder than some Ke$ha fans
Catch a glimpse of fresher, man
Luxurious like Lexus brand
Hold your horses, Texas man
The rap Obama, "Yes, we can"

[Hook]
