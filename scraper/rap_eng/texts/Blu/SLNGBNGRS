[Verse 1]
B-L-U
Yup, he sell too
Niggas asking what the hell he do
Providing that ratio, what yo female do
Besides explanations got the details too
Plus the dude got more soul than a retail shoe store
Said it’s all good, she rock booze store
I say yall should let yo boobs show
Ayo, word on the chirp, I’m tryna boost mo'
No bull, wise like an old fool
Ray bans cover the eyes like old wool
Hey yo man’s a hell of a guy and so cool
Maybe cuz he rule like Sir Lance
Got pulled like a mule down her pants
Crafter with the lens first glance
Then jizz his at the end like Kurt ran
Dirt hands and my work stance
With the AK tho like sure man
And you would think the world would know it by the 3rd jam
Still make him say his name twice like Duran Duran Duran…
Duran should sell like the Duracell
Sat by a well in France to find the purest belle
She showed up in a bunny suit, furry tail
Talkin bout hurry up, I need a mac Flury (yuks)
She lucky that she cute as hell, curly flip
That’s what my current girl calls the world current
Had to stop by the 66 and pearl purchase
No diamond but she sure worth it
Car failed, oh hell had to slide my right hand in her purse
Just tryin to rap but couldn’t get this mic stand to work
My first but third never made it home
That’s what a hood nigga get for tryna say a poem
Alan Poe at the rave, tryna save some mo
And shouted new Blu exclusive
Played Grace Jones
Blame it on Savion, the phone got tapped
Last words was a slurr fore his bones got cracked
Past Christmas, home stay and rap
Snatched up his wishlist and smoked santa's of sack
Next holiday the hood got roaches
Mom said why? Said they has to be to notice

[Outro]
Lift it up, Peter Pan piss up in my cup
Swimming
Uh, twist it up
Sprinkle Tinker Bell up in the blunt
Ready
Yea, feel it
Ham hots on the Kristen Durnst shit
Yep, and is it real or do I only live once
Live it up
Uh yea, Lift it up, Peter Pan piss up in my cup
Uh, twist it up
Sprinkle Tinker Bell up in the blunt
Yea, feel it
Ham hots on the Kristen Durnst shit
And is it real or do I only live once? Nigga
Or do I only live? Or do i
Lift it up
Swimming
Sprinkle Tinker Bell
Oh well
