[Chorus: Blu]
All is on, now that’s about that way we can party hard
We got the juice the drinks, the booze the broads
The cars the links, the mo-, uh-huh
Well alright, well u-uh, and how’s your night?
By the way if I don’t ask, I tell right away you got a dope ass

[Verse I: Blu]
But fuck the verbal, you a soft gerbil
Tuff kernel when it comes to popping, universal
Blu alert you with the business, alert you with the news
You commercial with your written, I’m commercial with my shoes
My dudes like M-E, I do till I’m done
Don’t shine like many, I’m the one like the sun
You a bum and you bum with my bars, listen up
This is double entendre, your spitting sucks
You niggas duck after you rap, I get a buck
Not a shot, but I get pops from Buckshot
With the hot top rocking to the beat
Bass so heavy pop speakers when it
I’m the chief like Bambaat the uppercut Scott
Bad boy nine-six in this and we don’t stop
Pack noise and rush roys, corner boys that got a lot, not
But I gottta cop a block or at least rock a fella, I don’t mean getting socks
Seen nigga face me in the drop when I’m seen, nigga
I’m a beat, nigga, me, nigga, C-A nigga
Throw a peace before I piece a nigga, peace

[Chorus: Blu]
Go hard, ay yo
All is on, now that’s about that way we can party hard
We got the juice the drinks, the booze the broads
The cars the links, ay yo, the movie stars
Well alright, uh, and how’s your night?
By the way if I don’t ask, I tell right away you got a dope ass

[Verse II: Co$$]
Plus the dro pass to the left, that’s that Co$$, hotness
All up in the forecast, swear I felt the flow drop
Levitate, I don’t walk, I moonwalk
All about the dunk getting more cash
Soon y’all, feeling the global wasn’t inevitable
Better the flow, get to it, time like fine wine
Dripping from the cups rim
Friend it’s a fine line between thick and thin when you busting, illness
Ill then gets nasty, naw sayin’, they drop tears
I drop years in minutes and I kick it with steel tips
Get up in a nigga face, the same hands wrap around they sister’s waist
Momma see the I don’t see your race, love
I see your frame thick, the nameless to the same
When I spit it from the heart, they be talking out their anus
‘Cause the game is twisted turns, spank till the nigga earn
Got burned a few times, pssh, but you never learned
Return the pharaoh, the sharpness on the tip of the arrow
Can’t finish, don’t start with the kings of the architect

[Chorus: Blu]
All is on, now that’s about that way we can party hard
We got the juice the drinks, the booze the broads
The cars the links, the movie stars
Well alright, well u-uh, and how’s your night?
By the way, we got it
