[Intro]
Johnny, Johnny, I'm thinking 'bout you now
And it's Johnny, Johnny, I'm thinking 'bout you now
It seems as though I've known you for a long long time...

[Verse 1]
(Been such a long time gone) That I had come back just to flip through old memories
Asking folks that I know if they remember me
They like, "Nah, not really, B..."
Got me rolling up sticky leaves
In the park, where I used to play Little League
I even fucked by the courts on Christmas Eve
Niggas used to just huddle up and kick a free'
I miss the breeze more than anything;
That old feeling of flying through the sky
On a natural high, zoning out rhyming
Sun started shining, eyes start drying
Mouth got crusty, thinking "what was we?"
We was Gods... or damn near invincible
Free as stars, livin' life with no principles
Just students being taught through experience
Lost in experiments of life...
And it's been such a long time...

[Hook]
(Been such a long time gone
I often try to remember...)

[Verse 2]
(Been such a long time gone) That I forget how real this shit gets, it's ill
Some kids got killed in the past, and it was hard to get passed
But eventually frowns became laughs
I down a mean glass of Hennessy
Channeling memories, just to escape shit that's killin' me
I got a bad tendency to swallow yak and roll sacks
Just so I can scroll back time, simple me
Remember we was tripping off of Mr. T's gold chain
Wishing we was old enough to hold things?
Like drank and dank
Pornos and cigarettes
Now all a kid needs is the internet
I been feeling like I've been a vet rhyming
Still trying to get a check, grinding
Everything we dreamed about then is too hard to find
But it's still there stuck in the mind
Just remember the times

[Hook]
