[Verse 1: Blu]
Uh, yeah, yeah
Backseat of my jeep, I swing a episode
Young sister wants to stroll with a heavy load
She say "It ain't the way you bend it, it's the way you spend it"
She saw me dippin' and she hope I wasn't tryna pimp it
Tryna get it cause I fit it better
Met a red bone, got the Akinyele off my acapella
And I can tell that she was jealous, cause my love was lavish
It's like water for chocolate, but she wasn't Spanish
Had to happen more than daily on the daily, though
She say she "Ain't no radio", like "Don't play me, yo"
Baby go back like backyard boogie and bagpipes
I'm pulling niggas rap card bully like I smash mics
Lie smooth with the coolers at the party
Hookers in the lobby tryna keep me out the swap meets
But, mommy remind me of that G rolling by me
Blinking, the God Almighty he ain't knock-up nobody
But yo

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
She got style and grace
Oh, she's a beauty
Sophisticated lady like the ones from the movies
Her love is the ocean
Oh, I wanna dive in
Let me take it back to the old school, bring my girl to the drive in, drive in, drive in

[Verse 2: MED]
Uh, yeah
Miss porter we still mobbin on fear, bother
Rest fears on the cashmere, I still got 'em
You walk slick, thick
Behind wobblin', when I beat it
Probably can read in the crime column
My gift shit, heels lift lick from Cool Whip
Commit it, tho
Netflix used to be my hidden goal
Purple rolls in the elbow swollen
Gazelle still on the strokin' tail bone broken, oh
Golden Globe, fresh
Soul in flesh
Photo's set
Pose like I should have brought a Tech (blak!)
Through respect your finesse
Got me thinking weekends
Summer, fall, spring
Squeak em while I wig the singin'
Nothing like the realest thing
Don't worry, love never hurry
Make it hurricane
I'm saying, rain overdo
Full pleasure on the pedestal
Who ever bent
Nobody do it better than you, you, you

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
She got style and grace
Oh, she's a beauty
Sophisticated lady like the ones from the movies
Her love is the ocean
Oh, I wanna dive in
Let me take it back to the old school, bring my girl to the drive in, drive in, drive in
