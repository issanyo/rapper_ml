It's been a minute since we been here
Sincere six year
First string, dream team, keep your bench cleared,
Pristine like I'm Nick Teen's rich dreams
Switch scenes now I'm on some other shit deal
Diss queers cause I ain't one, play dumb
Girls know I've got a great tongue
Laying the moves down
The crown, the jewels, the pounds, and styles I got
Miles like mules
48k till I break, that's gold chain mind state
Grind like it's cool but it ain't
I make moves and shape
Shoes be paying dudes steps, brews bathe
The cooze is crazy in the movies
Some ladies, thick as gravy
In the groove sh-shakin' it
Making a move
Moo cause, milk is
Good for the body too, ain't
Built but I built the kingdom to rule
Hold hand got ring from the jeweler, championship shit

From the city of the sunshine, punchline
Up and at them eat them each by lunchtime
One time tried to lock me, couldn't knock me
Did a little bit but I got free
Now I'm on the block bustin' hot free's
Trust GodLee, chop beats 5 G's a piece, capisce?
I don't need no peace to work
I bought a piece so I don't need to work
It's crazy how mean streets be
Do my dirt all by my lonely, though
Mad cause I'm making money at home, beatin' her
Been there, smoked squares at the clubs with you
Big hair, Hollywood fan functions, yea
Family friends, the funds
The fun never ends let the madness begin again
I ain't even speaking on women-friends
Cause you here them speaking on me to their mistresses
Home girls, phone bill's through the roof, huh?
On the move, huh, watch how he move up
Scoop me up in an old whip
Bumpin' some old shit, he on some new shit, huh
