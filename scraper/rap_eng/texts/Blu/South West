[Intro: MC Eiht]
G-Yeah! G-Yeah! Who's that in the buildin'? That nigga Eiht
G-Yeah! G-Yeah!

[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
Another day, another dollar, my story to tell
Another failed piss test, I'm back to jail
Jail cells overcrowded with killers and thieves
Put in work motherfuckers, roll up your sleeves
A Comp Town representer I'm lettin' em know
I keep it hood with a nigga so hand me my dough
I don't play when it comes to bread or the rap instead
Then you kill a mu'fucker, til his vocals dead
My, crazy hood overthrowin' - shut up!
Nigga you see the pistol showin'
From the C.P.T. down with EFN
Between the beef and the peace loc line us then
The real and the fake couple lives could end
Couple of stripper hoes where you snatch the sin
Yeah! Mo' snaps, mo' problem wit' hoes
And a couple of jealous friends now turn to foes

[Hook: samples]
"Niggas from my motherfuckin' hood don't play"
"A real ass nigga til the day I fuckin' die"
"Always watchin' my back, with my god damn gat"
"And niggas wanna know what's the word"
"Niggas from my motherfuckin' hood don't play"
"A real ass nigga til the day I fuckin' die"
"Always watchin' my back, with my god damn gat"
"Crazy!"

[Verse 2: Blu]
Yo, uhh
I said whatever, I'm just tryna get better and better
I never dressed up in the dress for the cheddar, know how irreve'
Cock back the Beretta, blast at the fella for not havin' it together
I write rappers to life, not to death bruh
It's the mess that made you fed up with police
What they had up in you ass in these EFN'n streets
Now I can ask if it's bad where you stay but I already know
Cats can blast these shots out all day, on the radio
Grill face, eyes grilled, price got you skippin' mils
Dreamin' of spendin' mils with white girls like you got it made
Take a ride in my brand new Escalade
By the pipe, have the ride of your life, why you paid?
Then it's back to the thrill again
Cali bear grisly pen grippin' ends, while I'm writin' to the winner
Temptation say it's just my imagination
Racin' but my race will be the same in the end

[Hook: samples]
"Niggas from my motherfuckin' hood don't play"
"A real ass nigga til the day I fuckin' die"
"Always watchin' my back, with my god damn gat"
"And niggas wanna know what's the word"
"Niggas from my motherfuckin' hood don't play"
"A real ass nigga til the day I fuckin' die"
"Always watchin' my back, with my god damn gat"
"Crazy!"

[Verse 3: KAM]
Compton and Watts, both of them schools raised me
School of hard knocks and the blocks so who's crazy?
Fool be fugazi on that paisley wood
Never cease to amaze me but this crazy hood
Shit it raised me good, good wit' the money, hustlin' weapons in hands
So when it comes to flexin' muscle I ain't steppin' on no stand
Testifyin' about shit
So the same ones you runnin' from I'm hangin' out wit'
My fam gon' eat, fuck a empty plate
Kam, DJ EFN, Blu and MC Eiht
Only the streets can relate to the rhyme I state
People say crime don't pay but we say time don't waste
So just shine don't hate, or hesitate to go get it
Don't be blind or leave your destiny and fate to no critic
You just pissed cause we shitted on yo' throne
So tell em +Crazy Hood+ did it, on they own wit' the war zone

[Hook: samples]
"Niggas from my motherfuckin' hood don't play"
"A real ass nigga til the day I fuckin' die"
"Always watchin' my back, with my god damn gat"
"And niggas wanna know what's the word"
"Niggas from my motherfuckin' hood don't play"
"A real ass nigga til the day I fuckin' die"
"Always watchin' my back, with my god damn gat"
"Crazy!"

[Outro]
Crazy!
Crazy!
Crazy!
