[Verse I]
Hey young world I’m soul searching for my innocence, but in a sense, I guess I’m still a prince
Pardon me, while I’m drifting away, spirits are getting lifted today
Yeah, somewhere over the rainbow my duties calling
I ain’t Julie Garland with the ruby slippers but I do be falling
For sweet lullabies of better days, sunrise, butterflies, see a baby gaze into its mother’s eyes
Nothing eternal about the warmth of an inferno
Gasoline soaking in my thermal here’s a kernel of truth
Through the flames I return to my youth despite the third-degree burns a nigga learned to recoup
I used to say sky’s the limit till I started diving in it, the solution by ninety-five percent of what I defended
Intended to hold the same beliefs at the end of my road the boys turned to men and tend to revolt
And I’ve been told that fortune favors the bold but if she sees me in these streets she better pave them in gold

[Verse II]
I try to be a good nigga but fuck it I stood quicker by dicking the cross I carried inside of a wood chipper
Sniffing the saw dust like lines of yayo sent to my brain like a halo bangbro marched to my rainbow
Used to get rallied, had up had to switch my style up and gallop into the sunset it’s pleasing to my pallet
This is the fourth of nine lives, they say that I’m in jeopardy, curiosity could be the death of me
Don’t pepper me with dreams of celebrity that may never be just let my record speak no need to project my peak
Leo the lion, king of the jungle bringing a humble perspective from all of the things I stumbled upon
Homeland security, the guns are withdrawn, blast let misery stunting in the front of my lawn
Positive vibes so I’m depositing knives in my pocket nobody stopping all my positive vibes, plus
I got a chickity that gives me that affection I was flexing my weapon but for me protection, ignore the clocks
My heart was Fort Knox forget the pass bust open the door and locks, lovely chaos in my Pandora's box
