(Bridge)
Boys scouts, sassy bars, tours and the worst stars
Can’t forget the war hall but I want it all
(x2)
Anything you want from me
I will do
Yea, anything you want in life
I will find you

(Verse)
Aye, he said he want the mansion and a yacht and that prince drop top
Wanna be a Vince Hammer, get that Botcharon watch
I’m tryna pop bottle tops in New York top scluffin with the top dropped, bums I’m not hot
Something tell my woman friendly jumpin like it’s hopscotch
Wanna get bloodies, I’m getting blunted non-stop
Bro I want that top spot, or a comfy loft, just as how I want
Money gloss, print money, clip initials, I slut

(Chorus)
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK

(Bridge)
Boys scouts, sassy bars, tours and the worst stars
Can’t forget the war hall but I want it all
Anything you want from me
I will do

(Verse)
Noise city went to downtown, lofts and them parties on the boat
Want that ’87 Caddy with them gold hundred spokes on
All my hundred notes with the small face, Benny Frank
Send a private tester just to tell me how that ain’t it touch
One on each arm when I’m steppin in the place
And every time I travel by air I want an empty plane
Yea, empty plane every time I travel
When she had the nerve to tell me don’t trip it’s all handled like

(Chorus)
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Love is (I really wanna know)
Love is (I really wanna know)
Anything you want from me
I will do

(Verse)
With the chromers in the impound, cell phone massage
So rest already leg, you’re playin car but slot show
Mine was on another planet, aks me what they cost
Speakin what a fuckin waste if I kept it just a flusher
Country’s loud warrior, money ain’t real yo
Life is like this pretty, wonder how that make you real yo
Albums like the shitty, wonder how to make a millman man
That car is kinda spiffy, let me sit behind the wheel
I’m tryna feel it like

(Chorus)
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything is OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK

(Bridge)
Boys scouts, sassy bars, tours and the worst stars
Can’t forget the war hall but I want it all
