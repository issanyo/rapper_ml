[Intro]

[Verse 1: Blu]
I feel like a smooth criminal, going through a spiritual phase
Cause I give a fuck about who individuals praise
I stay humble like a lion lying off in the jungle
Lost angels turn animals tamed by camera angles and fame
Shame came and he offered me gold
I'd rather, compose soul till my soul decompose
Find me, deep in scrolls rollin'
Cheech and Chong chokin'
Drinkin' Johnny Walk with me till I'm deep in thoughts
Open, leading lost soldiers over the steeps
Where they march through the dark streets
Eatin' off soft spoken sweet cats
Shit, I speak Hulk Holdin' the mic like she never gives me feedback
So ease back, less you down to drop a couple dollars on this weed stack
Tell your bitch to relax
Asking me to introduce 'em to my peeps last
Guess she never met Ta'Raach
We rock the spot last love, but not least

[Hook: Blu]
Pour me another glass of uhh...
Let me see, some of that Grand Marnier
You can hear it in my raps that I've had a long day
But I'mma smash love, till I crash
Pour me another glass of uhh...
Let me see, some Courvoisier
You can hear it in the rhyme I had a baller(?) day

[Verse 2: Blu]
Numero uno, Blu no listener, soul prisoner
Whole delivery wrote in scrolls of calligraphy
[Injure ya?] by the end of the 16, elect on the 1th and 15th
Infecting my shit visually, till it's pristine on the big screen
Know I'm pixelated cause niggas ain't as crisp clean
With the mic, mean as I am
Shit I spit like irons in my fist
Cause every word I bust is like fire in a clip
And I am asshole pumping out ish on a daily base
Grindin', shinin' in a shady place
Feelin' timeless in a daily race
Find me sittin' silent with my face in the crates
Rhyme on my mind which is always on my money
Every single daily day cause ain't a damn thing funny
Unless you came to play and I ain't never play the dummy
So I came for pay until they take my crown from me

[Hook: Blu]
I'mma smash love, till I crash
Pour me another glass of uhh...
Let me see, some of that Grand Marnier
You can hear it in my raps that I've had a long day
But I'mma last love, till I crack
Pour me another glass of uhh...
What is that? Oh!
That blue label Johnny Walker
Less you got something harder, on that shelf you can offer

[Outro]
