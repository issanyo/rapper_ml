[Verse 1]
Leaving without a trace
Don't hit me after I've gone, I
Just can't stay in the same place for too long
I let you find me out before you lost your mind
You've been going off about the way I move in life
You didn't know I just wanted company at night
Gave me love despite my

[Chorus]
Obvious inability to be
Anything a low key lover like you needs
Though you're not religious, made you pray to me
No, you're not religious, got you on your knees
Don't you dare put up a front
Showed you what I was about from the jump
Had you dancing with the devil, please don't pray for me
It's too late baby

[Verse 2]
Recognize your mistakes
Kept lying to yourself, right?
Thinking you could make me stay
*laughs* Nice try
You tried to make up for the things you thought I liked
Please don't try to hold me down, you almost held me back
Time to find a new pastime boy, you got too attached
And I don't fuck with that

[Chorus]
It's obvious I'll never be
Anything a low key lover like you needs
Though you're not religious, made you pray to me
No, you're not religious, had you on your knees
Don't you dare put up a front
Showed you what I was about from the jump
Had you dancing with the devil, please don't pray for me
It's too late baby
