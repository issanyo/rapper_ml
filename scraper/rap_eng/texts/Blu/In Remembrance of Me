[Verse 1: Blu]
It seems like yesterday we was chasing an ice cream truck
Now we hoping that our ice bling plush
Which is kinda crazy right
One minute you're a baby and the next
Your sexin' without protection
And now you're holdin' a baby like
Damn, I was just in your shoes
Now your the papa that's adjustin' they shoes
Teach them to walk straight
Cause honestly they got a long way to go
And what you tell 'em now is all that they know
See I remember when My folks said you'll know what I mean...
When you get older, I was only a teen
Thinking that I was a grown up, please, I had so much to see
Thinking the little that I saw was all the world had to offer to me
At 18 I headed off into the streets without guidance
Just the eyes of God watching over me it's time
I spent hours working 9 to 5's to survive
Me and Jack up in the shack started hustlin' sacks
Just to eat chips and soda
Thinking we finna blow up, once this demo gets done
We gon be streched out rich, riding limos and such
Boy I was just a dreamer
Rocking shows like we went gold, you shoulda seen us
We was full of youth, not yet abused by time
Its like I saw the whole world through my rhymes
Its kinda crazy right?

(How time flies)

Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
No time, time, time, time, time for looking back
Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
Fuck it black no time, time, time, time, time for looking back
But only you saw what took too many time to see
(Blu talking in the background)

[Verse 2: Blu]
This reminds me of junior high, when you and I first met
'96 was a year that I could never forget
Sunset summer school dance kisses chicken heads
Spreadin rumors, "Blu's cheatin' on Shameka with Anika"
We was bad, ditching class
Grass had us all gassed
I never smoked, played ball thought it would make me choke
By the way we lost the championship game by one
Slow fucker hit a 3 at the buzzer
My heart sunk I started crying, I was tryna be a pro baller
My first fuck was that year and still I don't call her
My own father brought me to her house that weekend
He was cheating so I lost my big V while he was beatin
In the other room, not yet abused by time
I saw the whole world through that girl's eyes
Its kinda crazy though

(How time flies)

[Verse 3: Blu]
How it flies....
My grandpa died the same year
My mom thought that I was too young to make this song
Because I'm only 22, but John Barnes has a long path behind him
I'm walkin in the shoes of a giant
And I was a fan of Jordan way before I knew Bryant
Lost my great grey suit but I was through crying
So I hear tears behind my suit and tie and
Now you can find it through my rhyming
Cause my timing has come
And you gon know my whole story by the time I get done
Rising like the shining sun
Reminding you how we came
We rich now but used to be slaves
We pushing whips now we used to be whipped
Rockin chains when we used to be in 'em
Still complaining that we victims of the system
Shit is twisted but shit
We came a long ass way
Yet it just feels like one long day
Shit amazes me....

(How time flies)
