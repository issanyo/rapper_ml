[Verse 1: Blu]
Shoobie doobie doo wop
I love you can bend minds too
When I was six I thought that I'd be the president
Now I'm 27 staring at perception in present tense
Reflection make you question what's destined his
Ma told G-Ma, never say never to a kid with a pigment problem
Poli-tick talkin' pig men pinching them pockets for their pension, prosperous
I should stop eating bacon and fat alone
L smell brought'em right back home
Homie caught me banging riding on chrome
Out of blown speakers
Stoned eager like a long tweeter
Out of space like a alphalpha gold beeper, Bet Buck told him that he could of got it more cheaper
Remote recieve us to promote the peacher
How can a rapper be the molt of preacher? easy leader
Easy peers, when they start using ears for spears
Same year that they started banning cheers for beers
The band clears at four
Four pours and another night bored, good thing I let another light
Lovers like Source Award
Goes to the new morals for sport
The Moon forces with you
Blu courts the issue, church
