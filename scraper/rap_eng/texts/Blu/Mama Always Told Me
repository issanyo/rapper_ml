Man, it's like my papa always told me
Watch it when you cross them streets
Chilling with your homies
Drinking 40's and you're smoking weed

[Verse 1]
See, I was a bad boy
Playing with my papa's crew and bumping Hugo Crenshaw
Looking out the window catching indo from my pops plant
Dreaming about the hoes you get when rolling with the big dogs
Killers, and I never seen him mad once
Cleaning off my fat pumps in my P.E clothes
Watching as my pops caught his walk with a G stroke
Pulling out his cake and I swore he had 3 rolls
Damn, I wanna be like those guys, the negroes
The menace to society's, public enemies
Chuck Taylors and white tees, that reminds me

[Hook]
Mama always told me
Watch it when you in 'em streets
Cause you be chilling with your homies
Making ruckus on them hip-hop beats

[Verse 2]
See my cousin was an MC
Wrote a couple verses, but at first his shit sucked
Got sick, but then he dropped it just to get cheese
I took his mic and found a nigga with an MP
We made a classic cause I shit quotes
Changed the game in 6 months
Give 'em what these kids want
Started blowing big blunts
Fucking off my shits drunk
Filling cups, killing guts
Living up to what these white folks said it was
Just to dumb niggas up
Having fun and getting drunk
Smoking all my hope up in a blunt
I'm fucking up

[Hook]
It's like my papa always told me
Watch it when you in 'em streets
You be chilling with your homies
Drinking 40's and you're smoking weed

[Verse 3]
Yeah, this is for the OG's
They used to call me Jean Junior, you the next
Yes, you was right, Blu is like a vet
Already yet I'm only 22 up in a booth
Giving truth, black
Aiming at the hearts of niggas arguing for 16 puffs
It's like they rather shoot gats than change [?]
Live life and change [?] and kids like

[Hook]
My mama always told me
Watch it when you in 'em streets
Chilling with your homies
Making ruckus on them hip-hop beats

[Verse 4]
West coast up in the host and finna blow the fuckinf roof off
Loading, holding truth to shoot the first fool to move, dawg
Think he Superman with his suit off
And you ain't half man, half amazing
You half man, RuPaul, you broad
Can't believe you telling niggas you hard
A 2 star soldier sold his up over too large for new cars with too far
To see the season changing, ain't it raining came and swayed us Mr. Hityah
Bitch
