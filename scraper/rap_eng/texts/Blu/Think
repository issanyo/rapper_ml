[Intro: Lecture sample]

[Verse 1: Blu]
Where does a thought come from?
Mind to one times one equals one
Maybe two, maybe eggs fell out the womb
Maybe June, maybe man made moons
Made you, made me, maybe
Not really, when LA took 17 milli
God speed one, not mach speed
No stops in the drop, don't drop me
When my tape drop, give it all you got
All the way up to the top
Only way I'm finna pop
Is if I keep blowing up
On your way up to the top
Tell 'em stop slowing up
You ain't gotta wait up for me
I'm already on the up

[Bridge: Lecture sample]

[Verse 2: Blu]
Uh, I was always taught think before you talk
I jogged alongside my train of thought
It ain't a wrong way to write a song
I be up at 1am all day long
I be up at 1am all day long
You can yawn if you want, I stay awoke
I heard Thelonious Monk play a note
My soul doesn't want to chain a boat
If I wanted to fly, I'd take a toke
What can make a man cry, you never know
The eye in eye is all she wrote
The eye in eye is all he wrote
I walked into the sky, but didn't fall
My real eyes realized it was a thought
When Mike was midair, the frame was caught
Here, take a little walk
Hm, here, you can breathe, talk, look here
Touch, count to five, wake up
Look, look alive, stay up
Look, look alive, stay up
