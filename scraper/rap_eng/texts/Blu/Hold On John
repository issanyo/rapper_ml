[Verse 1: Blu]
Yo, uh check it...
Another lit cig, another cracked brew
Another low point in my life
That I can't wait to pass through
Another joint lit
Without a brother I can pass it to
Another black suit I gotta buy
And I've had two
Another rap crew lost that thought cash rules
Another permanent scar in place of arm tattoos
Another nigga with a attitude
Sending up another prayer to God
To forgive me for all my bad moves
And other bad decisions, and bastard acts of vengeance
Another Christian lost religion over Baptist visions
Another doctor diagnosed another cancer victim
Claiming another aunt
Before we had a chance to kick it
Another clinic visit due to unprotected love
Another sin I pray that
God one day can cleanse me of
Before he sends me up to rock with yours truly
I gotta make it through these hard times
John sing it to me

[Hook: John Lennon & Blu]
Hold on John, [yeah, hold on] John hold on
It's gonna be alright
They say it's gonna be alright
But I'm just tryin to make it through
These hard days and dark nights
You're gonna win the fight
For real I hope so
They say without pain we won't grow

[Verse 2: Blu]
Another heart that I broke, that's beyond repair
Another unanswered question
Like why are we here
Another desire, despair, distrust, destroyed proof
Another voice in the booth
Sick of avoiding truth
Another poison pollutes another boy in his youth
Another minimum wage for that employee with roots
Another choice
But I choose to toy with my tools
Instead of building another reason, we joyfully move
Another boy that we grew
Under another crack addict
Another reason to pick up another bad habit
Another cat broke
That don't believe cash matters
Leaves another back broke
From another slash at it
Another case catchin' up another black rapper
Another second with her
Shit, I would've back slapped her
Another one of dad's patterns
Passed down to me
'Til I heard my grandpa up in heaven
Screamin' down to me like
Hold on

[Verse 3: Blu]
Shit...then I realized
It's just another sunny day
Without no chance of rain
Another reason we should
Stand hand in hand and sing
About the fire that's inside
And my boy fans the flames
When he calls me up
And says he understands my pain
Another chance I have to open up the door
For opportunity
I use so I can stand for something more
In my community
Another chance to tell my mother
What her love can do for me
If she takes a chance to hear
The way this music moves through me
I tried the schooling thing
But I'm a stubborn human being
Another kid without a voice
But still I choose to sing
They never told us we can rule as kings
They want us doing foolish things
Like fighting wars and shooting teens
To me that's just as bad as bangin'
And moving keys
I prayin' we choose to lead the part
In how we live this movie
It's either weed or it's this E&J
That's getting to me
Hold up I think that's just an angel
Singing Lenon to me

[Hook]
Hold on John, John hold on
It's gonna be alright
They say it's gonna be alright
But I'm just tryin to make it through
These hard days and dark nights
You're gonna win the fight
Yeah, okay I hope so
They say without change we won't grow
So I'm saying
Hold on (Yeah... Hold on...tight)
