I got a question

Could it be love
Could it be true
Whatever it was I've seen last time
I dreamed I knew what i would do
Could it be love
Could it be true
Whatever it was I've seen last time
I dreamed I knew what i would do
Could it be love
Could it be true

Yeah, could it be the L-O
I thought I caught up in that cigarello
So leveled on a plane, no jane
Just that special
Why explain that, peddled plug, fillin the million one
Time so silly to want, Wine like celli and
Sun shine like shimmy mi ya
Heart and me be god
Be godly and shine, singing accapelli
Not nearly Akinyele
But me so ready to slide, got the telly key
Mami, your kids tellin' me, never be
Life like a rebel because
The cause we see b, unidentified like
Magic carpet rides in the sky be the I
The I, I, I, I wish I could fly but hold it down
So sound, the ground be spinnin' round my life
Tryna kick it with no need to lie

Can it be love
Can it be true
Whatever it was, can it be you
Whatever it was I've seen last time
I dreamed I knew what I would do
Can it be love
For you
For you
For you
