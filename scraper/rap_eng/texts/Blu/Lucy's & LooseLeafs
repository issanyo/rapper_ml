Uhh, check it out. Lucy's and Looseleafs
Who is he, who is she
Who would you choose to be?
You and me used to be
King of a two a piece
Queen thinks jewelry; your dreams seem looser
But you're losing me loosely
Lucy's and Looseleafs
Who is he, who is she
Who would you choose to be?
You and me used to be
King of a two a piece
Queen thinks jewelry; your dreams seem looser
But you're losing me

[Verse: Blu]
It's kind of special how you kiss every petal
That my thoughts blossom
Turning my mind into a meadow
It's kind of awesome
If you see me with the medal I'm flossin'
Toss it in the sea
Young Ali
Dreams lost with the keys to the city I stay in
Came back
Sleepin' on the street
Too much pride for Days Inn
Callin' up boyfriends
To play and make ends with me
Blazin' Saint M's 'til the gyms lift me
Out the clouds
Fell back into the crowd I envision
Backstrokin' through the river with a smile
Child in me's tryna come up out of this womb
Like it's my born-day
Birthin' same time I be murkin'
As a war stays
Killin' with verses
Women shift through their purses
Throwin' dollars at the work 'fo the cue of the sermon
On the surface I'm bloom
Calm, collected, and true
By your presence, therefore
Can we step into forever more?
Like Nia Moore, dance with me 'til the morning pours
More than us
From out of the day forms
Light, life, and love-lust
Mixed together like your favorite songs
Sounds turned us
As ash turns mud
I was drugged by the touch of a hug, unplugged
On some live from the studio audience
There she was, barely phased (sound distorts)

Live from the studio audience
There she was
Barely phased by the waves I rode
To the stage
She graced the same ground that has turned men foul
With a smile that could turn a proud titan to a child
