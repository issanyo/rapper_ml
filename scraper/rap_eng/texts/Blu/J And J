[Verse 1: Blu]
Yeah, and fuck a knight in shining armor
I jack music, put raps to it despite the karma
Bomb a sample with my candle lit flow, straight from the gutter
The illest muthafucka that Los Angeles knows
We vandals pro's, digging in the crates since niggas was in grade six
Skipping class and getting some ass
Get the wax out your lobe, open your mind's up killa
What kind of sewage are the loops to get your mind stuck
Criminal minded like I'm Kris-One, with Dolemite slick tongue
John link the blueprint, so that John can get his shit done
3 inches over six-one, spitting clips to kick drums
21 with a bullet pulling triggers 'til my clip runs out of ammo
Sipping Jack Daniels 'til I'm tore up
Robin Hood of rap jack and give back to the culture
Hold the mic steady, ready like I'm waiting on the set, go
(??) get the green like a gecko boy
The set know about them ghetto cats
Professional sound killers from the get go black
Where the West Coast at? We on corners sipping Coronas
Zoning, smoking marijuana in the soul of California
Home of metro cats, backpacks, straps and hoodies
Fully loaded mental, so them pistols if you push me
Fuck Sam, I jam goodie, you can find me where the hood be
(??) cats that act like pussies
The rookies of the year, with a champion team
Putting a fat ass John-John stamp on the league
First round pick, it sound sick don't it?
I hold it down, grab my seven pounds dick and send a foul chick on it
Freestlying quick, poem and they ear to get 'em moist
On point with that heaven sent voice
Roll up a joint, puff and pass it
Johnson & John another classic
Lamping in the cut writing national anthems like that bitch!
