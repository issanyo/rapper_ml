[Intro: Blu]
Make 'em feel extra special
But when you write the check out
Make sure you get the name straight tho

[Verse 1: Blu]
I feel like a local legend in about 7 galaxies
Plus I got angels in heaven that wanna battle me
But I'm a celebrity, there better be cheese involved
And no shows go down unless a few G's are tossed
I let my heat speak when niggas speakin' hard
Cause that's when they scheming on the niggas that be themin'
My shit be shining like the sun of the sun
Plus I hung up on the diamonds cause your dimes get jealous of 'em
Jugs busting out like gelatin
Buns like onions and I cry every time I smell them
Good heavens, I'm heaven sent but only in the present tense
Telling niggas exactly how long in hell we been
I'm 23 and haven't felt since 10
Didn't graduate, I never lifted bells in a gym
Skinny, I weigh a buck, 89 and a penny
And when Penny Hardaway fell off
I started spitting
Since then niggas been ducking me
No discussion, I spit it so disgusting
I look ugly when I bust it
And it's funny a honey still want to touch it
Even though she know my money is on crutches
But fuck it
Fuck it, ay bum theft

[Verse 2: Blu]
Got me feeling like Geronimo, Roc Marciano monologue
Puffin' cigars with my (?) on
We are three star generals
Be still principles implanted in my mental
With my pad and my number two, dude
So don't play me till you buy me
And in ya bitches whip is where you find me
And when she rewinds me
Tell she finds me
And we ride deep off the rewind, recline
Skeeting on the jazz bar design
She gassed off the fast cars we drive
We live, blast (?) at the bar
We arrive, bar smashed then
Talking bout I got to take a fat piss
And I end up
Hitting up some fat chicks
Squeeze her in the back seat
Hit her with some fat dick, it's class
So when I said it twice, I said the same every night
Lay the dame very nice
She take the pain very nice
And if I get her off the goose, it's a scary sight
I will take the blame if it's lucy, (?) pipes
She must have thought I was the marriage type
I must have thought Carol mics
I tell it like it is
Raise the price like it's shining and I sell it off the minus
You can find (?) us in the caddy truck
Blowing on the finest marijuana, let the DJ remind ya
