Keep smiling, keep shining, keep grinding

Keep smiling, keep shining, keep grinding
Traveling Man~, Traveling Man~

[Verse 1 - ScienZe]
Word-,Yea-
And pass the dutchey
Divine is on the left, and he screaming one gotta bug me
If it's one thing we bring to that table, ain't nothing funny
We done, dropped every song on the roster without the money
Took that shit back, every record is from the crib
Every mix down, no executives popping shit
Every follower was made from a drawing board (?)
Ain't no crystal topping the populist that exist
Now we out here, Southside, or Southwest
Making trips (?), outside without rest
Couldn't skip past actual fact, without stress
I accept mine, as long as the fam remains blessed
I'm a happy man, word-
Its all water for this captain, yea-
Straight from the boulevard of (?)
Every quest will bring a question, see my tribe is just beginning, yea-
I'm tryna see how far it gets me, see where life becomes the music
And this music keep me healthy, yea-
It's one click at a time, one bus ride out, one click in his mind
One plane straight to Europe for a cat in his prime
Ya'll can keep your dreams low, I'm finna' travel with mine
I'm finna'-

[Verse 2 - Blu]
Uh-, Yo-
Check it-
I had a dream there was a town full of queens
A town full of queens, oh my god I had a dream
What will they tell the kings, what will New York do with the kings
I'm from Cali I only visit in spring
Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring
I Always past queens, I always see the kings, and queens
Aye yo, its always kings, and queens, but back to the lecture
Had the piece by the dresser, let it dress you up
She never let that shit stress her
Never mess up, never measure, none the lesser





[Hook]
