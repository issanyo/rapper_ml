[Verse 2: Dirty Red]
I'm fucked up i gotta' get my ass in
So i go home get them thangs' and a mask mane
Cause' right about now I'm thinking bout' that cash flow
Went to the first suspect house kicked in the door
I said drop off hoe you know this shit is getting thick
You better get me to the safe befo' a nigga click
And all the time I'm thinking about the M-O-N-E-Y
Before i leave every must die
Money or murder, that's what i was yellin'
With the AK in my hand i shot the fan off the ceiling
22 Gs 5 Keys now I'm ass in, livin' like an assasin so i started blastin'
I got the yam and the cheese now I'm outte'
Out on the track and these niggas wanna' crowd me
I pulled my gat, and started lookin' crazy
Damn be smooth you'll be pushing up daisy

[Verse 3: Lil Noid]
Yeah i sat back in the cut and see I'm waiting with some patience
I'll take these hoes to hell to the devils graduation
I'm reaching for my mask and you know I'm full of funk
Packs of blow won't let me go and see I'm feeling crunk
Creeped up to the house i waste no time i hit the window
Niggas in the kitchen smokin' weed choppin yayo
The dope is lookin' good as they placed it on the platter
I'm scoping and I'm hoping thinking blast em' it don't matter
Step into the room where they were and i waist no time
The clip is in my weapon so i blast for what's mine
So then i went to cappin' as i bucked them bitches down
[?]
[?]Scary bitches start to crying
Tell me where the dope mane or some of ya'll dying
Now I'm out the house, shoes and shirt on kinda bloody
The cheese is in my hand, and mane I'm bout that money
