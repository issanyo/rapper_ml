[Verse 1: Exile]
(I wanna tell you) everything that's on my mind
Let it spit out literal, empty confusion of mine (I wanna)
Be free so you can really see me and I can really be me
You ain't really hearin' me? (tell you)
Sometimes I think the illest shit
And you be feelin' it if I can think of a way to really spit
But the brain can't find the words
Sometimes the mind blurs plus blocks vagina finders
But (tell you) but it's really realer than that
Really realer than cats looking for quick cookin'
When I'm looking for long term mom cooking
I'll give you that long arm, strong sticking
So let me hit, don't let it thicken
My thoughts are thickening
For you to hear while you cookin' chicken
Naw, naw I'm just playing
But it's my thoughts, I'm just saying
I don't know what I'm saying

[Verse 2: Blu]
(tell you) everything that's on your mind
For the first time I wrote my first rhyme
I been entwined
Pencil and pad, cause it's the only way I have
To let you know how I been thinking
And the ink is just a easy way to (tell you)
So I hope you soak it up like the pages
One day it close mine and open up
Thoughts translate and say your ass don't fuck it up
And you get offended like you do, when you ask me the truth
And I try to (tell you)
But you don't seem to get it
All you seem to mention is the smoking and the women
Tokin' for the many different times  I try to say what's on my mind
But all you heard is what your girlfriend said
Because of what she heard
And when I get in the bed, I'm hearing  Patty's opinion
Or what Christina be thinking
But yo, fuck what they thinking, tell me what's in your head
Instead of what's on your mind
Look, ma I wanna (tell you)
All the cheesy shit that I don't wanna say
When my homies around
And I be home soon
So you know the code, 143
And when I get home
There's one more thing that you know I gotta (tell you)

[Verse 3: Aloe Blacc]
(tell you) Everything that's on my mind, I be steady on my grind
But you fucking with my time
And I'm a real cool brother
But I changed my phone number
Cause you stay on my line
And look here, you better not call me again
You really can't even call me your friend (uhm)
All the time that we even we did spent was because
My flight got snowed in for the whole weekend
So I'ma (tell you)
So you don't get to thinking 'bout a ring
Cause I know you hopin' that this fling
Is somehow gonn' magically turn into a thing
And have me up in a chapel with your family waiting for me to
(tell you)
I do, but I don't, you think I'ma fall in love, but I won't
Get it straight, biatch, it was only one day
Now you see how much talking you take
How many excuses you expect me to make
If you don't get a call back
Maybe you should consider the fact
You ain't all that, and I'm all this
Here's a small kiss, go ahead and reminisce
But this is how it is
You said the way I look it down is too real
And I need to learn how to express how  I do feel
Well, I'ma tell you how I feel in three words
Leave me alone, cause you beatin' on these nerves
Too many bitches and not enough dimes
They dont even deserve an inch of my nine
You ain't that fine, you ain't hearing me no matter how many times
(I tell you)
