Ready Ex?

[Verse 1]
She said she was sick of the city life
A sweet girl but the world made her the shitty type
When she was young she just wanted to be pretty like
A model or an actress but, she had to work for her two kids
Father in jail serving time for two bids
Kids hungry asking mama where the food is
And she can see their hearts beating through their two ribs
Now she crying watching cribs
Cause the rent's due soon, in the one bedroom
And the kids kicking mama like I need some leg room
Daddy gone, the babies might as well be test tubes
In the projects stuck, wishing they could just move
To the country, I see her time to time, trying to make a little money
That makes me realize, shit, my life ain't that crummy
So one day I asked her how she deals with it
She said she she doesn't, she lets God, so she can fly

[Hook]
Fly, reach high and go
Wish on to a star
And release your soul
Cause you know you can fly
(Fly through the friendly skies)
Reach high and go
(Get you ticket, pack your shit, and let's roll)
Wish on a star
(And don't worry I'll catch you if you fall)
Release your soul
Cause you know you can fly

[Verse 2]
He said he had a problem with commitment
And it was probably cause his pops was into pimping
As a kid he called different women Momma
So he grew up with some drama
That he could never get out of, he was 18
Already hating life, so he blazed trees
And he could ball but he ditched everyday it seems
And his grades was so bad, he never made the team
So he started slanging trees, then he moved to coke
College coaches always noticed that the kid was dope
But he smoked too much
Dropped out of school, cause shit he didn't go too much
Till one day he overdosed, sniffing coke and such
I think about him time to time, and I realize how similar our past is
But how different my path is
One day I asked his dad how he deals with it
He said he doesn't, he gets high, so he can fly

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He told me he was pressured and was stressing out
And he usually makes music just to let it out
He asked his mom about it and she told him pray to God
She didn't notice that the faith was fading from his mind
He tries to ignore the stress that he endures
Try to find some liberation but the pains is indoors
He's feelin sore since the bills start coming
His stomach started rumbling, Pops calls it growing pains
Ask his friends about it but, they don't know the pain
They just tell him roll a blunt, try to smoke some hay
So he gets high hoping it will go away
But it doesn't, shit is stuck is his head
Goes to sleep and the grief crawls up in his bed
Start tripping out thinking he should fuck with some meds
And he remembered what his grandpa said when he was young
So he looked to the sky, asking God how come?
I feel this pain time to time when I look in the mirror
And I realize, that guy's me trying to see clearer
So tell God I hear Him, and I know how to deal with it
Close my eyes till I find my spirit and just fly

[Hook]
