[Intro]
Take it as a lesson learned
And we all fall down

[Verse 1]
As we get to the end of another one
At the start of another one
It's been a year filled with more tears than any other
Much more reason to cheer than any other
So the rich liquor replace the beer we was guzzling
Had to let weed go, 'bout to let beef go
Ain't no beef with those whack MCs yo
I should be pleased with the level that I've achieved
But finding comfort under a rock's not my steezo
I reach for the stars, peaking on Mars
Cause the bars I spit gets me any place I need so
You can best believe I'm after much more respect than cheese so
Expect to see a brighter smile on the cover of my next CD
In the midst of more bliss than three chicks on ecstasy
All trying to have sex with B
Just because I'm such a fresh MC
Yeah right

[Hook 1]
Watch out for the snakes in grass
It make look green but the backs is black
If cash is the root of all evil
You can tell Satan I'm awaking my people
Don't be last (x3)

[Hook 2]
Time is of the essence
Take it as a lesson learned
It's like we lose our turn, bridges get burned
And we all fall down
Trying to climb a mountain
Better watch them steps you take
Because when the stakes get high, look to the sky
It's a long way down

[Verse 2]
I gotta make it, if not, gotta take it
Don't blame me, I was born during the reign of Ronald Reagan
Now the nation is craving crap like McDonald's
I'm saying ain't your moms ever make a proper plate home?
Carve your hunger and be patient homes
I make poems, break bones, no stones
Stopped smoking but I'm still rolling
Sunny, shouts out to Gunny on that blue eyed tip
Took a red-eye trip to Hotlanta
Stopped at JR Crickets for hot wings
Now returning making the block sing
Chicka chicka ching hit me with the (?)
To see grands, pull the MC ham sandwich
Out of that He-man lunchbox, ate him in one munch
Swallowed him whole without biting because I don't do nobody but Blu
Because nobody can touch Blu
Crush fucks up to the challenge
Somehow I managed to be granted the planet
Still standing on my own two feet when there is so much talent
Buried six feet deep beneath us
But we just rather be invalid
Jesus, where did the soul go?
Out the backdoor with the afro picks and the black fist
Now remember this

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
We all fall victim to sin through temptation
And it's so hard to turn down money when you make it
Especially when it's raising
Bitches start waving it and the whips start changing
And the chips start blinging
Funny how money keeps a smile on faces
Of everyone surrounding all the fame that you bring in
But you can't get it out your head
You was almost dead less than a year ago and no one cared
Like yeah, I remember not remembering none of y'all
Froze last December right here, in front of y'all
(?), blood pumping into that cold heart
Gold plated ego taking the soul apart
Diamond studded but didn't shine bright as the rhyming
Fuck it, this is why I'm here grinding
Cause the time will come when the shining will blind them
And the haters will arise high as those who like him

[Hook 1]
