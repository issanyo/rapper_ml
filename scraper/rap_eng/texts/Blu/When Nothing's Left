[Intro]
(That's how strong my love is)
(One, two)
(I'll be the moon, I'll be the rain)

[Verse 1:Exile]
Yo, yo, I give my all until my all's all gone
I spit the bars til the bars all gone
Free from prison now singing my song
La, la, la, la, la
Take a hit and pass it on
Like electric currents pass through computer cable
Now you got my song pass it on as I turn table
1,2 and it don’t, you thought it would, but it won’t
I stay dirty homie, pass her the soap
Clean ass beat to me, I'm real not dope
My song will be the sun when I choke
Light up the sky when I die home boy
Fuck the po, I jump on the moon to get low
Hop from star to star trying to find my folks
Sometimes I feel lost as a key, find it
Start it on, yo, pop in my CD

[Chorus]
Feel my flow, fill my soul, fill this hole up in my chest
Sing my song, when I’m gone
My heart will be here when nothing’s left
Feel my pain, kill my shame
Still I aim to be the best
Sing my song, till I’m gone
I give my all and nothing less

[Verse 2: Blu]
Check it out, I give it all in a song and live it all right or wrong
I take y'all two cents, keep moving right along
In spite of all he say, I'm right along my DJ
Cause if I wanted y'all bull I’d buy it off eBay
So keep faith or keep shut
Sideline or keep up
I write rhymes for me, fuck critics
Lick on these nuts, cause no matter how much I give
It ain’t enough
So I pick up pens, thinking who I should eat up
Now would beef but Ex said ease up
And every time he bust, I feel like I’m eat up
That’s why I speak love
Plus he got beats, what the fuck do y’all need
We as solid as a tree stump
Holling at my peeps up in heaven we gonna meet up
But first I gotta drop this verse so keep your feet up
And see what we’re going through
I give them my all, and all I’m asking from y’all
Is just a moment to feel my flow

[Chorus]
Feel my flow, fill my soul, fill this hole up in my chest
Sing my song, when I’m gone
My heart will be here when nothing’s left
Feel my pain, kill my shame
Still I aim to be the best
Sing my song, till I’m gone
I give my all and nothing less

[Verse 3: Exile, Blu]
I give it all, don’t take it all
Cause I can’t take it all
Give it to the naked all
People can’t make it tall
Short, fat, slim, shit we back in the basement dog
Making songs to uplift and folks think we breaking laws
Just because it bumps loud crack when we bang our parts
Cats can’t get it dog
Right back to business, yo
Acting like you never seen a white cat spit it raw
Man y’all acting like y’all never switched price tags in the mall
I did it plus I stole them all
Yeah I got caught and told them off
I still got a way with the Ralph Lauren polo on
And now y'all know the song from the page I wrote it on
And smoked up some trees from the same sheet I wrote it on
So roll along, sing along, pump ya fists and fight the wrong
Running shit like I jog, every day from out the fog
And yeah, we after your hearts, to exist
Pass a lifetime to this here art

[Chorus (x2)]
Feel my flow, fill my soul, fill this hole up in my chest
Sing my song, when I’m gone
My heart will be here when nothing’s left
Feel my pain, kill my shame
Still I aim to be the best
Sing my song, till I’m gone
I give my all and nothing less

[Outro]
