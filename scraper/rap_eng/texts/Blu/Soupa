[Verse 1: Blu]
Uh, wannabes
I wanna write novels, sippin’ bottles under trees
Wonder Woman with me, could she be Japanese
Wanna have lap dances for free, any time I please
Just because I’m, yeah
Just because I’m me, I wanna wonder why I dream
(?) don’t budget
Message for the hunger when I’m younger
I wanna tell (?), special they smell
Word to mother but really no wink yo
‘Cause still he can’t slumber
I wanna have his role, his crown, his girl and his sound
But get real, shit’s really real
Still wow, brick style up in the wow since a
While back then, you should slip it in now
Mo chill, now the top flow real
So bear with me, besides more bills than this automobile
I’m still blizzy for real
I still Dizzy Gillespie
But does he impress me when I’m still in the next seat?
I’m fresher than next week’s beach
Yea, feelin like the next Swizz Beats like
More like Spike Lee better Blu
Never liked none of you blues, stuntin like a one or 2
Lord’s got a woman
One or two coming through wanting something soft give em something new
But guess what, wasn’t Blu, nah
Must’ve been one of you

[Verse 2: Blu]
I wanna spit hollow tip novelists, (?) styles and raise eyebrows
Like ah I like this girl (?)
She got Reeboks, city rock, felines back when he used to jock
I’m too hot for teen eyes it was
A young one with brown eyes that dine in one day
Down to stunt, who young John the one
Who wants bars and broads? 2 more stars, I do the math
You do the knowledge of play dumb
Of course, 50 senses from south to north for the
Pretty women I am willing to endorse
Horse power, more mule in stall for the foolish
I will wake you up but you love it in that new bliss
Kiss life, even if I couldn’t
I relive it twice, grip the mic
And I ain’t even gotta speak in different life
You spit it nice but it’s mean and cold, don’t forget us, it ain’t home
You remember when you grown, I told you
Your papa ain’t scold ya
I got the heat, 6 holster
Come from California where the sunshine dies
And turns into that glow dust, no life
