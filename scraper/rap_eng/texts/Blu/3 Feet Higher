[Intro]
You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future, not a future that will be but one that might be. This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom. But like every one of the super-states that preceded it, it has one iron rule: logic is an enemy and truth is a menace. Any state, any entity, any ideology that fails to recognize the worth, the dignity, the rights of Man, that state is obsolete

[Verse]
Cheeba, a 3 feet higher rise
Took it to utopia or a Tokyo high rise
Or a Brooklyn brownstone
You heard of Bridgetown? We got them crowns on
Damn, Chris Paul misses free throws
I'm headed to the east coast, pass the tree though
We on the beach with the bitch doin' flips
Cool shit
Sunshine like Kubrick, my eyes wide
Chinese Siamese chicks
I guess we could fuck
I mean you keep stressin' me to fuck
Oh bro, i dint' know eye's high
You said wifey, I thought u said wifi
Yeah she a dime piece i see where your mind's at
But on the real, real, I need a dime sack
Let me call the homie i be right back
Ugh, rewind that
