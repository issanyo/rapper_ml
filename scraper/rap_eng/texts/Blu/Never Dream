[Hook]
Sleepwalking got you following your dreams boy
Take it from me (never, never dream)
Don't wear your heart on your sleeve boy
Tellin' me this world isn't all that it seems
You're 'bout to fall for the scheme
We all wanna be kings boy
Take it easy (never, never dream)
It ain't as easy as it seems boy
Everybody wanna lead but nobody wanna bleed

[Verse 1]
Now was it all to bling?
I used to read the Source magazine
Before I started going full-force on this rapping thing
I had a mean left but never had a battle swing
Yet I would ball up all the ballers on the traveling team
I was a bit more secure than your average teen
Too broke for prom yet the queens kept asking me to ask them
I was like: ask him!
I was thin, about five ten benching with the baddest thing in school
Sneaking sips of pops' pimp juice
Rocking Timbs and my gym shoes
But still hoopin' on niggas with the truest form swishin'
But now I think my uniform is missin'
Cause me missin' shots: rarer than a unicorn existing
I was playin' more positions than they shoot in porn pictures
I was born with it but I wasn't born for it
Still I never looked back like Forest

[Verse 2]
Yes indeed he wrote graffiti on the bus
Backseat, headphones, blown on the kush
Being something great
Told my lady "wait I gotta leave up out the States!"
Cause I ain't know who I was
Before I had a buzz, I used to shoot the shit with the crips and the bloods
Funny thing about it was I didn't know they was
Told 'em they was gods cause they didn't know they was
We just rolled hay, blowed away, playing thangs
We only taked drugs as a way to stay above
From government officials with missiles or the thugs with the pistols
Taking hate to places they forget to take they love
I was talking to my cuz just the other day
Hung up the phone, didn't tell him what I want to say
I want to say that whenever you fall astray
Stay awake and you'll always find a way

[Hook]

I mean, damn, it's like everyday's the same day
Another realisation that you ain't paid
I came to the conclusion that I can't complain
Cause if the world was a canvas I wouldn't paint pain
I've seen Jay's fame but I took Dames advice
And took the hustle route, tryna flip a couple thou
Just like a humble child listen to my uncles feed
Geeked off a couple thou they was makin' once a week
Now the truth leaks out when they discussin' me
So I had to flip it for niggas that get productive, see?
Now the business is busy as a bumblebee
Hoping niggas mumble me and soon the next Puff will be
I never asked these niggas to put trust in me
But really, who would lead you to the heavens if it wasn't me?
Huh? Plus I do it so comfortably
Doc Martin, never thought I would become a King
