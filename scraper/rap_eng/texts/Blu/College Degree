[Hook]
First day of class spaz I'm kind of late and
Second days fix raps making em sounds amazing
Hangin' with Eps Chis Alphas and Thetas
Father was a Que so you know I'm living Omega
Mama wants these A's
I promise her that I'm passin'
Get this college degree
Just hope that it's everlastin'
Further my education
Frat boy aroma
Use to live Classick
But now I want the diploma

[Verse 1]
I'm 19 sitting in a pool full of debt
You hear me Robby
Make em disappear
With music thats the hobby
Can't stand the scale of success
Cause I don't have 4.0s
And these 40s ain't helping me be the best
But yo
My mind is past the richter
Richer fix up
My habits
Grades meant more than my rapping talents
I'll make it
And prove professors
They wrong
I must confess here
I ain't taking notes
Silly jokes
Look at the verses that I wrote
And pictures that I scribbled scriptures from this pencil
Lancer
I'm cutting deep with these worded ginsus
Chill I'm getting a tissue
Making my way to Mitchell
Homework I can't stand it
Rock rims with Benjamin
Assist from Ricardo
DJ pick the roll
Can't no body stop me
I'm flushing it down the hole
Yo should probably listen to the lectures that I'm told
Let go Elementary like Froggie and the Toad
What you know?
Man I know student loans feel like many ogres
Monster
I'm mediocre
Shooting meteors at ogres
Can't wait to get degree
Fixate debris
Looking at my classmates
Hope they remember me
Sheesh
The college diet
Beer, Easy Mac, and Ramen
Terrible Huffman breakfast
Intramural and rhyming
Cool fellow in fellows
Taking naps in Knapp
Slaying her in Slayter
Rocking the Cleveland hat

[Verse 2]
Hopped out the bed 20 before the class
These test quiz my patience
C's will do complacent
Got a bag full of notebooks
Flipping the back of them
Academic unproductive musically maximum
I'm dumbfound this class is boring
Mind is sound on active touring
Peers are snoring on the Aich
Piers are near failures foreign
Volkswagen I Ford Taurus
Looking towards this class chorus
Oh I see you want attention
I'm near asleep so rigor mortis
Beauty of the outdoors
Can't make you fight the feeling
Of picnics on an open field the woman that you wheeling with
Happiness up you sleeve expression go with the breeze
Life has locked doors they open with Iano keys
Please
I can't wait for the grimace to diminish
D's stand for decent
C's an A with Cosecant
Highly anticipated like Browns a winning season
Tell them I'm gonna blow and finally they'll believe it
