[Verse 1: Blu]
Sweet passion, hope you keep lasting
Keep asking self how I receive Latin princess
As you grab interest
Club scene, dream girl
Make me wanna invest time like I do with
Rhymes that I'm smooth with
Hope you get personal like how an interview gets
Blu is nothing more but yours to commit with
Anytime you question my time, I'm convicted
Hoping that you call again
In love, we will fall again
Your hugs are like drugs
I'm addicted to your autumn winds
Blowing my mind as the souls intertwine
You're alumni and I (?)
With rhythm and Blu

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Vibrant beauty
Your flows in my direction
(?) encompassed solely by you
And I traded, expelling, releasing
My every misery, baby
Extraordinary interest multiplying within every fiber of me

[Hook: Miguel (x4)]
You, you are on my mind

[Verse 3: Miguel]
Magnificent songs from (?)
Her entire demeanor (?)
There’s no way to compare
You were a dime and a (?)
Disoriented by your voice and your smile
I’m blinded by your splendor
I’m so hypnotized
You.. you are beauty and essence

[Hook: Miguel (x4)]
