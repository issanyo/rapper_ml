The air of each individual
Body, mind, and soul exposed, spiritual
You're feeling you're alone
But something that you own
Is still here wit' you
The elephant in the room
The reflection of a first impression
The blind direction
Find your essence
An out-of-body investment
The overcoat of ego, protection
I got dressed in a blessing
I try not to flex in my perfection
In my profession, a silent confession
A divine connection
I'm flying to heaven
The higher self is more than science
A cosmic alignment
Perfect timing
The god body
And God-Goddess guide me
The Aura
