Let 'em flow
This number in your phone
Called her up
But no one was (she wasn't) home
Fuckin' up
Cause we just talked about love
We just talked about love
So what's been up?
Nothing much it seems
Same old love
You cannot proceed
Could've though
But you kept talkin' 'bout love

Holding hands
Game fiends
Making plans
Based on mood rings
Peter Pan
Dreaming never again, never...
Again and again
Again and again
And at the club
Another phone to call
Who
There all night, aw
Second love
Again and again
