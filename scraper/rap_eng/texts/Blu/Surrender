[Verse 1]
Nobody move, nobody get it?
First person move, first person felling it
So fill up your purse because my verse is about empty in
Bitch, don't try nothin' slick get silly or somethin'
Yup, and Bridgetown stealin'
Kinda like Denzel and Clive with Spike filmin'
Live in real life wihtout a digitized image
Just keep your hands higher than the fuckin' sky limit
Guys, eyes on the Benjamins
Split the pot equally divide it in the [?]
Stick to the alibi cops tryna fakin' us up
They wasn't givin' a shit
But now they givin' a
All get crunked get up or get jumped

And of course money isn't the source but get bucks
Just dunk cuz you only live one

[Hook]
I advise my contenders, to surrender
Move so the truth can enter
[?] don't juice the mixture
Come and let this liquor fuck up your liver
I advise my contenders, to surrender
Move so the truth can enter
Come and let this liquor fuck up your
Liver wit'cha boy

[Verse 2]
Picture the 23rd century, energy rap flow
Pile drive indies till the industry's back broke
Pick up bitches but my clique came back fo'
I know I said bitch but its the way you react ho
I flow back afro naps all natural
Cracks be all soft with the raps, all [?] flow
Kick back bro, I need this cash flow
So if you need crack imma bag this batch [?]
So brag bout my math but don't step in my class
As matter of fact I'm still stuck in my [?]
I might changed producers, do we think I need that though
The one I ain't ask ho
[?]
[?] nigga spittin' truth out the way
Plus you do everything that he say
Paying dues since day two
Learned it was the truth in grade one and both me a play gun
Learn how to shoot straight aimin' at Jake [?]

[Hook]
