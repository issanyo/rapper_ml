[Intro]
I runaway, I runaway

[Verse 1]
My sweet Chiquita be the fruit of my eye
Like Tetarelli at the peak of the 90s
We at the beach, she put her feet in the tide
I don't wanna be God, I'm just one of the guys
My candy apple won’t ya save me a slice
I mean the truth with ya pants
I won ya two teddybears
And got ya home before the strobe lights
Now run along won't you, there's nothing wrong with you
My baby Stacy put the blue in the vibe
She changed the mood of the town, I play the music she likes
And when you groove, it hits the room right
It keeps the fellas aroused, it keeps the ladies enticed
Wouldn't you know that I'm the only one
I wouldn't call if divine, I'm enjoying the ride
Though you're nothing but a low life
I get along with you wrong or right

[Hook x2]
I get along with you whether wrong or right

[Verse 2]
My lady Debbie got the shape of a pear
She throw the cake on my lap and told me take what I can
She separated but the breakup was bad
So every time that we smash I catch the guilt from her past
Like Sandra Bullock at the peak of the 90s
You know my speed wasn't fast, I was busting on dash
I couldn't keep up but I keep her in mind
I have to holler when my money's right
My sweetie Vicky always giving me grief
She said I love her and leave, I said I know what you mean
My tenderoni know I have to go and soften the meat
I throw a slab on the pan and watch it pop on the grease
I said I am what I am, I feel the tension increase
You say I'm just like my dad, I can't disagree
It's just the simplest things like a dog on a leash
I get along with you long as you don't bite me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Is it another one, two
Yo, what we gon' do when your dreams come true
Will you stick like glue or act brand new
Brand new being hairdo with your new air
I blew a square on the roof
Sweet and sour you, spend an hour with the truth
I let the flower choose
Yo, I couldn’t if I was you’s on your down time
Come around five, we can groove
Weekend nudes for when you're in the mood
Polo by the pool
Yo, take you to SoHo for the food
And so you're grown, now it's cool on your own like
I ain't gotta take you to school
Hold your hand, I'm your man, I can do
Yo, what you doing later on
Let's live a little bit, I'm tryna write a song
I know I'm wrong but umm
You know my arms strong my love
They go all night long, let's get it on

[Hook]

[Outro]
