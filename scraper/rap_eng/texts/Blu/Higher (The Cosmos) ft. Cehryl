[Cehryl]
I see my body in motion
So weightless I'm floatin'
I wanna go higher, higher

I see the sinister twilight
I'm at a dangerous height
But I wanna go higher, higher

There's a gravity in me
I think it wants you here with me
So we can go higher, higher

In this infinite space
I resign to my limits
I'm not going higher, higher
