[Intro: Blu]
(You gotta be you)
Man I just got his call from my girl last week and she just dumped me. [?]
(You gotta be you)
You but I'm trying to tell you what she was, she was talking all this mess about
(You gotta be you)
But I'm trying to tell you like about her like what type of attitude she got
(You gotta be you, true
And do all positive possibilities)

[Verse 1: Blu]
It's all about the ups - yea making it over humps
The jumps, making it out the slumps
The wants, the needs, waking up out your dreams like
For once I'm finna run for it, run Forrest, Gump
The lump in your throat, butterflies in your stomach
The hunger to try something triumphant
When it comes, play the hum, the modest, to pass on the pompous
The conscience telling you to be honest
The guts, the instinct, to trust what your friends think
Flush what your enemies envy if it's just
Then just be yourself - for good health and wealth
No perpetrating help, see the purpose in a snail
To set sail, tell it on the mountain - float somebody's boat
Fly a kite, write a song, take your wrong from the rights
Know your rights, know the fight isn't given to the strong but the right
Cause it's your life - so just

[Hook: Blu]
(You gotta be) You! (You gotta be) True! (You gotta be)
Do what you gotta do, prove what you gotta
To prove (You got it) That you (You got it)
Can include all positive possibilities
And be (You gotta be) You (You gotta be)
Do what you gotta do, prove what you gotta
To prove (You got it) That you (You got it)
Can include all positive possibilities

[Verse 2: Blu]
Ayo the best, yes, and not to impress
But to prove that, you can be you among the rest
Collect, respect, perfect, the test
The goals that you set, the roads you select
To be, achieve, give then receive
Don't expect to get if you ain't did nothing yet
Chicky check yourself before you wreck yourself
Redirect yourself before you disconnect yourself
Project to [sail?] and don't project to fail
Exhale, inhale the fresh
And take steps to perfection
A blessing, spiritual resurrection
The miracle you been stressing finally manifested
The present, the future, renew the past wit' a new ya
Built to last just like we knew ya
Would do, could do, should do, will do
And now after all this time, [?]

[Hook]
