Transcribing!

[Intro: Nas sample/scratches]
I leave 'em froze like heron in your nose (x5)

[Verse: Blu]
She dips
Dives with me
My life is no mystery
I travel round this world
And tell her gently
Televisioning history
Uneducated black men, (?)
They don't exist
We own this shit, no Sicily
Pardon my french
Miss me with the kiss and the crack
My mission is max bitches , business
Benjamin (?)
Flip the channel just to see if you last
For they overcast, overprice
Overlook your life from the over past
I coast a slower path
Nice and smooth
Mics and music
Fill a pool up with priceless jewels
Ice included
I could do this shit sleepin'
Do it on weekends
Do it no ink pen
Put on a (?),  I start feasting
What's your purpose in life
Is it positive, is it negative
You need a sedative, something meditative or medicinal
Show your disguise
Before they own your demise
I'm closer from high
To open the sky
Nowhere to hide
This is God's view
Riders need someone to ride to
Why choose anyone besides Blu to guide you
Look, no crook, But that stilly still still  is real
Sinning sinners lead my inner feeling ill
I can kill so they gave me a mic
I eat your skills, no price
Throw your dice, ya life
Is on the grill
We hungry, we throw money
No dummy, I could have crashed
In a comfy (?) interior
Decorated by facts
What's the difference between living and  living the dream
When you're living the dream
Your living room is on a screen
I invited a billion listeners to witness my steam
You hot air
Turn off the heat, you not there
Turn on the beat, we right there
Nike airs dipping on (?)
With the flash
Nobody care if we the illest team, nigga
Blu, Young Chemist, Cashus King, nigga

[Outro]
I leave 'em froze like heron in your nose (x5)
