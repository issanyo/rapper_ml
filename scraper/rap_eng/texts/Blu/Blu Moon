[Intro: Blu]
Yeah, yeah turn my mic up
One more time, G
We got 'em, check it uh

[Verse: Blu]
And my truck be lifted up
Bitches with insurance whip
Niggas with benefits [?]
Chilly on the chill
We got a license to ill this month
Bills is paid, billin' the boss, Benjamin days
Have 'em feeling they shades
King of the lost, bling bling
And never seen defrost and
We can meet back at the top of the hour
Putting power back on the block
Without powder, put back on the clock
Drop product at the  spot
Notts tower
Like the Watts tower back up in Watts
Watching over you
My time is overdue like a Thomas Edison light bulb
Flashed over my noggin as
I was struck by lightning while writing my rhymes and skylines
Giving the world a double view on my life
Like sunshine reflects the ocean reflects, blue
My crew invited titans to the third rock to burn spot
And hope this time they can teach humans to fly
We got the scope on you, don't flop
The stove top is hot after you hop out the jeep
Go cop that new Blu and Nottz
We rocking posse's to sleep
ABC, XY and Z
This jam is D-E-F, you think you G but you not
