[Verse 1]
Uh
The light-skin with the nice trim
400 spokes riding the stroll by the white folks
The rare bones get the bare Jones
If it's the caddy, it's gotta be Western, when he head home
Young Burgundy with the purple leaf
Purposely serve the streets
Murk the beat, when the verse complete
Turkish leaves, when I work for cheap
Burn my AC up, foreign chick, forgot who Jay Z was
Ladies love him like he cool James
Big body, when I role through the hood, I use 2 lanes
Showed her a few things, before we do things
Cause there's is rules to the game, where Blu hangs
Yup, shoe strings for the 50z

[Hook](4x)
The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z
Crush!

[Verse 2]
Uh the high yella, with the acapella
She say it ain't about the cheese
It's the way we chop the mozzarella
Old school with the gold juice, the gold tooth
I never had, the rope and the bowl shoes
No love for the home of thugs
Cause it ain't a what she do
It's the shit you tell her don't do
Be L, get the females
The models kiss the nozzle of my 4-0 bottle
They call me lucky like a silver dollar
Silver collar poppin, 'til I'm pealing piles with my partners
The veals hopping
Young Slausen, with the chill flossing
Where the soldiers be bossin'
Cause we don't listen to the drill sergeants
Marching through the 50z

[Hook](4x)

[Verse 3]
Yup, the Philly cap with the Philly rap
Blow the biddy, through the diddy, through the city 'til they give me that
Young royal, got the ones for you
At the titty bar, trying to make stars out these silly broads
Lexus' for exes, the Escalades for escapades
L.A. is the set we aim
I got the pass from the Mexicans
Just so I could flag through the Aves, for them green bag blessings
You could see the whole city from the hilltops
Take 'em down to the coast to get your wheels washed
And we still bang parliament
Hit the store by the park, when I'm parched for them parliaments
Park the Benz off Arlington
Spark the flint, right before I told her what part we in
Pardon me, we in the

[Hook](4x)
