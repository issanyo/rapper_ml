I look so much prettier in photos
When the flash is bright
And I've had time to fake a smile
I'm so much more fun 'round people I
Don't know
Especially at night
When I wear my best disguise

Don't
Don't you ever get too close
Look me in the eye
You'll turn to stone
I used to be the sweetest girl
Lost
Swaying in a cloud of smoke
Loving all the ones that treat me worst
But you won't

If I can hurt me like this
I can hurt you too
If I can hurt me like this
I can hurt you too
Don't let me love you
Don't let me love you

Living with the lowest expectations
Take it on the chin
That's just the way it is
Cause everybody's failing at relationships
Who are we to think that we're any different
We could try pretend
But oh

Don't
Don't you ever get too close
I will never have to let you go
If I never have you at all
Lost
Swaying in a cloud of smoke
Loving all the ones that treat me worst
Oh, but you won't
You won't, no

But if I can hurt me like this
I can hurt you too
If I can hurt me like this
I can hurt you too
Don't let me love you
Don't let me love you
