[Skit]

[Verse 1: Blu]
Hello, mellow
I know it's hard to love an ordinary fellow
Especially if you're yellow but we gel like jello
Bass and treble, bow for a cello
Turn it up a level, come and dance with this delicate devil
Got hoes in a shovel but, yo, I'd rather settle with this
Hot kettle pothead from the heaven-
Scent, smell like an angel even when I'm hella bent off of that
Brown liquo-liquor
Style killer, been a while since I lived with her
Sore loser for sure, it's all yours but the child wasn't mine
I bet one out of nine to a dime, six months
I tried to step but, umm..
