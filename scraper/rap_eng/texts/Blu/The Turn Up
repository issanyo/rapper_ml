[Chorus: Blu]
Soon as my niggas say turn it up
We burn it up, burn 'em down
Madlib brought the burner out

[Verse 1: Blu]
Eighty shots, twin Glocks, my pen pops
And Faith is still the hardest shit since MC Ren
My kinfolk keep his window locked
My other kin is trying to kick his window in
Bad neighbors, the homies they the misbehaviors
So you know the flow won't go major unless they throwing paper
From out of corporate skyscraper and
That's when we kick the Industry doors in, Blu and MED
Neo took the red and blue to the head and still can't go to bed
Wildchild, Code Red, as big as when Jaylib broke the red
We broke the bank, it awoke the feds
Fold the bread, sleep with your eyes wide up
And turn it up when you drive by us

[Chorus: Blu]
Turn it up
We burn it up, burn 'em down
Madlib brought the burner out

[Verse 2: Oh No]
9-3-0-33
I stay a mile above the echelon
I put Heckle and Jeckle on
Your 15 minutes of fame is down to a second, go on
I see you in it boy, so what you steppin' on?
You niggas rep it wrong
You in that shit like I'm checking forums
I'm a Disrupticon 'cause I just swept the con claiming Decepticons
Only deceiving when the weapons drawn, that's a Megatron
I'm dropping a mega atomic bomb and swim with megalodons
I got a pool like I mangled your arms
You just a ragdoll, or rather test dummy ready to crash walls
That means that you ain't got the drive we do
Matter of fact, I would never ride with you
Keanu Reeves couldn't save you on a bus
Play it loud when you speed by us, motherfucks

[Chorus: Blu]
Turn it up
We burn it up, burn 'em down
Madlib brought the burner out

[Verse 3: MED]
It's that head knock turned into the red dot
Watch the hottest, latest gossip from the block to the near shop
[?] on my hip I'm a walking investment
That checkered to your chess, you as dumb as the next man
Dropped out of school, I ain't nothing for testing, homie
Your wave turned to tide then you dirt for sure
Moral of the story, I'm a hoarder for the glory
Henny to the rim when it's straight from the trophies
Toast coast where the sun sets
That's women looking like money in the corset
Suckers looking kinda envy gotta shake 'em off
When you prayed they wrote me off, they wrote more checks
Oh No, B-L-U, my crew, war prepped
Just a step, turn it up, make the whip wreck

[Chorus: Blu]
Turn it up
We burn it up, burn 'em down
Madlib brought the burner out
