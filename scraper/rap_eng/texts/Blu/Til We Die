[Verse 1]
Laugh now, cry never
Never mind, nice guys finish fine, I guess
Forever fly
Used to be fresh but now I'm wise
Guy's, try to imply
Like I should optimize on lies and cries
I find it harder now to author nouns and sounds
It's like couldn't believe I was really bout to father a child
*When all of this foul
*World girls are brought up in now
All the options
Cloggin and crowdin'
Little Knoggins'
With products instead a knowledge
Unbalanced
And it bothers nobody cause she fine as hell
So she whine's/wine's
And dines
And tells, more lies
Trynna find herself
Fell on ma knees today to find myself
And it helps when It ain't no one around to tell the truth to
When I'm not have the guy/God I use to be
Use too
Who be?
Used to say
You the truth too
Now I'm just Truthful
Truthfully it hurts
Usually worse
Used to be worse
Running from comfort
Cause I wouldn't conform, or convert
Now I just converse
About how much love hurts
And how good God is
And how much I want more for ma kids
Cause life is not fair
But it does not stop there
Do what you got til you drop
But don't trip, my dear
It's God's here
Right here

[Verse 2]
Whatever you be on is you nigga
Remember, whatever I be on the good God got me on
I try to lone through the winter
Jottin' home in poems
Tryna remember the warmth when the storms pass
Blue skies
Sunshine ma minds forecast
Not like I was born last week
Complete ma format
My perspective gets deep
My lessons have been collectin' like Blessings
The exchange rate is beautiful too
Proving that truth can override anything but love
So God Bless you
A timeless
Life a
Stressin' this fight with lust
I try to put my life love up above you but
God
Mom
Music
Movies
Movin' the world with a duty to truly be something worthy of
Lavish ass pad's
With cars
And all types a devices
Must be nice if happiness is priceless
Right
Price my life
And y'all can have the Range bright lights and fame
For some change, give an exchange if your souls intact
And it's hard to beat that with a bat
Most cats get wit this
It's '08 jack
I stick wit that
Boom bap mind state
'96 mind flip, get money
Other than that
We praise God
Sometimes I play y'all
Never did play cards or
Video games
I was eight tryna navigate principle aim
Multiplyin' ma visual game
By ma spiritual gain
Divided truth by pain
Still steerin' the plane
Like the pilots do it
Sun shine
And in the sky is Blu
So high
Wave hi we just ridin' through
No titles, No idols, No pride
No time to prove to you why we fly we just do US
And we trust that you do you
That's what we was brought up to do
