[Verse 1: Blu]
Hot dang, get out the lane, I came to do my thang
Busting the cut and just letting my nuts hang
Remember my name before I enter your frame
Y'all niggas get in the game like y'all bang
But can't hang like the nigga that feels like hell breezy
Flipping these shows is so easy
To get in the time when I'm spitting the (?)
When I'm spitting a line
My DJ keep these things deep in these crates
Mainframe banging the beats in each state
Cheap skates selling they souls on eBay
While I'm deep up in the city like (?)
World (wide)
Put your hand sin  the sky
Burn a motherfucker down with the (?) sound
Drowning in the mainstream, I'm between the underground
Got these mutherfuckers ducking when I spit rounds
James Brown slang, little man get down
Been all around the world doing shows and one thing I know
But ain't no place like home
Yeah, we up in the place
With a shorty and a .45 in
DJ bumping the bass
With a hand in the air, bumping Tribe Check The Rhyme
And there's nothing to say, I'm on point J
All the time y'all
Never kick a line off
Beat hold, heat hold
No B-L-U no E even if I don't breathe
Watch out, proceed and continue to venue
When I'm taking out the temple
And I rape the instrumental
When The Roots you (?)
Or Ninjutsu
When Blu hits you, you will honk
Bitches in the place get the fuck up off the wall
Tell the DJ that be playing your song
I bang bang boogie, I be fucking up the pussy
When I hit it in her hoodie till the break of the dawn
Wake up in the morning till I (?) and yawn
Get the newspaper off my lawn like extra extra, read all about it
Hot shit fucking you up, bruh so watch it (x4)
