[Verse 1]
Ayo, chillin' with more lines than an African herd of zebras
Is when I realized I was the fastest on the re-up
Faster than a 9 mm spinning heaters
Faster than the speed of light travelling out your speakers
And nobody faster than me bruh
Still be faster than you when I kick my feet up (cheetah)
'Cause you know that black and gold look cold
Colder than snowfall when dough fall on the road
But you know the stakes is high in the streets bruh
She don't trip if I pass you the weed bruh
'Cause I just might pass you the heater
When you gettin' cash with a cheetah

[Verse 2]
Gettin' paper wishin' we was in the caper
Still she think I'm Superman 'cause she think I'ma save her
Shakin' haters in my brand new two-seater
We in the streets, bruh, tell your girl roll that weed up
Producing [?] your feet up
'Cause we be in the street like green lights but lightin' green up
So don't be gettin' mad when you see her
Out here gettin' cash with a cheetah (with a cheetah)

[Verse 3]
Faster than a bullet hit a Black Panther leader (pow)
As fast as you can get gaffled  at the Dorothy High bleachers
I told pops I was in the library
But I was in N.Y. gettin' high with the seniors
Cooler than every guy ever since junior high
I never went to high school 'cause I be in school high
And it don't matter when your pockets gettin' fatter
Ditchin' school, making tapes, come back and slang 'em after
That's how the game go, niggas ain't on a payroll
Bitches get what they paid for, what I gotta make grades for
I told the principal don't be mad when he see us
Gettin' more cash than the teachers (cheetah)
