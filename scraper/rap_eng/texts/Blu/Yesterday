[Verse 1: Blu]
Damn, hold up, yeah
Forgive me, I used God's name in vain
Had her sayin' it when she came, shame on me
Spoke thunder as the lightning struck rain on me
Chilling with the same homies that never prayed for me
Stole from me, shoulda' stole on 'em, shit
Still chill with 'em 'cause this world's cold on 'em
Why should I be? I was told forgive and don't
Forget, but high as I be, in the club toastin'
Cups with some [?] right beside me
Who gives a fuck, times is rough, don't remind me
Be godly, 'aight, folks walk over you
Like a rug when you're nice, that's why I had to be
Mean on this mic, bad tongue since mad young
Should I tell 'em that I never really had a gun
Or a son, or free lunch, or
Funds, left school dumb to have fun
Been on the run since then, Sin City
Where the city sins, repents, and sins again
Many men after many money, and I say
Many many, yeah, many many many
How many sins do we bend on a daily
Enough to make a nigga go (crazy) yup
Used to be the one screamin' 'pay me', now I'm screamin'
'Save me'...yup

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
Was there ever a time
When history was kind
When justice was just blind
When yesterday was fine
Was there ever a time
When history was kind
When justice was just blind
When yesterday was fine

[Verse 2: Aloe Blacc]
You ever seen how little kids play? Ever
Dare someone to reveal their skeletons one day?
But then their memory is fuzzy gray, you ever
Wonder 'bout the secrets that someone didn't say
As a man you walk a fine line in your mind
One side is love, the other side is blind
Catch a good bird but still keep a flock of dimes
Then the preacher go and teach us to forget our crimes
But my neighbor doesn't go to church, he sips wine
On my porch, put a torch to a square and pass
Time, I guess that's fine, to each his own
Vice, and everybody has his own price, that's
When you gotta learn to choose your own fight
Stand and deliver or make those green lights, in
America, where the motto is better is better, where
Never is the answer but they never say never
They only say soon but soon don't ever show up
The poor stay sufferin', the ghetto stay tore up
The money gets divided like the fat cousin servin' up the
Cake and his excuse is he made a mistake, well
The problem is old, the solution is new, all the
Corporates are gone and the number is few, of
Who can fix the ailing system, we
Heard the symptoms, we failed to listen

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
Was there ever a time
When history was kind
When justice was just blind
When yesterday was fine
Was there ever a time
When history was kind
When justice was just blind
When yesterday was fine
