[Verse 1]
Hit you with the flow of potential, I'm Killing ya
That's Zigg Zagg to the front and center
Clips/mags to the bitch that wanna sip on that shit let the hollow tip rip bitches to bits
Scrape up the motherfucker that don't want to run with this shit
Look at the talented and while I'm chasing the streets, don't run with the gang
Break you off homie, Bust up faces for the sake of this name
From back in the day
Hit you with the Strafe like it's a straight flippin off with the mouthpiece
And big boys talking about that time they got paid
Three bitches; most of us think we need bitches too
I'm running the game solo with the icepick next we be coming for you
Midnight
Speak that Venom, we speak that Venom so we roll through
Hit you with that flow that'll put you on stickmode, why because of the deuce deuce
Listen up when I tell you "Bitch Don't come at me Sideways"
We run looking at the Grand L'Arsenic (with full clips without a axe?)
Slipping up talking shit about me, Imma come stick one off in your ass
Make bitches know break a bitch off in broad daylight for that cash
Break you off homie, Bust up faces for the sake of this name (X2)

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up with the venom when I get up in 'em, I bend 'em and send 'em, I bend 'em (x4)
On the wall I saw (Venom x4)
In my dreams I saw (Venom x4)

[Verse 3]
Mind hella gone, I'm in the zone, stay blown cause it's drastic
I'm sacked for the elastic cats get laid out in caskets
Creep up on me like Freddy is deadly
You better be ready or probably to get the fetti They knowing exactly how it's going
I'm no joke like Bo Loke come on thats all she wrote
Willing to do what it takes to get it You know I'm with it, count every digit
How about that? Make the semi clap, crack to really back, Imma show you how they react
Dreaming but never sleeping
But seeking to see the reason
Don't play even busting cleaning
I'm on a mission to get it
Why they wish I been to did it
Snap back to reality no formalities call me queen like (??) Young Dro plus I'm just a one-pro here I come though
End of the snapper
Wake you up like (?) coffee
To the haters: Back up off me
You know I'm way deep in the scene
They don't wonder why I'm the West Coast Queen (Yeah)

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up with the venom when I get up in 'em, I bend 'em and send 'em, I bend 'em (x4)
On the wall I saw (Venom x4)
