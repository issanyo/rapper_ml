* first single

[Jibbs]
It's Jibbs ladies and gentlemen

[Chorus: Lloyd]
DJ give us somethin to ride to
My shawty's on her way home from work soon
And I'ma do it like we did it in high school
And send my dedication on my favorite station
Girl only you

Ay DJ, ay DJ, ay DJ (play that song for her)
Ay DJ, ay DJ, ay DJ (play that song for her)
Ay DJ, ay DJ, ay DJ (play that song for her)
DJ play that song for her

[Jibbs]
Now let me take us back to high school
She better then the food in the lunch room
Used to walk home nothin to ride to
No car but I heard the radio playin my favorite song for you?
Dedicate this song to you boo
Now that I think back girl you know what's funny
How we used to pass notes and now I be passin money
And I know that yall fake cuz baby you are the truth
So turn your speakers up this next ones for you

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
It ain't nothin like the old days
Listening to them old days
Then when you role play while you listening to O'Jays
I remember that night in prom
When they played our favorite song
In the back of my jeep first time
You told me you wanted to bone bone bone
Foggin up the windows writtin my name in it
Now the days passed it ain't the same is it
Do you remember that yeah I remember too
So turn your speakers up this next ones for you

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Baby I'm goin on my favorite radio station
Told them I dedicate this song to you
So I can make you feel like you felt in high school
Give you a lil somethin to ride too

Give give you a lil somethin
Give give you a lil somethin
Give give you a lil somethin to ride too (x2)

DJ play it

[Chorus]
