[David Banner]
In the rich corner, heh heh heh
Hailin from Southside St. Louis
The youngest phenomenal feat of all time... Jibbs!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The cars is plush (yeah boii)
Ain't you that bankhead with that big boy truck (yeah boii)
Ain't you that one with money stacked to the ceilin (yeah boii)
And it's a problem when the big kid Jibbs is in the buildin!

[Jibbs]
Yeah, I stay fresh I stay flyer than the rest
Cause when a didn't have much the haters loved to talk mess
But betta yet, I stay flyer than a plane, than a bird
Park my truck on 32's and got it lookin like it ain't a curb
I mean my words, go back-a-wards to that limit
Then I got the girls, goin crazy for the boy
Cause I have no flaws/flurrs, and all the guys say I'm stingy
Because I cannot shurr, I run my city like Diddy
So you can call me Mur', run down you didn't see me comin
You can hear me 'fore you see me cause my Lamborghini hunmin
Got the Hummer behind me and the beats just bumpin
Bangin the concrete, it got'cha A-Town stompin
Aiyyo I represent the South, S-T-L-O-U-I-S man
Where they love to rock them fitted caps and them headbands
My Louis girrls dressed in all white like it's a weddin
And Pookie-Man standin right by my side in black like he the best man

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
I got that S-550 wit that panoramic top
And my different color rims keep spinnin when I stop
Yeah the Kid so flashy just to be my age
But girl don't mind me cause it's just my ways (yeah~!)
What a wonderful day, I'm so icy
And all the other cats wanna be just like me
And that's for the fact that all the girls like me
Lil' mama calm down cause you're gettin a lil' feisty
I got different color cars with my big big bling
With reflections off the wall that make you think you're seein things
And the trunk just thunderin, got everybody rumblin
The truck sittin so high that you could see up under it

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Yeah it's young Jibbs (yeah boii)
And yes I'm curious man I got a question (yeah boii)
Ain't you that big big Kid that all the girls lovin (yeah boii), cause you f'real
When you say diamonds just a button and money ain't nothin
Gettin stacks by the dozen (yeah boii)
Is it true you murderin tracks without cussin (yeah boii)
Everywhere the kid goin it start ruckus (yeah boii)
I heard you somethin like the kid Jay and Puffy, ridin Phantoms is nothin
Ain't that lifestyle lovely? (yeah boii)
Ain't it true that your chain do exotic things (yeah boii)
Colorful diamonds and it flip fo' different ways (yeah boii)
Man Jibbs, you know you gettin paid
And plus I heard that you said that the

[Chorus] - second repeat sans instrumental
