[Jibbs]
Yeah...
Okay whassup y'all?
This is one of those dancin songs

[Chorus: Jibbs]
We ride big big cars, and big big rims
And we rock big clothes, with them big thick Timbs
Got big cribs, cause we got big grip
I'm a real big kid, cause we do it real big

[Jibbs]
Flow so hot; VVS diamonds in my big big watch
You know I got it on lock
Keep a chick on my arm more than a watch
She start lookin at my finger maybe cause of the rocks
And now the G's on the block shocked like the watch
It's like a car show when I open up my garage
Vipers Maseratis Lamborghini drop-tops
Cutty cutty hydraulics once we drop it like it's, like it's hot
One take, matter fact y'all all are fakes
So therefore I'll make your head alternate
Cause while you stabbin I'm jabbin, you get to rappin and actin
And try to make it a habit, but Trix ain't for silly rabbits
Flawless style that make you shake
Girls "Cry Me a River" like Timberlake
That's like music that's trapped in, a stereo wrapped in
A gift that you wrapped and so you ain't hearin jack then

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Pull up in a whip, they want to see
The T-I-P of my dip, think I better get a grip
My money like the Olympics, I gotta make it flip
And never really can fall in but gotta take the trip
I'm livin on "Cribs" while you dreamin in your criiiib
So all you big babies can keep on your bibs
Stayin on tour while my album gettin shipped
Tryin to get FOUR picks - plain, bus, car, ships~!
So give it break, and still call Jibbs the great
You need to chill wit'cha grill sayin Jibbs a fake
Cause while you be grillin, your boy Jibbs be chillin
I'm trying to make me some millions put chandeliers in the ceilin
Do it big, tryin to get mo' on my plate
While you goin half crazy I put half on a lake
So 16's I spit, for sixteen you get
By sixteen I'm livin like sixteen was millions

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Doin big thangs, rock big clothes
With them big big chains and we fly big planes
'Copter so fly so we flyin through the rain
Young Jibbs switchin lanes while you dudes bein lame
So who you know that is hot and can flow like this
Ride in the back of the Range and rove like this
Stay iced out let it show like this
I bet you ain't got a chorus that'll go like this

[Chorus]
