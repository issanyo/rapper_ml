Comin up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit

Comin up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit

What you gon' do?
You gon' ride?
You gon' roll?
You gon' stretch?
You gon' fold?
You gon' keep yo family po?

Comin up in da hood watchin my homies take the pressure
That's why I chose to be a mic-checka
What you gon' do?
You gon' ball?
You gon' fall?
Let 'em knock you into walls?
Leave you dead in a hall
Or you gon' keep hanging in the streets with your crew
Don't ask me cuz I know what I'm a do

But what you gon' do?
Buy the solos with the dodo's and nogo's and fofo's
In choke holds after getting chased by the po po's
You gon' ride solo or is you gon' group it?
Or is you gon' think before you start being stupid

Now what chu gon' do?
You gon' rob?
You gon' kill?
Buy the drugs or you gon' deal
Or go out and chase a mil
Or on the other hand get a deal like me
And go and write 48 bars to a beat

Tell me what you gon' do?
Be another family failure
Disrespectin all your elders
Go livin in a shelter
Or you gon' get killed put in jail or be a doctor
And own a big house on the roof a helicopter

Whatchu gon' do?
Stay in the same city, same hood, same block
Same homies changing clothes, wearin eachothers socks
Or do you wanna go somewhere
A life to try to live
And see about a hundred
Making money, taking trips

What you gon' do?
Be a fed, be a star, do the dance, hit the bar
Be a face nigga - sharp
Or go and shop and stuff
Hit the mall, pop tags
Start stuff
Get me red, white and blue like the flag

Jibbs what you gon' do?
Gettin money, stay off the streets
They frontin man - it ain't funny, I ain't runnin
Hopin from place to place like a bunny kinda sunny
Phone on my waist vibrate cuz it's comin
Stay in shape
Last in the game is music business
Funny

For the sake that my hood cats hungry
Tryin to get a mil deal, bread and bologna
For the sake that my hood cats that are hungry
Tryin to get a mil deal, bread and bologna

Comin up in da hood!
