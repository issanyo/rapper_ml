[Hook:Meister-J & Magic]
I'd always try to lose em' when I just got em'
Cause I fall for the wrong, guess I got a problem [x3]
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem
Stop tripping', do the math, maybe you could solve it

[Verse 1: Versice Barnes]
7:30, back before her curfew
The first rules broken, then her brothers hurt you
They encourage you with words, force you to oblige
And that circle in your Wallet better be there all night
Her parent 10% African, at a mass and a fellowship
Let her practice for medicine, and she be checking the testaments
And by test, I meant she checks 'fore she ever lets you in
And her preference depends on whether you're a gentleman
Rather
Carnes Asada
Glass of kulana
Than ever eat with your mama or sip a pint of the lager
She the dream type
Known to a brother as "Ms right"
But at this day and age it's best to stop and think twice
Flirt with the flower, save the nectar for the ending
So I'd think about it for a second
And before I eat a kitkat first sniff the wrapper
Handle all the riffraffs like it don't matter
BEAST

[Verse 2:Magic]

Hol' up, yeah you know we on
Black skinnies and I got my slippers on
Walking through the shadows, yeah I got my fingers crossed
Conversations with mirror, I'm the fairest of them all
Like "mirror, mirror", my competition, ain't never ever been another nigga come between us
No bitches either, or hatin' niggas, or ass niggas, shit, the sound of my voice is enough to make them wither
Cockiness? Something like confidence
I'm the owner of the share, yeah I got the divided
Got your girl in my mouth, I can taste the evidence
Got the medicine in hand, trying to cure my ignorance
So the remedies intact, ain't you fucking generous?
Well you must be supermad thinking you can fuck with us (huh)
Circle of broads, something I need when I'm bored
Should be in a course, like sleeping with better whores, I'm BEAST

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jibbz]

I'm on a "Loo V"
And the other V
You know the ones niggas be claiming they getting G
See I'm a pro, watch and learn, semi-Gs
But you probably not gonna learn cause it's in the genes
Swag, dope on fire, it's simmering
Got y'all niggas blind cause I'm shimmering
When you were with you girl, she was seeing me
I never made a move, then she started leaning in
I could be a cheesy nigga, sweet-talk you
And say shit like "I love to cuddle"
See
There is a risk in that
That could make me be a friend and not a dick in that
Ass
I got a problem, bitch can you slove em' please
I ain't gonna spill if you keep it clean
To something that would make us have kids
I'mma give you that "D" cause you know I'm BEAST
