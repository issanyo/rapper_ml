[Intro: Yung Joc]
Aight, public service announcement
If your chain hang low, then you a certified stunna
A certified boss
Yung Joc, Jibbs
Drop that hook, let's go

[Verbal: Child]
Beasta!

[Hook: Children harmonizing]
Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the floor?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you through it over your shoulder
If ya hot, it make ya cold?
Do yo chain hang low?

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
If the chain don't hang low, hot, it ain't lying
You can call it MJ 'cause it got hang time
Fruity Pebbles around my neck, yeah, blue and yellpw dimes
Like I robbed Roger Rabbit for these carrots, I ain't lying
Gucci linking, got them blinking V-S ones twinkle twinking
Draped up, dripped out hoes see it, flip out
What they call a chunk of change? People, too, I'm chalked full of cain
There's no need to ask who I be, at the end of my chain that's my name

[Hook: Children harmonizing]
Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the floor?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you through it over your shoulder
If ya hot, it make ya cold?
Do yo chain hang low?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Look, I'm the shit
I should walk around with pampers on me
Caked up, as you walk around with candles on me
Plazma screen ear rings, no channels on em
Them niggas hitting like nails with hammers on 'em
And my bitches always acting like the cameras on 'em
Ice grill hundred thousand dollar gramma on 'em
And if you plavin we're gonna put pajamas on 'em
'cause I will put 'em to sleep nyquil
I feel.........
My chain tough I know push
Through up a leva
I know its hard
I know I'm raw
I'm well respected, like a bear claw
Them diamonds clear, like Smirnoff
Them diamonds big, like than deirdoff
Sure I'm a weirdo, but got a lot of gwap
My jurys nsync, see how they came through

[Verse 3: Jibbs]
Sitting on them things, that's
Higher then my age
And a big kid gonna do mo numbers then yellow pages
Yeah I spit the heat
So I can go on and get your chest warm
'cause the kid's been stacking green longer then grass for 'em
My whole stroke is mean
So by the time I'm 18
I'm flowing sicker then a Muslim who ate poke ad bean
And I got 2 floor
So that means it's double plush
My chain hang low then a rope that's made for double dutch
Youngaz in the gang
Stick its chain
Then I'm ripping things
The charm just flipping things
My neck could hardly lift the thing
Most expensive chain
And still got change look at jock and Wayne
Rich in mind
Man I'm hot
Diamond key with a platinum lock!
