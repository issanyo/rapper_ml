Aye yo, this another Big Big Kid exclusive right here baby (Yeah)
Beatstaz Music (Okay)
We gon' slow it down for the ladies right here

All you gotta do is just.. wait awhile
(Le-Le-Le-Let's go)
Le-Le-Le-Let's go

Beatstaz!

Let's wait awhile - Before it's too late
(Wait a minute girl, wait awhile for me)
Let's wait awhile - Our love will be great
(Wait a minute girl, wait awhile for me)
Let's wait awhile - Before we go too far
(Wait a minute girl.. I'll never stay away)

[Jibbs]
We can slow it down, wait around for a minute
And pick this thing back up so we can get wit' it
You know I'm feelin' you girl but I'm just sensin'
That you wanna get wit' me
In the air, I'm feelin' tension
We can hit the mall sometimes, throw me them digits
So we can floss a little, ride wit' me in my Bentley
Coorodinatin' clothes, True Religion - True Religion
Then hit up the Hamptons, and spend a day in Venice
But we can do this all just as soon as I finish
I know you don't like this but girl, this is the business
As soon as I get some time, then we can start chillin'
But right now the boy is on a mission for a million, so

It's crazy all the things she do to try to get wit' me
Always tryin' to get me, say she flyin' to my city
She doin' anything just to get my attention
But I got a lot to do girl, just wait until I'm finished
When I can't answer, she be blowin' up my phone
Tryin' to hang wit' my sister er'ytime I'm gone
(Er'ytime you gone?) Yeah, er'ytime I'm gone
Tryin' to get next to the people in my home
And I ain't tryin' to brush you off, I'm tryin' to paint the picture
But at the same time, you know I wanna get wit' ya
You gotta understand me, girl, I'm tryin' to get this paper
So if you understand me then, do me this favor and
