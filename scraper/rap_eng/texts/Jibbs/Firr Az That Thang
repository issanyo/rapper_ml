[repeat 7X]
Fire as that thang

[Jibbs - speaking over repeat]
Fire as that thang
Y'know, far as that thang

[Verse One]
I'm the big big kid, I'm doin big thangs
And ain't what you call big headed but I got a big brain
My lifestyle changed and when I got a little change
Not the attitude but gratitude to this game
You ain't seen nothin blingin until you've seen my chain
Cause the young'n be ballin harder than NBA
I get twist like caps but when I disappear my face
Everybody snappin photos tryin to get in my face
Cause I'm sorta like a loco, I'm on top of my game
And the way I spit on records, fire as a flame
So you know I keep a chick that's fire as that thang (fire as that thang)
I got a iced-out grill and a iced-out watch
With them Nike checks on - my shoes and socks
And my ear is like an alley cause it's full of rocks
I'm a key to the game and I got it on lock

[Chorus: repeat 2X
Fire as that thang (you know I'm fire as that thang)
Fire as that thang (you know she fire as that thang)
Fire as that thang (what's that thang, what's that thang boy)
Fire as that thang (what's that thang, what's that thang boy)

[Verse Two]
(Fire as that thang) See this my year, I'm 'bout to start a new thang
Fo' bottom, white gold with the iced-out fangs
Make that Hemme holla, charger almost sound like a train
Cruisin to the hood on the highway and we switchin lanes
I stay fresh, I stay fly in the best clothes
Rock the best bows, outfits get set low
A funny guy I'm all the girls' heartthrob
Smart never rock a square's pants like Spongebob
I'm sick with the flow, cause I'm the hottest
Get to my do' and I ain't speakin when they knockin
It's just about my time to shine so don't get'cha eyes
Where that time is, cause my shine'll blind
(Young Jibbs~!) I got u'rybody movin this year
Cause I own two planets the sun and moon in my urr
Half yellow, half white, and it ain't no game
Cause your boy Jibbs is...

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
(Fire as that thang)
She saw the bottom of my grill and said I was "fire as that thang!"
She said she pictured me as bein "fire as that thang!"
Told her to come and call her friends that's "fire as that thang!"
Can't be no less than a ten, she "fire as that thang!"
Your boy done rockin the Lexus "fire as that thang!"
Princess cuts and VVS's "fire as that thang!"
And all them trunks on the man "fire as that thang!"
I don't care what y'all sayin, she

[Chorus]

Fire as that thang...
