Beaster

If you hear before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong

If you hear before you see me
If you hear before you see me
If you hear before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk

King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

Aiyyo this beat is bananas
A King Kong you can put ‘em in the trunk of the McClaren
So when I do it up they fall off, fall off
When they look at my ride, you see the doors is fall off

And the wheels look flat, trunk so heavy in the back
Got the speakers in the front and they be sitting on my lap
Got the bumpers to the flo' 'cause the trunk weighing it down
Look they think it’s a low-rider when they come from my town

And that’s a King Kong, in the trunk, that’s the gorillas behind me
When I’m rolling through your hood anybody can find me
You can hear me from the next block when I’m on the next block
When I’m headed to the next block, got you jumping to the next block

King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong

If you hear before you see me
If you hear before you see me
If you hear before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk

King Kong, King, King, King, Kong King
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

Lil’ Momma got you stopping and dropping when a man stop bopping
So I told her she ain’t talking about nothing and she just fronting
You can hear me from a block and you already know what’s up
With the women 'cause they feeling how it rumble in my trunk

I got 20 speakers up in my trunk and I turned it up
And all the ladies loving how it be bumping they can hear me comin'
You can hear before you see me, I got beats up in my trunk
All the ladies want to chase me when they hear my system bump

Say Jibbs I’m about to head out to the Bruin
Holla at you about fedy, hit my celly soon as you ready
Split this cheese like a deli

They thought I was a lunatic when I pulled up to the telly
I had that candy coated Chevy, showing it’s grill like it’s Nelly
And the ladies love me, why is that?
They love the way I be getting my lean on

Get the diamond and my multi colored diamond bling on
That King Kong, yeah, I bet ya this gon’ be the theme song
'Cause that King Kong will have your ears ringing like a ring tone

King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong

If you hear before you see me
If you hear before you see me
If you hear before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk

King Kong, King, King, King, Kong King
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

Gyeah, them bitches knockin’, I got it on lock
'Cause I make hits like I’m boxing
Start it up and it sound like a block hit it
Then a hater, hating inside like don’t pop with this

See the beats is beat, ya hear me before you see me
Before you even can reach me, it’ll have ya thinking
That this boy is the beast in the streets
While ya blinking, have ya bopper looking like you been drinking

I’ll eat ya, it’s like I have speakers in my speakers
So when they speaking on it all they can speak of is a beaster boy
So don’t make me just treat ya to a feast
A beast that just beats off both of your ear drums

King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
King, King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
