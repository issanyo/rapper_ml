[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Check out my bathing apes
I'm fresh to death and you like me
Don't try to cop my style, man
Stick to them Nikes
Green, white, black inside these
Super clean bathing apes
My shoes like my chain
Shine hard they might hurt your face
My Bape is my new jacket
Zip up so it hide me
Bapes on my feet and got Jibbs right beside me
You wanna get them (Yeah)
But you can't get like me (No)
Asking me "Soulja Boy, where you got your shoes" (Ayyy)

[Bridge: Jibbs]
Ay Soulja Boy
You put me up on these Bapes my dude
Yeah I got about 50 pairs in my closet my dude

[Verse 2: Jibbs]
I ain't had no bathing apes
So I went to Nigo
And told him to give me some of that official Baby Milo
Now I got some bathing apes
Not only do I got bathing apes
But I got King Kong so you could really say I'm bathing apes
It's even in my bathtub I really bathed an ape
Check the shoes on my feet I stay straight in Bapes
A few G's in my pocket yeah I spin that cake
So take a look at them again, uh, these my [feet?]

[Verse 3: Arab]
Bathing apes on my feet and everybody heard me
Kicks purple yellow white, like my Kobye Bryant jersey
You ain't ever seen these shoes? Well let me tell you something, son
You see how fresh these shoes is? These is not no Air Force Ones
Step up on the stage with my mouth on froze
Bathing apes on my feet put the crowd on hold
Haters see them on my feet I know they getting madder
Little Arab rocking more colors than a bag of skittles

[Hook x4]
I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got I got me some bathing apes
I I I I I I

[Bridge 2]
Bathing apes on my feet so i gotta keep it moving
Step up on the scene tell the girls start choosing
Start choosing, yo
Start choosing, yo
Start choosing, yo

Yah
