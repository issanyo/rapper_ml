[Intro]
Yeah, I am sendin' this one out to
Everyone who has had to wait on a money transfer
Yeah, it's kinda whack when they charge you like ten percent on the dollar
But you know how good it feels when they say

[Hook]
You can pick it up today
It's just fifteen minutes away

[Verse 1]
The worst thing is the waitin', man
It's spiritually drainin', I guess I could repaint
But don't think I'm complainin'
I'm in my small apartment
This month has been the hardest
I couldn't afford some omelettes
I'm broken like an empty promise
Sometimes when I'm in a meeting
And everyone else is eating
I feel so awkward askin', so I pretend like I am fastin'
My girl had paid my payments
She wants to save my anus
She says my love's contagious
But my pride is so outrageous
She sent me Western Union, so I can make it through'n
It felt so good when she said write down this eleven digits
I go out to receive it, I'm desperate and I need it
Feels like an angel speakin', I can hardly believe it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You finally got a caller
You met him in Sao Paula
A tourist with a dollar
He's some kind of a balla
Two babies in a scroller
And still he wants to holla
He likes your Pepsi cola
But you ain't runnin' low-la
Brazilians make it easy
For bellas or fo sheezy
The sun would make him dizzy
Working for something mezlee
These girls will make you trust em
Because sweetness in the custom
But everyday they hustlin'
Every day they hustlin'
John calls her with the number
Home with her local lover
Who was it that picked up the phone?
Oh, that was just my brother
She goes out to receive it
She's desperate and she needs it
It's like an angel speaking
She can hardly believe it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got my conformation
The Western Union agent said grandma's destination
Had violent inclination, but now I'm proudly pacin'
And walking to the station, heavy perspiration
But you can't tell me nothin'
I got my biz in order
I made it cross the border
Such dazzle, such a horror
His life is like an opera
Grandma I never forget you
Worry, I'll never let you
Soon as I leave the venue, this money I will send you
I still haven't gone astray, don't drink or smoke and sway
Though sometimes I don't pray
It feels so good to say, go out and receive it
Cause I just know you need it
Your boy has grow up decent, grandma can you believe it

[Hook]
