[Hook 1: K'naan]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
So waive your flag, now waive your flag
Now waive your flag, oh

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat
So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say

[Hook 2: K'naan]
When I get older, I will be stronger
I'll make it better, struggle on my own but
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
So waive your flag, now waive your flag
Now waive your flag, now waive your flag
Now waive your flag, now waive your flag
Now waive your flag, oh!

[Verse 2: will.i.am & K'naan]
[K'naan (will.i.am)]
So many wars (wars), settling scores (scores)
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
[will.i.am (K'naan)]
And in an situation, when it's a compensation
They got no occupation, to buy no medication
See it's a combination, of no education
But we gonna never [?] and say tomorrows generation
Cause they control us, no they can't hold us down
We gonna pick it up even though we all struggling, (fighting to eat)
And we wondering, (when we'll be free)
[K'naan (will.i.am)]
So we patiently wait (wait) for that faithful day (Go!)
It's not far away but for now we say

[Hook 3: K'naan (will.i.am)]
When I get older, I will be stronger
I'll make it better, struggle on my own but
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
So waive your flag (yeah), now waive your flag (yeah)
Now waive your flag (yeah), now waive your flag

[K'naan (& will.i.am)]
Now waive (your flag), now waive your flag
Now (waive your flag), oh!

[Bridge: K'naan]
Oooooh! Oooooh! Oooooh! Oooooh!
And everyone will be singing it
(Oooooh!)
And you and I will be singing it
(Oooooh!)
And we all we be singing it
Oooooh! Ooooooooh!

[Hook 4: K'naan (& will.i.am)]
When I get older, I will be stronger, stronger, stronger
I will be stronger, stronger, stronger
I will be stronger, stronger, stronger
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
So waive your flag, now waive your flag
Now waive your flag, now waive your flag
Now (waive your flag), now waive your flag
Now (waive your flag, yeah)

(Oooh!, Oooh!)
Just like a wavin' flag
