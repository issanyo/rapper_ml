[Verse 1: Sensei]
Flexin' in my white tee looking like some yola
Lil' shawty bend it over but she don't do yoga
Pull up in the foreign might just make you vomit
All this eating got my stuffed, I got heavy pockets
She give me brain 'til she go dumb
I smoke dope 'til my lung go numb
Ringo Starr Ringo Starr bitch I keep the drum
Got my thumb through check, you can't get none

[Verse 2: Larry]
Pull up on em quick bitch like "what is this"
If he see what I see he might just get pissed
Spent 3200 on some fabrics (Garments!)
Drowned in water diamond so elaborate (drippin' drippin' drippin')
Rollin' I'm rollin', I got the mud in my colon
Say I'm chosen I'm chosen and that's just something worth knowing
Chokin' and chokin' and bitch they don't get no token
These goons in my cell phone don't show no emotion

[Verse 3: Randy]
Pull up on em quick with a biscuit
Randy wear all black just like a misfit
I got bands, I got bands
Your front's counterfeit
This bitch just popped a molly now she's on the fritz
I get all the cheese like a plate of grits
How much Randy ask, you better reminisce
Lean got me slower than molasses
Imma pull up on your bumper like traffic
