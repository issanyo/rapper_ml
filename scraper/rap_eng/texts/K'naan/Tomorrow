[Intro]
Believe it or not
It’s some strange way
This is a Sean Kingston cover
I promise
But… it’s because I wrote the song

[Verse 1]
Visions in my head would lay
All the plans I had delayed
Tricks on me my mind will play
See you laying next to me

Wind that shakes the barley tree
When the only friend of me
She prepared me food and drinks
Cause' I will need all my strength

[Hook x2]
Tomorrow
I'm finally coming home tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey
What's one more day to wait

[Verse 2]
I meet with this foolish shrink
Tries to tell me what to think
But I'm wiser than he knows
In one ear and out it goes

How can they say you don't exist
When I've been branded by your lips
Nothing they can say or do
Will keep me from seeing you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I know I’ve been saying this for years
Most the difference, cause now it’s here
We’ll see who has the last laugh
When they see me with you tomorrow

[Hook x4]
