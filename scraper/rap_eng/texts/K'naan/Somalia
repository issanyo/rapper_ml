Uh
Yeah
Somalia

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I spit it for my block
It’s an ode, I admit it
Here the city code is lock and load
Any minute is rock and roll
And you rock and roll
And feel your soul leavin’
It’s just the wrong dance
That'll leave you not breathin’
I’m not particularly proud
Of this predicament but
I’m born and bred
In this tenement, I'm sentimental, What?!
Plus it’s only right to represent my hood
And what not
So I’m about to do it in the music; in the movies
Cut to the chase pan across to the face
I'm right there
Freeze frame on the street name
Oops wait a minute
This is where the streets have no name
And the drain of sewage
You can see it in this boy how the hate is brewin’
Cause when his tummy tucks in
Fuck the pain is fluid
So what difference does it make
Entertaining threw it
Some get high mixing coke and gun powder, sniffin’
She got a gun but could have been a model or physician

[Hook 2x]
So what you know bout the pirates terrorize the ocean
To never know a simple day without a big commotion
It can’t be healthy just to live with a such steep emotion
And when I try and sleep, I see coffins closin’

[Verse 2]

Yeah
Yeah
We used to take barb wire
Mold them around discarded bike tires
Roll em down the hill on foot blazin’
Now that was our version of mountain bike racing
Daammn!
Do you see why it’s amazing
When someone comes out of such a dire situation
And learns the English language
Just to share his observation!
Probably get a Grammy without a grammar education
So fuck you school and fuck you immigration!
And all of you who thought I wouldn’t amount to constipation
And now I’m here without the slightest fear and reservation
They love me in the slums and in the native reservations
The world is a ghetto administerin’ deprivation
But mommy didn’t raise no fool did she hoyo?
I promise I would get it and remain strictly loyal
Cause when they get it then they let it all switch and spoil
But I just illuminated it like kitchen foil
A lot of main stream niggas is yappin’ about yappin’
A lot of underground niggas is rappin’ about rappin’
I just wanna tell you what’s really crackalackin
Before the tears came down this is what happened

[Hook 2x]
