[Chorus: Mark Foster]
I spy with my little eye a murderer
A murderer
Soul on the wretched in the streets you've never heard of
The streets you’ve never heard of
These are the people who were tryin harder to sleep or what
Trying harder to sleep or what
We sailin' on we sailin' in the seas appease no-one

[Verse 1: K'naan]
I know I know I know I know I came a long way
Oh yeah we from a hard-knock life all day
I kill a killer with a killer-spit 9mm
On my hip
Went legit
Then signed me a deal-a
Had it hard so you bitter nigga cry me a river
Coz I'm from the piss and life's grimiest liver
I mean it’s realer? than brooder? than fruger? than
I’m really little
Got a brother and a sister and I’m in the middle
Mother tryin' figure out how to buy me a dinner
Then I hide a piece of bread for my little nigga
Coz he waitin outside
Too shy to ask and too young to die
Too weak to rob and too good to lie
Two years go by… he a killer
Pissed about a piller
Then he go to work
Monkey see monkey do grow the guerilla
So he turned another wife into a widow
Which turned another son into a bitter
Root of all evil it’s all lethal injection without interjection from people
Fall back
But ain’t no cushion round here
This is my block
Call it cock-block coz ain't no pussy 'round here
He's a hard-head, and a pot-head, if he keep it up he'll be a chopped head
But he heard his voice in the future instead
And it said:

[Chorus: Mark Foster]
You're feelin' small, it seems so high
It’s just a wall, I’m waiting on the other side
I won't let you slide
Love won't break, I'll catch you on the other side

[Verse 2: K'naan]
Merci merci for all my blessings and the mercy
Coz sometimes it coulda gotten messy
Like if my shot came and left me
Still actin wild, dumb and thirsty
Still sayin' come and test me
Still sellin' crack by Yonge n Wellesley
And low wage cops could still arrest me
That’s just not sexy
I know you feel it
Who woulda thought I would go 4-wheelin in Morocco
With a fine dime I brought from Stockholm
Take it from a warchild never enlisted
Life is twisted
Like:
"I'm not the only one" Lennon said
Chapman is here
But Lennon's dead

[Chorus: Mark Foster]
You're feelin' small, it seems so high
It's just a wall, I'm waiting on the other side
I won't let you slide
Love won’t break, I'll catch you on the other side

[Bridge: Mark Foster]
Don't let me go astray
Coz I am afraid
I need your strength
So I won’t be afraid

[Hook: Mark Foster]
I spy with my little eye a murderer
A murderer
Soul on the wretched and the streets you've never heard of
The streets you've never heard of
These are the people who are tryin harder to sleep or what
Tryin harder to sleep or what
We sailin on we sailin in the seas appease no-one
