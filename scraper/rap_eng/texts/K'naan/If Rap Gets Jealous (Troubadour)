[ verse 1]
Yeaaa, Uh
Let me introduce me, I don't gotta pack due to the fact I'm Africa's Rap Bruce Lee
Plus they've been trying to shoot me since I was two feet
So I am never scared, you can Youtube me
Where Im from they will pull your card Mister, you ain't hard mister
I was initiated into manhood at thirteen and it wasn't a barmitzvah
I break a bottle on ya like a bad bartender
Let my star venture out, I got war in me, so let me vent it out

I dont expect you to feel my pain, but with respects to the rules of the game, They dont apply because I made it this far, stage dive like a ghetto rockstar

[Hook]
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if mothafuckers dont get it
So if rap gets jealous, cause of where I'm headed, I used to be a public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if mothafuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, baby Im a menace, you know, I came to bring the pain

[ Verse 2]
Ill admit it I could spit it like a fitted knitted cap. That means tight and won't stop like a city cab
That means I'm not white but I figured do it big because the slum needs me
So instead of getting a beat from Kanye(eezy) who would probably take half my budget
I could save the back end and send it back to Mogadishu where my family and friends getting patched up again you can ask hova
The hood is harder than you thought like a fifty chain getting snatched... in Angola? {Not sure}

I don't expect you to feel my pain, but with respects to the rules of the game, They don't apply because I made it this far, stage down like a ghetto rockstar

[Hook]

(You know)x4
(Kirk Hammett solo)

So dont tell me I gotta be the same, I'm tryin to get you to know my name, And with respects to the rules of the game, they dont apply because I came this far, stage dive like a rockstar
[ Hook x 2]
