[Verse]
Getting shot is easy, tried it 7 times
Now I'm just a solo poet workin on my rhymes
Killer used to think he was wise to the system
Prince of the street always do things his way
But he had a case of conventional wisdom
Never say nothing the others don't say
Threat of dawn that wakes the east to the cry
My souls unfolding, oh God, oh man
Livin high at last sucking the tit milk
Of prayer and fast, man gave the news in a slanted room
And it felt like a sliver of icy truth, felt my sad ass soul
Flying out the mouth would go to splitting down
To the root, let me be who I was
I'm round through that loss but living...

[Chorus]
Coming from the streets to Mecca (Mecca)
Death no matter where you go, come and get ya (get ya)
Coming from the streets to Mecca (Mecca)
Death no matter where you go, come and get ya (get ya)

[Chorus]
Coming from the streets to Mecca (Mecca)
Death no matter where you go, come and get ya (get ya)
Coming from the streets to Mecca (Mecca)
Death no matter where you go, come and get ya (get ya)
