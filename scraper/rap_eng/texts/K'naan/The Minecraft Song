[Chorus]
Today I just feel like playing Minecraft
I just wanna play it all day
Don't feel like going out at all, so let me hit this with my all
'Cause today, I swear, I'm just playing Minecraft

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna turn on my computer and click on my game
Get me some soda, puts creepers to shame
Nothing's gonna kill me today
I start to build my house up in a little hurry
Before my health bar gets taken from me
'Cause in this world I'm the freaking man

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yes, I said it, I said it
I said it 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today I just feel like playing Minecraft
I just wanna play it all day
Don't feel like going out at all, so let me hit this with my all
'Cause today, I swear, I'm just playing Minecraft
Playing Minecraft, playing Minecraft!
Playing Minecraft, playing Minecraft!
Playing Minecraft!

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow I'll wake up, get some diamonds
I got a really nice pick, it's made of iron
And I'm gonna scream out, “This is great!”
Oh my god, this is great!
I'll keep mining down and find what I need
I bet Notch will be so proud of me
But he will never know who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yes, I said it, I said it
I said it 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today I just feel like playing Minecraft
I just wanna play it all day, day, day, day
Don't feel like going out at all, so let me hit this with my all
'Cause today, I swear, I'm just playing Minecraft
Playing Minecraft, playing Minecraft!
Playing, playing Minecraft!
Playing Minecraft!

[Bridge]
„Du hast da Kohle überseh'n!“
Playing Minecraft, playing Minecraft!

[Chorus]
Today I just feel like playing Minecraft
I just wanna play it all day
Don't feel like going out at all, so let me hit this with my all
'Cause today, I swear, I'm just playing Minecraft
Playing Minecraft, playing Minecraft!
Playing Minecraft, playing Minecraft!
Playing Minecraft, playing Minecraft!
