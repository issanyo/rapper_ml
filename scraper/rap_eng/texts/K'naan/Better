[Verse 1: K'naan]
Since I was a kiddo, I was a leader
Heard life was a beach, but, man I wanna meet her
Swimming deeper but the grim reaper will always creep up
No ice on my bed,So I never sleep up
Flow Bolt like Usain try n keep up
Way before waving flag in the FIFA
I was a dreamer life was a gamble
Born in a casino, but god never give burdens you can’t handle
Music is my ammo, I’m ready for battle

[Hook]
Win or lose right now, I'm betting all my chips
When I'm broken down, I be brushing off my kicks
I'mma get it somehow yeah you can count on this
I'm only getting better, better, better
I'm only getting better, better, better

[Verse 2]
I would say that I've always been a winner
But, I've probably always been a sinner
Two kids and a wife couldn't give her
What she wanted so I had to break like the winter
Summer saw me fall coldplay when I shiver
Spring back up K'naan not a quitter
And success just sex trying to get her wetter
Failing is just an excuse for me to get better
Life means love, love means pain
Lust is just a part of it, charge it to the game
Rolling in the deep, what’s a nice jeep
If you can't drop the top just to park it in the rain

[Hook]

[Bridge]
One time for my thugs over seas and
Two time for my brother big league and
Three for yourself if you know to grow up
Is never giving up on your dreams and
Roll the dice life is a breeze

[Hook]
