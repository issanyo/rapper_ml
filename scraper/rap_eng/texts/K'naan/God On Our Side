It's a movie and the whole world is viewing it
And the popcorn is dreams torn, but we're always chewing it
The set design is by God but the costumes by the devil
And the screenplay is adapted from a book that's embezzled

This is where I grew up
This is where I grew proud
This is where neighbors never say music is too loud
This is where the streets have no name, but they have history
This is loss is victory

Oh my name it ain't nothing; my age it means less
The country I come from could be like the rest
I was taught and brought up there, laws to abide
And the land that I live in has God on its side

I was young; I grew. I could tie my shoe
I was blind, but I knew that I would always see blue
Blue seas I see through on the bottom I'll meet you
And when we come up for a breath would you mind if I kiss you?

Childhood came up for the kiss, but it slips its pain in with mist
And the sunny skies came and I missed it
Vanished and when swept
Landed we slept in the arms of convenience, blanket obedience

Now to some of the Americans
War had its day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
And the names of our warlords
I was made to memorize
With guns in their hands, they said
God's on their side

I had an undying wish to keep from dying
I had an untimely hitch keep me from climbing
But I climbed a hitch itself and I tried flying
I had an uprising in my soul
The left was fight in the right
And the right was fight in the light
And the light was blind in the night
And the night woke up in tears
When my fingers went to wipe them
They became a poem but to write then
They would have to speak tears in another language
That would take years

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
If God's on our side then would you ever need war?
