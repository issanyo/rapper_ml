[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Look
I had a reoccurring dream really teasing my mind
A search for a better purpose to be perfectly in line
A serpent is walking, a surface is swerving; it's spewing lies
I find, I'm watching my belt, I'm wasting my time
I swung high off the sky, from a tree to the vine
To land on my feet, devious but dealing with pride
I need a...
I need a breather to catch up on my second wind and speed up
Running from Hell, a speed demon
A cell, a key jingling, jingling, jingling, a gun, bang bang
They bang, you slain, insane, they playing they game
I've been praying for things money could never buy
Like live and die as a man, a coward dies a thousand times
I'm outta sight and outta mind, I'm outta mind but don't mind it
Salvaging the silence 'til the cavalries arriving
Balancing a climate moving forward, looking up and then behind us
If you love me I can lead you where the light is

[Chorus: Mark Foster]
Say what you love, it's alright
Don't be afraid to find your light
Embrace the day, like night
We hear the fire
We all go wild again
And you have the name
Of someone I love
You said, just keep it true
Lift up your name
Seasons change
You know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you

[Verse 2: Saba]
Pay the man, pay the man
Run from my past like I run track, it's traumatic
My palace is Polamalu, I'm grounded like getting sacked
I race demons like Nascar, no assistance like Nascar
One step forward, two steps back watch when I'm at war
At war

[Interlude: Mark Foster]
And when it's raining
We're sailing
Oh yeah, we're sailing
We're sailing
I'm off the leash
I go to war for peace

[Verse 3: Saba]
I sleep with an eye open like I'm an ocular
I'm the opposite of a carper with carpal tunnel
Ain't never took a handout, no tunnel vision to it got my planned route
Like a cockroach in an ant farm I'mma stand out
Clock'll tick like a doggy dancing for foggy lantern
How I look for light when recording stanza, you know the answers
Uncharted area, the pressures no better medley
Yet here I am, falling right where blind man led me

[Chorus: Mark Foster]
Say what you love, it's alright
Don't be afraid to find your light
Embrace the day, like night
We hear the fire
We all go wild again
And you have the name
Of someone I love
You said, just keep it true
Lift up your name
Seasons change
You know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you

[Bridge: Mark Foster]
Pay the man, you got to pay the man
Pay the man, you got to pay the man
Pay the man
Well, I was laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
Laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
Was laughing real hard but my teeth fell out
Need a little something
Need a little something
(A little something, little something, little something)

[Chorus: Mark Foster]
You said, just keep it true
Lift up your name
Seasons change
You know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
Before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you

[Outro: Mark Foster]
Can't you see
Can't see me
Can't see me
Can't see me
And can't see me
Can't see me
We all run when the light comes on
Am I wrong, for wanting it all?
But I warned you
