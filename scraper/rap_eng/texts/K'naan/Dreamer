[Intro:]
Uh, yeah
Believe it or not
What kept me alive
Is my Dreams

[Hook: x2]
I'm a dreamer, but I ain't the only one
Got problems but we love to have fun
This is our world, from here to your hood
We alive man, it's okay to feel good!


[Verse 1: K'naan]
I got a friend named Flow
Who got a friend named Blow
With a finger named Clap
That'll leave you on the side like a Kangol hat
He ain't have no choice he was born this way
These streets pull your number like a phone display
And you gotta be defensive with your life
You gotta be like Bush and take pre-emptive strikes
And "The boys from the hood are always hard"
Let alone in Mogadishu it's a mastered art
If you bring the world hoods to a seminar
We from the only place worse than Kandahar
Man that's kinda hard
But we still like to party and Hardy-hard
Something good happens we say "Mashallah"
Something bad happens, "Que sera, sera"
I close my eyes and all I can see, is you dancing with me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: K'naan]
It's okay to feel good
It's the truth!
Ayyo, and check it out

What would it take for a boy about my age
To hear cheers in his head upon that stage?
And the cheers they would drown out the tears from my brown eyes
C'mon backstage
You see the screams ain't the screams from gunshot screams
In my dreams these screams are from hot teens
And I'm barely thirteen and pack a dirty
Ol' Russian firearm that shoots thirty
Just then I hear the bus engine
I'm transcendin'
I'm crowd surfin'
I can't see the time burnin'
I'm not hurtin'
With my mahogany pen
"I'm on a world Tour, with Muhammed and them!"
And we be overseas, and not in these streets
Where my peeps stay alive, like the Beegees
And the likes of Jay-Z would say my steez
Say he handily brought, hip hop peace

[Hook x2]

Sometimes we just like to have fun, man we like to forget
All the fighting, all the guns and the tires burnin

[Verse 3: K'naan]
Back on the verse
Imagine crack wasn't birthed
Imagine that Earth wasn't hurt
Imagine no Homeland alerts
Imagine no record locator
So I wouldn't have to get a criminal waiver
Imagine the piece wasn't in my briefs
Instead peace could stretch across the seas
So finally we could we could just rest in the East
No Refugees
And you, well you could dress in a book
And I could read your body with less than a look
I got a dream girl in my mind, that's the hook
An intellectual, sexual and still can cook

And I feel good right now...I feel good right here
You feel good right now? You feel good??

[Hook 2x]

[K'Naan speaking to end]
We not down and out...just because the times are hard
Uh-uh...uh-uh...yeah...shout out to the strugglers
In my country...the hardest place on Earth right now
But still...I still know how to get down
I still know how to vibe out
Still know how to talk to a pretty girl
Take it easy now...YEAH
