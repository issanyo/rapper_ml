[Hook]
Biscuit, I got my biscuit
Biscuit, Don't get it twisted
I keep them running and running
I keep them running and running
I keep them running and running
I keep them running and running
For my biscuit
Biscuit, I got my biscuit
Biscuit, Don't want to risk it
I keep them running and running
I keep them running and running
I keep them running and running
I keep them running and running

[Verse 1]

Before I wanted to spit
I wasn't so legit
I used roll with a bunch of drug-dealing immigrant hooligans
Oh yeah and when the the sun would set
Your life was in a bet
We used to click-up and stick-up pick-up
Whatever we could get
And we were deep when added up
If you the shabby luck
To meet us in an alley Fuck
My people quick to strap it up
And Burr
