[Intro: Keane]
Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Keane, K'naan]
Some days, feel my soul has left my body
Feel I'm floating high above me
Like I'm looking down upon me (Oh, whoa, Oh whoa)
Start sinking, every time I get to thinking
It's easier to keep on moving
Never stop to let the truth in (Oh, whoa, Oh whoa)
Sometimes I feel like it's all been done
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one
Sometimes I wanna change everything I've ever done
I'm too tired to fight and yet too scared to run

[Chorus: Keane]
And if I stop for a minute
I think about things I really don't wanna know
And I'm the first to admit it
Without you I'm a liner stranded in an ice flow

[Verse 2: K'naan, Keane]
I feel like a thief who has no faith
Made immortal by the grade
Of the drugs he took that day (Oh, whoa, Oh whoa)
Sinking in the pain he's been inflicting
Yet he's feeling like the victim
Just a horoscope's to blame (Oh, whoa, Oh whoa)
Sometimes I feel like a little lost child
Sometimes I feel like the chosen one
Sometimes I wanna shout out 'til everything goes quiet
Sometimes I wonder why I was ever born

[Chorus: Keane]
And if I stop for a minute
I think about things really I don't wanna know
And I'm the first to admit it
Without you I'm child and so wherever you go
I will follow

[Verse 3: K'naan]
And baby you are just beautiful from crown to your cuticles
You held down my two sons, you never frown when duty calls
You know me, I gave you more than you can handle
But you still keep a handle on it, even when I take something beautiful and vandal on it
No more females? Well how come my emails got notes on a scandal
It's like Eve with the apple
A priest in the chapel
Overcome by the devil's tackle
I'm still shackled the bad til I know
I'm such a hassle every time I let my thoughts go
I get baffled so I hardly pause
I just crossed seas with these gnarly broads
Cos it hurts me just to see what I finally lost
So I guess I'm just a fiend
Consumed by the scene
The stage and the screens
Where it's just me and Keane

[Chorus: Keane & K'naan]
And if I stop for a minute
I think about things I really don't wanna know
So I guess I'm just a fiend
Consumed by the scene
And I'm the first to admit it
Without you I'm a liner stranded in an ice floe
The stage and the screens
Where it's just me and Keane
