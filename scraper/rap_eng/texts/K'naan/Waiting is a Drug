[Verse 1]
Uh, and I'm one of those
I don't wanna boast, but I waited most
When I was born I already made it to be a ghost
Life was a cage, instead it had an age
That I had to wait, hated everyone of those years
And I cried, actually I tried I'm surprised my eyes froze, nose couldn't blow
So emotions couldn't flow I supposed had it wait
For the autumn to go then the springs in my tears
Came and fell on the snow
They made a well in the snow; cheers
Then had to be 18 to make a toast beer
Couldn't have those, gotta get to Heaven just to have wine
And I probably gotta die just to have time
But how long have I waited just to have mine

[Hook]
Waiting for the sun then
Waiting for the rain
Waiting for the night then
Waiting for the day
Waiting for a holiday so we can get away
Waiting to come home, at home we never wanna stay
Waiting for love, waiting for love
Waiting for love, waiting for love
Waiting for me, the sun got the stars
Cause for you, waiting is a drug

[Verse 2]
And I want a taste
I don't mind trouble, but add a little bass
I don't mind subtle, but add a little waist
If it was me, though, what would you say
Got a Coldplay following in Bombay
Say what you want, but son I don't play
Throat belong in Guantanamo Bay
Skinny but well fed, wha gwan 'dred?
Shout out anybody named Muhammad
Cause no lie I know about a hundred
The right mom bled, cause way back niggas wanted K'naan dead
But now K's getting so much naan bread
Everybody turn butter chicken
Switching my story was written
Living my vision, you've been waiting for me to bug
But waiting is a drug

[Hook]

And I want a taste
