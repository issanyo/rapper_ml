[Hook]
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me (4x)

[Verse 1]
Is it fair to say that I am stressing out
I'm stationed in Iraq and they won't let me out
My homies said I was stupid for even joining
My counselor said that my decision was disappointing
How she had good slate for good state colleges
And with my good grades it wouldn't have been a problem
But they don't understand just the power of significance
More than brilliance and certainly more than dividends
And if you ask me now would I repeat it
Would I fight in a war I don't believe in
Well the answer is it's not me where the cancer is
They been doing this before Jesus of Nazereth
And after all this time it is still deadly hazardous
And Bush isn't really being all that inaccurate
When he says we're winning the war cos its staggering
But thats cos we're killing everybody that we see
And most of us soldiers we can barely fall asleep
And time and time again I'm feeling incompetent
Cos my woman back home, we're constantly arguing
And I must be crazy cos all I'm obsessing with is
Her myspace and facebook and who's commenting
I swear to god if she's cheatin' I'm doin her ass in
I can tell with one look
And it came to me sounding something like a song hook

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Meet Sarah, the proud mother of young Sebastian
Suburban professional went to college in Ashton
In self pity she suddenly cried
Would my life be important if I suddenly died?
Neighbors saying what a nice women she was
Keeping mostly to herself ever since the divorce
And with the company downsizing and the fall and all
She really shouldn't take it that personal at all
It wasn't her boss who had his eyes on her thighs
And got a rise from her rising off the desk though
And despite remembering saying no plenty of times
It was still a damn surprise being let go
And now stuck with a mortgage she can't afford
And too educated to blame the corporate world
She got on welfare and hated it case work a power trippin
And generally being degraded if
Nothing else she was treated sick
And ineffective which is the worst thing
That she'd been left with
Damn, no magic from David Blaine
No painter to paint this pain
No Morgan Freeman to narrate the shame
So she took refuge in prayer
Kinda like finding god in the phone book
And it came to her sounding something like a song hook

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I guess I told you about myself to a degree
Just by telling you about people like me
But people like me they speak politely
They don't start no beef for a piece of white meat
Everybody gotta eat but everybody doesn't
Which is why I want to tell you about my favorite cousin
He and I grew up where the sun shines
And we both partook in the gun crimes
And we both liked American rap rhymes
Even though we didn't understand one line
If you remember my liner notes in my last album
I talked about a close call with a grenade
I think we both must have been about 7th grade
But don't panic we both survived without damage
But we developed a bond like we survived the titanic
So when the country became frantic
My mother tried to get us out, planned it
To the last detail except the plan got derailed
Cos there wasn't enough money for the plane tickets
How bitter when my mother had to choose who to take with her
So my cousin got left in the war and that's just hard to recall
But now I take refuge in prayer
Kinda like finding god in the phone book
It came to me sounding kinda like something from a song hook
