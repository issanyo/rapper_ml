[Intro: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Captain Crunch presents
Run up on anyone, hey, yo
Hittin' them drugs, run up on anyone
Ay, doin’ the dash, flexin' on everyone (flexin' on fakes, ay)
Hey, hey

[Chorus: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Doin’ the dash, flexin' on everyone (flexin' on anyone)
Hittin' them drugs, run up on anyone (run up on anyone)
It was gettin' the bag, I had to get me one (I had to get me one)
Hitters they made, don't [?] wit' anyone (don't [?] wit’ anyone)
Oh wow (oh wow) I’m in a Jag, slow down (slow down)
Smokin' the gas, so loud (so loud)
I’m in my bag, oh wow (oh wow)
Pour up a four, money talkin', I pick up the phone now (pick up the phone now)
When we pull up we makin' a show now (hey)
Gotta go get the cash, oh wow

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
I gotta show out, switchin' lanes, slow down (slow down)
Sippin’ drink, slow down (slow down)
Gimme brain, oh wow (oh wow)
Water, my necklace, take a video, check it out, stereo flexin' (flex)
I was broke but I get it now
Lotta money in my section (hey)
Fifty bottles, tell 'em "bring it out"
I get the money and stretch it
Fifty models, told 'em "gimme mouth"
I got some rack but I need more
In the hood, Seven-Three-O
Takin' drugs 'cause I need O
Livin' good, count C notes, hey

[Chorus: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Doin' the dash, flexin' on everyone (aye)
Hittin' them drugs, run up on anyone (aye)
It was gettin' the bag, I had to get me one (I had to get me one)
Hitters they made, don't [?] wit' anyone (don't [?] wit' anyone)
Oh wow, I'm in a Jag, slow down (slow down)
Smokin' the gas, so loud (so loud)
I'm in my bag, oh wow (oh wow)
Pour up a four, money talkin', I pick up the phone now (pick up the phone now)
When we pull up we makin' a show now (hey)
Gotta go get the cash, oh wow

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Pull all the racks and show out (what)
[?] her one time, put your hoe out (yuh)
New freezer on my chain now (yuh)
You haters got nothin' to say now (what)
Gather the money then show it (show it)
You niggas, you broke and you bogus
Ain't pickin' up, probably blockin' your bit' (woah)
Quarter mil, that's the business (business)
And he never did dissed our lines, Rich Forever on a jet (yuh)
Ran it up, from the bottom was grindin'
Diamonds on everything and I'm shinin' (woah)
We got the [?] like a bakery (bakery)
You niggas got nothin' to say to me (woah)
Do the dash in the V (esketit)
All hunnits, blue cheese (Rich)

[Chorus: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Doin' the dash, flexin' on everyone (flex, aye)
Hittin' them drugs, run up on anyone (jug, jug)
It was gettin' the bag, I had to get me one (I had to get me one)
Hitters they made, don't [?] wit' anyone (don't [?] wit' anyone)
Oh wow, I'm in a Jag, slow down (slow down)
Smokin' the gas, so loud (so loud)
I'm in my bag, oh wow (oh wow)
Pour up a four, money talkin', I pick up the phone now
When we pull up we makin' a show now
Gotta go get the cash, oh wow
