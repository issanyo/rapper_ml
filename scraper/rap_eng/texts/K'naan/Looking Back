[Verse 1: Keane]
You're living in a place you left behind
Going round in circles all the time
Can see the way your head, it's like you're blind
So open your eyes inâ€”

[Verse 2]
Time realign just what you got
With what you nearly had and what you want
You fall asleep and then the moment's gone
So open your eyes in time

[Pre-Chorus 1: K'naan]
Yeah...
It's hard to undo time
Hard to separate my past from my rhyme
Cause how can you separate milk from lime
Waste my time

[Chorus: Keane/K'naan]
Looking back
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder

[Verse 3]
Think of all the places you could never be
Beauty in the faces that you never see
As you lie there sleeping
How the moment flies
So open your eyes in time

[Pre-Chorus 2: K'naan/Keane]
Yeah...
They say life makes sense backwards
Only you gotta live it forwards
Don't waste your time, no
Don't waste your time just

[Chorus: Keane/K'naan]
Looking back
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder
Looking back
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder

[Bridge: K'naan]
Am I the only one trying to fight off an army
Of memories dressed up all trying to harm me
I feel cocky running up the steps like Rocky
Until the past come flashing like paparazzi
Nothing is new so I open my folder
My favourite view is over my shoulder
Everything backwards is my plight
It's landing first would end my flight
Even my tears run up my cheeks
Back in my eye
Live I die

[Chorus: Keane/K'naan]
Don't waste your time just looking back
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder
You always seem to be looking back
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder

[Outro: Keane]
You're always looking back
Over and over and over
You're always looking back
