[Verse 1]
Picture the morning taste and devour
We rise early pace up the hour
Streets is bustlin' hustlin' their heart out
You can't have the sweet with no sour
Spices, herbs, the sweet scent of flower
She came out precisely the hour
Clouds disappear, the sun shows the power
No chance of a probable shower
I fell in love with my neighbors' daughter
I wanted to protect and support her
Never mind I'm just 12 and a quarter
I had dreams beyond our border

[Hook 1]
Is it true when they say all you need is just love? (Is it true?)
What about those who I have loved?
Only to find that it's taken away
And why do they say that the children have rights to be free? (To be free)
What about those who I've known
Whose memory still lives inside of me

[Hook 2]
Fatima, what did the young man say, before he stole you away?
On that fateful day Fatima
Fatima, did he know your name or the plans we made?
To go to New York City, Fatima

[Verse 2]
And after school we studied the lessons
I ask God to slow down the seconds
He does the opposite that's what I'm guessin'
I better chill and count my own blessings
Fatima, Fatima what is the matter?
How come you ain't come up the ladder?
So we can be like there's no tomorrow
Damn you gonna make me wait until tomorrow
She spoke Arabic and Swahili
She'd say "Upendo anta habibi"
You so bright, you shine like my TV
Then one day she never came to meet me

[Hook 1]
[Hook 2] x2

[Verse 3]
If beauty was in the eyes of beholder
How come everyone hushed when she walked by
How come girls would look just to scold her
How come the angel wanted to hold her?
Fatima, Fatima I'm in America
I make rhymes and I make 'em delicate
You would have liked the parks in Connecticut
You would have said I'm working too hard again
Damn you shooter, Damn you the building
Whose walls hid the blood she was spillin'
Damn you country so good at killin'
Damn you feelin' for persevering

[Hook 1]
[Hook 2]x2

[Outro]
Now I just want to make it clear
I don't want you to shed a tear
Cuz this here (Fatima) is a celebration
We're not mourning, we're celebrating
(Fatima) Yeah
So baby don't cry
Please don't let the tears fall
(Fatima) So don't cry
