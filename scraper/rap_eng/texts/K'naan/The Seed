[Verse 1]
It's not a miracle that I am here today
Life has been been difficult, but I'm not typical
I mean a long long time, ago I should have died
But see my blood's on fire, I can't help but survive

[Pre-Hook]
I never run away
I done being afraid
Put it on my name
No matter what the stakes
Lookin' in the face of danger
Cause struggles never been a stranger

[Hook]
I was a seed planted by lovers
In a refugee camp in over seas
I grew free I grew my roots
And became a tree
So now they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna, never gonna

[Verse 2]
My skin is black and green, nothing you haven't seen
You know my history I stand for victory
They turn their backs to me, they take an axe to me
I got my weight up now, nothing can knock me down

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

[Bridge x2]
Oh-ah oh-ay, I know how
Oh-ah oh-ay, I survive now
(Oh a oh e I know how
Oh a oh e I survive now)

[Hook]
