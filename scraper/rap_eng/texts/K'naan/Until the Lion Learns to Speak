[Intro:]
Yo, this one here goes out to the struggle
In the tradition of the old poets
Yo, the nation of poets
We haven't forgotten that
Yo, in the tradition of [?], God bless his soul
I want to say something to you, my friends around the mic

[Verse 1:]
Until the lion learns to speak
The tales of hunting will be weak
My poetry hails within the streets
My poetry fails to be discrete
It travels across the earth and seas
From Eritrea to the West Indies
It knows no boundaries
No cheese
It studied in parts of Greece
(runtaa hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)
I am sick as far as lyrics
And with this far as gimmicks
I spit par age and limit
The shit they talk and rip it
I am hip the hop as living
I skip the obvious woman
Don't get what I am presenting
No rims my mind spinning
(runtaa hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)

[Verse 2:]
I was born and raised in a place
Where torn of flame would place
Where the foreigners not embrace
Where they warn you jog and pace
Where loners lower they gaze
Where the corners slow at a chase
Where they tarts and turn in the maze
With the pistol upon your face
(runtaa hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)
So come with me to my longs
The death and deal we run
With passion see how I come
No cash I am free in the slums
The past can we overcome
I am asking we be the ones
To actually be the ones
To free our people from gun
(hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)

[Verse 3:]
I was born and raised in a place

(runtaa hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)

[Verse 4:]
Until the lion learns to speak
The tales of hunting will be weak
My poetry hales with in the streets
My poetry fails to be discrete
It travels across the earth and seas
From Somalia to the West Indies
It knows no boundaries
No cheese
It studied in parts of Greece
(Hadii kale waxaan lahaa aheey)
Say I am sick as far as lyrics
And with this far as gimmicks
I spit par age and limit
The shit they talk in rapid
I am hip the hop as living
I skip the obvious woman
Don't get what I am presenting
No rims my mind spinning
(runtaa hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)
