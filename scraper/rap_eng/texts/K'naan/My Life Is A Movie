[Hook]
I can't even take it no more
So what will it take to let me in a door?
My life is a movie subtitled to suit me
Action and drama filled with black uzis

[Verse 1]
I'm a retarded artist, I walk with a limp
I'm sick, I should see a shrink, I'm unstable in the whip
I talk with a slang, old school, top of the game
I owe money, I can't even talk to the bank
I'm furious, my [?] tape is so serious
I sport more blood raps than periods
Check me out like a product you about to buy
I'm hot, motherfucker you about to fry
Where I'm from, rappers say "we don't go"
When I'm around here, rappers say "we don't flow"
And why's that? Cause wise rappers act like that
They don't want it, they can't say more than "blah blah blah"
Just teasing, I could be sub-freezing
I'm out to kill like white men in duck season
I'm fresh, sicker than the [?] rate too
But you wouldn't get the point even if my finger faced you

[Hook]
I can't even take it no more
So what will it take to let me in a door?
My life is a movie subtitled to suit me
Action and drama filled with black uzis

[Verse 2]
Shoot me, I got zero so sue me
I hear gunshots, inspirations go through me
You frightened, calm down, who's fighting?
You're like Avril, the question is: who's writing?
I should sing like Andr√© 3000 (Outkast!)
Punk rap, same but had these kids acting
I propose new ideas while you buy beers
You think I'm dope, what you do that is
I don't blame you, I'm violently soul-jazzy
I'm disgusting, I'm twisted and it's all passion
I'm like masturbating in public, I'm so nasty
Figure me out, feel me but don't gas me
I'm truth, I can't shop in the high end
Cause when I go home I be really high then
I ask "where's the love?" like will.i.am
(coughing) That's how sick I am

[Hook]
I can't even take it no more
So what will it take to let me in a door?
My life is a movie subtitled to suit me
Action and drama filled with black uzis

[Verse 3]
What's it all worth? What if it don't work?
What if I can't cope? What if I lose hope?
What if I choose dope? What if I sniff coke?
What if I stay broke? What if they don't fill?
What if it don't kill? What if I don't sell?
What if I don't bail? What if I'm not sick?
What if I'm just well? What if my luck sucks?
What if I fucked up? What if I get stopped?
What if I get knocked? What if I get shot?
What if I get caught? What if I get--?
(?)Deeka deep my stampede(?)

[Hook]
I can't even take it no more
So what will it take to let me in a door?
My life is a movie subtitled to suit me
Action and drama filled with black uzis

[Outro]
Let it ride
Bang ya head
That's it
(Represent, represent)
It's Dusty (represent, represent)
Yo you feel me (represent, represent)
Move out of my way, let me do the running man here
(Represent, represent)
That's it
Check me out, my name is K'Naan the dusty foot philosopher
Good night, ladies and gentlemen
