[Intro]
One two, one one two

[Hook]
I was stabbed by Satan
On the day that I was born
I was promised lovin'
But instead I was torn
Na, na, na, na, na, na
My heart bled tears
Na, na, na, na, na, na
My eyes shed tears

[Verse 1]
A poor black ghetto child
He can't shoot and he can't go run a mile
There's no school and the kids go runnin' wild
The police and the courts wanna run him out
He's so cold and the po po hate 'em all
He ain't seen his daddy since back in '84
But oh well, so it be, now he's in jail
His mother's stressin' just to get him out on bail
Now sing it out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So the story goes on
There's no glory
And the worry takes a toll on
His whole body
But his buddies wanna roll on
It's all bloody
When the cops come to a stop
The police with their big Glocks pull 'em out
They say "freeze" but there's only one comin' out
There's two dead with a legal gun to his head
It's stupid, he shoulda played ball instead
Now sing it out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So one day when it's all said and done
My life will be the bluest rap song ever sung
My verses will be curses to the rich
And all sorts of authority will cease to exist
My daughters will be free of wars in my honor. Your fist
Will raise in the air
Like the silence of revolution
My face will appear
Like the vision of a prisoner with his last beer
This song is a poem and this whole poem is a tear
Dropped to your ear

[Outro]
So why do kids cry when they born?
Ever ask yourself that?
Well, it is said that Satan stabs a child at birth
As an introduction to pain
You know, welcome to the world right?
