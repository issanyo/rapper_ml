[Chorus: Michael Franti]
If I could see Earth from outer space
To all of the stars, to the human race
To all of the people and the streets that I once knew
If I could see earth from outer space
To all of the stars, to the human race
No matter where I go I still come back to you

[Verse 1: Michael Franti]
If I could fly, fly, fly so high, so high
Higher than the clouds, even higher than the sky
Zoom, zoom-ing upon the world rolling by
Would I see people in the cities and the villages and squares
Selling in the market places, dancing everywhere?
Would I see ladies in the beauty parlor doing hair
And teenage soldiers with their guns up in the air?
Would I see a hit list of the species that are gone?
Or would I be a witness to the world dropping bombs?
Would I see the rain forests amazon's on?
Or would the whole world sing one song?

[Chorus: Michael Franti]
If I could see Earth from outer space
To all of the stars, to the human race
To all of the people and the streets that I once knew
If I could see earth from outer space
To all of the stars, to the human race
No matter where I go I still come back to you, you, you
No matter where I go I still come back to you

[Post-Chorus: Michael Franti]
So let me hear you say (na na na na na na)
Woah oh (na na na na na na)
And let me hear you say (na na na na na na)
Break it down for me now (okay)

[Verse 2: K'naan]
I've been trying, I've been trying, I've been trying, I've been trying
That's the truth without the lying, I just knew without the dying
I've been moving, I've been moving out of space so I've been losing
Everybody that I love and they excuse, they just human
And I've been learning how to breathe, learnin how to see
Heart in the clouds, but don't know how to dream
Evidently, your grass is green, I wish I had a personality
And If I was down on Earth, I would sing... sing

[Chorus: Michael Franti]
If I could see Earth from outer space
To all of the stars, to the human race
To all of the people and the streets that I once knew
If I could see earth from outer space
To all of the stars, to the human race
No matter where I go I still come back to you, you, you
No matter where I go I still come back to you

[Bridge: Michael Franti]
I like to see a planet, every boombox booming
I like to see a planet, every flower be blooming
I like to see a planet, solar cars refueling
I like to see a planet, every human staying human
I don't know, but I know just one thing for sure
If I saw this, I'd still come back for more

[Chorus: Michael Franti]
If I could see Earth from outer space
To all of the stars, to the human race
To all of the people and the streets that I once knew
If I could see earth from outer space
To all of the stars, to the human race
No matter where I go I still come back to you, you, you
No matter where I go I still come back to you

[Post-Chorus: Michael Franti]
So let me hear you say (na na na na na na)
I'd still come back to you (na na na na na na)
Still come back to you
No matter where I go (na na na na na na)
I still come back to you (na na na na na na)
Still come back to you (na na na na na na)
Still come back to you (na na na na na na)
Still come back to you
