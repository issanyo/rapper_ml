Yo, K'Naan, man. Love or fear? Choose one

[K'Naan]
Huh, well let me ask you something...
Let me ask everyone actually, studio audience here
The love movement

Yo what's the proportion of the universe's harmony equal to? (Love!)
What's the voice in us, forcing us to favor truth? (Love!)
What's pain and anguish strain vanish in the face of? (Love!)
What's the missing link?
What language do the silent voices sing? (Love!)
I wouldn't ask you if I didn't admire you
So what's between I and you? (Love!)
What's the ocean breeze? Why do men get on their knees? (Love!)
*laughing*
What's life without love like fights without coys and rights we strike off?
What's the deal between our eyes off?
What is it I can't hide other than when I cough? (Love!)
It's love, the opposite of greed and hateful things
It's not symbolized by diamonds, but it does revolve like rings
And time marches into the canvases of uncertainty
Damaging our predictions and conditions we set
Like amnesty, I'm hard to hate
And whether I'm gifted with the poetry I spit is a far debate
I'm living a rhyming state and stealing drops on my soul
And the energy I put forth can sink an army weight
Cause that's love, you see?
There's many things we don't know about love
It's not soft, it's the hardest thing to attain
Cause there's freedom when you're detained
Leave it to me and I'll explain
Cause it's dear to me like my mommy and daddy
And sister and wifey and pens and pads
And thoughts of random order
That border the same struggle of human truth
Who's to say what my words are? (Love!)
That's what's up!
