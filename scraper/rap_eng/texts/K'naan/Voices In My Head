Eh yo, welcome to my world, please listen
HEY!

[Hook:]
Poison in my veins, inside I'm torturing my brains
And still I try, aiaiai
Voices in my head, am I alive or am I dead
Alone I cry, aiaiaiai

[Verse 1:]
Consider configure The shit that I'm in and the pain, I'm literally going insane
I'm frightened, my heart and my head have been fightin
I'm certain that it's hurtin the rest of my body
Them voices as loud as Manhattan come chattin
They say "Who met us and let us in?" and you kno you better than al of these replicates screamin they represent
C'mon man c'mon man
And the people inside me say they wanna see me go on tragically
And it's evil, cause I'm only 20 something working for a crumbs n some bread

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
The harder the struggle the deeper the trouble
Come out of the bubble, I'll teach you to cuddle
With demons inside me, what demon is not me
These demons inside me they got me, they stop me from sleepin
And eatin and keepin it even, and even my reason for breathin this season
Sleetin in a danger, my nose when I'm readin, it's bleedin on paper
It's bleedin on paper
And I'm tired of this violence, so tortured inside? ain't akward and overly open inside, have I already died
Has mom already cried? And why do I feel like I'm over this life
I'm not hateful, I'm grateful, my girlfriend is tasteful, livin it up
I might even blow, like a leak in a truck, with a torch and a clutch
And explosion that leaves a whole coughin off dust, and the people
Inside me saying, they wanna see me go tragically
And it's evil, cause I'm only twenty something, working for some crumbs and some bread

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'm still awake, and it's quarter to six
I'm trying to write and I ain't thought of no shit
I live with guilt like I slaughtered the sick
I live with shame, like my daughter a bitch
I don't make living but I still persist, I could sell out but I still resist
So don't tell me about no pain and shit
I was born and raised in poverty bitch
And I smile all the while and don't complain
I'm something like Gil Scott heroine
Do you know what it feels like to lose a friend, again and again and again, again
The bitterness in the killer the poet, the river of blood within the mess flowin
I'm the bitterness in the killer the poet, the river of the blood will keep on flowin
People inside me say, the wanna see me go on tragically
And it's evil, it's evil, cause I'm only twenty something working for a crumb or some bread or nothin

[Hook: until end]
