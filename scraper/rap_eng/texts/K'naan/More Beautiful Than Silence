[Chorus]
Turn the light off
There's a light on in your heart
So let it be your guidance, guidance
Open your mouth if what you're saying could be more
Beautiful than silence, silence

[Verse 1]
Ok, ain't it funny how the talkers always talking?
Never firing, but always say they cocking
And they're cocky until they end in parking lots
Suddenly they got Parkinson's, they can hardly talk
No karate buddy, no pilates buddy
It's a new game, no Atari buddy
Body chalk, well I'm used to bodies chopped
I've seen shit to give new meaning to the body shop
Look, I know you think I'm so righteous
But motherfucker I'm also into rifles
Tryna' to tell these niggas I'm a baby in these diapers
I'm on my own shit, lighters
I don't assimilate, I got my name in the ciphers
I don't discriminate, I got friends who are snipers
But some of them ended up being lifers
Cause they kept silent, survivors

[Chorus]
Turn the light off
There's a light on in your heart
So let it be your guidance, guidance
Open your mouth if what you're saying could be more
Beautiful than silence, silence

[Verse 2]
I'm the quiet type, breathing steady
Never small talk, speak when necessary
In the streets, I see niggas chop with machetes
My Jamaican girl say "talk to me baby!"
What's on your mind?
Can't say cemetery
Til death do us part, memories, I marry
Got a library with no lies baby
Then all the books look like they're made of strawberries
It ain't easy being me
Cause my own fans can't relate to my streets
And my streets can't relate to those in the east
But I'm beast, so I make bread on release
I'm releasing my demons
Give the beat it's life like I give a fetus semen
Feel the kick in your belly, that's freedom breathing
And on't say nothing, cause now we dreaming

[Chorus]
Turn the light off
There's a light on in your heart
So let it be your guidance, guidance
Open your mouth if what you're saying could be more
Beautiful than silence, silence

Oh, oh, oh, silence, silence
Oh, oh, oh, silence, silence
Oh, oh, oh, silence, silence
Oh, oh, oh, silence, silence
