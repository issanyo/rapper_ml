[Verse 1]

When I was a little boy
Clenched on to my mom's dress
Hanging on like my last breath
Even me I was a mess
Then she teach me to address
Injustice with fearlessness

[Hook]

Ciradiyo jacaylku caway igu kulmeeney
La la lala laa la, la lala la laa la

[Verse 1]
Then I saw the stars faint
Falling them with heartaches
Then I felt the earth shake
Trembling for God's sake
Its like when her voice breaks
Calling me to my place

[Hook]


They say time is like a sword
Striking (god's) the ambition chords
Struggle has its own rewards
So we hope you march forward
Muslims Jews and Christians war
No one is left to praise the Lord!

[Hook]

Verse 2

So if you want to be free
There is no one ? fight it
If you want to see the moon
Then there is no cloud that can hide it
We live in this impossible world
We want change despite it
(Ciradiyo jacaylku caway igu kulmeeney)

La la lala laa la, la lala la laa la
La la lala laa la, la lala la laa la
La la lala laa la, la lala la laa la
