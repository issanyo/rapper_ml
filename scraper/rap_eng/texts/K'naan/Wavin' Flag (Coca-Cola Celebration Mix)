Give me freedom, give me fire
Give me reason, take me higher
See the champions take the field now
You define us, make us feel proud

In the streets our heads are liftin'
As we lose our inhibition
Celebration, it surrounds us
Every nation, all around us

Saying forever young
Singing songs underneath the sun
Let's rejoice in the beautiful game
And together at the end of the day, we all say

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag

So wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag

Give you freedom, give you fire
Give you reason, take you higher
See the champions take the field now
You define us, make us feel proud

In the streets our heads are liftin'
As we lose our inhibition
Celebration, it surrounds us
Every nation, all around us

Saying forever young
Singing songs underneath the sun
Let's rejoice in the beautiful game
And together at the end of the day, we all say

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag

So wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag

We all say, when I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag

So wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag

And everybody will be singing it
And we all will be singing it
