[Verse 1: K'naan]
This morning when I woke up
I walked into a nightmare
And found myself arrested

Before I had my breakfast
I saw they murdered justice
And told me to accept it

Went out to see my neighbors
And saw some demonstrators, and violent liberators
The fire had been raging, where you and I were waiting
Entirely forsaken

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey (Mos Def)]
Ahmed Nabi Muhammad, Ya Shafi'ul Qiyamah, Alay Salaam Alaika
Ahmed Nabi Muhammad, Ya Shafi'ul Qiyamah, Alay Salaam Alaika

[Verse 2:]
The empty tank is ringing
The rig it shakes it's singing
The hollow chief (?) is limping

Around me there's disorder
Intoxicating odor
There's no way to the border

And just who is the martyr?
Is it the fire starter?
Is it the Orphaned daughter?

Will those laugh when they dreaming
And dance away the demon
But don’t you miss the meaning

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]


[K'naan Recites:]
So like I came to the door
I said it before
I never let the Mic magnetize me no more
I could do that as Rakim was doing it [‘it’ echoes out]
