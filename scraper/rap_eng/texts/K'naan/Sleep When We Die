[Verse 1]
We kicking down the door if ever they don't let us in
We don't give a fuck, guess we on that medicine
I'm on that Marley Kush and I ain't talking cannabis
I'm on that crazy bush, yea, something like the president

[Bridge 1]
Where am I? Where am I? Don't have a clue
I'm tripping on stumbling all over you
Sorry just sick a belt, I wasn't tryin' to Copperfield
Somebody take the wheel, I'm not drunk I'm on the thrill

[Hook]
We got our heads in the sky, love got me high
Let's live tonight, sleep when we die
Run from the sunlight into the wild side
Let's live tonight, sleep when we die
We got our heads in the sky, love got me high
Let's live tonight, sleep when we die

[Verse 2]
Found me with the crew
Those minutes in the outlaws
We used to breaking rules
And runnin' from them cop cars
You know them boys in blue, they could be such a kill joy
You see us on the news but we just tryin' to chill boy

[Bridge 2]
Where am I? Where am I? Don't have a clue
I'm tripping on stumbling all over you
Sorry but girl you're bad, OK I'm in the touch out
Somebody take the wheel, I'm not drunk I'm on the thrill

[Hook x3]
