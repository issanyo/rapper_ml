[Intro: K'naan]
Oh, oh
Take me back, take me back
Oh, yeah
Back to summer paradise

[Verse 1: Pierre Bouvier]
My heart is sinking
As I'm lifting up
Up above the clouds away from you
And I can't believe I'm leaving
Oh, I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do
But someday
I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier]
'Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: Pierre Bouvier & (K'naan)]
(Tell them)
My soul is broken
Streets are frozen
I can't stop these feelings melting through
And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
Just to have another one with you (What'd you say?)
Well, real life can wait (It can wait)
We're crashing like waves (Uh-huh)
We're playing in the sand (Me and you)
Holding your hand (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier]
'Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Oh-oh

[Verse 3: K'naan]
Yeah, uh
I remember sunny mornings and summer evenings
Now you're not next to me and I am freezing
Was it real?
Oh baby, tell me, was I dreaming?
How can you show me paradise when I'm leaving?
Now my heartbeat is sinking, hope's shrinking
When I try to speak no words, lip-syncing
Hope this is not just wishful thinking
Tell me that you care and I'll be there in a heartbeat

[Bridge: Pierre Bouvier & K'naan]
Someday
I will find my way back to where your name Is written in the sand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier & (K'naan)]
'Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye (No-no, no)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to (Back to)
Back to summer paradise with you (Yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

[Outro: Pierre Bouvier & K'naan]
I remember when we first kissed
And how I didn't wanna leave your lips
And how I've never ever felt so high
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Yeah (Oh-oh)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Summer paradise (Oh-oh)
I'll be there in a heartbeat
