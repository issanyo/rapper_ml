[Chorus: Boy George]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life

[Verse 1: Andrew Wyatt]
We are wicked men
Lookin' for buckles to loosen
By the count of ten
I wanna see somebody human
And I lost what it was in the teenage dust
Of a downtown Romeo
In a couple of weeks, you can tell all the freaks
How you carried my body home

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Wyatt]
But, tonight, I crossed the line
Dear Mr. Lonely, how much could you know me?
I could find lessons in light
But once you've earned it, you've already burned it

[Chorus: Boy George]
I don't wanna see you go
I need somebody to love me (Need somebody, oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I need somebody to love me (Need somebody, oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life

[Verse 2: Andrew Wyatt]
Got my ticket, man
And I'm lookin' for somebody to use it
I know we pretend
But one of these days, we're gonna lose it
And I once left town when the leaves turned brown
With a couple of souvenirs
She was in my car when we hit that wall
Yeah, it could've moved me to tears

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Wyatt]
But, tonight, I crossed the line
I used to know her when my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
Over and over, is it really over?

[Chorus: Boy George]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me (Need somebody, oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I need somebody to love me (Need somebody, oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Wyatt]
But, tonight, I crossed the line
I used to know her when my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
Over and over, is it really over?

[Chorus: Boy George]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me (Need somebody, oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I need somebody to love me (Need somebody, oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
