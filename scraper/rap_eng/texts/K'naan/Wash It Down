When you here in the water
You feel like it's sorta
Releasin' the tension distress and disorder
Is big in America
Stephanie Erica, both of them suffer from livin' in here
Because
Livin' is very competitive:
Hasslin' creditors, hazardous accidents
Drivin' with negligence
Too many beverages
People got too may things on they lettuces
TV's deadliest professin' the ugliest war, war, war, WAR
What the hell you keep on killin me for?
Please come over and bend down low
Let me tell you what little I know
And if it's worth somethin'
Spread it indeed like shit and vomit that's under your feet

I was born in a pot boilin' black and hot
Waitin' to be tasted and rappin' a lot
But justice would not come and eat my flesh -
Instead, I had poverty to feed my stress
Until my life became an ode to the gun -
Not needed, like a overcoat to the sun
So, I thought I was just made to exist;
Not to live or change and resist
But fear will have you believin' fear -
Paralyzed have you bleedin' tears
This is the therapy needed, so use it
Music is water; you know what my proof is? (What?)
People need music like they need excuses (Ha)
People need water like Kanye needs Jesus

So wash it down (wash it down)
Wash it down (wash it down)(x7)
*gradually fades, continues in background*

(Spoken) I know you stressin': this is a little meditation for you to relax
And jump in the pool, and, you know, sink and sink!

My people drum on water
Drink on water
Live on water
Die for water
