[Verse 1]
I could've been a doctor, were it not for a degree
I could've been a winner, were it not for defeat
I could've been richer, were it not for the taxes
I could've been a scholar, were it not for classes
I could've been a rebel, were it not for a cause
I could've been employed, were it not for the boss

[Hook]
I could've been loved, I could've been loved
I could've been loved, I could've been

[Verse 2]
We could've been artists, were it not for the muses
We could've been on time, were it not for excuses
We could've been diamonds, were it not for the penny
We could've been special, were it not for the many
We could've been patient, were it not for the waiting
We could've been committed, were it not for the staying

[Hook]
We could've been loved, we could've been loved
We could've been loved, we could've been

[Verse 3]
I still love your views, look up your interviews
Got me playing detective, searching for some clues
I wanted to take you home, show you where I've grown
Coffee down in Kenya then a swim in Cameroon
But you're in California, working on your script
Young and beautiful, just trying to make the most of it

[Hook]
You could've been loved, you could've been loved
You could've been loved, you could've been

[Verse 4 x 2]
Hilila wa la halle, qabiilkii waa la daayay
Dagaal la daa, rafaad la daa
Jaceeylkiiyaa waa la raayay

I could've been free, were not for the past
I could've been in first place, were in not for the last
