(Intro: K'naan)
Yeah, yeah, it's me, strugglin'

[Verse 1: K'naan]
I start out, just to vibe out
I ain't about to bow out
I'm more gangsta than you are
But I ain't about the rou' rou'
My season will come, it has to
Honestly I feel like I'm ten months pregnant or something
I'm passed due. Sincerely I'm touchy these days
I can't take nothing, I'm tryna treat my record like the law
Shit, I'm dying to break something
And mostly, I'm up and stressin'
When other folks sleep
Believe me, I know struggle, and struggle knows me
My life owes me, like an overdose
I'm slowly, drifting in the arms of trouble
Then trouble holds me
And nothing else is close to me
More than pain unfortunately
Like a self fulfilling prophecy, I'm suppose to be

(Hook X2)
Strugglin', and it's trouble in
In this circumstance I'm dwelling in
I find myself in the corner huddling
With some angry men and I gotta settle shit again
Before they gotta kill again

[Verse 2: K'naan]
I should be chillin' on beaches
Instead my bone freezes
Ducking Glocks and I walks
Sort of like Jesus
The realest thing for me is
Since I was a fetus
The only break I ever got, was at recess
So legitimately, I remain very little relieved
Then at thug rappers I remain very little intrigued
Can you blame me?
Look how we lived in the late eighties
Throwing rocks at the crazy ladies
And when we'd play these
Crazy games, the whole crew had crazy names
We even had a cripple we use to call em lazy legs
But my faith remains, untouched and unchanged
Still in my block you hear more shots than a gun range
I'm

(Hook X2)

[Verse 3: K'naan]
Aight aight, more to the truth
No writing, just recording in the booth
Forced by the loop and the guitar but I'm the boss of the groove
I speak truth my deep roots remain in equal danger
The pain on my song is crazy but the sequel is stranger
Hey man, I'm from the hardest heartless projects
Dared departed I'm now known as a recording artist
Spilling what little remains of your memories in the process
Bitter a little, but making your names into a colossus
Believe me, I'm thankful my brother's still with me
And ain't much changed Bobby is still troubling Whitney
And Bush is still bombing poor people yo he's deadly
And me I got a little recording gig but evidently I'm

(Hook X2)

(Outro)
Yeah...Yeah...The pain in my song is crazy
The pain in my song is crazy
Strugglin', still strugglin'
