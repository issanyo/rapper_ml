[Hook:K'Naan]

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me, people like me, people like me, people like me

[Verse 1: James]

All alone by myself nobody's around
I got my head in the sky and my feet on the ground
Even though we surround by the hate and the slaughter
I'm tryna keep my head up like I'm drowning under water
Caught up on the streets with no shoes on my feet
Kept a smile on my face even when I didn't eat
Kept a dream in my head even when I didn't sleep
And now I feel blessed even when I don't sneeze
Cause I made it out the dark, now I see a lot of gates
Still trying to find Cupid cause I see a lot of hate
See life's just a midget and the sky ain't the limit
So I shoot for the sun like I'm playing for the Phoenix
Despite all these critics and the dreams I am chasing
I'm headed to the north like the Great Migration
Short after all but I'm still standing tall
Got the world on my back and I'm not gonna fall
Um, I'm not gonna fall!

[Hook:K'Naan]

[Verse 2: Keith Wonder]

Stuck in nightmares where the dreams never end
So I'm down on my knees for the tears that they've shed
Makes me want to thank you for the little that I had
Cause I made it out the slums still covered in a rag
782 Mzari Avenue
I wish ya'll knew what this boy been through
I walked every day with my worn out shoes
And I walked every mile just to get to school
It's true it's reality life is never simple
But I gotta keep going keep rolling like a cripple
See I'm here for a reason with my neck brace vision
If hip-hop is a puzzle I'm the last piece missing
Feel it, the pain from the words that I spoke
Man I'm tryna bring change even though I am broke
You can feel my heart like a stethoscope
Understand the microphone is my only last hope

[Hook:K'Naan]
