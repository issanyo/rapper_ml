[VERSE 1]
My tragedy's different
My life's deep, listen
Gotta bail, I'm limpin
Walked outta hell's kitchen
Why bother cherishin'
My past is everything, wrong, and my arrogance
Walk down the stairs pissin'
Cop us cause they're bitchin'
Life isnt fair, singin'
Blues and my rap drippin'
Ooze out the blood Sinkin
Deep down to earth thinking
Leave out a nerp chicken
I should run forfeiting everything I know, Listen!

I was The misdirected
I was The least expected
Hop on And get rejected
Walk on And feel neglected
I feel Like I'm the message
Unheard But I'm the message
I'm the last prolific remaining author from the gutter

Shot was my girlfriend
When we was younger
Her, I was scarred yo
Bullets I survived though
Death It's came easy
Truth the games needs me
Never let them see me down, smile while I'm bleeding

[Hook]
(Smile) When you're struggllin' (Smile) When you're in jail
(Smile) When you dead broke (Smile) And the rent's due
(Smile) You ain't got friends now (Smile) And no one knows you
Never let 'em see you down, smile while you bleedin'

(Smile) When he leaves you (Smile) Cause girl, he needs you
(Smile) Plenty single mothers cry the tears you do
(Smile) Despite the war (Smile) Despite the pain, yo
Never let 'em see you down, smile while you bleedin'

[VERSE 2]

To my man curently in prison
I can't speak your name
It hurt me that you never listened
It can't be the same
I had to grow my intuition had me deep in pain
Cause I knew my options were either broke or the prison chains
I can't do it
I can't see it, look
Damnit, I can't blow it
I got a judge tellin me my lifes key
They will throw it
Nuh-uh, no sir
I plan to have a chauffeur
It seems to me this chopping crack is really going no where
Therefore I'm resurrected They call me
The poor Injection
I infect you with the real
The Dustyfeetphilosahectagos
I spit, so sick I skid out
Im fallin'I'm Shit outta luck and I'm trapped but ill get out
Can you help me, I'm going crazy
My mind plays tricks and I beat on floors like Bushwick
My fists bloody and blistered a pair like im balistic
I just stare at the red and smile while im bleedin

[Hook]

[VERSE 3]
There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer, I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I'd walk with the kids that would bbbrrraaaa a sound, uh
I never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight, I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper, it was often foreseen
Yo, say somethin' bout my momma I'd shoot ya gut out clean
But, uh, ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up in Mogadishu
The only law was gun law, and we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when them big boys is firin'?
War is no place for a child
Especially if he's rollin' with an AK and a smile
He had witnessed his own mother bloody in a towel
But please, please, never let 'em see you down, smile while you bleedin'
