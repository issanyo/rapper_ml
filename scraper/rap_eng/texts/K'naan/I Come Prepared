[Intro]
Set to high
Now calling all revolutionary youth
Dam Marley alongside K'naan
Gunpowder philosopher what some boy feel like...Paper!

[Verse 1]
I made the list this year
I'm honor roll, you ain't know East African rock 'n roll
You don't know what time it is like your clock is old
You ain't know we all packin' like the block is sold
How could it be from the deepest darkest of zero
To become king of New York like De Niro
And he ain't even from New York that's what's weird yo
But where he's from they just ratatatat-ratatatat
So come now don't you try to play the hero
Around here we've got pirates with torpedoes
Alongside all the warlords and beardos
The only city nigga's blacker than tuxedos
Baby girl let me get all up in your earlobe
And if you shut me down you can kill my ego
Which is my enemy makes you my amigo
So either way you and I are button and needle
And they say I might become big as a Beatle
But I don't let it get to my head or feet yo
And I got more street cred than legal
But just in case we keep a big, des-eagle

[Hook]
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared, always
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared, yeah Zion youths
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared

[Verse 2]
What was I on before this flow or sequel?
Somethin' about how I thought I was a Beatle
I'm trippin' but it was something lethal
It was fresh but possessed something Medieval
I came solo I ain't even bring my army
The type of niggas that are always ruining the party
You know those socially inadequate Somalis
Who walk in uninvited and you're VIP
And Africans love them some B.I.G
But 2Pac is official H.N.I.C
And my job is to write just what I see
So a visual stenographer is what I be
Superman, superstar give me super-fat dough
So I can be super-rich and super phat so
But maybe not super fat but super stacked though
So I can fix some money shit on super bad clothes
How many immigrants are in this here sedan
And is anyone carryin' any contraband?
Not really but I'm late for my concert man
And here's a card for my lawyer Mr. Sam Goldman

[Hook]
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared [4X]

(Damian Marley)
So mek a boy know the kalashnikov nuh play type-o
If him feel him have the balance fi a walk tight rope
And a gamble with him life like a casino
And have somebody fi save him like them save Nemo
Cause the Marleys and Somalis are some mad people
We a travel with some long strap in a vehicle
And a screech across the border like a Latino
Moving through the LAX's and London Heathrow
Wait, man a gangsta we no star freak show
No gimmicks nor shenanigans a real street flow
Fi mi women haffi flyer than a Flamingo
Real bullet we a bust and a no Placebo
K'Naan have so much gun him open gun depot
And we take way boy gun just like we a gun repo
So tell some tosse MC there's no more free throw
Soon as we finish a clip another clip reload because

[Hook]
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared [6X]
