You know my closest friend got killed
And the way I used to see him
He was like the dusty foot philosopher
It means the one that's poor
Lives in poverty but lives in a dignified manner
And philosophizes about the universe
They talk about - they talk about
Things that well-read people do and they’ve never read
They've never been on a plane but they can tell you
What's beyond the clouds
And that’s who the dusty foot philosopher is
