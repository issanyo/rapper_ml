[K'Naan: spoken]
I hope you got your passports, and vaccine shots

[Verse 1]
I take rappers on a field trip any day
They never been opposite real clip anyway
I know where all the looters and the shooters stay
Welcome to the city we call Doomsday
When niggas is just fried chicken like Tuesday
Oh you from the hood huh, who say
My Nigerian niggas would call you Pussy
My Somali niggas are quick to grab the uzi
Around here we only bumpin' Fela Kuti
2Pac, or Bob Marley, Lucky Dube
So we don't really give a fuck about your groupies
This Is Africa, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
It means, This Is Africa, hooray

[Refrain x2]
You don't know how hard it is here
The streets is tricky in these parts here
You don't know how hard this is here
The streets need this shit here

[Verse 2]
I walk rappers through the Killa hoods any day
They never been opposite real goons anyway
I know all the tricky sticky icky alley ways
Welcome to the continent of holidays, Africa
Where holidays quickly turn to hell days
Stars fall quicker than box of shell case
No Bill Gates, No PCs
Why you cats debating, acting and faking these days
I deliver what they need like milk crates
I learned from the deadly streets no regrets
And I wasn't ever looking for street cred
But these streets bred me to be street safe
It's no secret we know how to squeeze lead
But the Pre-set is not to have to squeeze it
Used to be at peace but now we using t-shirts
And it reads RIP cause the peace dead
When I walk through the slums like Nomane
Little children say K'naan Bomaye
The rap game just got itself a new day
This is Africa, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
It means, This Is Africa

[Refrain x2]
