Intro K'NAAN
Ever wondered about the hurricane?
Ever seen the anger in the rain, false
I think it's just the world crying for
Asking what the hell we dying for
But here's Lloyd, R. Kelly, miss Keri
And K'NAAN, yo the shit is getting scary

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
They spend up all our money, yeah
On the rockets in the sky, ah, ah
But they don't have a reason
So they generate a lie
To destruct us from the times
There's a hood in every city, yeah
From Compton to Bombay, yeah, yeah
When nobody likes to be there
The system found a way
That made them wanna stay

[Hook: Lloyd]
And I say, ah, da ri rap da ra ra, da ri rap da ra ra
Da ri rap da, yeah
I hate to see the whole world cry
I hate to see the whole world cry
If it was up to me, I would wipe tears from your eyes
I hate to see the world cry

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
We need a plan, anybody please
So sick of this god damn earth
That I wish that I could hitch hike to heaven
And go to god's studio and put in work
Playing down my melodies
Get the whole world one song to sing
Cause hatred's got ourselves a pickle
A love costs 5 cents less than a nickel
I'm talking about one voice, one love, one color
Nobody's rich, nobody's poor
Nobody's less, nobody's more
Nobody's winning, nobody's loosing
No categories, we all music
If we can't come to see
If the whole world needs peace
Then we can touch and agree
That we are the true enemies
And it makes me wanna say

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
I hate to see the whole world cry
I hate to see the whole world cry
If it was up to me, I would wipe tears from your eyes
Cause I hate to see the world cry

Looking in the mirror, seeking inner peace
Every day's constant battle
Between what's wrong and right
I just wanna live my life
My prayer for the future
Is that we learn from our mistakes, oh yeah
Halfway into destruction
But it's not too late
To late to make a change
So I'll say

[Hook: Lloyd, R. Kelly, Keri Hilson, K'NAAN]
Da ra rap da ra ra, da ra rap da ra ra
And I hate to see the whole world cry
I hate to see the world cry
I hate to see the whole world cry
If it was up to me, I would wipe tears from your eyes
I hate to see the world cry
I don't wanna see them cry
Somebody help me understand
Anybody got a plan, whoa, whoa
I hate to see the whole world cry

[Outro: K'NAAN
Streets on fire, burning
Every herd every city is hurting
I will wipe every tear, you shedding
Cause I hate to see the whole world cry
I hate to see the whole world cry
I hate to see the whole world cry
