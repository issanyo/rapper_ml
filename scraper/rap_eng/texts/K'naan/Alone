[Intro: K'naan]
Guitar!
Kick!

[Verse 1: K'naan]]
Slumdog millionaire
The underdog sign when nobody can
Big shows, sick flows
I'm on the road
That's j-j-just how it goes
I think big, I act high
I chop it up in the streets like crack rock

[Hook 1: K'naan]
Got lots of money
But I don't got everything
Got lots of honeys
But I don't got me a queen
Feel like a champ
But I don't got me a ring
Nah mean, nah mean

Yup (the sun goes up)
Yup (the sun goes down)
Yup (and I'm always alone]
Yup (no matter who's around)

[Hook]
The sun goes up (yup)
The sun goes down (yup)
And I'm always alone (yup)
No matter who's around

[Verse 2: will.i.am]]
The fast life, the fast cars
I spend my time with them honeys at the bar
Bank roll, credit cards
Up in the club the DJ know just who I are
A big deal, a big star
Riding big wheels, uh huh!

[Hook 2: will.i.am]
Got lots of money
But I don't got everything
Got lots of honeys
But I don't got me a queen
Buy lots of diamonds
But I don't got me a ring
Nah mean, nah mean

[Hook]
The sun goes up (yup)
The sun goes down (yup)
And I'm always alone (yup)
No matter who's around (yup)
It may be hard to tell (yup)
By looking at my face (yup)
[?] from the party (yup)
And everything will stay (yup)

[Bridge: will.i.am]]
(Yup) Got lots of money
But I don't got everything (yup)
(Yup) Got lots of money
But I don't got everything (yup)
Nah mean, nah mean

(Yup) Got lots of money
(The sun goes up)
But I don't got everything (yup)
(The sun goes down)
(Yup) Got lots of money
(And I'm always alone)
But I don't got everything (yup)
(No matter who's around)
Nah mean, nah mean

[Hook]
The sun goes up (yup)
The sun goes down (yup)
And I'm always alone (yup)
No matter who's around (yup)
It may be hard to tell (yup)
By looking at my face (yup)
[?] from the party (yup)
And everything, and everything, and everything will stay (yup)
