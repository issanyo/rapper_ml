[Verse 1]
Basically, I got beef
I wanna talk to you directly
I can't ignore, I can't escape
And that's cause you affect me
You cripple me, you shackle me
You shatter my whole future in front of me
This energy is killing me
I gotta let it pour like blood, soobax

[Refrain x2]
Nagala soobax, nagala soobax
Dadkii waa dhibtee nagala soobax
Dhibkii waa batee nagla soobax
Dhiigi waad qubtee nagala soobax

[Verse 2]
So for real, who's to blame
We lose lives over Qabiil's name
Disregard for the soul
We just don't give a fuck no more
Left alone, all alone
Settle your issues on your own
What to do, where to go
I got to be a refugee damn, soobax

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Mogadishu used to be
A place where the world would come to see
Jaziira, sugunto liida, wardhiigleey iyo Madiina
Hargeysa, Boosaaso, Baardheere iyo Berbera
My skin needs to feel the sand, the sun
I'm tired of the cold, goddamn soobax

[Refrain]

[Verse 4]
I guess I could use the last bar to flow
I'm known as a lyrical rhyme domino
I'm cynical, well, oh, now you know
Put a whole in an emcee like Cheerio
They don't hear me though
I work for the struggle
I don't work for dough
I mean what I say
I don't do it for show
Somalia needs all gunmen right out the door

[Refrain]
