[Verse 1:]
Pour me a cup of tea like that ol’ song
That I had like that ol’ girl, I was wrong
And it's sad, if I spit I will cuss you
Is that bad? ‘Cause I really did trust you
If the thought ever surfaced to leave you
I would die ‘cause the purpose would be you
You changed for the world, look how you are
You front, grilling me from a dude’s car?
How sudden, let me see, you got a tongue ring?
How funny, we forget about the little things
Say word, now you hang out with big girls
And the guys you date these days differ
I hear the stories and it makes me sicker
My heart aches, you fake like a picture
So close to reality but not quite
So dope, man, her body was so right
She was a high school chic, how would I've known
That our thoughts would conflict like the bible?
I don't offend, I pretend like I'm laughing
Like we connect, like some shit could really happen
And it did, we made a move for this love thing
I met the parents and gave her the round ring
And all of a sudden she got a license to nag me?
What the fuck?! I'm just trying to make you happy!

[Chorus:]
(Sunny days)
Nope, don't have ‘em no more
Whatchu on the phone for?
Don't call me no more

(Sunny days)
Nah, so don't agonize me
I can't stand the stress, see I'm alright without you

(Sunny days)
See I'm far from your reach now
Your body doesn’t tempt me... well, maybe just a little

(Sunny days)
Yea, on the real, like welfare checks
You and I are through... through...

[Verse 2:]
Alright, I'm vexed
Aite, look, I'm tired and stressed
Don't command me like that, cool it
I'll be back, watch Dr. Phil or something
Get yourself straight, you a lil too excited
This ain't your birthday
You might as well be a rapper talking all that shit
What the -- you throwing things? Aite, that's it!
You gon’ fix it! I'm not gon’ scream, not on some bitch shit
Nothing -- but chill -- I'm not calling you a bitch
Just a figure of speech
What's with all these “I hates you’s”? You sound like Kelis
Love, look, you're piercing me with this fierce scream
Seriously, my ears feel like they bleeding tears
And here’s
The head scarf you left in my domain
And here’s
The photos of our memory lane
And there’s
(Nothin for you around here)
You crossed over to the other side of the track
So there's
(Nothing for you around here)
I used to bet on you
But now the bet’s off and you know I got roots
Therefore, my quest love
A brother like me deserves the best of
And you’re not
So... uhmm…

[Chorus]
(Sunny days)
Nope, don't have ‘em no more
Whatchu on the phone for?
Don't call me no more

(Sunny days)
Nah, so don't agonize me
I can't stand the stress, see I'm alright without you

(Sunny days)
See I'm far from your reach now
Your body doesn’t tempt me... well, maybe jus a little

(Sunny days)
Yea, on the real, like welfare checks
You and I are through... through...

(Nothing for you around here)
Nope, don't have em no more
Whatchu on the phone for?
Don't call me no more

(Nothing for you around here)
Naw so don't agonize me
I can't stand the stress
See I'm alright without you

(Nothing for you around here)
See, I'm far from your reach now
Your body doesnt tempt me... well, maybe just a little

(Nothing for you around here)
Yea, on the real, like welfare checks
You and I are through... through...
(Sunny days)
