My God, can you imagine livin' in a ghetto so hard
So facade? This is real oh my God
Can you imagine livin' in a city so fierce
No police better hand than your own, God
Can you imagine this is where the kids don't dance
Growin' up to be roughnecks, my God
Can you imagine this is where we come from, come from, come from, come from
