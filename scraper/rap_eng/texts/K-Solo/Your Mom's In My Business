Yeah! Tell your moms to mind her business

Your mom's in my business, she's in my business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go"

When I first met your moms, I gave your mom respect
But now I see she knows me, I see that she suspects
I'm some bad guy, I don't know why
You have to tell your mother lies about you and I
But when your first told me, she said that I was a no-no
Cause of my haircut and people call me Solo
Before the time you said, you really didn't care
Now you tell me to change my name, or even cut my hair
How would you ever go become somebody's wife
And at the age of 22 you let your mother run your life?
Me, I'm not the type to tell your moms to get lost
Yell out loud to flip and get my point across
See I think you should tell your moms to leave us two alone
And stop reading our love letters and evesdropping on the phone
Cause if you really liked my, you'd let your mommy know
She gotta mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)

Remember your sister and her boyfriend Sam Seed?
Your momma's the real reason why your sister lost her man
Her and sam went together, for a real long time
But Sam controlled her body while your mom controlled her mind
Not saying she was hurt when your moms made 'em break up
Deep down I could tell, though, your sister wanted to make up
With Sam, because she wanted to become his wife
And now she can't do that because your mother runs her life
You baby, you do the same things, too
You always want to to the crazy things your mommy wants you to do
Like when we went to the movie, she had to come along
I went back and forth and forth and back for peanuts and popcorn
She took advantage, cause I was living fat
I couldn't even watch the movie, she kept me running back
For something that she wanted somewhere else in the store
I walked and got it all til the man said there's no more
And when I got back to the car, she took her time to move over
When I sat in the car, my movie was like over
I was mad, hurt, I didn't want to talk
Deep down I wanted you and your mommy both to walk
I took you home anyway, like what the heck
Cause I was raised to treat people's mothers with respect
But when we got to your home, we wasn't left alone
She waited there in the car with us until I headed home
You called me on the phone, saying you were alone
But that's a lie because I heard your moms breathing on the phone
And if you really like me, let your moms know
She should mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)

Without a doubt, me, like when I come to your house
She'll ask me crazy questions and start looking in my mouth
Her friends start laughing and I feel just like a jerk
I told 'em I don't know where my mom and dad work
I really know where they work, but that's between them and me
I can't be putting mom and dad's business in the street
Cause if I told her that my family both work for the state
Right after that she would've asked me how much money do they make
Then she'd go around the town, bragging and boasting
Telling the neighborhood what my family's grossing
Your moms, your moms, why is she so nosey?
She plays me like a game but I'm no ring-around-the-rosey
I even seen your dad at the family barbeque
He said "I don't see nothing wrong with my daugher seeing you"
But it's your wife mister, she don't think that I'm charming
She thinks she's Mr. Whippit and she thinks I'll squeeze her Charmin
I promise I won't do this to your daugher, calm man
Cause when I'm with girls, my reputation is not harming
If I'm not on tour, I'm working out at my house
I'll pick your daugher up sometime, and I'll even take her out
And every time I try to do this, I see without a doubt
Your wife will follow me around like a cop on a stakeout
And when I told the man that, I thought he would help me out
Til he said "I can't tell her nothing, she'll kick me out the house"
See, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls
Mothers love you, and they're concerned
But if you don't solve your own problems, then how can you learn?
And guys, if you're in a relationship like this
Don't be afraid to tell your girlfriend tell your moms to mind her business
But after me and you girl, I'd rather stay Solo
Because your moms can't mind her business, I'm a have to let you go
Because your mom is in my business

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)
