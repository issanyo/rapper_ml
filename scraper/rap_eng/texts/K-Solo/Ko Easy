Ko Easy

Intro

You know life is filled with hustle and bustle
Whether you’re a man or a woman
Or even if you’re a child
We all struggle
It ain’t easy

Chorus

Ko easy lati j’omokunrin
Lati j’omobinrin
Ko easy lati j’omokunrin
Omode tab’obinrin

Verse 1

When I was small I had a crazy urge to grow up
Jealous of Daddy cos he had much to show off
He had cars and a house
Compared to him I was as small as a mouse
Right in the house, but now I really understand the reality
You wanna be a real man? Rara ko easy
I thought effizy would qualify me as a man
No! Microphone is in my hand, lend me your ears
Go to the city, pay for a house to live in
Pay for electricity, get a lady to marry
And raise babies, send them to school
You pay for food and you pay for school
You need a nice car, take care of relatives
What about your poppa, your momma?
Gotta be a man, a husband, a dad, granddad
That’s only one man doing all that

- Chorus - (2ce)


Verse 2

I represent for the women
All my sistas and all ladies
Don’t mind the men won ro pe o easy
For you to carry a baby in your belly
Or to feed the family
Maybe, we need to exchange responsibilities
So men common - carry all the pregnancies
Wahala, scatter-scatter, palava
Don’t think it’s easy for the ladies raising babies
They labour to save us, that’s why we are living
Women are praying for their babies
Men are reading dailies
And the kids busy watching telly
Many things ladies go through, if I mo’ show you

- Chorus -


Verse 3

This is for the kiddies, babies I gotta say this
Ain’t easy to be you too - do you
Know what they be feeling when they be weeping?
They cannot even say how they feel
First they learn to be crawling, before they be walking
Copycat - so they can be talking
They go through nursery, elementary
Crying “mummy mummy, come and save me from the bullies”
And for them no salary, no allawee, no pity
When they fail to pass, we be beating them silly
Life is one bundle of puzzles and many struggles
For everyone, whether old or young
So I’ll be resting my case
Go to Lagos and see the place
Everyone is in haste
In Lagos city, awon agba meta are speaking
They’re warning you pe ko easy
Ko easy!

- Chorus –


Outro

Ladies and gentlemen, and that’s how the story goes
Respect one another
It ain’t easy
We’re all in the struggle
