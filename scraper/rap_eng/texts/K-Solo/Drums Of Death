[Intro]
Drums of death
Drums of death
Drums of death
Drums of death

[Verse 1]
Freeze, my mic please
Rappers down with Solo's lyrics homilies
Quote me in the book of life as one of the baddest
Death's a way of life so welcome to my kingdom of madness
With rhymes I embrace walls of terror
You can only find yourself when you stand in the mirror
And rappers walk away but [?] angel
In my empire [?] make way
The blood is kept for [?]
As rappers kneel to my throne of fire
I'll mangle, strangle rappers at any angle
'Til they disappear like in the Bermuda triangle
No trace of life, gone without a fight
What remains are the drums of death and a mic
In my world he was marked as a burglar
My rhymes killed him so I'm marked as a murderer
Took the mic to death [?] words defy and rappers pray for rap blood
The sacrificial sacrifice, his soul is mine
I break his mic, I say the hell with his rhymes
In the [?] of anger nothin's left
As Solo gets stronger as the drums of death

Drums of death
Drums of death
Drums of death
Drums of death

[Verse 2]
The seven seals [?] prophecy fulfilled
I'm rappin' with an evil spirit [?] killed
MCs notice, try to run, yell, exhale
But now fell, to the clutches of hell
Madness turns you loose and [?]
All in they ears, now yellin' Solo's name
Mercy, is what you say I should give you
But when I grab ya, I hit ya, I'll kill ya when I split ya
Rhymes are sharper than a two-edge sword
[?] God, [?] Solo is Lord
I'm darkness, ever since I started this
I wasn't known as the [?] rap artist
My vocals so different I had to say [?] bring my jam backwards
K-Solo [?] is who I am as I commence with rhymes to take you higher
Rap is burning [?] in the [?] lake of fire
No remorse for rappers of course, they're lost
Biggie Smalls, hang the kid on the cross
"Should we kill him Solo?
(Think we should shoot him?)
Hold him still and Biggies Small execute him

Drums of death
Drums of death
Drums of death
Drums of death

[Verse 3]
As I commence to release a masterpiece
Rappers and old break beats I make 'em feast the flesh
Cooked on a fire for the sire
The flame engaged I rhyme five words higher
Then get a bite from the beast of death
But they should know better the best bet was to step
Those with [?] was the key to the bottomless pit
No light, combine darkness
Rappers with heart, grab a mic and then start this
New way of life for those who might hawk the darkness
With no fear or fright
So don't consume, in other words doom
Locked in a fleet of madness, concealed in a red room
Of murder, punk, chump that's the outcome
Spell murder backwards you get redrum
I pick the [?] 'til none's left
It makes Solo stronger as the drums of death

Drums of death
Drums of death
Drums of death
Drums of death
