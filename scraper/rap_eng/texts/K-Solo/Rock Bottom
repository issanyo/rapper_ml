[K-Solo]
Yeah..
K-Solo back in here for ninety-two
Throwin niggas to the curb

"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."

My microphone's rock heavy and my mic stand's bent
Worser than any soft song cause all my rhymes are made of cement
When I add wise words water with compound
Result's the earthquakes when my mic hits my ground
Vocabulary I wrote, from a stone age
I wrote the concrete rhyme on asphault, and got paid
Bricks and cinder blocks enter my mind fold
Results in words as small as gravel, to hard paved rap roads
I won't forget where I'm from, I thank God for stardom
I'm a hard rock from the rock bottom

"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."

The K's my home, the tune's my room
I sit on a cinder block and watch all my ideas bloom
I'm sittin in my room and I'm thinkin
My world is surface water, and just becaues I'm hard I'm sinkin
If I can live life like a bridge
And remain hard above the water that's the way I'd love to live
I air hard rhymes I might record em, this means
When the bridges come tumblin down now I'm in the water
Like a pebble, a rock, or a brick I can't swim
I bottle this, drown it in my rhythm
I'm from the rock bottom

"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."

My word'sll stick to any beats and mix like cement
My DJ sidewalk scratches will leave potholes in the pavement
Two stones, make as headphones, they hear the cuts
Kill the amp, to make, my mic amplitude stone
My hand holds a boulder, my army of pitbulls
Protect me, the hardrock soldier
Four paws, with locked jaws, GOT EM
"Yo.. yo.. my style's aggressive"
I'm from the rock bottom

"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
K-Solo, is from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
Throwin niggas to the curb, yaknahmsayin?
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
