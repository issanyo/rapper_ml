Tales from the Crack Side

I woke up in the morning on a regular day
I knew my man named R would be around my way
I brushed my hair, my teeth, suddenly I washed my face
Then he came over my house with his drug base
He kept saying if I take one hit of a pipe
I write record to rhyme before the rest of the night
I said, "R, I don't do drugs, or drugs are whack"
"And ain't that base drug like the drug, crack?"
He said "No Solo, see base is legit"
"Girls go for base, and everybody does it"
He left off quick and left me, the base, and the pipe
And I thought I write a record a rhyme before I reach night
I said if that's true, but any case
I couldn't wait to write my record after I smoke the base
He left the crib, I heard the telephone
It was my mom telling me to watch my sister till she gets home
I hung up the phone, with no time to waste
I put my sister in the kitchen so I could smoke the base
It had a funny taste but it didn't taste bad I felt high
That's when I got my pen and pad
I wrote a rhyme that was funky
I broke in a race
'Cause the rhyme that I wrote tried to run off my page
I said, "Stop rhyme"
Then I grabbed the knife and cut the rhyme
That I've seen running in my sight
I got in mind was happy when I thought the rhyme was dead
Till he swung and caught me square in the head
I fell on my floor and
The rhyme grabbed the knife
And cut my little sister
I thought it took her life
She fell on the floor, blood covered the rug
The rhyme was laughing to my surprise, I knew something was bugged
I got on the phone to call the cops, "What should I do?"
You'd did the same thing if you was in my shoes
As I started talking I seen the rhyme run by
And hit me with a can of ravioli in my eye
I fell on the floor, look, and when my vision cleared
I looked around the house and see the rhyme disappeared
I started to cry I said, "Oh, what would my mom say?"
That's when I heard a car pull up into the driveway
She came in the house, she took a look at the place
See my sister still bleeding, the knife and the base
She said, "You cut your sister while you were smoking that shit"
I said, "Mom, I didn't cut 'er, the rhyme did it"
I knew this was the truth, mom thought it was a lie
Some of y'all might even think it's just a Tale from the Crack Side

A Tale from the Crack Side
A Tale from the Crack Side

Mom was crying, she went in shock
Got on the phone, and then she started crying to the cops
So I ran out the door, and I look for
The rhyme that cut my sister, who bled on my floor
I got in the yard, went out, ran out in the street
I had to duck behind some trees 'cause I seen the police
When they ran in my house and shut up the block
I see my girlfriend coming to my house, and my jaw dropped
I said, "Baby stop," but yo, she kept on walking
I knew pretty soon the cops would be hawking
I never knew the trouble I was really headed for
Till the rhyme appeared again dressed as Santa Claus
He said, "Ho ho ho, baby you look great"
And told me dead on my face my girl was gonna get raped
Me watching this whole thing, it was blowing my mind
'Cause my girl was getting raped by this musical rhyme
He was sliding into fast my girl cried for help
I grabbed a stick, you know and Solo went for self
I hit the rhyme in the head and seen him drop
But then the rhyme disappeared and all I seen was cops
They were coming for me fast I couldn't escape
Beside my girl was on the ground butt-naked yelling rape
One cop gave 'er a coat and said "Miss, are you alright?"
Another cop said, "That's the kid that cut his sister with the knife"
I told them my name, I tried to explain
They heard the side of my story
They said "Boy, you insane. You raped this girl too, come on and just admit it"
I said, "Man, I didn't rape 'er, the rhyme did it"
I knew this was the truth but cops thought it was a lie
Some of y'all might even think it's just a Tale from the Crack Side

A Tale from the Crack Side
A Tale from the Crack Side
Tale from the Crack Side

The cops tried to catch me, so I ran like hell
I needed someone to talk to, someone to tell
'Cause all these things were happening, they were blowing my mind
See, I knew I didn't do this, I knew it was a rhyme
But who would believe me in any high state of mind
If they ask me who did it, and I say it was a rhyme
The cops didn't buy it, this is why I'm being chased
And my moms told the cops that I was high on base
I'm running, I'm sweating
I suddenly knew that I had to get to P's house as fast as I can, so
I shoot up this corner, run up another block
Looked over my shoulder, and seen I lost the cops then
I run to his door, bang like I break it in two
He said "Solo, hey man, the cops are looking for you"
I said, "Thanks to you, the base, and that pipe"
"I wrote a rhyme high last night and the rhyme came to life"
He started to laugh, he said "Yeah, right!"
I said, "It raped my girl on the block and cut my sister with a knife"
He started laughing, he thought it was a joke
He said, "Yo Solo, you had a little too much to smoke"
I grabbed him in the yoke, we started fighting on the floor
Suddenly that's when I heard some noise that was coming from the door
Two conclusions enter my mind, I said
"Could it be the cops or the rhyme?"
But before when I told 'em my man paid me no mind
And when the door opened up, in came the rhyme
With a hammer in his hand he tried to hit me in my head
I ducked, but the hammer hit P instead
I started buggin' then, I said, "This must be a nightmare"
He was screaming on the floor and there was blood everywhere
I got on the phone, called the cops
He went in shock
And when I hung up the phone, cops was on the block
I stuck my head out the door, said, "Help me, the rhyme is in here"
But then he dropped the hammer, again he disappeared
The cops kept asking me how did he get hit
I kept trying to tell the cops "Yo, the rhyme did it"
They didn't buy it, they said "Boy, you're bug"
"You can save that rhyme story for the lawyer or the judge"
I get there the D.A. and judge still wouldn't listen
They gave me fifteen to twenty-five years in prison
They take me somewhere, far upstate
For attempted murder, assault two, and rape
My family won't talk to me, my friends won't see me
My girl now hates me, and she don't wanna marry me
Cause when this all dawned on me
It wasn't a rhyme it was just basehead me
So I tell kids and adults in this place
This can happen to y'all if ya smoke crack or base
So do yourself a favor stay away from this
Or you'll be in jail like I was, yelling the rhyme did it
No one will believe you, they'll think you're telling a lie
And your life will become another Tale from the Crack Side

Tale from the Crack Side
Tale from the Crack Side
Tale from the Crack Side
