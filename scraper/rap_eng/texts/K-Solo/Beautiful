[Prod. by K-Solo]

[Verse 1]
It's crazy how she take me back to feelin' like I'm back in high school
Livin' reckless, livin' like I live by my rules
How can I change? the last few flames burnt out
And the last one look how it turned out, I said forget it
Love is just a myth to me
A group of friends travelin' in a van with a dog can't solve this kind of mystery
Look at how she entered, B
She entered when I thought I closed the door to my heart and threw away the key
And that's major, I finally discovered my savior
And He repaid me with the love of my life, thank the creator
For creating her, how can I rejoice my appreciation?
By having her enjoy me take over the nation
She take me so high in her space ship
And all I'm thinkin' bout is how did I get in her Matrix?
How did I find her when I had nothing?
If I'm ignorant at least I know one thing
I'ma take care of her and do this thing different
Disregard everything that happened with past women
Exes change, but so can I
She's down to Earth, but she so damn fly

If I called you beautiful would you believe me?
If I was miles away would you try to see me?
If I told you my secrets would you deceive me?
I'm really into you I wanna see where we could go
Never tell 'em our business, ain't nothin' people need to know
When I put you on that stage then I'm ready for the show
There's somethin' I just need to know
I'm really into you I wanna see where we could go
Never tell 'em our business, ain't nothin' people need to know
When I put you on that stage then I'm ready for the show
There's somethin' I just need to know

[verse 2]
I wanna know if you ready to face the hard times
I ain't perfect there may be times we argue all night
But you it's on sight, I'm ready for whatever
Cause the way you got me feelin', this ain't every day weather
Cause you brighten up my day with a text
Saw your smile, got lost in it, no stress
We can tell secrets, we can talk about our exes
Tell me bout the things that he did, was he offensive? Were you defensive?
Did he make excuses? those are expensive
Lookin' for your value and I found it like detectives
You are priceless, and I see that
Bring it right here mami I need that, believe that
I look in your eyes and I see what you could be
You look in my eyes and we swear it's a movie
Never thought that I would feel this way again
I swear your heart will never break again
Real talk

*Beat Slows Down*
{Ahh man

You know what happened the last time
You really might just commit to this girl
Don't say I ain't warn you}
