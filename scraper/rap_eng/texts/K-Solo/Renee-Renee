[Intro]
Renee-Renee
Renee-Renee, still givin' your body away
Renee-Renee
Renee-Renee, still givin' your body away

[Verse 1]
Theres this girl I met around my way
Like soon the black cat, and ya honey was Renee
She suckin' and she fuck 7 days of the week
The posse dog Renee me, I really shouldn't speak
But anyway, I finally put my voice on display
I told the world about this girl I know, her name's Renee
And if I seen her now, you know what I'd say?
Renee-Renee-Renee still givin' your body away
Now break the beat down

[Hook]
Hey Renee, you're dreamin' again
You spread your legs for every guy, horny boy or man
You're not the booty princess with the fabulous butt
You're plain old Renee, the fast ass slut

[Verse 2]
It started off when Renee was 8
When nighty touch, no food upon a dinner plate
I guess because this night was a real special night
They say her momma was meetin'
Her horny boyfriend named Mike
Renee ran in the closet and waited that night
While her moms ran upstairs to make her room look nice
When Mike came in the room, to give her moms a kiss
She saw what Mike was touching and Renee, she almost shit
He touched yo moms ass, then he rubbed her tits
And that's what got Renee's little young hot ass lit
The spit rolled down from one side of her mouth
He took her mom in no position, bang
Make her scream and shout when he was finished
After sex, Mike laid back
Her moms ran downstairs to fix her man a snack
Renee watched Mike as he laid upon the bed
She snuck out of the closet and she gave Mike head
It was due time before her moms came back
She made Mike come in like 4 seconds flat
And when her moms came back with Mikes snack
Renee ran back in the closet and damn, that was that
Mike wanted her to come back, she wish she could
'Cause she's a modern day suckin' dick Robin Hood
I really wish she'd stop givin' her body away
Before somebody mess around and
Give this girl Renee the AIDS
And if I seen her now, you know what I'd say?
Renee-Renee-Renee still givin' your body away
Now break the beat down

[Hook]
Hey Renee, you're dreamin' again
You spread your legs for every guy, horny boy or man
You're not the booty princess with the fabulous butt
You're plain old Renee, the fast ass slut

[Verse 3]
Renee, she had a sister, who was the opposite
She wasn't no hoe or slut, now people, bust this
She had a boyfriend, but some say she liked a lot though
His name is not important but he used to be a jock
He had dreams of what he might do
Like turn pro so he can make a buck or two
Renee knew that her sister would be doin' fine
So she had a plot and started wearin'
Tight things on her behind
In a week, her and her man broke up
And Renee was goin' with him, now ain't that fucked?
What can they say, Renee got us paid
And all I wanna know is what will her mother say
Nothin' that she's sick to
And what she pulled on your sister
I hope she pulls on you
To tell you the truth, you're just like her
Nothin' like your father
Same shirt, same damn ring around her collar
That's shady, slut lady, then have a baby
Buy a man, and then say it was another man's maybe
And what I wanna know is how he could grab
One sister, take another, bang, and make a baby
That's sick, in god's eyes
And if that was my sister, I'd punch her in her eye
And then I hear R-E-N-E-E, told M-O-E
K-S-O-L-O was an L-O-V-E
K-S-O-L-O then told M-O-E R-E-N-E-E is an S-L-U-T
I've seen a P-A-R-T-Y with her boyfriend
Named H-E-R-B-Y, I said it's G-O
She said N-O, So I said S-O
'Cause she's an H-O
I wouldn't waste my T-I-M-E
R-E-N-E-E ain't M-I-N-E
And if you know a girl like Renee
Tell the pretty fly cutie
To stop givin' her body away

[Hook]
Hey Renee, you're dreamin' again
You spread your legs for every guy, horny boy or man
You're not the booty princess with the fabulous butt
You're plain old Renee, the fast ass slut
Hey Renee, you're dreamin' again
You spread your legs for every guy, horny boy or man
You're not the booty princess with the fabulous butt
You're plain old Renee, the fast ass slut

[Outro]
Hey Renee-Renee, still givin' your body away
Hey Renee-Renee, still givin' your body away
Renee-Renee, still givin' your body away
Hey Renee-Renee, still givin' your body away
