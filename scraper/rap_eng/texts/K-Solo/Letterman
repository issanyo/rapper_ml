"Now let me tell you who I am" -] Kane

[K-Solo]
I was in my room writing rhymes I H-A-D had
Next to my room was a laboratory run by my D-A-D dad
He was a professor, and I'm his S-O-N
So my life as a professor had just begun, my name is
K-E-V-I-N-M-A-D-I-S-O-N run the experiment I qualify
And become a good professor in medicine
I ran out my door, and I looked for
A breakbeat, spelling book, and grabbed my dog, "Woof!"
Rhymes that I had, every muscle from his body
The combination of that will give me strength, to rock a party
I thought that I might, get H-U-R-T hurt
If I used dad's melachalonin machine that was known to convert
No manual that I could find on dad's machine
I hit a button and this rumor turned the laboratory green
Some hairs was from my dog and a pair from mine
Hit the switch I spelled a rhyme the chromosome, will mix with mine
This uncanny combination will let the world understand
Professor Kevin Madison changed to the incredible Letterman!

My M-O-M-S stole my P-O-P-S, the son named K-S-O-L-O
Be B-L-E-S, S-E-D
Blessed this brand new hard rap, H-I-T-S
S-P-E-L-L, my style B-O-U-N-D
My sister C-O-O-K-I-E
Told my sister T-H-E-R-E-Z-E
That I can get P-A-I-D, in a N.W.A. wild way
Then told my sister S-E-L-I-N-A
Now my whole family's H-A-P-P-Y
Cause Solo's makin all others M-O-N-E-Y
I W-R-I-T-E, to keep the weak emcees
Wishin they could all B-I-T-E the M-U-S-I-C
A plan that's G-A-Y to me
My R-A-P flows and rhymes I kick, a G-R-A-N-D grand
Cause no one spells rhymes like Letterman!
