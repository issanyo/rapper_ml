[Intro]
Allah bless the messenger
I'm the messenger
Allah bless the messenger
I'm the messenger
Allah bless the messenger
I'm the messenger
Allah bless the messenger

[Verse 1]
I'm the messenger, from one muslim empire
I'm here to let you know what Allah requires from
You black people, all, the holy quaran
Is the source of islamic lore
Fightin' and drug sellin', black people need to stop it
Allah's god and Muhammed is the prophet
I can go on and on and on
'Cause I pray towards Mecca, and my word is born
Tears roll from more black people's eyes
Leaders we need now, have already died
Like Malcom X, Martin Luther, Marcus Garvey, they're all gone
So we should listen to the big brother Farrakhan
He's a teacher, not a preacher, not a man like Jimmy Baker
Who turned out to be a preacher
He's better known as someone's devil eye
I hold fast to the world of Allah, and be a rebel
How can I go to war and pull a trigger
When a man I'm tryin' to free is still callin' me a nigga
If not out loud, they all say it and it's mine
By puttin' me and my brother on an enemy line
Then, with armored guns and told to kill others
When Allah said don't lift your arms to your brother
So ride with us as we trust the wrong man
Like in the USA, we still get hung by the Klan
My people fought in every war America had, and still
We don't have a black stripe on the flag, so
I ask brothers and sisters like you
What does the red, white, and blue flag stand for you?
Blue for the war that brought you
White star for the white men that fought you
The other white stripes, to make you see and understand
The red on the flag represents blood of a black man
I'm the messenger

[Hook]
(Allah bless the messenger) I'm the messenger
(Allah bless the messenger) I'm the messenger
(Allah bless the messenger) I'm the messenger

[Verse 2]
I get tired of fittin' the brick wall
Why does the black man always have to take the fall?
And be sent to the back of the line
And always thought of a slave in another man's mind
It's a waste of time for me to try to explain
Can another man feel the black man's pain?
No way, 'cause if it was they'd bleed and die
The average american would just walk by
We gotta get strong, motherly and help
And try to save our black race, 'cause we owe it to ourself
When god comes back to this world, he'll be a man
And he'll be spit at and kicked at, 'cause he's a black man
You can feed his world grass and hail or water
Your god is black, also original
But in the land controlled by another man
You were programmed to think that Jesus was a white man
This is a lie many tell in America
Jesus Christ was born right by Africa
And I sit back, and wait 'til he comes back
And watch the people laugh when they see god's black
I'm the messenger

[Hook]
(Allah bless the messenger) I'm the messenger
I'm the messenger
(Allah bless the messenger) I'm the messenger

[Verse 3]
The Klan knows that god's black too, but they can't flaunt it
So they burn a cross 'cause jesus died on it
While you behave is a degree of a kill
'Cause of them, so many of my black people stand still
One cop cluck hits the black man's head
Some say the black man resist it, but why is my brother dead?
United we stand, together we fall
Stop sellin' us drugs, 'cause that's whats killin' us all
When we sold drugs in our black community
Right there broke a very black man's unity
Some there with the white man wanted them to do
They got my mind on drugs, now the cop wants you
For sellin' the drugs, 'cause it serves you well
'Cause I'm locked in a rehab, and you're locked in jail
Or watch by the man who works for the Klan
Who hates the black man, but here goes the plan
You stop sellin', and I'll stop yellin'
And if you know another drug dealer, you start tellin' him
The same thing that I told you
For this is the only way the black dream can come true
Put your fists in the air, scream "Black Power"
We the opressed people, the wait, the final hour
As I salot, my body towards Mecca
And pray, that Allah will bless the messenger

[Outro]
(Allah bless the messenger) I'm the messenger
I'm the messenger
(Allah bless the messenger) I'm the messenger
I'm the messenger
(Allah bless the messenger) I'm the messenger
I'm the messenger
Nelson Mandela, peace
(Allah bless the messenger)
(Allah bless the messenger)
(Allah bless the messenger)
(Allah bless the messenger)
(Allah bless the messenger)
(Allah bless the messenger)
