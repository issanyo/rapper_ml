[Verse 1]
When I first started, making records
They said I'd never do it
I knew I could, but me, I had to prove it to myself
So as I grab the mic on the shelf
I got some help from P and E, and Solo went for sell
Now it starts, so many rappers scream my name out loud
Suckers used to diss me, oh how they love me now
I used to want to cry, they used to diss me like
Friends, girls, even some family members
Would say I would never get off the ground
Now they tell the world my name as I hear my jam Spellbound
Some yell, "Oh, did you hear the new Solo's?
New record was playing on the radio rap show?"
Some that know me, say "Nah, it can't be so"
For the record Kevin Madison, is K-Solo
I worked hard for so long, but people used to tell me
"No one wants to hear your song", though I spoke
And wrote, until I couldn't anymore
Kept rappin' and rhymin' til' my voice got soft
Then it happened, one day I finally seen I got paid
Entertainin' large crowds with the mic on stage
But what bugs me out about suckers who used to diss me
'Cause now I'm makin' records, and everybody knows me

[Bridge]
Now everybody knows me
Now everybody knows me

[Verse 2]
When I went to school, you know I played it cool
I never played sports and I was no teacher's fool
I like this girl a lot 'cause I thought she had charm
But she told me one day, I couldn't take her to the prom
Her moms and dads said I wasn't her daughter's type
It really hurt my feelings black, and got me uptight
Said to myself, why are they treatin' me this way?
Then I got fed up, and Solo said one day
I'll make it with my music, you'll wait and you'll see
You'll be in line, with tickets, waitin' to see me
Preform, all night long as I go through
Song after song after song til' you see that I'm gone
You tell your friends now, K's big now
You like the way you're rappin', entertain the crowd
And you were impressed by the way that I dressed and all
Glitter on my fingers, and chains on my neck
Get off me, girls stop ridin' me
In other words, don't even flip and talk about me
You didn't do it then, so why do it now?
See you yellin' my name, when you see my rock the crowd
And be the girl that gotta get this, pointed at the door
By the bodygaurd, the door where we exit
I can't be with it, I ain't stupid, I had one girlfriend before
But now my best friend is cupid
I ain't goin' for it, so stop callin' me, honey
And tell my so-called friends I ain't got no money
It's tied up, some are locked in a bend
Yo Key, where is everybody goin'? Thanks
For lettin' me know that you're those kind of friends
Who want to hang on when I'm fat, but when I was thin
You weren't around, nowhere to be round
You were with your other crew and posse
On the other side of town
Now you flip and want an autograph from me, see
You used to diss me, now everybody knows me

[Bridge]
Now everybody knows me
Now everybody knows me

[Verse 3]
When I was just a young kid, and I wanted to rap
I got down with this group, who got put on the map
For bein' I was so young, and they were so old
They used to say that I was crazy and a little bit too bold
But I always listened to the group I thank for gettin' down
I even got my man named Jerry J and put him down
But they were jealous, they didn't want me to be the star
They kicked me out the group, and named the group
They would cheese me all the time and say "Solo"
"Did you hear our record without you on the radio?"
I was hurt, what could I say or do, when my best friend
Jerry J betrayed me and stayed with the group
My mom said "Son, you'll make it and you'll see
They'll get nowehere fast, 'cause god don't like ug-uly"
I prayed, and kept my fate crossed
And heard Tommy Boy, had cut this group off
I wasn't happy to hear that, but that goes to show
It happened to them, because they probably dissed Solo
And if they're listenin' to somewhere around me
Fellas, y'all used to diss me, now everybody knows me
There was another in the group besides me
He left, his name was Parrish, from EPMD
Some got pissed 'cause Parrish got paid
And his records went gold in like 30 days
But I wasn't jealous, and I was still gettin' down
His path crossed mine, and Pete put me down
And now I'm makin' records, I mean G's
See? Everybody knows me

[Bridge]
Now everybody knows me
Now everybody knows me
Now everybody knows me

[Outro]
Albee in effect, word up
To the posse and EPMD
My money's all tied up, now ev- now everbody knows me
My money's all tied up, now ev- now everbody knows me
"Yo Solo man, where you goin', man? You're Solo! What's up man?"
Yo, get outta my face, man, or i'll punch you in the artery
It's like that "Aw, it's out!"
My, my, my-my-my-my-my money's all tied up, everybody knows me
My-my-my money's all tied up, everybody knows me
My money's all tied up, everybody knows me
Everybody knows me "Nobody knew you before"
Get the mack all mazed, word up
Everybody knows me
