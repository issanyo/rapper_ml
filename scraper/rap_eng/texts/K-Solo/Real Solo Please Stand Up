[Verse 1]
My style's aggressive like a pitbull terrier
Harder the sounds on wax, the more the merrier
Maestro, release this beat for me
See when I rhyme, I rig up bits and get paid easily
So gather 'round, listen to the flow
So I can prove, I'm the true Solo
MC's grab my name and bit it poorly
Put it behind the name and ate it up like ravioli
OK, so I heard it with Red Alert and Chuck
A rapper said he went solo, I said "What The...?"
My man came over and said "Yeah, we heard you"
Choke, son, you heard a bitin' ass crew
Some bit my name, I want it back
It's a fact, P, tell 'em (Get The Bozack)
On the record, who do I stand for?
A rapper on the stage who gets one single applause
Give me a break, my brother, my name stands for Kevin
Self, Organization Left Others
My name's no game for those who claim to use
My name in vein, 'cause their name sounds plain
I remain the flame, should my flow change
No, the name of the game, Solo will explain
I don't know which way, rappers ran or came
I know the vein and I hate the name
Shame, playin' a game, they're jokin' the same
They walk around puddles, knowin' the reign
With the cane, nothin' to gain
Shame, fast flows, and rhymes for Solo
Will get a rapper tame
The pain of no fame, no title to gain
Nobody but the real Solo to blame
Fake Solo's and weak Solo's, shut the hell up
And let the real solo stand up

[Verse 2]
PMD got a call from Alvin, they yell
"Solo, they're puttin' your name on other rapper's albums"
I said "No Joke", but your manager tells them
They put Solo on the record so all labels can sell 'em
People buy it, 'cause they're not it
They get the record and find out, the Solo ain't me
Some get mad, bringin' the record back
Yellin' "That ain't the real Solo, I want my money back!"
He gives you the dough, you step to another row
Seein' a whole bunch of albums now that say "Solo"
Now you ask the man "Who's the real Solo?"
He sees so many fake ones, he just don't know
He offers you then suddenly stops, and points
"That's the real Solo!" 'cause K marks the spot
Put my jam to theirs and it won't sound the same
The weak wick wack MC's say my name in vein
To say my name in vein is like a swear
I get ya at a party, catch you out there
Fake Solo's and weak Solo's, shut the hell up
And let the real solo stand up

[Verse 3]
Under pressure, some fess, 'cause rappers are less
And not a fat sex shakin' in a dress
Regress, while I flex for the press
They had rest, and played battles on stress
Some need a rest, some gonna agress
Solo's the best, put on a new rap prospect
What the heck, I'll deck or peck, or make wreck
Any rapper, who don't come correct
To me the fake Solo is an ornament hung on a wall
Shot a killed, a trohpy in a tournament
Yet still some rappers still front and act hard
Put deep down, they know they fall against their own odds
Rap is like them, I love to destroy
And rub their face in the dirt like a Tonka truck toy
Fake Solo's and weak Solo's, shut the hell up
And let the real solo stand up

[Outro]
19-9-O, EPMD cold in effect, K-Solo
See ya wither, wither
