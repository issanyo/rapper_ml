I'm rockin' for the hometown
C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for the hometown
C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for my hometown
C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for the hometown

I'm from C-I L-I F-L-Y
Like a B-I-R-D in the S-K-Y
Don't T-R-Y to be [?]
These L-I-N-Es belong to M-I-N-E
I'm make and they take, some rappers imitateâ€‹
OK, my rhymes make parties sway
People, I won't take any kind of losses
I battle rappers and I use all resources
Like household utensils, kitchen sinks
Some will get bust so they can think or blink of any way to destroy me
Try to unemploy me, I can't let no one stop me, I'm runnin' for the
Championship, rappin' ain't no game
After N-K, Solo will retake what was mine, is mine, will stay mine
And it's that way because my beat and my rhyme
Are from Long Island, but in this society
I never find a rapper who can stand by me
Where's the formula that makes Solo?
A-X plus the B-Y plus C is zero
I need nobody, I use no persuasion
The X and Y will satisfy my equation
I'm gonna tell 'em that the new king has risen
It's time for y'all to make an independent decision
I hear rappers of the world with self-taught talent
Who get smacked with beats and lose composure and balance
When I rhyme I eat more bass and [?] like a fiend
I keep my balance (how?) like I'm rhymin' on a balance beam
So when you fall down, stay down, low down
K-Solo is just rockin' for his hometown

C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for the hometown
C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for my hometown
C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for the hometown
C-I, C-I
And that's my hometown

I'm not new to this but this is my first jam
And I'll be damned if I let a rapper take command
Of my show, I know, he can't get my flow
Yo, this style is made for the Solo
My moms used to tell me that I'd be a broadcaster
I said I'm Solo Mom and I rhyme much faster
They're runnin' hot 'cause they scared like
Solo, chasing Freddy in his worst nightmare
Holdin' the mic tight, 'cause when it's time to recite
I say things to make a rapper wanna fight
But when I'm rockin', I'm shockin' never fallin' offbeat
Makin' sure profits in my pocket will increase
No time for assumptions (what) or malfunctions (kick it)
We know this jam's not a [?] production
Beats equipped, words and rhymes fit
I change the tide while Biggie Smalls gets with the movement

Yo Biggie Smalls?
What's up?
Yo, everything cool on the flex?
Yeah
Cool man, 'cause I'm gonna rip this
Do that

Get with my movement, my rap and flow is like a wheel hit
Remember Solo and all my rap achievements
My rhyme's a source, some get lost
They throw the mic against brick walls and turn and toss
I race 'em, chase 'em, catch 'em and bass 'em
Smack 'em in the face like my girl outta place and
Hit 'em wit a rhyme watch a rapper drop
The man left a Nabisco in the Oreo box
I entertain with gangsters, who take off all
The bodyguard's Bogard, the DJ's Biggie Smalls
We went with the flow, while I cranked up the sound
Tonight I dedicate this jam to my hometown

C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for my hometown
C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for the hometown
C-I, C-I
I'm rockin' for my hometown
C-I, C-I
And that's my hometown

C-I, Central Islip word up
[?] coolin' with EPMD, K-Solo in effect
Brentwood, New York, yo we in here
I'm rockin' for my hometown

[scratch and cut]
C-I, C-I
