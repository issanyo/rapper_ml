[Intro]
MCs, grab a mic, stand on the white line
When the man shoots the gun instead of run I rhyme
Go off!

[Verse 1]
Out of the speed blocks here I go
I can't flow slow, the fast flow's made for Solo
Rappers who race me on rhymes always stand there shocked
Where they start is the same place punks stop
Out of breath, ask yourself who's next
So many rappers see me now they don't, punks are left
Dust falls in their eyes and then causes tears
I increase speed by hitting one flow gear
You're in the rear, way back there I can't see your face
But if I did I'd bet I'd read fear
All was erased, it's now a chase
Tryin' to replace and chase Solo but I'm in first place
And it's a race, 'cause I'm one speed master
My rhymes progress as Solo gets faster

[Bridge]
Now make it funky
Now make it funky
Now make it funky
Now make it funky

[Verse 2]
Move or you'll get hit with the groove
The fact that speed and Solo is here to prove
Rappers that can't begun to move their tongue
Faster and faster with rhymes better run
Around the track 'til rap time's finished
For I diminish and finish and kick a hundred words a minute
It's my chance to blast past and grab his ass
Who sits in a body cast, for sho gonna ask
I laugh, he couldn't last, and almost crashed
And ran outta gas and got a kick in his ass
As I passed him up (word up) he got hurt up
Smacked like a bitch and I'ma lift his skirt up
Now in the race, who'd ya pull
Pull up on a breath in the pit-stop, coo,l no fuel
For you and the crew so I run through
A speed-racer rhyme, quicker than a mind
Indeed I take lead when I MC
I spell it different, S-P-E-E-D see
You like to chill and pause for a stop sign
I chill for a second and hit you with another rhyme
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
'Til the beat's gone!
I can stop at any time
'Til the rhyme I choose to race hits the finish line
Now ask the man, the winner of the rap speed show
"Winner is K-S-O-L-O"

[Outro]
Now make it funky
Now make it funky
Now make it funky
Now make it funky
Now make it funky
