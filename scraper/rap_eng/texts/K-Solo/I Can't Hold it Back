[K-Solo] Break it down!
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Yeah!
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Lies and rumors, rumors and lies
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Lies and rumors, rumors and lies
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)

Verse One: K-Solo

Who's spreadin all the rumors, who's tellin all the lies?
Solo fell off? You must be drinkin St. Ide's
I'm back in effect on my second cassette
Check the untouched rep, scarin emcees like a bomb threat
Rumors and lies, at the same time try to destroy my name
Is this the price for fame?
If people got money, for rumors and talk
They'd have a lot of millionaires livin here in New York
Three number one hits, should kill the negative vibe
Solo's name and fame could never be denied
It's got me trapped in a corner and I wanna attack
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Two: K-Solo

I wrote 'Spellbound', to put my face on the map
But rumors have it that another man laid in jail wrote
That's impossible, Kevin Madison will take a stand
If he wrote 'Spellbound', who the hell wrote 'Letterman'?
Mission to make the non-believers there become a witness
When I release the hit, "Tell your moms ta mind her bizness"
It went number two, not far from number one
While the fugitive ran, I came back, to get the job done
Now they wanna tell lies, and take credit from a great
Hard working Solo artist, but this'll set em straight
I came back for ninety-two on a Sam Sneed track
I tried to hold it all in, but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Three: K-Solo

Cops won't arrest me, before, but now I'm on a tour
So what they knockin at my mother's door for?
The cash made I received, the money I was worth
But Solo couldn't change, cause I was taught first
To remember who you are, and where you come from
It won't be hard for you to become, number one
I don't like crowds around me ever, only a true friend
Can become an enemy so I stay Solo forever
I like it that way, but I hate when people say
Put me down on their record, so I can get paid
If I bring crews and other emcees on stage
And help everybody else, I never stay paid
So I write rhymes for Solo, and help myself
So when I get there, I can give another brother help
Kevin Solo demonstration left others and that's that
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Four: K-Solo

Now I got a new album, and a tape and a CD
And those who thought I fell off were really surprised to see
K-S-O-L-O throwin down and all the rumors
And the lies that they were spreadin couldn't keep me down!
Back out my face, keep my name out your mouth
This record got your cornered and there's no way out
Solo killed all the rumors cause I had to attack
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo...)
