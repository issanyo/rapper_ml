Y'already know
Look...Dale

[Verse 1]
Pana ya tu sabes dámelo un momento
‘Cause when we slide through, manito, puro silencio
La gente preguntó cada día "de donde eres?"
I share my testimony and validate my credentials
A first-gen Caribbean, Kingston weh Mitzy bon
Bridgeport, Connecticut, mi rep mi city mon
Graduate from Columbia but mi nuh brilliant
Misión en Colombia then saw the Kingdom come
And now we movin’ for the future and ahorita
Pillo ya te dije que we gotta go pa'rriba
Holy oil with the heat, papa frita
Preachin’ that good with my bad mamacita
Ridin’ down the malecón lookin’ for conversation
For those that's observatin’ it look like confrontation
Some type of altercation or deadly combination
But we just callin' out for all the nations

D'accord

[Verse 2]
Mon frère déjà tu le sais how we do this thang
Tous du monde is for who we pray, ain't no voodoo mane
Lawd mi a wonda wah do dem, we been through this mane
One blood this ain't suwu gang
Call me Ace or ragamuffin troublemaker hooligan
Any foolish thang
It don't really matter who you think I be truth-fully
Followin’ them rules is super lame, ain't abusin’ me
Come at me with truth, encore, can't rebuke a thing
Rendezvous at the center with my bredren in the winter
With no coat and it's December ready know that once its dinner
We gon’ pray for new beginnings ‘cause when January come around
Who knows what we'll be in?
I just be caught up in the wind
Wish it was August once again
Getting’ called up by my friends, hear “happy born day” from my kin
All across the globe I bonded in the heart widdi wole a dem
Havin’ thoughts that I won't see them ‘cause I'll get shot up for my skin, ay
