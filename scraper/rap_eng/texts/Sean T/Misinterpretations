[Verse 1: Call Me Ace]
I remember back when they called me a "genius"
Overconfident disobedience as my outfit, what you would see me in
Readin’ up on Nietzsche freakin’ out: “If all is meaningless
Why we livin’ and dreamin’ then? Why care ‘bout if I breathe again?”
Bust it then, done with the studyin’, volcano bubblin’
Hoverin’ high on the government's dime
I fumbled in crime, real minuscule, but I ducked out in time
Lost numerous brain cells, still a wonderful mind ‘cause I wonder
How many lives I ruined foolin’ with me
Too many ghouls in the night, I think they booin’ at me
All these memories, can't erase ‘em, they're glued to the roots
When I shaved off my hair they were still there coolin', my g
Under my skin I'm filthy, bred, I know I'm guilty
Devil came to sift me, thankfully another presence came to steal me
Bredren I hope you feel me!
I’m finna rep Jesus Christ until they kill me! Hold up
My life changed but I'm still me
No matter how much I beg for forgiveness, won't change the consequences
Every night I slept grievin’, God, not even I accept me
“Just don't go back down that road, that's what they call ‘repentance’”
When I did it I meant it, some relationships severed
Some were broken get mended, some I'll never forget ‘em
Even though they forgot me, would rather live without me
But wanna know somethin’ ‘bout me? Not even that will stop me

[Hook: Call Me Ace]
I been called to make a statement
Whether or not they end up lovin’ it or hate me, ay
I won't stop, no that ain't me
I’m on a new path, I can't leave, ya feel me?
Got a goal that I'm runnin’ towards, only determination
Come tread closely and don't fall on misinterpretations
Ay, ay

[Verse 2: Call Me Ace]
Nowadays picture me California sushi rollin’
Truth be told my homies hold the sword, the truth we know it
It's hocus pocus, once we start the flow they lose your focus
I guess it's prolly ‘cause your verses just ain't too important, you mad at me spittin’
I'm madly efficient, gradually impactin’ your vision
You actually sense your reality go magically missin’
Gravity shiftin’, you babblin’ I'm rappin’ in traps about wrath and repentance
They wrap around and grab every sentence
Oh my, got back the mic, 4-5, get so live
Like IVs in my sleeve when I bleed and pour out
Flowed rhymes since ’05, lines outta mind
Count on my sound without no cosign, lucky I can't travel back to past times
With what I know now—on with the day
Sound off without causin’ delay, you thought about startin’ wit me
Might cost you an arm and leg, head just effortlessly thrown away
I'm steady reppin’ my Areas: from the Metro to the Bay, ok
“Learn somethin’ new everyday,” that's what my auntie would say
I'm always questionin’ God because I mind what he say
When I was sleepin’ on floors, I was thankin’ God everyday
Chattin’ with him like, “what's hat'nin,” bredren that's how I prayed
Now I'm writin’ rhymes while writin’ papers
Solvin’ company problems while droppin’ bars and ridin’ on escalators
Fish on my neck, fishin’ for men
It’s all love, I’m a fish just like them, you ain't catch me though
