[Intro: Call Me Ace]
Y’already know
Call me Ace, man
Yo, Sean T… it’s gon’ need way more than air conditioning
Heh

[Verse 1: Call Me Ace]
(Woof!) I'm too juiced up, no Long Island
My crew stay wylin’, bredren, don't mind ‘em
Ever since I moved to the Bay they tell me I'm slappin’
Every time that I'm rappin’, I tell ‘em, “I'm nonviolent”
Bredren, hold on! They got me so wrong
Type of dude to “Netflix and chill” with his clothes on
Might see me thizz face, but don't get it twisted
Shift in neutral – that’s the only time that I'll roll on
You think I'm feelin' myself, it ain't masturbation
I'm just thankful that my mom seen my graduation
I'm just thankful that my mom seen my graduation
Both ones: my bachelor's and my master's, baby!
But these manmade degrees ain't makin’ me
This nation dream's make believe, I want way more than paper, b
I play this system for freedom so we and all of they could leave
Be a light for sore eyes so they could see
Like a cold stethoscope on your chest
Gotta flow out your breath when you roll out with me
I glow out the best even though I'm a mess
Drop my bones on the floor, “dominoes” when I step
That's new life! Better than birthdays with new bikes
Opposition all in my – wait – new sight
Too many offended by what's in my vision
But I'm too busy livin’ it to argue ‘bout who’s right

[Hook: Call Me Ace]
I heard he makes a lot (What he doin’?)
I heard he like to party (Is that true, kid?)
I heard he fake in public (He's not true, man)
He ain't about that life (Well who are you, man?)
Now why they talk like that? (It's so stupid)
Yo why they talk like that? (It's so stupid)
Yo why they talk like that? (It's so stupid)
Yo why they talk like that? (It's so stupid)
Yo why they talk like that? (It's so stupid)
Yo why they talk like that? (It's so stupid)
Yo why they talk like that? (It's so stupid)
Now why they talk like that? (It's so stupid)

[Bridge: Call Me Ace]
Everybody freeze!
Aight, I’ma give y'all 3 seconds to recompose y’allselves
Aight, times up
Heh

Verse 2
The irony: some of this be comin’ from others that say they my brothers
But we don't share mothers, we not even cousins
Barely relatives, not even colored the same, we don't share blood
But whenever we meet in the skeleton, they lovin’ everything
(What?) Put that on everything! They hatin’ everything!
(What?) Soon as I get to breathe, man, they won't let me speak
(What?) But, I ain't surprised, my g
Saw how they did Christ? Think they gon’ slide by me?
LML, ha-ha-he
I’m way too grown – word to my ID
Lemme keep investin’ up in my IP
And if you don’t want no part, unfollow my IG
AceXPatt – I fly aisle seats
Well, really just not middle, my style's too rowdy
See me, bro, I don't give two hoots about no gold doe
‘Bout no platinum, ‘bout no diamonds, ‘bout no photos
Catch me out on Telegraph chillin’ eatin' froyo
Showin’ off the ring on my left – where's Frodo?
No more ridin’ solo! I'm locked down now, no po doe
Girl walkin’ past me, but ask me if I got FOMO
When I walk through Berkeley, chances they yellin’ YOHO
Still everyday I'm interacting attracting these souls bro
Cause me doe, I don't give two hoots about no gold doe
‘Bout no Louie, bout no Gucci, ‘bout no Polo, heh
