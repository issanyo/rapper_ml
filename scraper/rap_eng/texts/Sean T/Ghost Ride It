Yea man dis ya boy Mistah F.A.B. mayne
Da Yellow Bus Rydah, mayne
Sean T the real king of slaps mayne
Y'all better act like y'all know who his is mayne [chyeah]
Let me give you a 101 on how to ghost ride

[Verse 1]
Look, the streets know what just this is
Ghost ride the whip up and down the strip
The ghost bustas, they the police
Always wanna pull a nigga over for his piece
Not me, I get it in a scrape
Tiremarks on the street lookin like figure 8's
Sideshow, you know where I'm going
From the north to the east just in case you ain't knowin
Bay biz
A town politic
Hit club late now trying to holla at a chick
Can't get in the club, gotta parkin' lot pimp
Hey, lil' mama, come holla at a pimp
What you know about gettin' you a whip?
Buy yourself some shoes and then your car kicks
Ice up ya neck, ya hands and ya whip
Just to hang out the window stuntin' wit ya clique

[Hook]
When you get a new car
And ya feeling like a star
What you gon do?
Ghost ride it!
Ghost ride the whip
When you get a new car
And ya feeling like a star
What you gon do?
Ghost ride it!
Ghost ride the whip

[Verse 2]
Pull up, hop out, all in one motion
Dancing on the hood while the car's still rollin'
Stuntin', shinin', flamboastin'
On one, high, off that potion
Windows down, feet out of it
Damn that boy high, he out of it
Thizzin' to grittin, and gridin
Ice in his mouth, you know he big timin'
Chevys, Buicks, Regals, and Ribbys though
First one I seen ghost ride was Critty Bo
Goin' dumb, party like Diddy do
Mistah FAB I'm the prince of the city, ho
Ghost ride, ghost ride

Get out the way, let Casper drive
Ghost ride, go crazy
Who that drivin'? Patrick Swayze!

[Hook]
When you get a new car
And ya feeling like a star
What you gon do?
Ghost ride it!
Ghost ride the whip
When you get a new car
And ya feeling like a star
What you gon do?
Ghost ride it!
Ghost ride the whip

[Ghost ride 101]
Now stop stop stop stop
Now go go go go
Get out the car, get out the car
Let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
Tap that wheel, tap that
Open up tha door, open up the door
Now thats ghost ridin'. What's ghost ridin?
Ya know, ya know, ya know, now ya know

[Verse 3]
It ain't that hard, you can do it
You wanna go dumb? Just lose it
Bay game, Bay slang
Its a Bay thang
So just know when you come to the Bay mayn
Stunnas is glasses
Thizz is pills
Rippers is broads
Scrapers automobiles
Hyphy is hyper
Our version of crunk
Thizzin is high
And perkin' is drunk

[Hook]
When you get a new car
And ya feeling like a star
What you gon do?
Ghost ride it!
Ghost ride the whip
When you get a new car
And ya feeling like a star
What you gon do?
Ghost ride it!
Ghost ride the whip

[Closing]
Yeah man
You already know man
[?] AKA [?], The paperboy
Getting paper 'til your pockets fill up
And you know, when you got that new whip
And you hit the strip, And you're popping your lip
Watcha gonna do?
Ghost ride it!
Go stupid, go dumb
You already know man
We're bringing the town back, man
Town business
You know, open your door, hang out the sunroof
And ghost ride your whip
You know, jump out on the strip, and just wreck the ghost ride man
You know, we ghost ride like Patrick Swayze man
We go crazy man
Don't be lazy man
You know what I'm saying?
So, holla at your boy!
