[Intro: Call Me Ace]
Ay…I know you want it
Ay…I know you want it
Ay…I know you want it
So let’s get it…ay

[Hook: Call Me Ace]
If you want them positive vibes, throw your hands high
If you cravin’ positive vibes, throw your hands high
If you vibin’ with these vibes, then throw your hands high
Gon’ reach for the sky ‘til you touch the most high

[Verse 1: Call Me Ace]
Ay, in the streets hear ‘em cry, even gangstas been tellin’ me
It’s all about the love and the vibes
Go to school, people just wanna smile, have a good time
Wonder why certain things bring us down, man lets get high
Present yourself to the present, go on say “hi”
Don't let the current take up what's current and pass you by
Your perfect purpose on Earth is just to survive
One hundred percent happy, “Is that why I’m alive?”
So many people wanna see the light now
Forget about the past and just focusin’ on right now
Don't believe in wrong and they figure that's what's right now
Yet quick to call out evil when somebody guns a life down
Your spirituality ain't matchin’ with your lifestyle
If right can't be right but you know what is right, how?
Unless the code is outside of your control
Affects you and me both, then I guess that's how we'll know

[Hook: Call Me Ace]
If you want them positive vibes, throw your hands high
If you cravin’ positive vibes, throw your hands high
If you vibin’ with these vibes, then throw your hands high
Gon’ reach for the sky ‘til you touch the most high

[Verse 2: Call Me Ace]
The same tongue that praises you be the same one that cuss you out
A heart that respects will lust you down
Loudly proclaim our status while our actions be different
Quick to say we love God when we're actually driftin’
If you mad at me, listen, I ain't here braggin’ or dissin’
I'm tryna establish the mission for those who battle addition
Whether it's yak they be sippin’ or poppin’ valves of prescriptions
Or those who's trapped in materialism, know that one we feel it
I came to rap what I'm livin’ cause it matters to give it
I keep it wrapped in experience for those who happen to live it
I try to practice the scripture but can't do that with no spirit
So I collapse when I'm feelin’ weak and I ask him to feel me
I picture Heaven on Earth and don't need no rapture to get it
Our world is shattered, I get it, but now there's power to heal it
This ain't happiness-driven, no I'm not hedonistic
Hollerin’ “Hallelujah, Messiah” to be rather specific

[Hook: Call Me Ace]
If you want them positive vibes, throw your hands high
If you cravin’ positive vibes, throw your hands high
If you vibin’ with these vibes, then throw your hands high
Gon’ reach for the sky ‘til you touch the most high

[Outro: Call Me Ace]
Get ‘em high…high
Get ‘em high…high
Get ‘em high, high, high, high, high
Get ‘em high, high, high, high, high
