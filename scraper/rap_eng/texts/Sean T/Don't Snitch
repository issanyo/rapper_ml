[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Man... I'm through fuckin' around
You niggas keep on ya gon' be duckin' some rounds
I'm rushin' the mound, bitch done hit me with a pitch
He a snitch and he walk with a switch
He in a band that sing for the cops
Him and his mans, they cleanin' up shop
Undercover concert promotor
Ricky Schroder tryin' to turn somebody over
Put that E.T. finger up, you stooley
Don't tattletale, the number one ruley
You the jumpest, the boys, them people
Slipped in the game, sellin' toys to people
I avoid them people, don't ask me shit
The only law I break is in public, grip
My mouth zipped, I plead the 5th
And niggas like you get pushed off a cliff

[Hook]
(Don't ask me shit)
I don't tell mayne
(I don't tell)
You can send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I won't tell mayne
(I won't tell)
Send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I don't tell mayne
(I don't tell)
You can send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I won't tell mayne
(I won't tell)
Send me to jail mayne

[Verse 2: J-Diggs]
I’m on to you boy you used to be the man
Till I caught you in the courtroom sitting on the stand
Got the wave in your hand, & pointing your finger (who you pointing at?)
Holding the mic like some type of rap singer
I seen you, you told & now you gotta live with it
They gone gitcho & probably say that pigs did it (I ain’t did shit)
Fuck you, fuck who you been to, fuck what you going thru, & fuck where you been
Consider this a warning to you cats out rapping (all you niggas)
The streets get ugly when a drive by happens (you heard that homie?)
You rap niggas out here starving for fame (better cut that nigga loose)
Better watch who you fuck with, a scar on your name
My young nigga locked up, ball & chain
& y'all niggas acting like it’s all in the game (it don’t work like that)
I hear niggas on the street wanna blast this bitch (go & get him)
& when it happens? Don’t ask me shit

[Hook]
(Don't ask me shit)
I don't tell mayne
(I don't tell)
You can send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I won't tell mayne
(I won't tell)
Send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I don't tell mayne
(I don't tell)
You can send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I won't tell mayne
(I won't tell)
Send me to jail mayne

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
You can line 'em up and put twelve in a box
And find out your boy is workin' with the cops
Doin' flip-flops, the Rover rollin' over
The Tootsie Roller, scared to do a quarter
It's October and he can't be gone 'til November
So he's givin' up the gang, every damn member
Everything he remember - he's tellin'
He get out of jail free, ain't no bailin'
He's no felon, he's no misdemeanor
He got a target melon and a E.T. finger
Nigga you the cleaners tryin' to wash me
Quit peepin' at my Beamer, tryin' to watch me

[Hook]
(Don't ask me shit)
I don't tell mayne
(I don't tell)
You can send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I won't tell mayne
(I won't tell)
Send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I don't tell mayne
(I don't tell)
You can send me to jail mayne
(Don't ask me shit)
I won't tell mayne
(I won't tell)
Send me to jail mayne
