[Verse 1: Call Me Ace]
When I lived in New York, my church was right next to Hell's Kitchen
Walk outside, everyday was a mission
Ridin’ the train sharin’ with people who dare to feel it
While others covered they ears in fear, too scared to listen
Too true to my position politickin’ with future politicians
Too woke to be affiliated just bout his business
Too efficient type to take the 2/3 to catch the 1 in any minute
For the one is how I'm livin’ like (yee!)
5, 6, 7, 8, time to set it straight
Light Armor, scrappin’ heavyweight, let me demonstrate
Fight the good fight any day, each and every day
'im soon come, he ain't set a date but he ain't never late
I almost died one time in the street
Blood runnin’ from my head wonderin’ if we'll meet
Never know your deathbed might not really be
That monologue opportunity you see on TV, better know

[Hook: Call Me Ace]
But you keep a bible close just in case, huh?
Keep a cross around that rope just in case, huh?
Got a set of Sunday clothes just in case, huh?
You never know never know, just in case, huh?
I bet you keep a bible close just in case, huh?
Keep a cross around that rope just in case, huh?
Got a set of Sunday clothes just in case, huh?
You never know never know, just in case, huh?
You got a cross around your neck, just in case, huh?
Verse tatted on your flesh, just in case, huh?
You see Christian put a check, just in case, huh?
You never know never know

[Verse 2: Call Me Ace]
Cuando fui a Medellín, me di cuenta de que necesitamos
El poder del espíritu en nuestro corazón
Y sin él no tenemos nada ni siquiera el amor
Solo cobramos polvo, todo que tenemos es labor
Apologies for tongue speakin’ thought we needed sabor
Mis hermanos are like "dale háblalo por favor"
Meanwhile y'all prolly tryna find the right interpretation
But if you just listen closely bruh that's all that I've been sayin’, tell em (yee!)
5, 6, 7, 8, let it marinate
Light Armor, watch us levitate but we ain't featherweight
Opposition really tend to hate, we preachin’ anyway
Reachin’ to that gate the narrow way our speed accelerates
Let it resonate, used to grow up in that Section 8
With nothin’ on that dinner plate, used to self-medicate
‘Cause life was so depressin’ I just wanted it to end away
But now I got a flame that make the devil hyperventilate, boy (woo!)

[Hook: Call Me Ace]
But you keep a bible close just in case, huh?
Keep a cross around that rope just in case, huh?
Got a set of Sunday clothes just in case, huh?
You never know never know, just in case, huh?
I bet you keep a bible close just in case, huh?
Keep a cross around that rope just in case, huh?
Got a set of Sunday clothes just in case, huh?
You never know never know, just in case, huh?
You got a cross around your neck, just in case, huh?
Verse tatted on your flesh, just in case, huh?
You see Christian put a check, just in case, huh?
You never know never know

[Outro: Call Me Ace]
You say Jesus is the man, just in case huh?
Prayer hands on the gram, just in case huh?
...Favorite food is lamb, just in case huh?
