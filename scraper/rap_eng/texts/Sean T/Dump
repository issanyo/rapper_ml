[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
This bitch is steady jockin’, shes beggin’ me to kick it
She’s all on my dick and I know she want to lick it
She’s wicked, I stick it, right between her lips
The ones on her face and the ones between her hips
I dips and slips, she fucks then sucks
She ridin’ on my dick while she’s holdin’ on my nuts
Lovin’ how I treat her, mad 'cause I won’t eat her
But when I nut, she’s happy, she’s lovin’ how I G'd her
That first time was cool, then I had to slow up
Must've turned her out 'cause now she's tore up from the floor up
But know what? So what; girl, find another
Think I’ll try this potent maccin’ mouthpiece on her mother
Serve it to her mama, she’s eatin' up my drama
She’s smarter than her daughter, 'cause she can tell that I'm a...
Mac about his money, baby was no dummy
I slipped up, and tripped up and put one in her tummy
Couldn’t take my dick out, this dick thick portioned
Now she’s in the clinic having an abortion
She said she was too old for kids, and I agreed
Quickly took heed of the time she didn’t bleed
Now every time I bash it, I use a prophylactic
Baby got to jockin’ and shake move was drastic
Had to let her catch me with her chink friend Su-Chang
Ooh, she caught us fuckin’ and turned it to a group thing
I do things, new things, with them throughout the night
Never knew that chink cot would ever be this tight
Had to do this right, 'cause I just owned this mic
Beater started something to keep my pockets tight
Lace 'em for a week, then I play the broke role
Two weeks later, they had my pockets so swoll
The ho stroll was oh-so, poppin’ when they hit it
Tricks was gettin’ wit’ it
Listen while I spit it

[Verse 2: Berner]
Bern break bitches for mucho guapo
(Shhhh) Salute El Chapo
I party all night on the beach in Jacó
Lost 20 grand on the tables in Tahoe
Smooth operator, I don’t rock no gator
J’s on my feet, hot shell for a hater
Make a bitch choose, take her out a small town
40 cal, long round make 'em all fall down
It’s the B-A-Y we don’t aim for the sky
I put a grow room in every crib that I buy
Still get my hands dirty, whole thing cost 30
Coke so clean, look so pearly
Yeah, I let it grow out, I never pull early
Young guys die with my cutthroat Furly
Packs in the trunk, I got weight for sale
No banks please, no paper trail
I put 8 in the mail, I hope it make it there
AMG, I'mma race you there
Don’t hate the player but my mouthpiece crazy
Talk the bitch out of 80, baby girl don’t play me (Uhh)
Big bag, smoke good, where the lean at?
Pop two Xans, take a weed nap
Still right here where the cream at
Where the city, where the Rich, where the V at
Man, this shit got me all lazy
In a new Mercedes, with two fly ladies
Coke plug show a broke bitch no love
Might slide in it with no glove
Hold up, bundle so thick it don’t fold up
Rolled up, smoke on sulfa, I’m a stoner
Weed head from the SF City
Where my bud's so good and my chain so pretty
Boy!
