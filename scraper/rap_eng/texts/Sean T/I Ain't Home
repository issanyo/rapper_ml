[Intro: Call Me Ace]
Home…unh…home…yea…

[Bridge: Call Me Ace]
Look...
Knight takes bishop endin’ this game quicker
L-shape delivered, wanna play another pick up?
Watch the pawns push up, shook, a stick up
Me and my queen took up, my king won, look up

[Verse 1: Call Me Ace]
Church walls crumblin’ fast, thought it would last
But the building light up only at mass, and after that
Just a bunch of bill payments while our sandals hit the pavement
Transfiguring the Way to really capture your amazement
For the Son we ride out at dusk, pedalin’ fast
Watch the dust unsettle as we go travelin’ muddy paths
Grew up in a struggle, real comfy with muddle pasts
But also discovered the Lord, that's just a humble brag
Well truthfully, he had been pursuin’ me, while I was out
Downin’ multiple shots he was movin’ right down the block of Frat Row
Ready to catch me when I reached the plateau of that slope
But couldn't see him from the puffs that I smoked, all that smoke
I’m losin’ meaning everywhere that I go (that I go)
I wanna rise but afraid that I won't, so I don't
I'm hidin’ behind what I'm shoppin’ on my block
And tryna walk my way through college as I'm watchin’ for the cops
What?

[Hook: Call Me Ace]
I hear someone callin’ my name from the window
But I'ma pretend though that I ain't home
No, no I ain't home…no…ay
I hear someone callin’ my name from the window
But I'ma pretend though that I ain't home
No, no I ain't home…

[Verse 2: Call Me Ace]
Drownin’ my sorrows while I'm downin’ this bottle
I got a pound on my mind tryna follow the time, slow up
Tryna fly high to pass up these clouds
I'm tired of rewindin’ the thoughts of me dyin’ im sorrowful, pour up
Wallowin’ powerlessly, I'm a monster
I saw that part of me harborin’ anger it bothered me
I called that my Mr. Hyde, I just bottled that up inside
On the surface I'm Mr. Clean, but look deeply, I'm burnt alive
My closest homie imprisoned, I only wish to survive
Askin’ God why did this happen as if I'm livin’ a lie
“Boy stop actin’ like you inherently good, that's just a lie
Boy look closely at human nature, ain't nothin’ new in this life”
Boy what happened?
Flicked switch, new bulb comin’ in light
No more blockin’ sun rays, no longer runnin’ in night
Please know that I'm down to ride, I got my three-piece with wing tips
Button-down with a tie, just hope I'm comin’ in right, ay

[Hook: Call Me Ace]

But I'ma pretend though that I ain't home
No, no I ain't home…no…ay
I hear someone callin’ my name from the window
But I'ma pretend though that I ain't home
No, no I ain't home…
