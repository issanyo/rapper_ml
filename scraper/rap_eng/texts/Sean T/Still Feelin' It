[Intro: Mistah F.A.B. (talking)]
R-I-P to the Mac D-R-E
Uhhhhhhhhhh!
Oh god!
They done let me and Sean T hook back up again!
(The real king of slaps!)
We about to go Zamunda!  (That's African!)
Mac Dre forever, mayne, I don't know what they heard
Kilo, you know I'm still throwin' this T up, mayne! (THIZZ)

[Verse 1]
Let me stop, so I can touch myself
The game so sharp I might cut myself
You hatin' on a boy?  Hush thyself!
I'm on my own jock 'cause I love thyself
Oh, Sean T, with the slap again
'Bout to bring the movement back, we goin' African
My bruh put a Xanny in Actavis about to nod off
"Bro wake up, man what's happening?"
Fabby Davis, where you been, bruh?
On 80 going 80 in a Benz, bruh
In my Mazzi with ???
I bought that from "Life of Da Party"
And I just want to party with somebody body
Get a little naughty and turn out the party
Like "HEY" I'm in your bitch face, with the thizz face
This an album, not the mixtape

[Hook]
Now can I get a YEE, for who I'm in the building with?
Who I came with is who I'm still chilling with
The sound that we started, they stealing it
But that just let us know they still feeling it
Yup, I'm still feeling it
I'm still feeling myself, still feeling myself
Yup, I'm still feeling it
I'm still feeling myself, still feeling myself
Yup, I'm still feeling it

[Verse 2]
Feeling me, not none of them
Sean T, on my mama, this one of them
Do I gotta remind 'em where I'm from again?
Said it was dead, well hey, we about to go dumb again
Feeling myself 'cause I can
'Cause me and Mac Dre was real friends
I blew Backwoods with the Mac, uhh
If it wasn't in the 'wood, it wasn't that good
I sip bo with the Jack 'til we nodded off
Niggas stealing our style, nigga, knock it off!
I fell back, fell off? Not at all
I'm still spending money from 2004
Free Dubee, Big Dant, and Miami
Off this one we might win a Grammy
I swear on Liberty granny
Still feeling myself, you understand me?

[Hook]
Now can I get a YEE, for who I'm in the building with?
Who I came with is who I'm still chilling with
The sound that we started, they stealing it
But that just let us know they still feeling it
Yup, I'm still feeling it
I'm still feeling myself, still feeling myself
Yup, I'm still feeling it
I'm still feeling myself, still feeling myself
Yup, I'm still feeling it

[Verse 3]
The building, we still in it
We started this turn up, you stealing it
If it's K-rolled, I'm not feeling it
Won't sip out the brick 'less the seal on it
My little bruh got 30 on the stick and he killin' shit
Be cool bruh-bruh we on some chillin' shit
Styrofoam in my hand and won't spill a sip
I'm still trying to find out, who's Nancy Von Chillinwich?
Mamas, I wanna gig with her
Jeromey Rome, I thizz with her
Let the whole world see what I did with her
Pop one, pop two, here's a thizz dinner
I was riding in an old school Cadillac
Playin' Mac Dre, and then I'm slappin Jack
In the back seat, where I had her at
She said "I'll give you head if you bring that '06 Fabby back"

[Hook]
Now can I get a YEE, for who I'm in the building with?
Who I came with is who I'm still chilling with
The sound that we started, they stealing it
But that just let us know they still feeling it
Yup, I'm still feeling it
I'm still feeling myself, still feeling myself
Yup, I'm still feeling it
I'm still feeling myself, still feeling myself
Yup, I'm still feeling it
I'm still feeling myself, still feeling myself
Yup, I'm still feeling it
I'm still feeling myself, still feeling myself
Yup, I'm still feeling it
