Uh, (don't cry) just follow me for a second
Le let me take you all some place

[Verse 1:]
I remember When I was young my momma said she was goin out
You see the problem is she was always going out
Grandma mad cuz my mama left us in the house
She was grown but granny thought she was showin out
Know you sayin damn they ain't shit to be mad to
My momma told me well that she did what she had to
But see I ain't like that she was datin the bad dudes
So everytime she went out I gave her an attitude
Yeah I was straight throwin a tantrum
Try to mess up her plans I was hopin she cancel
But ain't nobody told her what she could and she can't do
Yeah ma I was a handful so yeah
I cried and I cried and I tried to show her my said
But she wasn't hearin her kid took the key to the crib
Out the door she wavin bye bye
She had me thinking that my tears meant nothin'
Years later found out it means something
You see all those nights mama left me alone
I had to learn how to stand on my own (2 feet)

[Chorus:]
Don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride
And don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride (don't cry because it's okay)

[Verse 2:]
So now I'm grown up rap performer
Give thanks to the mirror where I practiced so much
Thats to my grandma after so much
Sacrifice I feel so loved
And this is to my auntie ann cuz I be damned
If I ever said can't when I probly can
To my brother my blood my right hand man
Won't hesitate to put my life in yo hands
And this is to my young sis 2 cuz nothing could stop you
Roy hand and troy p I ain't forgot you
My uncle joe and serita even my pops to
If I'm on top then we on top to
Chris and b you know that I got you
Will and ill c you know that I got you
The whole 6-4 you know that I got you
Black get yo hustle on I can't knock you
C-l slim and k b
Niggas in the hood that failed to pay me
I still got love for you niggas don't know why
So I know the meaning of when mama said don't cry

[Chorus: x2]
Don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride
