You know what it is when it is
When we do what we do

If good girls get down on the floor
Tell me, how low will a bad girl go?
She'll probably pick it up, drop it down real slow
Either that or she's upside down on the pole

That's when I grab the knot, throw it up in the sky
Let it come down slow, watch it all fly
Front to the back then side to the side
Then we head back to my crib for the night

That's how it goes down, all night long
She whispered in my ear, said she loves my song
This Is Why I'm Hot, she got it on her phone
Top 10 download, number one ringtones

I'm in my zone, tell me what's good
What it be can't say I'm what you want
But I got what you need, all night, it's all right
We can dance but you gotta keep it up a lil' somethin'

Like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Baby do ya want it like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this?
Girl tell me if you want it like this

If you want to you can back it up
You say you like it rough, won't you let me smack it up?
Palm on ya ass, that's if you let me touch
I don't care about your breasts, you could be a A cup

I know what I like and baby that's below the waist
I'm a baller, baby I hold the safe
I got about 10 lawyers to blow the case
So we don't gotta worry about those who hate

I'm like the 2007 Nino
Dropped a few G's on my shirt like Gino
Homie don't act like you know what I mean oh
See I'm the freshest motherfucka on the scene oh

Back of the club all night long
Gran Marnier, pop a case of the Dom
Shorty says she love it when I let her call me Sean
So if you really down baby we can get in on

Gimme gimme, gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme, gimme gimme gimme gimme

Gimme that, all of that, break it down
Girl, shake it up, now drop it to the ground
You're way too high, go a lil' lower
Now baby beat it up like Rocky Balboa

Yeah, that's what I said, shorty go 'head
Show me what you got, here's a lil more bread
You know how I shine, a hundred on the wrist
If you like what you see then you gotta keep it up a lil somethin'
