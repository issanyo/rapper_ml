Ooooooooooo oooooohhh yyyeaaah ooooooh

Mims:
Tell her wit me it like a ride uh uh a ride
But when the ride is movin keep yah hands inside
At first I take yah low then I can take you high
Take you twice around the world baby I make you fly
Make you fly keep you laced Christian Louboutin
This rollercoaster ride she want to do it again
But she can?t cause she know I?m in love with the doe
Plus the ride that she?s on is to emotional
I?m to stuck in my ways for us to play how we play
At first you beggin to leave then you beggin to stay
Same shit different day I?m like please s'il vous plait
You can lead if you may but then I hear you say

Chorus:
I?m so tired of playin love rollercoaster with you
Cause my heart can?t take this drama you be puttin me through
It goes up and down round and round
Round and round over and over again

I?m so tired of playin love rollercoaster with you
Cause my heart can?t take this drama you be puttin me through
It goes up and down round and round
Round and round over and over again

Mims:
I never said it would be easy peep the nigga you dealin wit
I be on my million shit she be on that ill and shit
Whether club or studio she want to know who im chillin with
Ridin on that rollercoaster none of us is feelin it
The notion got me feelin sick I don?t want to lose this
Money or relationship please don?t let me choose this
She?s on a constant mood switch but I say theirs no right or wrong
She swears that she?s right I?m wrong she?s always tryna prove shit
I be on that cool shit she be on that bull shit
She says that I love her but don?t love her like my music

Why do you think I do this to keep you in that new shit
Keep yo hands inside of the ride when it?s movin

Chorus:
I?m so tired of playin love rollercoaster with you
Cause my heart can?t take this drama you be puttin me through
It goes up and down round and round
Round and round over and over again

I?m so tired of playin love rollercoaster with you
Cause my heart can?t take this drama you be puttin me through
It goes up and down round and round
Round and round over and over again

Letoya:
This feelin that I?m goin through
You got me caught up and I?m so confused
And everything I thought that we had was true
But now I?m seein a whole different side of you
You got me goin up and down and round and round
I?m goin up and down and round round
Goin up and down and round and round
And round and round we go

Chorus:
I?m so tired of playin love rollercoaster with you
Cause my heart can?t take this drama you be puttin me through
It goes up and down round and round
Round and round over and over again

I?m so tired of playin love rollercoaster with you
Cause my heart can?t take this drama you be puttin me through
It goes up and down round and round
Round and round over and over again
