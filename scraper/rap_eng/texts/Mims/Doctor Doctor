[Mims talking]
Aw man, I'm fucked up man. I think I need to see a psychiatrist
My minds playing tricks on me man

[Verse 1]
I said doctor, doctor won't you help me?
So many sick thoughts see my mind ain't healthy
Mad at the fact that I ain't wealthy
So I sell drugs ain't shit you could tell me
When he got 10 cars and I got no car
Waitin at the bus stop, I can't go far
You ain't poor you don't know what it is like
To be in my shoes man and see what I live like
Now how can you live life
20 plus years old caught in a mid-life crisis?
Fuck who's the nicest
It's about copping them new devices, Italian ices, gauging prices
When you on top you should see how life is
So unrighteous, but it feels so good
Mad at me like "he ain't no good", but I feel so good

[Mims talking]
I mean, I mean damn doc
Shit is going real good for me
I got a lot of fame now
But I don't think I could take it man

[Verse 2]
Check it out. I said doctor, doctor I need help now
Ain't slept in years so I see a melt down
Either that or permanent breakdown
Cause my hypeman ain't learning the breakdown
I'm on tour now, my voice is towed down
Moving too fast but I can't slow down
Doc said to rest, time to cancel the show now
Fans upset like I'm a No-Show, "Wow!"
But I ain't do it on purpose
Behind the fame man I'm a regular person
But I feel worthless, the gift and curse is
If I fuck up my voice then it ain't worth it
But I gotta give them what they purchased
If I'm the disciple then what they worship
Is Hip Hop, not just a couple of verses
But doc hold up I'm just touchin the surface

[Mims talking]
I mean damn doc, I can't take this no more man
I'm cracking under pressure
It's a little too much for me man
My minds goin crazy right now

[Verse 3]
I said doctor, doctor I'm losin my mind quick
Ain't been shot but it seems like I'm hit
Who woulda thought after all I did
And all I gained I would call it quits
5'9" but I'm tall as shit
The skies the limit then watch how tall I get
Wait, this is what other niggas would call dreams
But me, this life meaning it was foreseen
So why am I complaining
God blessed me man, I'm an angel in training
I done came in the game in a dash like Damon
Predicted the reign man just like "Rain Man"
Down in the sun on the Island of Cayman
While you and your main man stood on the main land
Even real niggas know what I'm saying
Yeah shit changed but I ain't changing, for nobody

[Mims talking]
I mean GOD damn doc
I been coming to you for the last 3 years and you ain't said shit
Seems like I talk my way out my own problems
Sitting over here paying you all this money
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
Uh, I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
We goin to the next one now, MIMS, yeah
