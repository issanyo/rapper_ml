Money, money, pussy, Brittany, Becky, Nikki. They said they want that licky. As long as it ain't fishy, I make that shit get wetter, then weather turns to sticky. I hit her with that dicky then she (hehehe) like Missy. I'm a dog, I got the bone. I quarterback that pussy, go long. I throw the bomb, she better catch that. Right through the middle, baby, I running back that. If I ain't gettin busy then baby I'm gettin money. I keep them dollars like pussy, baby I keep it comin. I got some extra hollows for pussies I'm never runnin. I'm Travis Barker, I'll beat it baby I'm into drummin

I beat it up, you skeet it off. She said she like it hard, I beat it til it's soft. I never beat it raw, I beat it til it's off. I keep that thing down like it won't be there tomorrow. I beat it like an MJ song, jacket with all them zippers. You find me in the back of the club with all them strippers. They earthquake shakin, booty is off the Richter. I'm on that red belly, I blame it all on the liquor. Tomorrow, a new day, with some Beckys that give more head than toupees. Just know that you are a superstar like Lupe. And if you know you got money, you turn it in and you say

They blowin up my celly, I let that bitch just ring. I tell her that I'm busy, she hit me with that ping. I hit her with that thing, then you know that I'm gone. Just let me know when you leavin baby I'm already home. I'm a beast, I am a problem. I got that good shit, I need to charge em. I got so many chicks, it's hard to dodge em. So I slip slip slip n slide on em like a slalom. If I ain't gettin busy then baby I'm gettin mula. I get that pussy wet as a pool and then I scuba. I cut it up, cut it up, I'm Freddy Krueger. You know that I'm the shit like manure in the sewer, I'm sick. Ow
