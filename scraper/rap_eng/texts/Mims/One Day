After years of battle, after years of war
It's still hard to see what we're fighting for
I can see your troubles, I can feel your pain
But from all this fighting tell me where's the change

It's gon' be love again
It's gon' be love again
It's gon' be love again
It's gon' be love again one day

So one day we will fly
Things and time must change, yeah
Don't cry, yeah

Rain down on me, rain down on me
Rain down on me love, yeah
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Rain down on me love, yeah

When the rain stops pouring and the wet rug is dry
All that's left is struggle, it's just you and I
So if you pray for me then I will pray for you
And we will come together, all it takes is two

It's gon' be love again
It's gon' be love again
It's gon' be love again
It's gon' be love again one day

So one day we will fly
Things and time must change, yeah
Don't cry, yeah

Rain down on me, rain down on me
Rain down on me love, yeah
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Rain down on me love, don't cry, yeah

Love again, love again
Love again, love again

Rain down, rain down, rain down, yeah
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Rain down on me love
It's gon' be love again one day
