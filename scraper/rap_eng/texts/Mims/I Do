I'm not, I'm not trying to fight you
I'm just trying to love you

Check it out yo, she got it going on baby
Check it out yo, she got it going on baby
Check it out yo, yo, she got it going on baby
Check it out yo, check it, check it out

Look clearly it is plain to see, if it ain't meant to be
Then please explain to me how we, we have came to be
You have came to me although we can't agree

And I know it often angers me, it often angers you
That's the pain'll do, especially when they're saying to you
All the things you don't see, but they saying I do
But I'm saying I do, on my name I do
Retire my jersey let 'em hang my shoe

Right on the telephone wire, let's grow, let's go higher
Till we're both old and tired
'Cause even when we die, our souls won't expire
So yup, I really want to know since it's really on you

Let me hold my arms around you girl then take your fear away
If loving you is wrong I'd rather be wrong, I'm here to stay
I do it all for you, my feelings are true from the very depth of my heart
And don't you never ever, ever forget it babe

Hey girl, you know you're so damn fine
Yo, I'm about to lose my mind
Hey girl, you know you're so damn fine
Yo, I'm about to lose my mind

Clearly it is plain to see all the things I do affect you painfully
And no, you shouldn't change for me
You should change for you whatever change may be

A thorn is never pretty as the flower
But the prettiest flower seems to have the most thorns
We as stubborn as a bull with both horns
All you got to say is I do and maybe we can go on

And no this ain't no song
If loving you is right then there ain't no wrong
Therefore we can't grow long
Like a man with no arms I just can't hold on

Knowing that you ain't mine officially
I've got nothing but love like everyone get [Incomprehensible]
So girl I really wanna know since it's really on you, say

Let me hold my arms around you girl then take your fear away
If loving you is wrong I'd rather be wrong, I'm here to stay
I do it all for you, my feelings are true from the very depth of my heart
And don't you never ever, ever forget it babe

Look this ain't a love song, this ain't a club song
I'm on my LL shit, this ain't a thug song
This is a strictly from me to us song
So I guess that makes it more an us song

This ain't a love song, this ain't a club song
I'm on my LL shit, this ain't a thug song
This is a strictly from me to us song
So I guess that makes it more an us song

All my newlywed couples do you feel me?
All my couples still together do you feel me?
All my puppy love couples do you feel me?
You've been together for a while I know you feel me

All my newlywed couples do you feel me?
All my couples still together do you feel me?
All my puppy love couples do you feel me?
You've been together for a while I know you feel me

Let me hold my arms around you girl then take your fear away
If loving you is wrong I'd rather be wrong, I'm here to stay
I do it all for you, my feelings are true from the very depth of my heart
And don't you never ever, ever forget it babe

Hey, I need a honey, I need a honey, honey

Oh, be my honey
