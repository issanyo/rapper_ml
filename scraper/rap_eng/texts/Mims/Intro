Music is my savior, when i was young, where I'm from people didn't get out, people just sat on the corners hustling for years, no sense of hope, just an addiction to survive off other peoples addictions, so i made music mine, him right there, he ran the spot, you couldn't make no money without seeing him, and them right there, well, they work for him, you see a lot of faces just come through and just disappear , not because they move up, mostly because they either dead or in jail, music saved my life, it kept me inside, it brought me home early, it kept me in the right place at the right time, so i dedicate this album to music, music is my savior...LETS DO THIS!
