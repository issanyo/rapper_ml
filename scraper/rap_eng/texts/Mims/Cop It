[Woman:]
Cop it
Object
Put it in the pot
Then rock it
Put it out
Look how I profit
Haters tryna knock it
But I won't stop
Cuz they know I'm about to blow

[Verse 1: Mims]
Yes it's me
The underestimated MC
So, ill with the flow I need a M.D
Somebody call a doctor
I make 'em all sick when I hop out the phantom of the opera
Oppo-site to what I call a failure
I am the reasons y'all can't look in the mirrors
But don't worry I see shit a lil' clearer
Go ahead and act funny but you ain't stackin' money
And therefore we ain't here for the best
Matta fact, homey I can't hear y'all
I'm deaf
I spit it in sign language, mob language
Keep me around bread like a sandwich
Dammit
The plane done landed
The plan unveiled
Now, gimme some space, I'm outta this world
Some niggas say they just tryna get a nut
That may be true, but, I'm a very big squirrel
Y'all niggas get in some shit and just bail
I'm at the precinct like fuck it it's just bail
Me, I'm a very big deal with some very big work on a very big scale

[Chorus: Woman]
Cop it
Object
Put it in the pot
Then rock it
Put it out
Look how I profit
Haters tryna knock it
But I won't stop
Cuz they know I'm about to blow

[Verse 2:]
I heard it was, squeeze first ask questions
So which one of y'all is the next to ask?
Be the same one of y'all, up next to blast
I suggest you raise up, like Exxon gas
You bullshittin', I'm talkin' what I could do
Mims is hotter than some cooked food
I'm a good dude, so usually I chill
But if you look close enough, you can see my steel
Yes, I'm concealed
Yes, I'm the shit
You think his paper long, you should see my deal
I'm Microsoft Mims, I rock wit' Bill Gates
First week, shipped a mill out the gate
And I ain't tryna brag, I just set the record straight
My shit push 4, I'm just tryna move 8
You tryna catch up with me, ya too late
All you do is lose weight
IIIIII move weight
Driiiiive through states
Push [?] like every day was a Tuesday
Wow, that's real
Y'all, iced grill
I'm laughin' on my way to the bank wit' a nice mil

[Chorus: Woman]
Cop it
Object
Put it in the pot
Then rock it
Put it out
Look how I profit
Haters tryna knock it
But I won't stop
Cuz they know I'm about to blow

[Verse 3: Mims]
I'm a Range Rove rapper
Plain-clothes rappers
Need to stop actin' like the thang won't clap ya
I am not a killer, nor do I defend 'em
I don't swing at dudes, I am not a pendulum
I don't write laws or rules, nigga I bend 'em
I don't start careers when I beef, nigga I end 'em
You don't want it with me, I can see clearly
You match up with I?
Please, barely
Dog, I'm nearly as high as it gets
I get weary in the sky when I fly like this
I'm so high, it's gettin' kinda hard to top it
So imagine when the album drop, I'ma make y'all

[Chorus: Woman (MIMS)]
Cop it
Object
Put it in the pot (I don't know what the fuck she's saying)
Then rock it
Put it out
Look how I profit
Haters tryna knock it
But I won't stop
Cuz they know I'm about to blow
