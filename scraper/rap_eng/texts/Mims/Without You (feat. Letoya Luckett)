(Chorus)
Letoya Luckett
Nothin's been right
Since you walked
Out my life
So please come back
Cause I can't eat
I can't sleep
And I can't go on (no)
Just can't go on without you

Mims
Gotta do what I gotta (yeah)
Ya see I been around the globe but no I'm not a trotter
I'm just a fiend for the green for them dollas
So baby I don't mean what I mean when I holla (sorry)
At them models blame it on the bottles but
The truth is I ain't in no exclusives (nope)
The hoes love it when they see a coupe roofless
That's why I'm always on that new shit (yeah)
Cause when I dropped it hoes dropped it
At the hotel is when we got the clothes droppin' (the game)
They kept callin' me but no stoppin'
I'm on the road doin shows and you can go shoppin'
Now you lonely, moved on me
In the hood word is you gotta new homie
But I ain't mad, do u homie, cause for me it's mic check 1,2 homie (let's go)

(Chorus)
Mims
I'm on a plane on the way out, London U.K
Shorty at home cryin' out won't you stay
Can't stand the fact I'll be back in two days
On top of all that I attract the groupies
So she sick till her tummy hurts
Honey dip don't understand how money works
She said I work too hard with no play
She don't know that I'm out there where them hoes stay
Or in the back of that club all in that rosey rippin' that bar up
End of the night I'm a alcoholic
I'm all up in the ward off Astoria
In the suite with Miranda and Carly
Yeah weekend love is all that I can offer (I'm sorry)
So when I get home I'm more like a foreigner
I'm in and out from N.Y to Florida
L.A to T.X. then south of the border

(Chorus)
Mims
Baby girl, baby baby girl
As soon as I'm back I take you around the world
I know it's whack I put ya life through hell
Try to compromise because things were stale
This is real to the death of me
But you stuck around when there was nothing left of me
You was there for me
Plus you cared for me
So forever you will always get respect from me (let's go)

Letoya Luckett
Baby your love means so much to me
With you is where I always wanna be
(Lovin you makes my life complete)
You make my life complete

(Chorus)
