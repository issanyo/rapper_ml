In my life (x2)
In my life (x2)
Uh, Uh, Uh
Mims!

Verse 1
Feels good to look good
That why I rock rocin repulic
B spo suits, stefano ricci cufflinks
Big respect all my indie connects, but if it ain't tight I hope you send me a cheque cus
When I spot it, they support it
But just imagine when I couldn't afford it
It wasn't all good a few years ago
Not until He sent down a few miracles
Now I'm so sick I need theraflu
All I do is bag chips like therablue
For the love of money mehn I'm telling you
Even my music known to all federals
Chorus
Why Oh Why Oh Why Oh Why (x2)
I can't live without you (x2)
Somebody tell me
Why Oh Why Oh Why Oh Why (x2)
I can't live without you(x2)
Verse 2
Feels good to look good
That's why I put the roof where the trunk is
That's why I pack it up where the trump is
We all love being fresh to death my money is suicide
I can show you were the jump is, yeah
I can show you were the gun is
And if you stack right what the sum is
They say your happiest day you're suppose to glow
But sometimes your shine ain't always where the sun is
So I'm on my v v s one shit
You know what time it is Jala Potray
Black palm automars bogeys
We all gotta go, I'm going all the way
Chorus
Why Oh Why Oh Why Oh Why (x2)
I can't live without you (x2)
Somebody tell me
Why Oh Why Oh Why Oh Why (x2)
I can't live without you(x2)
Interlude
I'm just sayin since y'all thinking
Y'all thinking it, I'm saying
Fuck is the differece mehn?
I blessed mehn I feel good
Verse 3
Feels good to look good
So me I bet it all on the table
That's why I make em spend it all at the label
What y'all call leaving beyond dreams
Or leaving beyond means
I just call being stable
I walk the tight rope with no cable
All balance, All challenged
More shows, more dough, more styling
If y'all feel how I feel then y'all whiling
And na I never worship money
Unless you talking about the time I'm giving churches
But ain't nothing wrong with a little purchase money
You know a hot 16 mehn versus money
Chorus
Why Oh Why Oh Why Oh Why (x2)
I can't live without you (x2)
Somebody tell me
Why Oh Why Oh Why Oh Why (x2)
I can't live without you(x2)
