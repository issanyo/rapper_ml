Our love will live forever
Just one more word, just one last kiss goodbye

Where do we start? Time apart
So many years, so much heart
So many tears but still I couldn't cry them
Knew I was hurt but all I do was hide them

Wish you was here to see the places I've been
I know you would be proud to see the cars that I'm drivin'
The home that I live in, I know that you listenin'
But if you were here I wonder would it be different

What would it be like if I could add a few years
To the times she wasn't here to experience so you could see life
Man, that would be like changing
The ending of a book that we like

But that ain't the story that I wish you would rewrite
Gotta keep on until they give me the green light
Livin' it up but still somethin' don't seem right
Be gone in a physical but lifted my dreams like

Every night and every day
Every night and every day

Our love will live forever
Just one more word, just one last kiss goodbye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word, just one last kiss goodbye

Even though it's a dream to me
It still seems to be what I perceive to be perfect scenery
What if you lost, could come back at a cost
But they told you the price would be whatever your fortune is

Would you spend it in a minute for a minute
For a second just to ask one question about how life is in heaven?
I would give it all back to the point of no return
Just to feel one hug or to hear one word

It's a shame the day we learn how to value
But we still mull when they ain't no one around you
But mama I miss you, one day I'll be with you
As long as I live you know you lifted my men too

I'll never forget you, you know that I love you
You know that I am the man I am because of you
Before I'ma leave, you see I'ma believe
That since you ain't in the flesh you come to me in my dreams

Every night and every day
Every night and every day

Our love will live forever
Just one more word, just one last kiss goodbye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word, just one last kiss goodbye

Last night I had a dream and it felt so right
You held me in your arms and it felt so tight
And it felt so real why would I wake up?
I even day dream now, I don't wanna stay up

So you can take me to a place where I can go
And let my mind draw the picture that I control
'Cause I'm dreamin', yes I'm dreamin'
If you catch me asleep just leave me

Every night and every day
Every night and every day

Our love will live forever
Just one more word, just one last kiss goodbye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word, just one last kiss goodbye
Goodbye forever, one last kiss goodbye
