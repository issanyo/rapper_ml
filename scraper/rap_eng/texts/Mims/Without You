[Chorus: LeToya Luckett]
Nothing's been right
Since you walked out my life
So please come back, 'cause I can't eat
I can't sleep
And I can't go on, no
Just can't go on
Without you...

[Verse 1]
See I was trynna do what I gotta (yeah)
You see I been around the globe but no Im not a trotter (uh)
I'm just a fiend for them green for them dollars (right)
So baby I on't mean what I mean when I holla (I'm sorry)
After models, could blame it on the bottles, but
The truth is, I ain't into excuses
Them hoes love it when they see the coupe roof-less
That's why I'm always on that new shit
'Cause, when I dropped it, hoes drop it
At the hotel and soon we got the clothes droppin
The game- they kept callin me but no stoppin
I'm on the road doin shows so you can go shoppin
Now, you lonely moved on me
In the hood word is you got a new homie
But I ain't mad, do you homie
'Cause for me its mic check 1,2 homie...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Up on a play on the way out, London, UK
Shorty at homie cryin out "won't you stay" (what's wrong with you)
She can't stand the fact I'll be back in 2 days
Top all that I attract the groupies
So she sick 'til her tummy hurts
Honey-dip don't understand how money works
She said I work too hard with no play
She don't tknow that I'm out there where them hoes stay (yeah)
Or in the back of the club all in that rosay
Rippin that bar up
End of the night I'mma alcohol her
I'm all up in the Waldorf Historia
In the suite with Miranda and Claudia
Weekend love is all that I can offer her
So when I get home I'm more like a foreigner
I'm in and out from NY to Florida
LA to TX then south of the border

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Baby girl, baby baby girl
As soon as I'm back I'll take you around the world
I know it's whack I put ya life through hell
I try to compromise with gifts babes, but still
This is real til the death of me
Cause you stuck around when there was nothing left of me
You was there for me, plus you cared for me
So forever you will always get respect from me (let's go...)

[Bridge: Letoya Luckett]
Baby your love means so much to me
With you is where I always wanna be
[lovin you makes my life complete]
You make my life complete- oh-ohhhohhh

[Chorus]

[Fade: MIMS]
She said she said she said she said she said she said
Baby girl, baby baby girl... baby girl, baby baby girl
