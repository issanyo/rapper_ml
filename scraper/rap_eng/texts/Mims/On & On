[Verse 1: M.I.M.S.]
I got one question is he still around
Been a little while now is he still in style
Is he still rockin Canterbury apparel
Is it all good when willy buried a smile
Is he still waiting around for that applaud
Is he still waiting round for that award
Last year I saw him in an accord
This year is some shit he can't afford
Has he gone poor, said he's on tour
Do he really be shutting down all stores
Where's the next one cause we want more
But what the hell are they looking for
What the hell are they looking for
So here's a little dough so what's in store
Is that a new song and what's that called
I must admit that some shit he's on

[Hook: M.I.M.S.]
On and On and On and On and On
On and On and On and On and On
On and On and On and On and On
On and On On On and On
All night All night All night All night
On and On and On and On and On
On and On and On and On and On

[Verse 2: M.I.M.S.]
Look he was conscious when he first spit
But now he's on that commercial shit
Talking bout bread every verse he gets
Talking bout head every verse he spits
But that ain't him man
That ain't Mims man
Flow Picasso
I rap so Rembrandt
Touch the stars
Cause the sky's no limit
Got too much heart I ain't no tin man
Look I'm just tryin to blow up like implants
Since three years old I've had big plans
To enhance everything I touch
Cause even when I got it man it just ain't enough

[Hook]

[Verse 3: M.I.M.S.]
Now while she over there looking at me
Ya'll be over there looking at me
It could be what ever it's gon be
But see truthfully the beefin ain't for me nah
I ain't saying I'm scared of niggas
But I'm tryna do my thang I don't care for niggas
Street killas talk heat killas
But when I'm gettin my award yous a seat filla
Oh heads it's like you deep nigga
Watches circle just know you should keep these niggas
So I keep killas on payroll
And when it pops off I trust they go
