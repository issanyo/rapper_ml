Hey shawty
Call me when you want it
I give it to you
Lawdy, usually I ain't into persuing
But hun' your body is like a shotty
Explosive, well
Now you're 'proachin'
I'm hopin' I got you open
Let's do it
(Whoop, whoop)

I am your doctor
I make house calls
I deliver in the middle of the night
I can give it you right now, right there
We can do it wherever you like it
And I will hit that

No ti-na the middle
Touch it like a fiddle
I will leave you crippled
(Whoop, whoop)
Don't play with me, girl

Whoop, whoop
When you run come around
'Cause I know you're the talk of the town, yeah
Whoop, whoop
When you run, come around
'Cause I know you're the talk of the town, yeah
(Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop)

Easy now

Just walk it gently and no break nah bone
Cool end-it-ly
You have a style of your own
Me never kno you saw ya master the saxophone

'Cause you sound like the talk of the town, yeah
I'mma lock you when you run come around, yeah

Make me whole body bubble
And me no say ya trouble when ya ready for the double

Now I don't know what you heard
But see I heard what you know
I am a musical pro
And I will hit that note
Yes, I can hit that fast
Or I can hit that slow
And yes, I box you squares out
Like its tic-tac-toe

See I don't mind when people hate
'Cause that shit's natural
So it don't matter if they talking
'Cause I get that dough
From "U.S." to Calabria
And "Y" to the Caribbean
They see me up in the BM
And they really want to be them

Easy now
No need fi go down
Easy now
No need fi go down
Rock that, run that
This where we from

Easy now
No need fi go down
Easy now
No need fi go down
Rock that run that
This where we from

Whoop, whoop
When you run
Come around
'Cause I know you're the talk of the town, yeah
(Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop)

Whoop, whoop
When you run
Come around
'Cause I know you're the talk of the town, yeah

Whoop, whoop
When you run
Come around
'Cause I know you're the talk of the town, yeah
(Whoop, whoop)
