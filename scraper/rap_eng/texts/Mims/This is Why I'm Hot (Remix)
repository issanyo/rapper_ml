So she made it very clear to mi whisper in my ear to mi
In har soft voice she seh hi in my ear to mi

Girls throwin there underwear over here to mi

[Verse 3: Mims]
Now if you take the sun and multiply it's heat
Ten times over then what you find it's me
I ain't the reason why crack turn from cocaine
I light it up then burn slow on that propane
Yes I'm a don but not the Juan from Soul Train
Teflon don I'm a boss in my own frame
I could flip it if you need it I got it for real
If you don't see it then they probably ain't got it for sale
I got the East Coast bumpin me hard
I got the West Coast bumpin me hard
The Dirty South show me love I get aired out the trunk of they car
The Midwest like homey you large
So when I pull up in the car, with the invincible roof on the coupe
And them doors swing up homey all you hear is swoosh
That's a swish, I don't miss when I'm aimin for the shot
This is why, this is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot
