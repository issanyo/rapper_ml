[Intro: M.I.M.S]
I see watching me watching you
Kylie (Kylie), Mims
Watching me
She's starring at me like she knows me (knows me)

[Verse 1: Kylie Minogue]
Weekend has arrived
Everybody's trying to find something to get into
My friends wanna go out
But I can't cancel my plans
Got a date with my baby
He's taking me out so I'm gonna catch up with you
Some other day, gotta go
Can't make him wait tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Have to make sure I'm looking hot
'Cause we're going to our favorite spot
Till the morning we're gonna rock
Boy, you knock me up, yeah

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song, dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart in two
'Cause all I see is you

[Verse 2: Kylie Minogue]
I get lost in time
When I'm looking in your eyes and we're body to body
I don't want you to rush
'Cause you're feeling like heaven to me
Follow the rhythm and keep it real close
In the dark everything goes
Nothings better than your touch
Don't stop, baby, 'cause we've just begun

[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Have to make sure I'm looking hot
'Cause we're going to our favorite spot
Till the morning we're gonna rock
Boy, you knock me up, yeah

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song, dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The Dj's got me feeling like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart in two
'Cause all I see is you

[Bridge: Kylie Minogue]
Oh, oh, oh
Please don't let me go, oh, oh
My love for you is growing more and more and more
As we move across the floor, oh, oh
(You know my name is on this record, right?)
'Cause all I see is you
'Cause all I see is you

[Rap Section: M.I.M.S]

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song, dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The Dj's got me feeling like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart in two
'Cause all I see is you
My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song, dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The Dj's got me feeling like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart in two
'Cause all I see is you
