[Intro: Sha Dirty] (MIMS)
Oh! Sha Dirty! Yo MIMS!!!! Good lookin out dog I appreciate it!!! Oh!!!

Let me talk to 'em fo' a minute though, talk to 'em Sha!

[Verse 1: Sha Dirty]
Check it!!! Shorty checkin for your boy cause I got it in
Man I'm feelin real blessed like a set of twins
I'm a show you why I'm hot like the homey MIMS
I ain't certain baby girl you could bring a friend
Got my stunnas shades on in the club (Int the club)
All yo' ass like what (Like what)
Ma don't kill me (Oh!) I got a crush on yo' body you feel me (Yeah)
I put it down on the right side down on the left side
Up on the inside high like it's cloud nine
Twenty inch leather shit bangin up in my ride
Head to toe let her know Sha Dirty so fly
Got my arm crossed smooth like I'm Billy Dee
You ain't hear this in awhile like your Mister Cee
I'm a tell you in a minute where you wanna be
The hotel motel on the count of three

Aiyyo MIMS!!! I don't really do this

She look like that chick from Clueless
Back it up lick a shotty it's the remix
I told her this is how we do it all damn night, all damn
When she walk out she dem a talk 'bout
Di gal deh pon fire, and dem caan put out
I'm suicidal, and I turn back

Hey! Wipe me off playa, wipe me off
I am the meanest cleanest from up north
I am the stylish wildest but of course
Proceed to the main course go shorty!
No pillow talk, no car talk
I'm the Knight Rider I let the car talk
Lexxus Four Sixty let the car park
Y'all all my sons I'm ya Papa
Yes I confess I's a Konvict

It's official ref with a whistle
Play foul tech's will lift you, IT'S MOVIN!!!!

[Verse 4: N.O.R.E.]
Now when I'm in the club I'm a do it like this
Double shot Petron slight chill lime twist
Shorty said buy me a drink I said this
See I ain't T-Pain girl but you could have your wish
Me and MIMS pull up in identical whips
Thought it was Deja Vu or Matrix glitch
Yeah! I play hard on the strip
And blow your whole mortgage just on One Two Fifth
Now shorty said NORE yo I love yo' song
NORE said shorty girl I love yo' thong
Now I wanna see you girl without it on
Took her to the loft you take it off we jump it off (Like this)
No shorty I don't kiss (NO MISS!!!!)
You see I live by the lake we could (FISH)
Then you get to the exit
She said she felt it ih her stomach and her ribs now she breathless

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
Like this, I'm in the stretch shorty do it like this
Up in the stretch shorty do it like this
I got shorty mayne do it like this, like this

[Verse 5: MIMS]
Look! It's seems like I gotta make a enemy
To sell another record in this industry
Or it seems like I gotta be righteous, to get on that five mic list
I gotta write like that and not like this
I ain't hot to them, cause I'm not with Jay and I'm not with Em
See I bop to Fox and I rock to Kim
And TS is hot but I'm not with them
I'm a New York cat and I love the South
I got a New York bop but with a West Coast bounce
Mix that with a little bit of Reid and Cham
International MIMS find me in France
London, Japan, Mulan, Sudan
I don't need to smoke weed I'm in Amsterdam
Try to figure my figures I plead the fifth
But if you wanna get down then you gotta proceed
