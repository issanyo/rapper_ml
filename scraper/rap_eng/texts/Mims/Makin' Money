Me I'm makin' money, me I'm makin' money
Me I'm makin' money, me, me I'm makin' money
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all

Mr. Darth Vader I am your father
Gallardo Spider call it Peter Parker
You can be an actor, I'd rather be the author
Title of the story, 'The Making Of A Martyr'

World full of jealousy, tell me why I bother?
You're a bench warmer, hatin' on the starter
Watch what you say to me, get it put on ya
Fucked by a chick in a skirt named Karma

Word I'm a mama, I ain't for the drama
I'm married to the game to which I owe the honor
Get my feet wet, no I am no Madonna
Though I'm still emergin' I feel like a virgin

I love nice things so I am into splurgin'
One life to live, tomorrow ain't for certain
You're my understudy, you need to quit workin'
So I start a show until they close curtains, yeah

Me I'm makin' money, me I'm makin' money
Me I'm makin' money, me, me I'm makin' money
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all

And that's why my outfit match my new whip
And that's why the new whip match my new crib
And that's why the world they know who I are
'Cause I go hard, I go so, so hard

I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard

Fresher than the corner star veggie
I am fresh out the deli daily
Twenty plus years, I'ma product of the 80's
That's why they love me, that's you hate me

We can talk money but how much can you make me?
Probably not a dime, you ain't got shit to say to me
Vegas money, homie I bet it all
I clean house like a week full of chores

Yeah, you got a jab but you weak at the jaw
You need to think twice before you get injured
My infra red you will infer
Plus I get paper without printers

My money so long that it get so borin'
Couldn't finish countin' when I got off tourin'
Survival of the fit, theory of Charles Darwin
My flow so mobile this is my callin'

Me I'm makin' money, me I'm makin' money
Me I'm makin' money, me, me I'm makin' money
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all

And that's why my outfit match my new whip
And that's why the new whip match my new crib
And that's why the world they know who I are
'Cause I go hard, I go so, so hard

I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard

Joe Clark, I am who they lean on
Ice shining you can call them xenon
I don't use a lot of energy to get this money
In other words I guess I'm gettin' my green on

Gettin' my lean on 600 hybrid
Seats, do do brown that's my fly shit
I said, do do brown, that's fly shit
Another over your head line they y'all missed

Keep my logic hustle while y'all gossip
Get money let's chill on some god shit
If ain't second to none I'm still top six
And it's only 'cause I'm trying to be modest

Me I'm makin' money, me I'm makin' money
Me I'm makin' money, me, me I'm makin' money
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all

And that's why my outfit match my new whip
And that's why the new whip match my new crib
And that's why the world they know who I are
'Cause I go hard, I go so, so hard

I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard
I go hard, I go so, so hard

Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all
Dollar, dollar bills, dollar, dollar, dollar bills, y'all
