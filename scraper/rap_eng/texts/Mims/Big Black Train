Dont Worry Bout A Car

Ill Scoop You Up Wherever That You Are
From Under Your Mans Arm Hes Just That Lame
And We Gon Be Rollin Rollin Choo Choo Chooin

(Verse:)

But Her She Got A Thing For That Big Black Train
Not Just A Metaphor To How Im Ridin On Tracks
From Up North To Down South Wit Niggas Ridin In Lack's
Since I Dropped I Got The Whole World Ridin Ma Back
To Much Chit Chat Is He Back Pack Or Is He Gimmicky

Bitches All In My Pockets I Know Alot Of Hoes Too
Ill Yellin All Aboard They Takin Off They Clothes Too

And For What They Lookin For A Ride On My Big Black Train

(Chorus:)
Shortie Wanna Ride

They Beggin For A Ride On My Big Black Train

(Verse:)
I Ain't Got Spinners Im A Winner By Nature
I Can't Stand A Broad Thas Just Into Ma Paper
You Find Me In The Club Sippin Henny No Chaser
If I Dont Hit It Now I Bet Im Hittin That Lata
See When I Swing Thru The Bling I Bring Thru
Brightin Up The Room Turnin Everything Blue
And Everything New Is Everything New
Can't Choose To And Everything You Ain't Used To
Now Have You Eva Seen A Nigga Lay His Game Down
Hop Off The Leer Jet Come Thru And Bring The Train Round
Im Just Playin With The Game See Its A Shame Now
They Say Im Cocky Since Industry Know My Name Now
But Now Its Back On Board See Off To My Train We Go
Check A Id Make Sure That This Thing Legal
She Gave Me Head Crack And I Ain't Talkin Bout Cee-Lo
