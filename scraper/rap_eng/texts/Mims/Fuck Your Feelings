[Verse 1]
They needed proof I aced the test
Niggas just wanna see me depressed
Go so hard I can't even rest
Fuck this shit who needs success
I'm falling back, carry the weight of the world on my back
Trying to figure out where the real niggas at
They don't even know where in the world I'm at and they penny me
I'm in Amsterdam, I'm in Italy
Just left Sudan I'm in Sicily
I kill these niggas consistently
The only thing left alive is chivalry
But I don't do women, I don't do children
Y'all do condos, I do buildings
Cook beef and y'all dudes grillin'
Novocaine nigga fuck your feelings
Come through, through the mood ceilin'
These niggas like, "He's mood killin'"
I'm panorama, y'all hand to hand
And I own the spot, I'm through dealin'
I'm through dealin'
Cause y'all ain't through squealin'
Y'all tin man, you couldn't buy a heart
But we die hard, nigga Bruce Willis
I'm the true realness
They want sense of me though?
I die for my ego
I'm on some Emmett Till shit

[Hook]
Lean hard, brim tilted
Money long like I'm Conrad Hilton
Purest coke like it's Brita filtered
I said it before nigga, fuck your feelings
Fuck your feelings
Fuck Your feelings

[Verse 2]
You wanted the proof son is the truth
My floors your ceiling the sun is my roof
Your guns go pap my shits go boom
Picture me runnin' from you
Tell me the game that you're runnin'
Knowing you're paraplegic
Knowing as soon as you see me you run in your house
All y'all doing is runnin' your mouth
The shit y'all talkin' has got to stop
You sound like one big paradox
If y'all got 15 minutes of fame
Then my shit a 24 hour clock, gots
Niggas tryna plot
Haters on the watch
Followin' a whip
So i gotta spin this shit around the block
Till it end up dead
When a gun go pop
What the nigga Puff said
Can't stop won't stop
Mo' money mo' problems yeah i gotta whole lot
Girls lovin' my flash like a photo op
Got 'em waiting in line if she try to act up
I cut that bitch like photoshop
Shit I'm the shit
Like porta pots
I order drops
Just so I could ignore the lots

[Hook]
