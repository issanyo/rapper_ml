Chorus:
Ohhhh, Can anybody hear me, Cause I?ve been doooooooown, that road, so long. 3x
Mims: I?m trying to clean up my ways
Some times I feel like I can?t
When I repent all my sins
Then I just do it again
I never wanted to be a regular nigga
No funds, chased by crack hittas
So I poured my soul out, like liquor
But I guess ya?ll niggas didn?t get the point, like scissors
I told cats I went 2 church and got saved
Old heads looking , like ?NO?, do not say
Called my old hoes, told them I?m gone stop pimping
They looking at me like, u mine as well stop living
Trying to rid the demons from my system
But da game won?t let me, it?s steady pulling me in
But I thank u, since u kept a nigga breathing, eating, sleeping
Been up another week, another weekend

Days, hours, minutes, seconds
Feeling like I could, never pay u back 4 this blessing
So when a nigga pray, I don?t pray for wealth
I pray for my family, I pray for health
If anything, I just pray we get closer
To the point, you become my main focus
Focus on, every word I say, I hope you soak this
The realist rhyme a nigga ever wrote is, this
Ohhhh, Can anybody hear me, Cause I?ve been doooooooown, that road, so long. 3x
Mims: I?m trying to clean up my ways
Some times I feel like I can?t
When I repent all my sins
Then I just do it again
Ohhhh, Can anybody hear me, Cause I?ve been doooooooown, that road, so long. 3x
