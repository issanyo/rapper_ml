I did you wrong, I admit I did
I did you wrong, I admit I did
But I, I'm facing the rest of my life alone
I did you-I did you wrong-wrong
Ohh wrong-wrong
I did you wrong-wrong
Ohh wrong-wrong (I know)
I did, I did you wrong-wrong (Mims)
Ohh wrong-wrong (Push Play)
But I-I-I-
(There's some shit I gotta get off my chest
Shame on me, listen, how we gonna do this y'all)

I hit it once right after I dissed her
Then after that tried rap to a sister
Same day, I had her ass in the bed y'all
Same day and she giving me head y'all
I don't lie, I'm a player for real
I learn the game, so I'm playing the field
I tell the truth, I don't fill her with lies
They feel on my hair, I feel on thier thighs
It's a tradeoff baby, it ain't a surprise
You call me a 4, she call me a 5
That's 30 to skeet, and 30 to slide
And according to me it's plenty of time, so

I don't know what you tripping for
We done went through this shit before
A few women ain't going to like this song
So I apologize now cuz

1-	I did you, I did you wrong-wrong (I know I did you wrong)
	Ohh wrong-wrong (That's why I wrote this song)
	I did you wrong-wrong (I know I did you wrong)
	Ohh wrong-wrong (That's why I wrote this song)
	I did you, I did you wrong-wrong (I know I did you wrong)
	Ohh wrong-wrong (That's why I wrote this song)
	I, I, I did you wrong (But I ain't' done yet, listen)

I know this dame by the name of Susie
Always in my ear like she ain't no groupie
She like, 'We don't gotta rush tonight
We can talk a lil' bit and watch a movie'
I'm like 'Baby, I ain't K-Ci or JoJo'
I'm trying to see where this bottle of Hypno' go
I'm tyring to take this to the mo' and slide
You show a lil' thigh, I show a lil' mojo
I admit, I had to hit her with game
But as soon as I hit it, I SPLIT!
Now she sitting back mad, throwing dirt on my name
Upset like 'He ain't shit'

I don't know what you tripping for
We done went through this shit before
A few women ain't going to like this song
So I apologize now cuz

Repeat 1

It was Keisha, Pam, Tina and Stace
Mary, Kay, Elena and Faith
Sheena from 8th, Talia, Tamia
Shia, Tia, Juanita, Rasheeda
Beth, Tisha, Ruby, Judy
Oh, fuck her, she never gave me no booty
I kicked her out, sent her back to her crib
Cuz she was running her mouth about me eating her coochie
Let's not forget about Michelle
She tried to max out my cards like Blue Cantrell
Some 'Hit 'Em Up Styles' shit
She was my down bitch
Until she heard I was fucking some out of town bitch

I don't know what you tripping for
We done went through this shit before
A few women ain't going to like this song
So I apologize now cuz

Repeat 1 to fade
