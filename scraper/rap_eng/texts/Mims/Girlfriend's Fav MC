I Wanna Be A Little Bit More Like, Like Laid Back
See, Y'all Do Is Cool But Me Homie, I'm Calmer
Like What Surround Her Neck? I Charmed Her
Me I Milked The Cow, I'm A Farmer

Her Guards Up But I Removed The Armor
You Just Seem To Be The Part Of The Problem
Introducin' Me, The Solution
I Rocked It Just Like I'm From Houston

No, Not The Ball Playa, More Like The Mall Playa
Soon As I Touch Down, I Shut Down The Store Playa
Look, I'm Already On Playa
See, I'm Like The Stars In The Sky Early Morn' Playa

So Just Listen To The Song
So We Could End All Back And Forth Like Ping Pong
She Is My Queen That Makes Me King Kong
I'm The Leader Of The Jungle Dog
Ain't Nothin' Left To Say But, Hey I'm The Bong

Don't Be Mad At Me 'coz I'm Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc
She's All Meant To Me Like The Wrist And The Bracelet
And I Ain't Need No One Of She, She's Beggin' Me To Chase It
Don't Be Mad At Me 'coz I'm Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc

Lets Just Say That We Slid Off
Gallardo Spider So We Can Take The Lid Off
She Just Made That Jump Like Cris Cross
Right In The Passenger Side You **** Off

Ain't My Fault I Just Handle My Biz
You Can't Handle Your Wiz, So It Is
What It's Gonna Be? I'm In The Sun Sittin' Under Palm Trees
Lookin' Life Big

I Won't Hate, I'll Just Tell Her How It Is
If I Show You How I Live, You Would Think I Was Hidin'
And Mic Is My Trident, I'm Poseidon
And She Is My Afro Deity, Stop Lyin'

You Not As Fly As I'm
And Some Say I'm The Flyest Plane On The Runway
Some Day I Would Be The One Day Called King
And Till That Time Your Girlfriend Can Call Me

Don't Be Mad At Me 'coz I'm Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc
She's All Meant To Me Like The Wrist And The Bracelet
And I Ain't Need No One Of She, She's Beggin' Me To Chase It
So Don't Be Mad At Me 'coz I'm Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc

I Didn't Come Here To Brag
No Amount Of Money Could Match With My Swag
You Know I Got Wrapped In The Bag
Livin' In The Past
And I'm The Future Do, All Washed Up Like The Guadalupe

Your Own Home Team Won't Root For You
And That's 'coz They Look For Me
So Truthfully As Truly Yours
Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc

Don't Be Mad At Me 'coz I'm Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc
She's All Meant To Me Like The Wrist And The Bracelet
And I Ain't Need No One Of She, She's Beggin' Me To Chase It
So Don't Be Mad At Me 'coz I'm Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc

Don't Be Mad At Me 'coz I'm Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc
She's All Meant To Me Like The Wrist And The Bracelet
And I Ain't Need No One Of She, She's Beggin' Me To Chase It
So Don't Be Mad At Me 'coz I'm Your Girlfriends Favorite Mc
