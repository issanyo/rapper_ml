I used to think the better way was to get away
Chasing sunshine tryna put the leather away
When your wheel of fortune is just a letter away
And the chick you been with you tryna let her away

For that Vanna White chick, load the tall van with white chicks
Hit the hotel, hit the light switch
While I was out tryna spend a night with
I was the one she was tryna spend her life with

I could've sworn the money wouldn't change my motto
But why want a little when you can have a lotto
Why sip the glass when you can have the bottle
We live for the now but what about tomorrow?

I got sunshine on my face but I'm not happy
I am so senseless, I lost all senses, I'm telling you that
I'm not happy, I got my eyes so closed so I can see you
I got nothing if I don't have you

Blinded by the fame I can hardly see her face
She blinded by the love, she can hardly see mistakes
But there were mistakes which we can't replace
But visualize the place maybe you can relate

For her I give my arm hoping she amputates
But still it ain't enough she like it's way too late
But I'm like wait and she like she did
She said, she tired of waiting

It's already been years and there's been tears shed
I was gone 'til November then I show on that Learjet
Like yeah, I'm rich man, I really don't care
Throw a little money in the air

Blinded by the cars, I was blinded by the ice
Millionaire lens, I was blinded by the lights
One look at her face and I'm reminded by the life
That I used to live that she used to like, like

I got sunshine on my face but I'm not happy
I am so senseless, I lost all senses, I'm telling you that
I'm not happy, I got my eyes so closed so I can see you
I got nothing if I don't have you

All we do is argue, all we do is fight
I'm just tryin' to get it back to where shit is suffice
But it will never be that she said
And you can never be that prepared as long as you're aware

She don't know how to stop the hurt, so for now I'm just a tear
And since I was a jerk she wish I would disappear
But that's what got us here and that's we gotta go
You reap what you sow, so I'ma let her know

I am so senseless, I lost all senses, I'm telling you that
I'm not happy, I got my eyes so closed so I can see you
I got nothing if I don't have you

I am so senseless I lost all senses I'm telling you that
If I don't have you, if I don't have you
I got nothing if I don't have you
