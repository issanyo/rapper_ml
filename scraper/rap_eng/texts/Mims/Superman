Hold up
Wait
Look up in the sky
It's a bird
It's a plane
No it's me
Cuz I'm fly, I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly
I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly
I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly
I'm fly I'm fly I'm
I come through spot
Stun is on the eyes
Fitted to the side
20's on the ride
Some say I'm fly
They say I'm the best
Catch me in the sky with the S on my chest
Chicks call me superman
Super duper lover
Just in case it rain
Keep the coup ville for covers
Unless it rain dollars
They your talking money
Bein broke ain't a joke
Bein rich must be funny
And me I'm tryin ta laugh
Count a lil cash
Walk in, walk out, grab shorty with the ass
Take her back to my pad
But no not the crib
I mean the helicopter
Let me show you how I live
See I can take you high
Spend a little dough
Shut them all down
Take you out them plain clothes
Baby I can make you fly
Do it in the day
So tell me if you down
Baby what you got to say
She said hold up
Wait
Look up in the sky
It's a bird
It's a plane
No it's me
Cuz I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly
I'm fly I'm fly I'm
Hold up
Wait
Look up in the sky
It's a bird
It's a plane
No it's me
Cuz I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly
I'm fly I'm fly I'm
Now tell me what ya like
Cause I can make it life
Them otha niggas did it wrong
See I can make it right
Had ya neck filled with ice
Juicy Couture velour jumpsuit
Princess for the night
Keep ya draped in the best
Blue marine dress
They call me Mr. Fly I keep the S on my chest
See I move faster than a bullet
So I can hold ya down
I could jump big buildings in a single bound
That's why they call me superman
Super duper lover
Imagine what the boy Mims do beneath the covers
I ain't 702
But you complete my stillo
Look up in the sky
Got you flyin in the G4
See we fly and better yet we soar
And it's lonely at the top
But the bottom is so boing
Bottom of the pot
All niggers in sole order whenever they see me like
The people wind up on me like
Hold up
Wait
Look up in the sky
It's a bird
It's a plane
No it's me
Cuz I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly
I'm fly I'm fly I'm
Hold up
Wait
Look up in the sky
It's a bird
It's a plane
No it's me
Cuz I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly
I'm fly I'm fly I'm
Call me superman super superman
Hold up
Wait
Look up in the sky
Call me superman super superman
Call me Mr. Fly I keep the S on my chest
Call me superman super superman
Hold up
Wait
Look up in the sky
Call me superman super superman
No no no it's me
Cuz I'm fly, I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly
I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly

I'm fly I'm fly I'm
