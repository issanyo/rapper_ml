(Intro)
Let's get it!
Ha Ha!
I know you like
Wonderin right now like, what the hell is this right?
Heh heh heh heh!!! I guess you bout to see right now

(bell rings)

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, Move-Move if you wanna move
Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna

I don't undrestand how can I have so many ha-ters
Knowin I'm there father like my name is Darth Va-der
I can get you hemmed up while I'm bein tay-lored
Then I slide off to the side like a fa-der
Homie I'm the president, governor and ma-yor
I control everything, like a dic-ta-tor
Get you bix marked up, turn you into va-pors
If you got a problem get you swallowed like a cha-ser
Model on my arm no homie I don't have to pay her
All I have to do is tell her where I wanna take her
Catch us out in Italy, then we in Jamai-ca
Caught up in the rapture, like Anita Ba-ker
When I roll up on you niggas like a ska-ter
Move if you wanna when you see that red la-ser
No matter how you move bet that infrared will chase ya
Then I keep it movin, homie see you la-ter, Mims!

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, Move-Move if you wanna move
Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna

I'm tryin to keep it cool, if you wanna, you can move, if you wanna
Tryin to have a little fun, maybe move a couple numbers but
When you movin numbers, all the haters start to wonder
Then they talk behind your back, in the breath they speakin under
Man I'm hot, like the sun, like the middle of the summer
Strike down in a flash, nigga you can call me thunder
Chicks call me Phil Drummond cuz I give 'em Diff'rent Strokes
Bahh Bahh Bahh Bahh, beat it up like a drummer
They can call it one-hit wonder, but I guess that means I'm one-up
Light a match, play with fire, that just means you gon' get burned up
In the river, where you turn up, 'cause they see I'm on the come-up
But it's our, turn, now, if you want it, take it from us
I don't need no goons by me, if you want it come and try me
We can do this broad day, in the middle of the lobby
Niggas say that they the shit, when they barely just a potty
When they problems turn to prolly and they prolly's turn to sorry
Tell em

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, Move-Move if you wanna move
Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
