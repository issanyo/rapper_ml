Tonight I was walkin in the street
They took my phone and money
Now all I have is this beat
You can't take that from me
F*ck this F*ck that, F*ck you, F*ck my life

Oye loca, I am loco
I sip it on Red Bull
Mix with that coco
I'm the most sleeped off
The floor needs no dogs
I'm on flashing, I got on my polo

We party hard, all f*cking night
Drink till I'm drunk
You're f*cking right
You're right
Stars, them flashin lights
And back to working and morning f*ck my life

Tonight I was walkin in the street
They took my phone and money
Now all I have is this beat
You can't take that from me
F*ck this F*ck that, F*ck you, F*ck my life

Put your drinks in the air
Put your drinks in the air, air
If you don't care, if you don't care
If you, if you don't care

Oye loca, I am loco
Sippin on, con agua de coco
So that is Miami we take over the bongo
Come on mister..we're ready to go go

We party hard, all night

You come so right
Mister scotch party
You think I'm drunk go get my car

Put your drinks in the air
Put your drinks in the air
Put your drinks in the air, air
If you don't care, if you don't care
If you, if you don't care

Loca mia, donde anda metida
Que te ando buscando
De noche y de dia
Loca mia, donde anda metida
Que te ando buscando
De noche y de dia

Man I just lost my job
Disconnected my phone
Tell em leave me alone
We just came here to party
Tryin get in my zone
Tell em I just blew my money
On a bottle of Patron

Put your drinks in the air
Put your drinks in the air
Put your drinks in the air, air
If you don't care, if you don't care
If you, if you don't care

Put your drinks in the air
Put your drinks in the air
Put your drinks in the air, air
If you don't care, if you don't care
If you, if you don't care

Loca mia, donde anda metida
Que te ando buscando
De noche y de dia
Loca mia, donde anda metida
Que te ando buscando
De noche y de dia

Man I just lost my job
Disconnected my phone
Tell em leave me alone
We just came here to party
Tryin get in my zone
Tell em I just blew my money
On a bottle of Patron
