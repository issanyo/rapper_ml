[Hook]
I'm on a leash
Nobody Closer I got them on freeze
Yea yea
They know I'm a beast
Coz all of my haters are vibing the least

I'm on a leash
Nobody Closer I got them on freeze
Yea yea
They know I'm a beast
Coz all of my haters are vibing the least

[Chorus]
I'm on a leash x8

[Verse 1]
They cut me out
I get jiggy with it coz I stole the show
Ninty minutes
Now they know I have no match
Im a flame boy I have no match

Schooling niggas to the highest class
Name bigger with the biggest mass
Don't tell me I'm joking
This ain't no video FASH

Dropping verses like the pastor did it
What a shot coz I made it vivid

Ppl coming n I'm dealing with it
I got the sauce on the margin
Look at the teeth
They be grinning for beef
I be messing cheese
.oh Gawd
My goodness look what they
Did to me
Now I'm a star
They got me on leash
Certain ppl will be hitting unleash
You know I will make it
Copy cats will take me
When its over you will take me
Oh Gawd

[Hook]
I'm on a leash
Nobody Closer I got them on freeze
Yea yea
They know I'm a beast
Coz all of my haters are vibing the least

I'm on a leash
