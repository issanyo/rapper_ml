Doughboy

Cos of the language barrier they say we can’t make it
No entrance fees, no coupons and no tickets
Lets face it, I ain’t mad I’m having fun again
I’m not in south korea but I’m a running man

Running from the norm, going strong, what you gonna do
Doughboy, king of the beats, who you and your crew?
This is live rap music, now who recording this?
I was on tv, Christmas eve, winning awards and shit

Flashback to 2011
When my soul beats were all they had as a reference
On the charts at HMV, the sequel to ABC
With the video by the beach, yo we sold a lot of CDs

But I’m just nobody, no Lambos, ferraris
But girls still think we hot, I’m pumped up like Reebok
Just give me top 3 spots, settle that, I’m chill
And this part the beats stops, holla back, I’m ill

Ibalik natin hiphopan
Tama na payabangan
Etoh ang 2.5 panibago nyong paguusapan
Paiinitin natin lalo parang 2.0
Makineg ka samin ng maige  para malaman mo

Buksan ang tenga at ipikit ang mga mata
Sarap ng pakiramdam parang humithit ng marijuana
Di na bago sa pandineg , di parin pa dadaig 
MGA KONTRA GILITAN NA NG LEEG

Pagkat nagsama sama nanaman kami
At di ka pwedeng tumabi
Walang talent walang skills
Dyan ka lang pare

Its Eazy Mathafuckin 2 Point 5
Binabalik hiphopin' at Goodvibes

Solido ang galaw
Halimaw bumitaw
Ibang klase ang tirada pag kami na ang humataw
Sasakupin ang buong mundo

Mala illuminati ang dating
Nasa amin ngaun ang RAP GAME!

Now pass it to the B Swaging over sea
佢地奇怪咦?! 點解無法子 - 把持自己態度
Freestyle you see how we live now release 包你知
點解呢班低B繼續為個文化堅持 - 到路線偏移個腦純天然~

Smoke weed no more but we - 得到既銀紙~
錢揾錢大過天 you know i mean~~
我地夠惡 - 佢地咁博 - 不過無人理啵
全部老作 - 依家到我 Cos we don't stop the real talk they fall fall...

我地係 - 社會大學HipHop系既博士學位
你無計 - 就睇住黎揾我傾計 ?!?!
打關係 - 無所謂 - 無阻滯 - 無收費 - 無偷雞
但最好係有囡女砌。靠支咪就有錢洗~~~

再 - 睇吓 - 個地底下 - 其他既rapper - 有幾咁鬼馬
點駕馭? - Rather be harmony 加多D melody
It's fantasy~~~inside a monster !!!~

D.B.E. 852, I represent the illest team
Built for this game we climbin as the realest emcees
Cyphers and tapes we recreated the whole scene
Low key but we murderous like an O.D. (Overdose)

Oh please you hatin me but your girls keen
She showin interest but too bad she dun interest me
Keep on yappin you just steppin on your self-esteem
Homie I shine no matter how you try to intervene

Realer than real im makin the realest feel afraid
Force you to choke on your own rhymes phrase after phrase
We on stage im in that spotlight they would always praise
This game don welcome you better start digging your grave

Dreamin in what we believe in I stay schemin now im achieving
I be speedin through every single opportunity that im seein
Every beings got his reason well homie it is my season
Fake rappers I be feastin on never droppin till I stop breathin

J.T

Ive always started from the top, i didn't start from the bottom
Im a Young killer rapper , bitch imma fuckin smack ya
Free stylin on this verse, this is ain't a gifted curse
I'mma show you what i got, i'mma show you what you not

I started at 4, people they wanted more
They beggin on their knees, I went like bitch please
King of this game now, theres nothing you can say now
I was nothing before, now moneys all on the floor

Got swag like bieber, I be spreadin ma fever
Yes, im J.T you might think im a griever
Nah bro im just a young big achiever
You ain't important , u getting all your shit from utorrent

I'm labeled the real thang, while your labeled the shit thang
You're fake as fuck, all u really wanna do is suck dick
Man, what the fuck is wrong with this chick
Oh wait my bad its a dude acting gay and all mad

SAiNT

To understand both sides, i had to play with the devil
Welcome to my story where the good meets the evil
So fall back, pipe down and witness, illest on your list, i'm your only rap realist

I find myself scribbling my god damn books of rhymes again
Who gives life, no other than, i provide this game with oxygen
So bitch quit it, i ain't playin' around when i say i'm gon intoxicate it
Prime everyday, til' the day i die, pilin' bodies decapitated

You don't wanna mess with my type of razor sharp wordplay and flowplay
Ain't nobody can extinguish, when i have it man, i'll have it my way
When i rampage i damage leakage line-ups in overdosage
More than enough where nobody survives, extinguish you dead or alive

No mercy, yo'all know that
SAiNT, Highness, go mix that
Motherfucker's want beef when i'm the only rapper stylin' street style on em
When the evil sides of me both encounter cascade
This is what you get when two elements Crossfade

Lyrics: 你知你白痴，扮無知扮得理又好鬼死似。d巴黎乞丐，掃錢曬命，但係冇quali！now ok算，捉住你個crew，續個一齊串，因為正係識講英文，擺到明會輸。ok講到d垃圾你地同名同姓,drop some (dj scratch) rhymes 。我就一夜明星，但係就仲未成名
So allow me to twist your mind up

I'm back at it
Like a crack addict
And I ain't gonna stop
Cuz you brothers wack at it
And it's making me mad
Cuz you fellas rapping it
Thn getting your back stab
By same brats that u rapping with

Jabbing it
Being back at it
I'm stacking it
Stacking it the blueprints with some cash in it
I mean do u even know what the fuck is happening?

Pastor, with some heads up
Said I'm ill with this
Sin songs on a sea saw
Got me wondering
你傻定我傻 d?

Cuz I have been
Chasing my dreams
From 9 to
Another freaking 9
Ill minded
Mother fker come find me
This a mad city
Run run
Keep hiding

I is the Commando
Cold blooded
