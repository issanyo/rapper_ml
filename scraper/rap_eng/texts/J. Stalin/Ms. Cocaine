[Intro: Nashawn]
Uh, all my drug dealers
Whether you a nigga or a girl
(Uh) in the struggle (uh)
But I treat it like a bitch (uh)

[Verse One: Nashawn]
Look at the girl, she got the world on her shoulders
Raised in the ghetto and she still gettin' colder
Early in the mornin' hustlin', she a soldier
Know about that flippin' and stack chips, but who showed her?
How to water, got scorched the cook, the Coke
She don't like a cookie, yo she spend a boulder
No loose change, she like the money that fold when it came
In the Spring time, Summer, or the Winter, she came, came
In the hood, we love you Ms. Cocaine
I always kept you bundled 'til the fiends came
And let you get off, and cop you again
Ma, you the reason why the block poppin'
All the hustlers give you utmost respect
'Cause you help us buy .9's and tec's
We love you, even though you killed a lot of people
And got a lot of my niggas in jail, we still need you

[Hook: Nashawn]
In the hood we love Ms. Cocaine
In the ghetto we love you Lady Heroin
We think about you, 'cause you helped us get change & chains
A lot of things change, since you came

In the hood we love Ms. Cocaine
In the ghetto we love you Lady Heroin
We think about you, 'cause you helped us get change & chains
A lot of things change, since you came

[Verse Two: Nashawn]
Lady Heroin has gained a weight
Look a 'lil too diesel
And it's foul what you do to my people
Got my pops all leaned over, to you in the needle
Gotta take care of 'em now, can't leave 'em, he need you
Let 'em rely on the boy, that's what we call a girl
Stay away from her, she have you in a whole another world
Everybody grind her, sometimes she goes both ways
Her and her friend Bonita
She a cheater, lightin' up the high
If you pimp her, I'll have you extra fly
It's just fast or die, who you provide to
In the ghetto we love you Lady Heroin
I always kept you bundled 'til the fiends came
You got my dawgs, fifty to life, and that ain't right
Without you, I'ma be alright
'Cause all my niggas die hustle wit you, hold yo head
And keep a watch for the.., watch for the feds

[Hook: Nashawn]
In the hood we love Ms. Cocaine
In the ghetto we love you Lady Heroin
We think about you, 'cause you helped us get change & chains
A lot of things change, since you came

In the hood we love Ms. Cocaine
In the ghetto we love you Lady Heroin
We think about you, 'cause you helped us get change & chains
A lot of things change, since you came

[Verse Three: Nashawn]
She got me on the run, cops ran up on my crib for her
I said she ain't here, they still lookin' for her
--Rumblin', wreckin' shit, rippin' up my fly shit
I said - "Ain't no Alicia Keys in here"
They goin' hard, searchin' for this broad I'm suppose to have
Fuckin' up my rest, they goin' up hard in my path, tried to cuff me
It's about to get ugly, I grabbed the cop gun after he snuffed me
I'm goin' all out, *blaow* *blaow*, two shots blew
One cop down, one cop through
Then I boated out, got to get out of the country
Somebody done set me up, lovely, lovely

Oh, how I love you Ms. Cocaine
You had me up in the game before the cops came
Oh, how I love you Lady Heroin
You had me up in the game before the feds came

[Hook: Nashawn]
In the hood we love Ms. Cocaine
In the ghetto we love you Lady Heroin
We think about you, 'cause you helped us get change & chains
A lot of things change, since you came

In the hood we love Ms. Cocaine
In the ghetto we love you Lady Heroin
We think about you, 'cause you helped us get change & chains
A lot of things change, since you came
