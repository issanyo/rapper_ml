[Verse 1: D.R.E]
I'm a monkey in a white world
And i'm hungry for the right world
Segregation is a bitch
All the white people rich
And the colored people aren't heard
Now my
Now my minds a sinner
But look closely because my hearts a winner
And when i come into the spot
Everybody gonna
Gonna have no choice but to call the cops
Yeah, they'll call the cops
Because i'm a black man
Prophesied from the white man
Everybody wanna
Everybody wanna dream like MML the King
But ain't no body wanna sign a negrow
And i'm grown now
My mind set fast, it won't slow down
Now people gonna frown that in years from now a black man may soon wear the crown
Gonna, gonna..

[Hook: Kal]

[Verse 2: D.R.E]
It's hard to comprehend what it's like being black in this world we live in
Seperation by color, it is nothing like no other
Every brother is a brother and that's how it should be
Me? i don't give a fuck
Everything i said and i based it off luck
Your lyrics? suck
White man coming at your door, duck
So many lyrcis that i'm gonna write a book
Verse 2 it was wrote for you
No many people have the gift like me and you do
Its true
Now this was wrote for you, so take it in, grab a pen, note it down, like you wear the crown
'cause this is survival of the fittest
But if you ain't fit, who's gonna tell the difference?
It don't matter if you're a black man, white man, asian man or even if your name is dan, it's all the same to me man
Imma save you, if you save me, man
Like

[Verse 3: D.R.E]
I'm laying down in my bed
I got all these fucking thoughts running through my head
Like how i've been doubted all my life
Wondering if i should grab the knife
Nah
I'm not about suicide
Just know i'm hear for you
I don't want you to cry NO!
Don't fucking think about saying bye NO!
Just know that i'll save you
As long as you save me
I'll save you
