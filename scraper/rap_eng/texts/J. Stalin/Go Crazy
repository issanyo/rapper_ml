[Intro]
Haters they always talk about me (unha)
Fake thugs get the fuck from around me
I wish a motherfucker try to clown me
They scream ain't you Spenzo and they surround me

[Hook:]
This for me niggas and my bitches going crazy
If you self made scream I'm who made me
Chi-town streets is what raised me
They yelling ain't you Spenzo and going crazy
For Rich Crew they going crazy
Nigga forget you we going crazy
I throw my set up and going crazy
For us they going nuts going crazy

[Verse 1:]
Baby my flex game so amazing
Shout out to my set they go crazy (RICH CREW!)
Me like women who was born up in the 80's
Show no love to a bitch who wouldn't play me
We going nuts, where the fuck Meech at?
Red bone, legs long, boy I keep that
Niggas talk when I ain't around just know I peep that
But when he see me he be all on my meat sack
We do this all night, get it bussin
I just meet a full frame mommy, rush in
If he talk too much, need to hush up
If they call too much me dont trust em
Where the  gifts, now a-day's everybody ride
Tryin to serve nowadays everybody try
From the kids on up everybody strapped
They talkin shit up in the club and everybody snap

[Hook:]
This for me niggas and my bitches going crazy
If you self made scream I'm who made me
Chi-town streets is what raised me
They yelling ain't you Spenzo and going crazy
For Rich Crew they going crazy
Nigga forget you we going crazy
I throw my set up and going crazy
For us they going nuts going crazy

[Verse 2:]
You ain't know we was raised on the low end
So you know when it's low end or no end
And to make it out me just hoping
I got a strong OG call her Rosie
Light blunts and keep 'em rolling
(Hold on) (Hold on)
Two white cups I keep em' pouring
Ever since I made a name for my self(I go by Spenz)
It dont matter who she is just know she goin
Put you self up in my shoes
If you was me what would you do?
If your name rings bells
And a female told you "Baby I'll go through hell just to meet the old you"(fuck that)
Which made me question when the fuck did I go new
I sent a message when the fuck did It go through
The motherfuckers better get it in they head
Rich crew we up next they don't know(Bitch,Bitch,Bitch,Bitch)

[Hook]
This for me niggas and my bitches going crazy
If you self made scream I'm who made me
Chi-town streets is what raised me
They yelling ain't you Spenzo and going crazy
For Rich Crew they going crazy
Nigga forget you we going crazy
I throw my set up and going crazy
For us they going nuts going crazy

(I see a nigga they say ain't you Spenzo) (Little Bitch)
