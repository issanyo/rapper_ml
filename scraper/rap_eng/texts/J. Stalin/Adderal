This heart of mine built from twine
My Life wasn't mine
It was driven by speed
My  creep feed
Taking life in the backseat
Just doing the task sheet
Momma don't ask me she passed she
Just pass me the black bean
I try not to act mean
But it ain't happening

Always yelling for help but my pain stays the same every time I'm calling their cell

Now the sting of the nicotine
It calls for me into the limousine
Taking it like its my vaccine
She asking me but I be acting
My life is already ending
But pain is always undending
The sweet end I'm so fucking tempted
