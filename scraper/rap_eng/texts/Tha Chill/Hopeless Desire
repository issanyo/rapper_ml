Baby, baby yea
Should I let you break my heart just one more time
You did it once why the hell would you do it twice
Maybe you learned your lesson
Maybe I'm second guessing life
Or I'm naive just looking for the sunshine

Being with you is like driving on flat tires
Who did you wrong, tryna figure out who's the liar
Arguments cold but that loving be on fire
Hopeless Desire

Are you worth my time
Worth feeling this high
Like I'm on cloud nine with you, yea yea
Just to fall back down
On the ground
Waste my time

Baby, baby yea
I thought our love was deeper than the ocean
We diving in
But slowly we began to drown
Cause you did not know how to love
And I did not know how to trust
And together there was still no us
We tried but the foundation was all fucked up
Not to mention your mission
To get what you want when you miss it
Hell naw

Being with you is like driving on flat tires
Who did you wrong, tryna figure out who's the liar
Arguments cold but that loving be on fire
Hopeless Desire

Are you worth my time
Worth feeling this high
Like I'm on cloud nine with you, yea yea
Just to fall back down
On the ground
Waste my time

Waste my time
Why don't you
Why don't you waste my time
Go ahead, waste my time
Waste it
Take all of it, I don't need it
Waste my time
