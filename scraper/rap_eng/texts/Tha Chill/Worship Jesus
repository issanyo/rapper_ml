You either love Him or you hate that's the truth trust me
It's like making music gotta flow with the beat
If you get lost kinda blind can't see
No reward in heaven can you feel his heat

Time to make a move let's move gotta groove
No place but home for me I'm in the mood
Sorry about your luck but I guess you screwed
Up Up time to pay your dues

Can't be your guide cause we got separate rooms
One's for you and the others for the groom
The weddings coming up party time is so soon
Dig yourself a grave or come with us to the moon

Worship Jesus
Pack your bags come with us
We headed to a place called freedom
We always have fun get some

Pack your bags come with us

Jump Jump Jump for joy
Jesus in the building time to sing little boy
Praise Him then worship stand up make some noise
Glorify the King get loud and make some noise

Why you so shy with the one who made ya
Rose from the dead brought us all together
Singing from the roof top I love His Son
Stepped on the field and picked off another one

Jesus Education what Main Stream
Teaching little one's what it is to be a team
Regulating anger chill don't sin
Focus stay straight cause you know we gonna win
