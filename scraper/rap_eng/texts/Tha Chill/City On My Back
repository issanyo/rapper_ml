[Verse 1: Chris Cash]
Made in Canada, not born in America
Go bananas I'm an animal
I'm hannibal
Eating all these rappers so I'm feeling like a cannibal
Suck my genital
Been fucking up the world and I've not been gentle
Need some trophies I'm the mentor, so mental
Stay smoking like a motherfucking menthol
Nigga get back, nigga tic-tac
Spitting sweet bars like kit-kats
I'm out of this world so I'm eating Mars bars
Driving off into nice cars
So put your boy into nice cause
Cut the mic cord, I'm about to do a PSA
Got the fucking lights on, there's some words I gotta say
I earned my stripes so you know I don't play

[Hook: Lucius P.](x2)
MTL getting paid
And I'm aiming for the riches
On the way, lost some friends
Gained some friends and fucked some bitches

[Verse 2: Chris Cash]
Stay lifted, that's why they call me the gifted
But for lame niggas listening
Leave you missing
So sick, no antidote
Flow so much you gon' need a boat
So I'm coming in a jet-ski
So icy like red-ski
I study so don't test me
Don't tempt me
Canadian, I'm a gentleman
Ladies and gentlemen
Want war? I'm a veteran
Born raised to a better wind
I'm so arrogant
Killed the beat with no evidence
Shoot your feet so you better dance
Feel I'm home only in my home town
NTG uptown to downtown
From 6'4 saint low CV
I stay counting racks can't see me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lucius P.]
Made in Canada, the young thriller
I stay motherfucking Santa cause I'm here with the Gifted
Gifted children like schools are chosen
Exavior hood behavior
40 ounce in the mouth for a hoochie mama on my dick
Well I'mma glaze her, like donuts
So gonuts that's her flavor
MTL bruh, so I'mma go ahead
And roll my L's on the green line
In the meantime, I'll murder 16 lines
Ain't know it was me time
Yes indeed ha, I'm a hot MC ha
And your act is peanuts
Here's some peanuts
Cease and desist because you'll miss the target with your weak ass shit
