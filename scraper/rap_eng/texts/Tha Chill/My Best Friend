(Verse 1: Konscience)
If I get too close to anyone, then I'ma end up messing up
Stressing sucks. I'm sorry that I'm always so depressing. Fuck
I can't be happy
Because happiness is sappy
I'm not good with my emotions
And I don't know how to show 'em
At least, not the way you want me to
I'm not the guy you want me to
Be. I'm me, and I'm not perfect; ain't that fucking true?
An introvert:
I've turned myself inside
Turned my eyes to the internal, so I had somewhere to hide
In the crowded world. My only friend is me
And he hates me. That's the part that really gets to me
Especially, when I'm lost in thought, I'm stuck just him and me
And he tells me all my flaws: Every single sin. It seems
We will never get along
See, I don't hate myself;
I hate the part of me that hates myself:
The heart of me that breaks itself
Or others break
Fuck it; I'm stuck inside my head
And I'm not sure whether the people there want me alive or dead


(1:10)
(Chorus: Konscience)
I'm my best friend
I'm my worst enemy
I'm my conscience
I'm regret:
The end of me

(Verse 2: Konscience)
Confidence is key; that's why I'm stuck within my thoughts
I'm too busy fighting my demons to try to pick the lock
They always win
They hide for a little, then come back harder than before
And it's always when I'm startin' for the door
So, I can wallow in my poor
Esteem and swallow anymore
I don't got a lot of dreams that I can follow anymore
It's a cockamamie sport
For me to try to break my curse
I think I'm just unlovable, or
I was made to hurt
And, if either one is true
I don't wish that onto you
I just wish my sorrow helps you see
That others feel it too
And, if others feel it too, then
You can color in the room
You're trapped inside your mind
But, now, it isn't black and white
You got to look past the pain
And past mistakes
And graduate to Saturday
Cause, when the week ends
We're weakened:
The demons crashed the plane
They're in your head
And you need to get 'em out
Have confidence, my friend, because the demons
Feed on doubt

(Chorus)
I'm my best friend
I'm my worst enemy
I'm my conscience
I'm regret:
The end of me
(X3)


(Outro during chorus: Konscience)
You control your destiny
D-Destiny
Y-You control your destiny
De-d-de-d
You control your destiny
D-Destiny
D-Destiny
And I will fight with what is left of me
(X2)
