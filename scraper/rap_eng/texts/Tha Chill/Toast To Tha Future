(Verse 1 : Flow ProJectz)

Mind Of A Hustle & Heart Of A Lion
Blood Sweat & Tears its been a long journey to so much freedom
And its gonna be a long way to walk into my victory lap
I flow so easy with the passion and im so driven by my determination
Im just a dopeboy from the hood i just happen to rap
I walk the walk and talk the talk if its about the paper
You can find me on my knees when i pray to the lord
Toast to these low life haters cause they just gave me another motivation
Cash in(cash in) all i wanna do is just win
Im nothing now but im on my way to be something
No bling bling but oh my God Im Bout to shine like a shotting star
Its Flow ProJectz and Slam P we taking a toast to the future
Cause we the kings of tomorrow, real talk
