It’s Vanilla B(izcotti), and my world premiere! All my millions of fans, are standing right here! They followed my like my name was Twitter, now they’re in shock because of my wit sir!

They know that no one can spit it like me, so they’re impressed with the lines that just flow. Out my mouth like a waterfall, all these other rappers next to me are too damn small! To even see from the top where uh I am because I am the king. What’s my name mother fucker?! Vanilla B!

You think you have it tough, well let’s see. Guess what? Here’s a secret to Vanilla Bizcotti. I’m as white as a pile of bread, but I rap so good, people think I’m black instead. Being white with rhymes can be dangerous in the wrong hands, but I’m the right hand, so I’ll take it man!

I don’t drive a Lexus, no that’s not me, but I do drive the ladies crazy. My dick is as big as a truck, so let me park it in and let’s fuck, likes its 1963, that’s how it feels to be humped by Vanilla B. It’s so good that you’ll want to scream in delight!

I wanted to rap this up, but I have a lot to say, so shut up! I’ll be done when it’s time, but for now just let me rhyme, about how hard my life is. Here, let me give you the biz! All these haters hating me, and it’ only because I’m Vanilla B!

They say I can’t rhyme even though I can rhyme, in fact I do it all the time. It’s easy to flow when you have a head full of ideas and they glow! Don’t be afraid to follow your dreams just like fucking Vanilla B!
