[Intro Dialogue: Tha Chill]
What's happening?
Let's drop this shit off for the homie from Long Beach
Let's say Compton and the L-B-C meet the east and west again
Motherfucking Half Dead in this bitch
My nigga Tray in this bitch
They call me the hurricane Chill, check it out

[Verse 1: Tha Chill]
A little something for the bloods, crips, rucks for your ride
G'z and locs from the east and the westside
Dedicated to the gang related
Buckin' fools down making the other side run and hide
Throw your straps in the sky one time
Buck buck, buck, we don't give a fuck
Lay yo ass in a puddle, shit
Quick to bust for my niggas from the east and the west clique

[Chorus: Lil' 1/2 Dead]
This is dedicated to the east and the westside
(Yeah, this is dedicated to the east and the westside baby)
So put your shit in the deck adjust the bass and let the tape ride
(We gone put it in and let it ride baby)
Cause me and my homie Chill are dropping gangsta shit
(We dropping enough of that gangsta shit)
The type o' shit that none of you bustaz can fuck with
(That's right, where none of you bustaz can fuck with)
So step the fuck back before you smacked all in ya face
(Before you get smacked up)
Cause when it comes to putting it down Half Dead runs the whole place
(Yeah)

[Hook: Tha Chill]
We chilling on the eastside, smoking weed on the westside
Getting drunk on the eastside, fucking bitches on the westside
Getting jacked on the eastside, one times on the westside
O.G.'z on the eastside, O.G.'z on the westside
One two, one two

[Verse 2: Tha Chill & Lil 1/2 Dead]
Now that shit ain't got thick
So I'm throwing up the westside on the one hype click
Slumped up in an 8-5 cuthey
Indo smoke, bumping my buddy
On my way to the east, don't need no strap cause niggas act peace
No nigga set-trippin and thangs
Just a couple o' homies throwing up gang, mayne
Everybody got dodo, oh no
Here comes the homies in the lo-lo
Eastside, westside (westside)
Niggas stay down for your crown, hoo-ride
You know I gotsta stay down for my crown
I be's that crazy ass nigga from the (eastsiiiide) eastside part of town
The H-A-L-F D-E-A and to the D
Straight born and raised in the L-B-C

[Hook: Tha Chill]
Smokin weed on the eastside, getting drunk on the westside
Mothafuckas on the eastside, mothafuckas on the westside
Gang o' hoes on the eastside, gang o' tricks on the westside
Big booty on the eastside, big ass buttery on the westside

[Verse 3: Lil' 1/2 Dead]
On a mission on my way back to the east
And like my nigga Chill said the east is all about peace
Ain't no more gang-bangin, just cavvy slangin
Late night niggas on the corner hanging
Trynna make a buck, and still don't give a fuck
So run up and your ass will get stuck
So take heas to the words that I kick
Cause I drops nothing but gangsta shit, beyotch

[Chorus: Lil' 1/2 Dead]
This is dedicated to the east and the westside
So put your shit in the deck or just replace and let the take ride
Cause me and my homie Chill are dropping gangsta shit
The type o' shit that none of you bustaz can fuck with
So step the fuck back before you smacked all in ya face
Cause when it comes to putting it down Half Dead runs the whole place

[Hook: Tha Chill]
Getting drunk on the eastside, motherfuckers on the westside
They getting loaded down the eastside, big bitches on the westside
Niggas slanging on the eastside, niggas hanging on the westside
One times on the eastside, big bitches on the westside
One two, one two

[Outro Dialougue: Tha Chill while DJ Baby G scratches "yea"]
This is fo' them punk ass bitches

You lil' trick, ol' beyotch

For my nigga Half Dead
