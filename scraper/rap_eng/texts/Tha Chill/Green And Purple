Here we go, with the sickest flow
For your info, Charles Conceptz is the best rapper if you didn't know
But let me go
Continue on with the lyrics
I'm a teen rapper
People said they don't want to hear it
But you can't break my spirit
Cause my and my team we poppin like a skillet
I make physical music, you really feel it
It was my decision
To become a rapper, It took time and precision
I was hot in a second
Flow was cold in a minute
Your career is dead
Mine is very alive
Should I make a killing
I can hardly decide
Me and my girl
We can go for a ride
In this relationship together
No reasons to cry
I'm the best rapper ever
Can't you see
It cost to be the boss
And I paid the fee
I am on top
You are under me
I'm getting green every year : Oak tree
I'm hot, I'm on fire
My name is Double C
And I am much higher
Than you will ever be
Hip-Hop is my philosophy
Rappers come and follow me
They make up a style that was based on my flowing sea
But you can't really see
Who is the best
These rappers stole my style
I guess I sound like the rest
But you can best believe
My style switches up from time to time
Line to line
Rhyme is mine
My girl is fine
Walk by the clock
I pass the time
Rhyme is the thing that I'm best at
I murdered these rappers
I look around and say "Where the rest at"?
I request that
You rappers just give up the game
Ya'll some homonyms
Cause all ya'll sound the same
Money and Fame, It's not all that it seems
Gator Clique is the team
Shining bright like a beam
Hip-Hop is dead?
Well I'm coming back to life
Tonight, I will end all poverty and strife
You better get protection
This is the resurrection!
