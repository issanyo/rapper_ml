I'm spitting truth you can get it if you want to
Undress your sin ask Him it's possible
Running through the field well equipped for battle
Praise His name make sure it's no hassle

Don't tell a lie he can read your mind
Say the wrong thing it's a must you hide
Feel His wrath by the end of the ride
Must be forgiven or in Christ you die

No jokes here let's encounter the light
Keep Him in view can't lose your sight
Jesus saves lives with all his might
All his might all his might

How do you feel after you've been saved
Like a champion who just got paid
Like a mob boss whose just been made
Like a little kid who got a good grade

Rise from the dead just walk with Christ
Don't need to steal this ain't no heist
It's all for free there is no price
But you gotta hurry up while he's being so nice

Party time Club H it's official
You've been invited don't be superficial
Be in time or it's unofficial
Once upon a time you were artificial

I could see the future he wrote it
Not by himself but with some help
It all makes sense when you read it don't it
Take your time and recite it slowly

I can take blows for the one who loves me
I can stay strong for the one and only
I can take a stand for the one who loves me
I can make moves for the one and only
