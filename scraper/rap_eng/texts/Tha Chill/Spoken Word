I put in work, so it amounts to something
I swear I'll be mad if this was all for nothing
Got these rappers target running, so I'm always stunting
Kaotik World working hard as hell so it's all or nothing
I rap because I get to have a voice
I rap because it was my choice
I make my own noise
These rappers little, I'm the man
I don't play with toys
I do my thing, I want the beef
I don't make decoys
I didn't make these boys
Who want to spit
Cause they can't even see me in this rap shit
Yeah, I'm only a kid
But I talk big boy rhymes
No Childish Gambino, but I spit sick boi lines
I hit more rhymes
Then you ever will
I take you off the face of the earth like some clearisil
I always kill, I'm never still
On the move, killing dudes, and making moves
Be ready for Kaotik World to rule

[Chorus]
I'm on the road to success but all I see is curbs
I always try to be the best, That's my spoken word
That's my spoken word
I always try to stay fly just like a bird
I always try to be the best, That's my spoken word
That's my spoken word
Niggas claim my music is so whack and absurb
I always try to be the best, That's my spoken word
That's my spoken word
Im on the road to success but all I see is curbs
I always try to be the best, That's my spoken word
That's my spoken word

I see everyone spitting flows
But yet, I kill them with my steady flow
Ready, Go
Killing niggas with lyrics as sharp as machetes so
You already know
I make killings
No freddy though
In my lyrical mastermind
I pass the time by acting like an asenine
Where's the signs
Oh I'm kind
I can't see you rappers so I'm blind
I'm tracking time so I can blow your mind
Deploy the bomb
Reward my mom
It's more to come
More to hear
Let's make it clear
Just cause I'm a teen doesn't mean I can't
Time fine lines and rhymes that blow your mind
Now enjoy the scene and enjoy the cream
And watch me blow up
My flow's so sick I might throw up
I'm only 15, so what
I'm rhyming better than these other lyricists
I hope that you hearing this
Cause no one in the game is coming near of this
And now I'm so spirited
I know that God is listening
That's my Spoken Word

[Chorus]
I'm on the road to success but all I see is curbs
I always try to be the best, That's my spoken word
That's my spoken word
I always try to stay fly just like a bird
I always try to be the best, That's my spoken word
That's my spoken word
Niggas claim my music is so whack and absurb
I always try to be the best, That's my spoken word
That's my spoken word
Im on the road to success but all I see is curbs
I always try to be the best, That's my spoken word
That's my spoken word

Yeah
