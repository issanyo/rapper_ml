[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
Oh, woah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
If I was to walk up
On a sexy woman in the corner
Would she still look like a model chick?
Fine as hell, coke bottle body thick
If I saw her early tomorrow
Wonder would I still wanna call her
Would I take her number and throw it away?
Is she cool enough to save it for a rainy day
'Cause from over here
She lookin' like Beyonce mixed with Kelly mixed with Halle, that’s a domino
Girl, come over here
And let me take a closer look at you 'cause you know that I’ve been fooled before

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Tank]
By the make up, by the strobe lights
By the way they move their body to a song like
Too many club lights
Damn them club lights
Bitch look bad under them club lights
Whole lot of ass under them club lights
Throwin' all this cash under them club lights
Under them club lights, damn them club lights

[Verse 2: Tank]
Intoxicated, I’ve been drinkin'
It’s the liquor, it’s not me thinkin'
Vision blurred, I done lost all sight
And behind these shades, all these hoes look right
You know I can’t trust no pictures
Can I see you with no filter?
'Cause if you really look like that in real life
I’m willing to show you what it feel like
'Cause from over here
I think I see a clique full of Rihanna’s, y'all all looking tropical
So come over here
And let me take a closer look at you 'cause you know that I’ve been fooled before

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Tank]
By the make up, by the strobe lights
By the way they move their body to a song like
Too many club lights
Damn them club lights
Bitch look bad under them club lights
Whole lot of ass under them club lights
Throwin' all this cash under them club lights
Under them club lights, damn them club lights

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Am I wrong? 'Cause I wanna know
If she bad, I’ma take her home
If she cool, I’ll keep her on the low
I’m just sayin', I’ve been fooled before

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
By the make up, by the strobe lights
By the way they move their body to a song like
Too many club lights
Damn them club lights

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
Is she bad, is she bad? I don't know
Too many club lights
Tell the DJ turn them lights on, yeah
Damn, them club lights
