[Intro: Redman]
Gilla House niggas
Check it out
(Cause I like it!)

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo! I'm Ghetto Fab, hungry
Beastie Boy with +Brass Monkey+
Humphey Bogartin' the whole country
Chunky women love Doc
+Projects+ pump me like Pat
My pimp game is like rugby
Doctor, you know
New flow, new dough
Drunker than Woodrow, good time with a hood ho
Mutombo, stack that bread tall
Two chromey things like the back of my rear exhaust
Redman, dog - something wrong, strong arm
If I don't get +Chips+ like Ponch and John
You get slapped like Dee Barnes
+Doctor+, not Dre
And eating - but, I'm after the entr√©e!
My watch got TV's in, CD in play
Wanna find D-O, I'm knee-deep in MJ
+Boy+, I'm +Bad+
And You've Got Mail
And I need brain - she said +Yes+ like he 112

[Verse 2: Saukrates (Redman)]
Saukrates, all action, less talk
I'm paid to make the muscle under your chest talk
GILLA! Attack like that pump he lets off
20 motherfuckers hittin' from the chest up!
Saukrates, worldwide name
God put me D, now worldwide game (GILLA!)
Niggas keep a burner by the flame
Cause when shit get hot, we already came!
Saukrates, double vision, double incision
Double the pimpin' - takeover!
One of a kind, a stark reminder to any mark
Who wanna' stop the run of my cake over!
She ain't missin', she just kissin'
On my johnson, shit was out of the frame
Like +D+ video, How Does It Feel?
That Gilla House chill
It's Saukrates season, better shoot to kill!

[Verse 3: Icadon (Redman)]
(Y'all knowwwww!)
If Ick tell you to give your cash up, move faster!
Or this ratchet gonna' blast ya!
(My flowwwwwww!)
Is like a natural disaster
Bricks the Brook-lon, the crack move faster!
(I blowwwwwwwwww!)
Backwoods on the master
Dro' grown in the cold waters of Alaska
(Where I goooooooooo!)
I don't ever fold a map up
Wack, fuck +Navigation+ in the black truck!
Icadon, I own the dick your chick's on
Gilla House! I'm clique strong, the fifth long
My name reign, from Bricks to Brick-ston
But I'm from Brook-lon, don't get flipped on!
I'm nice with my metal wear, ice in the ghetto
If I die - nigga, your wife is a widow!
I'll nice with the fiddle
I'll make the belly button a bulls-eye, nigga!
I'll put my knife in the middle!
