[Intro: MC Ren]
You can't follow this, I didn't leave a scent
You can't fool the 5 percent, that me and Train represent

[Hook]
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Because the villain is back, I'm taking over
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Because the villain is back, I'm taking over

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Renincarnated, I'm about to Darth Vader again
Be the villain, cause these niggas is lame
Is no revenge for the bitches you's a legend in vain
How the fuck you a legend nigga never went gold
Game, most of you sold that's why your shit went cold
The black nigga Ren leave your ass exposed
Calling all clones back, y'all don't know how to act
That took my shit, and big, never brought the bitch back
Go make a loutish, you're wasting my time
Quit believing motherfuckers when they say you can rhyme
Better bow down to villain, pay your respect
The praise is expect dealing with you niggas is hectic
Compton's messiah, part of the scripture
Make your ass look small, when I jump in the picture
That's when the real will hit ya
Nigga Ren can hit ya
Nigga Renincarnated, I'm knowin' you bitches hatin'

[Hook]
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell

Because the villain is back, I'm taking over
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Because the villain is back, I'm taking over

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Bullshit out here, nigga villain back to make that shit disappear
Fuck my peers, the return of a Cyrus - droping a virus
It's the Compton who done it, fuck your bitch and want it
Nigga think about who done it, not your bitch ass team
Wearing fucking pink and wearing skinny jeans
Looking like bitches talking gangsta shit
That's the thanks I get? Thinking you the Compton shit?
Your bitch is jocking, cause your ass is local
She put my wing-ding ding-a-ling jump in the vocal
What the fuck can I say, when I'm up in the booth
Y'all bitch ass niggas know I'm telling the truth
It's that West Coast Cali bud, lyrics is fire
Make your ass retire before your punk ass hit a flyer
It can only be one villain, one villain in this
So tell your niggas you ain't fucking with this, let's go

[Hook]
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Because the villain is back, I'm taking over
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
Because the villain is back, I'm taking over

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Let me kill these fake villains that be using my shit
From 88 to now, your ass ain't laughing now
The return of the villain, nigga Shock of the Hour
You shock for power, about to shock for cowards
I know the game changed since last I was in it
It's nothing to applause, plus you niggas is soft
Y'all try to be the mad scientist the apprentice
I started this gangsta shit so now I'm about to finish it nigga
I'm the rightful heir to the throne
Compton shockers hulu, you bitches is so through
You want me on your shit I ain't fucking with you
Your shit be so plain 1 percent of your brain
This the only shit y'all use when you up in this game
You a legend up in your hood
They got your ass feeling good
You still a bitch nigga trying copy the villain
Renincarnated I know these bitches hate it

[Hook]
Nigga scared ass hell
Nigga scared ass hell
