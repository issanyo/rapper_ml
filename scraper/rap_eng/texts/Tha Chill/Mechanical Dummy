[Verse 1: Kid Cobra]
Romin' in the mall you can skip the weak price tags
I can buy anything as long as I bring a duffle bag
My flow is serious but it's a hundred percent stupid
One second later you fall in love with us because of cupid
Y'all get booed of the stage, then y'all get extra mad
Wanna be in first class? pay attention get a notepad
Yea it might be stupid but my verses are silent
Blank C be smoking loud while y'all be smoking them quiets
I roll up in a Cadillac next day is Mercedes
Second guy being turnt' up Mr. Hades
Once I'm in the booth I'm in the zone cuz' it's on
Six Sum' in hotels better call Mr. LeBron
I'm one not a number two and I've never been on a number three
I move forward never go back and y'all steady tryna' be wanna be's
Blowin' money so high y'all gone think I'm shooting rockets
Y'all don't get paid on a basis instead y'all pickin' pockets. Why?

[Hook: Young Check'a]
True Skills boy getting' paid money
Rappers getting' scared always keep 'em running
Flow so stupid flow so funny
We some idiots Mechanical Dummy

[Verse 2: Young Check'a]
Young Check'a and my flow is so idiotic
That's my own opinion tell me what you think about it
You think I give it but really only Brittany got it
Gettin' bands you boys is gettin' penny pockets
Ain't about that life then go and get about it
Y'all don't know nun about it
I had a life that i wanna live but my family i couldn't live without it
Getting' money like a bank accounting
Higher then a Appalachian Mountains
I had a girl to get a girl now all the girls just talk about it
Y'all don't even know me but the name is Young Check'a
Don't worry cuz' by next year you rappers gone feel pressure
Girl has golden skin so i call that gold my treasure
Elbow in the head then walk away, Metta
The Finals I bet it Young Check'a don't forget it
You boys is in the lead, to bad I'm just ahead it
Chris give me credit cuz' I'm the one that led it
Screw all my enemies and half of all my exes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Larro Da Great]
Uh, Ballin' hard for my city
Doin' it for my lil' sister them old hitta's that's with me
That's C.S.M.B.S. Double M and we poppin' bottles like Diddy
One head shot we gone stop the game and control the game like Bibby
Put that diamond face in that Rollie, I'm ballin' hard like I'm Kobe
Them haters I know they hating but really don't even know
Go insane they can't even control me, got 20 shots that's Ginobili
Yo' main thot she all on my hip and she giving out neck and rollie
Put that Rollex and I'm shinin' them, haters know that they wildin'
I'm countin' all of this fast money my Rollex man got diamonds
Killin' these rappers here [?] That pistol talk bring a 9 in
I'm steady rappin' these fast these speed racers I'm buyin'
Steady countin' all of that fast cheddar my flow's gettin' a lil' better
I'm steady rockin' wit lil' Cam and I'm hittin' flows wit Check'a
The coldest rappers that's flowin' and swear these... a sweater
I'm flowin' cold I'm flowin' cold no heating me like a lever (Woo)
