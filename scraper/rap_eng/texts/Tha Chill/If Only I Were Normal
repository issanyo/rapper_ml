My mind so deep, I struggle to truly express it
I alter my ego before my ego alters the message
Is this dude serious? I want to keep them guessing
My flow is quick. The song is over before you can assess it
Growing up as a smart kid in a black school
I always stuck out like a boner in a swimming pool
No one ever helped me out in life
I was always being called gay or white
Now that's not even right
I just want to take flight and just to leave with my lover
People always say that I'm the kid Donald Glover
But he drops lochness, I drop realness
Some people might block this
Some people might steal this
My flow is original and it's based off my expiriences that I went through in life
Moms please tell me your hearing this
It's cause of a few people that I'm still here today
And those people are the ones who didn't call me gay

CHORUS
I have been through so much in my short lifetime
Record labels calling me, Shows that its my time
Music is the only thing to help me escape from the world
It seems like on this earth. There is no perfect girl
I will be the best and never put the mic down
I'm sleeping on the rest, even when the sun's down
If I'm here then there, I call it paranormal
If Only I Were Normal

I have let way too many people in and out my life
Been messing with the wrong ones
All them caused poverty and strife
I need to settle down
With a female with a crown
Thats going to turn my life around
She knows I put it down
I love the way she sounds when she is singing this song
I could cuddle with her, all night long
But don't get me wrong
I'm just getting started
I love being faded
So let's have a party
We always have our ups and downs
Our arguments and other stuff
But at the end of the night, we make up
No fisticuffs
But you had your chance, No coming back
You ran away from problems like you running track
I kept you well thats why your stomach's flat
Yup, You heard me right
You thought I cared when you called me white
How how come we can't be friends, instead of enemies
And we're only 14, Why you drinking henessy?
You always getting jealous cause your friends are so into me

CHORUS
I have been through so much in my short lifetime
Record labels calling me, Shows that its my time
Music is the only thing to help me escape from the world
It seems like on this earth. There is no perfect girl
I will be the best and never put the mic down
I'm sleeping on the rest, even when the sun's down
If I'm here then there, I call it paranormal
If Only I Were Normal
