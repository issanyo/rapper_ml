[Verse 1]
So there's that's on my my mind and someone who I would hate to lose
And I broke her heart and this time I can't fix it with just a stick of glue
And some people don't understand why I do the things I do
I can tell my friends would understand me but when I tell them they won't get the clue
I can talk to her and apologize, but I know she ain't listening
And the hardest thing about breaking up is the memories you be remembering
And it's pretty much only a few people that understand what I'm witnessing
And every bad habit that I started doing it's time for me to finish it
And any other girl I would've let go, but this love ima fight for it
And I know that we was meant to be 'cuz these things I got a eye for it
This love is moving far away and to get it back ima drive for it
Any other love I would've brushed it off but this love girl I would die for it
Everything was going good, but one mistake brought it all down
Now every time you cry, you don't cry it's just tears without a sound
And all the bad things I did to you I guess Karma's coming back around
And I know it's over between you and me but I hope you at least you can forgive me now
I'm Sorry!

[Chorus]
One time for the, One time for the girl
I know it's a million, billion, trillion girls in the world
But it's one main thing that I know I gotta do
You're lost in love and girl I'm trying find you
Girl I'm trying find you (7x's)
Where did she go?

[Verse 2]
They say home is where the heart is well if it is where did it go?
It may be lost in the deep of snow, but what is love no one seems to know
And some say it's a part of life and special that you'll never lose
Especially for that one person who's special enough that you give it to
And I agree with all of that, but honestly I can't deny the fact
All the pressure that was given to me I didn't have the weight to carry it on my back
It's a lot of things that I don't deserve and many people just gave it to me
But I can't forget and just be friends with someone who was special to me
I was selfish towards you, and all I did was care for me
Many other people have been telling me that we wasn't meant to be and having all the doubters was embarrassing
I never understood what love was, but back then I was a fool shook
Two can play it that game and ain't no need for that rule book
We had to do what we had to do and honestly it was the best move
Because even though I show a lot of promise I still know I got a lot to prove
They say home is where the heart is, but we don't know where are hearts are at
The separation from each other was probably the best effect
I can understand if she probably never ever wanna see my face again
But one thing I ain't gone do is let another [?] coming standing in
And one thing that ima do for you is fight for you 'til it's all over
But until then ima fight for you and anything you need girl ima do it for you and that's a promise

[Chorus]
One time for the, One time for the girl
I know it's a million, billion, trillion girls in the world
But it's one main thing that I know I gotta do
You're lost in love and girl I'm trying find you
Girl I'm trying find you (7x's)
There she goes
