[Intro: Tone]
Turn up
Turn me up, turn me up

Turn up, turn up x4

[Verse 1: Tone]
Ok
Bitch I'm in this thing
Fuck you think you gone do?
You should be ashamed
Way your girl on my crew
I ain't in to games, so I ain't playing neither
I'm the type of nigga turn a fucking doubt to a believer
And I won't settle down til' I drink more
Yeah I'm wilding out, it's what I came for
Hoes throwing back with the twerk team
Girls in here, sprinkles on ice cream
You thirsty niggas trying to get ass
I'm burning plastic, you blowing cash
Cash on me, that's admission fee
Running shit, you in the faculty
New bitch I'm with, they ain't rumors
Ass so fat, we call them tumors (damn)
Real niggas stand up, lames sit
My girl kissing girls like parties bitch
No party just everyday shit
So dike don't know what straight is (ok)
I'm so crazy
You think you crazy but I am the craziest

[Hook: Tone]
Bitch stop killing my vibe, man we in here
We the young niggas that you hoes had to start fear
Getting faded but my visions kind of still clear
Girl don't be a square

Bitch nigga we turnt (turn up)
Yeah I'm trying to get turnt (we turnt)

[Verse 2: Z-Mane]
Z-Mane!
Someone tell them niggas that we turning up
Yeah this track is fire, got you burning up
When I pull up they know what's up
Is that codeine? Nah it's Kool-Aid in my cup
Uh, young nigga just turned 16
No more passenger I got my own machine
I be cruising down to Mexico, yeah my nigga Tone know what I mean
Uh, roll up with my niggas like we smoking one
But no, I don't smoke. I'm just having fun
If I see a hater then I'm blasting one
And if I see a bad chick then I'm smashing one
Ok, now turn up like the vegetable
E-40 couldn't have said it better
Now I'm all about the cheddar
Young nigga, Z-Mane, can't nobody do it better
I'm the heavyweight in rapping, you niggas light as some feathers
I get green (get green)
Stay clean (stay clean)
When I turn up you might think I'm insane (insane)
Skinny nigga but I got a big thing
Big brain, might as well get a big chain (ha)
It's Royalty Gang until I go (yeah)
You already know I'm a rep for my squad (yeah)
Any of you niggas trying to step up to the plate let me show you how we turn up cus' we go so hard
Ha!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tone]
I don't think I'm a real nigga (no)
Cus' I define it (ok)
Look at the name (and what?)
Go and underline it (proof)
Please don't undermine it
It's no understatement so understand it
You flexing hard, I barely started
When I walked in the party started
The lames departed, I'm the party
I take a square and make her naughty
Grant her wishes, no Timmy Turner
So call me Timmy or Timmy Turn Her
You lighting up and I got the burner
You're a spender, I'm more and earner
Your first time, you're now a learner
Today's the day you gone learn girl
I ain't tripping that's lame shit
You a trick and a lame bitch
My clique ain't got no lames in it so fuck the ones you came with
Swag dumb crazy like I'm retarded
Stay on my shit like I just farted
If she was pregnant then I'll abort it
Y'all wilding out and I'm all for it

[Hook]
