[Verse 1: Granyte]
I remember back when I was a child, thinking about blowing up/
Little did I know after Nas the game was all about going dumb/
I still sat in the corner with a pad, I would go for months/
And just scribble the words down, notepads my devotionals/
Hope you know I kept going, here I am, rebel without a cause/
Mask on, penetatary for these thousand bars/
Finally in the Mile High City, scream it from the mountaintops/
I keep expecting to wake up, all I can hear are these loud alarms/
The countless storms are weighing heavy, just wanna make it out/
These voices keep tearing me down, just seems to make me doubt/
That I can ever get out of these pages, all the cliches about/
Being stuck behind these bars, or raps so hot they could blaze an ounce/
The monster in my mind is knocking down these doors, I'm fading out/
I'm another white rapper with daddy issues, I'm hardly breaking grounds/
But this is my story, can't change the channel with a lost remote/
Fuck it man, I can't see the end, but that's just how the story goes/

[Chorus: Eli Rebich]
And that's the way the story goes/
It lights the open road/
It's all or nothing and it's time to leave/
Your introduction to the next big thing/
I'll be the frequencies that are frequently in stereo/
When I get home the world will know/
About lights, fame, and fortune/

[Verse 2: Granyte]
Trying to live in the present, but my past overwhelms me/
Started this life on a full tank, but now I'm so close to empty/
Just wanna get it over with, hope to open new endings/
A hypocritical cynical bastard, just kill me/
Wish I couldn't feel, never dealing with this broken heart/
I could change the way I was perceived at a moment's prompt/
I just wanna keep on drinking then screaming till my throat is hoarse/
Can't be too real on a track, otherwise I'm showing flaws/
But if I don't explain why I'm here, then I'm just a poser/
Give a man a mask right, I guess I've become the poster/
Honestly, given my heart right now, there's nothing colder/
Just take everything away, wondering why we're becoming smokers/
Thought this music would make a difference, be the young composer/
Call me what you want, but you can never cut the motor/
This is my story, can't change the channel with a lost remote/
Fuck it man, I can't see the end, but that's just how the story goes/

[Chorus: Eli Rebich]
And that's the way the story goes/
It lights the open road/
It's all or nothing and it's time to leave/
Your introduction to the next big thing/
I'll be the frequencies that are frequently in stereo/
When I get home the world will know/
About lights, fame, and fortune/ x2
