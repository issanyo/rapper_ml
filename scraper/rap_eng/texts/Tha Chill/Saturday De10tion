[Verse One]
Welcome to detention
Yeah nigga I said welcome to detention
Now here's the bill like we Winston
My niggas stand in attention
Nigga screw some attention
I'm tryna' move to positions
Oh yeah i suck but you're listening
It's (ishu!!!)
That nigga that's inspiring the children
It's (ishu!!!)
The everlasting hero of the villains
It's (ishu!!!)
This fake rap I don't even deal with
(Cus I miss them)
Days where the fame was so hard to get into
But now you get a good instrumental
And put some auto-tune on your voice
We rappers don't have a choice
We try to release the music but all they want is the noise
We're turning men into boys
They steady playing with toys
What the hell is a strap when you got your trust in the lord?
Lord knows I mess up but he loves me no matter what
He covers me with his blood
Yeah I have my doubts but you gotta believe In something
Man that's written on the sword
So when the DJ hit record
Know you're hearing important thoughts imported from a real nigga's toilet
I'm the ish, real cuz' I ain't afraid to be different
Time is money so you niggas can't afford not to listen
Hits low my career need a cup like a piston
Have my dogs chasing after you, karma's a bitch
And I rock chilling with my man tony
And I'm hot nigga that's why fans blow me!

[Hook]
It's like I'm running slow in place
Is all of this gone pay off?
Or Is all of this a waste?
I can't wait till the day where I be up on a stage
And their asking
What you doing?
(Changing games)
What you doing?
(Getting plays)
And I got talent i'ma use it
And if a nigga's hating tell that hater he can move it
Keep watching the screen soon I'ma be up in movies
And their asking
What you doing?
Makig music)
What you doing?
(Never losing)

[Verse Two]
And they laugh when I say I rap
Define lame nigga tell me what you see it as
Yeah cuz' I see love always makes everyone smile
When you're secure with your self you can shine out
I'm a lame now but soon I can dine out
With a honey spending money then we ball out
I don't mind if your things what you rap about
Only when it's the only thing that you rap about
And then the real rappers gotta struggle against your whack rap
Cheif prolly' got more downloads than the Nas al-
And that pretty bad
This is part of a culture nigga this isn't a fad
This is how we express ourselves and this is who i am
I am that nigga falling sleep in the class
My band and my group
The movies and the cam
All my plan my tools for success (here we go nigga)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And I almost made this mix-tape an EP
Cuz' when I record it don't sound good to me
She let the crew grope her so I'm calling her a groupie
All these whack acts really only in it for the money
Hook em' in like a fish nah I spear it
I gotta make it big I can feel it in my spirit
Know you feel it
Know you fear my superior rap skills
Rapping different like Pharrell
I am freal' in the booth I'm ill
I am sick spitting jams when I'm rapping
I'm ripping so many booths I got Abraham clapping
Did it fast got niggas like "What just happened?"
It's the captain of the ship so get your faggot crew to back you
When I hit you with this line it's like a human chain reaction
All of your women plastic and I'll take em in a second man
You should get a lesson plan
This nigga's a veteran
Right now I feel like I'm feeling better than I've ever been

(Hook)

Spiff:
Nigga this shit can't be over yet

[Verse Four]
Pink backpack
Came from the same planet as the man who crossed the earths wingspan
Saw my first girlfriend
With her new boyfriend
That nigga was light-skinned
Mad I wasn't like him
Haters in my ear saying I spit corny
I try to call her when I'm horny
But damn girl now my horns are gone just like my spine so  I say it all in recording
Before me
There were legends but I reckon my story will be glorious
And I don't need a white hand writting with a pen in a textbook changing up my story
What you heard isn't what you're hearing
What you drove through the ground isn't what you're steering
Cuz' you think I'm transparent doesn't give you clearance
It's apparent like it's kidding
A ha ha, no jokes just like a senator

[Outro: Young Thriller]
Ayo' my nigga you was just too turnt' up my nigga
That-That was some nice-That was just nice my nigga, too turnt up my nigga

Spiff: I ain't even hear what he said
