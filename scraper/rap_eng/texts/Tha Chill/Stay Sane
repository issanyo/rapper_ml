(Verse 1)
My feet are sore;
The Blisters administer a sharp pain
My hearts drained
And I can never hear it beat no more
She's the reason I can't breathe no more
And, even though I sleep, I see her sneaking in my dreams
So I don't even sleep no more
As I peak around the corner, the peak reaches past infinity
Goals seem too be to steep to reach
So I don't even reach no more
And, even though I've seen these things
I seem to be affected
I just wish I couldn't see no more
Violence reigns the time today;
Man, we ain't free no more
Say that we will pray for peace;
There is no peace to war
All the secrets they got hid from the public
They make me sick to my stomach;
My brother, I don't even wanna eat no more
Why bother with politics?
I don't get why they give benefits
To men who get seven mil every year
I can't make sense of this
Penniless, but stressing just stresses it
I'm forever sick. My head is split
Man; I don't even wanna think no more

(Chorus)
[Stay]
Life is pain
[Sane]
Stay sane
(Repeat)

(Verse 2)
They say that life is a song
But I can never hear it
I don't even recognize my eyes when I am staring in the mirror
I'm seeing doubles
Seeing devils
And they whisper in my ear, and
All I hear is screams of bloody murder
Dreams of cutting further
In the planet's dirt
'cause, man, it hurts:
My plans just haven't had their birth
I blame it on the planet 'cause the planet
Shouldn't grant me breath
I ask for death
(It hasn't heard
My cries) 'cause dying seems to work
Living isn't worthless, kid, it's purpose is
To turn you in, assign you to a permanent place
For the worms to dig in
We're born to live; we live to die
There isn't any chord to write
There isn't any war to fight
There isn't any sword to swipe
There isn't any form to sign
There isn't anymore to life
There isn't anymore to life
In essence, we are born to die
Stay Sane

(Chorus)
[Stay]
Life is pain
[Sane]
Stay Sane
(Repeat)
