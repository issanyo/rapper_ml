G-yeah!
G-yeah!
To the fallen soldiers
G-yeah!
Oh say can you see?
By the fucking police lights
While so proudly we sail
In the hood we be creeping
With the blue and red rags
And the expired tags
While the domestic fights
Wake the kids up who were sleeping
And the hollow points did scare
Bullet holes, everywhere
Game proof, late night
At the drive-bys, leave grieving
Oh say does that blue and red bandanna
Make the gang signs wave?
But the hood is where we be
And rest in peace to the brave
Little something to the fallen heroes
All the thug niggas
Rest in peace to all the hoods
Veteran's day
Stand the fuck up!
