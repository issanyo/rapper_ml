You know I got get cha cause I got get cha
Going to get cha, gotta git cha cause I got get cha

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
Nigga I see you sleeping, so I'm creeping
On your Dayton's cause you ain't an G, like me young h.d
That little gangsta coming from the l.b.c
And he be straight jacking constantly
I just took an coupe with the must to be (That's right)
That nigga was trying to flow
So I grabbed on his ass and his ass got toss, he loss
His strap and his mother fucking jewels
I looked in the rear view and said, O weezel
I left the nigga lye straight in the street
Hitting corners, straight mashing stuffing my heat in the seat
We just banging and I'm hanging corners on his hundred stock torrents
On the mission trying to get to the spot
Cause I can up with some switches and the shit is hot

[Hook 4x]

[Chill]
Going get cha, rock me ha ya, ready to hit cha
Mother fuckers best run and duck
That nigga named chill is straight crazy as fuck
Yea, I'm in the backing mother fuckers on they pockets
False move take em off like an rocket
Blowing nigga out of his socks
Creeping off with the cooks and four four Glock
Cock, niggas might be up the block
But I'm ready to serve these punk ass fools like rocks (Got em fat)Im still on
A mission, ski mask on you still know that you kissing
Yall niggas better listen, I got the four four cannon
Ready for some tripping, you probably trying to get me
But this nigga never slipping from the c.p.t

[Hook 4x]

Didn't give an damm about slay
Down to ground, we don't fuck around

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]

Bring your bullet proof and your largest heat
And we can't be beat

And it about to get hot then the on the beach
