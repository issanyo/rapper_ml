[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Spark up blunts by the pounds
My Glock full of rounds
And I laugh at you clowns
Like "haha!"
Get 'em up, drop 'em down
Back with the sound
And I laugh at you clowns
Like  "haha!"

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Making niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land
Underhanded hits are planned
These scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends; fuck friends and foes!
Me? A born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her "My Bitch Nigga-Eater"
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in my physical form
Let it be known

Spark up blunts by the pounds
My Glock full of rounds
And I laugh at you clowns
Like "haha!"
Get 'em up, drop 'em down
Back with the sound
And I laugh at you clowns
Like  "haha!"

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screaming, "Fuck all ya'll niggas!" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-by's
Murder my foes, can't control my 9
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive; ran up on his ass
When I dumped he died, 'cause I'm troublesome

Like "haha!"
Get 'em up, drop 'em down

Like  "haha!"

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
"Murder murder" my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme â€“ the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga, "Either stop or die"
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep; I'm having crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, 'cause I ain't begging for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
Hahaha
