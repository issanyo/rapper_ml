[Intro]
Yeah
Kasinova (Tha Don, Tha Don)
And Mr Bo'z
Alter-The-Ego (Records, Records)
Hey Courtney, what up homeboy?
I hear the streets is talking
Even me or about you
Uh, let 'em know

[Verse 1]
I watched the game fold, and then my eyes went black
Stay strapped for them bitches who dare to take it back
So now i'm cautious, holding on for bigger portions
Verbally speaking, across the mind i'll be reaching
The reason i'm breathing, to leave them blinded while i'm creeping
It's even decieving to know the reapers steady sleeping
It's crazy, you think you hard cause you well known
Fucking with Kas' and get your chest blown
Teflon, when I bomb will I remain calm?
Strong arm your whole army with my bloody palms
Hit glass and break fast like it's Ramadan
Ski masks and red flasks with my niggas on
And it's the daily venom with Mr Bo'z and Kasinova on this extramental
We packing steel because the shit we into
So make way for the made niggas
'cause they ain't really got the heart to speak that's why they made liquour

[Hook (Mr Bo'z)]
You can find me up in the streets because you know i'm out there (know i'm out there)
And when I see the OGs' (when I see the OGs')
They tell me do what they do (do what they do)
Better keep your ear to the streets you never know what you might hear (never know what you might hear)
Might talk about me (might talk about me)
Might talk about you (might talk about you)

[Verse 2]
The first agenda is to stop the pretenders
Niggas acting like they name is Bender
In Futurama imma bring the drama to your mama home
I creep up on them with two Chromes
And watch me blast 'til that ass gone
He tried to run but he couldn't run faster
How the fuck you dodge, hollow steady coming at cha
Steady dreamin', you ready feinin' for that nicotine in
Packing heavy cause niggas swear they gonna catch me leanin'
Maybe my allergies got the best of me because my visions blurry
I keep on eyeing up and don't worry
And if you wanna play a game then play it through
Cause certain shit in this world wasn't made for you
So homie take it as a lesson learned
You wanna rest in the fire until you get burned
The evil smile as a juvenile
He wanna live his dying days as a problem child
Somebody tell him now:

[Hook (Mr Bo'z)]
You can find me up in the streets because you know i'm out there (know i'm out there)
And when I see the OGs' (when I see the OGs')
They tell me do what they do (do what they do)
Better keep your ear to the streets you never know what you might hear (never know what you might hear)
Might talk about me (might talk about me)
Might talk about you (might talk about you)

[Verse 3]
It's a mystery if I die through the misery
Fuck the world 'cause it never did shit for me
I gotta get another grind on
Authorities always running up in my home
They got me strapped in cuffs
Planting narcotics on my property
I finessed the game, it ain't no stopping me
I ran deeper than the pits of Hell
Everybody is a Gangsta but they quick to tell
Shut yo mouth tramp, and real niggas know the feeling
Been aware of the gold mines thats swallowed by drug dealing
'Forget about love cause knowing love can get you killed'
One of the realest phrases that I heard on the battlefield
I pack the steel, my adversaries getting drilled
When shit was real and motherfuckers lost they drill
But now we kill, so many bodies in coffins
I never thought I'd see so many homies get tossed in

[Hook (Mr Bo'z)]
You can find me up in the streets because you know i'm out there (know i'm out there)
And when I see the OGs' (when I see the OGs')
They tell me do what they do (do what they do)
Better keep your ear to the streets you never know what you might hear (never know what you might hear)
Might talk about me (might talk about me)
Might talk about you (might talk about you)
