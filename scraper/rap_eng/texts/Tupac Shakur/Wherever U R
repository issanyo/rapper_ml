[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Watch me, ain't no question
I'm sufferin' a bad case of lyrical congestion, not the one for testin'
Come mess with and end up with your chest split
No, not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act, ha
I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer
Competition minds up in the state of paranoia
I told him if you're scared, go get a dog, so by tomorrow
You'll probably see 20 rappers walkin' with Rottweilers
Your gimmick is primitive, and impotent, you won't win with it, so limit it
Before I make your body start to hemorrhage
Just when you thought that you was burnin' me
You found yourself bleedin' internally, now you heads is learnin', see
I stayin' there sincere, you commence prayer
Your heart begets fear, cause there ain't no wins here, huh
Never kid, cause even with leverage
I can rock your domepiece worse than the wop ever did
What?

[Pre-Verse: 2Pac]
Are you out your fuckin' mind?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Ask me to blast, no need to ask 'cause I'm mashin'
Peepin' the latest fashion, copy-cats in plastics
Get me to flashin', my adversaries shipped in caskets
Murdered them bastards, witness the past, got boom-bastic
Now that they freed me, no one can see me
I completely eradicated my competition, Father forgive me
Assemble the troops, prepare my loots for combustion
Rushin' them muthafuckas, the deadliest nigga bustin'
How can they touch me when they lost in thought?
On Death Row we lock shit down across the board
Now flash and watch me get in that ass like a bikini
Lyrical legendary so niggas'll never see me
Completely defeat me, can never happen, whether rappin' or scrappin'
Niggas get smashed on they muthafuckin' back
Hard to kill, and even harder to stop
Watch Kane and 'Pac drop the sho' shot! Tell them motherfuckers

[Pre-Verse: Big Daddy Kane]
Here's how we'll do it

[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane & 2Pac]
The meet us and the plan's to put the cash in the hand
So that I can spend a grand of benjimans up in Japan
Now who's the man? And therefore my Luchi, eatin' sushi
Checkin' out a subtitled movie featurin' Sho Kasugi
Tell me, Kane, when will niggas learn?
In this game, fuck with us, niggas gettin' burned
We takin' turns on you bitch-made nigg-ar-os
I hope it hurts, cause you're worse than these groupie hoes
One more time baby
I'll be forever, the gogetter of the chedder
Thinkin' ahead of my competitor, just too clever to sever
I got it together to represent with my true nigg
The first syllables of our name together is 2 Big
Think about that!
