You all a bunch of f*ckin' a*sholes
You know why?
You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be
You need people like me..
You need people like me so you can point your f*cking fingers
And say "That's the bad guy."

I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my n*ggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us but ma MAC - 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Straight solider, bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try, n*ggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, than we multiply
See me striking down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherf*cker, living like I wanna
Ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherf*cker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me, n*gga
Zig-zagging through the freeway
Race me, n*gga in a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherf*cker that you ever saw

Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You all a bunch off f*cking a*sholes)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You need people like me..)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(So you can point your f*ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD GUY.")

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away
I'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave, cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo, creeping out the window
Alone, on my own, I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household
I'm out cold, on the streets screaming "Motherf*ck peace!"
I got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do I do?
Live the THUG LIFE, n*gga stay true
I wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?
Lord forgive me, if you feel me
Cause all my life I was dirt broke with no hope
Little skinny motherf*cker wanting dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid

Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You all a bunch off f*cking a*sholes)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You need people like me..)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(So you can point your f*ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD GUY.")

The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday, but he don't listen
The poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen! I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money but never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy cause he left me?
Wish he would've hugged me too much like him
So my mama don't love me on my own at a early age
I'm getting paid
And I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray? I'm hanging in the back streets
Running with G's and dope friends, will they jack me?
Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose (I got nothing to lose)

Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You all a bunch off f*cking a*sholes)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You need people like me..)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(So you can point your f*ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD GUY.")
