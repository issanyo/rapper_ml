[Intro] (2Pac)
Yeah niggas, you can't fuck with us
Tell 'em to come the fuck on
Scared bitch motherfuckas, Yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Dave Duke sure look cute in that black suit Oooohhh
But even cuter behind the barrel of my six shooter Oh
You look worried cause I ain't burried
Punks leave in a hurry cause I throw flurries making mothafuckas, scurry
Come feel the flavor from my single
And brain cell's tingle I'm feeling stronger than a fuckin mad Dingo
And uh How's that for black history?
I stay strapped, and love to jack those that slang that crack misery Ha
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas
But how could you love niggas if you trying drug niggas?
You motherfuckas need your caps peeled
Cause when blacks kill blacks we stay trapped and thats, real
And we don't need no more statistic's
It's time to get more realistic for the young the black and the gifted
And uh
Until my people get uplifted
There's no popping shit, just popping clips instead of marching we gon' rip
Shit

[Chorus (2Pac)]
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
How should I plead? Forever thuggin' on a quest to get G's
Runnin' from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure, the stress will have me drinkin'
Thinkin' niggas after me, much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin' G's
They after a playa, but I won't let 'em capture me
I gotta thank the Lord for the weed and the nicotine
I can't sleep, close my eyes, I see wicked things
I keep my pistol by my bedside, one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homicide, my life's in danger
Rollin' down the 405, beware of stangers
Hand on my 4-5; that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong, but I'll never know it till I'm gone
From out the gutter where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me
Before the penitentiary, let's get it on!

[Chorus (2Pac)]
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas

[Bridge (2pac)]
Fuck them skinhead ass niggas
Fuck the police, and the clan, here's what we do to the motherfuckin' Clan, Let's move

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
They got me mobbin like I'm Loc'ed
And ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - b-blaaastin
I'm a nut and drinkin Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why? 'Cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
But will they can I see
And everyday it just a struggle
Steady thuggin' in the streets
And I'll be ballin' loc
Don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to Mutha I'm touched
I'm kickin dust up
Ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
Until they kill me
I'll be livin this life
I know you feel me
There's so much pain

[Chorus (2Pac)]
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
