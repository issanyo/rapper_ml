[Trae]
This gon be the realest shit I ever wrote, so just know it's deeper than rap
It was a lot of shit that go, but now I'm bringing it back
I been a G all of my life, and tried to hold it for the best
I'm the realest nigga living, they can write it when I rest
Fuck it put me with the best, and I can stand out on my own
It's survival of the truth, and I'll be coming for the throne
Fuck being a bigger man, niggas played the game wrong
So I played it how they played it, while remaining in my zone
These niggas hoes, that's why they keep my name in they mouth
It ain't hard to find me, bitch nigga I'm the streets of the South
And ain't no banging over wax, nigga come see me in the hood
In the section where fake is twisted, like the W in wood
I been repping since I was 12, but now I'm 25 strong
With the family of A.B.N., running and toting some'ing chrome
I never trained to be in battle, even though I been at war
Mob made motherfucker, prolly leave you with a scar I'm the truth

[Hook: Billy Cook]
This be the realest, the realest shit I ever wrote
This be the realest, the realest shit I ever spoke
All I know is, (this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote)
All I know is, that I'm gon be the truth

[Trae]
They better know I peep everything in the game, they got me looking at my life different
Niggas out here thinking they can know it, if my vibe different
These other niggas out here falsified, telling lies
Sell a couple records, now they profitized keep it real
You niggas ain't got the credibility, to be the truth
Unless you out here living what you talking, in the booth
Everyday it be the same, niggas know I'm in the lane
Only fucking with the killers, cause we feel eachother pain
I hit the highway with my niggas, never toching the caine
Now they got me watching for the FEDs, bitches mention my name
Since I'm the leader of the gang, it make it hard for me to move
I'm the truth, it ain't gon be a pretty sight for me to lose
Trae bail on street shit, got it on a lock
Everytime I'm going off, niggas done got it on the block
Never something that it's not, I only know of being Trae
And that's the truth every motherfucking day, it ain't no other way

[Hook]

[Trae]
Niggas saying I got the name to be the truth, and I ain't even mad at em
But that expression on they face, had me taking jabs at em
This a warning shot, ever seen a nigga at his last
If you haven't, I advise you let this motherfucker pass
I ain't here to be mistaken, so respect it when I spit it
Fuck it keep it yourself, cause anyone of you's will get it
I'm a Asshole, and it's self explained by the anger
And I'm holding on a Glock, that's keeping one up in the chamber
I'ma strut it like a gangsta, so my niggas get they bang on
Hopping out the slab, Dickies sagging with my chains on
Hopping fly, cause they seen the dropper with them thangs on
Lord knows, Trae'll leave them niggas with they brains blown
I'm in another zone, niggas still on cloud nine
And I'm a loner, you niggas don't need to crowd mine
Trae the Truth is what it is, niggas know it's time
Plus I'm here to make em lay it down, 'fore I spray it down

[Billy Cook]
The truth be the realest shit I ever spoke, be the realest shit I ever wrote
(this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote)
Be the realest shit I ever spoke, be the realest shit I ever wrote - 2X

[Trae]
This be the realest shit, I ever spoke
Even if they never see it, this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote
Pay attention, to the shit I quote
Even if they never hear it, this gon be the realest shit I ever spoke - 2X

(*Billy Cook*)
One hundred percent real, one hundred percent reeeeeal
Heeeey, Trae let em know ooooh
This be the realest shit, that I ever spoke and wrote
This is the truth, heeeey
