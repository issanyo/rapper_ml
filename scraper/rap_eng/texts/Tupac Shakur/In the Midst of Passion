In the midst of passion 2 figures stand
emerged in ecstasy joined hand and hand
words R unnecessary feelings R heart
the body takes control deaf 2 words
It is at this stage that I think of u
in gratitude 4 this joy u have exposed me 2
Each Day is Bright with you as the Dawn
with the collapse of each night a strong bond is born
In the midst of passion I remember your kiss
I reminisce about your touch and suddenly miss
the scent u wear and the tone of your voice
Only u can be my choice
In the midst of passion
I c u & me
Lost in constant ecstasy!!
