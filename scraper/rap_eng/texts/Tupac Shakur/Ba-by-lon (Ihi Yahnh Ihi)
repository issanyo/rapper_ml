[Verse 1: Vaani Shiest]
Crumblin' another tree
Pipe in the dime piece
Shootin' the birds, sprayin the bees
Serpentine tendencies
Hold tongue before you mention me
Seekin' each and every evening for one epiphany
Grippin' zz's getting lost in Herbies e-spliffianies
The E keep me in harmony
The P got me complacent B
Tossin' in them sweaty sheets that kept me wake in recent weeks
When you trying to live blissfully its hard to maintain consistency
Down to the nitty gritty plottin' to take a lap of luxury
Put them herringbones and cuban links on a black henley
Maui Wowie in them bronchies, flick the ashies on the dashie
Ruggedds stuffy with duckettes, contention's bones on my necklace
Novae givin' the OK to render these bitches helpless
Vices leavin niggas lifeless
Identity crisis over them prices
H-to-the-K, equipped with the silence
Leave you leakin' outta yo sinuses
Dead presidents got niggas evil
Til' it kill you with the needle

[Interlude: Vaani Shiest]
Shots ring out, children scarred from the cacophony
While our elders play the lottery
Self-righteous making a mockery
Gossippin' and guzzlin' 40z, committin' adultery
The lords temple is the source of this hypocrisy
Convicted felons NORE
3rd strikin' ouncin' lowkey - incogni
In neighborhoods - foreign of former glory
Baseheads with the llelo all in they respiratory
Whipping through with the homies shaking heads, lordie lordie

[Verse 2: Vaani Shiest]
A league of assassins - plottin' against my people with chemicals
Rainin down from the atmosphere - death, continual
Caught in this continuum, survivin' off the bare minimum
Let the bell toll from Darfur onto Syria
Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya
Egypt, Ethiopia, and those slain for oil & opium
These bitches ain't got no soles melanoma all in they toes
Babylon, propaganda polluted souls
In the North young niggas gettin' folded like origami
Churches on every corner but we still not finding God b
Assalamulaikum to the populace
Light the piff and take a hit, and act like I don't remember shit
Puffin' on that white widow 'til my face is a weeping willow
Got her face all in the pillow, tell her to pop it and man it jiggle
I'm succumbin to jealously over my friendlies
Barely conscious to my own depravity
Mediocrity is conformity

[Interlude 2: Vaani SHiest]
Lighters up for a Mazel Tov
But all we get is a Molotov
Pumps sawed-off, 9x19s and Kalishnikovs
Youngins man they trappin' em
Choppas they keep blastin' em
Our hoods drenched in piss
Streets lined with dead kids
Misfits, and infants - born into rebellion
Parents fried of paraphenalia
These streets is helter-skelter
Potent tokin' till I di-al-late
Hopin' the chronic take me to a higher state....

[Verse 3: Vaani Shiest]
I and I be free - to establish inity
Absent the disparity, teach youth of Kemetian dynasties
Haile Selaisse ya, just wanna see the light of Jah
Heed the deceiver, in the midst of mammon even the light can deceive ya
I gotta little sunshine, now I sublime rhyme with a sound mind
That rum-pum-pum - dun-dun-dun - B.I.P graffiti mentions
All of the Gunplay, rembranting the ghetto gray-scale
And with every cigarette flick, I guess niggas content with livin' the frail
Life - Might as well leave well enough alone and knapsack with my vagabonds
Tampon Evangelion with Leviathan nigga carry on
Can't help it all the pharisees of the fairest sex want to Ferris me
After the Sunday serpent sermon, she serpent tonguing my little heirs to be
Babylon, Babylon - why you so appealin'
Why I lose my sanctity, and wind up killing my own, creepin'
Why you open yo legs of vanity knowin' it'll only kill me
Eating yo pussy with a Chelsea Grin, hoping yo nectar heal me

[Interlude 3: Vaani Shiest]
They speak of heaven to me, I never heard of the place
How am I suppose to confide in a nigga that never shows his face ?
A little hennessey and heresy never hurt nobody
I rather die enormous than live dormant ... by any means necessary

[End: Makaveli]
...And all that other shit is to control you
If the churches took half the money they was making and gave it back to the community, we'd be alright
If they take half the buildings that they use to praise God, and give it to motherfuckers who need god; we'd be alright
We'd be alright
Have you seen some of these goddamn churches lately?
Its ones that take up the whole block in New York
It's homeless people out here
Why God ain't letting them stay there?
Why these niggas got gold ceilings and shit?
Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me?
Why do God need colored windows to talk to me?
Why God can't come to where I'm at? Where he sent me?
If God wanted to talk to me in a pretty spot like that; why'd he send me here then?
You know what I mean?
That make ghetto kids not believe in God
Why?
