Can you see the pride in the Panther
As he grows in splendor and grace
Toppling obstacles placed in the way,
of the progression of his race.

Can you see the pride in the Panther
as she nurtures her young all alone
The seed must grow regardless
of the fact that it is planted in stone.

Can you see the pride in the Panther
as they unify as one.
The flower blooms with brilliance,
and outshines the rays of the sun.
