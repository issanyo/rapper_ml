Ya we music
Those who are rich will become poor
And those who are poor will become rich ..

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Check it out
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and still not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained and
Military mind of a thug lord, sitting' in the cemetery crying'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, every body's listening'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peeps bumping' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight


[Chorus: DJ DX]
This is the way to get by
So much pain in my eyes
Better Days....
We can make it a better day
It's to live or to die
It's so hard to survive
Better Days....
We can make it a better day
This is the way to get by
So much pain in my eyes
Better Days....
We can make it a better day
It's to live or to die
It's so hard to survive
Better Days....
We can make it a better day

[Verse 2: DJ DX]
Why does life have to be so
Hard for Rob? Stuck in the system trying to make a living
Just to feed my children, unemployment denied my rights
Is it wrong or is it right? I gave you my life through this mic
Just to inspire your life, It's be trife in the struggle trying to hustle
Moving piano's, I had girl named Carmen, she always called me Diego!
I write my lyrics in San Serif, read the manuscript, can't you tell
I mastered this?! When i make money, nobody gonna take from me, I'm a take all my
Money and feed the people that's hungry, that's my deed and when I'm done
I'm going to pull down my pants and give the Government my ass to kiss!
'Cause I'm a Philanthropist that's pissed, and I'm getting tired of this bullshit, to live
In this world you gotta live with fullfilness, I guess ya ll done killed it
When y'all took down them buildings.....  One love!

[Chorus: DJ DX]
This is the way to get by
So much pain in my eyes
Better Days....
We can make it a better day
It's to live or to die
It's so hard to survive
Better Days....
We can make it a better day
This is the way to get by
So much pain in my eyes
Better Days....
We can make it a better day
It's to live or to die
It's so hard to survive
Better Days....
We can make it a better day

[Outro Poem: DJ DX]
Through the storm
And through all the pain
Through all the torture
That drove me insane
We gon make it a better day
When i ain't have no food
And no place to stay
I told you mommy, we can make it a better day
God knows what i feel, If i can make it
Then you can make it, If you can make it
Then we can make it a better day
