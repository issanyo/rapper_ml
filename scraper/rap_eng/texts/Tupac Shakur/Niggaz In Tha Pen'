[2Pac talking]
Yeah this for my nigga Mike Cooley
Keep your motherfuckin' head up boi
For my niggas in the pen'
Fuck the police nigga
Yeah, uh
In '93 it's gettin' rougher motherfucker
It's for my nigga in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out or when my ass get in
(They got no love for me here)

[Hook]
This is for my niggas in the pen'

[Verse 1: Mopreme Shakur]
Let them loose, let them loose like Bruce
We need a new pants
Swooped on our uncle Sam
Now here we go again
Blacks in the back with the Monkeys on they back
Most are dyin' for crack and catchin' bullets where they neck, uh
Hit the rat's in the Jailhouse travel up to get out
Get out, cause I'm out, but out of my mind
To every man that's in my family
No, you understand me?
My homeboy 2, they can't fade you
Me myself, well I'm livin' life extra
Cause sometimes soon I feel I might be next
Tell it just like sex, every bodies got to feel it for they self
And the ones with the wealth, need to sit on my shelf
See what I see when out on the streets daily (Da da duh da da)
Need a little meat, potatoes and gravy
Game don't stop, Cops get popped (Da da duh da da)
Cop's pop back, kids'll catch it in the neck
So

[Hook]
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
(They got no love for me here)
If not when I get in
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
(They got no love for me here)
If not when I get in

[Verse 2: Mouse Man]
To my brothers in the pen' huh
Kinda straigh-ten, nothings changed
Still strugglin', hustlin', tryin' to stay a head of the game
It's all about money the hell about the fame
It's a shame, how mean the media can be to ya' man
I'll see you in about two
Have a party, blunts and brews, lip a honey dip or two, ah
You've been gone for along time, I'm
Reminiscin' of the old times, old crimes
I might see ya' sooner, than I expected
My P.O. said one more red mark on my record
Ten years he straight burst my bubble
I gotta calm down and stay out of trouble
Keep gettin' stronger and no longer they try to hold us down
The craziest things will be when you get out of lock down
Big up big up's to my jailhouse
Crew, this one's for you

[Hook]
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
(They got no love for me here)
If not when I get in
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
(They got no love for me here)
If not when I get in

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice, no peace
Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line
My two nines, go "Baya baya" when I shoot 'em
Korean motherfucker's was crooked, so niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night
My niggas catch the Devil at the lights straight take his life
So don't sleep when my Jeep creep up, how we hit 'em?
Empty the clip, then dip cause we did 'em
Lickin' off shots for Latasha that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now?
I packed a .9 last year, in '93 I'm packin' two now
Representin' for my niggas locked up
Time to blow the blocks up
My niggas in the pen'

[Hook]
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
They got knocked when I get there
(They got no love for me here)
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
They got knocked when I get there
(They got no love for me here)
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
They got knocked when I get there
(They got no love for me here)
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
They got knocked when I get there
(They got no love for me here)
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
They got knocked when I get there
(They got no love for me here)
This is for my niggas in the pen'
I'll see you when you get out
They got knocked when I get there
(They got no love for me here)
