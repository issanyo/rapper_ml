(Hook)
I won’t deny it (I can’t change)
I’ma straight ridah (I can’t change)
You dont wanna fuck with me !
Got these fcuk boys hating on me
But they can’t do nothing to a G

(Chorus)
(I won’t deny it)
I can’t change, its clear I’ma always be the same
(I won’t deny it)
Please Lord forgive me
(I’ma straight ridah)
I can’t change
(But they can’t do nothing to a G)

(Verse 1 : T.H-C )
Step up on the scene all eyes on me, they say “T.H  you  G , cause of the life you lead” I’m a product of the cold streets,of the CPT  find me grinding in the midst of freeze, I keep the heat with me, New beefs every week, but shit, the conclusion is, I make the weak end, leave em leaking barely breathing, all work no breathers with a milli on my mind, through my speakers Rich forever bumps as I grind, its just the life, we live it not to die, but death is spread out like Tik in the mother city, though she was my step my mother, she embraced me like her sons blood brother, I never stop though my momma ask will it change, I say “Yeah” but its clear I’ll always be the same, until the end of time, its T.H-C, the first of a dying breed

(Chorus)

(Verse 2 : The Genesis)
Born rough and rugged, My attitude is fuck it , only God can judge it and my ambitionz az a ridah got me trendsetting , my bitch’s friend getting, I’m the shit, straight out God’s anus, worth my weight in gold, pound for pound, my sound is the sound of the streets that I grew in, where the cruelest is the coolest, never foolish, I came up from the shameless, not tryna be famous, I just wanna be paid up, you not talking paper? Say what? Save it, we grown, talking more 0’s, always been this way, might change cities, but its clear, I’ll always be the same, until the end of time, I’ll always be on my grind

A ridah till I die x3

I’m a straight ridah till I die
(Chorus)

I can't change for shit mother fucker !
(Verse 3 : Gensis)
Because I’m on the streets, doing dirt, lil kids getting hurt , daddy gone doing work mama wearing that mini skirt , brenda had a baby, all my niggas be shady, only God can judge us cause we do this shxt on the daily, in this white man's world, i’m guaranteed to get more gold,with my makaveli flow, i be troublesome yo’ , cause I see no changes and they’ll never be peace, so I pull out my piece and fucking shoot at you strangers
(Chorus)

(Outro)
Yeah man, wassup its me and genesis..
