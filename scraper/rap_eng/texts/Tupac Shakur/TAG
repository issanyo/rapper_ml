[Intro: Al Right]
Something great’s gonna tear us apart
And I guess one day I’ll be leaving your heart regardless
Of the days that we threw in the dark
Are my explanations better than a superstar?
‘Cause one day I’ll be reaching the stars
And god bless your face and the way that you are, so heartless
You’re the bitch I will never recall, is that correct to mention?
‘Cause now I got a new direction

‘Cause now I got a new direction
Unless you give me more erections

[Verse 1: Al Right]
It is always so appalling the way your body moving
In the club I’d be looking for that shit all evening
This ain’t a punk so why do you look so mad
I am just another middle finger to the douchebags
And a fucking tag problem, uh
Okay I got it this is something worth solving, uh
But if you’re looking at me I can’t help the non-sense
That’s right up in my face like I’ve just seen a phantom
This is for my best friends this is for the haters
This is for my one thousand fans on my page, no
This is for my cell phone fuck I need a pager
‘Cause everybody’s calling like they want a whore, just another
But I am no longer playing with bitches
Unless I got to throw out the dishes and eat a pussy for my breakfast
I am kind of random this shit is electric
Fuck all handsome, ugly is the new shit
Well I am the new shit come and try to test me
And LPJ had these bitches down for breast feed
This ain’t what I aim for but fuck it if you mess with me
I will lead your body corpse up to the airport
And fly you to Miami where the sun is dry
No wonder why you’ve been living in a lie
I was fucking with the truth making babies by the dozen
I ain’t fucking with no youth I don’t like my generation
I’d rather cross words than cross fit
Use a Apple Bottom Jeans reference to the club, bitch all of this had me noxious
I’d be looking for the proper ways just lend on templates
But these motherfuckers don’t have faith
I guess I’ll go on with the beats that I’m making and the bitches I’m screwing
I thought we started from the bottom now we’re here was a legend
I’m getting way more confident on my way to the top
I’m holding puffs I’m not looking to stop

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me baby is it cool to touch?
Tell a man that you can trust, not just a fool to loss
Coming to get you on a bust
It’s so ironic
Exotic on the verge of erotic
I'm hitting switches on misses like I been fixed with hydraulics
My up and down like a roller coaster, here I come inside you
I ain't stopping ’til the show is over, cause I'ma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of something to fly about
Catch you at a club, your hips got me fending
Body talking quick to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doing eighty on the freeway, catch me if you can
Forgive me i'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, plus the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin’s switch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, the champagne, Hennessey
A favorite of my homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what my folks need
Make some more cheese, funk, ya don't need
Approachin ladies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy sugar now tell me how you want it

[Outro: Al Right]
That marijuana got me thinking I could be the one you wanted
So goes the end of the story
