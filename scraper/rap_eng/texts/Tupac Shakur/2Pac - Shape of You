Staring at the world through my rear-view
Go on baby scream to God he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast because it is time to die
Getting high watching time fly
Why will we?

Staring at the world through my rear-view
Go on baby scream to God he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast because it is time to die
Getting high watching time fly, you know?
Staring at the world through my review
Go on baby scream to God he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast because it is time to die
Getting high watching time fly

And all my motherfuckers
Staring through my rear-view
Go on baby scream to God he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast because it is time to die
Getting high watching time fly

Come on baby follow me lead
[m-m-m-m]

Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggas is calling cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped caring
Last night two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me then they lie to me
Product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed
Now the little baby's crazed raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turning bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend
I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview


Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, counting days in this living black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder
Baby, let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

Now I know the answers to the question
“Do dreams come true?”
Still staring at the world through my rearview
I said now I know the answers, “Do dreams come true?”
Staring at the world through my rearview

Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers
