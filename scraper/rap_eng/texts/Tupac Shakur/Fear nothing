[Intro]
Look, Look

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
My niggas crooked though it seems
My every single thought is caught up in collecting cream
A made nigga; picture me dying in a blaze of gun fire
Will not retire til I'm paid, turn the base up higher
When we ride, we fly by, bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 125, and Do or Die
Rolling with niggas from Long Beach to Long Isl'
I hardly smile cause my heart froze
Once I; commence my show rip apart foes
And now I, got One Nation it's a crooked compilation
Just to end the bullshit, let's get back to money making
Tell them busters that I rolled on controlling the house
My shit is so wicked when I flip, niggas closing their mouth
The Cocoa Brodaz, Buckshot the BDI Thug
Greg Nice, L.S., Asu, so show a nigga love, Outlaw!

[Chorus]
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
It's the Don Daddy with the Villain, who you killing
Oh we hate them, come verbatim with this cap peeling
Top billin, make a million
Paparazzi, chase us through the tunnel in the Maserati
On parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin a plea, ain't no stoppin a G
I'm in the 6 you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily I drop a ki properly
They call me the Don Dada
Pop a collar, drop a dollar if you hear me you can holla
Even rottweilers, follow, the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? nigga I'm a scholar
The incredible, hetero-sexual, credible
Beg a hoe, let it go, dick ain't edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
While you hand picked motherfuckers givin up transcripts

[Chorus]
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
You can't break me, never make me busta soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Delores Tucker sue me I won't stop
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies, tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites whistlin' Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure
I'ma make you sorry, Trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can they stop me? (won't)
Tryna sell 4 million copies (done)
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we comin' from
Life as an Outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop

[Outro]
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life
