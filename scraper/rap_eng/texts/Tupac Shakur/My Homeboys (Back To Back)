[Intro; Kurupt + (2Pac)]
You know what I'm saying?
There's a lot of things going on
You know, you've got to stay strong, you've got to be right! (My homeboys)
Keep your mind right, you know what I'm saying Eastwood?
Don't play too many games, you know it's like a generation gap (My homeboys)
There's a lot of things going on, you've got to keep your head right
That's what Pac used to tell us (My homeboys)
You've got to think towards the future
That's what Pac used to tell us
You know what I mean, Eastwood? (My homeboys)
If Pac was here you know what he'd say?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried than see us parted
Keep 'em close to my heart, 'cause we the ones that got this shit started
You recollect we used to bust on snitches
Nobody comes before my niggas, fuck all you bitches
All my homeboys are self-sufficient
So we suspicious of you scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner, but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other 'cause we closer than brothers, it's like we kin
We known for getting the party popping when my squad walks in
Throw up your hands, baby, buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest Ducking bullets, snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world know me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

[Chorus: Kurupt & Eastwood + (2Pac)]
Back to back, together forever we stand
And if you're down for your homies, let me see your hands
Two-step with me, left to right
Me and my homies keep it popping all night (My homeboys)
Back to back, together forever we stand
And if you're down for your homies, let me see your hands
Two-step with me, left to right
Me and my homies keep it popping all night (My homeboys)

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
Well, I'm the E and I bang with the Row
To the 'Wood rolling the Gestapo!
I'm a self-made rider of many
Catch us hanging at your local club, thugged out, guzzling Remy
I'm the reason why your heat don't work
Most of you cowards and
When it comes to hammers, you can't work the jerk
I'm frontline with the homies, and I ain't gonna' lie, I keeps it real
I'm pushing big body Benz on them big boy rims
We're fifty deep in SUV's full of ammo
With Death Row medallions, call us the Row Sopranos
We keep it packing; what's happening?
We've got them chrome toys
Me and my homies got a force that you can't ignore
Slip me the 9, I'm ready to ride for my homeboys
Yeah, with Death Row, it's do or die with my homeboys
That's on grandma, 'til my soul is free
I'ma smash for the homies, hope they smash for me

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah finally, a record with Pac, and a real one
That he really rolled with, from here to the Brazilians
I'll leave you soaking wet
I got a simple homicidal Tourette
The line gets pushed 'til y'all respect
Or fall, lose your life, sight and all your breath
To all y'all busters all across the globe
Kick back and let the real ones roll
I've got a military mind frame, I've got a military artillery mind frame
I'm about to show you how a real hood ride, mayne
Switch it in and out, go for the second lane
Me and my homeboys do so many different things
Some love to pimp, and some gang bang
We keep it G no matter what, I thought you knew about us
Me and all the homies, y'all can't live without us

[Chorus: Kurupt & Eastwood + (2Pac)]
Back to back, together forever we stand
And if you're down for your homies, let me see your hands
Two-step with me, left to right
Me and my homies keep it popping all night (My homeboys)
Back to back, together forever we stand
And if you're down for your homies, let me see your hands
Two-step with me, left to right
Me and my homies keep it popping all night (My homeboys)

[Verse 4:Kurupt]
I gotta roll like a real hood, through the streets
Pac, Gotti, and Eastwood, let's just rack it all up
Let's see who's the best, come to my Waco, Texas, Gotti Koresh
'Bout to ride on bustas and accept nothing less
And smother y'all like as if Pac never left
I can see you in disguise when I look in your eyes
If Pac were alive, half of y'all woulda died

[Chorus: Kurupt & Eastwood + (2Pac)]
Back to back, together forever we stand
And if you're down for your homies, let me see your hands
Two-step with me, left to right
Me and my homies keep it popping all night (My homeboys)
Back to back, together forever we stand
And if you're down for your homies, let me see your hands
Two-step with me, left to right
Me and my homies keep it popping all night (My homeboys)
