(Verse 1)

Look At  The World  Today  We  Gotta Over Come Are  Past

And  Go  To Are Future Life is  What You  Make  it Real  Talk  You

Gotta  Think To  Your Self Do You  Wanna Go  That  Wrong Route

Or You  Do You  Wanna  Go That Right  Route Dont Wanna End Up '

In  Jail  Thats Not  The  Right Thing So  In My  Mind I  Say  To  My  Self

Young  Kids Stick To  Your Education Because  Me  I  Took  Education

For  A Joke  I Thought It  Was Nothing  For  Real  But  Look At Me

Know I'm Trying  To  Go Back To College To  Get My  Education You

Need  Money  This  Is  Life  God  Come First All  The Time  Health

Come Second Family  Come  Third And  Money  Comes  Fourth  Yes

I  Look At  Everything That  Life Over  Came .  I  Say  To My  Self

Sometimes Why The People  Doing  All This  Negative in  Life

Every time I Turn  On  CNN I  See  Another  Black  Brother  Become

A  Victom   To  Streets I  See  People Dying  Just  To Ride The  Metro

Man  I Think  To  My Self  What This  Life   Coming To  Is This  The  End

Times  The  Book  Of  Mathew:13:32  Will  Tell  You  That  Real Talk
