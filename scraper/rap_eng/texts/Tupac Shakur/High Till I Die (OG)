[2Pac talking]
(Coughing)
Oh shit
(Coughing)
Damn
Ay, this for you punk motherfucker's in Marin

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Game true, ain't got time for fools
Money on my mind so my nine rules
Time to, make weight, niggas gettin' crazy paid
And hatin' bitches for the games they play
So nigga, pull quick
But better be quicker than the next, motherfucker on the, trigger
Cause I'm static
Startin' to be a fuckin' havoc gotta keep my automatic or get my ass kicked
When I'm in traffic, it's kinda rough and, I drive a bucket
Live the Thug Life nigga screaming, fuck It
Love to throw my middle finger to the Police
No bucks, no justice, no peace
Smokin' blunts till I pass out (Coughing)
Yeah nigga, gettin' assed out
Rollin' in my nigga's glass house
Drivin' fast, talkin' to bitches whippin' cash out
I'm with my niggas, so fuck the suckers, buck the busters
Smokin' Chronic motherfucker's causin' ruckus
It's the last of the Dank, pull over
Can't hear a damn thing sober
High till I die

[Souljah talking]
Uh, unfadeable
Like, can't be fucked with
Like, umm, niggas can't touch this shit yeah
Like umm, back the fuck up motherfucker
Rated R finna flex on you punk ass busters
You better feel this nigga
Rated

[Verse 2: Rated R]
I stay high whilst that Chronic shifts
24/7 all I hear then the Indo splits
Choke in my Karl Kani, I think about death too much that's why I smoke my brains out
So I can relax and kick back
Come off on a dope track with a ?? sack
I got my Death for the punk niggas want peace
Fuck peace nigga, cause I'm playin' for keeps
I got mercy, I squabble for a knot
Pump flex in my ?? on a blood spot
Let me stop and put some petrol in my tank
Mack serve up the Dank I'm finna hold up this place
Put my Ski mask on
Jump out like a motherfucker cocked, locked, chrome
I'm thinkin' about that mean ass spree
Get in my room and make my getaway clean
Know what I mean its about ?? niggas
Smokin' my Chronic sack fuck you bitches

[Souljah talking]
Yeah nigga, punk ass hoes
Thug Life, all across the country
We want all the thugs to get untied
You know what I'm saying
Mack motherfuckin' 10

[Verse 3: Macadoshis]
I graduated from the school of Hard Knocks
At the age of Seventeen I went to camp for slangin' rocks
A young nigga with nothin' to live for
All I ever wanted was a squeeze and a 6-4
But now they got a nigga trapped in the system
I pop a Cop, when he drop, I piss on him
I smoke blunts like it's a religion
It's 187, on a motherfuckin' stool pigeon
Might swoop in my coupe with the flat boots
Don't have to make me to shoot when I'm looting
Gotta wait two years cause I'm struggling
Fuck strugglin' I'd rather stay buzzing
I live the Thug Life nigga till I die
And if I do dope ??, just hit the blunt and get high
Cause a nigga like me stays down till death
Kicked up dust, to smoke blunts till my last breathe

[Souljah talking]
Ha ha, high till I motherfuckin' die
Run nigga, run nigga, I'm on ya

[Chorus: 2Pac & Souljah x3]
High till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till my casket drop
High till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till my casket drop
I'm high till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till my casket drop
High till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till my casket drop
High till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till the casket drop
High till I die

Yeah, stay high till I die
(This go out to all my partners, and all my real niggas)
High till I die
(Yeah)
Blaze that shit man, light it up man
High till I die
(You know what I'm saying)
(It's on, yeah)
