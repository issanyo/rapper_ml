[Intro]
Yeah...
I mean damn, I know what you're thinking it's like: (Yo this shit is Jazzed up, DAMN)
Imma pull this one off right?
Yeah, well. You take some Jazz... (Yeah?)
With a little bit of that Thug shit I got going on here right now...
You come up with this:(with this) (Ready?)
(Yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Drop the top let the wind blow
I'm rolling nothing but the lab while i'm mobbin' with my kin first
Ready for the world, catch me bustin' at my adversaries
I hope they ready for the cemetery
Juveniles runnin' wild back in Rikers Isle
Makin' motherfucker bleed when they grip the crowd
Show no mercy or be dead now
The Game is funny so you better keep your head down, I'm talkin' money now
Cross my trues as I break the rules, a lot of rappers sellin' out, watch the Game improve
Hard hairs make them sore fast
You must have lost your mind if you ever tried to stop Kas'
Keys give me the beat and let me rock a motherfucker back to sleep as I creep in my black Jeep
I sweep niggas off they feet as soon as they make a move
And I still got nothin' to lose

[Hook]
I hear them talkin', don't come my way
Don't you know that we don't play? (Cause we don't play)
We be on the block all day
Plus my cat spits for me. (Spits for me)
It's just Another One That Bites The Dust
So Bite The Dust. (Yeah)
It's just Another One That Bites The Dust
So Bite The Dust

[Verse 2]
And when they mention my name, these cowards wasn't ready
They screamin' 'Who that is soundin' like Makaveli?'
It's Kasinova Tha Don, I'll be the Next to Bomb
I got these cowards still shakin' with they nuts in they palms
And now the Game is over, so let the truth be told
Niggas need to call it quits because that ass too bold
Watch 'em fall when I'm all down
Switch spots, Hip-Hop got a guard now, so kick rocks
Let me show you how to make a hit:
You take a lil' bit of Jazz with a Thug twist, and light a spliff
Let your mind not tolerate the green
So when it settles at the level you can start to dream, i'll right Supreme
Watch the force I bring, rappers falling under pressure
Now they hoping to see my team
Create a zone that they scared to touch
Disrespect me if you want, never scared to rush
It's just Another One That Bites The Dust

[Hook]
I hear them talkin', don't come my way
Don't you know that we don't play? (Cause we don't play)
We be on the block all day
Plus my cat spits for me. (Spits for me)
It's just Another One That Bites The Dust
So Bite The Dust. (Yeah)
It's just Another One That Bites The Dust
So Bite The Dust

[Verse 3]
Money's my mission, my congress agreed too
So don't be waitin' for another man to feed you
And stay true, remain humble, brother make pay
This how I screw these motherfuckers in my own way
Running from the law with my vest on
Gotta keep my pistol smokin' bustin' at they Teflon
But if i'm wrong know i'm hopeless
I'm never giving up runnin' cause i'm focused
So know i'm picking up the mic because i'm making noise
I start to read the press, I can't believe they paranoid
And so i'm stressed to all the bullshit will come alive
And they will take you out the Game if you ever tried
I swear to God I've been lost as an adolescent
I couldn't sleep, got me waiting with my loaded weapon
Im yelling 'Peace!' but nobody never wanna listen
They start to scream when somebody really turn up missing
And in position, hard times in the world degree
We confuse everyday, for what we need
The seeds need a lil more love! while we all wait
And when I take one for the team watch them hard break

[Hook]
I hear them talkin', don't come my way
Don't you know that we don't play? (Cause we don't play)
We be on the block all day
Plus my cat spits for me. (Spits for me)
It's just Another One That Bites The Dust
So Bite The Dust. (Yeah)
It's just Another One That Bites The Dust
So Bite The Dust
