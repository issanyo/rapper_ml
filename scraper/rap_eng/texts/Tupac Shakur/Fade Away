[Chorus: 2Pac]
He who writes for Billboard Charts
But kicks no material from inside the heart
They fade away, fade away

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Okay, now let's take a look, what do we got now?
To the second looks, the crooks gon' prop now
All these mean muggin' brothers from the streets
Have turned into tender lovin' rubbin' club beats
I just don't understand it and frankly I don't get it
And even if it is, better fakin' I ain't wit' it
So if you lookin' for a fool, you can pass me
No funky footsteps here, so don't even ask me
That's why dancers on the payroll gettin' paid
But it ain't no dancers in the studio when the record's made
It's just me and Big D goin' buckwild, on top of the pile
I'm giving emcees nuts styles
So come come make you done if you feel it wrong
Lay low and lean but sleep and I'ma pull ya cards
2Pacalypse is rockin' it for the public
Bumping it and they love it and I'm hit like Razor Ruddock
So what you wanna do now? You and your crew are through now
Think the ice is meltin', 'cause brothers are comin' true now
Hitting it with the furious styles, and I'm paid to say
Hip-hop's here to stay, they fade away

[Chorus]
He who writes for Billboard Charts
But kicks no material from inside the heart
They fade away, fade away

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
To Mister [?] look alike
Hook it like crook, I step-fucker and took your mic
And when there's not a single instrument playin'
And ain't nobody prayin', I can't hear a word that you sayin'
Heard you sold two million records in a million states
But there's a million faker and mill get snakes sellin' a million tapes
And the typical types don't impress me
She's depressed on the quest to undress me
Sometimes I jest, I don't vest, so don't test me
This ain't no bus, so don't rush or arrest me
Don't disrespect me, punk, I'm a citizen
Making money and rippin' angels is beautiful world we're living in
Looking at the Grammy nominations, smilin' in my face and
Waitin' to take my place at the pace of a corporation
This is just a taste of the aggravation, frustration
Having a faith in your occupation
Cops think I'm selling a [?] I'm selling tapes and
Tryna take my race to the better place and
Peace to the brothers that paved the way
Rollin' over in they grave today while they fade away

[Chorus]
He who writes for Billboard Charts
But kicks no material from inside the heart
They fade away, fade away
He who writes for Billboard Charts
But kicks no material from inside the heart
They fade away, fade away

[Break]
Fade away
Fade away
[?] Never fade away
[?] Never fade away
[?] Never fade away
[?] Never fade away

[Verse 3]
[?] never fade away and
We don't deal with tryin' to fade away
[?] away with an AK
[?]
[?]
[?] try to fade away
[?] they all run away
Away an AK

[Break]
Never fade away
Never fade away (never, no!)
Never fade away
Never fade, never fade, never never fade away

[Chorus]
He who writes for Billboard Charts
But kicks no material from inside the heart
So fade away, fade away

[Outro]
