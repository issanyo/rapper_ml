[Intro: 2Pac]
Me and my closest road dog (To my nigga Big Mussolini)
You know what's up (Big Syke)
West side (Thug Life baby)
Outlaw (the return of the mashes)
You know how we do it
HaHaHaHa

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Shit half the times we fought and caused trouble
My closest road dog, it was cool 'cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin' wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin' cases
Indeed, it was misery driven by my own demons
'cause they was killin' me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin' deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight
Tonight's the night, murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at ya
It's all political, runnin' from the future
Escapin' in the fog, live yo' life like a hog nigga
Me and my closest road dogs

[Collision: 2Pac]
[Track 1]
All my enemies scatter, it don't matter
They can't see me
These niggas wanna see me dead
Bullets in my head
They can't see my closest road dog!
Just me and my closest road dog
You know how we mash these motherfuckers
They can feel it!
To the realest motherfuckers: you know me, Big Syke

[Track 2]
Me and my closest road dog!
Mussolini, Makaveli, true to the belly, fuck 'em all!
Me and my closest road dogs
Untouchable motherfuckin' worldwide mob figures
Death Row, westside, when we ride, our enemies die
You know what time is
Mussolini!

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Hold my Glock, my mind's in jeopardy
My thoughts in pass, I know I'll die soon
So there's no need to add, "How will my homeboys remember me"
Bury me a G, casket full of Hennessy
We Thug Life niggas, watch for a second comin'
'Cause I can see the sun
Automatic gunfire makin' all them niggas run
Run from the future, escapin' from the fog
Livin' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dog

[Verse 3:  Mussolini]
Future has been dark, since little locs in the park
We kept it tight, searchin' for a light but none in sight
I know God see a nigga in this turmoil suspense
Trapped in this gutter, residence I'm convinced
We commence to smash, hit the cash is all we wanted
With the desire expired, 'cause every hood is haunted
By killers and jackers, tryin' to make it as a street hog
Bustin' out a coupe in the smog, justâ€”

[Hook: Mussolini]
Me and my road dog
Nigga, just me and my road dog
Makaveli just me and my road dog (road dog, nigga)
Just me and my road dog
Just me and my road dog

[Verse 4:  Mussolini]
Everything we did as kids was for the turf
Tryin' to make it work, and my women is gettin' her feelings hurt
See that's my road dog, and you my road pup baby
Not likin' him and sweatin' me is makin' shit crazy
Hazy days with penitentiary ways, don't make me choose
Cemetery days escalates, so you know you lose
I'm cruisin' through chaos, drivin' through her county
Disappear off the earth, only my road dog could find me
Always on the side of me, and danger parleyin' ain't no better days
Took off to stay down forever to our dyin' days
I pray to Yahweh every night to leave this white across
Whoever go first, don't let the other get lost
Playa Boss is what we call ourselves, soon as we got a taste of wealth
Now we sound like niggas with a bigger arsenal on our shelf
Train this group of G's, death before dishonor
Shakin' fleas, fuck with these you a goner, my age partner
On my side when we ride and synchronize information
Makin' hits, pullin' licks buildin' our reputation
In the hood, from a tiny to a G hog
Nothing comes close nigga, than me and my road dog
Just me and road dog
Livin' on the mutherfuckin' edge
Just me and road dog
Nigga, just me and my road dog
Just me and my road dog
