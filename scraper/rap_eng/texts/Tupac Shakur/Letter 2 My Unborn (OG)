[Intro: 2Pac]
To my unborn child
This goes out to my unborn child
In case I don't make it
Just remember daddy love y'all
Did everything I could do to make a way for me and you
So don't worry about what people say about me (To my unborn)
You know daddy loves you

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed since I'm born too wild
In case I never get to holler at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin', and reminiscin'
To the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My momma was a Panther loud, single parent but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out
And left the house 'cause my mama say I'm good for nothing, so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live
God forgive me for my sins, let me make it
And I'll never steal again, or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter to my unborn child

[Chorus: Natasha Walker & 2Pac]
A letter to my unborn child
Oh yeah (To my unborn)
To my unborn child
A letter to my unborn child
Oh yeah (To my unborn)
To my unborn child

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
So complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I plead guilty of being anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this, cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot 5 times but I'm still breathin'
Livin' proof there's a God, if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child

[Chorus: Natasha Walker & 2Pac]
A letter to my unborn child
Oh yeah (To my unborn child)
To my unborn child
A letter to my unborn child
Oh yeah (To my unborn child)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Lord, can you hear me? Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or we all just cursed to be street thugs?
'Cause being black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw, what could be worse?
'Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who I'm I kiddin'? I'm a thug 'til I die I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not being there
Just know your daddy was a soldier, me against the world
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord I'm eternal, restin' in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child

[Chorus: Natasha Walker & 2Pac]
A letter to my unborn child
Oh yeah (To my unborn child)
(Please take care of all my kids
To the unborn child)
A letter to my unborn child
Oh yeah (To my unborn child)

[Outro: 2Pac]
This letter goes out to
Any seeds that I might not get to see
'Cause of this lifestyle a nigga live
Just know what; your daddy loves you
Got nothin' but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
So I was out here on a 24 hour, 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you if there's a ghetto from heaven
There's a ghetto heaven, I'll be there waiting
Take care, run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes it's confusin'
The rules of the game is gon' get you through it
All day, every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends come a dime a dozen
Be an individual
Work hard
Study
Get your mind sharp
Trust nobody
Money Over Bitches
Don't let these niggas run you out
Don't let no man put his hands on you
Don't let no woman use you
Don't be a trick
Don't be a player hater
And don't be a wife beater
Go get your money
With all my heart
Your Pops
2Pac
