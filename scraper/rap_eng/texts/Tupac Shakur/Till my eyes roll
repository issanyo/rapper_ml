(Verse 1):
All these niggas do is hang on corners

Eyes hang low, giving out Quarters

On corners, be selling the grass

Ass is grass, life up for grabs

All these bitches do is talk and put down another

So dumb, he convinced you put down the rubber

Police chase your baby dad, “we got a runner”

He gon’ dread that shit there, like a Rasta

How you selling cocaine, but sniffing the yayo

Don’t play with that shit, or you have to lay low

Be having you move like teo and Ayo

Fun to play with not to eat, No
Play doh

Still running these streets, fuck is the pay roll?

Niggas move like Perez, move the Pedro

The money man?, not mafia peso

They clear it fast, clean the place tho

(Hook):
Till’ I past

Till’ my death

Till’ my eyes roll back

Till’ im dead

(Verse 2):
I want this to stick on you

They got children, they strip on you

That’s why parents are strict on you

Toast to living, I’ll sip on too

All these rappers lying and shit

Never was a trappers, lying and shit

Should become actors, lying and shit

They look up to you, buying your shit

Half a mill’, sabotage, Camouflage props

Proof, no biggie, who Got pac?

You was X, now you Stretch, Who got la Rocked

Bad News, Big L, Charizma got shot

And just to name, their gone fast

Somebody killed fresh, but didn’t confess

People who are great, got stabbed in the back

Off my chest, best of the best, never last

(Hook):
Till’ I past

Till’ my death

Till’ my eyes roll back

Till’ im dead
