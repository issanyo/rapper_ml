[Intro]
It's 2012...
Kasinova Tha Don, 2Face Mix-tape
Shit, where do we go from here?
I don't know...
Shit be kinda crazy lately though...
Yeah

[Verse 1]
2006: My brother hit the penitentiary
I watch my mama shed a tear every year and it's killin' me
I want the pain to go away and I pray it will
I seen so many murders, I wish it wasn't real
And all the holes in my heart, may The Lord heal
We understood the side of violence, we packin' steel
The cops will never show no justice, they want us dead
I seen the law put two bullets in my homie's head
Who can we call when we all alone?
I wanted to call on God but at times it's like nobody's home
I hit the sack of marijuana to let my mind be
In the place where I can go so I can find peace
Increase the dose nobody knows all the pain i'm in
I try to run away from hell but it comes again
Flashbacks of being trapped in a jail cell
I wish I didn't make the crack sell, well

[Hook]
So where do we go?
And where do we go?
And where do we go from here?
(Where do we go now?)
So where do we go?
So where do we go?
And where do we go from here?
I pour out liquor for my brothers who
No longer here. And every time I close
My eyes I got to drop a tear
So where do we go? (Heyyyy)
And where do we go?
And where do we go from here?

[Verse 2]
Prepare for battle as I dream for a better day
Ain't nobody tell me shit, I had to find my way
My mama told me never worry baby hold on
Labled a menace so a brother couldn't carry on
Lead my to paradise, my soul steady crying 'Lord'
Better my life with all this agony i'm paranoid
Fighting these demons as they scream out my name daily
I was cursed ever since I left my mama's belly
I'm in the telly with my mind focused packing dope
Ain't nobody want to help me so i'm losing hope
Another toke will seem to smoke another trapped soul
I start to choke so now I float through this black hole
How can we witness all the victims who been cheating life
I wish somebody could have mold them and told 'em twice
God told me: This lifestyle is temporary
That's why I never shed a tear at the cemetery, but

[Hook]
So where do we go?
And where do we go?
And where do we go from here?
(Where do we go now?)
So where do we go?
So where do we go?
And where do we go from here?
I pour out liquor for my brothers who
No longer here. And every time I close
My eyes I got to drop a tear
So where do we go? (Heyyyy)
And where do we go?
And where do we go from here?

[Verse 3]
Can we walk the streets proudly
While our skins exposed?
Should have known the definition of a friend or foe
This daily life that we living, nothing's promised but death
Nightmares became real, had me jumping with sweats
I had to dance with the devil while the moon is pale
Viggie you can't grow in Heaven so you gloom in Hell
A crack sale from a black male leads to jail
A roll dog had the cheese but had the greed to tell
Enemies bleed as the week proceeds, two in hell
Inside my own dirty system not a two man sale
Assassinate me if you will, I'm on the verge of being free
With this black shit ain't no sympathy (Not at all)
Brothers die mysterious, for the life they lead
I'm never curious cause I'm here now when they wouldn't breathe
So I floss with a passion, I'm steady asking
Hoping my blessings is everlasting. So can we say:

[Hook]
So where do we go?
And where do we go?
And where do we go from here?
(Where do we go now?)
So where do we go?
So where do we go?
And where do we go from here?
I pour out liquor for my brothers who
No longer here. And every time I close
My eyes I got to drop a tear
So where do we go? (Heyyyy)
And where do we go?
And where do we go from here?
