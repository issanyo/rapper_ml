[Intro]
Rest in peace
Yeah

[Verse]

It's so sad that you passed away
I wanted to meet you at the bay
But that was too late
So i can't see you no more alive
I can't belive people say that you suck
Well you're incredible great
Well, you're still alive
You're still alive in our hearts
Bring a flower to your grave
Hope you see it from heaven
A drive by happened, whoever did that, they did revenge
Damn
I see that half of the Outlawz is dead
Rest in peace pac, rest in peace kadafi, rest in peace huessain, rest in peace prince ital joe and all of them that died
We still have nouble, edit and storm
But they can't do anything without you nigga

[Hook]

Rest in peace 2Pac, i feel sorry for your death
Rest in peace your gang members
Rest in peace man, whoever shot you
Don't even wanna say

[Outro]

Rest in peace pac
