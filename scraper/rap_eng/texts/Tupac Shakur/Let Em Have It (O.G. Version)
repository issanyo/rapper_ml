[Intro: 2Pac]
Te quiero
Te quiero cojer, te quiero cojer
I'll let your ass have it, te quiero cojer
Te quiero cojer, for real?
Te quiero cojer

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now you've been actin' like you want it for a long time
All up in a nigga face, givin' me them strong vibes
Look in my eyes and you'll find peace
A Gemini, so you really blow my mind freak, come on
I got my clothes off, hard as a nigga in jail
Skinny niggas throw the dick well
Everybody get their condoms, brother cause it's time to fuck
Hurry up and put it on nigga, time is up
What's next? Got my mind on some group sex
Where you goin', baby? I ain't even through yet
Do it like a true vet, love it how I threw it to ya
In and out make it good to ya, remember me?
I love fuckin' slow with the lights low
Black, Puerto Rican, even White hoes; bellisimo
Que Linda, dame beso, come to Papi
Fuck until the shit is sloppy, if you really want it

[Pre-Hook: Val Young & 2Pac]
If you can do what I do
(Let your ass have it)
Why don’t you come on and give it to me
(You know, if you really want it)
(If you really want it, if you really want it)

[Verse 2: Storm]
Come on let’s take a three day mission
Of sex wishes and body conditioning
(Damn)
I rub you here, you lick me there, we get to tongue kissing
(Yeah)
Picture my body in a silhouette, all yours
(Like that, yeah)
You freaking me, I’m freakin you, inside my sugar walls
(Uh)
I want it all, don’t hold back, come to me
(Don't hold back, come)
Tell me what you want to do with the pussy
(What I want to do, I don't mind)
I got fantasies, you and me deep in the bubbly
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You killin softly, won't you take me
Passion in the makin'
(Damn)
Sexual ratifications
You be my freak, I’ll be your sneaky situation
(Do it, do it, do it)


[Hook: Val Young & 2Pac]
If you can do what I do
Why don’t you come on and give it to me
(Rock, your body body, rock your body body)
(Rock, your body body, rock your body)
If you can do what I do
(Rock, your body body, rock your body)
Why don’t you come on and give it to me
(Rock, your body)
(Rock, your body body, rock your body body)
(Rock, your body body)


[Verse 3: 2Pac]
See, it all started simple, turned into me lickin' the nipples
Fuckin' you doggie style to this instrumental
Hands up, all up inside ya, hell I can stand ya
Eyes open I don't plan to bust, just hold on
Baby let me zone in, what do you mean?
Can you scream let it go beotch, how does it feel?
Got a nigga like steel in ya, to keep goin'
Now I'm fuckin' like I'm killin' ya, let's go another round
Baby is you down really, two shots of ecstasy
Lick a nigga down silly, your body next to me
I could touch you inside, and you'll cry
So good when a nigga leave, you'll die
My mama told me baby be a man put it on her
Hittin' bitches like, switches comin' around the corner
I want her let me get my ride on
It's yo' dick baby but it's my song
Now if you really want it

[Outro: Val Young & 2Pac]
