I think of u in my arms
And what it would be like 2 Make Love
I think of u raising my SEED
And what they'd be made of
I think of how alone I was
Before u came 2 be
I think of the joy I felt
when u said u thought of me
I'm proud to be the heart u
choose 2 make a friend
Hours pass by and Cupid cries
until we meet again
