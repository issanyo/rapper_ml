Today I wake & feel even lonelier
But I c positive potential
My heart shook much like the Quake
Then the pain was gone
The arctic breeze formed the fortress
Barricading my fragile Heart from PAIN

It is not that I don't love u
and it was because I did love u
that I must move on
as long as I breathe
I will remember
"WE AS 2"
