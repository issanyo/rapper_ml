[Intro: Pac]
Hahaha, Jon B
Bring it on now
Let 'em feel where you comming from
Let 'em feel where you comming from
Only the ladies, only the ladies


[Chorus: Jon B & 2pac]
Girl it's alright babe
Are you still down for me now?
Cause it's there in your eyes yea
Are you still down for me?
I can see that you want me
Are you still down for me now?
By the way that you smile
Yea are you still down for me?

[Verse 1: Jon B]
Left once again at home, another night your home
Ain't no fun if in love not at home alone
How's it feel to be useless, all night, tell me
Can you recall how close we use to be there
Can't use to remember those feeling again
Seem like every time I see you there's a tear in your eye
What you crying for? Time to make a decision or go dying inside

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell em all, call me fool but I'm stuck
It's a love thang, plus I'm overheating from the rush
Our tongues touch, kiss and feel the fireworks, watch the sky
I'll make you smile but you'd rather have what makes you cry
Say goodbye and I'll leave now
With my heart on my sleeve, memories down
What I found is you still care, you had feeling and they still there
Baby girl keep it real - are you still down?

[Chorus: Jon B & 2Pac]
Girl it's alright babe
Come on are you still down?
Cause it's there in your eyes yea, it's in your eyes
I can see it in your eyes
Are you still down?
I can see that you want me
Don'tcha want me don'tcha want me
Are you still down?
By the way that you smile, hahaha yea
Are you still down for me?

[Verse 3: Jon B]
Remember that evening
Yea are you still down?
I know that you were too scared to go all the way, please
But you did it to please me
Crying it was raining when you gave it to me
The more I see the more I feel inside
And I know one thing I'll make it back to where you can fly
Watch the time go
Don't cry tomorrow is a better day
What cha cryin for? Let me dry your eyes
Think you burnin out...

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Only once in a lifetime, touch my soul
Go slow baby boo, don't rush the flow
Got me all weak baby but I'm strong in parts
With more bounce to the ounce with the longest parts
Get me mined like fine wine measured in time
Maybe the other brothers loved you but the pleasure was mine
Mama taught me how to love a woman properly sprung
We committed so I hit it and it's properly done

[Chorus: Jon B & 2Pac]
Girl it's alright babe
Come on, come on, are you still down?
Cause it's there in your eyes
It's in your eyes I can see it in your eyes
Are you still down?
I can see that you want me
Don'tcha want me don'tcha want me
Are you still down?
By the way that you smile, hahaha yea
Are you still down for me?
Girl it's alright babe
Come on, are you still down for me now?
Cause it's there in your eyes
It's in your eyes I can see it in your eyes
Are you still down?
I can see that you want me
She want you Jon she want you
Are you still down?
By the way that you smile
She got smile look...

[Bridge: 2Pac]
Baby are you still down
Are you down for me?
Baby are you still down
Still down for me!
(Repeat till end)
