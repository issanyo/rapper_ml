[Intro: Napoleon]
Lifeâ€¦ What the fuck is life for niggas like us?
Been wakin' up to another mothafuckin' day
I'm the type of soldier
A nigga that seen everything in my mothafuckin' eyes
I seen my parents get killed to my mothafuckin' eyes
I seen my brother kill himself in my eyes
I seen 'Pac, Yak die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean?

[Verse 1: Napoleon]
Oh God, forgive me, somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents, but they was never there for me
Believe in everythin' they feed me, I'm seein' demons
I wake up screamin', who believe me or was I dreamin'?
5 fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I wanna see what's after this
I'm livin' blind, writin' rhymes 'til they capture this
And if we die, let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes, hate to see a young thug cry
They seein' us inside a casket, that's how they see us
Oh God, forgive us ghetto bastards, we human beings
They leavin' us inside this hell hole
Just waitin' to fail, so then they tell us that's what jail for
Adolescent young teens turned violent
It's floatin', in a world turned silent
'Cause u could be touched

[Hook: 2Pac][X2]
Young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child-like
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause u can be touched
Young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child-like
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause u can be touched

[Verse 2: E.D.I]
I live life high speed, movin' a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny, makin' decisions carelessly
Yeah, it's me, yo' nigga man-child
Bomb first, stand proud, ain't lookin' for hand-outs
(Shit!)
Twenty-five years up in this bitch
(Shit!)
And I'll be damned if I ain't leavin' rich
And leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug shit
You can be touched
I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, thirty dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get more, so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go, I pray the Lord hold me

[Verse 3: Kastro]
I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas that ever breathed
And I was big, when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My nigga Lonnie just got hit with ten
Ten years for trustin' a friend
They left him stuck in the pen
I love him, we all here just to die here
Plus, nobody cares what got here
Touched by angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched by angel and kissed by the Lord
Y'all praise the thug ways, so forever it's on, baby

[Hook: 2Pac][X2]


[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Why grieve this life, planted by the fiends and pipes?
Green lights, so I'm seein', seein' everything twice
Pretty much of nothin' nice, we suckin' it up
Even when we get a job, we fuckin' it up
Like it can't happen to us, I could never be a bum (Yeah)
Yeah, right, you wound up one
God forbid I'm touched, Y'all keep livin' it up
Look and learn, next it could be your turn, word

[Verse 5: Kadafi]
Yes, this a felony's hobby that got me here, thinkin' robbery
Day to day all year long, Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supportin' me
So in these streets of hockey, I play the goalie
Secrets of war licks, and score shit
Share between clients & homies
Remember what Pacino told me
Before he passed, watch them, clowns
With them, crocodile smiles
'Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thorn, & it's survival of the strong
Livin' outside the laws of this crooked world I was born
Touched

[Hook: 2Pac]
My young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child-like
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause u can be touched
