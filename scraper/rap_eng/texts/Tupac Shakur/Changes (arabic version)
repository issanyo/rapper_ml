[Wald TriG]
اليامات زي بعضاها بصح تعدي
لي والا و همو كلنا perdue
فالكارطي تشوف لولاد مديقوتية
الزهر كيما ماجاش راح يجيب الكمية
الدنيا عمياا ماعطاتناش قسم
لقسم عالخالق مش لي ذبحك بسم
أمشي صافي و احكم في المولى
دير كيفي اتبعهم تتكولا
عديك هز السلاح  combat لحياة
وين يديوك تتلاح cavier ماتكونش
الملح صعيب بزاف لي خانو
تحطني في مكانو meme les principles صحاح
Helio -X2-
تحطني في مكانو meme les principles صحاح

[Bridge w/ changing ad libs]
Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
[Repeat]

I see no changes. All I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races we under
I wonder what it takes to make this one better place...
Let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact...
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way, but they stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today" But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids. "I gotta get paid,"
Well hey, well that's the way it is

[Bridge]
[Talking:]
We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive
[Bridge 'til fade:]
Some things will never change
