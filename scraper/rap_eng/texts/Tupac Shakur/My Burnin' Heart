[Verse 1]
I lay awake tonight, because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me, I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feelin gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Huh - reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter, cause I want you that much
The situation is a no-win, cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, of fallin for his girlfriend
I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
Its like a trap that I'm sinkin into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin cause I'm thinkin of you
Then we make eye contact, and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel posessed by you
I have these thoughts at night, of undressin you
Its kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't, so he keeps on trustin me
Leaves me alone wit you, while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me, with this temptation?
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin - you're sayin to come over
What do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
Its gettin rougher cause I suffer from a burnin heart..
My burnin heart..

[Verse 2]
Girl, you are my one and only
You are my angel, and now ya wanna leave me lonely
What did I do? Baby did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken, and now ya make me sad
I remember, when this love affair first started
We was so in love, and now we are departed
Girl, I'll buy ya anything ya heart desires
I have to let ya know, baby you're my fire
Warm and wet, each kiss is prolonged
It's your sweet caress that makes Rock T strong
Just bein with you, and seein the two of us
Walkin along the beach, cause girl you are my peach
So sweet and tender, my love I surrender
No need to pretend, that you'll want it to end
I'll never let you go, you're forever my girl
Ya know why? Cause girl, you are my world
My burnin' heart..

[Verse 3]
Totally tounge tied, every three seconds I keep watchin you
He's my best friend, but I can't help clockin you
How could this be? How could we both love you
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
I could forget about you, pretend that we never met
But when I'm here without you, I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks that reinforce the bond that's already there
So many times I find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
Play the role like you don't matter, he swears that we hate each other
But in reality we can't wait to taste each other
You're my addiction casue I fiend for your desperately
I stand here fantasizin, because you're next to me
What can I do, with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal, so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times, I know where every curve is
I think you reads my mind, and so I'm feelin nervous
I wana tell you how I feel, but that wouldn't help
It would only cause problems so I keep to myself
Even though, it drives me crazy, to see you sittin with him
A tear rolls down my cheek, because I see you kiss him
I know the words you're sayin before they can be said
Hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
Wouldn't hurt the brother, for anything in this world
But damn I fell in love with his girl - my burnin heart, heart, heart..

[Verse 4]
My heart is burnin, ya know it's yearin, for ya sweet caress
I lay in ecstacy, as you kiss and rub my chest
You know ya love me, why must you deny yourself
What I can offer you, yet you want somebody else?
It's not that - well then girl, what could it be?
I hope I'm good for you, cause baby you're so good for me
Many nights I cried and tried to make this work
Then act the fool and cool and cruel like the church
Well I'm sorry baby, I have to let you know
You are my life my strength I refuse to let you go
You are so beautiful, baby you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream of that you'll become my wife
Day in and day out, it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
I love you cause honey, you're like a work of art
You got me on fire - my burnin heart..

[Verse 5]
I lay awake tonight, because I wanna be with you

Each time I see ya, the feelin gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
