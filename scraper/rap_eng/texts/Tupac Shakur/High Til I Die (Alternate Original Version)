[2Pac talking]
(Coughing)
Oh shit
(Coughing)
Damn
Ay, this for you punk motherfucker's in Marin

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Game true, ain't got time for fools
Money on my mind so my nine rules
Time to, make weight, niggas gettin' crazy paid
And hatin' bitches for the games they play
So nigga, pull quick
But better be quicker than the next, motherfucker on the, trigger
Cause I'm static
Startin' to be a fuckin' habbit gotta keep my automatic or get my ass kicked
When I'm in traffic, it's kinda rough and, I drive a bucket
Live the Thug Life nigga screaming, fuck It
Love to throw my middle finger to the Police
No bucks, no justice, no peace
Smokin' blunts till I pass out (Coughing)
Yeah nigga, gettin' assed out
Rollin' in my nigga's glass house
Drivin' fast, talkin' to bitches whippin' cash out {fade out}
I'm with my niggas, so fuck the suckers, buck the busters
Smokin' Chronic motherfucker's causin' ruckus
It's the last of the Dank, pull over
Can't hear a damn thing sober
High till I die

[Verse 2:Don Jagwarr]
Booyah if you [?] knock you out and scream man murder
High till I die yes a nigga must live it up
If ya eyes on indo then ya out for just burn it up
Out for just burn it up
Know me out for just burn it up
[?] out for scream thug life
If ya see a pussy [?] out for scream thug life
Choke the pussy before [?]

[Verse 3: Rated R]
I stay high whilst that Chronic shifts
24/7 all I hear then the Indo splits
Choke in my Karl Kani, I think about death too much that's why I smoke my brains out
So I can relax and kick back
Come off on a dope track with a rhyme to sack
I got my Death for the punk niggas want peace
Fuck peace nigga, cause I'm playin' for keeps
I got mercy, I squabble for a knot
[?] on a blood spot
Let me stop and put some petrol in my tank
Mack serve up the Dank I'm finna hold up this place
Put my Ski mask on
Jump out like a motherfucker cocked, locked, chrome
I'm thinkin' about that mean ass spree
Get in my room and make my getaway clean
Know what I mean its about [?]
Smokin' my Chronic sack fuck you bitches

[Bridge: Don Jagwarr]
[?]a dick for all the sweet black pussy
[?] dick for all the sweet black pussy
Indo, burn it, burn it
Indo, burn it, burn it
Who got the Indo, burn it, burn it
Who got the Indo, if ya out burn it, burn it

[Verse 3: Macadoshis]
I graduated from the school of Hard Knocks
At the age of Seventeen I went to camp for slangin' rocks
A young nigga with nothin' to live for
All I ever wanted was a squeeze and a 6-4
But now they got a nigga trapped in the system
I pop a Cop, when he drop, I piss on him
I smoke blunts like it's a religion
It's 187, on a motherfuckin' stool pigeon
Might swoop in my coupe with the flat boots
Don't have to make me to shoot when I'm looting
Gotta wait two years cause I'm struggling
Fuck strugglin' I'd rather stay buzzing
I live the Thug Life nigga till I die
And if I do dope [?], just [?] the blunt and get high
Cause a nigga like me stays down till death
Kicked up dust, to smoke blunts till my last breathe

[Bridge 2: Don Jagwarr]
Roll 'em up, roll 'em up and yes we after smoke 'em
Roll 'em up, roll 'em up and yes we after smoke 'em
Roll 'em up, roll 'em up and yes we after smoke 'em
Roll 'em up, roll 'em up and yes we after smoke 'em

[Chorus: 2Pac & Souljah]
High till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till my casket drop
High till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till my casket drop
I'm high till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till my casket drop
High till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till my casket drop
High till I die
Loc'ed till they smoke me, the shit don't stop till the casket drop
High till I die
