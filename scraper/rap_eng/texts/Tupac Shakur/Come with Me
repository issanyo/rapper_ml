[2Pac - INTRO]
Kasinova...
Kasinova...
(What?)
Where the fuck you at?
Do I know you? I see you now
It's I, Lucifer, Lord of the Dark Side
Let me seduce you to my Legions of Vengeance
(No!)
Who will probably most soldiers seek refuge, and become weak and faithless
Let my words surge you with under-souls
And you shall find peace
(Miss me alive)
And eternal...
I can give you what no God has offered
Fame, money, hustle, bitches
Knowing above...
So would you join?
(HAIL MARY!)

[Hook]
Come With Me
Let me take you where you need to be
Money, power and loyalty
And take your time and you will see
(HAIL MARY!)
Come With Me
Let me take you where you need to be
Money, power and loyalty
And take your time and you will see

[Verse 1]
Another nigga in the game with corrupted thoughts
I'm being punished for the pain that I was taught
An adolescent calling for Black Jesus with black burns
And grabbing his dick and smacking bitches like he out
I turn 'em
Well known in the projects
He laid a couple of niggas down just for fucking up his proccess
And Aggravated Assault became his first charge
And Ambitionz Az A Ridah got me going hard
Forever scarred was his mind-state
Collecting bodies with the shotty still colliding with the crime rate
Pushing packs for main, local drug dealers
Taught him how to stack and pull triggers with nine miller'
Needers equipped with heaters making niggas firm belivers
And getting deep and got these niggas running out they sneakers
I hit the reefer as I drop to knees to pray to Easter
And if you see me with the Reaper imma come and greet ya (HAIL MARY!)

[Hook]
Come With Me
Let me take you where you need to be
Money, power and loyalty
And take your time and you will see
(HAIL MARY!)
Come With Me
Let me take you where you need to be
Money, power and loyalty
And take your time and you will see

[VERSE 2]
My adversaries think they got me worried
My fully automatic blastin' will leave the bitches buried
Full of fury still releasing military rage
It's like a dragon being trapped in a glass cage
Silent cries to prophets, wise words being spoken
And everybody think they feeling but nobody's knowin'
And death before dishonor, and it was me you honor
They had to put me away because I fucked with karma
Analyze the situation because it's all real
I'd rather be here than dead with my cats peeled
My crooked schemes costing wicked dreams
I'm getting paranoid, puffing on my nicotine
What does it mean? Will I die at an early age?
Or will I rise up fast and start to upgrage?
I'm getting paid, leading niggas to the dirt to see
And if you can't get it right then it's you and me
(Now Hail Mary)

[Hook]
Come With Me
Let me take you where you need to be
Money, power and loyalty
And take your time and you will see
(HAIL MARY!)
Come With Me
Let me take you where you need to be
Money, power and loyalty
And take your time and you will see

Rest In Peace Pac
We all miss you
