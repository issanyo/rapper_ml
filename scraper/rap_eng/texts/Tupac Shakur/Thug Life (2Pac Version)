[2Pac]
Kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill

[Verse 1]
Raised by thugs schooled by killers
I learned mathematics from big time dealers
So how the fuck these love to see a nigga fallin'
Pop the Glock, suckas plottin' on a playa 'cause he's ballin'
Up early in the mornin' four deep
Creepin' in my Jeep, nigga real thugs don't sleep
You'll never kill a real g, feel me
How many cops gotta drop 'fore they kill me
Murder in the muthafuckin' worst way
Turned to a killa on my 21st birthday
Boom, boom, on a crooked cop, drop that
Livin' like a thug 'til these niggas get they block back
Oh shit, deep in motion
'Til we get a grip, my muthafuckas won't quit
Livin' that Thug Life!
Tryin' to make a million of that drug life
I got a Glock named cop killa
So read the papers, another cop caught the vapors
Might spend a little time with a bitch let her know (ho)
I'm married to the jungle, I live the Thug Life

[Chorus]
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
I live the Thug Life
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Thug Life
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Thug Life
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Thug Life
Born in the ghetto as a street thug (How You Livin'?), labeled as a cop killa
Thug Life
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Thug Life
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa

[Verse 2]
I [?] hit chronic, run with a wild
Bunch thinkin' of dead niggas that I knew that died young
Is there a heaven for a nigga up to no good
Or is it just another fuckin' hood?
I'm havin' talks with my nigga little g from down the street
And the nigga been dead for three weeks
I'm goin' crazy, damn is a nigga loc'd
Finger on the trigger, tryin' not to get smoked
Rollin' through the hood with my flosses
Niggas keep my finger on the trigger 'cause I'm hopeless
What's wrong with a muthafucker comin' up
Makin' mo' bucks that's why them hoes fuck
Had enough of these punks, thug for life
Can't stand bitches now fuck a wife
I told you once you can't trust her
Don't go out like a busta, fuck her
Money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
Hoes get horny and muthafuckers die
Never turn your back on the game
I'll be lettin' off shots 'til the shit change
I live the Thug Life!

[Chorus]
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
Born in the ghetto as a street thug, labeled as a cop killa
