[Verse 1: MC New York]
Ayo, don't wanna diss you but your girls a freak
All in my face, every time I speak
And if she's not following me or in my face
Then she's clockin' and jockin' my homeboy Ace
Making you look bad, 'cause your girl is hot
Spending all your money every chance she's got
Gave her all your gold rings off your hand
But she gave it all up to another man
'Cause your girl's a skeezer, I swear she is
Bitch said she was a virgin but she got three kids
First she kissed Ace, then she slobbed me down
Don't wanna diss you, but you got the fastest girl in town
All in my pants, everytime we dance
Try to stop homebody, but she got quick hands
There's no easy way to tell you, but short and sweet
Don't wanna diss you, but your girl's a freak
I saw your girl!

[Hook:]
Sip a hundred, spend a hundred, if you really want it
You can come around asking me
I ain't gotta flip it 'cause I gotta keep it secret
When I pull up, all eyes on me (I saw your girl!)
Sip a hundred, get a hundred, tell me how you feel about
Them carats on my pinky ring
I don't think you've ever seen a hundred stacks
And homie you won't ever touch a hundred rack girl

[Verse 2: MC New York]
I saw your girl, that freak is hot
Wearing clothes that show everything she's got
Making people stare when she goes somewhere
When she walks, people talk, but your girl don't care
I saw your girl, real late one night
Had on a see-through blouse and her pants were tight
Walked in the club, and begin to dance
By 10 had a nigga all in her pants
You say she's devoted, but that's not true
If she's devoted, she's certainly not devoted to you
I know it's your girl, so I say "freeze"
But I'm too late 'cause she's already on her knees
Slip slurp and slop, from bottom to top
Like Maxwell House, good to the last drop
Not tryna hurt you bro, just lettin' you know
That your girl is a goddamn ho
I saw your girl!

[Hook:]
Sip a hundred, spend a hundred, if you really want it
You can come around asking me
I ain't gotta flip it 'cause I gotta keep it secret
When I pull up, all eyes on me (I saw your girl!)
Sip a hundred, get a hundred, tell me how you feel about
Them carats on my pinky ring
I don't think you've ever seen a hundred stacks
And homie you won't ever touch a hundred rack girl

[Verse 3: MC New York]
Now back to the party, with your girl and Billy
You invited him to go to her house, you think you're willy?
And then she leaned over and said "I love you"
'Cause you pretend she's your girlfriend and she loves you too
Then I couldn't find them, they were out of sight
So I thought to myself, "damn this ain't right"
'Cause she's playing on my boy and it was plain to see
If it was my girl, I would want him to tell me
I called him up and told him everything he didn't want to hear
He cursed me out, called me a liar and a punk in my ear
Yo, I hope you learned a lesson, the more that you know
He's getting mad 'cause his girl's a ho!
I saw your girl!

[Hook:]
Sip a hundred, spend a hundred, if you really want it
You can come around asking me
I ain't gotta flip it 'cause I gotta keep it secret
When I pull up, all eyes on me (I saw your girl!)
Sip a hundred, get a hundred, tell me how you feel about
Them carats on my pinky ring
I don't think you've ever seen a hundred stacks
And homie you won't ever touch a hundred rack girl

[Outro: MC New York]
I saw your GIRL!
Yo, I saw your GIRL!
Yo, I saw your girl!
