Rraah
On your block
It don't stop
There ain't no motherfuckin Don but me, Makaveli
With that THUG-LIFE tatted on my motherfuckin' belly

[Verse 1: K. Prince]
They shot my homie down in cold blood
The definition of a thug
Ain't no love if you dream of drus
Hypnotized by this thug living
My decisions got me feeling torn
It's like I'm born in my own prison
Finesse a blunt as I focus on another spliff
I hit the reefer as I start to think and reminisce
Money's the mission so my competitions sure to die
And if these cowards want me dead I can picture why
Send me to heaven, let me kick it with my dead homies
So I can tell him how he died when he bled on me
I'll send regards to his family and friends
I couldn't drown in my misery, I'm flossing my Benz
I got them running to the drawing board
Another 9 hits song
You can't afford
I got them paranoid shaking in there sneakers while they plotting on my riches
Trying to do me in with some dirty game bitches

It don't stop
There ain't no motherfuckin Don but me, Makaveli
With that THUG-LIFE tatted on my motherfuckin' belly

[Verse 2:]
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggas die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin' drunk to keep from goin' under
Gettin' lost in the madness, blunted gettin' tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin', "Lord come and get me"
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin' my clip, I'm watchin' every bullet spit when I kick 'em
Niggas die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much pain in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
