[Intro]
Thug life is the only thing up in 90s
Thug life I mean like a little bit then thug life like a lot
These is my thug life niggas and we finna do this like this
While I roll the blunt y'all keep talking you know what I'm sayin'
(Thug Life)
What else
(Thug life do craziest, Thug Life niggas do the craziest)
If they ask you, you tell 'em, these my niggas
That's how we ruling the shit run and smoke a blunt, punking punk and punking chumps that's how doing that shit
Fuckin' niggas up, fuckin' niggas real bad
Two times they quick in the night even drinking or smoking weed all the time
We high 'til I die you know what I'm sayin', we ain't stoppin'
Can't nobody fuck with us either
