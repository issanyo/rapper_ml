[Hook: 2Pac]
Am I wrong, cause I wanna get it on, till I die
Am I wrong, cause I wanna get it on, till I die
Get it on, till I die, get it on, till I die
Y’all, y’all remember me
Y’all, y’all remember me

[Bridge: James Brown]
Sold me out, taking change
Told me your name, we had, all the lanes
Held me down

[Break: James Remar (Christoph Waltz)]
Last chance fancy pants
(Oh, very well)

[Bridge 2: James Brown]
Gotta get ready, want a big payback
The payback!
Hey, hey

[Hook: 2pac (Jamie Foxx)] x2
Am I wrong, cause I wanna get it on, till I die
Am I wrong, cause I wanna get it on, till I die
Get it on, till I die, get it on, till I die
Y’all, y’all remember me
(I like the the way you die boy)

[Verse: 2Pac]
Only wish to breed
I explode into a million seeds
Ya’ll remember me
Legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face ‘em
Take them to places, stake they face then erase ‘em and brake ‘em
Murder motherfucker’s at a rate and then quicken the pace
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong cause I wanna get it on till I die
Now even if you blind you still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you go through
Outlaws busting busting
We untouchable

[Hook]

[Outro: 2Pac]
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I’m coming, hahaha
