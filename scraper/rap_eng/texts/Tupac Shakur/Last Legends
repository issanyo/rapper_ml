The Game:
It's 3, The hard way
Black Lambo, No passengers
Black Ski mask, Chain Saw Massacre
Kill fast with the Ak-four 7
(Blacka) Yellow Tape the intersection
Loaded clips, Lock 'em in
Got a black four five
Call it Pac's revenge
I'm a mutha fuckin animal
Lil Jon be canibal
Every nigga in Atlanta Know
I'm psycho insane about my cash, they should re-open alcatraz
And sentance with a life without rehabillitaion
Fuck Governor Schwarzenegger
It's my statment
Dear Mr. President Barack Obama, Righ after you catch Osama, Tell Mr. Waso
Please let oprah know that I won't ever stop sayin bitch and hoe

Chorus:
I’m from the westside I done paid my dues, nwa is back this is front page news. I'm Makaveli the Don is what they tell me, I'm armed I put my niggas up on it Now we Amerikaz Most Wanted

I’m from the westside I done paid my dues, nwa is back this is front page news. I'm Makaveli the Don is what they tell me, I'm armed I put my niggas up on it Now we Amerikaz Most Wanted

2pac:
Sick, Thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin money but you stuck on these fake bitches
I stay blunted, And never fronted and I doubt if I do
Cause if I do, Then I get beat up by my fuckin crew
A real nigga, Since you figure that you ready to box
You catchin knots from my nigga Freddie Fox
And I, You really don't want none from Pac
Cause I'll be strapped wit a Glock
And throw thangs like I'm born to box
I'll hit this motherfuckin gin then I'll be all in
Hell yeah, Young niggas straight ballin
And everybody wants to see if I'm a g weighin' 165

Chorus:
I’m from the westside I done paid my dues, nwa is back this is front page news. I'm Makaveli the Don is what they tell me, I'm armed I put my niggas up on it Now we Amerikaz Most Wanted

I’m from the westside I done paid my dues, nwa is back this is front page news. I'm Makaveli the Don is what they tell me, I'm armed I put my niggas up on it Now we Amerikaz Most Wanted
