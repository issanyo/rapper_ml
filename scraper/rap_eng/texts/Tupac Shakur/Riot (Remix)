[Intro}
Luke White on the beat


[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Have you ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same thing that we claim
Such is bashful, but nigga like a task force
Mobbin’ on he streets and robbin' stores in ski mask, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it’s a game of cat and mouse you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin fuck it and grab a pump
Then  kill a women with many children make you a chump
Look at stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say "Fuck black prejudice!"
"Let's murder different races, grow hatred, form irrelevant!"
Views and etcetra, knives thrown
Damage 'em lives blown,oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin’ ignorance
Murder opps, killin’ shit, I enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in the blood of the officers, different corpses, offin' ’em
Auction 'em, don't bark at 'em
Murder ’em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say "fuck it" and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life we livin'
Go ahead and go grab the extension
Grab another: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to the chosen ones that will rid of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own murder black-

[Verse 2: The Notorious BIG]
I was only a thirteen, smokin' blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream at my lifetime dream
I mean i want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school i didn't show up, i fuck my flowed up
Mom said that i should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, i could not see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money is necessary
Until I got uncarcerated, kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great seal gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail
All the money i stacked was the money for bail

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
God bless the dead and the buried, nigga don't worry
If you see God first, tell him shit got worse
It ain't mad, i'm just representin' for the crew
I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went quick as it came
My role models gone or locked in a pen
Straight hustlers caught up in a whirlwind
The other day, I thought i saw my homeboy Biggie
Sayin "shit don't stop"  nigga, no pity
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot  scandalous schemes
In the gutter you learn how to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read, "I was the last of the G's"
Kick the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead

[Outro: 2Pac]
God bless the dead
