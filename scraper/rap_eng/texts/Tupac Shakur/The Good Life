[Intro] :
(2Pac Shakur Skit On Poverty & The World)

Chorus :

This That Make It Out The Hood

This That I Wish A Nigga Could

This The Good Life x4

My Verse :

All These Niggas With This Struggle Rap
& I Ain't Even Struggling

The Ones That's Humbling
I'm Y'all Interception So Y'all Fumbling

I Couldn't Even Spell Calvin Klein Right When I Was 10
And Now It's On My Chest

Don't Let That Go Over Y'all Heads

There's No Discussing Shit

With Who You Fucking With

I'm Cool With Everybody

But Only My Brothers Know My Government

Speaking Of The Government , Nah Let's Not Get Into That

They Gone Make You Turn Illuminate But It’s Really Rap

Challenge Your Challenges Yeah These Are Really Facts

Hard Work Beats Talent When It Fails To Work Hard And That's Really Sad

I'm Too E’ll , Everybody In My City Left

I Am Legend , Im The Only Real In My City Left

(Tsss) That Shit Was Made Out

House Party 3 When Kid N Play Got Play'd Out

34 With This Celtics Ima Let The Tray Out

Ima Draw It On The Board
& I Ain't Talking About Lay Outs

Pray Outs !

Chorus :

This That Make It Out The Hood

This That I Wish A Nigga Could

This The Good Life x4

Verse 2 :

I'm Back In My City

I'm Jacking My City

My Ballas They Need Me , Yeah They Jacking It With Me

I Told Niggas I'll Be Back In A Jiffy

And I Ain't A Butler But I'm Packing A Jimmy

I Left NYC , It Was The Hardest Shit To Do

I Keep Telling MySelf Was It The Smartest Thing To Do

Left That Bad Energy
So Florida Was The Farthest Place I Knew

I Keep A 13 With Me , I Know Thats A Harden From The View

Everything I'm Saying Is The True &
Its Coming From A Heavy Heart

I Got Doubted While I Was A Kid
This Shit Was A Heavy Start

Ant Left , I Left , Then Musa Left Too

I Told Musa I Love Em
Cause I Ain't Know What The Fuck To Do

I Was At The Top Of My Game , Top Of My Fame
I Used To Be Hopping The Train

Now I'm On Top Of The Stage , She Topping The Gang
& Now Im On Top With My Gang

(Gang Glttt)

Chorus :
We
