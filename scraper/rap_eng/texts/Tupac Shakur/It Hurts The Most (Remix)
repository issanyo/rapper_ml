[Verse 1: Stretch]
Woke up one morning and I'm feeling good
Misunderstood, I'm fucking kingpin in my neighborhood
I'm getting money with my niggas
The young guns, not the ones pull their fucking triggas
It figures, the phone rang, hamie brang some bad news
Tellin' from the tone of his voice my nigga had the blues
Saying such and such caught much, ya buckshot

And his body was discovered by the cops
The phone dropped, my brain locked in shock
Started smoking mad weed but the pain wouldn't stop
My nigga, they took my nigga, nah fuck that
We going on a hunt and when I find him I'm a buck that
Fool 'til he drool and he croak
I'm runnin' on his block nigga watch the Glock smoke
Provoke the hit shit I want my vengeance
Then I skid off and get away with my intelligence
And then back around the way it's so cold for you
Yeah, gunshots to my fallen crew

[Hook]
When your nigga dies it hurts the most
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost

Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies it hurts the most
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies it hurts the most
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Revenge is sweet
On the streets, understand me
Gotta retaliate get it straight, locate the nigga's family
And I'm rollin' in my jeep top speed, ready to pull the trigger
On any bitch ass nigga, who got weed
They killed my homie and I'm restless
Gotta get em back
A nigga with a MAC and a death wish
Tears in my eyes, don't cry
Look up in the sky, wonder why
Do everybody gotta die
Another soulja in a casket
Can't eat, can't sleep, till I, bury them bastards
His family is fallin' into pieces, his momma don't understand the madness
I can't explain the drama
And it hurts the most, when its someone close
I smoke weed, cause I'm losin' hope
And any dope can see, the ghettos fulla' drug dealers
But ain't nobody born a killa'
But it hurts the most

[Hook]
When your nigga dies it hurts the most
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost

[Verse 3: Mopreme]
One man, drowning in the quick sand
Put my nigga down with my full proof plan
On the other avenues that we tried was blocked
So its time to put in work with the 10 milly plot
And in no time flat, had the fucking money sack
I'm a guard it all a hundred g's in my arms
All thanks to my nigga
Who took the most risk, even though I was a little bigger
I thought it would be alright
Just bust another right and get ghost down a [?]
But a fucking pig cut him off
My nigga won't soft, he let his 9 off
And that will be the only way I'll take it
Filled him full of led and I'm raising his babies
Now the money don't come close
Cause when a friend dies it hurts the most, we living thug life

[Hook]
When your nigga dies it hurts the most
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost

[Verse 4: E-Moneybags]
It started from, word to jerry, foes was buried
Started cruiteens? adolescence commissaries
Campless? militants early age, you ain't getting shit
All the thoughts of sleeping with, can't? we would have been living this
Bodies in the river-split, drug kingpins, brothers finger split, apples?? man called him Richie Rich
Them rollers in Brooklyn was, the stories of me
No intent, remind of 50 cent
From for cream? my niggas taught me
A thug way of life, I was from sumberland? the boys caught me
The family came together, lawyer fees was costly
That's I'm the general of the click, known as the boss E
I leave a thought, manifest the reality
In the middle of the beef, expect of the casualty

[Hook]
When your nigga dies it hurts the most
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost

[Verse 5: Majesty]
My niggas gone and they still can't touch this shit
Sneaking from the grand stand? with the ruckless shit
Got the manuscript to live
Stay survivors from the flesh of the spirit world always stay the loudess'
Spittin' out the tightess, so? contraficial arthritis, mayn? ain't no problem we can't solve
Fuck a harder semen
Immortal being
It's not a lie cus all ya'll seeing
Thug funkateer, thug life pioneers
Players of the year, we be players of the years
Shifting gears in the drop jag wiping off the tears
Want my niggas in the flesh here
Fuck the chanelling, whisper we all rushing through
Wrecking shit that gremelin'?
Like old times, back to back rocking hard rhymes
Hit the tunnel watch chickers? rocker by me shine
It still goes on, but it'll never be the same niggas
Stretch, Big Yak, Pac my cup main niggas
