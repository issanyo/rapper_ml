[Intro:]
Damn
Hey, close yo' muthafuckin' mouth...
Shut yo' muthafuckin' mouth!
This is how we going to to this in 94'
Here we go
Time to size these niggas up and cut they ass short, yow know?
Mothafuckers got me going for it
Fuck these niggas
DING!

[Verse 1:]
Momma ain't raised no punks
Playa-hate niggas, pay attention, this is what they want
Since you all up in a nigga mix
Then maybe you can hang with the street game, don't be a bitch
Keep your head up, baby, and I meant that
Now you trying to toss me in the mix, and bitch, I resent that
These hoes ain't shit
Plottin' on a nigga cuz' he rich
Then wonda why they call u bitch
And if you offended, you's a lyin' ass trick and that was intended
I'm coming back with a passion
And screaming 'Thug Life,' bitch
When my niggas get the blastin
I'm puttin' hoes on tape, and not cuz' I wanna, but I gotta
Cuz' tramps love to scream "rape!"
I'm rushing bitches to the hotel
And I'm blindfolding hoes I don't know well
Huh, guess it's hard on a nigga in 94'
If you can find a hoe, nigga, peep game

[Verse 2:]
Tell me what you need when you see me
Ducking these tramps cuz' they sleazy
Bitch, take it easy
I told you last year it's a test
I know you can't see my tattoos through my bullerproof vest
So you roll, baby, hold up
And why you touchin' on a nigga
If i touched you back, you'd probably go nuts
You see, you hoes got it all wrong
Shouldn't listen to them niggas that be bangin' on them slow songs
That's where you go wrong
I ain't never been a trick
Fake bitch, keep yo' clothes on
With you're mouth closed, and you're leg shut
If I was broke, you'd probably wouldn't said much
But i'm paid, so you all in a nigga face
You wanna move in, fuck, get a bigger place
Please, I ain't goning out like these, trick ass niggas that be fuckin' off G's
You suckas need you're game plan changed
And peep game...
