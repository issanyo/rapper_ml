[Verse 1: Stretch]
Woke up one morning and I'm feeling good
It's understood, I'm fucking kingpin in my neighborhood
I'm getting money with my niggas
The young guns, not the ones pull they fucking triggas
It figures, the phone rang, homie brang some bad news
Tellin' from the tone of his voice my nigga had the blues
Saying such and such, caught much ya buckshots
And his body was discovered by the cops
The phone dropped, my brain locked in shock
Started smoking mad weed but the pain wouldn't stop
My nigga, they took my nigga, nah, fuck that
We going on a hunt and when I find him I'ma buck that
Fool 'til he drool and he croak
I'm runnin' on his block nigga watch the Glock smoke
Provoke the hit shit I want my vengeance
Then I skid off and get away with my intelligence
And then back around the way it's so cold for you
Yeah (Uh), gunshots to my fallen crew

[Hook: Stretch & 2Pac]
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Revenge is sweet
On the street, understand me
Gotta retaliate, get it straight, locate the nigga's family
And I'm rollin' in my Jeep, top-speed, ready to pull the trigger
On any bitch-ass nigga who got weed
They killed my homie and I'm restless
Gotta get 'em back
A nigga with a MAC and a death wish
Tears in my eyes, don't cry
Look up to the sky and wonder why
Do everybody gotta die?
Another soldier in a casket
Can't eat, you can't sleep, 'til I bury them bastards
His family is fallin' into pieces, his momma don't understand the madness
I can't explain the drama
And it hurts the most, when it's someone close
I smoke weed, 'cause I'm losin' hope
And any dope can see, the ghettos full of drug dealers
And ain't nobody born a killa
But it hurts the most

[Hook: Stretch & 2Pac]
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost

[Verse 3: Mopreme]
One man, drowning in the quicksand
Put my nigga down, with my full proof plan
All the other avenues that we tried was blocked
So it's time to put in work with the 10 milli Glock
And in no time flat, had the fucking money sack
I'ma guard it all, a hundred G's in my arms
All thanks to my nigga
Who took the most risk even though I was a little bigger
I thought it would be alright
Just bust another right and get ghost down the turnpike
But a fucking pig cut him off
My nigga won't soft, he let his 9 off
And that'll be the only way I'll take it
Filled him full of lead and now I'm raising his babies
Now, the money don't come close
'Cause when a friend die, it hurts the most
We living thug life

[Hook: Stretch & 2Pac]
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
When your nigga dies, it hurts the most
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
