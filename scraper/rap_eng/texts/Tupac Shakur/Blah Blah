[Chorus: Supreme Patty]
Bitch called my phone
She like blah-blah-blah-blah
But I'm on the road, I'm like nah-nah-nah-nah
She like wah-wah-wah-wah
I'm like yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I feel like Post Malone with that gra-ta-ta-ta

[Verse 1: Big Win]
I'm feeling like I'm up and I ain't coming down
I don't give no fucks so I can't fuck around
Ballin' 'til I fall 'til summer comes around
I need me some commas and a couple pounds
I been smoking, I been blazing, I been thinking, I been sipping
Making plays in different ways
To overcome the competition
You been hating, I been making observations on you're fakeness
I don't want no conversation
It's obvious we not the same bitch
Fuck you mean it's Big Win
Come and see the difference
Always on the move I keep the keys in the ignition
Like whoa, I ain't never slow
Back up on my bullshit, I'm just gassed up on the road
You already know

[Chorus: Supreme Patty]
Bitch called my phone
She like blah-blah-blah-blah
But I'm on the road, I'm like nah-nah-nah-nah
She like wah-wah-wah-wah
I'm like yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I feel like Post Malone with that gra-ta-ta-ta
They tryna take my throne
I'm like yeah, ha ha ha
I'm just in my zone
I feel like a rockstar
I been going hard and that shit is non-stop
Woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Supreme Patty]
Yeah, we gassed up on the road and we ain't moving slow
Never slowing down, just speeding up
Going so fast
In a Jaguar, like it's Nascar
So we walk hard, we going crazy
Bad hoes all over me
Catch me on the tv like damn
Sitting back relaxing, I'm dreamin'
All the fakes, they scheming
Talk now they tripping
But fuck life they living
Lil Xans at 18 you feening
Like these hoes you tweaking
Smoke weed till you sleeping

[Chorus: Supreme Patty]
Bitch called my phone
She like blah-blah-blah-blah
But I'm on the road, I'm like nah-nah-nah-nah
She like wah-wah-wah-wah
I'm like yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I feel like Post Malone with that gra-ta-ta-ta

They tryna take my throne
I'm like yeah, ha ha ha
I'm just in my zone
I feel like a rockstar
I been going hard and that shit is non stop
Woah, woah, woah
