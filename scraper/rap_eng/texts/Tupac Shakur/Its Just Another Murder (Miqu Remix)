[Hook]
It's just another murder
It's when we ride on our own kind
It's just another murder
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
It's just another murder
It's when we ride on our own kind
It's just another murder
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end

[Verse 1]
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heart-broke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went

[Hook]
It's just another murder
It's when we ride on our own kind
It's just another murder
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
It's just another murder
It's when we ride on our own kind
It's just another murder
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end

[Verse 2]
And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a nigga living phat

[Hook]
It's just another murder
It's when we ride on our own kind
It's just another murder
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
It's just another murder
It's when we ride on our own kind
It's just another murder
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
