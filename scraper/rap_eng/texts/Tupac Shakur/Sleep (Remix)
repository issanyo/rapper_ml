[Intro: 50 Cent + 2Pac]
Oh shit, new shit
2Pac nigga, don't fall asleep
Y'all gon' love this shit
Aye nigga, aye smug don't think I don't hear you out there talkin' about me you little dirtbag
Brush your teeth before you talk about me
Wash under ya arms, nigga you smell like Queensbridge
Yeah, tell them niggas how I took that 325,000 back from you nigga
I'm like God to you niggas, you know God giveth, and God taketh away
I come back off tour, I'ma catch you and I'ma whoop the skin off yo' ass nigga
And that other bitch, Wendy Williams talkin' 'bout me and shit
Bitch look like...a fuckin' transvestite
Fuckin' Chucky's bride bitch, plastic
I love this shit, keep fuckin' wit' me
Quit starin' at me like an infrared nigga

[Verse: 2Pac]
Pictures of plenty, sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my semi-automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact, 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire, niggas die with open eyes
Scared to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Blackout, blow the track out, my lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like Yayo
Niggas pull out, when I say so (buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, it's fatal
Efficiently I delete and flee
The art of war livin' sucka free, get with me
Muthafuckas don't

[Chorus: 2Pac (2x)]
Don't go to sleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
