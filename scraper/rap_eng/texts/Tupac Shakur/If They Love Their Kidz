[Intro: 2Pac]
If my enemies love their kids
Only if my enemies love their kids
If my enemies love their kids
If my enemies love their kids
Only if my enemies love their kids

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Hey, why have drama
Nigga, your baby mama stay right around the corner
I could touch her if I fuckin' wanna
So why you wanna insist to diss?
I got your name at the top of "fuckin' dead bitch" list
Meet Mr. Makaveli's terror, mack of the year, thug of the era
Death Row and Outlawz, nobody does this shit better
My lyrics explode on contact, best prepare for combat
Ain't no stoppin' so bomb back
It's the last days, niggas is dyin' for bullshit
MAC-11 is heavy, yet I'm ready to pull quick
Niggas ain't ready for a brother that's livin' major
Bear witness to a sick motherfucker that's spittin' razors
When I cut 'em they cut, when I stick 'em they stuck
And my ambitions to bust, 'cause I ain't givin' a fuck
We tore the neighborhood up, look at all the shit that we did
Murder's a life long bids, if my enemies love they kids

[Hook: 2Pac]
You don't wanna die
And I don't wanna kill ya
Keep my name out ya mouth
'fore a nigga have to drill ya
All my enemies buried for the shit that they did
Don't make me murder you nigga
If my enemies love their kids

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Bodies is wrapped in plastic, nigga, this is drastic
Just takes a nigga with the right automatic to cause static
Like a Mossberg dumpin', and muthafucker'll do jumpin'
Make 'em role of a bitch, like Michael Jackson, " Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' "
Holla at my crew and they perish, who do you cherish?
Got that ass in my sight
Tonight I'm bussin' off the terrace with multiple gun shots
Niggas is droppin' rapidly, bussin' at crooked cops
Them bitches is runnin' after me, tell 'em I'm high
When they ask "why I'm trippin' out the top of my drop?"
'Cause you know why?
Keep dippin' on my block they sell rocks and box with frail cops
If not we buss shots from Glocks, fuck cops
My only fear of death, can you hear me, it's "comin' back"
Had enough of this bullshit world so none of that
I felt no remorse for all the shit that we did
Niggas dyin', hear the sirens, if my enemies love their kids

[Hook: 2Pac]
You don't wanna die
And I don't wanna kill ya
Keep my name out ya mouth
'fore a nigga have to drill ya
All my enemies buried for the shit that they did
Don't make me murder you nigga
If my enemies love their kids

[Interlude: 2Pac]
You muthafuckin' right
These niggas better wise up
It’s a real muthafuckin' war nigga
You don't wanna get with me
How the fuck you gon' get with me
If you got kids muthafucker
If my enemies love they kids
I’ma let my lil' homeboys ride on you busta muthafuckers
'Cause y’all don't feel me
Eh yo Mu, K, Malc
Ride on these bitch ass mothafuckers
Ride on 'em!

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
I don't even wanna talk no more
Losin' your life, what for?
Facin' a young muthafucker who puts it down for the dough
Get killed in front of your kids, God forbid if it happen
'Cause the shit I'm on now I'm taking pass on us rappin'
Gotta survive by myself, but at the same time get wealth
Won't put my gun on the shelf, it keeps me livin' like heaven
But when the shit jumps I'm ready 'cause I already knew
You better get us muthafucker 'fore we come get you
Deep in my heart I think this shit's about to pop any moment
Tryna do me like my parents but I'm a tougher opponent

[Verse 4: Kastro]
This nigga scared, must bein' fussed again [all?] I'm prepared
For all the drama, you stayed with all them niggas you feared
You fuckin' busta, musta let the evil or the money trap you and slappin' at'chu
Every second we comin' at you and you the last one
When no rocksis tryna cast one
Guess a young rider who would die for fuckin' blast of that thug passion
Clashin' on enemies passin'
Gigglin' when they should've been figurin' who would be the last one, laughin'
While I switch your wig, I gotta ask y’all somethin'
"Don’t y'all muthafuckers got kids?"
