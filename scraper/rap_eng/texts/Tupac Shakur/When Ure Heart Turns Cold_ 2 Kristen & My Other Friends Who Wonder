When your heart turns cold
it causes your soul 2 freeze
Spreads throughout your spirit
Like a ruthless feeling disease
The walls that once were down
Now stand firm and tall
Safe from hate/love, pain/joy
until u feel nothing at all
When ure heart turns cold
a baby's cry means nothing
A dead corpse is trivial
Mothers neglecting children is daily
Lonliness becomes your routine friend
Death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant
if you even sleep at all
u forget ideals and turn off the reason
2 make sure the product is sold
You don't understand how I behave
Just wait till your heart turns Cold!
