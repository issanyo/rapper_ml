[Intro:] Fred
Ahh
Pro and Dot What Up
The state The state we in
I mean it used to be better
We used to be friendly competition bar for bar
Everybody pushing their pen
Much different now
I don't Know?

[Verse: 1 Fred]
I this close to blowing up (July 1)
My sixteen bars is killer I'm diverse
Or do search? knowing how my pen work
They said Im a breath of fresh air Im like ten certs
I buy they cd Im skimming through the inserts (come on?)
The lack of skill man I been hurt (been hurt)
Rappers don't want to admit to my face that my work is wet
So to ride my wave the surf the net (True!)
Its disgusting not for nothing
Me Prez always had these type of discussions
I mature I spit sick and the cure died in March and September and February remember? (Rest In Piece)
I still listen to their music Im still learning its different things I could use (Shit!)
Thats why I rhyme the same
To make sure y'all ain't die in vain

[Hook:]
I think about Big this what he died for
I think about Pac this what he died for
I think about Pun this what he died for
The hunger in my eyes so this is what Im ride for

I think about Big this what he died for
I think about Pac this what he died for
I think about Pun this what he died for
The hunger in my eyes so this is what Im ride for

[Interlude:] 2Pac

You know I feel as thou I'm cheated
Because instead of me fulfilling my prophecy,I have to start one
Instead of me doing a good job and carrying on an empire I have to build one

[Interlude:] Biggie
Most niggas they feel like well you see what biggie's
You know he has the hat the kangoo and this and you have to be like that
But if you don't really want to be like that you don't have to be like that
You know what I'm saying

[Verse 2:]
I vision that suburban
Every March 9 is kind of disturbing
Im rhymer who's wording is urgent
Flow live we'll never be a Tie like detergent
On the block BM think of Pacs BM (Vegas)
Thinking of them gunshots damn why'd it have to be him
Thats why I spit it street and I spit it A-ccapella cause Pun's heart missed a beat
If we don't push it with the pen than fuck it, I just feel like we doing them an injustice
I get it
That's word to my grandmother treat everyday like I'm part of making the band brother
You see they fear what they don't understand, so they hear my metaphors but they don't understand
Dem punch lines is gonna make them remember me cause I'm going hard in your memory
GODSON!
