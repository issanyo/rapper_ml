I think they wanna hear some of this

Yeah, c'mon, uh, c'mon, yeah, c'mon
Where my niggas at!?
Yeah, c'mon, uh, c'mon
Uh, c'mon

[Chorus]
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Freeze, at ease, now let me drop some more of them keys
It's 1-9-9-tre, so let me just play
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic, I'm back with Dr. Dre
But this time I'mma hit yo' ass with a touch
To leave motherfuckers in a daze, fucked up
So sit back relax new jacks get smacked
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg I'm at the top of the stack
I don't lack for a second, and I'm still checkin'
The dopest motherfucker that you're hearin' on the record
It's me, ya see, S-N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G-Y, the D-O-double-G
I'm fly as a falcon, soaring through the sky (And what?)
And I'm high till I dizzie, rizzide
So check it, I get busy, I make your head dizzy
I blow up your mouth like I was Dizzy Gillespie
I'm crazy, you can't phase me
I'm the S oh yes, I'm fresh, I don't fuck with the stress (Baby, babay)
I'm all about the chronic, bionic ya see
Every single day, chillin' with the D-O-double-G's
P-O-U-N-D that's my clique, my crew
Ya fuck with us, we gots to fuck you up
I thought ya knew, but yet and still
Ya wanna get real, now it's time to peel, ya say chill
And feel, the motherfuckin' realism
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the mic, I'm hittin' hard as steel nigga

[Chorus]
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas (C'mon, yeah)
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas (Louder, I can't hear you)
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
How many hoes in your motherfuckin group
Wanna take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about that East Side
Niggas like myself, here to show you where it's at (Yeah)
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back (Say what)
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your ho, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and don't really give a shit
About nuttin' at all, just my Doggs, steppin' through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade 'em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many bitches in the house will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be ryhmin'
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G and I'm climbin', I'm climbin'

[Outro]
This is for the G'z
