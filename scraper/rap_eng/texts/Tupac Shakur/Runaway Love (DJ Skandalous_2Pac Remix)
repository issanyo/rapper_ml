[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
"That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family"
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

[Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway runaway love
Don't keep runnin away
I'll run away with you, if you want me to
Lahhhhhhh

[Outro: Ludacris]
Yeah, I can only imagine what you goin through ladies
Sometimes I feel like runnin away myself
So do me a favor right now and close your eyes
And picture us runnin away together
When we come back everything gonna be okay
Open your eyes {*echoes*}
