[Intro]
Yeah
West side
See ya
Hahahahaha
Wooo!
Real niggas in the building
Hahah
Pac, what up baby?
(Yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga!)
How you feelin', nigga?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now take a look inside my mind
That pen' time made me wise but still I rise
'Cause my ambitions as a ridah like landmines
Lyrics turn niggas into smithereens
Music so lethal, turn coliseums to murder scenes
I'm Makaveli the Don is what they tell me, I'm armed
I'm droppin' niggas like bombs
Get in that ass like a thong
Picture a felon in ya presence
Takin' bustas back to the essence
Tellin' my people peep my lethal message
Visions of me gettin' money got me in mash mode
Murderous motive for niggas stoppin' my cash flow
You can't fight it nigga, let go
Witness the sound, made ya bitch ass bow down to Death Row
Mama, these niggas got me fightin' these 3 Strikes
Showin' up in court, fuck what you thought it's three nights
I put the game down first put my niggas up on it
Now we America's Most Wanted
Feel me

[Hook: 2Pac]
Bitches is wild, niggas is lame
I hung around with real niggas got exposed to the game
Muthafuckas actin' crazy bustin' me in the jaw
Initiated as an Outlaw (Outlaw)
Bitches is wild, niggas is lame
I hung around with real niggas got exposed to the game
Muthafuckas actin' crazy bustin' me in the jaw
Initiated as an Outlaw

[Verse 2: Steele]
Take a look inside my block where we beef with the peep cop
Bop when the beat drop
Cock when the streets hot
Shell-shocked we out to tote lead
Remember the teachers when we and 'Pac broke bread
He said One Nation is what this nation most fear
Now I swear most these rappers ain't ready for warfare
We Outlaw since birth, that's why the lost fear
Now betcha all every verse gon' have a mall scared

[Verse 3: Tek]
It's hella mean the don, you find it in the Quran
You catch me in the trap gettin' my grind on
I produce from the line where the hustlers made
Seein' visions on my money yeah my name was Krazed
And this way I'd carry from state to state
This here is the man that my mama made
You can read Montana, see that a it's ya boy
Raised in the game, initiated as an Outlaw

[Hook: 2Pac]
Bitches is wild, niggas is lame
I hung around with real niggas, got exposed to the game
Muthafuckas actin' crazy bustin' me in the jaw
Initiated as an Outlaw (Outlaw)
Bitches is wild, niggas is lame
I hung around with real niggas got exposed to the game
Muthafuckas actin' crazy bustin' me in the jaw
Initiated as an Outlaw

Verse 4: [[?]]
Take a look inside my brain!
Dippin' through the rain and into range bumpin' Dr. Strange
My Glock aim is impeccable
What scared to do or sketch to do
A couple of body bags to catch hella flu
Cold with the fortune oh I'm scortchin'
Got that FEDS lookin' at me like "that boy toastin'"
No, but I be on the road to Boston
Hustle man like Martin and I'm Tracy Morgan
So I get that money right, get the paper can right I
The only one to pay to connect mic
B me rst believe that vest be
So postin' my chest
I can't breathe in the city of thieves, I rest please
Can't tell me nothin', my gun bustin' with ease
No prob, so far I gotta crowbar, rough pic
Froze and now I'm initiated as a Outlaw

[Hook: 2Pac]
Bitches is wild, niggas is lame
I hung around with real niggas got exposed to the game (real niggas)
Muthafuckas actin' crazy bustin' me in the jaw
Initiated as an Outlaw (Outlaw)
Bitches is wild, niggas is lame (uha)
I hung around with real niggas got exposed to the game (that's right)
Muthafuckas actin' crazy bustin' me in the jaw (yeah)
Initiated as an Outlaw hahahha
