Baby

(2Pac) Brenda got a baby, but Brenda barely got a brain/ a damn shame the girl can hardly spell her name/

(K.A.Y.O verse) that's not our problem that's up to Brenda's family/ well let me show you how it affects our whole community/ only a couple days when i was stranded in the trash heap/ moms trashed me, didn't know  what else to do when she had me/ I was panicking, whining, nobody clearly could hear me/ searching for food while I'm laying there literally filthy/ conspiracy theory, to why, I was left, stomach was empty/ this is when crack, had, plummet the city/ just a infant, who mother didn't care for his existence/ while I'm breathing I'm weeping and trying to find me a exit/ who can help me? Can anyone hear my screams/ the horrors of rats & other fearful things/ running around nibbling on a infants feet/ no one cares or they're just not, listen-ing/ nights turn to days days turned to nights/ surprised that I lasted this long in my life/ the trash will be emptied within a couple days/ i cried no one witnessed  this baby's troubled face/ I hear the truck backing up,and everything erupts/ now trash flying around while I'm falling in dust/ garbage truck opens it's ready for it's disposal/ so I hold on to the thing that I'm currently close to/ piece of cardboard with  writings that said I love you/ i see my fate guess, now I'm headed to the dump too/ dump starts to tilt resido starts flying/ my lungs start to welp vegetables start sliding/ might just see my death like my heart just started dying/ as I'm reaching for dear life so I fall as I'm climbing/ falling real fast  while my hands are steady reaching/ my skull hit some glass, and started the heavy bleeding/ lost my wind cries turned to heavy screaming/ on top of me feel like I'm already teething/ baby bib with stains of milk got ripped and nailed/ to the compactor, terrified, what comes after?/ slow crushing, all of a sudden, bones shatter/ will I have God's grace? And come home faster/ No I won't, the compact then jams/ and then someone grabs me with his bare hands/ pulled me out and saved the, (Baaabbbbyyyy)/So, Yes, I'm Brenda's baby/
