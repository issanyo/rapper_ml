[Intro: 2Pac]
(I love this motherfucka tryna catch me)
(fuck this nigga)
(what's happen, what's happen)
(fuck you wanna trip fool, what's happen nigga fool)
(we can throw it off nigga)
Two niggas about to have a fight, look, look, check it out
(we can throw it off nigga)
(What's up nigga?, what's up?)
Throw yo mothafuckin' hands up nigga, throw yo hands up
That's right, we gone take it back
These mothafuckas goin' to start catchin' lefts and rights and uppercuts
I don't give a fuck
Put your guns down, lets have fun now
Throw your hands Up, that's right nigga
We goin' ol' school on these suckas

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
How many suckas wanna see me
Jealous, cause they peepin' me on TV
Mad, cause they bitches wanna G me
Now take it easy, it ain't my fault to see a hooker
You should've shook her, don't playahate me when I took her
Life of a crook, look at them thug niggas ballin' y'all
I gotcha hoochies full of liquor fuckin' all of y'all
And my, name!!, will be synonymous with spittin' game
Slangin' 'caine, it ain't the same, niggas better change
Them 3 strikes will have ya stretched fo' life
Get arrested twice The third time fo' life
And I, don't think you understand me G
That Penitentiary time just ain't the plan for me
I got a, new thang; getcha papers and do thangs
Niggas ain't followin' ya true game
Cause if they was, they wouldn't be runnin' for they trunk
Every time that it's time for funk
Mothafucka throw yo hands up

[Hook: 2Pac, Killa, Moe ZMD & Ronnie Love]
Leave the guns and the knives at home
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
Throw ya hands (just throw ya hands up)
Throw ya hands up in the air (get 'em up, come on)
Throw ya hands up
Leave the guns and the knives at home
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
(we no punk ya little trick ass nigga, come on)
Throw ya hands up (just throw ya hands up)
Throw ya hands up (get 'em up)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Could it be, that controversy was my destiny
I let my anger get the best of me
Everywhere we hang its the same thang
In '95 you can die if ya gang bang
You could survive, gettin' high like a true G
Can't close my eyes cause these cowards wanna do me
And sue me I've been hustlin' since day one
Out on the block and never stop until my pay come
But now a days Its like bang, bang, duck quick
I guess you rookies tough shit, cause you bust clips
But suck dick, cause a kid got his cap pealed
The rap deal from the phonies who pack steel
And act ill, Everybody wanna act hard
I swear to god It's the season to pull a nigga card
You fuckin' frauds can't handle business like a soldier
I bet you too petrified to throw it from the shoulders
Nigga, now throw your hands up

[Hook: 2Pac Killa, Moe ZMD & Ronnie Love]
Leave the guns and the knives at home
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
Throw ya hands up
Throw ya hands up (what you scared of nigga, what you goin' for the trunk man, what!)
Get 'em up, come on (throw ya hands up)
Leave the guns and the knives at home
(sucka ass)
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on (I knew he was a punk)
(Throw ya hands up) throw ya hands up
Just throw ya hands up
(that nigga [?] little trick to listen up)
Get 'em up

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Last year motherfuckers tried to bury me deep
I had a beef in every city, screamin' fuck the police
Couldn't sleep, I'm havin' thoughts about the baddest bitches
Picture me mobbin' in a rag with switches, punk snitch
I let a trick be a trick when he slippin', leave 'em sleepin'
In the middle of the streets while I'm pimpin'
You can throw a sign but I'm blind to that punk shit
Runnin' with some real motherfuckers and we run shit
Fuck the dumb shit, I ain't stoppin' it's a high speed
Rollin' on the 405 puffin' thai weed
I'm shiftin' gears, then I disappear
Listen here, If they take me alive I'm doin' years
But still no fear cause I don't think they can catch me
This 350 will put the bitches right in back of me
They won't jack me and just when I thought I passed
I fucked around and went low on gas
All I heard was "Throw Yo Hands Up"

[Hook: 2Pac, Killa, Moe ZMD & Ronnie Love]
Leave ya guns and ya knives at home (damn)
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on (shift too, shit)
Throw ya hands up
Throw ya hands up , get 'em up, come on (throw ya hands)
Leave ya guns and ya knives at home
(hey don't shoot nigga, I got my hands up, don't shoot)
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
Throw ya hands up
Throw ya hands up
(don't shoot, my hands up, I'm comin' out the car now)
Get 'em up
Throw ya hands up

[Outro: 2Pac]
All y'all niggas out there thinkin' y'all really like you know
Tearin' shit up
But ya really ain't bro
You only sendin' the police to the blocks faster
Soon them niggas gone be comin' wit' army tanks and shit
Just mowin' niggas down
Plus half you mothafuckas can't shoot no one
Put the mothafuckin' guns down
Nigga lets take it from the shoulders
If you a real mothafuckin' soldier

[Hook: Killa, Moe ZMD & Ronnie Love]
Leave the guns and the knives at home
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
Throw ya hands
(just throw ya hands up, get 'em up, come on)
Leave the guns and the knives at home
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
Throw ya hands
(just throw ya hands up, get 'em up) throw ya hands up
Leave the guns and the knives at home
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
Throw ya hands
(just throw ya hands up, get 'em up, come on)
Leave the guns and the knives at home
Don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
Throw ya hands
(just throw ya hands up, get 'em up)

Oh, we don't need no gat
We don't have to go out like that
Just throw ya mothafuckin' hands in the air
We don't need no gat
We don't have to go out like that
Just throw ya mothafuckin' hands in the air
Come on!!
Throw ya hands in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Oooooh yea..
And ain't no thang about to pump
Just throw ya hands in the air
