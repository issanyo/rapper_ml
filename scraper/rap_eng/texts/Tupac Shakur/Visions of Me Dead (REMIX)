[Intro]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
God bless the dead, and buried
Nigga, don't worry
If you see God first
Tell him shit got worse
I ain't mad
I know you representing the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models - gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Saying shit don't stop nigga no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money making motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to trying, never meant to do time
My epitaph, will read, was the last of G's
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead

[Hook: 2Pac]
I see visions of me dead, lord are you there?
A closed casket at my funeral, and no one's there
Is there a heaven for a killer? I change my ways
And every day, I'm a hustler, getting paid
I see visions of me dead, lord are you there?
A closed casket at my funeral, and no one cares
Is there a heaven for a G?
I'm telling you now, you motherfuckers don't know me

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
The motherfucking dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do have you the heart to see a nigga
Before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Busting motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even gone
Now how the hell do you explain, my claim to fame
From doing flicks to busting tricks out the fucking frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers, got em ducking from my smoking Glock
And busting niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watching bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I’m living? I’m a hustler
Bucking busters, 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AK’s heading for the burbs
Aiming at them skin-head bitches let it rain
Giving em a wet welcome to the house of pain!

[Hook: 2Pac]
I see visions of me dead, lord are you there?
A closed casket at my funeral, and no one's there
Is there a heaven for a killer? I change my ways
And every day, I'm a hustler, getting paid
I see visions of me dead, lord are you there?
A closed casket at my funeral, and no one cares
Is there a heaven for a G?
I'm telling you now, you motherfuckers don't know me

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
Two- Two strikes slipped got arrested and flip
He screamed "thug life"

[Hook: 2Pac]

And every day, I'm a hustler, getting paid
I see visions of me dead, lord are you there?
A closed casket at my funeral, and no one cares
Is there a heaven for a G?
I'm telling you now, you motherfuckers don't know me
