[Verse 1] As real as it seems the American Dream/
Ain't nothing but another calculated scheme/
To get us locked up shot up back in chains/
To deny us of the future rob our names/
Kept my history a mystery but now I see/
The American Dream wasn't meant for me/
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me/
Promised me freedom, education, equality/
Never gave me nothing but slavery/
And now look at how dangerous you made me/
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold/
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told/
Promise me emancipation in this new nation/
All you ever gave my people was starvation/
Fathers of this country never cared for me/
They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery/
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me/
Except lie about the facts in my history/
So now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployed/
But the government's glad cause they enjoyed/
When my people are down so they can screw us around/
Time to change the government now panther power//

[Chorus]

[Verse 2] Coming straight that resides within/
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win/
Self proclaimed best suppressed the rest/
The rich get richer and the poor take less/
The American Dream was an American nightmare/
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair/
The Ku Klux Klan tried to keep us out/
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed/
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom/
But now we’re impatient/
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs/
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out/
"Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are/
It's ya panther power that makes you a star”/
Panther power//

[Chorus]

[Verse 3] My Mother never let me forget my history/
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me/
Wanted to be more than just free/
Had to know the true facts about my history/
I couldn't settle for being a statistic/
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic/
Government cause it was meant to hold us back/
Using ignorance, drugs, and sneak attack/
In my community think of a unity/
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity/
I strike America like a case of heart disease/
Panther power is running through my arteries/
Try to stop me oh boy you'll be clawed to death/
Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath/
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?/
You think you're living free don't make me laugh at you/
Open your eyes realize you've been locked in chains/
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name/
Cause some time has passed seem to all forget/
There is no liberty for you and me we ain't free yet/
Panther power//
