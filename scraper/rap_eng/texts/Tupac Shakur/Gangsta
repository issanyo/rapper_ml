Twisty - Gangsta

[Intro: 2pac]
Ain't that a bitch
This one here for the ***** that be johnny dangerous when they 50 deep
They be cowards when they by themselves
You know what I'm talkin about!

[Chorus: Kat Dahlia]
You say you a gangsta
It don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta
Ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all myself
I ain't gettin no help
From no one.. from no one..

[Verse: Twisty808]
You say you a gangsta
A G
Ain't ever sold a gram in the street
But you a beast
Think your team a Flying V
Ducks always quack they don't speak
No scope
I aim and release
Unleashed
Buried alive you weak
Gets hard to breath
Wreck bars like diamonds on rebar
I eat
Strip your pride like choppin cars
On any night of the week
Been there and done that
I repeat
I feast
On anyone with a soul
Shang tsung "finish him" and he folds
Bang bang if you don't
Can't hang cause he choke
Approaching like sir you rang?
No I don't
I'm poaching for the roast
Igniting any coast
Don't fight or get rolled
Acting hype takes it's toll
You like flava flave
With no gold
You bold
Behind your boys
Yappin away
Brick to the face
No yappin today

[Chorus: Kat Dahlia]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse: Kat Dahlia]
And this recession so depressing
My parents don’t stop stressing
Just hoping I learned all their lessons
Mmm and I’m paying for this session, I’m paying for this session
And I’m paying rent, food, clothes, phones, christmas presents
Six shots in, I’m just counting all my blessings
No days off baby, I ain’t resting
I told my sins, now I'm done confessing

[Chorus: Kat Dahlia]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse: Kat Dahlia]
One way to the top, I'll make with what I got
You want my number, baby, I’m on a mission, catch up
Men selling love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves he’ll start flirting with me
So I took my heart off my sleeve
Never trust a man cause they all hungry
Yeah, they all hungry
Never trust a man cause they all hungry

[Bridge: Kat Dahlia]
Right when you thought you had me
Baby, you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby, time to move on
Never learned your lesson
Ain’t even gon' question
Why it went so wrong

[Bridge: Kat Dahlia]
Right when you thought you had me
Baby, you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby, time to move on
Never learned your lesson
Ain’t even gon' question
Why it went so wrong
