[Verse]

Lately all y'all niggas been acting real subtle

Talking bout "Lammy ain't the same"
Cause I chose another way from "the wave"
Boy I still got game
Nigga ain't nothing change but the huddles

It's funny how the people say they love you
But they ain't really there when it's trouble

And they don't never see when you struggle
Til a blood nigga bleed
Or a crip nigga crumble

That's why i gotta go and get my cheese on a double

In case these burger niggas try greasing you out the shuttle
For wanting to be above you

And you know when the pain rain tears
Mother fuckers start playing in the puddle

But fuck it I'm prepared for the rain though
Brand new Tommy Hil rain coat

Niggas talking all that shit, tell em come to the 646
(But your phone is off)

Riding through the hood
Riding all day
It's the B to the R
To the double O. K
And you know we never LY
N we coming yo way

When you look us in the eye
What the fuck you gonna say?

We done got niggas lined just for stepping on the jays

Brett Favre feeling, with the fade
Bret Hart feeling, with the shades

Niggas claiming that they real?
Yeah I think they really fake

If you niggas wasn't pinching in for the steak
Why the fuck you niggas think you eating off the plate?

It be the same little niggas from your home that'll change
Man I thought spreading love was the way
But fuck it man

[Chorus]

I'm still putting on for the state
11208

Fuck niggas always wanna talk
Broke niggas always wanna hate

Man I find it kinda weird
That these niggas wanna shake
But these niggas never wanna pop

Bandana tied around my face
Got a nigga feeling like he Pac
Thug Life nigga!
