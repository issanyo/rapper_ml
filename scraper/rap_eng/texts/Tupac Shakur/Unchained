[Chorus: 2Pac]
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Get it on, till I die, get it on, till I die
Y’all, y’all remember me
Y’all, y’all remember me

[Verse 1: James Brown]
You sold me out for chicken change
You told me that they, they had it all arranged
You had me down
Last chance, fancy pants
Oh, very well
You gotta get ready, for the big payback
The big payback!
Hey, hey

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Get it on, till I die, get it on, till I die
Y’all, y’all remember me
I like the way you die, boy
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Get it on, till I die, get it on, till I die
Y’all, y’all remember me
I like the way you die, boy

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds
Ya’ll remember me, legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face ‘em
Take them to places, stake they face
Then erase ‘em and brake ‘em
Murder motherfuckers at a rate and then quicken the pace
Blast me, but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Now even if you blind you still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you're going through
Outlawz rushing you, busting you, we untouchable

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Get it on, till I die, get it on, till I die
Y’all, y’all remember me
I like the way you die, boy
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Am I wrong, 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Get it on, till I die, get it on, till I die
Y’all, y’all remember me

[Outro: 2pac]
Expect me like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I’m coming, hahaha
