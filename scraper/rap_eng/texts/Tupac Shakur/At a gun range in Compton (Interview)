[2Pac]: Okay, basically all throughout being black in America
we always had [?] non-violent, peaceful, logical and more sane than every other race you know
we could never take the stands which is our true stands to be straight soldiers, straight warriors until hip hop came
when hardcore hip hop came, it was all right for a nigga to say fuck y'all you know we gon' do the fuck we want you know bang bang you know
it was cool for a nigga to do that, other than that
it was never heard of even back in 'em Jim Brown days them niggas was dying at the end of the pictures you know
and hip hop done niggas still living that nigga that doing all the dirt still living it's like.. that's like the hero shit that go back to Africa telling stories and shit we just pass the hero through soldier though
we passing story through soldier and hardcore youngster that come up when they see there's nigga that can do something that can shoot back shit it's all good
you would still pride you would still self defense and everybody got the right of self defense

[Interviewer]: So 'Pac what you think about the movie as far as reality go you know what I'm saying
gang bangin' and is there reality popping right now

[2Pac]: In the streets you mean?

[Interviewer]: yeah

[2Pac]: hell yeah ain't nuttin but killing having right now
but it's really like you can't tell a nigga not to do that
because gangs ain't nuttin but tribes
and nigga could not survive out here by his self
so all I say the gang is all black
be down for all black
but shit you can survive out here by yourself, the police ain't nuttin but a gang your national guard is a gang
we learn all that gat shit from the government
we learn all this gun shit from the government you know
they get somebody get a gun the gov get bigger gun
how they gon show us that we can't pick up, so I'm picking up feel me

--

[Interviewer]: let's talk about violence 'Pac

[2Pac]: say it again

[Interviewer]: The violence that's jumping off now you know what I'm saying how'd you feel that'd affect the kids that's coming up right

[2Pac]: I think the black... excuse me .. black on black violence
affect the youngsters making 'em cold hearted
when we kill each other it make us not giving a fuck about blackness you know, when they see they own niggas you know they're grown niggas that's killing other niggas you know
it make it like to whereas they're cold and they heartless you know, I can said it 'cause I'm heartless
I grew up panther wise you know I'm sayin'
and nowadays nigga is like fuck that we gotta survive
I'm screaming black like the next man but when the first shot lick off you know it's all good everybody is all in
'cause niggas will kill you quicker than some of these crackers
and then they'll kill you but won't kill some of these crackers which kills me
so and also like that police violence against us that is making us crazy that was making us kill each other 'cause we really want to kill the police but we scared so we kill each other you know we got guns we just scare to do that to the motherfuckers that's doing it to us. So I feel as though, you know, shit, the violence is just making us more cold hearted animals you know some shit they can't fuck with
'cause we worse than anything they talked about it

[Interviewer]: Let's talk about the black panther thing. How did you come up growing up in it and handle that type of environment

[2Pac]: I'm saying my peoples, my folks staying down in Penitentiaries for bank robberies and killing cops and you know what I'm saying, that 's my family tree
it ain't no stretch for me to be talking the shit I be talking
and they didn't do it screaming let's go move the White— they was screaming African liberation
I'm talking about straight motherfucking G's
but now they in jail now you know, and didn't nobody gave a fuck and in this mothefuckers out here with beads, and all that drama that they be wearing and my folks is in the Pen' over that shit
so I takes shit like fuck it. I'm not that type of nigga that's gon be like a-ramba ramba, you know I live right here and it's hard right motherfucking here
I help y'all soon as I get there but while I'm right here, I'm speaking the language that we speak, I'm dressing in the clothes that we dressing and I'm fighting the battle that we got to fight, you know what I'm saying, and if niggas wanna be down shit it can be an all nigga thang but if niggas don't, shit I be by motherfucking self but niggas will be following you know what I'm saying
and niggas ain't gonna see it till the last second but now this ain't no shit that just happening in this Cent'— you know in this little 10 years
this shit been goin' on for a gang of time, everybody been talking about it
everybody been making song about. it's just for real you know what I'm saying
and we runnin' out of niggas to bury

[Interviewer]: Where's the music going 2Pac? is it gon' get harder?

[2Pac]: Shit, I don't know it depends on niggas balls. If niggas got big nuts like me it's gon get way harder. but shit if niggas got little nuts, it's gon start getting back to a different type rap you know what I'm saying
partying and fucking and all of that type of shit
because that's what we talking about when they don't let us talk about what we really wanna talk about. So it depends you can listen to the radio and listen to what niggas be talking about, and if they start talking that crazy shit then it ain't cool. If niggas still talking that thug shit you know that hardcore shit it's all good. But if they talking about like "hitting" you know all that crazy shit you know, it ain't gon' be like that. Not that nothing's wrong with that, but it's something wrong with it if you think that's hardcore you know what I'm saying

[Interviewer]:  [?]influenced through rappers head on  the kids????

[2Pac]: ultimate, ultimate. But see some of these kids don't know that some of these rappers ain't like that and that's the bad part you know
the good part it just some rappers who took that shit seriously like me
I feel as though everything I rap about shit anybody could check my card on it and I gotta be able to pullin' pull show and improve whenever somebody wanna pull my card on it some of these niggas
gotta do the same thang but it ain't like that
they screaming they soldiers but they not being soldiers in reality so it's like that what's the bad part
'cause some of these kids really believe you you know they really doing that shit
niggas be listening to tapes and knocking cop off and shit you know what I'm sayin' and that shit is deep you know what I'm sayin'

[Interviewer]: is that what you saying in like Strictly for niggas [?] in the album that came out

[2Pac]: yeah it's like,you know like, shit, fuck it ain't nuttin wrong with it being all black thang that don't mean we're racist 'cause we want niggas to survive
ain't nuttin wrong with that we say this just for blacks
can't nobody say shit if you sayin' we strictly for niggas
can't nobody I am being racist I ain't saying fuck all the crackers
I'm just saying still strictly for my niggas that's all niggas thang
you know and when I'm down Mexicans all that wanna be down but if that shit really it's for niggas

[Interviewer]: What about the female rappers [?] 'cause you be dissing the bitches and hoes and all that shit. How you feel about that?

[2Pac]: I feel as though it really ain't as big as everybody making you know. Even the females know what's bitches
females don't even hang with females. So why would they expect nigga understand something they don't understand it that's one. Two, is that these bitches is like boss she out there handling her business she aim saying why call me bitches; SHE CLOWNING! And that's what you do, that's how you show and improve bet no nigga gon' fuck with her. If you call yourself a bitch, Who can call you a bitch? But fuck it, I'm a nigga that's just like I don't even believe in that I'm not a bitch shit. If you're not a bitch. Why the fuck in that conversation? Why the fuck you even put-- I ain't no bitch, what okay

[Interviewer]: What about the female rappers?

[2Pac]: female rappers some is row, some is not, some still sellin' cock, some getting pimped, some is fucking whoever doing their music and soon them niggas ain't getting more pussy they ain't putting no more records out so that's like the damn part, if they just you know put they cock in they hand and just drop records it would be cool
but they keep fucking mixing business and pleasure that a nigga can't really be a fan of that
I can't really get in into boss' music if she's hardcore I'm gon' stay hardcore 'cause I can be down for that
liking this nigga tape
nah I won't buy this bitch tape
I buy this nigga tape
but if she start flip flopping it's a difference
anybody start flip flopping it's a difference


[2Pac]: every album I did I ain't trippin' off that
only time that I ever sat back and wrote the rhyme that I was goin' do and thought about it like it's the "Same Song" song I did with Digital Underground
besides that every record that came out that 2Pac did I did high and drunk in the studio while they was making the beat like laying the beat down
and that's why I be soundin' little sloppy
but that's all
it be like fuck it I feel as though niggas drunk and high when they gon' still listen to it you gon' like it or not
and I don't even picture myself to be as like Dre
I just picture myself to be like me
I would be putting out Underground if nobody ever buy my record and I'll selling up to whereas I can putting out underground tapes from there it's cool though
you know if you just signed with Death Row that's gon' be cool too, they gon' be doing my nigga up
it's all cool shit
they came to me and said: "Do you wanna work with the Row"
and I said "hell yeah"
Dre wanna do shit on my music, my next album
I can't really ask him nuttin more than that really in '93

[Interviewer]: so that's beginning of a new family thang

[2Pac]:Yep, we goin' on that tour, it's new
thug life and death row ain't that a bitch

[Interviewer]: You coming from up north right you coming from up north and then coming down here just chilling how is it from like up there in Oakland?

[2Pac]: it really ain't change just different cultures I feel as though the ghetto was the ghetto it ain't near ghetto I can't go to and kicking it and come up and I don't care who colors or not
I didn't always think that so I'm not being cocky
I was scared in L.A. to whereas I didn't know nuttin about the game thang
that's the only thing I was scared of
just ignorance not knowing we're not to go
shit if I been there long enough they can smoke me
I really don't care, it's all good, 'cause I'm in here, I'm in here
Watts, this is Compton there's no place that I won't go
and I feel as though if you got love and if you putting out real shit you can do that
if you kicking that shit from your heart you can go wherever your heart want you to go
if you kicking that shit from the white folks office them white folks gon' have to bring you through the hood
if you they tell you when you be a g
shit they gon' have to tell you when you come to the hood
so it's cool like this, since I got big nuts, my big nuts take me wherever I wanna go and I love that
I like that I like that
I went to Chicago, we was fucking with them gang niggas out there
it's a good feeling to be, you see these white folks running out like a fucker from these niggas then you get there they all like "What's up 'Pac"  they all like down
so it's true niggas can unite you know
--
--
Mo hand me that 40 ammunition , 40 millimeter ammunition
--
I show you how to trick, this a 10 millimeter but I'm loading it with 40 millimeter bullets 'cause it would work watch

[Interviewer]: In this like, anger you shooting at these targets right here?

[2Pac]: Anger?

[Interviewer]: Yeah

[2Pac]: that is when I got that MAC-11 I don't be tryna aim, I just be tryna hit they ass
but when I got the glock I aims and hit they ass (word)

--

[2Pac]: huh what on my music?
uhm shit the hood
everywhere I been I done live in New York that's where I was raised that's where I came up you know
and I done move to I done live in Harlem, The Bronx just in New York if you know that's two different cultures
then I done live to Baltimore, Marlon that's a whole another type culture that's that the Washington, D.C. scene I didn't live there for 4 years
I didn't live in Oakland for 4 years
I didn't came out to L.A. and here I be
it's like you moving all them ghettos you gon' pick up the slang and all them towns, you gon' pick up one common thing which is dope dealing
and that's what everybody do, everywhere I went that was the common thread you know dope everybody gotta make it you know what I'm saying
no matter how bad we look down on that that the no. 1 career for young black male in America in the real America

[Interviewer]: [?] music

[2Pac]: I don't really got nuttin, I rap, I'm a hip hop fan first
I was first and foremost that where I am, it shows
when I'm meeting niggas I like I show it ain't no on that bullshit
'cause I got big nuts, I don't care I like them niggas
but now I like "Beat It" I like all the hardcore niggas
I buy they tapes my [?]
any day any car I on anywhere I go
you can check my pockets or anything it's tapes hip hop
and I don't listen -- it ain't got to be the nigga that is platinum
it could be some underground tape I got from Chicago
but I spread that shit around I really do enjoy the music I like that hardcore shit I think it's good it get me through a lot to shit it get me through a lot to know that another nigga is feeling what I feel, going through what I going through
And if you keep it hardcore that's how it is
but if we always talking about the good time shit
when a nigga having a bad time he gotta turn his deck off
and listen to keep sweating it's not like, shit
hip hop should go through every single emotion that we have you know

---
---

[2Pac]: like that is the perfect example
when people used to ask me last year what you call your music hardcore I didn't even put it in that position I said it was
soul music 'cause that's what it is to me
it's like Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye you know how they used to like sang and no matter who is listen to the tape was still a black music, it was black music and  that's how you know the rap is it's like like "Straight Up Menace" that song "Straight Up Menace" Compton Most Wanted
when that shit came out nigga was having a bad day you know I was on my way to get some weed fucked up you know I done been intense and shit and I was listened to that shit just to know that another nigga was feeling the same way you feel
a rapper that you know that you seen and the music fit and the words fit that shit is like you know get you through
just like as if you gotta phone call from a homie to see I understand you know what I'm saying it's like the music let you know that another person understand and for the black community especially we have like broken families with no father no big brothers and so the music becomes the big brother or the music becomes the father
because you listen to all the fathers so you be like Ice Cu..
I grew up Ice Cube, Public Enemy, KRS-ONE, LL Cool J, Big Daddy Kane all them niggas was my daddy 'cause I ain't have nuttin and that's why I listen to em to know how to have big nuts you know what I'm saying them the niggas who I gauge my nuts by so if Cube was saying he was knocking this nigga off and Kane was saying this and this how you do a nigga and LL was saying you beating this niggas like this you grew up  being okay let's fuck it haha FUCK IT
I got big nuts aha, I'm knocking niggas off I'm not taking shit from the police, Cube told me this "Bitch Iz a Bitch" and I'm not fucking with these hoes you grew up and you get the listen that you would've gotten from your daddy but you get it from niggas 'cause they got it from they daddy and they spitting the game so the game is the music and it's like you paying 10 dollars for a whole lifestyle of game that why these white kids could dress and act like niggas 'cause all they got to do is gon' get 10 tapes and after they study them 10 tapes they got fucking hood 101 (hahahaha) that's the exact example
look at em white boys shit they got down pack mode on some niggas got they hats to the back they saggin', extra saggin' the right shoes the right belts they know what kinda draws they got to wear they know they got to have T-Shirt they know what  Swap Meet to go through they know when to [?] they ass home
that's all from our records we taught em that we ain't even get paid really so it ain't like it's just the music we selling we selling the game, the lifestyle
'cause soon we start talking about some of that Vanilla Ice shit they ain't gon' buy our records, long as you talking about the hood they gon' buy the record 'cause they wanna know what's happening in the hood
how we can we live as dope as y'all doing in the hood up in these rich ass mansions and that's what some rappers is doing they portraying the role but they really getting it from tapes they really getting it from all other shit

--

[2Pac]: I got these I got hollow point rifle bullets
let me show ya
you know rifle bullets go through the vest by they self they could go through the vest right
so by me having hollow point on it
you know hollow point making it expand it'll go through the vest and then expand (yeah), you know
that's for niggas the'd be wearing vest like me
listen for the police
if they ever come get me for some bullshit
nah I don't wanna go to jail which I don't I got this [?]
I ain't going to jail
not at less I want to, not at less I did some I go but I finna go for nothing you know what I'm saying, so if they come for me
I'm putting a 90 rounder in they *ass*

--

[2Pac]: (hollow point) hollow point like a motherfucker
so really a 90 rounder, with some hollow point and 223's, a glock, a MAC-11, a 9 millimeter, 357
gotta 12 gauge Mossberg over there.. sensational
niggas [?] than the motherfuckers offer me you feel me and a bag full of bullets
I'm telling some niggas could pack what I pack in a bags little bullets
and then you truly achieve unless you do all this I really don't think nigga should be doing that all rapping 'cause now go check my record and I'm rapping about all this
talking about 9's 45's all the shit that I got
and bullets how you gon' do all that killing nigga with no bullets
niggas be having 3 bullets in they guns
check you niggas check you niggas that got gun and I betcha
have the niggas got 3 bullets in they guns?
'cause they don't go to the range, they don't buy bullets, I gotta bag of bullets and I'm dead serious about this shit and I can shoot
half of these niggas came to shoot it's a range test I did this to set a precedent
now let's see what other niggas is doing all that other shit
now you know I'm talking it like I welcome it
now all I really gotta do is shoot at a live target
but it ain't got that deep yet and I'm not really tryna prove nuttin, so it's all good until then I keep shootin' in purpose
--
so don't get pistol whips
