[Biggie smalls]
(Verse1)
Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

[Biggie smalls]
(Verse2)
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga's style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga want to act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

(Verse3)
Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail, If I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and im mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause im rappin'
They asking me what happend
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep they taking polaroids
And im tryna' use the phone but they making noise
Man I wish I had my Glock cause its major
Im making shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't, leave me alone thats my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfucking murder
Im making collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talking shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to be socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshitting bitches ain't changing me
I came straight up out of gutta' I was saved from hell
Im a thug I was raised in jail, now im out on bail
