[Intro: Tony Montana]
You think you can take me? You'll need a fuckin' army!

[Hook: DJ Chop as 2Pac]
211, 187
Hit em with the duct tape
Hit em with the black trey
Now we get their fuckin safe (x3)
Don't make me turn this 211 to a 187 (x2)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
And freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggas know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggas trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggas get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies
At the coppers that persue me, bitch!
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas
)B-b-Bitch!
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas!)

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin
Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road
But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches right behind me!
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucker!
(They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucker!)
