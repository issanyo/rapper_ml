September 7, 1996, Tupac Shakur attended the boxing match between  Bruce Seldon and Mike Tyson with Suge Knight. After the match they assaulted a crip and went to Club 662 in the 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan with other cars behind also. At 11:15 a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac pulled over to the right side of Tupac's car rolling down the window and started shooting. Tupac was sent to the hospital and died 7 days later.
