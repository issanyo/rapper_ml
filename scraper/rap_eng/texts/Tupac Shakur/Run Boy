I suggest that you run boy
Cause I keep that thing so please nigga don't tempt me
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I don't give a fuck and i'm spraying 'till the clips empty
I suggest that you run boy

[Verse 1]
I'm the first nigga standing and the last to leave
Caught your homies talking shit but that's blasphemy
Nobody stop me with my killer posse
And armaggedon is here so be prepared for Illuminati
Infatuated by the wicked demons
And i've been raising hell ever since I started dreaming
I smoke to terminate the misery
I take a blunt to the head
They got me playing on my memories and my enemies
Die by a single shot
Don't give a fuck about they life, they can all rot
I paint a picture so vivid that they can barely miss it
He seen his homie get twisted so he banana clipped it
The paramedics couldn't fix the puzzle
Because the hole in his chest defying gravity that make them buckle
No doubt
He had it coming for a long time
I guess his cards been poor, but i'm walking on a thin line

[Hook]
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I keep that thing so please nigga don't tempt me
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I don't give a fuck and i'm spraying 'till the clips empty
I suggest that you run boy
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I keep that thing so please nigga don't tempt me
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I don't give a fuck and i'm spraying 'till the clips empty
I suggest that you run boy

[Verse 2]
Everyday be hustilng
In the streets tussling
I'm spitting so hard the engineer just brought a muzzle in
Brick City, the city of lost cause
We playing with them hammers, AKs' and Sawed Offs
Who gonna be the first one acting out of line?
Cause they gonna be the worst one who's body hard to find
We ain't playing, we treat them like Jason
They cut the body in half and send the parts to the Haitian
So meet me at the spot, it's room 2-22
Just had a body shot, man you know what to do
So call me when you amp and finish i'm at club 'Rolex'
And this is the beginning man you know where to go next
It's too hard to tell, the phone might be tapped
Send his body to hell until ?????
Somebody should talk to his daughter
He should ???? in this moment

[Hook]
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I keep that thing so please nigga don't tempt me
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I don't give a fuck and i'm spraying 'till the clips empty
I suggest that you run boy
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I keep that thing so please nigga don't tempt me
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I don't give a fuck and i'm spraying 'till the clips empty
I suggest that you run boy

[Verse 3]
Brick City is my hometown
I had a lot of ups and downs but i'm grown now
I kept the pound close because my foes want to murder me
And tell me, will I be mourned if I perish for eternity?
And Dear Lord, get me higher
I don't wanna live this life, the Devil is a liar
I seen the judge too many times for too many crimes
Next niggas getting slaughtered over too many grimes
How can we overcome this cruddy nation?
So we can help our seeds to possess all the information
So stack chips like Bill Gates and have faith
And make moves with steel plates and real cake
I write raps to put my thoughts out
And being black is worse than being strapped at the court house
I'm gaining knowledge from the older Gs
They tell me 'Get that paper' and 'Stay away from the phonies and flees'

[Hook]
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I keep that thing so please nigga don't tempt me
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I don't give a fuck and i'm spraying 'till the clips empty
I suggest that you run boy
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I keep that thing so please nigga don't tempt me
I suggest that you run boy
Cause I don't give a fuck and i'm spraying 'till this clips empty
I suggest that you run boy
