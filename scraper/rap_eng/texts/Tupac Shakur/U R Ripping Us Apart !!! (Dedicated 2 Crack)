Before u came the triangle never broke
we were bonded and melded as one
But as the 2 pushed u away
The one got weak and embraced u
and now u R ripping us Apart

The worst feeling of helplessness
The greatest pain has rested in my heart
The vision of heaven fades
and the nightmare of loneliness has started

My Hero has been defeated by you
and now what can I do
watch as u Destroy us
and our love is finally Through

I know the worst is Here
I feel it in my Heart
u got into the circle
now you're tearing us apart !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
