twinkle twinkle lil star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
(SHINE BRIGHT LIKE A DIAMOND)
How I wonder what you are

When we blaze the sun be gone
When he noting shines upon(yuh)
(OFFSET!)
Versace, Versace
Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
I know that you like it
Versace, my neck and my wrist is so sloppy
Versace, Versace
I love it, Versace the top of my Audi
My plug, he John Gotti
he give me the dozen, I know that they're mighty
Shoes and shirt Versace
your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk
I told that bitch "Versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve
but I ain't ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack
better run with it, nigga don't fumble

QUAVO!
