[Intro: 2Pac]
Don't
Don't support the phonies, support the real
You know what I mean?
How can these people be talking 'bout how they so real that they don't care about our communities?
How can they be talking about what they all this the hood blah blah blah... They don't care about our communities
You know what I mean listen to the words people say in their lyrics, and tell me if that's some real shit
If that's real to you, you know what I mean?
Listen to what they're saying
Don't just bob your head to the beat, peep the game
And listen to what I'm saying and hold us accountable for it
You know what I mean, erm!
And really you know whatever
If somebody else blow up and I fade out
That's just how it suppose to be
That's fate I ain't got no problems with that

[Verse 1: Jesse Jagz]
Uh, I'm killing em all forever
(Its Jesse Jagz Nation baby)
And this is how we learn to fly
We learn to live 'for we learn to die
Before we walk, we gon' stalk the sky
No lie, I'm the Eagle and the Hawk in the sky
We just (drags weeds) and we gently fly
We let the turbulence die, we on a permanent high
This is the life and the death of Pi
So full circles, the length and the breadth of pie
Show you how to live life, while I deliver flow like a midwife
Keep it pushing baby steady through the midnight
Roll another one nigga, make I smoke it with the king's pipe
Uh, It feels right to gimme insight
Get me invites, get me inside
Spray it, even throw it in the air like insecticide
If you move first the reflex is mine, cos since Jess' arrived
Fuckin' up the game nigga sex aside (sexicide)
Who's next in line, the eleventh time
Nigga X and I, full circle coming, nigga death of Pi

[Hook: Jesse Jagz]
Show me how to fly
Uh, we gon' live 'fore we learn to die
(This is how we do)
Don't burn the sky
Hope a nigga don't burn his eye
(This is how we do)
Uh, lemme show you how to fly
We gon' live 'fore we learn to die
(This is how we do)
Don't burn your eye
(This is how we, this is how we do)

[Verse 2: Jesse Jagz]
And this is how we learn to fly
Soul faces the sun, we ain't afraid to die
We gon' stalk the sky, its an amazing high
You're the Eagle I'm the Hawk with the Raven's eye
Uh, we taking off in the humid heat
Wingspan's bout 300 cubic feet
We gon' spray it in the air like pesticide
And put the, rest aside I'm the best to vibe
I drop it in the air baby stop and stare
What's that thing coming down through the stratosphere
You trap from fear, attack from the rear
Your chest cavity, and back just adapt to air
Suit down for the special ops, the 47 Glock
You're hit in several spot, 10 thousand megawatts
Jagz nation is known, circles and circle blocks
If you taking shot we gotta ready to respond, go!!!!

[Hook: Jesse Jagz]
Show me how to fly
Uh, we gon' live 'fore we learn to die
(This is how we do)
Don't burn the sky
Hope a nigga don't burn his eye
(This is how we do)
Uh, lemme show you how to fly
We gon' live 'fore we learn to die
(This is how we do)
Don't burn your eye
(This is how we, this is how we do)

Show me how to fly
Uh, we gon' live 'fore we learn to die
Don't burn the sky
Hope a nigga don't burn his eye
Uh, lemme show you how to fly
We gon' live 'fore we learn to die
Don't burn your eye
Show you how to fly

[Verse 3: Jesse Jagz]
Uh, and this how we learn to fly
Rhymes move at the speed that'll burn the sky
Sun hits his body and is still gon' shine
Rhymes are 100, the beat's 99.9
The soul retro
And I rep the Green Red Yellow
These sesame streets nigga snitching on Elmo
Hello, Jagz wrote the memo
Whole albums can't step to my demo
Uh, and this what we do
Find me running through your city and the capital too
My flow tactical, mathematical and practical too
Radical Jew, super flying, it's a factual truth
Found me smoking in the back of the booth
Niggas talking all long, I'm with the sack of my root
Actual truth, I'm killing, I'm the captain of dukes
And nigga fuck the beat, gimme a clap and a flute
Uh, we sky diving, we so high, you rhyme or die trying
We so fly the Lion's in Zion, eyes on the horizon
Climbing steady rising, and its surprising, we fly

[Hook: Jesse Jagz]
Show me how to fly
Uh, we gon' live 'fore we learn to die
Don't burn the sky
Hope a nigga don't burn his eye
Uh, lemme show you how to fly
We gon' live 'fore we learn to die
Don't burn your eye
Show you how to fly

[Outro]
(This is how we do)
(This is how we do)
(This is what we do)
(This is how we, this is how we do)
