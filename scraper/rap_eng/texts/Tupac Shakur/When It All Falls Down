[Kasinova Tha Don]
On a mission for Gs, I've been neglected as a young seed
Being free from prison thoughts was my fantasy
Crooked visions of being broke got me paranoid
Back in the days it was Haze that I can't afford
So now i'm moving way state-to-state
I pray to God everytime that i'm not too late
Please forgive me for my wicked ways
I know i'm sinning trynna sell another brick today
And In beginning nothing changed since the last time
I got sent to the Pen' just because I caught a fast dime
And 'Kasinova' is my alias...
And I've been spitting this Thug shit for real niggas ever since
What can I do when it falls down?
I'm feeling troubled...
And tell me who to call now, I'm seeing double
Uh, so merciful for my homies who getting paper
And do it right so I can see ya later

[Hook (Mr Bo'z)]
Somebody tell me
What's a man to do when it all falls down?
(When it all falls down)
What's a man to do when it all falls down?
(When it all falls down)
I said: What's a man to do when it all falls down?
You gotta hustle
(You gotta hustle)
You gotta make it right, make it right, yeah

[Mr Bo'z]
Another day and more time spent
Trynna make a dollar outta fifteen cent
I pray to God, please watch over me
While i'm in these vicious streets
The Police watchin', they wanna lock me
But I won't let them stop me
I gotta hustle, it's hard but you know
I gotta hustle
Well, well
One dollar, two dollar, three dollar, four
Can't stop then and I gotta get more
Go hard for this paper (With the Heart Of A Hustler)
And the heart of a gangsta
The Police creepin', they wanna trap me
But I won't let 'em catch me
I gotta hustle, I can't let 'em not to hustle
Can somebody tell me:

[Hook (Mr Bo'z and Kasinova)

[Kasinova Tha Don]
I see you made it through hell and I can tell that you living well
Caught up for crack sales but you still made bail
Only a coward wouldn't stack a dollar
So homie follow my lead so you can hustle proper
No more flossing at yous and making pops by the school
It's on now, little nigga follow the rules
Be prepared for the darker side... of the street life
You don't got the heart to ride... nigga keep tight
Don't be afraid because you started at an early age
This type of life will leave you sleeping in a dirty cage
Mama said be a man if I take that chance
I can't believe I'm climbing steps when she made that ramp
Still focused on this world peace
I gotta eat so I turn to these cold streets, uh
I get drunk, holla 'P-Funk'
Love it with my homies on the grind so I give them what they want

[Hook (Mr Bo'z)]
Somebody tell me
What's a man to do when it all falls down?

I said: What's a man to do when it all falls down?

You gotta make it right, make it right, yeah

[Outro (Kasinova Tha Don)]
Yeah, another message to my young kids out there
You gotta do whatever you gotta do to get that paper
Cause in the end, ain't nobody gonna take care of you but you
You feel me?
It's your boy Kasinova
In the house with Mr Bo'z
P-Funk
