Peace Chuck
First of all, I'm sure u know how highly respected & loved u r by me so your letter definitely warmed my heart. I was also touched by your offer and show of support. It will not go unnoticed. Thankx! It was good 2 hear how well u are doing but hey it's only right. Back in the dayz, on tour with u I learned so much from what u did and how u did it. It may be hard 2 c but u have alwayz played a major role in what it is I do 2day. I have a program I want 2 put together and I would like 4 u 2 be a part of it. I'll explain it 2 u in detail on another occassion. I also have a part 4 u in this movie if u R willing and push my luck even more. I would be honored if u would appear on this track 4 my next album "Euthanasia". The track is called "Da Struggle Continuez". It will also feature Sista Soljah if God wills. So let me know. I just received word that my bail pending appeal has been granted so I should be free by the time u receive this. I'll include a number of my assistant until I get settled. I just signed 2 Deathrow so I should be working on this album soon. Thanx again Chuck! I do believe we can make a difference and I have every intention of doing just that. STAY STRONG! Keep me in your heart and let'z continue to inspire stiff resistance. I remain

Eternal

Da Struggle Continuez!
