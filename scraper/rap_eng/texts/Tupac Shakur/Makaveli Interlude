[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I want money in large amounts, my garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major ways cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em wary
Why you frontin' like you Billy bad-ass, nigga you scary
I've been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers, in junior high
I was itchin' to kill, and you was, ready to die
While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'mma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga it's how it is
Homey got into a fight last night, that killed his kids

[Hook: 2Pac]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's make my enemies bleed
When you see me nigga holla my set, and watch 'em ride
Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die, in this life I lead
Fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's make my enemies bleed...
When you see me nigga holla my set, and watch 'em ride
Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die, in this life I lead
