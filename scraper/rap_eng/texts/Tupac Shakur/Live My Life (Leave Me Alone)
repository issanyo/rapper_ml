[Intro: Cam'ron]
Niggas be on, point, game tight
(Uh, Killa, Killa, uh)
Thug niggas be on point, game tight
Thug niggas be on point, game tight
(Harlem, Harlem, R-O-C)
Thug niggas be on point, game tight
Thug niggas be on point, game tight
(Uh, we gon' set this bitch off
My ambitionz as a killer, yo)
HUH.. Yo

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Soon as I get here niggas wanna wrap the Roc up
Nah, bag, slab, wrap the rocks up, gats, back the block up
Cop killers, clap at coppers, blast at choppers
Pass the vodka (vodka)
Listen, don't ever mention Dash or Hoffa
It's a Harlem thing dog, you'll clash with mobsters (Uptown)
Remember me? Got jumped on TNT (what's beef?)
Next week, back pump TNT (what's beef?)
All my niggas got M-16's kid
And all we do is watch MTV Cribs (why?)
Learn not to in fury the victim
Purially stick 'em, break down your security system, Killa
Stop frontin, you was never a menace
Never a hustler, NO, we could never do business
Business is business, money is money
Hustle is hustle, stupid is stupid
You the dumbest of dummies, Killa

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Leave me alone, let me just live my life, life
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life, life
That's the sound of the police

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
All I do every day dog, blunt after blunt
Stunt after stunt, they all cunt after cunt
Like that I'm shiesty, "look at his shoes", like my Nikes
Know I got a girl, like my wifey, like that I'm rude
Come here, let me pick with your chest, dick on your breast
All they say "That nigga's a mess"
You heard me fam? All worthy of this dirty man
Take it in your ass? How about 30 grams, ma? (huh)
Go upstate, come back downstate
Next time around me, you might get a pound cake (do that)
Fuck it up, she understand that I might slap her (slap her)
I'll be damned if I work for some white cracker (shit)
White batter, prize in the pack, fiends hug it
They love it, call it Cracker Jack, Killa
Where the crack is at, watch me get them dice
Throw 'em hard, let me live my life, Killa

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Leave me alone, let me just live my life, life
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life, life
That's the sound of the police

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Yo, fuck this life as a rap star, you dealing with crack Gods (Gods)
Cooking the crack hard, lead the crack jars
All of the chips, the crib with the backyard (yard)
Pull out the gat pa, a block of black cars (uh)
And I'm scary with the 5th, compare me to a gift
Yellow diamonds, Canary on my wrist
Dust, juice, get wet up and weighed
That'll be the day, Killa Cam mess up some yay, shit
Thug niggas be on point, game tight (game tight)
Cop a brick and re-up in the same night (uh)
And to get that trife, I flick that knife (knife)
Doggy dog, let me live my life, Killa

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Leave me alone, let me just live my life, life
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life, life
That's the sound of the police

[Outro: Cam'ron]
The block is hot, niggas tellin me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest (Killa, Killa)
