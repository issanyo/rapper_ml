Sway: Hey Pac, why don't you talk about the project you are doing with Jodeci right now.

2Pac: "How Do you Want It." My next single is gonna be "How Do You Want It," "Amerikka’s Most Wanted," "Hit 'Em Up" and "California Love," the version people couldn't buy. "Hit ’Em Up" is a song which is a classic hip hop record, meaning it's a straight battle record to all the Bad Boy staff. It's to Puffy, to Biggie to Lil Kim, to all of them.

My little homies is attacking them. That's why I'm not even addressing the Mobb Deep issue. They're not even on my level. I find it disrespectful that they would even think they can attack me or the West Coast. So I don't even address those busta ass fakes. Please print that. It is on and poppin'. If you don’t see me rushin’ them that means it's cause they bowed down. Those Mobb Deep fools they don’t want it. Chino XL, Mobb Deep , Bad Boy, Biggie , Lil Ceasar, Junior Mafia, all of them is on our hit list and I'm getting with them with my new click called The Outlaws. They're some Jersey dudes who are keeping that east coast flava poppin'. It’s some west coast dudes, southern dudes... It's the epitome of what I represent. You know how I mean?
