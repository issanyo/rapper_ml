[Hook]
Everybody's got the answer
Yet the question still remains, yea
Do you see the difference
Or is the problem still the same
All by my self
All by my self
All by my self
All by my self

[Verse 1]
How many nights I had a dream about me waking up
Up on the other side I'll see you when we making up
Then I open up my eyes back to reality
And realize they've stripped away all my humanity
Nobody there to love me
No power from up above me
They were trying to say I was guilty
Never needed man to trust me
Only god can judge me
He’s the only one to have mercy
When I didn’t think I’d live another day
Now I sit and reminisce on how I stood alone
Nothing to call my own
No baby girl to hold me
Nobody to console me
They tried to make me guilty
But only God can judge me

[Repeat Hook]

[2 Pac Verse 2]
It ain't easy bein me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasin me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to what you do and keep the game up
Cause thangs change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wantin more
Every day is a test yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin with every breath
I sit alone in my room drinking (Yeah!)
Talking out loud to you (Yeah!)
Wonder if you feel me (Yeah!)
But far away can you hear me?

[Repeat Hook]

[Jah Cure Verse 3]
So many days I had a vision of me breaking out
But I decided to be strong and just wait it out
Even though I had my ways behind the prison walls
I couldn’t get my calling time I was away from Y'all
I've forgiven everybody
For trying to rise up against me
They were saying they didn’t believe me
Never needed man to trust me
Only god can judge me
He's the only one to have mercy
When I didn’t think I’d live another day
Now I sit and reminisce on how I stood alone
Nothing to call my own
No baby girl to hold me
Nobody to console me
They tried to make me guilty
Only God can judge me

[Repeat Hook]

The race is not given to the swift
Or the battle to the strong
But time and chance happen to the morning

But only God can judge me!
