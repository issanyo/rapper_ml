[Intro: 2Pac]
The secrets of war
Get your pen and pads out you little young asses
I got the secret to war
I got the secret to war
I got the secret to war (get paid!)
God damn, let's give these niggas the secrets and rules

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Rule one, get your cash on (get paid, nigga)
Rule two, watch ya family (fuck friends, nigga!)
Rule three, click clack, stay strapped
Keep ya hands on your gat
And if not then it's rat-a-tat-tat-tat
Rule one, get your cash on (get paid, nigga)
Rule two, watch ya family (fuck friends, nigga!)
Rule three, click clack, stay strapped
Keep ya hands on your gat
And if not then it's rat-a-tat-tat-tat

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, as I approach the scene
From smoking green, got my eyes closed
Niggas I call 'em my foes, I make 'em die, froze
Watch me make them bleed, makin' G's, Lord help me with it
Got me panting pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
See me  and pray for options, when the pressure's non-stop
Niggas get to pistol poppin', then watch his body drop
I'm a lethal weapon, watch me hit yo set, flash on
Blast on them bitch-made niggas with my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' West Side, you can get the fuck on
I'm seeing demons hittin' weed, got me hearing screams
Scared to go to sleep, I bust the scene like a dope fiend
Probably be punished for it, although you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas past the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for, I got the secrets to war

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Rule one, get your cash on (get paid, nigga)
Rule two, watch ya family (fuck friends, nigga!)
Rule three, click clack, stay strapped
Keep ya hands on your gat
And if not then it's rat-a-tat-tat-tat
Rule one, get your cash on (get paid, nigga)
Rule two, watch ya family (fuck friends, nigga!)
Rule three, click clack, stay strapped
Keep ya hands on your gat
And if not then it's rat-a-tat-tat-tat
Rule one, get your cash on (get paid, nigga)
Rule two, watch ya family (fuck friends, nigga!)
Rule three, click clack, stay strapped
Keep ya hands on your gat
And if not then it's rat-a-tat-tat-tat
Rule one, get your cash on (get paid, nigga)
Rule two, watch ya family (fuck friends, nigga!)
Rule three, click clack, stay strapped
Keep ya hands on your gat
And if not then it's rat-a-tat-tat-tat
