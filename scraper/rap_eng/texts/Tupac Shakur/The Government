[Intro]
Damn son, Niggas stay doing it to us son
You gone son, Niggas think its a coincidence
Niggas be stopping us before we even get started
This is under attack baby, we going to ride though, watch us son

[Hook]-2pac X2
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse


[unknown rapper]
Yo uh yea, see the lying in my eyes when I'm coming for the get back
Big mac, cock gunfire, hot tires they burning, they got us all dying and burning
They lying to destroy our earth, little birth diseases
30 millionth church for Jesus
And still our young eating out cans
Chiefing grams and weapons, I sold my first swam at seven
A smidget after first grade, shirt sprayed with talents
You made us hurt making the balance
Instead of preaching violence and fear
Silenced shares we moving, The evil go ahead a movement
Or share me the spiritual form, hear us form rebellion
We gathered up the strong and felons
The youth and all the poverty strain and were all the poverty dwelling
The story that the pottery telling
You find all in potter's field or the government files

[Hook]-2pac X4


[Verse 2]-2Pac
Dave Duke sure look cute in that black suit Oooohhh
But even cuter behind the barrel of my six shooter ooh
You look worried cause I ain't buried
Punks leave in a hurry cause I throw flurries making mothafuckas, scurry
Come feel the flavor from my single
And brain cell's tingle I'm feeling stronger than a fuckin mad Dingo
And uh How's that for black history?
I stay strapped, and love to jack those that slang that crack misery Ha
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas
But how could you love niggas if you trying drug niggas?
You motherfuckas need your caps peeled
Cause when blacks kill blacks we stay trapped and thats, real
And we don't need no more statistic's
It's time to get more realistic for the young the black and the gifted
And uh
Until my people get uplifted
There's no popping shit, just popping clips instead of marching we gon' rip
Shit

[Hook]-2pac X4

[Unkown Rapper please figure out RG]verse 3
Yo whoever shot 2Pac amaru shakur
Will forever be a dead man laying on the floor
Revolutionary thug shit dieing for every young poor black mother in the middle of the ghetto
We never had a chance to appreciate life
The government got a plan to eliminate the life
Of every black soul on the slavery land
And oppositions we abolishing a slavery plan, pay attention every serious political band
Got a division full of killers imperial scams
They wanna kill us all off and incarcerate the family of anyone opposing the war
They want us all to appreciate death and believe up in the white god praying to the heavens above
Ima never let a devil come separate the adamic covenant, The potter's field criminals coming for the government
