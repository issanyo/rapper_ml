[Verse1: 2Pac]
Now I can make it happen My rappin' is similar to muthafuckers
When they scrappin' Blast and watch em' back up Notorious biggie killer
Affiliation with death row Niggas get their caps pealed back
Fool this the west coast
Fuck a misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks
That thought I quit Then got a drop top jagfor these bitches
That's on my dick Go to a club in a pack
I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip
Cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga
With love niggas
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines
Writing raps and movies
I went from trustin'' these tricks
Now they all want to sue me So
Fuck em' all

[Verse2: Ely Shah]
Don't call me rabbit, its not ma habbit, don't call me like he
Ely has his own modafaking identity
Swear to God, its ma call, ma words will never faded
To see some eyes to shine more wanna see some haters
We breaking up in the back in town we waking up when we come around
No body speaks no body will when ely shah gonna rap this sound
Now take this down
Slow it down
Take a deep breadth see what you found
Its not so much surprising bitch
I am the only one having this crown
These rappers cannot handle me
They spend more money but can't be me
Bitch ain't got those nuts what to show
These chicki boys can not fuck with me
Dont fuck with me you know ma style
I party hard and smoke meanwhile
I am a demon baby as you know
You loosers can not pick my fire

[Verse3: Hunz Peepz]
I got glad bags with enemies
Cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessey So they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar I'll dick em' and holla
Ridin' these hoochies Like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For the profit pick my Glock up I'm bustin' in self defense
Ya see Poppin' nobody got em' Holla
Outlaw riders
Mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene Count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers The swat team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy Why? Cause they'll never stop us
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger
Bust some body in the movie
Now I want to do it too
Ohh, ohh niggas is too through
True to the game I claim Outlaw riders
We give a fuck what they try I'm...
Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain
Kick back lil nigga And watch the game
