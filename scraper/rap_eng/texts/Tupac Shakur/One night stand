('cuz I know I'm son of the survivor -vivor -vivor...)
Get up and wash my ass and damn, she was just another One Night Stand
For big dick daddy, 'case you heard
'cuz she was just another One Night Stand, 'cuz she was just another one
Get up and wash my ass and damn, she was just another One Night Stand
For big dick daddy, 'case you heard
'cuz she was just another One Night Stand. 'cuz she was just another one
Get up and wash my ass and damn, she was just another One Night Stand
For big dick daddy, 'case you heard

Remember when you're all alone, my cellular phone
Was turned off, smokin' burners with my dogs, and it's all good baby
Everyone who steal the flow, all y'all some hoes
Shermed out, let's make some mo' money
I'm kinda hungry, it's all good, haters
I don't wanna rock 'em if they study another Bone role
Will they do the run in when their comin', when I'm rollin' in my home
A son of a bitch, I gotta cough, cough in the summer
Love of thug nigga, from my calico, I felt I was losin' my mind
There was some other kind, really wanna smoke the weed, after you swallow me
And try not to follow me, blind, find me 69
Real lit, smokin', the finest vintage wine, talkin' bout time with me
And you wanna to be something, more than just a dime to me

The bitch can cut me, fuck my homies
Be a dyke and spike my Hennessy
Have babies by one of my enemies (then, then)
Come and pretend she wanna be grinned
They probably, wanna send me to the end of the cliff
Inherit all of my chips and then go spend it with another nigga
Well, in my shit and lickin' my lick, nobody does it better than the Rip
That's the shit, welcome the widow, keeping the pistol grip
Under my pillow, well, when you peep out the window, it's so cold
Get in 'fore the wind blow
No hoes allowed -lowed -lowed. Get in 'fore the wind blow
No hoes allowed, no hoes allowed, no hoes allowed
That bitch can cluck and fuck my homies
Be a dyke and spike my Hennessy
Have babies by one of my enemies, then, then, then
Man the chicks can cut me, fuck my homies
Be a dyke and spike my Hennessy
Have babies by one of my enemies, then, then, then, then, then

I woke up early in the mornin' with my Glock, you're fine, yawnin'
Smellin' like last night's Hen, 'til the crack of dawn we get it on
Then again, nigga reel it down from me, just 'cuz we're T-H-U-Gs
But the money was abundant, start up my family tree
Eager to move, we live and we die in Cleveland
That same week or sell speakers
Bid for insurance, and that ass won't free my people with warrants
Over there, come call us, all this over a hoe
My homeboy has no dough and wants to force it, let me know
What a crazy ass life, play me right, don't play me twice
Damn, I'm a grown man, getting in big fights, It'd be nice to settle down
Yeah right, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Man, a bitch can't cut me
Fuck my homies, homies, homies, homies (I'm still high)
And be a dyke and spike my Hennessey, then, then, then (it's all right.)
Have babies by one of my enemies
Have babies by one of my enemies (I'm still high)
Phone jury, call the police, they can never hold me. (I'm still high)
Eventually, you're gonna remember me
