[Intro: Makaveli/Outlawz]
Well goddamn let's give these niggas
The secrets and the rules since these muthafuckaz, are fuckin'
Outlawz in this muthafuckin'
Mojo no go
Hm, uhgagaga
Secretz of war

Alright now
You know what time it is (Spice 1, ehhh yoooooooo)

Put your hands on ya, hands on ya
(bust if we must and plus)
Outlawz in this muthafucka
(bust if we must and plus)
Fatal

[Verse 1: Hussein Fatal]
There go my enemies, my heart beat, pump with ease
So I bust instead of waiting for you punks to squeeze
Give you all of my 3 pound rounds, so you can fall
Bit the fact that Outlawz just kicked down your door
Bitch niggas be fouling out, hacking me with them wack rhymes
Grabbing ya .9, shooting scared, tryin' to take mine
I'm putting pressure on you niggas when I mobb
Deep bringing the heat to your dirty ass squad
You can ride, point blank range, peep game
From the [?], contaminated criminal Hussein
Bitch nigga I'm caught at project steps with the Tec
Murder next, and rob any nigga any set
Hussein, the type of muthafucka dying with trey pounds
Ghetto types we drown, hollow points from the waist down

[Hook]
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Now, as I approach the scene, from smoking green, got my eyes closed
Niggas I call 'em my foes, I make 'em die froze
Watch me make 'em bleed, makin' G's, Lord help me with it
Got me painting pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
See me and pray for oxygen, but the pressure's non stop
Niggas get to pistol poppin', then watch the body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit yo set, flash on
Blast on them bitch made niggas with my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seeing demons hittin' weed, got me hearing screams
Scared to go to sleep, I watch the scene like a dope fiend
Probably be punished for it, although you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas past the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for, I got the secrets of war

[Hook]
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us

[Verse 3: Kadafi]
Kadafi, we do this thug life shit like 4 5 6 dick 'em
Down with no rounds left up in the pound when it sounds
Squeeze the lead off!, I blow his motherfuckin' head off!
Signal all the other Outlawz, as soon as shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain’t a cop here to stop me
These streets is black Hockey, your MOB? weak and sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass pre-style grammar
Locked in the slammer while I’m layed cocked cocked back like a hammer
Y'all newly wed’s throwing honeymoons, well times about up
Dummys I Leave no trace found with you face down stuck
Your biggest cannons couldn’t come close to touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt puttin' in work on your block tipsy

[Hook]
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Check the murder rate percentage, niggas is finished
Getting blood checks from clinics, this thug shit is in us
Flowing through my system, you a victim, blunts.. I twist them
Fuck the whole world it’s us against them
You got the heat? Pull it out, and cock the hammer if you with it
Don’t make no difference here, with a 25-to-Life sentence
We already doing life on the street, like Al G
Niggas be heated when they walking the beat
This shit is Flakey, making fags shaky, Niggas hate me
Scared to face me, knowing that the Outlawz raised me!
Put me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I flex my money muscle, all the cheese got doubled
Moving shit like a dolly, beating niggas like Rodney
Turn a killa like Gaddafi if the new street is [?]

[Hook]
We go to war we bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us
