Chorus: Erik Turner
I've come so far, ain't got so far to go
Lonely days on this lonely road
In the ghetto or the barrio
You know it's all the same
One home
One dream
Same struggle
Same hustle

[Erik Turner (2Pac in background)]
One hood
One, one, one
One hood
One, one-one, one
One hood
One hood (Down with my homeboy, Down...)

(Verse 1)
[2Pac (Erik Turner in background)]
Poppa need brand new shoes
But what the fuck can a nigga do
My little boy gotta eat, too
So why must I sock a fella (Oooh, yeah)
Just to live large like Rockefeller
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war
But I ain't old enough to drink (Hey)
Cops wanna hit me with the book
Huh (Come on)
And you're hooked on my "I Don't Give a Fuck" look
Hmm
Make your rules, I'm a break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em
You show me bacon, I'm a take 'em
So don't you ever tempt me
I'm a fool for mine, nigga, and my pockets stay
Empty

[Down (Erik Turner in background) {Down *slowed down*}]
Three families in one house
Is how some of the brown gotta get down (Gotta get down)
It's got me acting like a lunatic (Lunatic)
Thinkin' that the only option is hit a lick (Is hit a lick)
As I roll down Cooper Road
In a six-four {Drop it real low} (Real low)
One time, on the hustle, I drive slow (Drive slow)
Thinkin' my pops runnin' from the border patrol (Hey)
They wanna take us all out the game
Taking drugs for the pain
Or taking one to the brain
It's all the same
We all want money like Lil' Wayne
How many of us really ever Make It Reign/rain

Repeat Chorus

[Erik Turner]
One hood
One, one, one
One hood (It's all the same)
One, one-one, one
One hood
One, one, one
One hood
One-one-one-one
One-one, one (One...)

(Verse 2)
(Erik Turner in background)
[2Pac] To my brothers in the barrio
You're livin' worse than the niggas in the ghetto, so
[Erik] Mmm, hmm
[2Pac] I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggas in my section
[Down] En mi barrio
It's all good
We bump 2Pac, cause it's all one hood (One-one, one, one...)
We all runnin' from the same jura (Same jura)
So why we killing each other with the same damn fusca
[2Pac] You got problems with the punk police
Don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me (Get it from me)
[Down] Hail Mary, always got my momma prayin' for me
I'm goin' loco, hopin' there's a heaven for a G
[2Pac] And you wonder why we blazin', niggas
Cause you punks havin' babies can't raise the niggas
[Down] And that's why
Always hold down mi familia
I love them like Pac love (???)

Repeat Chorus

[Erik Turner]
One hood
One, one, one
One hood
One, one-one, one
One hood
One, one, one
One hood
One-one-one-one
One-one, one (One...)
One hood
One, one, one
One hood
One, one-one, one
One hood
One, one, one
One hood
One-one-one-one
One-one, one (One...)
One hood

[Erik]    One, one, one (One...)
[Fingazz] "Fi-fi-fi-Fingazz on the track..."
[Erik]    One hood
One, one, one
[2Pac]    Down with my homeboy, Down
[Erik]    One hood
One, one, one
[2Pac]    Down with my homeboy, Down
