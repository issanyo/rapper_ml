[Intro: 2Pac]
Something for my niggas to ride to
Something to keep your confidence up
Something to get your money by
Hey, yo this going out to Mu grandmother
Definitely going out to Mu's grandmother
One love, rest in peace, let the angels take you
One love

[Verse: 2Pac]
Ain't nothin' wrong with a nigga gettin' his papers
Don't hate us, listen to the song
Still waitin' on the world to come save us
How they made us, every time it's on
No matter who did it they blame us, they hate us
Gotta be strong, no matter what they do they can't break us
They hate us
Ain't nothin' wrong with a nigga gettin' his papers
Don't hate us, listen to the song
Still waitin' on the world to come save us
How they made us, every time it's on
No matter who did it they blame us, they hate us
Gotta be strong, no matter what they do they can't break us
Cuz they hate us

Verse continues to repeat throughout song
