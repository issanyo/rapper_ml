[Verse 1]
When I was comin' up rough, wasn't even what you callin'
That's why I smoke blunts now, and run with alcoholics
That will explain the way I came, here we go
Just give me my dough and do the show then I'm outtie yo!
Runnin' in the back seat, sippin' on the Guinness
Fuckin' with a MAC-10 ready to be a menace
Time to hit the projects that's where the ballers dwell
Fifty niggas mad deep, some [?] as well
I got my pager and my razor and a 'nuff [?], a ruff crew
In case a motherfucka wanna bust through
I'm rollin' through the projects loc'd, where they at, where they at, there they go
Them bitch ass niggas hold down the block
The one that told  the cops I gotta Glock
Ay yo it don't stop - pop pop pop
And hit the pedal, one less motherfucker in the ghetto
That's how we do it in the Oaktown, G
Fuck around and get smoked down, see
Niggas on my tail so I'm ghost
One way ticket to the East Coast
This kid was loose and unmajor
Woudn't hesitate to blaze ya

[Refrain]
The hell raiser
Hahaha
The hell raiser

[Verse 2]
Strapped with gats at a young age
Gotta hole of a gauge, and make a motherfucker front page
High attack to the block like a cop
Hopin' open operation slangin' rocks
First I gotta get a crew full of hustlers
And fuck motherfuckers, them niggas can't touch us
And now we gotta problem come , you know my ammo
Dead bodies fillin' the Bronx
The other dealers wanna do me , I'm popular
Got the Glock cocked , sucker don't jack me up
Fuck a drive by, nigga take dead aim
Load him up on a frame and knock his ass out the game
Boom boom! was the headlines
Young nigga turn killa if the deadline
Team tucked was some niggas from Queens
Now we're the loudest motherfuckers on the scene
Gettin' paids at a mad rate
Runnin' up on the face
And hit the snakes in a bad way
Them niggas don't wanna, stack
Fuck around and breathe your last breath
Run on me or get your ass capped
With a 12 gauge blast to your back
I'm not your average nigga, untouched
Shootin' motherfuckers within ruff

[Refrain]
The hell raiser
The hell raiser

[Verse 3]
Everybody freeze, niggas on they knees , hush
First nigga talk and I bust , trust
Run up on your stupid ass , gimme that
Peelin' caps back quicker than a snap from my jimmy hat
Picture that now, picture this I'm on foot now
Runnin' through the streets with my hit list
Pistol cockin' and jackin' them bustas
Niggas want funk but the punks can't touch us
And now they got me trapped better kill me
Payback's a motherfucker, nigga feel me?
We runnin' on the niggas in the dark
With fully automatic to they heart (pull the shit motherfucker)
This is where the punch starts nigga wasn't checkin'
Quicker hear me steppin' until I start lettin' off my weapon (buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
The shit I heard em niggas screamin' no but they wasn't screamin' no before (no, no!)
Now them niggas, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go go
Hit the floor and feel the fury of my 44
Them niggas I don't trust tryna bust me
Buck buck double line in your guts G
And when I die there'll be another hell raiser crazy motherfucker
I came up with my criminal behavior, wouldn't hesitate to blaze ya

[Outro + Refrain]
The hell raiser (I see you all motherfuckers now)
(bitch ass motherfuckers)
(you love to point your fuckin' finger huh)
The hell raiser
The hell raiser
The hell raiser
