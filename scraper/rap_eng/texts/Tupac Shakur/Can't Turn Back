[Verse 1: 2Pac]
It seems I can't turn back, I'm walkin' 'round strapped
Can't sleep, my enemies want me gat
Call my mama and they scream drama (Kill you bitch!)
Could it be they don't know that they fuckin' wit a G? (Rat-a-tat)
I'm goin' to sleep but with my eyes open
I'm gettin' high and I pray that when I go, I can die smokin'
Go to the funeral, my homie's dead, he passed away
Got caught up in the wrong place, got blasted, hey
It's just anotha part of bein' black
It ain't no thang, but if you slang then you better watch yo back
'Cause these motherfuckers love to see you gone
You gotta stay strong, young brother, 'cause it's on
And I'll be slangin' these thangs till the break of dawn
Gotta make my ends, then it's time to take it home
I got some hoochies on my pager, it's major
Let me play her like a game of fuckin'  SEGA
(Beep Beep) It's time to wake up, 2 in the mornin'
You gotta leave, gots to sleep by myself, Cause I'm a G
It's time to say goodbye, I gots to get my strap
I was raised in the gutter now I can't turn back, haha

[Chorus: 2Pac]
It seems I can't turn back (I can't turn back)
They want me to change
And now I can't turn back (I know y'all looking at me crazy but uh)
It seems I can't turn back
They want me to change
But now, I can't turn back

[Verse 2: Young AKayser (of Blackjack)]
I got 30 homies dirty mackin', jealous 'cause I'm stackin'
I stay tackin', packin' heat in case these niggas get to actin'
Too sheisty, shorty y'all get foggy and wanna leak
Or get restless tryna test this, get they ass put to sleep (pow)
I'm playin' for keeps, and if a life ain't no turnin' back
I'ma keep hustlin' as long as dope fiends keep burnin' crack
No love for these bitches 'cause when you down and out, they backs turn
Now dig em and ditch em, be about my riches, sip my liquor and let my sack burn
Can't let these funky cock hoes destroy me
Only quality time I'm spending is on these blocks that employ me
These punk-ass cops annoy me, playa hatin' on my cash got
Me bailin' through them gusto throwin' my sack and strappin' the stash box
Tryin' to crash my spot, tryin' to stop a nigga from earnin' stacks
To hustle's all I know so it ain't really no turnin' back

[Chorus : 2Pac]
I can't turn back
They sayin' I'm crazy
I can't turn back
I won't quit
I can't turn back
They want me to stop
But yo, I can't turn back

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
Comin' up off a clip, So nigga don't trip, It's the S-P-I
When I step onto ya shit, nigga, ya quick to die
So take this slug to ya chest 'cause then I'm turnin' back
Reason the ghetto smoke a motherfucker slangin' crack
I put my finger on trigger and he was fro'd up
He was the key to me gettin' my spizzot sowed up
So now I'm runnin' like a motherfuckin' fugitive
And all I carry is memories of how I used to live

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Every time I wake up, I hit the floor and thank the lord
I don't know what I'm livin' for, I'm runnin' out the back door
Ain't nothin' nice in my life, I ask my nigga Spice
(What's up, nigga) Don't wanna die, am I livin' right?
I hit the corner smokin' weed, drinkin' Hennessy
Will I be sober enough to see my enemies?
And if I do, will I empty my clip or will I trip?
'Cause I ain't givin' up for shit, I can't turn back

[Chorus: 2Pac]
I can't turn back
They want me to quit
But yo, I can't turn back
They sayin' I'm crazy
I can't turn back
They want me to quit
But yo, I can't turn back
I can't turn back
They want me to quit
But yo, I can't turn back
I'm still thuggin'
I can't turn back
They want me to quit
But yo, I can't turn back
