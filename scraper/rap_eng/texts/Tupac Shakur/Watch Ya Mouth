[Intro: Makaveli]
Let this be my motherfuckin' reply to that little bitch [?]
(Make sure you bring it 'Pac)
Around the way type shit
(Yo 'Pac do that shit Westside style)
All them little hidden words in your raps
All them mixtapes y'all droppin'
Make sure you bring it
Trying to get with me
Bring it live nigga worldwide feel it!
(Don’t forget to talk)

[Verse 1]
You heard it wrong nigga
Ain’t nothing sweet about my techniques
You checking for my breathless quotes I wrote deadly
My history so thoroughly involves destruction
Niggas left with their ass bleeding, lyrical fucking (wooahh)
Open up, first to bust, let me see your heart
Turn the lights down 'cause I might clown in the dark
When I check for the Heartz of Men what do we find?
Niggas watching for my pockets, planning plots on mine
Am I blind
Let my rhymes speak for me in history
A legend you define me
Don Makaveli bitch bow down to Death Row
Fuck what you say we untouchable
Now that we done shook Doc Dre
He ain’t made a beat in six years, swear he the shit
Won’t get no record sales sucking Nas' dick
Let me get my preach on, nigga drop the beat, I get my freak on
The wrong one for you to speak on
Motherfucker watch your mouth

[Hook]
Come on, come on
Live like this nigga
Come on, come on
Silly nigga
Watch ya mouth
Stick and move
Stick and move
Bring the muthafuckin' hands
Bring the heat
Bring the funk
Eh yo 'Pac swing on that trick nigga
Let's do it

[Verse 2]
Look I heard Nas got beef 'cause I’m dissing his clique
Cool (skinny nigga) come bring your ass nigga you can get dissed
I'm worldwide steady war rapping
Get your cash on nigga, five times platinum (how many you sold?)
What’s that
De-La got a problem with this hard shit
Ever since "Me myself and I" y'all been garbage
(you know I'm tellin' the truth)
I’ma keep it real, show you how it feels to ride
Y’all went three feet and stopped rising (I ain't seen shit)
Wendy Williams is a fat bitch, that’s the truth
I got a jar full of niggas nuts (slurp, slurp), that’s for you
Let the Westside-Eastside drama cease
I’ll come alone to your own streets, Outlaw
Prepare for panic when I unleash
Niggas is lucky if they leave here in one piece
(watch your muthafuckin')
Cream Puff never had no heart to start
So how the hell Biggie Smalls get the part
Watch your mouth

[Hook]
Don Makaveli
Stick and move
Stick and move
Killuminati style, nigga
Keep your muthafuckin' hands up
Killuminati style
Yea, we gonna do this for awhile
I got a lot of shit
You know how we do it
Killuminati
Let's do this nigga

[Verse 3]
What I bring to you is hardcore
The very essence of my poetry
Dyslexic so you backward ass niggas will know it's me
The only G to bleed for the shit I bring
And swing hard on motherfuckers that’s my thing
Vocally I’m pure so you O.D. trying to throw me
Don’t get your life took trying to run with your homies
Y’all know me, same nigga so quick to blast
On this worldwide mash trying to get some cash
Holla, my name and the game will follow
Wait and I’ll murder these snakes tomorrow
Bunch of washed up jealous-ass punks though
Quit bullshitting 'Pac, flip the funk mode
Makaveli rise, all you niggas die when I come
I’ll do some fly shit and be done
They say 'Pac ain’t got love for the Eastside
You's a lying motherfucker, nigga we ride
Watch your mouth

[Outro]
Love that shit! I love that thug shit!
I wrote this for my niggas on the East side
(I love that thug shit)
I wrote this for my niggas on the West side
(how I love that thug shit)
I wrote this for my niggas on the East side
(put your hands on it)
I wrote this for my niggas on the West side
(hands on ya heat)
All my niggas in the north run, run with me
(all the niggas in the streets)
All my niggas in the north run, run with me
(hands on ya heat)
For my niggas down south, now get with me
For my niggas down south, now get with me
For my niggas on the east side, east side
(fly, fly bitches, out there)
For my niggas on the west side, west side
(fly, fly bitches)
For my niggas up north of course
(fly, fly bitches)
For my niggas up north of course
(fly if you out there)
For my niggas down south no doubt
(if you out there)
For my niggas down south no doubt
(the bitches is bomb)
For my niggas on the east side, east side
(fly niggas, fly niggas)
For my niggas on the west side, west side
(fly niggas, getting by)
For my niggas up north of course
(fly bitches, fly bitches)
For my niggas up north of course
(fly and getting high)
For my niggas down south no doubt
For my niggas down south no doubt
Come on
My dream is to see real niggas and real bitches
Get to together and have real kids and have a real
Life and get real money
Come on, uh
My problem: Fake niggas always
Tryin' to interrupt the conversation
Come on, uh
The solution: Multiple guns, ammunition
Come on, yea
And game type mobsters
What you’ll find, always rough rugged and raw
Come on, yea
Outlaw. West side. Death Row. Thug life
Dre can’t fuck with this, uh
Yea, you know my trial
To live and die In L.A
To live in and die in L.A
They say Dre can’t fuck with this, heyyeyeyeyeye
Uh, Dre can’t fuck with this, heyeheye
Hahahahahahaa
Yea nigga, the prodigal son
Ya this might have been your muthafuckin' record label
When you was here, nigga
When you see where you at, and you see where the fuck I’m at, nigga
Westside. Death Row the Untouchable style, nigga
I took your shit, you bitch made nigga
You up out of this shit, nigga
You got erased nigga
You know the muthafuckin' history
M.O.B. nigga, mob style
We don’t like your trick ass
You up out of here, nigga
By murder, or by hardcore styles
It took hardcore styles for your ass to walk
You walkin' nigga
You don’t even come out no more
'Cause you know what time it is
Don’t even front muthafucka
You think by getting with my enemy
That will get you some love with my heart, nigga?
FUCK YOU
