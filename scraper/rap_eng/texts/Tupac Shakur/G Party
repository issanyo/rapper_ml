[Verse 1]
Got my mind on it, waiting for the death of a rap-poet
I got no problems with that, I got my cap folded
Twisin' the cap on my yak, these niggas can't ignore it
So now I'm tipsy and strapped, you think I won't pull it
Brain like a silver bullet
A mastermind with every rhyme so all you niggas feel it
And everytime I'm on my my grind I got the money peeling (ching ching)
I'm stacking nothing but the green until it hits the ceiling
I'm breaking all you bitches down into perfect sizes
And when i'm spitting all these rounds let me see you dodge them
And who the fuck you calling clown, trick peep the prophet
As long as I'm breathing I will always be the hottest (you know)
I got some homies on the West-Side with chucks in the rally hard
We're shooting more dirt than a rally car
We smoke the bali then we leave the bar
The presence of a Super-Star
And Cali where his peoples are
(Yay-Yay)


[Chorus (Kasinova Tha Don and Mr Bo'z)]
Yeah
Pour the Hennessy, sip it from the cup (yeah)
Now go on to the dance floor ah (to the dance floor ah)
Now give you two-step (yeah)
Now give you two-step (yeah)
You know i'm rapping P-Funk (rapping P-Funk)
Now wave your hands from right to left if you up in this Gangsta Party
(It's still nothin' but a Gangsta Party)
Look at all these freaks

It's a G Party

[Verse 2]
Raps created and motherfuckers barely made it
I'm easily stated, wanting the best whoever laid it
They feinin' for rated, knowing my lyrics can't be faded
All these cowards is hating but so all fascinated
So homie go figure, fuck hoes, tricks for gold diggers
And I ain't losing Prince for no nigga
You loving Jake cause you couldn't be down, that's what I heard
Motherfuckers is snitching from the ghetto back to the word
Nighmares I shed tears, dreams of plotting schemes
Mothefuckers is dropping when bodies pop up on the murder scene
I drop a dollar watch me holla at hoes
I rip the stage, I'm a ridah, watch the game unfold
I'm a living legend, a born leader in the presence
Let me learn my essence, to leave these motherfuckers guessing
My secret weapon, I bring nothing but rainy days
My adversaries see me, bitches bleed in many ways

[Chorus (Kasinova Tha Don and Mr Bo'z)]
Yeah
Pour the Hennessy, sip it from the cup (yeah)
Now go on to the dance floor ah (to the dance floor ah)
Now give you two-step (yeah)
Now give you two-step (yeah)
You know i'm rapping P-Funk (rapping P-Funk)
Now wave your hands from right to left if you up in this Gangsta Party
