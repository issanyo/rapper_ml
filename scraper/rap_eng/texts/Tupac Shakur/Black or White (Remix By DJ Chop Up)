[Hook x2: Michael Jackson]
If you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're Black or White

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinking of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth
‘cause the truth look strange
‘Cause any day they'll push the button, and all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time and hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined

[Hook x4: Michael Jackson, 2Pac]
If you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're Black or White
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Living out of bags plus she's glad for the little things
She has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's giving birth to a baby
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress, never forget
That God isn't finished with me yet
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets;


[Hook x4: Michael Jackson, 2Pac]
If you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're Black or White
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined

[Outro: Michael Jackson, 2Pac]
It's black, it's white
It don't matter
It's black, it's white
It don't matter
It's black, it's white
It don't matter
It's black, it's white
It don't matter
It's black, it's white
It don't matter (if you're black or white..)
It's black, it's white
It don't matter (if you're black or white..)
It's black, it's white
It don't matter (if you're black or white..)
It's black, it's white
It don't matter (if you're black or white..)
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed and it, hurts..
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed and it, hurts..
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed and it, hurts..
