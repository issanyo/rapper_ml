[Intro: Khayree]
Awhh yeah, break me off some of the real players shit
What's up motherfuckers? This is Khayree
And I posted at this here spot with 2Pac, Mac-Mall, Ray Luv and my nigga Young Lay
Spit that shit...

[Verse 1: Young Lay]
Cuddies perved by the corner, stout, herb
Got me twisted, mo' cold killin murders
Them brothers gettin' further
Got my pencil for utensil, this'll keep they mind knownin'
Spot some thugs at the club, and they got they nines showin'
Dirty pimpin' schemes, one of my dreams, player now listen
Lotta blacks locked down, but comin' back around in '96
All I gots is my six, my track crew and my mother
Make these police wonder how is he so undercover?
Never been a lover, but America had broke my heart
I was told to tear up out this before this tare me apart
Eat through scrap, black tracks, free milk and cheese
While the Japs stack scratch with the Vietnamese
But I'm finna squeeze, stack g's they left on a trap
A young playa mack, hit the bud', spit a rap
It's just that feelin', that feelin' that I have for children
Are able to love us, but these crazy devils try to kill us

[Hook: Mac Mall]
Amerikka Eatz Itz Young, motherfuckers do you feel me?
I'm a young black brother, so these motherfucker fear me
Amerikka Eatz Itz Young, motherfuckers do you feel me?
I'm a young black brother, so these motherfucker fear me

[Verse 2: Ray Luv]
June 2nd '93 I returned to the streets
Did 2 months in the county and I opt to the beat
Now the cops keep watch, cause they know that I rap
Tell the world that I'm a gangsta, cause I ride with a strap
But I ain't yo gangsta, just a young nigga caught up in the struggle
Born hustler, goin' for the jugular
Out to take the beast down, piece down might be too late
The funk is on, high, drunk off Thunderbird and Grape Kool-Aid
Would love to catch a playa slippin', take me down and book me
Guilty as charged, hit the switch and try to cook me
Silence a nigga for the shit I'm spittin', I know I'm scarin' ya
A poison you created in the veins of America
Miseducated, incarcerated, institutionalized
That 3rd strike will have a gang of them rollers dyin'
Ain't no love where I'm goin', no love where I'm comin' from
Remember me, that real-ass nigga you been runnin' from
Got us sprung off the cocaine and the welfare
While the black babies die without health care

[Hook: Mac Mall]
Amerikka Eatz Itz Young, motherfuckers do you feel me?
I'm a young black brother, so these motherfucker fear me
Amerikka Eatz Itz Young, motherfuckers do you feel me?
I'm a young black brother, so these motherfucker fear me

[Verse 3: Mac Mall]
Now how could I pledge allegiance to a racist-ass flag
When the rollers at my do' with a .44 mag?
Got my mother spittin' drag 'bout I ain't home
Got a double homicide warrant on my dome
I hear em pushin' in the do', I grab my Mac with two clips
Cut through the back window and like a g hit a fence
I'm thinkin' 'bout my folks gettin' sent for violation
Foes and punk police, them devils still at my do'
I peep a group of ten tryina get information
I threw the clips in the Mac, start lettin' off frustration
It's better than incarceration any day, we gonn' die anyway
So if I go out blastin', call it my fate
I got niggas in the pen like my cousin Bud
Lunatic Insane, and my partner T-Love
Big Tom, Ray Ray, Killa Cuddy, Mac Dre
Cleek, Jamal, Jinx and Bluebonic, man

[Hook: Mac Mall]
Amerikka Eatz Itz Young, motherfuckers do you feel me?
I'm a young black brother, so these motherfucker fear me
Amerikka Eatz Itz Young, motherfuckers do you feel me?
I'm a young black brother, so these motherfucker fear me

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now I been called a crook, a killer, thug
A no-good dealer of drugs
And Blood or Cuz, doesn't matter what set you was
Cause where I'm at, if you black, we strapped
As long as ki's make g's these thieves attack
And ain't no rules on the streets these days
Muthafuckas better watch they back and take it eazay
I'm livin' in the danger zone
And learnin' lesson from the game, it's on
Niggas was gone when the frame was on
I'm gettin' breakin' them balls daily
Is there a ghetto in heaven or do I go to hell?
See, seems I was sentenced to death, takin' my steps with my head down
Why pour I liquor for my niggas, cause they dead now
My memory since I was a little seed
Was a penitentiary full of niggas like me
These cops can't terrorize us, they despise us
Niggas, cause we on the rise
Plus everybody's searchin' for a piece of the truth
And the youth turn the streets into a piece of Beirut
And the truth is

[Hook: Mac Mall]
Amerikka Eatz Itz Young, motherfuckers do you feel me?
I'm a young black brother, so these motherfuckers fear me
Amerikka Eatz Itz Young, motherfuckers do you feel me?
I'm a young black brother, so these motherfuckers fear me
(Motherfuckers fear me, motherfuckers fear me)

Ya, that's right
Straight up here man
Lets break that shit down one time, playa

[Outro]
Hahaha (Eatz itz young)
They swear they got a nigga on the run
Shit, Long as they make guns motherfucker, here we come
It'S got to be right, it's got to be true in '94
All us niggas want more, you know
It's like we forgettin' what the fuck we fightin' for
(Money is power motherfucker, you know)
And Power is money ain't shit funny when you ain't got none, see cut it's like this
(It's like this, You Motherfucker quick to kill a nigga but you scared to kill a pig)
That's why we gets no respect
Cause motherfuckers can't stack a dollar
We'll jack for a dollar, but we gon smoke that shit up
Niggas can't stack their money
(don't nothin' move but the punch)
(You'll rob a d boy, but you scared to hit a bank motherfucker)
That's why your shit ain't right
Know what I' sayin'
(better get right about your game man)
(right about your motherfuckin' game)
It's like this here
Amerikka what we is, we ain't nothing but food to Amerikka
They chompin' niggas like it's an everyday job, you feel me?
So if you ain't gettin' smart about your motherfuckin' thang
You will be the next motherfuckin' meal, believe me
(about them tryna eat me they gonnaz get a mouth full of Glock motherfucker)
Haha Buck buck
Haha 13 cases and we still can't trade places
We gotta get up out of here
Know I'm sayin, outta here
Ay but it's going down cuz it's '94 you know by 2000 niggas gonna get fed up
