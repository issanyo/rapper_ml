My ambition as a rider
Yeah, it's my ambition as a rider
Yeah, it's my ambition as a rider
Hey, it's my ambition as a rider

[Verse 1]
Rolling, joking, smoking, thinking how I got here
Loccin', loading toasters, pussy you was not there
Holding, never folding, we was on the top tier
Shackled to our ankles it was like a nightmare
You ever wash out your drawers on the same water you shit?
Doing your push ups right on the floor where you piss?
Cellies with niggas that went to war with the strip?
You got to rumble from night time down to the morning and shit
I'm tryna tell them, forever label me felon
Clutchin' that pistol, God made me rebellious
Fuck with them niggas, teach you a lesson
Fingers on triggers, meet Smith and Wesson
I seen pussy niggas turn on me
Throw the money let it burn on 'em
If I feel like he a threat I put a bird on him
And my young hittas will swerve on him

[Hook]
My ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, its my ambition as a rider

[Verse 2]
Money the root of evil, wait 'til them shooters see you
Lurkin in Grand Marquises, scopin' on you, your people
Made a movie with niggas, murder and you the sequel
Bullets gon' riddle you, they gon' use tubes to feed you
Momma gonna pull the plug
Head big as Hey Arnold's is, full of blood
Smell the death in the air when we pullin' up
Bullets go B-B-BRRRR, fill 'em up
Bloody murder hollow tips out the clip
I repent when I murder opposites
Pick and roll, stop and pick
I reload, spin the corner, drop the shit
And we leave no evidence for residents to grieve 'bout
Them sluggies hit you nigga, breathe out
And keep your eyes open 'til you start to wheeze out
We wipe your mothafuckin' team out

[Hook]
My ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, its my ambition as a rider
