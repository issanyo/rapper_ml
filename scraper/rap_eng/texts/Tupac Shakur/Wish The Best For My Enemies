[Intro: 2Pac]
Yeah, BK Brooklyn went massive on the track ya'll
Uh, Makavelli rest in peace, huh Oulawz whaddup
Fatal Hussein, EDI Mean,(Yeah) gorilla gang, bangin' smurf domination
(You KNOW!) Heh, you know how we do it

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn'ta tried me
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces they wrists and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls better, eat a dick BEYOTCH!
Mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
Just sell me your soul, and live the life.. (of a ghetto star)

[Hook]
I wish nothing but the best for my enemies
I know they wanna see me descended n even when im dead
They don't wanna see me in peace
They'd rather see me suffer a lifetime of trice
When I'm gone jealousy is the same old song
I wish nothing but the best for my enemies
I'mma warrior born to survive the struggle
Its a game of tug of war you gotta hustle

[Verse 2: Nutso]
You see the road that I quarrel is long and hard
Physical and mental scars
Wishin' for paradise in a place where I'm against the odds
Rough nights then gun fights had me on the edge of death
But some how some way god chose to spare my breath
When my enemies succeed in my assassination
Thoughts of death is it the future of my imagination
Before they put me in the dirt I'm squeezin' first
Hate to see my mama cry following behind my hearse
Nothin' worse I can't picture myself sayin they shot me
Cause even when I think I'm alone, god got me
Throughout life I learned a lot of valuable lessons
Invest in the future you can't take a fortune in heaven
Friends changed so I walk on my weapons
So let me come for ME
I'm patiently waitin' to put em under me
A ghetto star just trynna live my life comfortably
Bein' harassed and attacked so whatchu want from me

[Hook]

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Check yourself you gotta snatch some collars
And let them motherfuckers know you gonna take them OUT
Anytime YOU feel like it
You gotta get the ground beneath your feet partner
And get the wind behind your back and go out and blaze if you got to
You gotta be ready to throw down, stand up and die for that
Otherwise you ain't shit, you might as well be dead your damn self

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Talkin' to my homies that was worried
See my enemies wanna see me dead I ain't worried forgive me
Please give me shelter, guard my friends
Lift up my head from my hands that are warm with tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed with acid
2 shots ring from the plastic Glock wrapped in plastic
Buried n basted time to notify
His fam wishin', ain't nothin' left to be identified
Evacuate the crime seen fast, Why
Heard the feds that are wanted for my ass, Why
I won't touch down till I see do you wanna
Sell out shops, sellin' em crooked counts marijuana
Label me a success
I made a switch, retired from the life that never gave me shit
Went from cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, live my life as a ghetto star

[Outro]
Yeah man, GF Records man, fire whaddup
Haha my nigga empho lookin for this one ya'll
Gorilla gang man, 2Pac rest in peace man
We got this man, 2004 shit man
This shit from the heart ya'll
Huh, I wish the best for my enemies
Brrrrrraaaaaaaahhhhh
