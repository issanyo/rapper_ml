[Intro: 2Pac]
Alright, I'm ready for this motherfucker..
I guess these motherfuckers wanna take me out the business, right?
I guess I ain't east coast enough for my niggas back in New York, and I ain't west coast for these niggas on the west, huh?
Fuck everybody, haha

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Time to go loc'd out, buck buck!
Motherfucker, blast these sellouts
I raise hell out when they spell out
My name! Two P-A-C
Come look at the way that I drop shit
2Pac is back with Chop, bitch!
Time to go loc'd out, buck buck!
Motherfucker, blast these sellouts
I raise hell out when they spell out
My name! Two P-A-C
Come look at the way that I drop shit
2Pac is back with Chop, bitch!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya holes
I'm gettin' high off buddha cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough, you never find me broke
And who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery, keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep, livin' in these wicked times, peep
Niggas after me cause they see I'm stackin' G's and heat
You can holler if you want to, please
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew, bleed
Enemies and my range is on, you're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, now hotline
You suckers better find ya mind I got mine
From hustlin' and bustin' them rhymes
To my niggas up in Quentin, Down on Riker's Isle
Stay rile, but a nigga gotta use his styles

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Time to go loc'd out, buck buck!
Motherfucker, blast these sellouts

Motherfucker, blast these sellouts
I raise hell out when they spell out

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Could be wrong but I never got along with cops
It's like they stuck from makin' niggas duck from Glocks
And all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rollin' my bucket but I bought me a Benz
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive
I cry, but in my own way, swallow my pride
Pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
Cemetery full of brothers I buried, it's goin' down
Even now I wonder will I still be around
My hometown is the gutter I was born a wild
I came up out this dust with my heartless style

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Time to go loc'd out, buck buck!
Motherfucker, blast these sellouts

Time to go loc'd out, buck buck!
Motherfucker, blast these sellouts
I raise hell out when they spell out

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I remember Uptown, run catch a kiss
Listenin' to Mr. Magic
Cuttin' up the hits And even though I had a habit
Makin' words rhyme I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
And Pete and Lee young G's with a gift of gab
Tryna hook up with the hookers who was quick to stab Remember mama's cookin', no school, straight hookin'
And tryin' to get with light skinned, cause she good lookin'
And jumpin' over turnstiles cause we ain't payin'
Call the cuties cuss words but we only playin'
I'm prayin' I can get a buck, no luck
I had to move around a lot cause my moms was stuck
I had family, but I was way too wild
Had to move to the West to regain my style


[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Time to go loc'd out, buck buck!
Motherfucker, blast these sellouts
I raise hell out when they spell out
My name! Two P-A-C
Come look at the way that I drop shit
2Pac is back with Chop, bitch!
Time to go loc'd out, buck buck!
Motherfucker, blast these sellouts
I raise hell out when they spell out
My name! Two P-A-C
Come look at the way that I drop shit
2Pac is back with Chop, bitch!
Time to go loc'd out, buck buck!
Motherfucker, blast these sellouts
I raise hell out when they spell out
My name! Two P-A-C
Come look at the way that I drop shit
2Pac is back with Chop, bitch!

[Outro: 2Pac]
Yo nigga, man fuck 'Pac that nigga West Coast
That nigga ain't fuckin' with us, always with them New York niggas
Seen them with that nigga man? That nigga ain't from the West Coast
Man fuck 'Pac, fuck that nigga, that nigga ain't really down
Rapin' ass nigga, "I didn't do it", fuck it with that nigga
Fuck that nigga, man, fuck that nigga, Let that nigga go to jail!
And fuck that nigga, fuck that nigga, fuck you too nigga!
