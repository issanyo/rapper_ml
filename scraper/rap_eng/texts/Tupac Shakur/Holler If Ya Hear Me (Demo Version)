[Intro: 2Pac]
Holler if ya hear me
Yeah, it’s on
Muthafucking Live Squad in the house
We gonna set this shit off for these old square ass punk muthafuckers

It’s on, it’s on, it’s on
Holla if ya hear me

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I got a nine thang ready to go BANG BANG!
On the first crooked cop that even comes near me
I beg your pardon, call the guards in, Chief Gates
Can’t wait to see your face, better move to another state
BOOM BOOM, a ballistic slug, we realistic
The 12 gauge will leave you twisted
The government is getting shadier
And therefore, niggas get crazier
Huh, and 5-0 can’t fade the havenots
Shoulda learned when them OGs trashed Watts
Move on, move on, move on
Still wicked, love to kick it, get my groove on
And you can say no to drugs, but you can’t say no to the thugs with slugs
Tell the president it’s evident he's lost
Wouldn’t know a gangbanger from a fucking horse
Rather read The Source, flip through Rap Pages
Black pages, speaking on black rages
We don’t even know the scoop
And the truth is the troops can’t hold the youth
Send em down with they tanks and
AK-47s, what the fuck you niggas drinking?
Now tell me what you’re thinking?
You can roll through the hood and not get a spankin’
Niggas got they strap on
When they pop a cap it ain’t never black on black
They watching where they shoot, and they careful where they loot
Check the field and you'll find proof
Black business staying 'til the end
Fooled a nigga one time, won’t work again
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
And I love it when they fear me
If I’m spittin’ to you clearly
Nigga, holla if ya hear me

[Chorus]
Holla if ya hear me
Yeah, nigga, holla if ya hear me
Holla if ya hear me, yo

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
To the preacher in the pulpit peep it
If you’re gonna preach about "turn the other cheek" you can keep it
In ’92 niggas don’t need it
They beating brothers in the streets and you’re talkin’ bout peace
Now ain’t that some fly shit
Just sit, be quiet, wait to die quick
Listen to y’all, we lost Malcolm and Hampton
Instead of an army we was marching and chanting;
“We shall overcome”
But we can’t do shit with a rock and a stick
Niggas better learn to shoot a fucking gun
And I’ve done heard enough of
The racist bitch ass judge and the white trucker
He shoulda kept his mouth on shut
Wanted to kick dust 'til some niggas rolled his ass up
And when I see the first full moon
I’m coming after Koon, watch a nigga go BOOM BOOM!
Then I want Briseno
Two to the head, now he’s headed out to Reno
And stuff Powell in the trunk, let him ride
Tie him up, make him watch his friend Wind die
Young Guns, niggas better fear me
Mothafuck the cops
You’re best to holla if ya hear me

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Yeah, holla if you muthafuckin’ hear me
It’s on once a-muthafucking-gain
Young Guns International
All across this muthafuckin’ country
Yo Maj, spark that shit

[Verse 3: Majesty]
It’s a miracle, I was born to amaze
Put 'em in a daze, in the morgue is where I’ll make em stay
Undeniable kid I’m coming through with authority
Ever since I was a tot I was disorderly
Puff a blunt, roll a clip, make dough
Grab a ho, fuck movin' slow
Gotta do it quick, then she gotta go
The thuggadon, the kingpin, your Majesty, nigga
Springfield, Young Guns causing tragedy, nigga
We got him in a smash, for his life he just begged
But I chopped him up and sent his mama his legs
Black mafia, uh, disorganized crime
That's how it is when I roll, if you don’t know the time
Impact from the blast, breaking down walls
A five feet killer with no sense at all
Inner city, ain’t it a pity, seems it will never end
Then they killed my friend, now to Hell I'm gonna send
A lot of motherfuckers, and that’s how it goes
'Til some other chump lucks up and put me down below
Yeah, so holla if ya hear me

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Move something, muthafucka
Yeah, Maj, spit on that nigga, man, shoot that nigga
Stretch, drop the bomb, Stretch, drop the bomb
Yeah muthafucka, yeah

[Verse 4: Stretch]
(*coughs*) Goddamn, uh, let a nigga clear my throat
Niggas blowing up shit, gotta flow in the smoke
So if ya hear me, holla, don’t fear me
But when I drop the mic don’t want no groupie niggas near me
Rockin' the squad, the big shots is where the marks is
What they don’t know is that they fuckin’ with the Heartless
Reigning supreme, it’s not a dream, nigga listen
When the YGz roll cops start pissing
So holla if ya hear me
