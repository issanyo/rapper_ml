I'm getting paid million dollar nigga raised with no father figure
Just a young nigga getting blazed drink alota liquor
Hanging with the dope boys down in the corner
Coming home to my mama smelling like marijuana
I'm getting high off through high school
Skipping class selling drugs cause the rent due
I needed cash thinking back when it was me n you
We had it cool hustling was all we knew to do
Stay making moves, when its time to ball I'm the one you call
Since we was small we was in and out of juvy hall
Breaking the law
We was screw up until we grew up
But we was destined to do it and everybody knew it
We getting to it all the little shit
And well be mad for a little bit
We just 2 bad ass ghetto kids
Scheemin and dreaming big
You should of seen everything we did
Used to be a team til my nigga switched now I'm just...

I'm under pressure the game can't let it stress you
The fame don't mean a thing when these cops got to arrest you
Though you get treated special niggas constantly test you
Probably never accept you hate you but never met you
And the friends that you knew for years they longer there
Its weird cause the cash gone and they all disappear
Now I'm solo riding in my lolo
Still blowing dro
And getting dodo
Won't stop for no hope
Its bout the money in the end
So fuck friends
Got all my chips in the game and I'm bout to cash in
I play the winner pray the lord forgive me for my sins
I stand tall but if I fall who can I call can't trust my dogs
They got my back against the wall
And though I'm young I feel like I done been through it all
From a to Z but I made a c cause I'm a g no peace in these streets
Till I see all my niggas free after ever be

I've been through hell and back I just tell my life and put it in a rap
Niggas I was done with way back I wonder where they at
Lets spark a blunt up and sip my henny keep em going under
Fake friends made me change my number had to relocate cause niggas hate
Talk behind my back but smiling in my face
Cut the grass fore I see the snakes
Gotta keep my eyes open
Don't wanna die hoping
Even though it hurts my chest I can't stop smoking
Them jealous ass niggas, them scandalous ass bitches
Starting to look suspicious so I'm sleeping with my pistol
Niggas got any issues we can make this shit official
For my niggas dead and gone let you know your nigga miss you
Until I'm with you
