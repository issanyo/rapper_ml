[2Pac]
Want to know how I did this shit, want to know how real my shit is, nigga go read the motherfucking newspaper you trick-ass nigga
I'm stuck in jail [x3]

[Verse 1]
Murderous mind state, can't keep my nine straight
Sipping on this Hennessey, waiting for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down, recognize
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw riders
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well known felons, labeled for drug selling, merciless jackers
Forever buzzed roll with thugs and dons
Commence to letting off rounds, then escape in the fog
Who wanna see me solo? Catch Makaveli while he sleeping
My mini-fourteen murdering niggas while they creeping
Duck or you ass out, drink till you pass out
Ain't scared to die, drunk driving in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories nigga, now they want to really see
Bomb first my motto is fully guaranteed
Niggas is player haters, label them my enemies, I'm dumpin'

[Hook]

Untouchable riders, murdering niggas
(Eminem)You'll never stop me!)
Ha! Scared to die
(Eminem)You'll all get shot!)

[Verse 2: Biggie]

The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah that sick nigga Biggie wit the 8 shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangster my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots
Niggas dropped quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's for me
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
My niggas crooked though it seems
My every single thought is caught up in collecting cream
A made nigga; picture me dying in a blaze of gun fire
Will not retire til I'm paid, turn the base up higher
When we ride, we fly by, bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 125, and Do or Die
Rolling with niggas from Long Beach to Long Isl'
I hardly smile cause my heart froze
Once I; commence my show rip apart foes
And now I, got One Nation it's a crooked compilation
Just to end the bullshit, let's get back to money making
Tell them busters that I rolled on controlling the house
My shit is so wicked when I flip, niggas closing their mouth
The Cocoa Brovaz, Buckshot the BDI Thug
Greg Nice, L.S., Asu, so show a nigga love, Outlaw!

[Hook]
