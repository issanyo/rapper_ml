[Intro: Capital LS & 2Pac]
Yo E, somebody come in this motherfucker with me man
I'm with you nigga, you don't need nobody, I'm with you nigga
Come on nigga what's up?
LS and 'Pac, Greg Nice
You're looking at me through the window
Asu, set it off with you nigga
Come up in here with me y'all
(Set it off nigga, for the niggas in New York, set it off)
Yo' ha ha ha ha ha yo' yo'
(LS in this biaatch!)
We in the motherfuckin'... west coast right now
(Westside)
Word to mother, my nigga Kurupt
(Eastside, ride)
K- Kurupt, word, I got my nigga Greg Nice
(Right there nigga, right there)
Baby Jesus and the Allstars
(babbbby babbby )
Tha Outlawz, takin' off their draws, niggas
Yo' we 'bout to... check it out

[Verse 1: Capital LS]
What does it take to shake and bake nowadays?
Niggas in crime, get made cause it pays
Bodies get sprayed with motherfuckin' ultra-rays
When shit gets too smooth I get's, rude with the lipper
Any kind of liquor's company like Jack Tripper
There's been times when I flip like acrobats
Fuckin' coast to coast, chickenheads to hoodrats
Tools to Gats, Lowriders to Ac's
Two years ago my shit was underrated (was underrated)
I wish you rap niggas frustrated
The rhyme stated updated; as I migrated
I'm direct from Strong Island, New York
Where I be smilin', profilin', wildin'
With my niggas in the Acura Coupe
In the Ja's and bitches like the Ginseng group (Ginseng baby)
Playin' that "One Love" loop Ha ha ha (loop)
The sun shines through my sunroof (sunroof)
Some days I can amaze the youth with proof that
The force of my rhyme can cause a cardiac (cardiac)
Arrestin' motherfuckers that don't like investin'
So I eat them up like salad dressin' (salad dressin')
And it don't stop

[Ad-libs: 2Pac]
Ha ha ha, yeah nigga, that's how we do that shit
LS in this bitch, nigga that's how we do that shit
Live live on the westside, eastside right, niggas can't understand it, no doubt, no doubt
My scandalous family, insanity
It ain't no playin' nigga we're takin' over the whole industry
You bitch made niggas can't believe that shit
LS and niggas so crazy
You only have to pay, to pull up on that bitch
You've been clowned, to make it to that ground
These niggas snatchin' your business kid

[Verse 2: Asu]
They fucked around and let the 3rd bred about the stable (Whats up?)
Me and my Cali niggas is jumpin' fools without the cables (Without the AK)
Everything I got is double 2's 4's and barrels
Once that ass slipped we gots to burn it like Carrol
Somehow someway real niggas know real niggas yeah yo why is that?
When you roll Asu, you end up with them tires flat
The names Asu, it starts with A and ends with you
Whatever you want to do, I got my whole fuckin' crew
Up over the mountain there's fountain of phrases
I'm countin' pages, ages is givin' up wages to heal the rages
I don't riff, I stay cool let the sanity build
All I need is a starter and the horror that's worse than Amityville
No disrespect, all we want is bacon G
Pack them bags; they have them hotel got vacancy

[2Pac talk]
That's right nigga set that shit 'til they motherfuckin' chincheckin' we wreck it, Look here

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
My niggas crooked, though it seems
My every single, thought is caught up, in collectin' cream
A made nigga, Picture me dyin' in the blaze, or gunfire
Will not retire 'til I'm paid, turn the bass up high
When we ride, we fly by, bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 1-2-5 and do or die
Rollin' with niggas from Long Beach, to Long I
I hardly smile, cause my heart froze
Once I, commence my show, I rip apart foes
Now I, got one nation its a crooked compilation
Just to end the bullshit let's get back to money makin'
Tell 'em bustas that I rolled on, controllin' our house
My shit's so wicked when I flip, niggas  closin' they mouth
Them Cocoa brovaz, Buckshot the BDI thug
Greg Nice, LS, Asu, so show a nigga love
Outlaw!

[Outro: 2Pac]
You feel that shit nigga!
You know what time it is, ha ha ha ha, yeah!
Hit them niggas with the shit that made Nice & Smooth nice nigga
Greg Nice feel me nigga?

But she never got fucked by a thug nigga
Come on! I know she fucked a lot of drug dealers
But she never got fucked by a thug nigga
