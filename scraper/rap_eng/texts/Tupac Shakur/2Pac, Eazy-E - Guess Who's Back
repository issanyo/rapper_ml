[Intro: 2Pac, Eazy-E]
Eazy!

[Hook x4: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac, Eazy-E]
I'm back nigga!
2Pac's back nigga!
(Guess who's back!)

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Aw yeah!
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma she was warned when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's 2015, and now they yell code blue
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long
I'm comin' strong and fast
Dizzy spells, flashbacks in my head
Niggas ain't want me to bein' happy when I'm dead
Knock up 8 niggs
Kill up 10 pigs
Innocent fuckers are also dying too
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin' kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E

[Hook x4: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac, Eazy-E]
I'm back nigga!
2Pac's back nigga!
(Guess who's back!)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But I've been heavy in this game since '71
The world ain't ready 4 my mom duke celebrity son
But now they ass out, my shits so lethal making jealous niggas pass out
To all my people who love the music on my last album
I must assure you this is better get ya cash out
Outlaw Immortal play the bitch and get your ass tossed
Run up in motherfuckas spots like I'm task force
Niggas is hoppin, but they ain't, jumpin' cuz they petrified
You can hold my clip, set it up and best believe it will get you high
(yeah nigga)
To all the playaz on tha westside
We still be ballin' on these bitches when the rest die
Trying to maintain while my politics is bomb first
Go on, curse, tradin' war stories, seein' who went wrong first
Run with the brothers that love me, the ones that pull for me
Life has so many rewards nigga
(Guess who's back?)
Outlaw Immortals!

[Hook x8: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac, Eazy-E]
I'm back nigga!
2Pac's back nigga!
(Guess who's back!)
