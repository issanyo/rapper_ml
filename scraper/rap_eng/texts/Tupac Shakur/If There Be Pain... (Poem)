If there be pain,
all u need 2 do
is call on me 2 be with u
And before u hang up the phone
u will no longer be alone
Together we can never fall
because our love will conquer all

If there be pain,
reach out 4 a helping hand
and I shall hold u wherever I am
Every breath I breathe will be into u
4 without u here my joy is through
my life was lived through falling rain
so call on me if there be pain

Faithfully yours,
Tupac Amaru Shakur
