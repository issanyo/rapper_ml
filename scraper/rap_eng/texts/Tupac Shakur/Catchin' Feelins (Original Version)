[Intro: 2pac]
(Hahaha, oh yes)
(My home boys might squabble but we don’t fall down)
Catchin feelins
(Never, hahaha, yeah)
Did y'all read what Puffy and Big said in Vibe?
(My home boys might squabble but we don’t fall down)
Didn't they sound like suckaz?
(Uh, yeah)
Outlawz got them on the run
(My home boys might squabble but we don’t fall down)
Going for none
(Haha, westside, westside)
Oh this part two of the beef
Part two of the war

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Cross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here
My last foe flashed then I mashed his ass
Bastard, fuck with me, bet I blast your ass
So many follow but can't reach me, caught in the maze
Catch them, mimickin' my style tryin' to walk this way
Impossible my posse droppin' you, we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feelin' blessed, the richer I get, the more I stress
Smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
Dear God I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Watchin' niggas catch strays, shake, choke and bleed
Me, a mercenary for the streets, check my pedigree
Bustin' motherfuckers it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit, then get to squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelins

[Hook: 2Pac]
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catchin' feelins
