U say that u'll love me forever but what about today
As the dusks become dawns and the years pass on will u love me the same way
If so let us rejoice and bathe in constant pleasure
If not spare my heart today and I shall recover before forever
And if my doubts and ?'s upset u, forgive my fragile heart
I just wanted 2 know if you'd love me forever
Before Today would START!
