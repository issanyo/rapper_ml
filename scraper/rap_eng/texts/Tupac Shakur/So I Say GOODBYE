I'm going in to this not knowing what I'll find
but I've decided to follow my heart and abandon my mind
and if there be pain I know that at least I gave my all
and it is better to  have loved and lost than to not love at all
In the morning I may wake to smile or maybe 2 cry
but first to those of my past I must say goodbye
