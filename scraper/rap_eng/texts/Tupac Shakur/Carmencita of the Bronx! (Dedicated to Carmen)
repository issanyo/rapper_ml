u saw innocence at its best
I wanted u more than I wanted me
I remember my last thought at night was of u
and my first thought in the morning was of u
It has been a long time since I've actually
sat and adored u but every once in awhile
your beautiful smile guides me through a day
I hear u R with another and u R expecting
I wish u good luck he is lucky 2 be able
2 wake up 2 u each morning
c u in heaven!
