Yeah

[Chorus]
Undeniable
Undeniable (Yeah)
Unforgettable
Unforgettable (What do we have here now?)
Never Let You Go
Till the end
Undeniable
Undeniable
Unforgettable
Unforgettable (What do we have here now?)
Never Let You Go (Kasinova Tha Don)
Till the end

[Verse 1]
My evil thoughts became the lettuce
So when I'm gone my spirit will roam the Earth you hear it screaming for vengence
Follow my posse let my shotty reign
It takes a little bit of Henny, fuck 'em all watch they bodies hang
My evil thoughts can have me sitting in court, with no remorse
Mysterious thoughts leaving the bloody corpse
Hail Mary somebody pray amongst the living
My enemies really got me crossed so it's self-forgiving
Memories of being broke got me sick as hell
I hit the smoke until I choke I wasn't living well
Make bail and hit the scene with my guillotine
Affiliated with my niggas who been keeping the dream
We keep it poppin' like we supposed to
And if you wishing for Pac, this the only thing that's close to
Collecting currency, I'm well paid
Witness the energy we bring it cause we self-made, was born a renegade

[Chorus]
Undeniable
Undeniable
Unforgettable
Unforgettable (What do we have here now?)
Never Let You Go
Till the end
Undeniable
Undeniable
Unforgettable
Unforgettable (What do we have here now?)
Never Let You Go
Till the end

[Verse 2]
I got the sound like it's '96
So everytime i'm in the booth I'm dropping deep shit
But peep this
I'm on a mission to defeat any competition wanted
You can see me in the streets so don't be acting like you wanted peace
I'm not a killer but I can be
Bust until it's empty leave him sleep by the creep, can you feel me?
Keeping it real as my stories is told
Switch my name to Kasinova had the rap game sold
Planting seeds in the dirt, watch it rise for y'all
Coming up fast, never got the chance to crawl
Packin' a vest you never catch me slipping
I seen my homie get murdered because he never listened
Belive in fairy-tales, hell no
You caught me knocking cowards out with my southpaw
So now I'm ducking the law
Only if you know all the trouble I've seen
Everybody get a chance to be a part of my team
Let's go

[Chorus]
Undeniable
Undeniable
Unforgettable
Unforgettable (What do we have here now?)
Never Let You Go
Till the end
Undeniable
Undeniable
Unforgettable
Unforgettable (What do we have here now?)
Never Let You Go
Till the end
