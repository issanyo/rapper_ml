Cause they're bragging, telling the fuckers in jail yo, we just got pumped woo
And that's why we don't do it, I know what I'm doing, imma destroy 'em

[Verse 1]
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggas?
Used to love niggas now I plug niggas, and slug niggas
Am I wrong? Niggas makin songs, tryin to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin to do me - look bitch!
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin trick shot
My lyrics runnin all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we RIDE

[Hook]
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene

[Verse 2]
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
You was HEARTLESS on yo' hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin, don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD
Know I meant, EVERY MOTHERFUCKIN WORD

[Hook]
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene

I really didn't believe until I got shot that no black person would shoot me
I was their representative, they would never harm me

[Hook] x2
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin' over me through every murder scene
