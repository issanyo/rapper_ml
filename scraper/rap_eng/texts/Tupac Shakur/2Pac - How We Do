[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
This, is, how, we do
I'm with the homies
Fuck hanging with them phonies in the club
This, is, how, we do
And I'm a motherfuckin' thug, so show a nigga love

[Verse 1: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Fresh like, aww
Impala aww (ayo!)
(No!) (Fuck that!)

[Interlude: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
(Fuck wrong y'all niggas man?)
(Hit them niggas with the shit nigga!)
(Ayo this next one mine man, next one mine..)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Pictures are plenty
Sippin' my glass full of henny
Hands on my semi-
Automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact
Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap
It's a trap a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks
Makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say
We murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the crack out
My lyrics strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Niggas pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, itâ€™s fatal
'fficiently I delete then flee
The art of wa neva fail me
I inhaler
Livin' sucka free
Get wit' me
Livin' sucka free
Get wit' me (x6)

[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
This, is, how, we do
I'm with the homies
Fuck hanging with them phonies in the club
This, is, how, we do
And I'm a motherfuckin' thug, so show a nigga love

[Outro: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
You feel me?
And I'm a motherfucking thug, so show a nigga love (x4)
