[Intro]
A thug's life don't matter. We don't give a shit about you damn thugs, your life don't matter. And you sons of bitches, you fixin' to find out how it don't matter cause you done pissed us off, you bunch of bastards

[Pre-Hook: Gucci Mane]
Big, big, big pistol me ('stol on Guc')
You lose your life, fuckin' right, try me and bleed (Burr)
I put my first gat first, then sting, I don't think
I get your head to the white, make your shit pink
All OG pink, don't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I need a detox cause I've been smoking kush all week
And if I piss some dirty urine then I'm up shit creek
I'm major tourin' shows everyday, I gets no sleep
My money lanky, taller than a man 6 foot 3
My left pinky nine karat diamond cut so neat
And if I told you what it cost, you would say "golly"
I spend 50k a month and that's just on chains
I got your girlfriend rolling blunts in the VIP
I got a carbon 15 sitting on my front seat
And plus my shoes'll eat your face like bon appetit
The feds looking at me, know they got they eyes on me
I feel like 2Pac when he made All Eyez On Me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I keep the Glock on me
Stupid Glock on me
I can't let 'em get the drop on me
I keep a nine on me, stupid nine on me
Lord knows I got guap on me
Stupid rocks on me, crazy rocks on me
I paid a million for this watch on me golly
And my bricks so young, my birds gon' need ID
I feel like 2Pac when he made All Eyez On Me

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Bitch you misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip, cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga, where the love niggas?
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to 'zines, writing raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks now they all want to sue me
So fuck em' all

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I keep the Glock on me
Stupid Glock on me
I can't let 'em get the drop on me
I keep a nine on me, stupid nine on me
Lord knows I got guap on me
Stupid rocks on me, crazy rocks on me
I paid a million for this watch on me golly
And my bricks so young, my birds gon' need ID
What you know bout me? You ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It get so lonely at the top, I need some company
My swears so stupid that these hoes be holding doors for me
She wanna stay with me, know that I'ma faithfully
I'm like a drug to her, she can't walk away from me
Niggas don't play with me cause I keep AK's with me
Police survalliance I know they fuckin' taping me
But all they gonna see is diamond cars and currency
I'm currently out the country chasin' currency
I got some weed on me now and some ecstasy
30 grams and a nine and a knife on me
Watch your mouth bout me, dirty South I be
Do your momma teach you don't talk when grown folks speak? (It's Gucci)
