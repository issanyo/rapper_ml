Fuck a bitch I ain't celibate, try to get rich
Typa shit I'll settle with fa the better end
God bless em
Papa, Blood Vessels
38 Special. Let the karma come and guess you
Whats pressure?
Trigger finger no stressing
Murders every day, bodies piling to a cesspool
Why flex when We feeling like the next due. All my life, been ready if you ever knew
Pacing fa the top from the bottom where they can't go
Formulate a plot foreign way
Eliminate the norm
Don't bite, all along set it straight for em

When the pressures on its a hit
Weed bag, extra cash, bring the bitches
Err body choose, when we down them drinks. We stay wildin, cuz talk is cheap
