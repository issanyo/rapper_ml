I'm back
THUG LIFE baby

[Hook]
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talking facts like 2Pac's back
I'm a Thug till I die
Ain't nobody can stop me
You niggas getting too fly but your lyrics are sloppy
So tell me
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talking facts like 2Pac's back
I'm a Thug till I die
Ain't nobody can stop me
You niggas getting too fly but your lyrics are sloppy

[Verse 1]
Y'all need to Picture Me Rollin'
Look all the green that i'm holding
My enemies started choking
Because my pockets are swolling
My mama told me to watch 'em because these cowards be plotting
Equipped with automatic weapons, guess you bastards forgot
My guillotine be mobbin' hard like killers in prison yards
Eat while you can because you punks is about to starve
Ain't no telling if felons will make it out without selling
In the cage im dwelling when all my rage is yelling
I'm so addicted to getting lifted i'm twisting the Swisher Suites
Perfected the game, label me MVP
I be screaming that 'THUG LIFE' because I know they don't like it
Prepare my army for battle and watch me trigger a riot
But now

[Hook]
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talking facts like 2Pac's back
I'm a Thug till I die
Ain't nobody can stop me
You niggas getting too fly but your lyrics are sloppy
So tell me
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talking facts like 2Pac's back
I'm a Thug till I die
Ain't nobody can stop me
You niggas getting too fly but your lyrics are sloppy

[Verse 2]
I went from rags to riches, to worldwide living
I hit the baddest bitches when I left prison
Educated by drug dealing, was playing for keeps
Destroying niggas careers everytime when I sleep
I ran with niggas with red laces and red bandanas
All my homies caught fed cases with grams and hammers
Forgive me father, I'm troubled
Gs respecting my hustle
It wasn't easy, believe me I went through the struggle
My adversaries is burried, my girlfriend's worried
I start another raging gunfight, lost in the fury
Initiated an outcast, they plot when the shots blast
Sipping on some Hennessy pouring a big glass
These chickens be assed out, the reason I cash out
They be wanting relations so meet me up in the glass house
Wanna fuck with the dead so imma eat like a zombie
Y'all took shots at my head but now you niggas can't find me
But now

[Hook]
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talking facts like 2Pac's back
I'm a Thug till I die
Ain't nobody can stop me
You niggas getting too fly but your lyrics are sloppy
So tell me
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talking facts like 2Pac's back
I'm a Thug till I die
Ain't nobody can stop me
You niggas getting too fly but your lyrics are sloppy
