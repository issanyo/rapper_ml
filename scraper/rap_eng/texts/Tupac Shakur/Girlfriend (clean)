Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down the ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend

Where would you be, be without me?
We'll never find out
What would I do, do without you?
We'll never know now

Talking 'bout the lights, the dirt
The sh*t that hurts, we're not gonna turn around
We're doin' this for good, for worse
The gift, the curse, we're gonna back down

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)

I wanna feel the sun, the waves
The wind in my face, the speed, the chains (Na na na na)
I wanna feel the sun, the waves
Just run across States, making up as we go

That's how it's gon' be, young, wild and free
Not gonna slow down
Up to the max, on till we crash
We're not gonna stop now

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)

Na na na na (Me and my girlfriend)
Na na na na (Me and my girlfriend)

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (Me and my girlfriend)
