Chorus
We better 
Tell me what youre gonna do
If we ride or die?
(repeats)
. take one step out of time
. were gonna party all night
. by my side
I love you how youre loving me
Were gonna make steps one two three four
You will be on my mind all the time
Ride or die
Is what I adore
If I got you
And you got me
I promise were gonna be the ones
The ones
 no fun
Were gonna run
Run run run
Were gonna run
Run run run
