"For us to live any other way was nuts. Uh, to us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks and took the subway to work every day and worried about their bills were dead. I mean they were suckers. They had no balls. If we wanted something, we just took it. If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again."

[Verse 1: Big Syke]
Picture me soundin' like the world wide mob figure
Whoo-riders this Syke, call me that nigga
The wigga, connection flex from Ingle-Watts to Texas
Ridin' coast to coast heated in a Lexus
Out the gutter, born to smuggle
K-ball sag so much you can see my drawers
Let me ball if I can, I know I can-can
If somebody ask you tell 'em that you the man
Congregation expand across thug lands
Built an army, so don't ever try to harm me
Sucka free, suga flee, want it be
Please stay the hell away from me
I don't want to cheat no mo'
But you did when yo ass was broke and po'

"[Anthony:] Tommy, no, you got it all wrong —
[Tommy:] Oh, oh, Anthony. He's a big boy, he knows what he said. What did ya say? Funny how?
[Anthony:] You're right
Henry: Just —
[Tommy:] What?
[Henry:] Just, ya know, you're funny
[Tommy:] You mean, let me understand this, 'cause, ya know maybe it's me, I'm a little fucked up maybe, but I'm funny how? I mean funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh, I'm here to fuckin' amuse you? What do you mean funny? Funny how? How am I funny?
[Henry:] Just... you know, how you tell the story — what?"

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
Now when you say, "world wide," please understand it
'Cause we got a whole nation of homies and Outlawz that we mash with
Cash respect, in a large abundance and the G's I roll
Come with the game to maintain the funk gets
Handle [?] soldiers dismantle the road of this
What happened to the women's who be jaw jackin'?
Paper stackin' is accomplished by putting out bomb shit
On top of our game is where we stay forever poppin'

"[Ribera:] Just remember, last year this time we were in a fucking cage, okay?
[Montana:] You remember. I like to forget that
[Ribera:] I say be happy with what you got, You be happy
[Montana:] Me, I want what's coming to me
[Ribera:] What's coming to you?
[Montana:] The worId, chico, and everything in it."

[Interlude: 2Pac]
World wide motherfucking mob figures
Weed smoking, gun toting, drinking
Riding on our motherfucking enemies

[Reservoir Dogs sample]
[Nice Guy Eddie:] Have you lost your fuckin' mind?
[Mr. White:] Joe, you're making a terrible mistake. I'm not gonna let you make it
[Mr. Pink:] Come on, guys! Nobody wants this! We're supposed to be fucking professionals!
[Nice Guy Eddie:] Larry, look. It's been quite a long time. A lot of jobs. There's no need for this, man. Let's just put our guns down, and let's settle this with a fuckin' conversation
[Mr. White:] Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. I repeat If you kill that man, you die next."

[Verse 3: Kastro]
Ever since a tod it been evident to me
Runnin' the block would be heaven sent and very relevant
That was better then, that's a won't be, never now
Don't be jealous now, I'm on a world wide level
Being told it's on after I flow across the globe
Mobbin' like Robin Hood, for my gold, like it's Oak
I hold my load down all the way like the brown
World wide mob figure on a ride me and my niggas clown

[Reservoir Dogs sample]
"[Mr. Orange:] What happens if the manager won't give you the diamonds?
[Mr. White:] When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer, or an employee, who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Jumps right into the floor. Everyone jumps. He falls down screaming, blood squirts out of his nose, freaks everybody out, nobody says fucking shit after that."

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Known for doing scandalous deeds, no handlin' me
And nah, it ain't the drugs, it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery is automatic, lettin' niggas have it
I've been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks
Ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a—catch a nigga world wide
A fuckin' mob figga West coast, who-ride
When we rob niggas money make my squad bigger
But we ain't sell our souls
Bustin' on my enemies, murder my foes
At my shows I'm a nut, lights camera time for action
Now get to clappin' to my cuts, a world wide mob figga
