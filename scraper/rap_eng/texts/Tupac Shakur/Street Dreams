Oh, this ain't Hip Hop, this is R&B, oh yeah
I can remember, remember when
Wasn't ballin, didn't have no ends
No friends, I was alone
Street dreamin' was all I know

Benz, rims, dubs they keep spinnin'
Cribs, jacuzzis chillin'
Clubs, good bud, what we call livin'
Thugs for life, thats what we screamin'

Street dreams are made of these
600 Benzes and SUVs, thats why
Live my life as a thug till the day I die
I'm livin' life as a boss, playa even gettin' high

All eyes on me, all eyes on me
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

In a fitted throwback
Or when Im at my finest splendour
Or when Im feelin' like Im all that
Or when Im feelin' like Im laid back

Benz, rims, dubs they keep spinnin'
Cribs, jacuzzis chillin'
Clubs, good buds, what we call livin'
Thugs for life, thats what we screamin'

Street dreams are made of these
600 Benzes and SUVs, thats why
Live my life as a thug till the day I die
I'm livin' life as a boss, playa even gettin' high

Street dreams are made of these
600 Benzes and SUVs, thats why
Live my life as a thug till the day I die
I'm livin' life as a boss, playa even gettin' high

In the beginning it was so hard
Now we made it, some call us stars
Not me, Im the same ol G
Ive just acquired what makes the hood happy

Benz, rims, dubs they keep spinnin'
Cribs, jacuzzis chillin'
Clubs, good bud, what we call livin'
Thugs for life, thats what we screamin'

Street dreams are made of these
600 Benzes and SUVs, thats why
Live my life as a thug till the day I die
I'm livin' life as a boss, playa even gettin' high

Street dreams are made of these
600 Benzes and SUVs, thats why
Live my life as a thug till the day I die
I'm livin' life as a boss, playa even gettin' high

All eyes on me, all eyes on me
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

I think I see it now
