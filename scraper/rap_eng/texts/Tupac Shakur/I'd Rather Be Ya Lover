[Chorus]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I don't know where I stand with you
I never ever make any plans with you
I don't know what I mean to you
The only thing I know is I dream of you
And all that I know [all that I know]
Is I just don't understand [just don't understand]
Why my, mmmm, happiness, always lies
In the palm of your hand, but

[Chorus]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Sometimes I know what you're thinking next
But wouldn't it be better if I loved you less?
Sometimes I think that I made you up
But wouldn't it be better if I gave you up?
And all that I know [all that I know]
Is I just don't understand [just don't understand]
Why my, mmmm, happiness always lies
In the palm of your hand, but

[Chorus]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

Are you surprised?

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Hey!, don't slip before they lips say
Even when the media is gettin' greedier you'll make they hips sway
Creepin' with the bomb ambition
I caught you peepin', and I ain't sleepin'
Got you freakin' through the whole weekend
Frankly speakin'; is it passion or just a heat
Got you tryna get me all up in your satin sheets
What would they say, a blonde and a thug brother
The way you gettin' paid, wish we was lovers
And ...

[Madonna]
And all that I know [all that I know]
Is I just don't understand [just don't understand]
Why my, mmmm, happiness always lies (yeah yeah yeah)
In the palm of your hand, but

[Chorus] + (2pac talking)
I could be your sister (hey hold on)
I could be your mother (I don't need no mo**
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover (yeah yeah)
That's right, I'd rather be your lover (I bet you would)
I could be your sister (chill out with that)
I could be your mother (that's illegal)
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother (yeah yeah)
But I'd rather be your lover (just bringing in girl)
That's right (that's right), I'd rather be your lover (I bet you would)
I could be your sister (hey check this out though)
I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

[Outro]
Are you surprised?
I love you
