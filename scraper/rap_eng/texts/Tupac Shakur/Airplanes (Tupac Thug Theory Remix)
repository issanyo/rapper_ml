[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: 2Pac- Hold on Be Strong lyrics mix]
There's, never a good day
Cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days
Sometimes it hurts to pray
And every Halloween
Check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth
Sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
And if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise
So keep ya head up
And even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
So keep ya head up
And make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day...
Dear Lord can you hear me!!

[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: 2Pac - Thugz Mansion]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace
And even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all so we can ball, at thug's mansion


[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now


[Bridge: Eminem]
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
"Marshall you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win"
Pretend he just stayed outside all day
And played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move
And schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
And just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
"You won't amount to shit, quit daydreamin', kid!
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic"
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him
But he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap
So he ain't even here, he pretends that…


[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars....
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
