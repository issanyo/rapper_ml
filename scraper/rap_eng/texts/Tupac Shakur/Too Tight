[Verse 1: MC Hammer]
Baby back up, if you asthmatic
This track'll have you going way back like bad habit
I heard you talking loud and clear you ain't saying nothing
This beat is pumping got you swerving in your ride when you play it bumpin'
I caught some player hating punks talking 'bout my style
I'm getting money doing this for a while
Bunch of immature squares using bad grammar
I hit the city have 'em screaming "You the man Hammer"
Holla if you understand me, its new drag
Poppa got a new bag and its too bad
Come on, was getting hype in the back seat
Boom when the track meet
Me make 'em get up on they black feet
They told me Hammer wasn't popping so I changed the plan
And came back with a monster jam
Throw up your hands if you feel me, touch the sky
Cause you ain't got to be high to fly
Now what my people say

[Hook]
Everybody talking 'bout they down to ride, now that Hammer's bustin' too tight
But I don't think they know what we got tonight
Show 'em Hammer cause you're too tight

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]
You wonda' why they call me Hammer
I shake the whole state, earthquake the whole planet
I got you jumping out your chair like you're panicking
Quit being stiff its similar to watching mannequins
Throw up your hands up again and swing 'em back side to side
Hammer time in this mother sucker time to ride
Where you from Hammer? Oak Town I reside
Until I die, heart full of home town pride
Don't ask why things changed, am I still the same
Daddy never left the game, he just got strange
So peep game, cause the fame is a narcotic
The fans want to get a fix but the stars got it
And you'll be going through the stacks of junk
Packs of pumps, and still can't find a track that bumps
Well never worry cause your homie got your legs tonight
And all my people say its too tight
Now what my people say

[Hook]
Everybody talking 'bout they down to ride, now that Hammer's bustin' too tight
But I don't think they know what we got tonight
Show 'em Hammer cause we're too tight

[Verse 3: MC Hammer]
The third verse getting worse for the wallflowers
Either hit the floor or hit the door coward
Since its a Death Row party got the cream and the crop
I keep it popping got the whole crowd screaming don't stop, until you drop
Music motivates a generation
All color barriers are broken when I rock the nation
From senior citizens to minors in the little league
From thugs and jocks, and even cops killing me
Consider me to be the one to put the love back
And can't nobody rock the show like the Hammer with a club track
And since my aim is for motion, I got a new potion
To groove you from coast to coast, so get close
Cause ain't nothing but a party y'all, we keep it going till the daylight
Cause this is too tight
Not only the women but all the men
As soon it end it start again
Now what my people say

[Hook x2]
Everybody talking 'bout they down to ride, now that Hammer's busting too tight
But I don't think they know what we got tonight
Show 'em Hammer cause we're too tight
