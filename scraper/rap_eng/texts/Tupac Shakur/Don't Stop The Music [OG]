[Intro: 2Pac]
This go out to C. Delores Tucker
(God damn rap music I hate that)
Bob dole
(It's just so violent and it destroys everybody)
And everybody else who feels like uh

They stronger than the constitution
(Kids kill people)
Freedom of speech big baby
(There's cop haters)
Freedom of speech
(They goin' against society I don't understand the music, it's too loud)
Outlawz!
(It' too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent)
(Let's ban all rap music)
Outlawz
(Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz Ban 'em)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
You can't break me never made me, busta soft ass beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Delores Tucker sue me I won't stop
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies, tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites whistlin' Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can they stop me? (won't)
Tryna sell 4 million copies (T.H.U.G)
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we comin' from
Life as an Outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop

[Collision: Val Young]
Don't you stop it (You don't really gonna stop, hayy)

[Verse 2: E.D.I]
You don't really wanna stop - stop
The only thing that we got
I bang knott's, so how much you plot
On these youngsters, millions of 'em that's lovin' everything we say
Cause at this every single day yeah
Some of us is trippin' on it (huh)
But in turn busta's slippin' on it
So get up on it, don't be an opponent
Cause this is feedin' my family, take it away
And see me in every single place you plan to be
Don't stop

[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]
I got 58 ways to get out of the game
But only one way's gonna fit my name; Hussein
Ride by, with the block, I can't stop
Not even for the cop's will, I close down shop
Yo, I broke nights to get big, gettin' rope spot's hold it tight
(You don't really gonna stop, hayy)
Runnin' with fat blunts niggas ain't rollin' right
Temp this
I bitch this track, I love rap (You don't really gonna stop, haha)
Senseless, relentless in every sentence but above that
Brain driller, fuckin' Fatal's a walkin' pain killer
(You don't really gonna stop, hayy)
Insane iller than caine, Uzi cops, then watch 'em fear ya
Who's next?
I'm ready to check a neck in a second
(You don't really gonna stop, haha)
Gripin' the TEC and slap' ya head because I snap under pressure
Cuttin' circulation
Stranded on the plant the earth's chasin'
Scared of probation now I'm facin' death tryna hurt a nation
Burn like acid
Fart, blunts and Jurassic, Park
My bastard ass click we got the strip mashin'

[Hook: Val Young]
Don't you stop it (You don't really gonna stop, hayy)
