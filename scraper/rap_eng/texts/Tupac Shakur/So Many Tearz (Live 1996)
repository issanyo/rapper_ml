[Spoken Word]
... you don't wanna
Uh, uh
So many tears y'all
Shed so many tears
C'mon, let's get loud in this motherfucker, tonight
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
Said so many tears!
Uh, uh
C'mon
How it started nigga

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Chorus]
Lord, God
Shed so many tears
Lord, God
Shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to last

[Spoken Word]
Hey, yo, go to the next shit
Hey, yo, I got some new shit for you tonight
Oh yes
See, it's this nigga named Nas
And he kick it with these niggas called Mobb Deep
And they kick it with these niggas named Bad Boy
(Bad Boy killa)
But I say fuck 'em all!
So I'm about to take this nigga beat
And whoop his ass with his own motherfuckin' beat
(Tell them nigga)
I send this out to Nas
And any one else down with that clique
