[Intro: 2Pac]
Yeah these are my words to my firstborn, you know what time it is, these are
My words to my firstborn, nothin' left to hear

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, can you picture, young niggas in a rush to grow
Till hard timers in the pen, had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin' - too busy bullshittin'
Caught him with his mouth runnin'; ain't this a bitch
They got me twisted in this game
The Feds and the punk Po-lice pointin' pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit - now shit is flipped
Cause niggas died over bullshit - it's not my dream
I'm seein' pictures of a broken man, no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man, young adolescents
In our prime live a life of crime, though it ain't logical
We hobble through these tryin' times, livin' blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homiez had to die before they got to grow
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer one love
To the thugs in heaven I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my firstborn, feel me

[2Pac]
My words to my firstborn
My words to my firstborn

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed
So I knew, that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me there was no distortion
Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions
Quiet your soul, cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand it's a better day comin'
Sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end
Drivin' with the car runnin' blinded
Ain't no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasn't able to breathe, cause the family wasn't able
Can't - blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
Cause in the game things change livin' up and down
This hard life got me walkin' with my head down
Flashin' frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?
But I'll never get to know, so I carry on
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
My words to my firstborn
Feel me

[Skit: 2Pac]
My words to my firstborn
My niggas Nutt-So up in this bitch
These are the words to my firstborn
Hey nigga talk to your born, talk to your seeds

[Verse 3: Nutt-So]
I'm just another thug nigga trapped up in this ghetto life
An endless hustle, strugglin' tryin' to settle right
And doin' dirt ain't savin' me
But the streets is the only thing payin' me, feel me
Runnin' with G's, Stackin' G's, Packin' heat
Mob life 'til these mothafuckas wack me
Stackin' greenary, thuggin' 'til I die
Pickin' up so much J, I'm gettin' high
Got the feds on me, and they label me a bad [?]
Thinkin' I'm the reason why this nigga got his head to
On the run, now daddy got to pack a gun
Cause these niggas wanna make you the last one
About these riches
These jealous bitches [?] sellin' through
Welcome to life, and if I die
Remember that it is all love when I'm by your side
Every night, don't be a loser
Choose your dreams through your things
Cause solo to the ho ho will twitch you up like shoe strings
Open your eyes, don't let these haters get you
Roll up and diss you
My words to my firstborn

[Outro: 2Pac]
Words to my mothafuckin' seeds, you feel me
Nigga don't know what's goin' to happen until tomorrow and the next day
Your fuckin' [?] can be gone tomorrow
I done seen it happen, motherfucker get two bullets to his head, he no longer exists, that's what I'm talkin' about
What you gon' tell your kids nigga?
Who was you? What was you doin? How did you put it down?
These my words to my motherfuckin' first born
So they can know, y'knahmean? Hehehe
Ain't nuttin' but a motherfuckin' rider, Westside 'til I die
That's all it was, it's a crooked-ass hand they deal a motherfucker
I just played to win, just played to win
Motherfucker gotta bet agains' the odds, y'knahmean?
Rollin' with mothafuckin' dice
Sometimes you get 7 or 11, sometimes you leave the crap out
That's all the chance a motherfucker can take when you're rider though
Cause these are my words to my mothafuckin' firstborn
Me and my nigga Nutt-So, represtentin' the thugs, all over this mothafucka, worlwide
You know what time it is
All the abortion clinics, all the baby's that died in miscarriage, you know what time it is
We out this bitch
