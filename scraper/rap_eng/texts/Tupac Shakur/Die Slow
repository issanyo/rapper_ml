[Intro]
Jay Z, come out to play
Hey yo Assassin, gimme one of them tracks I can just ride on motherfuckers
With
Mobb deep.
Niggas talkin' bout we can't rap? Niggas must nota' never heard no motherfuckin'
Track off a death row nigga
DEATH ROW, WESTSIDE
Let's get it on, daylight or fuckin' nightbreak
MOB
Go into these niggas, to the motherfuckin' death

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk â€˜cause I'm a mad man whenever sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, Your Honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit, heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me, another gay rapper
Bustin' caps at Jay Z and still avoid capture
While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
I'm in Jamaica sippin' daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin' then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
Niggas player-hatin', got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin' "Death Row!", throw my Westside, ain't no thing
We was raised off driveby's. brought up to bang
We claim mob. MOB. if you be specific
We control. ALL cash from the Atlantic, Pacific
And get this. I'm hard to kill
While I build with this live spot
Father. how the hell did I SURVIVE. these five shots?!
Live it up or give it up
And like DEMONS. late night. hear 'em screamin'
WE GOIN' ALL OUT!

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
With money clutchin', bail, come murder man, po's rushin'
Cap tilted to the side, on the lean out the ride bustin'
Outlaws enforce the secrets of war, but won't abuse it
Burnt, bury my burners with my dead buddies when I use it
Give a fuck about later. shots warm through the equator
Death to you traitors, shots bitin' through your bones like alligator
Payin' my dues. lookin' for miscellaneous infamous crews
Old ladies sing the blues. leave them smokin' from they shoes

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Now with my every wakin' moment
I'm on a quest to be better, yeah
Position myself to prosper state, prepared for whatever
But at times, I slip slightly, shit I ain't afraid to admit it
To gone, off that Novocaine, like in too hard to live it
And I'm just a smidgen past my teenage years. into adulthood
Now I ride with G's finally, knowin' myself good
And it felt good, when I was young but playtime's over
EDI here take this gun nigga it's over

[Verse 3: Kastro]
I piss cold blood, shit hot liquor out my liver
Smoke like a tail pipe, and write when I'm bitter
All my life I been considered a downright, dirty nigga
From when daddy knocked mama' s twat popped the last drop from the litter
Tell me give the world hell
But in hell I give 'em mo'
And I bail outta jail
Screamin' fuck the Po' Po'
When I run to take that enough, from a simple fuck
To multimillion dollar luck

[Verse 4: Napolean]
Plus I think it's time to grab all pistols, wave them shits in the air
Celebrate Outlaw livin' nigga, I wouldn't be here
To you death is losin', and to me this shit's a family reunion
And to hell wit a peace treaty, never call it, cause it wouldn't feed me
My wallet. be as empty as the day I got started
Twelve shots in my pocket, left my niggas departed
It's a shame that these snake vultures niggas coldhearted
In a dirty world where only God know yo death and can call it

[Verse 5: Young Noble]
We thugged out, low cut, Outlawz rush and royal flush
Bomb first kickin' dust. out in Cali, but I ain't in it so much
Make 'em pay state to state, NJ to CA
Them cowards felt the weight, and turned feminine like Michel'le
Niggas change they whole style when the outlawz comin'
A million miles and thuggin'
Young Noble.I keep 'em buzzin'
While the rapture. capture this fuckin' style that I master
Bringin' terminal disaster. HIT YOU UP when I pass nigga

[Hook: 2Pac]
