[Intro: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Nigga ask about me x4

[Chorus x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a I'm a hustler homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a I'm a hustler homey
Nigga ask nigga nigga ask about me
Nigga ask nigga nigga ask about me

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Follow me, tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See, niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Chop, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned: word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' at Obama, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave, picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This thug life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me and have
A hundred motherfuckers at yo' do' with fo'-fo's!
Hahahahaha, yeah, nigga! Thug Life!

[Chorus x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a I'm a hustler homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a I'm a hustler homey
Nigga ask nigga nigga ask about me
Nigga ask nigga nigga ask about me

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Hahahaha! That's how we do it out here
On this underground real shit, nigga, it's the heat, nigga
Now, rewind this motherfucker
You know you can't help it
Nigga ask about me!

[Chorus x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a I'm a hustler homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a I'm a hustler homey
Nigga ask nigga nigga ask about me
Nigga ask nigga nigga ask about me
