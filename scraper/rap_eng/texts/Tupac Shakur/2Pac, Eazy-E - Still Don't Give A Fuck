[Hook: DJ Chop Up as Eazy-E]
Straight out the cemetery
Back from the dead
Eazy mothafukkin' E
'Bout to bust fuckin' lead
Chop Up & 2Pac
Back up in the cut
2016
Still don't give a fuck
Roll in the Fo', slow, lookin for the hoes
Smoke indo nigga [**record scratching**] out the window
Downing our 40s, Clowning our shortys
Tha mothafuckin' E puttin it down for the homies

[Bridge: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
1 2 3 into the 4
2 motherfuckin' Pac with the Glock to your knot [x4]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us from a MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Straight soldier, bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
See me striking down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna
Ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me, nigga
Zig-zagging through the freeway, race me, nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as Eazy-E]
Straight out the cemetery
Back from the dead
Eazy mothafukkin' E
'Bout to bust fuckin' lead
Chop Up & 2Pac
Back up in the cut

Still don't give a fuck
Roll in the Fo', slow, lookin for the hoes
Smoke indo nigga [**record scratching**] out the window
Downing our 40s, Clowning our shortys
Tha mothafuckin' E puttin it down for the homies

2 motherfuckin' Pac with the Glock to your knot [x8]
