With my eyes closed I can c
we have a chance 2 discover ecstasy
but the clouds of doubt have made u blind
but the clouds of doubt have made u blind
so u R afraid of the emotions that u may find
I know that u've been hurt before
but this is no excuse 4 u 2 ignore
the seed that cupid planted, in hopes that we would sow
This infant emotion deserves 2 breathe so why won't u let it grow
A neglected flower will wither and on its own it will surely die
But with honesty, passion, and mutual respect we can Soar Beyond The Sky
So please don't follow what u c follow the rhythm within your heart
Believe in me though u cannot c what lies within the Dark
