[Intro]
Ahhh
(Step a star, star, step a star)
(Everybody)
(Set it off)
(What ya want, what ya want)
(Border l-ine)
(What?)
(Border l-ine)
(What?)
(Border l-ine)
(What ya want, what ya want)

[Verse 1: Asu & Tek]
Another story of the territorial
Only difference from that one is this one is a-blazin' more of you
Have it and be ready, 'fore the confrontation
I stand in attack formation
Find the borderline and bring together One Nation

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
It's time to flash back to tre bags, buddha smoking Lambs bread
Need another case, like I need bullets in my damn head
What's that you speakin' on, fly-rican get your freakin' on
Brothers get to blastin' when they realize that the weekends gone
Your speakers blown 'cause my base blows
Those lyrics how I lace them when I brake foes
Now, we maintainin' players go through basic trainin'
Outlawz, bow down best the records out the game, set it off

[Interlude]
Set it off on the West y'all
The party's guaranteed to be like habitable
Most of all last call for alcohol that last all night
We got beats so it's all right, we all tight
(That's how we do it from the West to the East)
(You wanna hit that)

[Hook]
Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set if off, s-set it off, set if off, s-set it off
Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set if off, s-set it off, set if off, s-set it off

[Bridge]
One Nation under a group
Gettin' down just for the smoke of it
One Nation under a group
Nothing can stop us now

[Verse 4: Capital LS]
(Yo L what you dealin' with?)
I'm dealin' with that bullshhh
That off the wall shhh
That make that transmission start shhh
Well I was thinkin' along the lines
Ghetto rhymes, frontin' asses of all kinds
I ain't got the time for the Versace designs
Fakes ass crews claiming they controllin' crime
I think I'm finna show 'em what time it is
Greg Nice lets show 'em what time it is
Come on boy

[Verse 5: Greg Nice]
I collect the dough like Reuben Kincaid
Been a Hip-Hop junkie ever since fifth grade
Early to rise, we gotta get paid
Sometimes I rock afro sometimes I rock a fade
Send them hugs and kisses to the girls across the map
Don't be shy, baby lay on my lap
Keep my eye open just in case of booby-trap
Slap me baby I slap you back, back

[Hook]
Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set if off, s-set it off, set if off, s-set it off
Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set if off, s-set it off, set if off, s-set it off

[Bridge]
One Nation under a group
Getting down just for the smoke of it
One Nation under a group
Nothing can stop us now
Ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse 6: Buckshot]
Set it off from the sun rise
'Til the skies turn red like the Beady Eyes
And the bees realize the allies
Reflect bullets like alloys
P-p-p-port-port
Yo G, D-O-G raisin' the flag for pen's who brag
But keep the heat up in the back
But they quick to get jet lagged
They lag when they jet, when the G in the formation of a formed set
I bet, (I bet) thought the flame was lost
But the flame was tossed
To the boss dedicated to givin' the boys horse
Of course, take it out of proportion
If you with the course dedicated to floss the invincible force
Set it off

[Hook]
Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set it off, come on now, set it off come on
Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set if off, s-set it off, s-set if off, set it off

[Bridge]
One Nation under a group
Gettin' down just for the smoke of it
