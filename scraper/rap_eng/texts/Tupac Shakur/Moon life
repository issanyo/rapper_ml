(CLYDE MELODIES)

Verse 1:

Between the lines are blurry
We gon blow up up that shit early
Maybe we different, quirky
But to me tho, that ain't scary
Yes I got fucking glory
And if we get in shit like Dory
But it cool tho
Cos there's no need to worry
This shit cold like the north pole
No, I don't have A dark soul
And I pull on up on these assholes
Till I'm making these bankrolls, yeah
Until I'm making these bankrolls

Bridge:

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Verse 2:

Bars that I omit, uh
Money that I'm gon split, uh
Yeah I am a misfit, uh
But who give a shit, uh
On the flow I cause mayhem
I'm a God so worship, amen
Honestly, I'm just next gen
Making money for the next gen
Make moves like chess, uh
Bars, that mic spless, uh
