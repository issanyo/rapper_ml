[Intro]
Na na na
Na na na

[Hook]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the happy end, is me and my girlfriend

[Verse 1]
Where would you be, be without me
We'll never find out
What would I do, do without you
We'll never know now
Talking bout the lights, the dirt, the shit, that hurts
We're not gonna turn around
We're doing this for good, for worse
The gift, the curse, we're not gonna back down

[Hook](2x)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the happy end, is me and my girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel the sun, the waves, the wind in my face
The speed, the chase, na na na
I wanna feel the sun, the waves, just wanna cross the states
Making up as we go
That's how's gon' be, young wild and free
Not gonna slow down
Up to the max, until we crush, we're not gonna stop now

[Hook]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the happy end, is me and my girlfriend

[Hook](2x)
