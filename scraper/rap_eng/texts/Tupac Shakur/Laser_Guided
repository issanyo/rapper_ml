[Verse 1]
Laser guided
Blaze the phonics eating diamonds spitting up blades of vomit
Taste atomic
Seen a lil boy eat more then a fat man Reaganomics
Straight demonic, COINTELPRO
Noise cell phone, no day behind it
Sent vaccines with aids to Haiti
C.D.C dem hate the babies
Pew (pew)
Pew (pew)
Pew (pew)
Pew (pew)
Pew (pew)
Pew (pew)
Pew pew pew
Corporations
Devour, children
For profits
Emanations, not powers
If the shoe fit
Then rock it
When they raping
My momma
And I’m too sick
To stop it
All the shit I got left is my mind
My mind is my head and my head is my nine
My voice is my bullet bullet bam
Bullet, pull it pull it bam
Pull it
Pull it, bam (bam)
Bam bam bam bam

[Outro: 2Pac Shakur AKA 2Pac]
What I want people to know is that, don’t, don’t support the phonies
Support the real
You know what I mean?
How can these people be talking about how they so real and they don’t care about our communities?
How can they be talking about what they all this
You know, the hood bah bah
They don’t care about our communities
You know what I mean?
Listen to the words that people say in their lyrics
And tell me, if that’s some real shit
If that’s real to you
You know what I mean?
Listen to what they sayin
Don’t just bob your head to the beat
Peep the game
And listen to what I’m sayin
Hold us accountable for it
Na mean?
