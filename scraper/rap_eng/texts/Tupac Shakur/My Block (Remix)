[Intro]
Damn, take a ride to my block
My block, that's right! Hehe
'Round my motherfuckin' way

[Verse 1]
They got a nigga sheddin' tears, reminiscin' on my past fears
‘Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breast
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest, forever weary; my eyes stay teary
For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black-on-black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary, I'm gettin' worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested but open fire?
Life in the pen ain't for me ‘cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive?
The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a 4-5
My neighborhood ain't the same, ‘cause all these little babies goin' crazy and they sufferin' in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hop, ‘cause it don't stop – on my block

[Hook]
Livin' life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

[Verse 2]
Now shit's constantly hot on my block
It never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops
Black males livin' in hell, when will we prevail?
Fearin' jail, but crack sales got me livin' well
And in a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin' strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
God, help me, ‘cause I'm starvin', can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep ‘cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
'Til this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism ‘cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star everywhere I went
In my heart I felt alone, out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home – on my block

[Hook]
Livin' life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

[Verse 3]
And I can't help but wonder why so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's in a drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives – Mama, come inside!
‘Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community
But now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin' black life
But I can't blame the dealers; my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know you feel my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin' out, pickin' up game, sippin' cheap liquor
Gamin' the hoochies, hopin' I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin' strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin' phat but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin' focus – on my block

[Hook]
Livin' life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

[Verse 4]
And block parties in the projects lastin' way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break, right?
Used to play fight with my homies, but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend
In my mind I see the same motherfuckers ballin'
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggas understand this
Growin' up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
Tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is everybody know my name
Swear they all know me, and lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin' pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game – from my block

[Hook]
Livin' life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

[Outro]
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed away
From all the blocks that I'm from
112 street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin'?
183rd and Walt, my block – that's right
122nd and Morningside, my block – that's right
Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block – that's right
And the Jungle, Marin City, that's my block – that's right
Los Angeles, haha – that's my block too
Oakland, can't forget Oaktown – that's my block for sure
And all the other blocks around this motherfucker
Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago
All y'all niggas stay kickin' up dust
Represent the motherfuckin' block
