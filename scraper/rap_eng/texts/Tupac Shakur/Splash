[Intro]
STRAIGHT DESIGNER BABY

[Hook]
Bitch I pull up and I eat on yo ass
Niggas stay mad 'cause I’m gettin' that cash
All of diamonds they wet man
I make them bitches Splash
I heard ya nigga came quick flash
This shit don’t add up like it’s math
In the trap playin' Minecraft
Niggas know I’m really like that
All of my diamonds they wet
Aquifina drip straight of my neck
I’m Lil Tay yea nigga I flex
Got the Nina like check mate
Pull out the tip then I masturbate
That hoe not in my state
Told that hoe we can date
But that hoe still in my space like yuhhh

[Interlude]
Collecting the diamonds the minerals
Fuck a teacher
Fuck a principle
Lil Gore so dam original
Fuck Joey traps he an imbecile
Sike I don’t want no beef
I steal the clout like a thief
Shoot up yo block like I’m chief
Got yo mom lookin' in disbelief
I gotta go so I’m keepin' it brief

[Bridge]
See I don’t use salt I use Splenda
I’m gettin' them stacks like it’s Jenga Eatin'
That bitch and er placenta
Sike that’s not on my agenda
You got them bitches then send em
I don’t really recommend em
I’m finna go unfriend em

[Outro]
Bitch I pull up and I eat on yo ass
Niggas stay mad 'cause I’m gettin' that cash
All of diamonds they wet man
I make them bitches Splash
I heard ya nigga came quick flash
This shit don’t add up like it’s math
In the trap playin' Minecraft
Niggas know I’m really like that
