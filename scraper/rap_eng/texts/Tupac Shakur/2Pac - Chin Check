[Intro: 2Pac]
You know what time it is
You see any motherfucker with an "Outlaw" on his neck
Give him respect or get chin-checked

Music Stops

That's right nigga, set that shit
'Til they chin checking, we wrecking

Chin Check by N.W.A's instrumental plays

[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I'mma thug where I wanna thug
I'mma fuck who I wanna fuck
I'mma ride where I wanna ride
'Cause I'm a thug for life so I'm a thug 'til I die
I'mma thug where I wanna thug
I'mma fuck who I wanna fuck
I'mma ride where I wanna ride
'Cause I'm a thug for life so I'm a motherfucking thug 'til I die

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
(Chin checkin'!)
Now take a look inside my mind
That pen time made me wise but still I rise
Cause my "Ambitionz Az A Ridah" like land mines
Lyrics turn niggas into smithereens
Music so lethal, turn coliseums to murder scenes
I'm Makaveli the Don is what they tell me, I'm armed
I'm droppin' niggas like bomb
Get in that ass like a thong
Picture a felon in ya presence
Takin' bustas back to the essence
Tellin' my people peep my lethal message
Visions of me gettin' money got me in mash mode
Murderous motives for niggas stoppin' my cash flow
You can't fight it nigga, let go
Witness the sound, made ya bitch ass bow down to Death Row
Mama, these niggas got me fightin' these 3 Strikes
Showin' up in court fuck what you thought it's three nights
I put the game down first put my niggas up on it
Now we Amerikaz Most Wanted
Motherfucking chin checking!

[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I'mma thug where I wanna thug
I'mma fuck who I wanna fuck
I'mma ride where I wanna ride
'Cause I'm a thug for life so I'm a thug 'til I die
I'mma thug where I wanna thug
I'mma fuck who I wanna fuck
I'mma ride where I wanna ride
'Cause I'm a thug for life so I'm a motherfucking thug 'til I die
