[Chorus: Michel'le]
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waitin' for you
Until you get through
I'll be waitin'
You can run the streets with your thugs (don't look at me like that)
I been waitin' for you (that's right)
(let me go with my niggas)
Until you get through
I'll be waitin'

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now that I reminisce on my reflection
Close to perfection, as a nigga can get, without protection
You never tripped, and even though we had our fights
Dinner every night
I'm cussin' and fussin' like it's impossible, to get it right
Time alone, away from home, 'cause I can do, bad on my own
Lookin' for more than just another bone
Will I be happy now I'm grown
It seems we have a problem with jealously
'cause you interruptin' while I'm on the phone
I got some bidness to handle so baby understand
Can't spend my whole life up under you, I'm a grown man
Could you respect me if I wasn't driven
All up in prison or even worse just barely livin'
So sympathize 'cause my motto was baby pimp or die
Still strivin' for thuggin' 'til I die, so simplify
I need some time to get my head straight trust in me
When I finally be you'll be my queen
Just let me run the streets

[Chorus: Michel'le]
You can run the streets with your thugs (hahaha yea, nigga)
I'll be waitin' for you (let a nigga hang out with the homies, you know babe)
Until you get through (eh, a nigga that hang out more will come home and love you better)
I'll be waitin' (feel me baby)
You can run the streets with your thugs (let that nigga be free)
I'll be waitin' for you (don't have that nigga all up on you)
Until you get through (let me run the streets boo)
I'll be waitin'

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm choosin'
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples, how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up
Off of M.O.B
Fadin' me over somethin'
That's tellin' me don't run the streets

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
So tell me am I wrong?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made, and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3', and don't be late nigga
We hangin' out all night, while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in, 'cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die, I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle, just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, 'cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry just a little nigga, tryna make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen the rappin' or the drugs
But until then Give me love
And let me run the streets

[Chorus/Outro: Michel'le & (2Pac) ]
You can run the streets with your thugs (Let a nigga run the streets boo)
I'll be waitin' for you (I hate you, hehehe)
Until you get through
(I call you back, Just let me hang with my niggas)
I'll be waitin' (Why you actin' like that Michel'le?)
You can run the streets with your thugs (Huh, you know a nigga wanna kick it with this homeboyz and shit)
I'll be waitin' for you (I told you I was comin' back later on right)
Until you get through (You say you don't believe a nigga?)
I'll be waitin' (Just cook for a nigga)
You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
Until you get through
I'll be waitin'
(Pleaseeeeeeeee, make some of that shit you made last week)
(Some of them ribs and shit, I be back through later tonight)
(I'm a have some weed, we fin to drink some Hennessy and some Alize )
You can run the streets with your thugs...
