[Verse 1-2Pac]
Sometimes its hard, to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken, find so many babies screamin'
Cuz they seein destruction before they see a human bein
So they start smoking, we, will never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cuz they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, somebody elses child caught in gun smoke
And we, can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hopin please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need, of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open free, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise [rise]
My ghetto queen, rise [rise]
Don't be afraid to try [try]
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
Steady growin one day at a time...

[Verse 2-Nick Steele]
One Day at a time...
And pac said it best, I wish he was here right now
So he can see me steady wright my lyrics down
And see my lookin up, inspired by his poster
Chasin my dreams, he's putting my closer
Just trying to be great, like him and biggie
I hope the day I die, in heaven the kick it with me
But im just takin life, one day at a time
Steady chasin dimes, droppin bars and writin rhymes
I got these big ideas, droppin this album
But if someone shoots at the red light, what will be the outcome?
And you know what they say, only the good die young
If that's the case I guess I'll be dead by 21
Should I have some kids now, to carry on my legacy
Sorry lemme stop, my thought are getting ahead of me
So I'm gonna keep my head up, and eyes to the sky
Cause hero's are remembered...but legends never die
