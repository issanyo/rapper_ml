[50 Cent]
Yeah, Fifty, Ha Ha

I'm complex, difficult to understand
I don't know if it's me
Or just to make a brother mad
I wanna it in the morning
Bright and early I want it
I rise as the sunrise
Baby now get up on it
Give it to me good
Shawty work it like you should
You follow instructions
Then I follow instructions
The ultimate seduction
More kissing and touching
Feels super natural
First chance I'm at you

[Ice Cube]
To fuck with Ice Cube
You gotta shit talk, big talk, Crip walk
Bang hard, run yards, flip cars
Cause you fucking with millionaires
Big stars
Only clocking a grip will make our
Dicks hard
I come through when I handle my
Business
Like a goddamn menace
Niggas think I eat spinach
Cause you need a dentist
Whenever I finish
It's the Grin-ich, with a gang of
Lieutenants
WESTSIDE!

[50 Cent]
I like it when you freaky
I’m freaky
I’ll explore your body completely
Til you feel like you need me
Chest to chest
I reckon I get to kiss you in neck
Come correct to make a sweat
It’s making us wet
Say my name, say my name
Positions we change
I ain’t joking girl, I’m stroking
I ain’t playing no games
Jackpot, backshot
Still roughly taken
My pleasure is pleasing you
You should feel the same too

[2Pac]
Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the
Penitentiary, still ballin'
Riding on these niggas cause they
Lame
In a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug
Nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than
The drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to
Bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas
Hit em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger Lord forgive me if
I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, I'll fuck her
From the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's
Where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggas wonder
Why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see
Who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen
Many peers dead
Niggas still ballin

[Snoop Dogg]
Top Dogg, bite em all
Nigga burn the shit up
D-P-G-C my nigga turn that shit up
C-P-T, L-B-C
Yeah we hooking back up
And when they bang this in the club
Baby you got to get up
Thug niggas drug dealers
Yeah they giving it up
Lowlife, yo life
Boy we living it up
Taking chances while we dancing
In the party for sure
Slip my ho a forty-fo' and she got
In the back do'
Bitches looking at me strange
But you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker
Just a-swanging my hair
Bitch quit talking, Crip walk
Stay down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take
This dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down
For the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut
Yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of
Success
If you believe in the S you'll be
Relieving your stress
