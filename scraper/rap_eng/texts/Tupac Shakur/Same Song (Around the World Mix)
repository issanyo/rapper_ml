[Chorus]
Been all around the world, been all around the world
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
(Say what?)

All around the world same song (Say what?)
All, all around the world same song (Say what?)
All around the world same song (Say what?)
All, all around the world same song (Say what?)
All around the world same song (Say what?)
All, all around the world same song (Say what?)
All around the world same song (Say what?)
All, all around the world same song (Say what?)
All around the world same song (Say what?)
All, all around the world same song (Say what?)

[Shock G]
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singing, dinga-linging, funky beats ringing
Everybody's swinging in the place
As I kick the J-A-Z-Z-Y style
R&B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long 'til I'm gone
It's just the same old song

[Humpty Hump]
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kickin'
Sweat dripping, girlies in the limo eatin' chicken
Oops, don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezing, but still I'm pleasin' to all the slimmies
Pull out my Jimmy, time to get busy wit a Jenny
If it's good and plenty, don't you know
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I don't go nowhere without my Jim hat (Jim hat)
When I'm rapping, and if she's clapping
Then I'm strapping 'cause I'm smarter than that
Then girlie maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie (Why?), it's just the same old song

[Chorus]
All around the world same song (Say what?)
(It's the same old song)
All, all around the world same song
(Uh, it's just the same old song)
All around the world same song
(It's the same song) (Say what?)
All, all around the world same song (Say what?)

[Money B]
Money B, the freaky deaky, the squeaky meaky up and down
Well as a matter of fact, I'll be right back, I gotta take a leaky
So while I'm drainin', entertainin', but I got fame
And the bases I touch, too much for me try to be namin'
Ayo, you saw me on cable and grinned
I busted in and I was Gone With The Wind
Like Clark Gable, back in Oakland, it's the same old song
For Sporty Shorty, same freckles and hat
Drinkin' the same 40's

[Humpty Hump]
Hypothetical, political, lyrical, Miracle Whip
Just like butter, my rhymes are legit
'Cause I'm the Humpty, not Humpty Dumpty, but Humpty Hump
Here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a Humpty Hump

[Shock G]
Ah, shut up and just listen
Not dissin', don't get me wrong
But to me it's just the same old song
So just watch, 'cause my name is Shock, I like to rock
And you can't stop this
2Pac go ahead and rock this

[2Pac + (Humpty Hump)]
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls used to frown, say I'm down, when I come around
Gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me
Harass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
Same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
(Claimin' fame, must have changed, now that we became strong)
I remain, still the same (Why Tu'?) 'cause it's the same song

[Chorus]
Been all around the world, it's the same song
(Same old song y'all)
Been all around the world, it's the same song
(Ya know, ya know, check heads, ya know)
All around the world same song
(You don't stop; it's just the same old song)
All around the world same song
(Hibby-dibby, you don't quit)
Been all around the world, it's the same song
(Ah yeah, Humpty Hump in the house y'all)
All around the world same song
(And you know what? It's the same song)
Been all around the world, it's the same song (Say what?)
All around the world same song

[Organ solo]

Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song
Been all around the world, it's the same song

Been all around the world, it's the same song
All around the world same song
All, all around the world same song
All around the world same song
All, all around the world same song
All around the world same song
All, all around the world same song
All around the world same song
All, all around the world same song
