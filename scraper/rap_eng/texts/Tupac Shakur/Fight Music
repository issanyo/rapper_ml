[INTRO]
Omar Epps
You're crazy man!
(Makaveli)
You know what? When you said that last time
I was kind a trippin right, but now
You're right, I am crazy
But you know what else? I dont give a fuck

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Check it out
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinnin, I'm hellbound
Rather be buried than be worried, livin held down
My game plan to be trained heavy, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin in the cemetary
Cryin, I've been lost since my adolescence, callin to Jesus
Ballin as a youngster, wonderin if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitchin
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin warlike
Drop some shit, to make these stupid bitches jaws tight

[Hook]
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make thay mother fucking jaws tight now
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight
I got some niggas in my click that make thay mother fucking jaws tight
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make thay mother fucking jaws tight now
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight
I got some niggas in my click that make thay mother fucking jaws tight

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
The love is lost
The gloves is off so figure
What side you tryin' be on, the barrel or the trigger
A gang of niggas talking the talk
But ain't walking the straight line
They trying to hide behind the one time
Fuck being scared and constantly with security
I ain't afraid of whatever you faggots try to do to me
Shoot at me, try to corner me, orderlies try to get at me
Flip it like fake identities, sticking it to my enemies
And have you running for your motherfucking lives
Till they put me in a courtroom fighting for mine
The only reason I got foes that used to be friends
When niggas mumble under their breathe, I'm under their skin
I pray for the strength to handle what my city bring
Better stand for something, or your bound to fall for anything
The pitfalls, the pot holes, I spit flows that generate straight crack sales, we got those
One hitter quitter split a nigga like a embryo
Bring it to your crib, to your kids, to your video shoot
Give me the loot, my dudes all paid up
The half assed getting rat packed and sprayed up
You say "What?", speak up punk I can't hear you
Your transparent, Reynold's wrap, I'm seeing clear through
Pray for my down fall, talk like hoes
Mister Rap Rap the Gauge and kick in the door
And motherfuckers tryna say I can't rap no more
Like one monkey gonna stop the show
Lets go!
