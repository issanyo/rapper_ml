[Song perfomed by 2Pac]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke & why do ghetto birds die?
Before we learn to fly, somebody else's child caught in guns smoke
We can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die....
[machinegun shots/Sirens]
Until the day I die.....

[verse 2]
Though half our problems can be based on economical greed
A dying breed, addicted to weed to get G's
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens, rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers be wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies
We continue growing, one day at a time

We continue growing, one day at a time...

[verse 3]
Cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddeon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowing if I'm worthy
Living life thinking no man can hurt me...

We continue growing, one day at a time...
We continue growing, one day at a time...
We continue growing, one day at a time...
