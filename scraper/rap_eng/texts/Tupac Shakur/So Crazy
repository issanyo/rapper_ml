[Intro]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Have you really thought about your part in this participation
My prediction bloody murder similar to menstruation
Now in fairness to conversation
Cause it's your fate, so take the time to contemplate what you'll be facing
Talking that Hip-Hop shit
Don't get shot bitch
Cause you can tell
All in your click to eat Pac's dick
The clip's in, prepare for the motherfucking death blow
Cause every rapper in the industry is history it's Death Row
Not Bad Boy it's Westside
Before I make you bow before Tha Row
Just like them other hoes
The intricate designs of my lethal lines criminal rhymes
From the mind of a thug shaking state time
Take it to the next phase
You had your time to talk shit
Now bitchless busta's getting checkmated
These days motherfuckers talk shit and turn snitch
When you see 'em they ain't talking about shit
Westside

[Hook: 2Pac] 2x
So so crazy
Bitch I'll beat your boy bad
Standing in the midst of my comrades
Bitches can't fade me
Plotting but they ploy's crashed
Fucking with the midst of my comrades

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
So sick of you sum bitches
You sick ass sum bitches
You trick ass, bitch ass, big bad ass kissers
Wanna dick in your ass, but front like you love bitches
Aids, can't hide, closed doors cross dresser bitches
Take ya' put your mouth on the pistol
And make ya' suck it like a popsicle
Cock the handle back and give it to ya'
Get rid of all you niggas that shouldn't be here
Shit over crowding the system, fuck niggas
????? niggas that act bitching
Probably turn my Air Force One's Pro Shell
Probably gonna sue me, but I don't give a fuck
Every case I ever had settled out of Court
The charges got dropped cause they never showed up
Read between the lines, they never showed up
Chumps make it tough for Gangsta's like us
Cause every time you turn around, I'm fucking y'all up

[Hook] 2x
