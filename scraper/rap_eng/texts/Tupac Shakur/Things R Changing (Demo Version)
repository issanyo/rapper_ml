[Intro: 2Pac]
Dedicated to those people that uhh
For some reason look at us like role models
You do know that things change
It might not look like its a cool world right now
It's cool though, things get better
Believe me things change
Tell em about it

[Hook]
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, can you picture, young niggas in a rush to grow
Till hard timers in the pen, had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw him comin' - too busy bullshittin'
Caught him with his mouth runnin'; ain't this a bitch
They got me twisted in this game
The Feds and the punk Po-lice pointin' pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit - now shit is flipped
Cause niggas died over bullshit - it's not my dream
I'm seein' pictures of a broken man, no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man, young adolescents
In our prime live a life of crime, though it ain't logical
We hobble through these tryin' times, livin' blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homiez had to die before they got to grow
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer one love
To my thugs in heaven I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my firstborn, feel me
While trying to maintain through the pressure
Hustlers trying to make life better, for you and me
Nobody loves you when your stuck in the game
But maintain, because all things change, feel me

[Hook]
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Ever since my very first day on this earth I was cursed
So I knew the birth of a child would make my life worst
And though it hurt me, there was no distortion
Cause wild seeds can’t grow, we need more abortions
Quiet your soul
Cause you know what you had to do
And so they victims of the world that never came to
I understand there is a better day coming
Sometimes catch me slipping with the car runnin'
Driving at a dead end blinded
Ain’t no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasn’t able to breathe cause the family wasn’t able
Can’t blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
Cause in the game things change living up and down
Hard life got me walking with my head down
Wearing frowns was it meant to be, was I wrong
But i’ll never get to know so I carry on
It’s written for the young and dumb that wasn’t born
My words to my firstborn, feel me (feel me)

This for all the babies that died on the abortion tables
You know, all the mothers that didn’t have a choice
Things change

[Hook]
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
