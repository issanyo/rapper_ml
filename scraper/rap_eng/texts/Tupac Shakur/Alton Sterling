Ok they took me to the edge
These crackas murdered
Alton sterling
Pull a pistol out
And go and kill a cop on purpose
We the fucking Gods
They try to treat us
Like we worthless
Fuck you niggas thought
They hid our history on purpose

Pull a pistol out
And go and kill a cop on purpose!
Cuzo flee'd the scene
Before the video could surface
Member when they killed us
In the street like we was nothing
Member when they hung us
From them trees
I'm up to something

Pull a pistol out
And go and kill a cop in public
Call up CNN
And tell the media to suck it
I don't give a fuck about the ratings
Or the coverage
Do it for the times
My people crucified in public
Do it for the nine
My people bouta rise above it
