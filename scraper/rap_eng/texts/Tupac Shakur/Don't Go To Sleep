[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Pictures of plenty, sippin' my glass full of henny
Hands on my semiâ€”automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the track out, my lyrics never fail me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't begging for it
And you can love and you can hate it
But you can't ignore it, you can't be that ig-nor-ant
But you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If I'm fronting man you better come confront me for it

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
The pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt
I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh
That's that nigga wit' the fake, blaow!
Why you punch me in my face?
Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket

[Hook: 2Pac]
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Often, it's a young nigga, in a coffin
Tryin blossom, got shot down walkin, heh
Bleek a high to hot guy, turned cold
Bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose the life
Fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
How you smile at a momma when she lost a child?

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
I inhale strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like yay-yo
Nigga's pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy it fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war, livin' sucka free, get wit' me
Motherfucker don't sleep

[Hook: 2Pac]
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
