[Chorus]
(born in the days of a Criminal)
Born in the days of a Criminal
(Criminal, criminal, criminal)
Born in the days of a Criminal
(criminal, criminal, criminal)

[Verse 1]
Born in the the days of a criminal
Runnin' from the cops and can't let 'em see me
So I'm hopin' out the Benz
It's time to let the vallet step
Gotta make my ends, so business on the undertip
All coppers will get dropped, so tell them not to fuck with me
If Oakland gets too hot, I'm headed for Marin City
Though hunted like a fugitive, those punks will never capture me
TEC-9 on my side, oh stay in back of me
I'm black from head to toe, I move and there's a silence
The smoothest criminal, a lunatic for violence
So I be taken no shorts, when the shit get scandalous
Rippin' of this vest see, so nigga we can handle this
Run up and get smacked up, packed up and smacked down
I'm a playa, there's more in the J town
Bitches wanna jock, and run they hands all in my hair
Ho give up the cock, or you can get up outta here
I'm livin' like a mack, the narcist will be minimal
Niggas gettin' jacked with they cap peeled back
In the days, of a criminal

[Chorus]
(Criminal, criminal, criminal)
Born in the days of a Criminal (all in the days of a Criminal)
Born in the days of a Criminal, Born in the days of a Criminal
(all in the days of a Criminal)

[Verse 2]
I'm kickin' kilos but I start of with a quarter ounce
Servin' with weight cause, every little dollar counts
Makin' my grits and tryin' to get my mail on
So fuck a cop he get dropped if he steps wrong
I'm the bad guy, everybody points at me
But fuck 'em, all, as long as the tweakers happy
Makin' my cash flow, but how long will it last though
Pimpin' ain't easy but I still leavin' your ass broke
Pass the vapors as the papers will be comin' in
I give the cuts and give a fuck about being a friend
Bitch I'm a playa got no time to be bothered with
Havin' no babies in no long term relationships
Because a bitch will be a bitch no matter what you say
That's why I fuck 'em, bust a nut, and I'm on my way
Soon as I finish I'll be glad I even fucked a whore
Cause she'll be blowin' up my beeper before I shut the door
But fuck a bitch I keep my mind on my drink cause yo
That's how I'm livin' in the days, of a criminal

[Chorus]
(Criminal, criminal, criminal)
It's the menace of Marin
(all in the days of a Criminal)
It's the menace of Marin
(Criminal, criminal, criminal)
It's the menace of Marin
(all in the days of a Criminal)

[Verse 3]
It's the menace of Marin, I kill, I kill again
Ain't nothing funny about the game the game I'm rollin' in
You got a problem with it, Mr. handle yours
I ain't no joke, I'll have you broke down to your draws
I'm trigga happy and I give less than a fuck
Love me or hate me I'mma show nough rip shit up
It's Mr. nothin', nice on the mic stand
Mic in the left and the zest in my right hand
I took a puff had enough now, hold up
If that was endo, niggas gettin' rolled up
You think not, get dropped we can handle this
Cause 2Pac brain locked on the cannabis
Days are dangerous, shoot 'em but you can't miss
I never trip off your bitch cause she scandalous
Now come and get a good look at the crook, who
Lives his life in the streets of the jungle
Some call me animal, tell me how you figure though
Put 'em in the nimp, in the days of a criminal

[Chorus]
(criminal, criminal, criminal)
(all in the days of a criminal) (born in the days of a )
(criminal, criminal, criminal)
(all in the days of a criminal) (born in the days of a criminal)
(criminal, criminal, criminal)
(all in the days of a criminal)
(criminal, criminal, criminal) (born in the days of a criminal)
