[Intro: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
It's my niggas!
It's my niggas!
It's my niggas! (what!?)
It's my niggas! (what!?)
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
It's my niggas!
My niggas in the streets don't sleep
With the piece, police want us 6 feet deep
It's my niggas!
We bleed together, and eat together
When the Po' say freeze, we never
It's my niggas!
I got your back if you stuck
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh
It's my niggas! (what!?)
It's my niggas! (what!?)
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh
It's my niggas!
(DJ Chop Up Exclusive)

[Verse 1: Young Noble]
Ayo, I been through a lot with my niggas, and still we strong
Damn, Yak was my nigga, I wish he wasn't gone
The mission we was on, to shake the world
But now, I'm screaming fuck it, clutching my baby girl
An eye for an eye, so the next one of my soldiers to go?
Everybody gotta die fo' sho'
We been, struggling too long for you bitches to front
We been, hustling too long for us not to come up
Gotta be touched by an angel, I feel to love
Outlawz, we was taught by the original thug
I ain't shit without my homeboys
And you ain't shit without your's
Where would I be without my Outlawz? (outlaw!)
Probably working nine-to-five? Nah, life of crime
In the kitchen, probably sniffin' one of my own dimes
Rewind time, my childhood memories
Same bitches, same enemies

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
It's my niggas!
My niggas in the streets don't sleep
With the piece, police want us 6 feet deep
It's my niggas!
We bleed together, and eat together
When the Po' say freeze, we never
It's my niggas!
I got your back if you stuck
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh
It's my niggas! (what!?)
It's my niggas! (what!?)
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh
It's my niggas!

[Verse 2: DJ Chop Up]
Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin' since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
Who wanna see me in 8D? Fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah forever
My niggas be together (I love my niggas to death)

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
It's my niggas!
My niggas in the streets don't sleep
With the piece, police want us 6 feet deep
It's my niggas!
We bleed together, and eat together
When the Po' say freeze, we never
It's my niggas!
I got your back if you stuck
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh
It's my niggas! (what!?)
It's my niggas! (what!?)
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh
It's my niggas!

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Huh, my niggas, puttin' it down every where I go down everywhere I go
It's my niggas, gettin' niggas after every show
Where the fuck would I be without me and my dogs?
Back to back, still scrapping, knee deep in the fog
Y'all niggas is bitches, I don't walk the street with 'em
My niggas, when I'm broke, I can eat with 'em
Show and beef with 'em, holdin' heat with' em
Get money down south and rip the whole east with 'em
It's my niggas that kill, my niggas that will
Get that blood money for sure, my niggas is real
And when we rhyme we got full control of the wheel
Napoleon, Kastro, Young Noble, and Mill
Edi, Killa, Kadafi, Makaveli, and Quill
Scarred this rap game for life, somebody tell me the deal
My niggas, ah
It's my niggas, uh
Them my niggas, what
They my niggas, uh
These my niggas

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
It's my niggas!
My niggas in the streets don't sleep
With the piece, police want us 6 feet deep
It's my niggas!
We bleed together, and eat together
When the Po' say freeze, we never
It's my niggas!
I got your back if you stuck
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh
It's my niggas! (what!?)
It's my niggas! (what!?)
'Cause nobody else'll give a fuck, huh
It's my niggas!

[Outro: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I love my niggas (DJ Chop Up Exclusive)
Watch out, the police, nigga!
Pol√≠cia! Watch out, nigga, fuckin' police!
