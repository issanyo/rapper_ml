[Intro: The Beatles]
It's alright
It's alright
It's It's
It's alright

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
They'll never take me alive, I'm getting high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckers, time to die
Even as a youngster causing ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kicking up dust
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
Smoking weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless rolling down the freeway swerving, don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do?
I had to feed my fucking family, what else could I do
But be a thug, out slanging with the homies
Fuck hanging with them phonies in the club
Got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive bys
Why do we die at an early age
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't going back to court
So fuck what you thought, I'm drinking Hennessey
Running from my enemies will I live to be 23
There's so much pain

[Hook: The Beatles]
It's alright, it feels like years since it's been here
It's alright, it's been a long cold lonely winter
It's alright, it feels like years since it's been here
It's alright, it's been a long cold lonely winter
It's alright

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense, going to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleeping all day, no getting my dick licked
Hanging with the goodie-goodies lounging in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Sucking on her chest just to stop my fucking hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

[Hook: The Beatles]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
They got me mobbin like I'm
Loc'ed and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - b-b-blaaastin
I'm a nut an' drinkin Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards
Want to kill me in my sleep, I'm real they cannot see
And everyday is just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin' loc
Don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother I'm trapped
I'm kickin dust up
Ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
Until they kill me
I'll be livin this life
I know you feel me
There's so much pain

[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

[Hook: The Beatles]

[Outro: The Beatles]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
