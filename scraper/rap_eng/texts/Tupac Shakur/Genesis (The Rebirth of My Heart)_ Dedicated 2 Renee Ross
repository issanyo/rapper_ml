First there was nothing
Not even the Faint echo of a song
Loneliness was daily 4 me
until u came along
There was a gleam of STARS in your eyes
I thought I'd  never feel this way again
But u were the one 2 reach into my heart
And find in me a Friend
I could not ignore the magnetism
that I felt when u were near
And any problems plaguing my mind
would suddenly disappear
It was the rebirth of my heart
The day u became my friend
Because I knew from the moment
I held u that I would find love again
