[Intro: Money B, and 2Pac]
Yeah, its another classic cassette, Goin Way Back Show, exclusive you know what it is
What you won't do... do for Love...
Hey yo let me rock this, let me rock this, let me rock this, check it out, check it out
Let me tell you a story about my homie and his girl, you know what I'm sayin'
Some Love triangle type shit, we goin' rock this shit right here
So dope beat to you know what I'm sayin'
We about to run through this
So yo check it out
Smooth you drop the vocals, and I'll smoke his ass

[Verse 1]
I lay awake tonight because I want to be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see her, the feeling gets stronger
We sit a bit closer and stare a lot longer, huh
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Went to mutter I stuttered cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win
Cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, I'm fallin' for his girlfriend
It's like a trap that I'm sinkin' in to
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin' cause I'm thinkin' of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
Tryin' to shake it but the feelin' comes right back
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin' me sayin' to come over
What do I do, you make it hard for me to cheat
What I won't do for Love

[Ad-lib]
Yeah yeah yeah
What you won't do
Ah yeah
2Pac in the house

[Verse 2]
Scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit, and pray hopin' the beatings will go away
It wasn't always a hit, and run relationship
It used to be Love happiness, and companionship
Way back when he treated you good
Moved you up to the hills out the ill's of the ghetto hood
You felt as though you owed him your life
It felt right so you said yes now your really his wife
He got you pregnant but the baby just wouldn't live
Something she couldn't give so things got negative
But that's when a stranger came through
And he's pesterin' you about the things you couldn't do
You say your happy at home, right?
But that's just a lie, as you cry through a long night
Until I came to rescue you, makin' you chose
What you won't do for Love

[Outro]
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, in the house, what you won't do for Love
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, what you won't do
