I tell em. Give me your all or nothing at all, they only try to stand you up so they can pray for your falls, not there during practice but show up when you ball, suppose to be there when you need em but don't answer your calls, staring in the mirror of my homies passenger seat, it said that cha enemies might appear closer than you think, im stressed tf out but nobody will pass me a drink, so im smoking and hoping that shit will change when I blink, but nah, seem like my family just don't care, I try talkin but they just don't hear, Im to the point wear, I think that I should end it, cuz my mind lost its defenses, im bottling all my tension, but that ain't none of y'all business, n back then I used to have a big crew, I cut it to about two, but they turnin fake too, if you in my past you not invited to my future, most the time a backstabber is the closest friend to ya
