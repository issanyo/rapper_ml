[Verse 1: 2Pac]
See, it ain't easy being me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it’s always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to what you do and keep the game up
'Cause thangs change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin’ to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes
I try hard but I'm strugglin' with every breath
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like trying to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew

[Chorus: (2Pac) & Live Squad]
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(I thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(You know)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can’t make it home
I’ll whisper thangs in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, or can you hear me
It seems to me that you’re jealous
'Cause I'm hustlin' and making money with the fellas
In the back streets tryin’ to track me, baby, hold up
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
'Cause your attitude has changed and you're actin' a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back
Leave, ain't nothin' left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too, you know

[Chorus: 2Pac & Live Squad]
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(Thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(You know)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(And I thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I sit alone in my room drinking, without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see, when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
It's in your head that I'm makin' love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax, 'cause baby right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear, baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react to let me know you feel me
'Cause everything I'm givin' to you is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

[Chorus: 2Pac & Live Squad]
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(And I thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(And no matter what I do)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(Thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(When I'm hangin' with the crew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(I thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(And no matter what I do)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(You know)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(Yeah)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(Thug Life, baby, steady thuggin')
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too

[Outro/Collision: 2Pac]
Ay, so you remember that next time you sweatin' me when I'm on the road, baby
Thugs get lonely too, we ain't gotta go through all this bullshittin' ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me
You know
