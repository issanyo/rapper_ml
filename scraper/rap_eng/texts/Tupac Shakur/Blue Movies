[Intro: 2Pac Shakur & Mach-Hommy]
Niggas ain’t shit till I want some pussy
You know what I mean?
And the niggas is being like
You know, “these black bitches ain’t shit, or these white bitches ain’t shit”
Uh huh
For me, I can’t do that
I can’t turn my love on [?]
No matter if they send me to jail or talk shit, they really piss me off

[Mach-Hommy]
He was a nasty motherfucker
Looking at the [?]

[Verse 1]
I gave the ribs
She became the rib
I sprayed the kids and she ate the kids
I tasered it, she shaked a bit
Shook a lot, and she prayed for dick
I payed for it
Spend time
No bread now my bread mines
She supplicate, I suffocate
Choked a bitch with my love for wave
Confront the hoe, bag her down
Show how the G code wrap around
She feel safe, then scared
Up and down when I breastfed
She squirm awkward, firm buttocks
Sweat that muh-fucker perm process
Soul protect
I stroke her death
Get up in that bitch, whoa soul connect
She hauling ass, I’m staying put
I don’t play her, I just spray and tuck
Leave em stinkin’, leave em thinkin’
And what kinda Mack Truck just beat the pink in
Swerved off
Swerve off
Mach not mack, I murder
Ask about me
Smash your auntie
Your cousin and your momma too, mad salami
Fuck that
Suck this
You got something I fucks with
Good vibes, good vibes
You give a nigga wood now look ma
I said you give a nigga wood now look ma
I said you give a nigga wood now look ma

[Outro]
Look at what you did
Look at what you doin
Look at what you did, what you did, what you doin
Look at what you did
Look at what you doin
Look at what you did, what you did, what you doin
