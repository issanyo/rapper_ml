[Intro: 2Pac & Skepta]
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Fuck the other side
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
It's all Boy Better Know
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Send out to the mandem in the circle
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Yeah, dun know MSM
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
'Till the coffin goes in the ground, it's us man
Like this, go on then!
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died

[Verse 1: Skepta]
My little finger's for my pinky
My ring finger's for my girl
Index finger to finger your girl
Middle finger's the one I'm sticking up to the world
Fuck the other side
Fuck your music, I don't wanna show no interest
From now on, I'm only fucking with my family
And I don't mean incest
If I'm poppin' tags, they're poppin' tags
Too many man wanna beg friend
Talk about wah gwan fam and I'm like
Can't you see my mum needs help with the shopping bags?
All for one, one for all
Cause a lot of haters wanna see me fall
But we've got the game locked
So the TV's the only place you'll see me, fool

[Verse 2: KJ]
Fuck youts that talk on a bait one
Keep quiet, get paid, but I'm not a fake one
Fuck an indirect, I'll throw a straight one
Carry on talking shit, I'll violate one
I move funny on a Catherine Tate one
Cause I do illegal shit and get paid, son
My team get bills, you can't even make one
Come and check me and I'll show you how to baid, son
Show you how to baid on a quick one
Shot a box and not have to flip one
Do a daytime move on a quick one
Sun comes down, do a move on a quick one
You can't take my clique for a prick, son
Boy Better Know will move on a sick one
Fuck that, got no love for the other side
Only got one team, and it's this one

[Hook: 2Pac]
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died

[Verse 3: B Live]
You man are peak, we're peaking but not forced
KJ, pass me the duck
Skeppy, pass me the pancakes and the plum sauce
L-L, L-L, big man ting
I don't care what clique man's in
Cuh when the murdering starts, nobody wanna
Chat or act like a G when it's beef 'cause of hatred
And the clique goes in
So let me kick some facts for them
Diss anyone in my family tree
You'll be waking up 3 in the night ting
But nothing like Maximum does
I'm slightly alight, you'll be screaming
"Where's my brother?", no Wiley in sight
So this ain't a singalong
I'll put shit in your chest like silicone

[Verse 4: Jme]
I ain't got no love for the other side
Straight up blunt like a butter knife
If you're not mandem, then jam then
My friends? I don't wanna see you round them
We keep it in house like fridge and cooker
You're an outsider, you're an onlooker
You're not famalam
Violate? Get dupsed by manaman
Trust me, look in the eyes
You can see that they idolise
Us man have fun over here
Not like these other MC guys
Please, do your ting, I'll do mine
I don't need your help 'cause I'm doing fine
Me and my team are right at the top
Respect man and don't blur the line

[Hook: 2Pac]
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
