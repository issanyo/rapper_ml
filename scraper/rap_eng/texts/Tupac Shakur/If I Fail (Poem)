If in my quest 2 achieve my goals
I stumble or crumble and lose my soul
Those that knew me would easily co-sign
There was never a life as hard as mine
No father - no money - no chance and no guide
I only follow my voice inside
If it guides me wrong and I do not win
I'll learn from mistakes and try 2 achieve again.
