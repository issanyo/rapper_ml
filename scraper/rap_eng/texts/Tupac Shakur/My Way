[Intro]
Hell motherfuckin' yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Cooley

[Hook]
They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way

[Verse 1]
Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin' at sixteen
On the scene watchin' fiends buggin'
Kickin' up dust with the older G's
Soakin' up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot
I learned not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes
Taught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions
While other suckers was guessin', I was gangsta sexing
Elementary wasn't meant for me
Can't regret it I'm headed for the penitentiary
And cuttin' class and I'm buckin' blastin' straight mashin'
Mobbin' through the overpass laughin' (hahahaha)
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out
No doubt, they jealous of a nigga's clout
Tell me lord can ya feel me?
I keep my finger on the trigger
Cause some nigga tryna to kill me

[Hook]
They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way

[Verse 2]
Tell me lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellraiser can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin' to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the poor babies rushin' into early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear lord I live the life of a thug hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock
Tell me lord can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggas burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row

[Hook]
They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way

[Verse 3]
Dear lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin' please come save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' "die motherfucker!" and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover!
Aww shit, "Thug-Life motherfucker, duck quick!"
Now am I wrong if I am, don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Dear lord if ya hear me tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it
It shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl
Killed Latasha
Now I'm screamin' fuck the world!

[Hook]
They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way

[Outro]
Yeah
That nigga who hold it down for Uptown, hahahaha!
That's how we do it out here
On this underground real shit nigga
This the heat nigga
Now rewind this motherfucker
You know you can't help it
Deadly combination, bwoy!
