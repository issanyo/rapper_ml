[Intro: 2pac]
... so far from where I am now in four years, God willin I'm alive, it's on
I guarantee you we will, WE WILL have our own political party. And it won't be just for Black people - it's gon be for Mexicans, it's gon be for Mexicans, it's gon be for Black people, it's gon be for Armenians...

[Verse 1]
Visions of Sayat Nova starin at me
And every individual that was murdered in my family
I'd go back in time, wishin that I could save ya
I'm just my people's voice sprinkled wit some hood flavor
Raised offa Black Sounds of Freedom
If the Whole World is Africa, take me back to Eden
They callin me a terrorist but givin me no reason
Can you even tell me which people were the first Christians?
Armenians
But that's life, ces't la vie
This the Hiii Power remix, HYE
Thinkin bout When We Were Kings, like the great Ali
But the truth is, you don't know a thing bout me
Becuzzzz, (ha)
It ain't in ya books homie
Pick up game, Lesane Parish Crooks told me
I think the president is smokin some weed, bumpin this beat
And trippin off my people's misery
Got some real advice on my Vegas trip
From the homie K. Lamar, he said find your own niche

[Hook: with Kendrick Lamar]
And this right here is {HYE POWER}
Aper nothin less than {HYE POWER}
From the heart, beat this
Food for thought, eat this
I mean this dish is
Kirk Kerkorian ownin Vegas and makin billions
{HYE POWER}
{Throw ya hands up for HYE POWER}

[Verse 2]
Visions of Hrant Dink starin at me
While he shot up in the middle of the street, bleedin badly
I think he tryna tell me somethin
There'll never be peace, what's the point? Like a belly button (brraaat!)
Now a man wit blood on his hands shouldn't throw stones
Or feel the wrath of God, word to Bishop Noel Jones
Happy birthday, for all the gun powder and the dirt they
Threw on us, no ambulance, no doctor and no first aid
Frightenin, like Mike Tyson
When the man went insane and started bitin off ears
And I'm just workin round the clock
Before my time is up, like the homie down the block (block block)
If only this story had a happy endin
Could u imagine that Mr. John Lennon?
Who said Obama would accept the Genocide?
All we have is hope so ill never let it die
Got some good advice on my Vegas trip
Chopped it up wit K Dot, he said find your own niche

[Hook: with Kendrick Lamar]
This right here is {HYE POWER}
Apeh nothin less than {HYE POWER}
From the heart, beat this
Food for thought, eat this
I mean this dish is
A reminder that Genocide couldn't kill this
{HYE POWER}
{Throw ya hands up for HYE POWER}

[Bridge: Alori Joh, Kendrick Lamar & Nazo Bravo]
{Everyday we fight the system just to make our way
We've been down for too long, but thats all right
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life
Na-na-nah
Everyday we fight the system, (fight the system)
(Never liked the system)
We've been down for too long, but thats all right
Na-na-nah}

[Verse 3]
Who said Obama would accept the genocide?
All we have is hope, so ill never let it die
Realistic-ly it's nothin 'gainst him
One man can only do so much in a system, but
How would a black man feel?
If America had said, that slavery wasn't real
And tried to do everything that they could just to cover up
All the history that they drank from another cup
That's how my people really feel forreal
Against the Turkish government, been at war for years
What we have right here are some crooks
Changin up the names of the cities that they took
It's a Cole world
This one is for the kids across the whole world
And all my peers doin bids up to no good
Plus the lawyers and the doctors
We the lost tribe that they've always killed but never conquered
Got some true advice from the Compton kid
Who inspired this, and said find your own niche

[Hook: with Kendrick Lamar]
This right here is {HYE POWER}
Apeh nothin less than {HYE POWER}
From the heart, beat this
Food for thought, eat this
I mean this dish is
Ararat and Massis mountains off in the distance
{HYE POWER}
{Throw ya hands up for HYE POWER}

[Rideout]
Did you ever think that we would get so far?
From the place we used to call home, oh Lord!
Do you still believe that we gon be alright?
Can't predict the future but I tell no lies

[Repeat Rideout]
