[Intro: Reporter]

You may remember hearing about a murder
In Las Vegas 2 months ago
In which a popular and controversal performer
Was shot
Gang land style and killed
It's a murder that hasn't yet been solved
But the investigation has invited closer scrutiny
Of the music industry
(Fades away)

[2Pac]
Them same mother fuckers wanta murder me
Them same mother fuckers
Them same mother fuckers wanta murder me
(Y'all mother fucking crazy)

[VERSE 1]
Crazy
I got a work with what you gave me
Claiming I'm a criminal
When you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this holocaust
Heading for my grave G
I told Sam he can fuck the war
& got a busted jaw
For saying fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm Mad check the records
What's a nigga got a do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm Getting tested
& if I dont say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zested
I keep a vest on my chest
Incase the cops are getting restless
Walk around ready to light shit up
& since my life is fucked
Some say I'm slighty nuts
Buck buck is the sound as i mooova
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer
I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see whooo's realer
Now them same motherfuckers want a murder me
& i wonder if the lord ever heard of me

Chorus
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me
(they know everyday when I'm breathing it's it's...)
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me
(Everytime i speak i want the truth to come out)
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me(You know what I'm saying everytime i speak i dont want shit)
& i wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot so I'm doing what i do
& don't say shit
Until you've walked in my shoes
