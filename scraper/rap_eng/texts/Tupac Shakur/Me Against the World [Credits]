Thank you to everyone who supported me during my time of need. You know who you are! And to all who remain loyal to me, I won't let you down. No thank you to all the bustas, cowards and fake homies who showed me the depths of jealousy, envy and greed. My apologies to all my fans and friends that I turned my back on and didn't remain true to. In '95 it will be rectified. Much love to my family and extended family. To my record company and all my lawyers-Thanks!
