Time to question my lifestyle, look how I live
Smokin weed losin arts like it ain't no thing
So I abide by, lie down and I don't got the skill to
Nobodys cares bout em, so what can they do?
Faced with heavy demons, people can't see what our kids is seein
Guess they was cursed since birth, product of curse hurts
Even our birthdays is cursed days
Born sick in the first place, the worst days
I wanna see these hoods in peace
With no more beefs and crooked cops, no more killings on our streets
And we needa start makin changes
It's up to us to clean up our streets, it's just a shame
Too many murders, too many killings and too many less cares
Just moved back to my old school these been my niggas for years
They all got a little friendly, but I always tell em
Keep ya head up and It'll all be ok
And then you'll see better days

[2Pac]
Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinking 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey, Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

Just now I got depression, never would've guessed it
That in my future years, I'd be stressing?
Some think us ghetto sick and corrupted
But what about the real niggas and women that I grew up with
I tell em keep ya head up and don't do wrong
But all them always smoking committing crimes all day long
Life's horrible so they gotta cope
Wish they had what I had, cause they losing hope
I crush on this girl and I love her but I'm so broke, and I'm kinda shy
I've been hurt by too many different faces
Thinkin about her love til the daylight
Plus I'm wakin up for school, can't sit and vent
Guess it's time to see if it's true what I really dreamt
I can't understand her and I'm afraid
So many guessing while I'm stressing
Searching for those better days

[2Pac]
Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinking 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey, Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

Now me and you was real cool, but damn I was a fool
Since back in preschool, we was friends, me and you
Hardly together or loving, we stayed faded
Committed with these bitches and I wanna fade it
Convicted with sin, mess with me, or I'd mess wit em  
I got the young girls droolin when I'm rollin
Came back from the dark, smoked weed, while mourin  
I can't seem to get her piece off my heart, it's getting torn apart
I was locked in my head, and people made my life a wreck
I wrote these songs to get my thoughts in check
Thinkin bout life as well, and it's just hell
Survivin back where I grew up, I'm just hopin God won't let me fail
At life, I think I'll be cool
I'm settled down, got my family, tryna to pass school
Every once in awhile, I'ma reminisce
And wonder why my life ever came to this
I miss my better days

[2Pac]
Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinking 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey, Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
