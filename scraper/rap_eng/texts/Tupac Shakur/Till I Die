Hook 1: 2Pac]
When I be thuggin' til I die
When I be thuggin' til I die
When I be thuggin' til I die
Til I die
Til I die
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip ‘cause, bitch, I love to scrap
I went from rocks to zines, writin' raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks
Now they all want to sue me
SO FUCK 'EM ALL!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Tech's in the place, everybody get mainy
Punks better cuff your lady, can't nobody tame me
Blame me, for keepin' her runny eyed rainy
Ladies used to hate me, now they comin' out they panties
Girls on the jock (Check), pocket full of socks (Check)
Got a fat knot (Check), somethin' gone squat (Yeah)
Down, puttin' it down, down for the block? (Yes)
Tryin' to be hot, but you flop
Wanna be shot to the top but you not DWAMN!!!
I ain't never seen so much green
Than when I seen when my team hit the scene
It must be a dream, hit the stage, everybody holler
Gettin' throwed, rippin' shows for a bigger dollar
Father, I don’t wanna leave nobody toothless
Cause they greedy in the middle of what I do best
You finna' to see me in the TV with a few guest
We 'bout to bubble baby, get you waterproof vest

Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back

[Verse 2: 2Pac + Young Noble]
I got glad bags with enemies, cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessy, so they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick 'em and holla
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For my profit pick my Glock up
I'm bustin' with self-defense, you see
Poppin' nobody got 'em, holla
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal
Niggas is too through, true to the game
I claim Outlaw riders, we give a fuck what they try, I'm…
‘Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain?
Kick back, lil' nigga, and watch the game

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity
