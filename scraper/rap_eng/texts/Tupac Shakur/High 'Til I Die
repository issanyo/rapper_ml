High 'til I die
Loced 'til they smoke me, the shit don't stop
'Til my casket drop
I'm high 'til I die
Loced 'til they smoke me, the shit don't stop
'Til my casket drop
I'm high 'til I die
Loced 'til they smoke me, the shit don't stop
Shit don't stop

[Verse 1]
Game rules, ain't got time for fools
Money on my mind, so my nine rules
Time to, make weight, niggas gettin' crazy paid
And hatin' bitches for the games they play
So nigga, pull quick, but better be quicker than the next motherfucker on the, trigger
'Cause I'm static, startin' to be a fuckin' havoc
Gotta keep my automatic, or get my ass kicked
When I'm in traffic, it's kinda rough and, I drive a bucket
Live the Thug Life nigga screaming, fuck it
I love to throw my middle finger to the police
And no bucks, no justice, no peace
I'm smokin' blunts 'til I pass out (coughing)
Yeah, nigga, gettin' assed out
Rollin' in my nigga's glass house
Drivin' fast, talkin' to bitches, whippin' cash out
I'm with my niggas, so fuck the suckers, I'm buckin' bustas
Smokin' chronic motherfuckers causin' ruckus
It's the last of the drank, pull over
Can't hear a damn thing sober

Loced 'til they smoke me, the shit don't stop
'Til my casket drop
I'm high 'til I die
Loced 'til they smoke me, the shit don't stop
Shit don't stop

[Verse 2]
Lord help me save me, mama keep prayin'
For a young motherfucka, tryna duck an early grave
In the city where you can't tell the fakes from the snakes
Enemies from phonies, friends from your homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waitin' to jack
He don't know I got a Glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a mutha fuckin' Thug disease
Cravin' beats like they motherfuckin' drugs to me (Hey)
What's up with bitches tryin' to screw me, do me 'cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me, but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a busta
And with my Glock, I'm a plotin' ass rotten mutha fucka (Hey)
Don't let that movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screamin' Thug Life nigga when I do ya
It's the last of the drank, pull over
Can't hear a damn thang sober 'cause I'm
