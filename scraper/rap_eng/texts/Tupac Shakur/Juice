[Verse One: 2Pac]
Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
And freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggas know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggas trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries

[2Pac]
This nigga is scared

[Big L]
Ain nobody scared man I just told you how to do this anymore

[2Pac]
Fuck that shit
You're goin Saturday night and that's it

[Verse Two: Big L]
Ayo, I shoulda been out
I'm deadly when I pull the pin out
Keep frontin', I'mma try yo' chin out
I knocked a lot of men out
I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
It's either that or I'mma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cuz yo' career's in the ninth innin'
It's over now, nigga, leave the game
I'm from the danger zone where emcees get slain
We're thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
We're niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT your bitch rode me
First day home I dived in it
Left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
Emcees I squash and disgrace
It's all about the Benjis So why your bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin'
Mad singles wit' a fifty on top
L tryin' to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cuz they really were hot
Rap game, heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer wit' us
Niggas wanna be L, ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail you'll wear a shirt sayin' "Free L!"
What

Oh shit
Yo be careful with that man it's loaded
I'll hold on to the gun
Why should he hold on to the gun?
Cuz I already got it motherfucker!

[Verse Three: Big Pun]
It's not a game it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall, when I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin
Unless you got my ends, I'mma make you twins with the Headless Horseman
Hell extortion, sell your soul, live your dreams
Don't pay the cost then [bam bam] say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Give me your fear, murder, respect, beer, honies and sex want here
I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin with Chris - fuck Pun - dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, go 'head Decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggas I keep, I put em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill
You fuckin with reel to reel, rap axe maniac
Sound bwoy killer, hack hack chain-react
Two for one - double the death, same price
What would Big say? "Huh, you know that ain't right"

Yo you got the juice now

(DJ Cinema)

Excuse me partner can you keep that shit down you see me watching TV

Made it ma ... made it ma
Top of the world [top of the world] top of the world

If you gotta go out ... that's how you go out. That motherfucker took his destiny in his own hands [Echo]
