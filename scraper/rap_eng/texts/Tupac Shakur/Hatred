[2Pac]
I'll be on North side
Keepin' my peace back in my piece
Smokin' sense
To deal with this inner city stress
I know I'm blessed
But these demons are out to curse me
Do anything that they can
To try and hurt me
Good Lord whatever happened
To compassion and brotherly love
Cause now there's hate in every action
I try to maintain
Be a player in this game
But I seem to keep losin'
Maybe it's the strategy I'm usin'
Or maybe it's the friends that I'm choosin'
Jealous associates
Guarantee to cause confusion
Is it your goal to hide truth?
It's an illusion, develop my trust
Then leave me stranded in the bust
I feel like pullin' out my gun
And bustin' on these fakers
Two bit punks, perpetrators
And player haters
But I gots to keep my eyes
On the prize
Watch me bubble like champagne niggas
Watch me Rise
Beyond haters

[Lucky Luciano]
I try to escape but everywhere I go to try and keep my focus
But a world without hatred, is like the projects without roses
No matter how high I get I can't escape the sense of it
And all you hatred ass haters always making me sick
I'm trying to find a place where I can go where hatred ain't allowed
To show everybody about money, and they all try and blow
I'm trying to find a place, where ain't no hating allowed
But I'mm always seeing them faces and hearing them haters screaming out loud
It's an average night and I got my windows rolled up tight
Blowing Mo out the sunroof and not a hater in sight
But I'mma keep my third eye open cause I know them haters gonna be waiting
To catch me at the light with hopes that they can leave me open
Preposition be the past but I know caskets still blast
So I'mma lean back in my seat so I can't be seen through the glass
It ain't nuttin' to hold me dawg but I got to watch out for
9 times out of 10 if it's [?????]
And I know so I'm careful on who I run with
I ain't got no time to be combined in no scandalous ass shit
But everywhere I go I'm hearing what sounds like shot from a 44
Blasting on drivers side door
My niggas who sniff too much snow
And me I'm just trying to flow
Separate my friends with my foes
And only fuck with niggas who understand the mind [???]
So everywhere I go I try to stay completely separated from those with Hearts full of hatred for anybody that makes it
