Yeah
You know life could be tricky you know
But just make sure you pulling that rabbit out the hat
Feel me?

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
I'm living on the edge
Everyday I pray that I don't fall off this cliff and bust my head
I'm living on the edge

[Verse 1]
They got me walking on a tight rope
I guess they wanna see me fall for these white folks
I'm getting close to ground, let me start to say a prayer
I gotta keep my faith in God, Lord are you there?
But silent cries became loud as the world turns
Forgive my pride, there's a listen that we need to learn
So put aside all the bullshit and recognise
And you forgot about the game but these weak ass songs you start to memorise
I'm fully focused but these cowards got my blood rushing
We used to drop a tune so now we stuck with reporcussions
This crazy world got me paralysed
I wanna drop so many tears but my soul wouldn't let me cry
Leave me alone, let me listen to my four walls
As I procceed to sip this bottle full of alcohol
I wanna talk but they never understand me
So give me what I need, so I can feed my family

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
I'm living on the edge
Everyday I pray that I don't fall off this cliff and bust my head
I'm living on the edge
I'm living on the edge
Everyday I pray that I don't fall off this cliff and bust my head
I'm living on the edge

[Verse 2]
A baby mother wouldn't understand
What a brother gotta do to become a man
I'm on a mission got me searching for a better life
So now you tripping got me looking for a clever wife
I can't belive I'm feeling troubled in my own home
I wanna keep my faith in you but it's all gone
I'm dead wrong, but they all say
And but nobody gave a damn when I was slishing cocaine in the hallway
I made a promise that I couldn't break
I told my brothers and sisters that tonight we'll be eating steak
Oh what a feeling to be eating good
My little sister screaming 'Yummy' while she rubbing on her tummy, it's all hood
Mama claiming she wasn't hungry, she really didn't like the fact that the food came from drug money
Sometimes I wonder if I'm really better off dead
I can't believe i'm still living on the edge

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
I'm living on the edge
Everyday I pray that I don't fall off this cliff and bust my head
I'm living on the edge
I'm living on the edge
Everyday I pray that I don't fall off this cliff and bust my head
I'm living on the edge

[Bridge]
You got us watching and willing to make a perfect life
(Like don't walk by hate you know, walk by faith you know)
You gotta make the biggest choices when we sacrifice
(We gotta have patience, but get rid of the nonsense as well)
So keep your mind, in time we can all go
(We will never stop growing, as a race we keep multiplying)
You hit them try to tell you different homie let 'em know
(Even since I had sense we've been living on the edge)

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
I'm living on the edge
Everyday I pray that I don't fall off this cliff and bust my head
I'm living on the edge
I'm living on the edge
Everyday I pray that I don't fall off this cliff and bust my head
I'm living on the edge
