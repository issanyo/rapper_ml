[Intro: 2Pac Scarface]
Ladies and gentle men
Right here on tonight's stage
We're gonna have two savage minds
Two ruthless battlers
Two gruesome souls
Go live, right here
In this corner, MC Ryan D
And up next is 2Pacalypse

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Yo I can rock it on a slow tip
Don't flip, cause I can do this
No shit, won't trip, ain't nothin' to this
2Pacalpyse, now jack you better brace
Cause I'm thumpin' it up and pumpin' it up with hellafied bass
If ya comp rolls, throw blows until they back down
They sweat, no threat, suckers I smack down
No joke, I smoke any and all punks
They step, mic check and then they get done
What's next?, I flex and rock the dope TEC's
Get drunk, then run through crews like group sex
Get sprung, it's fun, out to hear the hoes
Homeboys, make noise from back to front row's
Cause yo, I flow and go continually
2Pac, non stop rippin' up scenery
So now, you know how I be rockin' shit
When I flow, same hoe with the 2Pacalypse

[2Pac Scarface]
Ooohh that's very good
Remember the last to have the challenger from the phone ringing
Eat the package mayn
And I'm Shock G and this [?]

[Verse 2: Ryan D]
Two it's time to crunch and munch, your pussy ass see I had a hunch
You couldn't punch, I eat you for lunch
And go through, your sorry crew, I thought you knew?
You punk motherfucker's could never do
The things I, The R the Y, the A the N, Daz D did bitch, you couldn't ever fade me
I'm not a sucker, I treat you like a serious trick
You little dummy, you need to stop talkin' shit
You got nerve, I give you credit, to think you hang
But brother we're not all in the same gang
The punks, the suckers, the phonies, the perpetrators like you
Would never even fit in a crew
Without suckin' a dick, or maybe robbin' a bank
You see you don't got talent and your breathe straight stank
Hoe, now step in line before I'm mad at you
You silly sucker ha, I thought you knew

[2Pac Scarface]
Ooohh that was very good
Ryan D, very good
But let's give 2Pac a counter attack
2Pac, step to the stage
And may the best man win

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Hit dropper, shit stopper with the strength to motivate
Give me a break, and then it's time to illustrate
2Pac will terminate, cause niggas like to perpetrate
Rhymes I create, yo you best believe they're worth the wait
So here I go, I'm about to throw a dope flow
And let them know 2Pac will hit you with a death blow
But you say no because you wanna battle blow for blow
I'm nothin' nice and my advise is just to let it go
I would just battle you but somehow I don't think it's fair
I'm not an amateur, I'll damage ya and leave you there
Anyway nigga I'm the one they want to hear from
Fuck that pussy shit that you be boppin' in they eardrum
Cause in the 90's boy, 2Pac is comin' through
I'm in effect, snappin' necks, I thought you knew

[2Pac Scarface]
Very good, very good
It's time for Ryan D
Once more to come
And meet 2Pac halfway
It's been a gruesome fight
Here's your last chance

[Verse 4: Ryan D]
You wanna talk about a battle?
Well I'mma talk about a massacre
You soft sucker, I'm tryin' not to laugh at ya
You and your posse, just stepped into the circle of death
You thought I wouldn't but the gauge, was in effect
I'm not a killer but I'm not exactly pro-life
Keep actin' stupid I'mma stab you with my girl's knife
I'm not a coward punk I'll walk into your livin' room
Change the channel, and make you watch a cartoon
And if you step, I hope you pack a serious nine
Cause if you don't, your sorry ass will be all mine
Cause I'm a warrior, I'll make a fire out of a stick
Live in the jungle, but never comin' less than thick
You sorry maggot, you need to learn a lesson from me
The funky brother causin' trouble chief R Y D
Cause I'm no sucker, I'm laughin' at you and your crew
You'll never hang 2Pac, I thought you knew

[2Pac Scarface]
Aww we're havin' a good fight here tonight
Ladies and gentlemen
Ryan D almost got points taken away for a low blow
2Pac
Step to the stage
It's on

[Verse 5 : 2Pac]
Shall I say I'm beatable?
Now out of the silent, I think conceded
But what more can I say, I've never been defeated
By a half steppin' mutha fucka clutchin' on the microphone
Sucker I'll break ya bones better leave 2Pac alone
I ain't no trick
I'll drop you and I'll drop you quick
It makes you sick
Because your bitch is on my dick
But who's to blame, the brotha with the strange name
I show no shame, cause god gave the me the gift of game
Now who are you?
Mutha fuck you and your crew
You think of drive by's, nigga I will drive through
You and your crew, you fuck around your girl too
The bitch is scandalous
She's fuckin' me and duckin' you
So fuck unbeatable, dope is what ya need to call it
If rap was liquor, I'd be a fuckin' alcholic
This ain't a threat
Just showin' em how dope it gets
When suckaz sweat
It's time to rock the roof, let's jet
I go for broke
Cause like I said the rhymes are dope
You're on the ropes, cause mutha fucka I'm no joke
It's like I'm brain-locked, when I hit the tempo
Kick the intro, then it's time to get loc'd
Ya got beef g
Step up 'fore it get swoll up
It's like a hold up
Drop 'em or get rolled up
I give a fuck
It's time to set the record straight
This nigga is dope (word)
What more can I say?

[Ryan D]
Alright alright man, peace man
You got it good [?]
Just wanna send a shout out to all my homeboys in
The J town, my DJ Clark Gable
Everybody else y'all know you down with the
Drank avenue posse, don't stop

[2Pac]
Ayo peace to my homie Treach, Latifah
The whole flavor unit posse
My girl Yo-Yo, the whole Lench Mob posse
Crazy shout outs to Ice Cube, Shock G, Money B
