[Intro: 2Pac & J. Valentine]
Damn, what I'ma do now til when I free.. oh shit!
Wait wait (motherfuck..) get free.. yeah yeah

[Hook]
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

[Verse 1]
Them bitches is foul, take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin' cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin' quick as the wind, it's me or them
Fuck friends my foes be on a mission tryin' to do me in
Fuck 'em I'm bout to get out, they all soft
I blow up my new range, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggas tryin' to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Main thang with nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it I'll enforce it with the steel
Use the lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Networkin' with connects that I got in the Pen'
In no time, I'll be clockin' again

[Hook] + [J. Valentine's harmonizing]
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

[Verse 2]
Still sittin' in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash quick
Call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin' maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin' me baby
To a young motherfucker facin' eighty that's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get her hooked
Got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin' it to Hell
All them niggas that was frontin' while I sat up in the cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned your misery
The nigga you don't wanna see

[Hook] + [J. Valentine's harmonizing]
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

[Verse 3]
Stuck in my cell
The Pen' ain't nuttin like the county jail
When will they let me bail?
Walkin' through the yard, I play the Guard
First nigga disrespect me, first nigga gettin' scarred
I'm, back on the scene
I'm hittin' knees in the back of a limousine, puffin' on weed
As we game on the drunk hoes
Hit the skunk I reminisce just on the way, we used to play, you punk hoes
What I possess is to be rich, in currency
Paranoid niggas like bitches when they come and see me
Laid out, played out, the nigga barely breathin'
As for that bullshit punk, nigga n-now we're even
But I wait, until it's time
And try to find a crooked way to profit off this crime
This life of mine... until I get free
My prophecy is niggas screamin', as if they bleed in agony
As soon as they popped my gate
I knew these motherfuckers made a mistake

[Hook] + [J. Valentine's harmonizing]
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

[Outro]
When I get free
Hahaha.. yeah nigga, when I get motherfuckin' free
Pop the gate, I'm back baby!
When I get free.. we up out this bitch
