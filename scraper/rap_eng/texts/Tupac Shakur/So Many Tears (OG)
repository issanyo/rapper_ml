[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Hook with Stretch doing backing vocals]
Ahh, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Why would a guy kill for cash?
But when a nigga's desperate make way for the pump blast
On the news prime time, because its black on black crime
So I'll never stay in your mind
I just dash gotta get the cash all day
Went from struggling straight to bubbling
Now I pray that a nigga remains calm
Oh god will I bust?
Will I fall off or will I still keep kicking dust
Trust, I get down from the ground
Plus I pack a pound
Perpetrators getting shot down
We suffered through the years, shed so many tears
Pouring out respect for the homies when we crack beers
My fears faded
A drug related death will make a nigga have to take a deep breath
And bust a left down memory lane
Where my nigga caught a teflon slug to the brain
And yo, shed so many tears

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now that I'm strugglin in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm havin visions
Of leavin here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

[Hook with Stretch doing backing vocals]
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothin left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin, 'bout to go to pieces, screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin me, in my sleep
Will I survive till the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come...

[Hook with Stretch doing backing vocals]
Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears..
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Lord knows I.. tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin noises, think she fuckin all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin to the floor; beggin for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears
(Dear God, please let me in)

[Final Hook]
Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears..
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
