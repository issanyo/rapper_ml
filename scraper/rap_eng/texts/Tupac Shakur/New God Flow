[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, Live in this motherfucker
Kanye West, what up nigga?
Pusha T, what's poppin?
Kasinova Tha Don
2Face Mixtape Volume 2

[Verse 1]
Play gangster get your wrecked soul
And ain't nobody paying attention brazing all the crazy lies is told
2 Calls and now I'm packing heavy
I had my run-ins with haters becasue I'm similar to Makaveli
Never stress and we collect all my currency
I pack a vest my adversaries wanna bury me
Watching my plot to get richer it's all in one nigga
The man behind the trigger is influenced by hard liquour
Fake stories they got the game twisted
And 2012 was hell because the homies really wasn't with it
So now i'm coping with my homies in Portland
All I oversee is weed got my pockets smoking
No need to front nigga keep it rolling
When it's the realer nigga breaking down our politics
The rap game is full of shit but it ain't hard to fix
And Kasinova Tha Don, I'm still a trouble-maker
And when I double up you'll thank me later

[Hook]
Shake that body, party that bod-
That's rare, nigga!
Shake that body, party that bod
Ric Flair, nigga!
Shake that body, party that body
Yeah, nigga!
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
Yeah
Shake that body, party that bod-
Woah
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D

[Verse 2]
I got the sound like it's '96
So everytime i'm in the booth I'm dropping deep shit
But peep this
I'm on a mission to defeat any competition wanted
You can see me on the streets so don't be acting like you wanted peace
I'm not a killer but I can be
Bust until it's empty leave him sleep by the creep, can you feel me?
Keeping it real as my stories is told
Switch my name to Kasinova had the rap game sold
Planting seeds in the dirt, watch it rise for y'all
Coming up fast, never got the chance to crawl
Pack a vest you never catch me slipping
I seen my homie get murdered because he didn't listen
Belive in fairy-tales, hell no
You caught me knocking out cowards with my southpaw
So now I'm ducking the law
Only if you know all the trouble I've seen
Everybody get a chance to be a part of my team
Let's go

[Hook]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
