[2Pac]
Oh shit, caught that nigga alone. Ain't that a bitch?
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh for them niggas that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin' 50 deep
But they be fuckin' cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin' about
You know who I'm talkin' about, that's right
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
You ain't shit without your homeboys

[Hook: 2Pac]
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggas is punks
Without your homeboys you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggas is punks
You ain't shit without your homeboys, nigga
(Punk ass.. that's right motherfucker)
You ain't shit without your homeboys
(Throw your hands up you little trick)
(a squared.. coward motherfucker)

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Like Yak said, how the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks?
When you got the Outlaw Pac shittin' your box
You was lookin' real weak walkin' down the street
Now a nigga 30 deep, oh, you wanna beef?
Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it â€“ what's this? You the only scared one
Damn, son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the fists, I would have laid you out
Niggas be actin' all different when they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget, Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys?

[Hook: 2Pac]
You ain't shit without your homeboys
My thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers (without your homboys)
The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death, we ain't shit without our homeboys
(You know what time it is)
I ain't shit without my homeboys
(Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back. Until I die, they label me as a ridah forever, my niggas be together

[Outro/Hook]
Ain't shit without your homeboys
Thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys
The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
(without our homeboys)
Love my niggas to death
I ain't shit without our homeboys
Love you niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
