[Intro: 2Pac]
Pawhoo hoo hoo hoo
I don’t wanna be your man, bitch
(Fuck that)
What you crazy
I don’t wanna be your fuckin' man
You stupid you fuckin' idiot
(Drunk ho)
I wanna be
Yo let me fuck that nigga down
What’s that?
My ghetto love song hahaha
(Set it off, set it off)
Let’s be friends
(Where my niggas at)
(Where my niggas, where my niggas)
I know you wanna fuck
(Where my niggas at?)
(All my real niggas throw your muthafuckin' hands up)
Let's be friends
Where my niggas, where my niggas
Hahahaha yeeeah
(Let's go lets go)
Let’s be friends
(Throw ya hands in the air)
There’s no need to front
(Let’s see ya just throw ya hands in the air)
Let's be friends…
(Westside in this motherfucker right here, Westside)
(Throw ya hands in the air)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye, winkin' my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps, baby? Come get with me and perhaps, lady
You can help me multiply my stacks, baby
Currency seems small, I need companionship
Through with that scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitatin', actin' like yo' shit don't stink?
Check out my diamonds, bitch, everyone gonna blink
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my résumé, sippin' on Cristal and Alize
Smokin' on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin', but I'll buy you a fit
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, read briefly, this O.G
Puttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called car, who the man?
While I'm tuggin' on your main bitch head
Understand this: Ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay Z!
He broke and I smoke daily, baby, let's be

[Hook: 2Pac]
Friends
There's no need to front, let’s be friends
I know you want to fuck
Let’s be friends
There's need to front, let’s be friends
I know you want to fuck

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin' for you
Hardcore, starin' and watchin'
Me and you, one on one, picture countless options
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body
Far from a crush, I wanna bust your guts and touch
Everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre! Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass!
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs
Now let me in between as

[Hook: 2Pac]
Friends
There's no need to front, let’s be friends
I know you want to fuck
Let’s be friends
There's need to front, let’s be friends
I know you want to fuck

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame, my dick or the game
Bet I scream 'Westside' when I came, Westside
Scream my name because, baby, it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby, let your back dip into it, make it fluid
In and out, all around when a nigga do it
You've got me high, let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player hatin' niggas cuz they cockblock
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good in this world of G's
Baby's got me fantasizin', seein' you naked
It's a fuck song, now check the record
Let's be friends!

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hey we fin to do this shit long stroke style
