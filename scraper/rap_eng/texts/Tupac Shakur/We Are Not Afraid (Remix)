[The Notorious B.I.G]

After realizin, to master enterprisin
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I was in
Began to encounter, with my counter... parts
I holla burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selection, some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson, like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand. Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit

[Hook]

Why do you keep
On whispering
Talking with your face turned away
You say that love
Don't come easy for you
What makes you think I'm not afraid?

[2Pac]

Ever since I met you I could beat the pressure
It's like your man don't understand
All he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
It ain't about no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love making got you shaking when im standin' near you
News of precision will prepare ya in case you get scared
Just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gotten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own

[Hook]

Why do you keep
On whispering
Talking with your face turned away
You say that love
Don't come easy for you
What makes you think I'm not afraid?

[The Notorious B.I.G]

A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young I had two pairs of Lees, besides that
The pin stripes and the gray (Huh huh)
The one I wore on Mondays, on Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt and alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga with the fake, huh, BLAOW!
Why you punch me in my face , stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin'
That hoes clocking, here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll with em' , stole with em'
I mean loyalty, niggas bough me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch

[Hook]

Why do you keep
On whispering
Talking with your face turned away
You say that love
Don't come easy for you
What makes you think I'm not afraid?
