Dear Beethoven,

I felt compelled 2 write u. I can't really complain, but I really feel good vibes From u. I'm almost sure we'll Be very close FrienDs. I would have never guessed that u+I would be Friends. But as the old saying goes... wait, how does THAT saying go? Forget it! u get the point! I want u 2 KNOW THAT u can TELL me ANYTHing and if u ever need a SHoulder 2 cry on, u can cry on mine. I have so many good Thoughts about what lies ahead 4 us and it is my Hope THAT they all come True. As u will soon FiND OUT, I DO NOT spare words, I say what I feel. So if something I say scares u please don't panic because I tend to get over emotional. My heart usually leads me 2 fast and THAT's probably why I always get Hurt. So if it seems as THough I'm moving 2 fast please slow me down! Talking 2 u on the phone was SucH a good feeling 4 me. I was Beginning 2 FEEL ALONE & OUT OF THE BLUE, I meeT u & it's almost Like I've KNOWN u 4 years. We HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON. We Both Love Prince We HAVE BOTH HAD broken hearts and we Both ADoRe CANDles! WHAT ELSE COULD I ask 4! C U 2morrow Beethoven!

4 ETERNITY
TUPAC SHAKUR
