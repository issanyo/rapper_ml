[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I’m livin' major
My adversaries is gettin' worried
They paranoid of gettin’ buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
They wonder if my lifestyle changed
