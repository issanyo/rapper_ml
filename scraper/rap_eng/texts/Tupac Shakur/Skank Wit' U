Tell dirty 'bout my business, tell me girl do you feel me?
Are you ready for the rhythm of a real G?
Love do you hear me? I got ya running for my body
Drippin' sweat are you ready for my hottie
2Pac, 2Pac, Hip hop
Mix down with that underground funk
And a pocket full of skunk
Come hear now baby
You been running for my lines lately
I’ll be getting mines, kicking rhymes to fade me
Thug life baby baby
Steady smoking indo, going crazy
Now baby if you love me, come and hug me
Turn the lights down, in the dark when you rub me
Everybody's talking about they know me
But they never gave me all the fame that it show me
Get off the dance floor, peep wipe yourself when I pick cha
