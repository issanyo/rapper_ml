I can't trust no body, they all just phoney
I'm tryna stack my money like Makaveli
Snap back to reality I’m almost ready
Money stacked up real heavy
Going up makes me work harder
I'm Jordan it's the fourth quarter
And that's the mission, that's the mission
That's the mission, that's the mission (that's the mission)
That's the mission, that's the mission, that's the mission

Walking through the street lights, I've been feeling well
Mo Money you get people wanna see you fail
I swear this world full of demons, it's like I'm in a hell
People come around, and go around
She flexing I can tell
I'm leavin guess it's farewell
Missin, she's what I'm missin
These bitches trippin
It's shots up no fakes just realness, I'm Makaveli
Can't trust niggas
I don't understand niggas
Missin my famila
My mama, love her dearly
I’m a lil tricky, call me a theory

I can't trust no body, they all just phoney
I'm tryna stack my money like Makaveli
Snap back to reality I’m almost ready
Money stacked up real heavy
Going up makes me work harder
I'm Jordan it's the fourth quarter
And that's the mission, that's the mission
That's the mission, that's the mission (that's the mission)
That's the mission, that's the mission, that's the mission

I'm off that Tanqueray
Drinkin and thinkin, been feelin lonely
I feels no way
Minds bringin me down, I'm slippin away
I got trust issues, these bitches they can't do shit for me
I'm single, mo money mo problems, mo knowledge
No problems, don't got problems, cause I'm in peace
Death of a sinner, you and the mix
Realest shit you'll read
Bitch no trustin, for any niggas, cause that's blasphemy
And if you try me on the 13th, you won't live to see the next week

I can't trust no body, they all just phoney
I'm tryna stack my money like Makaveli
Snap back to reality I’m almost ready
Money stacked up real heavy
Going up makes me work harder
I'm Jordan it's the fourth quarter
And that's the mission, that's the mission
That's the mission, that's the mission (that's the mission)
That's the mission, that's the mission, that's the mission

I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin’, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me to me hiring the person
