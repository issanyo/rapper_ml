[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
‘Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human being
So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
‘Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly? Somebody else should try
Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies
And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn

[Outro: 2pac]
One Day At A Time
