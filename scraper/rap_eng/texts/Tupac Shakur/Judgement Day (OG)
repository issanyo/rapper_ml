[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas slanging, drugs
And runnin' from the NARCs when they pass by, don't ask why
I'm a hustler, 'til my ass die
Even when they do come up, I'll be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
It's 2Pac and the Mad Bitch
In the '64 rag on them thangs that's a bad bitch
Getting ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the backseat nigga when we clown
Homie is you down?
Dee got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fore she spanks shit
Comin' round the corner spittin' rounds
They can't hold me down
Caught them sucker ass bitches out of bounds
Now tell me how that sound
A double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgement day
Stinkin' biaatch

[Verse 2: Dee Tha Mad Bitch]
Look like today is Judgement and I'm bucking
Everybody's in shock
It's the Dee and the 'Pac, coming equipped with that rough shit
No matter what you get that ass fucked up in the worst way
Slay, like hit 'em all day
I'm not the bitch to be fucking with
You besta think twice
See I'm a veteran in this street life
I'm doing wars so fuck the wife
You only live one time in this [?]
That's why I'm going for mine
Make a mill, life's a living hell
You gotta make all you can make if I'm not making it then I'm taking your shit
Cause we down till the last days
And every minute of this living shit has got me going crazy
Everyday of my life I got called for my attitude
It was my habit let me coming rude
In time, now it's hard to find, why we life this way
Judgement day

[Verse 3: Mopreme]
Who the fuck are you to try and judge me?
Going for a young G, get you before you get me
Motherfucker's no joke let the barrel smoke chump
I got the Mossberg 12 in my trench coat
Singing my song for freedom, bomb or bust
We can run the old shit, what the fuck?
Surviving on stretch, twenty minutes now stressed on the chest is steal get laid to rest
We get it from the Cops and the niggas that's bitch made
"Shit Don't Stop" have to cut your ass sideways
Nigga it's a N World
Cause it's all out, so motherfucking high they 'bout to fall out
And you expect me to live like you
And your silly ass don't know what to do
Huh, I'd rather fight back, and get the shit hot
Blow yo' ass out the spot, on Judgement day

[Verse 4: Stretch]
Uh, ghetto's the back bone, streets the crack zone
Thugs cracking Mac's where we roam kid
Causing destruction, and mayhem, snitches we spray 'em
And Narcs staying strapped cause we blaze them
Tryna find and easy way to a meal ticket
And do it "Thugstyle" like a G and still kick it
And bringing wicked
I'm living raw straight play by the [?]
But I runs out of drugs no more
So let the coke pour on the scale boy
Lets get this mail boy
And keep it on the low avoid jail boy
And fuck the G's in the motherfucking Pen'
The news flash "Thug Life Wrecking Shit Again"
And fucking shit again and again motherfucker
The Young to the Guns straight causing mad ruckus
I might get popped, but that's the price I gotta pay
A nigga going out on my fucking Judgement day, out
