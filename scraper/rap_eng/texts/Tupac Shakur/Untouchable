Intro [N.I.N.A. & 2Pac]
What's my name NINA And I'm from Tha Row (ha ha ha) Yeah, and you Come on (ha ha) Come on, hey

Chorus: I know you feel me It's the untouchable Make yourself presentable I'm listenin' to mysteries of the untold  Uh oh Echoin' inside my soul

[N.I.N.A.]
Look at how you found me I'm lookin' around me Sayin' these are my friends It's a strange world My enemies are my friends I'm on the same street Same world Same problems Is it different Same drama same karma Same mama Is it different (come on) The only difference is me I see inside the truth Feel bad you don't know the day gon' come  When God has taken you I see the invisible spirits (just lookin' back) Walkin' along the physical mind Of a crazy individual Where demons still find it livable I need a hug to hold my soul Inside my body I got the secret here Yeah I should have told somebody Cuz ever since I've been sayin' things I never meant It's like I was speakin' in tongues The black breath in my lungs I won't allow it Know the cowards live under the dirt In the flowers Ready to come up in the darkest hour It ain't the courage of my persona  You wanna admire It's the faith Cuz with the faith I can walk through the fire Now feel me

[2Pac]
Untouchable Untouchable Unstoppable  Outlaw ride untouchable (ride...)  After the fire comes the rain After the pleasure there's pain Even though we broke for the moment  We be ballin' again Time to make ya'll my military Be prepared for the busters Similar to Picture that's scary Get too near me but rush ya Visions of overpacked prisons Millions of niggas thug livin' Precious Three strikes I hope they don't test us And pull a heater Ammunition in crates (shhh...) Move without a sound As we slide down pistols in place I'm sensin' niggas's defenceless From hittin' fences to gettin'ghosts Who could prevent me shootin' senseless  At these niggas throats Only wish to breed I explode into a million seeds Y'all remember me Legendary live eternally Then bury me in pieces Cuz they fear reincarnation Niggas screamin' peace Cuz they fear When my squad face 'em Take 'em to places Stake their face then erase 'em And break 'em Murder mutherfuckers At a rate and then quicken the pace Blast me but never ask me to live a lie Am I wrong cuz I wanna get it on Till I die Now I'm worldwide Niggas gossip like girls They hide No offense to Nas But this whole fuckin' world is mine Even if you blind You can still see my prophecy My destiny to overthrow Those on top of me Fiendin' for currency The money be callin' Can you feel me dreamin' Seein' scenes of me ballin' Fuck you bitch made niggas And that bullshit you goin' through Outlaws bustin' while we rush it Untouchable Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you goin' through We outlaws rushin' 'em bustin' 'em We untouchable

Tryin' to make my mark before I leave Let me breathe  You know (untouchable)
