[Intro - K. Jayz]
This for all the motherfuckers who went through the same shit I went through
Nobody would tell you that your life could be better

[Verse 1 - K. Jayz]
I know you need some motivation just to get you through the day
Nobody can blame ya
Everybody saying you ain’t shit
Now you starting to believe it, because you ain’t rich
Or you ain’t fucking with the clique that you say you down with
You don’t agree with the shit they do
You despise it
Now deep down, I know part of you wants to try it
I know you do, don’t lie
Don’t even deny it
But now they throw you away like a tornado
They thinking that you awkward, but you got something to say tho
It take courage to stand up on your own two feet
Lord knows nobody would stand up for me
Now I’m here to tell you to keep moving on
All the haters in your past, they’ll be mad that you won
Even if you alone, at least you still did it
Just remember I’ll be here anytime you wanna kick it

[Hook - Dave Hollister & 2Pac]
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier (Keep ya head up)
Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter (Ohhh!) (Gotta keep ya head up)
Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier (Gotta keep ya head up)
Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 2 - K. Jayz]
I know too many kids that be dropping out of high school
For no apparent reason, except they think that it’s cool
We need to better for ourselves as a generation
The younger generation don’t even have an imagination
They too busy with technology to even know how to talk publically
So they awkward socially
I really be looking to change myself
And change hip hop from making music for the wealth
If a man treating you wrong, you should replace him
Cause he only tryna play games and make you chase him
Don’t be falling for his wise tactics
Cause he’s fake lover like a magician pulling hat tricks
I don’t know much more time I got on Earth
So I know that I gotta rock the mic for eternity
At least until the end of me
It’s gonna take the man in me to change this society

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - 2Pac]
And uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want 'em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While the tears is rolling down your cheeks
Ya steady hoping things don't fall down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getting older and older and cold
From having the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is driving Benz
I'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please, you got to keep your head up
