[Pac Voice]

Got me thinking about better days...

[Verse 1: 2pac]

Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smoking weed like it ain't no thang
So even kids wanna try now
They lie down and get ran through
Nobody watched 'em clockin the evil man do
Faced with the demons
Addicted to hearin victims screaming
Guess we was evil since birth
Product of cursed semens
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops
The only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets
It ain't the same
Too many murders
Too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried
Plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith


[Verse 2: 2pac]

Who would've guessed that in my future years
I'd be stressing, some say the ghetto's a sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Try to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Saving up for some Jordan's cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too
And so am I. I can't take her to places she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin
But what can I say, keep yo' head up and
Try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith


[Verse 3: 2pac]

Square fools, since back in high school
We was true, me and you hardly parted or separeted
We stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbanger and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressing like grown men when rolling
I went to dark, smoking Newports, gaming marks
Got a place in my heart, homie stay smart
Locked you up in the penn'
And gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hoping you well, I know it's hell doing time in the cells
You need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doing cool
I settled down, had a family
Working in night school
Every once in a while
I reminisce and wonder how we ever came to this
