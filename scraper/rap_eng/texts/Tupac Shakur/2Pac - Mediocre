[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
I run with the bad bitches
Ain't no mediocre (x3)
Bad bitches
Ain't mediocre (x3)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, I could make miracles to tempos
It's instrumental, waiting for the nymphos; that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just â€˜cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on, still down?
Met you standing at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we headin' for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Oh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't want to talk to me, just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number?
Are you alone? Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme
Take time to rewind these oridnary words I say
If you open your mind bet in a minute you'll find
It's time let the Outlawz play
