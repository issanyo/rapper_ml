[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. & 2Pac]
Ready nigga? Ready for that raw dog shit nigga?
Okay, all right, let me see how I'ma hit you wit'. You wanna set it off?
Ayy, I'm scared to do some freestyle

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I'm scared to do some freestyle flow
I'm too high and I might go off-tempo
But now I'm back to let these niggas know just how deep
My game run, 2Pacalypse don't sleep
I keep a motherfucking Glock in my car
If I'm holding in the club, I gotta be the fucking star
So everybody wanna smile, and raise they hands
I got a razor, 'case I gotta do a necks (next) man
'Cause you know how niggas be, they wanna see
If Pac is real or is he like that nigga in the movie
I guess I gotta prove my point
Slicin' motherfuckers, now I'm doing the joint
I got my nigga B-I to the G beside me
Bitches on my dick, you know them hoes wanna ride me
And my other homies out here like Spike Lee
They got the camera on a nigga guess they like me
But now I'm bout to pass this motherfucker on
'Cause this Tanqueray is getting hella strong

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Money, hoes and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose is all a nigga knows
Flippin' on foes, puttin' tags on toes
Watchin' the stash grow, clockin the cash flow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Gettin' paid so much all the bitches wanna see a nigga
I guessed they figured I'm paid I wanna get laid
Or since I got loot I wanna knock boots
Huh, I rather beat my dick then trick
And if she don't suck then we don't fuck
Huh, I rather lick a buck drive a fat ass truck
Grab the nine, two clips and run them up
Yes, flex out the 2 or 3 benz's since I wreck shit
What the fuck do you expect it
A fly guy, well fuck it I'ma high guy from Bed-Stuy
Puttin' the swellin' on your eye
And your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin'
And when police come, I'm leavin'
