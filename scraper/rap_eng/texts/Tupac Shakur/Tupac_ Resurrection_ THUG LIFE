When I'm saying Thug, I mean not criminals; someone who beats you up and that
I mean the underdog, the person that nothing succeeds; he's a thug, because
He overcome all obstacles, it doesn't have anything to do with the dictionaries
Version of thug, for me thug is my pride, not being someone who goes against the law
Not being someone to take, but being someone who has nothing, and that he don't have nothing
And there's no home for him to go to, my head is up high, my chest is out, I walk tall, I talk loud

I'm being strong!

I don’t understand why America doesn’t understand Thug Life. America is Thug life. What makes me saying ‘I don’t give a fuck’ different than Patrick Henry saying ‘Give me liberty or give me death’? What makes my freedom less worth fighting for than Bosnians or whoever they want to fight for this year?

They should give money to the ghetto

I mean I think even gangs can be positive. It just has to be organized
It has to steer away from being self-destructive to being self-productive
I organized the OGs on the East and West Coasts in penitentiaries
To come up with codes of ethics for criminals
It's called the Code of Thug Life
It's a code, putting order to the violence on the streets
In Watts, Compton, Chicago, wherever
People all over the country say, "We go by this code
"We're against attacks on people not involved with the street gang, the drug trade or the illegal business at all."

"All that kidnapping and shooting drive-bys, we against that."
Thug Life ain't just a bunch of niggas going crazy
We wanna patrol our streets. So all we saying is
If every motherfucker out here right now gave up one dollar
To this Thug Life fund, the money don't go to me
It go to somebody from y'all neighborhood
And we do this shit every month. I'll bring new rappers
I'll bring Snoop, whoever y'all want
I'll go snatch them niggas. For that shit to happen, we can't have violence
And everybody gotta be down for that shit
