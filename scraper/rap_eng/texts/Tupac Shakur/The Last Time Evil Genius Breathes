[Verse]
You, with your paki self
And fat neck havin’ ass that you use to swallow curry
You, have me blocked once again
Got me feeling like I’m nothing
You, with your nasty lisp, I’d rather talk to an autist
Screaming and screeching
You, have fucked up once again

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'll just take you down
With just one single text
I hope you know, I hope you know
I HOPE YOU KNOW!!!

[Chorus]
Someday, I’ll be finding you at LSE
And it’ll be the last time you breathe
Someday, I’ll be strangling you with your pp 
And it’ll be the last time you breathe
I love vanilla ice cream...

[Bridge]
And I can see you in years from now on discord
Talking to your incel friends
With that same old crusty ass mouth
But nobody’s listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Fat and mumbling on about how I can’t sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life, and it’ll be the last time you breathe! 

[Chorus]
Someday, I’ll be finding you at LSE
And it’ll be the last time you breathe
Someday, I’ll be strangling you with your pp 
And it’ll be the last time you breathe
I love vanilla ice cream...
