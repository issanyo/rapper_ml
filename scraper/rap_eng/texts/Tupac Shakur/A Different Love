I remember when you were lost
and your soul was in the wind
It was at this awkward moment
that you and I become friends
But then your soul was found
and you discovered celibacy
But with this you forgot about me
and our bond was a memory
And now I seyou u felt it
that bond we made before
I pray to God it stands
and severs never more
