[Nicki Minaj]
So when they see me
They salute the harajuku
Some pink pumps, pink thumbs
And tu-tu
Some pink lips,pink blush on my YouTube
Now everybody cha-ga-la-gin on my chu-chu
Some bubblegum blowin' bubbles and I shoot you
Some pink toes in my pink Jimmy Choo Choo's
All the way in London they love me
In Australia I'm crocodile dundee!
