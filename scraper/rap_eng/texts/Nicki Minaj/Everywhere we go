Verse 1: Nicki Minaj
Wait a minute, let me skate up in it
I see your face got the hate up in it
The briefcase got the cake up in it
Call me Lil Wayne,ma' your girl make it rain
These silly rappers don't impress me
I'm eating red snappers on a jet ski
I mean, I gotta giggle, I gotta laugh a little
Mami, I been hot since Monie was in the middle
Nicki Minaj, Lil' Kimberly
When you see the squad, bitches better salute like an assembly
Come on mami, I got dudes that will kill for me
These broke bitches got it in for me
I done did what I had to do
Rep the NY like an apple do
Step to these broads like a Kappa do
Boo, You sold a million, now you half of who?
Get off my dick, kick it bitch
