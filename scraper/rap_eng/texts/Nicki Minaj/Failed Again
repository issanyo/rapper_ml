Listen to the static of the radio
Runnin' red lights on my way back home
This is what you do to me
I'm getting away but I got nowhere to go
Your arms are uninviting and your stare is cold
If this is how it's gonna be
Well I'm gonna let it be...
Yeah yeah yeah

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

Believed in every word that came through your theeth
I though to myself that you meant everything
'Cause that's the way you made it seem
So for now I'm gonna let it go
It isn't worth deeping this hole
Where my heart used to be
So I'm gonna let it be...
Yeah yeah yeah

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

You did'nt really want it
You did'nt really need me
Nurse the wounds but they're still open
From the seams watch it bleed

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

This isn't love but I'll pretend
