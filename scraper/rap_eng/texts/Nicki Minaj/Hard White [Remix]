[Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way
(Straight up, straight up)
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, just last week I told 'em to pick a side
I bust shots, don't duck if it don't apply
Bae out in Paris, he told me to pick a ride
Sike, made you look, I still didn't pick a guy
I'm the trophy of the game, everybody tryna win me
Me, Olivier, Jourdan Dunn, my baby, Winnie
Partying in Paris, these bitches is embarrassed
'Cause they know I'm the queen, I still didn't pick an heiress
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest?
You the motherfucking fairest, Nicki
What I drop on this watch?
I don't know, about a hundred-fifty
I'm who they wishin' to be
These hoes is on the 'Gram, Nicki pitchin' a ki'
'Bout to cop Neverland, Michael up in the tree
You got bars and still broke? You might as well took a plea, uh
Be in the bando or would you rather move weight, Don Pablo? Uh

[Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way
(Straight up, straight up)
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back (yeye)

[Verse 2: Maybel Montez]
I got the work, hard white like a nigga possessed
And I don't have to read the message when you send me the text
It's like a Trivia, every single answer you guessed
I was an East side nigga that's until I went West
Now I'm a 213-424 Hollywood nigga
Chasing goals that I set like I said I would nigga
How I'm a rookie?
I been doing this since I was 15
At 21, landed my first role on the big screen
Star meter top 10, check my IMDb
I'm flattered you keep comparing me to MJ and CB
I'm wearing one glove, and dance at all my shows too
If you're not a fan I'll act like I don't know you

[Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way
(Straight up, straight up)
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

[Outro]
W-w-w-w-work hard
W-w-w-w-work hard
J-just last week, I told 'em to pick a side
I-I-I bust shots, don't duck if they apply
