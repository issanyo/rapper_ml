[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Haaa..by popular demand Sasha Feirce, Nicki Minaj, let's go

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo rude boy, why you cross me like a little t?
I'm Minaj, big M, uh'uh not a Mickey D
Now, I'm flyer than a broom (broom), broom, I dissed him
Then I peel up in a room (room), boomin' system
Now listen, now listen, LISTEN
I was there through your bid in prison
Ya know, I coulda been your wife
But sucks for you, boo-hoo
I would never rent a tux for you
Excuse me, I'm buzzing like bumblebees
Football & they all wanna fumble me
I was a thirty-two D in my Dugarees
Can I have a couple more cucumbers, please?
Now I'm that bitch, now I'm the bad witch
I need a lot of cheese up on my sandwich
Just got a new boyfriend, he's Pepe Le Pew
And he just bought me two Giuseppe shoes. (thank you!)
That's one for right, & one for the left
Yes to the left, left, to the left
Now we should all go to Jerry Springer
And you could put the ring up on my middle finger

[Beyonce]
All the single ladies [x7]
Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip but now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I could care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
Cause you had your turn
But now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

Don't treat me to the things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Is a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Hey, hey -
And just like a ghost
You'll be gone, gone
Diddy Bop, like Sean, John, John
Anyway, I like Lauren Lon-don
Get my chopsticks, get me my won-ton
Cus you thought you'd win
But I'd knew you'd lose
Honey, I'm flyer than altitude crews
Yes, I'm cool, you can chuck deuce
Nicki been hot since Duck, Duck Goose

[Beyonc√©:]
All the single ladies [x7]
Now put your hands up

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)
