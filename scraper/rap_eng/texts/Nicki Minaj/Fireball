[Verse 1: Willow Smith]
Since I landed here, I gon’ phone up a Obama
Shook the world up, now I caused a little drama
Leader of the new school
And yes I’m gonna light up the block to the stage when I wanna
Brighter than the stars, throw my head up the curve
Don’t get, walk it off, check it I walk with a slur
Levitating in my mom’s all weather fur
I'mma rock the world, til they follow Willow

[Chorus: Willow Smith] x2
I’m the fireball at the party
I’m the fire

[Verse 2: Willow Smith]
See I ain’t never been the one to toot my own horn, beep, beep
Now watch me put her on
I set fire everywhere I play, make them all go insane, L.A to UK
Now I'mma burn it up, when I step on the scene
My whole crew is fresh, and they rollin' with me
You can turn me up yep to the extreme
I'mma rock the World til they follow with me

[Chorus: Willow Smith] x2
I’m the fireball at the party

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo Willow, didn’t I just see you in China
Y-y-you’re real major even though you a minor
Your daddy keep you in designer
Y-y-you’re gully gully gully, yeah you’re gully kinda
Ok I’m the street fighter, call me Chun-Li
A-a-and it’s goin’ down, l-l-like a bum knee
B-b-built a guest house to put the coupe in
’cause I’m a fireball, Hadouken
Put you under my wing, I’m the top boss
A-a-ain’t from Louisiana but I’m hot sauce
C-c-cuffed the mountain just to go and build a house off
So I ain't never got to worry when the house calls
If they comin’ at you tell ‘em raise up
When it’s time to whip your hair, put your braids up
Tell em' escalator, elevator, unimeter, step your weight up
Ain’t nobody greater, Will and Jada is my neighbor, hater

[Chorus: Willow Smith] x2
I’m the fireball at the party
I’m the fire
I’m the fireball at the party
I’m the fire
I’m the fireball at the party
I’m the fire
I’m the fire
I’m the fire
I’m the fire

[Bridge: Willow Smith]
Watch the fire burn, burn, burn
Watch me heat it up
Watch the fire burn, burn, burn
Watch me heat it up
Watch the fire burn, burn, burn
Watch me heat it up

[Chorus: Willow Smith] x2
I’m the fireball at the party
I’m the fire
I’m the fireball at the party
I’m the fire
I’m the fireball at the party
I’m the fire
I’m the fire
I’m the fire
I’m the fire
