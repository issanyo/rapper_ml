You said you've had enough
I've packed up all my stuff
I'm waiting for the cab in the hallway
I've got nothing to explain
I'm naked in the rain
Like every part of me is on display

Trying to act like everything's ok
No way

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?

I know that you won't call
Won't talk to me at all
You left me in my less than perfect world
I'm done with feeling small
I really gave it all
Tried to be your stupid cover girl

You must be glad you finally had your way

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?

I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never write this story
Maybe looking back
Many years from now
When it's all to late to be sorry
You'll be thinking
What did I do?

Chorus:
What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you

I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never write this story
I guess we'll never know
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?
