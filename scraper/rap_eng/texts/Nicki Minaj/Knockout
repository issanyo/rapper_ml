(Lil Wayne - Verse 1)
Uhh
Yeahh
Uh ohh
Yeahh
Hey Barbie, ah, ah, ah, are you into black men?
He- hey hey hey Barbie! Hey I can be your black Ken
Wow! 'Cause once you go black, you never go back
She wore her hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat, and after that
Everything went black

(Nicki Minaj - Chorus)
Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

(Lil Wayne - Verse 2)
Hey Barbie, can I call you Barbara? Haha
Hey Barbie! Can I call you tomorrow, and today?
'Cause once you go black, you never go back
And once you go Wayne, everybody else is whack
Then she threw that ass back, back, back, then I fell to the mat
And after that everything went black

(Nicki Minaj - Chorus)
Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

(Nicki Minaj - Verse 3)
Awe fuck it
Give me that damn bucket
Wh-when I throw this pussy

You better not start duckin'
Oh yo
Hit 'em with the blow
Lo-look out in the crowd
And everybody's yellin' "NO!"
Grab him by his locks
And give us a good box
Hit him below the belt
I wanna give him good top
Top, top
Give him good top
Hit him below the belt
I wanna give him good top
1,2,3
They yellin' 1,2,3
I done hit him with that motherfuckin' court two piece
Tell 'em, tell 'em to mop out
To late to cop out
Give him more head than tupee's that's the knockout

(Nicki Minaj - Chorus)
Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

(Lil Wayne - Outro)
So just knock me out
So just knock me out
Yeah

So just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
