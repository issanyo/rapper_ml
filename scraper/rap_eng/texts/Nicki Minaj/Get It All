She said, "Baby
I know you love her, but I love you"

She caught my face like a Kodak, I couldn't shake the weather
Storm had nothing on this chick named Heather
Damn every time I seen her, it was just the thought of break up
But you know niggas and girls how they quit, then they make up

She told me she been in love with me ever since we were in 6th grade
Ms. Hills' class, I'm just thinkin', ah, oh
Mighty funny didn't notice her back then
But now her body bangin', got me thinkin', ah, oh

I'm just thinkin' I'm so quick to fall
I wanna hit it, but I'm still involved
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend

Shawty said she had so many dreams of her and me, she couldn't sleep
She tellin' me to come and get it all, get it all
She so glad the girlfriend that I used to have didn't wanna treat me right
So she told me I could get it all, get it all

Best believe me, she gon' get it all, get it all
Best believe me, she gon' get it all, get it all
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend

Stop playin' man, I been hotter than summer school
'Cause even then I used to make them motha fuckas drool
I been bad since sticky hands
Now all these bitches is Nicki fans

I gotta chuckle, excuse the duffle
I mean my ring so big it just bruise my knuckle
And I just heard that you was back on the market
Let me stick shift, ride it, back it up, and then park it

'Cause you and me, we should be together
Cop da matchin' Lamborghini, Swahili leather
Now dat dat dat dat's black on black
And if the bitch call ya phone, that's a back hand smack
Nigga what?

She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend

Shawty said she had so many dreams of her and me, she couldn't sleep
She tellin' me to come and get it all, get it all
She so glad the girlfriend that I used to have didn't wanna treat me right
So she told me I could get it all, get it all

Best believe me, she gon' get it all, get it all
Best believe me, she gon' get it all, get it all
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend

She freaky, tangerine tone
Body belong on the cover of the 2010 swimsuit issue of SI
She told me to don't leave her until I know I'da got over the whole fever
And I can't stop

Best believe me she gon' get it all
Best believe me she gon' get it all
She said it's just like when you hit a ball
If you gon' swing, you better get it all

She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend

Shawty said she had so many dreams of her and me, she couldn't sleep
She tellin' me to come and get it all, get it all
