[Verse 1]
Guess who?
You bitches, it's RiRi
Lam-Lamborghini strawberry kiwi
Fashion week in Paris was nice
Every designer had my size (ha ha, ha ha ha ha, haa!)
Switch my hair, they gon' copy her
Switch my gear, they gon' copy her
L-L-Look at how they stare, just to copy her
Well, roger that
Did you copy that, co-co-copy cat?

[Hook]
I am go-going home
I am go-going home
I shut it down, already
I am go-going home
I am go-going home
I am go-going home
I shut it down, already
I am go-going home

[Verse 2]
Back door, because I am leaving
One more, but now they just greedy
Yo, tell 'em fi go, make em gwan with no mistakes
Color up shades, lower with my disguise
Switch my hair, they gon' copy her
Switch my gear, they gon' copy her
L-L-Look at how they stare, just to copy her
Well, roger that
Did you copy that, co-co-copy cat?

[Hook]
I am go-going home
I am go-going home
I shut it down, already
I am go-going home
I am go-going home
I am go-going home
I shut it down, already
I am go-going home

[Outro]
Get ready for the show
We get a lot of dough
And you already, yeah, you already know
That I done shut it down
That's why I'm going home...
