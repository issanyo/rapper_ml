This one is for the boys with the booming systems
Top down, A/C with the cooling systems
When he come up in the club, he be blazin' up
Got stacks on deck, like he saving up

And he ill, he real, he might got a deal
He pop bottles and he got the right kinda build
He cold, he dope, he might sell coke
He always in the air, but he never fly coach

He a motherfucker trip (trip)
Sailor of the ship (ship)
When he make her drip (drip)
Kiss him on the lip (lip)

That's the kinda dude I was looking for
And yes, you'll get slapped if you looking hoe

I said, "Excuse me. You're a hell of a guy
I mean my-my-my-my you're like pelican fly
I'm mean you're so shy and I'm loving your tie
You're like slicker than the guy with the thing on his eye, oh!"

Yes, I did. Yes, I did
Somebody, please them who the f I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up
Back coupes up and chuck the deuce up

Boy, you got my heart beat running away
Beating like a drum and it's coming your way
Can't you hear that boom-ba-doom-boom-boom-ba-doom-boom-bass?
(He got that super bass!)
Boom-ba-doom-boom-boom-ba-doom-boom-bass

This one is for the boys in the polos
Entrepreneur niggas and the moguls
He could ball with the crew. He could solo
But I think I like him better when he do-lo

And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on
He ain't even gotta try to put the mack on
He just gotta give me that look
When he give me that look
Then them panties coming off off! Oh!

I said, "Excuse me. You're a hell of a guy
You know I really got a thing for American guys
I mean sigh. Sickening eyes
I can tell that you're in touch with your feminine side." Uh!

Yes, I did. Yes, I did
Somebody, please tell them who the f I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up
Back coupes up and chuck the deuce up
