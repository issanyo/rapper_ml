[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yes, I'll be your woman, yes, I'll be your baby
Yes, I'll be whatever that you tell me when you're ready
Yes, I'll be your girl, forever your lady
You ain't ever gotta worry, I'm down for you baby

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Best believe that, when you need that
I'll provide that, you will always have it
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that, I'ma let you have it

[Break 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'ma let you have it
I'ma let you have it

[Break 2: Nicki Minaj]
Best believe that, when you need that
Best believe that, when you need that
Best believe that, when you need that
Best believe that, when you need that
Best believe that, when you need that
Best believe that, when you need that
Best believe that

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Beating my drum like, dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma
Banging the drum like, dum di di day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma

[Outro: Alan Lomax]
Be your man
