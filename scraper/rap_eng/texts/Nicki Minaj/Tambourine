But I'm still a boss bitch
Like like don't don't get it twisted like
You know I do this lil this lil this lil party shit
You know tambourine shit
All that shit the u know the drums I got some Africans with me
Sit on ya favorite African face it's nothing
But look, I goes in nigga

[Verse]
Fuck a lick a whore

You got a sick flow? I'm sick-a-more
It's like a game show when I pick a door
Guess who's next to get bodied

Headed to the spot off the I-95

Just got the Benz and I put it in my name
Just got that rope got that dookie gold chain

School bell-a-rang like ting-a-lang-a-lang
