Step up out the car lookin hot-hot
What?!
You don't like my drop top?
Yes!
These are real Dior shades
Quit playing your games this ain't an arcade
Don't be mad if you get my middle finger
Wait a second while I answer to my ringer

Operator: 9-1-1, state the emergency
Caller: Oh my god, this bitch just tried to steal my swag!

[Hook]
Everybody looking at me
Checkin out the way I do me
He can't stop from getting at me (Go girls!)
I guess it's just my swagger
Everybody looking at me
Can't believe they way I do me
Living shiting life in HD
Ha, it is what it is

[Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, ok ok
I was on my way to school
I do's me
I hopped out the drop grabbed my juicy
I hopped, skipped and jumped past them hoopdies
But wait, I forget to grab my looseleaf
I doubled right back, ba-back like 'who's that?'
I did a little dance like kat-ka-boom-kack
I loved how the jocks be watching me-me
So I grabbed my crotch and said 'he-he!'
I be like bum stickity bum while I pop my gum
They lookin' dumb-diggity-dum think they stopping something
I said, 'excuse me honey, I'm the Bugs Bunny
Elmer Fudd ain't got my karats, he ain't got nothing for me!'
Cuz we the Mean Girls, get yes, we're so fetch
And when we in the yard, be jumping double-dutch
We back to the future, 'Pearl Your with best!'

Ha, it is what it is!

[Pearl Future]
I get up to the plate, I don't twitch
Never gonna stop this
'Let's have fun, I won't snitch'
All my real people gon rock this
'Why you wanna go and hate on me?
I got ability'
Don't wanna have to whip your ass

[Hook]
