[Intro: Nolan Lewis]
It’s Nolan Lewis
Half Back remix, up in this

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Work hard just to get half back
(Used to) work hard just to get half back
(Now I, now I, now I) get into it that way (straight up, straight up)
I ain’t coming through unless the bag straight
(I used to) work hard just to get half back
(Used to) work hard just to get half back (used to)

[Verse 1: Nolan Lewis]
Ayo, just last week I told ‘em to pick a side (side)
I bust shots, don’t duck if it don’t apply (it don’t ap)
Uh, bust it open, gynecologist
Diggin’ up dirt on these b, archeologist
Physiologist, all o’ these lies in your mind (mind)
Cross me again then you gon’ hafta do some time
Ai-ain’t got time, for all of the bullsh
I’d rather just pull sh, like you to the finish line
I write a new one publish that track
Working hard just to get half back
Working hard, been on the attack
Tryna blame us just ‘cause we black
Hop on sh and the world go whack
Get a check and then spend at Saks
Fendi prints and Gucci that bag
Urban O’ getting me some glasses, sunglasses
Ain’t skipping no classes
‘Cause that’s where we cash them receipts
Now you know not to mess with me
Milly Rock and bus down that beat
Django whip and nae nae in streets
Yeah we keep it PG-13
Good girl but dancing like eesh

Seh weh yuh feel fi seh
‘Cause I can double that (double it, double it, yah)
Uh, yuh nuh ready
Yuh need fi cum afta mi betta dan dat (better than, better than, yah)
Don’t got patience fo’ the haters (mm-mm)
Y’all can catch up when you join the movement, later (bieee)
‘Cause I’m stacking records
I’m doing much better
So your vendetta (peace)
Look at these knock-offs, I’ll knock their blocks off (mm-hm)
Good grief, Charlie B, their hair’s falling off (ah)
I’m just gon’ brush it off
‘Cause I ain’t need to talk (skrt skrt)
I just make moves, like what it do?
Now they can’t pocket off
I mean profit off (yeah)
Can’t take it? Drop me off (yeah)
No more RG, it’s just Nolie and all his ing Dawgs
Uh
Wasteman, lemme bruk yuh off
Talk is cheap, you ain’t like me, so lemme cut you off (sh)
Yeah
I don’t want your position
Don’t need to cheat on all my sheets to get the pro position (tell ‘em)
Oh now you wan’ start dissing?
Okay, I’ll be efficient
You’re in no position
To come for No’s position (mm-mm)
I ain’t moving weight, but I’m in the dope position
I-I ain’t moving weight, but I’m in the dope position
