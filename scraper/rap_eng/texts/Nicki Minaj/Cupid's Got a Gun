[Verse 1: Shanell]
You watched me fall
Stood over me as I hit the ground
Then he whispered his name in my ear
Such a dark familiar sound

[Chorus: Shanell]
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Now who said he's a lover?
Really he's a murderer


[Bridge 1: Nicki Minaj]
Why you crush, crush, crush my heart?
Why when I try to leave you crush my car ?
Why you crush, crush, crush my heart?
Why when I leave you crush my car?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I'mma put on my long poofy skirt
Man, I should have known he would do me dirt
So miserable I’mma stomp through the puddle
Cupid’s got a weapon, gotta part with the devil
Tell him that I’m done, tell him that I’m not here
Hit him with the lamp, I’mma hit him with a chair
Throw the two sign, I'm done with son
Slow mo as the bullet raise from the gun

[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]
Now girls go and get your gun
Go and buck, buck back, buck back for fun
Now girls go and get your gun
Go and click, click clack, click clack for fun

[Chorus 2: Shanell]
I-I-I-I thought I could trust him
But I-I-I-I didn't see it coming
Cause cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Now who said he's a lover?
Really he's a murderer

[Verse 3: Shanell]
I should have known
By the way he took my breath away
And the way he held me, often hurt me
He told me love was pain
I saw the winding road
Spinning out of control
Surrendered to his wrong direction
Now I don't know where to go
Cause cupid's got a gun
Cupid's got a gun
Now who said he's a lover?
Really he's a murderer

[Chorus 1]
