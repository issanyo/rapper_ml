I'm walking around in circles out of time
Spending out of focus like I lost my hand
Even though I know it's what you did
I'm not gonna show it

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry

Everytime you bruise me with your words
When you look right through me like you haven't heard
It doesn't really matter
Cause even though I'm shattered

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry

Tear drops are frozen, in everything you had
Iâ€™m stuck in the moment, you're never getting back
Cause even though I'm shattered

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try

Proving it, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry
No, no, no, nooo

Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry
Walking around in circles out of time
