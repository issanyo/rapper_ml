{ Verse 1, Ariana Venti} I dont play a nigga unless he playin dead
A good game , now nigga but he ain't there
I dont wanna man less he ain't baptized
But after this you be feeling like you baptized
I dont need a man unless he playin  games
Use a man like he playin  dumb games
But this game is not the Hall of Fame
So im talking about this nigga like he rappin with hes l.a.m.e
