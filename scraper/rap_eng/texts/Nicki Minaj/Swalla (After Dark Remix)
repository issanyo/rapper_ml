Love in a thousand different flavors

I tried to be a gentleman, but all this liquor going to my head
Got me thinking all yall are mine

Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
And when I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that

Shimmy shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy yah
Bad girl do anything for a young
Bust down on my wrist, yes
Told her "Look me in the eyes when I hit that shit"
She said "Boy, if you a freak, well then prove it, then"
And it if did we're maneuvering

You ain't no freak if you don't swalla
