[Intro: Jason Derulo]
Th-th-th-this is the remix
Jason Derulo
(J-J-J-J-J.R.)
And Nicki Minaj
(Beluga Heights)

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
Yeah, everybody looking for love (oh)
Ain't that the reason you're at this club? Oh (huh)
You ain't gon' find it dancing with him, no (no)
I've got a better solution for you, girl, oh (huh)

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (and we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (you the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known
I can see it going down, going down

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screaming loud
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, yeah Th-th-th-this is the remix
In my head, oh, yeah, c'mon

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Nicki Minaj, Young Money
Astronomical
Nimated, so comical
His fantasy takes us to Monaco
A-A-A-All up in his head like a follicle
Haha, bite me
Your money short, five feet
Put me in the ward, psyche
Smash more clubs than Tiger Woods' wifey
Uh, I am the bitch
Wash them dishes and feed me grits
Hit up J.R. and tell him to call Jason
Do a pop song and stack my Caucasians
Cue, now let's head to Beijing
Kiss kiss 'cause I'm in a part of his daydream
There I go, go
There I go-o-o-o (This is the remix)

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
In my head, I see you all over me (baby, all over me)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (fulfill my fantasy)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head

[Bridge: Jason Derulo]
Break it down (ayo, ayo), c'mon on, let's go (ayo)
You're singing to me, baby, in my head right now
(Ayo, ayo), c'mon, yeah (ayo, ayo)
She'll be screaming out when it all goes down

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (and we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (you the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known
I can see it going down, going down

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
In my head, I see you all over me (head)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (head)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud (head, oh, oh)
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, I see you all over me (all over you)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (you do, baby)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud (oh, oh)
In my head, it's going down (in my head)
In my head, it's going down
It's going down in my head
