Yeah, niggas got it all fucked up
Actin' like I ain't hungry, where the lunch truck?
Dinner at Chow's, so they know it's chopsticks all around me
They pop shit and talk loud
We pop shit, man down
Put his chicken, hit 'em with the Kung Pao
Nah mean, like Yao
Money tall, Yao Ming, like wow
Whippin' in the foreign like owwww
Watch when your stock crash like Dow
I'm Mayweather, never throwin' in the towel
And I could go however many rounds
Oh it's beef, we filet the whole cow
Man, these niggas out of bounds
I stay on the court, like a trial
I run things, yup I run things
Put a cover over 'em, they too comfy
Been a Pimp-C, word to Bun B
Crocodile seats, call me Dundee
Fly like Jordan, yup I'm two-three
Don't enter the Dragon, I go Bruce Lee
Nigga I do things, I still move things
Nicki Chun-Li, I be Liu Kang
Now bust it open for me, like the Blue Flame
You see gang-gang, that's my Wu-Tang
Let my jewels hang, that's my mood swang
Call me Slick Rick, they know I rule things
Before I dive in, make sure that pool clean
She got that wet-wet, yeah that juice
What it taste like, top of the food chain
Plates say Liu Kang, that mean the coupe came
Skrrt!
