Pills n potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Hook: Nicki Minaj] x2
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

[Verse 1: Salience]
Yeah, It's kinda crazy how you make me crazy
How you lied and cheated, but I still call you baby
Knew there was something up, cuz you were acting shady
You were my beauty and some beast went and took my lady, no
And how'd you let him take you? I bet he went and paid you
And after it was over, I bet you said "oh, thank you"
I guess my love doesn't compare to how wet he makes you
I guess you weren't scared enough of threats I gave you
I can't believe you did this, after all I've given
After all the time I give you, this is what you give him?
I can't believe that after his sweet talking, you would give in
I really thought you were different (different)
You made me whole but now im down and feeling broken
And I used to live with hope but now my life is living hopeless
This is why I need these

[Verse 2: Salience]
I don't know why I love you, but I know that it's love
I place nothing else above you but that's just not enough
And every time and every day I feel corrupt
Cuz the other half of me says there is no us
It's just you and me, living together, but were apart
And every time we fight I remember the scars
You stabbed me and told me wed never be apart
But all the time we spent makes me tethered to your heart
I guess the reason I forgive you is because your tears are forming
And now were arguing what it seems like every morning
And the closeness that I felt is starting to feel foreign
You start out raining, now your pouring
I can't believe I gave you all my heart and my devotion
You bring me to my highs, then you bring me to my lowest (lowest)
This is why I need these

[Verse 3: Salience]
Yeah, were fucked up arent we? With all the names you call me
And all the times I hurt you, cuz you were cheating on me
I know you think it's okay, just cuz you said sorry
But next time that you harm me you better bring in an army
Cuz you'll need reinforcement with what I'm about to do
I can't believe what I saw, how I found you two
You think you got power, well I got power too
And this time the only thing I won't do is just shout at you
I'm so mad, but somehow you end up on my mind
Cuz I'm so distraught since I'm thinking all the time
That we were so close and you and I were like Bonnie and Clyde
And now I'm broken down cuz now you won't even apologize
And as you let me down again and say your motive
I bottle up my feelings, I won't let out my emotions
This is why I need these

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time we'll be fine
In due time
