I thought you'd changed
I thought you'd changed
But I was wrong again
You're still the same
You're still the same
Rumors never end
There's nothing more
There's nothing left
And now we can't pretend
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never know
I'll never know
Why you hurt me so
We were cool
We were close
But that's so long ago
You create, you fabricate
The shit that you don't know
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
There's nothing more
There's nothing left
And now we can't pretend
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?
