[Chorus: Bantu & Anuel AA]
Father, father, unforgiveable
This is my house, you made it personal
It's always trouble when they go too far
Nobody mess with my familia
Father, father, could you bless his soul?
He talking crazy, I may lose control
It’s always trouble when they go too far (Uah)
Nobody mess with my familia (Anuel)

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
La lealtad vale más que el dinero (Oh-oh)
Y yo me vo' a morir leal y nunca como un traicionero (Oh-oh)
Yo hasta doy la vida por mi familia
Y que en paz descansen los que se mueren de envidia (Amén)
Y en la familia no se falla, pero si te traicionan (Uah)
No les das la espalda, tú lo ayuda' y perdona’ (uah)
La familia primero (Oh-oh)
No lo compra el dinero, oh (Uah)
Real hasta la muerte, baby (Baby)
Real hasta la muerte, baby (Uah)
Yo nunca vo' a traicionarte
Y si tú te cae yo mismo vo' a levantarte, eh

[Chorus: Bantu & Anuel AA]
Father, father, unforgiveable (Brrr, Anuel)
This is my house, you made it personal
It's always trouble when they go too far
Nobody mess with my familia
Father, father, could you bless his soul?
He talking crazy, I may lose control
It's always trouble when they go too far
Nobody mess with my familia

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Mmm, nobody pop off, nobody get murked
Nobody scream, it'll prolly get worse
Now I'm the curse, this is my turf
Before I kill 'em, I’ma torture them first
Bad chiquita, así yo soy bonita
But you about to need a prayer from a preacher
Eye of the tiger, faster than a cheetah
Hop out the spider, then it’s hasta la vista

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Deadline, now you a dead man, fi real
(Dead man, fi real, I tell a dead man fi real)
Deadline, now you a dead man, fi real
(Come pay your debt, man, fi real, I tell you deadline, fi real) Deadline, now you a dead man fi real
(Dead man fi real, I tell a dead man for real)
Deadline, now you a dead man, fi real
(Nobody mess with my familia)

[Chorus: Bantu]
Father, father, unforgiveable
This is my house, you made it personal
It's always trouble when they go too far
Nobody mess with my familia
Father, father, could you bless his soul?
He talking crazy, I may lose control
It’s always trouble when they go too far
Nobody mess with my familia

[Outro: Bantu & Nicki Minaj]
I'm on the edge, don't pull up on me
You pay the price, and that's a warning, oh-woah
(Now you a dead man fi real)
Nobody mess with my familia
This is my home, this is my city
If I go down, you coming with me, oh-woah
(Now you a dead man fi real)
Nobody mess with my familia
