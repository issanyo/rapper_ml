[Verse 1: Mya]
Let me get that
Slick back, put my hair in a ponytail, (ponytail)
And if you get that
Pull that
From da back, baby can you make me wet, (make me wet)

[Pre-Chorus]
O oh oh
That's fine
Oh oh oh
All night... If you Qualify

[Chorus]
Just let me get that
Slick back, put my hair in a ponytail, (ponytail)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Damn right a B*tch Qualified
I should work for Homicide
Kill these guys, Put em on forensic files
Uh... M-M-Man down when I bring da Lamb round
He say nicki u da best Hands down
Flyer than a Airlift
Pull it with no hairclips
Ponytail, no Scrunchie
Parrachute, No bungy
Peggy and Al Bundy
Ballin like Van Gundy
Alligator Heels on
Crocodile Dundy

[Outro]
Pull it, Pull it
Pull it, Pull it
Pull it Pull it
Pull it, Pull it
Pull it, Pull it
Pull it Pull it
