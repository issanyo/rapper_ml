[Hook: Yummy]
I really thought we could've worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldn't stop playing around
Didn't understand, but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
It's a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad, baby
So sad
Look at all that we could've had
Just too bad

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Oh, that's how you feeling' huh?
Caught in your feelings huh?
I'm like the late great Aaliyah 'One in a Million' ma
I was dealing ma, introduce you to dealing ma
You ain't even know a fan could go up on the ceiling ma
But that was yesterday, them games I never played
Money, cars, clothes, hoes all up on my resume
You need a 80 bucks you would  call your baby up
I been about cash money, I’ma call Baby up, or the homie Slim
Mack and Weezy too. I spit fish grease easy I get greasy too
You my favorite book, I love reading you
But come through true woo is what you need to do

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo Cam’ I'm the baddest bitch
You was acting mad happy when you bagged this bitch
You was telling my mother you love me all the time
Pink range you was pushing that was sort of mine
Late night New York fried chicken spots and all
125th and Lenox outside the mall
Now you running' round fronting' like you paid in full
My nigga you ain't Rico this ain't Paid in Full
Okay, I mean I love you I'm fronting the feeling's mutual
But you ain't getting me back man you delusional
I should have been left your ass huh?
Oh that chicken head you fucking with, ask her!
