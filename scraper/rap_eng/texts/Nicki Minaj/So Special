[Intro:]
This one goes out to you
Yeah
You know who you are
Look

[Verse:]
I guess I'm wrong for thinking that I could trust you
For never holding all of that sh- against you
But now I’m strapped with my .45 special
I’m so special, so special, so special
Nigga, you softer than a homosexual
And I am so extraterrestrial
So you can keep my things
There's nothing you can bring
And you can have my ring, you can add it to your bling
Cause I’m okay and I’m still a G
Pray for my enemies, my name’s still Nicki
In time you’ll change, but time don’t freeze
You better leave before you get wetter than Pisces
