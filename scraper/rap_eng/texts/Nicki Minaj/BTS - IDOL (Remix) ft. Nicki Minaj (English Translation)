[Verse 1: RM, J-Hope]
You can call me artist (artist)
You can call me idol (idol)
No matter what you call me
I don’t care
I’m proud of it (proud of it)
I’m free (free)
No more irony (irony)
Cuz I was always just me

[Refrain 1: Suga, RM]
They point fingers at me
But I don’t care at all
Whatever the reason for your criticism is
I know what I am (I know what I am)
I know what I want  (I know what I want)
I never gon’ change (I never gon’ change)
I never gon’ trade
(Trade off)

[Verse 2: J-Hope, Suga]
FACE OFF, just like John Woo, ay
Top star with that spotlight, ay
Sometimes like a superhero
I'm your Anpanman
24 hours isn’t enough
Can’t afford to be confused
I do my thang (I do my thang)
I love myself (I love myself)

[Refrain 2: Jungkook, V]
I love myself, I love my fans
Love my dance and my what
There are hundreds of me’s inside of me
I’m facing a new me again today
It’s all me anyway
So instead of worrying, I’m just gonna run
Runnin’ man
Runnin’ man

[Bridge: Jimin, Jin]
I’m so fine wherever I go
Even if it takes a while sometimes
It’s okay, I’m in love with my-my myself
It’s okay, I’m happy in this moment

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh what’s good, Korea
You know I've been a boss for my whole career
I’m 'bout to Jet in the Lear
And put more than my hands in the air
Hands in the air, put your hands in the air
If you getting money, rubber bands in the air
Never gave an eff, they can cancel my care
'Cause if he look good, throw my pants in the air
I’m here word to John Mayer
Barbie’s a wonderland my face is top tier
I swear watch the ice glare
They be like I’m Gucci but don’t shop there
One time, press rewind
Tryna come up off Nicki name press decline
So much power in the mind, yes divine
Take your change you’ll never be next in line

[Chorus: RM, Jimin]
You can’t stop me lovin’ myself
Eolssu, I like it
You can’t stop me lovin’ myself
I like the shouts
You can’t stop me lovin’ myself

[Hook: All, Jungkook]
