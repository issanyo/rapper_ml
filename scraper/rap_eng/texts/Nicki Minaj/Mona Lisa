[Intro]
You made me
You made me
Ooooooh
You made me

[Hook]
If you look at my
If you look at my heart
You'll see
You'll see ain't no love left for we

See
Ain't no love left for we
Ain't no love left for we
I'll never take a knee, cuz there ain't love left for me

If you look at my
If you look at my heart
Ain't no love left for we
And ain't a worry 'bout me

Forget for my love
Cuz ain't a worry 'bout me
Forget for my love, please
I ain't never chase a flee, ain't a worry bout me

[Verse]
You had me posted
On the shelf, like a trophy
Had me diving into oceans
Over loving so atrocious

Wore my heart up on my sleeve
You knew how to make me bleed
Causing every scene, tryna cop a plea
All I wanted was some reciprocity

You make me...
Make me get buck
You never gave no fucks
You done lied to me too many too much

Times up
All the bullshit lines up
You gone miss me more than you diss me
Gone get ya nine up

[Hook]
(Look at my...)
If you look at my
If you look at my heart
You'll see
You'll see ain't no love left for we

See
Ain't no love left for we
Ain't no love left for we
I'll never take a knee, cuz there ain't love left for me

If you look at my
If you look at my heart
Ain't no love left for we
And ain't a worry 'bout me

Forget for my love
Cuz ain't a worry 'bout me
Forget for my love, please
I ain't never chase a flee, ain't a worry bout me

[Bridge]
You make me...
I don't wanna fight, but
I'll fuck around and shoot you
I don't wanna fight
But you've given me no choice
I will fuck around & end your life...

[Hook]
If you look at my
If you look at my heart
You'll see
You'll see ain't no love left for we

See
Ain't no love left for we
Ain't no love left for we
I'll never take a knee, cuz there ain't love left for me

If you look at my
If you look at my heart
Ain't no love left for we
And ain't a worry 'bout me

Forget for my love
Cuz ain't a worry 'bout me
Forget for my love, please
I ain't never chase a flee, ain't a worry bout me
