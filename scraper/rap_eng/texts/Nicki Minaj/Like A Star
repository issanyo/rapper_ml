You know I'm a flirt, flirt, baby

Girl you so bad, just drop for a little
Make it come back and gon' make it wiggle
Watch them be mad, and girl you official, yeah

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Throw the confetti, I'm wild petty
Tell your hoes go and drain my spaghetti
And don't gas 'em without Getty
Kitty on jet ski, panties and a wet tee
Give 'em that water ride, this that Six Flags
This that moan Chanel Boy Brick Bag
Bitch, I'm bomb, in Balmain
Hedi Slimane, Saint Laurent
Who better than  Nicki? Man, I can't eff'in' tell
Every time I drop, bitches like, "FML"
Hahaha, you in the game? I own my own game
I only respect them hoes that own they own plane
Young Griselda, slicin' up
I ain't got no competition so my price is up
I'm the heavyweight champ, Mike Tyson'd up
And I used to be a bitch, but I nicen'ed up

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, just like a star, babe
Ayy, shot from afar, babe
Ayy, spaceship to Mars, babe
Ayy, if it's mine then it's yours, baby
Ayy, just like a star, babe
Ayy, a shot from afar, baby
Ayy, a spaceship to Mars, babe
Ayy, if it's mine then it's yours, baby
Let me see if you can shake for a little
Girl you so bad, just drop for a little
Make it come back and gon' make it wiggle
Watch them be mad, and girl you's official
Ayy, just like a star, babe
Ayy, shot from afar, babe
Ayy, spaceship to Mars, babe
Ayy, if it's mine then it's yours, baby
Ayy, just like a star, babe
Ayy, a shot from afar, baby
Ayy, a spaceship to Mars, babe
Ayy, if it's mine then it's yours, baby
Let me see if you can shake for a little
Girl you so bad, just drop for a little
Make it come back and gon' make it wiggle
Watch them be mad, and girl you's official
