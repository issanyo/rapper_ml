She got a body like an hourglass
But I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac
But I can send you into overdrive, oh

[Pre-Estribillo]

Step on up, swing your bat
You see anybody could be bad to you
You need a good girl to blow your mind

[Estribillo]
Bang bang into the room
(I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you
(I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute, let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
Bang bang there goes your heart
(I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car
(I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)

We dipping in the powder blue, four door

Go, Batman, robbin' it
Bang bang, cockin' it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent

See anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind (your mind)

[Estribillo]
Bang bang into the room
(I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you
(I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
