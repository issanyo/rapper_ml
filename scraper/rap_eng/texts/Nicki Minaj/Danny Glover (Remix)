[Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'm a save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'm a call my partner 'fore her, I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I fuck, I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet, just like two midgets

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Who the fuck told them that Trae not the king of the streets, shit I rep like no other
Yea I get money like Diddy, but everything else by me came out the gutter
That's why I pull up with no ceilings like Weezy, yelling fuck a hater no rubber
Dare one of you pussies to run up on me, it be over put that on my mother
I-I am not backing down, hang up my chopper, no fucking round
Fucking with me, I'm a shut it down
Bullets come flying, no ducking down
Won't nothing be funny, I'm not a clown
Have killers and (jail) niggas touching down
Shut the fuck up, not a fucking sound
You no longer shit cause I'm back in town
Money so long, I ain't got a fucking limit
Haters get brushed, name shit (shouldn't been in it)
Hoes ain't shit, give em' back like they rented
Trusain bolt, every night I run up in it
Everything black, presidential lose city
Niggas can't see me like a young nigga tinted
Home town temple, for the crown I'll win it
Stay on point, other niggas can't pin it

[Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'm a save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'm a call my partner 'fore her, I fuck her mother

Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I got a pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab

[Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'm a save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'm a call my partner 'fore her, I fuck her mother

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Every time I come out I ainâ€™t never with no new bitches
These bitches is stealing, I'mma sue bitches
Dripping down his dick, this pussy too vicious
Every time I fuck him I say "Whose is it?"
Who the fuck tell 'em that they was like Nicki? Oh no, bitches didn't!
I'mma give bitches a minute of shine then I'll tell 'em good riddance
To raise a child, it might take a village
But I wouldn't know cause these bitches my sons; yes, they was, and they still is
Gave him the kitten, now that nigga smitten
Told him to hop in my foreign and then I said "No, I'm just kiddin'!"
Hell of a livin', you bitches on chitlins
When I come out of my mansion I sprinkle some bread to the pigeons
Bitches is lyin', they lyin', they lyin', they lie in they bio
So I ain't fuckin' with chickens unless I got pico de gallo
Girls is plottin', what more could they steal?
Tell Justin Timberlake that I am comin for Jessica Biel
Bitch I'm a star-rah, you niggas, I holla tomarrah
Doors go up cause I am too rich to cop a Gallardo
No regular doors, on Aventadors
Painted it pink just so I could take pictures while you rented yours
Hell of a ticket, hell of a price
I want it, I get it, I wire the money, I never think twice
I am not gay, but lesbi precise
Cause if she pretty, then watch it cause I'mma be fuckin' ya wife

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Ok, cool, ok, bu, I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my partner befo' I fuck the mother
I pay them in molly, now kiss each other
Everytime I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, tha doppy whip, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got 2 digits
Money stand like 8ft, just like 2 midgets
So shawty gonna trippin get some new chicks
Let me tell you what I did
And I bought a new whip
Filled it with some cute, bitches
While they was on IG, taking a new pic
I was in the bushes in the Valentine day
With a K, tryna shoot Cupid
Think im playing, for the cab 50 bands
And whateva's stacked in that Minnie Van
You pro'ly can't relate to what I'm saying, yall niggas
Talking up foul
I do some shit you pro'ly neva did in yo life
Well I don't talk about it
Trust me now, nigga, cause you ain't 'bout that life
Hustle Gang nigga, got a pro'lem with that?
Bring the motherfucking mob and the pro'lem begins
If you ever leave from me, ain't no circling back
I bet your bitch hang up the phone, you be callin' her back
Go hard as a mother fucker
Getting head from a couple broads in this motherfucka
Ain't no more fuckin credit cards in this motherfucka
Bank Roll count 50 large in this motherfucka
