Its a perfect day*
The coolest breeze
Not a cloud in the sky
Casts a shade on me
Colours shining bright
Oh, Its so surreal
And on this perfect day
I got lost
Get me out of this confusion
I'm falling apart
I've got an aching heart
I'm so out of place

[Chorus:]
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
On a perfect day
I'm drowning in memories
Throw me a lifeline, don't think its my time
And I can hardly breathe
Oh, why did you have to leave
On a perfect day

[Chorus:]
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
We all know that you're not a lonely heart
We can't stand the laws
You're watching over us, taking care of us
Until we meet again, my friend
You are everything to me and I love you for it
But now you're gone
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on, so carry on, I carry on
It'll be okay
