[Verse 1]
Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed ’em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back now I’m scary to zombies
Bring the heat to a sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't giving, so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to get in my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck, yeah, cause a Queen is what I embody, uh



[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn

[Verse 2]
Yo, you can't wear Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
You drink CÎROC now? Okay, you P. Diddy?
Oh, you a young G Herbo or Lil Bibby?
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you ’Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, oh, you Nas, bae?
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it’s really your passion would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat and tears in perfecting my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
Kobe, KD, Kyrie! Pick a K

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (Mmm)
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn

[Bridge]
See ya, see you
See ya, see you

[Outro]
To my surprise I saw you
To my surprise I knew you were
