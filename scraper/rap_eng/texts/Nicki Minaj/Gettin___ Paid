[Hook]
I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
And if you not talking money then I don’t understand your language

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
It's going down, down Barbie, pushing a pink Ferrari
I race through Africa just to see the safari
I am the baddest bitch in America
Slicker than a Jheri curl, just ask Erykah
The black Sarah Jessica, J-J-Jessica!
Don't be text messaging me, I never check my messages
Only thing you could ask me is how I want my sandwiches
I want more cheese, lots and lots of cheese
And when I'm on the stage I'm with SB
And when you see my luggage it says LV
And when I'm on the plane it's so empty
Hmmm, that's why all those female rappers envy

[Hook/Outro (Spoken)]
Oh, I'm sorry. Did she say something? My bad
You know, maybe I was booked. I guess I missed ya
You know, when you're booked four times a week every week, it's kinda hard to keep track of bum bitches
Oh, you do the math
It's barbie, bitch!
