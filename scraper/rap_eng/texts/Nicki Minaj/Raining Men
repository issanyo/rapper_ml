Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by a toe
If ya want to, let him go

Ladies don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Always raining men, girl, what you worried 'bout?

Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya"
You got me mistaken thinkin' you gon' get it easy
First of all you need to know that I'm not the one
Think you getting something baby, you ain't getting none

All you need to know that I'm a 2 times five
Load it, cock it, aim it baby, boom bye bye
Set your standards lower boy, you're aiming too high
Matter of fact your friend looks better so (huh) good bye

Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by a toe
If ya want to, let him go

Ladies don't worry cause they got plenty more

Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Always raining men girl what you worried 'bout?

[Nicki Minaj]
Ex-ex-excuse me but who are you fixing to be
Let them muthafuckas know there's plenty fish in the sea
And we sweating me just 'cause I got the tightest hoe
But I couldn't find that thing with a microscope

Give me dom dom-da-da-da-da-da-dom-dom-dom
I ain't tripping on your money, money, long, long, long
Got my own TV production company
So tell her bout it hit me, silly
Anyway RiRi, what rhymes with your name freely?

Money got you vacationing in Chile?
Do you wanna sit on my balcony like really really really
No for real, really?
Laid down on the beach, they be feeding me my catfishes
'Cause it's raining men
Fat bitches

Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out

Now they big, living good, doing big things
Dancing don't pay, player keep the money, I can buy my own brain
Up in the club, see men coming dime a dozen so it don't mean nothing to me
And I ain't even worried bout you homey cause there's plenty more fish in the sea

Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by a toe

Ladies don't worry cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Always raining men girl what you worried 'bout?
