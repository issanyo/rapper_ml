The artist who made the video for ‘Only’ was influenced by a cartoon on Cartoon Network called Metalocalypse and Sin City. Both the producer and person in charge of overseeing the lyric video (one of my best friends and videographer: A. Loucas), happen to be Jewish. I didn’t come up with the concept, but I’m very sorry and take full responsibility if it has offended anyone. I’d never condone Nazism in my art.
