[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo Ester, never been a guesser
But I bet my bottom dollar, bitches under pressure
Moved out to LA, now it's like I sell yay
Money so offensive, niggas call me Elway

[Hook: Ester Dean]
You wanna—
Gimme money, gi-gimme money. Gimme money
I’d rather have your time, time
I’d rather spend your time, time
You can—
Gimme money, gi-gimme money. Gimme money
I’d rather have your time, time
’Cause I got mine

[Verse 1: Ester Dean]
Sit down, let me buy you a drink, boy (Na na na)
You’ve never seen a chick like me, boy (Na na na)
Your money ain’t a thing that I need, boy (Na na na)
I bought the new crib, keep the rent, boy (Na na na)

[Pre-hook: Ester Dean]
I can have what I want, I can buy what I want
All I need is your attention
I can have anything that I want
But I just want you!

[Hook: Ester Dean]

[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
Your money can’t buy everything, boy (Na na na)
I need your love more than a ring, boy (Na na na)
Yeah, I like nice things, that’s the icing (Na na na)
But you gotta give me more and make me your girl (Na na na)

[Pre-hook: Ester Dean]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo Ester, never been a guesser
But I bet my bottom dollar, bitches under pressure
Moved out to LA, now it's like I sell yay
Money so offensive, niggas call me Elway
If I needed money, I would be up in the bank
The crib got exotic fishes in the tank
The 24 gold karat, dishes in the sank
Them bum bitches just be taking pictures when they plank
You wanna gimme money, gimme money, gimme money uhh
I'm up in Hong Kong rocking Shojono Tomo
Lobster, sushi rolls with a side of soy sauce
Chopsticks, you know we don't give a fork

[Outro: Ester Dean]
All on me [x9]
