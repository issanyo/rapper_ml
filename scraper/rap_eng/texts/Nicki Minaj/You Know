[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You know, baby
Somethin' 'bout you lately
You know, you know, you never
Cease to amaze me

[Hook: Meek Mill]
And you know, and you know
He don't be fuckin' you like I be fuckin' you
He wanna hug you and make you uncomfortable
You know, shawty, you know
All you gotta do is hit a nigga phone one time
I'mma pull up on you fourth quarter when it's crunch time
You know

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When I pull up to the crib (Pull up, pull up)
Hurry up and get dressed (What's up? What's up?)
Spend a couple hours on your makeup
Twenty minutes, I done made that to a mess
And you know like I know
I was your side nigga, you was my side hoe
He broke you in, I'm the one broke you out, though
'Cause you got that D and you turned to El Chapo
Run from that nigga if he tries to buy you Aldo
This that Givenchy, that new Saint Laurent flow
This that go cash out that G65 flow
I like you, you hit the lotto
I put you on to the Perc and Moscato
I put you on to fuckin' in Cabo
Said we would only fuck once and would stop, though
You know that's a lie, though

[Hook: Meek Mill]
And you know, and you know
He don't be fuckin' you like I be fuckin' you
He wanna hurt you and make you uncomfortable
You know, shawty, you know
All you gotta do is hit a nigga phone one time
I'mma pull up on you fourth quarter when it's crunch time
You know

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Oh, you know, they don't never do it better than the boy
Have you in the dealer like a kid pick a toy
Lord, she say that she never been on a PJ, mile high
Fuck her and her friend on the PJ
You know, I flew that girl to Turks on her b-day
I got up under her skirt on her b-day
Know I keep it in the stash house on keepsake
Know I walked in, a hundred thou' on the pre-k
Yeah, a hundred thou', back to back for a week straight
Girl, you know how we play

[Hook: Meek Mill]
And you know, you know
He don't be fuckin' you like I be fuckin' you
He wanna hurt you and make you uncomfortable
You know, shawty, you know
All you gotta do is hit a nigga phone one time
I'mma pull up on you fourth quarter when it's crunch time
You know

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
You stay a hundred with me, I stay a hundred with you
They wasn't fuckin' with me, 'cause I was fuckin' with you
They said, "She fuckin' with him"
I'm like, "She fuckin' with who?"
'Cause now she fuckin' with me, ha

[Hook: Meek Mill]
He don't be fuckin' you like I be fuckin' you
He wanna hug you and make you uncomfortable
You know, shawty, you know
All you gotta do is hit a nigga phone one time
I'mma pull up on you fourth quarter when it's crunch time
You know

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Meek Mill]
You know, baby
Somethin' 'bout you lately
You know, you know, you never
Cease to amaze me
You know, baby
Somethin' 'bout you lately
You know, you know, you never
Cease to amaze me
One time, crunch time, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
