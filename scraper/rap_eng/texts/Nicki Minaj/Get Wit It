Verse 1: Nicki Minaj
I just put guiseppes on my motherfuc-ing feet
Just 'cuz I'm flyer than um- tweet-tweet
Before I hit the star, get a um- sneak peek
A sneak-sneak peek and some sweet antiques
That's 'cuz I'm a boss, lil mama, step your cookie up
I'm a pro, and you be getting your rookie up
Get wit it, little mama, get wit it
When my bitch in the New York fittest, (I see you)
Pink push-up bra with my t-ts in
I'm a rapper, singer, actor slash vixen
Yeah, I know they hate, I don't care-erer
Nicki Minaj, Young Smiley in your area
