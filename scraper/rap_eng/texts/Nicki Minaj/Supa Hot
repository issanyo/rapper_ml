[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, Okay, Me, I'm the Barbie, Im supa hot
When I'm at the dealership, Should I get the coop or not?
Should I get the roofer truck? Should I get the choo choo truck?
Yeah I get them bookoo bucks, cuckoo for the Cocoa Puffs
I'm cuckoo for Cuckoo Puff, got money in my Louis duff
Plus I got a nasty flow. Bitch, I spit the gooey stuff!
Its going D-O-W-N, I am the barbie where the fuck is Ken, Ken, Ken?
I be on 1.7 in the rock, that's my block
New York City to the top, tippy top, bust a shot
I said, I be on 1.7 in the rock, that's my block
New York City to the top, tippy top, bust a shot
