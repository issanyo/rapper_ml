[Intro]
Am I just a fool? Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl? So young and naive to think you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold hearted shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

[Chorus]
And now the people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano

[Verse]
I don't give a fuck about people
You got me out of my reason
I feel I'm loosing my religion, but I'm still praying for you
Tú me deslumbras con tu actitud
Y esque nadie lo hace como lo haces tú
I won't be anything without you
I've been living this life like a bad trip. But then you rescue me
I used to dont give a fuck about nothing, but then you changed me
I've been living this life like a bad trip. But then you rescue me
I used to dont give a fuck about nothing, but then you changed me

[Chorus]
And now the people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano

[Outro]
So play on, play on, play on Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on Play on, play on
