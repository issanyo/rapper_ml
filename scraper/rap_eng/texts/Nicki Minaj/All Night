[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ice Mic, Nicki Minaj, nigga
Young Money, bitches
Made creations
Let's get it
Let's get it
Ahhhh
Kuh!
Ahhh

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Think you better than me, top me then
I'm Nicki Minaj, looking for some popsi twins
Bitches know that I be flyer than a turbulence
Favorite colors pink and purple and feds circling
Anyway I'm, overseas on vacation girls
Sitting in the VIP with some Geisha girls
Oh, 'scuse me busta, light ya dutch up
I'm the mustard, time to ketchup (catch up)
Fuck around and catch a couple slugs to your Yaki
Get me my collard greens, my chicken teriyaki
I get the club j-j-j-j-jumping
Can't tell me nothing, couldn't even tell me something
Icy, icy, icy hot
And matter fact, I know a real nice pricey spot
I'm bout to gimme everything Ice Mic could cop
Red underneath the shoes, no Nike shop
