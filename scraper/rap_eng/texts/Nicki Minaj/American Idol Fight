[Nicki Minaj]
Think I'm playing! This shit is a fucking joke!
This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke?
Say one more disrespectful thing to me.
Say one more disrespectful thing to me --
I'll go up against your head!

[Randy Jackson]
Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out.

[Mariah Carey]
I am not being disrespectful.

[Nicki Minaj]
Up against your head!
Up against your head

Don’t tell me I'm insecure, don’t tell me I'm inadequate,
You gone get sent to [inaudible] over that!;
Don’t- You done came on idol feeling unsure, feeling inadequate.
You’re the insecure one sitting up there running down her resume every five minutes.

Every time you take a shot at me I'mma take it back,
And if you gotta fucking problem then handle it.

I told them, I'm not fucking putting up with your fucking highness over there
Figure it the fuck out. Figure it out.

[Mariah Carey]
Why, why...

[Nicki Minaj]
Figure it out.

[Mariah Carey]
... do I have a 3-year-old sitting around me?

[Nicki Minaj]
I’m not sitting here for 20 minutes
And having you run down your resume everyday.
No! Goodbye!

[Mariah Carey]
Listen... I can’t see my kids because you decided to make...
To have ... to have a little baby fit and going all around the stage.

[Nicki Minaj]
Good, well then go see them now, go see them now.
You’re boring as fuck! You’re boring as fuck!
