(Chorus:)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (Just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (Whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

(Nicki:)
I was on my way to school; I do'z me
I hopped out the drop grabbed my juicy
I hopped, skipped, and jumped past them hoopdies
But, wait I forgot to grab my loose leaf

I doubled right back b-back like who's that?
I did a little dance like cat b-boom cat
I love how the jocks be watchin me me
So I grab my crotch and say he he!

I be like bum diggety bum when I pop my gum
They lookin dumb diggety dumb
Think they stopping something

I said excuse me, honey
I'm b-bugs bunny
Elmer Fudd ain’t got my carrots
He ain’t got nothin' for me

Cause we the mean girls; y-yes we're so fetch
And when we in the yard, be jumping double dutch
We back to the future; Pearl, you're with the best
Hair, hair, hair, hair

(Chorus)x2

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok) (Just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (Whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

(Willow:)

I'mma get more shine in a little bit
Soon as I hit the stage a-pplause; I'm hearing it
Whether it's black stars, black cars, I'm feeling it
But can't none of them whip it like I do
I....
I gets it in; mmm yeah, I go hard
When they see me pull up, I whip it real hard
I whip it real hard (whip it whip it)
Real hard, I whip it real hard
(I whip it real hard)

Don't let haters keep me off my grind
Keep my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I'm down and I feel like giving up

(Chorus)x2

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok) (Just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (Whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

(All my ladies if you feel it come on
Do it, do it, whip your hair
Don't matter if it's long short
Do it, do it, whip your hair)x2

Your hair
Your hair

(Chorus)

I whip my hair back and forth (Ok)
I whip my hair back and forth (Ok)
I whip my hair back and forth (Ok)
I whip my hair back and forth (Ok)

(Chorus)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my
