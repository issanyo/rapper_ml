Doctor, doctor, need you bad, call me, babe
Doctor, doctor, where you at? Give me something
I need your love, I need your love, I need your loving
You got that kind of medicine that keeps me coming

My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you'll know how to save me
I've been feeling real low
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

Boy, I'm aching, make it right
My temperature is super high
If I scream, if I cry
It's only 'cause I feel alive

My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you'll know how to save me
I've been feeling real low
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

You've got my life in the palm of your hands
Come and save me now, I know you can

Don't let me die young
I just want you to father my young
I just want you to be my doctor
We can get it cracking chiropractor
I know you can save me and make me feel alive

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
