I hang on every word you said and
No one could get inside my head like you
Then I guess I was a fool for you then
But now I understand
It was all part off your plan
And you should know that

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

Dear God if you can hear me know
Please stop the anger building up inside me
I need you to come and guide me
I look into the eyes
Of the one I thought was mine
And my only scream is

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

No one could get inside my head
You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart
