[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, gotta hit him on the jack
When you comin' back? Where is you at on the map?
Everything is intact
Coulda been a seamstress, still wouldn't cut him slack
Pretty much, ain't got a clue
Itty bitty piggyback off everything I do
But I'm still droppin' jaws
Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards (Oh-oh-oh)
Back to you, I'm so into you
For real, breh like I'm kin to you
If you a 10, I add 10 to you
They be mad when I tend to you
That's what the bae like
Call me Buffy 'cause that's what I slay like
These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight
These niggas wanna know what it tastes like
What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo
They wanna know what it tastes like, yo
All this ice, it should taste like snow
Get kimonos and let's fly to Tokyo
Pretty, pretty please baby, won't you cop this for me? Uh

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Baby, could you? I got too much on my mind right now (Oh-oh-oh)
I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent now
Could you? I got too much on my mind right now (Oh-oh-oh)
Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'

[Chorus: Post Malone & Nicki Minaj]
