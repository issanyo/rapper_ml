We're fussing and fighting
I keep on trying
To mend this but you won't
Meet me half way
You say it's over
But I want you closer
What have I got to do
Just say the words

We're being crazy
We're acting so lazy
Let's put in the time
And we'll go back to
Us against the universe It'll be you and me
Us against the universe It'll be you and me

If you need
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
You are oh, oh, oh
You are oh, oh, oh
You are, you are
You're my addiction

Caught in a moment
Where I keep on hoping
Soon you'll come 'round
And see my point of view
Won't ask no questions
I'm craving your presence
There's no prescription
To get me over you
Been thinking lately
You'll say yes not maybe
Just speak the words
And we'll go back to
Us against the universe It'll be you and me

If you need
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
You are oh, oh, oh
You are oh, oh, oh
You are, you are
You're my addiction

We're fussing and fighting
I keep on trying
To mend this but you won't meet me half way
