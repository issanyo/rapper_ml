It's been 7 days of constant rain
I miss you, oh I miss you
Feeling swept away there's no barricade without you
What can I do

And everything protecting me has all been stripped away

Cuz I'm....

Chorus:
Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

I could try to change
But nothing fits the way that
You do, oh yeah you do
From every strangers eyes you're my best diguise
I need you
I still need you

And everything that comforts me has all been stripped away

Cuz I'm...

Chorus:
Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

The moments we share are all that I wear
It's colde without you
Now I have to try to get through another night

Cuz I feel...

Chorus:
Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked
