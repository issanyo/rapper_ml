[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Excuse me, can I see your dang-a-lang, brother?
I mean, you know, juggle your balls like the Ringling Brothers
I'm the Harajuku Barbie, I ain't trippin' on your change
I mean, look, I got the sports package on my Range
I just dip in the pink for the pink effect
D-D-D-Diamonds on my neck for the link effect
And I was wondering if I could lip-sync on that
You know my name ring (ding!) ring tinkerbells
W-W-W-Watch (Check!)
Chain (Check!)
They be on the rain (Check!)
I be on the move, they be reaching but they canâ€™t catch
I be with the baddest bitch on the island stylin'
Black Miley Cyrus, sayin' hi to pirates
I be singing them ballads when he tossing my salad
When I pet my parrot, all you see is colorful carrots
I be singing them ballads when he tossing my salad
When I pet my parrot, all you see is colorful carrots
