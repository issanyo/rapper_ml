Wanna make a change, change

[Nicki Minaj]
Excuse me little daddy but i'm sorry
Its just that... i'm kinda late
I have to pick up my Ferrari
I came out swingin', Nextel was ringin'
Name one thing that Nicki ain't been in
When I knock boots bet he gon be spinnin'
Cuz I got juice like they put gin in
See, I dilly dally. Ran out to Cali
Bumped into my nigga named Mega from the alley
Went out to London, partied at the Dungeon
Got them Bvlgaris, every color it comes in
It ain't dirty money, and it ain't dipset, Then ya
Ain't on my level. You ain't did shit Yet
You ain't seen the world, you ain't seein' a girl
Let me brush my bangs, Let me flip my curls
Fuck wrong wit chu? Fuck wrong wit them?
S-A-S Nigga! Nicki M

Yo! Yo! Yo!

Listen
Yo, How you gon' talk about the game
If you never been in it, in it, in it, in it?
And when you 'bout to get started
I'm already bout to finish, finish, finish
Said you don't like the way I live
And the way I wear my fitteds, fitteds, fitteds
I'll let you self-destruct
Good riddance, riddance, riddance, riddance!
Haters yap... but y'all don't understand
The smile that I got under my Raiders cap
Laters man. Where the party at?
Where my Ferrari at?
I'm at a party when you like
Where my Atari at?
Stuck at home when I'm like
Where my safari hat?
I'm on vacation while you're like
Where my McDonalds hat?
At work, Lookin' at fry guys
And Hamburglars
I'm with a fly gal that like to percolate
She make me cry out. She so immaculate
I'm an international baccalaureate
Huh, where you been bro?
Yes you been broke
I know you slept while I wrote 'til my pen broke
Now I'm lookin through my forty-story window
While you're out in the storm where the wind's cold
'Cuz what you make in one life, I'm making ten fold

Yo! Yo! Yo!
I do it 'cuz it's all about the fame
And I do it 'cuz it's all about the game
And I do it 'cuz I wanna make a name
For myself 'cuz everybody change
Wanna make a change, change
'Cuz I need that change, change
I dont wanna hear my piggy bank go (Clink)
Wanna make a change, change
'Cuz I need that change, change
Cuz I want a briefcase full of
Wanna make a change, change
'Cuz I need that change, change
I dont wanna hear my piggy bank go (Clink)
Wanna make a change, change
'Cuz I need that change, change
Cuz I want a briefcase full of
