[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I came out the Bentley, with Mr. Bentley
Three on my pinky, no, not the MP
Yes, I'm the girl that they heard of, I commit murder
When I r-rhyme I body them one time
To get it, I do it cause I did it
I'm the president, and I will omit it
I'm looking for a dude that'll pamper me
Go and spend a couple G's when he think of me
You know, them nice whips
Ice on my clips
Good jeans on my hips, that be the jean with the rips
Yeah, you gotta keep my wrist all cloudy
This Ang Demar and Nicki Minaj, shawty
