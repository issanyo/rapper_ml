[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ya girl been hot since Corduroys
Since quarter waters,and all the boys used to
Try to beat like the corner boys
'Cause they heard the pussy wetter, than themDorney rides
Fuck with who? Fucks with you
As long as them checks clear like Huxtable
I’m known to hang, with a thug or two
Niggas that only do, what a thug would do
Ask about me, the FEDS watch daily
Gettin’ more cheese, more bread than a deli
And I’m getting’ love, fan mail like Melly
And I throw it up, twelve o’clock when I wheelie
I’m in the A, I scoop my nigga J
Coupe gotta be grey, you gotta get paid
Ain’t nothin’ worse, than being a broke bitch
I always got crack, I tell ‘em to smoke this

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, ya boy been nice since thunder cats
Since leather boomers and lumber jacks
Come outside with a hundred stack
Jeans with the sweat pants under that, yeah
Front on who? Not on me
Niggas know I keep the seventeen shot on me
Made a lil something off rap, lot off D
Get your points off another nigga, not off me
Air forces, new trues and a crispy tee
New coupe, nigga, CL-63
Cost you nothin’, we get hit for free
With Nicki, matter fact, nah, the bitch with me

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
So you wanna sip goose and play Nintendo Wii? No
Get the bricks and flip the yayo
Chirp, if you looking for the work
Hundred dollars of pussy, my misses getting’ busy
FEDs getting dizzy, niggas trying to get me
So I change the sizzy combination, to the cizzy
Brand new V, that’s what I get for pitchin
Nice little crib, a couch that I could sit in
Umm, I mean sit on, blow piff, fuck a bitch on
Oops, I mean feller, keeps the umbrell-er
And I only fuck with them paper makers
