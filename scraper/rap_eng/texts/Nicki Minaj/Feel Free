[Nicki Minaj:]
Hopped off the boat, I am such a immigrant
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament
Wait, just for the record get wetter than fisherman
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelin's
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol
That's why I keep my wrist lookin' like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mami you bad, but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up; go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad

You think I'm lying
I feel like I'm flying
I feel like I'm finally free

I'm free
Im free
Im free

[Chorus:]
I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar
I feel free
Shorty lookin' at me 'cause she know I'm a star
I feel free
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right
I feel free
Most of all 'cause I got life
I feel free
