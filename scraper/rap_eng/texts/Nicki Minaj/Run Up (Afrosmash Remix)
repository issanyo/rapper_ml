[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Major keys, I'm the boss
Don't Griselda go off?
Left from the loft and went to Bergdorf
Most of these dudes is really quite soft
45 special, this is my cloth
'Bout to drop a album, this is my fourth
I don't put sugar in my spaghetti sauce
Drop a freestyle and get these hoes perched
Fire burn the obea man church
Pretty girls, when my girls get right
'Cause it's another day, let ya light shine bright
Ain't none of them in your lane
True mi have di game pon lock, dem wah code
Just link wit some hot gyal out ah road
True mi have di waist small, pretty, bus whine
Rolex nah deh pon uno dutty gyal time?
Yo, I told 'em pull up on me faster than Danica
That's on the low I'm tryna blow him like harmonicas
He call me queen, he know "Nicki" is the moniker
He want a mix between Hillary and Monica
I switch it up, I switch it up
Rip the beat, then I, I stitch it up
Travel, then I bounce, I ball-Sinead, Sir
Barbie a link up Major Lazer

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'ma run up on you, I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you, I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you, I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you, I'ma run up on you
