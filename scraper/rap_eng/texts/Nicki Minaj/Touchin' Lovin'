[Intro: Nicki Minaj (Trey Songz)]
Ooh, yeah, hey
Young Money, Trigga Trey
(Oh, oh)
Uh, let's get it, brrrrrrr

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
No, I ain't tryna flex
No ceilings, you can see who's in it, oh
If we're talking about sex (Girl, you gon' think)
Girl, you know that I invented that
And I'm onto the next (next)
That's unless you bring a friend who with it
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, you mad that I came to the party?

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Like, no, no, no
You took your girl to the club and now she gone
Now she asking me when I'm taking her home
I tell her, "Let's go" (leggo)
Long as you know 'cause I know when we get alone

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I'm touchin' you tonight (nah)
I'm lovin' you tonight
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you, girl
You must be used to spendin', putting in that time
Touchin', lovin', fuckin', can't make up my mind
I'm lovin' you
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you tonight

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Girl you fuckin with the best
Take a picture while I'm deep up in it, oh
And if they living right next
Then I bet they know my name in a minute (Trigga)
Let me feel your body sweat
I promise I'll keep your body dripping
Oh, I'm sorry, niggas mad 'cause I came to the party

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Like, no, no, no
You took your girl to the club and now she gone
Now she asking me when I'm taking her home, home, home
I tell her, "Let's go," leggo
Long as you know 'cause I know when we get alone

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I'm touchin' you tonight, I'm lovin' you tonight
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you, girl
You must be used to spendin', putting in that time
Touchin', lovin', fuckin', can't make up my mind
I'm lovin' you (Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you tonight

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, sometimes I tell ‘em I love ‘em because I just wanna fuck ‘em
I never love ‘em or cuff ‘em, and when we done I'ma duck ‘em
He Ferragamo the buckle, he Louis V on the duffel
The pussy wetter than puddles, I ride his dick like a shuttle
I said, real niggas let real bitches cum first
And real bitches been bad bitches from birth
Uh, kiss him when he cumming
Make more money last year than Mister Drummond
(Kyuhh) Oh, he like it when I ride it slow

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I'm touchin' you tonight, I'm lovin' you tonight
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you, girl
You must be used to spendin', putting in that time
Touchin', lovin', fuckin', can't make up my mind
(Nicki, you know that I love ya) I'm lovin' you
(And I really wanna touch ya) (Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you tonight

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
What you mean, "Wait, no?" Like what?
You better act like you know, nigga, it's Nicki Minaj
(Ah-uh)
