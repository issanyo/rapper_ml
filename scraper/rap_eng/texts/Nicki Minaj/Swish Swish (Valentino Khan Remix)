[Refrain]
They, they they
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Nicki Minaj)]
Swish, swish, bish
(Swish swish, aww I got them upset)

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Young Money
Yo!
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos, no, not Offset
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my Biggz, yeah that's the guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus: Katy Perry (Nicki Minaj)]
Swish, swish, bish
Swish, swish, bish
(Swish swish, aww I got them upset)
Let's go
Swish, swish, bish

[Drop]
They, they, they, they
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
They know what is what
What, what, what, what, what, what
What, what is what
What, what, what, what, they know
What is what, what, what, what, what, what
What, what is what
What, what, what, they know what is what
What, what, what, What, what, what
What is what
What, what, what, what
What, they know, what is what
What, what, what, what, what, what
What, what is what, what, what
What (Swish, swish, bish)
