[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down enough to flex with all the shooters
Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I came in, I just pulled it off the lot
Sailing like a pirate how I came in with the yacht
I came up off of trapping off the spot
Tell me if you fuckin' cause it's backups if you're not
I'm just, flexin', to hard, woah
Threesome, sexy two broads, ooh
Every, time I, step out, shit lit
I just, walked in, Heisman, your bitch (straight up)
Boydem tryna catch me with the shooters
Just know I'm down to catch one if you shoot us
And no more puttin' shooters in the Uber
'Cause they can't hop back in it when they

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the girls
They say we bad, I say we some murderers
New bae alert, we ain't fuckin' with the clowns
Didn't I just tell 'em to go turn they goofy down?
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the girls
They say we bad, I say we some murderers
Shawty say he got enough to pay for all my bitches
Shawty, is you down to give the head to all my bitches?
I came in, I just pulled it off the lot
I ain't talkin' ball, every baller wanna shot
I get 'em rocked like a Pyrex in a pot
Tell me if you coppin' 'cause there's backups if you not

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down enough to flex with all the shooters
Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I came in, I just pulled up with the slab
She don't know her father but lil' mama call me dad
Go designer shopping, cop it, fucking up the tab
Rich as fuck, my chick thick as fuck, I had to brag
All these, diamonds, on me (woo)
Don't it, get you, horny? (woo)
It's late, but I, can't leave, it's lit
Rollin', top down, my shit, legit (straight up)
Police tryna catch me with the shooters
You not from the ends, you cannot fool us
I caught a felony and beat that shit the next week
I stack it tall, Lisa Leslie cause

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down enough to flex with all the shooters
Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
I'm just flexin' too hard (ooh)
He think he gettin' that Minaj (ooh)
Every time we come out, shit lit
I might just go an' upgrade his bitch
I'ma need a driver and a shooter
I'ma need the G5 to Bermuda
If that nigga put you in a Uber
He might as well put you on a scooter (ooh)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Brr
