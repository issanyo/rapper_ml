[Verse 1]
Yo, I am such a dancehall queen
I think somebody painted these pants on me
But when I drove past you was standin' on the bus line
Now all my bitches in the club bust, bust wine
Badder then all of them wack bitches combined
I got a lot of bad bitches inna mi bloodline

[Interlude]
Mayday, mayday, mayday, I'm back

[Verse 2]
I rep Southside Jamaica, Queens to the fullest
Money makin' Manhattan, where's Anna? Where's Willis?
Shoutout to the Bronx, Staten Island, bitches dope, uh
Brooklyn, we go hard, Brooklyn, we go hard

[Hook]
Fuck 'em, tell 'em fuck 'em, I fuck 'em, I never suck 'em
The deuces is what I chuck 'em, I duck 'em, I d-d-duck 'em
Fuck 'em, tell 'em fuck 'em, I fuck 'em, I never suck 'em
The deuces is what I chuck 'em, I duck 'em, d-d-d-duck 'em

[Interlude 2]
Bring the heat back; daddy, bring the beat back

[Verse 3]
Yo! No, I'm not a freak no more
Okay, I'm lyin', daddy, I'm a freak on tour
And I keep it wet, yeah, it stay on pour
When I kick it on the jet they say the freak on board
Oh, that's fly, flyington

[Interlude]
Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday, I'm back!
