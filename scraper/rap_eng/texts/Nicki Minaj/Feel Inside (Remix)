[Intro: Mary J. Blige, Nicki Minaj]
I wanna make you happy
It's a hundred on the dash, gave a hundred percent
You can do the math, 20/20 vision
But you just don't see it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Laced-up Giuseppe boots, I'm all good
Keys in that thing, interior all wood
Mountains and hills is in the rearview
But peace of mind is what I don't got
You make a girl hit up the dope spot
White line, is a thin line
Prenup been signed
So quit playing, bench time

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I wanna make you happy, but you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe, but I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things til we make each other cry
What are we doing? Will it ever get better?

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I gave you eveything that I've got
Watch my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
Feel inside

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Guess who used to say "yes, boo"
Now when you say 'baby' it's fake, test tube
Jet white, we don't do JetBlue
Skinny tire on that thing, winter fresh blue
Superstar, you know I'm in the press room
That's why I'm shitting on these bitches, restroom
Ha-ha-ha-ha, that's caca, caca
Get the fuck up out my face with all that rah-rah-rah-rah
You been wack
Might send some Brooklyn niggas, get you kidnapped
With your bitch ass
Hit the dryer 'cause you washed, splish splash

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in
Won't you make up your mind? Boy, decide (decide, decide)
We can't go on like this, this ain't right
I'm feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I gave you eveything that I've got
Watch my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
Feel inside

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Uh-huh
This is a Mary J. Blige, Nicki Minaj knockout collabo
