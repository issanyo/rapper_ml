[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ok, ok, ok... C'mon, listen...

[Verse 1]
Ye' ain't say nothing lil' mama I got those
And I'm about to bl-blow like snot nose
Oh no, no homo
This is for my niggas, my niggas that don't know
Please tell these rap bitches to get ready
Don't get gassed unless you're getting getty
Don't get jerk j-jerk don't get nutty
Fix up your paper work you're somebody
But you ain't better than the President
I'm just too eloquent, bitch, I'm the President!
I be sitting on a elephant
Counting all my money where Stella went
And I don't need my groove back
Unless the nigga looking like 2Pac
Unless he got colors like Toucan Sam
Sam, I am!
Different color Lambs (Green Eggs and Ham)
Bet I could bake a gram like the baker's man
Stop running up on me like who? what? when?
I stay around the white like the Ku Klux Klan
I stay around the sand butter pecan tan, butter pecan tan
I stay around the sand butter pecan tan nigga

[Bridge]
Damn, I'm a bad bitch I'mma give y'all a couple more bars it's nothin.. Listen....

[Verse 2]
I was shotgun when the Bentley cruised up
I'm a bad bitch let me put my shoes up
I don't say hi, I just throw my 2's up
When I'm in Texas I chuck my deuce up
Bitches is snakes, sorta like Medusa
I get on the beats like a new producer
(i hate nicki minaj) just excuse her
I'm in a GT, she in a PT Cruiser, I mean the PT bruiser
Dang lil mama you is such a loser
You is such a loser, dang lil mama you is such a loser...

[Outro]
I mean... If I'm not the baddest bitch who the fuck is?
I mean when I do it's done. Get who you want..
Like, I'mma body every last bitch in the game
I'mma sit on my throne and you know these bitches you know be pickin my fruit out
I want some fresh strawberries and shit tell them bitches to be ready to pick my fruit out
I'm a be sittin on the throne like Michael Jackson and Eddie Murphy, it's nothin [laughs....]
