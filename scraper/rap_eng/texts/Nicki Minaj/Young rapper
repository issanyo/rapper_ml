Young rapper
Lil pio ft. Nicki Minaj

(lil pio)
Yea
Beginning time baby. Here we go Nicki
All my life I have been dreaming about this
My creations
My big destinations
My music will go across
The whole wide nation
The beat just got me pumpin
Yea
Young rapper is gonna make it through
Niggas look at me like I am crazy
They think all wrong
I have been waiting for son long
Young rapper wants to get with you
Niggas all talk but they are lazy
I will prove them wrong
Moments like this should be cherished
Forever so long
(verse 1-Nicki Minaj)
Niggas thinking when I first walked on stage
They thought I was gonna be terrible
Other niggas are more terrible
I showed them
Yea uh-uh now im the fuckin best
L-l-lil pio
This little nigga got it started
L-l-lil cute boy will be have the crowd
Chanting his mother fucking name
Future young money about to be on the road of glory
W-w-work the music baby
Excuse me you see
I like the young rapper
Y-y-young rapper
Yea just drive all the girls crazy
Go,go,go,go
Young rapper bitches
(end of verse 1)(lil pio)
I will look into the camera
With my very pretty smile
Hey nicki I will see you at the top
She knows I am not here to stop
My future is amazing
Livin it to the fullest
All those niggas are foolish
Im on the right mind set
I loose myself in my own music
Hey nicki hit it one more time
(Nicki Minaj-verse2)

I am a young rapper with a big dream
I made my girl scream
Once I make it
My momma will live in a big home
Haha yea

She knows I am not here to stop
I am so young
