[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Once upon a time
Not long ago, there was a chick named Nicki with the naughty flow
On the DVDs & Audios, just like the MC'ds and Oreos
I eats rappers, got gun clappers
I'm in the hood, Lil Mama like gum wrappers
I'm the one they call the best at it
Fuck the rest, I'll let the best have it
So what it is, Lil Daddy-ady?
Let's get a couple drinks at the Mary-ady?
Or you can come to my resident, your now listening to the Dirty Money president
