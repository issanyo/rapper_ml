[Verse 1: Young Lyric]
Ok the Queen got me back up in the lab
Ice drippin like the paint on the slab
Disrespectful ass bitches think they bad
If we catch her outside issa wrap
Keep on talkin u gone get yo ass slapped
I got mob ties get yo ass clapped
Nobody fw that trash, cuz she whack
I’m just here for the cash and the platinum plaques
Do it like this and they copy like that, Move like a boss and that’s only for racks
Im comin up in the game and they mad at my team cuz we on and countin these stacks
Came from the bottom and started wit nothin and now I be killin and wreckin these tracks
I cannot fw nobody like u, cuz if it don’t work out then I know u gone rat

[Hook: Young Lyric]
Ayo, I been best, bitch u been pressed
Cash and spend checks, stash and invest
I mean I been next, that train been left
They callin me Kaleesee, That mean Princess
I-I-I been best, bitch u been pressed
Cash and spend checks, stash and invest
Ayo I been fresh, bread like Kim West
They be like F Lyric, son that incest

[Interlude 1: Nicki Minaj]
Oh, I get it, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well when's the last time you see a bad guy do the rap game like me?

[Verse 2: Young Lyric]
I hit the block justa talk shit
Did it on my own and I got rich
Representin and winnin just like the Rockets bitch
On that H-Town Rap a lot mob shit
How many of em really out here getting cash
Now errbody like, “she really did get dragged”
Let the watch talk, I ain't gotta brag
Chain fulla rocks Ice water splash
Bitch its YL, yes its YL
Been out here puttin in work for the team and takin no L’s
Bro just made bail, Sis I can't fail
Lyric ain't gone make it, shit I can't tell
Bitch its YL, yes miss YL
Come 4 me better bring ur people u gone need help
U see all this water splashin bout to set sail
If she diss me, kiss her farewell

[Interlude 2: Nicki Minaj]
They need rappers like me, they need rappers like me
So they can get on their fucking keyboards and make me the bad guy, Chun-Li

[Hook: Young Lyric]
Ayo, I been best, bitch u been pressed
Cash and spend checks, stash and invest
I mean I been next, that train been left
They callin me Kaleesee, That mean Princess
I-I-I been best, bitch u been pressed
Cash and spend checks, stash and invest
Ayo I been fresh, bread like Kim West
This that YL, Chun Li Remix

[Outro: Young Lyric]
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle

Gimme the password to the fuckin' wifi
