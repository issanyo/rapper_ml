[Intro: Hood$tars & Lou$tar]
Hoo, haa, aah-haha
Have some fun with a little one on one (Parkslope)
Have some fun with a little one on one (Parkslope)
Have some fun with a little one on one (Lou$tar)
Have some fun with a little one on one

[Verse 1: Seven Up]
La-dee-da-dee, I likes to party
Grab a bottle for homie and slide with a mami
Gas him up like a plate of pork and beans
Now she can't keep her R&B dance on fleek
My game is mean, I tell her shit (like)
There's no left turns so it's meant to be (right)
Got the best features from my hips to her lips
And I don't rock [?]

[Pre-Chorus 1: Parkslope]
I was chillin' with my people when you stepped into the party
Girl, you looking kinda sexy with that tattoo on your body
I said, "Hey Ma, where you going?", thought you came to party, don't say no
Don't trip because I'm tipsy, just wanna have a little fun

[Chorus: Parkslope]
La-Dee-Da-Dee, we like to party
We don't cause trouble and we don't bother nobody
Just get on the floor, shake some, shawty
Back it up, don't hurt nobody
La-Dee-Da-Dee, we like to party
We don't cause trouble and we don't bother nobody
Just get on the floor, shake some, shawty
Back it up, don't hurt nobody

[Pre-Chorus 2: Parkslope]
Twisted, getting friendly, I can tell you might be with it
If we slide up to the taille I think you might let me hit it
[?] number one, two, three, you and me, the girl next door
One, two, four, do that thing, we 'bout to have a private party on me

[Chorus: Parkslope]
La-Dee-Da-Dee, we like to party
We don't cause trouble and we don't bother nobody
Just get on the floor, shake some, shawty
Back it up, don't hurt nobody
La-Dee-Da-Dee, we like to party
We don't cause trouble and we don't bother nobody
Just get on the floor, shake some, shawty
Back it up, don't hurt nobody

[Bridge: Parkslope]
Tell the fellas leave your guns at home (leave your guns at home)
'Cause I'm just tryna get my party on (we just tryna get a party on)
Tell them shooters not to come alone (don't come alone)
Me and the fellas wanna get it on (no)

[Verse 2: Lou$tar, Safaree, Nicki Minaj & 7evenUp]
Have some fun with a little one on one, have some fun with a little one on one
Okay, okay, that's right, chyea, chyea, that's right, Hood$tars!
La-dee, La-dee, motherfuckin' da-dee
Pop the paparazzi, slide in the Maserati
Cocky, snotty, (go) with the shoty
Ill little mami, trained bitch like Barbie
[?] mafia, [?] please pass me the [?]
S-C-to the-A-double F-to the-B
Double O to the G, I to the
Easay, believe me, bitches can't see me
Do it like I'm doing it for TB
For sheezay, it's 7even U-EZ
Go on my G4, chickenhead staring me up and down like a seesaw
I got sugar in the bikini serving me tequilas
I got the heater on cock in the chinchilla
On the real-a, this shit here is dope
It's the ill collaboration, Hood$tars, Parkslope (La-Dee-Da-Dee)

[Chorus: Parkslope]
La-Dee-Da-Dee, we like to party
We don't cause trouble and we don't bother nobody
Just get on the floor, shake some, shawty
Back it up, don't hurt nobody
La-Dee-Da-Dee, we like to party
We don't cause trouble and we don't bother nobody
Just get on the floor, shake some, shawty
Back it up, don't hurt nobody
