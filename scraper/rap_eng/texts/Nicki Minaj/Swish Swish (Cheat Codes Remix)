[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Swish, swish, bish

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Swish, swish, bish

[Outro]
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
Another one in the casket
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
Another one in the casket
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
