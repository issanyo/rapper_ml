[Nicki Minaj]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1]
This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act high siddity
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in, whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don’t come to the hood?
How they turn they nose up like they don’t come from the hood?
Most of them be in sight til it’s time to pitch in
That's why everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love, I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz, I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich, I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid that can’t do no more

[Nicki Minaj - Hook]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2]
This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses
When I’m granting they wishes they be passing they digits
They be up on the block getting screwed by the cops
Cutting school, gettin knocked whether they like it or not
They’ll break in your door
Might break in your jaw
They’ll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain’t know
They airborne for stardom
With the ball in the Garden, stand tall, no dodgin’
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant
Air Force, the Army, Air Force and Army
Fatigues is on him, no heats is on him
Cause grandmama prayed, that he’d leave the corner

[Nicki Minaj - Hook]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams, got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 3]
I remember when I lost everything in a fire
Now I got fire 23′s on my tire
Shout outs to my brothers, Jelani and Macaiah
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher
One time for my niggas, that be huggin’ the block
Two Times for my niggas, that be ducking the cops
Three Times for my girls that pushing they own rides
Stushing they own ride, bitches they don't lie
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun
Look, I see you without a man ma, you raised ya son
Well look, when you blow up everybody go shudder
This goes out to everybody on the come up

[Nicki Minaj - Hook]

We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world
