[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Story of the French Revolution
Ending the Old Regime
A whole new country
Making a new constitution

(Intro)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Lets start with the three estates
First class, church
Second class, rich nobles
Third class, everyone else
"It's not fair!" cried third class
"We don't want to pay taxes
We want a better social status"
Lets change us, let's change the system

[Hook]
It's the Old Regime everyone
It's the only way they know
Only way to get things done
But maybe things have to come to an end
People are tired, and they don't wanna play pretend
Lets start a Revolution
Revolution, Revolution
It's the French Revolution

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
The only way to end this era is to kill King Louis
He's got to go
The whole country in debt
No more living like this
They chopped his head
Happy he was dead
It's over, new beginning

[Hook]
It's the Old Regime everyone
It's the only way they know
Only way to get things done
But maybe things have to come to an end
People are tired, and they don't wanna play pretend
Lets start a Revolution
Revolution, Revolution
It's the French Revolution
