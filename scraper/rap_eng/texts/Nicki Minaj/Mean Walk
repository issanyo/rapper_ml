Yup I got a mean walk, I don't think they ready

[Verse One] [Miss Daja]:

And had a baby now they created a monster

And I ain't stopping till I get get get it popping yup
So nice to meet ya baby baby
Don't be intimidated I'm a lady lady

I'm about to show you how to work that runway

[Hook] [Miss Daja]:
That walk, that girl she got the mean walk
Yup I got a mean walk
That walk, that girl she got the mean walk
Yup I got a mean walk
She must be a model, she's shaped just like a coke bottle
Look at her sw-i-itch, she's oh so thick, she making me sick
Cause I know she got the meanest walk

[Verse Two]
Pose for the pic, I love to be glamorous
Ya little sis, she wanna be just like this
Ain't gotta give up no ass to get them bills paid
We go to school and get a higher education
My girl Nicki said, "Step them cookies up
And you too can be a part of Barbie Nation
We independent so come and join us."
We about to set this runway on fire

(Nicki Minaj)
Yo, you can never walk like me
Ask ya man, I'm his New York wifey
Sitting up in the lambo, stepped out the lambo
Excuse me, I'm so Naomi Campbell
Number one hot stepper, I'm stuntin' some cracked leopards
They checking my track records, I'm hotter then black peppers
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah Ahh, don't touch me honey
Get a little paranoid, when I count my money
Tell em to get security, I'mma need about thirty
Armed guards, preferably large dudes
With muscles, ready to take a charge
Ahh, got them all screaming free Remy Ma
Now when I do it, it get done, I holla at the thicker one
Said when I do it, it get done, I holla at the thicker one
You know I only come out on occasion
It's Young Nicki, and the Miss Daja

[Hook] [Miss Daja]:
That walk, that girl she got the mean walk
Yup I got a mean walk
That walk, that girl she got the mean walk
Yup I got a mean walk
