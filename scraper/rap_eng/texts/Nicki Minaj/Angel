[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Take a look around
I don't feel the ground beneath my feet
Gravity won't hold me down
As long as you are here with me

[Refrain: Jeremih]
Way in the air, up there
Is a place where we can go to
Higher than any mountain
A place where we'll find refuge

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
So baby let's go
Baby you're the reason I'm here now
Baby let's fly
Baby you're the reason I'm here now

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Cause you are my angel
You are my angel
Cause you are my angel, my angel
You are my angel

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I knew you were the one
Now it's much too late to turn back
See the night has just begun
Let's take this time and make it last

[Refrain: Jeremih]
Way in the air, up there
Is a place where we can go to
Higher than any mountain
A place where we'll find refuge

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
So baby let's go
Baby you're the reason I'm here now
Baby let's fly
Baby you're the reason I'm here now

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Cause you are my angel
You are my angel
Cause you are my angel, my angel
You are my angel

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, Jere' this is my era, don't make that error, give these girls terror
Hera in the mirror, mirror on the wall, wall
Who's the greatest, greatest of them all, all?
Been prayin', prayin', for the fall, fall
Don't worry, I still stand tall, tall
Anyway, bring a bucket of the ice, the Myx
I'm twice as rich, I ice my wrist
Brrrrrrrrrr, you make me fly high
I done jumped in the truck, we've been down from the jump
They can hate, let 'em hate while we fly by

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
So baby let's go
Baby you're the reason I'm here now
Baby let's fly
Baby you're the reason I'm here now

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Cause you are my angel
You are my angel
Cause you are my angel, my angel
You are my angel

[Outro: Jeremih]
Cause you are my angel
