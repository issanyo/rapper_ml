[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo..

[Verse 1: Samie Bower]
Look like I'm goin for a swim
Dunking on 'em, now im swinging off the rim
Y’all hanging by a limb
Blood stain on my timbs
I been kicking ya face in before Ryu & Ken
Check the catalog
Shoulda been had a name
Flights, no coach, haven't been the same
Is it for the fame? Or to show the pain? Who the one to blame?
Put me in the frame with the devil lighting up a flame, oh woah

Niggas playing games in my console
Chinese blue imported, Manchuria
Leg work quicker then George getting curious
Tekken X Street Fighter got me type serious

[Hook]
Zoned in my own league
Y’all can say what you want, but its all me
I ain't worried bout you niggas tryna clone me
I ain't worried til I see that you Chun Li
That you Chun Li

[Verse 2: Samie Bower x Nicki Minaj]
[Samie Bower]
Sacrificing what’s on the line
You take the time to see me eye to eye
You say that you know me all over the gram
Who's to say I feel the same way when it comes to you

I ain't worried bout you niggas tryna clone me
I ain't worried til I see that you Chun Li
That you Chun Li

[Nicki Minaj]
I went and copped the chopsticks
Put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit
Box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip

[Samie Bower]
Fuck the nonsense
Fuck ya tolerance on the concept
How did i allow this?
What was your entitlement?
Don't get violent
No David, Goliath
Me be eros, sending arrows, upon a lion
Where the love at? Where the love at?
Ima need more head on the tour bed
She got a twin, let her in til she forfeit
A little ménage à trois

[Hook]
Zoned in my own league
Y’all can say what you want, but its all me
I ain't worried bout you niggas tryna clone me
I ain't worried til I see that you Chun Li
That you Chun Li

Zoned in my own league
Y’all can say what you say, but its all me
I ain't worried bout you niggas tryna clone me
I ain't worried til I see that you Chun Li
That you Chun Li

[OUTRO]

[Nicki Minaj]
Make me the bad guy, Chun-Li

[Samie Bower]
Yeah yeah, that you Chun-Li
That you Chun-Li
Yeah that you Chun-Li
Chun-Li, yeah you Chun-Li
Yeah yeah that you Chun-Li
Yeah yeah that you Chun-Li
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Nicki Minaj]
Say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off
