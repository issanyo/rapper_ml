[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You wanna please me then get down for ya crown
You know they call me Downtown Julie Brown
I get a lot, get alot head
I get a lot of fades
And I get a lot dreads
See I be in the town closin' million dollars deals up
Real nice view with my million dollar heels up
Tell the DJ Nicki Minaj said to reel up rewind
Ya'll never met a muthafuckin' boss this fine
I get my own thing, my own bloodclot thing
That's why they call me misses badda bing, badda bing
I'm lookin' for a king with some good ding a ling
Big truck, beenie man, throw some sim, sima in
I fucks with boss bitches
Type to be caught divorcin' bitch niggas
Corsets and horses
A lot of pink Porshes
Custom made plates, I stay lookin' for some bosses

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Ooh, there's something about
Just something about the way she move
And I can't figure it out
There's something about her
Said, ooh, there's something about
The kind of woman that want you but don't need you
And I can't figure it out
There's something about her

[Pre-Hook]
Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss
Do what a boss
Do, she got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need

[Hook]
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time?
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh, the way we shine
Miss Independent

[Verse 2]
Ooh there's something about
The kind of woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's something about her
There's something oh so sexy about
The kind of woman that don't even need my help
She said she got it, she got it, no doubt
There's something about her

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ne-Yo & Nicki Minaj)]
Her favorite thing to say: "Don't worry, I got it"
And everything she got: best believe she bought it
She gonna steal my heart, ain't no doubt about it
Girl, you're everything I need (everything)
Said you're everything I need

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
When you approach me say boss
Because I paid the muthafuckin' costs
I'm in a Porshe listenin' to Rick Ross
Because I am the muthafuckin' boss

[Ne-Yo]
