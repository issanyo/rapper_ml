[Verse 1:]
She's so pretty, she know they want her, but -
She's so sididdy, they can't afford her,  but -
All the boys stare, when she comes around my way
Straight out the driveway, head to the highway
Red light, green light, got the best moves
Headlights, beam bright, got the best boobs
I call her double R (Range Rover), my rough rider
We hit a couple malls, then the Ramada
Cause on the road of life, she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter, than a coke bottle
She super charge cars, anything for Minaj
And she could only park, in the superstar garage
Cause she-she-she-she bad, if anybody ask
Her bags is boss, cause her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer, tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch, named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her, she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton

I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I-love my Range Rover
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I-love my Range Rover

[Post Hook:]
Pumps on the gas, 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash, on the d-d-d-d-ash
Pumps on the gas, 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash, on the d-d-d-d-ash

[Verse 2:]
She's so dope, you know she even help me -
Transport the dope, that mama stay around that -
White, like the pope, they get the canine, but they -
Can't smell the coke, now you tell me why is it
Now you tell me why is it, don't need the Riker's visit
That is because, I'm about the color, of the Geico lizard
She L-Lewinsky, hold ya bosses-es
Come around town, three hundred horses-es
Power she devour, got them gettin' divorces-es
(Sirens blaring)....I don't stop for officers
And now we hit hydraulics, that's for the left turn
Need I repeat, she got more horses, than a Western
You know she beat weight, so she don't eat late
A vegetarian, she sipping on that V-eight
They try to gas her, they try to put it in her
You can't pass her, she faster than a TV dinner
Her lip gloss poppin', we call it Armor All
We chuck the deuces up, d-d-don't know all of y'all
