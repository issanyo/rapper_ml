[Intro: 21 Savage & Nicki Minaj]
Woah, Woah

I heard they called for the queen
Niggas tryna clone and tryna make another me
Woah, Woah

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Niggas tryna clone and tryna make another me
My baby momma bitching, but she still be fucking me
You blowing up her phone and she be steady sucking me

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Young nigga pull up gon' spaz

Offset
We can not throw in the towel
Niggas'll gun you down
You better moo like a cow
Niggas'll shoot up the crowd (moo)
Dressed in all black like a trial
These niggas will run in your house
Fucking a thot in her mouth
I Dolcegabbana my couch
Big ballin' shit, rap game what we talkin' 'bout
Bitch sucking dick for the fame, get the fuck out
Got me a Perc'
Sip me some syrup
I'm tripping the fuck out
Send me the skkrt
Send in a merc and he get knocked out
Shawty so bad
Shawty so sad, she sleep on the sofa
I didn't even ask
I just wanna smash so bitch bending over
I pray I don't crash
I'm sippin' on Act' so bitch I can't focus
I cut 'em off fast
I go get the bad then go by the ocean
Hit your hoe from the blindside
I got it on me, I'm fine you dine
Eat the bitch, she wine and dine
I fuck her she whine and crying
But when it get live, you niggas ain't down to ride
Your niggas 'bout it? Doubt it
My niggas turn to Michael Myers

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Young nigga pull up gon' spaz
Young nigga got that bag
Young nigga run the jazz

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Lil’ bitch I heard these labels tryna make another me
Everything you getting little hoe is 'cause of me
I heard I’m stopping bags, word to Shaggy it wasn’t me
These bitches is my sons, but they daddy ain’t bust in me
I’m a white picket fence bitch, you a on the bench bitch
See me in the gym now these bitches wanna go bench press
I ain’t fucking with you sis, we ain’t with the incest
Yes, I am the Queen, I’m still trying to find the princess
They know my name ring bells so they still press
Say the Queen name you can get some ill press
That went right over your head, you should feel blessed
Must’ve used a lot of starch cause they still pressed
Bitches is finito, I call my car Rico
Cause it’s Paid In Full, baby my car don’t get repo’d
London got that heat though, my jet land at Heathrow
If I had a dick, I would make all you bitches deep throat

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Young nigga pull up gon' spaz
Young nigga got that bag
Young nigga run the jazz
Nigga we ain't goin' out sad
Y'all niggas goin' out bad
Y'all nigga hang around fags
Y'all niggas make a nigga laugh
Y'all niggas make a nigga laugh
Nigga we ain't throwing no flags
Nigga we ain't throwing no flags
Nigga we ain't throwing no flags
Nigga we ain't throwing no flags
Nigga we ain't throwing no flags
Nigga we ain't throwing no flags
Nigga we ain't throwing no flags
Nigga we ain't throwing no flags
