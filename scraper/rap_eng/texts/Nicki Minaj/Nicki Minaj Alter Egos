Nicki Minaj was born Onika Tanya Maraj on December 8, 1982. Ever since she was little, Nicki has continuously made up alter egos that serve a variety of purposes.
In the beginning, Nicki's alter egos offered her an escape from reality but they eventually evolved into a means of representing herself in the music industry, helping her get her point across and add more variety to her music.
