[Verse]
Ayo! Where my B-F-F?
Where my playboy bunny?
Where dat nigga Hugh Hef'?
When we pull off at that light why everything else get left?
Why they screwin' up they face?
Why they lookin' a hot mess?
Why they be like no they didn't?
Them bitches is always shittin'
My clock be tick, tick, tick, tickin'
Them chickens is finger lickin'
And that's why, we do 'em greasy
Stuntin' in Louis V-zy
We straight without a perm, and you bitches is stupid peasy
Would you like some rice with that?
We get a lot of cheese no mice with that
I mean I want some ice wit that
No soda, where ya owner?
Give ya license back, ho!

That's my girlfriend, g-g-g-g-girlfriend
Don't forget the brush, blow dryer, and the curlin' iron
That's my girlfriend, tell them hoes stopping-ton
They know they want everything that we be copping-ton
Wherever I slide through, I gotta go buy two
If I get it in the pink, I get her the light blue
Brand new Range Rover, that was for her b-day
I just auctioned off some shit, you can get it on eBay
Anyway, we VIP, we don't even need I.D
Put 'em in the I.C.U. If they don't bring the I-C-E
Get them bottles of Rosé and one long island icy tea
Put my bracelet in the mirror, I see me icing me
Get it?

[Bridge]
Excuse me, there's way too many groupies
Why don't you just sit back or dance?
Sorry, we don't chit-chat wit fans
You came in a Diablo
Or was it a Gallardo?
We got the top down, doors up, Murciélago
LP-460, bitches, that's the model
