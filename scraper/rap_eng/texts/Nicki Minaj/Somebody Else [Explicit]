Nicki Minaj
How would you have learned if I ain't leave?
I guess I was way too naive
I should've been checked you
But I let you get mad disrespectful

You couldn’t be serious, was you?
Looking at my new man, wish it was you
But you're dead now
Sign of the cross on your chest and your head now

Guilty is what you plead now
Left Queens for Brooklyn, I’m on a belt now
Stupid is what you felt now
When you see me on TV, have a meltdown

Bombs away
Tryna sneak tip hit me when slimes away
Roly on but I ain't got time a day
Time will tell, Chanel get that Lagerfeld

Mario
Now I’m all alone
Since you wanna be gone yeah
I don’t really like it
But I gotta take it
Damn damn damn girl

When you’re coming back?
So you’re never coming back, yeah
I-I-I-I don’t believe that
But right now I gotta accept the fact yeah

You left me for somebody else now
I wish never loved ya
You left me, baby you left me
Girl, I guess I’ll take it off your love

You left me for somebody else now
Girl I wish I never met you
You left me, baby you left me
‘Cause I wouldn’t be alone
