[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Shorty wanna li li li li lick me like a lollipop
Shorty said he li li like the way I make punany pop
Shorty wanna li li lick me in the candy apple drop
I got that presidential cooch, when he see it he salute
Cause ain't no nappy pubes, just alot of juice
A little mohawk, posing for the Photog
He get me so, he get me so, he get me so smart
He make my pussy sing "Ahhhhh!", like it's Mozart
He say the pussy pretty, it look like show art
He say who pussy is it, and I say yours
And when he spank this, I make that pussy fart
I'm such an actress, Melissa Joan Hart
