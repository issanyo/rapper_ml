I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar
I feel free
Shawty lookin' at me cause she know I'm a star
I feel free
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right
I feel free
Most of all cause I got life
I feel free

[Verse: Ricky Blaze]
Send 3 more bottles to table 5
We buyin' out the bar, we livin' our life
We gettin' all right, shawties watchin' us
We lockin' down the club cause we straight dangerous
Me and my dudes, me and my crew
We lockin' this down, ice is so blue
These dudes talkin' they mouth but they ain't true
We shuttin' this bitch down

[Hook: Ricky Blaze]
I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar
I feel free
Shawty lookin' at me cause she know I'm a star
I feel free
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right
I feel free
Most of all cause I got life
I feel free

[Verse: Ron Browz]
I just signed the deal so everything is all good
Made a mood and get my niggas out the hood
Same place where Murda Mace once stood
Ferrari cars, interior all wood
Now I'm in the club, bottles on me
Louis Vuitton fits on me
Heavy chains, nothin' hollow on me
I'm a star now, all the problems on me
Shawty lookin' nice so I'm lovin' her
I don't care what you say, I'm cuffin' her
She's hot, nigga can't get enough of her
Drinkin' champagne, I can't stop touchin' her
Her pretty eyes is killin' me
Her glossy lips is stealin' me
After the club ma, we can chill in the V
Tonight is our night and ma, I feel free

[Hook: Ricky Blaze]
I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar
I feel free
Shawty lookin' at me cause she know I'm a star
I feel free
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right
I feel free
Most of all cause I got life
I feel free

[Verse: Red Cafe]
I feel so free
So loose, drinks on me
I'm too G, Gucci links on me
Game locked down, I'm the nigga with the key
I see your girl, she's so fly
She's got wings, see her float by
Whole crew sick, hottest things out
Street fitted in bring 'em out, bring 'em out
L.V. on the shoulder
She look right in the Rover
In the club, never sober
Ballers, we the niggas on the posters
Rockstar, so Sunny Bono
Cowboy, so Tony Romo
Shake down shawty, that's the logo
Feel free, fuck the po-po

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Hopped off the boat, I am such an immigrant
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament?
Wait, just for the record get wetter than fishermen
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelins
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol
That's why I keep my wrist looking like like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mommy you bad but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up, go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
You think I'm lying
I feel like I'm flying
I feel like I'm finally free
I'm free [x3]

[Hook: Ricky Blaze]
I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar
I feel free
Shawty lookin' at me cause she know I'm a star
I feel free
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right
I feel free
Most of all cause I got life
I feel free
