[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Think you better than me top me then
I'm Nicki Minaj looking for some bobbsey twins
Bitches know that I be flyer than the turbulence
Favorite colors pink and purple and feds circling
Anyway I'm overseas on vacation, girls
Sitting in the VIP with some geisha girls, oh
Excuse me busta, light your dutch up
I'm the mustard, time to ketchup
Fuck around then catch a couple slugs to your Yaki
Get me my collard greens my chicken teriyaki
I get the club j-j-jump, jumping
Can't tell me nothing
Couldn't even tell me something
Icy icy icy hot and matter fact
I know a real nice pricey spot
I'm 'bout to get me everything
Ice mic could cop
Red underneath the shoes no nike shox
