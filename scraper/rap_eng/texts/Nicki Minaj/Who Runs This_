[Intro]
Do my ladies run this mother for ya? Hell ya
Or do my fellas run this mother for ya? Hell ya

[Verse 1]
I see you in the club with your favourite fitted on
No time to get it wrong I can't get it crong
Poppin' them bottles 3 at a time
If he get out of line then he run out of time
Drink in my hand and I'm feeling dizzy
Gindo's the plan I got my girls with me

[Hook]
So do my ladies run this mother for ya?
Get on the floor show 'em what you're working with
Or do my fellas run this mother for ya?
Hold on tight don't let go keep workin' it

[Verse 2]
Now it's about 3 in the morning still up in the spot
Getting kinda hot no bodies getting shot
Causing a problem up in VIP
'Cause every chick I see they mad be feelin me
Got another drink and I'm still tipsy
Better watch your man or he's coming with me

[Hook]
So do my ladies run this mother for ya?
Get on the floor show 'em what you're working with
Or do my fellas run this mother for ya?
Hold on tight don't let go keep workin' it

[Bridge]
Shake what your mama gave you
Shake what your mama gave you

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Hopped out the yellow cab, oops, the yellow Jag
Popped the Louis collar, mustard color bag
Bustas wanna shag, must be cause I'm bad
Stays on duke mount like his du-rag
Where my girls that run it? Spend nothing but hundreds
If dude start stuntin', tell dude we done it
And hop out the car like you do that, dear
Top with no bra like you do not care
Me and Ang gettin' cake, we don't play about it
We be in another state movin' weight around
You got my doobie hang, you got my Chinese bangin'
My dude's outta town like my New York twangin'
Huh, take your spot like "oops! I bumped ya!"
Hoodstarz drop, we gon' do them numbers
I ain't really gotta ask you, I, who run this
My wrist stay cool like I rock cucumbers

[Hook]
So do my ladies run this mother for ya?
Get on the floor show 'em what you're working with
Or do my fellas run this mother for ya?
Hold on tight don't let go keep workin' it

[Hook]
So do my ladies run this mother for ya?
Get on the floor show 'em what you're working with
Or do my fellas run this mother for ya?
Hold on tight don't let go keep workin' it
