[Intro]
As I sit back relax crack jokes for a minute
I think about the up-and-comers that could probably get it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I might go to jail for fuckin with Hell Rell
If he get ill and pull on my ponytails
I heard Maino life is like a movie
Set up the cameras, fuck him in the jacuzzi
Freekey Zeke, that should be easy
He just came home, I know he wanna bone
But what about JR Writer, I'mma skill him
And when I r-r-ride him, I'mma grill him
The nigga Pap, he might, could fuck me
But I ain't tryna be drip-drippin' a Gino Green
Tell Stacks to bring the black card up
But if I fuck him would he would he yell squad up!
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy
Throw some d's on it & im might breathe on it
& when Im Philly I gotta Fuck Gillie
Snacth his big max & slap a bitch silly

[Hook]
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Put it in half way, Red Cafe
Put the pussy on his freckles, haha that tickles
Uncle Murda could bring the handcuffs
Why is that, I gotta watch out gotta get a rough neck
As for Gravy he might could beat
You know them fat niggas love to eat
And when I want a Nicki Minaj who could it be
It's them Young Gunnaz, Chris and Lil' Neef
"Nicki what about Fendi? He made you pop"
Tell him to kick rocks, or give me some top
I'm on my way to Jer', to break Ransom off
Quench his thirst, when my pants come off
Murda Mook & Miles gone have to battle
Scoop whoever win and, tell him to sca-dattle
Run up on Mims, he could give me backshots
This is why, this is why, this why I'm hot

[Hook]
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
