[Spoken Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You gotta warm them before you bring
Bring them to a bad bitch convention Trina
Like you can't do this, you can't just pop up
An-And y-you know, we styling on these niggas
Like c'mon, you know what I mean
Trina, Nicki Minaj, let's go

[Pre-Chorus 1: Gold1]
I can find my way to love you
I can hold my breath tonight (tonight)
We can own this time forever
I can feel it in the candlelights
We can get lost together (oh, oh, oh)
You can find the, the dance floor (oh oh oh)
You can see me looking right across your shoulder
No matter what, it feel right

[Chorus: Gold1]
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
Dashing in and out of the rain (rain)
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
And no one will be the same (the same)
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
Dashing in and out of the rain (rain)
Baby you're like a rainbow
Washing away the pain

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Excuse me, can I see your dang-a-lang, brother?
I mean, you know, juggle your balls like the Ringling Brothers
I'm the Harajuku Barbie, I ain't trippin' on your change
I mean, look, I got the sports package on my Range
I just dip in the pink for the pink effect
D-D-D-Diamonds on my neck for the link effect
And I was wondering if I could lip-sync on that
You know my name ring {ding} ring tinkerbells

[Pre-Chorus 2: Gold1]
I will let go off my feelings
I will crush the world tonight
In your arms, I feel so much better
I wanna live right through your light
We can get lost together (oh, oh, oh)
You can find the, the dance floor (oh oh oh)
You can see me looking right across your shoulder
No matter what, it feel right

[Chorus: Gold1]
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
Dashing in and out of the rain (rain)
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
And no one will be the same (the same)
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
Dashing in and out of the rain (rain)
Baby you're like a rainbow
Washing away the pain

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Watch (Check!)
Chain (Check!)
They be on the rain (Check!)
I be on the move, they be reaching but they canâ€™t catch
I be with the baddest bitch on the island stylin'
Black Miley Cyrus, sayin' hi to pirates
I be singing them ballads when he tossing my salad
When I pet my parrot, all you see is colorful carrots
I be singing them ballads when he tossing my salad
When I pet my parrot, all you see is colorful carrots

[Chorus: Gold1]
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
Dashing in and out of the rain (rain)
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
And no one will be the same (the same)

[Bridge: Trina]
I just want him for his hood, 'cause he do it good
The way he make me scream when he give me that thang
Throw my face in the pillow now, hey
I just want him for his hood, 'cause he do it good
The way he make me scream when he give me that thang
Throw my face in the pillow now, hey

[Chorus: Gold1]
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
Dashing in and out of the rain (rain)
Baby you're like a rainbow (rainbow)
And no one will be the same (the same)
