[Nicki Minaj's verse]

Yo, young money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I’m rich I could buy you
Kill bitches leave their body in a bayou
More brain than a IQ
More head than a dread (my youte)
And my bank account ain’t hardly empty
That’s why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who’s next to go
My flows so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but This is it!
B- b- b- boo I'm everywhere
You're like balloon boy mama you was never there!
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn’t even dare to be
So that's all folks, badibadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, need more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, "It's all yours!"
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem in the ring, the queen and the king
