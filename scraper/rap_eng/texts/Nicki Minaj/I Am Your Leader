[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uh
Look sucker, this my gun butter
Street fighter bitches, this the up cutter
Nunchucka', no time to ducka'
Sign of the cross, 'cause this is her last suppa'
Play with me, check who came with me
I bought a couple 9's, plus the k's with me
I breeze through Queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, assess the damages
'Cause this that oh, this is that oh
And yes, I body bitches go get the bandages
Young yummy, fuck you got for me
I hate a phony bitch that front that chum chummy
I'm me top shotta' drop the top toppa'
Big fat pussy with a icy watch

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
When I fly, it's one letter and one number
You wack hoes could get hot for one summer
After that the queen will still reign here
I'm Santa Claus to these hoes without a reindeer
Saint Nick, Ross, hey, Rick, I just got a toy, cost 850
Now I'm in the hood, niggas is getting woodies
Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies
I'm a brand, bitch, I'm a brand
Go to Harlem, and get Cam
It's dipset, get your dick wet
Boarded the big jet, and got a big check
Now you tell me, who the fuck is winning?
I'm on my Russell Simmons, Nicki denim, Nicki linen

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Jealous niggas is gossip, watch me tie up my laces
Bitches be jocking, tell by the look on they faces
Eight digits I'm clocking, a lot of gold in my bracelet
Seven figures on watches, I told my mama I made it
Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy
I went back to the projects in two mil in Mercedes
I get head from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm old school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heartbreak hotel, I'm in the A-Rod suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seat
Know that boy busy 'cause he balling, I like to play all week
Monday night with the ‘RAW’, I’m Vince McMahon with a beat
Power slamming them hammers, I get you handle for free
So where the fuck is her manners, she gives brain while I tweet
DM, in the BM, you cm, you bucking, you love it
Motherfuckers on my dick, suck it

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
See the car is European, but got imported from Tokyo
Looking like a shark, the nose call it Pinocchio
Well off, wealthy, LV logo
Middle of July, but the wrist on snowflow
Only do the Aspens, y'all can have the Poconos
I'm sunny and you must suck collagen dose, Calogero
Ride the whip, five on the hip, live with the pies got nine for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick
Oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need an aspirin, she said "You're only Cameron"
Girlfriend you don't know Cam'ron from nowhere
So don't go tampering
You're just a nail I hammer, 'nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl, watch your manners
She run and tell her mother, "I think I love him, Nana."
Because you sat upon my lap? Nah, I ain't Santa
They call me pied piper, OJ no glove I knife her
Never been a lifer, even do Rikers
Why would I fight? Don’t even like her

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
