[Intro: Nicki Minaj]

"I like dudes with confidence. I like dudes that make me laugh. And I like dudes that... that... are nice, you know? Don't be a prick. Don't be mean. Just be sweet and- you'd be surprised how much, how far, you can get just being a sweetheart. Like, all the guys that I've met so far, like, the niggas that's on the top? They're all sweet. They let me be cocky to them. They let me put them down and be the dominating bitch, you know what I'm saying? Cuz that's what a man does. A man don't hit females. A man don't yell at females. A real man shuts the fuck up!"

[Verse 1]
Ok a real man gone shut the fuck up
Gone let me do what I do
And get my bucks up
A real man gone know
I can fuck who I want
Don't call me no hoe
And don't be calling me no slut
A real man never raise his hand on a woman
Unless he tryna fix my hair
Or he tryna give me something
You say that you a real man?
Well, I think you bluffing
So close your fucking mouth
Before I fill it with some stuffing

[Pre-Hook]
A real man
Tell me have you seen one
Cuz I kinda want one
But I do not need one
I'm looking for a real man
Do you know how to be one
Don't need no weak one
Need someone I can lean on

[Chorus]
Boy B Quiet
When a queen is speaking you can hear the crown
Boy B Quiet
When I'm talking I don't wanna hear a sound
Boy B Quiet
When a queen is speaking you can hear the crown
Boy B Quiet
So when I'm talking I don't wanna hear a sound

[Verse 2]
That's why I keep it up
A real man will never ever beat you
He just gone beat it up
And know how to treat you
When he see you
Yeah he gone eat it up
These boys rookies
I gotta teach em sum
Never ever ever bite the pussy
That's been feeding ya
These niggas be so dumb
Raise they fists cuz they can't raise tongues
Wasn't raised right by they moms
And they wanna be praised like kings
But they really be bums
Call me Yung Baby Baghdad
Bitch I'm dropping bombs
Real man I never had dat
My daddy was my mom

[Pre-Hook]
A real man
Tell me have you seen one
Cuz I kinda want one
But I do not need one
I'm looking for a real man
Do you know how to be one
Don't need no weak one
Need someone I can lean on

[Chorus]
Boy B Quiet
When a queen is speaking you can hear the crown
Boy B Quiet
When I'm talking I don't wanna hear a sound
Boy B Quiet
When a queen is speaking you can hear the crown
Boy B Quiet
So when I'm talking I don't wanna hear a sound
