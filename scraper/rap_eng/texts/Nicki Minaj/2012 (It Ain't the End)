[Intro: Jay Sean]
2-0-1-2, oh-yeah
It's alright, oh it's alright

[Verse 1: Jay Sean]
You know what they say
Life ain't always easy and every day
We're survivors
So forget the day
It's all about tonight; act a fool and start a riot, a-riot be a rebel

[Pre-Chorus]
Bottles poppin' til we can't stand
We keep it rockin' til six AM
New York to London over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up

[Chorus]
We gonna party like
Party like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world
Gonna live like it's the end of the world
Gonna party like
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Similes, metaphors, and we pop pills
Sick flow, inundated with the doc bills
Work hard, now we know how the top feels
In the middle of the street doing cartwheels
Lot of them try to do it but it's not real
Wasn't a rapper then I could've got a pop deal
White curls in a hot pink Hot Wheels
Lot of bottles and a lot of fruity cocktails
Uh, days of our lives
You wink it goes by
So we'll just get it with no edits
Anything goes, so no time for closed minds
And free my Lil' Weezy
And let's just get right
Young money, cash money in the building
Let's go the world ends tonight

[Verse 3: Jay Sean]
Have a drink with me
And let's make tonight go down
In history, in history yeah
Lets make believe
It's the last 24 hours and this whole world is ours
Eternally, eternally

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, bottles poppin' til we can't stand
We keep it rockin' til six AM
New York to London over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up

[Chorus]
We gonna party like
Party like, like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world
We gotta live like it's the end of the world
We gotta party like
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world

[Bridge]
No, I'm not gonna follow
Anything that they say anymore
It's never too late to start livin'
So let's start it with here and right now

[Chorus]
Party like like its the end of the world
We gonna party like like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world
We gonna live like it's the end of the world
We gotta party like
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world

[Outro]
The world
Because the world keeps spinnin'
The world keeps spinnin' around
