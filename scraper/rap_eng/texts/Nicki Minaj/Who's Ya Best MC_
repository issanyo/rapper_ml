[Verse]
You know they say Nicki spit crazy, get it poppin' -
Like, M eighties (80's), or twin tre eighties (80's)
Young Money First Lady,ya know, baby girl  -
Of the group, I'm also known as baby girl, in the coupe
Never get me confused, as Baby girl in the hoop
Cause, Nicki stay fly, like that Cash Money dude
I'm stuntin' on these hoes, like Marilyn Monroe
I got a S curl flow, I spit slick, ya know?
And I don't just spit raps, and chit chat
Nicki could get it in, Nicki could spit gats
Ya girl got hustle, Nicki could pitch crack
But, Nicki rather chill, and stack a mil'
While these hoes, stay in hoods like rats for real
My voice stay on tha track, like a Mac for real
Riding the baseline like, 'Quille O'Neal
Gassed ya baby father, for the keys to the Escalade
Not a baby momma, but I'm drama like, Kay Slate
What can I say? That's how ya girl do
Ya girl stay fresh down, to tha cuticles
My people smoke dutches, we don't fluck with bamboo
I'm a winner mami, ya career's a gamble
Old ass broad, off track, like bad weaves
Nicki stay on her toes, on point, like ballerines
Lemme remind you, I'm gettin' a tan too
Ya caramel dream, ya girl from Queens
They say I'm too pretty, to be spittin' sixteens
I should be on the screen, posin' for Maybelline
Or be a Baby Phat girl, kitten on my jean
Hood star broad, Black Barbie Doll
Pardon me, if the cockiness, botherin' y'all
I'm just bein' Nicki Minaj, ya know?
Girl from around way, without the L Cool J
Ma' you spit Kool-Aid, I spit acid out
Doin' this since, you was Reebok, Classic Doubt
Now this ho, wanna get at Nic', why?
Cause I bagged her baby daddy, she ain't seen him since
Nic' so gutter, lil' white tee, need some Air Max on
Some Dolce and Gabbana, pretty panties on
Like, wait 'til the summer catch me, up in the hummer
On my way to 555 front, run with the Rucker
And every baller wanna never, give out my number
Only that email, Cherry-thong.com, -
Holla! Name a girl, as real as her
No, not them! Who's your best emcee?
Nic, Fox, and Kim, can't forget Rem'
Nic' up in the Porsche Box, or the Benz
