[Chorus]
La, la, la, i love ya, just holler
It means that i love you
That’s true story versus mine
And listen carefully, babe
La, la, la, as a matter of fact it’s real talk, honey
It means that i love you
I love you
It means that i never let you go, girl

(Here we go, it’s your boy Hoodstar!)

[Verse 1]
I love you, you love me
Cause they can’t stop what we got
They can’t shot what we shot, or cut what we cut
They say don’t trust, he a rapper
The next time you hear that bullshit, just slap him
Tell him you’re crazy, you know my baby
Bonnie and clyde like bee and Jay-z!
Before the rapping, before all the
Before the light camera action, he was back then
So with louis talking to you, not hoodstar
You love me for me and not for my new car
My heart beat, these things that tell ya
Without you, that’s my body a capela
This sis it, my song to you
Now run and tell your friends my verse belongs to you
True story

[Chorus]
La, la, la, i love ya, just holler
It means that i love you
That’s true story versus mine
And listen carefully, babe
La, la, la, as a matter of fact it’s real talk, honey
It means that i love you
I love you
It means that i never let you go, girl

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I must confess, I love you like
Dudes love breast, they just mad
Cause when I choose, I choose the best
I never settle for less
I must say, you got impeccable taste
Flossy, bossy, gotta a hell of a face
And you? You take the cake
The sex is insane, that’s why I take the pain
And when we finish watch some Major Payne
With stupid ass Damon Wayans, [?]
That's why I get out the coupe and squeeze like two
Niggas disrespect again I'll breeze back through
You know I can’t control my temper, get buck for you
Fuck with who? Nigga, I fucks with you!
Candlelight by the lake, picnic for two
And damn, just think, you picked Nic for you
Out of everybody in the world, I’m your girl
I can see me in that white dress and some pearls

[Chorus]
La, la, la, i love ya, just holler
It means that i love you
That’s true story versus mine
And listen carefully, babe
La, la, la, as a matter of fact it’s real talk, honey
It means that i love you
I love you
It means that i never let you go, girl

[Verse 3]
The reason i love you, squeeze you, please you
Cause you help me get
I was on a.. hand in hand with the
Wasting all my money with a
Kinda hoping i’m on my
You gave me the greatest gift just like a brand new
And that’s priceless, and i ain’t got to make it
I’m just happy to be here reciting my life
And it’s still good
It feels good
So if i don’t go palatine, i’m back at the studio
So what
I like the life when i’m a

[Chorus]
La, la, la, i love ya, just holler
It means that i love you
That’s true story versus mine
And listen carefully, babe
La, la, la, as a matter of fact it’s real talk, honey
It means that i love you
I love you
It means that i never let you go, girl
