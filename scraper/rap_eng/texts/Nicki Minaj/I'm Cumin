[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ok ok ok ok, now who's hot, who's not?
Shorty doo whoop, it's cool you bloodclot (cool)
You come to the spot, see if you don't get got
See if you don't get got, when the semi go cock
I'm like "Aye, what the fuck a bitch think?"
Nick, you know ain't nothing changed, but my wink
Pink on pink, everything in-sync
I write pretty lyrics, every pen pink ink
I'm representin' all my girls, niggas double up
I don't play around, I'm a have to shut her down
Run up into town, I'm a have to get the crown
I'm the Young Queens bitch, with the platinum sound
None of ya girls can steal my shine, Fendi -
Schooled me to the game, now I'm in my prime
Stay humble, stay low, stay on the grind
I don't need a light, but I stay in the lime

[Hook]
When I tell 'em that I'm cumin' I'm cumin'
Rap bitches in the game always huffin' and puffin'
Damn, Why these bitches always frontin' for nuthin'
Fuck around I'm a have these bitches runnin' from suttin'
When I tell 'em that I'm cumin' I'm cumin'
Rap bitches in the game always huffin' and puffin'
(Damn) Why these bitches always frontin' for nuthin'
Fuck around I'm a have these bitches runnin' from suttin'

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Guess what Nicki spit crack, like yayo
Yep, matter fact, when I rap, It's a K.O
Come through the hood, all the boys say "Ayo!"
Lettuce and tomato, don't forget the mayo
Words in the street, that Nicki don't play doe
Bitches pop shit, but they soft like play dough
Gotta lotta banks, so she wanna be me
I gotta full tank, little momma on E
I fly first class overseas, on this BB
Snapple in my hand and it's strawberry kiwi
I ain't even make it, and these girls wanna be me
You "Mrs. Me Too", like you always say me me
I'm who they believe in, mommy don't even
Soon as I put the keys in, I switch like seasons
Get a couple beats from my nigga Doe Beezy
Why would I go hard, when this shit is so easy
