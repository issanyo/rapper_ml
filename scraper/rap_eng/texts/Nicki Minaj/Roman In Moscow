[Verse 1]
I'm big willy, no bike gear
I told you bitches last year
I'm a rap bitch nightmare
That's why I call you Buzz Lightyear
'Cause by the time you start buzzin', bitch
You gon' have white hair
Paparazzi was a fright scare
When I landed out in London it was lookin' like Mike, dear
Mike Jack—who's bad?
Ain't on my period
But I got a new pad
Channel 5, news flash
Pussy clean, who smash?
None of y'all! Canary yellow ball!
These bitches should be worshippin' me in the synagogue!
Hum, hum, done the prayer
B-b-b-bitch I ball, underwear
Oh! Hum, hum, done the prayer?
Did I tell 'em that I ball, underwear?
Okay

[Hook]
Roman, yo what da fuck?
Roman, yo what da fuck?
Roman, yo what da fuck?
Roman, yo what da fuck?
Bitches is insane
These bitches ain't in my lane
Only bitches in the plane is bitches that give me brain!

[Verse 2]
Heron, this shit is lethal
Roman: this is the sequel
Moscow: that's where I keep him
Until he's fully charged
Your favorite rapper prolly suck
As for me, Icy, hockey puck
Anyway, I'm on that new shit
Every trend, I introduce it
Motherfuck you with a big dick
I'm a racist, I'm a bigot
Bitch, I'm thicker than a midget
Yeah I'm crazy—just a smidgen
Motherfuck me, get my wumble
And some Kimmy for my knuckle
Hold on, fuck you
Brace yourself, buck tooth
Yeah I golf, putt too
Swallow balls, nuts to

[Hook]
Camel toe
Roman, yo what da fuck?
Roman, yo what da fuck?
Roman, yo what da fuck?
Roman, yo what da fuck?
Bitches is insane
These bitches ain't in my lane
Only bitches in the plane is bitches that give me brain!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, ain't no motherfuckin 'bridge, bitch
Ain't no motherfuckin’ hook
Ain't no motherfuckin’ third motherfuckin' verse
Roman's back, bitch
I fucked up your life last year this time, remember dat?
Remember dat, bitch?
Remember dat, bitch?
I'm back

[Outro]
