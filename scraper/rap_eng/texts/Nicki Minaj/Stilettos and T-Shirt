[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo
I might do the Fendi's with the round toe
(I can't wait to see you)
GPS the condo
I might do the Gucci's with the sling back
Looking for good brain where ya thinking cap
I might get fly excuse me that's jet lag
Who (?) in the jag from the jag ad
Might run up in Chanel cause I'm that bad
Ain't in the middle east momma but I Baghdad
Note to self
When he open up the door trench coat and belt
T-shirt say Minaj and you and you Jack tripper
Call me cinderella its the leather glass slipper
