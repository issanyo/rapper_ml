[Intro]
This my 9 to 5
Still livin' that high life
Grindin makin money

[Verse 1: Lil Kim]
I grind all day gettin money
Damn it take all day to count the money
I'm in the freezer neck full of iceicles
I'm a dime you other chicas need a nickel
Who that in that Phantom (Kimmy!)
Or maybe in that Mazarati or that F1-50
Or in that Bugatti you can't fuck with me
I do this for my niggas on the grind
Thereâ€™ll never be another me
What you out your mind?
I get poppin when it's money on the line
Damn near dropped a house on my wrist for the shine
Lambouton fendi dior all the time
I snitched in the louis store yea I dropped the dime
Got Baby and Big Daddy Slim on the line
The way that we ball some say it is a crime
But we don't really care I continue gettin mine
Cause this my 9 to 5

[Chorus]
All day

[Verse 2: Birdman]

Fly in the new whip

Hustle all the time and she shine when we hit the bitch
Ball in the club ever night like we do this shit

Bounce right back in my hood with some new shit
Everyday sunshine keep my tool all the time
Blowin out the pound everyday the money on the grind

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, innie mennie minnie moe, I'm pi-pi-pickin' hoes
To pucker up and kiss my ass, under the Mistletoe
Yes I am about my cake, just call me Anna's man
I keep a gentleman, first name Benjamin
Don't mess with Washington, don't mess with Abraham
Patty cake, patty cake, better get the Baker's Man
Frosted flakes is on my fingers, fruity loops is on my wrist
Fruity pebble, Barbie pendant don't forget to ice my kiss
Now where my girls at?
That stack money, that Young Money, that Cash Money
I walk the red carpet, you clean the red carpet
Go get your vaccum, don't you get me started

[Chorus]
All day

Still livin all that I like
Grindin makin money
