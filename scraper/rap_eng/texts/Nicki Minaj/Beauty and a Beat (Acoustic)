[Verse 1]
Show you off, yeah, tonight I want to show you off
Oh, oh
What you got, yeah, a billion could've never bought
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you

[Chorus]
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete, whoa, oh
It's all 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do, whoa, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Body rock, yeah, I wanna feel your body rock
Oh, oh
Take a bow, yeah, girl I'm the hottest ticket now
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you

[Chorus]
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete, whoa, oh
It's all 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do, whoa, oh, oh
