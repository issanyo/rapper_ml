You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You let me win
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide

And when they lookin'
You let me hide
Defend my honor
Protect my pride

The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater

You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money
Just get my weight up

Know when I'm lying
Know when I'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science

Why am I trying?
No, you ain't buying
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance

You make me laugh
You make me hoarse
From yelling at you
And getting at you

Picking up dishes
Throwing them at you
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

What are we doing
Could you see through me?

'Cause you say "Nicki."
And I say "Who, me?"
And you say "No, you."
And I say "Screw you."

Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And I start crying
And I start screaming
The heavy breathing
But what's the reason

Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually fronting
I'm askin' you something
Yo, answer this question
Class is in session

Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind
Capture my soul
Okay, you're right
Just let it go

Okay, you got it
It's in the can
Before I played it
You knew my hand
You could turn a free throw into a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

Stop ohhh... stop ohhh
Would you just stop looking through me 'cause I just can't take it
No I can't take it

You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You see right through me
(You see right through me baby)
You see right through me
You see right through me... yeah yeah
