Damn baby, this thing is on

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
He the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du rag, keep his wave on swim
Wa wa waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cuz I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays me
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Jay Sean]
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (so fine)
Your love, your love (so fine)
Your love, your love (so fine)
Your love, your love (so fine)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Jay Sean / Jay Sean]
Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love
Baby your love
Your love
Your love
Your love
Your love
Baby your
Baby your
Your the illest
Your love
Your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love
