Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Been looking at the things that you got there
You make me wanna draw pictures of you everywhere
You're kinda funny, but you think that I'm a bad girl
Such a hottie hottie stuck inside a cold world
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
You always seem to like a little hide and seek
You keep me guess, so I can play a game of double jeopardy
You got me wondering if you ever gonna make a move
If you would ask me, I would tell you that it's over, dude
Sometimes I just lie awake
And I rewind and replay everything that you say
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
It's like living on a dream
Running circles in the street
You can call it A.D.D
If you want to
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
I promise I don't need to geek out
But if I ever got you home
I'd tell you baby, I would freak out
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about -
Stuck inside a cold world
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
It's like living on a dream
Running circles in the street
You can call it A.D.D
If you want to
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
