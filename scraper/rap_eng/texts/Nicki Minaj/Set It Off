[Talkin: Nicki Minaj]
Chea, Nicki Minaj
Dirty Money, Young Money
Yo, why the fuck these little bitches always talking shit about what they did and...?
I don't give a fuck, bitch!
Nicki Lewinsky
Look (fucker!)

[Verse: 1]
When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
"Nick-Nack, Carry Crack", what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, looking real low-key
I do a striptease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker, I was sippin' on a Smucker's
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud

[Spoken: Nicki Minaj]
You know, I'mma put them bitches in a time machine and, and, and, and... send 'em back to the past and shit
Bitches always talking 'bout shit they did and all that
Bitch, get in a time machine!

[Verse: 2]
Time machine bitches always talkin' about the old days
When they was hot, when they was tourin' with the OJ's
I tell a bitch this: "I'm not impressed, bitch"
I'm Nicki M, trick, I'm always on the guest list
I'm on my way to Riker's Island with a couple hard
I'm on a bike, nine-five-four double R
And they don't write shit, they might write a couple bars
That's why they getting drop-dropped, like a couple cars
(You shouldn't have said that) NY to NO
Late Night shows, like Letterman and Leno
End, where you cut it, home-slice, your gar-bage
White boys tell me that I rock, like guitars

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
See, see, you see Anna Mae?
I'm about to slap ya'll bitches 'round and call ya'll Anna Mae
Like, that, that's what y'all gon' get in a minute, real talk, like
Cause, you know, this is '08 now, like
So, anything you talk about, like, it gotta be, it gotta be, at least, within a two-year radius type shit, like
I don't care what happened 50 years ago, like
You know, you know, you know, call-- all bets are off, bitches
You know, game just begun
