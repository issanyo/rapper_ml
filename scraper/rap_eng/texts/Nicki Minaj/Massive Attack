[Intro: Alex da Kid & Nicki Minaj]
Shhhh, Alex Da Kid is coming
It's Barbie, bitches!

[Interlude: Sean Garrett]
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Tom-Toms like in Lebanon, hotter than in Pakistan
Click click click, Young Nick', the atomic bomb
Yeah, see it then you lick your tongue (haha!)
Bet that it tastes good, get you some
Wicked, got ten bad bitches
We sh-sh-shut it (down!) like the club got glitches, dig it?
And while you do that, GT's pullin up
Yeah, spaceship, E.T.'s in the cut, yeah
P-pop a bottle, just to get my head right
Tell the doctor, go and get my meds right
Monster, you know it wouldn't be proper
If we didn't return with a big rocket launcher

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Massive attack, massive attack
Got them bomb-bombs make the whole club go back, ayy
Bet the DJ gon' bring this one back, ayy
Like the swagger bomb bring on this track, ayy
Massive attack, massive attack
What's been done-done need no more say, that's that, ayy
Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night 'til we see the sun

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
So, so hot in here, feels like a jungle (Yeah!)
Me don't like boys that ain't jumbo (Yeah!)
One time, bust a shot for my champion girls
Tell them guys super-size me a combo
Kn-kn-know I got the ammo, that's why I bulletproofed the Lambo
In the Middle East on a camel
Runnin' through the jungle, (Rambo!), Liberace (tango!)
Swingin on the vine, mango (Mango?)
So call me Simba, little mama, cause Mufasa couldn't stop a bitch
I fly in on that chopper, just to buy Balenciaga
It's just me, Mr. Miyagi, and the Phantom of the Opera
Goin' blaka motherfucker
Got that big, rocket launcher!

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Massive attack, massive attack
Got them bomb-bombs make the whole club go back, ayy
Bet the DJ gon' bring this one back, ayy
Like the swagger bomb bring on this track, ayy
Massive attack, massive attack
What's been done-done need no more say, that's that, ayy
Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night 'til we see the sun

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
(Detonatin' the bomb)
Detonatin' the fire, Ros√© by the bucket, money makin' attire
(Detonatin' the bomb)
Detonatin' them hits, finna buy out the bar, all my bitches is rich
(You better duck when it comes)
Better duck cause it's comin'
(Best believe me, you're on)
G-got 'em runnin', r-runnin'
Now tell them rap bitches that Nicki said this:
"We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta!"

[Interlude: Sean Garrett]
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Massive attack, massive attack
Got them bomb-bombs make the whole club go back, ayy
Bet the DJ gon' bring this one back, ayy
Like the swagger bomb bring on this track, ayy
Massive attack, massive attack
What's been done-done need no more say, that's that, ayy
Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night 'til we see the sun
