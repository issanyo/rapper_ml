[Verse 1: DJ Webstar]
In the club I just don't know how to act
I get your wifey, hit your wifey
But I never call her back
The Audemar all black, Coupe all black
And we buying out the bar
You see you that black Airmax
1 bottle, 2 bottle, 3 bottle, 4
Soon as I finish these, the waitress bringing me more
It's Webstar and Nicki, bunch of 100s, bunch of 50s
So many shots in the club they think we J Lo and Diddy
Who do it like me? Call me Carson Daly, Mr. MTV
That's why you envy me call me Kemba in the club
I'm the MVP

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I’m the Barbie, keep a lot of plastic
Little pink stars, put em on my jacket
Somebody tell her I'mma put her in a casket
Bitches throw my money for the money gymnastics
Cause I make a flip so they be looking all nasty
Cooler than the hail, I tell her hail that taxi!
Bitch won’t blow but she gon' blow my saxy-phone
And I call Sax Fifth Ave-y home
That is where a real bad Barbie roam, r-r-r-r-r-roam
Sorry I broke up, excuse my cell phone
It must be a AT&T dead zone
My niggas in the club, we let the heat roam
Need my Rosé, I need my Patron
Need my Henny and I'mma need my Hypno
That's 1 bottle, 2 bottle, 3 bottle, 4

[Hook: Nicki Minaj & DJ Webstar]
Nah I’m good I just bought the bar nigga
Step your pussy up and all that
Step your pussy up and all that
Step your pussy up and all that
Nah I'm good I just bought the bar nigga
Step your money up and all that
Step your money up and all that
Step your money up and all that
