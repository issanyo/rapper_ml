Chorus:
You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x4
[x2]

Verse 1 :
You let me win
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
& when they lookin'
You let me hide
Defend my honor
Protect my pride
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money
Just get my weght up
Know when i'm lying
Know when i'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science
Why am i trying
No you ain't buying
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance
You make me laugh
You make me hoarse
From yelling at chu
And getting at chu
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at chu
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you

Chorus :
You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x4
[x2]

Verse 2:
What are we doing
Could you see through me ?
Cause you say nikki
And i say who me ?
And you say no you
And i say screw you
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And i start crying
And i start screaming
The heavy breathing
But what's the reason
Always get the reaction you wanted
Im actually fronting
Im askin' you something
Yo, answer this question
Class is in session
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind
Capture my soul
Ok your right
Just let it go
Ok you got it
It's in the can
Before i played it
You knew my hand
You could turn a free throw into a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

Chorus:
You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x4
[x2]
Stop ohhh..
..stopp ohhh
Would you just stop looking through me cause i just can't take it
No i can't take it
You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x5
[x2]
You see right through me
(you see right through me baby)
You see right through me x2
....yeah yeah
