[Intro: Ciara]
I don’t believe in much but I believe in you
I don’t believe I care, cause I don’t follow rules
I see a star so bright; no one could been that blind
No one can crush you out but you

[Hook: Ciara]
And I, I , I
Living on the world turning
And I, I, I
Ima be giving mine
And I, I, I
I’ll be wrong if I don’t try
I don’t know when my next move is coming
All I know is I’ll be running
I, I, I, I’ll be living up
I’ll be living up
I, I, I, I’ll be throwing it up
I’ll be throwing it up
I, I, I, I’ll be playin it cool
Cause a girl’s gonna do
What a girl’s gonna do
Makin up my own rules
Ola Ola eh

[Verse 1: Ciara]
I had my doubts in love but I know it’s true
I don’t have many friends, but I got you
You are a walking God, you are a secret ball?
Something no one can take from you

[Hook: Ciara]
And I, I , I
Living on the world turning
And I, I, I
Ima be giving mine
And I, I, I
I’ll be wrong if I don’t try
I don’t know when my next move is coming
All I know is I’ll be running
I, I, I, I’ll be living up
I’ll be living up
I, I, I, I’ll be throwing it up
I’ll be throwing it up
I, I, I, I’ll be playin it cool
Cause a girl’s gonna do
What a girl’s gonna do
Makin up my own rules

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I told Cici I was getting her
I told the bitches can’t see her, no retina
I told ha if you gon' win, there’s no letting up
See, they could kick you while you’re down, but you’re getting up
See ain’t a man that could block what God bless
So if a chick wanna try she a hot mess
‘Cause this one is for the girls making progress
See I’m a monster, no I’m not a Lochness
Put my, put my, put my work ethic damn in that lock next
That’s why this little Trini girl get the top checks
Went from watching niggas cook up in the pyrex
But now I rock jets, meetings with the top reps

[Hook: Ciara]
Ima live life to the fullest
I’ll be speeding like a bullet
I’ll be rolling like a train
I’ll be dancing in the rain

[Outro: Ciara]
I, I, I, I’ll be living up
I’ll be living up
I, I, I, I’ll be throwing it up
I’ll be throwing it up
I, I, I, I’ll be playin it cool
Cause a girl’s gonna do
What a girl’s gonna do
Makin up my own rules
Ola Ola eh
Ola Ola eh
Ola Ola eh
Ola Ola eh
Ola Ola eh
Ola Ola eh
Ola Ola eh
Ola Ola eh
