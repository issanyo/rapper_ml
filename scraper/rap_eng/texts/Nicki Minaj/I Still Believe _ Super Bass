Blaine:
Oh, yeah, mhm
You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy, but
You still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
Wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

Blaine with New Directions harmonizing:
I still believe
That someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
Oh, baby, yeah
I had a dream
You and me
Will find ourselves in love again
Oh oh oh oh

New Directions (Blaine):
(I) I still believe (Baby, I do)
Someday you and me

Blaine with New Directions:
Just give me one more try
In love again

Sue:
Oh, yeah-eah
