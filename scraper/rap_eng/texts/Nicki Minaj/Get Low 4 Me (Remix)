[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Kyuh
Yo I came through to get low, low
Hit the beat on repeat, let's go, go
If he ain't got money, that's a no, no
Move my [?] in slow mo
I'm with the big [?] that Lalo
We in the all-black tinted out Taho
Twenty-two tommy guns, we got those
Just walked off the cover of Cosmo
Anyway, when I do it, it get done
When I do it, they get sprung
Stuttering like um, um
Pink thongs, I'm the bomb like tic, tic
I'm not a lollipop but they wanna lick me
See I'm a diva, I am a keeper
Hots and shoes getting [?] your beeper
When we come through we get low, low
Just so all y'all bitches know, know
Kyuh!

[Chorus: Barbee]
Sexy, sexy, can you handle me?
Sexy, sexy, can you handle me?
Licking your lips, grabbing my hips
You get low

[Nicki Minaj]
I'm with the big [?] that Lalo
We in the all-black tinted out Taho
