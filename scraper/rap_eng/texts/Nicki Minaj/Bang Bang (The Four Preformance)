[Verse 1 - Candice & Cheyenne]
Sure she got a body like an hourglass
But I can give it to you all the time
Sure she got a booty like a Cadillac
But I can send you into overdrive (oh)
You've been waiting for that
Step on up, swing your bat
You see anybody could be bad to you
You need a real girl to blow your mind, yeah

[Chorus - Jason]
Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I’ll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah)
Go, girl

[Verse 2 - Zhavia, Cheyenne, Jason &  Candice]
She might’ve let you hold her hand at school
But I’mma show you how to graduate
No, I don’t need to hear you talk the talk
Just come and show me what your momma gave 'ya
I heard you've gotta big baby, mouth but don’t say a thing
Anybody could be good to you
You need a real girl to blow your mind

[Chorus - All]
Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I’ll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
