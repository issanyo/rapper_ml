[Intro]
Young Money

[Verse 1]
Said, baby, no, no, no, no, no
You know my loving ain't free, babe
Won't make you do what you don't wanna do
What you don't wanna do, no that ain't me, babe
Said, baby, nah nah nah, I ain't with the drama
That ain't what I need
I need you ten hut now, need you ten toes down, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
So, baby, come make your mind up
Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
Said, baby, come make your mind up

[Chorus]
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

[Verse 2]
Said, baby, I-I-I got so used to it being on a creep, babe
Yeah, maybe I-I-I got so used to just giving you the least, babe
But nowadays, I need more from ya
I need something I can keep
Said nowadays, I need real
Nowadays, I need you to take the lead

[Pre-Chorus]
Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
Say, baby, come make your mind up
Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
Say, baby, come make your mind up

[Chorus]
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

[Verse 3]
Ay yo, bring in the blunt, Emily Blunt
Platinum back, ice bling in the front
I'ma land the jump, Yao Mingin the dunk
And I'm playing the field, Brad Wingin the punt
I'ma tell him I love him in the foreign and cuff him
Whips in immigration, everything on them is custom
Now they calling me Billy, I'm the goat
No Achilles heel since I left Philly
Countin' them millis to billis
Beep beep beep beep, put the hurt on me
Yeah, I'm wearing jeans, but he put the skrt on me
Rode him to sleep, and then I put his shirt on me
Pussy clean, these niggas ain't got no dirt on me
Gotta play it by my rules or I swerve on him
Bout my cash money, you can ask Bird or Slim
Took him to my paradise, silk ribbon my linen
Now he got a big thing for Caribbean women

[Chorus]
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
