[Intro]
Chin checker, chin checker
Chin checker, I'm the chin checker, nigga

[Verse 1]
It was a quarter past 3 when I ran into Rells
Didn't forget my keys, but my name ring bells
A little white tee, some Adidas with the shells
Turn in the coupe, oh shoot, broke a nail
Lemme lemme think what I gotta gotta do
Should I get the black or the chrome 22?
Cause if a bird try to get out of the cage
One bitch down, New York Times front page
I went to Starbucks, I wanted to get a frappe
Then had a Snapple, apple with the capple
That's Fendi, but that's irrelevant
Threw him a couple Benjis, now I'm the president
I'm Nicki, finicky, so picky
Slick like Ricky, flow be so icky
Now class is finished, you'll be home 'bout 3
Tell all them rap bitches whatchu know 'bout me, nigga

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me

[Verse 2]
Got some nice titties, yes, they wild pretty
That's how I got the S, the five-fifty
That's cause I get, I get, I get busy
That's why I don't need you to come get me (no)
I'm badder than the dude at the Neverland
In the money green coupe with the Leprechaun
Holler at him, get a four-leaf-clover
Go a- go against me, guaranteed you're over
Look, all the kids sweat Nic like a Mexican (mira, mira)
Cause I got more kicks than a temper tanâ€”
Trum-trum-trum, you slowpoke
Better rum, rum, rum a little coke
And-a S-M-I-the-L-E
And ain't one thing them could tell me
Cause I write, write, write my own shit
I'm the one, like I'm the culprit, nigga

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know' bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me
