[Intro:]
I don't wanna sound mad, though! I don't wanna sound mad!
I feel marvelous right now!
Dirty money!

[Verse:]
Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown
She won 3 rounds, I'mma need a hundred thou
Like china town, bitches better bow down
Oh, you ain't know? bet ya'll bitches know now
Fuck I gotta do to let 'em know that I'm the one?
Way I ride the drum they salute me in the slum
In the 6 hun the color of bubble gum
I'm with my nigga spits and my nigga, bun crum (waddup!)
Yes, I'm the one, I'm the motherfuckin' one (chyeah!)
Hold more weight than the late big pun (oh!)
Bitches talk slick, but they ain't say nun (no!)
Mad cause I'm bad, 2 sticks in my bun (chyeah!)
Yes, sir, look what i've done
They r-run, run when I come
Bum-stickity-bum, let me tell 'em where I'm from
Queens, little mama, gabbana, some nice pumps (chyeah!)
