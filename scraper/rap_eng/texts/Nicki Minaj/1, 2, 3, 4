(It's Barbie bitch)
I'm the Barbie
Keep a lotta plastic
Little pink stars
Put em on my jacket
Somebody tell her I'mma put her in a casket
Register my money for the money gymnastic
Cause I make it flip so they be lookin' all nasty
Colder then a hail I tell her hail that taxi
Bitch won't blow but she can blow my saxophone
And I call Saks Fifth Ave-y home
That is where a real bad barbie roam
R-r-r-r-r-roam
Sorry I broke up excuse my cell phone
It must be a AT&T dead zone
My niggas in the club he let heat roam
Need my rozay I need my patron
Need my Henny and I need my Hypno
That's one bottle, two bottle, three bottle, four
