{ rap: Nicki Minaj} Now whose hot, whose not? Shorty du whoop, it's
Cool you blood clot, (COOL), you come to the spot see if you

My wink (okaye), pink on pink everything insync, I write pretty lyrics every pen pink ink
I'm representin all my girls, niggas double up, I don't play around I'm a have to
Shut 'er down, run up into town I'm a have to get the crown, I'm the Youngs Queens
Bitch with the platinum sound, None of ya girls can steal my shine, Fendi brought me to
The game, Now I'm in my prime (yup), stay humble, stay low, stay on the grind
I don't needa a light but I stay in the lime

[Hook:]

Fuck around I'm a have these bitches runnin from suttin [x2]
