I find myself thinking about what you do
Though I know I’m better off without you
I never break down any longer
I don’t know why I can’t move on
I really need, I really want you to

Refrein:
Bring me down!
Yeah I miss that mess you make
Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, bring me down

I’m looking back, I see I wasn’t happy
To do, do it again, yeah that would be crazy
It’s so uncommon quiet without you
Got to admit that I long for you
I really need, I really want you to

Refrein
Bring me down!
Yeah I miss that mess you make
Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, Yeah

You’re the river I’ll be drowning in some day
I take my chances anyway

Refrein 3x
Bring me down
Yeah I miss that mess you make
Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, bring me down
