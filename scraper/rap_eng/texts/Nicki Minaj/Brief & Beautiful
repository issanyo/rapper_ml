Only had a little taste
But I remember how it felt
And all the phone calls late at night
Though we tried, we couldn`t make it right

When the seasons changed
Everything got colder
Everyone could hear, our illusion crush
It was all we had

So every minute that I’ve spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful

When we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So...
Brief and beautiful
So...

When flowers bloom in may
I go back to yesterday
When I woke up next to you
I would bring it all back if I could

Make it good or bad
I know it is too late
So I’m moving on
But I won`t forget
All that is unsaid

So every minute that I’ve spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful

When we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So...
Brief and beautiful
So...

It was so short
It was so sweet
Like every good thing
It`s not yours to keep
Everything fades away
And now it’s gone
