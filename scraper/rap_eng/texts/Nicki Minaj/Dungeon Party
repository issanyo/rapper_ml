SAS..Nicki M

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Went out to London partied at the dungeon
Went out to London partied at the dungeon
Got - got them Bvlgaris any colour it comes in
Went out to London partied at the.....
Went out to London partied at the dungeon
Went out to London partied at the dungeon
Got - got them Bvlgaris any colour it comes in
Went out to London partied at the.....

[Verse 1: Mega]
Bottles get to poppin', models get to flockin'
Rushing the V.I.P
Ssshhhh say nuttin', I stay stuntin'
Fly boy you can see I be
Went out to London partied in the dungeon
Pretty women we getting 'em in abundance
Head gone missing from sipping Remy in functions
Suave on a trillion spot him soon as he comes in
It's gonna get live in a bit, have you seen her?
It was all eyes on this chick, winding her hips
I'm right behind as she dips, she on it, see that she want it
Biting her lips
Last couple shots made my head spin, faded like the wash on my Edwins
I get tings i ain't trying to stunt, i hit and run like I'm driving drunk
Nicki talk to 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mayhem]
When we out there raving, so suave it's flagrant
The girls they behaving the worse
Goin out of they mind, coz my game is refined
Now every girl claiming I'm hers oi Oii
Mad ting, I float where I'm standing
Runway, make room when I'm landing
Raaaaah Raaaaah like a dungeon dragon,
In Maha when I come through swagging
B lined as I stepped through the crowd then I asked her
U ever had sex on a cloud?
Let me pin u, I'm not trying spin u
I'll link u and take through to the places I been to
We celebrating, here's to elevation
Positive chi no need for jealous hating
Made dough running the streets now we made men
So we ain't even gotta compete to make a statement

[Hook]
