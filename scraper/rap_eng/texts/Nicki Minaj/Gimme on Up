Yo, he don't know me but he setting up to blow me, uh

On the low I used to holla at his homie, uh
Fuck it, now I’m ’bout to ride him like a pony, yeah
Okay, thug prolly, yo come polly
He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop Molly
I hope your pockets got a muthafuckin' pot belly
Or is it that you never ball? John Salley
𝘖𝘩 𝘰𝘩 𝘰𝘩 𝘢𝘩𝘩
He had the Rolls in his Royce, the tone in his voice
Don’t want a good girl, naw, hoes is his choice
D-D-Dick on H, pussy on W
Mouth on open, ass on smother you
Ass on the cover too, Elle Magazine

Could I be your wife? Naw, we could bang though
I got these niggas whipped, call me Django

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Don't be ashamed, any time, any place
Let him know that you got it like that
When you love him that good, and you treat him like you should
Gonna keep him coming right back
