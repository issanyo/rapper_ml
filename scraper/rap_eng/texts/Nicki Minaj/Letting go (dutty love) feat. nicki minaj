Hey, yo Sean, you Mr. Kingston
You say you have it, Louis it, and then some
Look how you gwan in all your ice
You're pretty and you're nice, you dun know us say Nicki are your wife

But truth say I be up where you stay
I ain't like them other bitches that be actin' loosely
Know you gettin' hype, I know you wanna get up in it
But I just want to think about it for another minute

I think I like your style, wile
Why don't we let go?
Hey yo, and I ain't gotta tell 'em, and I ain't gotta sell 'em
It's YSL teddy, I ain't gotta spell it

And yes, I killa kill 'em, I guess I am the villain
I park on the curb, I'm the owner of the building, the building
Ya deaf? Boy, me soon left
Come get this playboy bunny like Hugh Hef

Rastafari
