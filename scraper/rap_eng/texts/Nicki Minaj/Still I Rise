[Verse 1]
She said "fuck Fendi", but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim; her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name, Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run to see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leavin' comments
And you know, that I got some more haters with me, might hit up This Is 50
MTV, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki

[Refrain x2]
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothin' I do ever is good enough for the music biz
(Nothing I do is good enough for you)

[Verse 2]
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
Cause if Nicki win, then all of ya'll gettin' meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris Lighty
When you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around, that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swirvin' the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-popping on my poppers so the cops see, bitches

[Refrain x2]
