You're trying to tell me you're saying goodbye
I'm watching you leaving not believing my eyes
You'd better be looking over your shoulder
Cause I know too much for this to be over
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it
What once was good is gone like innocence we watched it dying
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it, can't hide it
Let it go...
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it, let it go...
I always hoped that this would last forever
Just you and me against the world
What once was powerful has weakened now we can't pretend
What once was right is wrong like everything this game must end
Oh baby, the lies and deception
We're gonna bring each other down
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it
Let it go (let it go)
I told you all (let it go)
I told you all (let it go)
I told you, told you, let it go
