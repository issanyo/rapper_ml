Thinkin out loud
This hydros got me higher than a mother fucking cloud
Swimming in a sea of rappers til I'm gonna drown
Im a high roller I'm more than ready to throw down

I'll be Rollin across town
To hood near you
To diss your crew
I ain't got nothin to do

And Id prefer if you kicked my ass at high noon
But if you're late to the party, then three twenty sounds good too

Laid up in my hood
Far from relaxing
Opportunities come up quick
But they keep on passin

So I gotta grab the mic every second I can
Run up on your show and snatch the mother fucker in my hand

Start spitting
Crowds booing
Take a gun out
Start shooting

At the sky
We've established i  am ready to die
Toss my piece to the audience
To see who's gonna give it a try
(Record skips, gun shots and crowd screams)

Whoops
Oh shit bro this is horrible
I just turned your concert to a horror show

With no regrets
Cause that's the best way to live
When you're born to die young
There's only so many fucks to give

And punks to shiv
And I can hold grudges
So I can't forgive

I'd like to blame the press
For the mess I'm in
Spark a controversy so your heads'll spin
I fight to win
I like to sin
I might go in

But for now
I'll be here thinkin out loud
About how to draw my own goddamn crowd

Maybe I'll start with a little shock value
I'll go and my brains out

How'd I do?
