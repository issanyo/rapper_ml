(Intro: Nicki Minaj)
Now I endorse this message now I endorse this message (repeat)

(Hook: Yamine)
Down In the meadow
I just wanted out the trap
Down in the meadow
All these niggas wanna rap
Down in the meadow
I got these bitches on my back
Fuck around a G and get hit with a bat
Fuck around a G then start witnessing the Mack
Fuck around Yamine you'll end up in a trap
Down in the meadow all these bitches running back
Down in the meadow I'm coming in and at

(Verse 1: Yamine)
Yamine with the flow
Nicki run the show
Coming up with verses
Then head to the studio
I-I-I-I-I want in and never out
Down south all trout bitches showin' out
Ok with the J
Ok with the day
Never going in and all I do is make play
Burnin up them bushes and then make a newly slay
Free my nigga Tay-K he got caught up with the case
Catch me in a race
Catch me with the wraith
Hot sauce drippin on my chicken
And smashin with my face
I'll do this in my way
I'll do this in my fray
I don't know what this is but I have this in a pay

(Hook: Yamine)
Down In the meadow

Fuck around a G then start witnessing the Mack
Fuck around Yamine you'll end up in a trap
Down in the meadow all these bitches running back

(Verse 2: Nicki Minaj)
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy
Anyway Britney, why they so jealous that you teamed up with' me?
Tell 'em they my son, yup, gyal 'em a mi pickney
Anyway, burned Breadale'
What's that? I know boy for real
