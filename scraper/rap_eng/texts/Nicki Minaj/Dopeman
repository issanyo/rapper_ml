Ayo, once upon a time there lived a little bad bitch
I just press the buttons on my little gadgets
Born in December so I am a Sagit
Tarius, maybe just a little Bi-curious
Yo, miney-mo-to-eenie-meenie
Your wish is my command
I mean I really, really mean it
Cause I am the lady that was on "I Dream Of Genie"
They call it spaghetti but I call it ling-uini
Coke fizzles if you wanna get the sniffles
I got that wet-wet it could get wetter than a drizzle
Plus I got plenty, no seeds in my twenty
And I just got them peanut butter crack sandwiches
You need a dopeman, Oh you need a snowman
I got that Lohan, weight like Rosanne
But f*ckin' with my money is a no-no man
I got them Bar-billions, they call me Cole-man
