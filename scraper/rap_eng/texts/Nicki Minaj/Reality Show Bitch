(Intro)

Only Fire, Fuck It Up!

Now you wanna talk about stopping bags
But there's two innocent girls in the strip club right now
That ain't did nothing but go to the strip club and get money
Now they can't get no money so who stopping bags?

Cause you got crown ass fucking men showing up to where
The fuck they at and where they work at. They can't feed
Their kids they can't feed their fucking family

Real bitches never do that you never attack the woman
You take that up with your fucking man, you never attack
The woman

Cause you know they can't afford security?

So you scaring these girls to death and they can't even
Come to work anymore, and you wanna let your
Publicist write something about stopping bags

Do you know what the fuck it is to sit in your
Fucking room writing raps?

(Interlude) Who are you angry at?
Who are you angry at sweet heart?
You got this woman crying  and scared to leave their
House because you mad at what another man sticking
His dick inside of

A woman can not give your man pussy
If he doesn't stick his dick in there

A woman can not give your man pussy
If he doesn't stick his dick

I'm not the bitches in the strip club
Bi-bi-bitches in the strip club

And i'm not a Reality Show Bitch, Reality Show Bitch

I'm not the bitches in the strip club
Bi-bi-bitches in the strip club

And i'm not a Reality Show Bitch, Reality Show Bitch

You came into my fucking culture
I never had to fuck the DJ to play my songs

You're calling black women, roaches
You be getting girls beat up, this woman
Is at the best stage of her career and she's here out
Throwing bottles and throwing shoes, throwing shoes

Calling a dead child a 'monkey' but telling people
Somebody talked about your child, that never
Talked about your motherfuckin' child, talked
About your  talked about motherfuckin' child
NO!

So you can get some  fucking sympathy points
NO. This is disgusting

A woman can not give your man pussy
If he doesn't stick his dick in there

A woman can not give your man pussy
If he doesn't stick his dick

I'm not the bitches in the strip club
Bi-bi-bitches in the strip club

And i'm not a reality show bitch

I'm not the bitches in the strip club
Bi-bi-bitches in the strip club

And i'm not a reality show bitch
Reality Show Bitch

I'm not the bitches in the strip club
Bi-bi-bitches in the strip club

And i'm not a reality show bitch
