[Intro:]
Yo, listen
All y'all muh'fuckas
Y'all know who Nicki Maraj is
Y'all better ask somebody
Look, Narcotics on the beat, bitches
And I-, lemme, loo-, I-, I'm getting tired of y'all niggas and-and-and y'all bitches that be getting on my goddamn nerves
I gotta tell y'all bout y'allselves
Let's go, c'mon

[Verse 1]
Y’all must not know who I am
I don't get to the spot till 2 AM
Don’t be mad, lil' mama, cuz you not in
E'r'r'body wanna roll with the crew I’m in
They wanna know why I’m posted at the bar
I tell ‘em that I’m just singing posters at the bar
But really, Y'all know why I’m posted at the bar
You bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar
I get cake cuz I always got a hustle
I pump weight and I ain’t talkin’ ’bout my muscles
At the club every day but that ho ain’t me
Cuz I be home with the scale like Do Ray Mi

[Chorus]
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

[Verse 2]
I hate a dude that be actin’ like he get dough
But you know money short like Sisco
Actin’ like he got funds for days
Tryna act like a mac, yeah the one with dame
I hate a dude with a mad, bling-a-bling
That shit don’t make up, for no wack ding-a-ling
I hate a dude, that be pushin’ a Benz
Or he live with his mother, or he stay with his friends
Nigga please, what the fuck you done for me
Say you run your company, but can't have company
I guess the Lord just be tryna humble me
How the fuck you eatin’ tuna and it's not bumblebee

[Chorus]
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

[Verse 3]
I hate a girl that be stuntin’ in the game
Iced out chain with her best friend name
Cuz them the girls that be swervin’ in my lane
Why they lookin’ for change in they boyfriend Range
I hate a clown touch down to my town
But when the check come she short like bust downs
I hate a girl stay singin’ in public
Everywhere I go bitch be singin’ some dumb shit (shut the fuck up)
If I could get a deal I'd have one too
I hate a girl that see her man and say , that’s my boo (stop playing)
It make you mad when they front like they right
They need help like they only got 5 on it

[Chorus]
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back
