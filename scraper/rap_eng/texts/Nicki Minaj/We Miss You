[Verse 1]
Why’d you have to leave in July
On a peaceful and serene Summer night
I wish that you would've waited until September
Just a couple more memories to remember
I guess I have to pay you back to your lender
I guess I have to send you back to the sender
But then again maybe you're gone til November
And maybe this is just part of the agenda

[Hook]
Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

[Verse 2]
Why couldn’t you come right home
When you seen the text message in your phone
I should have put my pride aside to come and find you
I could've told you about the niggas that's behind you
Could have told you all about my intuition
I could have even bought the extra ammunition
But now you moved on so fuck you
Should’ve known from day one I couldn’t trust you

[Hook]
Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

[Verse 3]
Why would they take you from me
Why the doctors couldn't stop the bleeding
If you in a better place, then you’re free
Well then, why can’t they make me believe it
You said that you will leave these streets
And I know you didn’t mean in a body bag
But now you see you not bulletproof
And I’m mad cause
You’re the best that I’ve ever had

[Hook]
Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

[Outro]
I’ll never love again
I’ll never love again
I’ll never, I’ll never
I’ll never love again
What would you suggest that I do now
Why’d you leave
I hate you
