[Hook: Pharrell]
All y'all niggas wanna get like me
Surrounded by bitches that look like these
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
All my niggas be blowin on trees
Hands so sick so they throwin up keys
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I say all y'all niggas wanna get like me
(All y'all niggas wanna get like me)
Now who wanna shake don’t look and see
And then count the bitches, nigga - 1, 2, 3
I said and if you feel like something else there
Then tell her that you down for something else yea
And if she say, "Kissin' far as it goes"
Don’t worry, she straight like a actress nose
You can ball and ball, do it wall to wall
Just sayin that you can’t do it small is all
You can floss Rolex over Audemar
Om the arm and I’m outshining all of y'all
Can you feel it? Hey, hey
Do you want more? Hey, hey
Til yo back sore Hey, hey
So let’s go, let’s go - AOOOWWW~!

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh! I'm the shizzniyee
You should follow my example - bitch, i.e
Cuz I'm front row, Isaac Mizrahi
In the truck but I ain't suck diznayee
All these hoes wanna get like me
Get their own speakers and some prose like me
When I'm at the game, all the pros like me
Bitch I'm a pro, ain't a ho like me
Bitches ain't stuntin' in the cold like me
Some call me bitchie, so Necole like me
Pull up in the ghost, East Coast like me
My nigga spend money like the coke price free
Uhn! Bon voyage, Nicki M. Baby, Buns Minaj
Back of the ‘Bach slumpty, Humpty Dumpty
On the back of the bike, these stunts be comfy

[Bridge: Pharrell]
You wrong
Why you dance solo to this song?
Where your boyfriend at, he gone?
Is that a napkin you put your number on?
You so wrong
Drop down shawty, get your eagle on
Tell your boyfriend you stayin with Simone
Matter of fact, put your number in my phone

[Verse 3: Nelly]
I’m a fly nigga tatted up with the fade
Yea I was rocking waves when them niggas had braids
It was Air Force 1’s then I took em all to J's
Now they wanna play dumb like they from the Bay
I was tourin overseas, 2-50 everyday
Just came back in the middle of the may
In the Maybach with this chick named May
Wanna know if she can do me, Shawty yes you may
See the whole rap game sounded like me
Put that on the drums but it sounded like P
Shawty say she horny, sounded like it
So she wanna bring her partner, okay the sound like 3
Fresh off the yacht, feet in the sand
Walk in the club, meet with her man
Got a whip on the lot, 'bout 400 grand
Go around my nigga, puts me close to hand cuz
