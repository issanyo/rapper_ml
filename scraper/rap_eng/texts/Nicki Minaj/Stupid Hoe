[Intro]
Uhh
Yo
Yo

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I get it cracking like a bad back
Bitch talking she the queen when she looking like a lab rat
I’m Angelina, you Jennifer
Come on bitch, you see where Brad at?

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
Ice my wrist-es then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick, if you take these jizzes
You don’t like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Cause I pull up and I’m stuntin but I ain't a stuntman
Yes, I’m rockin' Jordans, but I ain't a jumpman
Bitches play the back 'cause they know I’m the frontman
Put me on a dollar 'cause I’m who they trust in
Ayo SB, what the fuck’s good?
We ship platinum, them bitches is shippin' wood
Them nappy headed hoes, but my kitchen good
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish a bitch would

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho
Yeah, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
Yeah, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, look Bubbles, go back to ya habitat
MJ gone, and I ain't havin' that
How you gonna be the stunt double to the nigga monkey?
Top of that I’m in the Phantom lookin' hella chonky

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
Ice my wrist-es then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick, if you take these jizzes
You don’t like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I pull up in the Porsche, but it ain't de Rossi
Pretty bitches only could get in my posse
Yes, my name is Roman, last name is Zolanski
But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey, yo Baby Bop, fuck you and your EP
Who’s gassin' this ho? BP?
Hmm.. thinks
One, two, three , do the Nicki Minaj blink
These hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody
These hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho
Yeah, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
Yeah, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
If you cute, then your crew can roll
If you sexy, eat my cucka roll
Put ya cape on, you a super ho
Twenty twelve, I’m at the Super Bowl
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid ho shoulda befriended me then she coulda prolly came back
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid ho shoulda befriended me then she could've probably came back
You a stupid ho, you a stupid ho, you a stupid ho
And I ain't hit that note, but fuck you stupid ho, fuck you stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho and fuck a stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho and fuck a stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho and fuck a stupid ho

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
I am the female Weezy
