[Hook 1: M.I.A]
Down the drain
Down the drain
Down the drain
Down down down down
Make it drop

[Interlude]
We squeeze
We sniff
We cut it up
M-M-M-M-I-A
The ultimate

[Intro: M.I.A]
M-M-M-M-I-A
Oh, it's M.I.A
Oh, wow
It's M.I.A., wow

[Bridge: M.I.A]
Rock it, rock it to the stars
Rock it, rock it to the space
Rock it, rock it to the bar
Rock it, rock it off your face

[Verse 1: M.I.A]
Johnnie keep walking, Jack does too much coke
Jim Beam and Jameson, they just give me joke
When I see Pernot, I say "oh hell no"
Kahlua's a turn-off, tell him to Smirnoff
Captain Morgan shot the sparks
When we hang out, he shoot arrows through my heart
Blue Tattoo, chilling up in Malibu
He got 99 Bananas, but he's not my boo

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me

[Verse 2: M.I.A]
When I met Seagrams, he sent Chivas down my spine
Got me on the dance floor and we start to wine
His ex Sambuca, she just a hookah
I put it on a chilla, but I want Tequila

[Interlude]
I got you off your fucking face
I tell you what to do you want your mother, your something-or-other
I got you off your fucking face
You wound up in another place your brother, you fucking nutter

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
It's going d-d-d-d-d-d-d-down
Everything slow-mo in the background
When I pull it, pull it, p-p-pull it, pull it
Yeah it's sticky and I get it by the pound
Hey-o, Maya, your shit is on fire
Real talk, yuh nuh know seh man a liar
That's why I never ever take 'em to my mattress
I tell 'em "meet me in the sky, yeah that's my address"
I said I got this bad bitch Margarite
And when I see her I say "si, se√±orita!"
Okay, she make me feel like I love, love
I'm like BRRRRRRR, yo, I'm fucked up!

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me

[Outro: M.I.A.]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
Eh, whatcha say?
Eh, whatcha say?
Eh, whatcha say?
Eh, whatcha say?
