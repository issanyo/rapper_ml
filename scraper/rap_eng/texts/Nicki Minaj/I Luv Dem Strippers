[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Let's play big bank take little bank
You are looking at a shark in a fish tank
When I'm in the kitchen, I make plenty cash
Tell shawty come here, she got plenty ass

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
First I pack back, Louie backpack
Where's Paris Hilton? Where's Kat Stacks?
I'm Rambo with this ammunition, my camo come from Tru Religion
Them broke hoes can't pay attention
Your cutie missing, New Edition
Mr. Telephone man, there's something wrong with my line
When I call my baby's number, I get a click every time
Every line is dope, you can snort it
Working in the pot, I can make you do aerobics
I'm haterphobic, they mad cause I'm winning
They busy high and catching, mad cause I'm pinching
All my bitches different, all my diamonds glistening
My weed so loud, everybody listen
They say it's for the birds, so I bought a kilo
My Boost Mobile chirping, it must be my amigo

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
2 Chainz, you fucking crazy, motherfuckers know I'm fucking crazy
Fuck wrong with these bitches lately?
Bitches better get on they knees and praise me
Bitch, I rep that rich gang, Where's Stunna? Where's Wayne?
That's red on my wristband, SB, Mack Maine
Tell Tyga, lookin' for this bitch called Blac Chyna
Take a nigga bitch in a hot flash, menopause hot flash
Yes that's why I'm crowned queen, and I ain't lookin' for the prom king
These hoes' careers ain't promising, killing these bitches -- crime scene
Oooh that's how a bitch do it
Fifty black trucks gonna follow when I pull up
This shit hit you in the chin like a pull up
My door so cocky, my door so stuck up
Oooh hop up out the space car
Bitches stay pressed, I call them a space bar
Man I wish a bitch would, hundred-thousand dollar engine, I wish a bitch could

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Wait I don't even think these niggas understood what the fuck I just said
I said, hundred-thousand dollar engine
I wish a bitch could, like the little engine that could
2 Chainz!
