[Verse 1]
(RedOne...)
Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
Bad - like me is hard to come by
The patron own, let's go get it on
The zone own, yes I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'mma blow off my money and don't give two -

[Pre-Hook]
I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more, 'til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

[Hook]
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Hands up...
(We're higher than a -er) [x3]

[Verse 2]
Jump in my hoopty-hoopty-hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month
I owe that
But check who you want, and check who you like
Dance all night there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

[Bridge]
Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money cause they pay pay pay
And if you're a G, you a G-G-G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

[Pre-Hook]
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

[Hook x2]
