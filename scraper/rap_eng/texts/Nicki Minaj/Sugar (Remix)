Let's go

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I got them Now & Laters and them Jolly Ranchers, too
It ain't a question, but I got the answers, too
These shoes is Cavalli, and the pants is, too
When I see him, I'mma strip like the dancers do
I'mma show them how to do it like the pamphlets do
Show these girls how to do it off campus too
Yo, as long as you know he got the baddest, I'm flattered
I'm the only one that he answers to
And if you need it, then I'mma put it on ya
Ain't nothin' sweeter, you want this sugar, don't ya?
Up, down, inside, water park it, slip slide
Would'a, could'a, should'a got ya sugar, get ya sugar

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Oh baby
Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
Cause girl you're hotter than the Southern California Bay
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No make-up on, that's my sugar

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
