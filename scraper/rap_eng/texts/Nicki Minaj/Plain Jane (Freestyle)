Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

I got gold on my chains, I'm the latest, up-to-date
Got a crown on my head, man these bitches can't complain!
Why you staring? Why you staring? Why these bitches keep staring?
I know my rings are really blingy, I'm not sorry if it's glaring

My bitch be taking off, she ain't Tay-K, got no race
And she got to fuck the beat, if she wanna beat the case
Who you thought I was? Motherfucking Nicki?
Well you're lucky if i'm clingy cus' you'll probably catch a hickey

Where they at? Where they at? Where my bitchy haters at?
Cus' if they come up on my block, their fathers fuck them in the ass
All you bitches is my sons, should've scrapped you as a fetus;
And my wrist real icy, you can't cop one or two!

Ride with Makkalz!
All my bitches is Hermosa!
Yellin' "Viva Puerto Rico!"
Catch a pussy in your Boca
She think he want some chocha
Now they taking up his coca
Now she balling like she sosa
In a Lamborghini rosa!
