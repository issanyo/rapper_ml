[Intro: Nicki Minaj & Young Thug]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Somebody called for the queen?
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh
Thugger (rrrrr)
Mmm, ayy

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (do-do)
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
You gotta picture me rollin'
Pacific ice, I'm an ocean (ocean)
Ready for war like I'm Russia (Russia)
Latest Chanel for the luggage (luggage)
My diamonds they tusslin' (they tusslin')
My neck and my belly on 'Tussin ('tuss)
They callin' for me and they rushin' (rushin')
You wanna be like me and I love it (yeah)
Hundred racks on my draws (yeah)
Big racks, better calm down (yeah)
If you're gon' ride, come around (yeah)
Whole squad smokin' out the pound (yeah)
Squad goals on these hoes (yeah)
Maison Margiela my toes (yeah)
Farrakhan glasses for the chosen (yeah)
You can go and get mad (gon' get mad)
Jumpin' in the Bent' with the too-dark tint
And who's you? (Who's you?)
My shawty pullin' up with a real bad bitch
I wanna fuck you too (fuck you too)
Drippin' my swag, Dubai tags, I'm new
I got a Smith & in the bag now
I get all type of cash, I'm a general, tru (hey)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (do-do)
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
You gotta picture me rollin', packin' a semi (wait) colon
Ready for war like Korea, headlining shows out in Poland
You should be cleanin' my mansion, my place is disgustin'
Why don't you act like a Hoffman, and go get to dustin'?
Yeah, latex on my trouse, bitch, go clean my crown
Can't hear my haters from way up here, they don't make a sound
Body goals on these hoes, white paint on my toes
When I send that new bae alert, niggas gon' be mad
Jumpin' in the Bent', then I switched to the Ghost like, "Who's you?"
Remember this face 'cause I'm that bitch you gon' lose to
Drippin' in ice, fuck you lookin' at? Screw you
It's squad goals when all your bitches pretty like New New

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (do-do)
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'

[Single Version Outro: Young Thug]
Jumpin' in the Bent' with the too-dark tint
And who's you? (Who's you?)
My shawty pullin' up with a real bad bitch
I wanna fuck you too (fuck you too)
Drippin' my swag, ooh, pop tag, I'm (Mmhhm)
I got a Smith & in the bag now
I get all type of cash, I'm a general, tru (hey)
