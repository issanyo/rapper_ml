[Chorus: Da Illest]
You say that we maybe “the one”
We love hard and fight like we’re done
But you know how to make me feel (you know how to make me feel)
Can’t lose you, this thing ain’t no lie
While you mine,  forever will try
But you know hot to make me feel

[Verse 1: Da Illest]
She know how to make me feel
Baby I know its real
I just want to see if you can pop that
Like the way she drop it low
Lemme see you really go
I just wanna to see if can ?  that
Its hard to see a girl do what you do
Your ex man keep calling, tell him you trough
Why the fuck he keep hating ? I see that he hating
And you can tell that I’m just keep on waiting on you

[Chorus: Da Illest]
You say that we maybe “the one”
We love hard and fight like we’re done
But you know how to make me feel (you know how to make me feel)
Can’t lose you, this thing ain’t no lie
While you mine,  forever will try
But you know hot to make me feel

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
You know how, you know how
Bad btches taught ya, taught ya
You know how
Bad bitches taught ya, you know how
You know how, yeah, cause I done taught you, nigga
Fuck around and I might deport you with her
Last time you started fronting I fought you, nigga
Next time, I’mma pull out and torch you with her
Of course you with her in the Porsche, you with her
Fuck I look like, nigga? Of course you bitter
Cause you know how I put it on, you know how I do it long
Ride it like a unicorn, school girl uniform
Ass clap, not Ass cap
But I got him writing songs for my ass, clap
Pussy pop, pat-pat
It don’t get no bigger, it’s at its max fat
We love hard, we fight like we done
Get my gun, that bitch better run
But I’m cooking up and it’s deep fried
With my G-string in your G5
It’s blood gang, I’m a G, five

[Chorus: Da Illest]
You say that we maybe the one
We love hard and fight like we’re done
But you know how to make me feel
Can’t lose you, this thing ain’t no lie
While you mine, forever will try
But you know hot to make me feel
