[Intro: Jeffree Star]
S-T-A-R
Eh-eh-S-T-A-R (What?)
S-T-A-R
Jeffree Star, Nicki Minaj (Queen bitch)
S-T-A-R

[Verse 1: Jeffree Star]
I'm on the top, there's no luck
Never turned around to stop
Make my move, make you move
Make you wanna hear me talk
See me walk, see me fuck
See me suck a lollipop *sucking noise*
Aha, mmm, wanna get messy? (S-T-A-R)
I'll make you hot, make you rock
I'll leave the world in shock
I'm a tease, I'm your fuel (S-T-A-R)
I just wanna see you drool on your knees, pretty please
You wish you were my main squeeze
L-l-like luxury

[Chorus: Jeffree Star]
Fuck me, I'm a celebrity
Can't take your eyes off me
I'll make you fuck me just to get somewhere
Fuck me, I'm a celebrity
Can't take your hands off me
I know you wanna suck me what you waiting for?
Lip gloss and lollipop
Let's rock, I wanna pop
Can't take your eyes off me
I'm all that you can see
Lip gloss and lollipop
I'll make your booty drop
Can't take your eyes off me
I'm know you wanna be

[Verse 2: Jeffree Star]
Mmm, hot damn, here I come
Tell me how you want it done
At the mall, in the hall
On your mama's bedroom wall
You can choose, either way
You will end up on the news
(Ha, yeah, just like you wanted right?)
Do I make you wet?
It's all about the C-U-N-T
(I wanna hear you say)
Love my pink knife
You wish you had a slice of me
I'm a celebrity

[Chorus: Jeffree Star]
Fuck me, I'm a celebrity
Can't take your eyes off me
I'll make you fuck me just to get somewhere
Fuck me, I'm a celebrity
Can't take your hands off me
I know you wanna suck me, what you waiting for?
Lip gloss and lollipop
Let's rock, I wanna pop
Can't take your eyes off me
I'm all that you can see
Lip gloss and lollipop
I'll make your booty drop
Can't take your eyes off me
I'm know you wanna be

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I'm a super superstar on Hollywood Boulevard (Hey)
And I can make all of the boys come to my yard (Yo)
You see, Jeffree, I can show you how to do it (Watch)
Make, make a lollipop squirt, squirt a lot of fluid (Haha)
My lip gloss, lip gloss
Me and all my sick thoughts
I'm such a bad bitch, I get me pissed off
I'm really hot, really pretty
I'm into licking pop, lollipops 'til it's sticky
I can make 'em say Nicki
I'm a celebrity

[Chorus: Jeffree Star]
Lip gloss and lollipop
Let's rock, I wanna pop
Can't take your eyes off me
I'm all that you can see
Lip gloss and lollipop
I'll make your booty drop
Can't take your eyes off me
I'm everything you wanna be
