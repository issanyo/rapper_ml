Yo, Mariah
I was in them million dollar meetings
He was cheatin'
All up in the church
He was sneakin' with the deacon
Cats away, while the mice will play
Lol smiley face
Have a nice a day
Cause pop-pop-pop it goes my rubberband
So stop-stop-stop sa-niffin' that contraband
Cause you was penny pinchin'
My accounts laced
ATTENTION... up out face!

2nd Verse[Nicki Minaj:]
Stylin' on them
Big B's brought the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the Penthouse
Cop doze and we break like tacos

Roscoe's on his knees with a snot nose
They be like she next
Kawasaki T-Rex
Give him some kleenex
Match his little V-necks
Oh, that's what he left
Let his momma pick it up
Might back up on 'em
Vroom-vroom, with the pickup truck
That blue and yellow
Yeah that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave 'em
Hit him with that Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up
Like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like M&M's in a yellow bag
