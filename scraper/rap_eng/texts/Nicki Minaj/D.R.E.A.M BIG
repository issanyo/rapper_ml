[Verse 1:Nicki Minaj]
Chimpanzee's is hatin', but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side
Told you they'd revive your career but somebody lied
I ain't talking poultry when I say this chicken's fried

Anyway Britney, why they so jealous that you teamed up with' me?
Tell 'em they my son, yup, gyal 'em a mi pickney
Anyway, burned Breadale'
What's that? I know boyfriend Fatale

Sniff, sniff, cries, I done slayed your whole entire ******* life
Oh oh, you got some Epsom Salt
I done balled all day you ain't touched the court

What? What you tired? You need a break? You was hot when? Ricki Lake!

In the studio right now I have to get big
Now me and Nicki had something for a fig
Cuz I dream big

(Verse 2: Yamine)
Get ,get,get,get,get up
You don’t have time for laziness
You need to dream up
You can also use that lean and that syrup
Even though it’s for the party you just gotta get it up
Yeah

Got three shows and they excesses
Got 1 show to film right now and the money come out on the exits
I done went through too much in the past
I hope to got that this stuff last
Even though it is impossible to get out of
But I Dream Big so I get out fast

Everybody know what I do for a living
Making lyrics dreaming big making a couple listen
Everybody know what Yamine do with a list and
Make a couple watches and a couple cash
Even though it all don't last
Cuz I got somewhere to go
And this freaky stuff on my show
Everybody know J's on my feet is the new thang
New gang, money bang, gold grillz is the new plane
Everybody know what Yamine do for my team
