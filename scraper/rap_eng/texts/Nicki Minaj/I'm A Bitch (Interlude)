[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
Is that wrong? For wanting more for myself?
Wanting people to treat me with respect?
But you know what? Next time they know better
But I had accepted the pickle juice, I would be drinking pickle juice right now

When I am assertive, I’m a bitch
When a man is assertive, he’s a boss. (He bossed up.)
He bossed up!
No negative connotation behind "bossed up."
But lots of negative connotation behind being a bitch!
