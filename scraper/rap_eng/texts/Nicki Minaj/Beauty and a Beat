[Verse 1: Alex Goot]
Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off (eh, eh, eh)
What you got, a billion could've never bought (oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza (Both)]
We're gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

[Chorus: Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza (Both)]
Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete (complete)
It's all about you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
Yeah

[Verse 2: Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza (Both)]
Body rock, I wanna see your body rock (eh, eh, eh)
Take a bow, you're on the hottest ticket now, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza (Both)]
We're gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

[Chorus: Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza (Both)]
Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete (complete)
It's all about you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do

[Bridge: Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza (Both)]
Body rock, I wanna see your body rock
Body rock, I wanna see your body rock

[Chorus: Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza (Both)]
Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all about you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
