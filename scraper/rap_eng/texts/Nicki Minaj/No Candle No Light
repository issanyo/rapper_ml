[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Young Money

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj & ZAYN]
Hand on your hand
Chest on your chest
Tangled in bed
But I'm feeling you less
You know my love ain't free
Why do you make believe?
Why do you sell me dreams?
SMS in the morning light
We gotta, we gotta, we gotta face it
The fire, the fire ain't no longer blazin'

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Nicki Minaj]
I, I woke up on the wrong side of ya
You don't even know that I left, do ya?
Can't handle my love
Can't handle your lies
No friend zone to my love
Quit burning all of my time
I, I woke up on the wrong side of ya

[Chorus: ZAYN & Nicki Minaj]
No candle, no light for you
No candle, no light for you
No candle, no light for you

[Verse 2: ZAYN & Nicki Minaj]
I can't do it, no baby, I can't do it
I only end up losing, ooh we're really fooling this
Agree to disagree, some things aren't meant to be
But I wanted you and me
SMS in the morning light
We gotta, we gotta, we gotta face it
The fire, the fire ain't no longer blazin'

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Nicki Minaj]
I, I woke up on the wrong side of ya
You don't even know that I left, do ya?
Can't handle my love
Can't handle your lies
No friend zone to my love
Quit burning all of my time
I, I woke up on the wrong side of ya

[Chorus: ZAYN & Nicki Minaj]
No candle, no light for you
No candle, no light for you
No candle, no light for you

[Bridge: ZAYN & Nicki Minaj]
We gotta, we gotta, we gotta face it
The fire, the fire ain't no longer blazin'

[Chorus: ZAYN & Nicki Minaj]
No candle, no light for you
No candle, no light for you
No candle, no light for you

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Switch up the lane, switch up the lane
Watch how ya gyal just switch up her lane
This one here, it ah Nicki and ZAYN, ZAYN, seen?
