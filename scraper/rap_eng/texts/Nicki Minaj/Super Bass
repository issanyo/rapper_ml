[Verse 1]
This one is for the girls with the booming system
Top down, AC with the cooling system
When she come up in the club, she be blazin' up
Got stacks on deck like she savin' up
And she ill, she real, she might got a deal
She pop bottles and she got the right kind of build
She cold, she dope, she might drink coke
She always in the air, but she never fly coach
She a motherfucking trip, trip, sailor of the ship, ship
When she make it drip, drip kiss her on the lip, lip
That's the kind of girl I was lookin' for
And yes you'll get smacked if you're lookin' ho

I said, excuse me, you're a hell of a dime
I mean my, my, my, you're like pelican fly
I mean, you're so shy and I'm loving your smile
You're like slicker than the guy with the thing on his eye, oh
Yes I did, yes I did, somebody please tell him who the F we is
We are T.D.F., we mack them chicks up, back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up

[Chorus]
Girl you got my heartbeat runnin' away
It's beating like a drum and it's coming your way
Can't you hear that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
She got that super bass
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
Yeah that super bass
(Bah, bah, bah, bah.. Bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah.. Bah, bah, bah)
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass, she got that super bass
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass, yeah that super bass

[Verse 2]
This one is for the girls in the polos
Entrepreneur chicks in the nolos
She could ball with the crew, she could solo
But I think I like her better when she dolo
And I think I like her better with that fitted dress on
She ain't even gotta try to put the mac on
She just gotta give me that look, when she give me that look
Then the pants comin' off, off, uh

Excuse me, you're a hell of a girl, you know I really got a thing for American girls
I mean, sigh, sick in the eye, I can tell that you're in touch with your feminine side
Yes I did, yes I did, somebody please tell 'em who the F we is
We are T.D.F., we mack the chicks up, back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up

[Chorus]
Girl, you got my heartbeat runnin' away
Beating like a drum and it's coming your way
Can't you hear that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
She got that super bass
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
Yeah that super bass
(Bah, bah, bah, bah.. Bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah.. Bah, bah, bah)
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
She got that super bass
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
Yeah that super bass

[Bridge]
See I need you in my life for me to stay
No, no, no, no, no I know you'll stay
No, no, no, no, no don't go away
Girl, you got my heartbeat runnin' away
Don't you feel my heartbeat comin' your way
It be like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
It be like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass

[Chorus]
Girl you got my heartbeat runnin' away
It's beating like a drum and it's coming your way
Can't you hear that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
She got that super bass
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
Yeah that super bass
(Bah, bah, bah, bah.. Bah, bah, bah

Can't you hear that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bass
She got that super bass
