I ain't the lady to mess with!
Woo!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go ,go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go ,go....

[Hook]
Go ahead with your bad self
With your bad self
With your bad self
Yo!

I'm a girl with my bad self
With my bad self
With my bad self
Ah

Go ahead with your bad self
With your bad self
With your bad self
Yo!

I'm a girl with my bad self
With my bad self
With my bad self
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I ain't the lady to mess with, stressed with
You're gonna pay the price to, caress
Stop it with anorexic pockets
Give me the microphone to show them off how we rock this
I've got the keys to the gate like a locksmith
And hoes, I don't even care if she's topless
Lies for lies, give the thing that makes me blast
For me the remedy, so me kick that give me the blast

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, okay, let's play
Got to pay the play that will do it my way (my way)
No way, no way Jose
Stop watcha doing cause you can't hold me
Just give it tome, give it to me, give it to me, to me, to me
I'll make them worry about them when they rocking it with me
Yo, yo, let's go, let's go
I'm a play fools like tic-tac-toe
Ah too many rules, too many lives unspoken
Glass broke and I'm gonna stop your choking
Y'all can't get the best of me
I take y'all outside, keep testing me (ah)
That's right I'm gonna take what's mine
So hurry up, cause your running out of time
