[Intro: Big Mike]
Big Mike, the new baddest bitch in the game
She go by the name of Nicki Minaj
Let's get this shit poppin', playtime is over motherfuckers

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
This the one they was waitin' on, baby...
I had to do it

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Just when they thought it was safe to play - I
Hit'em with the N.I.C to K.I
I'm Tinkerbell, he's Peter Pay-ai
To these rap bitches, I'm Mother May I
I wanna know why you waste your ti- I'm
On these rap hoes, that don't write they rhy- I'm
Get a can of Sprite, with a twist of lime
Money, money, money always on my mind
Coupe color purple, no I'm not Celie (Sil-lay)
We run New York, like we play relay
My flight took off, yours has been delayed
Give it to them early bitches, so don't be late
Playtime is over, when I spit bars
My mixtape, bring all the boys to the yard
All the boys want Nicki, all the boys want mine
All the boys say they love me, yeah, they love me long time
Yes, I'm the girl that they heard of, I commit murder
I body bitches, I don't need a burner
Queens, oh yes, I rep Queens
Little white tee, plus some tight jeans
I make it hard for these chicks to breathe
Wrist on freeze, I freeze up my sleeves
We gettin' money, like it grow on trees
Stay on my Qs, I stay on my Ps
After I'm done, then you will acknowledge
I'm the president, never went to college
I'm a bad bitch, I don't need no stylist
Tell a bitch, hollas when she get my dollas
Bitches talk shit, but what is you sayin'?
Got the illest dude in the game, speakin my name
I'm the one, I'm the one, you heard me?
Same number they stiched on McGrady jersey
If I show you how to do it, will you reimburse me?
Let me put on my pumps, let me grab my skirtsy
I am such a little lady, let me do my curtsi
Fuck a dry pussy bitch, cause I know she thirsty
