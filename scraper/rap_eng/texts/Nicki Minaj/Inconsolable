Memories frozen in a picture frame
Days go on things will never be the same, anymore
Thoughts of you and the life we never lived
How can I pull through, when you left to soon

I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t move on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you hear me, I am inconsolable

I wish I’d know you better, time was running out
The quilt I left is more than I can describe
And I keep on calling your name to feel that I’m alive
In this empty space, I could never be replaced

I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t move on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you see me, when I am inconsolable

Everyday I try to carry on, everyday I try to find a meaning
Living in a place where I belong, as cold ice can be
If I could take you back to yesterday
But not for ever gone it’s in considerable
It almost that acceptable

Memories frozen in a picture frame
How can I pull through, when you left to soon

I can’t go on, pretending everything could be the way we where
How can you see me, when I’m inconsolable

A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t go on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you see me, when I am inconsolable
