[Intro]
Ayy, okay, ayy
Skrrt skrrt, okay, yuh
I count the blue money all, and it's 13,89 and ten
Hurry up, my money got that rich ass Gen
Niggas sayin' I'm at Goodwill, but I'm still at Walmart
These niggas broke as fuck, Lord knows haters can't park

[Verse]
For those niggas, they won't ever think
I'm gettin' on that hoe, she be suckin' on my dick
Your bitch at my house, she said "I'm here"
Nigga don't wan' battle me, 'cause they scared of bein' here
These hoes white as fuck, them noses pointy as a pencil
I would never date a white bitch, cause she have them dimples
Everybody wanna be like me, 'cause they're don't have the superflyness
This is my town, I'm Young Misty the nigga who never been messed with
Fuck the cops, I don't fuck with the haters or hoes
Dream together, and you gon' maybe know
These niggas don't wan' my thing, cause they really be sorry
Shut the fuck up, nigga, man, y'all go on stage and just copy
Your bitch said to me "Be here by seven"
Probably 'cause she loves me, I stole her from you, by a second
My niggas gettin' lit, with them litty ass raps, G
Shoutout to Nicki Minaj, man you know she is a queen, ayy

[Outro]
Gang gang gang gang gang
Nigga, gang ayy gang ayy gang
Ayy, ayy ayy, gang gang gang
Yuh, ayy gang ayy gang ayy gang
