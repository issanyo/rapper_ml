[Intro: LMFAO]
Party, pa-party rock
Party, pa-party rock

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Don't play the stupid game
Because I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You have got to step into my world

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Hook]
L-U-V Madonna
Y-O-U you want to
L-U-V Madonna
Y-O-U you want to

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Give me all your love boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
Because it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
I'm roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dosing
Now move, I'm going in

[Verse 3: LMFAO]
Yo, I'm going in
Take it to the max and go again
My slogan
I'm sexy and I know it
Show it, baby girl it's your moment
Work it, work it, own it
Gimme your love until going in

[Verse 4: Madona]
Don't play the stupid game
Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love

[Hook]
L-U-V Madonna
Y-O-U you want to
L-U-V Madonna
Y-O-U you want to

[Verse 5: LMFAO]
Hold up!
Baby girl your man look tall up
Should be with me because I'm swole up
Knock it up the park, I'm home run
Yea your money, I'm on one
I really can't be without your love
Girl kill me!

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Hook]
L-U-V Madonna
Y-O-U you want to
L-U-V Madonna
Y-O-U you want to
