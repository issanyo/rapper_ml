[Verse 1]
I used to know this dude, pretty lou' out in LA
Said when I’m in LA, to hit up his cell-ay
Cause he got something nice he wanna put in my belly
He wanna bump and grind sorta like R. Kelly
See money ain’t a thang, 'cause my doe is like woah
Pull out my bank roll on a nigga like "yo!"
Let’s make some videos, get the Benny Boom crew
I’m hoppin out the Rov in my Jimmy Choo shoe
I’m the boss bitch, you know I like to talk shit
I’m heavy in the streets, so you gon’ need a forklift
And, daddy, lemme cum in your mouth like the dentist
I’m not the apprentice, don’t finish your sentence

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, we ain’t gotta talk, we could bone
Soon as we all alone
Then, baby, I’ma get you in the zone
‘Cause you think we’re all the same
But you’re wrong
Just get me some patron
And, baby, I’ma get you in the zone

[Chorus]
Zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin'
Baby, I’m about to have you
Zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin'
Z-z-z-z-zone, have ya' zonin'
(Zone, zone, zone)
Zonin', I’ma have ya' zonin
(Zone, zone, zone)
Zonin', yeah

[Verse 2]
Boom like talibani
I got some real nice pum-pum nani-nani-nani
Just let me take off my Dolce Gabbani-bani
Than I can be your little Playboy bunny-bunny
See you know what I mean we could sip a lil (weed)
Sweatin', heavy breathin', I can tell that you fiendin'
See you’re already thinkin that you must be dreamin
Get them strawberries, bring another whipped cream in
Lemme get ya' cup of patron
I’ma get ya in the zone
I don’t let the microphone hypnotize me no more
Listen, daddy, let me jump on
I’ma keep my pumps on
You know it come wrong
Plus, my something dumb long

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, we ain’t gotta talk, we could bone
Soon as we all alone
Then, baby, I’ma get you in the zone
‘Cause you think we’re all the same
But you’re wrong
Just get me some patron
And, baby, I’ma get you in the zone

[Chorus]
Zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin'
Baby, I’m about to have you
Zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin', zonin'
Z-z-z-z-zone, have ya' zonin'
(Zone, zone, zone)
Zonin', I’ma have ya' zonin
(Zone, zone, zone)
Zonin', yeah

HA!
