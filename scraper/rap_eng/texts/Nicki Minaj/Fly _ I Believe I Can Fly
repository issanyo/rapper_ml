Rachel:
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

Rachel with New Directions Girls (Santana):
To fly
To fly (Uh, yo, yo)

Artie:
I used to think that I could not go on

Santana:
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

Artie:
And life was nothing but an awful song

Santana (New Directions Boys):
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me (If I can see it)

Blaine (New Directions Boys):
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends (Then I can do it)
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood (If I just believe it)
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising (There's nothing to it)

Blaine and Santana:
I win, thrive, soar
Higher, higher, higher
More fire

Rachel and Santana (Rachel):
(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

Finn with New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky

Artie:
See, I was on the verge of breaking down

Santana:
Paint they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins

Artie:
Sometimes silence can seem so loud

Santana (New Directions Boys):
I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined (If I can see it)

Blaine (New Directions Boys):
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near (Then I can do it)
See we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfickle time to spare (If I just believe it)
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me (There's nothing to it)

Blaine and Santana:
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

Rachel and Santana (Rachel):
(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

Finn with New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):
I believe I can fly (Fly) (Mercedes: Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky (Mercedes: Ooh-ooh, uh, yeah)
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky (Mercedes: Fly)

Finn (Mercedes):
I believe I can fly (Fly)

Artie (Rachel with New Directions Girls):
(Get ready for it, get ready for it) Then I can be it
(Get ready for it, I came to win) If I just believe it
(Get ready for it, get ready for it) There's nothing to it

Mercedes with New Directions Girls:
Get ready for it

Artie and New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):
I believe I can fly (Fly) (Mercedes: Ooh-ooh)

Finn and New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):
I believe I can touch the sky (Mercedes: Fly)
I think about it every night and day (Fly) (Mercedes: Oh)
Spread my wings and fly away (Mercedes: Ooh, whoa)

Artie with New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):

Artie with New Directions Boys (and Girls):
I believe I can (fly)
