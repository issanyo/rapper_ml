[Intro]
Yeah Uh
Change yea
What you're thinking
Can I change your mind
Second to none, in crowd
It's how we do it, yea
Nicki Maraj

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ah, sh** I got this whips is topless
Yall couldn't see me looking through binoculars
Look second to none all we do is drop hits
Six to six flow so I roll with dodges
And I'm in the club, everybody wanna dub
Sip a little bub and I probably wit a thug
Play hard to get, but I'm thinking bout it
So you whisper in my ear, what you thinking shawty?

[Verse 2: Lenny Harold]
Hey, tryna' do with you cause shawty cause I deal with you
You keep me inside of those try to guess what to do next
Should I stay or should I go
Is difficult to love ya
When you don't know what you want
And you're left with decisions while I got cloudy visions
You know

[Chorus]x2
Shawty, what you're thinking?
You know
What got you thinking, let go
I know that you know, you want this love
You know that I know
You're thinking, oh

[Verse 3: Lenny Harold]
Hey, it's burning me up, just wanna get close to ya
And you're playing games with this attraction
Shawty I got a it bad it's pathetic
Oh, I just wanna understand, you're leading me for a reason
You know
I see it in your eyes thinking on the same line
So come and take it baby

[Chorus]x2

[Verse 4: Lenny Harold]
You got me thinking
Why is it so hard for you to make your move?
Make your move
Shawty make your move
When it's what you want, girl
So why you're running from your feelings
When you know how to handle it, yeah?

[Bridge: Lenny Harold]
You know baby, you gotta follow your heart
Not your mind, you feel me
Na, na, nana no, na, nana, na, na, nana na
Na, na, nana no, na, nana, na, na, nana na

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Stupid Wit It
Louis Vuitton fitted
P Buitton kitted, fluck the critics
Im so funny wit it, im just dummy wit it
See I already did it, tell her to come and get it
Who got a setup like N-Maraj everybody wanna get up
In my entourage, at this stage in the game im in the range
With change, dont fuck with lames that's my claim to fame, nigga

[Chorus]x4
