[Nicki Minaj:]
I got a fresh line up, a nigga tied up, bout to have this
Nigga face on smash, cause I gotta little bad bitch on stash
In the back, got one wet tongue in my ass

[Hook:]
I'm the biggest freak that he seen thus far
I'm the-I'm the biggest freak that he see thus far
I'm the biggest freak that he seen thus far
Cause it's just another day in the life gettin my salad tossed

[Verse 1:]
(Uhn) I'm the biggest freak, that he seen thus far
(Chea) Got the fattest box, white tees, no bra
Call them other bitches, for the hugs and the kisses (okay)
When I come (cum) around, it's going down like bitches, (oh)
Tell the dope boys, come holla at my crew
Deep throat 'em, make 'em say, "Yabadabadoo!"
Rockin' door knockers, middle finger to the coppers
"Pussy poppin' on my popper ha ha ha ha you can't stop her" (C3)
I'm the reason, why these bitches tryna get cute
Only rap bitch, pussy taste like fruit
Back to the thuggin', now we sippin' sizzurp
Pour it down my ass, let 'em drink it 'til he bizzurp
Sex game colder, then an ice cold blizzard
I'm about the color of the Geico lizard
I'm the biggest freak, that he seen thus far
Nic-Nicki Lewinski, Pinky with the bar
