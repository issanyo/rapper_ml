[Intro: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
Eyes haven't seen
And ears haven't heard
The kind of blessings
The kind of blessings
That's about to fall on me, woah
'Cause victory is here
Kicked defeat out the door
God's doing a new thing, yeah
Get ready for overflow

[Chorus 1: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
'Cause I'm getting ready
(I'm getting ready to see)
Something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)
Prophesy over your life saying
(I'm getting ready to see)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ohh
Something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)
Saying I'm getting ready oh-oh-oh, ohh
(I'm getting ready to see)
Something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)
Say it again, I'm getting ready!
(I'm getting ready to see)
Something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)

[Verse 1: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
Let's say it together
Say eyes haven't seen, no-o-o

Come on say it, and ears haven't heard

Get ready (Get ready for overflow)

[Chorus 2: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
Now throw your hands up y'all
Saying I'm getting ready

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, aye yo
Beach house vibes maneuver the jet ski
'Cause-'cause I serve a God that parted the red sea
Multi-million dollars commercials for Pepsi
From food-stamps to more ice than Gretzky
I don't gotta talk the Lord defends me
I watch them all fall for going against me
'Cause me and all my angels shot the devil up
While you was trying to pull me down I levelled up
I levelled up twice, I levelled up three times
He tapped 'em and told 'em "she's mine"
So even when I cried I knew I'd be fine
Prepared for a miracle blessing in these times
Now praise Him, raise 'em, name it, claim it
Every tongue that rises up against me, shame it
I breathe success in and out my lungs
I got the power of life and death coming out my tongue

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh

[Bridge: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
Say, I'm getting ready (I'm getting ready)
Ready for overflow (Ready for overflow)
It's real easy, somebody declare it
Say, I'm getting ready (I'm getting ready)
What are you ready for? (Ready for overflow)
Say it again, say I'm getting ready (I'm getting ready)
Ready for overflow (Ready for overflow)
It's about to be running over in my life, yeah (I'm getting ready)
Ready for overflow (Ready for overflow)
Say, oh, I'm ready (Oh, I'm ready)
Are you ready for overflow? (Ready for overflow)
Say, yes, I'm ready (Yes, I'm ready)
Ready for overflow (ready for overflow)
Say, ready for overflow, ooh-oh-ooh (Ready for overflow)
You are ought to declare it over your family
Say, ready for overflow (Ready for overflow)
Declare it over your finances
Say, ready for overflow (Ready for overflow)
Healing in my body, I'm ready (Ready for overflow)
I'm in the right position, I'm ready (Ready for overflow)
I'm gonna stay here at Your feet because I'm ready (Ready for overflow)
I'm ready (Ready for overflow)
Oh-ohh, yes, I'm ready (Ready for overflow)
I'll say it again, I'm still ready (Ready for overflow)
Oh, yes, I'm ready (Ready for overflow)
God, You can blow my mind, I'm ready (Ready for overflow)
Lord, You can blow my mind, I'm ready (Ready for overflow)

[Chorus 3: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
Sing, I'm getting ready (I'm getting ready)
Ready for overflow (Ready for overflow)
Say, I'm getting ready (I'm getting ready)
Ready for overflow (Ready for overflow)
Say, yes, I'm ready (Yes, I'm ready)

[Outro: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
God, You can blow my mind
'Cause eyes haven't seen
Ears haven't heard
The kind of blessings
The kind of blessings
That's about to follow me
'Cause victory is here
It put defeat at the door
God's doing a new thing
A brand new thing
I'm ready for overflow
God's doing a new thing
Get ready for overflow
Yea, I'm talking to you, I'm talking to you
God's doing a new thing
Get ready for overflow
You've been waiting
You've been praying
You've been pressing
You've been fasting
God's doing a new thing
Get ready for overflow
I'm getting ready to see
Something I've never seen
I'm getting ready to see, oh-oh-ooh
Something I've never seen
