[Intro: Jesse-V ] ayo ant you my nigga so I had to get on the remix hope you ain't mad but this jawn was nice anyway less go..

[Verse 1: Amillion ] Amillion is a monster Italian like a mobster half these rappers flows
Imaginary they belong in fosters ima crazy kid and spittin is what I do if you
Come to close then I might kill you your a fool im the new school and im cold im
Not cool so stop tryna make me mad with your allegations this is my time to
Shine this is my rap nation death is what im facing for resurrecting the game but
When im dead at least everybody will remember my name its A-M-I-L-L-I-O-N burn it
Into your memory make a burn scar on your Brain

[Hook: Amillion ]

Im not the best
Yet but I plan to be and when I am ima break bread with
Everyone thats cool with
Me ima renegade fish in the sea come on nobody wants
A piece of me

Im not the best
Yet but I plan to be and when I am ima break bread with
Everyone thats cool with

[Verse 2: Jesse-V]

I be like I love her
He be like I love her
I be like you should talk to her
He be like you should talk to her
He be like I dont wanna
I be like, me neither

Haa ha haaa im playing listen if you can't fight against me what makes you think you can take my nigga Anthony Even if the sky is falling down like its supposed to be
I gets down low for GC
Down like her appetite cause to me she always so hungry
She cute, beyond beauty
I got that girl from upper darby
Now she my Miss ghetto
Now can I be her bestfriend please
I’m fighting with this girl
On the battlefield of food
Don’t it look like stacy boo sending arrows from above
Don’t you ever leave the phone with me
Indefinitely not probably
And honestly I'm down like 2 degrees When I am on that 24 hour mc Ds diet crying while im gambling I encourage you to fight me dont remind who I owe cause I will start a riot club owners despise me cuz I never buy drinks I am what everybody in my past didn't want me to be guess what bad credit im about to be a stuntman so I can pay these fees come take take a look get a load of this leech quit staring at me and just come around help me push my car cause right now im on E im on my scooby doo and shaggy flow I just check my bank account my new balance is 0 dam where my lights just go you're probably someone that I owe get the shaking something cuz I need to make some extra doe yes I make mistake but I got really good excuses like stealing from my girlfriend and borrowing all my brothers clothes im losing my car I say dam there repo go I fell off like JLO at the award show gaby want money I say dam you lucky I love you though

[Hook: Amillion ]

Im not the best
Yet but I plan to be and when I am ima break bread with
Everyone thats cool with
Me ima renegade fish in the sea come on nobody wants
A piece of me

Im not the best
Yet but I plan to be and when I am ima break bread with
Everyone thats cool with
Me ima renegade fish in the sea come on nobody wants
A piece of me



[Verse 3:Amillion] lets see if u can keep up you got something to say dont talk under

Your
Breath speak up! are you afraid you ain't gotta be fearing me im passive
Just dont put your hands on me or ill spit you up and throw you in the ocean
Lean with it rock with it its like its happening in slow motion cops come to see
Whats all the commotion by the time they get there your already sinking you
Ain't floating here I go ima bout to put on a show to show yall exactly what I
Bet yall dont know true rap ain't about the hoes money and shit its about tellin
A story thats within it a story within a story no guts no glory so stop rappin'
If what you talkin about dont matter its only fueling the fire its only getting
Me madder
