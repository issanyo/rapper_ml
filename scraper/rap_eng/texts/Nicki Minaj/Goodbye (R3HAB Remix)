[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
Oh, it's three in the morning
When you want some, you phone me
One word in Español, babe
And I come and you know (what? Huh)
Girls in Haiti they throw it (throw)
In Jamaica they roll it (roll)
Girls in Spain do the mostest
But only you got my focus

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo & Nicki Minaj]
Girl, I'm down for your lovin'
Down for my fatty, fatty
Down for your lovin'
Down for my naughty, naughty
Down for your lovin'
I'm giving you lovin'
Stay with me 'cause

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj, Willy William and Jason Derulo]
It's time to say goodbye
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Baby, you know that it's time to say goodbye
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Baby you know that it's

[Verse 2: Willy William]
Dame solo un momento
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Que ya no tengo tiempo
Tú y yo una noche de fuego (oui, oui, oui)
Te hablo Francés like (sí, sí, sí)
Te explico que soy de (Ti, Ti, Ti)
Parlez-vous Français (oui, oui, oui)
Síguelo, mami, vale

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo & Nicki Minaj]
Girl, I'm down for your lovin'
Down for my fatty, fatty
Down for your lovin'
Down for my naughty, naughty
Down for your lovin'
I'm giving you lovin'
Stay with me 'cause

[Chorus: All]
It's time to (it's time) say goodbye (hey baby)
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Baby, you know that it's time to say goodbye
(say goodbye, say goodbye)
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Prr, night, night, night, night, oh
Baby, you know that it's

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, tell him seh' it proper and it prim (and it prim)
A mermaid ting and he wanna swim (he wanna swim)
How gal bright suh, but dem eyes dim (dem eyes dim)
Ch-ch-chain heavy, but I'm light skin (I'm light skin)
I pull up on him let him put the pipe in (pipe in)
But then I gotta dash like a hyphen (hyphen)
I bring the cake let him lick the icing (icing)
Some little open toes Stewart Weitzman
Advising, ye-yes this ties in (okay)
No-none of you hoes will ever see my pen
YSL Nicki boot, just to drive in
The way my foot ball, just give me the Heisman!
Touchdown! (Touchdown, touchdown, touch-)

[Chorus: Jason Derulo with Nicki Minaj]
'Cause It's time to say goodbye (yeah)
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night (I need you, baby)
I need you, I need you tonight
Baby, you know that it's-
