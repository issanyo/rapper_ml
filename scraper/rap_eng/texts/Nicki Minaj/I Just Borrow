[Hook: Ru Spits]

I don't got a girl every night, I just borrow
Leave with me and I'll bring you back tomorrow
I'm tryna leave here with America's Top Model
And I ain't got to spit no game I pop bottles

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]

I ain't got a man sometimes I do borrow
Don't care about your cars, your jewels, or your cash (nope)
Make my own ends in a bubblegum Benz
I ain't feeling your style but I'll fuck your friend (whoop!)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Listen play boy, boy
I don't know why you tryna play the girl like a toy, toy
I don't care 'bout your ends what you spend boy
I'm tryna holla at your friend he a ten boy
Look, you see Christian Dior on my tits
I don't care if you spit, I don't care if your name RU Spits
Nicki you still a brew chick
But I rock with ya fella like the S Dot Kidd
Niggas wanna know her but a bitch so cocky
Miss Balboa cause my wrist so rocky
Who gon' top me?
Who gon' stop me?
Nickname should be TV the way they watch me
