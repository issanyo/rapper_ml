[Intro: Rick Ross]
Born stunna
I’m a born stunna
Huh born stunna

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Money, money, money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Born stunna, born stunna
Flip a hundred keys just to ball all summer
Born stunna, born stunna
I put a hundred karats in the Cartier, mama
Born stunna, she’s a born stunna
Mercedes coupe for the missus if she’s a born stunna
Born stunna, born stunna
Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin’

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Born stunna flow
Consistently winning,  while all you bitches come and go
Oh you mad ho? You ain't headlineyou my son bitch, and it’s bedtime
I show you bitches, how to put together punchlines
It ain't working out, it ain't crunch time
Roll a kush up, it’s a chess game, but fuck a push-up
Out in Tokyo, they calling me Nicki-san
Everywhere you go, they calling you Nicki’s son
Coupes and trucks, money bags—Scrooge McDuck

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Money, money, money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Born stunna, born stunna
Flip a hundred keys just to ball all summer
Born stunna, born stunna
I put a hundred karats in the Cartier, mama
Born stunna, she’s a born stunna
Mercedes coupe for the missus if she’s a born stunna
Born stunna, born stunna
Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin’

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yea, a lot a lot of money bags
The money in the garbage can
Strapped up tight with a hundred bags
Money filthy bitch, we in the money lair
See, we shinin’ like the money can
Since the money came, bitch we throw the money thang
Yea, YMCMG
Lauder Jet been a hustla since I hit the streets
2-50 on the new piece
New condo, 20 thousand square feet
Ballin’, uptown suicide
Born stuntin’, strapped how we livin’ fine

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Money, money, money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Born stunna, born stunna
Flip a hundred keys just to ball all summer
Born stunna, born stunna
I put a hundred karats in the Cartier, mama
Born stunna, she’s a born stunna
Mercedes coupe for the missus if she’s a born stunna
Born stunna, born stunna
Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin’

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I don’t know bout these other niggas, but I’m gettin’ Trukfit money
And I ain't never number 2, so you ain't gettin’ shit from me
And you know I’m a ball, so catch me if you can
Blood, I leave a nigga bleeding like that nigga got cramps
I got Molly, got Mary, got white girl, got Keisha
Used to have Trina but I still got nina
Bitch I’m Tuco, I’m too cold
Come put ya neck in my loophole
I’m too hot, I’m soup bowl
My money tall, Manute Bol
I’m high Jupiter, Pluto
But everybody know I’m from Mars
Bitch ass nigga Keep hatin’, gone make me catch another gun charge
I’m on that good good, floating like Aladdin
Born stunna, stuntin’ like my daddy

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Money, money, money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
Born stunna, born stunna
Flip a hundred keys just to ball all summer
Born stunna, born stunna
I put a hundred karats in the Cartier, mama
Born stunna, she’s a born stunna
Mercedes coupe for the missus if she’s a born stunna
Born stunna, born stunna
Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin’
