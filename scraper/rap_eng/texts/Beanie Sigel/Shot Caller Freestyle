Sitting with my pistol, the four pound llama
Strapped onstage at the Summer Jam concert
What you really want from a nigga? I'm a monster
Scratch to the death like the dog Manny onyx
Wack-ass rappers, y'all niggas garbage
YouTube gangstas, y'all niggas blogging
B. Sig a problem, connects out in Compton
Uzi onstage, House of Blues rocking
Hard Knock tour, left a Mac in the closet
That I just snatched on the badmouth Riley
Rock the Mic tour, got booked for a body
Shot out with RAM squad, what's up with Tommy?
Got a whole graveyard, nigga, come try me
Rappers like O-Dog, menace to society
Yeah, I'm like Crowe in the Colosseum
Prolific exterminator of human beings
Look a man in his eyes 'fore I R.I.P. 'im
Kiss a nigga on his cheek 'fore he meet the demons
Glock 27, thirty three in the clip
Louis leather check to hold to hold that bitch on my hip
Gun explodes often, leave yellow caution
Body chalked off with a arm knocked off it
Snitches breaking water, rats having abortions
Fuck law enforcement, my PSI flawless
Niggas taking losses, they don't work the porches
Bosses turn to workers, workers turn to bosses
Broad Street Bully never bitching, still cautious
Still circle the block, dog, before I park it
Ain't shit changed but the gun under the parka
Glock 18, Mag 4 fully auto
Night vision, infrared beam in the dark glow
But you in a hole where the dearly depart go
Glock work while I hawk 'em down
Why run the block when I could walk it down?
See Desert E, fat boy stay ready
Government issue four pound by the belly
Colt 911, hold that chrome bitch steady
Ten up in the clip, put four up in your skelly
Stomp you in those Air Force Ones like Nelly
More stones in the bezel than a Soda Club Pelle
Niggas can't stop my train, I'm Chubb rocking
What's beef? Who ready to die? I'm big popping
I'm hundred proof, you niggas cheap vodka
I'm the lord of the underground, the new chief rocker
