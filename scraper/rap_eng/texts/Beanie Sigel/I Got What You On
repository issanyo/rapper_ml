Yo, yo
Ho, ho
No, no
You don't go
Yo, be, be
Me, me
Can't you see, see
Can't let go cuz I got what you on, girl

Baby, I'm hearing too much in the street
Things aren't at they supposed to be
Kept it between just you and me, baby (go)
Honey, I'm sick and tired of all of this
I think it's time I handled it
Tripping, flipping, get down with, baby (go)
I've got to, a drop-top Benz with the Buggy eye
Thought it was enough to keep it right
I guess it was wrong cuz you out tonight, flossin' (go)
With your girls
Nina, Pam and what's-her-name
Girlfriend, they don't play the same
You don't know
I got what you on, girl

Yo, yo
I never really thought you was a ho, ho
That's not really the way I go, go
Why you wanna play with my dough, dough
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, be, be
Why you wanna be
With me, me
Girl, why can't you see, see
I can't let go cuz I got what you on, girl

Say that something's missin'
Tell me what you missin' (go)
Say that you need to flex, that's all right
But tell me where you was last night (last night, yo)
I'm thinkin'
With too much on your hands
You surely need to cover up, girl, what is it?
The way you spread that, oh girl
Is it like that?
Your actions, two can't really relaxin'
I'm kickin' out the money when you want it (yo)
You steppin' out the Benz with your hair so right (yo)
Skirt so high and so tight
You out gettin' it like a dope fiend
Girl, why can't you just see?
You told me to go
Cuz I've got what you on, girl

Yo, yo
I never really thought you was a ho, ho
That's not really the way I go, go
Why you wanna play with my dough, dough
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, be, be
Why you can't be with me, me
Tell me why can't you see, see
You can't let go cuz I got what you on, girl

[Beanie Siegal]
I keep you properly styled in the latest shit
Pradda, crocodile or gator's shit
Eyes poppin' out the Benz, you now the latest shit
Takin' you and your girlfriends shoppin' at player's shit
Keep a pocket full of dough, save for the stats
Got a big fuckin' crip with a lake in the back
And as yours to the wig, wait, let me take that back
Get outta line, and I'ma take that back
I just cock the six, you don't gotta car hop
I got a cellar full of Cris, you don't gotta bar hop
I got an indoor pool with a divin' board
My crip look like somethin' outta The Rile Report
Laced you, twenty karats, ten in each ear
I can take you places, you ain't been nowhere
It could be gone tomorrow, but it's here today
Cuz I could play towl on 'em and take it all away
You ok?

Yo, yo
I can't believe my eyes your a ho, ho
It's not really the way that I go, go
Why you wanna play with my dough, dough
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, be, be
Why you can't be with me, me
Tell me why can't you see, see
I can't let go cuz I got what you on, girl

Yo, yo
Take it out, ho, ho
It's not the way I love you, no, no
How you take my dough, dough
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, be, be
Why can't you be with me, me
Well, baby, can't you see, see
Can't let go cuz I got what you on, girl

We out
