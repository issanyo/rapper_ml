CHORUS: If you a playa , get it now like a playa
Get it down like a playa , spit a round like a playa
If you a playa , roll an ounce like a playa
Get an ounce like a playa , bounce like a playa
If you a playa , get it now like a playa
Get it down like a playa , spit a round like a playa
If you a playa , get an ounce playa , bounce , playa
Bounce , bounce , bounce

[Beanie Mac]
When I step in the club , bitches know my name
I don't do alotta talkin bitches know my game
Don't gotta buy alotta drinks bitches know my aim
Y'all get them whores drunk just to get some brain
When the Roc in the place , they go bezerk
We make em bounce till they motherfuckin shoulders hurt
Bitches lift up skirts , take off shirts
Find babysitters, take off work
Lose they jobs, panties , shoes and bras
Niggas mad at us cuz they lose they wives
I don't step up in the club without a weapon in the club
Cuz niggas get drunk and kick crap up in the club
That's why my tool be cocked , niggas mad cuz my shoes be blocked
And my jewels be rocked
If you a playa , you wouldn't be in my pocket
If you a playa , you like it , you see it , you cop it

CHORUS

[AMIL]
If you a playa , you got the three basic niggas
Your trick your lick and your dick niggas
The object never fall in love wit em
Run to the malls and the clubs for them
If you a playa , then you choose em like a playa
Use em like a playa ,then you lose em like a playa
I bet I'll still be they favorite bitch
Some bought me ice , some paid for whips
C'mon you know the rules in this playa shit
Ain't no such thing as a relationship
If you a playa , get it now like a playa , get it down like a playa
Spit a round like a playa
If you a playa , roll an ounce like a playa , get an ounce like a
Playa , bounce like a playa
If you a playa , bounce , bounce like a playa nigga, bounce , bounce

CHORUS

[Jay-Z]
Jiggaman ya heard?
If you a playa , when you pull up to the curb
Niggas chicks fly to the coupe when you pull up to them birds
Why the fuck would you bring her
When the rocks on that man got his whole hand lookin like ET's finger
If you a playa , keep your cars with the year (year)
Your watch game tight (tight) your hustle over there (uh-huh)
Your house outta sight , your enemies close
And your family tight and never try to make a ho your housewife

CHORUS
