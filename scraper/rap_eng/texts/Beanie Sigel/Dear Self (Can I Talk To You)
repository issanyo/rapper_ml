[Hook x2 James Blunt]
And I see no bravery
No bravery, in your eyes
Only sadness

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Dear self, can I talk to you?
I been trying to have this conversation for years but you won't listen
Damn, are you that plain ignorant? You're so indignant
Please come off that high chair your sitting in
Before you snatched from it, or strapped to it
Ya body used as a conduit, a thousand volts flow through you
Ya life gone over something foolish
Talking to you is so useless
Ya heads harder than them walls you'll be housed in soon
Before ya body's embalmed and you lie in tomb
Open ya ears, eyes and heart, cause that hour's soon
And the hour shall cometh, when Israfel blows his trumpets
The sky shall crack, the stars will plummet
The sun will rise in the West you'll drown in your own sweat
And when that day shall be, I'll bet I'll see no bravery

[Hook James Blunt]

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Dear self can I talk to you?
Dear self can I talk to you?

Who are you to lecture me? You question me about my life and the choices I made?
How dare you to place me in an early grave? (whoa)
Why you gotta talk to me in that fashion?
You bury me face down with an open casket, this whole world can kiss mine
Tell me what this life got to offer him
A crooked preacher and a church alter?
A short speech and a long offering?
A deep grave and a short coffin?
Oh I get it... you righteous now (haha), well let the truth be told
You done smoked every blunt I rolled
You done drove every car I stole
Cooked up every crack I sold
You done slept with every trick I laid
Collected off every bet I made [laughs]
But I guess you done found Christ, I ain't know he was missin (Whoa)
Watch your Blasphemy
Man I ain't asked to be
Just let me live my life
Now hold on - No you listen
You was there on every decision
Whether it was right or wrong
And now you trying to right my wrongs
You got some nerve - you even give me the words I write in this song
You see, my vision's much clearer
It's not me but it's you that I see when I look in the mirror
And you call yourself saving me?
But it's through your eyes that I see, No bravery
