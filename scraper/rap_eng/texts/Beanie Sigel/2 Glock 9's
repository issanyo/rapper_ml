Blow through your front make it go outcha back
Ay yo I let fifty shots blow out the mac

Come in a few jeeps
Like feds come through in they sleep
And you know how we play
When we poppin' them Glocks
Take it to the AK
Chopper the block
And to the SWAT's
Helicopter the block
And them put you on the news

So I can let this tar lift you off your feet like Vince Carter

Strugglin' to breathe

So just gimme the keys
Or these motherfuckers with you are fin to witness ya bleed
Paramedics cuttin' ya jeans
Rippin' ya sleeves
Put your ass in a body bag, zip it and leave
Ain't no motherfucker do it like I do
You and your nigga runnin' up
Put two in him and two in you
I put a nigga at the bed like a child with the flu
Put hit out on that bucket and runnin' wild with your crew
Put this thang to your head
Put your brains on the roof
Here now we ain't the same
Y'alls is liars and we the truth
Now that you know the scoop

Niggas tryin' to watch mine
Tryin' to stop mine
See where I stock mine
But I pop mine
And I pop moms

Throwin' cops where your block rhyme

[T.I.P.]
Say, a nigga tryin' me
He'll find me
Bustin' away a blind bee
With thirty niggas
And sixty triggas standin' behind me
The nine be cocked
And we are riding
Bustin' in them bushes where you are hiding

[Beanie Sigel]
Ay yo I got a hundred niggas
With a fuckin' hundred gats
Who want the shit
Where their motherfuckin' stomach at
Don't bitch with that IV in you
And I'll take somethin' from you only God can give you
