[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In other words, he shall live but die you must
Instill your faith in ever whom thy trust
Instill your faith, get crushed my a man like such
Don't let them niggas gas you up like Sig is, but
Sig the shit, but far from ass
Stop the blood clot crying, the pain shall pass
But for now meet the reaper and feel thy rath
Green as the grass shall be on the other side
Another lie told to you by old blue eyes
Blue is the color of deception, so my recollection
Now you're lost with no direction
I'm a stand up man, I stand on my own two, firm
Why fool never learn? Play with fire, get burned
But my word you don't trust it, now it's too late once you touch it

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
Uh, Young C, SP, yo
I love my niggas for life, ain't no doubt about that
My nigga Free, nigga Crack, throw a shout for Mac
Oschino and Sparks, them niggas my heart
(insert lyric) Kept them one hundred from the start
HOV prop, we was fresh off the block, like what?
Came at Nas, came at The LOX, ain't give a fuck
Whoever came at big homie had a problem with us
See we was all we knew, in Roc-a-fella we trust
Now this bullshit split up, fucked the whole shit up
Knocked us back to scratch, how the fuck we get back to that
Niggas need you big homie, gotta get back to rap
I mean, facts is facts, 16 you had my back
Now we back corner to corner, niggas laugh at that
Seeing me firing the streets, how you ain't mad at that?
Let alone niggas plan my demise, tough love
Big homie you ain't stand by my side. How can I (run to the ROC)

[Verse 3: Omillio Sparks]
It's death before dishonor and I'm a fucking rider
Flicking my middle finger to all the corporate liars
Juelz can feel the fire, cause he's a fucking traitor
I'm far from a hater, I never been a liar
My fucking youngest riding, it's like they let us suffer
Making they skins thicker, making they circle tighter
And they ain't relying on us, to get them out the gutter
See what I want for myself, I want for my brothers
Calm as a mother fucker, and ya'll some fronting niggas
I'm trying to feed my babies, ya'll trying to starve my siblings
I ain't received the cheques since my boy Mac was sentenced
Law sent us back, what's your personal business
Now we back in the trenches in this hurting position
Imagine me in the kitchen somewhere working the dishes
You get your wish if you ever planned my demise
Tough love, big homie you ain't stand by my side, how can I (run to the ROC)
