You wonder why I'm still on the block
'Cause I just can't leave it babe
'Cause that's all I know
Throw the gut away when you see the cops come back and retrieve it babe
'Cause that's all I know
'Cause that's how we roll
From the gut straight to your front door
'Cause that's all I know
A bunch of thug niggas put them appetite
Then you know we gonna feel it babe
'Cause that's all I know

So the top it's my destiny to the death in me
Baking soul and ice was the recipe
Big boy in the big toy plane watch connecting with the connect
Soon as the fame stop
Some said that I lost it I don't know what they talking
They used to be Ross it
They used to be boss it
Tony dances with two bitches who the boss
And use to the best back to back you exhausted
That the paws in that cuatro got the cars
On a block with the property nobody guards
Before out look us the main wows
For a way hard
Don't forget my hot sauce gotta let your

You wonder why I'm still on the block
'Cause I just can't leave it babe

From the gut straight to your front door
'Cause that's all I know

'Cause that's all I know

My mama made me, the block raised me
Raggon baby, pradagot the aimies
New one day I'll be big shit to be gravy
Once I got the white girl silk like the navy
Before they say a point so was born a baby
Crush ice wonder 200 spice is got me lazy
Never had the unidentified the block paid me
Eaten all the rocks before the rock paid me
That's all I know it's this ghetto
Late nights where you had shot echo
This the hood life, this the good life
Young love turn the good day to a shoot night
Gotta love right

You wonder why I'm still on the block
'Cause I just can't leave it babe

From the gut straight to your front door

Top of discussion at the beauty of line
French frize at five fity movies at nine
Get out of line they barbecue you like the forth for July
Tryin' to survive just to get by like wow
Ash trip game near nigga like ah
This is moving up for that slice and the pie
In the hood you try to turn the back so good times
Get rich of die tryin' shit
Fifth took nine
Get George get mine juts don't stop my grind
Put the dub on your head but I ain't droppin' the dime
Shit I turn this bitch out of the project water
My love my hood, my block, my corner
