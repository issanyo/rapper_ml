[Verse 1: Freeway]
When you come, you niggas know what it is
I let you keep your girl, bro, but with your boys, it's a no go
Throgh slugs at your wig, I get back at you
Knock your block off, smack up your kids
Make it like Shane-O, ain't no shame here
When your with your boys, I throgh gats at their ribs
Get it back in the doe
Use guns that'll blow your brains to the back of your wig
9 4 G pack on your porch, and in the back of your block
Now I'm 3, layed in the back of the Porsh
Stop at your block, make it like Nas
I make feends holler at moms

[Chorus: Freeway and Beanie Sigel]
Philly niggas that'll dap the crime
Chilly niggas since we linked with Rock
You silly niggas, not Philly niggas that'll squeeze the Glocc
Philly niggas that'll dab the gon
Chilly niggas since we linked with Jay
Ya'll silly niggas, south PHilly niggas, we bust the K

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
I blast metal that'll go through your ribs, you fagget niggas straight go in a house, blast an explosive
Bring you niggas straight out of your crib
Bullet fragments all in your mouth, face off, C4, that'll level you out
Fuck your stainless steal door, nigga, I'll metal it out
We got connects at the range, hot metal, we out
Connect the dot, say Bean, we level it out
Pushin beams through your window, scanning
Your house
We even scan when you standing on your couch
We in there, out there, like a robbery, planned it out
Escape roofs, never land in the house
The big rumble snake moves, niggas talk about when they get out
So if you scared, say you scared, is you in, or is you out
Fuck the maximom pentimom house
I'm comin into your house, 2 gats, me and Mack, gettin back

[Chorus: Freeway and Beanie Sigel]
Philly niggas that'll dap the crime
Chilly niggas since we linked with Rock
You silly niggas, not Philly niggas that'll squeeze the Glocc
Philly niggas that'll dab the gon
Chilly niggas since we linked with Jay
Ya'll silly niggas, south PHilly niggas, we bust the K
