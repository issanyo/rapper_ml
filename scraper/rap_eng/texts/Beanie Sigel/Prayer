Masha'Allah

As I wake up in the morning, stretch my arms wide
Before I even yawn or wipe the cold out my eyes
I say Al Humdulillah, giving praise to my God
Allowing me another day, blessing me to rise

Know at any given time, it could be my demise
Cause you only get a minute to pray
(And a second to die)
And realizing that I've come to terms with that
One day I'm gonna burn for all my heinous acts

I know a sincere prayer can only change my fate
So I drop, prostrate and pray it ain't too late
For me to ask for forgiveness and increase my faith
And guide me on the path that's straight
And never lead me astray

Cause I know I can't walk this alone
I'm in fear of that fork in the road
The devil there, waiting to claim my soul
So I pray that You hold my hand
As I follow your footprints in the sand

Now I know I done did some wrong
And I ain't been to talk to you in so, so long
So I'ma hit my knees and extend my palms
And send this up to you and hope you hear this

I'll be prayin'
(Prayin')
I'll be prayin'
(Prayin')
I'll be prayin'
(Yeah)
I'll be prayin'
(Ayee yeah)

I often find myself stuck, just staring in space
Feel like hours at a time, my mind drifting away
Can't quite collect my thoughts or put 'em in place
And I grab a glimpse of my momma with a head full of grays

I know they shouldn't be there
(Nah)
Not for her age
And then I think of how I stressed her and shortened her days
Her long sleepless nights, not knowing if I was safe
Or was my name on the list of the reaper that day

I sink deeper as I feel a tear creep down my face
I wipe it away, now my thoughts on life in the grave
I know on that day that three things gon' go wit ya
Ya family, ya wealth and ya deeds but two gon' leave

And when that last person leave that site
The grave gon' squeeze so tight
Ya ribs gon' overlap till every bone crack
I drop my head in despair, imagine going through that

I smell fire then I notice the hole in my pants
I drop my cigarette butt and brush off my ash
I'm still stuck but I notice a car pass
I hear the driver cussin' me out over his horn blast

Damn, this can't be right, let me snap back to life
How long I been stuck, day dreaming at this light?
Wondering if that's a sign of how I'm moving through life
A reckless abandon, a accident, just waiting to happen

A reckless abandon, a accident, just waiting to happen

Now I know I done did some wrong
And I ain't been to talk to you in so, so long
So I'ma hit my knees and extend my palms
And send this up to you and hope you hear this

I'll be prayin'
(Prayin')
I'll be prayin'
(Prayin')
I'll be prayin'
(Yeah)
I'll be prayin'
(Ayee yeah)
