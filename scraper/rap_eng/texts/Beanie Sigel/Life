[Verse 1: Freeway]
I came up with my man, same hood, same age
Witheld names to protect the guilty and
Your boy Free was filthy, same clothes, different day
Be the first to admit it, while niggas claim to be
Willies, hey
He pulled up the first johnny I drove
He cruised off the first homi I seen, follow the flow
Smoke a timmy, with this semi, made his chimney move
Nerves made his body shake, everybody froze
So young with a pump and a mac
Still manage to make it the Masjid, the bad kids
On the block, with a bundle of crack, package of pills
Old heads will try to teach us Quran
He said Muhammed walk with a sword, I roll with a gat
This the same shit, different day, from times
Now my man booked ain't writing me back
So I figured, I'll try to reach 'em with rhymes, now listen to Mac

[Hook: singer]
We thuggin' for life
Gonna take it, oww
And then enough
Ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
To all my boys in the hood, the East coast' does boys back
From the land of them throw boys black
I keep my toast in the hood, gon' squeeze
Hope you throw yours back
Come to the streets to bring my homeboys back
Blew my mind out this piece, but I'm always back
I got shiek in my ear, like mac, fall away back
Shiit, I'm trynna come way up
And make the path so freak, I tear the runaway up
Uh, my life a bitch with a period on
But still I keep it real, dog, I'm hittin' it raw
And I don't know how to carry this bitch
Sometime I wanna marry this bitch
Sometimes I feel like quitting this whore
But I can't cause it feel like kids is involved
I've been on so fucking much, feel like my living was off
But in my lifetime I learned to live with regrets
Deal with D'evils, know that one day I'mma sit with the boss
It's my life nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
It's not even close, we throw toast, sleep with ya gats
It's the worst of both hoods, holla at 'em Mac
(Follow up exact with the Mac, in the v
Get back, if you happen to see, the Mac or Free, at where you be)
I be where you at, I come where you live
The cat untuckn the gat, manuever the sig..wit seg
(The Mac untuckin' a pump, removin' they wig, with ease
Hear the feds trynna ruin the bull Sieg'
Before they kill me like Cornbread, you be like Diallo
Before I'm stuck like luima, I be up when you need it)
And I'mma ride for you, lace up my sneakers, puffin' my reefer
Tuckin' my heater, duckin' your honor, uh
Tell 'em tricks they gonna die when I see 'em
Let 'em know my friend colt 45 trynna meet with they mama
But we keep drama, think, rhyme is the reason
And Freeway the reason that you tied up in pajamas, uh

[Hook]
