[Intro: Jay-Z & R. Kelly]
Who the fuck can stop us niggas, it's gangsta niggas
It's gangsta! Woo! It's gangsta nigga!
All g-g-gangsta nigga, uhh!
Green light - go go, go-go-go, go
Go go, go-go-go, go
You got the green light to drag your motherfuckin' mink
Green light - go go, go-go-go, go
Throw your pinkie ring high in the motherfuckin' air
Go go, go-go-go, go
Drop your top, c'mon!

[Verse 1: R. Kelly (Jay-Z)]
Now I done told y'all niggas once before
Y'all don't know who you fuckin' with
Y'all gon' fuck around and make me come up out this music biz
(Don't make me..)
This just a record deal, y'all motherfuckers been on some shit
Bite my style, tryin' to get rich, so I decided to flip my shit (fuckers)
Bene-fit me like a tight outfit, like Mr. Biggs' about to have a fit
It's, a, bout, to, be, some, shit (please believe it)
See vin-dawg, and dre-shal, got a nigga real open y'all
I see haters peepin' me, lookin' hard like a pu-ssy
Same fight, different round; same circus, different clown
Same pussy, different town; assholes how you like me now?
Kel' and Jigga, the best of both niggas
Put two heads together, mean mo' figures (ha)
Word to Tigger, put me off up in the basement
With the rest of the rap niggas, watch ratings get bigger
I'm a pimp of this music, the tracks be my hoes
Sisqo, don't make me pick you out like the 'fro
Haters left, players right.. green light

[Chorus: R. Kelly (Jay-Z)]
Go go, go-go-go, go
(You have the green light to be as pimp as you want to)
Go go, go-go-go, go
Green light - go go, go-go-go, go
Go go, go-go-go, go
Green light - go go, go-go-go, go
Go go, go-go-go, go
Green light - go go, go-go-go, go
(Oh this gangsta!)
Go go, go-go-go, go
(It's so muh'fuckin' gangsta!)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Psycho, like no, bitch ass niggas
Don't wanna see the R.O.C. so you creep low
Shoot from the line like a free throw
With this 'nali of mine like a Pi-co
Leave niggas far behind like a cheap ho
On my grind every time that you see Hov'
Yeah I got it, come and get it, green light go (go)
Red dot I stop ya, yellow niggas move slow

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Red dot I got 'em, tell that nigga move slow
Head shots pop 'em when I let the Uz' go
He done told fool..
Dunn think Dunn loc'in when a gun smokin'
Tell Dunn I been gun-totin'
He don't know he facin' death
Hockey mask on Jason's step
Don't make me pop past your Raisinette
You niggas cow-ass
You bullshit, I pull shit, and keep a full clip

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Go go, go-go-go, go
Go go, go-go-go, go
Green light - go go, go-go-go, go
Go go, go-go-go, go
Green light - go go, go-go-go, go
Go go, go-go-go, go
Green light - go go, go-go-go, go
Go go, go-go-go, go
