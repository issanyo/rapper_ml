[Intro]
Nah, no I'm not
Nah, nobody on this
You know how that go

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Now I'm living with a purpose, I ain't perfect
Allah got me, ain't spend too much time in churches
This from the heart, I ain't spend too much time rehearsing
I was really thinking rob before I purchased
I was really thinking God these niggas thirsty
Paranoid around soft niggas, they make me nervous
Clutching a pistol around these clowns that shit'll surface
If you knew my life you would understand I deserve it
Nobody gave me shit, told me I was worthless
Felt like I was cursed until the day that paper surfaced
It's a reason why me and Beans can relate in person
I'm cut from that cloth, all that talking'll get you murdered
I relaxed on that juice, them percocets be testing me
Plus your bitch keep texting me, I ain't attracted sexually
These niggas selling blow up, got the fiends frustrated
Tryna get this dough up, package on me, ratchet on me
Tell me what your life like cause mines is real
Every thing signed and sealed, my mind on pills
Niggas'll rat on they own mother, they see that time get real
Teddy bears and candle lightings give your moms the chills

[Hook: Dave East + Beanie Sigel]
As far as I can remember I've been a real one
They say that pressure bust pipes but I don't feel none
Just like these whack ass rappers I can't feel one
You said you wanted the real back well here it come

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Pressure's on once again but I embrace it
I weathered through the storm before, I'm never breaking
I do this for the youth in the Matrix who won't make it
I tell 'em every knock is a boost, remain patient
But every move he make is calculated through his hunger
It's sad to say shorty might not make it through the summer
His mom turned tricks for a fix, pills strung her
He only met his pop for flicks and a jail jumper
His stomach empty but his clip full
He pop xannies by the fist full
Drink syrup, skip school
Pants hanging off his ass, ain't been in the bath
I try to steer 'em right cause I hate to see him crash
Tell him just stay in his lane and remain humble
You bound to get hit in the game just don't fumble
I seen G's drop the ball and straight crumble
Just know if your aunt had a dick she'd be your uncle
What your life like nigga mines is real
No if, mights, maybes, probably, wills
I blow your fucking head off with that revolver steel
I shot a nigga on tour, got that revolver still
Know when you fucking with the Bully you involved with real
I put your body somewhere, they won't solve your kill nigga
You need to stop if you think Mac won't pop it
Have your mom in all black out casket shopping

[Verse 3: Dave East + Beanie Sigel]
It's the Broadstreet Bully and Dave East, yeah we playing for keeps
These niggas dressing like freaks and they calling it fleek
These niggas be signing sheets plus they calling police
Know every nigga in the ghetto ain't involved in the streets
We ain't really into the games we gon' rest you to peace
Pull something big out, give you a long kiss on the cheek
Who ready to die? Sky's the limit who want beef?
I was a bad boy before I repped the ROC
This ain't nothing new shit this just what the fuck we do
We like no limit soldiers  and nigga I'm that true
The reason, the solution nigga I'm that too
Whoever stuck to the realness, then I'm that glue
It's a war going on outside you ain't safe from
You can play Super man, you get your cape hung
We don't start no shit  and we don't take none
We just 100% until our day come

[Hook: Dave East + Beanie Sigel]
As far as I can remember I've been a real one
They say that pressure bust pipes but I don't feel none
Just like these whack ass rappers I can't feel one
You said you wanted the real back well here it come
As far as I can remember I've been a real one
They say that pressure bust pipes but I don't feel none
Just like these whack ass rappers I can't feel one
You said you wanted the real back well here it come

[Outro: Dave East + Beanie Sigel]
You said you wanted the real back well here it come
You said you wanted the real back well here it come
You said you wanted the real back well here it come
You said you wanted the real back well here it come
You said you wanted the real back well here it come
You said you wanted the real back well here it come
You said you wanted the real back well here it come
