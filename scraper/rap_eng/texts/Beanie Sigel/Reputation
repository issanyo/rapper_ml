[Hook - Beanie Sigel][x3]
Where a nigga disrespect that's why I leave me
Cuz in these streets my reputation precedes me
Cuz in these streets my reputation precedes me
Where a nigga disrespect that's why I leave me

[Verse 1 - Young Chris]
Fuck around, you gon need the whole family to help you
Throw a bullet at you bitch ass, man it ain't welcome
Put em under the pressure, know the gun is his fresher
Got the best shit in the city and the numbers is lesser
[?], the [?]'s white 2pac, before [?] had it, I'm on to salad
Nigga we been the best, before you knew Khaled
Mastered the trap like P, is you bout it?
Jumping out of jets at 16
Straight from the block had a nigga on big screens
Neighbors telling mama I was cutting class
Look at your boy on a hell of a path
Bitch niggas all hate, they don't love it for real
I'm here to murder pussy boy, slug in your grill
Ready to die, just the life we live
We killing everything moving except for wife and the kids
Kill em all!

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 - Peedi Crakk]
Bitches want to fuck, they don't want to work
I don't give a fuck about no pussy, where the work
Big black matt, do my own dirt
Asking where I been at, I been in that wave surf
First things first, man you're fucking with the worst
Wouldn't piss in her mouth if a bitch was dying of thirst
I'm providing the murder, your mama supplied the hearse
Since birth, original hot boy like turf
Hop up out the shower, feel like I got the power
Paper god, play a level, pocket on fire
Big boy bourbon, 32 on the tire
Pull up wearing a turban, dirty, no license
Fired a firearm, quiet storm
Dress warm, cold world, I got to keep the hoodie on
Classic, keep an oldie but goodie on
Peed Crakk shit, showing rappers what they should be doing

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
We're out here touring the spots you never heard of
In the states we're touring with Glocks, we're not nervous
Pop off, hop in the whip with my burner
It's a state property clique, we all murder
Best beard ever, keep the [?]
That's the KR swing down your way with the desert
Know I'm with the bad, yes I'm a king
And before I ever sing used to sling with the peasants
Fuck with kid who jump of the sink
You no longer live, go hang with the reverend
Get dough all for spitting, Don't offer pies
Get dough 365 24 7
Fuck Freeway, just call me doughman
Best flow man, big beard like an old man
Grown man, hold weight like I'm rose and
Angry tiring, I sling iron like I'm Conan
