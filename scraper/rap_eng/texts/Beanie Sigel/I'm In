Once she grin, I'm in, game begin
Man I met this bitch one time
I mean man this chick so fine
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I caught her at the mall goin shoppin
Shorty had six bags, strugglin and still coppin
Cute face, slim waist, body proper
Hair fell short to her shoulders, I had to stop her
Shheeit, I had to add that to the roster
And me leavin without that there was not a option
Excuse me miss, please take no offense
But I'm shoppin for a ladyfriend about your size
I saw somethin that could be a 4, if you could try that on
Shit, I could peep the fit before I buy it for her
She smiled, and tried it on with no problem
Stepped out lookin like The Next Top Model
DAMN! I told the salesclerk to give me two
And told ma for all your work, this one for you
You keep it~! That'll be our little secret
Now peep it, to make this long story shorter
I ain't get shorty name 'til the next morning

Once she grin, I'm in, game begin...
Once she grin, I'm in, game begin...

Once she grin, I'm in, game begin
Man you know that chick that time
I said I had to stick that time
I fucked the bitch about six times
Now she on my phone every hour
Cussin out her man, talkin 'bout he a coward
Bitch please, she said that I'm all that she need
Indeed, I showed her that I was built for speed
I'm heavy, somethin like a '55 Chevy
And they don't make my class no more, I'm quite sure
I'm somethin she never had before, I'm that boy
Cause once they grin, I'm in, game begin!
Y'all dudes spit that same lame to them
Please~! You niggas ain't nothin like Sig'
Man I run through these chickens like fresh white tees
Keep 'em in check like fresh Nikes
And once again, when they grin, I run 'em in

Once they grin, I'm in, game begin - uhh!
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin - uhh!
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin

[Beanie Sigel]
I'm the master, I'm somethin like a pussy conniseur
Faggot! You somethin like a pussy kind of whore
Chit-chattin at bitches, yip-yappin with niggas
About this and that, how your chips be stacked
I keep a bitch on her BACK! Put her face in the pillow
You give a bitch all your TRAP! Keep your face in the middle
Of her puss, while her mouth full of Cupids
You useless! I abuse 'em then I lose 'em
I'm +Ruthless+, but nothin like Eazy
I keep a pocket full of Magnums, believe me
I keep these whores chasin
Short money, long conversation, they gets nathan
You know the rules, a whore gets none
Hard dick and bubblegum
And I just chewed my last stick is where I'm comin from

Once they grin, I'm in, game begin - uhh!
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin - uhh!
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
