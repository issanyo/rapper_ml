Jesus my chain just freezes
Ice so clear you see through em like Zimas
Display colors like a 60 inch zenith
The chickens love us they be all on the penis
My SP charm snatched a chick off ya arm
Look i ain't braggin my dough stretch like wagon
Worse than bin laden or saddam with a bomb
Remain calm while i'm toe taggin

I stay scorchin like olympic torches
I steer porsches you walk down air forces
Bentleys and rolls royces
That's just a mere portion of the fortune
I'm about that change like metamorphosis
Look i change clothes and go
Got a shower in the office
You lil cowards back off us
Before i give out lead showers with the taurus
If you ain't talkin bout dollars then you lost us
Uh, just know we got it
What it cost us you can't out floss us
Unh, me and lil c
We park cars then we party like arv in the middle of the sea
Seeth and young gunner just off genius man i made about a hunnid
Mill that is now how real that is

Rest in piece in the cracks of the cement
50 shots screaming with no fair warning
Mac 10 with the red beam gleaming
Ready to ride by or walk up on em
Now if the feds come and get me in the morning
Best believe nigga getting bailed by the evening
Id do anything to stop mama from mourning
So if them killas come you niggas know i'm squeezin

Murder attempt the case they gave me
Held without bail from the way press painted me
He's a menace like Lorenz in that flick
But he don't hold his glick with a twist
He hold it with a grip, kinda stiff
Now peep shit, nigga holdin a 5th tell me to lost the chain
And not resist he cocked back, click, leave me stiff with 2 to the brain
Now what if i peep game take his 5th give him 2 to his frame
Leave his shirt with little maroon stains
Am i to blame his intentions were the same
Cause i'm a face with a name with a little bit of change
I gotta carry a gun either that or my momma buryin a son
So it's either him or me and i ain't the one


Rest in piece in the cracks of the cement
50 shots screaming with no fair warning
Mac 10 with the red beam gleaming
Ready to ride by or walk up on em
Now if the feds come and get me in the morning
Best believe nigga getting bailed by the evening
Id do anything to stop mama from mourning
So if them killas come you niggas know i'm squeezin
