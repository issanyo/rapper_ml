[Intro]
My Spider senses is tingling
Feel something, got my radars up

[Verse 1]
Something going on, I feel funny
Can't tell me nothin' different, my nose twitchin'
Intuition setting in like Steve vision
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind
So what I do? I still take heed, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture, I still shine bright like a prism
My words still skippin' through air
I know you can't, don't, won't get it
You niggas chose to ride that ship, sunk with it
I'm still afloat, I ain't the captain of the yacht
But I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggas acting like you will, but I know you won't
I read between the lines of your eyes to your brows
Your handshake ain't matching your smile
Ah-ah, you niggas foul

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at hammers
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me, two TEC's, extra clips on me
I know my mind ain't playing tricks on me
I ain't skitz, homie. Ain't no body drop a nick on me
It's like they trying to plot a set on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like mack tighten up your circle before they hurt you
Read they body language
85 percent communication non-verbal
85 percent swear they know you
Ten percent, you know they story
Man, the other five, time'll show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you the puppet master
Fuck them other bastards, man, watch who you puffin' after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss you still amongst those stars

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

[Verse 3]
Can you feel it, can you feel it floating?
Without picture quoting, scriptures from Revelation
Talk shit and got the devil waiting, body get stiff, so levitate
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that he'll ask for me?
Ask for my sins, no one'll feel his wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parkin'
Not bitching, I'm just still cautious
Same black parka, same Uzi, extra clips
Still clapping with that same larking
Damn, I feel it in the air, you not sincere
Nigga, it ain't an us or we or I'ma thing
It's a good/bad karma thing
This a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something honestly

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air
