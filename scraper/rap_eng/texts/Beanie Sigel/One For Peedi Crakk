[Peedi Crakk]
It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name P, Prizzy Mac Milly
Used to with Young Crizzy in the back rolling on twigs
People wanna know who run with me, nobody but the bang, bang
Streets will forgive me, street vocals searching the city, sing
Peedi, Peedi, I heard that they got your number
The alias you've been living under the mack goes thrriiing
Peedi, Peedi, I heard that they watch your mother
Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't - blliinnk
Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers
Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers
Wait, that's just enough for you to follow
Heavyweight rap, I spit for much for you to swallow
Blap, Blap, number one with a bullet
Play with them guns to the fullest
Your stupid ass get, clapped, bap
About my past and my future, you disrespect it, I'll shoot you
Treat it just like that...

[Hook: repeat 2X]
[Peedi C] Now one's for Peedi Crakk
[Freeway] And two's for Free'
[Young C] Three for Young Gunna
[B Sigel] And four for Sig'
[Peedi C] You know it's SP yes we above of those things
First the mack go ring, and when it's done it go ting

[Freeway]
All of the sudden and there's six million ways to rhyme
There's still six million ways to D-I-E
I'll smack your P-Y-T, with the bun and the nine, nigga
I live me rhymes, y'all ain't Free
But y'all know y'all heard of him
Niggas can not serve him, not see him when he floatin' by, windows be dark tinted
Stop playing thinking you touch him, trouble you deep in it
Clock spitting, it's just the principle, my principality
Follow me home, better have a full tank, money for shoes
What you fools think, full bank money from shows
It's the Roc bitch, I'm on your block bitch
I'm in the cock-pit, you think it's a Rolls
So what if it's borrowed from Mac, gotta take it back, back
And gotta bobble the gat, push your shit back, back
Free, house the trap, push the release day back
Me and crack at it again, add it to wax

[Hook]

[Young Chris]
It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name, Young Chris, or Young Gunner
Know my partner Young Neffi, we the youngest out the gang
Mamis spend a lot of meta, man I treat 'em all the same
Closest thing to my thang, is my thang, thang
Niggas they act dumb act they think, thangs
Soon as the crackers come, they hit the bing, and sing
Niggas on the street whisperin', Police District and
Tell them about the drops and when the Puerto Ricans did Shamear
The dough get 'em, about the flow switchin' em
Got the greatest listening, haters 4-5'n them
Blasin' not missin' 'em, LA missin' him
Muhammad thang got his momma thinking that it's cousin Chris and 'em
Though we in a better place, be here, he rather too
But our father, the number when he ready too
Do not bother the rumble, niggas ready too, bang you in a second
Keep the banger for protection

[Hook]

[Beanie Sigel]
It ain't a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name B. Siggy, Mac Milly, Mac Mittens
Broad Street Bully, Mac go fully, bitch
My whole squad sing chiti-bang, bang
Make the city gangbang, stay pop, chain GANG
Y'all ain't said a damn thang, with your thang thangs
Nigga, we can do the damn thang
The war ain't over 'til that fat bitch sang
Or the last bullet from my Mac blaang, mayne
My whole click goin' reign, the half a clip will melt ya
For shelter, don't get caught up in the drizzle
Hit you in the spittle, and then bring it back again
It ain't a thang to make your brains go hang, mayne
Got bitches on the thang, thang
Because they like the way the S.P. chain swings
City of Philly, you know that city brought your city the slang
My squad with me, and they ready to bang, bang

[Hook]
