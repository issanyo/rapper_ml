[Verse : 1]

Look up in the sky
It is a bird , it is a plane
Nope.. It is B sigel and ain't no damn thing changed bitch
Still flame shit with the stainless
And I dont give two shits what your name is
It is mack bitch and we strangers
You act like you forgot how I do things
I don't get shot, I shoot things
Push the mazarat, (?) the coupe thing
Pimp along like boot strings
Who choosing, who (?) refute beans you losing
Push up on your cute thing, make her do the group thing
Let the chain gang gang-bang
You fuck 'em with an SP chain dang (what)
Baby mama drama, you only claim to (?)
You front, drama with the bully, you not wanting
Who wanna start something, let's get it dumpin'
I am all for it
