[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Please believe that, some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life
Some way, we gotta make it up out this life

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Whether we dribble out this motherfucker
Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker
Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker
Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
Some day the cops'll kill a muh'fucker
I don't always wanna be this drug dealing muh'fucker, damn
Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride
Through the sky, I
Used to play the hall and fifth floor, me and my boys
We all poor getting high, I
Seen the worst of the worst, I deserve every blessing
I received I'm from the dirt
I, planted my seed on unfertile land
Myrtle Park, Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand, and
Still I grew, some how I knew that the sun'll shine through, and
Touch my soul, take hold of my hand
Look man, a tree grows in Brooklyn

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Some how some way
I gotta make it up out the hood someday
Some how some way
I gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some way, I gotta make it up out this hood someday

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
(To Lil' Nell, Sigel Street, I ain't forget you)
Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck
Nosey neighbors and haters keep they face on stuck
Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up
Moms smoke, kids can't chase the ice cream truck
Girls fighting over rope, the young boys hype things up
Niggas fighting over coke, the young boys light things up
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
'member Lil' Eddie draw, man how he light mean up
Then they wonder why we light green up
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't, I lean up
Ain't the L or the reefer that steam up (that steam up)
It's my head and I'm stressed to the point I get a fever
Thinking 'bout the block and all the mothers and kids
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed 'em
For the rest of their life
Fucking wings, fried vegetable rice (gotta be kidding)
No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four (you know how it go)
Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (yeah I know)
That's how I feel for them
And we gotta grip of shorties on the block
All they do is smoke weed and drink forties, cop their quarties
Enough to get the latest ROC, newest Glock, and old Jordies

[Chorus: Beanie Sigel]
Some how some way
We gon' make it up out this hood one day
Some how some way
We gon' make it up out this life, yeah
And some how some way
We gon' make it up out the hood one day
Some way, we gon' make it up out this life

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Right here another lil' story 'bout this clique I claimed
Got another chapter based on how I get that game
Just hanging round my neighborhood, bang my street
Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep
South-side, Sunnyside
Is the blocks I run, South Acres, South Park
Nigga all got guns
Over here we got this code Charlie, get that there
We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that now
Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps
Working inside a smoke house starving to death
Serving these niggas flippers, quarter-ounces and jippers
Agents snapping your picture
Neighbors plotting to get ya
Situations is critic
I was out here be getting it
Living it like a savage 'cause nigga I gotta have it
They holding back on a motherfucker, I'm in it for the haul dog
Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all y'all
Lord be willing and the creek don't rise
I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise
(Some how some way)
(Some how some way)
I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise
(Some how some way)

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some way, we gotta make it up out this life
