The State Property CD is labeled with just Beanie Sigel and
Sparks being on "Why must I". But Oschino is also on the track

[Beanie Sigel]
Eh, Please believe it
Believe this shit
Mack Mittens in the spot
Eh, The crack rhyme king, you know
Why must I be like that
Why must I push the crack
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
(Nigga) The hustler in me

Verse 1

[Beanie Sigel]
Poison em' all (Fuck em')
I know that sounds like the words of a bastard
But Polly need crackers
And daddy's son need pampers
I gave ya'll The Truth and The Reason
I can't give you the answers (Nope)
I try to do the right thing
But I swear by god
I'm not Spike Lee, I skip my school days (Fuck it)
I ran with old heads (old heads)
In 89, who push 98's
Blue haze through deuce treys
Do what I been, I been through, through it again
I seen the streets tame boys, turn few to men
While you was in the house playing Nintendo (Nintendo)
On ya back pads on ya Dyno doing indo (indo)
Shit, I was in the house smoking indo (indo)
Serving smokers off the back ledge through the window (window)
How many, How many, smoke em' get skinny
Got em' short, got em' tall
Got plenty for all y'all now (c'mon)

Chorus

[Sparks and Beanie Sigel]
Why must I feel like that
Why must I push the crack
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
The hustler in me
Why must I feel like that
Why must I push the crack
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
The hustler in me

Verse 2

[Oschino]
Why must I push the crack
I was forced into it
I was going through it pushin' that Buick
It wasn't all good a week ago (eh ah)
Shit been bad for a while
I was forced to put that crack in the vile (You know it)
Pockets was low, mind wasn't right
So I had to play the corner with the nine every night
So I crushed competition
Killed the drama
Sold goods like Excedrin
Syrup like Aunt Jemima
Money was coming, niggas was hatin'
Send bullets through they fame till they Harlem shakin'
Treated crack like rap
And I move them units
And the way I tuck paper niggas thought I was Jewish
Had the fiends snortin' blow like the K-9 unit
And I finally got that paper to park that Buick
Got the aero dynamic Benz wagon
So carefully crafted
When I pulled on the block I just smashed it

Chorus

[Sparks and Beanie Sigel]
Why must I feel like that
Why must I push the crack
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
The hustler in me
Why must I feel like that
Why must I push the crack
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me (I'm a hustler Nigga!)
The hustler in me

Verse 3

[Sparks]
Omilio, Omilio wooo
I talk greazy to pricks like
One yourself scrapper
I'm king Willie, stay the fuck off my strip (eh huh)
Or have ya guys get hit
Clash the position, I'm stuck in the kitchen
Whippin' it, ghetto D to the oil
Got the dope fiends rushin'
Drawing attention, scarring the workers
Got em, Ready to quit the game
So I'm doing the game like
Keep your eyes open youngin'
And tell them fiends I said no short, no change
And I'm payin' em weekly
And I'm payin' silly
You pay em' Friday you won't see em' for the rest of the weekend
Watching the block
Cause some like to skim off the top
Mixing they little caps in with my rock
Ungrateful motherfuckers end up gettin' clap by the cops
Tryin' to slow up the money spot
(I'm a hustler baby, I'm a hustler baby)
And why must I, now why ask why

Chorus x2

[Sparks and Beanie Sigel]
Why must I feel like that
Why must I push the crack
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
The hustler in me
Why must I feel like that
Why must I push the crack
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me
It ain't nothing but the hustler in me (I'm a hustler Nigga!)
The hustler in me
