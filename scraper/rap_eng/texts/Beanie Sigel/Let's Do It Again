[Verse 1]
I've had some of my best times chillin' at the bar yo
Doing stupid shit, that I won't remember tomorrow
Waking up confused, still wearing my shoes
Thinking back like ''Yoo What the fuck did I do?!''
Nights like this started with a pre-game
Give me an auxiliary chord, now I'm the DJ
Playing what I wanna hear, none of the Pop shit
Give me the Big L, Wu Tang and Pac shit
Drinking till I'm buzzing like my phone's on vibrate
Taking another shot just to clear my mind state
Now im feeling good, never any less
So I'd like to welcome you to Project X
Yeah yeah yeahh
All you need is that 5 dollars for a cup and you can party 'till the sun comes up

[Bridge]
12am: On the way to the house
5am:  We'll be kicking y'all out
6am:  We'll be falling asleep
By 10pm It's on me to do it again

[Hook]
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna push my luck
Cause I'm already so drunk
I just threw my dinner up (But fuck it)
I've been trained to be a weekend warrior
So the puke and rally move is in my wheelhouse, of course sir
Living on the border
There is no other option
Even if the memories we make are all forgotten
I'll be sipping my concoction
I'm mid twenties, drinking like I'm 18 back in high school
Is that a problem?
Na man, this is not a race
Imma have my fun now
And mature at my own pace
Cause for years I've been living this exact same way
I'm like Bill Murray in Groundhogs' day

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
It's getting late now, late as the night can
Girl under my left arm, bottle in my right hand
Everybody's drunk now, most of them are passed out
Reach into my back pocket and pull a bag out
Then finally the herb come around
Blunt ride back and burn the fuck down
Getting so high, that my contacts dry
Put the visine in my eyes
So go and live your lives, we'll only get to do it once
Have some fun with it yo
Everybody loosing up, go and do some stupid stuff
Isn't that what's life about?
Man I'm having fun and if you're not, then you should try it out
