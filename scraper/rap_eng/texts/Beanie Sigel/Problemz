[Intro]

[Young Chris]
We here to make sure these niggas take heat and remember
That we bout it bout it  business
Like P in the Limit
Got some bout it bout it bitches that fein for the nigga
Used to flee me for the niggas now C all up in it
Hit it when I want to no matter how you treat 'em
How much you flee 'em you can get it when you want to
You don't have to eat 'em
Just dick 'em down right
Never speak on another playa she don't like
Get a flagrant for that
Fuck you hatin' for
Dude just playin' his part, she datin bull
Down at the club she just had to go
Young Gunnas from State P had a show
You show see them people shakin and shakin
And movin and groovin but Gunna was coolin
Long as I had my tullin' the girlies was choosin
Everybody else actin foolish
Over there actin stupid
Come over here and we shootin

[Chorus]
If you at the bar buying drinks holla
Ooh Ooh
V.I.P full of sticky stick say

If you ready creep wit his wife holla
Ooh ooh (like, like) let's do it
If its 23's on the wheel's holla

Young Gunnaz bangin through the speaker say

If you cheatin on ya man tonight holla
Ooh Ooh (like) ooh ooh (like) ooh ooh let's do it

[Young Neef]
Don't tell 'em nothing
These niggas ain't bout nothin
They look here wit them fake stares
We gon get to cuttin
You know they frontin girlies up in the place
Plus they probably mad bitches up in out face
4-5th on the hip
And them Buddahs a 8
These niggas wanna trip
Then we give these niggas a taste
Don't shoot at cars
And won't shoot from far
We chase 'em and lace 'em
For all the shit they talking plus hatin fuck waitin
We send a mothafuckas to Satan
Been takin niggas girlies for ages
She throwin it from the back
I'm grindin all on her hips
She talkin that freak shit
How bout she a freak bitch
Maybe a chewie quick
Never go to sleep cause you know them chicks
Soon's you go to sleep they all up in your grip
Catch 'em in the act and they still deny it
Might cause a riot
I been cut the bitch off
She still on my dick

[Chorus]

[Hook: Beanie Sigel]
Its Mack daddy Young Scrappy
Nah I ain't rappin Youngins get back at 'em

[Young Chris]
All the action through the traffic on our way to perform
If you knew  like I knew you would try to keep 'em home
Soon as we give 'em the song
You hit it before the mornin'
We don't love 'em we just smut 'em
We hit it and then they gone

[Young Neef]
Plus she was all up in my business
Askin bout my cases
Knew what I was charged with
And wanna know what I'm facin
Heard I keep it on me daily wherever I go
Beat the case
Homes still fight Muhando
Yup!
