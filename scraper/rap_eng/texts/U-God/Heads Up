[Intro: Scotty Wotty]
Yeah, we on a high stake game right now my G
No foots allowed, you understand?

[Verse 1: Jackpot Scotty Wotty]
I dribbled in Philly, doubled down in Vegas
Tripled off a nickel, down in Talladega
Tipped the oath, blood, money and smoke
And I swear the state wrote any rhymes that I quote
Here on now's about, stuffing the couch
Making sure that shit is slammed right in your mouth
I'm laying on cellophane bags stuffed in vials
Palms got itchy cause my girl blew trial
Checking for funny money purple life a marked bill
Throw your dick in the dirt for chopped grills
Open like a market of fleas and from
11-7, son if you copping for trees
And I'm only fucking with 20s and Z's
If you get the wrong idea, you better come with the D's
Cause the bank won't stop and the bank won't freeze
A double dose of process and 4 g's

[Verse 2: U-God]
I spent a lot of time on the bounce to get it right
Stay rough around the edges like a bare-knuckle fight
Call me Smokey Robinson when I write as I'm a journal
I keep the burner tucked, deep inside the thermal
And the way I hear you talking to me is irrelevant
My laser sharp speech, makes me relevant
Makes the ground shake like a gang of elephants
And I came with mathematics, supreme intelligence
So I can mix it in the pot and watch the rocks just melt
Or put holes on the block it's just a notch on my belt
Or invest in new bubbles watch it rock it and sell
When the pockets start to swell, I'm taking that lane
Hit the button doors open like butterfly wings
And the sound system jumping on the summertime thing
And we always up to something when the temperature's hot
At the Maldives island watch the landing gear drop

[Verse 3: GZA]
Lyrical battles I identify with
I load up and exploit this fly gift
The clip is filled with 16 bars
Lead hits the paper so the loose leaf scarred
The mic booth is bulletproof
Anger and frustration, auto fire from hooded youths
In the darkest area assassin down to bury ya
Decode a message from the fastest carrier
This craft of trade with a sharp blade
A double-edged sword give life in dark fades
Turn murderous rap only means I killed it
Up close and personal, Wu-Tang we filled it
Mic masters Hip Hop's hallmark
The Big Bang of rap and the center was all dark
Then came the spark and we begin to rhyme
And shine light on the world in the form of art
