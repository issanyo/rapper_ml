[Verse 1: Method Man]
Still living by the code too many pretty women still living by the...
I'm just tryna get a meal
When I started rhyming wasn't tryna get a deal
I was tryna get a feel
Homicide housing bodies lying in the Hill
Man they nothing with me dying in the field
Especially when I'm tryna pay the bills
A lot of y'all relying on the steel
And see the court denying your appeal
If y'all don't know, nothing you better know its real
If it work like a workshop better know the drill
I'm past childish games, y'all just tryna take me outta my game
And calling my black women out of their name
I'm serious stay out of my brain
Understanding my slangs, Fast and Furious, stay out of my lane
Boy I'm hot, kids be calling me Blaze
In the industry I'm not, they be calling me slave
I ain't tryna burn the spot, but I'm setting my ways
I'm just a Product of the block and the city I'm raised
I'm still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the stroll
Daddy pimping them for dough
Early in the morning cops kicking in the do'
Man I Think somebody's snitching on the low
I caught my father sniffing on that snow
That's when he tried to tell me things are different than before
Kids don't listen any mo', that's fo' sho'
We used to ask permission from my fo'
Ain't no food up in the kitchen cause we broke
I ain't tryna miss Another, meal cause love it get you killed
And if it don\t your baby mother will
But y'all ain't recognizing that is, real
Until that undercover pulls his shield
And now it's kinda late to cut the deal
So I ain't gotta tell you how I feel
While I'm tryna get my pockets stuffed with hundred dollar bills
I should've went to school and get a skill
But it wasn't in my future so I stealed
That's why I got this Ruger in ya' grill

[Verse 2: U-God]
Cracker treasure chest is one of the best
Now, feel the force of the full Court press
I apply to kiss the death, something for real the realness
Untouchable, Eliot Ness, you select of vet
Take me off the bench, I suppose to lynch,Â¨
The angel in the air you can smell my stench
Soldiers in the trench, moving east to west
I gave you a note, you can keep the rest
RIP the whole coast when I heat the flesh
At the Greek fest, hit a couple of bars
Smash rips on strips like bumber cars
You're amongst the odds, with lies in the pelly
The baby, nine, the size of a celly
Now it's a dilemma like Nelly and Kelly
Milk Pirelli Tower when I peel it in a hurry with a fist of fury
Martini with a cherry is very necessary
When I make it to the top I'ma pop Halle Berry
Staten Island fairy where the legends were made
In the staircase throw a rap grenade
Take it back in the day, get clapped for your chain
"F" the blood bath it will be half of the pain
He is a high grand bullet women call him daddy
Fish tank shoes jump out the Caddy
Grand finale yo the champ is here
The cameras glare under the chandelier
While you standing there, like you can hold it down
It's nine of us all of us rock the crown
Tear it down down to the last compound
New York mixed with a Compton style
Go bonkers wild, on the stomping ground
Lay down the carpet when I'm walking the isle
Then Telephone Keenah keep stalking the child
Four misdemeanor now I'm going to trial
So secluded in exile like my sex while
Private jet style who's the livest vet now
Pass me a wet towel don't get vexed now
I ring it your chest when I let my tech growl

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
We used to rock um, leather gooses
With sheep skin coats and bombers
British Walkers, sharp skinned tailor made
Playboys black suede, three finger rings, name plate rope chains
BVD nylon, Gazelle frames and matching with the Kangol hat
You couldn't have it, brother might snatch it
Flashback 1-90e with the mock neck
Lee suit 25 nickels we shh
Fresh blue on white Puma with the track Nike
Shell toe Adidas with the fatter no laces
Late night summer time jam we in the park
Allah Math cutting, DJ spitting his dart
Sergio Tacchini brown suede ballet
Jay cross town to Delancey, jew the jew down
Fresh leather winter weather, maxima spoiler kit
Legendary deuce flicks, Slick Rick
Run DMC, Jam master Jay
Wu-Tang Clan, Scott La Rock, KRS-ONE
Peace to like Pun
I had a Jaz-O tape, me and my crew
Walk the avenue sky was blue half past two
It's the Cold Crush Moe Dee, Treacherous Three
Spoonie Gee, Busy 'Killa' Bee, yeah yeah
See crack never kept him high longer than five minutes
Wallabee Clarks of course, silk and linen
Jumbos two for five come and get it
Mamma cries tears of fear when I was wilding son
Please don't wear that, people are getting killed for that
Latin Quarter, Union Square, you had to be there
The Fever, MC glory
Ripping the armory, this is hip hop to me
And for all of y'all, this is Wu-Tang Clan
Signing off, you know how we do forever

[Verse 4: Method man]
Ay yo I gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
Lick my first  blunt off the day then start the movement
I'm chilling in a room with a view
There's always room for improvement
So I grab my coat and go and prove it
It's me against the world, you can find me in the streets
You don't spot me in the lobby probably find me in a freak
Cop Ferraris, the law be in the lining of my seats
Tryna put me in a line up till I wind up in a beast
That's the belly, how dare they tryna tell me when to eat?
With this plate of food barely in my reach
My team shoot dice, we used to shoot skelly in the streets
Wore the same Pelle Pelle for a week
But now we live the life, its such a good Life
I wish that I could live it twice
I'll probably make the same wiz my wife
It's Wu-Tang Clan always collect cheddar
Proper education always correct error

[Verse 5: Method man]
Crime scene, coppers and sirens helicopters
High beam the tension is Rising
Fiends keeping they pipes Clean
This is what life's mean?
A dollar and a dream everybody wants nice things
The kid was only 19, hole in his chest now, he's fighting
For his last breath to seeing death is frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening
You try to do the right thing, and they do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream sirens and light beams
[?] bad shots, hitting people that they didn't mean to pop
The neighborhood's in shock, block extremely hot
Another black teen shot is a normal routine for cops
They should've got good grades, work the minimum wage
Now they lying on the stretcher with nothing in them to save
Keep it ghetto, and whatever ghetto you at
Just don't love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don't love you back

[Verse 6: Masta killa]
Gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
First fresh thought to tell you so clear
When I'm Walking my head, there's a voice that talks
In my ear, I can hear it so clear (you think I'm bugging right)

[Verse 7: U-God]
The average man, wouldn't last that long
She like to work out run Marathons
She wear, tight skirts with no panties on
She's a 6 foot 1 bronze amazon
Saying, complaining about all the good men is gone
I'm from Babylon she reach the [?]
Holding jails in the nail salons
She rock Coco Chanel her smell was strong
With skin like velvet, she rocked my bags
She gave, no shhhh, sipping long [?]
She a spread eagle at the tip of the bed
She rubbed on her legs this is what I said
Rap music is therapeutic to me
Rap music is therapeutic to me

[Verse 8: Method Man]
Ay yo you ain't lived 'till you made your first million
And top models wanna pop out yo Children
I thought I told you Wu-Tang is for the Children
Way Before rap moving crack in your building
Yeah, now what's the price of rice in China
These women tryna raise the price of her vagina
Me, I'm tryna live and get the grinder
Like Diddy, but I ain't tryna give the Shyne up
Pop pop pop off no question
See Ol' Dirty like it raw no protection
When the kid hold court no objections
Meth needs his Money out the door no exception
I go hard in the paint on a rapper
I go harder on a Xanax and Viagra
You think I'm tripping, aiming the trick and
But keep a snow Bunny in the kitchen I'm the master like Killa
