[Intro]
They say New York City
Is like that y'all
They say New York City
Is like that y'all

[Chorus: Nomadiq]
Can we catch the L-train to an island
I hop out that foreign
It's yours baby you know it
I said girl you know it
Manhattan to Shaolin
Draped down in diamonds
Get love everywhere I walk, it's the way I talk
And this jet only lands in New York

[Verse 1: U-God]
Pretty young bae, young skin, you know what mood I'm in
Love is the message by the way you keep on texting
I know you sensitive and ya taste is expensive
Drinks out to work I'm on your guest list
I introduced you to biz, he paid the best hits
Two step in the club, put your request in
Outstanding, can I take you home
Before I let go, 6 minutes after the show
You in the red zone, getting your wind blown
My new joint be queued up on the headphones
Strobe lights on my gemstones
Jag's outside sitting on a pair of Bridgestones
And the [?] somehow but seems lazy
You live on polo ground, Fifty Fifth? Shit's crazy
This is classic New York with a fork
You eat it up 'till this shit is no more

[Chorus: Nomadiq]
Can we catch the L-train to an island
I hop out that foreign
It's yours baby you know it
I said girl you know it
Manhattan to Shaolin
Draped down in diamonds
Get love everywhere I walk, it's the way I talk
And this jet only lands in New York

[Verse 2: U-God]
Can I get a soul clap, what you know about that
I'm master of the ceremony, hit me on the amp
You only got calm when I pulled the Dom
And your friends looking cute they can all come
It's like dinner in the park, after dark
Watching really deep talk, Star Wars
Static on your dress game, your spark
Then pull out a pen, write a bar or two
Cabin on the greens, Central Park with a barbecue
Horse drawn carriage, and I'm looking for the marriage
Just a Staten Island nigga holding more than the average
Delancey Street, three quarters to my feet and I never got beat
And it was radio, suckers never play me
Okay but that shit stay, still shakes the ladies
It was classic New York with a fork to eat it up
Can you give us some more?

Can we catch the L-train to an island
I hop out that foreign
It's yours baby you know it
I said girl you know it
Manhattan to Shaolin
Draped down in diamonds
Get love everywhere I walk, it's the way I talk
And this jet only lands in New York

[Samples]
And you say New York City
Is like that y'all
And you say New York City
Is like that y'all
Hold it down for New York city
