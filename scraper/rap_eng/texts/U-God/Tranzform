[Hook]
Have you seen your friends turn to snakes
Then transform into rats
While running through the jungle
I can tell you all 'bout that

[Verse 1]
Let's get this straight, I'm way above all this hate
I'm in my lane, I'm circling with no brakes
And no blinkers, my team still runnin' gunnin'
Still hungry, you think that you could sink us thinkers?
Windex clean, no way I'm gonna see the clinker
And if I'm dirty, you think that you could link us think of
Another format, informant, I'm not your doormat
I hear clicking on my phone jack, no callbacks
The phones that, matter fact yo I know it's tape
Matter fact, didn't you just catch a case?
You in my face, acting like you high as fuck
Gucci belt showin' out man you wired up
This tide is up, the God gotta live this out
I'm in the rut but my gut's never giving out
I'm in the moment, staring at the hearing now
Can't tear me down, I'm living like a righteous child
I had these thoughts, knew I had to write them down
No sun rays, I live this shit underground
The devil's back, he's mad at my lifestyle

[Verse 2]
Handle my hardware, always had to earn my keep
Money and friendship, always had to turn the beef
Behind my back, you should of had your words with me
But talk is cheap, acting like you own the streets
You want beef, well all I'm doing is tryna eat
But we was mans, plans, million dollar scams
Now June 24th you're lying on a fucking stand
The judge slam the hammer, in grand jury glamour
Now it's club fed vacation in the Alabama
I ask myself, should I put down the hammer
These blood sucking vampires always coming at'cha
Leeches on my back, bottom feeders body snatchers
Savages, in pursuit of happiness
My wife want half of this, oh she's tryna jam me up
You won't get half of this, sorry then no tummy tuck
I ask myself, for the fame for the bucks?
Now ask myself man, aw she just starstruck
I tricked on timbs, had flicks of her my best man
Creeping on the Westin, spotted in the West Inn!
