Classic, classic, classic, classic (yo)
Classic, classic, classic (yo, yo)

[Verse 1: U-God]
I got book rhymes, crook lines, built like tankers
Look Ma they took mines hook line and sinker
Big time thinker nailed in a pine box
Watching like a hawk kid, seats in the sky box
Cut you with a dry ox, slapped with a bank roll
Stank hoes on salary loving my lingo
Get money, make moves, burn more calorie
Bruise your anatomy, my atom is hard
Slam you on the granite dammit, rap bandits at large
Pin metals on my chest, stir up the hornet's nest
Burn holes in your neck, control your flesh
Fat back wheels, crack kills children
Every time the mack spits in the back of the building
Splash with a feeling, you need a healing
Hot shots of sake, son, you can't stop me
You can't drop me son or cock block me
I'm powder puff so ruff, slot time, Dough rush
Hit my enemies in your guts, cold crush
Rib cage blow up, everything's hurricane
Red beams tear your frame, my dick game's never lame
Slang right, daylight, hot grease and egg whites
Hog mics all night, fisticuff dog fights
With Dillinger's, motorized mouth out the cylinder
War tone, guerrilla hormone, vast in the omniance
Dance with the Ramadan, throw y'all armor on
Gift wrap your karma strong, shots out in Lebanon
LeBron James, Golden Arms, Large Professor
Niggas cocaine niggas

[Outro: Large Professor sample]
Classic, classic, classic, classic
Classic, classic, classic, classic
Classic, classic, classic
