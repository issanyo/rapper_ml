[Talking]
This is U-God, that's right, that's right
I'm coming for the young, coming for the old
Coming for the story that's never been told
Yes! Yo, yo yo - you wanna hear that story 'bout that nine dirt-bomb brothers from Shaolin, you better cop that Raw
Yo, yo, yo March 6th, Raw, I'ma give it to you, pick up that book

[Outro]
What you lookin' at?
You all a bunch of fuckin' assholes. You know why? You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be?
You need people like me. You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers and say, "That's the bad guy
" So... what that make you? Good? You're not good
You just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie
So say good night to the bad guy!
The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you. Make way for the bad guy. There's a bad guy comin' through!
