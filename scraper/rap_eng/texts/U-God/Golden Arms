Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: U-God]
I keep my third eye 20-20, every day looking sunny
God's told me: "Nothing move but the money, money"
Headstrong, backbone, hit them on the Batphone
Could there be back home? Feeling like fresh chrome (Yeah, yeah)
Something for your headphone, build the establishment
Quit while you're ahead, save the embarrassment (Yeah, yeah)
Elect me for president, thought I was irrelevant?
Battled all the elements, overcome their hardships (Yeah, yeah)
And struggled with accountants, **** got rocky
I trained in the mountains, now the world is mine (Yeah, yeah)
Got us spraying from the fountains, drive by the housing
Reminisce, take a ****, staircase, we made thousands! (Thousands)
We was Park Hill, rugrats, fishermen, thug hats
Five dollar snapbacks, never got no love back
That's why I sold packs, damn right, I stole that (Yeah, yeah)
Granule, hold that now I want the whole stack
Changed my life, now it's rap, ain't no turning back

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Raekwon]
Tell, tell, golden arms, maintain the fort! (Fort, fort, fort)
Tell, tell golden arms, maintain the fort (Fort, fort, fort)
Tell, tell golden arms, maintain the fort (Fort, fort, fort)
Tell, tell golden arms, maintain the fort (Fort, fort, fort)

[Verse 2: U-God]
I'm on a mission, bred from the poorest conditions
Baby fed from the pots, from the poorest of kitchens
Got bread in the streets, from the rawest addiction (Yeah, yeah)
Made a 180 turn, with the Lord's conviction
It's a riding prison (Yeah, yeah)
Keep the iron on my side, to avoid the friction
In this modern day slavery I survived the lynching (Yeah, yeah)
With no rap pension, the price of living is too high
Two jobs working, this nigga is too tired (Yeah, yeah)
No more babies, she needs them tubes tied
Word on the tweets, "I heard he's a new guy" (Yeah, yeah)
“Heard he was too fly”, damn maybe we should get scooped by a new ride (Yeah, yeah)
The ghetto's up in flames, think we should calm down
My insides is evil, you in the wrong town (Town)

[Bridge]
Whatever you want, better watch yourself
Whatever you want, better watch yourself

[Chorus]
Tell, tell golden arms, maintain the fort (Fort, fort, fort)
Tell, tell golden arms, maintain the fort (Fort, fort, fort)
Tell, tell golden arms, maintain the fort (Fort, fort, fort)
Tell, tell golden arms, maintain the fort (Fort, fort, fort)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
