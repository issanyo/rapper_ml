[Intro]
Rock it on
To the break of dawn
Elevation yo

[Verse 1]
Elevation smell the vibration
Mystique beneath the beat cave in
Super freak meaty bone tones discreet
Ganja leave is a sweet sensation
[?egg is I?] forsake
Take over in the making live wire retire all great men
Mic-pope rope-a-dope malicious intention
Broke through your fences now this is the redemption
Nerve wrenching unstoppable high colossal
Tonsil obstacle-able hard to true bobbin
Shopping through no question
Honey I'm sexual intellectual (vamp) rhyming professional
Swing all the ladies in I directional
Potential bright clever and soft
Whatever more encore the shit you adore hard

[Chorus]
'Cause it's hard turbo charge and I'm doing shit my way
Bon Voyage Shaolin dodge nigga I'm going shit my way
Turbo charge nigga it's hard 'cause I'm doing shit my way
Yes it's hard praise to God, nigga I'm doing shit my way
How it sounds now hold it down right down to the ground

[Verse 2]
Pleasure the light mic the treasure strangers in the night
Can't fight the spinning lining of pearl from left to right
Have guns, you will travel Milky Way dripping in the brisk
At your own risk silver shadow
That might lurk in the image in the Pharaoh
When the road gets narrow an hour off after hour
Devour with the power the background amp
Wine your mission to the party mix champ
Wu stamp genie out the lamp cramp sex position
Exposition body count technician
Bets deep rising ask Killa shit
Wax [?] this courage of the fearless Wu enterprise
Sent to risen - Grand prize landslide
Pipe in holy lighting told me I'm frighten
Goldie the only one who boldly speaking that excitement

[Chorus]
'Cause it's hard turbo charge and I'm doing shit my way
Bon Voyage Shaolin dodge nigga I'm going shit my way
Turbo charge nigga it's hard 'cause I'm doing shit my way
Yes it's hard praise to God, nigga I'm doing shit my way
How it sounds now hold it down right down to the ground

[Verse 3]
I feel the earth moving under my feet
I feel the crowd come tumbling down
How it sound all around now
We going to party now hold it down
We going to party-hardy right down to the ground

[Chorus]
'Cause it's hard turbo charge and I'm doing shit my way
Bon Voyage Shaolin dodge nigga I'm going shit my way
Turbo charge nigga it's hard 'cause I'm doing shit my way
Yes it's hard praise to God, nigga I'm doing shit my way
How it sounds now hold it down right down to the ground
