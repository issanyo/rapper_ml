* promotional EP released on Razor Sharp Records in late '97

Chorus: U-God

Hysterical lyrical launch, anotha riddle
A miracle little by little, fits right up the middle
*repeat 2X*

[Cappadonna]
Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW
One culture, return of the track slasher
Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster
Strivin for perfection, the only way I got
My life back was through investin, devotion
Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary
Comin out my ass like shit, to feed my babies
I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money
Be gettin me high just like trees in these tracks
I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good
So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto
Makin love waitin for lost minds to settle
Then I speak out, because we all need the guidance
Deep down inside is where you could define science
My mother told me, when I was so stressed out
"All you gotta do is just put your best out"
And I did it

Chorus 2X

[Cappadonna]
Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid
Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail
Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells
Seen brothers that fell when I slipped
I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin
Y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot
Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance
I broke resistance, every time I step up, I rip reps up
Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks
This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit
It feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe
But y'all cats better believe keep off, your darts are soft
While I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue
You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard
Watch out for city fraud, my darts slam like doors
Makin it hard for you to get yours, selfish

Chorus 2X
