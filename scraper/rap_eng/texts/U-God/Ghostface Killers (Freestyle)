Hey; Ghostface killers (killers), Wu-Tang, 21 news gang
Hey; Ghostface killers (killers), Wu-Tang, 21 news gang

[Verse 1: U-God]
When I was 21 I was savage
Somebody woke up this dragon
Roll up on you with this cannon
I'm the last man that's standing
From the slums buildings that's abandoned
Called multiple blemish
See us on that flash screen, had to deal right out the slammer
That imprest here now (bow dow)
Please stop talking on (SoundCloud)
Get discipline with the Chinese [?]
Get caught with the lyrical (roundhouse)
Warning, watch your foul mouth
My family still down South
Deadly at the melody that bangs your head so heavenly
That 808 is therapy, be burning up that chemistry
Moving around that corner store my team won't need accessories
Nothing but the best, a bitch is kissing on my hairy chest
There's nothing new here still rule the power, still my Gucci sweats
In enormous city, no feelings, no pity
My New York shit, it get cold-heart like a frost-bit titty
Known to be gritty, that New York fitty
Any city in raps, witty unpredictable game, game, game

[Chorus: U-God]
Wu-Tang Killa Bees nothing to fuck with
Park Hill, Milly Rock show them that fuck shit
Hood villains and we still bringing the ruckus
Hood villains and we still bringing the ruckus

[Verse 2: U-God]
I heard that bounce got changed
But the flow remain the same
This little nigga take a giant step them bars cold train
With this ice waters in my veins
Them niggas hate here my name
That's U-G-G-O-D the Allah
Ghostface Killah got hit her with a bra
Sorry if I hit you in the head with these bars
We got two chicks from DR
One for me and my studio engineer
She here with the CPR
And we celebrate a great physical year
Skirt around exotics
Parade wave then hit fourth gear

[Chorus: U-God]
Wu-Tang Killa Bees nothing to fuck with
Park Hill, Milly Rock show them that fuck shit
Hood villains and we still bringing the ruckus
Hood villains and we still bringing the ruckus

[Verse 3: U-God]
I survived them block wars, hot hands and never trembled
Only Olympic pedestal might've been the greatest dream team ever assembles
Such courage under fire, we burn the switches with the lighter
You called that sparkling the night, it's just my queen [?] set fire
That money so satire
We tore those builds, she dance on a wire
Dip nightriders in a deep fryer
Ghostface killers we gon' for higher
