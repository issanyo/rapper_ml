[Intro: Barack Obama]
So climate change can no longer be denied
Years from now, I want to be able to look our children and grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we did everything we could to protect it

[Verse 1: U-God]
Hip-hop is dangerous, should be respected and cherished
Keep it tucked in your pocket for the next to inherit
Sacrifice what I write, Like Martin on the terrace
Dreams have been built, and many of us perished
No pun intended it's a rough path to heaven
So I studied all my lessons, earned a button with a seven
I be a father figure Mr. ?
We ain't go nowhere, we the same legends
The climate of hip-hop since done changed
But the art and the bars will still remain
Feel the wrath of the caine as it travel through your veins
Champagne salute to those who entered the game

[Hook: U-God, (MC Shan)]
We call it
(Hip-hop was set out in the dark)
X2

[Verse 2: U-God]
We need that gangsta music, don't let them filter the spirit
Tell your favorite hot stations in the hood I wanna feel it
The fans support, you bring your brother to tears
Rap glaciers of ice that didn't melt for years
Hip-hop is the monster, Evolution's construct
It seemed compelling to say New York really lost it
So we sat at the table with the top heads and bosses
To save the def jams when the buzzards got exhausted
Bout to drench these niggas, don't let me open up the faucet
Pass the torch, get on my grind and I endorse it
Back from the state pen, cooking with my apron
Cash in the jackpot, introduce the eldest statesmen

[Verse 3: Jackpot Scotty Wotty]
Cash wanna deal, wanna peel back a vocalist
I never slip slide when I ride and I open it
Triple XL on a deal, I'm a poker chip
Thought process, got def for a scholarship
Squeezin' burners, shotgun permits
I buy hood shit, I never cop German
I used to run through life like a blind man
But now I walk like I'm stepping on quicksand
Bully niggas get fully loaded with lead
Jackpot Scot Wot, I'm two steps ahead
Anticipate, don't wait, don't let the bubble drop
Imma lick more shots than a rookie cop

[Hook: U-God, (MC Shan)]
We call it
(Hip-hop was set out in the dark)
X2

(Hip-hop was set out in the dark)
[Outro: Barack Obama]
Years from now, I want to be able to look our children and grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we did everything we could to protect it
