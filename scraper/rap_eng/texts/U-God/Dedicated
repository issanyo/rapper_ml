[Intro: Steve Stoute + Mariah Carey]
That summer... the summer '88 is the best...
But that's your nostalgia though
"Just for the nostalgia," you gotta say
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip-hop music ever
Right

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old-school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh, baby, you know all that lovemaking we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care, say ''yeah, yeah, yeah''
Sing it like I used to do
This one is for me and you, oh

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh, baby, you know
Make love
That’s how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh, baby, you know, that love making we did
Boy, It was so real, I wanna feel that again
Loyal friends from way back then
Tell me can you vision us
36 Chambers high
Feels like we’re there, yeah yeah yeah
Remix of a fantasy, I hear ‘em singing back to me like...

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh, baby, you know
Make love
That’s how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you

[Verse 3: Nas]
Nah, we don’t wish today’s game was old again
We just wish it wasn’t full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Who’s the greatest living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
‘87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about La Di Da Di got inside our bodies
Something about My Adidas coming out the speakers
Used to do the Wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, Moneyearnin’ Mount Vernon
Let’s go

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh, baby, you know
Make love
That’s how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Oh, baby, you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
