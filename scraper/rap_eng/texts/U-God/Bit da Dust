[Intro]
Another one bit the dust
Another one bit the dust
Another one bit the dust
Another one bit the dust
Another one bit the dust, didn't play by the rules
He was fooled for the jewels, then he got stuck
Another one'll eat that, another one, another one, another one
And another one, another one, another one

[Verse 1]
The drama unfolds over diamonds and gold
Hard-knocks cooking rocks nigga over the stove
Low and behold, pet the red note, side bitches be dead those
Hood bitches be love though, let's keep a one eye
Open for them cutthroats, uh-oh
Dollar van, carjack, dirty fingernail rap
In the back of the van, Snoop was Cat's contact
Teterboro tarmac, trust me, I made the money off the rap
You see them platinum plaques? We ain't coming back
Just bought a Lucia for Eric, I ain't forget that
Movie Star Vixens, they're getting smashed from the back
Streets are action pack, the chronicles from the Stat, Stat, Stat
Don't cross the gun line
On of top deck of the boat, getting a shoeshine
Taurus[?] to his feet, cold victory
End up in the wrong side of town, you ain't stickin me

[Hook]
Another one bit the dust
Didn't play by the rules, he was fooled for the jewels
Then he got stuck
Another one, another one, another one
Another one, another one, another one
Yeah
And another one

[Verse 2]
Ayo, freezer burn [?] numb ya gums
Katy Perry swallow the cum, platinum niggas have fun
Bank deposits, walk-in closets
See Robert Diggin', all in my pockets
Shit is nostalgic, take a walk through the projects
Caution: watch out for lead flying objects
For hot-heads, wearing [?] and [?]
Caution: end up on Worldstar content
Intuitive minds are not immune to crime
In these cold hard streets, laws get redefined
What's yours is mine, and what's hers is mines too
Stick 'em, porcupine
Strip you in the back of the [?]
Niggas get smiley faces with rusty razors
She couldn't bury her son, started a fundraiser
Many men bit the dust
Material items don't mean much
Mean mug, survival is a must

[Hook x2]
