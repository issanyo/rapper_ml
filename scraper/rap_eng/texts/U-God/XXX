[Intro]
Hello?
Nigga, pick up your phone!
Why you ain't been answerin' your phone?
Old bitch ass nigga
You is not motherfuckin' Rakim with yo little ass
Answer the phone, nigga
Damn, damn, there she go again
I ain't [?] ass anyway
Just a bitch ass nigga
You got the game fucked up

[Chorus: Method Man]
I'll be here no matter what you do, no matter what you say
I'm havin' problems with a jealous ex
I know she listenin' but F it that
I'll be here no matter what you do, no matter what you say
I know she listenin' but F it that

[Verse 1: U-God]
I'm havin' problems with a jealous ex
Hack my phone, blowin' up my texts
It's like she watchin' when I'm havin' sex
I know you listenin' but fucker that
She always sweatin' who I'm fuckin' next
But she sweatin' out her hair with her friends at the disco tech
I slide through the 'jects and she gets upset
We ain't fucked in years, why you on my neck?
Didn't rock up north with the kid
When he did a bid for bricks and things
What I should've did was never threw the dick on her
Never should've spent on her, steak dinners
Always in the crib with them fake niggas
I'm eight figures, get richer
Thots assure yourself why you hate a winner
On my DM but you just a BM
What you wanna be him? Never that

[Chorus: Method Man]
I'll be here no matter what you do, no matter what you say
I'm havin' problems with a jealous ex
Hack my phone leaving text message after text
It's like she watchin' while I'm havin' sex
I know she listenin' but F it that
I'll be here no matter what you do, no matter what you say
I know she listenin' but F it that

[Verse 2: U-God]
These girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble
The quest for paper keep me locked in the bubble
It's that Richie Rich, scoop it up with a shovel
Took a look at my financial, it's time to double
Would you love it if I crumbled, hahh?
Bet you love it if I stumbled, hahh?
Swear I hate this bitch, I know she follows me
I know this little hood booger wanna swallow me
And I almost caught a felony, she trouble
When she keyed a whip, had a fit, through a brick through the crib
Disrupt my shit 'cause she saw a chick
It ain't shit boom bip, think nothin' of it

[Chorus: Method Man]
I'll be here no matter what you do, no matter what you say
I'm havin' problems with a jealous ex
Hack my phone leaving text message after text
It's like she watchin' while I'm havin' sex
I know she listenin' but F it that
I'll be here no matter what you do, no matter what you say
I know she listenin' but F it that

[Verse 3: Method Man]
She hit 'em, nut, then its seven next
See, I'm just tryin' keep it real, but on the real, I wish we never met
Gettin' them feelings then she get upset
It's been a minute since we had any dealings, what, you ain't get it yet?
Trick, you never should've cheated on the kid but you did
Gave up the rib, you pig
What you shouldda did was
Never shoulda crept on me
Never shoulda lept on me, chow, beat it
'Bout to get some chicken and some side pieces
Mighta even skeeted on that Tempur-pedic
Maybe I'm shady and slim, holy Slim Jesus
You know I mean it, why you holdin' grievance if all you want is penis?
Neva that

[Chorus: Method Man]
I'll be here no matter what you do, no matter what you say
I'm havin' problems with a jealous ex
Hack my phone leaving text message after text
It's like she watchin' while I'm havin' sex
I know she listenin' but F it that
I'll be here no matter what you do, no matter what you say
