[Verse 1: U-God]
When it comes to this rap shit, not a stranger
Not Cedric, but I’m a Entertainer
Game changer, none can match it
I’m a Master, I throw on the green jacket
Takes practice, just to blaze mics
I’m in the best shape of my life
In fights with God vs. Devil
I’mma beat them charges, I’m the hardest rebel
I’m beyond your level, I’m stone and grit
Sit back, let me Quincy Jones this shit
Blown to bits, this is my territory
My biography’s an amazing story
Of blood and streets, love and deceit
Slugs and heat, let the dog off the leash
I’m a free MC, not DMC
No contracts, contact TMZ

[Hook: U-God]
Here I go (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)

[Verse 2: Vast Aire (of Cannibal Ox)]
Listen, I'm the talk of the town
(Who's that?) Vast Aire, I am beyond sound
It doesn't get iller, thrilla in manilla
This is Can Ox, Kool Keith and U-Godzilla
(We about that scrilla) New York's finest
Life's a bitch, so I had to drill her
I'm sick like salmonella
Stupid, I drop albums without no filler
In actuality, the bitch chose me
How you getting mad when that's pimp rule 3
How you getting mad when she called me?
You saw it happen to Tyson, we keep the messages
I don't got beef, I wave my hand
The Original Man from Arabian sands
Bleed twice and my mic is on
This Ox, Tang and Dr. Octagon

[Hook: U-God]
Here I go (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)

[Verse 3: Kool Keith]
Tour bus, Orca, big shark walker
Man with the ammo, y'all bring the grand piano
Fitted hat on, superfly, walk around
Shoot around your town like Hawaii Five-O
Oprah come out your projects, I’m down with The Sopranos
While I’m stealin’ em, head so big like balloon helium
Guns with body suits, energize off poets
See the king of kings, I manage Floyd Mayweather now
Come up to the condominium
And shake hands with the new millennium
Larry and Armstrong insurance, me and U-God
Any rapper come up, better speak to the doorman
Throwing rice on the city, out the Carolina box
Captain hat, finger popping your lady with the Air Nike shots
Heavyweight, dumped around my waist
I took it years ago from John Tate

[Hook: U-God]
Here I go (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)

[Verse 4: Vordul Mega]
Universal verses given through unique ways
And speech forward and rapid
After hooks with an unusual reach
Some fumble unstable on how to receive
But never disputing the mystique
Sudden movements to fecal team
Blew reefer in long-gated hoodies with sneakers
Seeked by these
Secretly informed by agents that speaker these
Within a scenery of G's that move in to speak with me
In vicinity of imagery seen vividly
And absorbed deep within the subconscious
Establishing mentality
Having reality breath
Occurrence as patterns repeat
Endurance is what matters and deems
Kings the wrath from me

[Hook: U-God]
Here I go (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
