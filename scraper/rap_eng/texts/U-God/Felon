[Intro: (Sample),  U-God]
(It is my job to protect society from a person like this. There's two kinds of criminals, one we're mad at, and one we're afraid of. We gotta do the best we can with the criminals we're mad at but the ones we're afraid of, we gotta put them in prison)
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to Mr. 92A3131
From Bare Hill Correctional Facility, and I'm a
[Verse 1: U-God]
Pretty good felon with two counts on
One hand gun smoking on trees with three ounces
Caught in my possession
Been a bit aggressive, since my adolescence, expelled from pre-school
I'm on a mission, cause hard heads never learn a lesson
With two fire arms headed back to corrections
I'm in a jam, need that one call to fam
And I'm grinding my teeth as the cell door slams
Come over at seven now meet the new man
Touchdown on the streets with a modified plan
And I only been home for four weeks
Connected with the block again
Now i'm knocked again, damn

[Hook: U-God]
I'm a felon, walking these streets
I can't breathe, in the eyes of the law and the D's
I'm a felon, walking these streets
I can't breathe
I'm a felon

[Verse 2: U-God]
Up in the cubicle surrounded by criminals
Perpetuate bullshit, remind me of the juveniles
Boxed in, counting to the 23rd hour
With 7 musty niggas in line for the shower
Feel my frustration?
I'm in a fucked up situation
From blowing up trees on probation
And my record just dropped
You can hear it on the E block, on regular rotation
Use imagination
Turn the clock back, should of never moved packs
Shoulda never trust my ex, she talks on the jack
Who's in kahoots with black who stabs me in the back
For a little .22 and a handful of crack
On a quest for Rolls Royces you can make the wrong choices
Second strike, front of judge, don't be voiceless
Sentence you to halfway house, halfway out
Looking for a job and a nice shirt
Constantly reminded

[Hook: U-God]
I'm a felon, walking these streets
I can't breathe, in the eyes of the law and the D's
I'm a felon, walking these streets
I can't breathe
I'm a felon x5
