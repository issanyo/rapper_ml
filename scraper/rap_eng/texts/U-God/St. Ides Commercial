[Verse 1: Method Man]
Oh yeah, comin' through with my Shaolin crew
2 Cent for a Kase, gimme St. Ides brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Meth Tical's in the jam, oh, how dry I am!

[Verse  2: Raekwon]
With St. Ides in my system
Crack another, I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Call me the Wallabee Champ, stressed out, could never be, son
Ricochet daily, hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
That blows in the bushes, St. Ides fill the canteen

[Verse 3: U-God]
Crack the bottle of the St. Ides, sippin' to those who don't realize
That drinkin' ain't only to be drunk
You can't drive, keep my peoples alive
And if the Saint don't know you from a can of paint

[Verse 4: RZA]
It was hot on the spot so I jetted up the block
I saw Akh with St. Ides, I could tell by the dot
On the back he be buildin', not that charcoal filtered
Ice cold bottle tilted, to my cup he spilled it
Ahh, St. Ides, St. Ides ...
