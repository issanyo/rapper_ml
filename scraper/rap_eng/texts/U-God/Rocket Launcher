[U-God]
Yo, yo, yo
I be that rocket launcher that caught ya
Rock of Gibraltar
Spill blood on the altar
Sorcerer
Flyin' saucer in the Porsche
Money exhaust
The enforcer of the lowest bars
Fist of the Northstars
Water on Mars
Thoughts like a porn star, born scarred
War Lord of the snow ball, break dance on cardboard
Fiends gnaw for the raw, mark four
Hard jaw like Mexican, next to win
Crack a Beck's yo I'm vexed again
Next to run, revolving door
Killing floor
Searchin' for the genie's lamp
Arrow in your heart like Beanie Man
Seeded plant full blown
See me vamp
Wolf fangs, full moon
Full spoons of Oxycontin
Catch him at the Roxy
Spot him up in Harlem
Honey with the knocked knees with the foxy bottom
News paper column
Say he's scary
Fuck the fairy ass niggas
Jump back in your rat hole
And throw another hail mary
Style's flurry, I'm the cherry on top
Money phase done lit up
One, two, three up
Your popcorn shrimp, I'm the whole re-up
G's up and hoes down
Fake as the game is
I blow down the whole town
Let off a whole round
Ghetto celeb
One thing's for certain a hundred years from now no one really cares
Smoke threads, Pro Keds, Coke heads, mo-peds
Fiends fight
Peace pipes
Yo I'm outta here
