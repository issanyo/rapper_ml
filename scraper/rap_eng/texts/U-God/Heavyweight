[Verse 1]
Man I'm a giant, call em entertainer
Biggest in the game, money generator
Rugged style innovator, smash all boundaries
I'm in your head, base line keep pounding me
Keep astounding me, capture the moment
I'm your most dangerous opponent
The good shit, yeah, yeah, I'm on it
Stinging up your city like the shaolin hornets
I just been promoted, got my stars and stripes
My heavy duty badges are my scars of life
My anger hit the pen, you know my bars get tight
Fly cars, I want my name In stars and lights
This heavyweight life with the dose of thrills
We pulling in the houses in the Hollywood hills
The God got skills, educated listener
Rap call the W, the MC conditioner
Rap fans listen up, we switchin up and resignate
One man army, your hands in your mental state
Enemies disintegrate, worldwide I captivate
Ieft for a minute, came back like a heavyweight

[Hook]
Got plenty big things under my belt [2x]
Cuz you fucking with a heavyweight
Fuck fucking with a heavyweight, heavyweight
Fuck fucking with a heavyweight
Fucking with a heavyweight

[Verse 2]
I grew up hard, my cards is dealt
Got plenty big things under my belt
Went from the block where the grams would melt
Stopped thru many land, my clan was felt
The grams is hell, and life is good
Went from a strip to a righteous dude
Went from a strip to ringside seats
Egyptians cotton, kings size sheets
Kissed Janet on the cheeks, party with Puff
Roll the tour bus to the finest cities
Rock the whole Europe, touch the finest titties
Collections of fifties, gritties and weed jars
Movie stars and the finer days
Left Eye, Aaliyah and Isaac Hayes
Back in the days, nothing to play with
Wu-Tang Clan, we stayed on your playlist
Shouts to the DJs that made us famous
Written in the books with the hall of famers
Written in stone, next to all the singers
Thanks to the fans, the love you gave us

[Hook]
