[Verse]
This is that tuxedo masterpiece, recorded
In the Master Suites, been plotted since my last release
Surrounded by the best, let's have a feast
Pretty young bitches come dance for me
See the future in my vision, a hustler's convention
Turntables and that microphone, be the invention
You can't monkey wrench 'em, police try to pinch 'em
Made a grand entrance, this is nonfiction
U-God and the streets and we all in hard bottoms
Written in newspaper as folded in four columns
The words are venom, get quoted by top models
The type to swan dive in my personal grotto
Foot on the throttle to the next frontier
Won't stop rocking 'til the Milky Way's near
Mingle, they the floor plans, it's time to get bands
Gave this music is a twist, it's time to re-brand
Increase my revenue with exceptional wordplay
Written to perfection, you could swear it was Scorse'
Sound provided by the incredible Jose
A scientist's own mind, music is cold play
Please take a seat and enjoy my presentation
Came out of hibernation to present my new creation
Hates the motivation amongst the competition
Fangs out, salivating, blast you with venom
