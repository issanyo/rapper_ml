[Verse 1: U-God]
I'm so spectacular
A Valentine's massacre recorded on the 14th
No blood, took the vascular
Cold-blooded coke on with my heart on my sleeve
Fuck rhyming for friends, I do this shit for the cheese
Play my record, how much does it take?
Spin my shit on them plates
What's the wait, ain't I great?
I love them 808s and techno breaks
But I prefer those them dusty crates
U-G comes pure, it's time to elevate

[Hook]
Yo, I see you watchin' me, nigga
It's like the whole world is watching me, nigga
I see you watching me, nigga
The whole world watching me, nigga

[Verse 2: U-God]
Through the lens of a microscope the world stays watchin'
Magnifide ten times to see if I'm alive
Niggas, looking through the peephole, they shot in the eye
Wise guys, you see what happens when you tell them lies?
Cameras on the corners feeling the heat up on my shoulders
A potential ...... (?) tell them police those days is over
The incomes reported, the fans have supported
The guns are now legal and my papers are in order
I bust for my daughter, fuck with her, it's a slaughter
Y'all keep pushin' my limits and my temper is shorter
Situations get dealt with and the whole world's watchin'
I can move like a criminal but you won't get that option
From pennies make porcelain only triples my fortune
Watch your hands in the pot 'cause the product is scorchin'
She smell like good at the auction and the whole world's watchin'
Evil eye stay blind with their soul's awry
But tonight you get a pardon 'cause I'm sitting at the Garden front row with the elite
I had to pass it to my squadron
I don't do this often 'cause in public i'm cautious
You can't fuck with my money, the world is my office

[Hook]
Yo, yo stop watchin' me, nigga
You, you, and you, the whole world watchin' me, nigga
And the whole worlds watching me, nigga
I see you, you, and you watching me, nigga
