[Verse 1]
Boldly go only to sew the block up, lock shit down
Mama told me you the giant
Bump out the nose cold, crime wave wholesome
Baritone throne, so defiant
They stole the science from the O.G
Carbon copy, sloppy, tryna muscle out the Old E
Slapshot, can't get it past the goalie mask
Stonefinger roam, royalty zone off
Henn, gin, rummy stunts coming in sums
Writing on ya tummy hun, low stamina
Still hungry some asthma clogged up
Ran in smog, dialogue, dog plasma
Road hogging all hammers
No matters what's the track's right and exact
It's madness the scanner listen, system jam up
Right on ya rack, Black Panthers on a mission
Right back at you, ready to cook this shit
Babylon apple, natural habitat, stone statues

[Verse 2]
Robotron Golden Arms
Pentagon brain cell, all to gain
Chained to the bumper, Wolfgang hunters
Field goal punters tone, steel toe, eruption
It's a gusher! Domecrusher Smith
Ushered this style stuffing more criminals
Foul up in the Nile, let off a signal with attitude
Magnitude, beat you, me devil lies that's sized of cathedrals
The track more lethal
Came back to see you finish the job off proper
Clobber your shit, spit the lava
The helicopter hit you, flying saucers of course
May the force not be with you, these Bengals that dangle
Sinister phantom menace handsome are my lenses
All in the register, speaking my Spanish
Clips like banana grips, bonanza
Dressed fancy in the club, Halle Berry slow dance
We romance now give me love

[Verse 3]
Jackie Chan movements, hard to kill for real
Drill him some more with some
Old fashion smooth shit, long winded
Splendid the bomb blow, on the whole a ruthless
Butter roll flow, show improvement?
This shit is cool whip to me
When I groove to rule this music with a mule kick
Eight ball in the side pocket corner
One mark the chalk, gimme my pool stick
Smoked the dipped
Notes by the throat, full grip, scud puddy in my hands
Fans, read the blueprints
The truth is, the slang you bit?
To form in a sentence the cold winters I spent with splinters
The apprentice under RZA's training
He sang the I-Ching vintage aiming at you swine eater
Wife-beater scoundrels, stolen vowel thieves
I'm swollen now, Colin Powell relief
Throw the towel in, tools in, full spin, school 'em again
Show 'em that the wise could rejuvenate
All these hoodlums, don't sleep he could win
Pull a pen, it's full again, celeb, all in the web on a
Conquest, no disturbance
Address it to ya chest, you're in turbulence
Mighty men vitamin D
Rest in Peace to my nigga Bigga B, love you G
Rest in Peace to my nigga Bigga B, love you G
