[Hook: U-God]
You know when you see that
See that, feel that
Unstoppable
So unstoppable that
You know when you see that
See that, feel that
Unstoppable
So unstoppable

[Verse 1: U-God]
Payed that price for my name in lights
Better roll that dice
To excel to a level, get to hold that might
Late studio sessions, who sleeps at night?
Breathe smoke from the bonfire
Create words that are frying at the empire
Longevity creates enemies
My legacy will live on at the Kennedys
Camelot, hip-hop, find it at the thrift shop
Store it in a zip-loc
Distribute it on street blocks, for the world to hear
Tell the world "Then, here, it's the world premiere"
That
I said no trivia
When I sold the bolivia raw
Shit was pure from the heart, uncut from the start and I couldn't get rid of her
She put me in a whirlwind, everything good, again
I'm in the place in the space where I should've been
Worldwide with the standing o
With the house life down, you can see that, feel that

[Hook: U-God]
You know when you see that
See that, feel that
Unstoppable
So unstoppable that
You know when you see that
See that, feel that
Unstoppable
So unstoppable

[Verse 2: U-God]
On the FDR, sunroof, retractable
Redbone and they copping liquor so natural, this is factual
Can't find it glow in any manual
And who will claim king in this wicked ass chess game
Spread love, that'd be the best thing
Burn that sour shit, till your chest stings
While the vest thing lay up in the West Wing
Cars and homes stress free
Tahiti bitches with a drink on top of me
I'm all over the bread, poppy seeds
My independent philosophies
Now what the hell of a prophecy
All the things that I got to see
From a broken home to a home of belief
All praise to the father for the in and out, breathe

[Hook: U-God]
You know when you see that
See that, feel that
Unstoppable
So unstoppable that
You know when you see that
See that, feel that
Unstoppable
So unstoppable
