[Hook]
Watch out, here it come, that's the spirit, son
I can feel it in the air, I'm feeling young
Not here to fight, we call it fun
Allah gave me light, real strong
Meet me at the top, near dawn
Damn right, nope, we always kill songs

[Verse 1]
Mamma gave birth, righteous seed
Tension in the hood, it's alright with me
Flows laid down with lightning speed
The track game good, it's alright with me
I'ma keep dropping albums, each year
Fold y'all niggas, beach chair
I told y'all niggas, it's heat here
Watch how y'all step, watch your feet there
You blocking the shine of the chief here
It's Keynote Speaker, leap year

[Hook]
Watch out, here it come, that's the spirit, son
I can feel it in the air, I'm feeling young
Not here to fight, we call it fun
Allah gave me light, real strong
Meet me at the top, near dawn
Damn right, nope, we always kill songs

[Verse 2]
Relentless, hustle, respect the fullest
I'm ready, set, see my extra bullets
I'm on deck, see, I'm next to do it
My nest is blooming, my heart is fuming
What you expect, man? The God is human
I'm next to do it, my brain is fluid
This is my anger, it's chamber music, now
Here we are, to spank and bruise it, now
Middle finger, if you think we lose it
But you like it 'cause you choose it
You can't coach me out my style
I'm the millennium poster child
Put in years, move at a slow pace
As I watch y'all spit with no taste

[Hook]
Watch out, here it come, that's the spirit, son
I can feel it in the air, I'm feeling young
Not here to fight, we call it fun
Allah gave me light, real strong
Meet me at the top, near dawn
Damn right, nope, we always kill songs
