My first born son, I call you my number one son
You came a long way and for a long time you were doing your music
It wasn't easy for you, you dodged hard drugs, real bullets and paper (?) bullets
You even dodged being a statistic on these ..... (?)
But you stayed the course
You planted your seed and I watched them grow
I remember when you first started out
You told me about your plans, about your music, and what you and your friends were doing
I didn't believe you, I didn't encourage you, or discourage you

[Verse 1: U-God]
On a quest for the relish to feed the people I cherish
The good and bad I inherit
Eatin' healthy, keep the brain cells nourished to flourish
Take it all, work hard 'til the day that I perish
I wish I could go back in time and find my first book of rhymes
And publish it 'cause death is a crime
And that page that I ripped out back in '89
Written in red ink, damn, what a line
It's not easy gettin' kicked out the booth after fifteen tries then I came with the truth
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Olympic torch flamin', ten-million sold
Not bad for a chippa who just came home to make moms proud
The initial goal
I'm on now, time to conquer the globe

[Hook: U-God]
Look mom I'm on top of the world
Look mom I'm on top of the world
Look mom I'm on top of the world
Look mom I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2: U-God]
And to all my park killers slash villains
My cohorts, and caharts in front the ooh buildin' (Moms they shootin')
Grab all your children to the .... (?) staircase, Wu stickers on the ceilin'
Late night helping baby girl with her homework
Sittin' on kitty chairs, magic marker just won't work
Baby Mom's face fightin' on the couch in some pink shorts
The sacrifice of bein' on top of this rap sport
Kiss her on the cheek, tell her I love her
The fortune and the fame I bring home in the fourth-quarter
Tears shed in the back of the tour bus
Started with nine niggas and the DJ and just us
You see the .... (?) is high-tailin' through Tokyo
What a wild rodeo, I built my portfolio
Dante's got a new car thinkin' he's cool
Meet the first of the Hawkins to graduate film school
Fresh blue and whites on his way to the Air Force
Maleek's grown up and he knows I be there for him
Consolidate my time between my life and my rhymes
Baby girl's gonna grow up right before my eyes
God bless my child, time flies with a smile
Gotta cherish the moment 'til i walk her down the aisle

[Hook: U-God]
Look mom I'm on top of the world
Look mom I'm on top of the world
Look mom I'm on top of the world
Look mom I'm on top of the world
