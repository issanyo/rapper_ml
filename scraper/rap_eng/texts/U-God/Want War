Intro
[U-God]:
'Livia
Raw, I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Cocaine straight from from Bolivia
Co-cocaine straight from Bolivia
Co-co-cocaine straight from Bolivia

[Rolla-D]
Straight from Bolivia (Suave!)
Cocaine straight from Bolivia
(Rolla-D, fuck with me or not at all, nigga)

Verse 1 [Rolla-D]:
You don't want to contest my God Complex
'Cause you'll get blessed
Bloah, you're relieved of your stress
Old school Smith and Wess' with a brand new Tech
Old school sex with my ex in a brand new dress
I'm off it
Do this too often to ever think that I lost it
I'm selfish
I want an orphan to support me on the regular
Saints do something secular
Fuck with me in my area
No monster, something scarier
Skeleton, schizophrenia
Oh no, now my skeleton's on the move
Like gelatin on a spoon
The elephant's left the room
A little bit out of my element
Could tell a bit by the tune
Please remember the ty-, if you ever call me a coon
I'm mixing out my Logic
It's a preposterous concoction
Fuck it, ain't got no options
I'm Carmello with the Rockets
On point like John Stockon
Niggas know it, like a prophet
It's 'bout time that I stop it
Let's end with something melodic

Break
[Esé Michael the Mighty Maverick]:
I want war, nigga

Verse 2 [Esé Michael the Mighty Maverick]:
My conscious trading comments with societal illiterates
My condescension ceases to be, aspects congenital
Took my soul, let it go, an act I found too pivotal
In finding my nirvana, punk persona taken literal
Rap without the lyricism, whack and I'm still hearing them
Viracocha been visceral, racing vices, Vélirium
Y'all need to stop, y'all in communal delirium
What it means to be a poet, my condolences for weary men
My merriment is found in the misanthropic catastrophes
Love actually does tax a fee
My commissions are dastardly
This bastard beat does lavishly fashion my mindset actually
Jazz now needs non-whack emcee to smack, repeat, and pass the beat
It's bad if we unnaturally as blacks conform to average things
Trading out the knowledge and the history for savagery
I'm proud bring what happening in indie for the mass to see
Cut from a different cloth, 'cause in the hood there is no Tapestry
Everyone is suffering, even these rich folks
Everyone is suffering, I'm still getting rich though
They don’t wanna see if I’m clearing a clip though
Not Crip walking then the opposition popping calypso
Like kill Moe, put your shit on chill Moe
Cause my nigga got no heart
Big crip rey kill Moe
I been in the field though
Hopping plantations
You say I'm a house nigga just because I made it?
Because I’m speaking they language?
Boy that’s first world problems
I’m building back all these relations, giving praise to the impoverished
Been debating with scholars
Done graduated with honors
Thrown mad haters some dollars
My foes proud like they fathers
Mandela clear the mándala
My head clearer than water
My ambitions as a rider
Got my daughter into Harvard and my BM draped in Prada like it's nada
You think I see niggas for sport?
Fuck keeping a score
Nigga, I want war!
