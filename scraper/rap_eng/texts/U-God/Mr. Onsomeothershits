[U-God]
The blade is much colder
Slaughter house lava shit boiling
Point molten rocky mountain
Cocky guitian string four star ninja claw to the jaw of course
You know the force the war I bring cut sting
Before I snub nose 'em cement toes them to death
The core scuff 'em some more
Then I hose 'em down some more
The braveheart slave
Whirlwind all in the all I
Might tip slip or stagger
Yo but I won't fall
Iron body be my hobby bending you bastards
Bio rhythem fly so now
Blowin' a gasket shell toe
Elbow slow gun ho pro
Methods of Mayhem mantis
First bury your face in the canvas quick
Then I vanish
