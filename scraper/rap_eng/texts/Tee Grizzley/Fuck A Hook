[Intro - Tee Grizzley]

Ay man i feel like, i feel like fuck a hook man, fuck a chorus
Know what i'm sayin', we just gon' go, we in beast mode R.I.P. rock nigga
-
Ay, i told bro to have a safe trip
This shit we doin' you get retired off of 8 flips
So many numbers we get closed after days' shift
Y'all niggas play a lot, just don't play with this (aah)

[Verse 1 - Tee Grizzley]

'Cause the AR gone' hit everything the "K" miss
Ain't got time to count this money, nigga weigh this
Superhero in these streets, i need a cape and shit
Save the nigga save money, never save the bitch
-
You just gotta quarter package came
This shit's so low you think it's fake
Bro say kill em', i say bro you think we ain't
Landlord in the earth and you can't stay nigga bwah
I can tell you why these bitches don't get bored with us
'Cause we litty and we do it Biggie like Notorious
Got some bad bitches from New York with us
Brand new diamond link it got more pointers than the Warriors
Y'all lil' niggas peasants
No money "B" cause y'all ain't got no principles or ethics
I call them killers and say 'Christmas'
They gone' light up some trees, then gift wrap 'em like a present
Lil' Baby have you ever seen a shootin' star?
Well you just did, i'ma shooter that turned to a star
Generation 5, givin' niggas bald fades
I'll hit your block and cut everybody like i got all spades
-
I don't know how long we been beefin'
But let's see how long the clip last
I'm a big nigga, i ain't got a six-pack
But she wanna ride all day, like she at Six Flags, zero cap
Still ridin' with them drums, we be in the slums
I'm a felon, if they flick us, bro hop out and run
I'ma tell 'em you owe child support, that's why you ran
I don't know why niggas play when they know how it's land
It ain't from the bottom of your heart, why you say it?
If you know that you ain't bout to hit your target, why you sprayin'?
Niggas be playin, my dog played me
I saw that shit comin' before it happened, That's So Raven
Did everything for niggas, they did everything but thank me
I was sittin' in that cell doin' everything but complaining
Accepted what came with it, before i did it
That's what separate me from these niggas, no cappin' these lyrics aye
I set your boots on fire like you run to fast
Niggas hot like fire cause i ran it up too fast
Y'all go broke on all that jewelry, we gone tuck this cash
Cut the lights off, if i see it i'ma cum too fast
We get ours, get out the way we don't be greedy for it
Made a million off that run, you ain't even know it
We don't wanna fuck your hoes, it's too easy for us
We ain't clickin' up with niggas, y'all too skeechy for us
Niggas in the streets know us, they don't play with us
What i think about your new chain, your jeweler play too much
They look at us like Office Max, nigga we paper'd up
We got cake like we got baker plugs (aah)
