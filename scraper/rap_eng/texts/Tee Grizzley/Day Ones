[Chorus]
Rest in peace my day ones (Rest in peace, my niggas)
Wish I could have saved y'all (wish I could have saved my niggas)
Hand on my AR (on my AR)
I ain't goin' out like Trayvon (goin' out like Trayvon)
Free all of my day ones (tell 'em free my niggas)
System take my niggas' lives away (niggas, stole their life away)
Be patient, it's gon' take time
But get yourself together 'fore that out day

[Verse 1]
They wonder why my heart is so numb
I saw so much when I was so young
When I look back, man I was so dumb
Shoulda used that game that I soaked up
But nigga, my streets, you can't play on
Young nigga get that weight gone
.45 hit your face
I bet that impact crack your face bones
Say young nigga get your cake loan
Fuckin' leave, we don't stay long
Founders of the streets with potential
And built them blocks like Legos
With a bad bitch, she Brazilian (what's up, baby?)
911, no ceilings
Know I'm chasin' after a million (take off on them niggas, huh?)
Put them fuck niggas in my rearview
Hollow tips at your temple
Rest in peace 'cause you can't heal 'em

[Chorus]
Rest in peace my day ones (Rest in peace, my niggas)
Wish I could have saved y'all (saved my niggas)
Hand on my AR (on my AR)
I ain't goin' out like Trayvon (goin' out like Trayvon)
Free all of my day ones (tell 'em free my niggas)
System take my niggas' lives away (niggas, stole their life away)
Be patient, it's gon' take time
But get yourself together 'fore that out day

[Verse 2]
Nigga, rest in peace, my old man (I'm doin' it for you, my nigga)
He always told me be my own man (I'm doin' it for you, my nigga)
These niggas switchin' on their day ones
I'd rather be out here with no friends
We got drums, even on the handguns
Hundred shots on that AK
Few of my niggas got Instagram
All of my niggas got JPays
I make sure their books straight
They don't gotta fuck with them state trays
For Rondo I'ma go that way
Tae I'ma do the same thing
Rest in peace to Mario (I'm doin' it for you, my nigga)
They killed him right before my b-day (I'm doin' it for you, my nigga)
Back of his head, he died instantly
They couldn't even look him in his face
That's why I don't fuck with everybody
I stick to my own team
Tell the truth on every track
Hop in this bitch and my soul bleed
Cut niggas off like Jay Z
Shoot shit like Kobe
Niggas sneak dissin', don't know me
Then come around and try to bro me
Won't never tell you what I think
Always tell you what I know
Ain't competent, fake weak nigga
We can never even have a convo
ISIS members on speed dial
Have 'em run up on you with the bomb on 'em
I'ma die by what I stand for
I ain't scared to stand on my own
They tell you what you wanna hear
They only teach what they want you to know
I done seen my niggas drop like flies (rest in peace, my niggas)
So don't be spooked I got this uzi on
In the studio like

[Chorus]
Rest in peace my day ones (Rest in peace, my niggas)
Wish I could have saved y'all (saved my niggas)
Hand on my AR (on my AR)
I ain't goin' out like Trayvon (goin' out like Trayvon)
Free all of my day ones (tell 'em free my niggas)
System take my niggas' lives away (niggas, stole their life away)
Be patient, it's gon' take time
But get yourself together 'fore that out day

[Outro]
.45 black like Akon
Choppa screamin' like Lil Jon
Glock 9 on my waistline
I dare a nigga try to take mine
Know some niggas who fake now
Can't look me in my face, nah
Be [?] in my circle
My niggas is kings now
Rest in peace my day ones
Wish I could have saved my niggas
Rest in peace my day ones
Wish I could have saved my niggas
