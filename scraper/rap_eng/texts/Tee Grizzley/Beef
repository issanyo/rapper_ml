[Intro: Tee Grizzley]
Helluva made this beat, baby
Haa
Meek, you got your strap?
Ain't nothin' to talk 'bout
Let's get it

[Hook: Tee Grizzley & Meek Mill]
I don't sleep on no beef
We ain't sleeping on these niggas
You know I'm on top of everything, nigga (Lurking)
I come on your street
We're just creeping on these niggas (Yeah)
Fuck talking, let that metal bang, nigga
Murk 'em
I don't squash no beef
We ain't throwing no flags
I was taught to handle everything, nigga (Handle that)
I don't play with  no beef
We ain't play with no pussy
Run in his crib and kill everything living, you hear me? (Brr)

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
If I wanted a nigga gone, he a dead man (He through)
Say my name on his song, he a dead man (That's your ass)
Tryna hide behind your niggas, that's your man's ass (nigga)
I leave his whole body bloody, call him Red Man
Hit the club in them Audi trucks and threw bands
Don't get it twisted, bitch, we still got them Scooby Doo vans (Still slidin')
Fuck with me, I'ma come to where you stayin'
And walk in your house with big shit like I'm finna move in
(Tell that bitch, we in this bitch)
Let me say that I don't wanna see you bustlin' (Kill the niggas)
Niggas in your backyard and on your front grass (We here)
And then don't shot cribs, they gon' give you one chance
Like nigga, come outside or we gon' come in, boy

[Hook: Tee Grizzley & Meek Mill]
I don't sleep on no beef

When we wack 'em, shit Obama prolly gon' know about it (Brr)
Load the chopper, crack the window when we rollin' by (There it go)
Fuck a drive-by, run 'em down so we know we got 'em (Hit 'em)
Know we chopping, test 'em and we leave you Holy Bible (Woo)
All this money got me thinking what I owe my rivals (Pussies)
A nigga said we tried to squash it then you know he lyin' (Fall)
I told my youngin' grab that rifle, set that boy on fire (Brr)
Couple niggas used to be with us, we ain't make it to they funeral, they said that we did it
If we make it through the summer, we gon' leave niggas (Like what?)
Like it's auto with that auto, we gone squeeze niggas (Facts)

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
I see the fear in your face, nigga (Lying)
And ain't no turning back, I got my mind made, nigga (For real)
I chase nigga, eliminate niggas (Ayy)
Tell 'em Leek, that lemon squeeze ain't  for lemonade, nigga (No)
I ain't no hatin' ass nigga, but I hate niggas (Hate 'em)
What they gone do, that doctor ain't got shit to save niggas (It go)
I'm through the city in that Range with my thang, nigga (On my momma)
Say my name and get banged, that's on gang, nigga (Gang, gang, gang)

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
Still putting Draco's on the plane, nigga (Draco)
Stopped the PJ in your city, we ain't playin' nigga (Skurt)
Heard he sneak dissing, seen him, what you sayin', nigga (What you sayin'?)
Lost of memory, him must have had them Xans in him (On them Xans)
Still ride SRTs with the yams in 'em (SKurt)
Rental in my cousin's name with the grams in him
Catch his homie out in traffic, that's your man, nigga? (That's your man?)
He say he don't fuck with you and he a fan of us, pussy

[Verse 5: Tee Grizzley]
These niggas tweet a lot, these niggas text alot
What they gone do when I pull up and make em' catch a lot?
Blue beam on that choppa Kamehameha
I throw them dragon balls at you like I'm Kakarot (boom, boom, boom)

[Verse 6: Meek Mill]
Circle through your hood, where your crew at? (Where your crew, nigga?)
Send your whole squad a message like a group text (Uh, brr)
Hit your dawg 20 times, nigga, you next (You next)
Squeeze that Glock until my trigger finger blue-black (Bow)

[Hook: Tee Grizzley & Meek Mill]
