[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
"Tee an industry nigga (he a rat)
He ain't go fire no shots (he rappin')
That nigga be tourin' and makin' millions (he a rapper)
He ain't gon' plot on the opps" (he a rapper)
"He be with J-Rock and Dorey (Jack Boys)
Them nigga gon' rob him, watch (they snakes)
When he gon' to sleep, and wake back up, he ain't gon' find his watch" (they gon' get em)
"I'm Tee Grizzley uncle (Chuck)
I taught him how to rap like that (I raised him)
I ain't fuck wit him in prison (Fuck that)
But he ain't gotta act like that (He changed)"
"I heard he can't go on the Eastside ([?] too)
I heard he ain't into it wit his squad
I heard all that shit got squashed
I heard he got tension wit Rayquan (Wit them TOC boys)
I'm Tee Grizzley cousin"
"I'm Tee Grizzley auntie (Tammy)
I ain't fuck wit him in three years (you was straight)
Ain't send him no letters or money (you was good)
Ever since he came home (He changed)
That nigga be actin' like fuck me (He changed)
I know I ain't hold him down (He changed)
But he did the crime it wasn't me"
"I'm Tee Grizzley's killa, for bro I gon' get on all niggas (on my mama)
They in the feelin' 'cause he ain't fuckin' wit em (Fuck them niggas)
And they can't call that nigga (All them niggas wrong)
But he couldn't call them niggas (You know what time it is)
He look out for all his niggas
Even after he fallout wit em. Keep tell him, "Bro, fuck all them niggas"
For real nigga"

[Interlude: Lil Durk]
Aye look, I can't even lie, bro, you know that shit 'bout me too, you know (on God)
Aye, this the type a shit come when you them niggas, boy (on God)
Real fuckin' vultures, you hear me (on God)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Why Durk be hangin' wit Reese (he a snake)
Heard Durk can't go on his block (me too)
He be in all typa drama (on God)
I heard he got Varney shot (do, do, do)
How Durk BD for real? (300)
He ain't shit like his pops (Big Durk)
His daddy a gangster for real (gangster)
He got a baby with thots (he trippin')
How the fuck he shine like that?
He think he better than us (on God)
I think he fucked that opp bitch (eater)
She tried to set him up (too close)
He tryna rap like Meek (I swear)
Why he sing like he Future? (he do)
He should've signed with Keef (he should've of)
He probably be like Future (tweakin')
I think Durk fell off (he did)
I could book him cheap (3k)
But that 2.5 (yeah)
And that tape wit Tee (damn)
That shit gon' bring him back (it is)
He might bond out 9 (on my kids)
I think he left him hangin' (he did)
When he got rich or signed (hahaha)
Beef for real, he got beef for real
Catch him lackin', that's a insta kill
Rob him, shoot him 'til he dead now
'Cause he flexin' on Instagram
His new bitch bad (who India?)
I heard he fuck wit dude (for real)
I should DM that (send it to Durk)
'Cause that's probably the truth
