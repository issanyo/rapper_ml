[Intro: Tee Grizzley]
Want to hear all their preachin', man, look
It's a difference between preaching and speaking from experience
(We give 'em hope)
We the one's movin' around them trenches man (We give 'em hope)
I got them niggas woke, man (We give 'em hope)
I give them niggas hope, man (We are the hope)
Make sure you tell them (Tell 'em)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Oh), pray up (Oh)
Motivate the trenches (Motivate the trenches)
We got 'em woke (We got 'em woke)
Street niggas winnin' (Street niggas winnin')
We give 'em hope (We give 'em hope)
Motivate the trenches (Motivate the trenches)
We got 'em woke (We got 'em woke)
Street niggas winnin' (Street niggas winnin')
We give 'em hope (We give 'em hope)

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
We live in the days where niggas do shit
Without even thinkin' about it (Thinkin' about it)
But who am I to talk?
Blew 50k without thinkin' about it (Thinkin' about it)
Beefin' wit' niggas about shit so stupid
We shouldn't be beefin' about it
If you in high school, I encourage you
Go try to make it to college (Go try to make it)
Got niggas in prison
Your body locked up, don't let your mind be
Daydream, make a plan, write it out
Don't forget that your mind free
Don't let that wasted time be a waste of time
That's how niggas get back in chains
Bro only 5'8 but he run up and bang on you like he 'Bron James
Fuckin' up the money, steady buyin' chains (Steady buyin' chains)
But this what I wanted
Bust down Rollie, AP, shit feel good and look good, don't it?
I got the ball, got hit, fumbled
Picked it back up, scored six on 'em
Did a field goal with the Louis kicks on 'em
Said I would lose, got the win on 'em like

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Oh), pray up (Oh)
Motivate the trenches (Motivate the trenches)
We got 'em woke (We got 'em woke)
Street niggas winnin' (Street niggas winnin')
We give 'em hope (We give 'em hope)
Motivate the trenches (Motivate the trenches)
We got 'em woke (We got 'em woke)
Street niggas winnin' (Street niggas winnin')
We give 'em hope (We give 'em hope)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I'm in the trenches (I'm in the trenches)
I give 'em hope (Hope, hope)
I get 'em books (I get 'em books)
I get 'em coats (Coats, coats)
They fuck wit' the kid (Fuck wit' the kid)
I'm the adult
Bitch, I'm the father figure, nigga the coach
Fuck a result, I want revolt
You want the bow ties, well you need a co-sign
And I'm at your bowtie, since you let Bettie Jones die
Gotta go hit up Kofa, then I go hit the folks (Huh!)
Then I go hit up Sosa, gotta hitcha from both sides
Get the Zulu and show sides and I gotta ride shotgun
Ain't no fun when you ghost ride, tell the mayor I'm gon' slide
And the city my co-pilot, nothin' but a lil' more mileage
You don't want the type of smoke I lift (huh! Huh!)
Show these bitches overprofilin'

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Wake up), wake up, pray up (Pray up), stay up
Wake up (Oh), pray up (Oh)
Motivate the trenches (Motivate the trenches)
We got 'em woke (We got 'em woke)
Street niggas winnin' (Street niggas winnin')
We give 'em hope (We give 'em hope)
Motivate the trenches (Motivate the trenches)
We got 'em woke (We got 'em woke)
Street niggas winnin' (Street niggas winnin')
We give 'em hope (We give 'em hope)
