[Chorus: Cash Click Boog & Tee Grizzley]
Bitches barely noticed me when it was bad
Now the tables turned and I sit back and laugh
Key to the Rolls, key to the pad, key to the bag
I got the keys to the streets, don't get a key put on your ass
Bitches barely noticed me when it was bad
Now the tables turned and I sit back and laugh
Key to the Rolls, key to the pad, key to the bag
I got the keys to the streets, don't get a key put on your ass

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
Bro just popped a pill, it ain't no Tylenol
When he off them bitches he ain't got it all
Nigga if this chopper get to striking off
Your whole team gon' run like the quarterback just hiked the ball
With my slimes, them my niggas, you get slithered
Can't shake my past, I still smell like the trenches
Lot of scars on my legs from jumping fences
But you know I wasn't runnin' from no niggas
None of these hoes special, none of these bitches different
Bentley 350, watch it clean sixty
Say I fucked a scam, so I rock with them pros, it got tempting
Niggas not no killers, it don't count, he just got injured
I sit back and laugh, used to play with the cash
I can't do that now, it's too much of a mess
Threw her on this page, boy that bitch a whore
Last song I made, I hope they'll play that bitch in court

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog & Tee Grizzley]
Bitches barely noticed me when it was bad
Now the tables turned and I sit back and laugh
Key to the Rolls, key to the pad, key to the bag
I got the keys to the streets, don't get a key put on your ass
Bitches barely noticed me when it was bad
Now the tables turned and I sit back and laugh
Key to the Rolls, key to the pad, key to the bag
I got the keys to the streets, don't get a key put on your ass

[Verse 2: Cash Click Boog]
I'll lay it up and shoot three on your ass
Designer shoes hit me for a P and a half
We in the Wraith, I got the gun, Tee goin' fast
He put a crew on your head then we gon' be on your ass niggas
Bitches barely noticed me when I ain't have no cash
Now they know to fuck with me they gotta have a bag
Shafe got a pole on him, he'll do you bad
Me and Dilla worth a check, nigga do the math
You see a body on nineteenth, I probably left that
Later we gon' double back like where the rest at
In the kitchen whippin' up, where my chef at?
Southwest, y'all ain't fuckin' with us and I bet that
Rock in here right now, he got a blower with him
Mozz got a shorter fuse, he'll ho a nigga
You ain't my motherfuckin' dog, I don't know you nigga
Back then when I was down bad y'all ain't know a nigga

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog & Tee Grizzley]
Bitches barely noticed me when it was bad
Now the tables turned and I sit back and laugh
Key to the Rolls, key to the pad, key to the bag
I got the keys to the streets, don't get a key put on your ass
Bitches barely noticed me when it was bad
Now the tables turned and I sit back and laugh
Key to the Rolls, key to the pad, key to the bag
I got the keys to the streets, don't get a key put on your ass
