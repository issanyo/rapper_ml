[Chorus]
While everybody talkin' down, I'm up, bitch
I ain't goin' broke, I'm stuck rich (oh, I'm stuck)
Call your bitch, like, pull up and do that one shit (pull up)
Talk to her while I fuck, make her cum quick (you like that)
AP, new freezer, I'm too lit (I'm lit)
All my haters need a hospital, they too sick (them niggas too sick)
I put my chains in the freezer, they too lit (they icy)
Somebody get them boys a hospital, they too sick

[Verse]
If a nigga talk crazy, hit that kill switch (go get it)
How you hate a nigga that do all real shit (real nigga)
My lil' brother comin' home to a mil' ticket (welcome home)
The people get me in that room, I ain't gon' spill shit
All the real bitches think I'm heaven sent (heaven sent)
My lil neph' growin' up, he turned 11 quick
But he can't drink none of this pop because it's medicine
I had to get rid of my .40, that bitch evidence
How Tee a gangsta? He stole laptops
After First Day Out got down, he ain't gon' be back hot
Don't think I'm gangsta when you see, test it, watch this MAC pop
In that drop-head, tell my haters suck a fat cock
I ain't good at sellin' drugs, I done tried it (I tried it)
I'm too lazy for scales, bitch, I tried it (I done tried it)
I got rich off tellin' stories how my life went (real shit)
Bring the loyalty, one hundred, bitch, we locked in (real shit)
In that cell musty, couldn't believe myself (God damn)
Lawyer wasn't doin' shit, I had to free myself (nigga fired him)
Pops left the world earlier, had to teach myself (RIP)
Niggas out here lookin' crazy, they should see theyself (niggas crazy)
I know bro would give me half if I needed it
Bro cool but that boy'll turn demon quick
'Cause, when it's beef, make sure you don't sleep on that (What up Beau)
My dawg tried to line me up, he think I'm sleep on that
While you niggas talkin' down, I'm up, bitch (bitch I'm up)
I ain't goin' back broke, I'm stuck rich (hey, we stuck)
He tried to hide her but I still hit that dumb bitch (dumb bitch)
One night and then I'm done with that punk bitch (bitch get outta here)
Only one of me but ho, I'm doublin'
I put his mans in the morgue, I know he double sick
Ask about me in the clubs, nigga, I double tip
I'm runnin' shit, whoever don't like it, suck a dick (big money)
Bitch, when you see a boss keep twerkin' (keep twerkin')
Keep doin' that and you gon' be my next purchase (yeah)
60 racks to NZ for this choker, I can merch it (yeah)
Ass so soft, titties right, you perfect (yeah)
Pussy so wet it make waves, we surfin' (hol' up)
Nigga in your DM three times, he thirsty (thirsty)
Used to be broke, catchin' buses, I was bummin'
Now when bitches see me out they like, "It's a husband" (it's a husband)
Girl don't thank for that cash, it's just money (it's just money)
Don't even thank me for that bag, it ain't nothin' (it ain't nothin')
He don't buy bags, who he foolin'?
That nigga bag little, he ain't tryna blow through it (haha)
You got a table full of niggas but it's one plate (it's only one plate?)
I don't even fuck with Unk and even old Ye' (hoe ass nigga)
This old nigga told me, boy, you should love hate
'Cause nigga you wouldn't be poppin' if they wasn't hatin'
Hold up, when I was broke I never blamed God (thank you Lord)
That's why every back end, I thank God (God I love you)
They said I wouldn't make it but they ain't God (they just talkin')
That's why I say, "Ain't it a blessing," gotta claim God (Ain't it a blessing)

[Chorus]
And while you niggas talkin' down, I'm up, bitch
I ain't goin' broke, I'm stuck rich
Call your bitch, like, pull up and do that one shit (bitch pull up)
Talk to her while I fuck, make her cum quick
AP, new freezer, I'm too lit (lit)
All my haters need a hospital, they too sick (sick)
I put my chains in the freezer, they too lit (them bitches lit)
I put his mans in a hospital, he too sick (them niggas sick)
While you niggas talkin' down, I'm up, bitch (yeah we up)
I ain't goin' broke, I'm stuck rich (yeah we stuck)
Call your bitch, like, pull up and do that one shit (hey pull up)
Talk to her while I fuck, make her cum quick
AP, new freezer, I'm too lit (too lit)
All my haters need a hospital, they too sick (too sick)
Put my chains in the freezer, they too lit (they too lit)
I put his mans in a hospital, he too sick (they too sick)
