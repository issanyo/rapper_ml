[Intro: PnB Rock & Tee Grizzley]
What's that?
Pulled up in some shit, they be like "What's that?"
Young nigga got a check fast
Helluva Beats baby
Raaa!

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Tee Grizzley]
'Member when I had a bus pass (Pass)
I just pulled in LA and I got jet lag (Vroom)
Lil' bitch gave me her number, I might text back (Huh)
I just blew a hunnid K and I ain't stress that
Yuh, young nigga got a check fast (Fast)
I just pulled up in some shit, they be like "What's that?" (Vroom)
I just bought a new AP, I had to flash that (Raaa)
You don't know me, do not post me, better stop that (Raaa)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
Drop the top 'cause it's hot, we in some city blocks (Skrt)
She asked if I'm solo, no bitch I'm wit' the chop (Braaa)
'Cause the [?] sorta scene talkin' 'bout givin' top (Suck it)
No safety on this Glock so it ain't safe to be a opp (Boom!)
She a thot, she look basic, I'ma pass (I'ma pass)
A hunnid on two hunnid grams, cut the bag (Cut the bag)
I remember my hustle was cuttin' grass
Shoot a Jackboy in his face, he gon' need another mask (Boo, boo)
She can see my chain from across the club, no cap
You cold and I'm rich
We talked enough, let's get on that (You talked the nut)
Niggas in here lookin' tough, they don't want that (Naw)
Twenty racks up by your soul, nigga know that (Raaa)

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
'Member when I had a bus pass (Pass)
I just pulled in LA and I got jet lag (Vroom)
Lil' bitch gave me her number, I might text back (Huh)
I just blew a hunnid K and I ain't stress that
Yuh, young nigga got a check fast (Fast)
I just pulled up in some shit, they be like "What's that?" (Vroom)
I just bought a new AP, I had to flash that
You don't know me, do not post me, better stop that (Braaa)
Oh yeah

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Dropped the top on that Mclaren, got them niggas starin' (Skrt)
I'm wit' T Glizzy and 2 bitches and you know we sharin' (Yeah)
Just threw a 50 in the club without even carin'
All that designer got 'em wonderin' what a nigga wearin' (Drip)
I woke up the other day I had a flashback
When I was dead popped I ain't had shit, I had to sell crack (Ooo)
I fucked up my pay so many times, was havin' setbacks
But look at me now, me and my niggas havin' jet lag
Was prayin' for a better day (Yuh)
That was just the other day (Yuh)
Now I'm havin' so much cake, I just got into real estate (Ooo)
Went from rice gravy, now it's surf and turf all on my plate (Ooo)
Run up on me 'round my hitters shootin' and they won't hesitate
Like Raaa

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
'Member when I had a bus pass (Pass)
I just pulled in LA and I got jet lag (Vroom)
Lil' bitch gave me her number, I might text back (Huh)
I just blew a hunnid K and I ain't stress that
Yuh, young nigga got a check fast (Check fast)
I just pulled up in some shit, they be like "What's that?" (What's that?)
I just bought a new AP, I had to flash that (Flash that)
You don't know me, do not post me, better stop that (Stop)
Yeah (Braaa)

[Outro]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Do not post me, better stop that
Yuh, yuh
