[Intro: Jeezy]
Tee, what's happening homie?
Oh it's on
It's yo time my nigga
See this a fucked up game right here my nigga like
Ch-ch-ch-ch-chopsquad
They ain't kickin' this shit how we kickin' this shit, man
You talkin' for the people, you talkin' for us nigga
I understand yo struggle nigga, cause yo struggles just like mine
I wanna see you on top nigga, all the way on top nigga
ChopsquadDJ on the beat so its a banger

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
See I know a whole lot about a little bit
Ain't 'bout to get me big mad about some lil shit
I came from white squares, scorpions in the middle bitch
White drop top horses in the middle bitch
See fuck pussy niggas, they been in some luxury
No more nightmares of DEA custody
Throw them handcuffs on me, drag me out my bed
Nigga playin' with my paper I'ma give him lead
You ever catch a nigga with it, bitch I'm goin' fed
22 summers straight, bitch I'm gettin' bread
Bottom of the pyrex, spread it like some butter
28, I made twins, now he got a brother
Do it for my mother, my lil sister too
My nephews and my niece, without me, what they gon' do?
Rest in peace to Mad Lou, she ain't see me shine
This a pressure bust pipes, well it made a diamond
New diamond in the AP, perfect timin'
Really came from the bottom, yeah I must remind em'
Big flakes in the bricks, yeah I'm tryna blind em'
Where the billion dollars at? Shit I'm tryna find it
Was a hood nigga, now I'm a good nigga
When I walk up in the bank, they say he good nigga
Can't figure me out, misunderstood nigga
I made a mill on Madden Ave, that's on the hood nigga

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Time (it's your time)
Nigga, it's your time (know it's your time)
Waste it, you can't get it back
My nigga it's your time (What you gon do with that?)
You can't waste no time (you can't get it back)
You can't waste no time
You can't waste no time

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
All them bags, I saw everybody else get it (never had it)
Hood trophies, I saw everybody else with it
When I finally got my shine, niggas felt it (oh they felt it)
Got yo bitch in the Benz, pussy melt (pussy drip)
Hold up, spread that money out, we can't be selfish (let's get to it)
Playin' like spades, get a nigga and his partner dealt with
They said we only fucked up once, Tee left us on stuck (left us hangin')
How many chances niggas want? You niggas grown as fuck (god damn)
We gon' be forever straight with god, we gon' forever live
Niggas had what I had, but I did shit they never did
White on white AP gon' make that bitch fuck, while she celibate
Draco will go through an elephant and kill whatever's hit
Niggas that was up ain't come around the hood (they was out the way)
Got rich young, retire early, got your timin' good (thank you lord)
Older niggas told me get it and stay out the hood (what)
But I chose to motivate the streets, push Bentleys around the hood

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Time (it's your time)
Nigga, it's your time (know it's your time)
Waste it, you can't get it back
My nigga it's your time (What you gon do with that?)
You can't waste no time (you can't get it back)
You can't waste no time
You can't waste no time
