[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
My bloodas will take his dreads off with a headshot
Dead off association cause he ain't did none
Free Boona, cause he got jammed up and ain't sayin' nothin'
Even though I was on parole gotta keep it on me

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
These niggas think they so hard, pull they hoe card
Twin Glocks blow his toes off, knock his clothes off
Hundred racks in my Goyard, resting so long
Bitches, can't come in here unless they cut their phones off

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Homie you fuck with Booka
Put that on Tooka
Rob who? I be with all the robbers and shooters
Bitch fuck yo' mood
My lil' shawty gon' (?)
If that .40 go rah
.45 must  go boom

[Verse 4: Tee Grizzley]
Please don't, tryna play hard
Get your face spurred
Zo got 20 bodies, bitch it's a graveyard
Niggas playin' on that Instagram better log off
Use your head, AR pistol hit it, it's gon' fall off

[Verse 5: Lil Durk]
Gun charge wish I got it dropped
Let them Ks off
So hard, had some dime bags look like eightballs
Put a bag, all on his head, he get paid off
Lay low, if he cut his dreads, knock his fade off
