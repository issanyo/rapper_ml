[Intro]
You see a lotta guys was made to be wit' one woman
But me
Hellava made this beat, baby
I want all y'all

[Chorus]
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
Got a few bitches, but I don't be cheatin' 'cause I fuck wit' all y'all
I'm in they texts and I'm in they DM's, I'm in they call logs
'Cause I want 'em all, I want 'em all
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
Got a few bitches, but I don't be cheatin' 'cause I fuck wit' all y'all
I'm in they texts and I'm in they DM's, I'm in they call logs (Raa)
'Cause I want 'em all, (Raa) I want 'em all, I want 'em all

[Verse]
Ayy, finna have my bitch go get bitch 'cause I'm in the mood for two (Two)
She gotta be freaky, she gotta be with what I'm in the mood to do (Ready)
Casino owe us comps, so we got rooms (Let's get it)
We gon' do what we do, but I can't spoon
'Cause we on the move (We gone)
Watchu want me to do
If your bitch tryna fuck me?
'Cause I'm not Drizzy, I'm not Shiggy, I know Keke love me (She do)
My ex got some cold fans, I told her to plug me (We go)
She got jealous, how I know? 'Cause I caught her subtweet
I cannot fuck if she average (Average)
I'm only touchin' the baddest (Baddest)
I'm at the W smashin' (Smashin')
Soon as I nut, I'm in traffic (Traffic)
This bitch ain't got a lotta followers
FaceTime her so I know it ain't catfish
Got two rooms at the Westin
Fuck the straight one, go to sleep wit' the bad bitch
She ask how many hoes I been fuckin'
I said, "Not too many bitch"
She gotta be bad, she gotta be lit
This ain't no community dick
(When your nigga call, I'ma be quiet
This shit ain't new to me, bitch)
But gimme the same respect
My other girls can't know you and me bitch

[Chorus]
'Cause I want 'em all, I want 'em all
Got a few bitches, but I don't be cheatin' 'cause I fuck wit' all y'all
I'm in they texts and I'm in they DM's, I'm in they call logs
'Cause I want 'em all, I want 'em all
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
Got a few bitches, but I don't be cheatin' 'cause I fuck wit' all y'all
I'm in they texts and I'm in they DM's, I'm in they call logs
'Cause I want 'em all, I want 'em all, I want 'em all
