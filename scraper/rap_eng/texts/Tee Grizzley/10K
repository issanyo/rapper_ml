[Intro]
Need that
Shit we need that
10 bands will get a nigga a Tee track
I need a whole 10 out a nigga if I jump on niggas raps
I need a whole 10 out a nigga if I jump on niggas raps

[Verse 1]
Why these niggas watching me tell em to look at cable
Before I find they bitch and fuck up they engagement
The plug said I'm half a man and half amazing
No cereal but I got twenty bowls on the table
Feeling good finally made it out them chains
Yo mans playing tough, I let you see that nigga brain's
I can get yo bitch wet before the next time it rain
You a fool you think Imma keep that forty-one plain nigga
Been in the sun getting dark the Buffs still white
Did some time made it back the prices was still right
Everything I rap about it happened in real life
You got pregnant on me baby, how you think you still wife?
Hahhh
Whenever I do that it mean I'm about activate
Nigga put his hands on me shit gone escalate
Platinum rollie hang out that platinum escalade
30 on yo team, they gone kill you niggas yesterday

[Chorus]
Go tell them boys
I need 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga
Tell them boys I said 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga
Like what the fuck is five hunna
Dig deeper nigga
You want a track go get 10 for a feature nigga
Tell them boys I charge 10 for a feature nigga
Wait a minute I get deeper with it

[Verse 2]
Free my Ma Dukes
Free my nigga Tay
I can fight and I can shoot
How niggas wanna play
Free my lil bro
I talked to him today
He said "a nigga want a track"
Charge him 10K
If they ain't got it they shouldn't be rapping anyway
If these niggas can't come up with 10 then they in the way
I'm out of prison, Let me pick up where I left it at
Got my Giuseppe in the game but I ain't finna play
Medusa head hold up my white Barbours
I don't game up these hoes I don't like talking
This ain't no motherfucking rollie
This a ice sculpture
Try to take it watch how quick I send them night crawlers

[Chorus]
Go tell them boys
I need 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga
Tell them boys I said 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga
Like what the fuck is five hunna
Dig deeper nigga
You want a track go get 10 for a feature nigga
Tell them boys I charge 10 for a feature nigga
Wait a minute I get deeper with it

[Verse 3]
Like huh, That's what you niggas call a team ?
Two bands on my feet, You want to walk with me?
Huh?
Somebody said talk is cheap
I speak a 100 thousand to existence
Come and talk to me
A nigga put his hands on me
Let me stop you there
A nigga raise his voice at me then he out of there
That K will sit you down and spin you like a barber chair
Jet black mink with the hood, Call me PaPa Bear
Stupid ass nigga I need 10 for a feature
If you hear a nigga chased me
I was running to a heater
Pop and leave his head hot
Somebody check him for a fever
Shout to my bitch and the bitches that want to be her nigga
Me and that boy Curry  got some shit in common
Last night we put up thirty niggas couldn't stop us
He put up thirty point's, I put up thirty thousand
Them niggas be shooting hoops
We be shooting choppas

[Chorus]
Go tell them boys
I need 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga
Tell them boys I said 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga
Like what the fuck is five hunna
Dig deeper nigga
You want a track go get 10 for a feature nigga
Tell them boys I charge 10 for a feature nigga
Wait a minute I get deeper with it
