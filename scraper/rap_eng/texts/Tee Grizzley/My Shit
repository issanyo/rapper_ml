[Intro: Philthy Rich & Tee Grizzley]
Uh-huh (ahh, ahh), look (ahh, ahh)
It's Philthy, nigga
What up, Philthy? look

[Chorus: Philthy Rich & Tee Grizzley]
You see a Wraith in Oakland, that is my shit
You in Detroit and see a Wraith, nigga that's my shit
My young niggas playin' with the mopsticks
I got some old-school killers hold you hostage
Five hundred thousand large, that is not shit
Five different labels talkin' millions, I got options
A lot of foreign cars, no cap bitch
Bust a Rollie down before I had a rap check

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzely]
Pussy ass niggas ain't shit like me (I'm different)
My jewelry kit about ten houses (this shit hittin')
If my watch was a sport, then this bitch hockey (ice ice)
If my chain was a boxer, then this bitch Rocky (Rocky Rocky)
I got your bitch on a Sprinter
She got your man's bitch with her, yeah, yeah
I drop a check on your hitter
Hit your house like they deliver, yeah, yeah
Saw my first million, couldn't sleep, I was restless
You niggas don't fear me, y'all too passive aggressive
Fuck a Wild 'n Out girl then show her the exit
Don't fuck with these goofies, they might get me arrested
Everybody with me go, my circle look like Tekken
Put numbers on your gang, y'all niggas look like Madden
Your bitch got that fire, I see why you wifed her
She was a whole meal, hit her then changed my diet
Different groups of opps, I don't know which ones matter
Whole gang got forty-ones, you don't know who the rapper

[Chorus: Philthy Rich & Tee Grizzley]
You see a Wraith in Oakland, that is my shit
You in Detroit and see a Wraith, nigga that's my shit
My young niggas playin' with the mopsticks
I got some old-school killers hold you hostage
Five hundred thousand large, that is not shit
Five different labels talkin' millions, I got options
A lot of foreign cars, no cap bitch
Bust a Rollie down before I had a rap check

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Eastside Oakland, put the city on the map (Seminary)
Put your order in, deliver you a hundred packs (they do that)
Every time you see me, a hundred niggas, a hundred straps
Racin' to the money, I done ran a hundred laps (it's Philthy)
You see a Wraith in Oakland, it's either me or Stick
But we both from Seminary, my whole hood rich (SemCity Money Man)
Bust down the frames on the woods, bitch (bust down)
Warriors game, front row, I'm on the wood bitch (I got my money on Curry)
Five mill just in ice (that's just in ice)
But my whole team shinin', bitch it's only right (is that right?)
Bitch I'm in only town for a night (I am)
Tryna get my dick sucked before I catch this flight (ayy it's Philthy ho)
Forty-one millimeter discontinued (they is)
Bitch, I need my backend before I hit the venue (ayy I need that)
Uber Eats, Ocean Prime, what's the menu?
Tip the valet hundred dollars, tell him pull a Bent through
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Philthy Rich & Tee Grizzley]
You see a Wraith in Oakland, that is my shit
You in Detroit and see a Wraith, nigga that's my shit
My young niggas playin' with the mopsticks
I got some old-school killers hold you hostage
Five hundred thousand large, that is not shit
Five different labels talkin' millions, I got options
A lot of foreign cars, no cap bitch
Bust a Rollie down before I had a rap check
