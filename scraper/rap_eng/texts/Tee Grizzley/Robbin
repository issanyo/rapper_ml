(Intro)

[Chorus]
Because when I was out here robbin'
You wasn't there, you wasn't there
And when I was out here starvin'
You didn't care, you didn't care
So why do you think it's fair for you
To come around and be a part of what I do
I can tell you niggas, "Love ain't true"
Only wanna help me because it can help you

[Verse 1]
It's sunny now but don't forget that it can rain (who is you talkin' to?)
Bitch, I still got my rain boots from back in the day (I been doin;' this shit)
Before the rap, before the plaques, before the steak (huh?)
I was starvin', me and bro had to split a fish filet
I can't take no breaks, wait
Mar Mar was stuck in a hole, I wish I knew what was wrong
I got money on my phone, I can't wait 'til you come home
Stayed in my bed for a week, when I found out Tracy was gone (fuck!)
Me and them niggas was close, I bet you don't even know

[Chorus]
Them niggas done change on me
'Lot of shit got blamed on me (niggas wasn't there)
Wonder why these shades on me
So you can't see the pain on me
'Cause when I was out here robbin' (give me that)
You wasn't there, you wasn't there (you niggas was in the house)
And when I was out here starvin'
You didn't care, you didn't care
So why do you think it's fair for you (huh?)
To come around and be apart of what I do
I can tell you niggas, "Love ain't true" (shit ain't real nigga)
Only wanna help me (keep it G) because it can help you

[Verse 2]
I lost it all (they took it all), then got it right back
Matter fact I got more than I had, my nigga (facts)
When you speakin' on my situation make sure you don't leave out the facts
You know this shit way deeper than rap, my nigga (this shit deeper than rap my nigga)
Wonder why I keep toasters, nigga, wonder why I stay focused, nigga
Niggas changed up overnight so I can't get close to niggas
And they wonder why I'm antisocial, nigga
Huh? 'Cause they don't understand me
My niggas (who else), these ho's (who else), even my family

[Chorus]
Changed on me, 'lot of shit got blamed on me
Reason why these shades on me
So they can't see this pain on me
'Cause when I was out here robbin'
You wasn't there, you wasn't there (the fuck was y'all niggas at?)
And when I was out here starvin'
You didn't care, you didn't care
So why do you think it's fair for you
To come around and be apart of what I do
I can tell you niggas, "Love ain't true"
Only wanna help me because it can help you (get the fuck on)
I done had some niggas change on me
'Lot of shit got blamed on me
Wonder why these shades on me
So they can't see the pain on me

(Outro)
'Cause when I was out here robbin' (I was out here robbin')
And when I was out here starvin' (I was out here starvin')
When I was out here robbin' (I was out here robbin')
When niggas was just targets (niggas was just targets)
You was not there (no), you did not care (no)
Niggas be scared (yes), don't shoot in the air (bop)
We be out here lurkin', niggas ain't nowhere (no)
Karma gon' come back, tell her I'm prepared
'Cause when I was out here-
