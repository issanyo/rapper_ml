[Intro]
Raf Simons cost me five slips
That Goyard bag another five strip
You in Detroit and see a Wraith, nigga that's my shit
Would've pushed Rico's shit back, I am not Mitch
Helluva made this beat, baby
Gettin' money, why these niggas gettin' mad?
Jump off the plane with a couple of M's in the bag
If anybody play with me, it's numbers on their head
We ain't gon' talk about it though, that's the end of that

[Verse 1 ]
Trappin', I'm still into that, address, I can send you that
So if my label drop me, I can still look like I rap
Know a couple of niggas livin' like they got platinum plaques (Aha)
All they doing is catchin' bags, sendin' out and sittin' back (aha)
Rose Presi' on my wrist, I can afford that (nice shit)
Back in the day, I couldn't even look toward that
When I was broke, I couldn't even look toward the bitch
Now she suck my dick and don't say shit when I record the bitch (catch that)
Been on the indictment list, tryna see the Forbes list
Went from playin' with joysticks to out in traffic blowin' sticks (Graa)
When your fans gets your name tatted, then you know you lit
Stank from my cologne, I'ma fuck her if she snort the drip (aha)
Promise my brother I'ma stack and get this paper right
But I'm spendin' 60k a month just on everyday life
When you that bag, everybody wanna whirl it
Problems they got, they gon' call you like you 'caused 'em
Fall up in the club, I can rain 'till it's morning
Start in every game 'cause at practice, I've been ballin' (swish)
Heard a couple niggas wanna put me on my shit (what)
Tell 'em pull up with them sticks and let 'em hit, you better not miss, bitch

[Bridge]
I know some Crips, know some Tree Tops
Name good, I ain't never sold no re-rock (never sold no re-rock)
All these colors in my chain like a peacock
I let that .40 slam 'till it decock
Ridin' through my old hood, with some new money
Blue money, they that mad? Tell 'em do somethin' (come do something nigga)
Got three Tennis chains, and like two Presi's
Three choppas, four Glocks, this shit too heavy (shit'll get too messy)

[Verse 2]
Key to the pad, key to the Rolls, key to the bag
I got the key to the streets, don't get a key put on your ass
When I do that, you know them niggas gon' knock you in half
Heavy cash load, got my back broke
Bitches on the East, and on the West Coast
Sent me pics and videos, you can't get my passcode
Ten up in the motor, got the hood broke
Bitch, don't get yo' head painted, you gon' look like Lil Boat (painted red)
Ridin' through Atlanta with my nigga Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
Niggas trailin' us and you know what they good for
'Bout to fly to Cali and look for that good dope
If you 'bout that life, then what you lookin' shook for?
Told my lil bro, I had to chase M's, .40 on me, all big face bills
In the back of the Mulsanne, lettin' the space build
If the police flip me with this Glock, I'ma face ten (skrt)
I ain't supposed to be the shooter, I'm on top
But I still let it spray like it's 4 days into July
I've been runnin' red light in my city, I know it's hot
I'd rather take the ticket, niggas want my top, it's so many opps

[Outro]
I know some Crips, know some Tree Tops
Name good, I ain't never sold no re-rock (never sold no re-rock)
All these colors in my chain like a peacock
I let that .40 slang 'till it decock (bloaw, bloaw)
Know some BD's, I know some gangsta's
Get outta line and they a spank ya (and they a spank ya)
Know some Pirus, know some head-bangers
Know some Sex Money Murda niggas that'll paint ya (gang, gang, gang, gang)
