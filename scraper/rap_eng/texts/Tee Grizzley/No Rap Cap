If it ain't no bag involved
If it ain't no bag involved
PnB to the D
Grizzley gang
Rock, what up?
DJ on the beat so it's a banger

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
I'm not gon' talk to you for long if there ain't no bag involved
I don't indulge with the help, go get the man in charge
You don't want this Glock to line you up, it'll push you back too far
My shooter's Queen Latifah, they'll set it off (brrrrrahh)
Hundred pointers, my carats large, we so ahead of y'all (can't touch)
We got more bread than y'all (broke bitch)
Your bitch, we share her, dawg (ho bitch)
These bitches scared of y'all (ain't scared of y'all niggas man)
They know you gon' tell it all (gossipin' ass niggas, shut the fuck up)
No cap (No cap), No rap (no rap)
I can stand on a Bentley (stand on a skrrt)
I own that (I own that)
You be fuckin' with snitches (fuckin' with rats)
Cold rats (cold rats)
Y'all niggas want smoke (nigga want smoke)
Blow that (blow that)

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I ain't takin' no pictures, free Kodak (free that nigga)
Ridin' 'round wit a stick (brrr)
You know that (you know that shit)
Nigga got my name in his mouth (huh), get toe tagged (brrr)
Fuck around might run in yo house, where your ho at?
I was just eatin' them noodles, now I'm eatin' that caviar
Ridin' 'round in the fastest cars
Instagram hoes, I smash 'em all
These niggas broke, we laugh at y'all (haha)
Y'all ain't havin' no cash at all (broke)
Niggas just be actin' hard, I'ma wind up smackin' y'all (bitch)

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
Which one of y'all niggas hoes (y'all niggas hoes), I'ma go at? (I'ma go at?)
Heard your mans got dropped

Rock, fuck these niggas, they ain't get no pass
And fuck these bitches, they broke ass
You can't make it out Detroit 'less you play basketball
If the opps listenin', just know we keepin' tabs on y'all, huh
We call y'all black ice 'cause we always slidin' on y'all
Nigga this chop run outta bullets, I'ma put the .45 on y'all

[Verse 4: PnB Rock]
You must wanna die, fuckin' with me and my gang
Niggas gon' slide if you're missin' my name (gang)
Don't come outside (come outside), 'less you want feel that flame
Lil' nigga better stay in your lane 'fore you be the next one to get changed
Won't make it out Philly unless you a rapper, dawg
Unless you a trapper, dawg
Still might leave in a casket, dawg
And that's the saddest part
Niggas ridin' 'round with Dracos, [?]in' from the ops and the [?]
I can't even trust my main ho, damn

[Outro: Tee Grizzley & PnB Rock]
You can't make it out Detroit 'less you play basketball
If the opps listenin' just know we keepin' tabs on y'all, huh
Won't make it out Philly unless you a rapper, dawg
Unless you a trapper, dawg
Still might leave in a casket, dawg
And that's the saddest part
And that's the saddest part
