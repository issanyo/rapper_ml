[Intro]
Look at the bottom, I had to make it, I had to
Came with a record deal, I had to touch it, I had to
All the jealousy it got activated (outta no where)
All the fake love it got activated

[Verse 1]
Got some people, they really my kin don't feel like we family though
Then I got some people, they only my friends and feel like we family though
Whenever it's time to stick to the plan
I know how to handle it most (I got it)
Vanish the foes and cancel the hoes
Just so I could manage to go
Deactivated and I'ma do me, I am not goin' on E
You know I'm out in these streets but let me not eat
I'm robbin' these niggas that's out here on fleek
And thats on my OG
One thing I learned from these suckers
These niggas don't be your brothers
These bitches don't even love you
Better keep your circle small
'Cause that loyalty is a bad motherfucker
That loyalty, that bitch a bad motherfucker
I caught my sister stealing out my pockets
It ain't your fault if I don't trust you
I can still get five years for the pistol
Ain't no way around it, I'm clutchin'
If I'm ever threatened, if I'm disrespected
Ain't no way around it, I'm bustin'
I got some people, we got different blood
They wanna see me in a Ghost (Rolls-Royce)
And I got some people, we got the same blood
They wanna see me as a ghost (Dead)
That's why I'm doin' the most, playin' my role
Better tuck your bitch, I'm at niggas hoes
Thick spread, all blue faces, I don't need dubs to make it look long
Dreadhead but I'm a city nigga, if I'm pussy, then Biggie living
Won't fuck just an bitch and I'll let this bitch blow at any nigga
Date day with the belly spray
And it's really gold, I ain't going' different
Should invest into funeral homes
'Cause these bitches dyin' just to fuck with us (she did)
Bro said the last bag was garbage (garbage)
So I paid him back out of respect (here you go)
Stand up, nigga, if I fuck with you, it's 100 brah, I don't finesse (100)
When I ain't fuck with niggas, it was all blood
Laugh, cry with him, for cuz
His loyalty ain't where I need it at
So it's a shame I can't even call Dub
I like to call baby, like what's the word? Chillin', I ain't on shit tonight
She gonna come through, get me right
And I'ma crash through it like she ran the light
Well, I gotta go before I miss this flight (I'm gone)
So I'm tryna get up (get up)
I'm like a kid before Christmas night
Who ain't never had none in his life, like
This really my life with zero exaggeration
Some niggas just elevated, got me feelin' activated
Lost a lot in them cells and cages but held on to my dedication
The money got me fascinated, saw that shit and got activated

[Chorus]
Saw the money and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
Saw that money and got activated
I saw that money and got activated

[Verse 2]
Canada Goose keep me warm in my cold city (Detroit)
I got a pole with me, Glock cost 450
Your bitch blowin' (she's drunk), took my soul with her (suck it)
They got they hand out (what?), I don't even know niggas
For testing the game? I'm testing my aim
If I die today, I got a M to my name
In 2015, ain't have a stack to my name (broke)
Cuz let me starve, sent him a pic in a new Mulsanne
Tell him I saw the money and got activated

[Chorus]
Saw the money and got activated
Saw that money and got activated
I saw the money and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
I saw that money and got activated
I saw that money and got activated
