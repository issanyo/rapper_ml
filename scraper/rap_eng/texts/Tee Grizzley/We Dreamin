[Intro]
'Fore we lived this shit, we dreamed it (BeatGang)
Always felt this shit comin' but I just couldn't see it
I ain't see it, ayy, I ain't believe it
Antt did the track

[Chorus]
Ayy, before we lived this shit, we dreamed it (We dreamed it)
Always felt this shit comin' but I just couldn't see it (We ain't see it)
You told me I was gon' get rich, I wouldn't've believed it (I don't believe it)
I come from motherfuckin' starvin' and fiendin' (Ah)
Now the guts on that Bentley truck creamish (Skrrt)
Show the bitch two hundred thousand, she got to screamin'
She fuckin' with a legend, now she feel like Chrissy Teigen
Haha (Shout out John Legend, man), ayy

[Verse 1]
Talkin' to my mama on the video visit (Free her)
She sittin' in the feds from the way she was livin'
Bro sentence, 'cause niggas couldn't take a conviction
They ain't like us, damn, I wish you paid attention, my nigga
Saleem callin' like, "I need to make a hit"
Shooter callin' like, "I'm broke nigga, I need to take a hit"
I'm like, "It ain't no threats, it ain't nobody to get"
He like, "Let me go get one of them niggas that's talkin' shit," ayy
These niggas' peoples be on tours and on stage with 'em
All my peoples on the yard or in the grave, nigga (What else?)
If you ain't out here getting paid, you in the way, nigga
And then them bows come in turkey bags, nigga, Thanksgiving

[Chorus]
Ayy, before we lived this shit, we dreamed it (We dreamed it)
Always felt this shit comin' but I just couldn't see it (We ain't see it)
You told me I was gon' get rich, I wouldn't've believed it (I don't believe that shit)
I come from motherfuckin' starvin' and fiendin' (Nigga)
Now the guts on that Bentley truck creamish (Skrrt)
Showed my brother two million dollars, he got to screamin' (Ah)
She fuckin' with a legend, now she feel like Chrissy Teigen
(John Legend, what up, my guy? Ah, nigga)

[Verse 2]
Ayy, from spot life to spotlight (We went from spot life to spotlight), yeah
From nick houses to penthouses (We went from nick houses to penthouses), yeah
Ain't gotta prove shit to nobody (Man fuck y'all niggas), nigga
All these niggas know I been 'bout it (Bitch, holler at me), look
Shit can turn around quicker than you think, quicker than a blink
You can do it bro, you just gotta believe (Nigga)
Look what I achieved, nigga why you sleep?
Pray that you succeed, then go get where you gotta be (Go get to it)
I remember seein' cars like, "I want that" (Damn I need that)
JR called with them licks and we was on that (Damn I need that)
Niggas all in my face 'cause money around
Probably'll stop pickin' up my phone if I blow that (You know I know that)
It's a blessing that I know that (It's a blessing), ayy
And I thank God that he showed that (No cap)
Niggas tried to bring me down, they got no cash
They ho ass, that's why I got far away from they broke ass (Dummy)
This money comin' in crazy, let's toast to that (Nigga let's toast to that)
And it's all legal, we can close the trap (We don't do that no more)
When you givin' back and showin' love then you know you lit
When your bitch sister wanna fuck, nigga you know you rich (Nigga, ah)

[Chorus]
Ayy, before we lived this shit, we dreamed it (We dreamed it)
Always felt this shit comin' but I just couldn't see it (I ain't see it)
You told me I was gon' get rich, I wouldn't've believed it (I don't believe it)
I come from motherfuckin' starvin' and fiendin' (Nigga, ah)
Now the guts on that Bentley truck creamish (Skrrt)
Showed my sister ten million dollars, she got to screamin' (Ah)
She fuckin' with a legend, now she feel like Chrissy Teigen
(Ah), nigga, ah (Yeah)
