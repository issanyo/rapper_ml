[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't ever told on my niggas, dawg
I ain't ever froze with that pistol, dawg
How many niggas can say that?
Keep it real, keep it real, nigga
How many niggas can say that?
Be forreal, just be forreal, nigga
I ain't scared to hit that road and go get it, dawg
If I put it in my song, then I live it, dawg
How many niggas can say that?
Keep it real with yourself
How many niggas can say that?
Just keep it real with yourself, be forreal
And I still got some niggas doin' fed time
Niggas doin' all day without a deadline
I came home and you know I held my mans down
How many niggas can say that?
Keep it real with yourself

[Verse 1]
How many niggas did they time and came home on some silent shit?
I never froze with that pistol, I was poppin' shit
Hit that interrogation room on some quiet shit
Just get me to a cell with my niggas so we can politic
And when I hit the county I was tripping on the rock
They took the TV, I don't care just don't fuck with that clock
And when I hit the prison yard, I met a lot of plugs
They saw my paper work and I got a lot of love

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't ever told on my niggas, dawg
I ain't ever froze with that pistol, dawg
How many niggas can say that?
Keep it real, keep it real, nigga
How many niggas can say that?
Be forreal, just be forreal, nigga
I ain't scared to hit that road and go get it, dawg
If I put it in my song, then I live it, dawg
How many niggas can say that?
Keep it real with yourself
How many niggas can say that?
Just keep it real with yourself, be forreal
And I still got some niggas doin' fed time
Niggas doin' all day without a deadline
I came home and you know I held my mans down
How many niggas can say that?
Keep it real with yourself

[Verse 2]
I hit the road with no L's, that's a real risk
I tried to smash thirty rollies, that's a real lick
She put that money on her phone and kept that them letters coming
I cheated on her, she kept doing it, that's a real Bitch
And I swear Naqueta she a realest dawg
Got that money right and she ain't miss a visit dawg
She said she gon' hold me down and she did it dawg
How many bitches can say that?
Keep it real with yourself
FED's threw the bait you know them lames took it
I treat my niggas like we came out the same pussy
I hold my own wait ain't looking for no time reduction
Only thing I told them bitches was my lawyer number
I done been through Cincinnati headed to the K
Really I learned how to drive on them interstates
Like "Lik wake up nigga, we a hour away"
If we get into some shit, that nigga know he safe

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't ever told on my niggas, dawg
I ain't ever froze with that pistol, dawg
How many niggas can say that?
Keep it real, keep it real, nigga
How many niggas can say that?
Be forreal, just be forreal, nigga
I ain't scared to hit that road and go get it, dawg
If I put it in my song, then I live it, dawg
How many niggas can say that?
Keep it real with yourself
How many niggas can say that?
Just keep it real with yourself, be forreal
How many niggas can say that
Keep it real nigga
How many niggas can say that ?
Be forreal nigga
How many niggas can say that ?
Keep it real nigga
How many niggas can say that ?
Be forreal nigga
How many niggas can say that ?
Keep it real nigga
How many niggas can say that ?
Be forreal nigga
How many niggas can say that ?
Keep it real nigga
