[Intro]
Antt did the track
That boy a fool on that piano
Keep that

[Chorus]
Did a lot of wrongs just to get right (Just to get it right)
Did a lot of wrongs just to get right (Just to get it right)
I knew that shit was wrong, but it's gon' get me right
I'm just tryna get it right

[Verse 1]
It's gon' shine in the dark 'cause it's real ice ('Cause it's VV)
Before I fuck that bitch, I'm gon' be real nice (I play my role)
Nigga owe me money, I ain't gon' ask twice (Pull up)
You better pull up with my shit, I'm bein' real nice (Nigga, pull up)
That Bentley 350, that's the real price (Skrrt)
That 16 ain't got no seal, it ain't no real pint

[Chorus]
That's the police, I can tell by their headlights (Fuck)
Glock on me and I'm nervous, this shit real life (Fuck)
'Cause I done fought the feds twice
Gave me three years and they was bein' nice (Can't go back)
I was in there eatin' rice (Fuck)
Couldn't wait to see the light (Stardom)
I've been tryna get it right (Tryna get it right)
Did a lot of wrongs just to get it right (I'm still tryna get it right)
Know that shit was wrong, but it's gon' get me right (Shit was worth my wait)
I'm just tryna get it right
That's the police, I can tell by their headlights (That's them)
Glock on me and I'm nervous, this shit real life (Fuck)
I done fought the feds twice (Twice)
Nigga, this shit real life (I can't go back)

[Verse 2]
Remember when I had 900 followers (I remember that)
That's when I had more followers than dollars (Facts)
All I wanted was some Trues and a pair of Pradas (Wanted them bitches so bad)
Double straps
(Man, I swear to God)
Ayy, ayy
If a nigga try to rob, you just go in your pocket (Give it to him)
'Cause that hunger that he feelin', bro, I know about it (I was him)
Them couple dollars, he'll kill before he go without it (Facts)
Shit, if you don't, he gon' drop you and take it off your body
You ain't strapped and they start shootin', bro, you gotta run (Get the fuck on)
You never know who behind that gun (Swear to God)
'Cause when I'm behind that bitch, I'm tryna hit a head (Come here)
You runnin' off with niggas' bags, how you gon' get ahead?
When I was young, sellin' dope was always in my head
Whole family sold dope, that's just how I was bred (Everybody)
Cuz said, "You good with that rap, do this instead"
Went behind his back, the other way, flip it, we gon' split the bread (Fuck that)
I jumped into these streets and that shit turned me out
Too many niggas fallin' victim, that's what burned me out (I'm straight on that)
White mentality, business is how we earnin' now (Let's get it)
Black mentality, insurance job, burn 'em down

[Chorus]
That's the police, I can tell by their headlights
Glock on me and I'm nervous, this shit real life (That's them)
I done fought the feds twice (Fuck)
Nigga, this shit real life (Twice)
I've been tryna get it right (I can't go back)
Did a lot of wrongs just to get it right (I'm still tryna get it right)
Know that shit was wrong, but it's gon' get me right  (I'm tryna get it right)
I'm just tryna get it right (Shit was worth my wait)
