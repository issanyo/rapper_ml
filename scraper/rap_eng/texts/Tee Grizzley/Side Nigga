[Intro]
I know what you need
I know what you need
I know what you need
I know what you need

[Verse 1]
All I gotta do is touch her just for me to turn her on
My song come on, she like, "Please don't turn it off"
I'm not in love with her, she ain't in love with me
Wanna be with her nigga and just keep what we do low-key
Every time we out, we just end up makin' love
I can see it in her eyes that her nigga fuckin' up
When she start cryin' I say, "Come here, baby, hush"
Every time she hop up on this dick, she feel a rush

[Chorus]
'Cause I know what you love, I know what you love
I know what you love, baby, I know what you love
Don't leave your relationship, that's what couples go through
Continue bein' with him, I'ma continue fuckin' you
'Cause I know what you need, I know what you need
I know what you need, a side nigga, yes indeed
Don't leave your nigga, girl, every couple have their bumps
Just call on me when that nigga get to actin' up

[Verse 2]
Show you how to do this, pay attention
Really, I should be taxin' for this game I'm givin' niggas, ayy
Before you fuck her body, fuck her mental
Be there when she feelin' empty
When she talk, make sure you listen
This is simple
Now she soakin' up my sheets and all my pillows
Cummin' on my seat, she be fuckin' up all the rentals, ayy
She like, "Boy I swear you got what I've been missin'
My nigga straight, but I might leave him in a minute, ayy"
I'm like, "Nah baby y'all got too much history
I ain't trippin', stay with him
And when you want this dick, come get it, baby"
She like, "Tee, baby I'm tired of bein' with him
And only time I feel a uh is when you kill it, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause I know what you love, I know what you love
I know what you love, baby, I know what you love
Don't leave your relationship, that's what couples go through
Continue bein' with him, I'ma continue fuckin' you
'Cause I know what you need, I know what you need
I know what you need, a side nigga, yes indeed
Don't leave your nigga, girl, every couple have their bumps
Just call on me when that nigga get to actin' up

[Outro]
I know what you need
I know what you need
I know what you need
I know what you need
