[Intro]
Helluva made this beat, baby
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, ah

[Refrain]
Whole lot of money, straight up (Straight up)
Whole lot of dope, straight up (Straight up)
Nigga run off, I'ma catch up with him
Hop out and I'm sendin' him straight up (Come here)
At the coke house, weighin' up (Work)
Run that check straight up (Straight up)
One nigga fuck up that bag (What?)
Everybody gon' take pay cuts (Give me that)

[Verse 1]
Got Mar-Mar on JPay (JPay)
I got Twink on Corrlinks (Free her)
Boy you a bitch, pendejo
Beefin' with you'd bore me (Pussy)
Bust down Cuban, Quavo (Quavo)
Bust down Prezi', payroll (Payroll)
Say he gon' slide on the block
Oh yeah, we out here now, what you ain't know?

[Chorus]
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
Straight up, straight up, flat out, straight up
Straight up, straight up, off top, straight up

[Verse 2]
Diamonds wet (How wet is they?)
Wet as can be (Water alert)
I make money moves (Like who?)
Cardi B (Money moves)
Used to shot up all the parties, we was bad lil' bastards (Brrah)
Police asked a hundred questions, we ain't have no answers (I don't know shit)
Want my chain? Take it (Take it)
Stay out the streets, made it (Made it)
Know some shit about your bitch but I just ain't gon' say it (Be quiet)
Six nines with me paint your head like lil' rainbow head
Can't get to you, your peoples locked up, they gon' shank your mans (Uh)
Starin' at a boss (Boss)
Lil' bitch, how much you cost? (How much you want for that?)
Go'n top me off, then make your plans on gettin' lost (get out of here)
If I dressed my money, it'd shop at Big and Tall (Large)
Flush a nigga down the toilet if he piss me off (Bah)
What these niggas thought? (Woof)
Tell them knock it off (Fuck off)
I'm like Russia, press one button, they send rockets off
Let my dawgs out (Free 'em)
So we can ball out (Free 'em)
Gym at the crib, it ain't no more way to pick callouts (Straight up)

[Chorus]
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
Straight up, straight up, flat out, straight up
Straight up, straight up, off top, straight up

[Refrain]
Whole lot of money, straight up (Straight up)
Whole lot of dope, straight up (Straight up)
Nigga run off, I'ma catch up with him
Hop out and I'm sendin' him straight up (Bah)
At the coke house, weighin' up (Work)
Run that check straight up (Straight up)
One nigga fuck up that bag (Ugh)
Everybody gon' take pay cuts (Bah)

[Chorus]
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
Straight up, straight up, flat out, straight up
Straight up, straight up, off top, straight up (Straight up, nigga)
