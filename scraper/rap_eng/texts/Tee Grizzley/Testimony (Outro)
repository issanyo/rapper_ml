[Hook]
Let me give my testimony (my testimony)
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me
(I got a testimony, I got a testimony)
Let me give my testimony (my testimony)
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me
(I got a testimony, I got a testimony)

[Verse 1]
Moving fast I was dumb
Doing everything under the sun
I was older acting young
To the pain inside I was numb
Got myself together, thank you for what I've become
Send Jesus for my sins, I know I committed a ton
Father can you help me with all my heart break
Hope you have a place for my love ones you took away
Should've died so many times but you sat me in that cage
Got me on this path, now Father help me stay

[Hook]
Let me give my testimony (my testimony)
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me
(I got a testimony, I got a testimony)
Let me give my testimony (my testimony)
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me
(I got a testimony, I got a testimony)

[Verse 2]
I seen so many things when I was coming up
Money, sex, death, drugs
For some crazy reason you kept me from going corrupt
Things I thought wouldn't matter you showed me it was enough
Saw my mama get life in the feds, saw my daddy dead
Nothing hurted worse even though I know they made they bed
You told me stop worrying and turned to you instead
And if I gave you my life, I'll be with him again
So let me, give my testimony
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotta start off by saying you turned your back on me
Let me give my testimony
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me

[Outro]
First of all I wanna say I lift you up and I give you praise
Without you in my life, I wouldn't have no life today
