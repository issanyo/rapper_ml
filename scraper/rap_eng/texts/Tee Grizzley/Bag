[Chorus]
'Cause when your pockets flat and you ain't got no why
Ain't nobody giving you nothing, stand tall, nigga, don't give up
'Cause when you bounce back, that shit gon' feel so good
Your struggle made you strong and you don't owe a soul
'Cause my pockets was empty, baby, ask them to put me in position, save me (save me, save me)
But them niggas ain't listen, caught my case, got sent to prison (facts)
I sat back, worked on my vision, that's the shit that made me
Couldn't wait til' I got me a bag, couldn't wait til' I got me a bag
Couldn't wait til' I got in my bag, couldn't wait til' I got in my bag
She want it, I finna jump, couldn't wait to go get her a bag
Couldn't wait to see her with that bag, couldn't wait til' she get in her bag

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, I had shit on my books
I don't usually have a chrome
Now it's 200 racks on my neck
I spent a stack on cologne
800 racks for my home
Any bitch can't just come over
I ain't got nothing to prove
All of you real niggas know

[Chorus]
Cause when your pocket's flat and you ain't got no money
Ain't nobody give you none
Stand tall nigga don't give up
Cause when you bounce back
That shit gon' feel so good
Your struggle made you strong and you don't owe a soul
'cos my pockets was empty baby
And they still no put me in position, save me
But dumb niggas don't listen caught my case and went to prison
I said babe fulfill my mission and this shit amaze me
Couldn't wait til I got me a bag
Couldn't wait til I got me a bag
Couldn't wait til I got in my bag
Couldn't wait til I got in my bag
She hold it off on the drawer
Couldn't wait 'til I got to my bag
Couldn't wait to see her with that bag
Couldn't wait til she got in her bag

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to the man who raised me
Saw him dead and now i'm crazy
He had a heart-attack, I miss him
Almost took it out on some niggas
Caught a case before I did it
That's probably what saved me
I had a lot on my plate
I ain't had shit in my stomach
I just need an opportunity
Never asked niggas for nothing
You know they gave me nothing
You know how y'all ask us for something
I can't save niggas I'm only saving this money

[Chorus]
Cause when your pocket's flat and you ain't got no money
Ain't nobody give you none
Stand tall nigga don't give up
Cause when you bounce back
That shit gon' feel so good
Your struggle made you strong and you don't owe a soul
Cause my pockets was empty baby
And they still no put me in position save me
But dumb niggas don't listen caught my case and went to prison
I said babe fulfill my mission and this shit amaze me
Couldn't wait til I got me a bag
Couldn't wait til I got me a bag
Couldn't wait til I got in my bag
Couldn't wait til I got in my bag
She hold it off on the drawer
Couldn't wait till I got to my bag
Couldn't wait to see her with that bag
Couldn't wait till she got in her bag
