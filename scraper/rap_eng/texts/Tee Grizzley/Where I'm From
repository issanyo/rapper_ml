[Intro: Dat Boi Skeet]
Yeah, yeah
Fast lane, Dat gang

[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
Where I'm from, you don't make it to see 21
Three or four bodies, lil nigga only 17
Seen my first dead body before I turned 17
You ain't from where I'm from then you don't know what I mean, yeah
Fifty on the Rollie, I'ma die for my respect
Thirty somethin' thousand 'round my motherfuckin' neck
Thirty somethin' shots, run up slidin' with the TEC
All my niggas a hundred, that's a thousand and nothin' less, yeah

[Verse 1: Dat Boi Skeet]
You can't be up in my space if you ain't gettin' to it
You ain't a gangster, had a pistol and you didn't shoot it
Bitch don't be up in my face if you ain't finna do it
This for my niggas in the kitchen puttin' my wrist into it
From the town to the D, back out to the Veg
I been chasin' bags, gettin' cash and gettin' paid
You ain't 'bout no money then we on a different page
I take a trip and that's a risk to put me in a cage
For the money I slave, on a mission for days
You get hit or get grazed, we put some niggas in graves
Fifty sit on my wrist, plus thirty all of the chains
My niggas, all of 'em game, want money, fuck all the fame

[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
Where I'm from, you don't make it to see 21
Three or four bodies, lil nigga only 17
Seen my first dead body before I turned 17
You ain't from where I'm from then you don't know what I mean, yeah
Fifty on the Rollie, I'ma die for my respect
Thirty somethin' thousand 'round my motherfuckin' neck
Thirty somethin' shots, run up slidin' with the TEC
All my niggas a hundred, that's a thousand and nothin' less, yeah

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Ayy, hold up, niggas want smoke, let's get straight to it
Hold up, street nigga, I just happen to make greet music
When it's beef, ain't no dates, we killers that sit at the movies
Niggas don't know if they want to be opps or groupies, fuckin' goofies
Ayy, saw my first body, I was 12
Picked some cases up, these look like my uncle's shells
Pounds in the air, unc them waitin' by the mail
Block doin' twenty a week, hit the corner, you can smell, hold it up
We is not for games, we don't play none
Know so many secrets, I can't say none
Don't get out of character when a nigga play tough
Get you killed, hear the story, we gon' play dumb

[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
Where I'm from, you don't make it to see 21
Three or four bodies, lil nigga only 17
Seen my first dead body before I turned 17
You ain't from where I'm from then you don't know what I mean, yeah
Fifty on the Rollie, I'ma die for my respect
Thirty somethin' thousand 'round my motherfuckin' neck
Thirty somethin' shots, run up slidin' with the TEC
All my niggas a hundred, that's a thousand and nothin' less, yeah
Where I'm from, you don't make it to see 21
Three or four bodies, lil nigga only 17
Seen my first dead body before I turned 17
You ain't from where I'm from then you don't know what I mean, yeah
Fifty on the Rollie, I'ma die for my respect
Thirty somethin' thousand 'round my motherfuckin' neck
Thirty somethin' shots, run up slidin' with the TEC
All my niggas a hundred, that's a thousand and nothin' less, yeah
