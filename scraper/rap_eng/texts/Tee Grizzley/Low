(Intro)
Lowkey
ChopsquadDJ on the beat so it's bangin'

(Chorus)
She wanna be lowkey, she wanna be low (keep it low)
She wanna be lowkey, she wanna be low (keep it lowkey)
She just wanna fuck and keep it low (keep it lowkey)
That's my lowkey bitch, we be low (keep it lowkey)
She wanna be lowkey, I'ma keep her low (keep it lowkey)
She wanna be lowkey, I'ma keep her low (keep it lowkey)
She just wanna fuck and keep it low (keep it lowkey)
That's my lowkey bitch, we be low (keep it lowkey)

Ch-ch-ch-ch-chopsquad

(Verse 1)
Bitch I'm 'bout to pull up, unlock the door (unlock the door)
Lil bitch how you know that robe was goin' to turn me on?
Earlier why you keep blowin' up my phone?
When you know I got a bitch, hoe don't do that shit no more, aye
Want you to throw it back, I may hit record
Let me find out you do that like you see on porn
Why you ride this dick good like it's yours?
If you got paid for your ass you'd probably be on Forbes
Hol' up, what you a pro at? [?]
My bitch find out she gon' be so mad, she gon' beat your ass
Matter of fact, I might not go back, on God
I'm stalkin' you, I think I just rode past your job

(Chorus)
She wanna be lowkey, she wanna be low (keep it low)
She wanna be lowkey, she wanna be low (keep it lowkey)
She just wanna fuck and keep it low (keep it lowkey)
That's my lowkey bitch, we be low (keep it lowkey)
She wanna be lowkey, I'ma keep her low (keep it lowkey)
She wanna be lowkey, I'ma keep her low (keep it lowkey)
She just wanna fuck and keep it low (keep it lowkey)
That's my lowkey bitch, we be low (keep it lowkey)

(Verse 2)
Everytime she call my phone, I say, "I know" (I know)
But I know who it is and what they callin' for?
When I'm around my bitch I answer like, "What up lil bro?"
Got to turn my volume down so she can't hear that it's a hoe
She find out, I'm gon' be like I want you both (I want you both)
All the couple' that we know they say we 'goals' (they say we 'goals')
Last time we fucked her sister was at home (was at home)
But she was in there screamin' like we alone
Hey came a long way from a DM, play a role like I wanted to be friends
Found out she wet enough to make me sweat, keep it lowkey bitch, we a secret

(Chorus)
She wanna be lowkey, she wanna be low (keep it low)
She wanna be lowkey, she wanna be low (keep it lowkey)
She just wanna fuck and keep it low (keep it lowkey)
That's my lowkey bitch, we be low (keep it lowkey)
She wanna be lowkey, I'ma keep her low (keep it lowkey)
She wanna be lowkey, I'ma keep her low (keep it lowkey)
She just wanna fuck and keep it low (keep it lowkey)
That's my lowkey bitch, we be low (keep it lowkey)
