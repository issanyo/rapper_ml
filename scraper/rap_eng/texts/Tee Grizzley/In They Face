[Verse 1: Jeno Cashh]
Ayy, what you lil niggas thought it was?
Same fat nigga still walkin' when niggas thought they slugged
Man them boys ain't do shit, you niggas thought they was?
I'll sell niggas whatever long as they talk to cuz
Ghetto baby, walked before I crawled 'cause I don't mind stumblin'
Same bitches want to buy ain't have that bond money
Put a number on that nigga, watch me dial on him
Beefin' 'til I'm clappin' at these niggas like I'm proud of 'em
You niggas dying every day, be alive some
The difference, when my nigga drop a bag, you see an outcome
And we don't speak about that shit 'cause it wasn't about nothin'
Touchdown, throw that bitch to me, coach I got one
I bet my thug blow that bitch if he get riled up
I was cool that day but today I got your time cuz, ayy
Playin' about that fetty, I'm finna wap somethin'
Fifteen just to snatch an iPad, I told him buy it cuz

[Chorus: Jeno Cashh]
What you mad 'cause you ain't from that way?
Why y'all niggas mad, 'cause y'all ain't cop that Wraith?
Swear these niggas forty-one, ain't even got a face
Let 'em say that cap ready, we gon' drop today
When they mad at that shit, throw it in they face
Said when they mad about that shit, throw it in they face
Swear they mad about some shit, but ain't got none' to say
'Cause when they mad about that bitch, throw it in they face

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Watch your motherfuckin' mouth nigga
Everywhere I go, I got G Lock with me
Tryna put some escalators in my house on bitches
Call a doctor for the gang, his house is on our wrists
Nigga, with this beef it ain't no parties
When the club close you better come outside sparkin'
Another nigga mama crying for her baby
If your head was the rim my niggas turnin' into KD
Ayy, got some day one niggas that hate
'Cause them niggas grown as hell tryna get babied
I don't wanna see 'em dead but can't let 'em take me
So every time them niggas come around, this bitch off safety
Hold up, nigga who feel some type of way
Niggas quiet in person but hit the net with somethin' to say
Jumpin' out that Wraith with the K
Like I ain't on TV, like I ain't got all this cake

[Chorus: Jeno Cashh]
What you mad 'cause you ain't from that way?
Why y'all niggas mad, 'cause y'all ain't cop that Wraith?
Swear these niggas forty-one, ain't even got a face
Let 'em say that cap ready, we gon' drop today
When they mad at that shit, throw it in they face
Said when they mad about that shit, throw it in they face
Swear they mad about some shit, but ain't got none' to say
'Cause when they mad about that bitch, throw it in they face

[Verse 3: Jeno Cashh]
Ayy, look how they comin' 'round this bitch
The only time I leave CD if ain't no money 'round this bitch
They throw they hoods up, ain't even put no money 'round this bitch
Swear they monstrous, niggas cut like Cedi 'round this bitch
Ain't havin' shit back, boy we shootin' gumbies 'round this bitch
I can't change that, niggas ain't even hundred round this bitch
He said what cuz? Mookie bring my hundred 'round this bitch
Niggas out of here, tehy can't slide once around this bitch, ayy

[Chorus: Jeno Cashh]
What you mad 'cause you ain't from that way?
Why y'all niggas mad, 'cause y'all ain't cop that Wraith?
Swear these niggas forty-one, ain't even got a face
Let 'em say that cap ready, we gon' drop today
When they mad at that shit, throw it in they face
Said when they mad about that shit, throw it in they face
Swear they mad about some shit, but ain't got none' to say
'Cause when they mad about that bitch, throw it in they face
