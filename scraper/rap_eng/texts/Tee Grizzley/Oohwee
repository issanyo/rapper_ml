[Chorus: Lil Durk]
100 racks, bustin' out the Louie bag, ooh wee
If I like the bitch I'ma buy a Birkin bag, ooh wee
I just fucked a rapper baby momma, I'm like, ooh wee
Look at my jewels, look at my chain, I'm like, ooh wee
I just mixed the perky with the xan, I'm like, ooh wee
I just had a threesome with yo' friend, I'm like, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Fucked this bitch and gave her back, I just brought my killer strap
I put Chicago on the map, I'm a man, I'm a threat
Gang member and I rap, say he gang but that's cap
Johnny dang, that shit crap, fuck this bitch on Insta snap
Millionaire I got clout, fucked that bitch 'cause I got clout
Put a xanny in her mouth, put a perky in her mouth
We be in the field, for real, niggas they be in the house
Keep on frontin' like you like her, I'ma back door
And we got so many MACs, like an apple
And I got on Armani jean on my tracksuit
You ain't get no cash, don't ask hoe
I ain't got no xan, molly all in the capsule
Look at my wrist, look at my gang, look at my drip
Look at my bitch, Gucci snake, look at her hip
Got a LA bitch, she like the coke
I got a NYC bitch she say, "Yoke"
Even though I got a mansion, bitch, I sleep in New York
And the way I drip designer, like I sleep in the store
And she bad and boujee, if he rat I call him ratatouille
Look at the back of the jewelry
Got my AP from Shine, he got me shinin'
I got my choker from Izzy, look at these diamonds
Balenciaga running shoes, I be stylin'
And I'd rather dress myself, fuck a stylist

[Hook: Lil Durk]
100 racks, bustin' out the Louie bag, ooh wee
If I like the bitch, I'ma buy a Birkin bag, ooh wee
I just fucked a rapper baby momma, I'm like, "Ooh wee"
Look at my jewels, look at my chain, I'm like, "Ooh wee"
I just mixed the perky with the xan, I'm like, "Ooh wee"
I just had a threesome with yo' friend, I'm like, "Oohwee"
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
I put Detroit on the map, let them niggas get off
It's bags on all my bitch, they come outside and knock they shit off
These Jack Boys see that jewelry, they gon' make you take that shit off
The opps look like big boys, niggas can't touch me, I'm Big Dawg
100 racks on the other end like a kickoff, 10-4
Same day, we gon' kill dawg, y'all beef last for a year long
Outta town to go get the bag and that shit sold before I get home
Y'all sneak dissin' then see me, y'all get to dick suckin', you niggas weirdos
I came up from nothing, nigga, you can't tell me shit
Soon as I hit, call her nigga phone, "Come get this bitch"
You come meet her at the corner, bro, don't pull up to my crib
Big FN, if I let it hit, that car gonna flip
I done made it thru that mud and that rain
Reach for my neck, it's gon' be blood on this chain
That real nigga shit ain't on me, it run through my veins
You ain't gang, better run from that bang, I got aim nigga
Blah!

[Bridge: Lil Durk]
Ooh, let me tell you about Chicago and Detroit
Let me tell you about Chicago and Detroit
Ooh, about Chicago and Detroit
Gang gang gang!

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
I've been to O block, for real
I really don' seen them drills
Yo' bitch a freak, for real
Wet up her sheets, for real
Wet up yo' tee, for real
Show you how nina feel
How much it cost to show my face? A ki, for real

[Hook: Lil Durk]
100 racks, bustin' out the Louie bag, ooh wee
