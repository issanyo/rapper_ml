[Verse 1: Paid Will]
Rip Dada
Money on the flo, I'mma come get it
If a nigga want beef, we gone come with it
Young nigga been shitting, getting dumb chicken
Throw a bag at you, in 2 weeks I'mma come visit
6 Mile nigga but I'm plugged in yo hood too
Yo mans out the way, but you close so we slump you
Big booty bitch give me head in the front room
She with the pop ups, I don't even gotta tell her come through
This shit in my blood, shit I came out a thug
Ain't nobody give me shit, got it all out the mud
I ain't use no piece got it all off them drugs
My young dog strapped, better watch how you mug
Mil coming soon, I'm just waiting on the day
Niggas plotting on a chain, bitch I'm plotting on a Wraith
Feds snatched my niggas, trying to link me to the case
So a nigga lowkey, you'll never see my face
Bitch

[Hook: Tee Grizzley]
Money on the flo lets get straight to it
Beef on the flo lets get straight to it
Cold thick bitch bring her straight to me
Niggas sneakdissing bring 'em straight to me
Money on the flo lets get straight to it
Beef on the flo lets get straight to it
Cold thick bitch bring her straight to me
Niggas sneakdissing bring 'em straight to me

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
How that nigga Tee get out that RTM indictment?
I wasn't on that case keep yo dicksuckers quiet
When that smoke on the flo, we ain't sleeping on it
Bro said he saw the beef, set that boy on fire
Jump out the whip get his mans, rip them niggas flesh
Free the real, keep the rest, choppa eat the vest
My niggas used to share clothes, I'mma state the facts
We was still pulling niggas cards, fucking all the rats
Fast forward, now our goals gotten bigger
I be questioned on them murders I ain't fold on them bitches
Great Granddaddy was a slave I admit it
But they cop so much weight, I let my white boys say nigga
In the sleeve doing the dash, 'bout to pop the transmission
Joy road nigga, face card through the city
That nigga Will say he got the loud come and get
But don't even look into it if DaDa ain't fuck with you

[Hook: Tee Grizzley]
Money on the flo lets get straight to it

Money on the flo lets get straight to it
Beef on the flo lets get straight to it

[Verse 3: Masoe]
Money on the flo, nigga bring it straight to me
Shot the club up but you ain't stick around to see
I fuck with real niggas, streets label me a G
Free Streets, suite, 1 deep clean streets
A nigga squealed on him, gave my dawg a 6 piece
Get put 6 deep, think this grimy game sweet
Know the fit sweet, had it on for 'bout a week
Hustle like a bitch, high as god but can't sleep
Paranoid as fuck, I know all the shit that I then did
Heard he got hit with the 9, let me fill up my Sig
Don't want to see no pussy boys around me, we can't take 1 peak
Keep a thick bitch beside me, that's gone take this dick
Tee called, and its all good to pull up to y'all hood
Real gotta, we see eye to eye, Ray Charles stood
Can't forget about the days we made a ticket off the jugg
Connected from East to West im who yo plug call plug
Nigga
