[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
Rollie on, Rollie on
I just knocked a nigga’s bitch with my Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
Talking strong on the phone with the Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
I just beat a nigga ass with the Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
If I die bury me with my Rollie on

[Verse 1: Aoc Obama]
Dropped a bag on the jeweler, couldn’t wait my chance
Fifty bands in my dance, doing the Rollie dance
Fucked her thirty minutes strong with the Rollie on
Even had it on my wrist, water whippin’ zones
Forty one bust down, I’m going out tonight
Post a pic on the gram and get four thousand likes
Seventy bands on a watch, it’s a hood trophy
And to get it off my wrist, boy you got to smoke me
Had to cut my peoples off ‘cause he did me wrong
Anything that he gave me I got it gone
Then he switched up the pack on a hundred bows
I beat the shit out my plug with the Rollie on

[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
Rollie on, Rollie on
I just knocked a nigga’s bitch with my Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
Talking strong on the phone with the Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
I just beat a nigga ass with the Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
If I die bury me with my Rollie on

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Came home, dropped two Rollies and they both was sprayed
Hundred on my chain, Isotol on my ‘caine
Let me hear a nigga sneak dissing on my name
I’ma shoot at everybody with his last name
Riding up the road, my whole sleeve gone
See the ice through the tint, better see that thirty poking
Before I had a snapchat, bitch I had odors
JB had 300 before she met Lyor Cohen
I’ll drop a bird on your head
That chopper blow a third of the nerves out your head nigga
Posted on the curb with them grams
Stare too hard at my Rollie I’ma burn your dumb ass nigga

[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
Rollie on, Rollie on
I just knocked a nigga’s bitch with my Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
Talking strong on the phone with the Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
I just beat a nigga ass with the Rollie on
Rollie on, Rollie on
If I die bury me with my Rollie on
