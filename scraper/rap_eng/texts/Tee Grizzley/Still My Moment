[Intro]
Helluva made this beat, baby

[Verse]
I'm booksmart, street smart, but still with all that dumb shit
Right nigga to link with, wrong nigga to fuck with
In love with these streets, I just hate what they come with
If ain’t no lie detector test around, I can't trust a bitch (Rah, rah, rah, rah!)
Gas station gang, pull a lick, them pumps hit, yeah (Bow!)
Trampoline gang, make a nigga truck flip (Brrrap!)
You a fuck nigga and yo' ho a fuck bitch (Fuck bitch)
I don’t sprint, I don't jog, but still manage to run shit (Who run it?)
Pops used to trap from the nighttime to the sunlight
Still know his plug, I can get it for that one price
Shout out to 600, we ain't gon' talk about that one night (You got my word)
If we strapped and they strapped, it's a gunfight (Bang bang)
Real nigga school, you can not enroll (Can't get in, man)
Hip-hop artist with a pop to make you rock and roll (Brrrap!)
Boxin' gloves on this 'K to knock out your soul
You gon’ think this bitch had clippers when it knock off your ’fro (Brrrap!)
Only nigga wit' a deal still coppin’ blow (Nose candy)
Where 4G, he can hit that with his eyes closed (Famous)
So you famous, what you still got that nine for?
'Cause rappers droppin', rest in peace XXXTentacion (RIP)
Hey, I'm the voice of all my prison niggas (Yeah)
Them felonies don’t mean shit, I made millions wit' 'em (Yeah)
Fuck all that partyin' and bitches, come home get your riches
If a nigga told, find his whereabouts and go and kill 'em (Right)
I know where Doggy Bone live, I should kill 'em (I should kill 'em)
They say I can't be with felons, but I'm with some (But you know I'm with some)
And ten murders, we don't do those (Oh we don't do those)
Made your dog go to sleep with a suit on (With a suit on!)
Hey, I could pass out blessings (Yeah)
Lotta hundreds on me, I could pass out extras
Happy enough to pass out, I used to pass out testers
A nigga blow at me and miss, that's his pass to heaven (He's outta here)
I don't need no reference track for all this shit, I wrote it (Me)
I could prolly deal with beef, most that shit I quote it (No cap)
Tell these fuck niggas it's still my moment (It's mine, nigga)
Tell these fuck hoes it's still my moment (It's mine)
Rah (It's mine)
