[Intro]
ATL Jacob

[Chrous: Lil Durk]
I barely go on dates, so I hold yo' hand
Even if I grew up with him, I don't know yo' man
'Cause if I say I know him, I might blow my chance
Take you to the heart of the trenches, ain't no romance
We not together, but we make it official
This lifestyle forever, just make sure it fit you
Talk to me, walk with me
Caress on me, feel on me
Sex got a melody
Grip on it, spit on it

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
I don't throw hoes on my page, they don't make my 'gram
'Cause my other bitch might get mad, but I'ma take my chance
Bad bitch wanna see my show, wanna bring her friends
Put they name on the list, gotta get them in
Keepin' it lowkey, come to my meet and greet
I'ma give you a room key, girl, go wait for me
Said, "Fuck that nosebleed," she want a floor seat
Wanna get close to me, what you gon' do wit' me
Know I'm move deep, bitch, I'm too street
We not together, my baby, you just cool peeps
What yo' friend on, you know I had her before
You used to fuck with [?], I never met him before

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I barely go on dates, so I hold yo' hand
Even if I grew up with him, I don't know yo' man
'Cause if I say I know him, I might blow my chance
Take you to the heart of the trenches, ain't no romance
We not together, but we make it official
This lifestyle forever, just make sure it fit you
Talk to me, walk with me
Caress on me, feel on me
Sex got a melody
Grip on it, spit on it

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I bought her ass them booty shorts she want
[?] married, I do
You can blow a bag with me
I know rappers backstage
Ooh, that new Hellcat, that Fast & Furious (Skrrt)
I met her today (I swerve)
Just give me loctation (ASAP)
Why these bitches hatin'?
But these bitches basic (Facts)
I merched on J Money, I won't tell who I fucked last night (Shh)
Gotta watch out what you say to me, I smash on sight (Come here)
In the studio, got her name on my wrist right now (I know)
Forgive me what I did, I know you pissed right now (I know)
You the shit right now (Right now)
Get dick right down (Dick right down)
Put them drugs on my tongue, bite right down

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I barely go on dates, so I hold yo' hand
Even if I grew up with him, I don't know yo' man
'Cause if I say I know him, I might blow my chance
Take you to the heart of the trenches, ain't no romance
We not together, but we make it official
This lifestyle, forever just make sure it fit you
Talk to me, walk with me
Caress on me, feel on me
Sex got a melody
Grip on it, spit on it

[Bridge: Lil Durk]
Rest in peace Pimp C but let's get more hoes
She don't wanna share her secrets with me
But I know 'em already
Fuck your ex
I'ma show her I'm ready

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I barely go on dates, so I hold yo' hand
Even if I grew up with him, I don't know yo' man
'Cause if I say I know him, I might blow my chance
Take you to the heart of the trenches, ain't no romance
We not together, but we make it official
This lifestyle forever, just make sure it fit you
Talk to me, walk with me
Caress on me, feel on me
Sex got a melody
Grip on it, spit on it
