[Intro: Tee Grizzley]
I ain't gon' lie, bro, it be like... It's about the nigga. It's about you, bro. It's not about none of this shit. We y'all niggas go out y'all way to be turnt, that's how I know y'all niggas be lame as dog shit, nigga ('cause I was lit when I was broke)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Lil Durk]
I swear, we doggin' bitches
Niggas be killin' to get it
We all got millions to get
Bet you niggas be lame as shit
They wanna go to the hood (for what?)
I don't wanna see it again (we been there)
It might be a difference, less attractive when you really was livin' that shit
Nigga, you really a rapper
Niggas, can die for a caption
I drop to the streets in a [?]
You think we the same, you cappin'
You think you lit, you cappin'
I get my food from madness
Your roley over average
You know I'm oh for seven

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley & Lil Durk]
My hood is not no tourist attraction, it's not what I'm interested in
My block is not a twitter tutorial, so we not mention this shit
Me and Durk droppin' a tape, we need a million for this
Ay, how that your favorite rapper? He say the simplest shit
You bought her a Goyard bag for ten, you in your feelings and shit
Right hand to God, if she ask me for a coach purse, I'ma spit on a bitch
Outside of cameras, you don't tote guns, my niggas go swimming with sticks
I'm not tryna link up with niggas, I'd rather go chill with a bitch
Your favorite Instagram model, I had my dick on her lips
And I got choppers and power, niggas be wishin' for this
And we gon' really be slidin', I am not takin' a risk
And we gon' really link up, niggas be makin' a diss
If you was you, and I was me, I had my pole, I'd poke someone
If I was you, and you was me, ain't had no pole, I'd choke someone
Pull up to the studio, I hope you know I'm eleven deep
I could not pull up by myself, too many tryna niggas beef wit' me

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley, Lil Durk]
I swear, we doggin' bitches
Niggas be killin' to get it
We all got millions to get
Bet you niggas be lame as shit
They wanna go to the hood (for what?)
I don't wanna see it again (we been there)
It might be a difference, less attractive when you really was livin' that shit
Nigga you really a rapper
Niggas can die for a caption
I drop to the streets in a [?]
You think we the same, you cappin'
You think you lit, you cappin'
I get my food from madness
Your roley over average
You know I'm oh for seven

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Tee Grizzley]
Traphouse and property money
Only time I can sit wit' a rapper, my cup gotta be muddy
We drop this tape, don't call my phone, that it price gotta be thirty (30K)
I can't sneak no XD in this club, it gotta be thirty
When I go them trenches, they be tryin' rappers
If a robbin' nigga, try me, he a dying robber, yea, yea
I heard them rumors 'bout my bitches, just know I'm dying 'bout 'em
I exed out Durk, I picked up Durkio 'cause it sound better, let's get it
Would call them by their rapper name but I like clown better
Feds couldn't make me break boy I don't allow pressure
Nailed yo' bitch to the wall, I had to crucify her
If this rap shit didn't exist, niggas woulda been Uber drivers
Niggas be lame most of 'em, High school woulda cracked jokes on 'em
Nigga get mad, I'll punch on you, soon as you fall I'ma stomp on you
Really want war, let me know sumin'
Fa,mous everywhere still blow sumin'
Don't make a diss song, wait it out, catch 'em all, let 'em hold sumin'

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Lil Durk]
I swear we doggin' bitches
Niggas be killin' to get it
We all got millions to get
Bet you niggas be lame as shit
They wanna go to the hood (for what?)
I don't wanna see it again (we been there)
It might be a difference, less attractive when you livin' that shit
Nigga, you really a rapper
Niggas, can die for a caption
I drop to the streets in a [?]
You think we the same, you cappin'
You think you lit, you cappin'
I get my food from madness
Your roley over average
You know I'm oh for seven

[Outro: Tee Grizzley]
We doggin' bitches
Niggas be killin' for them
We all got millions to get
But you niggas be lame as fuck
For what?
We been there
