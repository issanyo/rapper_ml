[Intro]
And I heard the Lord say
You've been delayed, but not denied
Woo
Hey

[Chorus: Elijah Connor]
Got Versace on the hip, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar bitch
Two-fifty thousand on the ring, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar pimp
Do one hundred on the freeway, ayy
This here Ferrari, please don't ding
Donald Trump is on my wrist, yeah
It's a Rollie president

[Verse 1: Elijah Connor]
Just bought a Cadillac, Raf Simons knapsack, stupid ass on her
She ain't gotta worry, get it clean, get it dirty
I been workin' for a minute, tryna put a hundred on her wrist
Just for the night, I'ma get you excited
Do you know how to ride it?, lemme see, lemme see
I wanna know if you 'bout it, I'm whippin' three hundred thousand
I'm in the kitchen cookin' pounds and, let me know if you down with it

[Chorus: Elijah Connor]
Got Versace on the hip, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar bitch
Two-fifty thousand on the ring, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar pimp

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Choppin' it up with my nigga
They gave the wrong young niggas funds
My uncle shot at the police
They gave the wrong young niggas guns, ayy
I got that check and took off
They gave the right nigga a chance
Bought every house in my ghetto
Split up that work with my mans, ayy
I don't take lightly to threats
My niggas gon' shoot at his head
Them bullets the size of my dreads
So if he survive he the man, ayy
You get that lean by the pint
We got that shit by the keg
My doctor gon' risk his career
'Cause he write the script for my meds, ayy
Big hundred K on my neck
Got it after the rap
Coulda got it before rap
But the feds was watchin' my snaps
Cut him off if he watchin' your pockets
Reward him, he watching your back
That pipe ain't no good on my hip
So it sit next to your bitch on my lap

[Chorus: Elijah Connor]
Got Versace on the hip, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar bitch
Two-fifty thousand on the ring, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar pimp
Do one hundred on the freeway, ayy
This here Ferrari, please don't ding
Donald Trump is on my wrist, yeah
It's a Rollie president

[Verse 3: Elijah Connor]
South beach weather, bad bitch got cheddar
Young nigga with some money and Jamaica, hidden scholar
White suit, Met Gala, can't nobody do it better
(And I feel like Michael Jackson), walking backwards in Margiela's
Like the sidewalk, I see you standin' on that bitch
Fuck the side talk, I feel like money makin' ish
I'm on the grind boy, I'm tryna hit a mill ticket
It's my time, boy, It's 'bout time, boy

[Chorus: Elijah Connor]
Got Versace on the hip, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar bitch
Two-fifty thousand on the ring, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar pimp

[Bridge: Elijah Connor]
That's what I'm on right now, that's what I'm on right now
That's what I'm on right now, that's what I'm on right now

[Chorus: Elijah Connor]
Got Versace on the hip, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar bitch
Two-fifty thousand on the ring, yeah, ayy
That's that million dollar pimp
Do one hundred on the freeway, ayy
This here Ferrari, please don't ding
Donald Trump is on my wrist, yeah
