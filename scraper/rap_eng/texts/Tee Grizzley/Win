[Chorus]
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose (Helluva made this beat, baby)

[Verse 1]
90’s baby but I get to that money like ’86 again
Lost pops and fell off, we back rich again
Gotta thank God for that prison bid
Music got us looking like the family's selling bricks again
Been on tour, been on TV, own businesses
Still I pull up with that stick and flip the whip you in (Brr)
You don't wanna hear bout indictments in the case I caught
Then, bitch, quit listening (Turn off)
Free Mar Mar, he innocent
I was in the county indigent, now my pendant lit
Bitches love me, they go crazy 'bout that real nigga shit
Used to be a young follower, I was ignorant
If you don't want me to fuck her, go everywhere with that bitch, nigga
I'll drop a bird on your head
That chopper'll blow a third of the nerves out your head
Talking cash, shit, and we murdering that man
When they put them teddy bears on the curb for your ass, you lost

[Chorus]
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just  to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
700K in here and my bag in this room
But it's only for your eyes, why your man's in this room?
I don't know if he a snitch, now it's blood on your hands
If you think I'm 'bout to let him leave alive, you a fool
Got a record deal, my label don't like you when I hang out (For real)
And let me know that they ain't know me 'fore I came out
Kevin Liles, I know it's a risk to have these chains out
But I'm that same nigga that'll knock a nigga brains out
Ex bitch ran off with the Rollie, hope she make it stretch
I could've killed her lil' dirty ungrateful ass
But I'm more mad at myself for tryna date a rat
Plus I make 30 for a show, so I'ma make it back
Used to order Wendy's fries, bring a shake with that
Now its Benihana rice, put some steak on that
The Mustang used to always run out of gas
Now I'm in that Wraith, touch the paint and it's a body bag, nigga

[Chorus]
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my people wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose

[Verse 3]
I wanna see niggas win but everybody, you can't eat around
Some niggas, I wouldn't even go to sleep around
They had the bag, but ain't help me when they see me down
Same niggas DM'ing me tryna be around
Bitch, they see that Wraith and they think Meek around
Can't be around on choppers, yeah okay that's three around
Come get your friendly ass bitch before I beat her down
After I fuck, never again will she be around
It's crazy when your own people wanna bring you down
These niggas don't even know what they wanna beef about
He shot at me, and that's somethin' I can't sleep about
Drop his mama, leave the town, bitch, we even now (Brr)
How you gon' motivate the youth, rapping that gangster shit?
This what they like, so I'ma make the shit
But even still, this my life, I gotta claim this shit
So even if they didn't like it, I ain't changing shit, nigga

[Outro]
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
So I can buy whatever ice, buy whatever crib
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon, nigga
Without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose, nigga
