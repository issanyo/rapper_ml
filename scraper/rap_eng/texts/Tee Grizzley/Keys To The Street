[Verse 1]
I got the keys to the streets (I do)
I got the key to the D (my city, nigga)
Boonk got a lawyer from Cali
He say when he finished, he droppin' Philippe (that mixtape)
I went and blew out a Rollie, won't no nigga take it from me
Don't put your trust in these niggas or cuddle with bitches, bro, take it from me
Choppin' it up with big homie, he said don't try and outdo the city
Outdo niggas out of the city that's in the industry, you outgrew the city
I signed a deal with 300, now the hate comin' out of you, nigga
But it ain't no problem, my nigga, 'cause they choppers will fly through you, nigga
Broke before I got locked up, I was fucked up when I got out of prison
I ain't heard half of these niggas or bitches and don't 'member gettin' a dollar from niggas
Chillin', I'm up and I'm minding my business
I ain't tryna holla at nigga, I be a silent nigga
Favorite part of my body my pockets, my nigga

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' play with you niggas (play with you)
I ain't gon' play with you niggas (play with you)
I ain't gon' play with you niggas
I ain't gon' play with you niggas
I know the niggas that solid
You know the niggas that's snitchin'
You know the niggas that's dyin'
I know the niggas that did it
I ain't gon' play with you niggas (play with you)
I ain't gon' play with you niggas (play with you)
I ain't gon' play with you niggas
I ain't gon' play with you niggas
It ain't no point in you hiding
I want you, I'ma come get you
Them niggas you got with you pussy
These niggas I got with me with it

[Verse 2]
Came home like I ain't even miss none
I ain't even miss none
Tried to listen to these niggas song, they ain't sayin' shit, I can't hear none
Alright then, make it easy for me, five million in a month
Cold bitch say I'm well-spoken, spit a thousand bars, I ain't lie once
Last night I saw 50, it all belong to me
After I hit your bitch, can you come pick her up, I can't keep her with me
These niggas that's with me, they go RiRi for me
They'll work-work-work-work-work them choppers 'til I tell them to cease
Lawyer wanted 10 just to show his face
Before I had a Snapchat, I had an OTIS page
Before I had a Periscope, I had a JPay
Before this well done steak it was a state tray
First time I shot a gun, it was at a nigga
High School when I saw my first 10 bands
Understand, you ain't in the same bracket with us
My lil nigga 18, he the brick man
Bitch, I'm in beast-mode, tell 'em free Po, you ain't tryna deep throat, ho, what you speak for
If these niggas animals, I'm finna make a mink coat
Havin' people lookin' for him, like they Nemo
Won't tuck my ice, I ain't scared of a nigga
I'll put a hole so big in nigga
Watch so cold, like a fridge on a nigga
I do everything but depend on a nigga
Don't play with me nigga

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' play with you niggas
I ain't gon' play with you niggas
I ain't gon' play with you niggas
You know the niggas that's dyin'
I know the niggas that did it
I know the niggas that's solid
You know the niggas that's snitchin'
I ain't gon' play with you niggas
I ain't gon' play with you nigga
I ain't gon' play with you nigga
I ain't gon' play with you nigga
It ain't no point in you hiding
I want you, I'ma come get you
Them niggas you got with you pussy
These niggas I got with me with it

(Outro)
I know the niggas that's shootin'
I know the niggas that's killin'
You ain't gon' take my nigga chain
My niggas'll come take your spirit
You can't look me in my eye
(mumbling)
I'ma come handle my business
You know the niggas that's dyin'
All of my niggas still livin'
All of your niggas be droppin'
All of my niggas go get it
