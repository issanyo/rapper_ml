[Intro: Tee Grizzley]
Ahh, ahh
How we beefin' and you just seen me?
Pussy ass niggas ain't no real demons

[Chorus: Sada Baby]
Dread head niggas, big bread niggas
Duck who? duck what? only feds nigga
Got it out the mud, got a loaf of bread nigga
Run off with my work, I put it on your head nigga
Dread head niggas, big bread niggas
Duck who? duck what? only feds nigga
Got it out the mud, got a loaf of bread nigga
Run off with my work, I put it on your head nigga

[Verse 1: Nook]
I'm a dread head nigga, big bread nigga
Before I had a hundred bands, used to duck feds nigga
They done fucked around, let my brother out the feds nigga
We the new Baby and Slim and we brought juveniles with us
They'll put you on the T, now you get the big picture
OG's and young niggas, bet you can't fuck with us
My lil cousin a savage and he just sixteen
Cooked two niggas this year, he livin' out his dreams
Feelin' like Rich Porter with this brand new beam
Hit your ass in the melon, call that shit sweet dreams
I don't fuck with y'all niggas, my best friends is fiends
Four-twenty stoned, they'll have your house so clean
You ain't really 'bout that life, you just talk that shit
Nigga run off with my work, I'ma chalk that bitch
Blackballed my first record, I ain't like that shit
So I went and got ten, remixed that bitch, bitch

[Chorus: Sada Baby]
Dread head niggas, big bread niggas
Duck who? duck what? only feds nigga
Got it out the mud, got a loaf of bread nigga
Run off with my work, I put it on your head nigga
Dread head niggas, big bread niggas
Duck who? duck what? only feds nigga
Got it out the mud, got a loaf of bread nigga
Run off with my work, I put it on your head nigga

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Hold up, let me get my mans and them involved
Give a fuck if she with you, that bitch gon' answer when I call
With some niggas in the Sag, do you nasty 'bout that dog
You can't find him? Dar√©, go and knock his daddy off nigga
Threw some Ruccis on my 'Vette
Tell these pussy boys I got my Guccis on they neck
Went a hundred-fifty in that olive Hellcat
Fifty on my strap, thirty on my other strap
AR with a hundred rounds, who gon' play with that?
Money on your head, nigga who gon' play with that?
Now you need a funeral and who gon' pay for that?
Why chase a bitch when I'm the captain, I can chase them racks

[Chorus: Sada Baby]
Dread head niggas, big bread niggas
Duck who? duck what? only feds nigga
Got it out the mud, got a loaf of bread nigga
Runnin' with my work, I put it on your head nigga
Dread head niggas, big bread niggas
Duck who? duck what? only feds nigga
Got it out the mud, got a loaf of bread nigga
Runnin' with my work, I put it on your head nigga
