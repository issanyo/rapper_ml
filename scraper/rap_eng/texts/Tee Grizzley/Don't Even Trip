[Intro]
ChopsquadDJ on the beat so it's a banger

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
All bark, no bite, that's what these niggas is, hol' up
Put my whole neck on ice, that's what my jeweler did
Bust down paw, bust down bear, all of my charms
Patek on my left, AP on my right, all on my arms
Miami too hot, tell the plug get 'em to Boca Raton
Just got off parole, I hit the dope once, I choked up a lung
Take a nigga bitch, get deep in (deep in), Instagram hoes wanna meet him (wanna meet me)
If she ain't talkin' 'bout eatin' him (bitch eat it), leave that bitch in the DM
Just had a meeting with Diddy (Diddy), Durkio took me to Izzy
I go to sleep in Y3 (sleep), used to mix Nike with Dickies (facts)
Came a long way from my city (Detroit), I made it outta them trenches (them trenches)
Used to wear my uncle's hoodies and fitteds, even though I couldn't fit 'em
Now I'm at Lou's deli with the Glock out, lookin' for niggas, they not out
I'm killin' them niggas, they pop out, big chop stick get knocked down

[Bridge: Tee Grizzley]
That's a hunnid bands, two hunnid bands
Shit won't fall (shit won't fall), shit won't spill (shit won't spill)
Three hunnid bands, four hunnid bands
Half a M (half a mil), no advance

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Don't even trip (don't even trip), don't even trip
Look at my fit, that's too much drip, don't even trip (that's too much drip)
I only hit once, that's still your bitch, don't even trip (still your bitch)
I got that stick, I'm surgical with it, don't even trip
Don't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip
She just wanna flick, that's still your bitch (still your bitch)
Don't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip
I got that stick, nigga don't even flinch (don't even flinch in this bitch)

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
My ice like Klondike (What the hoe doin'?), got your bitch shiverin'
AP, that's a suicide slush (all flavors), wet floor, slippery
I got the bag like Migos and Gucci (I get the bag)
She rock a bag Emilio Pucci (Pucci)
Don't even trip, you know where she at
I just want the top, I'll Uber her back
This big ol' clip in the way of my drip
Diamonds they hard, I busted my lip
If I feel disrespected, this Draco gon' rip
I got the foreigns and guns like TIP
Ye, two hunnid grand (what it do?), broke my rubber band (damn what else?)
Half a ticket cash, it won't fold, won't bend (what my wrist cost?)
Two shows, one night, that's a eighty piece (Jerry Rice)
Four sprites, two pints, I pour eight a piece
Strapped up to the teeth, my enemies prayin' for peace
My gorillas get busy, and you know I'm from Memphis I'm fuckin' with Grizzley

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Don't even trip (don't even trip), don't even trip
Look at my fit, that's too much drip, don't even trip (that's too much drip)
I only hit once, that's still your bitch, don't even trip (still your bitch)
I got that stick, I'm surgical with it, don't even trip
Don't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip
She just wanna flip, that's still your bitch (still your bitch)
Don't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip
I got that stick, nigga don't even flinch (don't even flinch in this bitch)

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
Don't even trip when you see how that water be drippin' all over the Prezzy (splash, splash)
Wait, let me talk to the ladies, gotta put this in perspective
Don't fuck with me if you expectin' for me to keep callin' and textin' (textin' and callin')
Fuck her then go for her bestie, got that bitch callin' me messy
Necklace, heavy, pointers, carats
She seen it, starin', got caught, embarrassed
Location, send it, go get her, mansion
No panties, erection, naked, hol' up, catch it
Slide the Wraith up and down the lines when the sun outside
When I'm in your town I need 40 thousand just to come outside
Neck gon' glow, wrist gon' dance, two hunnid bands, what's my advance?
I blew that shit in a month and a half (facts), made it right back and I blew it again (facts)
If I want to I can do it again, run up on me, I'ma shoot at his head
Shoot at his face, I got that Drake, beat my case, free Tay-K
Me and Lil D body the beast, MAC in the cut, put you to sleep
Think shit sweet, you gon' bleed, bitch don't even trip

[Bridge: Tee Grizzley]
That's a hunnid bands, two hunnid bands
Shit won't fall (shit won't fall), shit won't spill (shit won't spill)
Three hunnid bands, four hunnid bands
Half a M (half a mil), no advance

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Don't even trip (don't even trip), don't even trip
Look at my fit, that's too much drip, don't even trip (that's too much drip)
I only hit once, that's still your bitch, don't even trip (still your bitch)
I got that stick, I'm surgical with it, don't even trip
Don't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip
She just wanna flip, that's still your bitch (still your bitch)
Don't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip
I got that stick, nigga don't even flinch (don't even flinch in this bitch)
