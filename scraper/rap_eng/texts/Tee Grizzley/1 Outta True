[Chorus]

I promissed that would never let you down
My hopes on you drag me into the ground
There is no way hapiness i found
Used to cry everytime and you were not around

[VERSE 1]

Fuck , am i that stupid
One year hopping man
Am i that stupid?
Yeah i won't change
For how much people
Listen to my music
My heart ain't about that
I ain't about that
Did i been slept
For all this time
Did i been dead
Nowadays they know more about myself
Than i even do
I been hiddin in my shelf
And i dont wanna to
I ve been trapped in my head
But what about you
Act like you dont know shit
Told you but denny it
I knew it would work
But at the time i couldn't quit
Now i ve been screaming fuck it
If they mock it
I might fucked up some shit
But you know that i admit
I thought you were great but you Turned out to be another mistake
You had your time
At the time i couldn't rhyme
Look at my eyes you see now im fine
So now tell me
Why you think you above
How can you be faking love
Was so damn blind
Though you would fit me like a glove
Yeah that was really dumb
Made my heart beat like a drum
Now look what i ve just become
Feelin free but you being numb

[VERSE 2]

And she asked if i was drunk
Or cried
Had a million reasons to
But i never lied
Knew it wouldn't happen
Boy i still tried
Then that motherfucker
Wish that i died
So i reborn...
Pussy ass bitch never wanted
To wake the beast
Evolutionary kid now im on killin this beat
They tried to open my eyes
Shit i couldn't belief
Now that i got some clout
That fake bitch wanna beef
And since that flop you ain't be doing shit
Im so sad for those three hundred who wasted their time listening shit
And dont say that im now acting mean
If i refer about me and your girl you really know what i mean
Everyone though it would be lasting 2 weeks
Maybe cuz you re both both way too weaks
She still look at me like im Zeus to greeks
You dont make her happy i might give you my techniques
Dont tell me what to do
When im trying to
Cuz After all that drama
I didn't even noticed about you
Oh do you think you scare me with your lil crew
I think you mad cuz unlike you bitch i did blew
Now you tell em all about your fake glory
If they only knew there is two sides of the story
Am i the one with the balls
Why they all show some fear
But fuck it afterall
Everyone want you disappear
Get my attention was your only goal
Useless piece of shit
2 of you and you got no role
Maybe just turn on the fucking cable
That might be the only thing that you fucking capeble
Randomly moving your hands
Why your behind that table
Thank god to the real one
Who make the duo stable
Sad how you had to
Put some pressure on your knee
You think you good
But no fucking one agree
2 out of 10
Thats what i would rate
And just 1 of the 2
In music got fate
You trynna do that shit
To get merit on school
Im sick of these retarded kids
Doing things to be cool

[HOOKER]

Yeah you so bad it feels like a curse
Your girl treats everyone it feels like a nurse
And im just thinking it can't get any worse
Why to make a diss if i kill you with a verse

[VERSE 3]

Para acabar puto please
Para lá de te armar
Nao é por andares de camisinha
Que andas memo a pausar
Por falar em camisinha
Boy nao continua a tentar
Porque se essa shit da mal
Só pode dar em atentado
E tou tentado
A falar mal sobre ti
E Nao queria falar dela
Ela desaparece minha cama
Magica faz te perguntar qué dela (cadela)
Vens me irritando
Fraco panda de kung fu
A gaja a que chamo de amante
Ouvi te chamares namu
E nao ha excessao nem senao
Quando chega outra festa
Ela tem tantos dedos na pussy
Como os tem de testa
E eu nao falho
Só em relaçao a isso avacalho
Engraçado como esse estupido
Move se ao som de um chucalho
E eu nem dou flex
So mostro orgulho
Cama da tua girl
É la que eu mergulho
Nah nao vim ganhar clout
Ja te achava merda desde o ano passado
Olhas para mim desse jeito
Porque a tua namorada nao se vê de lado
Agora falas do black
Seu wack
Ver te na merda again parece throwback
Eu nem preciso de sangue bitch mato te na track
Memo assim tenho mais gajos na back
Meteste te com um lobo agora lida com a pack
