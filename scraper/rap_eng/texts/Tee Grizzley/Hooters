[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
If I tell my niggas to die for me
And my niggas ask me to die for 'em
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Pre-Chorus]
If I tell my niggas to die for me, them niggas dyin'
And I'll do the same, this shit ain't one-sided
Hundred racks on me, no re-up, it's profit
Fuck up your city then meet with the pilot (Nyoom)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah,) we outta here
Yeah (Yeah,) yeah (Yeah,) yeah (Yeah,) we outta here, ayy

[Chorus]
Shittin' on niggas, no sewer (No sewer)
Teachin' these niggas, no tutor (No tutor)
Niggas run around actin' just like hoes
Go get a job at Hooters (At Hooters)
Shittin' on niggas, no sewer (No sewer)
Teachin' these niggas, no tutor (No tutor)
Niggas run around actin' just like hoes
Go get a job at Hooters (At Hooters)

[Verse 1]
Treat these hoes like one point gang (One gang)
I'm leavin' right after I score (Swish)
I walk in Gucci like "What you got in the back?"
"Don't want what y'all got on the floor" (Exclusive)
Just bought a crib in The A (Mansion)
That bitch look like a resort (Big)
Y'all do the shit for the fame
Keep the awards, give us the rewards (Okay)
Ayy, remember back when niggas doubted me? (Doubted me?)
My Prada fit on, is you proud of me? (Proud of me?)
Ain't got no Activis, Quali- me (Quali-)
Opps keep droppin', they tired of me? (Bow!)
Hey, little dog, keep my name out your mouth
(Keep my name out your fuckin' mouth, nigga)
I'm a big dog, have niggas that'll aim at your house
(Brrraaa! Pow!)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I tell my niggas to die for me, them niggas dyin'
And I'll do the same, this shit ain't one-sided
Hundred racks on me, no re-up, it's profit
Fuck up your city then meet with the pilot (Nyoom!)
Yeah, yeah, we outta here
Yeah (Yeah,) yeah (Yeah,) yeah (Yeah,) we outta here, ayy

[Chorus]
Shittin' on these niggas, no sewer (No sewer)
Teachin' these niggas, no tutor (No tutor)
Niggas run around actin' just like hoes
Go get a job at Hooters (Hooters)
Shittin' on these niggas, no sewer (No sewer)
Teachin' these niggas, no tutor (No tutor)
Niggas run around actin' just like hoes
Go get a job at Hooters (At Hooters, nigga!)

[Verse 2]
Label just called
Said the check was clearin' now
Take a dime, pin her down
Scream my name, lemme hear it loud
I tell a bitch to top me, that bitch gon' top me
Can't do the same, that shit one-sided
I just tacked on you a real big diamond
Shit, it's blindin', where did you find it?
Big face Relly, no tick-tock (No tick-tock)
Big boy bag, no Ziploc (No Ziploc)
She wanna talk to me privately (Privately)
Sendin' me pics of her privacy (Flick)
Please don't become a opp to me (No)
That's like screamin' body me (Bow!)
Police come get me I do like a G
And be quiet like I'm in the library

[Pre-Chorus]
If I tell my niggas to die for me, them niggas dyin' (Rah, rah, rah)
And I'll do the same, this shit ain't one-sided
Hundred racks on me, no re-up, it's profit
Fuck up your city then meet with the pilot (Nyoom!)
Yeah, yeah, we outta here (Gone)
Yeah (Yeah,) yeah (Yeah,) yeah (Yeah,) we outta here (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Shittin' on niggas, no sewer (No sewer)
Teachin' these niggas, no tutor (No tutor)
Niggas run around actin' just like hoes
Go get a job at Hooters (No tutors)
Shittin' on niggas, no sewer (No sewer)
Teachin' these niggas, no tutor (No tutor)
Niggas run around actin' just like hoes
Go get a job at Hooters (Hooters)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah (Yeah,) we outta here (No sewer)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah,) we outta here (No tutor)
If I tell my niggas to die for me, them niggas dyin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'll do the same, this shit ain't one-sided (No Hooters)
Hundred racks on me, no re-up, it's profit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck up your city then meet with the pilot (We outta here!)
Yeah, yeah, we outta here
