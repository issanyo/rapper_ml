[Intro]
I ain't gonna use the beat this time, I'ma get a little more intimate with 'em. You ready?

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
This is my moment, this is my moment
This what I wanted, this what I wanted
You know that I'm with it, you fuck with me, I'm goin'
When that money callin' I throw a bitch off me, I'm on it
I'm on it, nigga

[Verse 1]
I sat there and waited
For niggas to help me
All that talkin' they did, them niggas ain't show it
I sat there and starved, I remember the hunger
Ayy when I got a plate, bitch it was over
Game over
Nigga, back the fuck off me 'fore them killers get on you
Ooh, I ain't gotta be steamin', for these bitches to blow me
Ooh, beat my case in Kentucky, but they wanted to stone me
Ooh, one time for my bitch, I won me a trophy
Ooh, Neil mama know that her son safe
'Cause at all times I'm ridin' with him
Deangelo ever get killed, I can't tell the story 'cause I'm dyin' with him
I was just broke without a dime with him
And Cody, countin' pies with him
Matchin' APs, it's our time, nigga
Feel good to be alive, nigga
I know niggas, niggas cool
Fuck 'em, I'll kill anyone
But my niggas ain't gettin' touched
If they ever call me, I'm whippin' up
Hoppin' out and I'm liftin' up
50 shots on that glizzy drum
Niggas coppin' pleas, I ain't hearin' 'em
Obituaries gettin' printed up
Ain't no beef with you niggas
You niggas can blow me
Ooh, 50 racks on me, that's after the Rollie
Ooh, I wasn't comin' home? Oh that's what they told you?
I ain't killed nobody, bitch you know they couldn't hold me
Ooh, one time for my codefendants
Nigga, everybody stayed silent
Ayy Theo, we goin' to the grave
In assessment, nigga, we was wildin'
Ayy Juan tho when they split us up, my blood felt like lava
Pointin' out them niggas that shot you
So I can set them niggas on fire
Ayy Big T if you can hear me, dawg
I can't breathe without you, I'm drownin'
When Suge called with them bad news
All them tears had a nigga blinded
Ayy mom dukes, when you fought the feds
I just knew that you was gon' beat 'em
When they gave you all of that time
It ain't hurt 'cause I couldn't believe it

[Chorus]
But look, this is my moment
And this what I wanted
Before you fuck with me, just know that I'm with it
With whoever I'm goin'
Real niggas gon' listen 'cause I'm a real nigga
Can't nobody clone me
You fuck with my niggas, I'm comin' to get you
I swear that I'm on it

[Verse 2]
Ooh, ten bands for a feature
500 to answer my phone for you
I ain't got room for no leechers
Mothafuckas only call when they want somethin'
Niggas really out here snitchin'
Still runnin' 'round like they ain't told nothin'
And real talk, I'm scared of y'all niggas
Y'all will get a nigga Super Bowl numbers
Don't do it just for the money
You ain't gon' always get rewarded
When you one hunnid don't nothin' come with it
And when you're real you don't get nothin' for it
Long as them circles stay silent and loyal
What else is really important?
Watch me do this shit for all of my niggas
Watch me get this money tellin' my story

[Chorus]
Nigga, this is my moment, this is my moment
This what I wanted, this what I wanted
You know that I'm with it, you fuck with me, I'm goin'
When that money callin', I'll throw a bitch off me, I'm on it
I'm on it, nigga, like ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
