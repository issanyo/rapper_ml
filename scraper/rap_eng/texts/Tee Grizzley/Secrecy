I got a better way to hit that road but I can't say the route
I got a plug on some shit I ain't gon' say out loud
[I know somewhere you could] tax but I can't say the town
Don't never talk in this Benz, if you can't talk in the house
Cover up that 18 wheeler
Been back and forth I ain't seeing niggas
Did this shit on my own and I don't need niggas
This shit secrecy it gotta stay between niggas

[Verse 1: 42 Twinz]
Yeah, I'm in these streets hands on
I can sell anything I put my hands on
Ran that money up and then I put my mans on
Niggas think shit sweet cause my twin gone
I'ma squeeze 'til it's empty so don't play it wrong
I'ma get there at 6 it won't take me long
I rather make a sell before I make a song
I'ma see a mill soon with this shit I'm on
Chasin' money ain't got time for bitches
Big Glock on me, I swear I ain't playing with niggas
50-4 blow it take 4 days to get it
When you turn around it feel so amazing nigga
Bustin' down a 100 strip
Bust a Rollie, told my jeweler like you know my shit
Knock a nigga head so don't touch my shit
I'm a 4-2 nigga, I'm really with the shit
I told niggas I was next up
I had to get back to the trap and run my check up

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
You don't know how winning feels nigga have you every left this country
Ever had the pleasure of seeing your states junkie
Bought some Louis wear 'em once, let them get dusty
Look I know you saw some cash, have you ever saw some money
Boxes from Persia, decorator we rug changin'
Translator just to understand what my plug sayin'
Have you ever hired someone to watch your money
Then paid somebody else to watch him watch your money
Been on that road, I ain't seeing niggas
I'm with these niggas that I'm with cause ain't no greed in 'em
It's enough for only us, bro we can't feed niggas
Say they wanna kill you, make 'em do it, we gon' leave niggas
And if you didn't know now you know nigga
Broke nigga, my chinchilla hang to the floor nigga
Dope dealer, I control shit like a remote nigga
Go talk to Calvin, I don't fuck with no coat nigga
That's what I tell niggas when I think they 12 nigga
We just left the bales house, I know you smell niggas
You know how much I made when I hit the L nigga
This shit secrecy so I can't even tell niggas
