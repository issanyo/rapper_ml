[Intro: Jeezy]
Yeah, this for all the real niggas man, ya know
Woo! Yeah (it's gon' be a cold summer)
Hahahah, yeah, woo, uhh

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Gon' drop the top, you can feel the breeze
30 in the Glock, all you gotta do is squeeze
It just touched down, all you gotta do is sell 'em
And they gon' ask you questions but you better not tell 'em
Hey I'm 'bout to fuck it up, I'm bought in like 10
A couple bad tings and they all light-skinned
"Hey, how you comin' down?" In a rose gold Hummer
Wife beater chinchilla, it gon' be a cold summer

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Got it snowin' in the city, I'm 'bout to change the weather
So many birdies in this bitch, thought I was seein' feathers
So many pussies hatin' on me, I just want the love
Hottest niggas in the city, me and Mr. Rugs
Them young niggas paper'd up, that's straight from water whippin'
Hey, between me and you I think the water trippin'
$250 in my pocket, I'm a walking lick
Went crazy at the lot, bitch I'm a lunatic
My nigga Bleu got secrets he will never tell
Free Bale, yeah you know he see me with the scale
Indicator like I'm Mike, I'm fucking 'round with Jody
One time for Raw Cena, that my fucking woadie
One time for Ross, go tell 'em free the goat
Tell him in the 305, bitch I'm in on a boat
Got a 100 in my pocket, Free T. White
Two mill' on wheels and they all white

[Chorus: Jeezy & (Tee Grizzley)]
Gon' drop the top, you can feel the breeze
30 in the Glock, all you gotta do is squeeze
It just touched down, all you gotta do is sell 'em
And they gon' ask you questions but you better not tell 'em
Hey I'm 'bout to fuck it up, I'm bought in like 10
A couple bad tings and they all light-skinned
(Hey bruh, pull up, what you in?) In a rose gold Hummer
Wife beater chinchilla, it gon' be a cold summer

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Get-get that cookie money, on my Oakland shit
40 on a nigga, I'll blow this bitch
When I shoot, I don't miss or I net that bitch
Fuck her quick on the first night, I barely met that bitch
Too much money on me, bring that firepower
Knife on that chopper, they think Michael Myers got 'em
The rap fold, I'ma go platinum still
Cause I put my deal money in the blow, crack and pills
I'm from Detroit baby, that's a wild city
Hop on at yo block party and give the crowd 50
Aye Dex, when I hear that "huh", I know I hit it
I still fuck with Paid Will, Dada winnin'
Peezy and Pay, let's come together, this our city
Jeezy in the A, he fuck with Meech, that's our nigga
Rest in Peace to Great Lake ruler Darnell Lindsay
Still hit the kitchen to whip, Chef Boyar-Grizzley
Detroit!

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Gon' drop the top, you can feel the breeze
30 in the Glock, all you gotta do is squeeze
It just touched down, all you gotta do is sell 'em
And they gon' ask you questions but you better not tell 'em
Hey I'm 'bout to fuck it up, I'm bought in like 10
A couple bad tings and they all light-skinned
"Hey, how you comin' down?" In a rose gold Hummer
Wife beater chinchilla, it gon' be a cold summer
