Chopsquad DJ on this banger!

[Chorus]
I used to put licks on a floor (put 'em on a floor)
Now I get paid every time I kick a flow (flow, flow, flow)
Flexin' with my cousin money, I ain't had my own (I ain't had my own, I ain't had my own)
Now I forgot how many bank accounts I own (forgot what all I own, forgot what all I own)

[Verse 1]
When I'm talkin' I got the flow, my first four-five was a Colt
A hoodie used to be my winter coat, now it's thirty-five hundred for the coat
Only gettin' worn once, bitch, I'm gettin' bored, fuck
Used to line licks, give a fuck if it's a hot, don't put the sticks up
(let me tell y'all something)
Aye, used to hit licks with my uncle, he was older than me
Broke in my mans crib for the PS3, he ain't know it was me
That same friend got a heart problem, may he rest in peace
Had a heart attack, died in his bed, they thought he was sleep
Aye, Summer school, fifth grade, had real bad grades
My mans with the heart problem always came, didn't even have to, nigga got straight A's
In the joint had to gamble to eat, every morning I would play Spades
Niggas used to ball in my face

[Chorus]
So I put them niggas on a flow (flow, flow, put them on a flow)
Now I get paid every time I kick a flow (flow, flow, flow)
Flexin' with my cousin money, I ain't had my own (I ain't had my own, I ain't had my own)
Now I forgot how many bank accounts I own (forgot what all I own, forgot what all I own)

[Verse 2]
In High School got broke-up with, because I went broke
But wasn't no licks on the floor, couldn't even go take my bitch to the show
(watch this)
Now I get 50 a show, and she in my DM right now
She probably don't know that I saw it 'cause I ain't accept, I declined
Shout out to Rudy, that was my guy
Wore his Buffs to prom, I was shocked when he got that time
He probably shocked cause I'm sittin' on top
Niggas tried to sign me for twenty-five hundred, like that was some money
Crazy part is that I almost did it, I was fucked up, fuck it
Four words to my fans, wake up get money
If you ever get rich, you got blessed, you ain't get lucky
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, can't shit touch me
When I finally get married, can't no other bitch fuck me!

[Chorus]
I used to put licks on a floor (put 'em on a floor)
Now I get paid every time I kick a flow (flow, flow, flow)
Flexin' with my cousin money, I ain't had my own (I ain't had my own, I ain't had my own)
Now I forgot how many bank accounts I own (forgot what all I own, forgot what all I own)
