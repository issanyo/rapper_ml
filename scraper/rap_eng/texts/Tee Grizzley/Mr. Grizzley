[Intro]
My chain cost the same way I keep it, that's 100
Got about five chains, nothin’ but half a ticket
Hahaha

[Verse 1]
Huh, black Lamb with the black seats (Lambo)
Give her back shots 'til her back weak (Uh)
Huh, six figures when they tax me
Know some street niggas makin' M’s livin tax-free (My niggas)
Look, your bitch called but her bag cheap (Haha)
Huh, and we don't want the load 'less the bag cheap (Cheap)
Hit the dope then exhale like a spreadsheet
Hundred racks last week, that wasn't even a fast week (Slow)
Tell that bitch I'm tryin' to wake up to the neck (Neck)
I don't go to sleep in Nike, but I wake up to a check (Check)
Fuck a bitch, bust on her face, jump on a jet
Block her number, now her theme song Drake, "I'm Upset" (I’m Upset)

[Chorus]
Bust a Rolly down just to boast (Boast)
AP or the Patek, I don’t know (I don't know)
I’ma Warren Buff- and do the most
And this bitch so wet, it's like I threw her off the boat (Talk to 'em)
Lotta dirty money needs soap (Yeah)
If I text she might screenshot posts (Yeah)
This a tennis chain, not a rope
Broke up with your nigga, good move, he a joke (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I heard she don't answer DMs (Oh yeah?)
I’ma still shoot my shot like "What's the deal?" (What up?)
Ass so pretty, don't matter if it's real (Nah)
No competition, she know she badder than them (I got)
Six incomes, stay afloat (Yeah)
Couple Adderall, stay awoke (Yeah)
Instagram whore, I made her ride on this dick
She a cool little bitch, we caught a vibe at the Ritz (At the Ritz)
All these niggas wanna add they two cents (What?)
Little money never told big money shit
Trap nigga with a label, come sign for a brick
I can start a campfire 'cause I'm ridin' with them sticks, plus I

[Chorus]
Bust a Rolly down just to boast (Boast)
AP or the Patek, I don't know (I don't know)
I'ma Warren Buff- and do the most
And this bitch so wet, it's like I threw her off the boat (Talk to 'em)
Lotta dirty money needs soap (Yeah)
If I text she might screenshot posts (Yeah)
This a tennis chain, not a rope
Broke up with your nigga, good move, he a joke (Yeah)
