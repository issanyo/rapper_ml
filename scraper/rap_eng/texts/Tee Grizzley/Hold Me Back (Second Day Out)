[Hook]
Can't let these niggas hold me back
I can't let 'em hold, I won't let 'em hold me
Won't let these niggas hold me up
Can't let 'em hold me, I won't let 'em hold me
Said I'ma touch a million, it's gon' get done
I know I can do it, I know I'ma do it
'Cause when y'all sleep, a nigga gon' be up
When y'all sleep, a nigga gon' be woke
Can't let these niggas hold me back
I can't let 'em hold, I won't let 'em hold me
Won't let these niggas hold me up
Can't let 'em hold me, I won't let 'em hold me
Said I'ma touch a million, it's gon' get done
I know I can do it, I know I'ma do it
'Cause when y'all sleep, a nigga gon' be up
When y'all sleep, a nigga gon' be woke

[Verse 1]
Fresh outta prison, ain't no more excuses
Back in position, it's time to get to it
I wasn't even supposed to smash the Rollies
But bro was taking too long to do it
Drop me a cuban, 'cause beef hold the jewelry
I found me cuban, but not at the Jeweler
Glock with the Rollie, A.P. with Uzi
We start beefin Monday you not seeing Tuesday
10 bands for a feature
Watch the niggas that ain't got it, talk shit
Can't come up with 10, you live on this earth
Get on a spaceship and get off of this bitch
Missed a few summers, but I ain't missed nothin'
And shit niggas did, I did all of that shit
Stack the drum on that yap stick
Nigga you'll catch everything off of that bitch
Like you gotta kill me, I can't let you hold me, ayy
It's niggas that hate me and don't even know me, ayy!
I know some niggas that got killed tryna kill me aye!
Never made the Olympics, this Rollie my trophy
Before I go I'ma shoot 60, I'm Kobe
Nigga I'm solid, I been through that fire
Been tested like gold
Lost pops, and was heart broke
That's that shit I go hard for
30 stacks worth of dog food
Can't feed this shit to the dog though
Before I made parole, I had a big knife
Bitch was on me every time yard broke
I can't let 'em hold me, I won't let them hold me
Laid back, I'm a dog though
Really got stacks on deck nigga
Really got killers on Carrboro
Still it's good on sight niggas
Be with all bitches, I don't like niggas
K clip take 100 shots, I got lazy only put 90 in it like
Frrrrrrrrrrrruh, uh
I been promised, and I always preform
Went outside the norm
Ran it up out them MSU dorms
Before you tell me you loyal
Make sure your know the meaning
Before you go out and do crime
My nigga make sure you can sit for them seasons
I came out with dreads, more sick in the head, like I was on meds nigga
Aye I been the man, since I had the Mongoose with the pegs nigga
I had to starve, and I used to panic bro, I sat and begged niggas
Took my shot at the title, they get in my way, they get took off they ledge nigga

[Hook]
Can't let these niggas hold me back
I can't let 'em hold, I won't let 'em hold me
Won't let these niggas hold me up
Can't let 'em hold me, I won't let 'em hold me
Said I'ma touch a million, it's gon' get done
I know I can do it, I know I'ma do it
'Cause when y'all sleep, a nigga gon' be up
When y'all sleep, a nigga gon' be woke
Can't let these niggas hold me back
I can't let 'em hold, I won't let 'em hold me
Won't let these niggas hold me up
Can't let 'em hold me, I won't let 'em hold me
Said I'ma touch a million, it's gon' get done
I know I can do it, I know I'ma do it
'Cause when y'all sleep, a nigga gon' be up
When y'all sleep, a nigga gon' be woke
