[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Quavo]
Got a room full of foreign bitches, I can hit 'em without tryin’ (Foreign)
Got a hundred in my chopper, I can't miss you if I tried (Brrrow)
Nigga dissed me but he lame, so that shit gets no reply (Borin')
Fifty racks to put that Lear up in the sky (Whew)
We here for one night (Yeah,) we at the Four Seasons (Season)
They don’t want no beef (No,) these niggas ho vegans (Vegans)
We here for one night (Yeah,) we at the Fontainebleau (Miami)
This bitch so bad (Bad) had to turn her down to get time with you (Dime)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
(Quavo!)
When I buy new coupe, bet it's all fast (Skrt-skrt)
Room full of them bad bitches, we all smash (Woo, yup)
Room full of them rich niggas, got all the bags (Rich, ye-)
If we gotta go back to it we'll grab a mask (Grab, yup)
Keep pumpin' it to the hood like I was gas (Pump it, ye-)
Look at my wrist, it's spinnin like I'm mixed with Taz (Spin it, woo)
Little bitty-bit keep winning, she gon' buy some ass (Win it, yup)
If you don't believe her she gon’ leave you fast (Whoo)
Now, yeah
Twenty bitches, one glass, you don’t wanna match
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa
Call her Cinderella trap, we forever last

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Quavo]

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley & Quavo]
She wanna leave with us (Leave,) her friends wanna pile in (Pile in)
We might let ’em have the penthouse (Oh) 'cause we leavin' 'round six (Six)
I took the jet here (Whew,) we got a round trip (Yeah)
Four more shows booked, two hundred more thou' in (Damn)
Thankin' God that I made it out the trenches without gettin' whacked (God)
Mom's dukes was flippin' heroin, pops was sellin' crack (Momma)
Unc- got kidnapped, niggas callin' like we want a brick for him back (Whoa, whoa)
I'm really livin' my raps, use your head before I put fifty on that (Woo)
Huncho got the Protec, I flooded my Rolie with rocks (Ice)
Your bitch on my neck, I don't see how you deal with this thot, hol' up (Oh)
Niggas be talkin' like that just be winnin', tell 'em lil niggas I said they could stop (Woo)
I got a chopper, I call it Obama, whenever I pop it, it's like brrrack (Bop)
