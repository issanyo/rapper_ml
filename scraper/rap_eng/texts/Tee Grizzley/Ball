[Intro]

Yeah meech boutta get serious in this bitch my nigga, good lookin

[Verse 1]

Yeah, you know that grand mama you got
That keep a lot of money?
She was stuffin' for my grand daddy
She know about kentucky
Feelin' lucky lemme go and su-
Nah I ain't gon' say that
Almost fucked around and incriminated my a-rab
Y'all bum crumbs don't know the size of a block
Why you lookin at that money keep yo eyes to the plot
I would show love, and supply you with a lot
But I know you gon run off yo shoes tied to the top
Member' back in the days, I used to cop me a zip
Chop in the kitchen throw up something to wash they dishes
Don't need no food off that plate you gon be hot in the bitches
Making the same shit they giving off for college tuition
Not worried about pulling up lines of the lemonade
Clutchin champagne but got 10 that was minute maid
Come to my spot lemme show you what I hear today
You gon be like nigga I didn't know there was that many made

[Hook]

Bitches know, they know who generatin revenue
Niggas know, I don't just rap I'm flooding avenues
Fiends know, who can leave a hood infinity
OGs know young niggas can get shredded
But I know it's coming, I know the future in this fast life
Losing my life or hearing the judge saying I got life
Imma die anyway, it's just a sad life, so I'd rather ball to make up for them bad nights

[Verse 2]

I had hope for y'all lil niggas recently I gave up
And imma beat the fuck out that nigga sellin yall facebustas
Yo broke ass, got two babies, and yo back to achy
And yo baby mama suck me up she playing too crazy
8500 for me, I ain't got a code and it's pulling through the snow nigga we drank animals
You keep going broke you ain't clever with cabbage
You niggas since lacking like yo deadbeat ass daddies
What you brag about making, I spend on carpet maintenance
Yo crib ain't worth what I just spent on landscaping
Yall bums be like I hid my stash with a regal
Nigga I can spark that on my fist ain't upkeepin
I used to cop up some mail it to them loyals let it drop
I was so ain't used to selling but I never let it drop
Look like I'm out here sellin half miln' of butter but them
Fiends always be like he's a bad motherfucker

[Hook]

Bitches know, they know who generatin revenue
Niggas know, I don't just rap I'm flooding avenues
Fiends know, who can leave a hood infinity
OGs know young niggas can get shredded
But I know it's coming, I know the future in this fast life
Losing my life or hearing the judge saying I got life
Imma die anyway, it's just a sad life, so I'd rather ball to make up for them bad nights

[Verse 3]

I was taught to be good, or nigga be good at it
Sitting on a ***** so happened to be good rapping
Good trapping, just so happened to make it to school
If you can't meet my deadline, bruh I'm cutting you loose
I been foolin, band snatch your hooches, I had dem
Hollow points, head cracking drums nigga band practice
Lil nigga fuck a scale I ain't weighin shit, this a whole *****
So it ain't no point in weighin this, talking to D, please stop rapping, yo city ain't shit but a discovery packet
How you gonna tell the city where we recovering the package
Why you tell em we sell white and they need to bag it
I ain't even bragging nigga I forgot how to bag up
Need summ ask us, it's posts so masked up
Forgive me for the delay on the music I been working
Rather be on the streets than in the studio hurting nigga

[Hook]

Bitches know, they know who generatin revenue
Niggas know, I don't just rap I'm flooding avenues
Fiends know, who can leave a hood infinity
OGs know young niggas can get shredded
But I know it's coming, I know the future in this fast life
Losing my life or hearing the judge saying I got life
Imma die anyway, it's just a sad life, so I'd rather ball to make up for them bad nights
