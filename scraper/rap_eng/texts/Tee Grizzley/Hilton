[Intro: Tee Grizzley]
Antt did the track
He might die today
How my lawyer feel, he might be the case
How that witness feel, he might have somethin' to say
Beatgang, ahh

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Ayy, I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the, I been sleepin' in the
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton

[Verse 1: ? & Tee Grizzley]
These bows that I got stank up the building
These bows that I got stank up the building
These bows that I got stank up the building
These bows that I got stank up the building
(Come get these bitches)
Keep the clientele buildings
A lotto in a turkey bag, we not no pilgrims
We find a city then we milk it
(Ain't no room in that room), money to the ceiling
Got a brand new chop, you know I filled it
Brand new opp, you know I killed 'em
JB on the job, we got millions
Keep the chopsticks if I need Kidd-Gilchrist

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley & Sada Baby]
Bust that brick open, let me see them flakes
Touch that nigga skin, he might be a snake
I like how that Benz feel, it might be a Wraith
Don't like how my Timbs feel, Ballys on today
I just got back off that road, I might go back today
And I get triple what I pay, I might come back with Wraith
Huh, like how your bitch feel, get her out my face
Hey, fuck how your kids feel, they daddy out the way
Hey I know that nigga lyin', just look at his face
My lawyer want a dime just to look at my case
Huh, your lawyer wanted ten, I gave mine a dub (for real)
I just shot another nigga, might go on the run

[Verse 3: ?]
Put my lil nigga on the road 'cause he old enough
Put your lil sister on the pole 'cause she cold enough
Got another sale, forty more just ain't gon' hold you up
Since Unky them got set up in the K, ain't shit slowed us up

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Ayy, I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the, I been sleepin' in the
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton

[Verse 4: ?]
God can you tell Flake that we still up
Niggas rappin' but we really had a pill run
Yeah we really had a pill run, yeah we really had a pill run

[Verse 5: ?]
A hundred bands stashed under the mattress, had to have that shit
We hardly get a hold of that shit and try to bad kick
Fifty bow sale on the floor, make sure I bring my stick
Steppers on stand-by case the plug don't want to send that shit

[Verse 6: ?]
Two-hundred grand cash in the roof of the Trailblazer
Get it to the crib, send it back about a day later
Try to plot on this and get you flushed like the radiator
Nigga don't you see this ice, I'm colder than refrigerator

[Verse 7: ?]
They on the elevator, T, I got them bitches comin' up
We finna run 'em up, these young niggas, they can't fuck with us
Niggas tuckin' what? T got all his fuckin' chains on
I blow his brains out, I catch him slippin' at his man's house

[Verse 8: ?]
Caught that nigga slippin', we persistent, brought them K's out
Since that nigga T came out I promise you ain't seen no drought
Thirty bands in my joggys, bitch I'm talkin' right now
You don't get three tries, miss once and you gon' strike out

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Ayy, I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the, I been sleepin' in the
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
