[Hook: Masoe]
They investigating what we making
But you could never count, nigga weigh it
Pull up to yo spot and leave it vacant
That's the consequence that come with hating
If I ever get a chance I'mma take it
That's the only way that I'mma make it
We was with the shit when you was faking
Never signed my name on no statements

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
You know I talk a lot of trash I'm Oscar the grouch
Tell these Elmo ass niggas shut they fucking mouth
Send shots at me on twitter, I send shots in yo house
Yo bitch is blessed to live, cause I shot in her mouth
Can't be without the pistol with this kind of cuban on
Two-kilo grams I need pads for my collar bone
I might be back in prison by the end of the month
I can't stop fucking with them drugs, that's what got me on
Free Will, free Tay treat 'em like my brothers
We get money, we'll bust you, we some sharks that'll hustle
I had a cellphone in prison Noah 'll vouch for me
Free them gangsters and them lawyers I met in Kentucky
Bow down when you see me, boy I run cities
Me and hustle with 2 models, we don't run bitches
If you seen me a Mose you would run from me
If I put you niggas on, you would run with it

[Verse 2: Paid Will]
I only trust my plug, cause if I'm down on my knuckles he would front me a dub
That ain't my type of scene, that's why you don't see me in clubs
Disrespect one of us we put one in yo skull
Chain hitting in the dark, yo shit look dull
Bitch my pockets on fleek and the clip on full
Burn a nigga spot up bitch we back on boil
Came from a wild hood, I was thrown to the wolves
Bitch nigga, I ain't never wrote a statement
Free my real niggas locked, who stood tall in them cases
Yeah I'm still in the streets, momma know I'mma make it
I can eye ball all the work, I ain't even gotta weigh it
Picking through these bows, I been up late slaving
Keep oversleeping all this lean I been drankin'
Forty leave a nigga stiff you would think he was planking
You know violated if we catch you out dangling, nigga
RIP Dada

[Verse 3: Masoe]
Got a discovery package and I discovered niggas hoes
We then took hella chances, not for you to get in there and fold
I listen to the code, get a bow and split it, give my dog one
Saying Dada winning bitch you speaking on the wrong one
Feds building cases, say we moving like we on something
Dog was mugging, step to him, he ain't know nothing
Whole crew buzzing, grind for it, one hand in nothing
Bro bro really bout it, you wouldn't know cause he ain't said nothing
Real head buster, my momma from the gutter
She used to sell her stamps just to buy clothes for us
Now I'm big dog, niggas copping lows from us
Long way from nicks, used to slang 'em in a dozen
Rap the trap, nigga give yo ass a CD with a onion
Niggas hunting, got me on my toes like bunions
Loud pack got the room reeking like Funyons
Wild boy pussy I'll lay the blow in public nigga
Money Nigga
