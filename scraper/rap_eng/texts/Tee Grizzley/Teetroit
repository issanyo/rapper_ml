[Chorus]
Ain't no love in my city, blood on my city
Shell from them slugs in my city, hol' up
They wanna take the guns out the city
All them boys got too many
Try to make us be a victim, they gon' riot like the 60's
Ain't no love in my city, blood on my city
Shell from them slugs in my city, hol' up
They wanna take the guns out the city
All them boys got too many
Try to make us be a victim, they gon' riot like the 60's

[Verse 1]
The shit ain't new, it been chaotic since the them bombings
Trap out with that pistol nigga, do we have problem?
Welcome to Detroit, where one day it'll be quiet
The next day that body counter shoot up to a thousand
I grew up on Joy Road it's a lotta villains
How we gon' put them choppers down, these people tryna kill us
Cause they puttin' up prisons, stadium for the Pistons
Only thing niggas ain't puttin' up is the pistols
Crack and heroin, came to crash the whole system
Saw my cousin serve his momma, shit made me vicious
Detroit public schools ain't even teachin' the children
The ambulance takin' too long to reach the victims
Police doin' illegal raids in my whole section
Destroying black owned businesses by the second
My city took a hit, construction to repair the damage
This ain't the time to be weak, we gotta stick together
Is you gon' get a weapon or go get a reverend
I remember talkin' to my granddaddy
He said Detroit ain't been the same since '67
If it wasn't for that it prolly be some money in my family
How the fuck you think that make me feel
If anybody doubt that what I'm sayin' real
Type Detroit versus Baltimore, 1967
They postponed the game they ain't want their players killed

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in my city, blood on my city
Shell from them slugs in my city, nigga
They wanna take the guns out the city
All them boys got too many
Try to make us be a victim, they gon' riot like the 60's
Ain't no love in my city, blood on my city
Shell from them slugs in my city, hol' up
They wanna take the guns out the city
All them boys got too many
Try to make us be a victim, they gon' riot like the 60's

[Verse 2]
A violent public disorder
These boys on fire and they ain't want no water
You call it protocol, that shit really torture
They see us livin' and we gettin' it they tryna destroy it
Disturbance in Detroit, Michigan
Let us live in peace or we tearing up this bitch again
Heard the goverment got some people they wanna send 'em in
And we ready to show our strength

[Outro]
Cause ain't no love in my city
Too much blood on my city
Come get these guns out the city
Before we riot like the 60's
Ain't no love in my city, nigga
Too much blood on my city, nigga
Come get these guns out my city, nigga
Before we riot like the 60's nigga
