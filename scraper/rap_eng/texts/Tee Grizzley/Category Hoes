[Chorus: Lil Durk & Tee Grizzley]
I got vulture hoes (You do)
They be slutty as shit (For real)
Some be sippin lean (How much?)
Cup be muddy as shit (Damn)
Got too many friends(Oh yeah)
Bitch too buddy and shit (That's crazy)
She don't bring up her past (She don't)
I know she fuckin' him (Wait)
But she don't fuck with him (For real)
That hoe be stealin' from him (Yeah)
Cool lil' bitch from the hood
But don't get to feelin' this bitch (I'm not)
She hit the mall every day (finesse)
She just be giving me shit (finesse)
That's 'cause she ain't got a bae (What she got?)
She play with the giffys and shit (Yeah)

[Bridge: Lil Durk & Tee Grizzley]
I'ma put you on my scammer bitch
I'ma put you on my savage bitch
I'ma put you on my hooper bitch
I'ma put you on my uber bitch
I'ma put you on my shooter bitch
I'ma put you on this tutor bitch
I'ma put you on my cougar bitch
I'ma put you on this hooper bitch
I'ma put you on my bad hoe
That hoe be hanging with factors
She wanna bag
She be in her bag though
I hit that hoe until her back broke
She want me to be her backbone
That pussy I'd do the dash for
She know a young nigga cash long (She know a young nigga cash long)
She gon' pop out when her man home (She gon' pop out when her man home)
I just want some head my baby don't act slow (Just want some head my baby don't act slow)
Right after this you know you goin' back home (Right after this you know you goin' back home)
You 'bout to go kiss on that nigga you dead wrong (You know you dead wrong)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
You talkin' threesome for them flights, I'ma pay for them
Don't fuck on the first night you goin' to H&M
You lost so many times, feel like you hate to winOur first-time fuckin' that lil' hoe, I'ma break her in
Hundred thousand worth of jewels, that's how I made an M
Thirty thousand for a show that's why I gave a ten
K, that's my bae
I know these niggas lyin' in her DM everyday
But wait, let me talk
I just gave my bro your number y'all should go and talk
Link up, smoke and fuck
Don't be shy, no no, open up
Bitch, you basic, ask for cash, bitch, you crazy
You know I'm crazy, let my side bitch wear your bracelets
She got on Gucci track pants
Come and gimme lap dance
I'm just tryna pop out, feel like Katie Got Bandz
Oh oh oh, get naked for me
Oh oh oh, get naked for me
Take your pants off and get reckless for me
Me and Tee inside that room with them bitches goin' get [?] too
Ya ya ya ya

Ahh yeah on these bad hoes I don't know

Be late at night we pouring it up

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
I got a bitch in the 'jects, she used to give me her checks (turn up)
Gotta stay tight down there for a nigga, she just be givin' me neck (she just be givin' me neck)
She a lil' down ass bitch, had to go get her a bag (ohh)
She told them she wanted that big O, that lil' bitch sick in the head
First time hittin' my college bitch, I tried breakin' her bed (breakin' her bed)
She got insomnia, but an orgasm make it easy to rest
She got a quad, that's four roomates, so we had to wait 'til they left (let's get it)
And she got tired of eatin' on campus, brought her a plate from the chef (eat up)
