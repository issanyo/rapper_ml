[Intro]
Court cases, niggas stayed silent
To this day I thank the Lord for it
Askin' me about such and such
I ain't say nothin', too much love for 'em

[Chorus]
I done had some conversations that can't be repeated
For the sake of some of my niggas' freedom
We done did some shit, I know so many secrets
Tell them other niggas that know 'em I hope ya’ll can keep 'em
I know about some situations I can't ever say
'Cause they can't give us life, so I can't ever break
I just pray to God I make it through the day
'Cause I done did some shit I'm takin' to the grave

[Verse 1]
It was a summer day
Niggas creepin' on us in the black car
'Round this time we was beefin' heavy
So we kept a choppa in the back part
We ended up gettin' the upper hand
I just know that hundred shots cracked cards
I'ma leave it there, I ain't say much
But I hate I even went that far
It was two of us when that popped off
Took an oath, I'ma not talk
So if the story get leaked out
I know whose face I'ma knock off
These niggas with me
When it's beef, they'll come and kill everything movin'
I'll never tell you what I think
I'ma tell you what I know, I done seen them boys do it
After it happened, it never happened
Get rid of anything that can tie us to it
Go clip for clip with my enemies
Then go wait a trial with them prosecutors
Niggas snitchin' on their homeboys
I don't see how they do it
I don't see how them niggas still livin'
I know their mans in there goin' through it
Like right, right, right, ayy

[Chorus]
I done had some conversations that can't be repeated
For the sake of some of my niggas' freedom
We done did some shit, I know so many secrets
Tell them other niggas that know 'em I hope ya’ll can keep 'emI know about some situations I can't ever say
'Cause they can't give us life, so I can't ever break
I just pray to God I make it through the day
'Cause I done did some shit I'm takin' to the grave

[Verse 2]
Me and bro chillin', just talkin'
Told me how he blew a nigga's head back
Shit fucked me up
Stop the conversation, nigga, dead that
Whatever happened, it never happened
Don't tell none of your mans that
I ain't sayin' that your niggas rats
But I don't want you to chance that
Me and Cook talkin', what was said
It can't be repeated, nothin' about that
Can't believe them boys kept it
Hopin' people never find that
Marvin trippin' since 2012
Like lil' bro where your mind at?
Lost unc' back in '011
Granny's eyes still ain't even dried yet
Rest in peace B, I know who did it
Yeah I know you did it, nigga
You prolly can't hear me 'cause you dead too
But I don't know who killed you, nigga
Had my mama down in them feds
She said, "Son you a real nigga"
It's your time, so I made it back home
I know how it feel, nigga
Like right, right, right, ayy

[Chorus]
I done had some conversations that can't be repeated
For the sake of some of my niggas' freedom
We done did some shit, I know so many secrets
Tell them other niggas that know 'em I hope ya’ll can keep 'emI know about some situations I can't ever say
'Cause they can't give us life, so I can't ever break
I just pray to God I make it through the day
'Cause I done did some shit I'm takin' to the grave

[Outro]
I've been around
Shit I can't say nothin' about
Hit 'em up, blaow, blood on the ground
If you know about it, don't open your mouth
'Fore they huntin' you down
You know about it, don't open your mouth
Or they huntin' you down, hit 'em up
