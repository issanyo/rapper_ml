[Intro: Tee Grizzley & Meek Mill]
These niggas prayed on my downfall (They did!)
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall (True shit)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I pour the D'Usse like I'm John Wall
Counterclock the pyrex up in the kitchen, I need this shit cook crack
I made a milli from rappin' and I ain't look back
I brought that Dawn in my hood, they was like, "What's that?"
They tried to tell me I lost, nigga, I shook that (shook)
Bein' broke did somethin' to my soul (soul)
Had a nigga locked down, 23 in the hole (hole)
Touch down, came home, pourin' Ace up with Hov' (Hov')
I done bagged a popstar, put a Wraith on the road
Thank God, ain't it a blessin'? (What?)
We made it out from State Road, from all that stressin'
After them chi-chis, writin' them letters (what else? What else?)
Collect call on them bitches, they intercept us (hey)
I'm from Philly, nigga, but that money long as Broad Street
Four deep, I got floor seats watchin' 'Bron ball ('Bron ball)
Beef with corny niggas, corn beef, we don't mind y'all (mind y'all)
If it's really beef, I will find y'all (find y'all)
If that nigga hate, fuck his main and his side broad (and his side broad)
Yes, I bought stress with that work through that mail
We gon' kill you if you nervous, if you nervous, you might tell (if you nervous, you might tell)
One-thousand three grams, a birdie on the scale (scale)
She got the head like that ho went to Yale (Yale)
I only fuck if that pussy don't smell (for real)
I bought that bitch a new purse at Chanel (for real)
I told her hold down this Glock, if it's real
Cuz I'm on probation, I can't go to jail, no

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley & Meek Mill]
They still prayin' for my downfall (Free Meek)
I feel 'em prayin' on my downfall
From the yard to the streets, I'ma stand tall
I won 50 on the Eagles, split it with my dogs
Tell her get the 1s, no money guns, I need this shit thrown right
Private jet when its urgent, gotta get flown right
Brandon Graham from Detroit, nigga, that's home right
Expensive designers can't fit big niggas so my clothes tight
Pershing to Cody, now it's New York to Cali
Rosecrans to Hollis Deli, Free G-Weeder, that's my family
I went platinum, I get paid to be on camera
I'm the only nigga from my generation with a mansion (Free Meek Mill)
Other niggas from my generation dead or in the pen
Still pray for them niggas 'cause some of 'em my mans
Niggas shot my little brother, I jumped in that van
Now them same niggas won't breathe again, speak again
I fuck with LeBron but the money tall as Shaq, bitch
Longest Mac bitch, catch this Mac clip
Spend a night with me these bitches gotta get they tracks fixed
I don’t know how long I’ma last in this rap shit
So that deal money gotta invest it in this bag, bitch
Ayy, I wear that glizzy like it's fashion
A bitch know not to treat me like I'm average
Don’t take this bag if it's too much for you to manage
Only joke around the circle, don’t let niggas see you laughin'
Ayy, who you lil’ niggas talkin' to?
If you ain't my mans and we argue, I'm offin' you
If you hit my trenches with that chain, it's comin' off of you
I might buy your bitch a pair of Yeezy's, they comfortable
Turned my niggas into bosses, that’s what bosses do
Why you niggas askin' for my number? I don’t fuck with you
Got a nigga from Chicago, he got money too
But that boy'll still eat your chain like a Lunchable
Rollie on my wrist and it’s fully sprayed
Got these niggas pocket watchin', they like what he paid
Bitch bad like Beyonce, sippin' lemonade
With the D’usse they can't do me 'cause a nigga made

[Outro: Meek Mill & Tee Grizzley]
I know they praying on my downfall (they did)
These niggas prayed on my downfall (they did)
They still praying on your downfall (for real)
I pour a deuce up like I'm John Wall (for real)
