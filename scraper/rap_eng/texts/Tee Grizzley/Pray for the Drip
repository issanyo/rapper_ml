[Intro: Offset]
Hey, woo
Helluva made this beat, baby
Woo

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley & Offset]
My cousin said, "This how you do it" (Listen up)
Let the dope money hide in the music (Dope)
Can't say goodbye to the trap (Bye)
Got a whole brick of white and it's wrapped (White)
I used to stay on that bitch (Hoo)
Just bust her down at the wrist (Smash)
Just bust her down like a zip (Smash)
Now when I shoot my shot it's a swish (Hoo)
When the police tried to get me (Hoo)
I used to run and jump fences
Now when I'm pullin' up, it's a Bentley (Skrrt)
I became one with the mission (Agh)
We like skydivers, everybody strapped
And we like a good audience, 'cause everybody clap (Doo, doo, doo, doo, hey)
Yo' bitch like a rehab, everybody cracked (Cracked)
Laser on the Glock, trip and everybody zapped (Doo)

[Bridge: Tee Grizzley & Offset]
Let me take 'em back (Let me tell 'em my story)
2007 (Hoo)
Got on my knees (Got on my knees)
Looked up to heaven (God, please, Amen)
And I used to pray for the drip (Pray)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Offset]
I used to pray for the drip (Amen)
I used to pray for this shit (I swear)
I used to pray for this shit (I used to pray for this shit)
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this (Couldn't wait, nigga)
So I had to grind like that, just to shine like this (Grind)
I used to pray for the drip (Amen)
I used to pray for the drip (Oh Lord)
I used to pray for this shit (Oh Lord)
I used to pray for this shit (Amen)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Sat in the cell, and I felt defeated (Defeated, defeated)
Open the Bible, I read it (I read it, read it)
The world is so cold, anemic (Cold)
Suicide doors on the 'Ghini (Skrrt)
I looked in the eyes of a demon (Hoo)
Martin Luther, think I'm dreamin' (Hoo)
We go Freddy Kruger, choppers singin' (Agh!)
Back and forth with the racks like Serena (Racks)
Ready for the times like this (Hey)
Big boy Patek, make a pattern with the wrist (Patek)
Big stones, baguette the fist (Stones)
Got a bigger bone, the Sig don't kick (Brrt, brrt)
Styrofoam, double up, Twix (Mud)
Bitch, eat it up, we gon' reel in the fish (Eat, eat)
Jump out the licks, jump out the sticks
Bentley Bentayga, big body kicks (Big body)
Put it on the gang, we won't flop (Gang)
25 thots on the boat dock (Thots)
Don't try 'Set, I hope not (Hope not)
You gon' have a tan when your toes out (Brrt)
I did it for the bag, no clout (Bag)
Leave it in the pad, it's the old route (Hoo)
Lamborghini drag, bring your ho out (Skrrt, skrrt)
Drippin' out the coca', I prayed for the drip (Prayed for the drip)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Offset]
I used to pray for the drip (I did)
I used to pray for this shit (Amen)
I used to pray for this shit (Amen, I used to pray for this shit)
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, couldn't wait, nigga)
So I had to grind like that, just to shine like this (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, I couldn't wait, nigga)
I used to pray for the drip (Amen, I used to pray for this shit)
I used to pray for the drip (Oh Lord, I used to pray for this shit)
I used to pray for this shit (Oh Lord, that's on my momma)
I used to pray for this shit (Amen, I'd trade my life for this shit)
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this (Couldn't wait, nigga)
So I had to grind like that, just to shine like this (I couldn't wait, nigga)
