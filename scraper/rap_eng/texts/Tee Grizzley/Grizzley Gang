[Intro]
Gang in this bitch we got them sticks in here
If being a real nigga was a job alotta of y'all niggas would be unemployed

[Verse]
Hov told me quit puttin' that money to my ear
I gotta get used to this shit I'm just not gettin' here
Dropped ice cream Wraith and it ain't been a year
Ever since I hit his bitch that nigga been in tears
Man, nigga rest up Mal they said it was my fault but I never called for help
Damn, nigga rest up pops
I wish I woulda been the one blowin' back at the opps
Lil' bro if I get killed don't cry
But before you turn up for me somebody gotta get dropped
If you get killed I can't help it but to cry
They  gon' think I'm ice skatin' every corner I'ma slide
Nigga, gang in this bitch we got them sticks in here
Watch who you bump my nigga we'll split your shit in here
Bro, matter fact just get the hoes and we gon' dip from here
Cause niggas testifying on me that's my biggest fear
Can't even eat with these niggas
Cause I done seen them real life sneakdissin' nigga
Then see 'em on they page next week with the nigga
Same nigga they was talkin' 'bout, boy you can't come around
Bitch you can't even get the line, hit the E-Mail
Used to fuck with dawg, he got to actin' like a female
When I was fucking with him he was looking like Big Worm
Cut that nigga off, now he Ezal
Niggas sayin' free they mans, shit be killin' me
You ain't put nothing on his lawyer, how you want them free?
Sayin' RIP they mans, shit be killin' me
You ain't do shit to the niggas that put them on the T
After awards a lotta stars in the place
I left early, I rather be with the stars in the Wraith
Why you carry all that money, get a card from the bank
I had it hard this motivation, I need this shit in my face
From the yard with the shank to hit song out the gate
Got the money, got the fame that nigga still didn't change
For these chains around my neck I worked my ass off, serious
Niggas stare to long, take his head off, period
What you think a bitch'll do for 30K, I'm curious
VS in the Rollie boy that shit beyond ridiculous
Why you tell that hoe you had some money, boy you tricked at her
We be laughin' when they say they shooters cause it tickle us
Bitch, I was just broke layin' in the bunk
Now I can make 200 thousand in a month
If I fall off, hit your pockets, nigga give it up
Without the pistol cause you sweeter than a cinnabon
Told my nigga right now, I can't give you none
Let me triple this shit up then we gon' split it up
Walk up on these niggas when I hit 'em up
[?] up, then take off runnin' that's a hit and run
Nigga, gang in this bitch we got them straps in here
Ain't even gotta up the pipe, beat you death in here
They got they cameras out before I even step in there
I'll put 30 on his baby, don't think Steph in there
Nigga, gang in this bitch we got them pipes in here
Try show off for these hoes, lose your life in here
I came home 2016 had a light year
Real niggas winnin' that's a fake nigga nightmare
Makin' pictures with your bitch on my Snapchat
Ex feelin' so the stick I can't snap that
I need that new Phantom next, I can't backtrack
Just got off the phone with my plug, he like 'catch that'
Better than the last batch, touch me that's your last act
Run through 'em like fasttrack
Chokin' on that racepack, chokin' on that jockpack
All I smoke is opp pack
We don't send no bomb threats, you know where my block at, bitch
I hate when niggas try to act hard
Like gettin' a bitch to line 'em up is really that hard
I got famous nigga but I still got heart
Before this rap shit, I was layin' at niggas backyard
