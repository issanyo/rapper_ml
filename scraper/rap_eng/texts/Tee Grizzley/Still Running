[Chorus: Cap 4z]
A thousand blue faces all real hundred

[Verse 1: Cap 4z]
[?] I count it up, you niggas stll runnin'
[?] broke you look like you'll steal somethin'
A 100 blue faces, all real 100's
A 100 more 100's, bitch I'm still thumbin'
I'm from St. Louis bitch, so you know how I drill somethin'
Fucking up the paper, I'ma kill somethin'
Hundred K let that stack until the {?] come
And you ain't gotta worry 'bout no fucking bills, hoe
I got 4 what they call me, I'ma cap a lil' nigga
And they don't know me, then yeah might start clappin' that pistol
Niggas seem like 'what's up, what's been happening nigga'
Shit been running it to fuck up overlapping these niggas
Like damn, homie do it again and again
We was tryna push a whole, I was tryna push a whole gym
[?] 'bout that money, but it's 'bout shit
So if you ain't got no paper we can't talk then, nigga
Cap 4

[Chorus: Cap 4z]
A thousand blue faces all real hundred

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Big money on my mama bitch we got it
Being broke is not a option, I just won't allow it
Chopper have your body steamin' like a pizza pocket
I'm the nigga that was smashin', grabbin', bringin' back the watches
Aye, niggas hating on me, stop
It's St. Louis with the robbers, jewelers ass swiper
Free my Mama Fed's tryna hold my baby hostage
My drink plug made a hundred bands off the Quali
Aye, [?] Grizzley I'm so well rounded
If I want your head ain't no way around it
On parole I can't smoke, still got the loudest
I'm Big Worm duck my calls, I'ma slide and pop
Aye, shot out to my Missouri niggas
Everywhere I go I'm good, I keep 30 with us
Steve ain't gonna touch the Sprite 'less it's dirty in it
Big FN come and clean up you dirty niggas

[Chorus: Cap 4z]
A thousand blue faces all real hundred
6 t0 7 50's that's some real money
I been countin' all day and I'm still thumbin'
Bitch I been ran it up you niggas still running
Still running
Still running
Bitch I been ran it up you niggas still running
Still running
Still running
Bitch I been ran it up you niggas still running
Still running
Still running
Bitch I been ran it up you niggas still running
Still running
Still running
Bitch I been ran it up you niggas still running

[Verse 3: K'Hunnit]
Ran it up a few times like the dopeboys
