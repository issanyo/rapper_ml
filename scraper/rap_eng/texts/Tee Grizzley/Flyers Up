[Intro: Tee Grizzley & Lil Durk]
Durk what up, where you at?
I'm on Normal, gang
What you tryna do?
Throwin' stacks at Magic, today's Monday right?
So we at that bitch come on, 'bout to pull up

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Lil Durk]
Let's go to Magic (let's go to Magic)
Don't forget the ratchets (please don't forget 'em)
I know we in Atlanta (we in Atlanta)
But shit still will get tragic (shit'll get tragic)
You know we some street niggas (know we some street niggas)
Make a livin' off rappin' (living off rapping)
When we throw them flyers up (throw them flyers up)
You know niggas be watchin' and talkin' about slidin'
I know some killers that want me dead
(know some killers that want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)
Know some niggas wit real money, wit that shit on my head (shit on my head)
And they got some killers around 'em (they got some killers around 'em)
And they know how to play it (know how to play it)
But I got some killers don't want me dead
I got some killers don't want me dead
(I got some killers don't want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)
I got some killers don't want me dead
(I got some killers don't want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I hang wit niggas that hang wit the niggas
That hang wit the killas that kill all the killers
I be wit niggas who hang with the niggas
Who hang wit the rappers who take all the skrilla
Go to Chicago and go to Red Diamond
They bookin' Tee Grizzley they know that I'm wit him
Why you keep barkin, they ain't check the artist
We all in the section got 50's on 50's
Real niggas, street niggas
And we gon' link wit the gangs
And we come to yo city (gang gang)
I need VIP bar
Them Dracos gotta be close to us
We don't fuck with no rappers
So I never show, can't let chubbs get close to em
You post want flyers, I'ma hire every killer in the city
Try to go to it
They ain't got no buzz
They don't show no love
I know some cuz, bloods
They cool with us, ya
I know some shorties that's still up in school
You tweakin' cuz they is gone kill for a stack
You poppin' them xanies you better not lack
You play wit the dead, no takin it back

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Lil Durk]
Let's go to Magic (let's go to Magic)
Don't forget the ratchets (please don't forget 'em)
I know we in Atlanta (we in Atlanta)
But shit still will get tragic (shit'll get tragic)
You know we some street niggas (know we some street niggas)
Make a livin' off rappin' (living off rapping)
When we throw them flyers up (throw them flyers up)
You know niggas be watchin' and talkin' about slidin'
I know some killers that want me dead
(know some killers that want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)
Know some niggas wit real money, wit that shit on my head (shit on my head)
And they got some killers around 'em (they got some killers around 'em)
And they know how to play it (know how to play it)
But I got some killers don't want me dead
I got some killers don't want me dead
(I got some killers don't want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)
I got some killers don't want me dead
(I got some killers don't want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
My opps don't die everyday
That's 'cause I ain't beefin' wit rookies
Yo enemies saw you and didn't do nothin'
That's 'cause you be beefin' with pussies
I got some Crips, that's killas
Them niggas will murk you and go pray to Tookie
I got four bloods with 50's
Don't tweak unless you can duck two hundred bullets
Me and Durk go there, they ain't pattin' us down
Get the sticks in and we pass 'em around
I feel at home when I'm out of town
I be 300 like Kevin, no Leonidas
Me and Roc still sendin' out J-Pays
Opps on the gram say he on nay-pay
He say he on live, login from a fake page
They over there, go get that Drac' thang
Free my nigga, Mark Meezy
Used to lay in niggas bushes
Yo mama died, that's yo fault, we was tryna get you, niggas got tired of lookin'
A nigga get the ups on me? I know them niggas gon' cook me
If I beef wit a rapper, I'ma book him
Come to my shows, I'm strapped wit a .40

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Lil Durk]
Let's go to Magic (let's go to Magic)
Don't forget the ratchets (please don't forget 'em)
I know we in Atlanta (we in Atlanta)
But shit still will get tragic (shit'll get tragic)
You know we some street niggas (know we some street niggas)
Make a living off rapping (living off rapping)
When we throw them flyers up (throw them flyers up)
You know niggas be watchin' and talkin' about slidin'
I know some killers that want me dead
(know some killers that want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)
Know some niggas wit real money, wit that shit on my head (shit on my head)
And they got some killers around 'em (they got some killers around 'em)
And they know how to play it (know how to play it)
But I got some killers don't want me dead
I got some killers don't want me dead
(I got some killers don't want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)
I got some killers don't want me dead
(I got some killers don't want me dead)
I know some killers that want me dead
(I know some killers that want me dead)
