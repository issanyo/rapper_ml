[Produced By Cardo]

[Verse 1]
Accustomed to inner states and hustling for dinner plates
That’s why we ordered the menu, won’t savor hater the scrapes
Second’s the first loser, my interest is first place
She fuck on the first date cause she thinking the same way
I feel for a broke nigga, I stood in the same place
But I never stopped chasing paper and started upping the pace
I never did celebrations until I finished the race
I never trusted these bitches since Eve trusted the snake
God is my only witness, I’m plotting my own fate
Niggas want lake houses, I always wanted the cake
Picture me young Midas, putting gold on all my tapes
Got this old [?] from [?], word to Trinidad James
All of these niggas clones and all of these hoes the same
So when I’m fucking your bitches I make em all say my name
Tell em I want a forty if they ask you what I drink
And tell em I got that forty if a nigga want to play

[Hook]

All we know is hustle and grind (live life)
All we know is hustle and grind (live life)

[Verse 2]
A lot of my niggas passed on splurge and then spazzed
Die young and live fast, splash first or that’s your ass
These niggas all hard bodied with bones composed of glass
You keeping your wife home so I don’t give her my last
I fuck her after you cuff her, I’ll pass em, my man smash
I’m stack domestic money, put foreign names on the dash
Usually I roll an L but I’m thinking about burning hash
Don’t ask me about my earnings just know that I’m burning cash

[Hook]
