[Intro: Jaryn Satterfield]

Random humming

[Verse 1: Jaryn Satterfield]

I want you to know
That I know
What you promote to us
As a whole
You tried to get us killed
Load up them choppers
Let's go pay some bills
You tried to get us killed
Aye man come over won't you take this pill

[Hook 1: Jaryn Satterfield]

I just want you to know
That I know
You ain't shit
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit
You ain't shit nigga

[Verse 2: Jaryn Satterfield]

You tried to sell me a dream
So now I'm paying the price
Fixing broken promises
Getting high and sipping on lean
Leading me on a chase to find my inner self
You told me the trap is where the winners dwell
Pure passion
I'm following my dreams to where the sinners sell
Pole dances for dolla bills
You know nap niggas be sleeping
So you plants yo seeds in where you know they will grow
These young niggas is followers
My generation as a whole
Mind ain't on shit but
Bitches money weed
Bitches money weed
Leave a nigga dead in the streets
I know niggas that never made it past 18
I know  (bang)

[Hook 2: Jaryn Satterfield]

I just want you to know
That I know
You ain't shit
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit


[Bridge: Jaryn Satterfield]
You ain't shit nigga
You ain't shit nigga
You ain't shit nigga
You ain't shit nigga
(pause)
You ain't shit nigga

[Hook 3: Jaryn Satterfield]

I just want you to know
That I know
You ain't shit
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit
I just want you to know
You ain't shit
