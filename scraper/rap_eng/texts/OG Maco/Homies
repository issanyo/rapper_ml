[Intro: OG Maco]
Yeah
It's OGG, new money gang, yeah
It's OG Mac, yeah

[Hook: OG Maco]
When you got nothing but your homies
You know it’s nothing, blow a couple thou
When you got nothing but your homies
They can’t say nothing if they wasn’t round
I might just, spend it all, with my homies, yeah
I might just, spend it all, with my homies, yeah

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I’m all in, told 'em and did it right after
Life’s a beast and I’m a master, smoking OG backwoods
Bucking but it’s nothing, build our legend faster
Me and my homies was mugging
Busters bust at you for cheddar
Youngins tryna live better, they wasn’t tryna let us
You don’t want to bet us, we taking all commas
Having hundreds, wanting millions stacked
Who dealing 'cause my hand looks stacked
Poker face and all attack, yeah
Back to the wall, I'ma kill ya
I’m making multiple withdrawals with some extra commas
I’m coming out hunter
Panther in the jungle, wolf in the tundra
Everybody knows you 'til the times bad
Me and the gang survived everything but Baghdad
In Escalades from them taxi cabs
Them escapades brought us plenty cash

[Hook: OG Maco]
When you got nothing but your homies
You know it’s nothing, blow a couple thou
When you got nothing but your homies
They can’t say nothing if they wasn’t round
I might just, spend it all, with my homies, yeah
I might just, spend it all, with my homies, yeah

[Verse 2: Johnny Cinco]
Them niggas fake when they see me but really don't know me
I fuck with OG my brother, but I don’t fuck with Homie
I’m in that Phantom all black, man I feel like the old me
I’m in that Phantom all black, man I know that they after me
In the Phantom with the K on me, know that it stay on me
We could spray up the street, we could fuck up the week
Lord bless 'em if they ever catch 'em
Hundred rounds sprayin' out the Tesla
Lord bless 'em, nigga more or less
Lord knows I was selling extras
Selling extras got me living better
Living better, fucking up the cheddar
New chinchillas, February weather
OG Papi, it was enough said
OG Papi only ride with Diddy
On the island counting up the winters
Made a million off of adlibbing
What’s a million when it ain't your niggas?

[Hook: OG Maco]
When you got nothing but your homies
You know it’s nothing, blow a couple thou
When you got nothing but your homies
They can’t say nothing if they wasn’t round
I might just, spend it all, with my homies, yeah
I might just, spend it all, with my homies, yeah
