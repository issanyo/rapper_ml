[Hook]
On a night like this
Who knows what we sipping on
On a night like this
Room full of clouds, we've been chiefing strong
On a night like this, we hope it never ends ‘less we get to some’
On a night like this, on a night like this

[Verse 1]
We the type to get it lit
Fire in our lungs, what you smokin' on?
Have you ever faced a zip
Rolling in a joint, house moving gift
Ask Corbin if you think I’m playin'
Kush club captain, bitch the fuck you sayin'
These niggas ain't sayin' nothin' like they bank statements
You don't love this money you just love complaining
The blue one or the brown one, I'm just contemplating
Complacent, never been it, had to build a steady
Now we laughin' in they face, haha
In a Challenger to dodge a case, Au revoir
We just screamin' out live life

[Hook]
On a night like this
Who knows what we sipping on
On a night like this
Room full of clouds, we've been chiefing strong
On a night like this, we hope it never ends ‘less we get to some’
On a night like this, on a night like this

[Verse 2]
We the type to get lit
Take a dab, sip your cup, face a three fifth
Huh, you ever fucked a whole clique?
One was tryna hit, then they all came
Ass kinda thin, you with the slim waist
Rose sipping, kiss me, go to waste
Pretty [?] on the face
Nothing on me but this [?]
Get’s it done, now we party mama
Just for fun, let me spend it on us
Niggas over there some hummers
I'ma make us [?] my piranha
Flashing lights, fuck the drama
We just came for the moment
In the club and we been on it
Burning loud, don’t got karma
Bitches smell us, want to come in
And they wonder why they on us
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Hook]
On a night like this
Who knows what we sipping on
On a night like this
Room full of clouds, we've been chiefing strong
On a night like this, we hope it never ends ‘less we get to some’
On a night like this, on a night like this
