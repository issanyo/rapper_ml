[Hook]
I plead the fifth on these niggas
No further questions, it’s take down my answer and say that I said that we winning
I got a question for niggas
Mapped out this shit in December, was working for dinner, but do you remember?
Ain’t too much talking or listen
You was just there for the bottles and bitches and tagging us all in some pictures
So I got a question for niggas
Stepping on couches and benches for listens and all of my niggas remember

[Verse 1]
Hundred pack, gas light on
Gotta get the work back home
I’ma test the life by the mile
I’m disgusted by the price of a smile
Wake up and you couldn’t stand for it
Making movies, youngin giving orders
Shit ain’t scripted, it just get recorded
Life an epic raid on the low
Take some miss and rarely getting sorted
Naked pictures, bitches wearing floral
Mouth wide, gator [?] ho
Seen the throat, say it ain’t so
What’s the quota, quote me on the numbers
What’s the quotient, [?] with my brothers
Long nights, [?] on floors
The long nights shooting for a cover
Must’ve got the timelines wrong
Never miss, we’re with them other niggas
Taking vacations in one timezone
Flew through 5 in one flight home
Bigger stages, painting bigger pictures
Fucked your lady, feeling [?]
Peeling scabs and aggravating healing
They don’t see it eating on your soul
Must’ve got the timelines wrong
It’s my time ‘til my heartline gone
Beep beep, Yee KG
‘Bout to talk to 30 on them though
What they said ‘bout worrying, sticks and stones
What they say, I prolly won’t hear
Money counter loud like it’s Bose
In the [?] with a tree by the door
