[Hook: OG Maco]
I've been living on a suitcase
I've been waking to a new face
I've been living on a suitcase
(You tell me how to smile, but where we going?)

[Verse: Rome Fortune]
Look, I said
Look, I said
Paddling backwardly actually
On a pressure of level I got magazines, actresses over me
I could hurt you a level, nigga
Eagle flow, so high
Shoot you out your sky
A bullet like (?), why the fuck you had to lie?
If you wanted to be single, you could've said it
I'm on the road, seeing hoes, counting fetti
We could've been cool, real shit and say we ain't ready
But here we go with these hoes, causing mess
Bitch clean the mess
Don't want to stress
I found a movement
Gone fly to west
Gone see the pictures
Gone see the sex
Gone see the dough
Won't be reflex
I say
