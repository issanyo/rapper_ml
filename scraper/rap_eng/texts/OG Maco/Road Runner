[I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
And my niggas get that money, mansion flexing, opera stunting
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
And my niggas get that money, mansion flexing, opera stunting

[Verse 1 – OG Maco]
When I wake up in the morning I see zeros on my line
When I hop on asphalt I can’t never waste my time
75 to 85, yeah I’m known to take them trips
Turn a dollar to two fifty, yeah I’m known to make them flips
Turned two fifty to ten racks, it only took a couple trips
Wear my sponsors in my patches, I’m like NASCAR driving laps
If you ask me where I’m at, I say nigga ask the map
If you need it I’ll catch you but I got to take that cap

[Hook][x2]
[I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
And my niggas get that money, mansion flexing, opera stunting
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
And my niggas get that money, mansion flexing, opera stunting

[Verse 2 – OG Junior]
I been road running so my tires gone
I been smoking gas, I got one lung
Travel land sea or air money triathlon
Your money jog in place so you can’t see my face
My section filled with bitches and they bad but not sadity
If I find out that they zero then I got to take em with me
Had to hit my homie Tony, he just cash a nigga out
Junior said he had a whoop so now I’m mashing to the south
We don’t talk nothing but money like it’s Franklins in our mouth
Hear you try to take my sack, put that five seven on your scalp
Live life, that’s my family, OGG the fucking gang
Swear I spend so much on gas, should’ve bought a fucking range

And my niggas get that money, mansion flexing, opera stunting
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
