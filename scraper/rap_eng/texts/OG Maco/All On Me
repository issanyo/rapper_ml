[Verse 1: OG Brylan Kerr]
Random tears, this shit so real, right
That shit got real, like look
I’m cooling, I’m kicking back, you know how I react
I’m shooting, say we some style, say word
I want it all, foreign cars, Audemars
We popping bottles on the mall
I throwed off a space, thought I’d land on Mars
Neighbors with them Jetsons, see I’m so high can’t fly in your direction
I’m tweaking for a second, she suck me up for hours
Them hoes be all on my line, knowing all of my lines
Doing all of these lines, THC and 8ball, say word, I’m just tryna live
I’m just tryna live, all we know is ball
Rest in peace to kin, money stacking tall
Get above the rim, naw I don’t hoop no more
Still balling on you fools, OGG, OG Mac like sheesh, woo!

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
Who woulda thought it’d be all on me, Mac Curry from the three huh
Black mask like LeBron with a broke nose
Shit I had one too, had three holes
What I did in there, shit only god knows
Did dirt with some vados, and some real niggas
Keep it trill so when I go, knock knock when I burst through the foyer
Unfortunate ass nigga in balls deep, I know they only angry bout foreplay
Cause money just a means to initiate it
And the judge seem to lean like the damn scale
We just ask em what’s the bill like the house waitress
Never get weed past the house Satan
Faded on my line like a car way
Waving at a fan and she half naked
Damn bro last year they was playing favorites
We was playing chess shit, wasn’t tryna let us breathe
Now we at their necks, that was on a tweet deck come from Fader
God bless, and this runway fleet with an OGG crest
Fuck the cops, tear the city up less, gave them sheesh, what’s next
Nothing much to em, bust, show bucks different shit, same fest

[Outro: OG Maco]
Couple movies and Jacuzzis in between
Fuck the other side
Fuck the other side
Riding from my team
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, yeah yeah
Now they want more, now they want more
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, yeah yeah
OGG, now you want more, OGG
Now you want more, now they want more
