[Intro: OG Maco]
Hey sheesh, hey OGG, QC, hey, OG Mac

[Pre-Hook: OG Maco]
Maco what you doing
Swear that's all they've been asking
Phone blowing up
(?) manage
All over the world
I'm getting DMs spanish
No tengo dinero
Hopped on a plane
Killing shit I've landed

[Hook: OG Maco]
Damn right I've been living life, living life, living life x2
Maco what you doing
Swear that's all they've been asking
Phone blowing up
(?) manage
Damn right I've been living life, living life, living life x2
All over the world
I'm getting DMs spanish
No tengo dinero
Hopped on a plane
Killing shit I've landed

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Damn right I've been living life
What I'm doing, nothing much
Just with such and such and with what's her name
Hash it out without Johnny Dang
I'm just spitting dome, brought it to you from the slums
Hold your breathe, get to my lungs
Every song, every single summer
Murder (?), triple digit percentage
Who wants some, pity the fool
All them siblings my niggas, you good good good
I ain't wanna have to do it to 'em
Living lessons let me prove it to ya
Bunch of youngins' movements
They've been going hard since they've been toothing
We ain't going for none of that bullshit
Og mac only do shit
Watch how fast it happen
One minute, one minute
Self made, now I go Ross'd in it leaving
Jaws hanging, mouths clenching in the kitchen
(?), when these hoes call me chef man
(?) come and talk later
We don't sell molly no more
I don't sell dope but I'm spitting that
Perfect vision like a quarterback

[Outro: OG Maco]
Damn right I've been living life x4
Damn right x2
I've been living life x2
Yeah Yeah x3
Fuckemx3, Yeah Yeah
I've been living life
Maco what you doing
I swear that's all they keep asking
Yeah Yeah x3
All over the world
I'm getting DMs spanish
No tengo dinero
Hopped on a plane
Killing shit I've landed
Damn right I've been living life x2
