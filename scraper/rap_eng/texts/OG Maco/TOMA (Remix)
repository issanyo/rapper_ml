[Pre-Hook: Buggy]
Uno dos tres
Cuatro cinco seis
The plug just hit me with 10 bricks
And it's on the way
Got to thank Jesus
Man I cannot lose
He flying off from Mexico
You know what I'ma do

[Hook: Buggy & OG Maco]
He hit me with the bricks like TOMA  (Hooh!)
He hit me with the bricks like TOMA  (Toma!)
He hit me with the bricks like TOMA  (Yeah, yeah!)
He hit me with the bricks like TOMA  (Shsh!)
He hit me with the bricks like TOMA  (God damn!)
He hit me with the bricks like TOMA  (Toma!)
He hit me with the bricks like TOMA  (Yeah, yeah!)
He hit me with the bricks like TOMA

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I ride the Masi today
I ride the Bentley tomorrow
I’ma fuck her, she a model
She’ll bust it for a follow
Pull on your block with a 2-2-3
Leave your brains in the street
My niggas starving, let ‘em eat
Turn your food, have a feast
Still riding ‘round with a chopper
Hit you in the head when I pop up
Leave a hole in your head, call the doctor
Got shooters on shooters, who shot ya?
Pull up in the jet with a real check
I got rich, I’ma flex
Broke nigga you a mess
I bought a Rollie, diamonds wet
I can tell you a ho
I don’t talk on Instagram, I got too many O’s
These old rappers tryna steal my old flow
Sipping the lean and I pour a four
Hit me with the bricks like TOMA
In the kitchen, you can smell the aroma
Put a hole in your head like a donut
I been walkin’ ‘round flexing ‘cause I’m froze up
Uno, dos, hit a jugg with the plug on the boat
I’m the plug in a hood with the coat
Y’all niggas ain’t seen no blow
Yeah, for real though
My niggas walk ‘round with the AK, in the field though

[Verse 2: Buggy]
Plug don't speak no english
He don't really like speaking to gringes
Man I'll show you all the packs off eBay
All I do is just trap and play 2K
'Cause a young nigga trapping off the phone
I hit her once and the bitch keep calling
I ain't picking up if you ain't got no guap
Trying to love the internet and the bad blocks
Stop fronting man your pictures don't be here
Stop fronting man you don't serve chickens
All night we be trapping out the motel
New plug say he got it all wholesale
Pull up like oh my god
Then pull off like oh my god
PayPal how we trapping online
When I swipe I don't ever decline
Throw the package up, you ain't gotta sign
Fall in love boy, I don't got time
If you looking for a love go find it
VVS's all my motherfucking diamonds
Bricks in the stash house, that's the white house
Got a young nigga feeling like Obama
When I swipe I don't ever decline
Throw the package up, you ain't gotta sign
Fall in love boy, I don't got time
If you looking for a love go find it
VVS's all my motherfucking diamonds
Bricks in the stash house, that's the white house
Got a young nigga feeling like Obama

[Verse 3: Ice Baby]
She said she wanna give me the chocha
All I really wanted was the coca
I gave her the D now she falling asleep
Now I got her ass in a comma
Nigga got beef better hold up
I got that thing make you blow up
I got that thing make you back track
You don't want none' you better back back
I got them bricks in a backpack
No fake shit, nigga real rap
All you niggas fake and you riff raff
I'm talking 'bout bricks, you ain't got that
Forty for the bricks I get them
In your girl's pussy yellin' touchdown
Diamonds straight dancing like Chris Brown
If a nigga want diss he gon' get rounds

[Verse 4: Blade Brown]
Ay, ay, he hit me with the bricks like TOMA
I left all the fiends in a coma
With whipping I got a diploma
I was loving the paper but hate the aroma
I whip ‘em, I whip on my own, I’m a loner
Wait, they think we don’t whip it in Britain?
There ain’t enough time in this rhythm for me to break down all the bricks that we’re splitting
The pyrex is dripping
I season the chicken, I cook it so different
In the foreign I’m sitting
Just driving, collecting the papers the mission
Said they fuck with me cause I’m a street nigga
But don’t fuck with me cause I’m a street nigga
Thinking London is sweet nigga
Niggas knock you off of your feet nigga
BXB, this is G4
Talk racks and I speak raw
See feds on that high road
Man I have to take a quick detour
This is trap life, yeah we’re in and out
My niggas live this, you can’t make it up
Grab a brick then we break it up
Consign then we chase it up
(Yeah we consign then we chase it up)
Give ‘em one taste, I bet it wake ‘em up
(Give ‘em one taste, I bet it wake ‘em up)
I cop a Valentino then I lace it up
