[Hook]
If you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us
So if you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us, yeah

[Verse 1]
Dear father, thank you for my father and the fact he's still around and still the father
I mean some dudes don't even bother seeing son or daughter
And if they seen 'em, seen 'em as a problem
Not mine, the crunch time, he just crunching numbers
Really problem solver, life ain't never [?]
Hopin' only workin' if you workin good'
It's over if you went and bought it
Real words, they the reason why I got champagne and finger burns

[Hook]
If you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us
So if you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us, yeah

[Verse 2]
I was tryna break the bank and still bankin' on what I learned
To the urn we forever syner-gerious
Even if we have these salty crackers killin' us
Forget Phil, we gon' make sure they remember us
Remember titans got caged, happened to the greatest
Just be patient, if we pace it we can run the world
We can build a safe haven for our little girls
Before they turn into the women with the vicious curves
And if you hit 'em when you ballin' they scream Ray Rice
Shit if that's some spouse killers, most of 'em white
Cold world, sippin' lean, double cup with ice
Heart missing, check my left chest and the right
I checked the check before I checked the mic
They check my set before they check the hype
Wheels turning in my mind before I had a bike
Now meals might cost me a thousand and that's pretty light
Damn

[Hook]
If you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us
So if you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us, yeah
