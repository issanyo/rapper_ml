[Hook]
We want all the money, we all been hungry
But it’s all been coming
We want all the money, we all been hungry
But it’s all been coming

[Verse 1]
[?] rider otherwise it’s do or die
My homie caught that homicide in 305 on i75, no testify
Big testicles, don’t test me ho
Promises only come and go
Opps is popping, loss is coming
Hundreds humming, flicking through em
OGG this gangster movement
Original is gangster though
Developed all these schemes and plots that brought my team up off the block
Thinking about a [?] truck
Smoking green, chrysanthemum
We just wanted extra racks to throw at hoes who dance for us
We just wanted extra racks for cops to lie on stand for us
Far from nothing, built from fam
Lights ain’t all, we counting grams
Hustle seen by any means
It’s in my genes, my RNA, my DNA, we can’t decay
Zombie drink like lemonade

[Hook]
We want all the money, we all been hungry
But it’s all been coming
We want all the money, we all been hungry
But it’s all been coming
We want all the money, we all been hungry
But it’s all been coming
We want all the money, we all been hungry
But it’s all been coming
