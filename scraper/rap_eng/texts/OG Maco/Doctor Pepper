[Chorus: CL]
Put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper
Feelin' so clean, it don't get no fresher
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure
I put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper (Ooh)
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure
I put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper

[Verse 1: CL]
Can't handle this volume, can't handle this
Can't handle this song but you gon' bounce to this shit (Ooh)
Bounce to this shit, bounce to this shit
Put yo' Thizz Face on, let me see you bounce to this shit
Phone callin', I'm pressin' red
Only red cup, that's in my hand
I ain't got the time, so why you askin'?
I got a flight to catch, I'm always travelin'
They packin'...

[Chorus: CL & RiFF RAFF]
Put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper
Feelin' so clean, it don't get no fresher
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure
I put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure (RiFF)
I put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper (Uh, yuh)

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Drivin' backwards through Rome in a Range Rover (Rainbow)
You skatin' on thin ice, Anna Kournikova (Kournikova)
Rap game, Tony Danza with the hot handles (Hot handles)
No tint on the glasses—glasses—, Colonel Sanders (Sanders)
I can Las Vegas valet at the Wynn (Valet)
The Burly Boys in the candy blueberry Benz (Blue)
I done rock more ice than Michelle Kwan (Michelle Kwan)
Hah, shit, look who it is, the white Barry Bonds (Barry)
A heavyweight—weight—, you a featherweight (A featherweight)
I can meditate, make my trunk levitate (Levitate)
I used to go campin' in that emerald flannel (Flannel)
Ghost stories o'er Versace candles (Versace, RiFF, uh)

[Chorus: CL & OG Maco]
Put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper (Yah, yah)
Feelin' so clean, it don't get no fresher (Yah)
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure (Ooh, ooh)
I put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper (Yah, yah)
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper (Burr, burr)
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure
I put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper (Ooh)

[Verse 3: OG Maco]
Put it on ice like the musicals
Shootin' for the top, no Call of Duty though
Ya out in the weather sippin', sippin' on her like a Dr. Pepper (Yeah)
I ain't thinkin' with my pecker (Yuh)
But when I am in advantage, she know 'Mac a spender (Uh)
So outlandish when they catchin' candies (Damn)
Women gettin' friendly, treasure landin' pimpin' (Skrrr, ooh)
And the windows tinted and this shit is bangin'
Leave this bitch there, god damn (Uh)
Chick with me and she far from dizzy (Yeah)
But she kinda dizzy—yeah—from these round trips
And she talkin' money, you don't hear a quip
Every last nigga (Burr, ma-, ma-)
Makin' anthems with a lady
Goin' on tangents, makin' paper
Haters that play it, just bring green
Well, two million and a half, Charlie Sheen
Wrist glisten and the neck glean
So supreme like Sean Stussy (Ooh)
Grip the pistol, it's easy choosin'
So I'm in any battle, ain't no better than losing, yuh

[Chorus: CL]
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure
I put it on ice, bitch, Dr. Pepper
