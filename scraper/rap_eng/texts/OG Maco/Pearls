[Hook: OG Maco]
Ya'll ain't pearls
I been watching
Peeping your lacking, wasting
Plus you got this attitude like
It's something phenomenal hidden
Abdominal choice, dumb decisions
A bum in a Porsche is not pimping
So you can borrow my voice or my image

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Told them good riddance my brains don't need Hendrix
They want Hollywood admittance, I'm Dillinger chasing pendants
In another league, and leading it by a distance
I been playing genie, I granted a hundred wishes
But you can wash your hands of the past and pay penance
So you be washing dishes and back counting the pennies
Last seen at Denny's he living life through the Henny

[Hook: OG Maco]
Ya'll ain't pearls
I been watching
Peeping your lacking, wasting
Plus you got this attitude like
It's something phenomenal hidden
Abdominal choice, dumb decisions
A bum in a Porsche is not pimping
So you can borrow my voice or my image

[Verse 2: Rome Fortune]
Ok the spotlight on you
Like a cop light on you
And the hoes that you want to hit and like right on you
It's like a high right on you
Stuffy getting while your ass is in business
Losing drive and your check and your bitch is next
Sucker, listen indefinitely, huh
What makes you so entitled, my talents infinity, huh
But I'm working like I'm in high school
And the honor roll is my thing, yes
My honor my everything, yes
Designer ain't everything, eh
Yeah mine a heavy thing, I said

[Hook: OG Maco]
Ya'll ain't pearls
I been watching
Peeping your lacking, wasting
Plus you got this attitude like
It's something phenomenal hidden
Abdominal choice, dumb decisions
A bum in a Porsche is not pimping
So you can borrow my voice or my image
