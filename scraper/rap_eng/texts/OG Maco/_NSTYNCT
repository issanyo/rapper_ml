[Mixtape Intro: DJ Drama]
You know everything is in black and white
Like me for example, black dad, white mom
You know, when TV first started it was in black and white
See the thing about me and Cannon
We love to do things first
So the first band to put out a mixtape
It would come from us
Y'all ready? (dramatic)
Welcome to The Neighbourhood (Cannon)
(Trendsetter)
(The Cannon)
I tried to warn you, everything is black and white

[Intro: Skeme]
Yeah
I can't be ridin' with a sucker, nigga, nah uh-uh, no sir, can't do it (no sir)
Can't see yourself going broke no time soon, no sir, can't view it (no sir)
My niggas in the game, all you niggas on the sidelines
Lookin' mad as hell, bitch, Jon Gruden (god-damn)
I take my Nikes off and put them Saint Laurent's on my feet
Still wanna come to rap? Then just do it

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Young nigga, what your life like?
All my niggas ballin' round here
Reppin' players like a highlight
And all my bitches out here lookin' like fine wine
All your bitches out here lookin' like fright night, yikes
20 thousand dollars on a Rollie, no Ice
Know you can't afford it if you ask 'bout the price
See I been gettin' played like all my damn life
If it ain't about no money, you just don't live right, agh!

[Interlude: Jesse Rutherford]
Change all the time, can change all the time
If I really want to I could change all your minds
I change in the day, I change in the night
I paint it all black and I paint it all white
Change all the time, can change all the time
If I really want to I could change all your minds
I change in the day, I change in the night
I paint it all black and I paint it all white

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
Margiela to offset her
My money under this jacket
Versace boots for my stature
Can't dap me, I'm too dapper, damn
I mean I'm fleeker than the scammers on the damn ground
Vintage, trans, strange, X-Men: Last Stand
And your last man shoppin' out my trash can
Recycle bin has been, damn, how ya life been?
Tell us how the lights been
Tell us how your night ends
Shit, I don't fuck the groupie hoes or they hype friends
Benjamins take 'em in, call it a night's end
Smilin' the whole damn time thinkin' "nice win"
I remember nights when ends was the end, friends was absent
Fueled by nothing but passion, now
It's packs of hundreds, these niggas they done done it
You guessed just how they did it
They dumb it just so they near it
They payin' 'cause we amazing
Put a penis in the Caymans
Now you don't know if I'm playing, that's a win right there
You tryna celebrate, oh, that's some head right there
I'm tryna medicate, just put the gas in the air
And we don't give a fuck, throwin' money everywhere
Welcome the lader's blessing as we add on the X's damn

[Verse 3: Jesse Rutherford]
I met a stranger yesterday
She said it would all just go away (all go)
And when she put her hands on me
I met a stranger yesterday
She said it would all just go away
And when she put her hands on me
It was gone, it was gone
It was gone and gone and gone, gone and gone and gone
You're never comin' back
Once you go away, you're never comin' back
Once you go away, you're never comin' back
'Ted it, stranger wanted it

[Outro: Jesse Rutherford]
(Change all the time, can change all the time
If I really want to I could change all your minds)
Oh god, I can't believe I made this shit
(I change in the day, I change in the night
I paint it all black and I paint it all white)
This is for friends and family
(Change all the time, can change all the time
If I really want to I could change all your minds)
This is for those who stand right by your side
(I change in the day, I change in the night
I paint it all black and I paint it all white)
Friends and family
This is for ones I won't forget
