[Verse 1: John Ibe]
This is the moment I dreamed about
Mama would wake up and tell me to clean the house
Now it’s dinner table reservations
Laughing at how they thought we wouldn’t make it
Man it was destined and only a matter of time
I never hated, I waited in line for the rappers ahead of me
Pushing carts at Kroger, sun on my shoulder
Had to find a way to make it
They way that I wanted and couldn’t let nobody stop it
Man it’s like a picture and these haters cropping
Niggas wanna talk, I’m not in if it’s not about profit
Man I got men who would work in the office
And count up the bucks like it’s part of an audit
I’m about business and money, it’s no time for haters ‘cause all of ‘em love me
I been thinkin’ ‘bout it, I been quarterbackin’
I been adding numbers, I been adding fractions
Dreaming panoramic
Yeah, what is attachment?
I know that I’m taking a risk for this life that we live
All for the riches but daddy would tell me to focus in school and get a degree
Get a J-O-B but that ain’t me, I’m on a mission nigga

[Hook: John Ibe]
My clock goin’ counterwise, ‘cause I put in overtime
I know I’ma shine
My clock goin’ counterwise, ‘cause I put in overtime
I know I’ma shine
24 7, all I do is grind
Knew that I would make it, only doubt is time
See the way we living in the grape vines
You gon’ wanna follow god and get behind

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
[?] twisting in my trigger finger, I can’t wait to hit you like a linebacker
Attention bitch, I’m ‘bout to bless you
We don’t pray for bitches and everything up there’s a dirty chopper
Rifle loaded, missiles stolen nigga
Layin’ [?], demons pissin’, dragon spitting
Dragon, she gon’ pop it Maco, I just handle business
Spraying bitches and lil visits, ‘bout the digits
Leave me [?], I’m as small as temples
We vacate, I shoot your condos in December
Bought some trees, Sonny Trees prolly took a trip
I’m probably mental, Fuji focus, get the picture
Yeah yeah, I ain’t even gotta clean the dental
I ain’t even gotta chew my food
I ain’t even have to see these niggas
I ain’t never have to care ‘bout rules
[?] the option, change his status
Mhm, mhm, yeah yeah
Diamonds dancing in the light
Mhm, mhm, yeah yeah
Lately can’t get at the ice
On my own two legs, a nigga bangin’

[Hook: John Ibe]
My clock goin’ counterwise, ‘cause I put in overtime
I know I’ma shine
My clock goin’ counterwise, ‘cause I put in overtime
I know I’ma shine
24 7, all I do is grind
Knew that I would make it, only doubt is time
See the way we living in the grape vines
You gon’ wanna follow god and get behind

[Verse 3: Danny Seth]
Pause, let me take me a breather
Man they’re forgetting about me like I’m amnesia
I’ma keep moving, my brother, kinda like a seizure
I've got bars for war, man I bring the ether
Ever talk about the Jay-Z Nas beefer
You wanna take a break, well take a break
And I'll just fly to Ibiza
Find a nice white girl called Edwina
And then I sniff her white keys, Alicia
Got my ex to think that I need her
But I just give her dick then I leave her
And that’s real life stories
I don’t play Ballamory
And when you hit it rich, come back, get the fuckin’ birds
Get some words [?]

[Verse 4: Jace]
Tryna slide in a Lexus, like Alexander Ovechkin
Pulled up to the next light flexing
Remember when I didn’t have a rental
Now I’m at the montage
Thinkin’ ‘bout getting me a residence
Lookin’ like the east side’s president
While I’m only countin’ up the deficit
Nigga, how you gon’ talk shit?
Went from lukewarm piss up to hot shit
Must be contemplating ‘cause you not shit
From the six dog, know I like to pop shit
I hop out, I roll up, I walk in
I ain’t with none of the talking
They just actors like Christopher Walken
True romance, money make the bitch pole dance
Told her when she wanna suck my dick
Better use both hands
Said the same windows
Get with the program
Cause can’t nobody ride like this, or vibe like this
Let me slide right quick

[Hook: John Ibe]
My clock goin’ counterwise, ‘cause I put in overtime
I know I’ma shine
My clock goin’ counterwise, ‘cause I put in overtime
I know I’ma shine
24 7, all I do is grind
Knew that I would make it, only doubt is time
See the way we living in the grape vines
You gon’ wanna follow god and get behind

[Verse 5]
Throwing money when I’m making money
They’re at your feet tryna take it though
Forty four with the long barrel
Think fast, run and die slow
Dream about it when they eyes closed
Trapping, flexing all night though
Drama with us then we air it out
Turn the block into a lights show
Fishtailing on the E-way
Forty kick like east bay
I got niggas that ain’t make it out
Tell his mama he ain’t make it out
Whippin’, pitching ‘til I’m juiced up
Niggas beating, wanna choose something
I just tell ‘em they should be theyself
Mad as hell they can see themselves
Piece right on the corner with me
Biggie ice just a don to me
Treat the hustle like a marathon
Who’s putting in the work with me?
S praying in the church for me
Never should’ve made it out of here
Long barrel for a sure shot
Money made them problem disappear

[Verse 6]
Niggas be talkin’ just like all these bitches
I stay in my business, all eyes on them digits
Fuck texting a ho, don’t switch on my bro
But [?} be a foe ‘fore niggas be fam
They fuck you over for money and fame
I choose to be player, can’t trip on the game
If everybody ain’t real I can’t trip on a lame
If a nigga try use he testing the range
He touch the concrete
Have the nigga like a fish
Get the nigga wet from his head to his feet
Dumb nigga choosing us over cheese
I don’t understand, but that ain’t my problem
A nigga can’t be satisfied at the bottom
I focus on grinding, come up, get some commas
Real [?] my soldier, so sad that you fallen
We still makin’ moves, tryna get paid
Hater talking, give a fuck what you say
Pillow talking but won’t come in my face
You think this a game, bitch this ain’t arcade
Gotta be a boss, can’t live like a slave
Sleeping under stairs, remember them days
Sleeping in traps, I remember them Ks
Lose a ho, look into the sky, cry
Now I’m still on the [?]

[Hook: John Ibe]
My clock goin’ counterwise, ‘cause I put in overtime
I know I’ma shine
My clock goin’ counterwise, ‘cause I put in overtime
I know I’ma shine
24 7, all I do is grind
Knew that I would make it, only doubt is time
See the way we living in the grape vines
You gon’ wanna follow god and get behind

[Verse 7: Left Brain]
My clock going counterwise, I know that I’m high
I open my eyes, I’m off of the silicide
Pool full of liquor, you know I’ma dive
Now I’m thirty feet deep
I’m swimming around, and I’m looking for freaks
Now I hop out the pool, and I run through the streets
With the dirtiest cliques
Quarterback, throw the ball
Oh hit, run it, run it
We already know what team I’m on
In the kitchen, mind on a nigga’s stomach
Mixing up the recipe, it make you vomit
And we higher than the stars, they call us comets
Niggas worried ‘bout they fuckin’ IG comments
While we fuckin’ fuck it, fuckin’ up the commas
Yeah, my niggas is hungry
They starving like Marvin
Damn, and you niggas is talking
I’m beggin’ your pardon
You better keep walking
Better take caution
Til thou has paid the honorable pardon
