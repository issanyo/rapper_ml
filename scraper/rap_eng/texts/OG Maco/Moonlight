[Chorus]:
We been waiting on the midnight
We just living in the moonlight
We won't stop until the daylight
We'll be raging til the drugs die
X2

We been moving under streetlights
We won't buy unless the fee right
Pop some bottles just to feel right
Hear some Maco and they get hype
With my niggas and they know who

They want gasoline and good dope
This ain't the one for the good girls
This where we turn them to monsters
All these flashing lights move so high
We're so fucked up that we can't drive
Eyes red and our pupils wide
It's so late it must be daytime
When the sun go down it's playtime
Are you ready for the long ride
Don't you tap out we don't know how
We the raging we the night owls

[Chorus x2]

We be mixing drugs for new highs
Where we'll find a freak that's inside
I got molly pills and everything
When you fucked up we the ones to blame
We just living in the black lights
Drugs wash over this lit time

I don't know if I just want to die
But I know I got to live life
When the sun go down it's play time
Are you ready for the long ride?
Don't you tap out we don't know how
We the raging we the night owls

[Chorus x2]
