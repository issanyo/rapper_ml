[Hook]
And all I want is all the world
For my niggas in my city
And all I want is all the world
For my niggas in my city
We are the champions, my friends, we are, we are
We are the champions, my friends, we are, we are

[Verse 1]
It starts in one night
The fight starts to rise
We're seeking no end
We're seeking demise
Of monsters out there
We're telling no lie
There's no fair life for second place
No request for rights

[Hook]
And all I want is all the world
For my niggas in my city
And all I want is all the world
For my niggas in my city
We are the champions, my friends, we are, we are
We are the champions, my friends, we are, we are

[Verse 2]
It starts with one life
These victory fights
We're linking inside
We're feeling stars
Make it through the line
We're reaching new heights
And you come just to see it burn
So much for the high

[Hook]
And all I want is all the world
For my niggas in my city
And all I want is all the world
For my niggas in my city
We are the champions, my friends, we are, we are
We are the champions, my friends, we are, we are
