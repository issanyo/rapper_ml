[Hook]
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga

[Verse 1]
Niggas act like they can't hear it
They can't see it, fake Helen Keller
I'm here now, it's fear now
Who the fuck is my peers now?
Know it ain't these young niggas
Just mumblin', ain't sayin' much
Before all this, nigga, gat gon' bust
That no rush, that brand new
Lookin' back on what I came from
It's no surprise what I've come to
I'm Russian Roulette with gangsta choppas
Recollect when I am a father
I'm Anakin, no skywalkers
Fucked the came when I came in it
Used to ride to shoot clubs up
Now "Riot" has my name mentioned
Chains on me, I slave different

[Hook]
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga

[Verse 2]
Where the hell is this promised land?
Atlantastan ain't it, nigga
It's Js here, it's rocks here
And I ain't talkin' 'bout hoes neither
One nation under rob
With less patience we wait for God
Breakin' laws, tryna even odds
Breakin' hearts, tryna get in drawers
Pulled apart for our natural flaws
Light skinned vs dark skinned
White man vs black man
Want the sin on all us
Just 99 percent bullshit
It's hard times in this end game
The end is night, but I can't complain
Burn it down with these super flames
Mistrials and lies make our truth wane
Despite our pride, let's beat the shame
Birthrights we need to claim
I worked for chains, come and fuck the fame
Cause I am legend

[Hook]
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga
