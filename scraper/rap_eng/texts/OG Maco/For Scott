[Verse 1: OG Maco]
And the good man cries
And the good man tries
And the shit man does
And it's all for us
And it's all for us
Start a new beginning
Cudi took my soul
And bleed on?
How long is forever
How long is forever
How long is forever
And the good man cries
(And the good man dies)
And the good man tries
(And the good man tries)
And the shit man does
And it's all for us
And it's all for us
Cudi took my soul
And bleed on?
How long is forever
How long is forever
How long is forever
(How long is forever)
