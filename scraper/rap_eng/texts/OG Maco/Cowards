[Hook]
Somethin' on my mind
Elephant in the room
Us youngins runnin' shit
Big homies in their youth
And the courage turn to power
No country for the cowards
And the courage turn to power
No country for the cowards
Somethin' on my mind
Elephant in the room
Us youngins runnin' shit
Big homies in their youth
And the courage turn to power
No country for the cowards
And the courage turn to power
No country for the cowards

[Verse]
I've been thinkin', I've been brainstormin'
She been suckin' on me, gave me better thoughts
I'm makin' records, thinkin' of a lot
I took a second, said it, boy you awesome
Got your girl wetter than a cr√®me adoucissante
Play the part, so major, no percussions
Never doubt so hard [?]
Hard flippin' got my blood boiled
The time is now, what you waitin' for?
Finesser vision through the Hermes lenses
A living legend at a younger age
All these bonds, help me break the cage
I'm just sorry I'm the lord of rage
We the rulers, check the DNA
Fly enough to need the TNA
Hi-def to need control room
[?]
South side, I'm just so jurassic
My mouth wide and I'm 'bout to blast it
I can't decide if I need it all
We've been good since the white drawers
Tell them pussy niggas pipe down
Tell them youngins that we run the town

[Hook]
Somethin' on my mind
Elephant in the room
Us youngins runnin' shit
Big homies in their youth
And the courage turn to power
No country for the cowards
And the courage turn to power
No country for the cowards
Somethin' on my mind
Elephant in the room
Us youngins runnin' shit
Big homies in their youth
And the courage turn to power
No country for the cowards
And the courage turn to power
No country for the cowards
