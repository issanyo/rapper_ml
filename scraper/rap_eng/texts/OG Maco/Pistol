[Hook]
She got my pistol in her throat
And I know everything she wants
She said it feels like dope when it’s her
She said it feels like dope when it’s her

[Hook]
She got my pistol in her throat
And I know everything she wants
She said it feels like dope when it’s her
She said it feels like dope when it’s her

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I got my pistol in her throat
It’s like dope when I enter
The prehistoric clitoris while I go in play the chorus
I mean if I had like four dicks then I could go fuck all four of these foreign hoes
Euphoria, expensive taste
I got expensive clothes, I’m draped in BAPE
I love to paint a face, Takashi Murikami how I skeet the ink
Pause, the reason that she want me is I’m so mischievous
And it’s oh so obvious that we never be in love
But I love the ambiance when she make it do what it does
And it’s oh so obvious that I’m beating her like the subs
She’s a nurse, told her please pull that rubber out your purse
And then she gone take off her scrubs ‘fore we rehearse
She’s oh so wet like a tub, she said we might as well get in the tub
I said let’s go and take a shower
As I proceed to put my glove on and go and fuck and devour

[Hook]
She got my pistol in her throat
And I know everything she wants
She said it feels like dope when it’s her
She said it feels like dope when it’s her

[Verse 2: Brandon Thomas]
I got this chick named June, born in December
She only call me for my dick, said it’s like dope when it’s in her
Got this cold ass walk, lay her down and make her shiver
When I knock that ass down, catch a player yelling timber
Bless her body with this wood, whole thing never a splinter
She want to smoke, she bring trees
And roll em before she enter
Now that’s a winner if I seen it
Tell me that she love me when we fuck and she don’t mean it
Tell her friends about it when they chilling and she beaming
Now they want to try it
When she suck my pistol swear I only see my eyelids
She like a nigga in control, so I fuck her like a tyrant
She don’t play favorites with her hoes, get that booty like a pirate
She a star when we recording, but all these shows are private
Took her on a road run, she tried to get it while I’m driving
She a fiend and I’m her fix, and if this was the draft I’d be her number 1 pick
She know that I’m a dog, call me her number 1 pit
Fuck it I’m a legend
Trojan Smith & Wesson, either way we need protection
She can’t fuck with average, since I blessed her with perfection
Bet you catch her repping, she ain’t second guessing
