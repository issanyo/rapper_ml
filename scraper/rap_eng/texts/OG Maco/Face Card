Real nigga with a real grind
Get money, I don’t waste time
Real nigga, I don’t play round
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Real nigga with a real grind
Get money, I don’t waste time
Real nigga, I don’t play round
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him

[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
Popi took off on them balls
My Lamborghini is faster
I used to be lil rascal, now Popi live in a castle
My bitch is badder than yours
I got lil mama off Florence
I got them making a road rush
We hear the hatred in your voice
I see the shit in your eyes
It don’t take me by surprise
It don’t take me by surprise
I know you’re living a lie
I do not fuck with no nuts
Can’t put your trust in no nuts
I done grew up with no nuts
I ain’t grow up with them nuts
Popi pull up with that extra
We came a long way from last
Now I pull up in the Fisker
Burberry on my suspenders
Now the bitch calling me mister
This little bitch calling me mister
This little bitch say that she miss me
I doubt that she miss me

[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
Real nigga with a real grind
Get money, I don’t waste time
Real nigga, I don’t play round
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Real nigga with a real grind
Get money, I don’t waste time
Real nigga, I don’t play round
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
Face card like a black card but I’m brownskinned
Everywhere I go I’m king
If I got the move I’m in, damn
DC walking on QC street
What the fuck you doing
What you tryna find, I just need gas
I ain’t got to ask
What you need? What you doing?
What you doing? What you trapping?
What you trapping? What’s happening?
Face card ain’t shit
What you mean you selling bricks?
What you mean you got a lick?
What you mean you had a zip?
What you mean you had a trip?
What you mean you took a trip?
Damn, I been road running
I been making hundreds, I been seeing blue faces
I been seeing new money
I got more money, more dough in more places
What these niggas saying?
I don’t really know
What the fuck you had to be?
I ain’t got to know, face card go

[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
Real nigga with a real grind
Get money, I don’t waste time

Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Real nigga with a real grind
Get money, I don’t waste time
Real nigga, I don’t play round
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
Everywhere a nigga go, every nigga fuck with him
