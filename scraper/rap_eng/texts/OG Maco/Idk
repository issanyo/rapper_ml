I just learn how to control my dreams so i can kill you everytime
I just call her over where i did
So i can kill her everytime
Idk (3x)
Why i did just what i do
But i know you probably do it too
How you know?
Cause your people i be who
She got a mouth on her that really deserves awards
Ass on her i think she mixed with a horse
And she in a benz she never drove an accord
Got her on money while another nigga call
I ain't never met her if you need to tell her that I'm looking
Tired of waking up without a bitch in my kitchen cooking
Trynna learn the bitch but the bitch just be playing (ok)
She just want the fame
She don't know my life of fucking
Come fuck with me (3x)
It'd be lovely
Come fuck with me (3x)
It'd be lovely
Come fuck with me (3x)
It'd be lovely
Come fuck with me (3x)
It'd be lovely
You say your man won't treat you right
And them drugs won't treat you right
They just keep you up at night overthinking about your life
Idk (3x) exactly what you do
But i know you ain't living true
How you know? cause your right here with me too
She got a mouth on her no teeth i just felt her gums
Ass on her i can't wait to meet her mom
And she killing hoes like she strapped up with a bomb
Let me rob her hips cause her nigga did her wrong

I ain't never met her if you need to tell her that I'm looking
Tired of waking up without a bitch in my kitchen cooking
Trynna learn the bitch but the bitch just be playing (ok)
She just want the fame
She don't know my life of fucking
Come fuck with me (3x)
It'd be lovely
Come fuck with me (3x)
It'd be lovely
