[Hook: Curtis Williams]
I might go ice out my wrist
I might go cop me a whip
I might just fuck and then dip
Might take the ho on a trip
She fuck a nigga when I wanna
Countin' up in a Hummer
Niggas know we run the summer
Countin' up straight hundreds

[Hook: Curtis Williams]
I might go ice out my wrist

She fuck a nigga when I wanna
Countin' up in a Hummer
Niggas know we run the summer
Countin' up straight hundreds

[Verse 1: Curtis Williams]
Countin' up commas
Them hundreds, no dollars
My bitch from Bahamas
I fuck her, don't call her
Boss logo, no Prada
I been feeling like I been that nigga
Bedroom, got some foreign women
She don't even smoke but she still twisting
I'ma go ghost when I hit it
She do the most and she bitchin'
I keep a ho in the kitchen
She cook and clean and do the dishes
Niggas plottin' on my riches
Niggas know I'm really in it
I got niggas and they with it
All of your niggas is bitches
See me out and never say shit
Face card good, I never paid shit
Got a London chick, LA chick
Got a chick in Miami, I got a Bay chick
They gon' fuck with me when I say so
Plus they keep me blunted
She gon' fuck with me when I say so
Cause I keep it 100

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
I might go ice out my wrist
Oh shit, I already done it
I'ma go get me some gas
Oh shit I'm already blunted
Nigga might need a movie check
Goddamn, I did all this stunting
Time for countin' new hundreds
I just got some Rick on me
I just got your bitch on me
I don't even know her name homie
Fuck the bitch, you can have her
I just want to get the cabbage
I been eating all my veggies
I heard you niggas want beef
I hope the fuck niggas ready
I been cooking with that MAC-11
I been cooking niggas with the MAC-10
I just pulled your bitch again, goddamn
In my phone, put that bitch on private
Hit your bitch, hit her friend, oh my god I'm wyling

[Verse 3: Eearz]
Clip finger, risk taker
Slanging off the bannisters with no manners
I been on the gas all day, fill me up, gotta pedal 'em
Shit so strong and my bitch so grown
Disregard every room we're dismantling
We done got your spot hyped
Young nigga all in the spotlight
I just might ball on 'em like Knight
Fill the cups all up with ice
Move you to the sub for the right price
Read up on my stomach, said thug life
OG Danco, pass the bud right here
I might get geeked in this bitch
I'ma stick right to the script
I'ma stay true, never switch
Bust out molars and shit
I might just flood out my lip
Here's to the street
