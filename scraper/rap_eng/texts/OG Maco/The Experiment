[Rome Fortune Verse 1]
Look, polo on my body like it's 96
I came into this club looking for a lick
Ayy, a lick sip I look so liquor I zip my lips
Would ya look at that? That nigga done took his
Ayy, gotta get back, my niggas ain't rookies
Gotta get that, my heroes all took it
Gotta get racks, email my bookings
Gotta get racks, not for these hookers
For my sons, the world too small
Your girl too uh, and she like balls

[OG Maco Verse 2]
Don't sip, it feel right
That's the feud in the night
Use your body right
Record the actions, claim the summer night
Reward the efforts, satisfactions
You too can run next tip and smash it
Talk a big check, then laugh and cash it
Manly manage, manage, manly young boy like Will Weather
Danger, danger
Same lil nigga in his own space
Make it shake, sum' like a sundae
Need the milk, make a plate
Call yo bitch, four faces on the paint
Play a roll nor face

[Rome Fortune Verse 3]
Haul the face, right there
Paint it paint it and I can't it
Why not you why not advise like
My embago night, goggle sight
I'm like the side bug tonight
'Cus I'm locked in trying get you hyped
I'm not the vise lord tonight
'Cus em black bagolas always down to write

Running around is a feeling of excitement
Are you excited?
Running around is a feeling of excitement
Are you excited? Aye
Running around is a feeling of excitement
Staying stagnant, they sending you for indictment
Get your ass the backstage, you're one to try me
Run your cash, rip the last thing, I think it's fighting
Security, get the world back, I need an IV
And surely I get back quick to doing my things
And my dreams, and my bees, and no weed and no sleep
I got my head on straight, but nigga, I'm me
I got my head on straight, but nigga, I'm me
