[Hook]
I can’t pardon, you doubted me
You knew I would do this, my money so foolish
I’m laughing and cruising, finessing the music
Now pardon me, it’s back to these units, yeah yeah
Pardon me
I can’t pardon, you doubted me
You knew I would do this, my money so foolish
I’m laughing and cruising, finessing the music
Now pardon me, it’s back to these units, yeah yeah
Pardon me

[Verse 1]
I told em long before critics
I told em long before groupies and pictures
My vision amazing, mosaic
Put the pieces together, assemble my future
I’m just a symbol of hustle
I'll watch these niggas be blind to the facts
I made these youngins the monsters
This chopper got ammo, put pots in your scalp
I was the road running best cross the map
Black on black, MAC strap in my lap
Back on ol' nat, smash up the flats
[?] what we remixing cap
How long is forever? We winning till that
Oh that’s a Beretta? A carbon in back
I did it better, bitch pardon my dap
My fingers keep hurting from counting this cash
Pardon me

[Hook]
I can’t pardon, you doubted me
You knew I would do this, my money so foolish
I’m laughing and cruising, finessing the music
Now pardon me, it’s back to these units, yeah yeah
Pardon me
I can’t pardon, you doubted me
You knew I would do this, my money so foolish
I’m laughing and cruising, finessing the music
Now pardon me, it’s back to these units, yeah yeah
Pardon me
