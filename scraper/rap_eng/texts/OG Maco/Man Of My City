[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Gun in my hand, I'm tryna think right
Should I send 'em a message and leave 'em messy
Warm bodies and cold nights
Ain't all goin' home, aight?
Goddamn it, tryna survive a famine
While stealin' a few bandanas
We can sleep when a nigga dead
What if the niggas you trusted been talkin' to the feds?
Son's bedtime stories never getting read
Well not by you
He say he got a dad that was locked up too
What if the cops try and stop him too?
Reaching for the registration and they pop him too
Saddest part is it don't make news
While you cryin', ain't no sleep they lose
Lose lose for loose change
Risk a couple futures for a coupe or a new chain
Tell 'em to maintain, I'm just tryna change things
And nigga if that's cool I suggest you remain lame
Go where them nerds hang
School of hard knocks where he learn things
Detention is a prison, get the picture and burn it
Nigga there ain't no one perfect
Remember nigga just be honest
We all make mistakes, and if it ain't then you done it
Better tell that pussy DA run it

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Babe I love to see you hate me shining
Just know the poke it from the city
From the city
Now I'm the man in my city
Now I'm the man in my city
Now I'm the man in my city
Now I'm the man in my city
I'm the man in my city

[Verse 2: YG Trip & OG Maco]
Ay yo my nigga
It's time!
Get the picture from a side view
Back to the wall, ain't nobody else beside you
Steady wishing a record label would sign you
Receipts off the spot the lady asked me to sign to
Movin' with some killers that still will cook up they mom's food
Tickin' time bomb, you loose, go get your mind screwed
Hammer on the waist, this tool it got them bomb rules
Fifteen seconds of fame, go get your dog tag
Just left a nigga that grow Paris, I call him Conrad
Smokin' with this white dope girl, she got that tall ass
Long mag, she holdin' the strap, my trigger blow fast
We off that, more time we be on that

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Babe I love to see you hate me shining
Just know the poke it from the city
From the city
Now I'm the man in my city
Now I'm the man in my city
Now I'm the man in my city
Now I'm the man in my city
I'm the man in my city
