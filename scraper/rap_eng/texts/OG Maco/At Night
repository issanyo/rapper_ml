[Intro]
Mmmmm - mmmmmm

[Hook]
And I can't sleep at night
At night I've been rollin' alone
I can't sleep at night

[Verse 1]
I been slept on, I been slept on
Feelin' like a god damn Serta
Cutie Ass AK hurt em
Witches, and witches they wanna burn us
Copy, copy notes, keep taking they wanna learn us
Halfway late, dancin' with the devil have one hell of a day
And the great escape must be another nigga fate
Have another drink let it sit in
Have another slip let it fill, in his feelings
Real click, clip movie begin
In the real six, screaming [?]
Like a bitch with the thirst for the dick
Want it like love
Silly ass hoe don't want no scrub
Party party
Earlier early up this late
Preacher reachin' got souls at stake
Collection plate with a cocoa base
Section 8 turn to district 9
Paradigm shift in the paradox
Pair of bad bitches sleeping in the loft
Who gon find me?
Nigga who got lost
Offer a reference
Want that pussy, they offer a precedence

[Hook]
I can't sleep at night, I can't sleep at night
At night I've been rollin' alone
I can't sleep at night, I can't sleep at night
I can't sleep at night
I've been rollin' all alone
