It's four seasons
I bet she springing when I call
Use the summer just to ball
It's four seasons
You better rise before the fall
Cause it's a lot of winter months

Use the summer just to ball

You better rise before the fall
Cause it's a lot of winter months
It's four seasons x8

[Verse 2 - OG Maco]
In the spring rolling green leaves sipping green tea (sippin', sippin', sippin')
In the summer I was super hot (Mmhm. What you doin? What you doin?)
In my socks got some super rocks (What you got? What's your price? What you trappin'?)
Waist band got a stupid Glock
Yeah yeah
Damn
(Pause)
Checking in-to the hotel motel what you do? Iono
What you sell?
I can't tell
If I get caught, I get no bail (damn, damn, damn, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em)
Fuck it man, we living well like
(Yeah yeah)
