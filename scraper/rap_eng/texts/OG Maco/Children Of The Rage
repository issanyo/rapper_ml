[Hook]
Oh the children cry, children, cry
Riding in the underworld, riding in underworld
Just one time, just one time
Somebody lied now we get it, somebody lied
Somebody lied now we get it, somebody lied
Somebody lied
We are, children of the rage
We are, children of the rage

[Verse]
Fuck it we ready and well conditioned
Lil niggas outside saving that condition
Got a couple good memories from tradition
Got a couple good stories can't tell 'em cause they listenin'
Talking co-conspiracy in me from the cell he in hell
Inhale ease the pain with the ganja
He the only reason that I answer foreign numbers
Name and number, no more days in this bitch
At least he kept solid never snitched
My only real problem with the shit is I'm shining
And he still behind the wall doing 10 maybe 20
And my cousin doing 6 maybe 7 free Jalila yellin'
I'm rapping for some niggas who will never be famous
Never rock a show and known to keep a load of beggar
They just living in the moment cause you dying
And you say your last words
Last day last thoughts to the council
Got me looking at the shit like the money ain't the answer
Regardless I'ma get it used to put it in the dresser
I ain't learn it from these niggas so I sound like a professor
I'm simply passing the message and praying these niggas get it
And these women grew up watching tip drill
Gon' be like the girl Roxy Reynolds
If you seen what we seen you be this too
They ain't teach you that my brain been misused, yeah

[Hook]
Oh the children cry, children, cry
Riding in the underworld, riding in underworld
Just one time, just one time
Somebody lied now we get it, somebody lied
Somebody lied now we get it, somebody lied
Somebody lied
We are, children of the rage
We are, children of the rage
