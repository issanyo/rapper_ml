[Intro]
Damn
OG Mac
Yeah, Yeah

[Hook]
I'm the ghoul in the alley
I've been trained to lack emotion
All this gas got me floating
Power lapping while I'm coasting
Money blue it's like it's loc'ing
Niggas hating so it's on us
Bitches coming no promotion
And it's all how we planned it
The fake could never understand it
And it's all how we planned it
How I'm lapping while I'm coasting
Money blue, it's like it's loc'ing
Niggas hating so it's on us
And it's all how we planned it
If they could never understand it
And it's all how we planned it

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Move in methods you can't understand
Lessons learned from the street and corner
Do good business, I move underhand
Hand on pistol pussy pay your dues
Shiny barrel you don't want the news
You could make it you don't have to take it but it's right now when you think you crazy
Baby baby crying cause she hungry
Maybe you like money
Where the green at in this mother fucker?
Where the weed at this mother fucker?
Sippin'-sippin' Actavis, it's real
Thinking back I don't know how we made it
Good finesse a lot of praying
Late at night, a lot of rounds
Later on, another pound

[Hook]
I'm the ghoul in the alley
I've been trained to lack emotion
All this gas got me floating
Power lapping while I'm coasting
Money blue it's like it's loc'ing
Niggas hating so it's on us
Bitches coming no promotion
And it's all how we planned it
The fake could never understand it
And it's all how we planned it
How I'm lapping while I'm coasting
Money blue, it's like it's loc'ing
Niggas hating so it's on us
And it's all how we planned it
If they could never understand it
And it's all how we planned it


[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
It was all how we planned it (planned it)
A hundred K juug, then I planned it
I came from the churches no mansions
Three Cuban links and my Rolex is dancing
This is for shooters and killers
Chopper make him dead like it's thriller
OG Maco say where is the weed
And we know that you will fall for a plea
Catch QC on the front magazine
Catch the b then I change magazines
Chop a brick, then I serve up 10 P's
Yo bitch good promotion she get on her knees
Everything come true like dreams
Dare to get a town what I spend on the lean
All I smoke gas no jody
Five pairs of time and I know you can't afford 'em

[Hook]
I'm the ghoul in the alley
I've been trained to lack emotion
All this gas got me floating
Power lapping while I'm coasting
Money blue it's like it's loc'ing
Niggas hating so it's on us
Bitches coming no promotion
And it's all how we planned it
The fake could never understand it
And it's all how we planned it
How I'm lapping while I'm coasting
Money blue, it's like it's loc'ing
Niggas hating so it's on us
And it's all how we planned it
If they could never understand it
And it's all how we planned it
