[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
All of my niggas they violent
All of my niggas they wyling
Sticking they chopper out the window
Everybody grab extendos
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
All of my niggas they violent

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
Come to your house, like some intruders
Keep the strap on me, all up in hooters
I ain’t even tripping, I know the game come with snakes
Try to cross me, you crossing a nigga who got cake
Bloody summer, up the murder rate
Got to test the shooters, better not hesitate
Let a nigga play with me, his pussy ass dead yesterday
Mike & Ikes on that stick, Put Mike & Ikes on your bitch
What goes around comes around, I heard that karma is a bitch
Pull up on a nigga, you talking bout taking what?
What’s the situation? Bullets penetrating
Feels good to go to war when your cake up
Bullets kissing niggas, go ahead and make up
All of my niggas they violent

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
All of my niggas they violent
All of my niggas they wyling
Sticking they chopper out the window
Everybody grab extendos
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
All of my niggas they violent

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
All of my niggas they violent
Dudes with Rugers trained to murk the foolish
Paratrooping, got the drop on em
[?],  we got Glocks for em
Wyling out, busting twin cannons
AR singing like Mariah, leave em there
High and buying bags and [?], tryna fry this lil chicken nigga
Melon splitting, all those killers thinking
So precise, talking dame dizzle
But it’s raining rounds so they can’t miss em
Every victim used to be an issue
7 thousand just to spend on pistols
And them [?] will rearrange your gristle
Seven six to a scud missile
Scrub nigga, call me mister clean
All you see is beams, red on em, got the green light
Youngins with me ain’t been living right
You’ll take a chance and they’ll take your life
AK on em with the lighter knife
MAC 11 with the night sights
Type bring guns to a knife fight
Still stab a nigga cause it’s on sight
If I owe you I'mma get right, yeah!

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
All of my niggas they violent
All of my niggas they wyling
Sticking they chopper out the window
Everybody grab extendos
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
All of my niggas they violent

[Verse 3: Skippa Da Flippa]
All of my niggas they violent
All of my shots they silent
One thing bout my gang
They all gon bust, even who driving
Can’t flex, I love to shoot the MAC 10s
Make a blood bath, 6 feet in the deep end
Put the barrel to his chin if he six ten
Only pull out the vector on the weekends
I forgot I keep a pump like the trapper
Yeah I shop at Jefferies, but I am no butler
I stay doing deep shit like I am Jay Cutler
Remix the [?] like DJ Flip Mustard
Shoot at his lungs till they turn to linguini
Italian boss shit, all I eat is fettuccini
You better know Flippa squeeze till it’s empty
Hit em with the semi, and skrt off in the [?]
One thing about it, you know I shoot fast
Small and big chopper I call em [?]
I’m a true drinker, it’s lean in my flask
Lots of green in my face like I’m the mask
Give my lil nigga a task, he gone pass
We might load em up, Flippa we shoot real fast
[?] ripped out and I keep ten mags
I seen your bitch lately and she look like trash

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
All of my niggas they violent
All of my niggas they wyling
Sticking they chopper out the window
Everybody grab extendos
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
Jump out the car, and all you hear is
All of my niggas they violent
