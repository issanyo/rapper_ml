[Hook: (x2)]
Whoa damn, how we livin' just like watchin' movies
Whoa wow, way too stupid now we pick and choose it
Drink, loud combination got me feelin' woozy
Oh wow, how we livin' just like watchin' movies


[Verse 1:]
East wood my viewpoint
Dirty Harry could just get it in
Extra bitches bringin' extra fans
So I'm fuckin' twins just by accident
The shit is easy no laxative
No less of me like a [?] function
Bet on me like I'm playin' homies
Aiming high like I'm plannin' [?]
Money comin' even in a coma
[?]
The stupid J's they the realest on us
Catchin' clothes feelin' like ammonia
Trenches hoes if you wanna struggle
Teach your son help him live better
Dirty bottles and they still comin'
Pour them all and make the floor wetter, yeah

[Hook: (x2)]

[Verse 2:]
I am legend, but I'm not alone
Space Jam, we monstars
All these shows for a new car
All this gas just for one car?
[?] all these states around me
Luckily those are not my niggas
Ocean 12, [?]
Now they in a pickle got the sour face
Couple drinks, got a hard taste
Said fuck a nigga win the cupcakes
Peter sellin' dreams out the pad
Fuck around and got him out the hood
[?] He use to be the man
Peter's [?] lookin' like a book
Let this happen you ain't gotta worry
Bitches how the fuck you want a lease from me
