[Intro: OG Maco & Doja Cat]
The days are getting longer (The days are getting longer)
It's hard growing [?] (It's hard growing [?])
The nights are growing longer (The nights are growing longer)
The cold is getting warmer (The cold is getting warmer)

[Hook: OG Maco & Doja Cat]
We all could be the monsters (We all could be the monsters)
We all could be the cancer (We all could be the cancer)
We all don't have the answers (We all don't have the answers)
[?] slowly killing [?]
We all might be the monsters
We all might be the monsters
We're only getting stronger

[Bridge: OG Maco]
Oh it's a dark path
Moving in the dead of night
[?] at the speed of light
[?]
Lookin' me at the mirror
[?]
Oh we ain't living right
Oh we ain't living right

[Verse: Doja Cat]
Feel it if you feelin' right
Do not fuck with me tonight
I been at the peak of life
I don't wanna see the light
They gon' wanna figure
If you got your money, hide
I've been on a money high
[?] call me right
Some of these niggas snitches
[?] every one in sight
Look up in the mirror
Tell me if we see eye to eye
Cause we the same bitch, different story
Same shit, different toilet
Same whip, shit's [?]
[?] feel important [?]

[Hook: OG Maco & Doja Cat]
We all could be the monsters (We all could be the monsters)
We all could be the cancer (We all could be the cancer)
We all don't have the answers (We all don't have the answers)
[?] slowly killing [?]
We all might be the monsters
We all might be the monsters
We're only getting stronger

[Bridge: OG Maco & Doja Cat]
Oh it's a dark path
Moving in the dead of night
[?] at the speed of light
[?]
Lookin' me at the mirror
[?]
Oh we ain't living right
Oh we ain't living right

[Outro]
We all might be the monster
We all might be the monster
We're only getting stronger
We're only getting stronger
