When shit gets real they stretching out your bodies
Not me, why see, I see
Too many niggas hooked to IVs

You waiting on me for that wedding ring

Pardon me but my potty mouth brought these new bucks
Butt naked no tuck steel
Well-dressed, less hoes
Less dressed, more dope
Could spent on my fam cause they deserve this
All I ever wanted in the morning was some mo' rest
Mama said why you lay around like a rich man
Now she only ask if I get that sleep and
