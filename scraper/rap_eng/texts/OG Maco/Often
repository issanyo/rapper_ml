[Hook]
When I smoke, that is often
Gas strong, got a young nigga coughin'
When I count, that is often
Get them hundreds, get them Franklins, they be mountain
When I ride, that is often
BMW, in that bitch I be trappin'
When I win, that is often
Do that shit with all my niggas, man that's somethin'

[Verse 1]
I am awesome, I'm not Glizzy
I'm with Dolan and my nigga, we gettin' gleeshy
Yeah it's crazy, shout my nigga Yung Gleeshy
From the south, I'm from the 3, that's if you need me
From the mac with the ado
If you fuck nigga, fuck nigga [?] we testin'
I got good shit and I got bad shit
Man the streets done drove me crazy, I feel batshit
When I smoke, that is often
It is gas, not that fuck shit that you buyin'
I got Rollie on, you wanna come and try it
Got that 30 on, I be some millions dyin'

[Hook]
When I smoke, that is often
Gas strong, got me coughin'
When I count, that is often
Get them Franklins and them hundreds, they be mountain
When I ride, that is often
BMW, I'm slidin' in a trophy
When I win, that is often
Do that shit with all my niggas, that is often

[Verse 2]
I'm the realest and these niggas know it's realer
I'm the realer, put the 'nana clip into Haley's comet
Shit I'm with it
[?]
Know some niggas comin' in the trap with Vince
If they feds, we too silent
I got bundles in the closet and in the walls
I got dope, I put it in my bitch drawers
Oh my God, niggas flaw
That is often, they meet the coffin
I take trips and my passport got them stamps
I make wishes but I didn't come out a lamp

[Hook]
When I smoke, that is often
Gas strong, got me coughin'
When I count, that is often
Get them Franklins and them hundreds, they be mountain
When I ride, that is often
BMW, I'm slidin' in a trophy
When I win, that is often
With all my niggas I do all that shit, it's often
