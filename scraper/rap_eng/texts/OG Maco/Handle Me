[Intro]
Excuse all this flexing I'm doing
Excuse all this flexing I'm doing
OGG
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Excuse all this flexing I'm doing
Don't lie, bitch, I know you'd don' guessed it
I'm doing this shit like I knew I would, suggestions ain't welcome
Plus, I'm used to your bitch getting naked like 'damn man I think she a nudist
I did it, I handled depression how perfect they processing the units
I figured the figures for me and my niggas, now let's pop some bottles
I'm coping the Audi to push it full throttle and fill it up with models
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, yeah, yeah, now I want more
Used to dream about a mill, now I want four
Used to dream about a deal, now I'm on tour
Got them pounds from the grams
In the game from the stands

[Hook]
Handle me, handle me
I don't think no one can handle me
Handle me with these bands on me
My boxers and socks like a band a piece
Handle me, handle me
I don't think none can do handle me
Handle me with these bands on me
My boxers and socks like a band a piece
Handle me, handle me
I look down yo' bitch got her hands on me
Handle me, handle me

[Verse 3]
Yo shit probably used to be something its nothing you not in discussion
I can't handle all this walking from ballin just left King of Prussia
Bitch bow when you see me, I'm royalty, bitch, who didn't teach you no manners?
I'm so off the handle
There's drugs my phantom, that's purple and candy
Handle me, I don't..

[Outro]
Handle me, handle me
I don't think no one can handle me
Handle me with these bands on me
My boxers and socks like a band a piece
Handle me, handle me
Handle me, yeah, yeah
OGG
