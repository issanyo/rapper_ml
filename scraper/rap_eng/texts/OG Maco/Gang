When I wake in the morning i’m talking cash stead of yawning
Its still crust in my eyes but I got the plan devised
If you down to ride you
You can run it up
Remix the zero
Be hero
Keep it simple
Know the stakes
You want steak neva kimbles
See a nigga winning neva hate
Work triple
Fuckemfuckemfuckem
No we winning
Young legend
Ken Griffey Jr
Blake Griffin
Harry Potter Griffyndor

No nimbus want a nimble Porsche

Snappin cappin
Made it happen
Bitter bastards got me laughin
Money short a have me spazzin
Don’t do it
Piston system got the rifle shootin fluid
Barely kickin
Barely spittin
Yeah yeah

I know you love
I knew you’d love me
I remember when ya didn’t
I know you hate
I knew you’d fake it
Thats why I’m just kicking pimpin
My niggas get it like a caesar
How we buzzing like a beeper
All from trapping under bleachers

Re-up in my sneakers

Movie man my teachers
Hustlehustle in my features
Mama told me always pray
Pops told me make a way
Any nigga say they made me cept them cray

Tellin whale tales while we making waves
Prices wholesale
Selling it like ye
Celibate or nay I asked your ho
Fucked her silly
Gave her crazy pole

I know you love
I knew you’d love me
I remember when ya didn’t
I know you hate
I knew you’d fake it
Thats why I’m just kicking pimpin
