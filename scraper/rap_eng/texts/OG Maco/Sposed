[Hook: OG Maco]
I just do it how a nigga sposed
I just do it how a nigga sposed
I can play it how these niggas play
I can play it how these niggas play
And you know that, and you know that
Ay, I just do it how a nigga sposed
I just do it how a nigga sposed
I can play it how these niggas play

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I hate all on the hate for me
I hate all the nonsense
I hate all the answers about me
But fuck it I got all this ass around me
My motive is elevation
Make money from frustration
These dummies can't comprehend
My team full of day ones
The others just play with friends, I'm in on the plot nigga
We came from the block nigga, we on some Iraq nigga
Not amusin' we moving like rock nigga
They can see I'm on the top nigga
I guess they got blinders on, or focused like Sky Summers
Legendary like Stevie Wonders
They ain't sleep, they fucking comin'
I got hits like I'm still serving
Fuck that bitch and get back to earth
Take a trip and get bad for it
Hit the Henny and then hit on stage
I got niggas careers made
But that shit like that old base

[Hook: OG Maco]
I just do it how a nigga sposed
I just do it how a nigga sposed
I can play it how these niggas play
I can play it how these niggas play
And you know that, and you know that
Ay, I just do it how a nigga sposed
I just do it how a nigga sposed
I can play it how these niggas play
