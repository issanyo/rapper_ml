[Verse 1: Miloh Smith]
We can run away, run away to place in the back of my mind where no one's there
I like it there, yeah
Seems to make me feel with you, even better when I'm alone

[Hook: Miloh Smith]
Can't keep thinking about it
Can't keep sleeping without you, babe
I know you do too, we can do whatever we want (oooh)

[Chorus: OG Maco]
I left a message in your phone, girl (ooh)
Tryna give you want girl
( ?)

[Verse 2: Miloh Smith]
We can run away, run away to be in a place, no I don't care
I like it there, yeah
I can feel you feel me, baby i'll be waiting at home (oooh)

[Hook 2: Miloh Smith]
Can't keep singing about it
Can't wait til' i'm around it, baby
We can do whatever, we grown

[Chorus: OG Maco]
I left a message in your phone, girl (ooh)
Tryna give you want girl
( ?)
