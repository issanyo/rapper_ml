[Verse 1: Cydnee with a C]
I'll be what's on your mind
And I'll be right by your side, just
Close your eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1: Cydnee with a C]
'Cause I could do whatever, all the time
Instead I run in your mind
I don't wanna say what's ready or not
But I don't think it's the time, baby
You

[Chorus: Cydnee with a C]
And I'll be your chick and you know it, yea
You know I'm always not boring, woah
Just don't take my love for granted
And I'll be your chick and you know it, yea
You know I'm always not boring, woah
Just don't take my love for granted

[Verse 2: Cydnee with a C]
I think I crossed the line
I do that all the time, forgive me
For doing the most

[Pre-Chorus 2: Cydnee with a C]
'Cause I see that you got a wondering eye
You've got something on your mind
I'm so afraid that you'll tell me a lie
Been endin' up wasting my time
Should be down for the ride

[Chorus: Cydnee with a C]
And I'll be your chick and you know it, yea
You know I'm always not boring, woah
Just don't take my love for granted
And I'll be your chick and you know it, yea
You know I'm always not boring, woah
Just don't take my love for granted

[Verse 3: OG Maco]
I see your the real side
Oh, no, ya you shine like the base side
Oh, likin' it out in base side
[?]
I look at you like a cabin
I love when you get the [?]
And if you call me, girl, I'm right there
And if you're bothered I'll be right there

[Chorus: Cydnee with a C]
And I'll be your chick and you know it, yea
You know I'm always not boring, woah
Just don't take my love for granted
And I'll be your chick and you know it, yea
You know I'm always not boring, woah
Just don't take my love for granted
