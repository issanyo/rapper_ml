[Verse 1: Curtis Williams]
Box logos no V-necks, I'm twisting my fingers
Your bitch wanna fuck and she tells me she need it
Break it down, roll it up
Then I take blunts to the face to the point I get [?]
Percocets, xanax and aderall, I got pill problems
Ma need a crib, big bro got a kid
My dad need a car, got real problems
Uh, drink until I can't think my boy
Pussy wet, I might sink, oh Lord
Old hoes, we 'on't talk no more
Got a check and went and bought out the store
We 'on't shop at the malls
Pissy drunk, I might stumble and fall
Name on my phone but I probably won't call
Probably won't call

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
Yeah, I used to have Xanax waves
Hustle in a daze
Percocet poppin' on the way to make the play
High tech activist just activate my lane
Ol' girl bitchin' bout' my new girl gettin' thangs
It's like big face hundreds to give my small faces dreams
Gapped tooth youngin's wearin' big brother jeans
Big brother watchin' twelve plottin' on the team
9 after 2 on the block them shots ring
Two 9s on me, 60 rounds in my jeans
Every 60 seconds new block, different scheme
My father art in heaven know it's hell to live serene
To my father I'm indebted cause he taught me how to dream
Bitch
