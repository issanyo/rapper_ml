[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Bank account optimal, 5,705 to see life through these opticals
Gold metal solider how we over come these obstacles
Leave it up to me, it's lobster shell somewhere tropical
Nautical won't catch me in no Nautica
Autobio writer, ain't no autorin'
A blind worker could easily see the boss in him
They bite my shit like gators, well look what costin' 'em
Aggravatin' haters, don't talk paper just to cost in him
The cost of bein' us leave them broker than the whips they in
Mad cause they hoopie ridin', I'm slidin' in somethin' murdered out
Suicide doors just to let us muthafuckas out
Only niggas known to keep her wet in the fuckin' drought, bitch!

[Hook]
Old hoes, new hoes, no hoes, money
We been wit ya new girl, and old girl chummy
Conversation lightin' him, she said she wanna suck me
It's like old hoes, new hoes, no hoes, money
Old hoes, new hoes, no hoes, money
We been wit ya new girl, and old girl chummy
Conversation lightin' him, she said she wanna suck me
It's like old hoes, new hoes, no hoes, money

[Verse 2: Curtis Williams]
I said, comin' down with my windows up and my weed rolled
Niggas know the gang before the see a gang, smell the weed smoke
Said, new money, got a new bitch, but the same clique
Niggas tweet a lot, when they see me out, they never do shit
Got a pound of weed in my trunk, bitch
Lobster plate for my lunch, bitch, ain't touched one
My young niggas on that dumb shit
Teachers said I wouldn't be shit
Self made I on't need shit
Used to skip class with the same clothes
Had no money, used to dream shit
Bathing ape with the full zips
Raf Simons with the three stripes
Your bitch bad, her toes up
So I took her home and gave her three pipe
Talkin' old hoes got new money, bitch

[Hook]
Old hoes, new hoes, no hoes, money
We been wit ya new girl, and old girl chummy
Conversation lightin' him, she said she wanna suck me
It's like old hoes, new hoes, no hoes, money
Old hoes, new hoes, no hoes, money
We been wit ya new girl, and old girl chummy
Conversation lightin' him, she said she wanna suck me
It's like old hoes, new hoes, no hoes, money
