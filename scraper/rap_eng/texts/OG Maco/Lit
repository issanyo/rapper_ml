[Intro: OG Maco]
She wanna
She wanna
She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
She wanna

[Hook: OG Maco]
She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
She wanna pop a bottle, she takin' pictures naked
Now she flexin' and tellin' these niggas she model
I wanna see her get naked and see 'bout her preference
Like girl, do you spit or swallow?
I got some gas, I do not smoke it no more
But it's here if you fall through
Better roll backwards for backshots
Hurry up, patience, I have not
I got the country on smash now
We gettin' lit like a bonfire
Yo' nigga the type that I might hire
Tell him we havin' a fe fe and he need some money
Go pass out the damn flyers
We givin' betta' nights
We make you sweat it out
We watch you make out with best friends
And leave when you pass out on dirty couch
It's time to fuck it up
It's time to pop all the Dom P
I'm takin' yo phone, so when you take snaps
They won't see ya' fuckin', suckin' me
You wit' the winner's bitch
It's time to get lit

[Hook: OG Maco]
She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

[Verse 2: Cam Sheely]
She just rolled ova' like AT&T
And said to me, "Cam, let me tell you my dreams."
Funny she just started strippin' at Dreams
Man, I fuck wit' her tho', she remind me of me
Man, she only 19, but that ass 23
Same name as my mama
Goddamn, man, her birthday is 10/17
How lit is that? Man, that's too lit for me
She neva' buy weed, she get it for free
She get in for free
After she got in for free, went and got her a drink
While she waitin' on me
Post a pic on IG, and tag me in it so everyone sees
Then I woke from my sleep and said, "Back to your dreams!"
I'm sorry last night was just too L.I.T

[Hook]
She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

[Verse 3: Quavo]
100 racks on me, no flex
She only fuck with my check
I'm livin' life on a jet
My nigga' die for respect
I'm livin' life like it is no tomorrow
My nigga', I came from the bottom
I ain't even have a dolla'
Now I got bitches wanna suck and swallow
Told lil' mama, she ain't never seen a fish scale
When I was a young nigga, I had to trap a L
Told my mama I'll never let the money take my soul
Just a young nigga', I'm having birds singing like Nat King Cole
I pull the string like a nigga' play rock'n'roll
I never ever made the honor roll
Look at your bitch, she so vulnerable
My life is so serious, not comical
I eat my opponent like cannibals
Feds watchin' me like Channel 2

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
It's time to get lit

She wanna pour some
She wanna roll some
We with the shits
