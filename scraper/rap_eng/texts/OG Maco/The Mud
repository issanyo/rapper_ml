[Intro]
But I be in a lot shit so I keep it on the real
I robbed a couple niggas
Took some bricks from some people
Recently, right before that umm
Like, I’ve been around a lot people who do a lot of bad shit
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, damn, Oh Jesus
Hey, hey, hey
Oh Jesus, Carnage, hey
Hey, damn, damn, damn

[Hook]
It’s a whole lot of money that I’m dreaming on
Billion with the ten yeah, the millions some
We should win the mud, we should win the grind
That’s why everybody love to see a young’n shine
Put them haters outta sight make them lose they mind
Ain’t gon’ say you haven’t been real cause you been on your grind
They call you for that money when it’s rainy time
That’s why everybody love to see a young’n shine

[Verse 1]
Damn, oh no, oh no they see it coming
Predictions dismal for these PO niggas
Shining starter when it’s prime time
Just like Deion Sanders vs. Mr Flanders
For the famine, call the family
I’m a bring the mayhem
I’m a show them Carnage savage
Then these bodies get the verses, off the satisfaction
Just to say I did it
History written by the winner so all these goons they not winning
Pussy niggas said I wouldn’t, how could I forget you
I on’ know your name, just a mental picture
Let em know scribble, scribble hit spot, I’m a keep the torch
How you love cappin’ from the porch
And you PUC  finesse the sport
91 more, got a million I’m a work for it
How you love cappin’ from the porch
And you PUC finesse the sport
91 more, got a million I’m a work for it
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
It’s a whole lot of money that I’m dreaming on
Billion with the ten yeah, the millions some
We should win the mud, we should win the grind
That’s why everybody love to see a young’n shine
Put them haters outta sight make them lose they mind
Ain’t gon’ say you haven’t been real cause you been on your grind
They call you for that money when it’s rainy time
That’s why everybody love to see a young’n shine

[Verse 2]
Damn, wanna win by the bench or court
It is crunch time, come on play the role
I was almost gone before the fourth
On my day in court, seen a snitch nigga
Crazy shit he used to be my friend
Now he sold us all for 50 cents
We will, what a cheap feeling, that’s the city thrill
I’ll understand, where the training cap
Taking niggas off the map
Feeling on the trigger, have my back
One man on the scout
Wrestle  money for the drought
Wrestle money, did he tell on the stone cold
Couple hundreds, get it how you live
Get it how you wanna, do it big
With your little homies, fuck the standard
We don’t eat balogna, shotta hoes
And we gon’ work the standard
[?] Latinas when the phone ring, the phone ring
It’s the new fling talking very naughty
I’m a kill her pussy, I’m a catch her body
When she feeling her type of love, she thinking
Even when I hold the counter shit and the bitches money

[Hook]
It’s a whole lot of money that I’m dreaming on
Billion with the ten yeah, the millions some
We should win the mud, we should win the grind
That’s why everybody love to see a young’n shine
Put them haters outta sight make them lose they mind
Ain’t gon’ say you haven’t been real cause you been on your grind
They call you for that money when it’s rainy time
That’s why everybody love to see a young’n shine

[Outro]
Damn, damn!
