[Chorus]
I'm lit in a real dark room
I'm dealing with some real good news
I'm hearing that we all can't lose
From winter to the flowers bloom
I'm lit in a real dark room
I'm dealing with some real good news
I'm hearing that we all can't lose
From winter to the flowers bloom

[Verse 1]
Them bottles won't pop themselves
You spent a lot, oh do tell
My videos on my cell
Oh now I'm beside myself
My art just getting praised and lauded
We see you made some shit then tossed it
I'm thinking let's kill 'em, awesome
Now can we preorder coffins
Being knights was getting so exhausting
Just look how Joey did Dawson
Then Rose and Jack freeze, just watching
It feels life like a movie 'posit
Producer, director, sauce me
The children of the rage been sought up
Now you feel like defective, don't ya?
Inducing inception on ya

[Chorus]
I'm lit in a real dark room
I'm dealing with some real good news
I'm hearing that we all can't lose
From winter to the flowers bloom
I'm lit in a real dark room
I'm dealing with some real good news
I'm hearing that we all can't lose
From winter to the flowers bloom

[Verse 2]
I'm 'posed to be civil
I'm 'posed to blanket out my mental
I'm 'posed to roll rental
I'm 'posed to not show my dental
My auntie done passed from seizures
My granny done passed, I need her
My uncle just passed from cancer
I'm still lookin' for fucking answers
Oh, that cash it keep comin'
And I be coming home
Yeah I wasn't gone too long
Ah, yeah I be coming home
I wasn't gone too long

[Chorus]
I'm lit in a real dark room
I'm dealing with some real good news
I'm hearing that we all can't lose
From winter to the flowers bloom
I'm lit in a real dark room
I'm dealing with some real good news
I'm hearing that we all can't lose
From winter to the flowers bloom
