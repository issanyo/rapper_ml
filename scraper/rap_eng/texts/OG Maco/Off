[Intro: OG Maco]
Shit
Yeah yeah
Fuck
Grah grah, yeah yeah

[Hook: OG Maco]
Heater on my waist, might just off 'em
Niggas ‘round like flies might just off ‘em
Bitch I'm not Father but I'm off
Bare face, I'm on one 'til I off
Heater on my waist, might just off 'em
Niggas ‘round like flies might just off ‘em
Bitch I'm not Father but I'm off
Bare face I'm on one 'til I off

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Ridin' 'round with my namesake, that new MAC
Ridin' 'round with that 30 clip, we gon' use that
Pussy nigga love to talk shit 'til they mans whacked
One point and my youngin' heater get your fam wet
Hundred round make the chopper sing like a boys band
Panamera got the youngin' shootin' out the hatchback
Whispers on a nigga phone, think they got my cell tapped
Shooter call a nigga phone say they took the bail back
Heater on a nigga lap, I'ma get through hell back
Bails on a nigga line, I'ma tell him fall back
Opps on a nigga tail, spray 'em, make 'em fall back
Never seen these niggas in the field, don't recall that

[Hook: OG Maco]
Heater on my waist, might just off 'em
Niggas ‘round like flies might just off ‘em
Bitch I'm not Father but I'm off
Bare face, I'm on one 'til I off
Heater on my waist, might just off 'em
Niggas ‘round like flies might just off ‘em
Bitch I'm not Father but I'm off
Bare face, I'm on one 'til I off

[Verse 2: Young Crazy]
Give a fuck what these niggas on
Swear to God I will off them
Now his hood doing donations
Just to buy his dumb ass a coffin
Young Crazy doing one ten in that new Benz, I ain't walkin'
The fuck you mean? I was 14 with a pocket full of blue dolphin
Picture me ridin', no rollerskates when we slidin'
Big clips when we grindin'
That nigga a ghost, ain't talkin power
Pulled up and that nigga was hidin'
My chain hit like the light switch
Put my re-up on my right wrist
No Instagram, fuck tappin' the screen
Everything I do your bitch like this
I'm in that old Jag like I'm Left Wish
You can't ride ho, you gettin' left bitch
Crazy count, bitch I stay lit, ayy fuck I look like buy a light
Think he on top, he get shot down
My niggas catch bodies like the firefighters
Young Crazy

Heater on my waist, might just off 'em

Bare face, I'm on one 'til I off
Heater on my waist, might just off 'em
Niggas ‘round like flies might just off ‘em
Bitch I'm not Father but I'm off
Bare face, I'm on one 'til I off
