[Intro: OG Maco]
Let me talk to 'em, yeah yeah

[Hook: OG Maco]
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We the fuckin' greatest
Bitch, we're livin' good
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We say fuck the haters!
Bitch, we're livin' good

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I'ma tell 'em how the charts look
I'ma tell you that your shit's weak
All that bitch I'm on a [?] shit
I'ma show 'em how to three-peat
I'm on the strong, see men weak
Easy pickings, lose 'em all, sheep
For any reason, hard to kill, I'm eatin'
[?]
In any setting we the ones that conquer
In any setting I am [?]
[?] is ready if they want the drama
Want some commas, come and look at somethin'
Everything is 'bout the digits
How you ballin' on percentage?
Buyin' clutches but you clutchin' pennies
I'm so clutch I should have a Hemi in me
Bitch you're movin' forward like a semi speed
Why they send me beats [?]
Oh my Lord
They're hearin' my records, I'm off shores
They sellin' my block so it's in store
Now I'm in store and they want more

[Hook: OG Maco]
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We the fuckin' greatest
Bitch, we're livin' good
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We say fuck the haters!
Bitch, we're livin' good
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We the fuckin' greatest
Bitch, we're livin' good
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We say fuck the haters!
Bitch, we're livin' good

[Verse 2: Losa]
We're the greatest, open your eyes up and see
We came from the bottom where hope don't exist
And no opportunity to leave
The lack of resources taught us how to create something out of nothing
So our time is coming
All these home runs, feel like we're on a winning spree
You see? Losa
Many doubted, now they're lookin' stupid
Lack of faith in it, you're foolish
Went from overdrawn from bank account
Now the bank account, it is just stupid
I was sucker free so while they doubted us
Maco told me y'all just stupid
Everything that we said we was gon' do
We doin', can't say nothin' to us, OGG

[Hook: OG Maco]
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We the fuckin' greatest
Bitch, we're livin' good
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We say fuck the haters!
Bitch, we're livin' good
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We the fuckin' greatest
Bitch, we're livin' good
Let me talk to 'em
Tell 'em listen good
We say fuck the haters!
Bitch, we're livin' good
