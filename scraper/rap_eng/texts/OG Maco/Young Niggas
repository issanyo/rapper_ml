[Hook]
Momma pray for me, and my young niggas
Ain't no fear in the hearts of these young niggas
Father don't forsake me and my young niggas
We just gotta eat, got this hunger in us

[Verse 1]
Breaking this otto 'cause who the fuck plays the lotto
Riding this taco my enemy never spot though
Laying off them rounds keep squeezing until they down
Go into the house make sure to grab every pound
Weight of the world just had a new baby girl
From boys to men from innocence straight to sin
And fuck the judge they send them straight to the pen
19 got life for snitching friends
Oh lord

[Hook]
Momma pray for me, and my young niggas
Ain't no fear in the hearts of these young niggas
Father don't forsake me and my young niggas
We just gotta eat, got this hunger in us
Momma pray for me, and my young niggas
Ain't no fear in the hearts of these young niggas
Father don't forsake me and my young niggas
We just gotta eat, got this hunger in us

[Verse 2]
Go make that drop before it hit 8 o'clock
This ain't no home he could just get [?]
I got the plug I got the nigga who printing it
He got accounts, he solid, he know the system
This some AA's some navy's it's time to get it
I want that maro that gammo 'bout 40 honchos
I'm bout to meet 'em I'll call you after I see him
Turn on the news he doomed just lost his freedom
Oh lord

[Hook]
Momma pray for me, and my young niggas
Ain't no fear in the hearts of these young niggas
Father don't forsake me and my young niggas
We just gotta eat, got this hunger in us
Momma pray for me, and my young niggas
Ain't no fear in the hearts of these young niggas
Father don't forsake me and my young niggas
We just gotta eat, got this hunger in us
