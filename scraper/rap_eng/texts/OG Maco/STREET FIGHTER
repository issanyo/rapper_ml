[Key!: Verse 1]
Raf Simons, when I walk in bitches gon' remember this
All this fucking money I'm throwing, bitches can't get none of it
I just brought your bitch to the trap house
Okay, we fucking in that bitch like it ain't no trap house
Okay, police can come at any fucking time
Okay, but she don't care she just wanna lose her mind
Okay, its FatManKey I wrote the game
Okay, its FatManKey I took your chain
Okay, I'm humble for the Bentley, not a name
Okay, I'm ballin' like I went to Notre Dame
All this shit we been through, I think we deserve it
I fuck up all the FeFe's on purpose

[Maco Mattox: Verse 2]
Scorpion with the dope I'm like get over there
[?]
Sub zero 30 make a nigga freeze
I'm allergic to them haters swear they make me sneeze
I don't want your hoe I gotta [?]
I get what I want and everything I need
I go ham for that bread, but I don't rap for cheese
I'm a stand up nigga, so she on her knees
Get your bands up nigga 'fore you talk to me
Got them things watching like they found you
Know its snakes in the grass, but they'll never eat
