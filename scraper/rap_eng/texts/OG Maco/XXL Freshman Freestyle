[Verse 1]
We the children of the rage
We the children of the days
We the children of goin' out in a blaze of glory
Hope I don't caught wit' that K, ho
If I do, my homeboy done switch his story
You know how that go
Ay, man, I seen the pick and roll
I seen the give-and-go
I seen my partner give some hoes a little change, you know
They did they thang, but anyway
We the children of...
Ay, where the pain? We need that
We hold that in, you can't see that
But, you know, I been stayin' in France
And, hey, we gon' bring that
Ay, you got the weed, I got the gin, let's mix that
We the children of...
Ay, man, I'm in school, but money a little bit more important
Uh, I think I need to go get this passport so I can keep stuntin' out
Just lookin' for a reason
For me to go and do shit you can't believe in
But, ay, we the children of makin' make-believing
And we the children of makin' somethin' realer than you can see
I mean, I got friends who I can't see
They got twenty years in
I got friends who fifteen years in
They was fifteen years when they went in
We the children of that shit, we the children of this shit

I'm a world star, I got a world star clique
You know what I'm sayin'? We the children of that shit too
OGG, we the niggas that made the rules
We the children of it ain't no new school, we the new school
We the old school, we the one school
Shit, you the two school, you the two fools
It's three fools over there and they ain't nothin' like you
I ain't nothin' like you 'cause you food, you feel me?
We the children of get-real, man, get-pills, get-a-feel
Shit, get whatever you need, but by all means keep it real
Children of the rage, it's OG Mac, OGG
