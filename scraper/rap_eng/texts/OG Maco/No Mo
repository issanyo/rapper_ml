[Verse 1]
Where the fuck is our common sense
All I see is our common sins
Excrement in our testaments
Scumbags is our common friends
No sustenance in these substances
No substitutes, no hindrances
Indifference is our poison
We know our problems make more of them
More money, they more chummy, that fishy shit that turn stomachs
Peace of mind when that check’s signed
Leasing lies to those overviews
And all crowned jewels should be to you
We kill the schools and hide information
Implications of this infestation
Might doom us all, my generation

[Hook]
People don’t feel no more, all they do is bitch
It’s like, people don’t think no more, they just saying shit
It’s like, people ain’t real no more, we robotic kids
It’s like people don’t live no more, people don’t feel no more
People don’t feel no more, all they do is bitch
It’s like, people don’t think no more, they just saying shit
It’s like, people ain’t real no more, we robotic kids
It’s like people don’t live no more, people don’t feel no more

[Verse 2]
Where the fuck is our common sense
We more than dense but far from sonic
Status chasers getting aggravated cause I seen it once then went and bought em
Poor kids making more kids and these rich bastards saying they the problem
With little options they change incentives
And it’s hell praying for a blessing
Chasing pavements like Adele said it
Chasing payments on car notes
Rent due but the ho broke
Y’all loan a nigga these handcuffs, but my credit’s shit so my mortgage dope
We sold pies till it’s time for change
Oh lord it all stays the same
They couldn’t offer us helping hands, like

[Hook]
People don’t feel no more, all they do is bitch
It’s like, people don’t think no more, they just saying shit
It’s like, people ain’t real no more, we robotic kids
It’s like people don’t live no more, people don’t feel no more
People don’t feel no more, all they do is bitch
It’s like, people don’t think no more, they just saying shit
It’s like, people ain’t real no more, we robotic kids
It’s like people don’t live no more, people don’t feel no more
