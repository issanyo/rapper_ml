[Hook]
Got a couple of seconds huh, said I got 15
Seem like I’m a couple of seconds up
I got a couple of seconds huh, nigga
Said I got 15, they said I got 15
Feel like I’m a couple of seconds up
I got a couple of seconds huh
Put your bottles and sections up
That’s what a nigga need
Put your models and flex's up
Just as far as the eye can see
Fuck nigga spot next to you
Play Scar on the Lion King
For me this shit’s more than a hotter verse
Cause I’m watching my niggas ride in the [?] hearse

[Verse 1]
My brother didn’t make it past 15
Wasn’t banging, wasn’t slanging, just a ball player
So how he fucking gone and I’m still here
Ever since, right and wrong, it just ain’t clear
Every song, every second going full throttle
The hate real, but the love fake, that’s the real problem
Got bread, all praise to the mighty dollar
My god, any second away from his problems
Take a couple seconds, see the second coming
I’m ahead of my time nigga
Somehow still ahead of the times nigga
Money just a means my nigga
The problem for the next generation
The extra for the next vacation
Spending paper, I don’t need saving
You don’t want your kids running naked
Waiting on Atlanta niggas' patience

[Hook]
Got a couple of seconds, huh
Said I got 15
Are my couple of seconds up?
Are my couple of seconds up?
Couple of seconds up, they said I got 15
They said I got 15, they said I got 15
Nigga, are my couple of seconds up?
Are my couple of seconds up?
I got a couple of seconds huh, well they said I had 15
Couple of seconds up, nigga, couple of seconds up
Are my couple of seconds up
Sheesh
