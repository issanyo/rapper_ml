[Verse 1: Jay 5]
These niggas on beef shit (they banging on wax)
My niggas on B shit (my niggas some bloods)
They pull up and eat shit
Hundred round drum on the K, might delete shit

[Hook: Jay 5]
Just jacked the price in the city
I feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Just remixed a brick
Flooded my chain, bought my foreign a foreign car
I feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Got so much cash, I might burn that shit
I feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Now my whole gang on that murder shit

[Verse 2: Jay 5]
Woah, woah, these rappers do not want no smoke
Woah, woah, I’m at the show with the showstopper
Just put a new drum on my old chopper
Just left my bitch, I’m a ho-hopper
Eat his ass up like a whole whopper
Heat his ass up with the cold chopper
Skrt skrt, I feel like I’m Pablo
Skrt skrt, I got them bricks in the Tahoe

[Hook: Jay 5]
Just jacked the price in the city
Feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Just remixed a brick
Flooded my chain, bought my foreign a foreign car
I feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Got so much cash, I might burn that shit
I feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Now my whole gang on that murder shit

[Verse 3: OG Maco]
Feel like I’m jefe, golden machete
All of my killers comprende
Spray like confetti, pussy ain’t ready
Spray on your clique in the daily
Fuck up your set, fuck all the pussy niggas
Keep an extra, fuck you and your hitters
Hundred rounds, young nigga spray that shit
Hundred rounds, pussy nigga duck too quick
Feel like I’m Pablo, wrapping them tacos
Send ‘em to Tahoe
Feel like I’m jefe, niggas ain’t ready, chopper too deadly
Shoot at a gringo
Wrist rotate, el niño
Serving that blanco
Two touch down at the front door

[Hook: Jay 5]
Just jacked the price in the city
Feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Just remixed a brick
Flooded my chain, bought my foreign a foreign car
I feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Got so much cash, I might burn that shit
I feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Now my whole gang on that murder shit
I feel like Pablo, no Escobar
Now my whole gang on that murder shit
