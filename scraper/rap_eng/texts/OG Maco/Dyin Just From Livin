[Hook: OG Maco]
I feel like I'm dying just from living
Okay, I go get it that's for my children
And I don't really know just how we winning
But fuck it, we winning, nigga we getting it

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I think it's in my blood like my cells
Sat in a cell by myself
I don't want rich, just the wealth
Closed casket if I walk onto a track, black suit
I'm just thinking 'bout a black coupe
Got some niggas, they in all black too
If we don't know you
Oh God, we don't know you
Cause it wasn't love in the city
Now it's just love in the city
I know some niggas trying to kick it
Don't know that I was fucking they bitches
It's just crazy how we living
Some of my niggas been some victims
So every day I go hard
Man, I know a bunch of niggas and they living too fraud
I'm getting coached by a God
I'm on approach, I'm like God
I'm just spitting fucking rapture
I like gotta get it now nigga
Oyster Perpetual
Patek Phillippe
Oh My God, now I'm praying on my knees
But I got a bunch of faith up in me

[Hook]
I feel like I'm dying just from living
Okay, I go get it that's for my children
And I don't really know just how we winning
But fuck it we winning, nigga we getting it


[Verse 2: Key!]
My little nigga just wanna have fun
How much fun can you have toting a gun?
I'm set in stone, please don't ask me where I'm from
Cause I don't need you trying to tell when they come
Ho, sit down, let me learn you something
Ho, sit down, all that molly got you gone
Ho, sit down, you ain't talking shit
Hold up, sit down on a nigga dick
I got bloods in the cells, I got cuz in the sale
Just because in a sale they won't fucking tell
I got bails, need to sell, my little partners need to chill
They been blowing like a whale, ain't no rap, they for real
It ain't funny I ain't laughing, I ain't boasting, I ain't bragging
Man, it's kind of really sad cause this shit really happened
Not my partner! I just dapped him, how'd this motherfucking happen?
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, that's why I'm playing these niggas like Madden

[Hook]

I feel like I'm dying just from living
Okay, I go get it that's for my children
And I don't really know just how we winning
But fuck it, we winning nigga we getting it
