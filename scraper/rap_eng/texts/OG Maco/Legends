[Hook]
I dare a fuck nigga to talk to me
I dare you to think you can move how bosses move
You lookin' at a legend
I dare you don't get me confused, my nigga
We rebels, so fuck all the rules nigga
You looking at the legends
I dare a fuck nigga to talk to me
I dare you to think you can move how bosses move
You lookin' at a legend
I dare you don't get me confused, my nigga
We rebels, so fuck all the rules nigga
You looking at the legends

[Verse 1]
It's me and Metro making moves like Marvin
If y'all tryna limit, fuck your Magna Cartas
Cuz we living legends kicking as in Sparta
Ain't no sparing sparing,  we just bury niggas
Crept-tivities tracks, murder scene in my closet
If you copped it, I've been bought it
Been bout it, one audi
Fuck it, I don't miss it like my haters
We ain't ask for no favors
I don't wanna talk
Bruh they pigeons, we the hawks
Word of mouth gotta stop
Indifferent to snitching lil bastards
How dare a fuck nigga to let his guns rattle
Want some gun battles, tryna try your luck
How your bitch trash but you so secure
Talking cash, but you look impoverished
Speaking to him tryna share knowledge
We don't know him, anything can happen
Shit like sargents  looking at a captain
At 3 in the mornin' you out like magic
The cops is on us we don't know what happened
Bitch, we indifferent niggas
We've been living savage

[Hook]
I dare a fuck nigga to talk to me
I dare you to think you can move how bosses move
You lookin' at a legend
I dare you don't get me confused, my nigga
We rebels, so fuck all the rules nigga
You looking at the legends

[Verse 2]
Carbon copy of my last car and of my newest one
Always let a ho shoot for somethin'
I was money hungry formulating hundreds
Thinking dividends, spending 20's 50's
Stack 'em Benjamins like we've meant 'em niggas
Here's your dirty money in the dirty duffle
We want all the chip and the extra ruffles
Want a private jet streaming fuck a world up
How I'm here? It happened on the double
Plus it's 6, 12, like 11 or somethin'
Hittin' licks put disposals my brothers
[?] jet [?] lane
Pussy plus I'm as big as a dane
Eat deez grits cuz I'm goin' insane
You can just touched for the link on your chain
Brains mushed from just mentioning names
OGG, bitch it's just me and my gang
Please, fuck Alexander Wang
Maison Margiela just call me names
Niggas fighting over petty change
Bitch biting on me, fucking lames
So I'm just focused on the profit margin
I'm unconcerned unless them commas marchin'

[Hook]
I dare a fuck nigga to talk to me
I dare you to think you can move how bosses move
You lookin' at a legend
I dare you don't get me confused, my nigga
We rebels, so fuck all the rules nigga
You looking at the legends
