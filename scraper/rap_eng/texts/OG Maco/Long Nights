[Hook]
It’s just a lot of long nights
Each one with less sleep
Just the making of a young nigga tryna practice what he preach
Life is like the ocean if I call it how I see cause
Ain’t no one to save you when the situation deep
Better learn to float, never drop your head
Just rest your chin on your hopes
Stop counting your failures and learn to focus on your growth
Try a new approach, achieve another goal
Never be a coward because fortune favors the bold

[Verse 1]
Don’t expect respect because it’s earned, already old
Money meditations, told my mama just be patient
Lord knows she been hurting all them nights, crying and praying
That was [?] locations, validated statements
Out them streets and stages we [?], bitch we made it
I ain’t claim I’m famous, I been saying we working
Niggas still gone hate it but that don’t change it, we deserve it
Damn we got em nervous
As simple as it seems to be a man living his dreams, it isn’t
Things just different where you stand, it ain’t penny pinching
Love turned to hate, pride turned to envy
Sat in silence alone, my niggas swore that they was with me, android 17
Cop some Promethazine, piss dirty, conscience clean
Needless to say, I’m necessary, if it’s real we need
Through my heart pumps the same blood that lions bleeding
Tracks alight with a beast [?] shit to see
Changed brand denim jeans, working pockets, serving fiends
Call the block and corner shopping, I got anything you need
Fathers got mouths to feed
Times change and people don’t
No job, hustling, but I got anything you want
Bitch I got anything, bitch I got anything you want
Ho we got anything you want

[Hook]
It’s just a lot of long nights
Each one with less sleep
Just the making of a young nigga tryna practice what he preach
Life is like the ocean if I call it how I see cause
Ain’t no one to save you when the situation deep
Better learn to float, never drop your head
Just rest your chin on your hopes
Stop counting your failures and learn to focus on your growth
Try a new approach, achieve another goal
Never be a coward because fortune favors the bold

[Outro]
It’s just a lot of long nights
Each one with less sleep
Just the making of a young nigga tryna practice what he preach
It’s just a lot of long nights
Just a lot of long nights
It’s just a lot of long nights
It’s just a lot of long nights
