[Hook]
I said realest flash, nigga, make me
Moving like I'm on probation
Patience, patience
How these women want relations?
Makes sense, makes sense
Dollars always gonna make cents
Shake it, shake tits
Do it like you tryna pay rent
Do it like you tryna pay rent
Do it like you tryna pay rent
Do it like you tryna pay rent

[Verse 1]
I'mma bang it, bang it, baby ratatat
Come at this, I'm a new habitat
Animal, they ain't having that
Elephant [?] your mountain cat
Claw me as you grind grind
Bouncy bouncy upon mine
Tell me as you grind, grind
Told you that you find time

[Bridge]
So pretend that it's your rent
Pretend that it's your rent all night
Pretend that it's your rent
Pretend that it's your rent all night

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't focused on these motherfuckers talking
I hear it often but don't really hear it often
So what you need to do
Is let me touch it cause I'm really kinda needing you

[Outro](x2)
Hands on you, speeding in the coupe
Tail on your anus peeking through
Seat soaking, what the fuck, it's true
Real niggas gonna make a move, move, move
