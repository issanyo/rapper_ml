[Chorus: OG Maco]
I hopped out my big four-four
I worked off my last four-four
I hopped off the porch, now I'm on
I Euro-ed my bread while I'm tourin'
I hopped out the big four-four
Worked off my last four-four
I hopped off the porch, now I'm on
I Euro-ed my bread while I'm tourin'

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
One in three niggas acting like me
Free my migo hombre from the timepiece
Bust through the door like The Shining
My life is a movie, I rewind it
We hit her for the free while you buyin' it
Task on some homies on some spot shit
That thirty on a nigga, don't you try shit
That beam on a nigga, bet he die quick
They scheme on a nigga but don't try shit
I'm at a nigga neck like a tie bitch
I walked out with Rollies with the diamonds
She said that pussy hit, she was lying
Neck neck neck, I'ma skip the sex
Wet wet wet, from my wrist and my fuckin' neck
All my friends are dead like I'm Uzi but I'm with the set
Niggas want that Bentley, feel like Luigi when I park the shit

[Chorus: OG Maco]
I hopped out my big four-four
I worked off my last four-four
I hopped off the porch, now I'm on
I Euro-ed my bread while I'm tourin'
I hopped out the big four-four
Worked off my last four-four
I hopped off the porch, now I'm on
I Euro-ed my bread while I'm tourin'

[Verse 2: Warhol.ss]
While I'm tourin', yeah
While I'm tourin', yeah
In the foreign, yeah
Walked in the bank with my jewelry on me
Hopped out the tank in the foreign money
Frosting my diamonds, she call me Tony
Your lil bitch say she ride me like a fucking pony
Mama I been gettin' money this day
Ain't had no spoon, that boy made a play
And if it's a will, I'm gon' make a way
Ain't been poppin' pills but I elevate
He ain't let me stay, see me ridin'
Free my loved one, [?] that can find me
Ho say she gon' study me just like assignment
Perfect timing, and this ain't just rhyming
I was slimy, lookin' for a check
Condo on my neck, that boy loving blessed
Ain't have no problem since I graduated
Touring the county, lookin' like I made it

[Chorus: OG Maco]
I hopped out my big four-four
I worked off my last four-four
I hopped off the porch, now I'm on
I Euro-ed my bread while I'm tourin'
I hopped out the big four-four
Worked off my last four-four
I hopped off the porch, now I'm on
I Euro-ed my bread while I'm tourin'
