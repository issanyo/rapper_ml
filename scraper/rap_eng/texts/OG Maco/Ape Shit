[Intro]
Yeah Yeah, woo
OGG, woo
Yeah Yeah!

[Hook (2x)]
Bout that money we go monkey
Bring that drama we go ape shit
Got bananas on a forklift
King Kong on the same shit
Bout that money we go monkey
Gorilla glue, how the gang built
Find a girl, we go ape shit
King Kong on the same shit

[Verse 1]
Bout that guala, we ain't hear nada
Grab the llama make it spit some lugies
Bring some beams like its Call of Duty
Red dot, leave a nigga blue-ish
Bought the Phantom we forever ready
Road running like I'm Richard Petty
Wrap 'em up and put 'em in a hamper
Bunch of rappers got me living rebel
Now I'm rapping living like a dealer
My bitch amazing, something like Caine
That explain why she so conceited
I'm a zombie,  I just love the brains
I'm a cannibal, I love to eat 'em
We the wild tribe habitat
Take 'em up, flip it, get a sack
Pull up [?] to my youngins say yeah yeah!

[Hook (2x)]

[Bridge]
Bout that money we go monkey
Bring that drama we go ape shit
Got bananas on a forklift, yeah
Bout that money we go monkey
Bring that drama we go ape shit
Got bananas on a forklift
King Kong on the same shit

[Hook (2x)]

[Verse 2]
From the 3 raised in the congo
Just them drums like a fucking bongo
My provider help me get the bundles
Live life, all we know is hustle
Had a way but we used to struggle
Get a spot, then we raise the bar
I'm the type to get it in the car
I'm the type to fuck her in a foreign
Four rings like I'm Brady Jordan
I'm the champ like Mohammed man
Hit the work with the wrist game
Shouldn't have mentioned what that bitch name
I was sorry when the folks came
They got out there and we had the ammo
Pull up loaded bustin' at the bando
[?] like Marlon Brando
God damn
