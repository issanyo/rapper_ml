Play with that K

[Hook]
Play with that K
Bullets be looking and stalking him
Get shot in your face
Erasing your shit like a fucking grin
I be out the way
That money, that money be coming in
I be out the way
That money, that money my only friend

[Hook]
Play with that K
Bullets be looking and stalking him
Get shot in your face
Erasing your shit like a fucking grin
I be out the way
That money, that money be coming in
I be out the way

Play with that K

[Verse]
My P shipped them P’s, now we got ‘em in, I’m full off the stage
Them titties reserved for them niggas 'em, get hit in your face
Them bullets they buzzin’ like bees again, I play for the way
Fuck all that bottom, up under shit, bitch I need my ends
Your dime getting wet like a swimming V, but she wanna dance
If she fuck the gang, I got her [?], bitch you don’t adapt
She seen the color and she know the pyramid, it’s just how we live
Play with the gang and we spray at kids, play with that K
Play with that K
I be out the way
I be out the way

[Hook]
Play with that K
Bullets be looking and stalking him
Get shot in your face
Erasing your shit like a fucking grin
I be out the way
That money, that money be coming in
I be out the way
That money, that money my only friend

[Hook]
Play with that K
Bullets be looking and stalking him
Get shot in your face
Erasing your shit like a fucking grin
I be out the way
That money, that money be coming in
I be out the way
That money, that money my only friend
