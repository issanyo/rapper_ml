[Intro]
Shut the fuck up, the young god is in the fucking building
Yeah, OGG, live life, yeah

[Verse 1]
Pussy niggas won’t try us, bad bitches gone hype us
Young G on my Tyler Durden, OGG is like Fight Club
Your bitch hit me for a back rub, it was a front to smash in that bathtub
Tired of smoking this budded gas so I hit my Gs in the hash club
Niggas hating hard cause they know they soft
We taking off, getting mad love
Came a long way from them school days with no books and a bag of drugs
Cause I learned the game then changed the game
Then changed my name and stayed down like concrete in a hurricane
Wrist work till that bitch hurt, fist first when that drummer lurk
[?] bout it and my [?] closed and I been real since my mama’s birth
Mindset where the money at, beat made by my nigga Curt
Fist first when that drummer lurk, bout it, bout it when [?] closed
And I been real since my mama’s birth

[Hook]
Same niggas I came with, same niggas I bang with, sheesh!
Same niggas I came with, same niggas I’m getting change with, OGG!
Same niggas I came with, same niggas I’m getting change with, sheesh!
Same niggas I came with, same niggas I bang with, OGG!

[Verse 2]
Atlanta stand on my chest, lemon haze in my lungs
These niggas don’t have no check I checked em, looking like bums
Zone three where I’m from, Atlanta lane where I started
My sack right and I been trill, I’m a real G, no performance
Haters growing like fungus, road running, getting bunions
OGG on that touring shit if you smart you know we the dumbest
Success my only option cause these niggas out here opping
But you’ll never catch me lacking, I ain’t lying, I ain’t talking
I ain’t bragging, maybe stunting, if you mad when you hear this
Get some money, acting crummy, fucking dummy
Imma do it all for my team, nigga live life, no dream
Sit with my team, dreams, we OGG, live like [?], sheesh! sheesh!

[Hook]
