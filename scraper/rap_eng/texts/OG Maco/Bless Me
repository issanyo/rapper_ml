[Verse 1: ]
I'm on the penthouse floor, but I've been here before
When I was dreaming about a cover shoot, with covers on [?]
I mean they thought they pick a lot to do, like we had [?]
I'm just shooting this shit with God, like they think it was [?]
Spraying blessings in all directions, like they think I'm the pope
I'm on the world tour, with Migos the fam
After each and every show, a couple of dykes in the van
Hey I'm working to be a leader, can we try and command?
(Bless me)
Man, I know that God gon' test me, went at a high cost, got a life invested
(Bless me)
Man, I know them broads gon' test me, fuck her and leave her alone
[?]

[Outro]
Bless me [x8]
