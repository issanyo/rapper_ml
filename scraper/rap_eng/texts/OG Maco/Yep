[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Easy peasy lemon squeezy for a reason
I been eatin' since I been growingTempur-pedic
Ain't the safest season cause it's getting cold
Hypothermic might describe my flow
Hypodermic how my word hit hoes
See a bunch of yeses, rarely catch a no
He ain't got a guess it, I'll tell you so
It's paper on me like I'm still in school
I'm famous now, at thirty still in tune
I never change, there ain't no misnomers
Yep, I'm seeing dope, be by brought it home
Young is 40 with me, no it's not a loaner
Smoking California on the way to Dallas
Yes I'm hot, no I'm not trying to balance
Packing beats and I'm killing with malice
Yep I'm on it and I'm doing damage

[Verse 2: Rome Fortune]

Either way your bitch is wet though
Never mind now see in time
We them niggas I don't think we slept on
Either way, wake 'em up, shake 'em up
Take the bumps, don't get stepped on
Yep, yep, yep, huh
It's on her lip, lip, lip

Semen she sip, sip, sip

But I love that shit

Don't get a grip on this
