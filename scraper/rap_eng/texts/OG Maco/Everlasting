We are everlasting
We are everlasting
We are everlasting
We are everlasting

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Man I’m fashion, factuality
Fuck a fairy tale, I survived hell
Hell you mean, me and you similar
Same situation, dismemberment
OGG, G my niggas eat but the future’s lacking
Lacking membership
It’s trouble come with these bitches
Nothing left for these niggas hating
Who told us to wait later
Beat the odds like this beat
Me and ET God in your speakers
Speak only when spoken to
When money talks, you get real mute
Like a screenplay back in 22
Fuck an era, this timeless
Watch face got no hands
Due to circumstance, had to circumvent
Turned turbulence to a flight plan
Had a red eye with that red beam
You wouldn’t understand, talking five deep
In a minivan with that deep dish and a 30 clip
Partner sweating, you can see us smelling
He’ll let it blow and let the lab catch him
Head case, dodging fed case, let the bread bake
Young gods of the future greats
In the present tense sounding heaven sent
New apostales, Michael [?]
Singing praises, hymns
Gold piece with a couple gems, made a couple them
Everlasting bitch

[Hook]
We are everlasting
We are everlasting
We are everlasting
We are everlasting

[Verse 2: Zeus Trappin]
Ooh, they thought we was gon fall off
Hell naw, no fadeaway
Young god with them dreads and that ten fade
Fade a nigga if he play with my cash flow
All about that money, you know that money maker move faster
Bolt like Usain, wardrobe like Colgate
This glow is everlasting man, the paper chasing after me
You struggling just to get it while it’s coming to me naturally
Casually, hey
I’m like god to these niggas
Looking up to me, I’m the star to these niggas, hey
I’m like god to these niggas
Looking up to me, I’m the star to these niggas, OGG

[Hook]
We are everlasting
We are everlasting
We are everlasting
We are everlasting
