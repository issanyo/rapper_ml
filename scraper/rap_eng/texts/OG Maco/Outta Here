[Hook]
We with the fuck shit, finessin' we outa here
Sippin' this shit in my cup 'til I'm outa here
Rollin' this gas bitch, I'm, I think I'm outa here
Got damn
We with the fuck shit, finessin' we outa here
Sippin' this shit in my cup 'til I'm outa here
Rollin' my gas, bitch I think I'm outa here
Got damn
It's a dirty game
I'm countin' them dirty hundreds
And I'm sippin' dirty
But the shit clear
Yeah, yeah
I'm outa here

[Verse 1]
Look in my cup, it's on purple like Barney
Probably gon' catch this, I'm growin' reluctant
YSL on that bitch, V if she stuntin'
Holsters on me like I'm having a monster
They know I'm the Kraken, they know I'm the monster
I remix it up so I triple my dope
Quadruple your money, you not really stunting
I got what you want and I'm plotting a hundred
It's OGG bitch and we gone off the regular
We ain't fuckin' with no fakers
Real paper when you see 'em
Better nigga; I'm a genie, yeah yeah
I'm makin' three wishes yeah I'm gettin' money
We winnin', we winnin', my niggas keep stuntin'

[Hook]
We with the function, finessin' we outa here
Sippin' this shit in my cup 'til I'm outa here
Rollin' this dab bitch, I'm, I think I'm outa here
Got damn
We with the fuck shit, finessin' we outa here
Sippin' this shit in my cup 'til I'm outa here
Rollin' dabs bitch, I'm, I think I'm outa here
Got damn
It's a dirty game
I'm countin' them dirty hundreds
Sippin' on dirty
But the shit's clear
I think I'm on to some'
Cause I'm outa here

[Verse 2]
Deuce in my dope
Foreign bottles, gotta add it, pour up the driver
I remix and profit them dollars, I preface my convo with guala
Wifey and daughters get slaughtered
Like 21 Savage done taught em
Boolin' with 42 monsters
Blood and a crip and a somethin'
That food come in trucks like we sponsored
Gas comin' in by the bundle
Lower numbers make 'em ponder
My hoe a shooter and a gunner
Your hoe a eater and a cummer
You know I only know one language
Let a nigga talk, understand Danish
I know what he sayin'
I do numbers like the Matrix
Nigga comin' back home from the cages
I greet em back home from the states
Laughin' like how you still hate us?
Told him no one did no favors
Got it by earnin' and takin'
Got it by packin' them sacks in the back of the basement
Comin' back from destinations with vegetation, while I'm sayin' my graces, hallelujah
My departments are savin'
Do 'em dirty like the Falcons and Ravens
And I hurry, I been lost all my patience
Cookin' ends and the work shit is crazy

[Hook]
We with the function, finessin' we outa here
And sippin' this shit in my cup 'til I'm outa here
Rollin' this gas bitch, I'm, I think I'm outa here
Got damn
We with the fuck shit, finessin' we outa here
And sippin' this shit in my cup 'til I'm outa here
Rollin' this gas bitch, I'm out here, I'm outa here
Got damn
It's a dirty game
I'm countin' them dirty hundreds
And I'm sippin' dirty
But the shit's clear
I'm out here
