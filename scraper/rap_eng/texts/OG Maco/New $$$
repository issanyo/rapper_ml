[Hook]
New money, same girl as last season
They know I’ma, your girl know me from a tumblr
And I might touch her, we can feed you all the Ms
We call this new money, new money
New money, same girl as last season
They know I’ma, your girl know me from a tumblr
And I might touch her, we can feed you all the Ms
We call this new money, new money

[Verse 1]
Been the future since Marty McFly
Back then they didn’t love me
Back then I was riding round with them tools fam
I’m back man, and I’m black man
Niggas say I look like batman
If you know that shit then you a real fan
You probably knew I’d blow to this
C4, syntax, line scale, pro step, pro move, pro tip, never went through nets
Step it up, level up
Work your move, January said I’d kill the summer
Tom Merrello gave a nigga Vine
Fan base growing, smoking weed to us
Know these others got some pressure in em
OGG they get to breathe through us
[?] in a Prius, now they in the dopest [?]
And it came straight from Pablo, I’m with extra tired
Can you fill my gas up, this a work of art, I’m a god
[?], kicking shits, I just squash the beef
[?] the beat, fuck em fuck em fuck em OGG
But it’s MMG

[Hook]
New money, same girl as last season
They know I’ma, your girl know me from a tumblr
And I might touch her, we can feed you all the Ms
We call this new money, new money
New money, same girl as last season
They know I’ma, your girl know me from a tumblr
And I might touch her, we can feed you all the Ms
We call this new money, new money

[Verse 2]
And I’m at it again, what the hell he gone do next
Best bet go all in and shut the fuck up
It’s part planning and it’s partly luck
Best believe in your damn self, I been thinking wealth since them [?]
Goddamn we been plotting plenty
See the lot was empty now we built a house
Accent with that Fendi couch, where your bitch sat with that pretty mouth
She don’t talk a lot, got tall tricks
Man Hollywood, I’ma dump shit
And the heels kicking like it’s Kill Bill
The [?] got the real deal
I ain’t got it fast cause I’m so god bodied
And like every party I’ma get it started
I’ma deck the game, I'm like Leonardo
I’ma leave this shit departed, I was training for it
When I wrote the murder, I was aiming for it when I mixed your melon
Barely thank the lord and thank you, blessed
But still I feel as though they want to test
They make me take em down, and fuck the hesitation
From a drummer, born and [?], we gone vegetation
Where the gualas homie?

[Hook]
New money, same girl as last season
They know I’ma, your girl know me from a tumblr
And I might touch her, we can feed you all the Ms
We call this new money, new money
New money, same girl as last season
They know I’ma, your girl know me from a tumblr
And I might touch her, we can feed you all the Ms
We call this new money, new money
