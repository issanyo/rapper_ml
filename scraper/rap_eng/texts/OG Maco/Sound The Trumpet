[Verse]
I need it now I'm a lone shark
I made my own, I'm a lone wolf
I got that pack on me right now
Vacuum bags, you'd never know
Everything so good, I'm so high
Everyone up, prices so low
Ship 'em then flip 'em, they come and go
Yellow wrist, fuck a rose gold
A bitch at my house drinkin' Ros√©
She's in my presence, she gon' learn the lessons
I'm the one talkin' 'bout it though
Nine on me like I'm Gordy, ho
Six on me like I'm Bill Russell
I'm so amazed how the bills double
Put a number on it for the trouble
Put a comma on it with the hustle
And the llama better not move a muscle
Flyin' the bales if you purchase somethin'
You buyin' or sellin' or tellin' somethin'?
I'll stunt on my haters to cause a problem

OGG! OGG!
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em yeah yeah!
Woo! Yeah yeah!
South south south side!
Captain! OGG!
