[Hook]
Lotta of niggas wanna hate on me
What's the reason nigga who knows
Say I'm focused on the wrong shit
We just putting out the new dope
Yeah yeah, oh lord, god willin'
Yeah yeah, oh lord, god willin'

[Verse 1]
God willin' these drugs in me
Lines looking like white Jesus
Catching bras from your favorite neices
Spend your pay on these time pieces
I'm Ye nigga, I'm coca√≠na
Kill the world with my father features
Wrist working, no Father feature
Ball so hard that shit James
Same black mask ain't shit changed
Old friends hating like D. Wade
These niggas sus like Chris Bosh
All up in my biz ass, [?]
I found twelve bricks and you found a god
Schooling every nigga, he forgot his broad
Everything lit to the streets dog
And your team food like Meatwad
All these motherfuckers bit my shit
Got turned to when they come around
Altar altar, that scripture sound
Tryna stop my prayers but I'm preaching now

[Pre-Hook]
Lotta of niggas wanna hate on me
What's the reason nigga who knows
Say I'm focused on the wrong shit
We just putting out the new dope

[Verse 2]
God willin' these thugs with me
But they only thugs 'cause they skin black
Lord knows I was loving me
Cause I gave it out and didn't get it back
Momma prayed that I leave the trap
Now I'm trapped in my own mind
Pops taught me just take naps
'Cause niggas sleeping get passed by
Laughing at niggas from the past
Laughing at haters from my present view
I was sleeping on city blocks
Back then they was hating too
I don't wanna talk
I can't act like we cool neither
I don't wanna walk
And you can't ride, ho nigga this a two seater
Shooting birds instead of desert eagles
If it's colder, must've seen a freezer
If it's boulder got Movado on it
They say the devil still want some [?]
And these boots should have Prada on 'em

[Pre-Hook]
God damn, lotta of niggas wanna hate on me
What's the reason nigga who knows
God willin', yeah yeah!
