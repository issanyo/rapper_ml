[Pre-Hook 1]
I’m from the darkest part
Of the darkness heart
And I don’t know no love
I don’t know no love
I’m from the darkest part
Of the darkness heart
And I don’t know no love
I don’t know no love

[Pre-Hook 1]
I’m from the darkest part
Of the darkness heart
And I don’t know no love
I don’t know no love
I’m from the darkest part
Of the darkness heart
And I don’t know no love
I don’t know no love

[Hook 1]
She don’t care about love
She don’t care about you
She don’t care about you
She don’t care about trust
She gon’ lie to you
She gon’ lie about you

[Bridge 1]
Out of all of the cities, all the bitches fucking with me
There's you, there's you
Out of all of the cities, of all the bitches fucking with me
It was you, why baby you

[Pre-Hook 2]
I’m from the darkest part
Of the darkness heart
And I don’t know no love
I don’t know no love
She from the darkest part
Of the darkness heart
And she don't know no love
She don't know no love

[Hook 2]
We don’t care about love
We don’t care about you
We don’t care about you
We don’t care about trust
We gon’ lie to you
We gon’ lie about you

[Bridge 2]
Out of all of the cities, all the bitches fucking with me
There was you, there was you
In all of the cities, of all the bitches fucking with me
There was you

[Interlude]
Dark, dark, dark, dark
I’m from the dark
Dark
Dark

[Verse]
Pardon no part of me, I still be talking godly
Mars, Zeus, Poseidon, god of water
Round me deserve more than they ever bought me or brought around me
Hiding effort is never bothered by common comments
Harder work and it’s spitting sicker and then vomit
Fuck your bitches and act like J’s heroin is pointless
Jon Bon Jovi, it’s somethin’ and then they try to clone it
Black Phil Collins, a black heel, steel red bottoms
Nothing stops ya and my dick is like a turbo option
I’m a drug and she a buyer and it’s mental more than ever
And it’s really really love this time
That’s if I let it
And it’s really really good this time
That’s how she tell it
Told shawty make her pussy get wetter and make you hit it
I think I might just stay for a while and return visit
I’m plotting on something bigger
I’m thinkin’ ‘bout ten Novembers, I’m colder than ten Decembers
Know that I’m winning
The money made me laugh, it’s all

[Outro]
The money made me laugh, it’s all
The money made me laugh, it’s all
The money made me laugh, it’s all
The money made me laugh, it’s all
The money made me laugh, it’s all
The money made me laugh, it’s all
