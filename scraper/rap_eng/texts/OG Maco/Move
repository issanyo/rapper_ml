We’re all moving here
We’re all moving here

We’re all moving here
With our hands up
We’re all moving here
With our hands up
We’re all moving here
With our hands up
We’re all moving here
With our hands out

And we’re born again
When the beat drops
And we’re born again
When the beat drops

We’re all moving here
We’re all moving here
We’re all moving here
When the beat drops

We’re in love again
When the beat drops
We were born again
When the bass drops

We’re all moving here
We’re all moving here
We’re all moving here
With our hands up

We’re in love again
When the beat drops
When the beat drops

Yeah, yeah, we’re all moving here
We’re all moving here
We’re all moving here
When the beat drops

We’re all moving here
With our hands up
We’re all moving here
And we can’t stop

No no no, no no no
And we can’t stop
We’re all moving here
And we can’t stop

We’re all moving here
We’re all moving here
We’re all moving here

We all move (talk, talk)
We all move
We all move (talk, talk)
And we can’t stop (talk, talk)
