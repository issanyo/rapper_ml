[Hook]
Hey, don’t be acting like I don’t know
One thing that I don’t know
Nigga I don’t know you
Wait, don’t be acting like we don’t know
Only thing that we don’t know
Nigga we don’t know you
Nigga we don’t know you
Hey, don’t be acting like I don’t know
Only thing that I don’t know
Nigga I don’t know you

[Verse 1]
This shit is getting way more private
How the fuck you even make it on the island
I ain’t even got a suit for the fuck boy
Throw his ass off the plane, I’m the damn pilot
Just because the ho sell it, you ain’t gotta buy it
On the low low, nigga they ain’t speaking hardly
That’s if we even speak around you
Every time we’re talking money you don’t speak about it
I don’t even find it out ‘cause it fit you
I don’t even get even ‘cause it fit y’all
We avoid all the rubbish, said we need space
But you never hear from us ‘cept for lift off
Counting hundreds and the twenties got me pissed off
You would never make it in but your girl might
Tell her suck my dick hard, back soft
Know I got some missed calls, got ‘em pissed off

[Bridge]
Wait, don’t be acting like I don’t ball
Hey, girl [?] told me that we all gods
Wait, lord knows we them boys, we don’t know y’all
Wait, lord knows we them boys, we don’t know y’all

[Hook]
Hey, don’t be acting like I don’t know
One thing that I don’t know
Nigga I don’t know you
Wait, don’t be acting like we don’t know
Only thing that we don’t know
Nigga we don’t know you
Nigga we don’t know you
Hey, don’t be acting like I don’t know
Only thing that I don’t know
Nigga I don’t know you

[Bridge]
Wait, don’t be acting like I don’t ball
Hey, girl [?] told me that we all gods
Wait, lord knows we them boys, we don’t know y’all
Wait, lord knows we them boys, we don’t know y’all

[Hook]
Hey, don’t be acting like I don’t know
One thing that I don’t know
Nigga I don’t know you
Wait, don’t be acting like we don’t know
Only thing that we don’t know
Nigga we don’t know you
Nigga we don’t know you
Hey, don’t be acting like I don’t know
Only thing that I don’t know
Nigga I don’t know you
