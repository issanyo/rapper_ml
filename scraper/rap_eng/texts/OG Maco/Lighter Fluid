[Verse 1]
I won't place your raise
I won't wear the shades but look at my eyes
I'm just learning shame and guess who to blame
The same ones I despise
I'm severing ties, sponse
If I just ponce this in closest
Like the heroes who listen to Moses
Think your Jesus, man, life is the coldest
Well it's better with fox on your shoulder
All these knots and this case fuckin' bogus
Hope the hopeless turn pain into joy
Give your soul every time you record
Lose a friend every call you ignore
But you don't know what they around for
Current situation far from average
I mean, I just bought all the balance
I mean, I don't look at the talent
Just get it for wifey and thank you, daddy
Just seein' this shit kinda violent to us
They seein' the hate so enlighten to it
If all these words got some power to 'em
Feel my flame, life is lighter fluid

[Chorus]
And y'all gon' ask for pennies, y'all gon' ask for pennies
Runnin' from these woes
And y'all gon' ask for pennies, y'all gon' ask for pennies
Not for fucking years
I been looking out, I been looking, oh
I been looking out, they wanted me to fall
And y'all gon' ask for pennies, never ask for pennies
Not for fucking years
And y'all gon' ask for pennies, never ask for pennies
Not for fucking years
