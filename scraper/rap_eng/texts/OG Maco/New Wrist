[Verse 1]
Workin’ bad, workin’ bad
Soft ass, fuck a tag
Just came from Badland
Jugg, do the band dance
Counting since a young man
Fountain on the wrist fam
30 in the clip, damn
Spray it off the hip, damn
Work the block, serve the block
Counting cash like a bakery
Spot hot, spot hot
Cause a snitch nigga told on me
Hundred bands, hundred bands
Work the pot, break the pot
Hundred bands, hundred bangs
Trying break a nigga hand
God damn!

[Pre-Hook]

Get the bags, get the bags, ay
New pot, new wrist, ay ay ay
New skrt, new bricks

New pot, new wrist
New pot, new bricks
New wrist, new pot
New skrt, new drop
