[Hook: OG Maco]
I’m talking big bucks, I ain’t wasting time on you little fucks
I’m talking we all good, and we wish a nigga would so we all could
I’m talking big bucks, and I ain’t wasting seconds on you little fucks
I’m talking we all good, and we wish a nigga would so we all could
I’m talking big bucks, and I ain’t wasting seconds on you little fucks

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
God damn!
It’s more money than complaints, it’s more having than we ain’t
That’s bout all I know
The shit’s real, every day another show
Ten racks down, ten more to go
I’m so good with pacing
And my songs stay in your head cause I’m so good at lacing
But my songs stay in your heart cause you know I’m not playing
I got no love for a peon, we all start from greatness
Triumph my fucking fragrance

[Hook: OG Maco]
I’m talking big bucks, I ain’t wasting time on you little fucks
I’m talking we all good, and we wish a nigga would so we all could
I’m talking big bucks, and I ain’t wasting seconds on you little fucks
I’m talking we all good, and we wish a nigga would so we all could
I’m talking big bucks, and I ain’t wasting seconds on you little fucks

[Verse 2: Offset]
Big bucks
Chopper hit a nigga, nunchuck
In the trenches, got my crumbs up
Made a million nigga, thumbs up
Got the pistol, tryna come up
Looking for the nigga, where he at?
Just bought a Porsche, it’s a hatchback
Recording how I move like SnapChat
I’m a mummy, tryna get the hundred million commas
All these bitches want to fuck a nigga
Fuck them bitches, Imma fuck they mama
Pull up in the drop top Hummer
Flexing, all the diamonds on my necklace
Bitches looking at the fucking Bezel
Meek Mill nigga, different levels
Flintstone, I got fruity pebbles
She tryna get my money, I won’t let her
Can’t fuck her every day, my busy schedule
Rockstar, I got heavy metal
I got you popping like a fucking kettle
Maison Margielas, fly with no feathers
Cooking up the dope like it’s Hamburger Helper
You a dirty bitch and your mama a heifer
I take off her clothes and I give her a physical
Offset, he got riches, a fucking miracle
Hit him with the chopper, send him to medical
And these bitches treat me like I’m superior
Don’t run up on Migo Gang, my niggas serious
Leave a pussy nigga bleeding like he on his period
Shot that nigga, throw him in the river
Now they looking for him, everybody is curious

[Hook: OG Maco]
I’m talking big bucks, I ain’t wasting time on you little fucks
I’m talking we all good, and we wish a nigga would so we all could
I’m talking big bucks, and I ain’t wasting seconds on you little fucks
I’m talking we all good, and we wish a nigga would so we all could
I’m talking big bucks, and I ain’t wasting seconds on you little fucks
