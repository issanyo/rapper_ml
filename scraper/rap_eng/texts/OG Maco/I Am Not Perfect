[Intro]
Tired as fuck
The show must go on
One monkey ain't stop no fucking show
OGG
QC

[Verse 1]
New McLaren vision, pain created wisdom
All this game I give can help create a better system
With just slight assistance sledges make a mighty difference
Ferrari spider, picture the dealers tryna add the fixins
I'm the best that's getting, bar none service missing
On a monstrous mission, haters like that Gollum creature
Victory is short distance, millimeter never inches
Took my pot to piss in, whip it till it change consistence
Forever stay persistent just to make my haters feel it
Big bundle in the skinny so the pockets fit it
Mommy got drugs in her titties, hope they don't search her
Heard a nigga talking reckless she like, "Don't hurt him!"

[Hook]
I am not perfect, hits coming back to back like the trap serving
Think below the surface
I was out here working, now I'm out here winning
Live from the trenches feeling like a war victim

[Verse 2]
Audi A7, perfect time to get it
Niggas tried to chuck my CDs like they playing discus
I never falter, slightly alter, but the same description
Counting digits from the scale, mail and classic pictures
In my last minute figured that I passed winning
I just pass niggas after (Emmetts?) leave em frenzied
Tryna make a Mach 5 doing monkey shit
Wet sign getting covered but I never slip
South side where they bred us and we never dip
Know some youngins lost their lives before they ever lived em
Revolution take a leader but I ain't no fucking pilgrim
If they cross you kill em, just be ready for that sentence
We don't do cold defendants, trust in god and not these niggas

[Hook]
I am not perfect, hits coming back to back like the trap serving
Think below the surface
I was out here working, now I'm out here winning
Live from the trenches feeling like a war victim
