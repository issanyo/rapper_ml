[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Taking aim, I'm 'bout the clipboard
Lot of hoes, they think I pimp for it
I hold the forty so I limp for it
Oh you wanna hang with the big boy?
Shoot you in the face, take your lip boy
I do not swag, I drip boy
My bitches is bad, eating shrimp boy
Feel like Birdman on the fifth floor
I'm winning, I'm winning, I feel like Floyd
Your bitch's sister got 'em too annoyed
Pull up with chopper, mission abort
I pop a xanax to teleport, ooh
The bitch is so cheap, no she can't afford
The dick she receive, yeah I charge her for it
Fill up the ho, give her [?]
I pull up Ferrari, don't park the car
Bitch I'm on fire like a Charizard
I just want to come and feel on your body parts
Baby eat me just like I am an alley cart
Give her the tip, I ain't talkin' no Alley Boy
Alley cat, I'm out in Cali with Bali boy
Rev the guns up, I'ma start up a rally boy
Everything I got on is real valuable
Told them niggas free smoke is available
So when I see 'em I hit 'em the attic

[Chorus: OG Maco]
I'm built for it (shit)
Rifle rounds in my clip for it (rah rah)
F&N on my hip for it (shit)
You die about it, I live for it (fuck 'em fuck 'em, yeah yeah)
I'm built for it (shit)
Rifle rounds in my clip for it (rah rah)
F&N on my hip for it (shit)
You die about it, I live for it (yeah yeah, bitch)
Yeah yeah (shit, shit, fuck 'em fuck 'em, yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (shit, shit, fuck 'em fuck 'em, yeah yeah)
I'm built for it (huh?)
Rifle rounds in my clip for it (rah)
F&N on my hip for it (shit)
You die about it, I live for it (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
I'm built for it, I'm built for it, good for it
Pull up on you in a foreign
With bracelets looking gorgeous
They say they want heat, I'ma scorch it
Pistol rounds fire like some charges
Fly nigga, I been soarin'
Young nigga, yeah I feel important
Yeah, I got my fuckin' chopper, I been rollin' with them big dogs
All these niggas pussy, they some hoes, they some pussies, pause
I been getting money with my gang, we don't fucking fold
For nothing, for nothing, for nothing
I ain't worried 'bout nothing nigga
I just went and got me a coupe
Maserati with the coupe, getting money with the juice
Ayy, saucing on 'em with the juice
Swear these niggas they some fruits
They take my sauce, they so poo
Yeah that ain't nothing new

[Chorus: OG Maco]
I'm built for it (shit)
Rifle rounds in my clip for it (rah rah)
F&N on my hip for it (shit)
You die about it, I live for it (fuck 'em fuck 'em, yeah yeah)
I'm built for it (shit)
Rifle rounds in my clip for it (rah rah)
F&N on my hip for it (shit)
You die about it, I live for it (yeah yeah, bitch)
Yeah yeah (shit, shit, fuck 'em fuck 'em, yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (shit, shit, fuck 'em fuck 'em, yeah yeah)

You die about it, I live for it (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
