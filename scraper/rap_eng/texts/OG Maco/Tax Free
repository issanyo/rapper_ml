[Verse 1]
Gaining all these riches from my nigga intuition
I was standing in the kitchen rolling joints on the dishes
Ditching class, waste tuition
Made two inches selling uppers and prescriptions
Took fruition from a mission that ain't have a memo
Shit, I was saying I would blow before I had a demo
And my temple got a tempo, I was stealing beats
And my rental got some bitches, I was stealing freaks
From the same motherfuckers think you wanna be him
I ain't ever had a reason, niggas steady reachin'
Now I just count a ten on those current evenin'
Count the same damn amount round breakfast time
All this shrimp and grits better than your mama's cookin'
Me and Pablo on a mountain, how they overlook us?
We be in our own lane, still overtook 'em
We the leaders of the new and you ain't know you lookin'
Crystal ball seen it all, we the last of us

[Hook]
Charge it all to the game at a flat fee
Tell these taxing ass niggas this is tax free, bitch

[Verse 2]
Got a white girl sniffing coke in a black mink
Her best friend giving head in the backseat
Got her rich white daddy thinking "Why me?"
I'm just tryna make a movie like Spike Lee
She just wanna be good in the hood, huh?
All she gotta do is make the mouth good, huh?
There's a new protest, new demonstration
And it's no contest, no conversation

[Hook]

[Outro]
Gaining all these riches from my nigga intuition
I was standing in the kitchen rolling joints on the dishes
Ditching class, waste tuition
Made two inches selling uppers and prescriptions
Took fruition from a mission that ain't have a memo
Shit, I was saying I would blow before I had a demo
And my temple got a tempo, I was stealing beats
Tell these taxing ass niggas this is tax free
