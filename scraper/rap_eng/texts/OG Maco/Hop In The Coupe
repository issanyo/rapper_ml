[Intro]
Hop out the coupe
Hey Jay Rich
Hop in the coupe
Hey man
We just keep winning nigga
Count up, ayy

[Chorus]
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, hop in the, hop in the, hop in the coupe
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em

[Verse]
I'm in the loop
Minor suckers, money counters, you can't even wrap in your head around it
Big dogs in the coupe, [?] goop, do the dash with the feds around 'em
I been mobbin' with my troops, I been lobbin' shots half court through the roof
I been gettin' new juice, ooh ooh
Make a nigga scared to lose, ooh ooh
Got your bitch wanna fuck, she pullin' up
Got me countin' that pronto
Pounds of paper with the fire too
Copycats at the front door
She come slide for a nigga, she stand in line for a nigga
Switch the ride every season
Handle that, handle that, handle that, handle that, do the dash
Do the dash
Hop in the, hop in the, do the dash
Hop in the, hop in the

[Chorus]
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, hop in the, hop in the, hop in the coupe
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
Hop in the coupe, do the dash, count a ticket and swerve on 'em
