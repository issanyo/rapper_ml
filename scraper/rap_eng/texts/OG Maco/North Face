[Hook]
My youngins
My savages
My riders
This for my young niggas wearin' and livin', don't grow up
My youngins
My savages
My riders
This for my young niggas in True and nobody know

[Verse]
This for the young and restless
This for the young and savage
They take it away in Heaven
The money is under captian
The money is under mattresses
That money is in my wall
Got the gas in my right sock
Holster in my drawers
Red room, Boulevard
From the flat to the 9
Youngins runnin' with a pack
Shoot 'em down with a AR
Teach a lesson like a seminar
We cookin' rhymes, let the water boil
That's some cold if you want some more
Scrape the pot, get the extra dope
Where we're from ain't no extra hope
Niggas gon' get it and take from you
Youngins and bitches, they wait for you
Move on decisions, you cold case
Choosin' is pimpin', you know this
[?] she gon' bitch
On the Gram in the North Face
Ice on me like a cold case

[Bridge]
Ice on me, need a North Face
Ice on me, need a North Face
Ice on me like a cold case
Hundred rounds, I don't need aim
Ice on me, need a North Face
Ice on me like a cold case
Hundred rounds, I don't need aim
Hundred rounds, I don't need aim
