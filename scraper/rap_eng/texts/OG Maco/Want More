[Chorus]
Gave em hustle, struggle, pain from me, now they want more
Go through the rain, I survive the flames, now they want more
Give em self till there's nothin' left, now they want more
Seen rich but I need wealth, now I want more

[Verse 1]
Choppin, choppin, it's like Vietnam, smokin' Napalm
Livin' days, I ain't slept in days, hit the the fourth one
Everybody think their waterproof till the storm come
Make it rain, hundred dolla' bills a hundred round drums
Pull the rage and I'm out the cage, when I'm on the stage
You can see the savage, pocket watchin' just like field hands
Fuckin' peon tryna count the cabbage
Fuck you talkin' for if I ain't ask it?
Arky smilin' but bitch I ain't laughin'
Let you call me on my bank root
All them commas, that's a real hoop
Still thinkin' bout the black coupe
It's a P1, top see-through
If I ain't top five it's 'cause I'm top two
You prolly thought it was a year or two
Bitch you guessed it, now they want more
Competition, fuck the competition
Never slippin', I'm like golf soles
Hole-in-one but that's on every song

[Chorus]
Gave em hustle, struggle, pain from me, now they want more
Through the rain, I survive the flames, now they want more
Give em self till there's nothin' left, now they want more
Seen rich but I need wealth, now I want more

[Verse 2]
I got a feelin' but theres nothing in
All this profit gotta be a sin
Euros too, stack a million yen
I don't trust bitches with a million friends
She just watchin' homie, she just plottin' on me
Feelin' tensions, why you actin' different?
Poppin' bottles, just a young nigga
Nineteen order 20 Hens
Had to give the money to my man
Told 'em then 'bout the masterplan
Just the otha day he understand
We'll kill em with the truth
Broad day no mask on
A young 'n scary children of the corn
Bunch of niggas raised with winter storm
Pimpin pimpin sippin sippin neva cookin cookies
Got yo feelins trippin listen listen
There's no pencil
Drew it up without a stencil
In the pistol with the read option
Couple scrambles, now I'm outta pocket
Heroin and music, watch it rock me
I'm a star like my new Givenchy, on that topic where is Erykah
Tell Badu I wanna touch her, just confessin', I ain't Usher
Teachin' lessons, no professor, bobble ratchet on my dresser
How you gon' do it? Say you want more!
How ya gon' prove it? Workin' workin' Im in overtime
Clockin' in, nigga, grab a scale
Be a starter how you run the pie
Put in work on your birthday

[Chorus]
Gave em hustle, struggle pain from me, now they want more
Go through the rain, I survive the flames, now they want more
Give 'em self till there's nothin' left, now they want more
Seen rich but I need wealth, now I want more
