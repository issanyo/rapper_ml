[Chorus: Warhol.ss]
Hide up on the porch, baby wraith me
I can see no label wanna bank me
Shark up in the water, you some bait, B
Throw the brick on burger, ho come taste me
Baby fiendin' for this wood, ho come face me
If you really want me, ho come chase me
Workin' through these trenches, I'm like eight feet
I'm gon' do the dishes, ho come plate me

[Verse: OG Maco]
Fuckin' on your bitch, and the shit hittin'
And the bag lit, it's a freak pit
Sucker-free dick, need free red chips
Rich bitch, break the pussy down, tune it up
Take a free trip, baby make a porno yeah
Or a lead tip, she a freak yeah
When my niggas can't we do
[?] put the fat cattle dick too
Garfield, tried to [?] on her heart still
Don't care about your broad or the last till
Caught her on the street, can't you see the nat real
Caught him with the beamer, feelings make him feel real
Shawty work the DF4 like the red tips
Ford Focus, fuck the bullshit, it's only bread things
Counter full of dead things
On the cell ring
Yeah it's Mister Mac, yeah like Mister Bell Ding

[Chorus: Warhol.ss]
Hide up on the porch, baby wraith me
I can see no label wanna bank me
Shark up in the water, you some bait, B
Throw the brick on burger, ho come taste me
Baby fiendin' for this wood, ho come face me
If you really want me, ho come chase me
Workin' through these trenches, I'm like eight feet
I'm gon' do the dishes, ho come plate me
