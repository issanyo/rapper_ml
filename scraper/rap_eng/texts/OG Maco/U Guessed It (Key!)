[Verse 2: Key!]
I bought my bitch a Birkin Bag so she could hold my fuckin' strap
That bitch be heavy in my pants and I don't even like to sag
I'm going hard, I'm going hard, sniffin' out the fuckin' plate
My momma tried to make me dinner but I already ate
These bitches lyin', I seen the molly in her eyes
Plus, I made the play, huh
Ball, Matt Ryan, hey
I can't eat no breakfast, fall asleep in intersections
Stole a Smith and Wesson, I hope he's a pedestrian
ManMan, lay low in the dip
When you see him, let it rip
When you hit him, boy, let's dip
Amalfi Coast, let's take a trip
I'mma call me a singer, I'mma make her pack, her bag
I'mma send her ass there, but I ain't gon' send her ass back, aye

[Hook: OG Maco]
Bitch, you guessed it—HOO
You was right
Bitch, you guessed it
Grahhh, grahhh, fuck-nigga on sight
Bitch, you guessed it
Still in that place and I'm flexin'—HOO
Bitch, you guessed it
I'm still with my niggas, come and test us
O.G.G
