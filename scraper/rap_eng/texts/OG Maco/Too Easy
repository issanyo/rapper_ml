Too easy the task that girl gone fuck cause I'm NU

Wanna f**k me fuck me cause these ho’s in Cahoots

That b***h calling me babe cause ever bar off the roof

Wit my goons & dat s**t tru

Dat Too easy (x5)


Meeting yo maker going right in
Money be greener she hopping right in
Feeling like Cameron I'm dipping set
I took his bitch cause she know we collect
Diamonds on teeth, Diamonds be wet
Smoking that s**t, have me tapping my chest
That bih from hills den send her the jet
Sometime at my worst gotta feel like my best
Living a life where we getting no rest
Spanish mamì wanna f**k off baguettes
Had her f*****g & looking, I hit from the back
That bitch acting moody get right or I jet

Chanel tag had her panties to front
Take the team out to LA I sponsor the brunch
Gotta code wit my n****s, to keep it on hush
Gotta stay wit the team cause we taking it from
Caught a case in the east but I took & bond
Learning these lessons & take it & run
Rock out the show pop a blue like tum
Hit a bih in the hills wanna f**k cause I buzz
I'm mixing and missing prescription that shit keep me up
Nowadays fixing my luck aside the bullshit still counting it up

I might f*ck yo ho, but its too easy
Wrap and ship the blow I sold a 3 piece
All my mini me's acting greedy, If I didn't pave the way it wouldn't be a present
Beat that case and thank God for my blessing
I took couple losses but they lessons
These n****s talk weight but they been flexing
I got some mob ties down in texas

Get it how I live I got babies but no kids
Heard the coppers near Im'a jump right off the grid
Never had a fear, now I'm legend I'm Revere
Love me, yeah I’m feared
Ain’t no faces like a beard

Too easy the task that girl gone fuck cause I'm NU

Wanna f**k me fuck me cause these ho’s in Cahoots
