[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I come from the city, really it’s titties and titles
And semis and rifles and jugging and swiping
Doubt you’ll see a penny without it
No pity, no love for a plotter
Winning with tons, I’m gon’ swallow hollows, follow haters
Send souls of diablo, rifle toutin’, niggas’ll tackle
Niggas want more chains than Harpo, burning [?] blocko
We don’t know you, you get stunt on
Like sets for the movies, some pay for coochie
We hittin’ on strength of the groupie
Groupies based on profit, probably from looting
Looking for the bosses, they barely past 20
Drinking choice the hennessy, hittin’ beefed up my frenemies
Button, my graves say they digging me
Finagle sentences
Comprehensive contradictions, said generally
Smoking gas, I smoke no kindling
Hot-lanta, literally
Plus these Georgia Scorcher memories dwindling
Benihana’s where the dinner be
Mahi-Mahi before Follies, probably cop a couple bottles
Feds watching for darkest niggas spraying witness, corporate to your holster
And niggas get Porsches on credit, they get indebted ‘cause they can’t afford ‘em
Yeah yeah

[Hook: OG Maco]
I come from the city
I can tell you but you gotta see it
I come from the city
Just money, motives, and a bunch of envy
I come from the city
I come from the city
I come from the city
I come from the city

[Hook: OG Maco]
I come from the city
I can tell you but you gotta see it
I come from the city
Just money, motives, and a bunch of envy
I come from the city
I come from the city
I come from the city
I come from the city

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
T, that’s the motherfucking hometown
41-6 what I hold down
Honey Cocaine how the dope sound
Hundred gin with 28, there’s a whole pound
Riding down, riding down your street
Bitches getting killed over dumb beef
Out in Rexdale I’m a raffle
Then I’m back uptown, I’m a Bun B
Pour a side of [?], niggas call me chi-chi
Bitch I’m from Toronto but I’m smoking on the BC
Arm and the rim treads sitting like I’m BC
Hating on me ‘cause your money shorter than it need be
I been on the block since a minor
I done moved wops for some diner
This right here is a reminder
Fuck with my money, the Honey will find ya

[Hook: OG Maco]
I come from the city
I can tell you but you gotta see it
I come from the city
Just money, motives, and a bunch of envy
I come from the city
I come from the city

[Hook: OG Maco]
I come from the city
I can tell you but you gotta see it
I come from the city
Just money, motives, and a bunch of envy
I come from the city
I come from the city
