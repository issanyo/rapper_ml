[Hook]
As long as scales work, can't worry
As long as there's work, can't worry
A nigga going hard for the learnin'
A nigga spent a whole night servin'
As long as scales work, can't worry
As long as there's work, can't worry
A nigga going hard for the learnin'
A nigga spent a whole night servin'

[Verse 1]
I got another phone, still workin'
We never talk on phones on purpose
We had to switch it up, get drastic
We fall and the stick bomb plastic
The club's full of drank and it's active
My niggas got the full metal rackets
I'm countin' eyes closed, countin' backwards
We flow like VVS' on them bastards
Got the four and it's active
There's a whole lot of pussy niggas cabbing
We went and grabbed a scale for tax
We spraying shit first, bail after

[Hook]
As long as scales work, can't worry
As long as there's work, can't worry
A nigga going hard for the learnin'
A nigga spent a whole night servin'
As long as scales work, can't worry
As long as there's work, can't worry
A nigga going hard for the learnin'
A nigga spent a whole night servin'
