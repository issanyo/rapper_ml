[Intro: OG Maco]
Ayy man, it’s OGG, yeah
New Money Gang, yeah
Mm, hold all the conversations
Hold all the conversations
Mm, pussy nigga

[Hook: OG Maco]
Ayy, who got the clout?
Fuckin’ your hoe and she in and out
Talkin’ that shit ‘bout a nigga but
You ain’t nothing that we talk about
Who got the clout?
Who got the clout?
Them dollars come in and out
Them hundreds come in and out
Fuck is your clout?

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Uno the act and OG Mac bringin' it back
No you can't touch it bitch, you just a wrap
You  gon' pull out the cup, put your head in your lap
Nigga try racin' but they ain't gettin' laps
Bitch you a buzzer, I won't get your dial
Bitches gon' fuck me, I get all the clout
I dont say nothin', I'm in and I'm out
Show no remorse, you niggas pussy like just like I be [?]
.55 shotty gon' rip through his torso, his body get 'torted, it look like a [?]
I'ma pull up in that Porsche then niggas be lookin' like Dora the Explorer
Diamonds clear, what do you afford?
Why do you think I'd be mad at you for?
We got it, niggas they want it if we ride it
I'ma pull up in a big body, if I ain't got it then he got it
Niggas they mad, they look at my diamonds
They talkin' they speakin' to everybody
Chopper gon' hit 'em, his body gon' flip and it's lookin' like he doin' gymnastics
Everything I got, he want it, thinkin' I might put a fee on it
Pull up, big car with a B on it, everything I do, see monkey
This little bitch, she peep all my shit and then she start to get naked
Hold on lil' ho you need patience, then she started to give facials

[Hook: OG Maco]
Ayy, who got the clout?
Fuckin’ your hoe and she in and out
Talkin’ that shit ‘bout a nigga but
You ain’t nothing that we talk about
Who got the clout?
Who got the clout?
Them dollars come in and out
Them hundreds come in and out
Fuck is your clout?

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
Running these bird bitches, feel like I’m Wiley
I’m dressed in Rick Owens, I’m styling
Smoking that loud on the mountain
I’m probably with Pablo, I know that we count it
Far from Nick Cannon but I’m with your ho and she wylin’
We out here, she ‘bout it
You is a lame with them smiles
I’m skipping detention and countin’ them Benji’s
I’m going monkey, go see me
Banana clips sitting right by the window sill
Lil bitch tryna come fuck me, she feeling lucky
Fuck the gang ‘cause she know the deal
Never pump fake, shoot to kill
I was in the in the field like some cleats
I was working all goddamn day tryna make a nigga some’ to eat
Bitch in the kitchen, feeling better
Qualitest got a nigga feelin’, off a bean
Hurricane, monsoon, cyclone
When the motherfucking wrist spin
When your bitch came home, no panties on
You knowing where the bitch been
Rolex shining like some headlights
On a dark night out in Michigan
Your diamonds dirty like some Flint water
My diamonds dancing like Lil Meechie taught ‘em
I’m making plays like a damn sale
Your bitch sniff ‘em like it’s good for her
Cooking beef like it’s good burgers
Sliding on you in that old suburban
Face wrapped in a dirty turban
Sending shots like I’m fucking searching

[Hook: OG Maco]
Ayt, who got the clout?
Fuckin’ your hoe and she in and out
Talkin’ that shit ‘bout a nigga but
You ain’t nothing that we talk about
Who got the clout?
Who got the clout?
Them dollars come in and out
Them hundreds come in and out
Fuck is your clout?
