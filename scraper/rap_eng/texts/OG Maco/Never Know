[Intro]
I just spent a fucking check (Never know)
I just met her and got some neck (Shit never know)
Do they know how much I ball on em ? (They will never know)
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
I just spent a fucking check
What's the total? Shit I never know
I just met her and got some neck
What's her name? Shit I never know
Do they know how much I ball on em?
Hell nah they will never know
Ion move till the money come that's the thing you better know

[Hook]
Shit I never know
I never know
Hell nah

Never know
Shit I never know
Shit I never know

[Verse 1]
I don't spent more then ya momma and them
Had your girl call me Big Poppa like I'm B.I.G and she with it like Lil Kim
Just left New York for another show
I forgot how much I just counted
No accounted I may never know
Niggas bitching like they gotta [?]
Fuck it man they forever hoes
Just a born to the bullshit piece it together and bounce shit
Rapping niggas get the vanishing where they go? You will never know
Young police brought up my amnesia telling 12 they let me go
I was in shows for Rick Owens
I be with models you wishing for

[Refrain] x2
I just spent a fucking check
What's the total? Shit I never know
I just met her and got some neck
What's her name? Shit I never know
Do they know how much I ball on em?
Hell nah they will never know
Ion move till the money come that's the thing you better know

[Hook]
Shit i never know
I never know
Hell nah
I never know
Never know
Shit I never know
Shit I never know

[Verse 2]
Might look at my ice and get brain freezes don't ask me the cost it was nothing to me
I forgot it when the bands clap i forgot you when our hands dapped
Fingers itching can't forget the feeling
Blooded money count it after clean it
Dirty weapons when it's robbing season all black even if they see it
No description no they never know
It was just me and the gang
I don't care about the fucking fame I just want to get the money up
I don't care about these fucking lames they don't know how far we plan to go
We was plotting we was eating they was hating for no reason
I just might grab up your main bitch I might just give her what she wants
I said the shit these niggas won't
I do the things these niggas don't
Yeah yeah
How i do it they will never know
Everybody talking but they ain't got nothing to show


[Refrain] x2
I just spent a fucking check
What's the total? Shit I never know
I just met her and got some neck
What's her name? Shit I never know
Do they know how much I ball on em?
Hell nah they will never know
Ion move till the money come that's the thing you better know

[Hook] x2
Shit I never know
I never know
Hell nah
I never know
Never know
Shit I never know
Shit I never know
