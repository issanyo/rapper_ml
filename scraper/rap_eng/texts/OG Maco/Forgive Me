[Hook]
I feel the devils in the air
I sin again and say my prayers
I sin again and say my prayers
Father forgive me
Father forgive me, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I don't mind being restless
As long as a nigga can't best this
Should I put the world on my checklist
Must have some nerve or a death wish
How I don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
My statements bringing me statements
And I'm so loud on these stations
Can't even hear who been hatin'
The greatest foe was standing in the mirror
Doubt will stop you but regret can kill you
Get wounds in seconds, only time can heal 'em
You hearin' music, now it's time to feel it
Never sold out and just sold out Philly
I was eating phillys living in my Honda
Tummy full of nothing 'til the money counted
Switching numbers when the calls are cloudy
I was spittin' lyrics to whoever 'round me
I envoke whoever just had to doubt me
Whenever, wherever, I never faltered
I felt so assaulted, that's why I revolted
Now it's Revolt live with the cameras on me
Give the game my all but it never owned me
I been sleeping less and eating less
Teaching more and reaching more
No handouts, bitch we reaching goals

[Hook]
I feel the devils in the air
I sin again and say my prayers
I sin again and say my prayers
Father forgive me
Father forgive me, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord

[Bridge]
The devil's in the air
I sin again and say my prayers, yeah
I sin again and say my prayers
Father forgive me
Father forgive me, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, no no

[Outro: OG Maco]
Pray, pray, pray every day
Pray, pray, pray every day
