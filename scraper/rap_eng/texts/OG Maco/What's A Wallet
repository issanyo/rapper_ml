[Hook]
What's a wallet, lil bitch
I got a pocket rocket, lil bitch
And that guap all on a nigga like some scabs, oh
These knots all on a nigga like them racks though
So what's a wallet, lil bitch
I got that pocket rocket, lil bitch
And that guap all on a nigga like some scabs, oh
And them knots all on a nigga like them racks though

[Verse 1]
What's a wallet?
I got my Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada
I took one trip out to the states and lost 'em
I took one trip out of the states and lost 'em, yeah yeah
Your bitch she awesome
I fucked that ho, her friend, I had a foursome, yeah yeah
Living awesome
I brought my niggas with me, Dennis coughin', yeah yeah
Spending often
I walk in Rick and niggas know I'm ballin'
I spent [?] money and I think it's nothing
A nigga stuntin' since two thousand somethin', yeah yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Now what's a wallet?
What's a wallet, lil bitch
I got that pocket rocket, lil bitch
Lil bitch, yeah yeah

And that guap all on a nigga like some scabs, oh
These knots all on a nigga like them racks though
So what's a wallet, lil bitch
I got that pocket rocket, lil bitch
And that guap all on a nigga like some scabs, oh
And them knots all on a nigga like them racks though
