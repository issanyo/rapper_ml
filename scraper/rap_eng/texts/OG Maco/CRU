Now your bitch know it, now you see her choosing

[Verse 1]
And we so finesse, you know we keep the bitches choosing
Niggas see me and I’m groovy, I be looking like a motherfucking mogul if you see me
Couple racks sitting in these jeans uh, mhm, yeah yeah
Thought I did the shit by myself, it was OGG
Sitting in the cabin, smoking on the cabbage
And I know these niggas smoking babbage
And I got a bad bitch, you had her, I have it
And you said you smashed her, you lying, I smashed it
It's tragic, man it’s like a tragedy

Sitting with my niggas, they some rulers
And we got them rulers, don’t make my niggas do ya
