[Verse 1]
As if I don't know why your face so blank
Bet a real nigga try to tell you what it is
You was standing screaming, "No the fuck it ain't"
Why the fuck you can't? Why he never will?
Funny cause those same conversations got a young roadrunner laughin' straight to the bank
And I ain't got beef, 'less its bread on my head don't mistake the situation
Say you got hittas, bout it boys,  real hittas ain't tweeting with location
Put in work, did vacation, pouring out
Liquor for my niggas lord knows that they should've made it
And I don't like niggas screaming "Live life" when you living life like a pussy
Green dot goals gettin' sent to my niggas lord pray they keep on pushing
Pray I keep moving, know I keep it thugging
Fuck a hater nigga man I never seen them niggas cause they never seen nothing
Never felt my pocket, same niggas plotting
Same niggas with her now standing at the motherfucking ending like "We did it!"
But we ain't even made it, I'm just getting fucking faded
Belaire Rose and I'm sipping on this shit like "Mm this tasty"
Man I swear I can taste it
Looking at this money man, motherfuckers swear I had to chase it
Now I sit on my couch and I'm, pushing hits out like the bitch who been
Fucking these niggas she met on the road
Bitches at my house they want alarm codes
But I don't know you

[Bridge]
Now its love in the city, where the love in the city?
Motherfucker, we don't owe you
Motherfucker, we don't owe you
Bitch wiggle, we don't know you

[Verse 2]
Sipping Belaire Rose
Talking to your bitch about foreplay
And I bet she know where the gang stay
And I bet she know where the gang hang....gang bang
Got my nigga, running behind me with TRAP buckets on he look like Chief Keef saying bang bang
Call a nigga back, call this shit a hit
And I don't need no motherfucking plaque
Get the fuck off my dick
Got a fuck nigga sick
O-G-G, man they shining
You the same bitch nigga
Yeah the same lame nigga
Motherfucka just whining
