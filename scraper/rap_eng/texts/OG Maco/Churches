[Verse]
I got angels with devilish features
Harpies geekin on narcotics, coughin' coughin'
Backless dress so I can nut on her spine
Super squirrely, she got nut on her mind
Wanna fuck me just a couple of times
Pitter patter, why you jabberin' ho?
You know the way it go
Fuck you mean take it slow?
You know I can't waste a minute
Seconds adding in this sentence
I just fuck her until she's numb
Why the lil bitch in her feelings?
OG Mac been in her kidneys
She spin on my dick like a frisbee
Heard that you fucked her for the digits
I'm just food for her soul
She come to Mac to get replenished (Mhmm)
Pretty picture, paint her with my pride
Pretty pussy got a winner smile
And I did it right, word to Devin Loud
Niggas quiet 'cause we making noise
Golden boy, Oscar or Floyd
Holy shit, we in the field
At Lenox lootin' like I'm Sly Cooper
Ratchet with me, make a clank
What the fuck he think
Telepathic how I read 'em
If they don't join us, we'll beat em
Couple thoughts locked away
Young nigga freed 'em, young black Jesus
Making profit preaching wisdom to sinners
Beginning ending, just like Christmas
Young and gifted minus manager
Make 'em love me with my anger
Every song another banger
Wild as fuck, they'll never tame him
Murder murder murder, bet they blame him
(Mhmm, yeah yeah)

[Hook]
I got angels with devilish features
Harpies geeking on narcotics, all from chasing profit
I got anger problems, I be tweaking
But everyday is like the weekend
Mhmm, yeah yeah
