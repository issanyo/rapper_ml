[Hook: OG Maco]
Bitches see the bag, and they can't wait to meet you
30 in my Mack, so don't you think that's an issue
Paper in my pockets, like I'm saving tissue
Bitches see the bag, and they can't wait to meet you
30 in my Mack, so don't you think that's an issue
Paper in my pockets, like I'm saving tissue

[Verse 1: PACkmaN]
I'm on the stream, making a skeem
Diamonds and lean, under the bed
Bring in the beam, making the beans
Travis hit me up, got the tool in his sleav
Get the reefer for like three, for real
Look at how much lean I got up in my jeans
What am I gonna surv the feends
Cream and paper like a leef, sheesh

[Hook: OG Maco]
Bitches see the bag, and they can't wait to meet you
30 in my Mack, so don't you think that's an issue
Paper in my pockets, like I'm saving tissue
Bitches see the bag, and they can't wait to meet you
30 in my Mack, so don't you think that's an issue
Paper in my pockets, like I'm saving tissue

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
30 in my pockets, so don't fake diss
Fucking with my team, your mob goin miss
30 in my pocket, man, at all times
You can tell I'm ballin, man, I'm known to shine
Diamonds dripping on me, they're water blue
No street cred, we ain't heard of you
15 hours in the cartell
17, man, I had them bricks for sail
At 19, I was moving truckloads
While you was still in school, on them bus slopes
I was cutting class, just to sell the gass
I had to fuck with her, she had that big old ass

[Hook: OG Maco]
Bitches see the bag, and they can't wait to meet you
30 in my Mack, so don't you think that's an issue
Paper in my pockets, like I'm saving tissue
Bitches see the bag, and they can't wait to meet you
30 in my Mack, so don't you think that's an issue
Paper in my pockets, like I'm saving tissue
