[Hook: OG Maco]
How you say that you real, but you never in the field
How you say, how you say
How you say you gettin' hoes, you the only one that chose
How you say, how you say
How you say, you a boss but can't take no days off
How you say, how you say
How you say, you livin' life but you never moving right
How you say, how you say

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
You probably told her everything
She told me everything
I mean on everything
How you say, these niggas actors
They porcelain plaster
All the deception
They just with the flexing
I'm stronger than wrestlers
Your bitch can't inhale it
No sneak in my message
This song for fuck niggas who never clutch weapons but talk with agression
God is you addressing?
So niggas don't hate you, they hate you
You really can't stress it
She seen me, I fucked her, she loved it
I never do extra
You minding the extra
He said that he famous, you know I'm [?], he got it
Said he on top in the city
If he flop 'cause he blowing some blessings
Believe it, these workers confused
You got rank in the streets but you never paid dues?
You call her a ten, but the bitch is a two
She had a twin, that bitch be a boot
I never speak to her, you choosin', you losin', you callin' her boo
Double up, you gotta double down
Double cup then my mind drowns
Put the trigger on the four pound
Why you sayin' you don't let it spray, have to lay him down
Double up, you gotta double down
Double cup then my mind drowns

How you say, how you say

[Verse 2: Quavo]
How you say that you a boss
And you never took a loss anyway?
How you say that you trappin'
You don't have customers to serve every day
Forgiatos on a highway
Quavo Carlito it's my way
I had to kick her out the condo
To the back of the bus like Andre 3000
I'm dabbin' in sauce and I need to put in 1000 islands
Money pilin',  walking it like in the car hit the gas from a mileage
Gangsters only move in silence, that's why I hit her with the silencer
Quavo, tommy gun, John Dillinger
I make her whip up and get rid of her
I'm spillin' lean on my chincilla fur
I take of the fur, then show off the burr
You tellin' me that you been in the field, but you not a shooter
Fake Steve Kerr
