[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I'm good for it
Another tatt, and I'm too hood for it
Another fact, well I'm too forward
Too bored with that four door so I lost two
Too lit with a few whores so I lost you
Red carpet got Goyard-ed and the old block got Bogart-ed
The new school like Professor Charles'
Charlie horse, tryna run this bitch
Move around until we breaking shit
Bring it 'til they can't take that shit, constipation
Everything good 'til the conformation
Final hour, no one man should have all this
Never thought that while watching power
Everything move how we say it do
Everything move how we say it will
Everybody speak when we tell 'em speak
And any nigga said you get the insta-kill
Old soul, old money flow
Got a young nigga talkin' instant mils
From those instant meals, in his instance here
I'm the best that's real, the real best is dead
The real world's a lie, your real friends is fakes

[Hook: OG Maco]
Shine shine
Don't you worry
Lose your fucking mind
Enrage
Shine shine
Don't you worry
Lose your fucking mind
If god
Is my religion
Pray my children
Major winner
And if war
Is my religion
All my children

[Verse 2]
I can't be stuck in the trash
Bitch I'm a lion, be quiet
This riot inside of my life
I ain't got no love for 12
Stand on my words 'til I die
They killing my people outside
And wonder why niggas so wild
Look at what you dishin' out
A product of power, the scale tipping now
Tripping on rolls, hard to look at us now
Triple my heart and my soul
I been on go since I hopped on the road
Niggas been hoes so I already know
All of they features gon' leave you exposed
Daddy he gave me the game as a boy
Keep that shit solid, I can't give no more
Give you all that I got 'til I even the score
But that ain't enough so let's buck if it's war
Call it however you want
All of this straight from the jump
Throw us in cages, they can't block the son
Shining so bright, I'm the one
Knowing is only the half
Watch what the boy gon' become
If you ain't here for the wave
Only advice is to run
You cannot run from the vibe
Sick of that bullshit, I'm tired
Heard all your work, boy you lied
Crab it up but he still tried
You cannot get up this high
You just not built for it, you won't survive
Hippy my flag, oh my god
Hope you enjoying the ride
No pressure, I swear that I'm fine
Lift it with ease, keep my eyes on the prize
I beat the states in disguise
They cannot stop me, they tried
The boy just too hot, I'm on fire

And if war
