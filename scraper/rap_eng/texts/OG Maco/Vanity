[Hook]
I got hate in me
I got love, I can't trust, so it stays in me
But it's breaking free, feel it changing me
I'm just maintaining me

[Verse 1]
I feel lost to me
I was scared, I was lost, it was hard to me
I'm a ghost, I'm what's left, of the past of me
I can't live like this
I would kill to miss
Can we find some bliss

[Pre-Hook]
Woahh ohhh
You're not on your own
Ohhh woahh
You're not on your own

[Hook]
I got hate in me
I got love, I can't trust, so it stays in me
But it's breaking free, feel it changing me
I'm just maintaining me

[Verse 2]
I feel broke and sold
Feel I'm lost in the cold, Is this hope in me?
This how it suppose to be?
I've been wrong enough
I can fight for the weak cause I'm strong enough
I was dying just from living, now I'm breathing for us

[Pre-Hook]
Ohhh woahhh
Ohhh you're not on your own
You're not on your own
You're not on your own

[Hook]
I got hate in me
I got love, I can't trust, so it stays in me
I got love, I can't trust, so it stays in me
But it's breaking free, feel it changing me
I'm just maintaining me
I'm just maintaining me

[Bridge]
This is more than life
All this darkness in the world, we deserve some light
If these hearts unite
They will fear us, you will see it, in the coldest eyes
Don't believe the guys
Finally rely on that voice inside

[Pre-Hook]
Ohhhh
You're not on your own

[Hook]
I got hate in me
I got love, I can't trust, so it stays in me
But it's breaking free, feel it changing me
I'm just maintaining me
Ohhhhh

[Outro]
I got hate in me
It in me
I got hate in me
I got love in me
Love in me
I got love in me
I got drugs in me
(Will it dispose of me)
(So it stays in me)
Is it changing me?
Is it changing me?
Is it changing me?
Is it changing me?
Ohh, ohh ohhh, aohh aohh aohhh
Ohhhh, ohh, ohhhhh
