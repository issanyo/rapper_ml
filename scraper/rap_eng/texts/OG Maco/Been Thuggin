Money on my mind, lethal weapon on me
We just kicking shit, thugging with my homies
Bitch we been thugging, bitch we been thugging
Bitch we been thugging, bitch we been thugging

[Verse 1]
Bitch you been hustling, making money
Money counter going (ooh, look at the money)
Tryna get a yacht, cruise the ocean
Bunch of young niggas coming out the slums hundred round drums only
Bunch of bags Imma get em, time to time to put em on with the homies
Put em in the closet, put em in the shell
Under the dog house, where the fucking digging
Do you under underdig me? Do you understand
Bitch you been thugging, got a master plan

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2]
Been listening to Thug, we all came from nothing
We came from the slums, bitch you been drumming

In the bluff, with the strap, I ain’t by myself
OGG we getting it, trap sure is on my chest now
Bunch of blocks in the chest now, on my god we can’t rest now
