[Intro: OG Maco]
Hey, hey
OGG!

[Chrous: OG Maco]
Some of my niggas gone work
Some of my niggas just take
All of my niggas been trill
None of my niggas been fake
10 toes, stay down
Trill all in my background
10 toes, stay down
Trill all in my background

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Some of my niggas got checks
Bunch of young niggas getting kicks
Don't care about the rest
That's the work, A1
Working from the morn' to the dawn
We don't really need no rest
Bet we got drugs for the stress
Maybe we ain't living popular
Second love mentioned
Now they're registered
Sack regular, pac premium!
If he pee or sumn
Bum nigga go get flee or summ
I'm raft now with McQueen on me
Fake love, fuck fake love
[?] told me spit straight slugs
So it's automatic, hundred round drum!
OGG over everything!
Swear to God I got one love!

[Verse 2: Key!]
Some of my niggas take work
All of my niggas is working
None of my niggas is hurtin
That's for certain, I swear it
All my niggas gone merc him
Hot sauce, nigga gone work him
Run off with the pack we gone work him
The bitch keep lyin it ain't working
Boolap, boy you know they too strapped
Real talk but they ain't even rap
I seen it with my own damn eyes
He ain't lying when he sayin Two-9
I know he got him on it right now
I bet he got him on it right now
Shh, pipe down
Shh, pipe down
Q-70 with the killers and the drug dealers
We the drug dealers and the killers with it nigga
OG Bobby Johnson
I'm on a nigga conscience
I can hear him thinking out loud now
He ain't really gonna say it when i'm around
He go shh, pipe down
He go shh, pipe down

[Chorus: OG Maco] x5
Some of my niggas gone work
Some of my niggas just take
All of my niggas been trill
None of my niggas been fake
10 toes, stay down
Trill all in my background
10 toes, stay down
Trill all in my background
