[Hook 1]
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Girl, bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce with it!

[Verse 1]
All you gotta do is move your hips now
Baby, bounce them cheeks like you laughing
If the music too low, turn it up loud
Can you do it on my pole like I am Magic?
You better move it 'til you sweat, then faster

[Hook 1]
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Girl, bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do

[Hook 2]
Bounce with it
Shake, shake, baby, do what it do
Shake, shake, shake, bounce with it, bounce with it
Shake, shake, baby, do what it do
Shake, shake, shake, bounce with it, bounce with it
Shake, shake, baby, do what it do

[Verse 2]
You too young to be actin old fashioned
I'm tryna fight for some change like Cassius
My trees stank if you smoking real gaseous
It don't matter where you from, Palace or pasture
You better move it 'til you sweat, then faster

[Hook 1]
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Girl, bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do

[Hook 2]
Bounce with it
Shake, shake, baby, do what it do
Shake, shake, shake, bounce with it, bounce with it
Shake, shake, baby, do what it do
Shake, shake, shake, bounce with it, bounce with it
Shake, shake, baby, do what it do

[Bridge]
Girl, I like it when you do what you do
Going crazy when you shake it, make it do what it do
Girl, I like it when you do what you do
Going crazy when you shake it, make it do what it do
Girl, I like it when you do what you do
Going crazy when you shake it, make it do what it do
Girl, I like it when you do what you do
Going crazy when you shake it, make it do what it do

[Hook 1]
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
Bounce that ass to the beat

Girl, bounce that ass to the beat
Show me you a freak, make it do what it do
