For my dough
Got to be making these moves like pronto
Cause they be on our moves, get off bro

That is known to make it big as fuck without a thing

[Refrain: OG Maco & Rome Fortune]

[Verse 2: Rome Fortune]
I said these motherfuckers they don't know shit
I said the world is hella big and I got several bitches
I said these motherfuckers they don't know shit
I said the world is hella big and nigga hella digits
I'm talking zero, zero, zero
We all belong to G-O-D
But I find it hard to believe
That you can find more in a liquore store man
But you can't find it in your brother's soul
I said, makes sense
Let a nigga know
Do I make sense, let a nigga know
Do I make sense, let a nigga know
So I got to make it loud
