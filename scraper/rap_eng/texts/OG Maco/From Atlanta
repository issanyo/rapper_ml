[Intro]
Yeah
It's OG Mac
It's splurge day you feel me?
Rest in peace [?], damn

[Chorus]
I'm just a young juggin' nigga from Atlanta
I take care my Fanta, hoes think I'm handsome, ask 'em, yeah
Yeah, shit
I'm just a young juggin' nigga from Atlanta
I take care my Fanta, hoes think I'm handsome, ask 'em, yeah
For real, look

[Verse]
Live life shawty, call me [?] shawty
Uncle hit me kid kid eight, nigga hold a forty
Big Glock shawty, lil mac shawty
I went OG Mac, still had to get my patch
Road run, road run, map get 'em shawty
X hit my phone, said he need to make a fifty
Tryna give a nigga 'bout a whole new twenty
Over lil semi, niggas think it's pennies
Nigga I done count a hundred thousand when I wasn't rappin'
Seventeen years capping
Nigga never seen a nigga 'til I made it fuckin' happen
Remix like some fuckin' magic
Niggas change their number just to get a number
Niggas gettin' tickets for [?]
Bitch you fuckin' guessed it, I just made a million
Everything I do, I swear I really lived it

[Chorus]
I'm just a young juggin' nigga from Atlanta
I take care my Fanta, hoes think I'm handsome, ask 'em, yeah
It's OG Mac
I'm just a young juggin' nigga from Atlanta
I take care my Fanta, hoes think I'm handsome, ask 'em, yeah
Yeah yeah
