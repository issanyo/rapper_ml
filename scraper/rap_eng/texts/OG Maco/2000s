[Intro]
Why you talkin’ crazy when you know what’s up?

[Hook]
Screaming gang gang, that was early 2000’s
Only clique of niggas in the dorm serving houses
Screaming gang gang, that was early 2000’s
Bunch of red beams coming out of blue houses

[Verse 1]
Only gripping hundreds and the car got mileage
Only at your city when the telly say it’s rowdy
Five AM on the corner, bodies dropping
Talking on a nigga and you quick to change the topic
If you don’t just talk around fuck it they’ll pop you
Roll around Houston, please enjoy your wylin’
This one for my girl I been drinkin', V-Live'n
This one for my girls I been drinkin', V-Live'n
She gon’ pop that pussy like an exo bounty
Trips down to Florida, made like fifty thousand
I ain’t have a single or a fucking SoundCloud then
Buying out clubs with my niggas all in opera
Hundred fifty bottles off in Magic, can’t stop us
2013, I was draped in Louis, Prada

[Hook]
Screaming gang gang, that was early 2000’s
Only clique of niggas in the dorm serving houses
Screaming gang gang, that was early 2000’s
Bunch of red beams coming out of blue houses

[Verse 2]
J brand PRP, Balmain Zanotti
Gave away more Margielas than a college
Counted 600K nigga, no accountant
Rolling in that Honda, everybody doubted
Fuck a tree pussy nigga, yeah we made a fountain
She’ll be coming in high as a mountain when she comes
Hit her from the back and she really run
I asked her what’s her favorite candy and she said cum
And she said cum
I asked her what’s her favorite candy and she said cum
20-10, I was juggin’ out a [?]
20-10, I was juggin’ while I’m the run

[Hook]
Screaming gang gang, that was early 2000’s
Only clique of niggas in the dorm serving houses
Screaming gang gang, that was early 2000’s
Bunch of red beams coming out of blue houses
Screaming gang gang, that was early 2000’s
Only clique of niggas in the dorm serving houses
Screaming gang gang, that was early 2000’s
Bunch of red beams coming out of blue houses
