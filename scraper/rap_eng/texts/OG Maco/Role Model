[Hook]
I can’t say I call myself a role model
But I just got another roll of new hundreds
And I can’t say I call myself a role model
But I just copped another round of gold bottles
I can’t say I call myself a role model
I can’t say I call myself a role model
I can’t say I call myself a role model
But I just copped another round of gold bottles

[Verse 1]
Role models used to be the brick man
Now the role models got to be the hitman
Topped the charts, making art like a young Da Vinci
My pockets filled with money rolls and his wallet empty
I’m talking the Benjis, but nothing formalities, only fatalities
Working my diamonds, we murk em and send a shooter in and out
And the Birken cost nothing when money is granted
Junior wearing turbans, that’s right beside of me
[?] behind, and I roll up my sleeves and that Rolex behind em
I might pull up dolo, pull up [?] down from that [?]
Finessing my lingo, I got it, I got it, like Migo
I need that A1, that mota, that preemo
[?] say I’m salty, I’m stacking my pringles
And breezy bitches asking me if I’m single
I’m working doubles, why I’m averaging triples
Fully loaded like my rifle a pistol
You bitches see me in the [?] ears
Yeah yeah, bitch!

And I can’t say I call myself a role model
But I just copped another round of gold bottles
I can’t say I call myself a role model
I can’t say I call myself a role model
I can’t say I call myself a role model
But I just copped another round of gold bottles
