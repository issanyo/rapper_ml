[Intro: OG Maco]
Our lord
Our lord
Came to town, I
Our lord
Came to town with me
Our lord
Came to town
And you smiled at me

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
All black like smoggy skies
All black like order life
All backs to the wall, all straps organized
On board or board back
Re-energized, Frankenstein
He feel alive, dignified
Would testify, this ain’t a life for Mother Mary
So mother buried, oh Jesus Christ
(Oh Jesus, only you)
Big body the check status
Noble [?] in your rent, probably on dirt platters
Brag bigger, I live larger
I live larger
In the seven, the new legend
Like Blue Carter
Blueprint in my new author, and move harder

[Hook: OG Maco]
Our lord
Our lord
Came to town
And he smiled at me
Our lord
Our lord
Came to town
And I had to see
Our lord
Came to town, I
And he smiled at me

[Verse 2: Theo Ferragamo]
More than a rapper, been getting money since you remember
Been had it set in stone, nigga walk them stepping stones
That I made
And you ain’t doing shit if you ain’t making clones
From the weight of Prada more than the devil
I dropped out of college but still
Kill ‘em with knowledge
Prophet increasing my profit, got it
And showing them kindness, this beat is more than a coffin
Let it die alone, black blunt
Coming from the souls of
These rappers
Nigga I made it past the point they thought that I would never see
Theology’s a legacy
God status
Even with a halo, couldn’t handle me
More than a king nigga
But got gold like King Tut
Got soul like Outkast
And jugg turns at out cash
Say you getting’ money
When we see you you in our bag
Never been the type
We avoided the hype
It took no time to make the recipe
It’s easier than chess to me
You niggas better level up
Fuck it, get your devils up

[Hook: OG Maco]
Our lord
Our lord
Came to town
And he smiled at me
Our lord
Our lord
Came to town
I had to see
Our lord
Came to town, I
And he smiled at me
