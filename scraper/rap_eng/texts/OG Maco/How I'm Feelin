[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
Say you want to have a talk, well let’s talk millions
Tryna get to the billions, M&Ms in the ceiling
Only rerock the op, free cocaine when I’m dealing
Thanking to god when I’m mealing, the diamonds are killing
So this what I’m feeling, this what I’m feeling
Tell you how I’m feeling, tell you how I’m feeling
This how I’m feeling, tryna get a million
This how I’m feeling, this why I’m dealing

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
This how I’m feeling, I feel like a million
That’s why I’m dealing, she digging my pimping
Double cup Actavis that I be drinking
The doctor he said it be killing my kidneys
Pour up a four so a nigga can feel it
F&N hollow tip, the clip extended
Trapping and dabbing, I’m making a killing
Living, had to supercharge my Bentley
Talking bout me like I murdered a nigga
So I’m killing niggas, no witness
I seen a million but came from a penny
24 karat on my neck, Egyptian
You niggas be flexing, you more like a character in a library section called fiction
I just bought a mansion with 100 acres
A pool and Jacuzzi, that’s just how I’m feeling
I came a long way from stealing, living luxury in the mansion
Our location cost 100 million

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
So there’s no more chilling, just grinding and dealing
[?] slab at the [?], for my family I shout like Prince for the Pistons
Say you want to have a talk? Well let’s talk them dividends
I know my father watch over me, and my angels are heaven sent
And I can get lyrical, a nigga getting spiritual
And I can take you back to the bando when I had to put water in my cereal
But I can get trill, and this shit can get real
How many M&Ms do you want young nigga?
Do you want it? would you kill?
So you in your feelings, bitch you in your feelings
I thought we just fucking, but you want in on my millions
Single cup sipping on codeine, kicking shit I got a 30 on me
None of these niggas they want it with me
That’s how a young nigga feel honestly

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]

Ooh ooh, OGG, it’s OG Mac, came from the back
Uh, now we on top, now it’s going like a car
