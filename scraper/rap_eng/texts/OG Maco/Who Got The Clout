[Intro]
Ay man, it’s OGG, yeah
New Money Gang, yeah
Mm, hold all the conversations
Hold all the conversations
Mm, pussy nigga

[Hook]
Ay, who got the clout?
Fuckin’ your hoe and she in and out
Talkin’ that shit ‘bout a nigga but
You ain’t nothing that we talk about
Who got the clout?
Who got the clout?
Them dollars come in and out
Them hundreds come in and out
Fuck is your clout?

[Verse 1]
Running these bird bitches, feel like I’m Wiley
I’m dressed in Rick Owens, I’m styling
Smoking that loud on the mountain
I’m probably with Pablo, I know that we count it
Far from Nick Cannon but I’m with your ho and she wylin’
We out here, she ‘bout it
You is a lame with them smiles
I’m skipping detention and countin’ them Benji’s
I’m going monkey, go see me
Banana clips sitting right by the window sill
Lil bitch tryna come fuck me, she feeling lucky
Fuck the gang ‘cause she know the deal
Never pump fake, shoot to kill
I was in the in the field like some cleats
I was working all goddamn day tryna make a nigga some’ to eat
Bitch in the kitchen, feeling better
Qualitest got a nigga feelin’, off a bean
Hurricane, monsoon, cyclone
When the motherfucking wrist spin
When your bitch came home, no panties on
You knowing where the bitch been
Rolex shining like some headlights
On a dark night out in Michigan
Your diamonds dirty like some Flint water
My diamonds dancing like Lil Meechie taught ‘em
I’m making plays like a damn sale
Your bitch sniff ‘em like it’s good for her
Cooking beef like it’s good burgers
Sliding on you in that old suburban
Face wrapped in a dirty turban
Sending shots like I’m fucking searching

[Hook]
Ay, who got the clout?
Fuckin’ your hoe and she in and out
Talkin’ that shit ‘bout a nigga but
You ain’t nothing that we talk about
Who got the clout?
Who got the clout?
Them dollars come in and out
Them hundreds come in and out
Fuck is your clout?
