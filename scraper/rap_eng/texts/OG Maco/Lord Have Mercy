[Intro]
We don't want nothing but some money
We don't want nothing but a shot
We tired shooting at niggas

[Verse 1]
Lord have mercy
At turkey thanksgivings, grandma use to own the kitchen
Things was so simple
These adjust my thoughts, they was trying to hand my setenece
The more I had mercy, bless the judge a victim
Young and tripping bad decisions with the best intentions
Though he getting money, money never changed is vision
Absolute precision, look at all these hiss I'm getting
And they didn't know it's cause these pussies never
Knew my business
Such a cold and different chest covered old chinchilla
Floor smothered in the scrilla from my prior visit
Parely tires four garages and my L.A living
And it's all real, really I just paint the picture
I'll come back in scribbles tiny fiddles for these niggas
This your sad ending, I'm like revolution fuck a lucy
Straight doobys
Fake players and I'm drunk trynna' take the coochie
One a mclaren but the loop a made in a hooptie

[Hook x2]
The lord had mercy
Now they see us working
Blessings breed hate
Weapons formed against me
Armed with a purpose
Keep a silence on my service
And we still learning
The lord had mercy

[Verse 2]
Magical woman in my room gypsy/pixie type
Fourty percent dike, she'll eat it if the
Chick her type
This my life before the mic, label non- fiction
These niggas desperate to develop, now you pick an image
Seen my visage on your screen and say we use to kick it
Grown man shit and honestly your shit is sickening
Living though own victories, after graphes is so filthy
Bitches saying broke nigga purse got no twenties, these niggas
Acting but got no emmys
Full lotto k's, we just show semis
Home of the brave where the clank rusty/gun dusty, but if it's
Time to work then that thang bustin'
I ain't seen nothing like the cable off,dis-drop
They ain't seen dope like this since crack rock, UMP .45 with the
Blacktop
You fuck with 9-5 like my last job, niggas think they God till
The gun draw
The lord had mercy if anything go off

[Bridge]
Dile his left hand like a southpaw
I know you trying to eat but what bout
Us though,I never waste a verse on my time ho
I don't want a feature, I just grind for it

[Hook]
The Lord had mercy
Now they see us working
Blesses be hating
Weapons formed against me
