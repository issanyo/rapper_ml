[Hook]
I came, I saw, I won, damn right
I’m better, I’m better
They hated, from jump, now we on, that’s right
We better, we better
I came, I saw, I won, damn right
I’m better, I’m better
They hated, from jump, now we on, that’s right
We better, we better

[Verse 1]
Nothing on us but a bunch of ones
Nothing promised but we chasing foreign
From my partner, never turned my back
They fronted on us, now they want some slack
Peach crust with the red in it
Yellow Fanta and it’s full of Act
Scary moment from a heart attack
Got my heart in this hustle, I make the crack
How I left the stove to come back
Messy hoes asking where I’m at
I’m a fuck your friend, Imma let her suck me just to tell you bout it
For that new McLaren Imma cop an Audi
Imma keep it, you probably gone [?]
Niggas hating on me from their partner’s couch
And I’m stunting on em from a while out
That’s why you fucking doubt

[Hook]
I came, I saw, I won, damn right
I’m better, I’m better
They hated, from jump, now we on, that’s right
We better, we better
I came, I saw, I won, damn right
I’m better, I’m better
They hated, from jump, now we on, that’s right
We better, we better

[Verse 2]
Way before nice and new condos, we was with 6 in the red zone
Junior got zips and I’m working numbers
I’m a real savage, we all piranha
[?] revolver so quit the vomit
I’ll have his kids with some’ extra on em
I’ll kidnap his children for ransom homie
They can pay with his life and I pay in hundreds
For [?], tell [?] I got us down in the gutters
I come to the people, I wasn’t lonely
I might spend it all with my closest homies
Middle fingers to niggas still tryna clone me
I feel like the chair, screaming fuck the contenders
I see the city still playing with us, it’s OGG bitch we the legend nigga

[Hook]
I came, I saw, I won, damn right
I’m better, I’m better
They hated, from jump, now we on, that’s right
We better, we better
I came, I saw, I won, damn right
I’m better, I’m better
They hated, from jump, now we on, that’s right
We better, we better

[Outro]
I won, I won, I came, I saw, I won, I’m better, I’m better
I came, I saw, I won, damn right, I’m better, I’m better
They hated, from jump, now we on, that’s right
We better, we better
