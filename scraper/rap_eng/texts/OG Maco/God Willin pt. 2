[Verse 1]
What's up with all this bullshit
I'm steady speaking scriptures
I'm the same nigga screaming from the pulpit, c'mon
What's up with all this late grace
Where I'm catching up
We been climbing for a nigga for 'bout eight days, c'mon
On opponents we feast, more filet
They done unleashed a beast, I'm hard to beat
Cujo 'bout to kill Frank, c'mon
Feelin' like Miles, go to war with Sauce
Feelin' like Nas, bitch the world is ours
Oh lord, it done set me off, c'mon

[Chorus]
Is anyone else feeling godly?
Suck my dick if I'm cocky
It's only you and it's not me
It's only you and it's not me, hold up
Is anyone else feeling godly?
Suck my dick if I'm cocky
It's only you and it's not me
It's only you and it's not me

[Verse 2]
The game been on this pitbull
Everybody bitin' everybody 'til the greedy fools get full
Making sauce, we got Ragu
Lookin' at the boujee ass bitch like I think I'm gonna smash you
Givin' game while I learn wealth
Toe tags, said this nigga is fuckin' dead
Girl don't cum on my Hermes
That good head got my phone wet

[Chorus]
Is anyone else feeling godly?
Suck my dick if I'm cocky
It's only you and it's not me
It's only you and it's not me, hold up
Is anyone else feeling godly?
Suck my dick if I'm cocky
It's only you and it's not me
It's only you and it's not me
