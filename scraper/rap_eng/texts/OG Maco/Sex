[Hook]
It's goes sex
S-E-X in the bedroom
Sex, S-E-X in the bathroom
Sex, S-E yeah I want that head too
Sex, listen good
I ain't fittin' to beg you
Sex, sex, sex
Sex, sex, sex

[Verse 1: Rome Fortune]
I said, I said sex
Don't you be ashamed if you want it
Sex, it ain't really sex 'less you nuttin'
Sex, we in it now
Tell your friend she could call
She could get it now
Well endowed when I put it down in my business suit
Fuckin' like I'm Lex Steele keeping on my tennis shoes
Like Sub-Zero I finish you
Like Sonya Blade you finish too
Dripping cupcake crumbs on my business suit
And I ain't trying to whip it
I'ma get it, get the principal
Yes, that there is fornication
Ha ha, I sure love some penetration

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
I said, I said sex, mm
It's a given I'm hitting
Swimming stroking digging
And ovum bowling with my dick
Girl you crowed and groan all from talking shit
You been earning time
Moments in your thighs, looking in your eyes
I see I hit the prize, see it's puddles forming
Your mind was telling you no
But the pussy wet and you been feeling horny
I'm a demon and then I vanish in the morning
Replenish diminish your feelings darling
You'll be texting and calling and I won't answer
Question yourself, you can't understand it
Sex is premeditated when your man know you planned it
No hesitation when you enter naked
Fuck the reservations, you gotta lick the nuts
In a stone dress with my [?]
The jig is up
I be switching your friend real good, yes she do
She been thirsty, that's my little boo
The pussy honey, I'm like Winnie Pooh
The sex for dummies, mami slow to learn
She just keep coming, when she started squirting
She was lurking on my timeline
Now she crouching and I'm on her spine
Brought straight mac bring a six back
Brought a net back cause she almost gab
She smoking my dick like she doing dabs
She suck it back and I orgasm last
If she leave me alone she would just relax
If I get in my zone I might sway your peach
I don't know your name, I'll call you freak
Make the hell you need (bitch)
If nothing else make the hell you need (bitch)
I don't know your name I'll call you freak
Make the hell you need (come here girl)
Nothing else, make the hell you need (come here girl)
