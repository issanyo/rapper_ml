[Verse 1]
We right back where we started
Right here in the darkness, in black Blazers, clips and Chargers
My new Margielas marble, lookin' straight out of Marvel
This shit might get ugly
This shit might get if you don't like me, never discuss it
And that's past disgusting
A nigga gettin' plays, I used to get played
Now this 20K
I'm ballin' like 2K and Live, the sliders is up
The game set on pro, I post up the comp'
Tell me what you want
We kill 'em for fun, I'm guilty your honor
Hands filty from corners
I'm Gucci, I'm DONDA
New money, new drama, them 30s, them Llamas
Do you wanna be a champion?
Goin' for the gold but I'm not a miner
I was plottin' dolo 2 AM at diners
Now the table's loaded and no one's invited
We all free minded, cerebellum giant
Life is better free so when you're free to try
We've been shackled, grappled, body weak as ours
Y'all ain't sick and tired, y'all still uninspired
Shit I'll conspire, aim for somethin' higher
Let's all say fuck it, go and start a riot
We just saw some victims up in front of tyrants
Gettin' sprayed by hydrants cause we so defiant

[Hook]
Middle fingers up, we will not comply
Let 'em say the lies and answer with the silence
They just want confinements, they just want indictments
They know we're the diamonds, we forever vibrant
Let's destroy the system, I demand a riot
Let's destroy the system, I demand a riot
Let's all say fuck it, go and start a riot
We just saw some victims up in front of tyrants
Gettin' sprayed by hydrants cause we so defiant
Middle fingers up, we will not comply
I demand a riot
I demand a riot

[Verse 2]
My people lost and tryna map the future
With a moral compass, I'm just bein' honest
Where the promised land? Can we get the corners?
They got all us on it just to kill each other
Mothers prayin' daily, keep my soul from Hades
You see all these bitches, can we grow some ladies?
Can we treat Tyesha like they're treatin' Katy?
All these brats and babies, Brenda's still around?
They buildin' projects and we're losin' ground
Look around, it's all gentrified
Niggas out of sight but we ain't out of time
Where the fuckin' [?], we bein' undermined
Underfunded treated like a fungus
They call us niggas, take our culture from us
Gotta deal with Iggys and the Macklemores
Black girls was twerkin', they was screamin', "whores"
But Miley did it and she got a tour
Let's all say fuck it, go and start a riot
Just saw some victims up in front of tyrants
Gettin' sprayed by hydrants cause we so defiant

[Hook]
