[Hook]
Put your hands in the sky
Put your hands in the sky
If you kept dreaming and you always knew why
If times got hard but you knew you'd get by
It's okay to want it all (want it all)
Yeah

[Hook 2]
Put your hands in the sky
Cause when you were at the bottom you was thinking about the rise
If you felt different and they seen it in your eyes
If the tears fell but they never seen you cry
It's okay to want it all
Yeah, I want it all (want it all)
It's okay to want it all (want it all)
Want it all
Yeah

[Verse 1]
No country for old men, no country for cowards
My father bought me a watch and said the time was ours
My momma said grow up slow and just enjoy the flowers
I used to love all them comics then I found my powers
Never needed that freeze breath still spit the coldest
Never needed telekinesis but we moving boulders
Climbing mountains and parting oceans got me feeling Moses
My only command man it's just to stay focus
We rolling and burning bushes just to free the hopeless
Oh man we steady speeding when we could be coasting
But however we gotta get it we won't test them roaches
We got generations that need us put them on our shoulders
We got limitations in poles, imitations in those
Implications of those as all of us lose control
Elimination of those replaced with a little hope
Irritation and goals, invitations to places we only seen on a globe

[Hook]
Put your hands in the sky
If you kept dreaming and you always knew why
If times got hard but you knew you'd get by
It's okay to want it all
Yeah, I want it all (want it all)
It's okay to want it all, want it all (want it all)
Yeah
