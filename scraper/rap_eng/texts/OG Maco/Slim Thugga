[Verse 1]
I don’t know what they hating for, they don’t know what I been through
Pray to god to close hell’s doors, show me light that I can walk to
Unless it come from that 44, need less and they want more like
Like fuck states, I need a war tour, shining nice in my dreams nigga
China white in my jeans nigga, money here so them chickens lurking
They ain’t Popeyes, [?] tryna bless the world with these new verses
Make speakers knock and start a new disturbance
They ain’t know my purpose, I was just working
I was just walking ‘fore you seen me swerving
No bottom promise just a lot of problems
My nerves hurting, Atlanta stand in this black turban
Trap hot and them goons lurking
Handle that and get room service
Risk [?] and call room service, tell em give your girl my room number
Sweep her up, my broom service
She a bad bitch, maybe [?] on my broom twerking

[Hook]
I’m still tipping on four fours, wrapped in Volvos
Dirty Sprite in my foam, money all on my phone
I’m still tipping on four fours, wrapped in Volvos
Dirty Sprite in my foam, money all on my phone
I’m still tipping on four fours, wrapped in Volvos
Dirty Sprite in my foam, money all on my phone
I’m still tipping on four fours, wrapped in Volvos
Dirty Sprite in my foam, money all on my phone

[Verse 2]
They don’t know what they talking bout
I’m the one to try and talk it out
Bitch you ain’t talking right so I’m in your mouth
Handle mine in due time, I don’t walk around like Ironman
But this steel [?] hand will make you think I’m lying
Future bright so I think I’m shining
Know a lot of niggas want to undermine it
Rather see me under then draped in [?]
Draped in gold, my pharaoh coat
Born to win like [?] nose, born to win and these hoes know
On they mind like good weed
Play the outside, I shoot good threes
Still cooling like a winter breeze, need [?] for those [?] bees
Cause I need all of my royalties, real niggas been loyal to me
Live life an empire, we just tryna live royally
Put the engine up when them [?], horses running behind me
Pride run inside me, niggas mind on how I say
Mindstate on that grind state, [?] on my plate
Well done when I cook it up, paper chasers, they putting up
Real nigga, that’s ingrained, live life in that fast lane
Sipping lean, spit cocaine
Real nigga that’s ingrained, living life in that fast lane
Rap mixed with cocaine

[Hook]
I’m still tipping on four fours, wrapped in Volvos
Dirty Sprite in my foam, money all on my phone
I’m still tipping on four fours, wrapped in Volvos
Dirty Sprite in my foam, money all on my phone
I’m still tipping on four fours, wrapped in Volvos
Dirty Sprite in my foam, money all on my phone
I’m still tipping on four fours, wrapped in Volvos
Dirty Sprite in my foam, money all on my phone
