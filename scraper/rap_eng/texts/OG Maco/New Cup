[Intro]
New cup

[Chorus]
New cup, next blunt, I'm facing
New love, no trust, I'm faking
Right now, everybody 'round me faded
Right now, everybody 'round me faded
New cup, next blunt, I'm facing
New love, no trust, I'm faking
Right now, everybody 'round me faded
Right now, everybody 'round me faded
Everybody 'round me faded
Everybody 'round me faded
New cup, next blunt, I'm facing
New cup, everybody 'round me faded

[Verse]
I got extra like the news
XXL covers, XXL bundles
Couple bitches in the huddle
Couple bitches in the puddle
Make it rain, make it rain
Hide the pain, hide the pain
Make it rain, make it rain
Hide the pain, hide the pain, yeah yeah
I'm getting faded, I roll it and face it, yeah yeah
She gettin' jaded, she pourin' up chaser, yeah yeah
I'm getting faded, I roll it and face it, yeah yeah
She gettin' jaded, she pourin' up chaser, yeah

[Chorus]
New cup, next blunt, I'm facing
New love, no trust, I'm faking
Right now, everybody 'round me faded
Right now, everybody 'round me faded
New cup, next blunt, I'm facing
New love, no trust, I'm faking
Right now, everybody 'round me faded
Right now, everybody 'round me faded
Everybody 'round me faded
Everybody 'round me faded
New cup, next blunt, I'm facing
New cup, everybody 'round me faded
