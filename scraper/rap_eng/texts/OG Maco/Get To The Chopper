[Intro]
Yeah, so umm, ya know, I'm a little confused....
Are we talking about, talking about money, or... or guns?
Or... Or an actual, you know... Chopper?
Okay, we will go with the chopper then. Okay

[Hook]
Get to the chopper, get to the chopper
Stacking my bucks with the squad
Fuck it up, then we turn up on you oppers
Get to the chopper, pew pew pew, get to the chopper
I'll be back my nigga, finna turn up for some commas
Get to the chopper, (get to the choppa nigga) get to the chopper
Stacking my bucks with the squad
Fuck it up, then we turn up on you oppers
Get to the chopper, boom boom boom, get to the chopper
I'll be back my nigga, finna turn up for some commas!

[Verse 1]
Tell me what the fucks the problem, nigga?
Ain't gotta do math, just to solve it, nigga
Choppers inside of the trap, nigga
Even Serge Ibaka can't block a nigga
I'm Chaz Schwarzanigga, I'm countin' these figures
My homie get richer, my new bitch a dime, look at her figure
Before we get famous, bitch take you a picture. (Cheese)
Yeah, I drill your bitch like a major pain
My bitch a solider, like G.I. Jane
Demi Moore, your bitch a whore
Call me Django, I'm off the chain
Fuck your blinker, stay in your lane
I'm in this shit like EA
Spitting fire, feel the heat wave
I'm making money the G way
On a freight like I'm Denzel
Drinking liquor with a couple bitches
Like Jeremih, I won't tell
Helicopter, call a hella chopper
Cause it chop chop, click, pop, damn....

I thought I told you niggas, you can't fuck with me, right?
(I fuck with StupidGenius, ahahah)

[Hook]
Get to the chopper, get to the chopper
Stacking my bucks with the squad
Fuck it up, then we turn up on you oppers
Get to the chopper, pew pew pew, get to the chopper
I'll be back my nigga, finna turn up for some commas
Get to the chopper, (get to the choppa nigga) get to the chopper
Stacking my bucks with the squad
Fuck it up, then we turn up on you oppers
Get to the chopper, boom boom boom, get to the chopper
I'll be back my nigga, finna turn up for some commas!

[Verse 2]
Get to the heli, money countin choppin countin the fetti
