[Chorus]
Left wrist, nigga, that’s the frozen one
Right wrist, nigga, that’s the golden one
In this bitch feeling like the chosen one
Got a lil freak bitch, four holes in one
In the kitchen cooking like a chemist, got a bad bitch doing dishes
Cooking up, whipping and whipping
Cooking up, whipping and whipping
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist

[Verse 1]
Young nigga feel like I’m chosen
My wrist is on ice and I feel like a goalie
Water stain, got to dripping on me
When I’m doing the cook up [?] the Rolex
Birds singing like Anita Baker, now I need a baker
Hella flavor, bitch working, in the kitchen, doing dishes, can’t save her
Name a nigga more realer
Give her dope, now she fell in love with a dope dealer
Whipping my wrist in a circle, sipping on that killer purple
Left wrist thread stroke, threw a couple bands at strokes
Right pocket nigga like [?], [?] whipping my wrist and I’m focused

[Chorus]
Left wrist, nigga, that’s the frozen one
Right wrist, nigga, that’s the golden one
In this bitch feeling like the chosen one
Got a lil freak bitch, four holes in one
In the kitchen cooking like a chemist, got a bad bitch doing dishes
Cooking up, whipping and whipping
Cooking up, whipping and whipping
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist

[Verse 2 – OG Maco]
Sick wrist, got her hair dripping
Sick wrist, got her hair dripping, your bitch sick so she on my dick
Know I know it, know I got it, know you want it, know I’m on it
In the kitchen, wrist working man I need a [?]
Man I see a seizure (feds coming), got to run
Know I’m gonna get it, lean on my tongue, gas in my lungs
I been smoking pack, running em back to back
I ain’t never fumbled, I been winning humble

[Chorus]
Left wrist, nigga, that’s the frozen one
Right wrist, nigga, that’s the golden one
In this bitch feeling like the chosen one
Got a lil freak bitch, four holes in one
In the kitchen cooking like a chemist, got a bad bitch doing dishes
Cooking up, whipping and whipping
Cooking up, whipping and whipping
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
Work your wrist, work your wrist, work your wrist
