Life Life
OG Mac
It's crazy, it's like it came so fast so short dog
We knew though:

[OG Maco]
[Verse 1}
You cry before you laugh about it
Don't be reckless, think before you spaz about it
You gonna drive yourself to ruins try'na grab that Audi
I'm working twice as hard, to you to me I'm barely trying
I'm speaking all facts while they barely lying
Teaching young'ens g-code after fonix
Them streets gonna be around that's if you really want 'em
Just know this life has plenty pain and many days storm'en
Bunch of cloudy rooms and you are rarely asked a question
More shit is assumed, and everybody want they bless'en
We just try'na get our own salad extra dressing
Yves Saint Laurent, you can smell it when I'm sweating
A nine to forty five and the lord is my protection
I'mma chase this greatness, just use your latness, this my latest
Say the same word everytime I see my haters
And fuck these skemeing bitches while they lie they'd locations

[Chorus} X2

Same niggas I came with
Same niggas I bang with
Same niggas I came with
Same niggas I'm getting change with

Johnny Cinco
[Verse 2]
Yea, yea, yea, yea
New bitch, new pimp, I want new roley
Same wrist that done cooked pot
Mid-pound of them zip-lock
Got a pound, no zip-lock
Do'en flip flop, realest story I ever told
I [?] I ever sold, I ain't never told
Real nigga from the bottom
Stay down till the autumn
Me and OG back around, back a [?}
Young nagga ball'en hard like we hit the lottery
Young nigga with a lot of money
Young nigga with a lot of homies
[?] still posted to the west
Every bitch that's a bless
Hundread bands I'm finesse
Young nigga young nigga
Made outta the street
Nigga I was dest
Young nigga, young nigga
Made it from the street
Nigga, noth'en different

[Chorus] X2
