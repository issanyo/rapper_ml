[Hook: Tommy Swisher]
At the bottom of a bottle
At the top feeling hollow
We been leading where you follow
I'm a champ like Apollo
At the bottom of a bottle
At the top feeling hollow
We been leading where you follow
I'm a champ like Apollo

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
I was dreaming, I wasn't sleeping, no no
I was waiting, I wasn't eating, no no
Swear to lord all my prayers bless my patience
It's them languages and [?] that's an issue
The world'll give you just as fast as it'll take you
We been all as a people known to break 'em
Breakin' warmth, the frozen hands full of chicken
I thought I gave 'em all, I was mistaken

[Hook: Tommy Swisher]
At the bottom of a bottle
At the top feeling hollow
We been leading where you follow
I'm a champ like Apollo
At the bottom of a bottle
At the top feeling hollow
We been leading where you follow
I'm a champ like Apollo
