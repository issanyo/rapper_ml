[Verse 1: Johnny J]
Damn, baby can dick ya down
Can I lick ya down
I mean to stick around
I put the duties done
And the deed was fun
Don't try to call me ya uh, your number one, hun
Cause I ain't gonna be sticking like static cling
You got a little bit of this ding-a-ling
Now, you wanna be my steady, but baby I ain't ready
I suggest you get the fuck out of here like fucking confetti-Spaghetti- yo you're kind stringy, you tryna kick it with me baby but I'm thinkin yo you're kinda clingy
And you need to stop
Bitches don't understand that I like to drink a little gin and juice on the rocks
And don't stop the party y'all
It won't stop it don't stop on callin' ya
So come on and jet on something I call the real
I'm giving her something she can feel

[Verse 2: Johnny J]
I have a reminiscing on this dick and its lovin and huggin and kissin she don't undserstand what shes been missin, so check it
I know she wants to get back with the brotha
But I ain't her type cause I'm a mix of a latin lover
In other words, I'm mixed with black
But I have to take my pants off, for you to see that
Cause' I got inches
For all you winches
Make sure that you clean, because' I don't like foul stenches
I know it seems kinda crazy
But I'm a real motherfucker and ya'll can't fade me
So check it, I like to kick the real
I like making the bitches call me the Man Of Steel
Cause I can rip them guts apart
A nigga get busy when he gets in the dark

[Verse 3: Johnny J]
Harder goes there, it's my dick
Slippin' down your throat baby
Suck on it quick
You try to tell me you were gonna fight it
I try to do it again and ya said "Stop I'mma bite it"
Now I told you to keep on going so what's up
You said that I was crazy cause' you didn't gobble nuts
So I told you one time
Don't even try to front
Cause I gotta hundred dollar bill that says that you want
To-do-it
Then she did it
Yea she kinda hit it
Yo the hoe got with it
Skeet-Skeet-Skeet goes my shit to the ceiling
Like toyota baby, oh what a fucking feeling
I know you trippin' off the facts that I just kicked
But now I gotta let you know, it's over with
So next time you think about me and how i feel
Remember, I'm giving her Something She Can Feel
