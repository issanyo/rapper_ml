[Verse 1: Biggy Smallz]
Time to sit back, relax, put my feet up on the dash
Wrap up the money clip, flip through the cash
I see that I'm set for the day
And my craps must've paid off more than I've expected
So check it
Everybody's looking in the window
The girlies want to jump inside with Biggy
But now that I know that it just ain't that easy
Got to have one of everything to try to please me
Now will the ladies always yelling out let me ride
As I'm leaning on the window on the passenger side, right
Got to keep rolling, cause those hoes are kinda strange
And they try to get in and they got nothing in exchange
Some call me crazy but th-th-that's how I'm living
When it's female, they nothing taken, ain't nothing giving
(Oh yeah)
Life is a two-way streak
That's what I'm saying, G
You wanna roll with me
Nobody rides for free, for free

[Chorus]
Nobody rides for free
Can't get a ride from before
Nobody rides for free
No, no, no, no, oh yeah
Nobody rides for free
Nobody rides for free

[Verse 2: Biggy Smallz]
My motto and my everything scenario
I hit the upper notch of the stereo
Special engagement, no passes accepted
Cause Biggyz' respected and never affected
So check, check it out, as I roll on by
People say I look familiar but they can't remember why
I tell them who I am and they say that I'm the man
Now they think my life's a breeze, they wouldn't understand
And yes I got a plan when it comes to the ladies
Maybe you can drive if you took no Mercedes
And it's true, if you don't like it then why you saying you wanna roll
Like you're having at babies got to pay it too
I'm no angel, but I'm certainly no devil's child
You want to break me down, something you hang awhile
I didn't get where I am by being stupid, G
You wanna roll with me
Nobody rides for free

[Chorus]
So rough, so done out here, baby
So rough, so cold

[Verse 3: Biggy Smallz]
Well, it's the B-I-G-G-Y, why? Because I said so
I always got a flow when I'm always on the go, so
Just step on back for the fact that the style, me kicks
Keeps you grooving by the way, I got no love for tricks
Put it to stop to the drama cause the drama won't stop
Till I grip it from the bottom and the top, uh
And put a hold on things, squeeze my glass
Foos, don't even ask cause I'll put on past, fast
I'll even tuck and leave your croak on the dust
All you got is a fire, you better pray for the bust
You must have serve the madness, that's coming through
The moneys on my mind, steady rolling with my crew, it's true
I never stop, yeah, that's the catch
So when I'm running you down
My paint better not scratch, that's right
You can't get something for nothing from Biggy Smallz, you see
That's how it is, G
Nobody rides for free

[Chorus]
Nobody rides for free, free, free, free....
