[Hook]
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery. (I do you, you do me?)
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery. (Everything's legal, baby. Everything's legal)

[Verse 1]
A picture of perfection
The object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin', pullin' and twistin' Iâ€™m on a mission, got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady, yellin' out spots for me to hit, and "aw shit"
Soon as I seen her, saw us playin' hide the weiner'
Want a "Freak Like Me", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holler out my name when a thug nigga ride, "Can I cum inside?"
Say you don't feel it, that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
When I walked by, I said "Hi"
But you were so shy, I can't lie, damn-near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it, and even worse
Got your heart set on me going first, and that ain't no fair exchange!

[Hook]
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery (hahhaah, yeah nigga)
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery (it's all legal nigga)

[Verse 2]
Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw your legs out the window
Remember on the balcony? Bend over baby, bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? "I Get Around," and I'm haunted by my "Temptations"
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you're perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange!

[Hook]
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery

[Verse 3]
Now your attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true, I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you're gettin' dick
And since you're bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of [?] like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you're so twisted think your legs breakin'
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait until you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you're actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange
