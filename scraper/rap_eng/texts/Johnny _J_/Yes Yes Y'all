(Verse 1-Bizzy Bone)
Now Gary really wants to sue me
Stressin out tellin my groupies set it out
I already read it out usually thuggin in my jacuzzi, with a uzi
Wet 'em all....

(Chorus-Bizzy Bone)
Yes ya'll, yes ya'll, yes yes yes ya'll
Tune into the looney and boom
I come up out of my room
My goons comin from the resume and doom
Yes ya'll, yes ya'll, yes yes yes ya'll

(Verse 2-Bizzy Bone)
Yes yes get it raw
Buck at thre bullet-proof ghetto star
With a vest over my chest and there you are
(Nigga you flow too fast) Understand me
Society got me addicted to the inflicted so synthetic and wicked
Call up your family but they dyin
Split up the sticky-sticky Bryon
Like grand daddy in the 70's said he just fled and his name was red
And I saw my father paralyzed
The other was locked down there he cried
Won't see me 'till Buck Rogers dead it was there he died
I don't care he lied

(Chorus-Bizzy Bone)
Yes ya'll, yes ya'll, yes yes yes ya'll
Tune into the looney and boom
I come up out of my room
My goons comin from the resume and doom
Yes ya'll, yes ya'll, yes yes yes ya'll
Tune into the looney and boom
I come up out of my room
My goons comin from the resume and doom
