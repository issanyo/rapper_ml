This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, coming hot with heat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, coming hot with heat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep

[Verse 1]
I know you're feeling me
Mic's getting hot with heat
Your insincerity?
Makes you fall incomplete
And I'm not discrete
See I'll tell you how it is
Your whole damn fleet should be
Banned from the biz
Now there it is, I'll tell you blatantly
Coz I've been waiting for y'all to leave patiently
No hatin' me, but y'all gots to go
Leave the safe, the keys, them jewels and the door
And be outro, before somebody go help you go
Trust me, son I don't recommend that yo
But you do what you feel is right
But, first ask yourself "is it worth another life?"
This rival, ha, in this game of rap
Quit that, what you want I wipe you off the map
Shit, you know the deal, it's just like the streets
No money, you're cool
But if you got it, then don't sleep

[Hook]
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, make a man defeat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, coming hot with heat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep

[Verse 2]
It's on now so what's gonna happen here
You play calm but still I know your heart pumps fear
I hear some shit, shit stick like cement
But you stay optimistic, you hope to repent
We have consent, yo it's too late for talk
You wanna play the game, you gotta walk the walk
L.A, New York no matter where you at
If you're falling short then you must fall flat
Let that be that, I don't wanna get involved
Can't get attached, that's how the world evolves
It's your call, either you bounce or I'ma make you
Here's shorty with a half an ounce, he gon take you
They take us here, never kid
Who better than a smooth ass white kid
With man chedder
Shit, you know the deal it's just like the streets
No money, you're cool
But if you got it, then don't sleep

[Hook]
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, make a man defeat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, coming hot with heat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep

[Verse 3]
Now we're clear on that, let me show you how
I persevered through shit, so I command the crowd
It's so damn loud, your ears about to bust
But I handle that cause money, that's a must
Your trust in me is for eternity
And my loyalty is cherished nobly
For my family, one love, cheesy rat
Other than that ya'll ain't gettin' shit, and that's that
It's asinine, you try to fuck with mine
Laser sight Glock 9 gone bust, you out your mind?
I got tad and a tray bust Beretta, to me
It don't matter, the wetter the better
Shit you know it's just like the ass I get
If it's right in the beginning, I'm leaving it wet
And I ain't getting checked out all my stash
And sheets how I cause wreck and
Get respect from the streets

[Hook]
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, make a man defeat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, make ya hot with heat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, make a man defeat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep
This is how we do it from day to day
No doubt, representing in the realist way
This is how it is, coming hot with heat
Hardcore like that motherfucker, don't sleep

[Outro]
Uh, this is how we do it
Don't sleep
