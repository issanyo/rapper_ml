[Intro: Big Syke]
This goes out to all the young killers on the frontline
We ain't forgot about you, homie

[Hook: Danny boy]
Damn, you been away from the hood too long
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone
Damn, you been away from the hood too long
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone
Damn, you been away from the hood too long
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone

[Verse 1: Hussien Fatal]
I done been locked and jocked for the shit I've been claimin'
All that killin' and the drug dealin', shit them niggas gamin'
I dumped for real, Hoop Town gettin' ill
Force me to chill cause they got shot and squeal
Punk ass niggas know the half on the ave
Through your town, and Downtown Newark, I mash

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
We call it thuggin', I ain't never go all of a sudden
L like I ain't wantin' nothing then I just be frontin', buggin'
All my homies and my family, I put that on mother vein
Play by the summers it's goin' to be insanity
It ain't easy, to hold it in
When everybody around me is gettin' rich
Wonderin' where I been

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Burned out and broke
Got me dead runnin' for two packs of boges
My whole life I've been choked
Since we graduated bet you thought your boy hadn't made it
But it seem the dream that I was chasin'
Damn here is the thing that left me faded
Can't complain, shit, at least I'm still livin'
Although trippin' of all the fun that I was missin'
While I was boy is in prison.. that's where I been

[Bridge: Danny Boy]
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
I reminisce on dangerous summers
We're just a thug nigga workin' for drug dealers of neighborhoods
Run up by the age of 13
We was gunnin' and it was fun to see the police runnin'
Niggas disappear when we comin'
Little, nappy head shorty head addicted to drinkin' 40's
My niggas is naughty and y'all niggas is fuckin' corny
But you left me in the summer of '89, a very good year
Crack cocaine sales rose in every hood here
'Til you got knocked
Then locked down, bag of rocks & fat knot
You shot down, what they tell me is you livin' well
Stuck in your cell
Don't get another slip, ticket, drinkin' liquor in jail
Just as well, hell nigga, I bail, whenever needed
There's weed inside of the cereal box so don't eat it
Where you been nigga? My homies wanna know
Where you been nigga? (alone) Where the fuck you been?

[Hook: Danny Boy & 2Pac]
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone
(where you been nigga)
Damn, you been away from the hood too long
(my homies wanna know where you been)
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone

[Bridge: Danny Boy]
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are

[Collision: 2Pac & Syke]
Hey.., to them niggas in jail cell
To my homies in the livin' hell
To the niggas haven't stayed down
To all the bustas that are comin' around
To all the love ones that's gone
To my niggas better stay strong
To all the hogs that's puttin' in work
To all the young riders doin' dirt haha

[Hook: Danny Boy]
Damn, you been away from the hood too long
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone
Damn, you been away from the hood too long
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone

[Bridge: Danny Boy]
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are

[Collision: 2Pac & Fatal]
To all the young adolescent gettin' high stressin'
Can't act dumb don't ask questions
To all the other motherfuckers who runnin' blocks with they Glocks
And runnin' from the cops and blowin' up the very spot
To the hooriders that's on the streets
Lookin' for the police you out there creep
The real gang bangers slangin' thangs from the curb
My nigga love to earn gettin' ill...
