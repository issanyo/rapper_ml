What are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?
If you only knew, if only you knew
What are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?
If you only knew
(Nobody can stop me Damn)
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
What are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?
If you only knew
(Nobody can stop me)
What are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?
If you only knew, if you only knew

Look at my sister sadden when my baby's mammy
Like she can't stand me
Say family be the first to turn so penny ante
Filamina, my granny, celebrate the Grammy damn
Nobody knew no plannin' was so perfect
Rollin' on damn E., never forget the Bones
Trippin' on foster homes
Thinkin' I wasn't manly with a scarred up soul
But I keep my skeletons, understand me
What if I said I was molested?
Would you look at me pale?
But I keep on bailin'
And I hope I don't go to hell stressed, I wail
Can I sell my bio? I was born in Ohio
Already on trial
Cause Pops said I looked too light, but moms is white
But I still had your smile
And look at me now gotta be proud of myself
Ain't nobody else soundin' so worried about my health
And all the while takin' care of my kids
How would they live?
If I ain't hustlin', strugglin', (trustin') still keepin' Jesus a part of
Solution
He gives life in the lungs
Breath through the tongue
Now here it comes
Now, here it comes; and here we go

(chorus)
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
If only you knew
What am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?

And my mama took plenty beatings
Now in her third damn marriage and man
Actin' like he cares apparently 'til you perish
But I was always there for you
Even though you let me leave he's beatin' the shit outta me, too
Probably why I got my bodyguards
And I'm in charge
Watch me sleep the pay is meek
But stay with me
And keep my heart collateral, we'll never break apart
Y'all didn't see me with Eazy, as a child of God
With the underdog
Never applaud once you reminisce through the ball
Movin' in Heaven's movie
Y'all, think of all that fucked-up shit you saw
Only if you knew what I was goin' through

(chorus)
What am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?
If only you knew
Nobody can stop me, now nobody can stop me, now
Nobody can stop me, now nobody can stop me, now
If only you knew
What am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?

Flashback to me with the weight of the world
Can't stop my girl from steppin'
Lookin' for affection in wrong places
My lesson be learned world turns
The early bird gets the worm
What if it's rotten while you rushin' for love and get burned?
Five kids, that's my only concern
I was a father before I became a man society don't comprehend
Callin' me worthless but I could purchase what they purchase
But I understand behind closed curtains you workin' on being a man
Death scares me
But Jesus will prepare me
And hopefully repair me
As god would want him to, really really
Ghetto media see the thug
Wash your sins
Then it's true you can be born again

(chorus) (repeat till end)
What am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
