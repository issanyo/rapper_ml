Lemme try keep it 100, about these dollar bills, every day, people are dying, to pay their bills
When you’re down for the week, that feeling kills, wondering how you’ll be able to pay the rates, pay the tax, pay for power and gas, the whole idea gives me chills
But still I’m on the hunt, for quick cash, wether it’s from fast food, or a job, that would bring the dark to the sun, but that’s what happens, when you need to earn that loot
People are scavenging every day, but others are buying their fifth suit with 3 matching boots
It’s funny how it works huh, while some people starve others are buying brand new cars, it’s funny, how money works, honeys flirt, with jerks, as long the diamonds on her hands gleam, he can cheat, and then she gets beat, until her arms take a hard break, then there’ll be heartache
It’s true what they say, money is the root to all evil, people have billions, while other who need to eat, go jail for stealing
These are reasons why I dislike currency currently, because in the pursuit for happiness, greed will come to me
As will the devil in front of me, and I’ll become a villain, but till then imma civilian dreaming of a million
But if I can earn some cash fast, I’d take it and gatch, when ideas like this hatch
People then get robbed from the young thinking they’re tough as god, thinking they can’t be stopped till a cop pulls his gun, then a shot to the lung, and that funeral will cost some, and then the parents debt will become a greater sum
All because their sick cunt son tried to have some fun, but it’s over and done with real quick
The sight of money seems to make people sick I’ve had it with this shit, but I’m still hoping To get rich
It’s like an itch, and I’m trying this scratch it, saying it out loud sounds funny, but honestly, fuck money
