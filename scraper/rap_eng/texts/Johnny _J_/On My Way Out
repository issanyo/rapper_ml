Intro: Syke

If I die right now there somethings I want to say
Don't plan for the future cause the future is today
Live ya life like ya dying, cause in reality you are
Sometimes sacrificed, but keep praying to the stars

Verse 1:

Stay focused, they say the loc'est will die first
But the calm quiet type seems to be the worst, since birth
Off from the casket to the basket was obituary
To fulfill yo life is necessary, it's scary
That you gotta live to die, why ask why?
I need fortification in this situation passing by
Cryin' inside as I get high, as I ride
Through the Southside wonderin' when I'm gon' die
Fuck a try clock tickin' when ya born
When a baby enter this world we need to mourn
My heart's torn apart from the start
Things are never feelin' right
Runnin' in the night tryna beam up satelite
Shot a kite to that homie feelin' lonely out here
It seems done into things dreams, and nightmares
Trapped in darkness regardless my mind's touched
Ambushed in poverty so life don't matter much
Such envy and misery surroundin' me my destiny
Is to ball outta control
Want a leader follow me on a illest journey searchin' for Yahweh
I'm campaigning for him nigga

[Syke sings along with the Hook]
I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
I'm falling further into darkness
That's why we heartless
(2x)

Chorus:
Nobody knows what the future holds for you
Don't hesitate do all the things you plan to do
Life's too short, time flies as you grow
I know you don't wanna die
But one day you have to go
(1x)

Verse 2:

Once told time prosperity's not clear, no fear
My prospective can't find it but it's so near, reappear
Cause I'm almost dead steady dodgin' lead
Wanted by the feds, take me dead, feel what I said
Step in this world die forever tryna make it
Make a plan get what you can cause niggas fake it
I had to take it cause I see you can't see me wid it
Searching for greater days, are the ways to get it, shit it's
Gettin' crazy in the land where nobody cares
A ?placebo? in the mist of the night air
Prepare to get yours, open doors to a money journey
Niggas is counterfeit so bullshit don't concern me
Follow me and I'll take you where the Gs hang
Where authentic hogs made it off the street fame
Check game I been and evil mind since '79
Now niggas want me to rewind
On my way out nigga!

Chorus (along wid Syke)

Verse 3:

I know thugs that'll bury ya
I live in a drug area
Outta sight some nights'll get scarier
Drivin' on a murder course, no remorse, can't feel
Even through the pain and sufferin' we keep it real
Let's make a deal I get killed, by a black
If I do, gimme my life back
On the attack mode, ice cold as I dip ghetto block
Blunt in my mouth, hand on my Glock
Poppin' rocks is a past time hobby I take serious
Some disappear it's mysteriously funny
It's about money where I live and stay
But still ain't got here to this day
I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
Nigga prostitution are the drug trade in the States
Like devil case, they all perpetrate
I'm on my way out

Chorus (1x) (w/o Syke)

[Syke sings solo]
I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
I'm falling further into darkness
That's why we heartless
(1x)

Chorus ('til fade)
