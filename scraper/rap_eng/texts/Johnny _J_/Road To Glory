My road to glory filled with thorns
Fluent thoughts from my brain and I train to remain strong
They said I couldn’t do it, lock me in chains 'til I
My struggles closer to the pain of a trained killer
Please believe that I’ll never be shamed again
Again I'll be the next heavyweight champion
Call me crazy but no one can fade me
I’m the product of the projects, lost and crazy
Throw your hands up, Mr. Bruno, RIIDE
Big Mike Tyson 'bout to brutalize that ass tonight
No hesitation in front for the whole nation
I beat that ass so bad I prolly violate probation
Through demonstration as I strategize information
Intend to kill so it’s real like I’m catching cases haha
Let the world know I planned to die
If I don’t leave with what I came for I’ll be denied

[Hook]
Now, my first round is for the times that I spent in this cell
My second round is for the media and the lies they tell
The third round is for the pain that I felt inside
Best recognize I won’t be denied
When we ride
First round is for the times that I spent in this cell
