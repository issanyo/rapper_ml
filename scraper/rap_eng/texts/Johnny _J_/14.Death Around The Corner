[Verse: Big O]

In a high state of paranoia will I die or will I live another casket, another body they're gonna give I gotta watch I go outside and be social cause I might be another victim murdered in my local area it's scarier than what they project, they robbed me as a youngin now I got em pay em back the check, real niggas move in silence the true pioneer's of violence uh I see death around the corner bring you to the thoughts of a loner on another level tell me why everybody gang banging after puberty, never had no street unity they let us kill each other so we never loved society, getting raped or killed for a phone uh nah no love is shown take a look at my reality, is the a community? I see, I see death around the corner

[Hook x2]

What you see, what you see, what you see, what you see
I see Death around the corner
When we were kids having friends was good, having a brotherhood? That felt even better

[Verse 2: Big O]

It's a risk heading home from school on my lonely, cause them boys be pullin eyes when you on your one and only
Being born just to die were our mothers made to cry, and I could never be in a place with my own skin the love is really thin
I can't explain the genocide many witnesses of homicide, innocents die I can't explain why for my people some of us where never equal
Feel it in the air buck buck like Beanie Seagel, even if I did die young who'd care? All I ever got was burned nouns and cold verbs
One time took my cousin, I ain't bluffin got me thinking I'm next, stressed hold a metal weapon with no vest
They play this life with emoji's but you gotta play heartless, let me fly gimme breath or see me down in my death in the corner

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big O]

Now we was raised in a small circle, never made to be a G my mama raised me as an Urkel but some of your so called friends could your whole lungs spilled the streets is hot so my heart plays chilled,you was never a friend you was a funky ass nigga you want the fame been struggling since birth no pain no gain, but a nigga in your beef so em cowards wanna chase me or even try to break me, respect you gotta earn it how to be a real nigga you needa learn it, yo my ex you can have it, and never love these bitches she'd go fuck your boy and set you up cause you was sweet instead she wanted a nigga from the streets, but yo I barely eat cause a phone number could put your whole life in danger when you getting stomped she a stranger
