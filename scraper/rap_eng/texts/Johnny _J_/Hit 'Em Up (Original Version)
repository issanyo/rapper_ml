[Intro: 2Pac]
I ain't got no motherfucking friends
What y'all niggas talking about?
Hell yeah I'ma do this motherfucking track
And they know exactly who I'm  talking about, too, you old bitch-made niggas

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
'Cause uh, niggas talk plenty shit, so many tricks
I fucked your bitch 'cause I'm true to this, witness the hit
You talk bad 'bout a nigga when I got blasted
Hope you made a little money while the funk lasted
Heard they call you Big Poppa nigga, how you figure?
'Cause to me you'll always be a phony fat nigga
I can't be copied even wearing Versace, nigga you run or ruck
Scared as fuck, if the guns would bust
Now niggas talk I got a list of player haters and fakes
You bitch niggas getting blown away
You cross-eyed Down syndrome crack baby
So you and Puffy are tough? Now that's crazy
I got your ass in my sight, niggas dying tonight
We screaming, "West Side for life"
And I can't wait to see you niggas in traffic 'cause we gonna get 'em up
When you see me, you better bust 'cause I'ma hit 'em up

[Hook: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga we hit 'em up

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
It's hard to explain, this wasn't my thang when I was younger
Before my shit, I swear to God, I'll leave you stick just to make a come up
Niggas run up, 'cause more murder for the money
Got caught up tryna make a harder record, should've been on checked it
'Cause I bet you and it's for life
You'll never gonna see a nigga like me wanting a battle up on T.V
I'd rather release some of these
And put a slug to you buster ass niggas that continue to squeeze
I got some niggas back in Jersey that rather be jacking cars
And robbing bitch niggas like y'all for emergency
Let's take it back to the West Side
Them niggas sure gonna be riders and plus we Thug Life niggas, so call us multiply
Finger on the trigger, bitches stand and rise
But we don't trust 'em and they might be the first that we gon' bust on
Just label me a Bad Boy Killer
Do Mobb Deep bitches gonna feel us when we turn into killers?
Hit 'em up

[Verse 3: E.D.I Amin]
Now this is me, BBK all day, ain't no Bloodin', ain't no Crippin'
Strictly Bad Boy killer, shoot that ass like a squealer
Now let this motherfucka top down, I'm finna drop rounds
Letting these sounds, pop and then I hop up
Seeing them shatter, shooting my shit to work a lease go
What's up to the riders in a L.A. Long Beach on up to the East O
Shooting at you, C-Lo, circle, this is yo virtue
The beef for the rest of [?] meant to turn you purple
Wanna take no fame for being enemies to the game
Who'll get that ass tamed, simple and plain, y'all know the name
Drama, riders, through the whole line up
Niggas get tired of dumpin' with they gat 4
Then we mobbin' through they hood slow
No need for running 'cause we's don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm the [?], we gots to hit they ass on up

[Verse 4: Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way, yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got shot
And I'm a true eagle storming, nigga don't need your fat ass in California
I catch you on any East Coast corner and you's a goner
Puffy weaker than fucking block, I'm running through nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A in front of you nigga
With the ready power, tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty sour, I push packages every hour
My sons past moon slapping nickels on glass 40s
So hand me the cash, you made on the ave
But that’s yo ass shorty
I got a team of simple bout-able souls
Move my ears like Yoda, quick as a cobra and never sober

[Verse 5: Kadafi]
I'm on a 12 O' Clock cruise to Brooklyn and I'm looking
For the thrill to see in your barrel ready to get his life token
So where you killers at? it's bang trick? don't tempt me to
Leave your coward ass stripped and a full clip empty in your stomach
Choosin' all, yeah nigga run it
Dropping all you cowards that be jackin' a nigga behind him
You done just about made it an impossible to escape
Another 'mergency visit to the hospital I can't wait
To meet up with all you bitches in the streets
So I can leave all you cowards leaking in your fucking seats
When we hit 'em up

[Verse 6: Storm]
If you a big bad mothafucker come step to this
I got points in the clips and [?] of the [?]
Who wanna test that, to the 1 2 3 pound to bound to get they ass put under
'Cause the Storm is bringing nothing but thunder (that's right)
Who's the bomb nigga quick to feel that itchy finger
Situation on my na-na who's the bigger trigger
I approached a true G, you thought I was bitch easy
Now you on your knees shakin' me

[Verse 7: Prince Ital Joe]
