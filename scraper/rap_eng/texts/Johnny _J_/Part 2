Part 2
This is for all the homeboys who couldn't get their happy home
As long as one of us got it some of us got it
Stay down for me, hold on

Verse 1:
Sometimes you made me feel like I wasn't good enough for you
So I punished us both and didn't stay true
So much pain I know I've caused you
Truly I'm sorry every day that I'm away girl
Things went down that just don't make sense
Time and place is all now irrevelant
Cause I'm still thinking about the love that's gone
Morning, cooking breakfast back at home

Chorus:
I never meant for this to end
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember my happy home, home, home

2Pac:
Goin' through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest, it's a hard role just to keep up your faith in God
Knowing you'll get scared though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's momma, made her my wife now
I'm tryin' hard y'all, maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watching older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it'll help our child grow then together we die
Why question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I wonder what you must feel like now you know
That I'm having a seed with someone else
I didn't plan it to be this way
But things happen with time
And you know, time don't wait for nobody baby Oh, now I gotta handle my responsibility
Even though you still mean so much to me
Baby I can't say enough that I'm sorry
Oh, I never meant

[Chorus]
