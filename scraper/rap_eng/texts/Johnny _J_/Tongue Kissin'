[Intro]
Excuse me sweet heart, do you like?
Ha ha yeah
Tongue kissin'

[Hook]
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's I've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh

[Verse 1]
Listen
I can tell by the pain in your eyes you've been through so much
Feel ya could shiver at, the slightest touch
It's like you scared, I might care
I'll never hurt you or desert you, I'll be right there
Let's come together, if you trust me then I can show you
Don't be shamed, it's the changes that people go through
Don't be scared of me, come close to me please
I can see inside your mind, give you what you need
Can I proceed? who do you believe in?
Afraid to leave, but too scared that you need him
Set it free, I can take you to new places
Anticipated it's a parade of new faces
Gettin' hotter now, calm down, get a grip
Slow, baby, ain't no need for rushin' this
I touch your lips and give you kisses that you won't forget
Soft and wet, on your mark, get ready, set

[Hook]
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'

Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's I've been missin'

[Verse 2]
I wanna take you home, hate to sleep alone
As I whisper in your ear, disappear to a different zone
Promise not to move to fast, I got time
Rather have some conversation, drop lines
Can ya hear me? Tell me if you move, in my groove
Would you do what I ask you to?
See I love to make you moan your erogenous zone
Any a brother in his right mind love to spend some time at home
Though your hurtin' I can feel your pain
Try to understand, we ain't all the same
Let me take you away, can you leave
Some place, to find true peace?
Let me be your lover, a positive figure
Take your mind off the times of fucking with the wrong nigga

[Hook]
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh

[Verse 3]
I can't breathe, believe when times are low
It's like agony when I'm at home
Heart beatin' at a fast rate
Makin' moves in the nude
I imagine it's the moves that your ass make
Don't be shy, I can't lie
Pictures of me, inside you, want it so bad I could die
I've been possessed, so obsessed to undress you
No disrespect, but my aim is to sex you
After that live your life as my wife at times
You'll understand how I had to live my life of crimes
Come let me put my hands on your hips and move
With your hairdo bobbin' as we flip the mood
Give me good lovin', time to please
In and out, up and down as we grind and freeze
Put your back in the the motion and caress a figure
Make her ashamed for fucking with the wrong nigga

[Hook]
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's I've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's I've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's I've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin'

Tongue kissin'
