[Intro: 2Pac]
Hey uh I like that beat that MC Lyte got
Johnny J flip that shit, let's do that shit over
Let's do that shit like you know Death Row style, you feel me?
(Put me in that motherfucka)
Yeah that type of shit
You know what time it is
Maybe it's the thug in me

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on
Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
But do it lightly
Cause that excites me to lay the pipe
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin' deep, it's the thug in me
So whatchu sayin' girl?

[Hook: 2Pac & Jewell]
I like what I'm doing to you
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
It's just the thug in me
(Maybe it's the thug in you)
I like what you're doing to me
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
I like the thug in you
(Maybe it's the thug in you)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Moan baby when we bone it's on
It's so strong niggas in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin'
Tongue kissin', as I hit it from the back with the bed ringin'
Give me space, as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I grind when they kick the bass
Love fuckin' in tha mo'nin'
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like
Blindfolded, I'm cold do it real nice, that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin' in the chair, when ya lovin' me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, to get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin' you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you

[Hook: Jewell & 2Pac]
You like me rough, you like me tough
Making love real freaky baby
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
You like the thug in me
(Maybe it's the thug in you)
I like it rough, I like it tough
Real hard and smooth
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
I like the thug in you
(Maybe it's the thug in you)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder
I make the room rumble, in and out long stroke
Hold ya breath now, close your eyes deep throat
Did you like it?.. Oooh I'm excited!
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited
C'mon now, let me see ya shake your rump
Tell me, how long will it take to cum
Havin' fun, do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay
Only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuckin' cash came
I gotcha goin' wild, 'cause I'm lovin' you
Drugged out with this motherfuckin' thug in you

[Hook: Jewell & 2Pac]
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
I like what I'm doing to you
(Maybe it's the thug in you)
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
It's just the thug in me
I like what you're doing to me
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
I like the thug in you
(Maybe it's the thug in you)
I like what I'm doing to you
It's just the thug in me
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
I like what you're doing to me
(Maybe it's the thug in me)
It's just the thug in you

[Outro: 2Pac & Jewell]
I don't wanna talk, I don't want no explanations
(How could something so wrong feel so right)
I don't got no motherfuckin' explanations, ya know what I'm sayin?
(How could something this good last all night)
It's the thug in me
Don't be askin' why I'm pullin' your hair
(Extra tight)
And why I fuck so motherfuckin' thuggish
(Baby)
That thug passion, ya know what I mean?
(You like the thug in me)
Bitch, no mercy
What you scared of?
(I like what I'm doing to you)
Didn't you come over here to get fucked?
You ain't come over here for me to be
(You like the thug in me)
Strokin', and all that bullshit
(I like what you're doing to me)
You came over here to get fucked
Shit, if I ain't fuck you thug style
(I like the thug in you)
Bitch you'd leave my house talkin' bout, "2Pac can't serve me"
Won't have me crossed up in that bullshit, hahaha
(I like what I'm doing to you)
Turn over!
(What I'm doing to you baby, what I'm doing to you baby)
Maybe it's the thug in me
(I like what you're doing to me, what you do to me baby, what you do to me baby)
Couple of you hoes heard
(I like it)
Couple of you bitches heard What's Ya Phone # and thought y'all could fuck with me in the bedroom
(I like it, I like it, I like it, do you like it )
This is just to tell you it ain't happening, it ain't going down
(Do you like my thug passion)
As long as they make ginseng and condoms bitch you out of luck, you're gonna get fucked
(Cause I like your thug passion, baby)
My motherfucking explanation
(Oh yeah)
My motherfucking motto
(I like what you're doing to me)
Maybe it's the thug in me
(Thug passion)
I'm out this bitch
(I like it)
Hey Johnny J on the strength for real on my momma I think we rocked this one harder than MC Lyte
(Do you like it, do you like it, do you like it)
I think we rocked that one harder than Michael Jackson, man fuck that
We up out this bitch
You know how we do it on Death Row
BIATCH!
