[Intro: 2Pac]
I hope it can work out tonight wasssup
I know we been seein' each other for a long time
And (hahaha) I'm hopin' tonight can be the night
Yeah, that's right

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Another shady mission, had enough of shady tricks
You're so suspicous like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I'll die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, â€˜cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one, or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

[Chours: K-Ci and Jo-Jo]
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night

[Verse 2: Big Syke]
I'm always in the mix
Life is full of tricks
I guess, tryin' my best
Nothing less, before I lay to rest
My quest and future I'm mourn like a new born baby
Intense and seldom to the world I'm so crazy
My daddy raised me to be a man, do the best I can
He said you won't succeed in life without a plan
It's hard to take my people trade me
With Indian hate, can't wait better change before it's too late

[Verse 3: Mopreme]
They got me at the bottom of a deck, searching for my Ace
I can't take too many chances, ain't much love in my place
Full of torment and soul, and it's written all in my face
Hollow inside, a crooked smile is the only trace
A mission slightly incomplete
Misconceptions of success and defeat
I roam these dark streets alone
Searching for yo homie, smokin' til I'm gone
When I need someone to kind of lay my burdens on

[Chours: K-Ci and Jo-Jo]
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night

[Verse 4: E.D.I. Mean]
December 30 in nineteen-ninety feen yeah
My reincarnation steps in, born into a world that don't love itself, but the love is wealth
My little nigga listen closely, if you don't remember nothing else
Just remember that life ain't nothing but a game
A gamble, and how you play yo hand will sho' explain
For what's ever
In times you gone journey into a crossroad, get lost tho'
Keep on bailin' and let 'em see you up in floss mode

[Verse 5: Yaki Kadafi]
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams
It's all wrong,  Pop too long gone
And now way it seems I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in a zone
Protect my throne
Pow like king Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Living life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton
With my future behind me, livin' with these snakes
Sent here to blind me, one day I know my future's gonna find me
Am I crying?

[Chours: K-Ci and Jo-Jo]
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night

[Outro: Pac talking]
Would you be patient, and you take your time
And you finess it, 9 times out of 10
Homeboy you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
But if you rush and you just be manhandlin'
You can and yo ass can go home tonight Haha
Play your cards right
