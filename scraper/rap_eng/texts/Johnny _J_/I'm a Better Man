[Intro: Johnny J]
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man

[Verse 1: Johnny J]
I was just chilling, feeling kind of bored
Went to get some drink so I crept to the store
Sipping, cranked up, leaning in my truck
I saw this young freak, she was fingering for my nuts
She was on head with a doobie baby bootie
She want to cruise the beach, but I rather take her to the movies
Or straight to my house, yeah I like that even better
So kick back, relax and take off the hot sweater
Let a real go getter, like me the one and only
Come into your life and you can be my tenderoni
She said cool but that sounded kind of phony
Cause back in the day she used talk to my homie
But I was on a mission, wasn't nothing, no relationship
I only wanted to dig on the one night stand yo
Smooth undercover and playing my cards right
Telling her that I love her but you know that was all hype
Kind of like dinner and the whole nine yards
Got the socco and gin out the trunk of my car
Pull her a drink, a little strong but smooth
30 minutes later, she was all in the mood
Rubbing on my chest and it was getting kind of sweaty
She started undressing I mean the lesson I was ready
(And nigga all I wanna know is did you knock the boots?)
You know what up G, she was one hundred proof
Wasn't taking no short, so I have to come with it
First, I licked her up and down, putting a tape of slow jam and I hit it
A night she'll never forget, I made it legit
And now she won't switch (Why is that?)
Cause I'm a better man

[Hook: Boe]
I'm a better man, what can a nigga do
To let you know that I just want you to know
Let me come inside and show you how I feel when you love me

[Verse 2: Johnny J]
Check it, roses are red and violets are blue
Me and you we go together, like two and two, me fucking you
I'm the J to the O to the H-N-Y
J-love making love to you, any kind of way
I wanna rock, but I don't want to tie the notch
J is for the way of rock and I don't stop
Till the next day, we can sex play
Telling me you're loving every minute and that you wanna stay
Thinking to yourself (Damn, what should I do?)
About this other busta nigga that's in love with you
But I don't give a fuck, cause J is on the real
I'm bringing off crop, I'm giving her something she can feel
She might stray away but not too far
A nigga like me would give her more than a dick on hard
That's me, the menace to freak
Yo, I be tossing the freak and be up all energy
Radio won't play it, because its X-rated
Title better name, but ya still can't fade it
Fucking is the game and drinking is my favorite sport
So Temp-T get off the freakin passport
Back to the way I like a certain ho
I eat them up like tootsie roll
And fuck them sore till the pussy close
Doing damage to your backbone
All night long like Keet said, your sex got it going on
I know your thinking to yourself, it wasn't part of the plan
But that's how it's done by a better man

[Hook: Boe]
I'm a better man, what can a nigga do
To let you know that I just want you to know
Let me come inside and show you how I feel when you love me

[Intro: Johnny J]
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man
