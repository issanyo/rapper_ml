[Verse 1: Johnny J]
Look at this bitch at the dick
Just cause I'm making these platinum hits
I'm still the same nigga ho don't forget
How you used to tell people Johnny J ain't shit
Now you want to fucking have a baby by me
You say the pussy still fresh cause you saved it for me
Well if fresh means fish then you telling the truth
Cause it's smells like a tuna fish died in you
I know my boys fucked cause they said they did
Lucky hanging with a gang of bad ass kids
You try to trap me but it ain't no way
You trying to get own bitch, I don't play
Ain't trying to get stuck with no child support
I use a rubber when I fuck her, I ain't going to court
You didn't want me then, why you want me now
Are you scheming on my green, trying to give me a child

[Hook: x4]
Why you want me now?
Why you want me now?
You didn't want me then bitch, why you want me now

[Verse 2: Johnny J]
I remember when the hoes would ignore my ass
Cause I didn't have a damn thing for they're ass
I was broke as a motherfucking joke you see
Hooking up funky tracks with Dupree
Fucking around dropping hit call knocking boots
Bitches starting coming out at me like prostitute
(Johnny when we going out)
(Johnny take me to your house)
(Johnny let me take a picture with your dick in my mouth)
We ain't going out and you can't see my house
But my dick can be the cheese if you want to be the mouse
Tell the truth tramp, it's my money that you like
Cause you wouldn't look my way when my ends weren't right
And now that I got a big account
Getting pregnant is all your ass ever thinks about
You didn't want me then why you want me now
Are you scheming on my green, trying to give me a child
(What the fuck you talking about I didn't want you then
Now I want you?)
Ain't that a bitch, shut your punk ass up
(Punk ass? Oh, nigga you the one who's a punk)
Bitch you ain't shit, though. Stupid ass ho
(Oh, I don't think so, sorry motherfucker)
Fuck you
(Fuck you...Tramp)

[Verse 3: Johnny J]
Telephone ring, a bitch calls for me
She wants to get toss the pussy is all for me
The same funky hoe used to laugh and say
(He ain't getting paid girl, fuck Johnny J)
Now that I'm cocking them major bucks
The bitches pager me like it's pager puff
I try to say no but that ass was huge
When she looked just had to groove
With the hood on my head I work the ho
Make the slut double up on that birth control
I'm not trying to have no god damn babies
Got to play it safe so their ass to fade me
Bringing me a kid, bitch take it right back
My sperm couldn't make a ugly fucker like that
You didn't want me then why you want me now
