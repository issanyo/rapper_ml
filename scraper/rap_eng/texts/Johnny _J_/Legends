[Verse]
Takin' it back to the 90's
Where you hittas will never find me, but after that
I am just crossing the briny
'Cause this light of mine is so shiny
I can't lie, I didn't come from the bottom
But I know that that just ain't a problem
I keep playing that MP3, 'cause I stay juicy like B.I.G
Unlock the swag, the swag unlock
It's me against the world when I'm on my 2Pac
And I love it when they call me Big Poppa
Get the choppa, can't nobody stop a
Fiend on the scene when he's looking so clean
Pull up in a limousine, all summer 16
I ain't worried 'bout nothin', we gon' be alright
'Cause practice makes perfect, we gon' do it 'till we get it right
Wanna be a legend is that too much to ask
Gotta be Jim Carrey, puttin' on the mask
This is Bure's glory, too much to bask?
Y'all hittas runnin' errands like I'm givin' you a task
This means war, look at the shield that I wield
Let me not forget to give one to Hatfield
Too late to turn back, steppin' on the battlefield
I'm disintegrating all of you hittas, get healed
Yeah I'm Aberdeen's finest
Hitta so confused like I just changed the climate
Timbo makin' all the records, you should call him Midas
I just wanna be the highest 'cause
I wanna be a legend like Pac, a legend like Dre
A legend like Biggie, a legend like Jay
A legend like Kendrick, a legend like Rozay
We all wanna be legend, what more can I say?
Rest in peace to the young blood Eazy
Drizzy hit 'em with the hotline, call him Breezy
Y'all hittas lines makin' me queasy
Hit 'em with young mula, call me Weezy
Erykah Badu gettin' that window seat
K. Dot freestylin' in the backseat
I'ma stay spittin' heat
I do not know what is goin' on, but I'm just rapping like I'm from the streets
Yeezy 2020, he gon' have that power
Same year, imma stand tall like a tower
What are we complaining for? The world is ours
Imma grow and grow until I bloom like a flower
Gotta spring in my step like Zebedee
I'm what some of you hittas only wanna be
Gotta lotta work to do, I'm like a trainee
Coachin' all you hittas, I'm like a referee
I be feeling like Drizzy these days
Sometimes feeling like Ab-Soul these days
I'ma need you to Take That these days
Got me feeling like Bon Jovi these days
Rap music, it done changed my life
Rest in peace to the O.G. Phife
I'ma still deliver like I'm a midwife
I be feeling for the homies that still living in strife
I'm just tryna be a legend
Man this lifestyle ain't nothing that I imagined
The outcome so much better than income
NGA and Aberdeen, that's where I get my love from
Bang!
