[Verse 1: Biggy Smallz]
It's another Friday, 3'o clock, school bell rings
And I'm clear, I get a sigh of relief, the weekends here
So now I got to make a game plan, talk to my friends
Think I was to jump in the Benz
And drive around town with dope sound
Coming from the stereo
On the radio, got to say here we go
Because I'm ready to roll, ready to hit the roll jack
My girl is to the side, my friends are in the back
She wants to know if she can cruise all night
Well, if you want it, you got it, and now she's all I got it
My boys in the back seat catching out the scene
People on the corner, wearing beanies and baggy jeans
I'm feeling good because my troubles are away, far away
You know I'll go the studio another day
So come on and join us, you go nothing to lose
Kick back, relax, kick off your shoes and just cruise

[Hook]
I love cruising together
I love it when we cruising together

[Verse 2]
No need to worry cause the night belongs to us
So don't thread, and I'll bet that relaxation is a must
And it's true without a cruse, that tonight belongs to me and you
Don't look sad, because the story in the field blue
It doesn't matter which way I go, cause if stuff is right for the back, it's in eeny, meeny, miny, moe
The cool breeze and trees make everything just right
And I wish it was just a endless night
Now that my boys left girls and I together
As far as I'm concerned, we'll go cruise forever
I love it, sit back and watch the sun go down
Enjoy the elegance cause it's a night out of town
I'm feeling good because my troubles are away, far away
You know I'll go the studio another day
So come on and join us, you go nothing to lose
Kick back, relax, kick off your shoes and just cruise

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It doesn't even matter that the hour is getting late
Cause I'll put in a tape just to set the mood straight
Driving a convertible is always good at night
With a sight, going right, as we cruise through the moon light
When I'm with you, you know my heart is never broken
Look me deep inside, and tell me if I'm joking
No, of course not, I think that I'm in love
And it's me and you alone moving on with the moon above
So open up your heart, and open up your mind
If you want it, you got it, or flow it, you got it
Or whisper in your ear and I'll never tell you any lies
Fill the ruffing gas tank and we'll cruise till sun rise
I'm feeling good because my troubles are away, far away
You know I'll go the studio another day
So come on and join us, you go nothing to lose
Kick back, relax, kick off your shoes and just cruise
