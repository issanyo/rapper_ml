[Verse 1]
First of all, fuck everybody who come witcha
Ain’t none of you niggas important, just move outta the picture
If I had to really go off, then it would be lethal
So if rapping good was a crime, I would be illegal
I thought some niggas was real, but they was backstabbing
Like what happened to Caesar
So I should never have established the trust that I built up
They were never constituents, never even showed love
So now I’m here, not giving a fuck about the world
The only thing that concerns me is putting together some words
So please forgive me if I sound offensive
Never mind, I don’t give a fuck, stop sounding defensive
Don’t be stupid enough to come up against me
You will just turn into another unfortunate casualty
Don’t believe me? Go ahead and try
Try me if you like, you will meet everybody who died motherfucker

[Hook]
Come rap against me if you wanna die
Come rap against me if you wanna die
Good job, but now I’m ‘bout to demolish everybody who thought they was balling
Motherfucker, I kill ‘em all

[Verse 2]
That AK-47, Uzi and Mac-11 flow will never die
It was a gift I was given when I was young, and I ain’t even know about it
A lot of times, I go back to living my old habits
But now I’m just tryna be a better man
Only care about my fam
I ain’t changing who I am
But now a lot of people changed up
They all tryna act like they don’t even remember who  I am
So now I guess it’s fuck them niggas
I’m waiting for the day when I will get six figures
And them niggas’ll come back
Talking about some, “Aye, nigga, we got yo back”
Fuck that
Bounce back, like a bad check
I remember all the mistakes I made in retrospect
There’re a lot of good things that I miss
Like memories and old music from the past as I reminisce
