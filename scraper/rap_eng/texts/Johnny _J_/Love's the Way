[Hook: x3]
Love's the way
Love's the way
Love's the way to live

[Verse 1: Johnny J]
Don't you know you're the girl of my dreams?
The girl love my dreams
Cause I got a feeling deep in my heart
That you want to be with me
So let's get together
And make my life better
And know that you agree

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Johnny J]
I would do whatever it takes baby just to be your man
I would climb the mountain, swim the seas, don't you understand
That you're a very special lady
And together forever we should be

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Johnny J]
Baby don't you know that I want you
You know just one way
So if you take my heart and say that I do
You won't regret this day
I just want to hold you lady
Lemme runs my fingers through your hair
Kiss me baby drive me crazy
Think of all the good things we share
Making lots of healthy babies
And spreading them all over the world

[Hook: x6]
