[Intro: 2Pac]
Straight motherfuckin' ballin'
Part 2, Still Ballin'
Westside!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin'
Ridin' on these niggas ‘cause they lame
In a 6-1 Chevy, still heavy in this game—can you feel me?
Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, WESTSIDE!
Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at
Ridin', passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead; nigga, still ballin'

[Chorus: 2Pac & (Trick Daddy)]
Still ballin' until I die (Until I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (They wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin'

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Now as I kneel and pray I hope the Lord understand
When these guns involved, I become a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or deranged, I'm sayin' (I'm sayin')
But when these kids go to spray 'em, boy, won't be playin'
With clientele, any rhyme sells
Question is: will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga, this is G-rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Done fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch
And you can tell 'em "Thug Life" was the reason for this
And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'

[Chorus: 2Pac]
'Til the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin', niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin'

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to their graves
Watch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
‘Cause Trick don't give a fuck
Where you coward niggas now?
Blast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'
Busters thought we was frontin'
So reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'

[Chorus: 2Pac & (Trick Daddy)]
(I'm still ballin') 'til the day I die ('til I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (They wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin' 'til the day I die (Still ballin')
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin', niggas wonder why (Tell 'em!)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin', until the day I die
(Thug life), still ballin'
Motherfucker, still ballin'
Straight motherfuckin' ballin'
