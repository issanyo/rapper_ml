[Intro:]
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?

[Verse:]
I wanna know about the motherfucker you believe in
Cuz he is bein' a demon, at least based on his meanin'
Sending people damned to a place for eternity?
If he think Satan's bad, he must not have heard of me
I'm hearing he's in talks of bringing back his fucking savior
Fuck that nigga, he's left his people dying for years
Crying in tears, begging the sky for mercy
Bitch you lied, it hurt me, now I'm quietly cursing, you
Before you bow, make sure you know who you're about to bow to
Make sure you're aware, and know all that's going on around you
Lookout for what you hear, cuz a lot of it will probably sound true
Sad truth, is that dude, is really just a statue
He's bad news..- Created to control you
All these niggas preaching they don't even know the whole truth
Pissing me off, cuz you believing what they told you
Your thoughts are bulimic, so eat my lyrics, like it's soul food
