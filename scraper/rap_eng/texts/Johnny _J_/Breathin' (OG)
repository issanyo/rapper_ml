[Intro]
Yeah
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Tell me nigga, (tell me)
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?

[Hook]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin', my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin', now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin', my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin', now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

[Verse 1]
Woke up with fifty enemies plottin' my death
All fifty seein' visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga I was stressed
Had me creepin' 'round corners, homie sleepin' in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block, call the cops
A thug nigga screamin' "West Side", bustin' double Glocks
Hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin' up on the curb, hand on the steerin' wheel swervin'
Bless me Father I'ma sinner, I'm livin' in hell
Just let me live on the streets, cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin' world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a FUCK, ridin' as my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside Outlaw; Bad Boy killer, huh
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

[Hook]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin', my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin', now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

[Intermission]

[Hook]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin', my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin', now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

[Verse 2]
Hoppin' out my four door Chevy, in this game, I'm still heavy
Rather be your N.I.G.G.A. if you still let me
Promise not to cum quick
You fuckin' around with the Don bitch, I run shit, with one clip Mr. Makaveli quick to mack, go back to the telli
I fuck a bitch like I'm psychotic, I think that's what they tell me
Fuck around I don't fight fair
A world wide mob figga, local nightmare, just call 'em right there
Open fire, 'cause my desire is to ride
Got every nigga signed to Bad Boy, prayin' that I die
Some have prophesized, homicide, some have tried
They couldn't see the coward in they eyes, 'til they died
They wonder why, they targets
Defenseless, when my squad hits, hard niggas
