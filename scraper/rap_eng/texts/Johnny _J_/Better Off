[Hook]
You better off getting you a ho
Cause she doesn't wanna know who you with or where you go
She only has two questions
Where's your skeets and do you have your protection

[Verse 1: Johnny J]
Now bitches want you to do for what you stuck fucking them to
But doesn't that make her a prostitute
She wants me take her out and dine her a candle light
But the next day, the ho wants to fight
About all the time that I'm spending with the homies
To me, I was better off when I was lonely
Or should I say single, free to mingle
She started tripping the minute that I made her coochie tingle
That's when everything change
Now when ever I go out, she wants a list of names
Of people that I'm going to be with
Huh, but I told that ho, don't come with me with that nonsense
Now every time I open up my mouth I telling her a lie
Me explaining, don't even try
Because when I get home, I don't want a gang of hassle
A man's home is suppose to be his castle
But then she keeps on tripping, Imma cut her loose, let her go
Cause I'm better off getting me a ho

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Mel-Low]
Bitch I ain't got time for no ass silly games
Let a nigga know when you wanna do your own thing
It ain't shit to let a ho girl go
Because a brother you can't choose your ain't no ho
But way back in the day, I remember pop's told me
Never have a girl that have been with all your homie
And shit a look because the girl will find you
Where you least expect, the ho is right behind you
Words from the wise because my pops had three wives
So I see what he saw already through these eyes
Should I stay single with a gang of bitches
Or should I settle down and clown off my riches
They say a good woman makes a man complete
But nowadays they fucking every nigga that they meet
So Imma stay alone for the fact that I know
That I'm better off finding me a ho

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Johnny J]
My homies don't understand why I never trip
When other motherfuckers try to hook up with my bitch
The way I see it every take that she was never mine
But another ho is a waste of my time
I let a nigga rushing the captain strong
Cause then I can see what the fuck is going on
And if she gets busted there's no need to discuss it
It's over with, history, see you later, fuck it
The bitch is out on the street
Shit packed up and waiting on the concrete
You fucked up, you gotta go, gotta go
It's your fault that two went solo
So don't try to speak, save all your drama
And when you get home, tell it to your mama
Cause Imma just kick it and take it slow
I'm better off finding me a ho

[Hook x2]
