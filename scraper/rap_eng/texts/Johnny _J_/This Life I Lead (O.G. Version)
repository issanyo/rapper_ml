[Intro: 2Pac]
In this motherfuckin' life I lead, shit
A hell of motherfucking road blocks
And crooked cops
We still ride though
What side? Westside

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major ways, â€˜cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em wary
Why you frontin' like you Billy Badass? Nigga, you scary
I've been knowin' you for years
We was high school peers, in junior high
I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga, it's how it is
Homie got into a fight last night that killed his kids

[Hook: 2Pac]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

[Verse Two: Gonzoe]
I stopped to think, rolling a Philly up full of dank
Pouring the remaining of my Remy Martin down the sink
Back to get dressed, grab my strap in case I'm tested
Chronic and Stress, await the bitch to clean my mess
Wishing I was sober not fucked up, with a hangover
The homie just released, so the whole hood came over
The west side bash, they're piecing on dime bags
Macking in the living room, shaking that ass
Talking fast to whores, we pros at what we do
It's on and popping once we get this bitch full of brew
I knew some shit might crack so we strapped and all thick
Swerving the niggas I see, who ain't invited to this shit
Give a Fuck! the life I live, that's how it is
Fuck around you will be crying, missing your kids
HUH! My destiny in this motherfucking game;
Is either to get rich or die

[Hook: 2Pac]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

[Verse Three: Daz Dillinger]
When they see that nigga Daz they say I'm dangerous
In this strange world; believe who just don't give a fuck
I mean I stroke with the intentions, cuttin' it up like I supposed to
My job is to protect and rob and serve you
Who hold the genius? - we done left, Death Row is breathin'
Heaters gotta get served til none has left breathin'
What I'm achieving, smoking weed and fucking hoes
Ain't going nowhere, no man is going to strive, be on a stroll
I gotta make it happen everyday and all day
I gotta make my hustle and come back with big pay
Tear up the spot lay, creating ruckus when I touch down
Who got my back when they put the attack down?
So I lay out cold, petrified, terrified
Barely alive, come again when niggas start to ride
With the Outlawz and Pounders, blast, I'm clownin' on three
Nigga you're my motherfuckin' enemy

[Hook: 2Pac]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

[Verse Four: Kurupt]
That's right! - that's right! Terrordome, where it's on
From selling dope, coke, to crack
Young Gotti, entered the party from the back
Instant pay; I gots to do it my way
Deserve to swerve on the highway
Cause the spot is sewn from Monday to Friday
Nigga try me, I like the Indica and Ty Weed
Defy me, Young Gotti, when I be high as the sky be
Verbal homicide, be ready to rupture
Making moves to touch ya, disassembles your whole structure
I makes money, cause that's all I know how to make
That's all I learned when I was young, no hesitation or mistakes
I see a pot, filled with nothing but rocks and knots
Midnight complexion, Glocks to shake spots
They see my people, so they already assume I live illegal
But they assume too soon
I got a treat for every bitch on the street
I role with beat, I got a problem, I got a fixation for heat

[Verse Five: Nutt-So]
The life I live is treacherous, no one stands next this
But still motherfuckers be trying to fetch this
Nutty nigga that brings heat to your set
Unloading two two threes until your ass breathes death
Nigga, East Side, Oakland, no joking, we kick up dust
No remorse, so you and your boys can suck these Nuts
Extended clips left his nose sanded, I'm right handed
But when it comes to the pistol bumping; I'm both handed

[Hook: 2Pac]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
