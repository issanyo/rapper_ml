[Verse 1]
Nobody thought I'd make it, the world called me loser
Just a high school dropout, young drug abuser
Mama told me there'd be days like this, I never listened
Spent my childhood years in my neighborhood prison
The world don't give a fuck about the kids
I can see from the poverty and the evil shit they did
To my young nation
Participation, more hesitation could turn lethal
When ain't no love for a young nigga he turns evil
And burn people with no hope, there's no peace
To all my niggas start regulatin' on your streets
Bustin' the neighborhood scatters, another drug war
There ain't no truce or negotiatin' with thug lords
Tried conversatin' but he won't listen
He said the world is a livin' hell for God's children
Picture him still in a Pen', doin' life plus two
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview

[Verse 2]
It's clearer now, 'cause I'm a noted individual
Plus I'm a Don, not just a small time criminal
Time's have changed, homies died, only lives remain
Massive amounts of narcotics help me hide the pain
Wishin' on Benz, came up on a Jag
Then got it out for the quiet times, reflect on the past
All my homeboys that didn't make it, for you I'll do it
'member back in the days as young truants
HUH! tellin' me to beware
Because you cared and helped me to be prepared
Cemetery full of homies no longer here
But what about the babies, lost in watchin' burglars
Too dumb to be a dealer, too young to be a murderer
I'm beggin' you God, don't make their lives too hard
They're already scarred, too doped up to see the stars
We're livin' to die, everybody is high, plus I'm high too
Starin' at the world through my rearview HUH!

[Verse 3]
Pictures are plenty, handlin' semi, sippin' Henny
I hustle for pennies, know my own feared by many
I watched and took notes as a child I strategized
Witnessin' crack dealings and drug killings have scattered lives
Niggas don't know me but they think
That we could be closer than homies
Nigga you're phoney so quit buyin' drinks
Mind on my money, you're funny, you're about my currency
Niggas don't wanna see me
Shootin', but they ain't worry me, livin' to tell
Prison is hell for a nigga, they're usin' my bail
Built bigger jails for a nigga
Father I'm feelin' tired, forgive me, 'cause I'm a sinner
Livin' life as a thug, while duckin' cops and the criminals
Homies is dead and buried, past time has gone
Don't ask why drink liquor 'cause my mind is gone
And if I die, then let me watch what we been through
Starin' at the world through my rearview HUH!

[Collision]
Starin' at the world through my motherfucking rearview
Peep what a nigga trying to say; recognize that a nigga done did it all
And seen it all and got shit to say to the motherfuckers
That ain't seen shit and did shit yet
Peep game, look you little young motherfuckers
Stop running your heads up against brick walls
These old niggas got something for you nigga you better listen
Gotta get your over the dump
You know, you got to get over the humps ha ha
Staring at the world through my motherfucking rearview
That's right baby, Thug life, West Side
Death Row, Outlawz, you what time it is
Staring at the world through my rearview HUH!
They got me staring at the world through my rearview
Alright
