[Intro: 2Pac]
Well, I just heard some shit on this record
(Fuckin' in the midst of my comrades)
I send this out to that biatch; you too, nigga!
(Standin' in the midst of my comrades)
You fuckin' with some thug niggas (That's right)
Believe that like you believe crack kills, you stupid mothafucka!
(Fuck you! Standin' in the midst of my comrades)

[Hook: 2Pac]
You must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Have you really thought about your part in this participation?
My prediction bloody murder similar to ministration
Now in fairness to conversation
‘Cause it's your fate so take the time
To contemplate what you'll be facin'
Talkin' that Hip-Hop shit, don't get shot, bitch
‘Cause you can tell all in your clique to eat Pac's dick
The clip's in, prepare for the mothafuckin' death blow
‘Cause every rapper in the industry is history, it's Death Row
Not Bad Boy or So So Def
I make you bow before Tha Row like them other hoes
The intricate design of my lethal lines, criminal rhymes
From the mind of a thug shaking state time
Take it to the next phase; you had your time to talk shit
Now bitchless busters getting checkmated
These days mothafuckas talk shit and turn snitch
When you see 'em they ain't talking about shit; Westside!

[Hook: 2Pac]
You must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades

[Verse 2: EDI]
See, by now the way this shit is situated
Niggas is getting eliminated simply for being affiliated
Clearly stated and, man, I know you hate it
We got a whole list to play with
And y'all niggas is at the top, now let's make this
Happen, fuck the rappin', let's get to scrappin'
So niggas can see what happens
When you get caught up in dirty-mackin'
EDI'll send you packin', you know we love action
Sneak up on attack, pull back, let's the slugs snap in
Your chest section, Death has now stepped in
Bitch, should have learnt your lesson
While your chance was still present
But now it's past tense, no question askin'
Out West it's called mashin', bailing the corner blastin'

[Hook: 2Pac]
You must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
You must be so so crazy; bitch, I'll beat yo' boy bad
Driving in the truck with my black MAC
Thinkin' about the shit I never had, so I'm loading up one
And the two things that I cherish is money and guns
I love my ones and I'll put blood on you
Snatch money from you, leave slugs in you
Ain't no nigga breathing fucking with Pac
Every album that he drop, nigga, number one spot, nigga
Locked, nigga, let me represent for my dead ones
Eat with my loved ones, squeeze when the beef come
Chill when the freeze comes, I do that shit
You think you heavy in the game? Watch me move you, bitch!
This Napoleon, why did I say I again?
You punk niggas already know I ain't for show
And I'll die for the dough, nigga, that's for sho'
Never die for a ho, nigga, that's a no-no

[Hook: 2Pac]
You must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades

[Verse 4: Big Syke]
Who I'm gonna call when a mothafucka feeling sad?
My mothafuckin' comrades
Who I'm gonna call when a mothafucka doing bad?
My mothafuckin' comrades
And fuck yo' bitch, ‘cause you a trick anyway
‘Cause my comrades was raised on pistol play
And boss playerism mixed with this thugism
So ain't no love in 'em, nothin' but the fuckism

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Last verse is for them trick people, this is the sequel
I'ma treat you with evil, living forever illegal
Now homicide got me preoccupied
Be a lie if I told you that I never wonder when will I die
Be assured, nigga, word born
‘Cause now it's on, you can only survive if you be strong
Until I'm gone I'll bust on Bad Boy
Middle finger to Da Brat, don't get your young ass smacked

[Hook: 2Pac]
You must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades

[Outro: 2Pac]
Look here, you mothafuckas knew when you wrote this shit
When you spoke this shit, when you smoked this shit
Uh, that you couldn't fuck around with us
Now what the hell possessed you to get on record
And play yourself like that?
Nigga, is you fuckin' nuts? Do you know who the fuck we are?!
Nigga, do you know who the fuck we are?!
Rectify yo' silly ass, you better put out an apology out, nigga
Before I yank that ass out the game, stupid mothafuckas!
Don't you know I don't give a fuck?
I'm mad at the world, fuck all you trick-ass niggas!
This Thug Life, nigga, Outlaw Immortalz, Westside
Thought you knew, Westcoast, nigga
All day long, fuck the world!
You must be so so crazy; bitch, I'll beat yo' boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades, ha ha ha
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades
My mothafuckin' comrades!
