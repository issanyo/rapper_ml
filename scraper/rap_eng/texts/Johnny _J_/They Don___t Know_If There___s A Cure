[Intro: 2Pac]
Aye, we doin' this for the fans
For the motherfuckers that be in our corner
This right here is some live shit
Ain't one word written down
Ain't no words from my mind
This is the shit right off the level
This how we do it
Cause most of the time, what niggas like

[Bridge: 2Pac]
Niggas know me!!!
But they don't know the D-O-double-G (no they don't)
They don't know oh-oh-oh
I say they swear they know me!!!
But they don't know the D-O-double-G (ha ha)
They don't know oh-oh-oh
My niggas down with me!!!
Until the day I d-i-e-e-e
You ho's know oh-oh-oh
I say my niggas down with me!!!
Until the day I d-i-e-e-e
You ho's know oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: 2Pac & Snoop Dogg]
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it (biatch)
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm up early in the mornin', tryin' to get paid
Cause my mind's on my money, everything is so made
I play game in the youngster, as a youngster
Tryin' to make my money, tryin' to become a hustler (yes)
Finally made the status
Gladys Knight and the Pips
Snoop Dogg 'bout to trip
Catch your grip and then I'll dip
Makin' money is a must for me, I gots to have it
Cause you know my lifestyle is like 2Pac's, it's just so lavish
Just movin' on paper; movin', makin' and shakin'
Leavin' fools in a daze, as if, I was a Laker
Break 'em down and shake 'em, pass it off to 2Pac
And let him take a jump shot
Because he gon' give it all he got

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Back in the old days, niggas was suckers, tried to belittle me
But that was when I was much smaller, just a little G
But now I'm a just a bigger baller
Niggas don't wanna see me, because I'm larger and taller
Made my money get bigger, bank account is larger
Niggas don't wanna see me
They label Dogg the father
When they see us on the streets, niggas scream peace
They don't want it
Cause they screamin' they "Can't C Me"
You heard the album, All Eyez On Me

[Chorus: 2Pac & Snoop Dogg]
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Take a trip around the world (world!!)
Cause that's what a nigga love to do (love!!)
I'm havin' money like a nigga's 'suppose to ('pose to)
You know this money be the topic that I'm spittin' on (riiight)
Cause I gots to get my grip and fingers gots to keep it on
I'm scratchin' for some scratch and some scrilla
Tryin' to get the big paper
Cause yo, paper is a killer
Leavin' niggas on daze
Cause yes, money pays
Cause, if you ain't got it
Then it seems you out plottin'
Tryin' to do you a robbery, or some type of assault
But you just might get caught
But you know it ain't my fault
I'm gon' dip away and slip away
And find me a hideaway (hey!!)
And look for my nigga 'Pac
Gon' and take the ride away

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Well I'll be right there homie, uh
What's up baby?
You lookin' crazy like you don't really know me (know me)
I know you heard the album, I Ain't Mad at Cha (mad at cha)
So move closer, big baby, let me stab at cha (stab at cha)
You know the rules, Big 'Pac in this motherfucker (motherfucker)
Don't look at me crazy, cause baby I ain't with them other suckers (suckers)
This Thug Life, baby, Outlaw Immortalz
I thought I taught you
Baby we don't do it, but we fought you
And when we did, we beat you ass niggas in the streets
To the motherfuckin' studio
Soundin' like Phil Collins, singin' su-su-sudio
You niggas is booty

[Chorus: 2Pac & Snoop Dogg]
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a

[Bridge: 2Pac & Snoop Dogg]
I say niggas know me!!!
But do they know the D-O-double-G? (I don't think so)
They don't know oh-oh-oh (they don't know oh oh oh)
Say niggas know me (know me)
But do they know the D-O-double G?
You don't know oh-oh-oh
Niggas down with me!!! (down wit him nigga)
Until the day I D-I-E (Thug Life Thug Life)
You ho's know oh-oh (Dogg Pound Dogg Pound)
I say down with me (down wit him nigga, down wit him)
Until the day I D-I-E
You ho's know oh-oh

[Verse 5: Snoop Dogg]
It's like a family
Corleone style (Corleone), or mafioso (Outlaw)
Snoop Dogg 'bout to do it like Mussolini slow
E.D.I. what up nigga? I see you, I feel you real now
Snoop Dogg 'bout to show how you, how I peel the crowd
I step back, relax
New jacks, they get smacked up against the wall
When they, think that they can get with that, nigga Doggy Dogg
I'm so smo-o-o-th (so smooth), I keep it on the real-a (real-a, kill-a)
Cause, I'm a true killa when it come to makin' scrilla

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
Them niggas know, I suppose they froze
Once they seen me and the Dogg, doin' clothes in the videos
Bitches pause, we all up in them drawers
Baby you know the secret, uh, I gots to keep it
Money, paper, and bitches, my only motto
Drink out the cold forty bottle
My dog, you know these niggas is hogs (haha)
Now me and Snoop came up, and built our name up
Bitches thought they had us crossed, but bitch I got my game
Plus, I'm a motherfuckin' baller, alcoholic
You can ask my homie K
He'll tell you, I've been ballin' since around the way
And E.D.I., had a baby
He's needy, but he's crazy
Got these niggas runnin' wild from this fuckin' .380, now uh

[Outro/Chorus: 2Pac & Snoop Dogg]
Check this out
If there's a cure for this (then nigga)
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
You don't want it biatch
Don't need it (that's it)
