[Intro]
Troublesome nigga
Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfuckin'-96
Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

[Verse 1]
Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan
To be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me that little brat
Shit them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
Cause they fear me in physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

[Refrain]
La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lah
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die
Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, haha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome
La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lah
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die
Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome

[Verse 2]
Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor bet I bomb on the first niggas
Knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin' off freely
Screamin, "Fuck - ALL Y'ALL NIGGAZ" in Swahili
Pistol-packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor learned to get high and pull drive bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin thoughts of my enemies pleadin', please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died;
Cause I'm troublesome

[Refrain]
Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless - I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus BA-BAY
I'm troublesome, haha
Bad Boy killa', there is no one realer
What you saw was the rough rugged and raw - Outlaw!

[Verse 3]
Murder murder my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme - the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep; I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life;
I'm troublesome

[Outro]
In your wildest dreams, you couldn't picture a nigga like me
Haha, I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome like my nigga Napoleon said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Haha, I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don, the boss of all bosses
Mussolini, E.D.I. Mean, Hussein Fatal, Kadafi
Kastro, Napoleon, Komani
Haha, we ain't fuckin' around, we troublesome
Ayeo, haha, we troublesome, I ain't goin', haha
Young Kastro, the first to blast the last one to dash
Goin' for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas, Outlawz
Kadafi, trump tight never sloppy
Them motherfuckas try to copy
But they can't mock you nigga, you're too strong
Outlawz keep it goin' on, you know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz, haha
Take whoever [?]
Aka [?] Johnny J
That you been militant
Outlawz, Outlawz
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets
I rather die than see the penitentiary
We all fuckin' Outlawz
You know what time it is
You see any motherfucker with a Outlaw on his neck, give him respect or get chin-checked
All out [?] getting wrecked
From the TEC to the Mini-14, we make you all scream
Death before dishonor, the first to bomb, ring the alarm HA HA
Try to flee but you cannot defeat what's in your mind
Outlawz every time, we Outlawz
Troublesome
Troublesome nigga, you know
Troublesome ahahaha
All in your mind, every time
Troublesome
