Get away from me
Get away from me babe
Get away from
Get away from
Get away from me

[Verse 1: Johnny J]
While I was rippin' up shows
You were lovin' another man and everybody else knows
Doing it in public, not being low key
I didn't wanna believe it, even though one of my homies told me so
But i don't think so
Because I'm letting you know I'm not letting you go
I knew right then that my heart was stuck
Should've known right then but I didn't know what was up
Cause week after week I would send you skeets
For you to go shopping and make payments on your jeep
To let you know that you got a good thing
A brother went out and bought your punkass a ring
Everything was going cool or so it seems
You had J sprung, livin' in a dream
I couldn't see it, you lettin' him roll in my car
Buying him clothes and treatin' him like a star
Until the day the fool needed some kind of bail
You pawned the ring to get the stupid sucker out of jail
And when I asked you where its at
You told me that your ass got jacked
Then you introduced the man you said he was your cousin
Took him on a trip, while I was gone he was all up in your muffin
But that ain't nothin,' the last thing is the best
He took off his jersey and had your name on his chest

[Hook]
Get away from me
Get away from me babe
Get away from
Get away from
Get away from me

[Bridge]
Your funky ass don't understand
Girl I ain't ready
I don't want to love no more
Too much trouble dealing with your kind
Pack your things and just walk out that door

[Verse 2: Johnny J]
Remember way back, you told me you'd never say that
I never really wanted to be involved with this way back
Just love me and relieve me, tickle me and tease me
Say you'll never leave me, do it nice and easy
But um you never really seemed to care
Or bother when I told you that I'd rather be your lover and ???
So flip and trip in retrospect I lost respect for your hookish ways
So baby what's next?
Temporary conflict, how can it get better
I still see the day when you tracked in our Jetta
You couldn't hold on cause my grip was loose
Change fallin' out my pocket like I'm pouring juice
So that's how the story goes
You wanna get with another buster cause he buys you clothes
Just to get inside I had to chase and hogtie
Well look at the fall guy, I feel like a small fry
Now you back cause you heard that I
Got a record coming soon so you just came by to say hi
(Nah baby it ain't even like that, why you trippin')
(Hell nah, hold on)
Because a brother like Johnny J and one of the peoples that wanna be down with this
I feel like breaking your damn neck I'm serious
So baby move on before you take my grip, before I make the hit
And show you no love and straight trip

[Hook]
Get away from me
Get away from me babe
Get away from
Get away from
Get away from me
Get away from me
Get away from me babe
Get away from
Get away from
