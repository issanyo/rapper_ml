[Intro: Mr. Krane]
Ay, this a special public service announcement... FUCK ALL YA! *loud gunshots*

[Verse 1: Young Prada]
Ay yo, russian losers, yo, stop that shit
I'm a fuckin' G, homie, on my motherfuckin' street
What the fuck is up, my niggas? Who the fuck is this?
This is russian motherfuckers, they don't look like G's!

[Verse 2: Mr. Krane]
AK-47 pussies suck my fuckin' dick
I hate all these motherfuckers, they don't rap like G's
I'm tired of listening to shit about drinking "Jaguar"
Training sports and fucking bitches, this is dark PR!

[Verse 3: Young Prada]
I say "Fuck you!" to Guf, St1m, to motherfuckin' Busta
I know niggas, who got flow that is crazier & faster!
The motherfuckers from the "Centre" make me wanna die
And bitches like that JohnyBoy are doing nothin' but cry!

[Verse 4: Mr. Krane]
What the fuck you know about being a gangsta, dude?
You ain't better than Oxxxymiron, that fuckin Jew
Or than Misha Mavashi, cock-a-sports-a-man
Who likes to go to the gym? Who's the gangsta, man?
Say what you say, you, crapper, look like drunk
You drank too many "Jaguar" cans? Go to the trunk
Let's take a ride in my '64 Impala, gangsta's car
You'll tell me who's the real motherfuckin' rap-a-star!

[Hook: Mr. Krane]
Grab yo' Glocks, when you see my dog
Call the cops, when you see my dog, huh
Yo, this is Russian Revolution, motherfuckers, if you don't stop
We're gonna make you do it, sucker, we hit you up...

[Bridge: Mr. Krane]
Yo, this is a lil' warning to the Russian fags who claim themselves the rappers! We kill you! P, kick it!

[Verse 5: Young Prada]
Russian motherfuckers haven't got 64's
They don't have blings and they have no hoes
These motherfuckin' bitches think that they are real rap
Motherfuckin' St1m and Stariad said they are 'not crap'
I've got no words to say about russian bitches, they are shit
The bitches like Loc-Dog can't make the hit
We're gonna save our rap, we're gonna save hip-hop
We're gonna tell all Russian motherfuckers "Yo, stop!"

[Verse 6: Mr. Krane]
And if these suckers don't stop, we will make them!
We'll rise our gangsta army to show 'em we hate 'em
Our middle fingers won't go down, we will take our guns
And they will fuckin' fall down like these fuckin' cops
They were shot in '93 by King of Rap - 2Pac
And he was making real shit, not like fag-ass punks
I have already said everything that I wanted to say
And you, the Russian sheep-fuckers, go to church to pray!

[Hook: Mr. Krane]

[Verse 7: Young Prada]
I don't listen to that shit, because I start to feel bad
I'm sure that Russian fake rappers are just unable to rap
I look at these bitches and I wanna play
Wanna kill this motherfuckers, what can you say?
He makes the horrible songs but wants to diss me
You know, I'm motherfuckin' P.I.M.P.,
I work hard, I play hard, homie, can't you see?
Let's destroy Russian crap, don't buy their CD's!

[Verse 8: Mr. Krane]
We don't apologize cause it's just the way we are
We don't hate every Russian rappers, yo, we got one star
His name is Noize MC, he's like our Eminem
The problems of young generation are important for him
Drugs, sex, relations, politics and the night clubs -
He makes a lot of kinds of songs, he is from suburbs
He could become a real G if he lived in LA
He is true rapper, and swaggers go to pray!

[Hook: Mr. Krane]

[Outro: Mr. Krane]
Hey, bitches! We haven't finished yet! We gonna murder you, ALL OF YOU!!! *gunshots*
Ah, three faggots less. Huh. L'ego, P! *BANG*
