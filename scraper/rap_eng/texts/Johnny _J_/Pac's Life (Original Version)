[Intro: 2Pac]
Everybody needs to chill
Player haters want to see me killed
Only real niggas stay on top
All these niggas is mad at me
Cause they can’t live like Pac

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman, nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin' cop cars, look at how we come so far
Picture a high school drop-out rollin a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me – can't
Never visioned livin' longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out, or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change, it comes with the fame
Watch for gossip and the silly games
To all the motherfuckers speakin' down on me, this is the night
Why's everybody caught up in Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas
Why y'all conversatin' in my life?

[Hook: 2Pac]
This is Pac’s life
And everybody needs to chill
Cause this is Pac’s life
Player haters want to see me killed
Pac’s life
Only real niggas stay on top
Now all these niggas is mad at me
Cause they can’t live like Pac
