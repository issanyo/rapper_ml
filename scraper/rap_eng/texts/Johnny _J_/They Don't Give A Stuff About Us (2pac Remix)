[Chorus]
Everytime they write
They write tryna sell their lies
They don't give a stuff about us
Most believe their lies
Then their souls pay the price
Cause they don’t give a stuff about us x2

[Verse 1]
Sad to see some pastors
Lie for a check
Like give us your money
God will free your debt
Rappers lying to impress
Advocating forced sex for approval and checks
For your soul half their verses
As good as pests
Compared to God their small
Small like insects
Yet some say their a God
Man what the heck
I bet only if I said it
You'd be like what the heck
I'm a God
Is what Kanye said
Satan take the wheel
That’s what Eminem said
Their big like Shrek
Earn big checks
Now we act like they ain't selling death
I hate it
Honestly I hate it
When rappers sell out for the bacon
They say they go H.A.M
But they probably be faking
Most be faking for the
Dollar dollar bills yo

[Chorus]
Everytime they write
They write tryna sell their lies
They don't give a stuff about us
Most believe their lies
Then their souls pay the price
Cause they don't give a stuff about us x2

[Verse 2]
Dollar bills yo
Selfishness got us blind bro
Selling our souls
For the end goal
Money making the end goal
But that end goal
Won't last no
And That end goal will end when you die yo
So think before chasing that goal
Truth is if you have a soul
Things can't fill it no
Only Jesus bro #realtalk
