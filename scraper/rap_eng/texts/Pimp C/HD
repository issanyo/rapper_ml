[Pimp C Talking]

[Verse 1]
Sleep don't exist
In this line of work I profess that will be all the sleep you'll get
Ain't got it inside me to rat on nobody I'm pleading the fifth
Me I dun walked through the realist my nigga my feet is legit
You peeping the drift
My nigga you probably would run
Probably the type get to squeezing then end up dropping your gun
I am the One
Came from the dominant one and he made me the prominent one
I am the Son
Swear that it ain't not a nan not a nigga as hot as the sun
Time has begun
I hope that your mama can come
And I hope that the doctors can come
Cause I ain't afraid to kill
I ain't afraid to die
Look at the state of mind
I see the TV and Media steady confusion polluting the babies minds to make em blind
So they can patronize and lead em astray but nah
I know my purpose on earth is to bring em the truth that would open up asain eyes
O Gracious God
Look what you made of I
Can't let em plagiarize and take what's mine
Ain't no complaining now
Praying I make it out
Erasing minds
Just for the sake of time
Looking thru Satan's eyes
Will make ya cry
Drown in a lake of fire
Time that you say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Sleep don't exist
In this line of work I profess that will be all the sleep you'll get
Ain't got it inside me to rat on nobody I'm pleading the fifth
Me I dun walked through the realist my nigga my feet is legit
You peeping the drift
They told me to call you and dammit I called you
Word to Allah ain't been able talk
I'm living so wonderfully breathing and walking
And I should be dead up inside of a coffin
Ripping ya battery holder up outta ya fucking controller forever be off and
I hope that he slip and I'm right there to catch him
Gone roll up and wet him on God I'mma off him
How you could you hate on a nigga who's genuine
Strings attached no playing a instrument
How could you hate on a nigga that's making way for the children who livin in innocents
Biting the hands that feed it's sickening
I'm Baby G'sus it ain't a coincidence
Jesus got hated on hated by many
You making a car without putting the engine in
Nigga I'm ready to die
I'm tired this pain
I'm tired of this rain
I feel it inside
Ain't playing the games
Or saying no names
We livin a lie
I'm winning inside
Within me inside
The spirit of God
I feel it arise
