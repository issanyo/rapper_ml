Fuck y'all want

[Verse 1: Mil]
Ayo all my niggas deep in this game
Eat with the kings
You see me deep in the range
Put some heat in your frame
Its murder mil coppin' down south
Bag of stacks
On my way back to fuck philly up in the drought
Pump in this dry block like the month of July
Skunk in the sky, and you know I front what you buy
Got the shit to supply your block
A couple smokers to try your rock
After you take it out the pot
Same cat lickin' off shots
At you while you floss in your Porsche box
Put a couple dots in your soft top
The block rock til' they call swat
And shit still don't stop
We got the same heat that the law got
Murder Mil still gon' clock
Its 12 12 skinnies to the wrong drop
Its the silly cat with the lit watch and the sick spot
With Pimp C, BUNB  you know its hot

And your bitch look like her pussy stanky
With the strap on the heel, slap on the clip
