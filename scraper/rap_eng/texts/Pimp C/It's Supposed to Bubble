PA, PA, and I keep yelling it
But y'all dont hear me though
On the cool, I'm trying to tell them it be
The place that I be laying low, lamping in my hometown
Niggas ain't trippin' so I get's to keep my chrome down
And I be dippin around the spots that niggas pass
Swisha's, serving to the fiends, calling me
Mr. Big Buns, snatching checks from your momma
Making dollars, hoes holla, hustling bring ya drama
Uh, but I don't sweat it fool, I come from where the best ride
Ain't no punks where I'm from on that west side
PA nigga, a lil town with big nuts
Where outta town motherfuckers lose they life on the cut
But we ain't trippin', pass that dipplin'
And it's gonna be all right, soon as I get fried tonight
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho, but ho I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, and water for the Gs

[Hook]
It's Dom Perignon - It's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes (4X)

[Pimp C]
Well I'm Pimp C, bitch, I'm smoking big fat dank
I don't fuck around no mo with that god damn drank
But everytime I get down with my nigga Big Mike
We go and get a bottle of that Dom all night
I got that green monster baby can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha Sweet for days, you wanna try that?
I roll em so big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P-A-T, the east side, niggas sayin' jack
These laws be trippin cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mack
And I ain't trippin flippin then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed

[Bun B]
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho, but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the Gs

[Hook]
It's Dom Perignon - It's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes (4X)
