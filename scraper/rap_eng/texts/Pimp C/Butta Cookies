[Intro]
This dedicated to all ya'll pussy ass niggas, absolutely
Devilish ass niggas, can ya see me bitch?

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I keep syrup in my cup, sitting on the buck
Coming through on these bitches, couldn't give a fuck
You a hater, I'm a playboy
Coming down banging noise
Always in stereo, blowin' on the dro
You talking flight uh, I'm drinking purple sprite
I'm gripping grain uh, I'm showing piece and chain
Uh, cause nigga it's good over evil bitch, uh
You can't knock me off cause I'm getting rich, uh
And all the haters wanna see ya stop
They wanna see you wreck ya Benz, don't wanna see ya chop, uh
But I bought the new one off the lot bitch
Uh, and I got the screens, I just gotta hit the switch

[Hook]
Rude boy shuffle, keep it reggae
Rude boy shuffle, keep it reggae
Rude boy shuffle, keep it reggae
Rude boy shuffle, keep it reggae

[Verse 2]
You see me in the club, you check my voice, uh
You know this richer stallion pussy moist, uh
So pay up and get some good head, uh
And fuck Schumacher and fuck the feds, uh
Cause I know they want to see me roll down, uh
But I just keep coming through in H-Town
Cause that's my city, run the whole thing and nothing but
I keep it grinding, put the record out, and pimp the slut
I make 'em shake their butt
Got them niggas on the cut
These other bitch ass niggas standing around, they in a rut
While I was coming up, you talking 36
I'm getting 55, puttin' a whip on the brick

[Hook]
Rude boy shuffle, keep it reggae
Rude boy shuffle, keep it reggae
Rude boy shuffle, keep it reggae
Rude boy shuffle, keep it reggae
