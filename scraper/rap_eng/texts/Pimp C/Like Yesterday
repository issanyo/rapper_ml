[Verse 1: Pimp C]
We used to ride Cadillacs with the roof pushed back
Open up my do' while paper moves we catch a contact
Livin' our life wrong, nigga wasn't s'posed to live long
These bitches strong or be gone it wasn't for these rap songs
We used to sell dope, cos time don't hold up
How the fuck you gon' eat if you ain't got shit to fold up?
Better keep my mind on Donny Young, doin' 40 for cheddar
We smoke the skunk and poppin' that trunk to make us feel better
My paint done got much wetter, than it was in '92
Bought Mama a Benz for Christmas, doin' shit you boys tryin' to do
And even though we got fame, we love to grip the grain
Even though these hoes say that I change, hey bitch I'm still the same
Dealin' with tha same thangs, just in a new game
Ain't touch no 'caine, try and have shit like Little James
It's dedicated to the trill niggas that paved the way
Stayin' high, tryin'a hold on to yesterday

[Hook: Bun B]
I never thought that there would ever be a time
When a man will wanna kill another man behind a rhyme
I never thought that I would ever live to see
Another man try to come and take my life away from me
I never thought that I would ever have to deal
With the fact that to protect my life somebody might get killed
But I'll survive and I know I'm blessed to say
I realise that tomorrow won't be like yesterday

[Verse 2: PSK-13]
I remember this like yesterday, Saturday nine o'clock, uh
Electric Company backed up by Schoolhouse Rock, shit
Didn't have no bills then, but now I got bills
Seems like I'm only a bill, and livin' only for skrill
I was only 13, mannish, used to run through some chicks
Used to catch the bus to the Majestic and watch Kung Fu flicks
Little league basketball, I'm hoopin', baby, scorin' all the points
After the game I'm chippin' in with the twins on the joints, uh
The lanky motherfucker, I'm growin' up fast
My only dream was to somehow get a fold of cash, uh
These H-town streets produced this game of mine
Forever in a "Fuck you!" frame of mind
I changed with the times, now these boys come with 'plexes
I'm screamin' 'til my dime, baby, Mo City, Texas
I remember this like yesterday, in jheris and braids
Now these boys chopped it down for newer 20s and blades

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
As my day goes by, I wish I could close my eyes
And just expose myself to my past
But I suppose I can't change the path that I chose
Why would I wanna? Everybody knows I just tried to do right
And keep it all tight in my bro's eye
Watchin' 5-0s try, and travellin' first class like the pros fly
I'm lookin' 'round corners tryin' to see where my foes lay
The master of the class like Blowfly
For really I'm so sly, you probably wouldn't buy it
Drugs, I used to ride it, used to hide it
Used to sell it, even tried it, denied it
To the end to my mama but eventually it came out
Her baby son done turned the game out, couldn't take the shame out her eyes
All the lies, all the excuses, when your mama's cryin' it's all useless
Boy you ain't ruthless, you're just your mama's baby
Who hopin' and prayin' that maybe things could be like yesterday
