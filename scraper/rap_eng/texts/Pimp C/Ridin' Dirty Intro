Wassup dog?
Live from the motherfuckin' pen, nigga
It's your boy Smiznoke motherfuckin' D, understands me
But, uh, I'm just chillin' out dog, it's (?) downtown
I get treated like the motherfuckin' pope in here, nigga
Due to the fact, due to the motherfuckin' fact, that I'm real
There's a lot of niggas in here dog, about 120 niggas
As you can hear I don't ever get no peace
But I'm charging every motherfucker I can when I get out there on the street
Once again, like before
