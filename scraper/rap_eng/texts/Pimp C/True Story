Bitch!
True story little bitch

Smoke somethin', Bitch!

[Verse 1: Pimp C]

Drop Seven in the pot, hit it with the soda
Now I got what them Cali boys call A-1 Yola
The south is circles and Atlanta is squares
You lyin' 'bout the prices, it ain't seventeen up there
I'm down with Young Buck and Buck down with Pimp C
But ain't nobody got 'em for ten in no damn Tennessee
It might be twenty-seven or it might be twenty three
Dog and Biz use to come and get 'em for sixteen from me
They had two niggas that would drive the shit back
And they were servin' T, I took his bitch and his 'Lac
His jewelry and his money and his 5.0
She had a baby from Priest, but that's still my hoe
She was translating Spanish with the Mexican
Tryna get a better price, T got fucked in the end
She a square now, Dog and Biz both dead
And pussy nigga T got locked in the Feds
That was his Ferrari in the in the Juvie video
The bitch killed Dog cause he was fuckin' his hoe
Same time, T was fuckin' Dog wife
Shot him from the back, T a bitch for life
So if you see me in the streets, bitch, better keep steppin'
Cause even on parole, I'm ice cold with the weapon
So R.I.P. to Big Dog and his mother
But at least before he died he killed your pussy ass brother

[Hook: XVII]
Aye look, you niggas ain't real
You lyin' on your records
You fuckin' with the trill
So nigga come check us lil' bitch
A true story lil' bitch
True story lil' bitch
A true story lil' bitch
Hol' Up!

[Verse 2: XVII]
Aye look they call me Young Rayful, I keep that white bitch
So drop it in a pot, Pussy nigga get rich
The 'Lac sittin' pretty, all black chrome lid
I keep it occupied by a bad yellow bitch
She stay out on the stroll tryna get daddy rich
A couple pink booties entered with the bitch
I done lost everything that I own but my dick
The music ain't nothin', so I had to push bricks
So I hit the fuckin' slab for the 16.5
Fuck scorin' at the crib cause that shit to high
Bad bitch, fake titties push 'em home in the ride
Pop a Xanax pill, two cars behind
Aye look my nerves fucked up I just spent 82.5
If she get pulled over nigga, then I might as well die
But I'm a make it home nigga, set that bitch on fire
For every 36 bitch I'm making 72

[Hook: XVII]
Aye look, you niggas ain't real
You lyin' on your records
You fuckin' with the trill
So nigga come check us lil' bitch
A true story lil' bitch
True story lil' bitch
A true story lil' bitch
Hol' Up!
