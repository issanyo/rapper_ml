[Verse 1: Bun B]
Now all my ladies to the dance flo'
It's time to do yo thang
You see the piece of chain
You see the pinky rang
Now this one ain't a joke
And this one ain't a game
You got to twurk for my baby brother
Now show no shame
You already know who you came for and why you came
And why you comin', you hear the 8 o 8 drummin'
Let a hata' hate woman, that's what they gon' do
Now pop it for the pimp you see a trill nigga want you
But you gotta be down to fuck with me and my round
You ain't gon' pop it for the pimp, bitch get yo ass out of town
You got to take it off and let me see it, with no delay (with no delay)
And so if you miss the pimp let me hear you say

Pop it for pimp (go) [Repeat x8]
