[Pimp C]
UHH, stayin on the grind, I've been down for mine
Steady pushin white at 16
Fuckin hoes that's fine, smokin' on the kine
Used to mixed the wine with the lean
Now we sip soda wit the barre, twenty inch blades on the car
Choppin' on the road, blowin on the dro
Shinin' in the sun like a star
You can't stay rich if you a bitch
Cause hoes can't hold no bread
Fuck two million, niggas need a daddy
Other pussy niggas just scared
Tell yo' bitch to lemme get some head
You ain't no pimp, I knew you was a clone
I already hit, nigga, it ain't shit, nigga
I done left yo' bitch alone
