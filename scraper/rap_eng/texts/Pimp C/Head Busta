Head busta, heart stopper u dont wanna start partner
Creep up slowly and its loaded nigga plus they all choppas
Lil daddy u can't win, i'm trippin drinking Hennessy
My consciousness to the curb so u better think again
I was raised in the cave in the south where i stay
Treat niggas like slaves i don't use whips i use k's
My temper is like a bubble, u buss it u in trouble
Won't play me since i'm small bet u ain't gon play another
Nigga i'll take ya brother and come duckin take yo mammy
Niggas can't stand me, because i'm comin through on caddy
I know some head bustas who will leave yo ass dead
I ain't never buss a head but i shot until they dead
Come try me i ain't scared, everybody got they time
If u don't wanna die then don't come and fuck with mine
These boys slang a nine, if u ever touch that nerve, they hit up on yo shoulder i'm gone knock it on the curb
