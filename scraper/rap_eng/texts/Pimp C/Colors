[Hook: Pimp C]
I got the colors in my watch and my rang
Piece in my chain bitch I'm pushing everything
Colors, candy red on the Lac
Queen white Bentley keep them strippers on they back
I got them colors, she brown she red she black she white
Got a japper we can bite
Colors, I don't know about y'all
Yellow lights cut the fog, I'm a young fucking dog
I got them colors, like the pimp Ice T
Leaning on a swish, popped up on 3

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Red, blue make green pussy nigga
Promethazine purple lean pussy nigga
Red polo horses it's still fuck Hilfiger
This the underdog young fucking hogg on the trigger
Got candy on the wrist, 7 on my feet
Hoes sell pussy then they come buy me
You wanna see colors? I can show you every shade
Foreign hoes going platinum on my niggas space page

[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 2: DJ B-Do]
I got purple drank, green money, yellow diamonds, red cars
Blue dreams and yellow hoes that suck me up cause I'm a star
I'm a damn fool, think I ain't then come see
B-Do keep it too trill like my nigga Bun B
I know you see the ice it got my body froze up
Lamborghini doors up, you see your ho done chose up
I ain't no pimp, I's a player with a lot of game with a million dollar swag
And I stay popping tags

[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 3: TOE]
Colors in my teeth, piece, and in my chain
And every time I ball my fist it's cause it's in my rang
Step up yo' game VVS's make my neck glow
My watch is skittles, colors change like a rainbow
And you can see yo' boy shining even in the shade
Cause I got yellow ice looking like some lemonade
Smoking on some kush got a nigga feeling great
Got a pocket full of green T O E is getting cake
