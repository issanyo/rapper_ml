Dope stories, I got a few
I got a few

It all jumped in the S.W.A.T.s, Cascade by Hill Store
Me and my nigga Ervin swervin ways to clock dough
A'int tryin' to work no mo'
Puffin' the lo-lo with three and change
Nigga [?] we fiend for dookie roll change
With the jealous sittin' low with Mo's Zinser and the kit
But workin' at Canterbury's ain't gonna bring none of this
So slick, here's the plot give me the pot, fill it with water
And I'ma updat the latest into ounces and a quarter
Of that potent, purest
I cut my average best, cook it up
Sack it fatter, start our own fuckin' business (ha, ha)
Now I'm servin' break dimes, dimes big as twenties
Fuckin' these bitches becoming the king up in my city
Now recognize the chief with the bigger nuts
Yes it's I with the Southside sewed up, sho' nuff
I blown up thanks to you loco smokers
Nigga that's murder yes there's payments on this Range Rover
Fo' thousands over, I gots to get me
Every nigga for hisself and G.O.D. for us all, see

Dope stories, I got a few

(What, what what yo y'all hear me? ya hear me?)
Dope stories, I got a few

[N.O.R.E.]

Gangsta corp, thugged out
We run New York
Throw my gang up
Flamed out, fuck your talk
Pull the red carpet out
Every time that I walk
Why you lookin with the shug looks?
And niggas is weak
[?]
And the pot cooks
Shoot the innocent niggas
And them niggas that's crooks
The life I live
Shouldn't be written in books
Yo my sound scanner
Is off the hook in Atlanta
Then mingle with the Alabama
The Freaknik, L.A
Get my dick sucked in the car
Watch me freak it
Watch me cruise
In and out, traffic smooth
Shorty all restless
I'm like "bitch don't move!"
It's the king of New York
So need not snooze
Go at individuals and their crews
And my thug motherfuckers
Take your jewels
Say "it's all NORE's" for my niggas from P.A

[Pimp C]

I'm comin' out of Houston with some D off in my trunk
So much D off in my trunk that my speakers won't bump
Niggas, talkin' bout the fuckin drought
But bitch I got dope so what the fuck y'all niggas talkin' bout?
Bitch niggas stay broke not hard don't never win
My heroes in the grave and doin' time in the pen
I know that Bill Clampett want to stop all my snow
At six in the morning them hoes kicked in my do'

[Big Gipp]

Nah but fuck them Red Dogs on my mind
Gipp still puttin' it down on the streets every time
Got bars with sticks
For the ones who lick
Yes I sell the shit
Do you want a hit
Yes an ounce is an ounce and a pound is a pound
Yes a ho is a ho if she all up and down
Went from ridin' the bus, to the clean ass 'Lac
Yeah I know it's all good cause they all came back
Microwave swoll, got a grill full of them chunks
Give a fuck what your body [?]

[Mello]

Say, my whole essence, my very presence
Give niggas the chills
My knuckles shit up a grill
Like pigeons on a windshield
Even you bitches get these elbows ridded
Pine-Sol, Clorox, my flow with you stank hoes
Trigger finger itchy, black broken bitches
Runnin up in your crib to see what you got to give me
Oh you's the damn dope man
Who you gon tell?
Who you gon run to after I bail?
Don't play hero tryin' to defend your hustle
Get a shank in your jugular if you dare move a muscle
Tears on your cheek how you sellin dope and weak?
Somebody else done left you dead
Better be glad it was me motherfucker
Put your face off in the carpet
Or next time dear preacher
You'll be the dearly departed
And after goin sour this is a sweet lick
What's yours is mine and I'ma bounce off out like dis
