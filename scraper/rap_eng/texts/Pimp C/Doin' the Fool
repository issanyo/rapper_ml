[E-40]
But I ain't never been a sucker

Potnah big 40 had it like that

Platinum chest (platinum chest) lite brite, love to smile
What a mess (what a mess) horny fucked me on my desk
Kitchen tile (kitchen tile) then she swallowed up the rest
Ask me how (ask me how) a fat ass cum shot on her breast
She said, "It's been a while since I had sex" (what she say?)
She said, "It's been a while since I had sex" (what she say?)

[Pimp C]
Comin down in candy car, smokin on some candy bar
Everyday I'm choppin blades, comin through on old school maids
Got in this game so heavily, just like Frankie Beverly
Silly nigga that Southern girl
Put cocaine up in your world
Cause I'm a young ass nigga on the slab
Comin through in a whippin Nav'
I used to be out on the ave
But now all my keys got the Midas stamp
Change my name to Sweet Jones
Smell like sixty-four dollar cologne
Comin down in burgundy Brougham
And I keep a chip off in my phone
Sweet Jones, bitch! Hold up
Smoke somethin..

.. c'mon c'mon ..
