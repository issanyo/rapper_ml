[Intro: Pimp C]
Steady long, steady wrong nigga
Check one-two one-two one-two bitch
Tony Snow, know'm talkin 'bout?
Jack Tripper, "Three's Company" ho
Percy Mack, Sweet Jones, check it out

[Pimp C]
Uhh, I stay on the grind, fuckin' ho' defined
Get ten all the time, lay my life on the line
Sippin', smokin' 'dro, pimp dick on yo' ho
Legs are on the stove, P-I-M-P on the low
Gators swangin' out, swangers hangin' out
Never bangin', I got work I slang it out
Keep a yellow pro, and a brown horse
And a squad too, I'm the player's choice

[Bun B]
So pimpin' save your voice, hold your breath, shut your lip
Ho you can't handle Bun and you can't fuck with Pimp
We like surf and turf, they call us steak and shrimp
Know we shake and lames are famous but make it simp'
Trillest ever born, G'est ever built
Fuck with us you'll be the deadest hoes ever killed
Live from the corner, direct from the hood
Via satellite bitch, we the Kingz grippin 'wood and it's good

[Raheem DeVaughn]
Hey, if you a hustler, it ain't easy
Da, da, do-dahhhhh
Da, da, do-dahhhhhhhh
And we're still, still
Still on the grind
Da, da, do-dahhhhh
Da, da, do-dahhhhhhhh
Yes we're still, we're still
We're still, still on the grind

[Pimp C]
Uhh, I keep candy girls, big dick in they world
Messin' up they curl, bowlin ball paper swirl
Gotta trap it white, baller candy bike
I don't light it though; get too high, stay too low
I live by the code, extra credit mode
Fuckin' with that Prince I keep a bankroll
Livin by the land, P.A. by the C
Any nigga fuck with Bun he gon' die by me
I'm my brother's keeper, not no movie shit
My life is a film, I'm on some groovy shit
I ain't Smoochie bitch, make girls do this dick
Rich or tongue-in-cheek, bitch you's a Super Freak
Bitch my name ain't Rick, bitch you think you slick
Askin me for rent, you better find a trick
I ain't payin, you need to be payin me
Pussy a dime a dozen but the dick ain't free

[Raheem DeVaughn]
Da, da, do-dahhhhh
Da, da, do-dahhhhhhhh
Yeah we're still, said we're still, still
Still on the grind
Da, da, do-dahhhhh
Da, da, do-dahhhhhhhh
And we're still, still, still, still
Still on the grind
