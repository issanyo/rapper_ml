[Verse 1: Pimp C]
One with a trigger, two with a bat
Three big brothers four
Wanna squal with me, so I guess a brother gotta throw
Tell 'em like this ya better get up out my camp dude
Before I have to pull a gat and get real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin' hurt
Just cuz ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin' 69
Knowin' that ya sippin' on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin' that ya swallowed on a skeeter that I had
You wanna step to me but I don't really think you should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin' good

[Chorus]
Tell me something good, oh baby, baby, baby yeah
Tell me somtheing good, oh yeah, yeah
Tell me something good, oh oh, tell me baby, tell me
Tell me somthing good, oh baby, baby, baby yeah

[Verse 2: Bun B]
What's up with that bulge in ya khakis
You wanna pack a gat but you still ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gang load of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cuz by yourself you runnin' to the floor
I seen your kind before man you nothin' with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin' when ya chillin' with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin' up some daisies
Now crazy you wanna be
But punks with no heart ain't hard
They just waitin' for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep you weak self locked in ya hood
Cuz without your boys I'ma have to tell you somethin' good

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
See brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin' all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check your gal and what she did in the past
Cuz if you know like me, you would drop her real fast
But I ain't bout to do her cuz I'm scared of that disease
Cuz she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player cuz Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test are you HI positive
But instead of gettin' checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check your blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step I'ma drop on ya fast
And pump off lead like bullets in your ass
I didn't do your girl but your sister was allright
Took her to my homeboy's caddy last night
She waxed my jimmy and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back and the girl just threw me
Turned me on my stomach and she scratched me on my booty
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty little girl

Tell me something good, oh baby, baby, baby, yeah
Tell me something good, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Now let's talk about these part time hustlers
Throwin' up a set that you ain't down with
Boy ya nothin' but a buster
Talkin' bout you down to pull a jack
Boy you couldn't jack a car when your tires caught a flat
I hear you talkin' all that pistol poppin' in the place
But if my boys ran up on you you'd probably pull some mace
I see it in your face you ain't got the heart to swing
Your hands be in your pocket when it's time to throw them things
Now every single day another brother pulls an act
He's tryin' to be trill but I can see that yellow stripe down his back
It's a fact of life I learned and understood
A brother ain't nothin' if he can't come and tell you something good
