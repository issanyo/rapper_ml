(feat. Foxx & Pimp C)

[Chorus:]
I Stay Fly As A Eagle Mane, (Oooh)
Fresh Like Candy Paint, (Fresh)
Sharp As Razor Blade, (I'm Back Baby)
Gotta Stay Playa Made

[Webbie:]
A Couple Karats In Tha Illo's Dat Glist Glist Glist
Gotta Momma Up In Hemming Dat I Miss Miss Miss
I Ain't Use To Have Nuttin Now I'm Rich Rich Rich
To Tha Bentley From Tha Cutlass Now They Piss Piss Piss
We Blowin' Purp In Tha Front, They Pouring Yac In Tha Back
A Couple Gats In Tha Back And Ain't None Of Us Gon' Rat
If I Ain't Already Ripped 'Em, My Brotha Boosie Dun Flipped 'Em
We Get High Like A Missile And We Be Clean As A Whistle
I Lay Dat Dick Like A Winner, Jus' Ask My Girls In Virginia
They Jus' Can't Stand When It's Soft And Wanna Scream (Ahhhhh) When It's In 'Em
I Be With Pimp, We Be Pimpin, From San Francisco To Memphis
I Cut Tha Baddest Of Bitches, And Then Fa' Get When I'm Finish, (Who?)
I Jus' Talk A Lil' Shit And Then It's A Hit When I'm Finished
I Drop Tha Top When It's Pretty Or Pop Tha 6 In A Minute
It's Savage Life Don't Fa' Get It, (Naw) Trill Fam In Tha Building
We Gon' Need Some Mo' Space Cause Money Stack To Tha Ceilin' Yea

[Chorus: x2]
I Stay Fly As A Eagle Mane
Fresh Like Candy Paint
Sharp As Razor Blade
Gotta Stay Playa Made

[Foxx:]
Who U Kno' Can Play Some Linen
Been Gangsta Since Tha Beginning
Stacy Adams Not Tha Tenni's And All My Woman Be Friendly
Use To Shop At J.C. Penny's, But Now I Be On Some Playa Shit
Use To Wear Dem J's But Now I Be On Dat Gata Shit
Lookin Like A Million Some Niggas Be On Dat Hatin Shit
We Gettin' Money Now Ya'll Niggas Be On Dat Lata Shit
Fall Off In Tha Boat Shootin Dice With Niggas With Businesses
Flyin' In Yo' Grandma Preaching, Can I Get A Witnesses
Same Fella Use To Rock Tee's Now What Tha Difference Is
Now I'm On Some Grown Man Shit And I Ain't Ignorant
I Should Be In Ebony Takin' Pictures With Ebony
And Steve Harvey Since I'm Not Yo' Average Celebrity
I Mingle With Tha Richest, Took Pictures With Raw Bitches Dat U See On Television With A Ass Like Delicious
Face Like Eve, Red Carpet Walking Bitches
U Can't Keep Me Out Tha Mirror Cause I'm Cleaner Than Some Dishes

[Chorus: x2]
I Stay Fly As A Eagle Mane
Fresh Like Candy Paint
Sharp As Razor Blade
Gotta Stay Playa Made

[Webbie:]

We Got So Much Out Here To Lose And U Don't See 'Til U Copp
And All Dem Dudes Don't Keep A G To Ya' Cop
And I Remember, He Told Me Don't Stop
Rest In Peace Boo I Owe U A Lot
Got My Phone Called Boosie, Say Let's Go To Tha Top
So My Lil' Dog Doin 5, I'm a Hold Him A Spot
40 Thousand For Tha Bracelet Jus' To Go With Tha Watch
Don't Disrespect Me, Give A Fuck Bout If U Kno' Me Or Not
I'll Pull Up In A Mean One, U Ain't Never Seen One
Tha Red One, Tha Black One, Tha Platinum, Tha Green One
Ashley, Shanika, Or Keisha, Or Tina
A Front To Tha Back To A Face Full Of Seamen
Real Life Street Nigga, Always Gon' Be One, (Always Gon' Be One)
Look Me In My Eyes, Guarantee Dey Gon' See One
I'm Fly As A Eagle, UGK My People, I'm Trill Young Savage, Dat's One Thang About Me, I

[Chorus: x4]
I Stay Fly As A Eagle Mane
Fresh Like Candy Paint
Sharp As Razor Blade
Gotta Stay Playa Made
