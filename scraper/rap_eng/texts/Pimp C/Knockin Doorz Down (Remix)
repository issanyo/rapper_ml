Letra de "Knockin Doorz Down (Remix)"

[Sample]
...

[Hook: Pimp C]
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
R.I.P. to Robert Davis, he the king of the south
Anything else said, need to shut your fucking mouth
I'm down with Lil' Flip, and I'm down with T.I.P
If them niggas come together, know how much paper we could see?
Slim Thug and Z-Ro, y'all still bullshitting
Need to sit down, take a tour, there's too much money to be get
Paul Wall and that Koopa still ain't talking
Money speak, all that bullshit keep walking
Y'all niggas got the game fucked up
All you record company people need to shut the fuck up (shut the fuck up)
Cause y'all keeping up that bullshit rapping
The white people laughing at 'em, that's what's happening
The same stupid ass niggas still ain't figured it out
Long as they stay divided, man we gon' run the south
Y'all need to get up out the dumb shit
I got a bread truck, get up out that crumb shit, nigga

[Hook: Pimp C]
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

[Verse 2: P.O.P.]
Hey, I got the bass quaking, trunk shaking like tambourines
In the H, where them paints sweet as tangerines
Where they bouncing on fours like trampolines
It's the great state of Texas so I can't believe
All the conflict and plex that we carrying
It's time to get rid of the beef like vegetarians
I'm 'bout stacking bank, everyday
So I pay attention to the vets and I ain't talking 'bout a Chevrolet
Keke the Don, Pimp C a king
Lil' J, the owner of the squad, H-Town, we the team
It ain't no I in that, you trying that, you be fatigued
But if we man up and press, we could lead the league
We some all-stars, the roster is sick, man
I ain't gotta start, P.O.P.'ll be the sixth man
Rap-A-Lot's a southern empire for the assist, man
Three, two, one, swish, and...

[Hook: Pimp C]
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

[Verse 3: Lil' Keke]
You see the slab outside, it look good, don't it?
Masterpiece, dripped out, with the fours on it
Trunk airtight, speakers and them show lights
Holding, cops around, nigga get your shit tight
Let me tell you the meaning of coming through
When the seats off-cream and the candy is dark blue
Approaching downtown, knocking doors down
Tint eleven slabs in a single-file line
Flossing, swerving, the rims is glistening
They gotta see the wood cause the top is missing
I sleep on dreams cause it's paper I'm chasing
My roots come from Texas, this Pimpalation
The barre is tasty, the Benz is spacey
I gotta show my class so these haters can face me
Riding up the boulevard, crushing the sidewalk
Showing my surround while I'm knocking the doors off

[Hook: Pimp C]
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

Knocking, knocking doors down...
