Double shots of hennessy

And the switcher got a room key
Act like you auditioning for a video or movie
Bend towards the floor I want your hands where your toes be
Ima Squeze all on you booty all nasty
Done made 18 girl im legal you can harass me
Cash and a bemmer I can't seem to find a bad beat
A big fat ass like Trina make me happy

Show lil thang up girl I ain't tryin to
I'm trill young savage boo must I remind you
All I need is one night and a few minutes

Tell me is you bullshitin or is you cool wit it
Our baby parents ain't got nothing to do wit it
I want a J. Lo yonce' coke bottle shape object
Cook soul food bake cake straight out the projects
A female savage straight bad bitch prospect
Baby Phat, Apple Bottem big booty Gucci and Prada
I be lookin for the kinda lil mama thats bout some dollars
350 dollar bottles thats all she want to swalla
And if you ain't a big balla she ain't even trying to holla

(Verse 3:)
I need something like Nia Long make you wanna bring her home
Feed her bone and don't even treat her wrong
Ever seen that movie monster ball
Bend over like Halle Berry on that part when ole boy knocked her off
I'ma dog I like it soft I like to rub I like to grip
To tell the truth I like them loose cause me and my thugs we like to flip
I like the friends who get involved all the broads say I'ma trip
I like the picture takin pictures while you catch it on ya lip
I like to sneek and take ya shoppin when ya niggas start to trip
Drink my liquor out the bottle on his couch and watch you strip
Stick a couple fingers in ya make it tickle make ya drip
Make ya holla like I'm robbin ya like a pimp and then I dip
I want to get an ounce of hydro get alicia eyes low take her to the suite and make her hit all of her
High notes
Strapped up fa sho cause I don't trust no hoes anybody can go Eazy E perfect example

(Chorus:)
