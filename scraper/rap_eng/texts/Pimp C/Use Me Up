[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin my mind
I'm trippin and I know it cause I'm all nerved up
Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin my car
And everyday it get better, I cain't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin, "She ain't nothin but a scrub"
But she make me feel high like I'm, hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need, and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I cain't help myself, I know that I'm trippin
But she got it goin on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my, credit card
You know she get it cause ya know that... (Chill, C) I know, G
I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin all limp
Why I let her play me? You cain't understand!
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man...

[Chorus: Bill Withers sample]
I-yi-yi-yi-I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin used
Oh, you can just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and STILL ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin out them ducats and them, Kroger sacks
And everybody wonderin why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, axe me why I wanna dis her
I told her cause her lovin ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin out, and Byrd say I'm trippin, too
But this time I just can't LISTEN to my whole crew
Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But '92 came around, and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand!
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man...

[Chorus 2: Bill Withers sampled]
I-yi-yi-yi-I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up

I-yi-yi-yi-I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin used
Oh, you can just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
To sum it all up, I'm breakin ALL my rules
Cause she got me droppin off her little brother to school
I be gettin bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
UGK sayin peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin Pimp C - uh, just a use me up!

[Outro: Bill Withers (Pimp C)]
Ah-hah well oh, BA-BY, BA-BY, BA-BY (Yeah, a-just use me up)
BA-BY, ah-hah well oh (Uh, a-just use me up)
BA-BY, BA-BY, BA-BY (Yeah, a-just use me up)
BA-BY, ah-hah well oh (Uh, a-just use me up)
BA-BY, BA-BY, BA-BY (Yeah, a-just use me up)
BA-BY, ah-hah well oh (Uh, a-just use me up)
BA-BY, BA-BY, BA-BY (Yeah, a-just use me up)
BA-BY, ah-hah well oh (Peace out for '92, in the nine-tres)
