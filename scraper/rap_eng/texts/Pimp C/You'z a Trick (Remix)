Woah, Woah, Woah (You'z a trick)
Woah, Woah, Woah Here we go!

Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp

Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)

[Verse 1: Lil Flip]
Once again I'm back with the flow to make all ya'll haters mad
I'm at the club every night but I ain't trickin' cash
Poppin' tags, poppin' AKs, I'll whip your head, boy
Don't ever, ever, ever play with my bread, boy!
Run up wrong, I'mma hit you with this lead, boy
You just scared cause pimpin' ain't dead, boy!
I bet you thought I wasn't comin' back strong, huh?
In ninth grade I had a pocket full of stones, huh?
Now when I pull up, I got hoes in the car with me
I'm strapped up, I ain't got no bodyguards with me!
I catch your gal out of pocket, I'mma deal with her, chill with her
You'z a trick, bitch, cause you live with her!

[Hook: Lil Flip]
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
(Remix!)
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
(Ladies and gentlemen)
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
(Introducing Pimp C!)

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
I'm a pimp to my heart, these other niggas tryin' to start
[?] is too tender, mackin' club, bitch, I'm a member
I'mma stick to the code, stay "mack on a bitch" mode
Hoes been tryin' to steal my dick 'cause I stay ballin' and I stay throwed
Keep my mind on my money and a pocket full of cash
Wet a bitch up with champagne like Damon Dash
Always stomp the gas when I'm cruisin' in my Bentley
Jive couldn't afford Flip 'cause I was leavin' they pockets empty!
Them hoes couldn't tempt me, a bitch is with me simply
I'm cold on the mic and I keep me a yellow dyke
To get out on the grind and keep a nigga rich
And if you ask her who her daddy, she say "Pimp C, bitch!"

[Hook: Lil Flip]
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Now, niggas be talkin' about the hoes that they be knockin'
How they keep 'em steady jockin' on they tips, constantly clockin'
I don't take their shit to heart; take it with a grain of salt
'Cause in their mind they probably really think they macks-it ain't their fault!
Got yourself a couple jewels, a ho or two, and a cup
So you call yourself a pimp when that is not what the fuck is up
Take your girls into the strip, but you are not tuned
And it's a thin line between a pimp and a fool in a costume!
Your hoes respect your mackin'?  I hadn't really noticed
'Cause she keep eyeballin' me, look like the bitch is losin' focus!
Your stable wide open like a church on a Sunday
You feelin' like you got your stallions on lock, but one day
A player like myself will come through with some true spit
Take her from your "same ol', same" and show her some new shit
Put some trill mackin' on her back and get to rollin'
Fool, your hoes chose me, so don't be actin' like they stolen, you'z a trick!

[Hook: Lil Flip]
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)
Don't spend no money; I'm a pimp, I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money?  You'z a trick, you'z a trick! (You'z a trick)

[Outro]
You'z a trick! (repeated until end)
