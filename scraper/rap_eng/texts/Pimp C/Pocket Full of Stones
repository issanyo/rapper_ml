I gotta pocket full of stones (Hey mothafucka) 7x

[Verse 1: Bun B]
When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't moving keys I was barely moving dimes
Started coming up fiends recognize my face
I was paying off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You want to freebase I got them hubbas for your ass
A boulder on your pipe and you can have a megablast
Cash went to stacks, then it went to piles
Thanks to the dope fiends hitting crack vials

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Back in the days they used to run up saying Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuck away from me hoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, you can't change they ass I guess
So them mothafuckas tweak until they take a Brilo pad in they chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones

[Hook]
I gotta pocket full of stones (7x)
And they won't leave my ass alone

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
I bought a Cadillac dropped it to the street top
Got me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho paid good in the city set'
Had a fucking ho for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
(Bun B) Then what you did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked the shit myself and started passin out them hubbas
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and got a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Got a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now the laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Living real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm selling crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientele is growin
Geakin' so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a bump
Fuck Black Caesar niggas call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggas fuck wit other niggas shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is coming up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody making green
Gettin cash for putting stones in the pockets of the fiends

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Bun B]
Keys are moving daily, the product selling fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Hit the cut with fifty, bought a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hubba tens
Got a pocket full of stones starting all over again

[Hook]
