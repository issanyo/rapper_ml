[Pimp C Rap:]
My car candy coated, never voted
At the age seventeen
To the game I was quoted
Got a whole foreign tree in my flyest spur
My neck froze, and fire
Worth my coat and shoes mink fur
Y'all niggas ain't no pitbulls, you curred out

You ain't what this shit about
About is Pimp C and the princess of the south
Chunkin it up for that Texas
Lettin 'em see them blades chop

[Verse 1:]
I got a dude he's the flyest in these streets
Down on the corner got the block full of heat
Lookin' for a girl that don't run her mouth
She ain't a hoe all over town
He can call me baby, he can call me his boo
But he call me D-girl, 'cause I got that oooh

[Pimp C Rap:]
I make my records for them boys
With the golds in they mouth
The thugs on parole with them
O's in they house
The niggas with the heart
In the glassy, glassy soft
Spent my last fifteen years representin' for the south
I'm a OG rock balla, twenty chop crawla
Young girl bout to choose a pimp
Man ain't no need to stall her
I wish that all on I-10, put my life on the line
Now young Pimp is goin'
Platinum with miss Brooke Valentine
