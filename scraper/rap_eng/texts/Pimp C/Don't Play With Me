Fuck boys snitches and hoes
Make way for the trill slammin cadillac does
Represent for pop trunkers

Chunkin deuces out the roof fuckin up the side shows
From the pros to begginners

To the chicken dinnas
And grind all the binnas
And need to get it out
Find a tight trap
And then i said it out
Bet cha bout them dolla
On the best cause im back

Fat joe is cood coke and the crack and the flesh
Young jeezy the snow man

Trigga finga waitin to spray

And u ont wanna see any trill niggas at a conjuction
