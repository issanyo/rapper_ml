[Intro: Pimp C]
I see these niggas in the street mane
I don't believe 'em niggas mane
Them niggas keep talking about they having things mane
Their jury looking funny mane
Know what I'm talking about mane
Get yo mind on yo shit mane

[Verse 1: MC Krok]
I'm bumping Pimp C in the whip
Underground Kings mane that's my shit
The Naked Soul Of Sweet Jones
Hydrocodone on the hands free phone
Man I got a pocket full of stones
With them big ass rims, 20 inch chrome
A fucking legend from the dirty south
If you disagree, I dunno what you talking bout
Long live the pimp with them big rims
Pocket full of stones, smoking Mary Jane
Smoking Mary Jane, smoking Mary Jane
Bitch the game belong to him
Can't forget Bun B
It's just a Texas thang
That's my nigga Pimp C

[Hook: MC Krok]
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key
DJ Screw by the gallon
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key
DJ Screw by the gallon
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key
DJ Screw by the gallon
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key
DJ Screw by the gallon
