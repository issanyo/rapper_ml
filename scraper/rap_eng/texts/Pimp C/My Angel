[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I been on top of the world, and been on bottom of the grind
I came through in the fresh cars, playin' surround
I been in the city sellin' crack at the dopefiends
Tryin' to come up Houston be strung out on promethazine
I used to smoke fry, wasn't scared to die
Every day when I wake up I wanted to get high
My momma came and got me from that devil dope
And keep me good even though I used to choose hoes
And sometimes with her older family members a lil' bit wrong
But that's how I came up, makin' rap songs
I been in this shit since 16, comin' up
And puttin' motherfuckers up on this thang up in this rap scene
Uhh, and when they took my money
Momma never ever looked at me funny, now check it out
The manager I had wasn't shit
The nigga stole everything and snorted coke like a bitch
My momma stepped into this shit and went to every town
That we came to, every city puttin it down
And when them niggas wanted to kill me, my momma said
Fuck that bitch, I know you motherfuckers feel me, uhh
So when you see me in the city with my T lady
Best believe we comin up and we ain't livin shady
I'm her baby, and that is my only momma
I'll kill you bitch-ass niggas if you brang the drama

[Hook]
My angel... an-gel, that angel is mine, annn-gel
I found my an-gel, annn-gel, that angel is miiiine
Annn-gel

[Pimp C]
Yeah tight, that's right
I was young, I used to get sick a lot
Now I'm rich puttin' it down with Rap-A-Lot
I used to have the flu, cold, and pneumonia
Niggas always tried to come and try to move on ya
Cause in my city you either got to be a hustler
Or you're out on the corner, smokin' crack and a buster
So I had to come up fast
When niggas come through I put that {?} on his ass
Ay, ay, ay

[Hook]
My angel... an-gel, that angel is mine, annn-gel
I found my an-gel, annn-gel, that angel is miiiine
Annn-gel
