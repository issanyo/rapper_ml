[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uhhhhhhhh!
If you know like I know you would get down on the floor
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisher full of dro
We can get down for my dime and we can fuck on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha fucking with me for?
Every lady ain't a ho and every ho ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't fuck around with no punks
Ride with me she holding a pistol while I'm whipping and popping the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems long as she hear what the fuck I said
Pimping ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here living by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm looking at you, you choosing me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm shooting for stars, we headed to the top

[Hook: Pimp C]
I'm staying true, I'm out here whipping my Mercedes
Fucking with the midnight ladies the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm banging Screw, my young girl looking fine
We staying out here on the grind and keeping money on our mi-ii-iind

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, got to feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster ass persona so hard that it can dent
Stillin the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leaking fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust
Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leaking out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you got to go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Got to pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Got to play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's your turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a fuck how you feel

[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the South
This scary ho don't wanna know what this about
Cause I stay country true down to the core
Dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws
Feel it tighten up don't stop, don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars
Fuck the D.A. fuck the law
I fuck the snow
But I love a pro
Like flat backers
I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer
Drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker
Bitch around me man I'm a mack her

[Verse 4: Bun B]
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of dro and them powder bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki, and 10 kilograms in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's 1.5 mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is ticking, time is pressing
No second guessing, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
