"Back-front back, and side to side"
"Back-front back, and side to side"
"Back-front back, and side to side"
Never let ho ass niggas ride

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside southern robe is fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from nigga that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2: Smoke D]
Tight white interior candy apple red lex bitch
Solid gold snowflakes with the honey gloss and
Tighter than a sheeps dick
Hittin the switches make the ass jump
Hood tall, solid gold true chrome jacks up the ass, wha
Smoke be the jack town mack
In a caddy six fuckin fif-two
Hittin hard than a nigga daddy
And all you hoe gettin dick, in yo back
Goin smack from a country ass gold teeth
Chicken eatin' mac
Cuz I’m a playa that get sweet and gooshy
I take your bitch to my crib and throw a party on that pussy
And watch the niggas jock a G
Big cars, big money, big nuts, shit its Smoke D
Wit the smooth g ride gettin scandolous
Pussy, I dismantle it
These hoes can’t handle it
Fine ass big booty bitches in my ride
Cuz the Smoke got that front, that back and side to side, nigga

[Pimp C]
It's pimpin pimpin, I'm hittin switches, checkin out my strap
Makin sure these snitches, ain't stoppin riches, 5-O on my back
But I keep on dippin, steady pimpin, kickin, how's about the winter man?
I'm chillin, hidin and winnin, pockets feelin fat
[Bun B]
And I come round your corner shinin, leanin, ever so sunnin
Gangstas put down their gun and
Women and children come outside and start runnin
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whoopin whips
Never goin out out like simps, walkin your block with gangsta limp
[Pimp C]
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
But the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash
[Bun B]
I gots my stash so I switches, keep on burnin
And these tyres keep on turnin
I be rollin through your scene, flashin green, freaks be yearnin
To be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinkin Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
It's the Gulfway Boulevard menace
Tearing up all four motherfucking corners on your block bitch
Nutting but that bunny hop
[?] daily routine, my shit is plush
Interior crush, and nigga I'm too clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
In your soul, so let a nigga take control
And do what the fuck ya been waiting
To see, and that's me rolling on three Dayton's
With one of them hoes in the air, just hanging up there
Sitting fat than a bitch, and I don't care if I'm just puffing on red here
Rolled in a fronto leaf I got from little daddy in NO
And even though I wish I had some indo
But I don't really give a fuck, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
On a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right

"Got front and back, and side to side"
Never let broke gold diggers ride
"Got front and back, and side to side"
"Got front and back, and side to side"
Never let broke gold diggers ride
