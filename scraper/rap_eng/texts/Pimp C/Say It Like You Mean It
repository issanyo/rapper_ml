[Verse 1]
All this noise of rock and roll
Feels a lot like we’re ready to fold
Feels a lot like we’ve lost the goal
Lost our minds and lost the soul of a nation
A couple lost generations
Maybe we're the ones lost and losing patience
I’m still looking for a correlation
Between what to say and how you roll

[Pre-Chorus]
Spit it out
​Yeah, spit it out

[Chorus]
Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
But I still don’t believe it

[Verse 2]
Oh my soul, wonder where’d you go?
It never did feel like my control
I never could fit in microphones
I never could fit in stop and stand ovations
Give me the songs of the nation
'Cause it feels like law lacks motivation
See, I’m still looking for a correlation
Between what you say and how you roll

[Pre-Chorus]
Spit it out
Yeah, spit it out

[Chorus]
Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
But I still don't believe it
Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
(But I don't believe it!)

[Post-Chorus]
Spit it out
​Like you mean it
Spit it out
Like you mean it, yeah
Spit it out
Like you mean it
Spit it out
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
You say it like you mean it
But I still don’t believe it
