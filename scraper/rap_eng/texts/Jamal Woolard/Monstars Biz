[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Your girl been hot since Corduroys
Since quarter waters and all the boys used to
Try to beat like the corner boys
'Cause they heard the pussy wetter than them Dorney rides
Fuck with who? Fucks with you
As long as them checks clear like Huxtable
I’m known to hang, with a thug or two
Niggas that only do, what a thug would do
Ask about me, the feds watch daily
Getting more cheese, more bread than a deli
And I'm getting' love, fan mail like Melly
And I throw it up, twelve o’clock when I wheelie
I'm in the A, I scoop my nigga Grave
Coupe gotta be beige, you gotta get paid
Ain't nothin' worse than being a broke bitch
I always got crack, I tell ‘em to smoke this

[Verse 2: Gravy]
I'm in that custom coupe, 650 drop
Eighty thousand down, off the lot
White tee with the ice grill off the block
Snitch niggas, bitch niggas wanna call the cops
I'm only bursting my yayo off the docks
Silencers [?] from the Glock
Out of town selling grams, a hundred a pack
Five star resorts with [?]
Riding jetskis with the Audemar on the sleeve
[?] pinky ring [?]
H-class diamond, a nigga still rhymin'
Dreams of the charts, soon-to-be climbin'
[?]
Gucci vest on, teflon lining
[?] sea food [?]
Get the dope through customs, they’re not bustin’
Feds, don't trust ’em, skip town, duck 'em
Cop a few more hammers then I bust 'em
Automatic's my specialty [?]
