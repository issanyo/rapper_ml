[Verse 1: Gravy]
Dirty Money, Desert Storm
If u a hustla hommie where all that crack you sling
I could fall off and bounce back like a matress spring
The DA got me on some gun charges in PA
When I was slinging coke down in Renu, VA
Had to sell my Murcielago up on Ebay
Got a lil stop in Jersey, thats my pit stop
Monstars, A-Team, Ransom n Hitchcock
Got the game in griplock wit the yay in the ziplock
20 to a gram, stashed in a can of spam
Revolvers are my favorite guns cause they dont jam
I could sell you some Ak bullets for have a man
I'm back in this bitch by popular demand
Till the feds come & get me for them credit card scams
For now I'm heat in the strip
And nigga getting warm
Dirty Money, Desert Storm
We got the world in our palm, Whats hood?

[Verse 2: Ransom]
Whats hood is this niggas is getting money
The shit is funny
They wasn't there when the kid was bummy
Its dark so you only arrive when the shit is sunny
Its about to get cold in the game so get a skully
I'm like a little kid in the dirt thats getting muddy
A cocky dude, your jaw dropped when you got the news
Desert Storm all of a sudden you start coppin clues
I got alot to prove, Lets get it straight nigga
You ain't gotta go down south to get Chop N Screwed
You might freeze if you see my cannon
My whole family carry arms like Eli-Manning
Dont be brave, cause your kids won't be saved
N I'm a treat them like pitbulls that dont behave
And I spit like i'm ready for world war
Serve raw N I get it crunk like
N I get it crunk like I live in the 3rd ward
I dont got a house dawg I live on third floor
Get a deal spend my whole advance on my first porshe

[Verse 3: Hitchcock]
Fall back with your wack demeanor, I clap the Nina
I dont care if you pack Karinas[?]
Who you know raps is meaner, jack your beamer
And still pick up dust like the vacum cleaner
Your niggas ain't fucking wit Hitchcock
Or Ransom, The anthem, this is our year in a phantom
Putting niggas on to come back to school
The reason the whole hood saying Thats Ma Dude!
Match my jewelz, yellow n white gold
I'm ice cold but I'm red hot when the dice roll
Everything I write is my life told
And I blaze haze so I crush it in the dutches & light those
Those roaches send me the haze
So gettin that dirty money like like Fendi and Grave
Empty the gauge, simply behave
I won't stop till I'm the chrome drop or Bently wit shades (ugh)
