[Verse 1: Gravy]
Dirty Money be a team, weed bricks and [?] beams
Lambos and beamers, [?]
In my borough we hold it down hotter than Phoenix
I got a forty carat, count two bricks for forty thou
Find me in St. Louis, you're blowin' on some kiki
Tokin' [?], what's it to you?
Nicki Minaj, she the future
Fresh outta Jamaica, [?] suitcase with the paper
Silencers to help you meet your maker
No burial, cremator, we don't give 'em ultimatums
My life is like Satan, even God couldn't save him
I'm in the Chrysler on the highway racin' the Viper
Scope with the beam hittin' niggas like sniper
Clinton in Sing Sing, my comrads is lifers
Hold your head up for all my niggas that's on Riker's
To my Trinis and Guyanese, crew hold your lighters
Ghostwrite for so much niggas I got arthritis
I got the magic touch and I ain't talkin' 'bout Midas
Divided companies, little weaklings minus the minors
[?] a half a brick in her vagina
And go down South to Carolina
Come back up and flip pounds of marijuana
Motherfuckers, truck full of llamas

[Hook∶ Gravy]
So it has to be rat that we sold ya
I got that purple with me nigga, let's roll up
I got my gat with me, don't make me fold ya
The hollow tips man, to kill you dojas
So it has to be rat that we sold ya
I got that purple with me nigga, let's roll up
I got my gat with me, don't make me fold ya
The hollow tips man, to kill you dojas

[Verse 2∶ Nicki Minaj]
I used to be a effin' baby like Weezy
Seen me with the nigga Gravy, now they hate me
Fuckin' with Minaj, lil mama, ain't the thang to do
I been hot since your hat had a kangaroo
And I keep a good bar, like a can of brew
So it's Mrs. Goodbar, no thanks to you
Fendi call the fight club, tell 'em that the match on
Who the fuck I gotta done before they catch on?
I'm the one bitch, I ain't never stutter
The toast I'mma run with never need a butter
Queens on the map, yeah, Queens is back
First bitch to talk smack about Queens get yacked
C'mon, I take trips out of town with bricks
Got surveillance on the whips, they behind the six
But I got the kind of face that will make the J
Say alright, lil mama, I'mma get you a break
Then I set up shop where they coppin' them thangs
Gotta to keep the hidden cam on top of the range
I'm the head honcho, get work from papi
And dead pancho, couldn't ID the body
So they said John Doe, got hit up with the shotty
And his Bed-Stuy ho

[Hook∶ Gravy]
So it has to be rat that we sold ya
I got that purple with me nigga, let's roll up
I got my gat with me, don't make me fold ya
The hollow tips man, to kill you dojas
So it has to be rat that we sold ya
I got that purple with me nigga, let's roll up
I got my gat with me, don't make me fold ya
The hollow tips man, to kill you dojas
