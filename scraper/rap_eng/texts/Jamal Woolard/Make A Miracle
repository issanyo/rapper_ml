[Verse 1]
Feeling dark, gotta see the doctor
It's about my hunger for your heart
And it's your life we could have been through
Angels eyes, it's like heaven inside

[Pre-Chorus]
As I turn to ask the reason why
As I walk oh woo oh oh, as you walk down by
You can tell me a million lies
As I walk oh woo oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Show me to your heart
All I need is you to make a miracle
Ah hey ah ah ah ahah
I need a miracle, a miracle of love

[Break]
(oh oh oh oh)
(give me that)

You know I'm spoiled little daddy, stomps the floor
We can do it on Fifth Ave in the Department store

[Chorus]
Show me to your heart
All I need is you to make a miracle

[Bridge]
Feeling dark, gotta see the doctor

And it's your life we could have been through
Angels eyes, it's like heaven inside
