What were you doing before you hooked up with Puffy?

[Jamal (as Biggie)]
Pharmaceuticals, you know how it is

[Faith]
Typical. So... are you a bad guy tryna be good or a good guy tryna be bad?

[Jamal]
I'm just someone tryna make it. How you start singing?

[Faith]
Emmanuel Baptist Church Choir

[Jamal]
Huh (laughs) typical

(Faith laughs)

[Jamal]
I don't know what I'll be doing, but I ain't think I'll be doing this

[Faith]
When I was a little girl, everybody told me singing was my destiny, but I was thinking I would make a career out of doing the beat box (laughs)

[Jamal]
Nah, I know you ain't saying you know how to beat box

[Faith]
Don't be trying to play me out

[Jamal]
Give me some old school flavor

[Faith]
You gonna rhyme on it?

[Jamal]
I'm gonna tear it down!

[Faith]
Aight! haha

(Faith starts beatboxing)

[Verse: Jamal]
Some call me Biggie or B.I.G
I'm just chilling in the place to be
Now I ain't tryna preach or teach some knowledge
I'm just tryna call you [?] Faith Evans Wallace
Tada!

[Faith]
Ahahahaha

[Jamal]
I like your laugh, it's sexy. So why don't you let me do that?

[Faith]
Do what?

[Jamal]
Make you laugh. Can I be that man?
Can I be that man?
