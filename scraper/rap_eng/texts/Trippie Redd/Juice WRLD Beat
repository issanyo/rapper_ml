[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Chill huh
Speak of the money I made it
I popped some pills I'm faded
My songs on her playlist
She love me when I play it
Run up on me
Get the pop u
Nigga you got to be kidding
I got my head in my smithing

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
Everything she do in the world
[?]
Aye
I know she like a nerd
I keep it thirty no purde
Boom, boom, boom
Blow up itâ€™s going to hurt
