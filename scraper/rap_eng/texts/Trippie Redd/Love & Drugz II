[Intro]
OZ on the beat, yeah

[Verse 1: Kodie Shane]
Sometimes I feel so alone
Even when I'm not alone
I don't pick up but they still call my phone
She hate that shit and I know
L-O-V-E, H-A-T-E
Love me and hate me, you know how it go

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
T-R-I-P, bitch, R-I-P
I cannot answer the phone 'cause I'm gone
Tryna fight all the demons in my zone
I'm at home all alone, home all alone
They want it bad but they can't take my soul
Man, they can't take my soul
Can't take my soul, can't take my soul
Can't take my soul, can't take my soul
Can't take my soul, can't take my soul, no

[Chorus: Kodie Shane and Trippie Redd]
Love, and drugs
Dealin' with this pressure
Love, and drugs
Smokin' on this pressure

[Verse 3: Kodie Shane]
But they want my soul
Yes, this I know
It's just a test and I know (Test and I know)
Murder she wrote, I wrote it too
I almost lied under oath (Under oath)
You say you hate me, I quote (I quote)
I love this girl, yes, I know (Yeah)
I tell her, "Shut up", she don't (Ayy)
Sometimes don't know what you want
No, yes, I know what you want
Diamonds they wet like a boat

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Sink in that wet, hope I float
I hope a nigga don't choke
Murder what, baby, she wrote
Murder what, baby, she wrote
Yeah, ayy
Love and drugs, love and drugs

[Chorus: Kodie Shane and Trippie Redd]
Love, and drugs
Dealin' with this pressure
Love, and drugs
Smokin' on this pressure

[Outro: Trippie Redd]
Love and drugs
Love and drugs
Love and drugs
