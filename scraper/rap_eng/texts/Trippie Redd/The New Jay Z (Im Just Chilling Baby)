[Intro]
Why
It's lil 14, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, I'm just chillin' baby
Blowing lots of dope, got me feeling lazy
Sipping lean, bodeine brazy
Rockstar lifestyle, the new Jay Z

[Verse]
I been getting money all by myself
By myself, don't need no help
By myself, by myself, don't need no help
I'm just worried 'bout my Bonnie, I don't need nobody else
I'm just worried 'bout my Bonnie, don't need nobody else
But god
Bad foreign bitch says she wanna fuck the squad
Big Rari coupe swerving out the parking lot
Gettin' all the money, pockets on extra knots
Pockets on extra caking
Why these fuck niggas keep hating?
God told a nigga keep his patience
Now I'm just tired of waiting
[?] durag bags, I'm tired of getting payments
Cut some niggas off, now I been paid ever since
Lifeâ€™s what you make it so make it the shit
These songs what I make and so I make 'em these hits
Bad lil bitch I put some dick on her lip, ayy
Young savage, but I'm swagging
Spit flames like a dragon, ayy
Flying carpet bitch, ayy, this ain't Aladdin
Paper or plastic, that's how I be rapping woah
It can get tragic, pull up blasting, automatics
You a pussy nigga, put that on gang ho
Gettin' money, diamonds shining in my chain, woah

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, I'm just chillin' baby
Blowing lots of dope, got me feeling lazy
Sipping lean, bodeine brazy
Rockstar lifestyle, the new Jay Z
