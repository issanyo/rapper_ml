[Intro: Al Pacino & Rich The Kid]
I told you, man, I told you!
Don't fuck with me! I told you, no fucking kids!
No, but you wouldn't listen
Why, you stupid fuck?
Look at you now
Huh?
Money way, only way, y'know what I'm sayin'? (ice way)
Lil bitch!

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Was up trappin' early (early)
She bad and bougie, but whippin' a birdie (huh?)
My cup is so dirty (what?)
Your diamonds don't shine, my pinky a 30 (30)
Pour up the pint, that's so clean (so clean)
The rims of the Bentley cost 14 (skrrt)
Ain't doin' no talkin', the red beam (red beam)
My bitches bring bitches, young nigga, we flexin' (huh?)

[Post-Chorus: Trippie Redd & Rich The Kid]
Ayy, so much green on my street like it's Grove (whoa)
Ayy, made a lot of money on the road (yuh)
Ayy, now they book me, 10K for a show
Ayy, Actavis in my drink, I'ma pour, yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Like an orthodox
I'ma beat her box, beatin' off her fuckin' socks
30 got a mop, shoot you, look like chicken pox
I be whippin' rocks, fiends hit me, they sniffin' rocks
I wuv Trippie Redd
I'm a trap star
Ayy, hope I don't crash, do the dash in a NASCAR
Ayy, it really is a fast car
It's a movie just like Pixar, movie just like Pixar
Get shot, I turn your ass into clip art
Yeah, I turn your ass into clip art
Boy, you is a retard, on the go just like a go-kart
Makin' art just like Mozart, art just like Mozart

[Bridge: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, ayy
Early morning trappin'
Early morning  trappin'
Early morning  trappin'
Early morning  trappin'
Early morning  trappin'

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Was up trappin' early (early)

She bad and bougie, but whippin' a birdie (a birdie)
My cup is so dirty (lean)
You niggas is fraud, your diamonds is blurry (blurry)

Racks all in the cabinet (racks)
They was hatin', I was rackin', stackin' and relaxin' (whoa)
Dream of 100 bands, now I'm ridin' 'round in the Lamb' (Lamb')
She bad and bougie, I'm makin' movies

She wanna hop out her skirt (skirt)
That's when she poppin' a Perc' (huh?)

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Was up trappin' early
