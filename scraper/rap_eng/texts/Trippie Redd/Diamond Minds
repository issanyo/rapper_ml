[Intro]
Listen, yeah
Listen, yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Listen and your dreams will unfold (Listen)
They thought that I had sold my soul
I can't do that shit, that shit slow
Know my mind worth more than diamonds and gold, yeah, yeah
1400 'til I fuckin' die
Pussy nigga, fuck yo' life
Cross me it's like suicide
We be shooting shit like Columbine
You been sleep on me like lullabies
I'm just really tryna know you're mine

[Verse 2: Elliott Trent]
I'm just really tryna know you're mine
It's hard tryna find love on a mission
You've been way too distant
I tried to tell you I rock with you, baby, you ain't wanna listen
And now you say I'm actin' different
Shawty, I got so much weight on me
I needed you to wait on me
Got me thinkin' that you with me while I'm out here tryna build
Telling me you miss me, now you all up in your feels
I know, promise I'd never sell my soul
I can't do that shit, that shit slow
Know my mind worth more than diamonds and gold

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
And that's when I told her, yeah, yeah (Tory)
Okay, I'ma give it to you how you like it, yeah
You gon' ride on it like a bike, yeah, yeah
Hopped out the whip yelling, "What's good?" (What's good?)
I'm a trap nigga that can fuck good (Fuck good)
You like hood niggas and I know that (And I know that)
So I pull up on you laid up in the all-black (In the all-black)
Good sex, good weed, good all that, fall back
You so bad you get the sex and a callback
We still litty, shawty I can see your physique still litty
Shawty I can see already, shining like the streets in the city
And I know you're tryna leave with the sheets all wetty, oh
You playin' just like an actress
You gon' give it to me like the ones at the strip club
When I put the stack in, you know I ain't lackin'
It's 1400, One Umbrella, we comin' back in again
I did that, shawty
And you know you like when I hit that, shawty
Double grips back, then I gets that, shawty
Let me let my nigga Trippie sing that for me

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
