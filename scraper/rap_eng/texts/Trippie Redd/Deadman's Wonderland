[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
You gotta use your fuckin' head, man
Promise to keep up these people head, man
You gotta get this fuckin' bread, man
'Cause if you don't then you's a dead man
'Cause if you don't then you's a dead man
Oh, 'cause if you don't then you's a dead man
Oh, 'cause if you don't then you's a dead man
Oh, 'cause if you don't then you's a dead man
Steady countin' all this dough
Never bendin', never foldin'
They comin' for me, killin' floor
Tell the reaper take my soul away
Oh, just tell the reaper take my soul away
Oh, just tell the reaper take my soul away
Oh, just tell the reaper take my soul away
Oh, just tell the reaper take my soul away
You gotta keep your fuckin' head man
Promise to keep up these people head man
You gotta get this fuckin' bread man
'Cause if you don't then you's a dead man
'Cause if you don't then you's a dead man
Ooh, 'cause if you don't then you's a dead man
Oh, 'cause if you don't then you's a dead man
Oh, cause if you don't then you's a dead man

[Verse: FOREVER ANTi PoP]
You gotta listen to yourself, man
'Cause everybody got opinions
You gotta do this shit yourself, man
Remember nobody believed ya (whoa)
You went broke on your own, nigga (broke, whoa)
You ain't even have a home, nigga (home, whoa)
You left your momma back home, nigga (home, whoa)
You left your grandma back home, nigga (home)
Just imagine how your sister feels
Four years and you still here (still here)
But she love your ass to death man
You gotta get this fuckin' bread, man (yeah)
'Cause if you don't then you's a dead man
'Cause if you don't then you's a dead man
If you don't then you's a dead man
'Cause if you don't then you's a dead man
I made a beat for a check, man
I sold my single for a check, man
I sold my soul for a check, man
