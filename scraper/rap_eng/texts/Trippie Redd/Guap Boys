[Trippie Redd]
I paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Bitch,i flipped that on a gang
It's fourteen hundred gang
Bitch,this [?] from New York
Go for it with a gang

Fourteen hundred gang
Eighteen hundred gang
If you're talking down
Lil nigga,you a lame
Fuck that boys living new
We bust a nigga brain
Take that nigga chains
Take that nigga chains
Hundred 'fore I have
Fourteen hundred for the whole thang
Rollin' bust down
Marco Sison dancing in the rain
Where the bitch dance
