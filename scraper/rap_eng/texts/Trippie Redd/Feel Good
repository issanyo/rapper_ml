[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Woah, what a wonderful night
Woah, watch me glisten in ice
Woah, don't this shit look real nice?
Woah, tryna feel all the vibes
Yeah, is the feeling's real?
I don't know what's the deal
And I'm just tryna feel, feel
Tryna feel your love
Ayy, ooh your love, it fill me up
Ooh, tryna feel your love, ayy
Ooh, your love, it fill me up
Ooh, when I'm with you
I feel in touch with myself
I just love you so much

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Ooh, I love you dear
Yeah, and I love the feeling
Can you feel?
Yes I can, but is the feeling real?
I don't know, I just keep tryna feel
I said the feeling real
Think the feeling real
I think the feeling real
Ayy, don't tell me, baby, need a chill pill
'Cause I ain't with that shit, baby, you need to chill, for real
Woah, woah, woah
Baby, yeah

[Verse 2: Khalil]
Baby, when I'm pullin' up
I touch your body, got me convinced that I'm all in love
Booted, bitch, I'm on the drugs
She thinkin' that I'll never leave her
But she's trippin' 'cause she better not give me a reason
Don't get me confused with them niggas, baby
I'm rollin' so deep
With bitches, they thought I was pimpin' baby
Got so much to see
I'm noticin'
You niggas switchin' your cliques every week like some hoes and shit
Catchin' feelings for my older bitch
I see her, act like I don't know the bitch

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Woah, what a wonderful night
Woah, watch me glisten in ice
Woah, don't this shit look real nice?
Woah, tryna feel all the vibes
Yeah, is the feeling real?
I don't know what's the deal
And I'm just tryna feel, feel
Tryna feel your love
Ayy, ooh your love, it fill me up
Ooh, tryna feel your love, ayy
Ooh, your love, it fill me up
Ooh, when I'm with you, I feel in touch with myself
I just love you so much
