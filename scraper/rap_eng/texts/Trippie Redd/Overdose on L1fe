[Intro]
Ooh, ahem

[Verse 1]
I think I'm overdosin'
Tryna keep up with the fuckin' motion
My mind out in the open
Just tryna stay fuckin' focused
I think I'm overdosin'
I done took too many of the doses
My mind out in the open
I'ma keep up with the fuckin' motion

[Chorus]
Baby girl, that pussy go damn
Baby, let me bust it open
Let me get up in your ocean
Baby got me overdosin'

[Verse 2]
Don't you lie to me, lie to me
You tryin' me
Took your soul, lil' baby gone ride with me
You are mad, bitch that's fine by me

[Bridge]
I love when I overdose
I OD off of your love (love)
I OD off of your love
I OD off of your love (love)
I OD off of your love (love)
I OD off of your love

[Chorus]
Baby girl, that pussy golden
Baby, let me bust it open
Let me swim up in your ocean
Baby got me overdosin'

[Outro]
Lie to me
Lie to me, don't lie to me
