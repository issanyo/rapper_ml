[12 Hunna on the beat]

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Riding round round round with it
Yeah you know baby I'm committed
I ain't never lie, tell a tale
Baby you can back me like a mother fucking bail
Then I told that lil baby, can you please come here
Let me whisper something in your ear
Let me stick it in your derrière
Waiving your hair don't care
Back home you don't need me
Yeah I want to beg on my knees but
I'm gonna keep it G, so
Now I can't be on my knees
Woah Woah Woah
Why you gotta be this wild
Yeah I want you, you want magic
Why you wanna trip out today

A bitch gonna hate you too good touché
Why did, why did the blu-ray, stop disc

Sipping tea baby, ain't no hoe up in my jeans baby

Moving in and out
Swerving in and out
Switching them lanes
