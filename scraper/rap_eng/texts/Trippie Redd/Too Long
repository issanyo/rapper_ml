[Verse 2: Lil Wop]
I been in the trap too long
And this moonrock got me too gone (aye)
Got a trap phone, got a jugg phone
Lil nigga, you can't fuck with me, you move wrong
Try to take something, I'ma do your whole hood wrong
I was in a rut so I fuck her with my shoes on
And my shoes on, diamonds drippin'
Get they drool on
Hit her from the side, she soakin' wet
Who turned the pool on
Chopstick turn you to some food
You front your move on

My hundreds blue Sonic hedgehog, hedgehog
VVS' shine when I talk, when I talk
Giuseppe steppin, that's how I walk, how I walk

[Outro: Trippie Redd]
And this shit ain't change

Bool up in that wraith
Bitch you know I'm feeling great
Eating all year

Yea, I came and stole your date
