[Intro]
I thought you love
I thought you love (I thought you love)
I thought you love (Love!)
I thought you love (Love!)
I thought you love
I thought you love (Yeah x7)

[Chorus]
She said she love me
I think she love me not
She said she love me
I know she love me not
She said she love me (so in love, love, love, love)
How could you do this to me? (Yeah!)
How could you do this to me? (How could you do this?)
How could you do this to me? (Too, Yeah! Yeah!)
I thought you
I thought you love

[Verse 1]
Shawty know I'm the best that she ever had
So I ain't mad
Knowing that I ain't do no bad
Leave you in the past
In this car imma real real fast
I got jetlag
Hope that a young nigga don't crash
I loved you bad
All you did was just show your ass
I'm kind of glad
Gotta stay focused on this bag
I got jetlag
Gotta go get a hunnid flat
I'm talking cash
I can't have any pussy cash

[Chorus]
I think she love me
But she love me not
She said she love me
I know she love me not
She said she love me
She to just love this car
She say she love me
I think it's cause I'm high
I think she love me not
She say she love me
I know she love me not
She say she love me (So in love, love, love, love)
How could you do this to me? (Yeah!)
How could you do this to me? (How could you do this?)
How could you do this to me? (Too, Yeah! Yeah!)
I thought you
I thought you love
I thought you love me (yeah!)
I thought you love me (yeah!)
