[Intro: Julia Michaels]
Mmm, ah

[Verse 1: Julia Michaels]
Stay right there, get away
I need space, I told you yesterday
"Slow the pace down," but then I see your face
Can we do that tomorrow? (Can we do that tomorrow?)
'Cause now you're moving in on my skin
I move back with my lips
It goes against my better judgement
'Cause I, 'cause I want it, ah

[Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels]
And I'm gonna be clich√© here for a minute
And tell you that I've been hurt before (hurt before)
So I think I'm gonna need another minute
To not hurt no more (no more)

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Every time I see you, I just wrap myself around you, yeah
Jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious, I just like the way it feels
When it's us, baby, when it's us
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
I jump, oh, I jump

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Look at me being soft
Cut it off, my mind is getting lost
From your touch, I can't afford the cost
Of me losing myself to you (losing myself to you)
And I didn't want these feelings, when I brought 'em
But I know you know exactly when I caught 'em
And I'm trying not to think about it often, but, ooh

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Every time I see you, I just wrap myself around you, yeah
Jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious, I just like the way it feels
When it's us, baby, when it's us
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
I jump, oh, I jump

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd]
Jump, jump up in this foreign
Used to sleep on couches, now the boy is really tourin'
If they sleep on me, I tell them haters go and sleep it away
Yeah, fell in love, but it ain't no trust
If it ain't no trust, then that girl can't be my love
'Posed to put my love above but instead you gon' sleep it away
Yeah, like an earthquake, yeah
I'm dealing with another lil' heartbreak
Man, I wish I'd never met you in the first place
And that karma gonna get you in the worst way, yeah
Don't throw your love away, don't throw your trust away
You always run away, I wish you would fucking stay
But I guess we need another break

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Every time I see you, I just wrap myself around you, yeah
Jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious, I just like the way it feels
When it's us, baby, when it's us
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
I jump, oh, I jump
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Julia Michaels]
'Cause all I do is ('cause all I do is, 'cause all I do is)
Jump
Mmm, yeah
'Cause all I do is ('cause all I do is, 'cause all I do is)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jump
('Cause all I do is, 'cause all I do is)
('Cause all I do is, 'cause all I do is)
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
('Cause all I do is, 'cause all I do is)
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
Jump
