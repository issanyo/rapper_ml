[Chorus]
Haven't smiled in a while
But yesterday was too wild
I guess I wanna know how you feel
Yeah, how you feel, yeah
If you were here, be so proud
All my thoughts are so piled
I guess I wanna know how you feel
Yeah, how you feel, yeah
I'm tryna pour my heart out
How the fuck I'm 'posed to sound?
I guess I’m tryna know how you feel

[Verse]
Like cookies to a girl scout
A nobody, a mushmouth
I guess I'm tryna know how you feel
How you feel

[Bridge]
How you feel about me, feel
How you feel about me, feel
How you feel about me, feel
How you feel about me
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel
Woh (how you feel about me, how you feel)
Woh (how you feel about me, how you feel)
Woh-woah (how you feel about me, how you feel, how you feel about me, how you feel)
Feelin' (how you feel about me, how you feel)
How you feelin' (how you feel about me, how you feel)
How you feelin' (how you feel about me, how you feel, feel, feel)
How you feelin', how you feelin', how you feelin'-in'
Woh (how you feel about me, how you feel)
Woh (how you feel about me, how you feel)
Woh-ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel, how you feel about me, how you feel)

[Chorus]
Haven't smiled in a while
But yesterday was too wild
I guess I wanna know how you feel
Yeah, how you feel, yeah
If you were here, be so proud
All my thoughts are so piled
I guess I wanna know how, how you feel
Yeah, how you feel, yeah
I'm tryna pour my heart out
How the fuck I'm 'posed to sound?
I guess I’m tryna know how you feel
