[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Keep on fucking around, ye

Keep on fucking around, ye
My whole squad and I get out, ye

[Verse: Sunny2point0]
Uh
Pussy nigga talking shit we might just feed him some sticks
Matte black 40 Glock just to match my kicks
Balenciaga runners overlapping you niggas
Word round town Sunny bossin' on niggas
Iced out my mouth now I'm flossin' on niggas
Think and I'mma lick yu get your man down quick
Louis pants with the strap I'm never goin' slip
On 1400 Wealthy Villain I'll die for this shit

[Chorus]
Keep on fucking around, ye
We get to busting the rounds, wuhh
Another man down, wuhh
Another man down, ye
Keep on fucking around, ye
We get to busting the rounds, wuhh
Another man down, wuhh
Another man down
