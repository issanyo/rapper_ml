[Sample]
Remember, there's always tomorrow
P. Soul on the track

[Chorus]
Uh, ayy, uh, ayy, uh
Can you rap like me? Huh
Uh, ayy, uh, ayy, uh

[Verse]
I gotta get my fresh paper, boy optimistic, inflicted the premonition
My vision a place I visit while lifted
Moolah I get it get it, the life I live my decision
They told me to go and get it, I got it so now I'm winning
Revolution of fury, the lean got my vision blurry
Ballin' like Stephen Curry, gold fangs in my mouth so purty
Trippie bring demolition and I ain't talking no derbies
Absorb your flow like I'm Kirby, the lies you tell will not hurt me
Try to reach for the stars if people don't get too far
They want all of the money, all the expensive cars
It's few people that ever make it but yet I still gotta go hard
A lot of artists that make it are evil, hearts black as tar, yeah
Okay and this for every rapper that had a shot at sending me
Your efforts ain't getting you anywhere in this industry
Lyrically demonically dominate your flow endlessly
My venomous rhymes wine and dine on you mentally
Motivated the motivations, said got too much chemistry
Fatality, like Liu Kang, told me to finish him
Even the Hulk couldn't take this much intensity
I'm the bullet in the barrel in the gun that shot Kennedy
Mind is racing 'bout hating, contemplation with Haitians
Jamaicans sitting on 5G pacing, back and forth waiting in Dayton
You get the picture, don't take this
Boy this life is real, you couldn't fake this, throw it up, regurgitation
Can't shit on me, you constipated
Is you mad cause we do this on a daily basis?
Yeah, or is you mad cause we made it?
Every day faded, we out here paper chasing

[Chorus]
Bitch, ahh, ayy, ahh, ayy, ahh, ayy
Can you rap like me? Huh
Ayy, ahh, ayy, ahh, ayy, ahh
Can you rap like me?

[Outro]
Lil bitch, 1400 gang
You know what the fuck going on, 1400 boys
Huh, yeah, Canton, Ohio shit
Buh, lil bitch, haha
Slatt, you know what the fuck going on
Hunners a bitch, bad Milo, ahahahah
Random thoughts to you bitch
On a love letter to you bitch
