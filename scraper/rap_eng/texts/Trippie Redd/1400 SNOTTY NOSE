[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
1400 gang
What you claim? What you bang?
Chopper by my side
You got no aim, got no aim
Hit you with this chopper
Blow your brain and get away
Hit you with this flamethrower
Then get 'em with the gang

[Bridge: Trippie Redd]
Goddamn
She flexing triple X
Like goddamn
Big guap on me everyday
Like goddamn
You wanna be the gang
Like goddamn
You can't take this shit away
Like goddamn

[Verse 1: Chris King]
You can't take it away
No, no, you can't
Glock fresh out the box but it won't jam
Let me remind you bitch niggas just who I am
Play with her pussy once the bankroll come again
I said we had no way, we had a plan
And she love my flight special
Check out my wingspan
And I made it off a hundred grams, a hundred xans
Got your niggas Instagram like somebody get they man
Gang gang to the brain brain
1400 snotty nose, the same thing
I'm with Trippie Redd, say the same thing
Puffin cookies when lane change
Since I child I seen strange things
Tatted my face but show no pain
I be mind fuckin' with her whole thing
Said I bust the burner before the bros blink
You said you wanted your way, you got it
HKs, AKs, and SKs, we drop em
All you see us use yellow tape, precaution
If you talking sideways then that's it
When you gonna give the gang some action?
[?]
Pedal to the metal, let it, I'm gassing
[?]
She sniff the white like my [?]
Glock .40 made his face look [?]
[?] then waste it right after
[?]

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
1400 gang
What you claim? What you bang?
Chopper by my side
You got no aim, got no aim
Hit you with this chopper
Blow your brain and get away
Hit you with this flamethrower
Then get 'em with the gang
