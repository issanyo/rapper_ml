[Intro]
Turn me up, Fu

[Verse 1: Baby Goth]
See me in the Pink Ferrari
I got on a hoodie 'cause my neck so icy
If you say I'm baby, then I'm gon' take a breather
Baby crusing court side rolling up a fatty

[Chorus: Baby Goth]
R-r-rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in weeks
Rolling, rolling, rolling up and passing that OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
Swerving in this brand new Wraith (Skrt, skrt)
Talking all that shit but, nigga, you ain't got no case
You's a dumbass nigga, sending shots, ain't got no aim (Ain't got no aim)
You's a dumbass nigga if you think that bitch your babe (You think she)
Think she with me right now, iced out
Me and Baby rolling 'til it's lights out (Lights out, yeah)
Need some cleaning, Lysol (Pssh, pssh, pssh)
I said I'm rolling with the gang, got pipes out

[Chorus: Baby Goth]
R-r-rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in weeks
Rolling, rolling, rolling up and passing that OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna
R-r-rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in weeks
Rolling, rolling, rolling up and passing that OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna

[Verse 3: Lil Xan & Baby Goth]
I don't pop no molly, but I definitely fucked a Molly
They gonna tell me "sorry" when I get my first Grammy
Rest in peace to granny, all that matters is my family
Rest in peace to granny, all that matters is my family
Ice is heavy on my wrist now (My wrist is heavier)
We rolling in a smoke cloud (We always smoking, yeah)
Get too high, I'm never coming down (Never coming down)
With the family, fucking up the town (Town, town)
Now I'm swimming in the ocean with my jetski robbing something
Got a girl I really like, the type that you could really see
I hope this girl is feeling me, yeah
I said, I hope this girl is feeling me, yeah (Feeling me)
Baby, bust me down like a brand new watch (Bust me down)
If you're feeling low, let me turn you up a notch (Up a notch)
And this sick drip brighter than a new Grammy
Out here puffing fatties, swaying with the palm trees

[Chorus: Baby Goth]
R-r-rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in weeks
Rolling, rolling, rolling up and passing that OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna
R-r-rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in weeks
Rolling, rolling, rolling up and passing that OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna
