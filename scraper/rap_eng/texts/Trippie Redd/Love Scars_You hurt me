[Intro]
Ayy
Lil 14, yeah

[Chorus]
You used to say you in love
I used to say that shit back
Taking that shit from the heart
Now look where the fuck where we at
Girl you got me just going out bad
Love scars and you got me real sad
Lookin' like you had a past
I was hoping that shit was gon' last, oh

[Verse]
Shawty, I just want your love for a minute
I be captain baby, you can be lieutenant
Swear I lose my mind every time that I'm in it
You won't get a dime, naw naw not never
Spend it, spend it
I been here for a minute, minute, ayy
Playin games with me shawty
This is not no scrimmage, scrimmage
Swear that I did it, did it
I do it, I does this, I does it, ayy
Shout-out my bloody, my whoadie
Lil nigga, and shout out my bousins, woah
I swear I'm bloodied up Bs
Never throwing up, Cs, ayy
These niggas is disgusting
Something like the disease
Your bitch pussy nasty as fuck
She got a little bit of yeast
Gettin' all the money, count it up
Countin' all my green, woah ayy
Girl you got me going out, bad
Girl you got me real sad
Devil in me make me mad
You used to say you in love, yeah, ayy
Shawty you so fucked up
You used to say you in love
You got me so fucked up
Shawty I don't need you anyway
I just sit back in my Balenciagaâ€™s
Sippin' that lemonade
Mixin' it with Hennessy
Dominating any enemy
