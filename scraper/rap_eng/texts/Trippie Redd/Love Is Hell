[Chorus: Phora]
Ay, Love is hell, yeah, I know that shit
I be over shit, but I still can't get over you
Do it all for you, you know I got you, yeah
Baby, I got you, uh
Love is hell, yeah, I know that shit
I be over shit, but I still can't get over you
Do it all for you, you know I got you, yeah
Baby, I got you
Love is hell, but I'd rather fight demons with you
Than live amongst the angels without you
Baby, I can't be without you, uh
Love is hell, but I'd rather fight demons with you
Than live amongst the angels without you
You know I can't be without you, without you, oh
(Can't be without you, without you, without you, oh)
(You know I can't be without you, without you, without you)

[Verse 1: Phora]
Yeah, I sip this Hennessy straight, take it straight to the face
I've been slurring my words, now I can't see straight
Fuck love all year, I've been going through hell
Is it real? Is it fake? Sometimes you just can't tell
They say you gotta have trust, can't even trust myself
(Can't even trust myself)
Can't even trust myself, oh yeah
First I hate you, then I love you, now you leaving
I just don't want to be left with all these demons
'Cause they say that

[Chorus: Phora]
Love is hell, yeah, I know that shit
I be over shit, but I still can't get over you
Do it all for you, you know I got you, yeah
Baby, I got you, uh
Love is hell, yeah, I know that shit
I be over shit, but I still can't get over you
Do it all for you, you know I got you, yeah
Baby, I got you
Love is hell, but I'd rather fight demons with you
Than live amongst the angels without you
Baby, I can't be without you, uh
Love is hell, but I'd rather fight demons with you
Than live amongst the angels without you
You know I can't be without you, without you, oh

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, you know I can't be without you
You my baby, yeah, I can't live without you
I'm so crazy about you (Yeah)
Can't imagine having babies without you
You my baby, you my ride, yeah
With me, baby, is where you reside, yeah
Yesterday I had no time (Wassup?)
But guess what? Today, baby, I got time, yeah
I'm so crazy 'bout you, yeah
Thing One and Thing Two, yeah
Bet them demons gonna lose, yeah
They would sleep on me, let 'em snooze

[Chorus: Phora]
Love is hell, yeah, I know that shit
I be over shit, but I still can't get over you
Do it all for you, you know I got you, yeah
Baby, I got you, uh
Love is hell, yeah, I know that shit
I be over shit, but I still can't get over you
Do it all for you, you know I got you, yeah
Baby, I got you
Love is hell, but I'd rather fight demons with you
Than live amongst the angels without you
Baby, I can't be without you, uh
Love is hell, but I'd rather fight demons with you
Than live amongst the angels without you
You know I can't be without you, without you, oh
(Can't be without you, without you, oh)
