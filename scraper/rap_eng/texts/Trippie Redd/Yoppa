[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Chris Brown]
Flexin' on you, I'm your father (ayy)
Choppa spittin' lugees like a motherfuckin' Llama (ayy)
Got the big racks on me, bitch, I'm thumbin' through them commas
Presidential Rollie got me feelin' like Obama (woo)
Blew up big, got me feelin' like Osama
Pussy rappin' 'bout that choppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa (yeah)
Know I keep a Yoppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa
Know I tote that Yoppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa, keep a Yoppa

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Keep it on me, it stay on me at all times
Don't sleep on me, don't speak on me, it's suicide
Aim it at your brain, it's insane how them slugs fly
Codeine purple rain, is this what it means when doves cry?
Never leave my piece, .40 under the seat
Protect my family 'cause I don't trust the police now
Love my choppa and I know she loves me
Ain't no safety 'cause it got the lemon squeeze

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't even try
You ain't 'bout that life
You ain't ready to die
Choppa tell the truth, it expose your life

[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Chris Brown]
Flexin' on you, I'm your father (ayy, father)
Choppa spittin' lugees like a motherfuckin' Llama (ayy)
Got the big racks on me, bitch, I'm thumbin' through them commas
Presidential Rollie got me feelin' like Obama (yeah)
Blew up big, got me feelin' like Osama
Pussy rappin' 'bout that choppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa (yeah)
Know I keep a Yoppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa
Know I tote that Yoppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa, keep a Yoppa

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Keep a Yoppa, my nigga, I keep a choppa
If you put it in, your gun jam, sayonara, c'est la vie
Say you got a problem, my nigg, so what's the problem?
It can go down right now, just slide up
Should think smarter, should think better
And I ain't 'bout to argue with a grown ass nigga
I ain't here to play no games, give a fuck who you claim
Choppa on me, this the gang, I let it bang

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't even try
You ain't 'bout that life
You ain't ready to die
Choppa tell the truth, it expose your life

[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Chris Brown]
Flexin' on you, I'm your father (ayy)
Choppa spittin' lugees like a motherfuckin' Llama (ayy)
Got the big racks on me, bitch, I'm thumbin' through them commas
Presidential Rollie got me feelin' like Obama (woo)
Blew up big, got me feelin' like Osama
Pussy rappin' 'bout that choppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa (yeah)
Know I keep a Yoppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa
Know I tote that Yoppa, bitch, you know I keep a Yoppa, keep a Yoppa
