[Intro: Trippie Redd & Lil Yachty]
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh, yeah
Huh, Big 14 Bitch
1400 yeah, 1400 yeah, 800 yeah
1400/800 lil' nigga, flexin' paper nigga
You know what the fuck goin' on
Yeah, ayy, hold on, ayy

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Real niggas live by the code
Catch a nigga lack on my fuckin' bros
I don't fuck with opps so y'all niggas' hoes
Met a few of 'em, y'all could get exposed
With my nigga too, he'll up the pole
Put it to your nose, leave your body froze
Do a drill, catch another body though
Like, that's my fuckin' hobby, yo
I'm a real nigga, in the field witcha, do a drill witcha
All my lil' niggas keep it trill, pop a couple pills witcha
Big Trippie keep it real witcha
I'm a real nigga, in the field witcha, do a drill witcha
All my lil' niggas keep it trill, pop a couple pills witcha
Big Trippie keep it real witcha
Lil' nigga let them llamas fly, leave a young nigga so traumatized
Totin' gats jit, all my niggas ride
Don't make me make another mama cry
Do a drill, catch another homicide
Fix your face, nigga, you got butterflies?
Chopper at your throat and you afraid to die
Big 14, fuck the other side
Jugg, jugg, got all this jewelry
Man, this shit ain't new to me
Your bitch new to you, she ain't new to me
I ain't really with the fucking foolery
Glistenin' in these fucking diamonds
Bad bitch and I'm fucking shining
I got a bad bitch from the fucking islands
Taking trips to the fucking islands
Guess these guys don't realize
When they talking fly, man, it's suicide
Don't talk, do a nigga do or die
Nobody else, nigga, you and I
Big chopper, I'ma let the bullets fly
That red dot right between your eyes
I don't play, pussy, wish a nigga try
'Cause that'd be the night niggas die
Niggas act like I ain't G.O.A.T. or somethin'
Take a trip, go chill with the bros or somethin'
Call a few bitches, chill with some hoes or somethin'
Niggas be flexin', they bold or somethin'
They don't want that war, go home or somethin'
Internet flexin' with the phone or somethin'
You a lil' pup, nigga, fetch a bone or somethin'
Niggas male strippers when them poles bummin'

Hit the pent like I'm Derek Fisher
Fuck the bitch right, then I kiss her
Ride around town, you the one who licked her (ew)
Ha, real player like my pops (pops)
Thirty round in my Glock (doot-doot-doot)
We run it, not opps (ha)
Ten toes on my sole, niggas wouldn't double dare to cross the big Boat (yeah)
Last year, I was 19, had 300K inside a Kith coat (yeah)
Pull up deep, wide body nigga
