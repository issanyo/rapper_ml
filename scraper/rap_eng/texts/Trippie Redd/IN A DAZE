[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Uh
Skrt skrt aye
Yea
Skrt skrt aye oh

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Peacoat in a purple range
Blowing dope out the stupid dank
Wasn't love it was fucking pain
I'm just tired of the fucking hate
I rock the crowd with the fucking rage
This purple cup got me in a daze
This little thot got me in a daze aye
This little bitch got me in a daze
Aye

[Verse: Lil Wop]
Lil Wop 17 and lil 14
Aye bad bitch
She straight out a magazine
Trap house jumpin' like a trampoline
I pipe up at all my shows
I jump off the stage
Since lil wop still got the guap these hoes be chasin'
If she don't fuck she get kicked out, cause I ain't waiting
Skrt skrt skrt skrt skrt Rari they already seen
I hotbox the whip my eyes low it like an Asian
Wop still gotta sauce these bitches wana taste it
I just copped some new Margielas with no laces
I got bitches foreign
Uh Uh Uh, can't do no basic
They be hating why all these niggas hating

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Peacoat in a purple range
Blowing dope out the stupid dank
Wasn't love it was fucking pain
I'm just tired of the fucking hate
I rock the crowd with the fucking rage
This purple cup got me in a daze
This little thot got me in a daze aye
This little bitch got me in a daze
