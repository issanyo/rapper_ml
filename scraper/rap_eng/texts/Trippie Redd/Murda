[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Oh-oh well, yeah yeah
Dubba AA-Flex
Oh wit' it, anything wit' it, takin' my time wit' it
And I ain't scared to die

[Pre-Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I told 'em I'm dyin' wit' it, I'll never change up
They say that how I'm livin' that I need to wake up
I'm slangin' that iron wit' it, they'll never frame us
They want me dead but I ain't scared, I got my change up
This is the sound

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
It's a murder, yeah, they screamin' out murder, yeah
They steady screamin' it's a murder
They gotta take my soul, I been thuggin' since a youngin'
Motherfuck which way he go, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Motherfuck that talkin', run down on him hunnid shots on dat drum
Said they want me but I ain't scared, we go to war where I'm from
Most of my niggas up in jail and half got killed by a gun
187 we be wildin', all I know is redrum
When I say that it's up they gon' it lay down
2 up under my belt, we don't play around
400 shots in the car when it go down
Step on all of them before the sun down
Steady talkin' like he wit' it, he say he gon' kill me
You know for a fact I don't stand down
Bust your head for my nigga, I shoot 'til it's empty
Ain't no shakin' back when I run down

[Pre-Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I told 'em I'm dyin' wit' it, I never change up
They say that how I'm livin' that I need to wake up
I'm slangin' that iron wit' it, they'll never frame us
They want me dead but I ain't scared, I got my change up

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
It's a murder, yeah, they screamin' out murder, yeah
They steady screamin' it's a murder
They gotta take my soul, I been thuggin' since a youngin'
Motherfuck which way he go, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
Pussy nigga it's a murder, 187
Send your ass to heaven, and send your family blessings
Hit you with the Smith and Wesson, or beat your ass like Tekken Told your pussy ass to check in, that's what you get for flexin'
I told you I was destined, I told you I was stressin'
Not too rich to tote my weapon, Five-Seven cave your chest in
Pop you niggas send a message, all for the love of the murder, murder
And I got no time to play, know I keep a fuckin' K
And it'll blow your fuckin' brain away, Trippie insane
No I never changed, just got some change
Ain't nothin' to get you wacked off, act hard
It ain't chess it's checkers bitch, nigga at all
Better live your fuckin' best life, Lil Duval
Like Cleo, it's 1400/800 gang, bitch we set it off

[Pre-Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I told 'em I'm dyin' wit' it, I never change up
They say that how I'm livin' that I need to wake up
I'm slangin' that iron wit' it, they'll never frame us
They want me dead but I ain't scared, I got my change up

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
It's a murder, yeah, they screamin' out murder, yeah
They steady screamin' it's a murder
They gotta take my soul, I been thuggin' since a youngin'
Motherfuck which way he go, yeah yeah
