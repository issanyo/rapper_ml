[Intro: Trippie Redd]
On foe 'nem

Woo-ooh, yeah-ayy, huh

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
You been scarred too deep, I can tell

You been scarred too deep, I can tell

You been scarred too deep, I can tell

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Gotta give all your love or nothing
Ride or die, and ride a while for nothing
All year gone and on your own you're stunting
Say you ain't been worried, bitch you fronting
I ain't worried 'bout you bitch, ayy
I ain't worried 'bout you bitch, oh
I ain't worried 'bout you bitch, ayy
I ain't worried 'bout you bitch, no

[Verse 2: UnoTheActivist]
I don't get it
Said I'm right at home when I'm in it
It's been a minute
Said she home alone like come get it
Man I'm all alone on these missions
Ooh, bitch you don't understand
Tryna get to these bands and I'm nothing like your mans
Baby girl there's a difference
I could probably change your whole life in one minute
If it feel right come hop in my Benz
Tell me if you love me, I don't do pretend friends
I did it before, I won't do it again
Tell me that she hate me, yeah yeah, I'm off a xan
Tell me that she want to try one, go Peter Pan
I'ma hop right out the car, all of the water, I think I need land, ooh
Fucked a lil thot, I'm starvin'
I'm fuckin' a star, just send the ho plans, ooh
Know that you wanna go far, baby girl just grab my hand
Told you from the start you can't ride without no pass
Listen please, you can't bring no P racks or no xans, Christmas tree
Light him up then wrap him in saran, baby be with me
We can go venture these foreign lands, please believe in me
You always leaving me
Rolled up, Maserati doors up
Wrist froze up, all y'all bitches chose up

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
You been scarred too deep, I can tell
I can tell, yeah I can tell
You been scarred too deep, I can tell
I can tell, yeah I can tell
You been scarred too deep, I can tell
I can tell, yeah I can tell
You been scarred too deep, I can tell
I can tell, yeah I can tell

[Outro: Trippie Redd]
Baby what's the hold up
Baby what's the hold up
Baby what's the hold up
I tried to hold it down
I tried to hold it down yeah
Baby what's the hold up
Baby what's the hold up
I tried to hold it down
I tried to hold it down
Baby what's the hold up
I tried to hold it down
