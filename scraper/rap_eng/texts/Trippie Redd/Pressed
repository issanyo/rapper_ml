[Intro]
Big Vash Productions

[Verse]
Yeah, I just met a girl and she got me in my feels
This happens every time, is this shit fake or real?
It's not like the last, she's a different girl
Or I'm a different guy, so I gave it a twirl
Honestly, I'm so pressed on this jaunt
Big Vash and J-Stan just cooling on the block

[Chorus]
And you make me a little sweet, now I'm not the old me
I changed for better and I just want you B!

[Verse]
I knew she was the one from the start
I met her in Spanish, she said "I don't know who you are!"
At first I was in shock and then I thought the end was near
But the more I kept talking to her, it all became clear
And in these last verses, I just want you to know
You mean everything to me, I never want you to go

[Chorus]
And you make me a little sweet, now I'm not the old me
I changed for better and I just want you B!

[Lil-14's Verse]
(Yeah, yeah. 'Aight, so look man. There's this bad jaunt in my class. Y'know what I'm sayin'? Oh my god, I need to go.)
Yo shawty, you so damn fine
Eyy, I just want you to be mine
Take a ride and put her in her new belly kush
She's my boo so I take her to the stew
Yeah, I just won for Big Vash
Eyy, we want to get all that cash
Eyy, we want to get to the stash
(Eyy) Get the money then we pass
(Boom) There's this bad jaunt in my class
(Eyy) I'm so high, Imma crash
Eyy, get that money then I dash
Eyy, Fuck it up and we gonna get the cash
(Eyy) Thats my boo, eyy, I'm gonna take her to the stew
Put her in some Jimmy Choo's
(Yeah, yeah, yeah.)
That's just how we fucking do
(Yeah) We wanna get on the door
(Eyy) I'm not gonna say it no more
(Nah) Reppin my thot, smokin' dope
(Eyy) I'm so high that Imma float
(Eyy) I just want you to be mine (Mine)
Shawty, you so fuckin' fine, eyy
Ooh, Body's a dime
(Eyy) 1-4-1-4-1-4-1-4
(Eyy, eyy, eyy, eyy, eyy)
I'm not gonna say it no more (no more)
I want you to be mine
Girl, you so fuckin' fine
(So, look. Funny thing is man..)

[Lil-14 Verse 2]
Do a show for five in the bank roll
Hop with the weed, smokin' dank rolls
If you don't like us then fuck you
Is it bad that whenever I look at you, I wanna cuff you
I just don't know if i can trust you
All I know is I can bust you
(Eyy, eyy, eyy, eyy, eyy, eyy)
