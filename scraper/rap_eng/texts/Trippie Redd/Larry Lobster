[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Bitch, I'm too strong, hook strong, Larry Lobster
Bitch, this that swajjur shit, bust on my wrist
Bitches scared of slime, sneeze on 'em, slime
Try to take my chain, you die, turn that swagger when you cryin'

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Slatt, slatt, slatt, big slime in this bitch, huh
Know you smoke crack, I got a dime in this bitch, yeah
Talkin' down on gang, you gon' die in this bitch
Scared of slides, but, I ain't scared to slide on a bitch
I'm disrespectful, I just put some slime on my wrist
Looked in the bezel, I could see my fuckin' eyes in this shit
It's so brazy, I feel like I could dive in my wrist
I don't look up to niggas 'cause the sky on my wrist

[Verse 2: G.U.N.]
Yeah, two choppers, you die in this bitch
Glock 40 on me, we ride in this bitch
Geekin' up, I sure you won't survive in this bitch
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Brand new two tone, AR chopper, let it blow, yeah
Trap don't never close, any nigga, they don't belong
Watch these pussy niggas fold, any nigga, they gettin' exposed
223, we let it blow, move them packs, they coast to coast

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Bitch, I'm too strong, hook strong, Larry Lobster
Bitch, this that swajjur shit, bust on my wrist
Bitches scared of slime, sneeze on 'em, slime
Try to take my chain, you die, turn that swagger when you cryin'
