Lyrics from Snippet

For me, for me
Gotta keep your head up for me, for me
Me, me
Me, me
Yeah, Gotta keep your head up for me (Yeah)
'Cause I'm tryna find
Yeah, gotta keep your head up for me
Woah-oa, 'cause I'm tryna find
Think outside your mind (Yeah)
Now my wrist froze up bitch
Lamborghini got the doors up bitch
You know what it is you chose up bitch
Keep your heart keep your soul up bitch
You was lookin' for exposure bitch
I was lookin' for some closure bitch
Lickin' park plugs like I'm Rosa bitch
[?]
I run the game, I'ma solider bitch
I'm on that shit that you know I'm with
Shoot this shit up and expose and shit
Now my heart got a hole in it
[?]
While my milk in your mouth Oreos in it
Stuck in that pussy I'm froze in it (Yeah)
