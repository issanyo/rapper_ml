Lyrics from a snippet

[Chorus : Trippie Redd]
Everyone is the same nigga be yourself
No I don't need the chains man I need some help
Yeah I remain the same nigga being myself
And if you can't on god nigga kill yourself

[Verse 1 : Trippie Redd]
Since a child I've been the motherfuckin' shit dawg
I had the [?] in their feelings, yeah they are pissed off
I had to go and flood the VVS to wrist dawg
You better pray to big 14 I'm heaven sent dawg
I don't [?] always sipping ros√© in some crystal
I get my drink from rocky nigga ball like Kriss [?]
I get my cash fast, niggas sonic hedgedog
I shot that bitch 14 times and sped off

[Chorus : Trippie Redd]
Everyone is the same nigga be yourself
No I don't need the chains man I need some help
Yeah I remain the same nigga being myself
And if you can't on god nigga kill yourself

[Chorus : Trippie Redd]
Everyone is the same nigga be yourself
No I don't need the chains man I need some help
Yeah I remain the same nigga being myself
And if you can't on god nigga kill yourself
