[Intro: Trippie Redd]
We gotta keep it together don’t take it now
I gotta pull it together don’t hold him down
We gotta do this together don’t hold him down
By myself
Yeah

[Chorus: Money Man]
Expressing my feelings in songs
These niggas was doing me wrong
She gone come to the door in a thong
If you pussy you do not belong
Put them Forgi’s on all of my cars
Know my songs she know all of my bars
Dirty pistol I keep me a charge
Drop the top I be talking to God
In a Wraith imma look at the stars
I’m not selfish I’m feeding the squad
She gone suck me with plenty of slob
All this gas fuming up the garage
Selling bags i dont want me a job
Imma ship me some P’s in a P.O.D
[?]
She gone swallow me just like the Blob

[Verse 1]
I can hustle I don’t have to rob
You see blue when I pull out my wad
Niggas foul I’m not sparing the rod
Caviar fill my car up with fog
Imma shark like I’m starring in Jaws
Demolition I knock down the walls
I need billions I ain't thinking too small
So I practice the 48 Laws
Niggas hate me I don’t know the cause
I was pondering, I had to pause
And my closet it’s just like a mall
Desiger I’m having em all
Like a shoelace I’m tied to the mob
Niggas corny just like they a cob
Imma get me a trap spot in Cobb
Gotta bad bitch she rocking a bob
Knew you was lame after all
Niggas be itchin' them balls
Dry your tears don’t sit there and sob
I swear niggas just want you to fall
Rocking D&G T-shirt’s and draws
All these 100s they blue and they neat
On a fast I ain’t ate in a week
All these strains I got several seeds
Rocking golds like Arabian kings
I be planting Canadian seeds
And my bitch wear the finest of weaves
I don’t know how she got in her jeans
I’m too solid this shit in my genes
And these Christians be red like a B
In New York I go shop like a fiend
Niggas broke like they arm in a sling
Took her home and we had us a fling
We fuck long everytime that we link
Had to go tat my body with ink
Leave me alone cause I need time to think
She drop water just like she a sink
I got ice like a motherfucking rink
Let her go she was causing a scene
Cleopatra she know she a queen
Selling loud from a stoop out in Queens
Don’t be saying no shit you don’t mean
We just fucked so we feeling relieved

[Chorus: Money Man]
Expressing my feelings in songs
These niggas was doing me wrong
She gone come to the door in a thong
If you pussy you do not belong
Put them Forgi’s on all of my cars
Know my songs she know all of my bars
Dirty pistol I keep me a charge
Drop the top I be talking to God
In a Wraith imma look at the stars
I’m not selfish I’m feeding the squad
She gone suck me with plenty of slob
All this gas fuming up the garage
Selling bags i dont want me a job
Imma ship me some P’s in a P.O.D
[?]
She gone swallow me just like the Blob

[Hook: Trippie Redd]
We gotta keep it together don’t take it now
I gotta pull it together don’t hold him down
We gotta do this together don’t hold him down
By myself
Yeah
