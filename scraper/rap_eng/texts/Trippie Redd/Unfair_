Lyrics from a snippet

[Chris Brown]
Why you acting my fault
Everything you ask for
Blaming me is so unfair
Don't be a bitch don't call me asshole
Why you get mad
The type of shits that kill my vibe
[?]
Tell no lies I'm telling the truth
You don't know me and I don't know you
No no no babe, you ain't got to be mean, ain't got to be ruth
[?] a way, from me to move
