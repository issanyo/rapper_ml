[Intro]
I wuv Trippie Redd
Aye, it was always a, a fucking goal to, uh
Give all these niggas hell, know what I'm sayin'
A Love Letter to You 2
Ooh, fuck your boo
Baby wish me well

[Chorus]
Baby wish me well (wish me well)
It's all a dream just like a wishing well (well)
To give 'em hell (hell), and you know that I live in hell (hell)
A livin' hell (hell), I'm Hellboy, I live in hell

[Verse]
I let the money dance, the diamond blings all by itself
Without any help, so that means it shine on it's own
Without any gold, I've been a king without any throne
It's time to take your ass to school, ain't no place, like, home
I'm 1400 with the screw up kids, don't screw up kid
Or that choppa wet your crew up kid, I'm two up kid
We animals, better zoo up kid
I'm from Canton but the whole country where I blew up big
Who knew us kid, I think I came from under a rock
Was out on the block, my cousin had that shit in his sock
He movin' the work, your bitch all over my cock
I put dick in her mouth, like the whole mother of bombs
And I ain't talkin' Donald Trump, but I'll take Donald out the trunk
And let Donald's ass bust if you keep talkin' down on gang
I just pulled up in a Lamb, cuzzo pulled up in a Range
And we reloadin' them sticks lil' nigga, we release them things, ayy

[Bridge]
Hold up, give 'em hell, give 'em hell
I been on the road wish me well, wish me well, yeah
Give 'em hell, give 'em hell
I been on the road wish me well, wish me well

[Chorus]
Baby wish me well (wish me well)
It's all a dream just like a wishing well (well)
To give 'em hell (hell), and you know that I live in hell (hell)
A livin' hell (hell), I'm Hellboy, I live in hell
Baby wish me well (wish me well)
It's all a dream just like a wishing well (well)
To give 'em hell (hell), and you know that I live in hell (hell)
A livin' hell (hell), I'm Hellboy, I live in hell

[Outro]
Baby, wish me well
Baby, wish me well
Baby, wish me well
Ooh, I was like sayonara to you
Ooh, I was like wish me well, lil' boo
Ooh, I dropped a love letter to you
Yeah, and gave you another one, lil' boo
Yeah, sayonara to you
Ooh, sayin' wish me well, lil' boo
Yeah, screamin' wish me well, lil' boo
Bitch
