Lyrics from the original "CLOUT COBAIN | CLOUT CO13A1N" song"

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it’s been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I’ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Verse 1]
I don't even know what to feel, they don't even know what's real
Dry tears with a dollar bill, I'm out tryna make a mill', oh
Why you wanna take my soul? I’m yelling out "hell no!"
I can’t even trust my friends, most of them might be foes
Watch these hoes when they say they want a lot of me
I don't know who’s the one that wanna plot on me
I stay low so my demons don't acknowledge me
When I go, I know death don't do apologies

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it’s been so damn long, dealing with the things I felt (ayy)

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Outro]
Clout Cobain, yeah
Clout Cobain, yeah
