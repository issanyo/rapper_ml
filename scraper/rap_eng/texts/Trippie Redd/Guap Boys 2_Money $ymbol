[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Bitch, I put that on the gang
That's fourteen hundred gang
Bitch, this air from New York
I fuck with the gang
I paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Bitch, I put that on the gang
That's fourteen hundred gang
Bitch, this air from New York
I fuck with the gang

[Verse 1: A1 Billionaire]
Fourteen hundred gang
Eighteen hundred gang
If you're talking down
Lil' nigga, you a lame
Fuck that boys living new
We bust that nigga brain
Take that nigga chains
Take that nigga chains
Eight hundred for a half
Fourteen hundred for the whole thang
Rollie bust down
Marco Sison dancing in the rain
Way the bitch dance, you would think she [?]
Eat it up, lo mein
I got white, dominicane
I need all the money, I'm like fuck the fame
I just think it's funny when they know your name
Justin Bieber fever make a white bitch faint
Hundred chains on me, lil' nigga what you think?

[Hook: Trippie Redd]
I paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Bitch, I put that on the gang
That's fourteen hundred gang
Bitch, this air from New York
I fuck with the gang
I paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Paid a hundred for my chain
Then fourteen for my ring
Bitch, I put that on the gang
That's fourteen hundred gang
Bitch, this air from New York
I fuck with the gang
