[Verse 2: Chris King]
Got the choppa' riding passenger, backseat
This a side bitch
Wockhardt, Hi-Tech, mix up my drink
I feel like modern day Mozart
Don't touch my, keys
I am who these little niggas trying to be
I orchestrate assassinations, symphonize with me
I do this shit cause ain't nobody sympathize for the team
Now peep it
There's three ways I'ma pop, it's gun, mic or the pot
So get in either yours, or nigga I'ma get mine
Boolin' with a nigga's favorite thot
I can't tell if she's yours or mine
I know when it all comes down
I'll be getting money til the moonlight
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Big money, you're overweight, bitch
Big guap, overweight, bitch
Bad bitch, suck on my, dick
Thottie body, fuck on my, dick
Big money, you're overweight, bitch
Big guap, overweight, bitch
Bad bitch, suck on my, dick
Thottie body, fuck on my, dick
