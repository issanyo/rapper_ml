[Chorus]
Said I'm alright
Everywhere I go, bitch I'm alright yeah
Draping gold bitch it's all nice, ouu
VVS them diamonds bitch they all ice, yeah
I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Pull up in the Maybach
Ceejay with me lookin' hella tipsy
White girl with me and the molly got her dancing hella brittany
14-hundred hoodie all red, looking hella trippy
Bobby Shmurda niggas, Houston bitches with me on that whitney
I come out the coldest city with the hottest bitch
I pull up pop a nigga's niggas if they [?] shit
Them bitches tryna fall in love and tryna fall in rich
She gotta go and brush her teeth before she suck my dick
My [?] want that pay back and I might have to OK that
Pull up on that clown and put him down 'cos my homie don't play that
[?], give them hell on Earth
I come from the dirt
Get your [?] talkin' water guns but all them choppers squirt

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said I'm alright
Everywhere I go, bitch I'm alright yeah
Draping gold bitch it's all nice, ouu
VVS them diamonds bitch they all ice, yeah
I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah

[Verse 2: Jswizz]
Big smoke Whatchu weighin
Rara Watchu sayin
Pull up told the custo yeah that’s 50 what you payin
Come thru yeah today
I gotta make the play
Find another plug because I’m moving to the bay

Told you get a grip
Them games not in the script
Heard you gettin jealous I’m rappin wit my nigga trip
I only gave you one chance and you really had to slip
Time to pack it up seal it like a fuckin zip

I’m just runnin late get up out my way
Don’t care what you say shotti get up out my face
Guess this ain’t the case putchu you in ya fuckin place
I’m just movin weight skatin there’s no time to waste

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said I'm alright
Everywhere I go, bitch I'm alright yeah
Draping gold bitch it's all nice, ouu
VVS them diamonds bitch they all ice, yeah
I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah
Said I'm tellin' you I'm alright, yeah

[Verse 2: Jswizz]
Like drake I flipped the switch
Steady big bank ballin but I’m no where close to rich
City like the ocean imma shark and you a fish
Working to the top and that’s my goal I make a wish

Spend it at the mall
Hatin prayin on my fall
I carry these niggas like my name is uhaul
Making all these bangers like the window to the wall so im
Waitin for the day a record label just call

Never lackin
Money yeah im stackin
If you not up on the grind then i see you as slackin

I told you that im alright
Gotta problem then im tellin you its on site
