[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Yeah
On a different type of time
Bitch, I'm big slime
I ain't never stressin'
Out of sight I'm outta mind
Applying pressure on that bitch
Pressure on that bitch
Applying pressure on that bitch
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Because I love the worth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn bae, I love to flirt
I think you cute I like your shirt
And damn pain I need a nurse
Man where the fuck the percs
These diamonds solar flare imburse
And over-shine the fucking dirt

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah
My wrist Ms. Butterworth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn bae, I love to flirt
I think you cute I like your shirt
My wrist Ms. Butterworth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn pain I love the hurt
Yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Keed]
Keed talk to 'em!
These bitches can’t stress me I’m getting chedda’ cheese
These choppas’ stretch em’ out, lay em out like some G’s
I told that bitch watch her mouth never talk back to me
Them Percocet’s clear her mind, she ain’t there when she need
These Percocet’s make her who she is up in the sheets
I’m on adderall, focus, I’m in the streets
Why she call my phone
Asking about my home
She ain’t meet my folks
She ain’t really my zone
Chrome heart glasses, my drip goin’ on
Yeah, in an Aventador, know it goin’ on
Yeah, I don’t even got to score they goin’ add points on
Mark, dot, truck
Can’t see nothing, shit going on

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah
My wrist Ms. Butterworth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn bae, I love to flirt
I think you cute I like your shirt
My wrist Ms. Butterworth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn pain I love the hurt
Yeah

[Verse 2: Shootem Up]
I don’t fear shit but God, like my clothes is
Police be on me, but not on me like these hoes is
Niggas talk behind the screen, they ain’t really mean
Caught him out in traffic, he said, “It ain’t what it seem.”
Kicked that bitch out the bed and said fuck yo dream
Took the ring off his hand and said fuck yo team
Take a look at our whites, all you see is gleams
Take a look at they face, all you see is beams
Trying to go from Air-Max to Maybach
Don’t shake my hand more than once, please I hate that
You ain’t slime not no mo’, take yo snake back
And money falling off of trees bring that rake back

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah
My wrist Ms. Butterworth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn bae, I love to flirt
I think you cute I like your shirt
My wrist Ms. Butterworth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn pain I love the hurt
Yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah
My wrist Ms. Butterworth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn bae, I love to flirt
I think you cute I like your shirt
My wrist Ms. Butterworth
Damn pain I love the hurt
Damn pain I love the hurt
Yeah
