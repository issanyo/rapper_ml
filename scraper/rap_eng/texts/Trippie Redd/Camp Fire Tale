[Chorus]
Will it take my death to see
To see my destiny
They say I live in a fantasy
I'm just lit off Hennessy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah

[Verse]
Pulled up, drop top with speed
Talk down Iâ€™ll pop the heat
This for the ones that doubted me
Said my momma is proud of me
Sit down, smoke a pound of weed
Sip this liquor and drown with me, yeah
Sip this liquor and drown with me
Baby kneel beneath me and bow to me
Baby kneel beneath me and bow to me
Baby kneel beneath me and bow to me

[Chorus]
Will it take my death to see
To see my destiny
They say I live in a fantasy
I'm just lit off Hennessy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah
Will it take my death to see
To see my destiny
They say I live in a fantasy
I'm just lit off Hennessy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah
