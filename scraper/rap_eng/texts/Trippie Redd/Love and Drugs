[Intro: Trippie Redd & Kodie Shane]
Oh, if love was a drug
Hahaha, yeah
Ayy, ayy
Yeah ayy

[Hook: Trippie Redd & Kodie Shane]
Baby, if love was a drug (yeah)
I'd be addicted to the love (okay, okay, yeah)
Sick and tired of this love
Fantasizing 'bout some love and drugs (okay, uh-huh, aye)

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Baby girl, would you ride for your nigga? Aye
Baby girl, would you die for your nigga? Aye
In the kitchen whippin' pies with a nigga, aye
Put them panties to the side for a nigga, aye

[Verse 2: Kodie Shane]
Yuh
Valet, park my car lil' nigga, aye, uh
Don't you touch my ride lil' nigga, uh
All up in my car, why you talkin' to that nigga? Aye
Wait, why you talkin' to that nigga babe?

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd]
Why you fuck with that nigga?
'Cause that nigga, he a lame
And got the same love
Ain't nothing ever change
Step back, put it right through my legs, then fade away
Who's Bad? Who's Bad? I'm bad, baby, MJ

[Verse 4: Kodie Shane]
Just call my phone, I'll be on my way
You my favorite 'cause I swear you always get it
Pockets on swole 'cause I'm all about my fitness
'Bout to break a record, somebody call Guinness
Yeah, somebody call Guinness
Scottie Pippen, how I pass it off and how they get it
Dropping baby off, right up before I finish, yeah
Right up before I finish, yeah
