Uh, take a vivid picture, no photos
Implement that shit in to your mind just so you know though
Sucker free living, I'm a say that that's the motto
So for any nigga on that sucker shit, I'm no hoe, bro
Might just have to drop a bomb, Han Solo
Got me bicken back being bool, Quasimodo
All about my paper, got to get my fucking dough, hoe
Always on the fucking go go, you a bitch like Tony Romo
Niggas came around, now they extinct like Dodos
Meanwhile I'm in New York fucking up SoHo
Just bagged a new chick, Caroline, nicknamed Coco
Took her to the telly, now little baby going loco
She just give me face, ain't no fucking, that's a no no
And she going thirty early, dirty no soap though
I laugh at the haters, everything they say a joke though
And I'm screaming "Fuck 12," all these foul ass po-po
Yeah, uh, but nowadays I really miss my fucking idols
So that's the title, I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle
Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs and
Get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain, storm
You see, I can't ignore, and you niggas don't see it's in your brain
And snore, and you sleep on me until you can't no more and
Don't fake on me and try to play the boy
I don't know why I feel like nobody loves me
Or why they feel like my intentions something ugly
Or why I feel like everyone needs something from me
Or why I feel like everyone just saying "Fuck me"
Or why I feel like the opposition gon' bust me
If I gave you my heart, would you still love me?
Lately, baby I feel like nobody trust me, is it just me?
