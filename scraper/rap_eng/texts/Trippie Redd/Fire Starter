[Intro]
Honorable Court
Said it all ends in motherfucking flames
Said it all ends in motherfucking flames
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Big 14, know what the fuck goin' on, yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said it all ends in motherfucking flames
Said I’m a boss, bitch, ain't got no time for games
Proceed with caution, we kill and say no names
Yeah
I said this scrutiny
If I die today, man who gon' shoot for me?
Roll with Big Weezy, Bentley Coupes with me
I can’t go nowhere unless my troops with me
So don't try anything, it'll all end in flames
Yeah, it'll all end in flames
Yeah, it'll all end in flames
Yeah, it'll all end in flames

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
I got my bag now, your bitch wanna pass out
Do the dash out, then I smash out, bad bitch mash out
I might crash out, millions in my stash house
Lil bitch gonna suck me til' she gag out
You a Opp ass niggas should wear a badge now
I'm the future, you niggas left in the past now
Got these bitches in bundles, I’m talking mass now
All of these choppas, I swear to God I done maxed out

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said it all ends in motherfucking flames
Said I’m a boss, bitch, ain't got no time for games
Proceed with caution, we kill and say no names
Yeah
I said this scrutiny
If I die today, man who gon’ shoot for me?
Roll with Big Weezy, Bentley Coupes with me
I can't go nowhere unless my troops with me
So don't try anything, it'll all end in flames
Yeah, it’ll all end in flames
Yeah, it'll all end in flames
Yeah, it'll all end in flames, yeah
