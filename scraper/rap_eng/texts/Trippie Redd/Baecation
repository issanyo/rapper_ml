[Intro: Sample & Trippie Redd]
All that hanging up on me shit is a dub
'Cause if you hang up on me, I'm calling back
You send me to voicemail, I'm calling back
You turn off your phone, I'm at your door, like
There's no getting rid of me baby, that's what you want
You used to niggas walking out on you
Nah this is baecation, I'm here to stay baby
I'm here, fuck is you talkin' bout
