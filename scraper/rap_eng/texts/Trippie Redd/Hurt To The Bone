[Intro]
Haha
Lil 14, woah woah woah woah
Haha

[Verse 1]
You only worried 'bout yourself, girl you so selfish
She say I worry 'bout everyone, I'm so selfish
Some things will never change
I ain't worried, I don't need you anyway

[Chorus]
But woah, why these girls so cold?
Why they all got one common goal, hurt a nigga to the bone
Beat a nigga to the bone, hurt a young nigga's soul
Hurt a young nigga's soul, hurt a young nigga's soul, yeah-ayy

[Post-Chorus]
We pull up in that Aston, gassin'
Puff puff then I pass it
The chopper will flip you, gymnastics
Fuck your love man I'm past it
Your love is in past tense
Huh, gassin'
On the road and I'm smashin', ah
I don't have time for your shit
I don't got time for your shit
I don't got no time for the fuck shit
I don't got time for your shit, no

[Chorus]
Why they got one common goal, hurt a nigga to the bone
Beat a nigga to the bone, hurt a young nigga's soul
Hurt a young nigga's soul, hurt a young nigga's soul

[Verse 2]
Hurt a young nigga's soul cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
Shawty yeah yeah, you're so cold

[Post-Chorus]
We pull up in that Aston, gassin'
Puff puff then I pass it
The chopper will flip you, gymnastics
Fuck your love man I'm past it
Your love is in past tense
Huh, gassin'
On the road and I'm smashin', yeah
I don't have time for your shit
