[Verse 1: Joji]
There's no more time
Just lay it on me
If I lost my life
You can blame it on me
Are you ready or not?
We can start right here
Take you on them rocks
So crystal clear

[Bridge: Joji]
Oh, oh, oh
Are they talkin' 'bout us?
Are they talkin' 'bout us? (Yeah)
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
Are they talkin' 'bout us?
Are they talkin' 'bout us?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
Tryna find your love, put your love above
Baby all we need is trust, no one know but us
No one know but us
No one know but us, yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Me and you, you and I
I would die for you
Do or die for you
Suicide for you
R.I.P., I would die for you
R.I.P., huh, I would die for you
R.I.P., huh, I would die for you
R.I.P., huh, I would die for you
I would die for you

I would die for you, ayy

[Verse 3: Joji]
There's no more time
Just lay it on me
If I lost my life
You can blame it on me
Are you ready or not?
We can start right here
Take you on them rocks
So crystal clear

[Outro: Trippie Redd]
Woah, I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you, yeah
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you
R.I.P., R.I.P., I would die for you
You, you
