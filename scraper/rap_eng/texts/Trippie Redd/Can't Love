[Intro]
I thought you loved, I thought you loved
I thought you loved, I thought you loved
I thought you loved, I thought you loved

[Chorus]
She say she love me, I think she love me not
She say she love me, I know she love me not
She say she love me, love, love, love, love
How could you do this to me?
Yeah, how could you do this to me?
How could you do this?
How could you do this to me?
Yeah, yeah, I thought you, I thought you loved
(I thought you loved)

[Verse]
Shawty know I'm the best thing she ever had
So I ain't mad, knowing that I ain't do no bad
Leave you in the past, in this car I'm moving real fast
I do the dash, hoping a young nigga don't crash
I loved you bad, all you did was just show yo' ass
I'm kinda glad, gotta stay focused on this bag
I got jet lag, had to go get a hundred flat
I'm talking cash, I can have any pussy cat
I think she love me, but she love me not
She say she love me, I know she love me not
She say she love me, bitch you just love this cock
She say she love me, I think it's 'cause I'm hot

[Chorus]
She say she love me, I think she love me not
She say she love me, I know she love me not
She say she love me, love, love, love, love
How could you do this to me?
Yeah, how could you do this to me?
How could you do this?
How could you do this to me?
Yeah, yeah, I thought you, I thought you loved
(I thought you loved)

[Outro]
I thought you loved me? Yeah
I thought you loved me? Yeah
She love me, she love me not
She love me, love me not
She love me, love me not
Yeah, yeah
Love me forever, love me forever
