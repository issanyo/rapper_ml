[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, now why the fuck you wanna test me?
I'll hit you with the right and the lefty
Yeah, your bitch was with you right when she left me
VVS, them diamonds ice, yeah my neck bling
Nigga, your neck green
I took the gang out to eat and they ordered everything
I put my soul in these cups and don't worry 'bout anything
I put my soul in these cups and I watch my kidney bleed

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Take about three rights and you know you're left with me
Baby you right and you know you're left with me
Told you that right before you had left the scene
Take a left hook and right hook right to the spleen
You know the sky is the limit, you can have anything
You can die for the living, you still gon' live through me
You can cry to these bitches, they still won't feel a thing
So I don't feel for these hoes, I just feel Hennessy
I'm smoking this Do-Si-Dos, feeling the energy
That's the reason I'm the shit, dawg
VVS them diamonds in my wrist, dawg
Hit him with the left and right, I'm pissed off

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, now why the fuck you wanna test me?
I'll hit you with the right and the lefty
Yeah, your bitch was with you right when she left me
VVS, them diamonds ice, yeah my neck bling
Nigga, your neck green
I took the gang out to eat and they ordered everything
I put my soul in these cups and don't worry 'bout anything
I put my soul in these cups and I watch my kidney bleed

[Verse 2: Baby Goth]
Bust you down with the jewels on my pinky
White gold, diamonds so my drip is milky
If you want smoke, my gas is sticky
Iâ€™m with the gang, pull up if you feelin' risky
I got a Uzi filled with candy
Bitch, you look a little hungry
Open up your mouth
I can put this lead inside of your tummy
My sticks and stones will break your bones
Your aim will never touch me
All these hoes will come and go
I stay counting up my money

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, now why the fuck you wanna test me?
I'll hit you with the right and the lefty
Yeah, your bitch was with you right when she left me
VVS, them diamonds ice, yeah my neck bling
Nigga, your neck green
I took the gang out to eat and they ordered everything
I put my soul in these cups and don't worry 'bout anything
I put my soul in these cups and I watch my kidney bleed
