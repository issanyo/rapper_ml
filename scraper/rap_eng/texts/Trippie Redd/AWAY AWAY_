[Chorus]
Swear I'm on some shit away
Swear to God don't care 'bout shit away
I might roll up and get lit away
I get high, watch my brain lift away
Gotta stay focused I can't drift away
So sick and tired of this shit, okay
But I ain't trynna throw this gift away, away

[Verse 1]
And I'mma get rich then I'm gone
Got some people try'na get me out my zone
I'm a motherfuckin' king bitch on my throne
I been going through some things all by my lone
Did this little thing all by my lone
By my lone in a different time zone
Bitch i'm gone, hunnid shots to my dome, yeah
And it all started with a dream
If i'm eating bitch I'm feeding the whole team
We been thuggin all our niggas had to scheme
I'm addicted to all these racks, I'm counting cheese
I need my brème de la brème

[Bridge]
When I met you I was
On a sunny day

[Chorus]
Swear I'm on some shit away
Swear to God don't care 'bout shit away
I might roll up and get lit away
I get high, watch my brain lift away
Gotta stay focused I can't drift away
So sick and tired of this shit, okay
But I ain't trynna throw this gift away, away

[Bridge]
When I met you I was
On a sunny day
