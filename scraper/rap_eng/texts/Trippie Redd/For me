[snippet from live]


For me, for me
Gotta keep your head up for me, for me (mee me mee me)
Gotta keep your head up for me
Cause I’m tryna find (yeahhh)
Gotta keep your head up for me (woahh)
Cause I’m tryna find, think outside your mind

[trippie redd]
Yeah my wrist froze up bitch
Lamborghini got the doors up bitch
You know what it is you chose up bitch
Keep your heart, keep your soul up bitch
You was looking for exposure bitch
I was looking for some closure bitch
We can pop drugs like I’m Rosa bitch
Need a blunt, need a donor shit
I’m ready to give up my soul bitch
I’m on that shit that you know I’m with
Shooting shit up and exposing shit
Now my heart got a hole in it
Travel my mind you can go in it
Pick ya stuff up we can put a fort in it
Milk in your mouth, Oreos in it
Sucking that pussy I’m froze in it yeahhh
