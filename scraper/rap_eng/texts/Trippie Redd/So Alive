[Chorus]
You give me life, you give me light
You give me a reason why I say "Give me time"
You get me high when you cross my mind
Yeah, who needs suicide when I feel so alive with you (Yeah, yeah)
And you know I would die for you
Jesus, weep, baby know I would cry for you
Yeah, yeah
Die for you

[Verse]
Ain't no way anybody gon' feel this way
I don't think anybody gon' love you this way
You flattered by what I said, baby, oh "How Sway?"
That's my intentions, I had to get off my brain (My brain)
My plan, doing 200 on the dash on the highway
Don't got no time for no fuckery to my games
Migraines, my flames, yeah

[Chorus]
You give me life, you give me light
You give me a reason why I say "Give me time"
You get me high when you cross my mind
Yeah, who needs suicide when I feel so alive with you (Yeah, yeah)
And you know I would die for you
Jesus, weep, baby know I would cry for you
Yeah, yeah
Die for you
