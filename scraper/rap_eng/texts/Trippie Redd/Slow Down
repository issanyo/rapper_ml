[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, slow down
Yeah, ayy
Big 14, you know what the fuck goin' on
Ooh, with the lights on
Baby, let me hit it with the lights on
Yeah, diamonds on my neck shine like a lighthouse
Ooh, ayy, hol' up

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah
Slow down, yeah (they wishing I)
Slow down, ooh, ayy (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah (they wishing I)
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Rocket Da Goon]
I came down, no pressure
I be posted on the background
Burn a nigga if he [?] poppin' to my wrist charm
Fill him up with lead, pull the trigger 'til the clip drop
She want give me dome, pull up at the pit stop
Ayy lil ho, come [?] these braids though
Eat 'em just like Fabo, kitchen just like caino
Diamond wet like rainbow
Told them people that little boy can't change though, whoa
Jewish lawyer, ain't no case
Travel state to state, I'm sippin' J and countin' faces
Pick up the pace, big bands for the take
Fifteen for the left wrist, for Celine jeans, and the Wraith
On that pound shit, baby love how I kick shit, yeah
Change ho [?] no attention
Leave the ho, no mention
Slow down when I be sippin', ride with the Act
Ride with the beam on the tac, ah
Red beam, that's the hat

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah
Slow down, yeah (they wishing I)
Slow down, ooh, ayy (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah (they wishing I)
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, ooh, yeah

[Verse 2: Warhol.ss]
Oh, ayy, ayy
Pourin' on the drink, you know it got me slowed down
Yeah you [?] for my shit, you know it go down
How I'm flexin', yeah it's all on my clothes now
All these niggas that imitate, pourin' on lean in the lemonade
And I swear that shit, it brought me to a better place
I pop a percocet, I can't feel my face
I'm runnin' after money, I'm on a paper chase
No, no you can't copy the lingo
Put a dot on your head like bingo
Smoke gas and you know that Citgo
Got big drank, you know I sip slow
Christian Louboutin, you know how I tiptoe
And, and, all of my bitches they dimes
But I never spend no time
You know I draw sixty a line
Let them niggas fall in line
I stayed down 'til I came up
Young Pooda, yeah you know I never changed up
In the streets you know the shit it get dangerous
Boss gang, yeah you niggas can't fuck with us

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah
Slow down, yeah (they wishing I)
Slow down, ooh, ayy (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, yeah (they wishing I)
Slow down, yeah (they want me to)
Slow down, ooh, yeah
