[Chorus]
I do not have time for your dumb shit
I just beat the pussy 'til it go numb bitch
Countin' all these racks, I got green thumbs bitch
I count all my money, put that on my gun bitch

[Verse 1]
Lot of these niggas they stupid, they all tryna envy my style, woah
I count the money all day, my lil niggas they wild, woah
Beat it up so many times they tried to put me on trial, woah
I been here for a minute, I'll still be here for a while
I don't know why they hate on me but it's okay
I don't know why they hate on me but baby girl it's okay
Ayy nigga, it's okay
I just apply the pressure
Money all up on my dresser
Never switching up my schedule, woah
I don't got no fucking time
I don't got no fucking time
You won't get a fucking dime
All this money on me baby, all this money mine
Stay getting money, had to stay on my grind
For a broke dumb bitch I ain't never had time
For a hatin' ass nigga I ain't never had time
Never had time, never had time
I was always on the fucking grind
Like the sun baby, Trippie shine
Talkin' money, you won't get a dime
Had to get it, nigga it's do or die

[Chorus]
I do not have time for your dumb shit
I just beat the pussy 'til it go numb bitch
Countin' all these racks, I got green thumbs bitch
I count all my money, put that on my gun bitch

[Verse 2]
I don't know why they hate on me but it's okay
I don't know why they hate on me but baby girl it's okay
Countin' money, okay
Had to apply the pressure
Had to apply pressure
Had to apply the pressure
My inner beast is awakened
Woah, my inner beast is awakened
Woah, my inner beast is awakened
Woah, my inner beast is awakened

[Outro]
Lil fourteen, yeah
Lil fourteen, yeah
Lil fourteen, yeah
