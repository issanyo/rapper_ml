[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Yeah Yeah Yeah...

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Couple bad bitches like to go both ways
Walk across the street, don't even look both ways
They all stop and stare, hypnotized by my face
It's a sunny evening, solar flare on my chains

[Hook: Trippie Redd]
Evil Knievel, yeah look at them people
They so deceitful
Hard, just like some beetles

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
Nigga fuck you and what you claim
1400/800 nigga know we bang
Known to do it big, bitch I'mma Great Dane
Frontin' on a kid, bitch, look what I became
Getting all these big racks, man this shit insane
Yeah
This shit insane
Big 14, bitch, know the fuckin' name
Gang in this bitch, whippin' shit like a slave
Blue diamonds in my teeth shout out Johnny Dang
You's a nobody, use you as my ash tray
Kick her out then call her back over the next day
Real dirty bitch, she gon' do what I say
Stop the fuckin game like that shit is fuckin clay
Shout out Thompson nigga, know I'm ballin' like I'm Klay
We still okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 3: Chris King]
[?] , they be lookin' at me strange
Treat these rappers like it's target practice, shooting range
Fuck a brand new hoe, forget your clothes, walk of shame
We got nothin' to lose, we got so much more to gain
Choppa kick you out the house [?]
Now that's some shit you can't explain

[Verse 4: Trippie Redd]
Nigga, have a great day
I still feel the fire in my motherfuckin' veins
I'm so damn tired, I been up all late
Got a lot to fuckin' lose, but I'mma continue the gain, yeah

[Hook: Trippie Redd]
Evil Knievel, yeah look at them people
They so deceitful
Hard, just like some beetles
