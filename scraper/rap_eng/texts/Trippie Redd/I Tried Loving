[Chorus]
You can try, I guarantee the shit won't work
You can die, I guarantee the shit won't hurt
I can't deny, I was fuckin' with you at first
Pain killer in disguise, I can't feel a thing off the Percs

[Verse 1]
I can't feel, tryna figure out if this shit is real
I can't feel, tryna figure out if this shit real
Rocket got them pints, not for real
Tryna pop me a motherfucking seal
Big dripping, pussy nigga, real spill
Keep a chopper by my side, a big Galil
With your bitch, tryna Netflix and chill
She don't want you, lil nigga, what's your deal?
Feel like Bob, pussy nigga tryna build
Third eye open just like the hills
Try to test me and my niggas gonna kill

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, not for real, not for real
No cap, pussy nigga, not for real
Not for real, not for real
No cap, pussy nigga, not for real
Not for real, not for real

[Chorus]
You can try, I guarantee the shit won't work
You can die, I guarantee the shit won't hurt
I can't deny, I was fuckin' with you at first
Pain killer in disguise, I can't feel a thing off the Percs

[Verse 2]
Feel the breeze like your ass in a skirt
I'm a chemic in the kitchen like a nerd
Play with killers, they gorillas, go berserk
You a pussy nigga, better stay in church
Whip it up, Ms.Butterworth
Tryna get my niggas to go to work
I'ma hit you where it hurts
Leave your pussy ass right up in the dirt
Bad foreign bitch and she like to flirt
Working good like a clerk
Big ass chopper make you twerk
Put a nigga in a hearse
Put a pussy nigga on a shirt

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, not for real, not for real
No cap, pussy nigga, not for real
Not for real, not for real
No cap, pussy nigga, not for real
Not for real, not for real

[Chorus]
You can try, I guarantee the shit won't work
You can die, I guarantee the shit won't hurt
I can't deny, I was fuckin' with you at first
Pain killer in disguise, I can't feel a thing off the Percs
