Lyrics from Snippet

Baby we can do anything
When we fuck we make history
The world, don't even exist to me
Where they at? It's such a mystery, ohh, yeah
You love it when I'm in there, yeah
Baby toss that shit back, yeah
You love it when I lick that, yeah
We on a trip baby sit back, ahh
Keep on playin' bitch you know we fuckin'
Bend it over, get on top, bitch you know we fuckin'
In the kitchen, on the couch, baby keep on suckin'
I don't think anything matters 'cause you know we fuckin'
No matter we're tryna feel
When I'm in it that pussy give me the chills
Nobody else [?] that I will kill
I'm in that water, I'm splashing like I got gills
