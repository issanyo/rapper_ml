Nigga just chill, chill
Blowin' that pack with my niggas, I feel like I just got a mil
Feel like I just got a mil, nigga yea, I feel like I got a deal

Nigga get with it, lil nigga, just quit it
Seen the money in my vision, lil nigga gotta get it
Hit you with the smith and, ballin' like I'm Scottie Pippen

Good at making bad decisions, good at making bad decisions
Do this shit for fun, nigga

Designer drugs I'm on, nigga
Dirty sprite I'm on, nigga
Designer drugs I'm on, nigga

Sippin' that muddy, woah
Back to the money

All the way on
Now I'm all the way
