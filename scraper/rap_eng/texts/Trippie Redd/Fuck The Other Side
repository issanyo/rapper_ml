[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Fuck the other side, if you ain't down to ride, yeah
Fuck the other side, if you ain’t down to ride, yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side, ayy
Fuck the oppositions, they can fucking die, ayy
When it comes down to that fucking ride, ayy
Are you ride or die-ie?
Are you ride or die-ie?
You pussy, see it in your eyes, eyes

[Verse 1: Kvng Shad]
Alright
Got gang with me, and we bustin'
I can't ride with you, ain’t no discussion
For my shooters, you know they gon' bust in
1400, you know that they clutchin'
Already know what I'm sayin'
I can't ride with you, boy, I ain't playin'
Fuck that other side, I’ma spray it
For my family, I’ma make it
Hold the crown, I cannot let you take it
Kvng Shad nigga, far from basic
This is my chance nigga, I'm gon’ take it
But you already know that
Why would you booking my flow back
Switchinh my style like my nigga was Kodak
Don't roll with you, and you already know that
Fuck the other side, 'cause I'm down to ride for my niggas

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Fuck the other side, if you ain’t down to ride, yeah
Fuck the other side, if you ain't down to ride, yeah (Huh)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side (Hey)
Fuck the oppositions, they can fucking die (Hey)
When it comes down to that fucking ride (Hey)
Are you ride or die-ie?
Are you ride or die-ie?
You pussy, see it in your eyes, eyes

[Verse 2: Kvng Shad]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I thought you was down to ride, so put the hunnid down
But you left the nigga's side
Yeah, you let me down, but it's bool, I'll be alright
I don't wanna fight, tell that boy to up his bite, yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and you nigga, we different
That's why I won't fuck with oppositions
You was in my position, then ain't no way, you ain't winnin'
But you not, lil nigga, you just mad 'cause we hot, lil nigga
Look at this stash, you 'bout to drop
And we at the top, lil nigga, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, fuck the other side, if you ain't down to ride, yeah (Hey)
Fuck the other side, if you ain't down to ride, yeah (Huh)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side, ayy
Fuck the oppositions, they can fucking die, ayy
When it comes down to that fucking ride, ayy
Are you ride or die-ie?
Are you ride or die-ie?
You pussy, see it in your eyes, eyes

[Outro]
