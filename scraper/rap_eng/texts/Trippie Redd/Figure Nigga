[Intro]
Yea
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
I like to flex
I like to flex, yea
I like to flex (uh uh)
Diamonds 'round my neck

[Verse 1]
Bad little bitch, I [?] that hoe into a demon
She gon' hold my hand while a young nigga peeing
Smack her on the ass [?] boy she cleaning
Nibble on that pussy like a young nigga teethin'
Yea I beat the race, in this McLaren I'm leading
Moving too fast, Need for Speed, say I cheated
Rolex got me sick, two cup, now I'm sneezing
I don't think I need it, but guess what Imma keep it

[Hook]
Yea, I'm a six-figure nigga
Seven-figure nigga
Eight-figure nigga
Nine-figure nigga
A ten-figure nigga
Me and my bitch, and I'm getting rich with her

[Verse 2]
I ain't with that chit-chat, that chitter chitter
I was taught by the OGs to keep my chin up
Getting to that bag, big flexing, doing sit-ups
Dye my bitch hair pink, a killer killer
Moonwalking in my Chanels, this the Thriller
Pray to God every day, a born sinner
Smoking on the greenery, it's caterpillar
You really moving wrong G, I might just hit ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye
Doo-doo-doo
Bow-bow
Bang-bang-bang-bang (yea)
Uh, count my green
Count my Gs
Flex (count my Gs)

[Hook]
Cuz I'm a six-figure nigga
Seven-figure nigga
Eight-figure nigga
Nine-figure nigga
Ten-figure nigga
I'm getting rich nigga
It's me and my bitch, and I'm getting rich with her
