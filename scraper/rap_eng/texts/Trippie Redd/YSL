[Intro: Warhol]
Stepping up in YSL just like I'm Thugger
Let me tell my brother, ain't no undercover
Ooh YSL just like I'm Thugger, oooooh Thugger
If he touch my brother, if he touch my brother
Aye, aye, uh

[Hook: Warhol]
Steppin up in YSL, just like I'm Thugger
1400 choppas if you touch my brother
Speed up on the hoe it's Rush Hour just like Chris Tucker
Pussy nigga he's too sweet we call that boy a sucker
We call that boy a sucker
Uh, fuck your bitch I take her down like Brian Pumper
Pray that nigga bulletproof my shawty got the pump
That hoe ain't my type boy I can't even fuck her
I can't even fuck her

[Verse: Trippie Redd]
If you up it, better buss it
I been counting guap, pussy boy it ain't nothing
Aye, aye, ooh I swear that it ain't nothing, aye
Yeah, it ain't nothing to be stunting, aye, ooh
Swear these niggas undercover
I just want my guap, my cheese and butter
Screaming R.I.P. my brother
I fucked your bitch last night, think I love her
Yeaaaaah, and I swear these niggas suckas
Acting like my diamonds all in clusters
If your bitch come through know that I bust her
Rolex on my wrist know that I buss it
And your bitch pussy wide open
Aye, yeah, I caught the head, I was wide open, aye
Hail Mary, bitch, I'm wide open
Talk down I bust your head, bitch, wide open, yeaaaah

[Hook: Warhol]
Steppin up in YSL, just like I'm Thugger
1400 choppas if you touch my brother
Speed up on a hoe it's Rush Hour just like Chris Tucker
Pussy nigga he's too sweet we call that boy a sucker
We call that boy a sucker
Uh, fuck your bitch I take her down like Brian Pumper
Pray that nigga bulletproof my shawty got the pumper
That hoe ain't my type boy I can't even fuck her
I can't even fuck her

[Outro: Warhol]
Steppin up in YSL, just like I'm Thugger
1400 choppas if you touch my brother
Speed up on a hoe it's Rush Hour just like Chris Tucker
Pussy nigga he's too sweet we call that boy a sucker
We call that boy a sucker
Uh, fuck your bitch I take her down like Brian Pumper
Pray that nigga bulletproof my shawty got the pump
That hoe ain't my type boy I can't even fuck her
