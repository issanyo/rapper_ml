Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, yeah
Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, yeah
Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, yeah

[Verse 1]
Keep the .30 on me, you know I play it safe
Don't need you all up in my way
Gettin bands, throw 'em all up in your face
Bad bitch and I'm grippin on her waist
I tote Uzis nigga, I make movies nigga
My bitch boujee nigga, yo bitch shake her booty nigga
For the fuckin' gang, you a fuckin' lame
Pull up in a Rarri coupe, you still in a bucket thing
Ain't shit changed, ain't shit changed
Yo bitch on me and she wanna be my main
Gettin' money, countin' all my cake
Yeah, yeah, I don't need you in the way yeah
Keep the .30 on me, you know I play it safe, yeah
Lotta money, throw the hundreds in ya face yeah
Big bank take ya fuckin' lil bank yeah

[Chorus]
Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, yeah
Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, yeah
Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, yeah
Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, yeah

[Verse 2]
No more heartbreaks, no more heartbreaks
No more heartbreaks, no more heartbreaks
Hit it from the side, yeah I like it sideways
Like Burger King, baby like it my way
She gon' ride for me, she my ride or die bae
Lil 14 from that Northside place, yeah
Ballin' hard, [?] bands [?]
Rarri coupe, pink coat and some Hennessy
Said I wouldn't cheat but I did it anyways
Now she all in my face screamin'
No more heartbreaks, no more heartbreaks
No more heartbreaks, no more heartbreaks
