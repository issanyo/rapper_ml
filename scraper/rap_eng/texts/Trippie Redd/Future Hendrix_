[Hook: Lil Wop]
I just pulled up in the motherfuckin trap
I just pulled up and killed the whole lot
All these bitches they be coming in sixes
Future Hendrix, I be fucking with sisters
I can't love a bitch, in love with my pistol
? 21 persision
Chopper hit the ?
Fuck them niggas, all them bitches be sneaken

[Verse 1: Lil Wop]
I ain't in love with these bitches, I just fuck these bitches


[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
No, we don't love these thots
Only thing I love is my Glocc
On the block, lil nigga tell the mob
Shoot a nigga right in the head
Trippie Redd shining Infrared
Young nigga counting my bread
Now a nigga chillin on the edge
I ain't talking bout the wood
Pulled up with my ruger, shoot it long like a ruler
Pulled up like Madusa
Shining hard like Madoola
I'm getting all the cake, count it up you gotta fake
Taking trips to the bank
Big bank take your little bank, I'm getting money like a safe
I be trappin like Chris Bores
Rollie x on, no tick tock
Always turned up in the mosh
Fuck that lil bitch, she a thot
