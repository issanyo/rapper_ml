[Chorus]
Yeah, she say my name, yeah, she say my name
Beat her from the back, make her tap, yeah, she say my name
Beat her from the back, that's no cap, yeah, she say my name
Hit her from the back, that's a wrap, yeah, she say my name
Yeah, she say my name, yeah, she say my name
My name, my name, aye, my name, my name, aye
Yeah, my name, aye, my name, my name, aye
Yeah, my name, aye, my name, my name, yeah, yeah

I bet the neighbors know my name
I came on her brain
Sure, that shit no cap, for a fact
I be on her brain
She know she my slatt, you get whacked, yeah, she gonna bang
For me, for me yeah
Swervin' in this Rover, I'm a soldier, lucky like a four leaf clover
Blowin' all this dope, bitch you don't een' know the odor
She just wanna fuck me, baby love me, keep me closer

[Chorus]
Yeah, she say my name, yeah, she say my name
Beat her from the back, make her tap, yeah, she say my name
Beat her from the back, that no cap, yeah, she say my name
Hit her from the back, that's a wrap, yeah, she say my name
Yeah, she say my name, yeah, she say my name
My name, my name, aye, my name, my name, aye
Yeah, my name, aye, my name, my name, aye
Yeah, my name, aye, my name, my name, yeah, yeah
