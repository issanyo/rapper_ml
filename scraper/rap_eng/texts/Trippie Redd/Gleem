[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Yea aye!
Big 14 you know what the fuck goin' on!
I got my nigga wop with me!
Yuh, aye aye aye...

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, my wrist shinin' hit 'em with the gleem
Yeah, my neck shinin' hit 'em with the gleem
Yeah, my teeth shinin' hit 'em with the gleem
With the gleem, bitch, hit 'em with the glem
Iced out Draco, wild out with the team
VVS's diamonds shine like Mr. Clean
Yeah, I'm flexed up, hit 'em with the gleem
With the gleem bitch, hit 'em with the gleem

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Ooh, I'm piped up with my muh fuckin' pipe out
I got an SK with a fucking knife out
Yeah, pussy boy you wanna act out
With my goons and them niggas like to black out
Yeah, and I swear I never back down or back out
I just bring them fucking Tec's out, them Mac's out
If you testin' what I'm about, what I'm about
I just sip with the team, Actavis Codeine
Team sip Actavis Codeine
I be getting money bitch hit em' with the gleem
Choppers with my goons bitch, you know we like to scheme
East side 5-9 bitch you know I bleed

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, my wrist shinin' hit em with the gleem
Yeah, my neck shinin' hit em with the gleem
Yeah, my teeth shinin' hit em with the gleem
With the gleem, bitch, hit em with the gleem
Iced out Draco, wild out with the team
VVS's diamonds shine like Mr.Clean
Yeah, I'm flexed up, hit em with the gleem
With the gleem bitch, hit em with the gleem

[Verse 2: Lil Wop]
Diamonds glistening, they glamorous, they gorgeous
My car fast, It start racing all the horses
Fuck some Balenci', I just bought me some Air Forces
The Police lookin' for your ass like a tourist
I be off that lean, I sip that Wockhardt in that green
Money blue and green, the trap jump like a trampoline
40 with the beam, Lil Wockstar, I won't miss a thing
Hit your lil' bitch from the side and pass her to the team
Lil 14, Lil Wop 17, Glock 17, this bitch hold a magazine
Peel your fucking top back like a tangerine
In the trap breaking bands, now [?] triple beam

[Outro: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, my wrist shinin' hit em with the gleem
Yeah, my neck shinin' hit em with the gleem
Yeah, my teeth shinin' hit em with the gleem
With the gleem, bitch, hit em with the gleem
Iced out Draco, wild out with the team
The team
The team
The team
