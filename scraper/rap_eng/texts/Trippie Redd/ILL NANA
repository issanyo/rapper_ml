[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lala, lala, lala, nana, nana, nana

[Chorus: D.R.A.M]
Ill nana, she got that ill nana
Damn it feel so good, make me throw my kielbasa in that
Ill nana, she got that ill nana
Berry is so sweet, it make me throw my big banana in it
Ill nana, that ill nana
Ill nana, ill nana
Ill nana, ill nana

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Your bitch came through, gave me that ooh nana
I ain't even fuck that bitch, I got the top, that pussy too caca
Just bought a new choppa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, lil' bitch
I'm just smizzed a lil' bit
I just hit the lil' bitch
Told them grab from the back
Now I'm up at the top, they tried to hold me in the back
Told them pussy ass niggas that they are some shit bags
I've been countin' guap everyday, sit back
Fuckin' on your bitch, yeah, that bitch gave me the cat
Yeah, that bitch gave me the cat

[Refrain: Trippie Redd]
Kitty, kitty, pullin' up to your city, to your city
Bad bitch itty bitty, big titties
And a fat ass, gotta get that ooh nana

[Chorus: D.R.A.M]
Ill nana, she got that ill nana
Damn it feel so good, make me throw my kielbasa in that
Ill nana, she got that ill nana
Berry is so sweet, it make me throw my big banana in it
Ill nana, that ill nana
Ill nana, ill nana
Ill nana, ill nana
Ill nana, ill nana

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M]
Juicy Fruit, honey dip, plus she cute (oh shit)
Super cool, funny chick, wetter than an ocean
Swimmin' lesson teacher, I might drown on purpose
She want me in deeper, I might close the curtains
Oodles and noodles, spin on fork, suck up all the juices
Apple strudel, warm it up, cut a slice for you, shit
I might eat the whole thing, sharin' this is useless
Caught up in that ooh nana, vibin' to my new shit
Must be kin to Foxy Brown
Or use Pam Grier's toolkit
Or you just got the swimming pool kit
And I'm not one to kid around on some middle school shit
Just know that mushy pussy on some "ooh" shit

[Refrain: Trippie Redd]
Kitty, kitty, pullin' up to your city, to your city
Bad bitch itty bitty, big titties
And a fat ass, gotta get that ooh nana

[Chorus: D.R.A.M]
Ill Nana, she got that ill nana
Damn it feel so good, make me throw my kielbasa in that
Ill Nana, she got that ill nana
Berry is so sweet, it make me throw my big banana in it
Ill Nana, that ill Nana
Ill Nana, Ill Nana
Ill Nana, Ill Nana
Ill Nana, Ill Nana
