[Intro: Maurette Brown & Trippie Redd]
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
(It ain't over, it ain't over)
(It ain't over, it ain't over)
(It ain't over, it ain't over)
(Until your victory is won)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Don't talk to strangers
Since a youngin’ I’ve been totin' bangers
I might take that lil’ chick to Topanga
I said, "stop all of this, you in danger"
Yeah-eah, you in danger I might take your little butt to Topanga
Just don’t move like no bozo, no stranger

Stop you in danger

[Post-Chorus]
I can take you to Topanga
Open my hand like Jesus and save ya
Know I'm known to tote bangers
Said, "Boom-boom-boom, you in danger"
Stop that now, you in danger
Stop right now, you in danger
Stop that now, you in danger
Stop right now, you in danger, yeah
