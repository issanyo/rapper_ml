[Intro]
14 yeah
Yeah, lil 14 yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got it lit like a solar flare, solar flare, solar flare, solar flare
Solar flare, solar flare, solar flare, solar flare

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got it lit like a sun on a way
Getting money all day
Stackin' up my cake
There's no fucking time to even say it
There's no fucking time to even waste
Come with me, let me take you away
Let me take you to another place

[Chorus]
I got it lit like a solar flare, solar flare, solar flare, solar flare
Solar flare, solar flare, solar flare
Got it lit like a solar flare, solar flare, solar flare, solar flare
Solar flare, solar flare, solar flare, solar flare

[Verse 2]
Antidote, antidote, I am an animal
Eat you alive like a cannibal
Crush you like Danimals, yeah
Ball in the paint, nigga like Michelangelo
The flow that you spittin' not changeable, yeah
And I'm eating your flow like a cantaloupe, yeah yeah
Chasing all of this green baby
Chasing all of these dreams baby
Serving dope to the fiends baby
I'm just getting all of this green baby
I thought that you knew
I thought that you knew

[Chorus]
I got it lit like a solar flare, solar flare, solar flare, solar flare
Solar flare, solar flare, solar flare
Got it lit like a solar flare, solar flare, solar flare, solar flare
Solar flare, solar flare, solar flare, solar flare
