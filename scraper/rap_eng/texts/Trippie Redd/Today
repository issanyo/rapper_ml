[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, today is gonna be a good day
Damn, Goose!
14, yeah
Ooh, hey, ooh

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I don't know you I just got into your shit today
Lookin' like a million dollar lick today
Yeah, but you niggas ain't takin' shit today
All this ice up on my wrist, I might get sick today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Ooh, told the hoe to suck my dick, girl don't let go
Yesterday I didn't know, but now I know
So, yes I guess that was me with your hoe
Try to run up on me then I leave you six below
Low, drop lower than a limbo
Whoa, stomp that pussy nigga out in my Timbo's
Ooh, I am not from here I landed here in UFO's
Smokin' gas and blowin' O's
She, suck on that dick 'til she lose control
Hoe, you can't control me, do I look like a remote? (bitch)
Big drank you know I like sippin' fours
I like how you think, makin' you come share that dome

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I don't know you I just got into your shit today
Lookin like a million dollar lick today
Yeah, but you niggas ain't takin' shit today
All this ice up on my wrist, I might get sick today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
Ooh, yeah, that's the ice way
Diamonds 'round my neck I let the ice bling
Bitches chasin' nuts, bitch, this ain't Ice Age
Ooh, run up on me let my pipe bang, yeah
Ooh, aye, lookin' like a mill
You ain't really, really, in the field
Yeah, you need to chill
Yeah, you need to chill, boy
Swear you need to chill, boy
On my block, don't talk, they say I'm rude, boy
I just swerved off in a Coupe, boy
Please don't make me make you make the fuckin' news, boy

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I don't know you I just got into your shit today
Lookin like a million dollar lick today
Yeah, but you niggas ain't takin' shit today
All this ice up on my wrist, I might get sick today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today
Today, today, today
