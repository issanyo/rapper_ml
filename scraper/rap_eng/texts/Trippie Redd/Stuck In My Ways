[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I can't motha-fuckin’ change
I'm too stuck in my ways
Man you driving me insane
You still stuck on my brain
You can't go signin’ up for love
Not expecting pain
I still got a lot of blood
In my fuckin' [?]
Shorty don't play games with me
I don't do {?] pops of champagne with me
She know if she want it
It ain't a thing to me
Yeah, but it's so sad because it's over
So sad because its over yeah
