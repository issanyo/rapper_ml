[Intro]
Ricky Racks
No, no, for real
Not tryna feel

[Chorus]
Bitch, I told you I'm for real, not tryna feel
She wanna pull up to the field, she gotta kneel
You can tell me anything, the lips are sealed
Big dope before the deal, I use it as my shield
Bitch, I told you I'm for real, not tryna feel
She wanna pull up to the field, she gotta kneel
You can tell me anything, the lips are sealed
Big dope before the deal, I use it as my shield

[Verse 1]
As my shield, as my shield
You fucking broke my heart so now it gotta heal
It fucking hurts so much, I swear it isn't real
Thank you for switching up, I finally see the real you
The real you, the real you
Like riding bikes, you got my mind up in a loop
Mentally taking hikes while riding in a coupe
Mentally hella high, it help me count the loot
You working hella hard, my soul you gon' pollute
I wanna shoot, shoot
Wish I ain't gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Bitch, I told you I'm for real, not tryna feel
She wanna pull up to the field, she gotta kneel
You can tell me anything, the lips are sealed
Big dope before the deal, I use it as my shield
Bitch, I told you I'm for real, not tryna feel
She wanna pull up to the field, she gotta kneel
You can tell me anything, the lips are sealed
Big dope before the deal, I use it as my shield

[Verse 2]
Lost in this world with no place that I wanna be
I'm telling you, I loved you so faithfully
Fuck it, now the darkness the place for me
That energy can't handle the capacity
So I skrtt off in a race car
I tried to go to Mars, you made me wanna pop a bar, ah
All that bullshit is a love scar
You wanna make it hard then fuck me like a pornstar, ah

[Bridge]
The darkness, it waits for me
The darkness, it praises me
The darkness embraces me
Guaranteed

[Chorus]
Bitch, I told you I'm for real, not tryna feel
She wanna pull up to the field, she gotta kneel
You can tell me anything, the lips are sealed
Big dope before the deal, I use it as my shield
Bitch, I told you I'm for real, not tryna feel
She wanna pull up to the field, she gotta kneel
You can tell me anything, the lips are sealed
Big dope before the deal, I use it as my shield
