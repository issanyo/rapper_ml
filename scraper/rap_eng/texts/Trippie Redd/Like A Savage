[Intro: Lil Wop]
...in pieces watched her cry and laughed about it
4point0lehgo
I broke her heart in pieces watched her cry and laughed about it
Ayy
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Wop]
I broke her heart in pieces watched her cry and laughed about it
I been hurt too many times don't give two fucks about it
If shawty say she with me, but she lying, yeah I doubt it
I gotta run this paper up there ain't no way around it
Can't fuck with these lil' bitches 'cause these hoes be acting childish
Got 100k on Instagram but that pussy got mileage
That woman broke my heart I swear she turned me to a savage
But I still call her from time to time to fuck her like a savage

[Verse: Trippie Redd]
Ay she said that she in love, I think she love me not
I just called her up and beat the fucking box
Beat the box, beat the box, she in love with cock
Yeah I run the block where these bitches set up shop, yeah
Boolin' with some bitches, I been heart breaking hoes
And I'm laughing in they faces then I go and change clothes, huh
Pull up in a 'Rari bitch you know that I'ma glow
Yea I'm with Lil Wop we keep the beam and the scope
I ain't worried 'bout that bitch no more, no
I'm getting cash, counting all the big dough
I'm blowing dough, blowing big dough
Yeah, I throw her heart out the window
Bitch I ball like Kembo, huh
Need a vibe just like Kembo
Kembo, baby talking to my kinsfolk
Yeah this chopper made the bitch do the limbo, limbo yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wop]
I broke her heart in pieces, watched her cry and laughed about it
I been hurt too many times don't give two fucks about it
If shawty say she with me, but she lying, yeah I doubt it
I gotta roll this paper up there ain't no way around it
Can't fuck with these lil' bitches 'cause these hoes be acting childish
Got 100k on Instagram but that pussy got mileage
That woman broke my heart I swear she turned me to a savage
But I still call her from time to time to fuck her like a savage
