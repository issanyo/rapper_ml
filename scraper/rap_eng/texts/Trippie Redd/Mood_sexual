[Intro]
We got all the smoke

[Chorus]
Ooh, you got me in the mood
My mood is gratitude
My baby grab the tool
Big choppers on me, thats factual (factual)
Why you always wanna hit my line all sexual? (sexual)
And you know baby had my line on sexual (sexual)
The way she bouncing on that dick she flexible (flexible)
Told that little hoe my chopper is bisexual (bisexual)

[Verse: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, you know I keep a choppa on stand-by
Got my baby by my side she gon' stand by
Talkin' down on the gang, bitch you can't die (can't die)
Rollin' round
Ride or die
She's my burn or die
See everything with a 3rd eye view
Gotta bless a nigga like I said "achoo"
Married to the game like I said "I do"
My choppas go "bang bang"
Bitch yo shit gon' "pew pew"
In a field one, with some real ones
That's a real gun
Bitch, this shit real fun
Let us stay in church
Pussy like a real nun
And I'm rappin' 1400 gang you better build one
(Yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
Ooh, you got me in the mood
My mood is gratitude
My baby grab the tool
Big choppers on me, thats factual (factual)
Why you always wanna hit my line all sexual? (sexual)
And you know baby had my line on sexual (sexual)
The way she bouncing on that dick she flexible (flexible)
Told that little hoe my chopper is bisexual (bisexual)
