[Intro: HoodyBaby]
Yeah, ayy
Bitch, you know you suck, haha
Today was a, hood day, haha
Ayy, okay

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
Bitch, you know you suck
Your niggas know you suck
Your bitches know you suck
My niggas know you suck
You gon' end up broke
You gon' end up broke
We don't give a fuck
You know you fuckin' suck
Pull up in that Lamborghini, pull up real abrupt
Nigga fuck with me, we start a riot, we erupt
Got a double cup, this not a sippy cup
Bitch, I'm big as fuck, sippin' lean, giddy up
30 missed calls, I'm like, "What the fuck is up?"
My homie blowin' up, so I text him, "Fuck it up"
Homie, get that cash, you gon' get that guap
Uh, homie, keep it movin', keep on pushin', never stop
Shoot you in your thigh, call it hip hop
You be switchin' sides, you's a Gucci flip flop
Smokin' at the pound, ounces in the ziplock
Used to push work, Kid Rock
Now I move weight, now I'm movin' base
Now I got the work, I got bitches, I got safes
Bitches on the way, money in the safe
Bitches call me "Daddy," wish that I could switch his place, woo
HoodyBaby in the kitchen whippin' up the work
HoodyBaby in the kitchen, bitch, I got berserk
HoodyBaby in the kitchen, bitch, I gotta eat
Work on street, ten toes on my feet
Up, up, double up
I just poured like 15 sodas, then I doubled up
Trippie with me, got the 30 in the truck, uh
Rockin' with me, he made 30 off a buck
Gone, gone, get the money then we scram
Finesse a nigga with the blam
Finesse a nigga with the wham
Finesse a nigga then we gone
Finesse a nigga, goin' strong
Finesse a nigga, bitch, we on
Laugh about it, make a song

[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
Lifestyle of the rich and dangerous
I just wanted money, how the fuck I end up famous?
Bitches say they love me, how the fuck I end up tangled?
Up and away, fuck it, I ain't ever changing, yeah
Lifestyle of the rich and dangerous
I just wanted money, how the fuck I end up famous?
Bitches say they love me, how the fuck I end up tangled?
Up and away, fuck it, I ain't ever changing

[Vesre 2: Trippie Redd]
Ay, lifestyle of the rich and the famous (Yeah the lifestyle)
Bitches on my dick, they all scream my name it's (Yeah the lifestyle)
Big 14, bitch, you know that I'm famous (Yeah the lifestyle)
In the 'Rari coupe, I had to switch my lanes quick (Switch my lanes)
On that gang shit, fuck you and who you came with
Top down on the gang, pew pew blow, I'll split your brain, bitch
Hit like Jet Lee, mix it all with some Liu Kang, bitch
Bitch, I'm Armageddon, I hit you with this flame quick
Ooh, it just lit
Ooh, bitches lit
Bitches lit, ooh
Your bitch on my fuckin' dick
On that dick, ooh
She spit, then she like to lick
Licky lick, ooh
Bless it then I'm out that bitch, yeah

[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
Lifestyle of the rich and dangerous
I just wanted money, how the fuck I end up famous?
Bitches say they love me, how the fuck I end up tangled?
Up and away, fuck it, I ain't ever changing, yeah
Lifestyle of the rich and dangerous
I just wanted money, how the fuck I end up famous?
Bitches say they love me, how the fuck I end up tangled?
Up and away, fuck it, I ain't ever changing
