[Chorus]
I ain't nothin' but a lowlife
Makin' money in the shadows like a lowlife
Family never loved us, treated us like lowlifes
Sip that Actavis and now I got my act right, act right yeah
Ayy, I ain't nothin' but a lowlife
Living live like a lowlife
Sippin Actavis, I act right
Eat the pussy, got no appetite

[Verse 1]
Back to the city, I'm gone
Getting this money alone
Never needed anybody
Did this shit by my lone
Please don't get me out of my motherfuckin' zone
On the block with my pole, please don't hit my phone
If you do, leave a message at the fuckin' tone yeah
What's up
Haters see me in the hood and they like what's up?
Living life so good, Lil Trippie live it up
Shoot a nigga with this thirty if he actin' tough
Nigga bust quick

[Chorus]
I ain't nothin' but a lowlife
Makin' money in the shadows like a lowlife
Family never loved us, treated us like lowlifes
Sippin Actavis and now I got my act right, act right yeah
I ain't nothin' but a lowlife
Makin' money with the lowlifes
Sip the Actavis, now act right
Eat the pussy got no appetite

[Verse 2]
They can't change me
They can't stop me
I'm big papi
Yeah, ayy, bitch you bad as fuck
Come here mami
Come talk to me, woah
Get my money on the road
Makin' money off of shows
Fuckin' all the baddest hoes
For no fee
Yeah, I ain't nothing but a dirty ass lowlife nigga, wait
Makin' money though, yeah
Umm, yeah
