We need some people that'd kill for us
We need some people that'd die for us
We need some bitches that's gon' ride for us
Because this shit is so dangerous
This life I'm livin's so dangerous
The people around me so dangerous
The drugs around me so dangerous
This money on me so dangerous

[Verse 1: Rocket Da Goon]
Aye, this life I chose this shit get dangerous (rockstar)
I'm doin' so much drugs, I know this shit get dangerous (I'ma overdose)
I'm hangin' with the dope boys, you can't hang with us (with us)
When I'm goin' through some things, baby, fill up my cup (just fill it up)
Please just leave me alone, I want to be in my zone (zone)
In the studio late night, I don't even pick up my phone (I ain't pickin' up shit)
Pullin' up to the crib, paranoid one in the dome (maybe shooters in the bushes)
Spinnin' the block two times, make sure you don't follow me home (don't follow me niggas)
Politickin' on a ticket, me and my niggas tryna get it (tryna get it)
He said he want a chicken, I told him don't think about it
My nigga just get it (go grab that shit)
Whatever you with, I'm with it, you already know that (yeah)
I'm with the big homies right now, and they shinin' just like Kodak (I see ya)
I'm sippin' on lean (drank), I'm floatin' (dang)
I pop me a Percocet, I get in my emotions
You don't know where I been or where I'm goin' (where I'm goin')
I'm on Pluto right now, I'm focused (on Pluto)

[Verse 2: Chris King]
They don't know that I'm strange enough, to play with guns
The stainless ones, when cops come put your bangers up
Your favorite model paid to fuck, you roll your own
They lacing yours with angel dust
Spray 'em up, you say too much
Graveyard shift, a nigga he late too much
Pull the pin from a hand grenade and feed it to him
Looking like he ate too much, God damn
Slime bucket on your snotty nose
Clique kick, left his body froze
Seventeen inside the boot
Like my nigga's off of Hollygrove
Fuck my blunt, I never got it rolled
You a walking lick and you a pot of gold
I be sippin' on lean till my body fold
Fucking with rock is my hobby though
Put your body where nobody knows
You owing me, [?]
Come out you fuckboy, what you hidin' for
Your funeral, soon bye bitch, vamanos
She give me good head like a honor roll
And I got some good weed that I'ma roll
I am a king you should honor most
Stick to the script they didn't get a code
Sippin' on Wock, but you know we don't run out of Tech
Rocking Air Force 1's while gripping the TEC, that's a Nike Tec
Phoneline tapped, feds love to intercept
Hanging with the real right, get hit with the left
If you come disrespect
