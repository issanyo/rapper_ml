[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
They just mad because my time difference
The fact that I'm getting dough and I ride different
The fact that I'm fucking [?] and my prime different
I am not fucking with you blood, I size different
Yeah, take a bitch to the Barbados
I told that little hoe, bitch I'm a God like Kratos
Yeah, I build you up like some Legos
Yeah, better yet I sculpt you like some play-dough
Better do what I say or my say so
Lil' bitch 'cause I'm worried bout my Pesos
I been stunting hard, lil nigga got a bankroll
In and out of foreign cars, I'm in a Range Rover

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
I got my Wraith umbrella, they throwing shade over
I sip this bottle 'til the bottle got a hangover
Pinch your face with this chopper that's a makeover
I'm still totin' that shit that they throw gang over, yeah
You let shit slide that we will bang over
I give that bitch this [?] she go insane over
The type of bitch [?] and she blowing brain for it
I'm like get out of the country, everything gon' be foreign
You boring, while I'm round touring
You big [?] but I'm big scoring
Up like a big eagle, bitch I'm soaring
Bitch bring the motherfucking forest back in

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
They just mad because my time difference
The fact that I'm getting dough and I ride different
The fact that I'm fucking [?] and my prime different
I am not fucking with you blood, I size different
Yeah, take a bitch to the Barbados
I told that little hoe, bitch I'm a God like Kratos
Yeah, I beat u up like some legos
Yeah, better yet I sculpt you like some play-dough
Better do what I say or my say so
Lil' bitch 'cause I'm worried bout my Pesos
I been stunting hard, lil nigga got a bankroll
In and out of foreign cars, I'm in a Range Rover

[Verse 2: FreeMoney]
On the road to riches, dodging feds like potholes
Had to get it off my wrist, with pyrex and hot stoves
Meeting with my migos he just popped off a [?]
...

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
They just mad because my time difference
The fact that I'm getting dough and I ride different
The fact that I'm fucking [?] and my prime different
I am not fucking with you blood, I size different
Yeah, take a bitch to the Barbados
I told that little hoe, bitch I'm a God like Kratos
Yeah, I build you up like some Legos
Yeah, better yet I sculpt you like some play-dough
Better do what I say or my say so
Lil' bitch 'cause I'm worried bout my Pesos
I been stunting hard, lil nigga got a bankroll
In and out of foreign cars, I'm in a Range Rover
