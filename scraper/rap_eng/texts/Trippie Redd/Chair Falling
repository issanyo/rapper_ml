[Intro]
Huuuah, I was just uh
Kickin' back in my desk
Puttin' in work, yuh, Big 14
Guess I fell out of my chair

[Hook]
I was kickin' back puttin' in work
I was kickin' back puttin' in work
It felt like Chair Falling, felt like Chair Falling

[Verse 1]
Scratch my head, blood up in my hair
It is redd
Slimes I'm wit' will rise
Bleedin' redd, you know how it go
Shoot instead
Ask questions later
Feel like Darth Vader, yuh, red beam bitch
Hit a fuckin' hater, countin' all this paper, aye
Ain't puttin' work on my paper, aye
Put in work, aye but I put in work, put in work

[Hook]
I was kickin' back puttin' in work
I was kickin' back puttin' in work
It felt like Chair Falling, said it feels like Chair Falling

[Verse 2]
They like Trippie, what you doin'?
Aye, what you thinkin'?
Turnt up on the weekend, aye yo' bitches geekin'
Geekin' geekin', sneakin', peekin'
Aye, she be freakin'
She be sexin', I be nuttin', in her mouth
In her house, at her crib
What you thinkin'?
Man you niggas hella fooh
Bitch, that's what I'm thinkin'
You niggas ain't worth shit
You count up Abe Lincolns
Countin up them racks, bitch
Yea, countin up them racks, bitch
You know how it's brackin'
And I ain't never ever lackin'
Ain't never ever slackin'
Don't never ever get the pack in
I'm at the top, I'm at the top aye
Fallin' out my chair, fallin' out my chair

[Hook]
I was kickin' back puttin' in work
I was kickin' back puttin' in work
It felt like Chair Falling, felt like Chair Falling
