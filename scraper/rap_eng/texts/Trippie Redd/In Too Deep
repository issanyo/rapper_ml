[Intro]
I wuv' Trippie Redd
Trippie
14 Yea!

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the future and my plans
I'm gonna be good, it's in God's hands
I won't look back, there is no chance

[Chorus]
Said I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep
Quicksand, baby, said I'm in too deep
Said it's up to my knees, baby, in too deep
Said I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep

[Verse 1]
In too deep like a bottomless hole
Change my number just like summer clothes
If you slime, then wipe your fucking nose
Keep a Glock, I never trust a hoe
Two-faced-ed, two-faced-ed hoes
Ain't got no time for no two-faced-ed hoes
I just sit back countin' blue faces, blue faces, oh, ayy
Countin' blue faces oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the future and my plans (Said I'm in too deep, baby in too deep)
I'm gonna be good, it's in God's hands
I won't look back there is no chance

[Chorus]
Said I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep
Quicksand, baby, said I'm in too deep
Said it's up to my knees, baby, in too deep
Said I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep
Said I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep

[Verse 2]
Pulling up with gang
Diamonds shining in my chain
I do not fuck with no lames
They say Trippie Redd insane
Blow your fucking brain
Chopper eat away a nigga's face
From that fucking mud (From the mud bitch, yeah)
What you know bout that fucking mud
Don't get too deep in that fucking mud
All my shooters they will fuck you up
For a dollar they gone fuck you up
For a dollar they gone fuck you up

[Chorus]
Them niggas in too deep, they in too deep
Said I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep
(Said I'm in too deep)
Quicksand baby, I'm in too deep
Said it's up to my knees, baby in too deep
