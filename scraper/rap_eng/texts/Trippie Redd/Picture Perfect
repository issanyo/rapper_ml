[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Baby, stay by my side, by my side
Ride or die, you and I, you and I
To the sky, through the night, through the night
Let the stars pass you by just for the night
'Cause baby, I'm a professional, just to let you know
Oh, just to let you know, baby, I'm a professional
Yeah, I'm Mr. Perfect (Picture perfect)
Oh yeah, baby it's me, I'm Mr. Perfect
Picture perfect, perfect, bitch, I'm perfect

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
I'm with Rocket, so bitch, we're gon' go to space
All this drink up on me, bitch, can't feel my face
I'm too tight, bitch, I ain't got no time to waste
I've been eating good, lil' bitch, I need a plate

[Verse 2: Rocket Da Goon]
I promise all my niggas going to have a plate
I came from my pussy, got a jump gate
All my niggas go Gorilla and we rocking Bape
And I'm not from this planet, 'cause I'm out of space
And I took a phone, boot it up right now
And I promise that I'm not coming down (Coming down)
So much drink, that I think I might drown (I might drown)
Hot fashion, yeah, plug dressed down
Bitch, I'm hot, make your bitch wanna bust down
But I came from the block, where niggas tote Glocks
Yeah, dope boy shit, tryna run up a nock
Tryna kick your doors, tryna run up from the cops
'Bout to wipe a nigga nose, like they got a little snot
I remember lookin' through all them windows
I was fifteen walkin' with a pistol
All my niggas gave me hell, yeah, the drip cold
Thumbin' through blue hundreds, yeah, you ain't touch those
I remember watchin' big homies cook dope
Red bottoms kickin' down your front door
What the fuck them niggas talkin', I ain't with shit
Pull up right now, I'm going to fix this

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Baby, stay by my side, by my side
Ride or die, you and I, you and I
To the sky, through the night, through the night
Let the stars pass you by just for the night
'Cause baby, I'm a professional, just to let you know
Oh, just to let you know, baby, I'm a professional
Yeah, I'm Mr. Perfect (Picture perfect)
Oh yeah, baby it's me, I'm Mr. Perfect
Picture perfect, perfect, bitch, I'm perfect
