[Verse]
In the studio every night, late night
Mama said, "Please don't let me down"
With my goons, with my niggas, they protect me
They don't let me down
And I'm 1400/800, nigga talk down and you want beef now
Yeah my 800 goons pop out
Young nigga I bring the streets out
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want, pussy, tell me what you want
No war
You don't want no war
No war, ayy
With my troops, with my troops
And you niggas won't let me down
Let me down
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down

[Chorus]
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
Shawty, please don't let me down
'Cause I'm up right now
Ayy, shawty, please don't let me down
Ooh, ayy
'Cause I'm up right now
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down

Don't bring me down, bring me closer to God
Don't bring me down, bring me closer to God
Don't bring me down, bring me closer to God
Bring me closer and closer and closer to God
Bring me closer to God, yeah, bring me closer to God
Closer to God, bring me closer to God
Closer to God, closer to God
