[Intro]
Aye, whoo, bands, real niggas, whoo

[Verse 1]
Real niggas live by the code
Catch a nigga lacking with my fucking bros
I don't fuck with opps all y'all niggas hoes
Met a few women, y'all can get exposed
With my nigga 9, yeah, up the pump
Put it to your nose and your body froze
Doing trill, catch another body though
Like that's my fucking hobby yo

[Hook 1]
I'm a real nigga in the field witcha
Do a trill with you and my lil' niggas
Keep it trill papa, couple bills witcha'
King Trippie keep it real witcha'
I'm a real nigga and a field witcha'
Doing trill with you with my lil' niggas
Keep it trill papa, couple bills witcha'
King Trippie keep it real witcha'

[Verse 2]
Lil nigga let them llamas fly
Leave a young nigga so traumatized
Told me gas shit , all my niggas ride
Don't make me make another momma cry
Doing trill, catch another homicide
Based nigga, you got butterflies?
Choppa at your 30, you afraid to die?
King Trippie, nigga, fuck the other side
Juug, juug , got all this jewelry
Man this shit ain't new to me
Your bitch new to you, she ain't new to me
I ain't really with the fucking foolery
Pussy nin in these fucking diamonds
Bad bitch and I'm fucking shining
Got a bad bitch from the fucking islands
Take trips to the fucking islands
Cause these guys don't realize
When they talking fly, man it's suicide
Don't talk through it, nigga, do or die
Nobody else, nigga, you and I
Big choppa, I might let the bullets fly
That red dot right between your eyes
Yeah I play pussy, what you niggas try?
Cause that gon beat the night, you niggas die

[Hook 2]

Roll them fucking blunts, aye
Back them fucking blunts, whoo

[Verse 3]
Gang gang nigga, we the best see
Dare a nigga, try and test me
Got six shots in these cowboys
Head shots, nigga, you deadbeat
Cause I don't fuck with no fuck niggas
If I catch an opp, I might bust nigga
Bands all in my fucking pants
Reason why I don't trust niggas
Cause niggas be on that slurp shit
When you wide in the jungle, nigga
Niggas die in my slurp but
On the gang, we gotta rumble nigga
Cause I'm sitting high and I'm fucking hoes
Real niggas slip on the fucking code
Went from late nights, pushing buttons cold
In the Louie Truey, and I'm fucking cold
I got a trap queen, gotta up the pole'
And if a nigga talking, then I'm fucking smoke
King Trippie, no fucking joke
Man, I rep my hood like a fucking coach
Winning meg, hope you die smoke
You white pill like the fucking snow
All for that codeine and I'm leaning nigga like a fucking slope

[Outro]
Aye, leaning off of that codeine, whoo!
