[Intro: Trippie Redd & Lil Wop]
Dat way, yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, trap
Dat way, woah, yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, trap
Ayy, ayy, ayy, trap

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I see these niggas my enemies
Keep playin', I'ma unleash my inner beast
Bitch I ball, got the best Tennessee's
Twin choppers, I feel like I'm Pistol Pete, woah

[Verse: Trippie Redd & Lil Wop]
Playin' with my money, I'ma play with your life
Sippin' on the dirty sprite, might punch out your lights
Got the draco by my left, got Lil Wop to the right
Ice on freeze, yeah I hope you nigga see the light
Like the gun
Your bitch on my cock
I'm just on the block, boolin' with a lil thot
That bitch gave me top, [?] the mop
Airin' out your spot, yeah
I was boolin', countin' guap with your bitch, ayy, ayy
Bitch it's Lil Wop, I keep a trip, ayy
I got a hundred round drums in my stick, ayy, ayy
You kiss that bitch, my dick was on her lips, ayy
My dick was on her tongue, got my hand on my gun
Better pray to god like a fucking nun
Got her out of sprung, I don't play no games
Wanna fight, better catch my fade
Blowin' dope (blowin' dope bitch)
Blowin' reefer, ayy
You can't see us, ayy
Yeah we so high, you can't see us ayy
God bless all my enemies

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I see these niggas my enemies
Keep playin', I'ma unleash my inner beast
Bitch I ball, got the best Tennessee's
Twin choppers, I feel like I'm Pistol Pete, woah

[Outro Trippie Redd]
Sayin' god bless my enemies, yeah
Sayin' god bless my enemies, yeah
Swear I got a lot of enemies, yeah
Twin choppers like I'm Pistol Pete, woah-aye
