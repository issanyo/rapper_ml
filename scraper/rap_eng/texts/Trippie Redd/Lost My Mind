Tank God

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said, I lost my mind
Yeah, said I lost my mind
Yeah, ayy, said I lost my mind
Yeah, yeah, said I lost my mind

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
I said I lost my mind
And I can't feel my face
I said I lost my mind
I'm tryna  keep my boo
But this shit get real
Yeah, this shit get real
Man, this shit get real
We don't take clean deals, yeah
We don't take clean deals
Me and my niggas need the mills
Yeah, my niggas need the mills
Shootin' choppers and Galils
I'm just shooting choppers and Galils
We just ridin' in the Hills
We just mobbin' in the Hills
We just , don't start actin' like this in the Hills

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said, I lost my mind

Yeah, ayy, said I lost my mind
Yeah, yeah, said I lost my mind

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Got some more, smokin' on the gas
Niggas, tell 'em we don't do that
Couple chains, then I bust down, do the math (woo)
Schizophrenic, got it two bags (yikes)
Hella icy, all these rocks, I'm a rockstar
Middle finger to the Ops and the cop cars
I got .30 in the toaster, fuck a Pop Tart
Bitch nigga, you ain't in our squad

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said, I lost my mind
Said, I lost my mind
Yeah, said I lost my mind
Yeah, ayy, said I lost my mind
Yeah, yeah, said I lost my mind
