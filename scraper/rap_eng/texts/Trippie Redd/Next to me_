Oh with my niggas and we scheming
They got no hearts cause they some demons
You want my soul and you can keep it
I got no heart said that's my weakness

Or that's my strong point, not my weakness
Wait that's my strong point, not my weakness
Is this hell or [?]
[?]

The devil could be standing right next to me
And I'm still gonna fulfill my destiny
And I won't let it get the fucking best of me
Til I die, fuck nigga what left of me
