Big 14
What the f-- is goin' on bro
Okay, I swear

[ Chorus ]
I swear to my momma, I swear
I swear to my family, I swear
I swear to all my friends

[Verse: 1]
I don't know if I still love her, i don't know
Don't got time for a ho
I'm on the grind lil ho
Sippin' wine lil ho
Yeah I'm doing all these shows
Blowing dough with some hoes
Got some good Act to pour, yeah murder what she wrote
And you know I took her soul
I always take her soul
Love scars woe
Baby love scars woe
Baby hurt to the bone, yeah hurt to the bone
I got your bitch hitting my phone
She want the dick on the low
Yeah I thought you should know
Said I thought you should know
Run my whole fucking hood like a pope
Yeah murder what she wrote
I said murder what she wrote
'Cause you know I took her soul
Yeah you know I took her soul
You know I took her soul
But I won't be hittin' phone

[ Chorus ]
I swear to my momma, I swear
I swear to my family, I swear
I swear to all my friends
