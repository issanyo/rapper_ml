[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Big 14 bitch, big 14 bitch, Yeah

[Chorus]
Living in this fucking life of sin, yeah
Hoping that the God'll let us in, yeah
Open up them gates and let us in, yeah
I blow it down with the FN
If that's my brother, that's my brother til the end
That's my brother not my motherfucking friend
That's my woadie, that's my slime, that's my kin
This is a Wraith, this ain't no motherfucking Benz

[Verse]
Swerve, swerve, swerving
I count it 'til my fingers hurting
Tryna do this shit, I make it perfect
Sippin' all this drink, I lose my purpose
Try to test me then it's curtains
You ain't nothing but a bird steady chirping
I done made it out the motherfucking dirt bitch
That just came from serving niggas like a clerk bitch
Yeah like a clerk bitch
See them snakes up on my grass them is serpents
Kick the pussy niggas down 'cause they worthless
Test my gangsta, I'ma kill you that's for certain
God won't be blessing you
God blessed me like I said "achoo"
Diamonds dancing on me and they saying "peekaboo"
Electrify that nigga like I'm fucking Pikachu
Yeah keep a chopper, I might pop you
Phone 'em they gon' drop you
She gon' suck the dick, and she need a sponsor
Took that bitch to Berri's, got that bitch some lobster

[Chorus]
Living in this fucking life of sin, yeah
Hoping that the God'll let us in, yeah
Open up them gates and let us in, yeah
I blow it down with that FN
If that's my brother, that's my brother 'til the end
That's my brother not my motherfucking friend
That's my woadie, that's my slime, that's my kin
This is a Wraith, this ain't no motherfucking Benz

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're brothers, we're happy and we're singing and we're colored, doo-do-do-doo, Big 14 bitch
