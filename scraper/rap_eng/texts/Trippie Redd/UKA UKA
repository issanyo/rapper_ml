[Intro]
Yeah, Big 14 know what the fuck goin' on, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ooh, said I made y'all (said that I made)
So how could I be mad that I ain't y'all? (mad that I ain't)
Same reason why I hate y'all (I hate what I hate)
Hop up in this 'Rari then I race off, ayy (race off)
Do the dash in this racecar (racecar)
Got the Pistol Pete on me, is this a face off? ayy (face off)
Better say your damn grace dog (damn grace)
Blind in reality just like you're Ray Charles (Ray Charles)

[Chorus 1]
Ayy, I don't want no more pressure
No, I don't want no more pressure
No, I don't want no more pressure
Ahh, don't want no more pressure
Ahh, don't want no more pressure
Ahh, don't want no more pressure, ahh

[Verse 2]
Ayy, fuck your bitch and hit my fucking dab, oh
Ayy, choppers by my side, you know it clap, oh
Like your bitch ass, big bag
Big cash, and I tote a big gat
Aftermath, I'm just dressed in all black
Got the black mask
I'll pull it out the motherfucking black bag
Ooh, yeah, and drop your ass
Bang bang, lil nigga you left in the past
Ooh, ayy, son these niggas, I'm your dad
Big racks on my body, baby got this cash
Pray these goofy niggas really goin' out sad
Give these pussy niggas hell like I'm Johnny Gat, ooh

[Chorus 2]
Swear I want no pressure
No, swear I want no pressure
No, swear I want no pressure
No, swear I want no pressure
No, swear I want no pressure
No, swear I want no pressure
No, swear I want no pressure

[Verse 3]
Ooh, ayy, ooh, are you niggas really from the field?
Or are you niggas really from the hills?
I got a mob of niggas coming by the mills
They'll shoot your ass down boy from 1400 kills, for real
I'm tryna find your fuckin chill
I'm off this Actavis, I'm tryna pop a seal
I don't do Xannies baby, no, don't do no pills
I'm just smokin on dope, baby
Just thumbin' through the mills, so ill
