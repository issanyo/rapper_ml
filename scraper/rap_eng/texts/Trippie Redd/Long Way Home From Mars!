[Chorus]
It's gon' be a long long long long way home
I'm on Mars and it's a far far far place from home
Travel by my 'lone 'lone 'lone, by my 'lone
It's gon' be a long long long long way home
It's gon' be a long long long long way home
Did it by my 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone
Them boys all alone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone
Did it by my 'lone, It's a long way home

[Post-Chorus]
Long way, long way
Long way, long way, long way
Savage they post in the hallways
I keep my strap on me always
Shawty say she gon' fuck with me
Baby just fuck with me long way
Long way
Long way, long way
Long way, long way
Long way, yeah

[Verse]
Fuck with me long way, fuck with me, yeah
From the streets hard way, had to eat yeah
Feed the streets, yeah we gotta eat some way
Feed the streets all day, feed the streets, yeah
I'ma take your soul, please don't try to fight it
I'ma take your soul like I am Ho-seiden
This is my wave, please don't try to ride it
Know me from the streets, boy we need some guidance

[Chorus]
It's gon' be a long long long long way home
I'm on Mars and it's a far far far place from home
Travel by my 'lone 'lone 'lone, by my 'lone
It's gon' be a long long long long way home
It's gon' be a long long long long way home
Did it by my 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone
Them boys all alone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone
Did it by my 'lone, It's a long way home

[Post-Chorus]
Long way, long way
Long way, long way, long way
Savage they post in the hallways
I keep my strap on me always
Shawty say she gon' fuck with me
Baby just fuck with me long way
Long way
Long way, long way
Long way, long way
Long way, yeah
