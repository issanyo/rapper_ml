[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I hope you gon' bust it like a drum
Especially if you tryna meet my mom
I got a brick on my arm
And baby, it's legally blind
We still be busting them MACs
We don't do no fussin' relax
I'm going up with the sack
I only speak facts and count racks
My hunneds better be blue
What you speak better be true
Keep your receipt, that'll be proof
We aiming heat outside of the roof
Sippin' on mud, but I made it out of that
My boys, I'm sprayin' bout that
And I really, don't care about shit
I was thinking you should make your way around here

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
If you thinkin', we can

Just need to know you're ride or die-ie-ie
I'm just hoping that you bust it like a pistol
Bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol
Hope you bust it like a pistol
Bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol
Hope you bust it like a pistol
Bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol
Bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol, bust it like a pistol
