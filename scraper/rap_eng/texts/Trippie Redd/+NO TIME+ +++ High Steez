Yeah, yeah
Lil 14, lil 14, lil 14
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Had to go and get it up in no time
Bad bitch with me now and she do coke lines
These niggas they lame, they like to co-sign
Diamonds all up on my wrist, they make you go blind
Gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, yeah yeah
Gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, yeah, yeah
Gotta get it up in no time yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Bad foreign bitch with me, you know I love her with all my heart
I swear this rap shit won't tear us apart
She was the only one to see my shine when a nigga was left in the dark
I swear I eat this 808 like a muhfuckin shark
They say, "Young nigga play a part", yeah yeah
Better play a part, yeah yeah
Better play it smart, yeah yeah
Give it all your, yeah yeah
You better play it smart, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I was outside boolin' with my people
Had to get the money, ain't have time
These niggas wanna take up all the shine
I been gettin' money on the grind

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Had to go and get it up in no time
Bad bitch with me now and she do coke lines
These niggas they lame, they like to co-sign
Diamonds all up on my wrist, they make you go blind
Gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, yeah yeah
Gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, yeah, yeah
Gotta get it up in no time yeah yeah yeah

We always turned up like we wanted to
All my niggas, yeah, they want it too
Tell the bitches, get inside

You say how you can't find me

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Had to go and get it up in no time
