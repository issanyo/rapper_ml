Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse}
How the fuck you ever try to play me?
I thought you was my love, man, I even called you baby
You played me, went from my love to Slim Shady
Now demonic thoughts in my head, is she crazy?
Thanking God for everything I got, told him to save me
Do whatever for my OGs, nigga, that's who raised me
You made me blind to reality, that shit from gazing
Yeah, I said that shit is all from gazing
Now I’m swerving round in this Mercedes
Yeah, you can love me or you hate me
You just mad 'cus that pussy nigga ain't me
I’m gettin' money, I ain't gon' let that shit phase me

[Outro]
I'm good [?]
No cap
