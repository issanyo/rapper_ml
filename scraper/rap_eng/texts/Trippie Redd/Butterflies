Shawty tell me are you down?

[Verse 1]
I just need you closer
Come over I'm feeling closure
Are you in need for love?
I won’t leave you as a loner
Wii two, just Kinect, plug it in
We can start as friends, just fuck and love again
But it’s only if you down
Shorty yeah I’m in town you should come
And see me shorty don’t you leave me
Yeah, I’m giving your heart a piece
Yeah, don’t give me your heart; a tease
Yeah, if it’s one thing that I want it is you
Yeah I’m down Yeah I'm down, ha
Tell me what you wanna do
Whisper in my ear

Do the dash shawty, yeah
Don’t go fast shawty, yeah
Relive the past, replace my task

[Chorus]
Ok she is mine, yeah

Got her on my mind, yeah
Dancing all the time, yeah

Got her on my mind, yeah
Dancing all the time, yeah
And she driving me insane

[Verse 2]
Kaylee coupe I’m driving
Your feelings that I’m riding
Shawty you feel alone?
You can call me on my phone
Don’t eva delete it, my love just keep it
Lemme shake that ass, rebuild your heart
Fuck it cas, may this last
Won’t let a broke boy love you
Won’t let a fuckboy touch you
When I’m with you it’s just lovely
My mind go dummy, butterflies in my tummy
Damn them lips taste yummy
I see sparkles in your eyes, promise I ain’t telling lies
Lets get high, ride a kite
Tell me what is on your mind
Because I can’t see them
Hit me with John Cena, wash me out; Katrina
Beautiful Catalina, white like Tina
