[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ooh, baby, what you wishin' for?
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains, it pours
I don't know how to wish anymore
I don't know how to wish anymore
Or do I?

[Pre-Drop: Trippie Redd]
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
Ooh, ohh, ahh

[Drop: Trippie Redd]
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?

[Verse: Trippie Redd]
I wish you would find your chill
'Cause Lord knows this shit get real
And for this price you know you'd kill
Man it's big brackin', know the deal
Man it's big slatt, you know the deal
Draco a big dragon, fire and hell
Can't save me man, save yourself
'Cause I do not need no help

[Drop: Trippie Redd]
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Ooh, baby

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains, it pours (Keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (Keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore
Or do I?

[Bridge: Trippie Redd]
Wish you'd get out my face, might go MIA
Might just blow my brain, I'd be Kurt Cobain
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face

[Drop: Trippie Redd]
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Baby

[Post-Drop: Trippie Redd]
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
