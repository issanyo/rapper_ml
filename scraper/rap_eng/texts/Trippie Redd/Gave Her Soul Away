Polluted with shine
But you was refusing to climb
Up for blessings
Saw potential
More credential
Hard to vent with
Of regret and love is tense
And they have horrible lesson
Fuck these hoes man they all finessing
All finessing
Fuck these hoes man they all finessing

She can't ride on this dick no more
