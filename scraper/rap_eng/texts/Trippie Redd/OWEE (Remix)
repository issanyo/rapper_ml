[Intro: Duwap Kaine]
Lookin' for twelve when I'm in the A
Smokin' on gas when I'm in LA
Lookin' for twelve when I'm in the A
Smokin' on gas when I'm in LA
Lookin' for twelve when I'm in the A
Smokin' on gas when I'm in LA

[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Duwap Kaine]
Ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy
Ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy
Hold up, baby, ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy
Hold up, baby, ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy
Hold up, baby, ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
1400 Gang, bitch I keep me some shooters
My chain shine hard like your momma medulla
I'm stoned up in the club, bitch I feel like Medusa
You talk down yeah, pussyboy I'ma shoot ya
I'm a gorilla ay, yeah big bank
I'm about my skrilla, ayy
Yeah I'm getting all this money, big drug dealer, ayy
Trippie Redd bitch I'm with the feelin', ayy
Oh yeah, bitch I'm really into villiany, ayy

[Verse 2: Duwap Kaine]
Sippin' on some lean, pour that shit up in my lemonade
Play the bih like a arcade, .40 on me let it demonstrate
Ayy, cutthroat like a switchblade, niggas know I'm not bitch-made
My niggas gon' run fade, gettin' money all the broad day
In a foreign, move out my way (Skrt)
Real Gucci no it's not fake, never sneakin', never thrown' shade
She love my song, it's on replay
Niggas talk, out the AK, niggas talk, that's everyday

[Bridge: Duwap Kaine]
Lookin' for twelve when I'm in the A
Smokin' on gas when I'm in LA

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy
Hold up, baby, ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy
Hold up, baby, ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy
Hold up, baby, ah, ooh, I hit the bitch from the back and she like ah, ooh, ayy
