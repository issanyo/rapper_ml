Woah youngin youngin

I been sitting back on a bong
Tryna think about it that was wrong
I should've never left you that was wrong
I should've never left you that was wrong
I been sitting back on a bong
Should've never left you that was wrong

[Verse 1]
Think about the days and the songs
I think about the prays and the loans
Baby I just miss you every now and then
Baby i just wanna kiss you every now and then
Every now and then I think about you everyday
Now just me one chance to pray
Just give me one chance you're my little blossom
By the way you're my little blossom
You're my little blossom blossom
Baby yeah you told me you was crazy
I'm starting to believe you it crazy
Now you break in the feeling
Now I'm just sipping on line plus it crazy
Name a song for me wait
Lick it on a letter im sorry sorry
Talking bout me in I'm sorry sorry...
