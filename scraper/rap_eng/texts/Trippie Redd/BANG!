[Intro]
I can't do this anymore, trying not to be ignored
Put my pedal to the floor, I spread my wings, I let them soar
Let them soar-oar, let them soar

[Chorus]
I can't do this anymore, yeah
When it rains it really pours, yeah
Like an eagle, Imma soar, yeah
Desert eagle, let it roar, yeah
Let it bang-bang, let it bang-bang
Let it rang-sang, let it bang-gang

[Refrain]
Baby yes you're mine, baby yes you're fine
When I'm on the road, do I cross your mind?
When I'm on the road, baby yes come ride, yeah

[Bridge]
Let it bang for me, rang for me
She let that shit sang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
Yeah let it bang for me (bang), yeah let it bang for me (bang)
Yeah let it bang for me (bang), yeah let it bang for me (bang)

[Refrain]
Baby yes you're mine, baby yes you're fine
When I'm on the road, do I cross your mind?
When I'm on the road, baby yes come ride, yeah

[Verse]
New Chanel walkers when I walked up in the room
Maison Margiela when I walked up in the room
Bunch of dope smokers when I walked up in the room
Iced out Motorola when I walked up in the room
Woadie with my chopper, talking down and boy you're doomed (bang)
Used to want a 'rari, now I'm rich I bought a coupe (bang)
Now I'm switching lanes and I never keep a roof (bang)
You going out sad, all they do is laugh at you
Yeah I gotta get it for my mama and my sisters and my nephews and my nieces, love 'em all
Hope you niggas really ready for the fall
When it all comes down, who can you call?

[Chorus]
I can't do this anymore, yeah
When it rains it really pours, yeah
Like an eagle, Imma soar, yeah
Desert eagle, let it roar, yeah
Let it bang-bang, let it bang-bang
Let it rang-sang, let it bang-gang

[Refrain]
Baby yes you're mine, baby yes you're fine
When I'm on the road, do I cross your mind?
When I'm on the road, baby yes come ride, yeah

[Bridge]
Let it bang for me, rang for me
She let that shit sang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me yeah
Yeah let it bang for me (bang), yeah let it bang for me (bang)
Yeah let it bang for me (bang), yeah let it bang for me (bang)
