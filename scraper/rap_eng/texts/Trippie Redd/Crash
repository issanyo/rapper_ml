[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Ouu, ouu
Deadstars (ouu)
Big 14 who the fuck is you
Purpp wit me and you know we is on juice
14
Skettittt
Yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I'ma crash in it
Brand new Aston Martin, I'ma crash in it
Swervin', switching lanes, I'ma crash whippin'
Moving full speed, do the dash whippin', woah-aye
I'ma crash in it, woah-aye
I'ma splash in it, woah-aye
I'ma crash, whippin', woah-aye
I'ma crash

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
I just pulled up in a new Ferrari
Might cop me a new Bugatti
Pulling up six-speed Maserati
Fucked your bitch at the afterparty, woah-aye
I'm just boolin' with the gang, talk down pussy, snatch your chain
What's your name, you got no fame, yeah
They say Trippie Redd insane, hundred rounds right at your brain, tu-tu pop, don't know no names
Yeah we don't play no games
Said we don't play no games
In the Aston Martin, know that I'm switching up lanes

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ooh, I'ma crash in it
Brand new Aston Martin, I'ma crash in it
Swervin', switching lanes, I'ma crash whippin'
Moving full speed do the dash whippin', woah-aye
I'ma crash in it, woah-aye
I'ma splash in it, woah-aye
I'ma crash, whippin', woah-aye

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Saint Laurent boots, got my feet locked
Niggas getting left at the streetlight
Twin Glocks on me, I got two pipes
Off a few Percs, leave the ice out
Whole gang know to keep a tool, aye
Looking at my neck, at these jewels aye
Lil Purpp loyal, not a fool aye
And the Percys got me sitting like a stool aye
Hundred bands all on my shoes, aye
Fucking that bitch, she's your boo, aye
I pour a four in the deuce, aye
She suck me and my nigga today
Pull up I might drop the roof, aye
I drop the top on the coupe, aye
VS1 all on my tooth, aye
I'm off the xan, cut the coupe aye

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, I'ma crash in it
Brand new Aston Martin, I'ma crash in it
Swervin', switching lanes, I'ma crash whippin'
Moving full speed do the dash whippin', woah-aye
I'ma crash in it, woah-aye
I'ma splash in it, woah-aye
I'ma crash, whippin', woah-aye
