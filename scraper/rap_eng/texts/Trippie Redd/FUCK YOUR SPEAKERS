[Chorus: Chris King]
Call me if you need me, pullin' up (pullin' up, yeah)
I know you see me bitch, well eat it up (eat it up yeah)
It ain't no tellin' what is in my cup (what's in your cup, yeah)
Fuck your speakers, let me beat it up
Call me if you need me, pullin' up (pullin' up, yeah)
I know you see me bitch, well eat it up (eat it up yeah)
It ain't no tellin' what is in my cup (what's in your cup, yeah)
Fuck your speakers, let me beat it up

[Verse 1: Quan'ta]
She on the way, lil mami on the way
Hit my phone, you hit the gate
Let valet bring you this way, ayy
'Cause tonight you on my plate
Eat you up, no creme broulet, ayy, ayy
(eat it up, I eat it up, ayy)
She see the sauce, I be drippin' on these niggas, ayy
No double cup, I be sippin' on these niggas, ayy
It ain't no telling, got no feeling for these bitches, ayy
She ride my wave 'cause she see I'm getting paid
No time for the gossip, I be in and out the way
I be in and out the stores, you can catch me getting paid
Catch me on the plane, I be in and out of state
You can catch me in the VIP, I'm just tryna make a play

[Chorus: Chris King]
Call me if you need me, pullin' up (pullin' up, yeah)
I know you see me bitch, well eat it up (eat it up yeah)
It ain't no tellin' what is in my cup (what's in your cup, yeah)
Fuck your speakers, let me beat it up
Call me if you need me, pullin' up (pullin' up, yeah)
I know you see me bitch, well eat it up (eat it up yeah)
It ain't no tellin' what is in my cup (what's in your cup, yeah)
Fuck your speakers, let me beat it up

[Verse 2: Chris King]
Rollin' weed to pass the time
Cannot smoke, you not matching mine
Some of these niggas they have to rhyme
My trap is boomin', they after mine
Strapped with toolies, gats for crime
Came with yours, I'm packing mine
Stumbled in your honeycomb
Watch them yellow jackets fly
Prepared like a field trip
And I don't need no permission slip
For all them niggas I kick it with
I'll probably make a million with
Fuckin' up the streets in an old school with the chameleon drip
Feel the love and the bitterness
Blowin' bands, don't remember it
I'm pulling up like exercise, I heard I'm the next to rise
I learned if you do not chase your dreams then it will pass you by
I'm moving paraphernalia, I just watch that fucker fly
She wanna see a shooting star, well fuck the sky, just

[Chorus: Chris King]
Call me if you need me, pullin' up (pullin' up, yeah)
I know you see me bitch, well eat it up (eat it up yeah)
It ain't no tellin' what is in my cup (what's in your cup, yeah)
Fuck your speakers, let me beat it up
Call me if you need me, pullin' up (pullin' up, yeah)
I know you see me bitch, well eat it up (eat it up yeah)
It ain't no tellin' what is in my cup (what's in your cup, yeah)
Fuck your speakers, let me beat it up

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd]
They cannot be us, they cannot see us, they try to defeat us
The pussy I beat up, these tracks man I beat up, 10K for features
You ball on a budget, your rent is my luggage, I get money fuck it
Ayy beat it up, I beat it up
Brought her to the crib and then I beat it up, I eat up
Chillin' 'til the morn, your bitch hit my phone
Want me beat it up, I'm gone
I'm hitting her alone, pull up to her home
Put some dick up in her dome
Singing this lil song, talkin' 'bout how

[Chorus: Chris King]
Call me if you need me, pullin' up (pullin' up, yeah)
I know you see me bitch, well eat it up (eat it up yeah)
It ain't no tellin' what is in my cup (it ain't no tellin', nah)
Fuck your speakers, let me beat it up
Call me if you need me, pullin' up (pullin' up, yeah)
I know you see me bitch, well eat it up (I know you see me)
It ain't no tellin' what is in my cup (what's in your cup, yeah)
Fuck your speakers, let me beat it up
