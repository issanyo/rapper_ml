[Intro]
The wicked clock goes tick-tock
Freezing time as it rides down your block
'Cause it's timeless
'Cause it's timeless, you dig? Yeah
Ooh

[Chorus]
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
Wicked, them stars in my ceiling
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
Wicked, them stars in my ceiling

[Verse 1]
Floating around in a Wraith every day, out in space
Smoked the first blunt in the day
I feel omega today, I feel colossal today
Floating around, outer space
Speed of light, don't wanna race
Keeping the opps on the chase
I see stars all in my cake
Superstar, I need a cape
"How you feel Trip?" I feel great
Laser beam open your face
And it won't leave a trace
That's why I'm feeling so safe
Damn I'm in love with this place
Took my bitch on a date
Gaze at the moon and stars today

[Chorus]
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
Wicked, them stars in my ceiling
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
Wicked, them stars in my ceiling

[Verse 2]
Jump out the whip and just float
I got some things you should know
Always keep faith and keep hope
I ease the pain with the dope
I ease the pain with the dope
Blowing this smoke
I just love blowing these O's
Keeping my mind comfortable
Hope I don't overload
I feel like time, it just froze
This is the life that I chose, yeah
Man, 'cause I'm timeless, yeah
Get treated like your highness, yeah
Hope the solar system don't leave you blinded
(Wicked)

[Chorus]
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
Wicked, them stars in my ceiling
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
We'll go to the moon and the stars
Wicked, them stars in my ceiling
