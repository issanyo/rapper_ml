[Samples]
Y'all feel it?
Open up your eyes wide
Open up, open up, open up your eyes wide
What now, kid?
Open up your eyes wide
Open up your eyes wide
What now?

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
I fell asleep on my lover, had a dream about another
Now he's shaking on my shoulder
Asking me about that brother name
That I was calling out, "Tyron", he bit mad
Now my secret out, sleeping on the living room couch
Ain't tryna run a game, but he's still doing it in town
He said he watched me as I slept, then I laid there with a smile
No, he right, cause in my mind I was like
"Don't wake me up now
Don't wake me up right now"
I was talking fact to the effective "M-m, girl"
Now he up and he mad, it ain't "M-m, girl"
My dream lover got my real man mad as whoop!
Ain't no secrets under these sheets like, [?]
Okay-kay-kay
Close my eyes, and now I can't watch what I say
Got me telling on myself, now he feeling away
Cause I was dreaming 'bout someone else today

[Chorus: Torii Wolf]
I'm talking in my sleep
Where my shadows crawl out of me
With a blind eye and my mouth wide
I'm talking in my sleep
(Y'all feel it?)

[Verse 2: Torii Wolf]
Let the blinds fall
And the night is young
Unlock my vault
Full of my secrets left unsung
And I fall deep
With you next to me
With my eyes closed
But my mouth goes
(Y'all feel it?)

[Chorus: Torii Wolf]
And I'm talking in my sleep
Where my shadows crawl out of me
With a blind eye and my mouth wide
I'm talking in my sleep
(Y'all feel it?)

[Verse 3: Torii Wolf]
I tell you I love you
And I try and stay true
But when I sleep talk you baby
You find out what I do
(Y'all feel it?)

[Chorus: Torii Wolf]
Darling, I'm talking in my sleep
When my shadows crawl out of me
With my blind eye
And my mouth wide
I'm talking in my sleep
(Y'all feel it?)
I'm talking in my sleep
(Y'all feel it?)
