[Verse 1: Add-2]
You know we bout to hit the scene right?
And you know I rep the 'Go like a green light
Gimme room I'm bout to do my thang
Just have faith, like Biggie shorty ain't no pootie tang, but you don't hear me
God damn, that boy good! Well good done got better
Now I got jams like Cosby got sweaters
Like birds that got feathers, Fonzie got leathers
Like Musiq Soulchild I put words together
Ain't no uh-uh telling what these niggas'll do
When you see they falling off like Bishop in Juice
Mean they probly diss they momma for a couple of views
Think I wasn't gonna blow up but it didn't diffuse
And they mad just like the hatter, you could follow the pattern
Or get lost quicker than Judy from Family Matters
It's the wah, wah, chika, chika, rah, rah, oh!
If anybody asks it's that nigga Add-2

[Hook: Add-2]
When the day turnin' into night
It's ok, we gon' be alright
Yea that's just the way that story goes
Life fast, gotta take it slow

[Verse 2: Add-2]
The rhyme killing no filler define
Nigga no mind sicker, I shine like Ma don for Dilla
My pen pushes the page, you tryna hang like a pinup
So what? You push kis I drop lines like [inner?]
That's that sick wit, spit shit, this kid get fierce
Kick rhymes in white Nikes white as Ric Flair's hair
Pardon, Your Honor, you want no parts of the drama
When I'm there, you ain't there like Martin and his momma
Doesn't matter, like glass I'll shatter your plans
If I got a black Caddy I'm calling it back advance
May God bless my city, pray that they let them breathe
Mothers ain't growing flowers but they burying seeds
Falling like fall leaves, friends blow in the breeze
Kinda like the Gibb brothers cause they wanna be Gs
'Fore they turn to Colonel Taylor, gotta let em be Preach
And this verse is on the house like Snoopy when he sleeps

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
24 hour turnover, the black An. Jolie and I'm anti-freeze
Been through the pits and cold weather, I adapt like old leather
Got royalty in me, call me James I'm mo' Etta
Blew it off like Mo' Better
I'm mo' better been through the blues and blacks
I too got a clique sweater
Doctored the scar, squeezing me hard like mammograms
Embrace the ambulance, killing y'all
By the millions, diligence for those that spit sili-cons
Silly cons, I been illy since I was really, um
This high, knee high, I mean lie where no eye could see
Spy, you dies, we multiply
Homie told me today we gon' be alright
Cause no matter how dark it get we wait til a brighter light
Shit, so please never call it quits
From the 'Go to the Raleighwood, my niggas it's all good

[Hook]
