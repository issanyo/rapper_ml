[Intro: Bluu Suede]
We doing this song forever
Keeping this on forever
Shining star in my life
Sun up, sun down
Don't be wanting nothing
Real shit percent 100
I'm just showing my love
One love, one love
Get a little
Get a little
Get a little
Get a little

[Verse: Rapsody]
I work like a ball champ this is my shining moment
Thought they could beat a nigga, often last shot going
This is the true blue, yeah I'm gon' really blow
Sold all my sneakers just to EP this two years ago
Def Jam deal fell, fuck it that's how it go
I paid dues to pay dues, the idea of beautiful
Box me like cubicle, niggas can't do it
I am more than two titties in viddies I ain't Frank Lucas
Rap dope dealer higher than heroine users
Deals they come and go, they all are abusers
High as we used to know, first time used it
I am rap nigga, nigga strung out just like acoustic
Flow translucent acting like they don't see me
Playing like they don't, passing over CP3
Kobe 24 shit, here's another repeat
Here's another repeat, fuck where the respect be
I am M-dot-E, the rap-rooted alien
Going back to kill again, notify the next of kin
Stuck like Gilligan, Flow over millions
Studied the best, the rap big William
Jigga, my nigga, rise like helium
Too big for mediums
Double XL's tryna squeeze me the L again
So over that, lookin' up, only see my chin
Colder than Michigan
No synonyms to compare me
I'm fairly rare in this world we in
But I'm still here

[Outro: Bluu Suede & Rapsody](x6)
Get a little
Get a little
But im still here

Somebody
Somebody

This is my shining moment
This is my shining moment
