[Intro: Rapsody]
Why be thinkin' 'bout no technicalities?
(Eric)
H-huh

[Hook: Rapsody + Heather Victoria]
They know who I am, yeah
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am, huh
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am
(They know, oh, ohh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(They know, oh, oh)
Yo, huh

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Hate my weaknesses
45s on the bars like I'm on that yard, federal
Want some new leather, I'm better weather bound
I-8 like oh my, I'm down like a low high, aloha
A low ha when they talk crazy, buenos nochas
All of us is ovals, circle one, that's perfect
I ain't seen an nawh' one like my mama closed the curtain
Don't be flirtin' with your gift, you better marry it—you nervous?
Don't be scared of euurk euurk nothing
I'm scratching those been fronting
Never played the lottery like y'all, most of that's worth nothing
Got no time or money to be wasting, honey, honey
Auntie shared some wisdom, say in life you must be cunning
You must be stunting with a body like, "Good God."
I ain't got the best, but ain't nobody like, "Who ya?"

[Hook: Rapsody + Heather Victoria]
They know who I am, yeah
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am, yeah
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am, yeah
(They know, oh, ohh)
They know who I am, yeah
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am, yeah
They know who I am, huh

[Bridge: Heather Victoria]
They know who I wake up bein' every mornin'
Everyday I wake up lacin' my Jordans
They know who I wake up bein' every mornin'
They know who I wake up bein' every mornin'

[Hook: Rapsody + Heather Victoria]
They know who I am, yeah
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am, yeah
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am, yeah
They know who I am, huh

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
You don't know me, but you know me
Faith is believing in something they'll never show me
I respect LeBron, but I love me some Kobe
It's something about a winner, you gotta be winter, I'm cold, see
Respect to all old Gs
I keep my soul like an old Raphael Saadiq speech
Lack masculinity, I miss you
Sad they call it hate when we speak on some of them issues
But we can't go ssshhh no more
I'm just trying to be all I can be for y'all
Cause Ruby Dee and Maya's gone
And we gotta keep the fire strong
Back when my hair was long
And I was 100 pounds watching Viacom
New the powers of words
Rapping about more than what cars we on
Zim Zimmer, who got the keys to the Beamer?
I like to party too, who got balloons and some streamers?
I dream of arenas like Arenas playing in
But they say that the music I'm making ain't paying many dollars
My purpose is priceless, lah lah
La La Anthony got hazel eyes
See the world the same in brown and green
Think money make you, you ill advised
We can't change like dyes
So make music like this so you don't forget
And always remember and recognize
—who you are (Who you are)
Who you are (Who you are)

[Hook: Rapsody + Heather Victoria]
They know who I am, yeah
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am, huh
(They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am
(They know, oh, ohh)
(They know, oh, oh)
