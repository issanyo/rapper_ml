[Intro - Rapsody]
Rap
Eric G
Cultural varying
One Love for black music
Jamla is the squad
Well Alright

[Verse - Rhapsody]
These are the Brad Pitts
Legends of fall fall
Thinking of Michael and Whitney burns me like alcohol
Every night momma call, giving me more advice
Things in media got her fearing my music life
All of the bright lights, all of the fallen stars
Pray for the black kids all the leaders they grew up on
Moving along fast, feeling like day fast
Digesting's a hard task, all I want is our music back
Reagan Era dope rap, Mercedes to Maybach
Black rappers unless we gon' keep to drive that
Gunnin' runnin' 110 an hour 'till the wheels flat
We permanent like two tats on hoodrats nigga fuck that
Yo, first LB break up, now every day I wake up to more bullshit
I couldn't make up, tre like a Laker
Handle with my face up, the lord pray I shall not quit
So catch me, running like a stampede of horses
Rings around you niggas, polygamy no divorces
Passing you like some courses, lay you flatter than forces
Houses with old porches surrounded with country orchards
It's [Yup] the beginning of forever
Raining on parades in places they thought we'd never weather
Whether, radio ever play a nigga
I don't make music for radio but for niggas
My nigga, my people, a weapon I need though
Better get down on your knees and pray to heaven I don't see you
Nigga the line's been drawn
Niggas taking shots I guess the wicked get stoned
So some other fuckers buy cars and get blown
No respect, no respect, no respect homes
While Niggas in Paris they ballin' Watching the Throne
I was at home, yo
I was on the phone, telling momma hold on
This music shit hard if you plan to be lone
Like legends of the fall, legends have fallen
Michael, Whitney, just want you to know that you're all in
My memory
