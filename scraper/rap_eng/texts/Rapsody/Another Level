[Hook: Lil' Fame]
Bang, bang, bang
Show off, show off
When we connect, we connect on another level
This is respect on another level
When we connect, this is respect on another level
On another level, on another level, on another level, on another

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Complexion ain't entitled, complexion is in title
What's a stream to a tidal? I'm coming for all titles too
From the state of the baby blues, and I ain't talking New York City, fuck with me, it's biblical
I'm the Genesis, you what Jesus is to Christmas
A reason to say you're gifted, uh
He want born in spring though my nigga wow
Spit that real Mayweather for all you Pacquiao's
Rest in peace to the Wolf Pack-uiao's
I've been dying to coach you, you got no style
Address em with all vowels, ay I owe U nada
Only my seeds could remake me, like Straight Outta Compton
I might son, I might son
So cold, Korea to season they can't fuck with me
Yeah, wannabe stars
Wanna be king to a jungle that was never really yours
I'm cruising and running yours, I'm a giant to all your cars, bars
Loose shit don't appease me
I've been off of that young shit like Jeezy
Yeah cry me a river, a teenie
I'm Wiz with this here, mah'fuckers can't see me
Know who you talking 'bout, I chalk you out
And I don't mean murder, I teach you niggas how to be me
Not in this life time, fuck I'm out my right mind
That's how I love 'em though and this one here's a breast stroke
Statik on the beat, yeah that's what you call easy
(Bang, on another level, this is respect on another level)
The devil told me he need me
Jahlil Okafor, you need 7 feet to fill these shoes
I'm walking on water
I'm God level with flows, in Atlantic talking business
I ain't talking fees with cruise ships though, I cruise this
Brown Sugar, the Black Messiah to all the new kids
Look what I did, you all looking like pupils to what I is
On another level, you mah'fuckers can't buy shit
That's respect, live wire on my Kentucky
Fuck that nigga, that's how I feel you ain't lucky nigga, real spit
On my blackout, Kunta with his back out
They try but can't kill me, that's the route of it all now, unstoppable

[Hook]
Bang, on another level
This is respect on another level
On another level, on another level
On another level
