[Hook: Heather Victoria]
Can't let nothing get in the way
It's a hustle
Had to pay dues just to make a way
It's a struggle
I'm getting mine baby
Yea, yea
I'm getting mine baby
Yea, yea

[Verse 1: Big Krit]
Back one mo' 'gain - life couldn't be better
Shit changed, I Liu Kang, kick it wherever
Bottom feeders, never reach us, ties severed
Bird hoes, come and go I ruffle they feathers
Ever since I flew the coop I been shitting on niggas' stoops
Fast forward Caddy doors, mothafuck a Subaru
Play ball or go home, I'm swinging for the fence
As soon as I could pay my rent, I ain't been the same since
Breakfast Ruth's Chris, lunch at Del Frisco's
Philippe's dinner, green prawns, damn I might get those
I'm popping like Crisco, window came tinted
Now I'm riding something foreign with the woodgrain in it
Word to Dutch, cobra clutch these bucks and never let go
These hoes suck and fuck like what! - cause I said so
Retro, more like deadstock with my wordplay
My life's a vacay er'day
Krizzle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Krit]
I just wanna ride clean with five screens - digidash
Adjust the mirror, flip the signal - then hit the gas
The road to riches, filled with detours, thatâ€™ll block my path
But I'm official, to my bone gristle, just check my tag
That candy paint was a mixture of hues
Don't be confused by the blues
That fade into purples and grains
Just know I'm doing my thang
Since way back, I had that, straight crack
Since I rapped on that 8-deck
And them hood niggas used to play that
Like he got potential
I heard that youngin, he saying something
Don't fall victim to materialism, you know it's coming
Just keep on jumping, above the rim
And anybody that can't be happy that you dunking, don't fuck with them
I listened up, pressed my luck and hit it big
They figured Krizzle would fall off quicker than drawers on a stripper
But never figured this
That I'd remained unstained, still a king remembered in time
They could never block my shine
I'm live and in effect nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Night time ?? flow
Locked like white folk car door
When you ride through the bad part of town slow
Jack you for your Acura
That's how the hell I'mma act up
Put fear in they heart like Cassius
Claiborne isn't in fashion
But what they study at NASA mean
Choke you out like Death Row
Flow in turn is a balcony
Beg for life when I touch the mic
Rap and I'm gunning for all emcees
Autumn leave and I change my rap
Flow for days, lap for lap
Secretary of triple crown
Flow, charisma, I'm lyrical
In turn the throne it waits me now
If you wait me now, gotta a big big pound
Like a dapped up Shaq with a triple crown
Triple threat like Michael crown
King and queen no castle now
In the capital, North Raleigh
Feel it deep down in yo body
Can't stop me like [O'Dolly?] partna
Can't tear apart the grind
Like Northern Stars I shine
Success comes to me and you and those who think it in they minds
So shine
So shine
My nigga
