[Verse 1]
Billie Holiday, I sing your blues
Bet your life against me and I swear to God you’ll lose it
Muthafuck the cops, we still singin’ for St. Louis
Super easy flow, shit I could do it while I’m snoozin’
Trippin’ off the dope again like Pookie out of rehab
Talkin’ money you ain’t got, steady makin’ me laugh
Call it funny paper like a Sunday praisin’ Jesus
The world goin’ apes again, I swear we need a Caesar
I told him I ain’t single he still ask me can I see ya
I told him he ain’t too smart why them other ladies D ya
Your scorin’ inefficient, I’m just talkin’ business
Numbers never lie when you been shootin’ high percentage

[Hook (x2)]
Go ‘head (go ‘head), go ‘head (go ‘head)
Go ‘head (go ‘head), go ‘head (go ‘head)
Go call the cops on us I’mma go start some craziness drama
Tryna be patient Obama don’t make ‘em bring out them llamas
Go ‘head

[Verse 2]
It’s intense when your color this immense
Throwing shade so much a nigga never needed tent
Either way it’s darker, I save myself a couple cents
I’m smarter than the average, we just talkin’ bout the rent
Home of the free uh, livin’ in America
Cold, cold world I guess we all is Nancy Kerrigan
Thought they’d let you skate through, or run like Marion
Let you reach your goal and then they call you ol’ arrogant
Jordan ‘85 and shit, break a foot in all they asses
Book sense, common sense, that’s two separate kind of classes
I’m just in another space, you just on the same planet
Range shootin’ out at things, I ain’t talkin’ the Atlantic
Call me Plymouth Rock baby, no thanks given though
Only thing I’m thinkin’ now is how to flip another flow
I ain’t talkin’ commercials though, I know I’m talkin’ progressive
So over your heads my homie said count your blessings up
It’s about ten I see and I ain’t speakin’ Memphis
Talkin’ bout patience, gifts, friendship bein’ relentless
Boy I got some wings and I ain’t speakin’ on Bentleys
But if I ever get one you know I’m whippin’ on Indie
500, hunnid, I tell you mu’suckas I’m comin’
Whether man or you woman, boy I’m a beast if you frontin’
Bring it back to your front and
Bring it back to your front and
Bring it back, rewind, it’s nuthin’ to shine, so I
