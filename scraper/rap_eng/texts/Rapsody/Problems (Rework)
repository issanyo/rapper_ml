[Verse 1: Moss Kena]
Im hurting
I'm learning how to feel
Trying to deep need
What does that mean?
For real

[Pre-Chorus]
"Boy don't worry about it"
Is what I tell myself
You ain't got no issues
And you don't need no help
Keep drinking gonna drown those sorrows
Pour out the feelings that you bottle
It's okay, cause we ain't promised tomorrow

[Chorus]
Problems
Seems everybody got 'em
Everybody tryna solve 'em
Only thing we got in common
Problems
Seems everybody got 'em
Live with or without 'em
Only thing we got in common
Problems

[Verse 2: THEY.]
I'm so deep, I'm drowning
In the thoughts and the fears around me
And my feet can't touch the ground
And I can't see the shore
Sayin' what they say about me
Throw dirt on my name and doubt me
The pains that I keep inside
That I don't think they know
I can't deny it, I've been going through things
It is what it is, we all have our...

[Chorus]
Problems
Seems everybody got 'em
Everybody tryna solve 'em
Only thing we got in common
Problems
Seems everybody got 'em
Live with or without 'em
Only thing we got in common
Problems

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Everybody got issues, try and not to worry 'bout it
Tell myself, I'm only human, it's okay to cry about it
If I had a .22, I'd have prolly been and shot it, thinking to myself, know a lotta people talk about it, know too many people love me
Throw away the bottle, twenty-two police
Puttin' twenty-two inside a body. Mama, mama, this is hell
Better days started coming
Everybody got problems, but you gotta keep running
Through the forest like Forrest
Better days, that's what God got for us
Faith make a marriage, think forward
Without faith, I know the rich man's poorer
Don't look back, remember Sodom and Gomorrah
It's part of life, problems, we gon' have more of
Long as you're breathing, homie, life's still guardless
The only point that matters, gotta keep scorin'
Yeah, through life's problems

[Chorus]
Problems
Seems everybody got 'em
Everybody tryna solve 'em
Only thing we got in common
Problems
Seems everybody got 'em
Live with or without 'em
Only thing we got in common
Problems
