[Intro: DJ Drama]
Footnote!
Kendrick ain't mention no females
Rapsody we gotta change that
Boss!

[Verse 1]
For my people all on them hundred blocks
For all my brothers that's trying, ducking a hundred shots
Trying to stack hundreds we cometh 9th said to lead the squad
Blacked out and the army back me with Molotovs
Burn Molly
I'm in Raleigh, finger to all the laws
We don't follow rules they ain't meant to protect none of y'all
Camisole - They want us to feel underneath
Young dreamers, they kill our vibe but I won't bereave
I'd rather sweat one than cry a beach
Work harder till we all Carter's and Patricks D's
Work harder till we at Harvard, the black elite
New rules, new school, our generation deep
Our gene erasing if we ain't taking the time to lead
Death to YOLO I live Soulo without the seed
Control system it ain't controlling we, Hiiipower, Most Dope, Culture Over everything

[Verse 2]
From Anglo Saxons to niggas stacking
We bragging
We came a long way from picking cotton
I bask in the glory of all my brothers rising up
And shed a tear for all the ones that's on that molly dust
Ain't trying to preach just trying to reach baby it's all love
My father told me he got bout twenty more years with us
Got me thinking how short this life is, we all giving up
And God don't give us luck so get it or just give it up
Words of wisdom I heard in the kitchen my mama cast
And I ain't Yeezus but damnit it's dark so I'mma spazz
Old class I got it from all them legends
I'm in different lane but we parallel like 11
And three sevens it gets dark but I never lose sight of heaven
The sun don't shine, if I ain't rhyming I'm second
To none confidence of Big Pun when I'm on the record
And if you know I'm Hannibal Lecter resurrected
Holy as Hova and this my grail
I spill blood over it knowing that I'll never fail
Tripping on reacts when they catching I ain't male
Can't inhale so you'll never catch this winner holding a L
Eric, it's apparent the squadron is gon' prevail
Jamla the squad bringin' hell
For real

Ion know fail
I can't spell it
I only know to keep going ain't um and keep jealous
Stay up
Stay up
Confidence swelling
Ion know how to fail
I canâ€™t spell it nigga
