[Intro]
As I lay
Here today I

[Verse 1]
I find it hard and I find some inspiration
Why you hatin’? Fuck it, go in one these ones that hatin’
It’s nada, but shots and that real, cheaper than Izod
My iPod, I'm rollin’ and bumpin’, pullin’ in Popeye’s
That’s only chicken in me I’m fearin’ none of these robots
I’m in the class with these Big Willie niggas and [?]
The only difference between me and them is what’s in their wallet
And I ain’t Wallace but damn I got some paragraphs
A few stories could tell you, could make you cry or laugh
You know the pitiful come-up days when we had no cash
Got me thinking back earlier, damn we came through swag
And we all feel like winners when we see [?]
Go Kendrick, done told these niggas that this ain’t tennis
Ain't no love for you zero-ass players, lose or win it
That’s the bottom line rules, it’s on the news
And we should line up more than on Saturday for some shoes
As I wait impatiently on the daily for the new ruse
It’s only new to you but my independence been cool
Write it when they ain’t give us riders, the right to choose
Ain’t that Wright brothers, I’m right brother, Carolina, the blues shit
Humid today, still human today, you crazy B
Heated ‘cause they all got defeated with their inaccuracy
They was taking shots, just plotted inside the [?]
Good or better, I bet you your cheddar, I’ll be a rap elite
Still writing [?], sharp as a blade
Sorry parlor, you can holler, whatever to the new slaves
We throw shade and we feel accomplished
Purchase ice just to stunt on each other, buy our honor
Take a second my nigga, breathe out, throw in a comma
Know it’s much to take when you wake from sleeping, deep in a coma
Yeah, but I ain’t with that drama
I’m only with this Drama
Only rap from Jamla, coolie go fill up the comments
That’s how you feel?
Women can’t rap, you bumpin’ my shit
I guess it’s all just a symbol like hieroglyphics
That things change, I still love you the same
And I’mma rep forever, that factor remains
