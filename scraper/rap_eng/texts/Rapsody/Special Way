[Verse 1]
I love you like a fat kid love cake
Love the way you listen to me; before you eat, you say grace
Mama called me today, told me she'd die for me
Still got love for you niggas that wouldn't cry for me
My story start on the twenty-first of the winter
And it's cold, I've been baring my soul just like a pin-up
In the summer when it's hot we be rolling without the tint up
And I miss the good old days when good music came through antennas
When it's 10 up in the morning we wake up like “How we end up?”
But I'm glad we did handling biz, baby you in it
That's real love, it ain't been different since the beginning
We covered all bases and still we're going for innings
No need to make it complex baby, that’s what its meant for
That's word to my center, I shelter you like we indoor
Because I care about you
And anybody that’d want to hurt it I’d paralyze you

[Verse 2]
You're like that feeling of a father's first son born
Unconditional, I fell the speed of asteroid
In love, I send kisses and hugs to old misters
With all my goodbyes, finally completed my picture
The colors so descriptive
My heart resembled Christmas night
Gotta glow the window to my soul shows Christmas lights
Woke up to greatest gift; God read my list last night
I had a dream and what I seen was simpler than black and white
They don't like to take advice
You don't love when you see it so, look I have lapped you twice
Fruits of our labor are dying we need love in life
Call up your station, we need train all our people right
Cuz in the station they evaporatin' rapidly
Word to Oscar, give him Oscars for his great mastery
Depicting a story we know too well, I love you niggas
In the most special way and know that we always witchu
Love
