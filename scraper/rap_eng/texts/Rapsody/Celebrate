[Hook]
Soirée of the masses
Toast to a beautiful life
Raise your glasses
Celebrate, the life
Looking like its gon’ be a wonderful night

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Welcome to the party life
For those who seldom pardon life
To celebrate the good times
Got my check today, on time
And all my close friends
Celebrating new beginnings here
For those turning another year
For the youngins in the world learning how to steer
I celebrate um all
Celebrate for the fact that we all living y'all
And for my girls
All rocking new jewelry in this world
Congratulations
Celebrate for the parents out here raising
Little offspring
Celebrate if you single here without a ring
Cuz you kicked em to the curb
He was bad news to my sistahs I say word
Celebrate the game
If for only a day you live in fame
And celebrate the old days
Growing up broke, po', and hungry
Cuz it made you who you are
I celebrate forever everyday like I'm a star

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Raise a glass with the masses
Celebrate for that full tank of gas and
For ever test passed
That lead to a different world
And a better class
Or you bought some new fashions
That you just need a reason to show your ass in
Celebrate for that
Celebrate cuz we beautiful and we black y'all
And if you got that new job
Celebrate cuz everyday living is hard
If your glass full of Palmer
Raise it high y'all for every single mama
And you over all the drama
And you just feeling Mary y'all I promise
We gon' have a good time
Pop a little bubbly and sip a little wine
Reminisce for a bit
Celebrate if your house made of bricks
You got a roof over your head
Food in the place so our bodies all fed
We celebrate all night
Celebrate wit' your husband or your wife
And if you feeling a'ight
Toast for everyday y'all and celebrate life
