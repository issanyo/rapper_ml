I don't know what to do
Don't you dare to deny it, I'm always reminded of you

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
I apologize for rapping over heads
Being so classic, forgive me
For making it look so easy
I'm sorry, I don't care about TV
I apologize for rapping over heads
Lord Jah, forgive me
This hip hop is so in me
Quick please, forgive me
I apologize for rapping over heads
Being so classic, forgive me
For making it look so easy
I'm sorry, I don't care about TV
I apologize, I apologize, I apologize, I apologize

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
I'm reminded of my shape
When I'm around, y'all ain't straight
I'm sorry I'm so great that most of y'all don't relate
Metaphor so deep, trying to give them credit like Chase
But I know that time's wasting, I'm sorry I cold faced it
All my jams ain't party hits, I'm thinking about modern racism
I'm thinking 'bout Mike Brown, what my nephew might have to face it
I don't talk about it
Sorry, I'm so classy, I don't come up out this bra
I don't have to, I'm so raw
And I got a younger bruh, pray he's never murdered by law
I'm sorry I don't applaud for the times to talk about God
I'm sorry I walk around looking coonish to be a star
And you wearing medium when you really need extra large
Just to fit in, I'm sorry, I'm offending, I got these bars
Sorry, I'm not nominated for BET awards
When you be E.T. they alienate all you from your star power
Shitting on the game like my stomach sour, eww
I'm sorry I had to throw in that for simple appeal
I'm sorry my label is killing it with no majors, no deal
Funny how the ones selling records are the ones rapping for real
Future sold 100, Kendrick sold a hot mill
You do the math and take a bath in salt water, I hope you heal

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
(I'm sorry)
I ain't beefing with these sisters
(I'm sorry)
I don't get off on wearing designer zippers
I ain't watching stupid television by these niggas
We talking Love & Hip Hop I'm thinking 'bout Brown Sugar
I'm more into sports, tobacco road
Famous don't appeal to me when I'm touring the globe
So it don't hurt me so much I ain't heard on radio
I'm sorry my respect level got nothing to do with Vogue
What you know? I'm sorry
I don't do this for Ferrari's
I'm sorry I got a lane and don't need to copying Rari
I'm sorry I don't act like them
And I don't got no problems with Black Jesus being on Adult Swim
What you know? I'm sorry, I ain't sorry
For none of this shit I wrote
Robin Williams died today so you need to hear this the most
Money and fame don't bring no one happiness, that's a quote
Mo' money, mo' problems - you know how that shit go
I'm sorry, they won't play me like old Atari's
My general small, but production team be scarry
I know it's far from fair
Sorry y'all don't catch my lines like Jordan dropped the blue pair
