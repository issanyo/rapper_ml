It could be the point of letting go
It could be the one (it could be better)
It could be the point of letting go (one more time)
For
It could be the point of letting go (third time’s a charm)

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Scam money don’t make money
Be your own boss, make more than they make from you
Gotta lose old friends cause some of them cancerous
Let go and make different moves, everyone can dance with ya
Know that you pray to God, make prayers and He’ll answer ya
I chose to leave Kooley High but I love ‘em, we family bruh
Gotta leave home sometimes to see from a different view
Let go of control sometimes and watch how some others move
Everything is a chess game, I learned how to play well
Let go of them lame dudes, peace out to wack females
Go get you a real one so you learn how real love is
My people said go ‘head, I’m on it like Kim Fields
Facts, facts, facts
These are the facts of life
If you get it wrong, let it go so you can get it right
The point of letting go, no major signings from the start
Is because God wanted us to sign with the Roc

Your ego gon’ hold you back
My ethos was in [?] since ‘76
Got a lot of hood in me, that’s why the hood love me
Ain’t grew up in the hood but I learned from my play cousins
Played with the boys when I was growin’ up, boy
Can’t listen to reason if you still stuck in the noise
Boy, I feel like Roy Williams, tryna ram all of my boys up in a big truck
Drive niggas, let go of ouside niggas
Outside niggas, it’s a big, big world
Letting go of your past, [?] light years
Look around, you ain’t gotta let go of rounds to get around ‘em
Switched up my goals threw ‘em off to get around ‘em
I’m airin’ where the pack is at
I’m movin’ up a lot, yea, airin’ out distractions
To focus on my errands, ah, I’m go arrogant
New destination when I get up in the air again

[Chorus: Hiatus Kaiyote]
Point of letting go
It could be the one
It could be the point of letting go
For
It could be the point of letting go
It could be the one
It could be the point of letting go
