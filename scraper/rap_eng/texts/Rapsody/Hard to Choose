[Verse]
It's when you walk out on faith
Choose to do what feel right, let everyone else trace
What we chase ain't the same
I'm still that rapper that your favorite rapper scared to rap after
Sometimes it's hard to chill, choose to kill, kill, kill, kill
I'm just that good though I ain't worth a lot of millions
When you rap this well a lot of rappers catch feelings
We all want the best, don't let a female kill 'em, yeah
Hard to choose culture over fame
You just want to be set and take care of all your fame
It don't make you, but it be cool to have money like Wayne
Take the shorter roads so the family ain't worrying
Chose to build it slow, ain't no need, no hurrying
It's hard to be political, can't say what's on your brain
Careers come quick, it's just as fast to bury 'em
But I chose to give a damn
And box for you like pictures on Instagram
Chose to respect what was built by both Kool and Bam
You know who I am, word to my homie Wyann
Shit, ain't hard to choose me there's only one me, man
(So hard to choose)
That's why I chose to be that
Because where I'm from it ain't cool to be wack
And I'm so pro-black
Though they don't choose me back and that's some choosy shit
Why it's so hard to choose y'all over these jewels and whips
Welcome to my side
When you look in the crowd the minority's never white
I appreciate y'all, but I'm lying if it don't bite
Cause I love all races but we gotta raise 'em
Cause I know the scale tipped ain't in no black girl's favor
Hey y'all, we all outcasts, these black girls favor
The blonde Barbie and scars, we all gotta save 'em
No love lost for whites, Latinos and the Asians
Loyal to all, but when I look at these black girls faces
I understand why I chose to be better, not basic
So it's not, not (hard to choose)
Yeah, so excuse if I don't care if hipsters relate
It weren't for you at all, at all why these songs were made
Like you were overlaid at the airport
And missed your sort of take off
Don't understand why we get naked or
Why it's hard to choose being real or being fake, huh?
Cause the world worship people that get their cake up
But I chose to De La Soul and raise the stake up
Now why is it (so hard to choose)?
Yeah, seldom support our own, I helped myself by advancement
Want to make sure our daughters have better chances
But y'all in that show and watching videos
Why it's hard to choose class or let them titties show
But it's better for my heart, honey, like Cheerios
And secondly more comfortable doing [?]
Trying to build you up like I went to Lowe's and bought a lot
MC Lyte, I ain't forgot what you told me
I ain't Hovy, but damn
It's hard to choose being humble or going HAM
Humility's a weakness, I was told different
Quietest in the room is the baddest one like Durant
It's hard to choose Carolina over Atlanta
Chicago, LA, especially in Johannesburg
Yeah, cause it's been love since beginnin'
Home away from home, versus homes we get no spins in
Why it's (so hard to choose)?
Being super lyrical or slowing it down
Will they understand the metaphors and how they compound
With the two lines before and the next three after?
And ask myself does this shit, if it even still matter?
The joints y'all tripping on are so easy and average
And the ones I respect all got that gift mastered
I don't want to compromise my sick self for a master
But it's (so, so hard to choose)
Cause if I don't I'm not cool and I'm boring
Should add a tsch tsch to my beats to be current
This the shit I think about along with image and earnings
But when Nas tell me "God you killin' it" then I'm burning
All thoughts chasing y'all, man, it's easy now
XXL ain't tripping, Time calmed me down
Thinking where we all started from and where we all sitting now
Shit I see it different now, why it's not, not (hard to choose)
