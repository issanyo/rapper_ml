[Hook]
You left me wildin', fallin' for you
I don't know what to do, wildin', fallin' for you

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Ain't a secret I ain't told you that you don't know about me
Things my family don't know about me
Listen to me verbatim, bring it up in arguments so you win
Hell, at least you listenin' like Drake, oh, what a influence
I'm so into you, you grown as hell
But we joke and we play like we twelve
That's a friendship, kinship, black Barbie-Ken shit
Love you cause you make me laugh
Spendin' trips never bought me, taught me
Money don't make me cool or nothin'
They cool with stuntin', I'm cool with you
I'm cool that we cool without playin' by none of they rules
Why I fell for you, was told to marry a doctor, lawyer
I want my best friend I felt like nutso jumpin' outside the gym

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
So many marry the wrong person, know it ain't comical
I take my time like Dre and Jay Electronica
For you, man, I'm just human, niggas wanna be Victor Newman
Just want you to be my new man, love someone I deem honourable
Best friend, lololol laughin'
Every time we ridin' you be like "girl, you better strap in"
Sure you don't wanna lose me? Uh uh, 'specically in no accident
Feelin' possessive nowadays like Cleveland and Akron
You my 23 bae, best shot I got
How I tell my best friend I love him without it being awkward, huh?
They say best friends the best kind, others like "don't do it"
If it goes south your friendship gon' be ruined
