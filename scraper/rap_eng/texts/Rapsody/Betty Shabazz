[Hook]
But I ain’t really talkin bout much, I’m just bustin'
But I ain’t really talkin bout much, I’m just bustin'
But I ain’t really talkin bout much, I’m just bustin'
But I ain’t really talkin bout much, I’m just bustin'
But I ain’t really…

[Verse]
Mind of Malcolm X, I Belafonte like Andre rep dirty morning raps
I’m more for brothers that try to step to me
Heard it all so whatever they talk is less to me
Bless Umi, I shine my light on the world tonight
I’ve been beastin this evening, I got my tiger stripes
William SC, I’m livin a tiger’s life
Tryna get a piece of the pie, the cap messin eye in eye
Yea, might be a renegade, you been afraid
Show em Eminem, give no reason to speculate
Yea, they Wiggins, I'm More Parker
I’m more parts of Biggie, Andre, and Carter
Caught yo mind in my raps, the night clearer than holy water
I’m in fact and perceptions, I told'em I'm Margaret's daughter
She don’t give a damn
Bout who you are, just bout who I am
New sundown after sun god, born to advance
The acid rappin, now you rappers ain’t got a chance
MMMM Only Chance gave me a chance
Made something on my Lonely Thoughts when others thought that I can’t
I’m Gooden, I’m John Wooden a champion
I’m the M and OP, it’s about to ante up
That’s the anthem, that’s Auntie Em I'm far from Kansas
Wiggins I’m Mo Parker, they ain’t got the answers
I’m the truth boy, no swaying at that opinion
Emotional roller coaster, they Kanye at King Dominion
I’m the engine
Yea, rap got pride
Rap with a gift, rain danced on all odds
Better mend yo wives, they’ll never fuck with the squad
It’s Jamla if you forgot
That I’m the greatest before I rot
Could bear it if you went to Endor and took an Ewok
I’m the beast in the shadows, they whispering on the watch
(pa! pa!) that’s me taking aim at all of they spots
Dear pop, you sick of small pox, I know I love it
But I ain’t really talking bout much, I’m just busting
I ain’t really talking bout love, needing a husband
I’m too young, having fun
Ain’t tryna to stress about nothing
Give me a second
I’ll burn you, I’ll burn you for the record
They couldn't find a single drug in me like Eckerd
Just naturally a beast, show them suckas my record
We turn and had a burn with appetite like a pepper
Told em to Thank Her Now but most waited too long to rep it
Now they septic shock, realizing I’ve been separate
Second I ain’t my aim for everything they rejected
I made another weapon and niggas all wet pawns
Magna insides, resembling oceans
Cry me a river, canoed it without a paddle
Hold it out, carry me, I guess I got similar powers yea Ahh

Mind of Malcolm X, I Belafonte for Nelson rep dirty morning raps
Push up when you fall, don’t be scared of death
Get down like tyrannosaurus rex and expire the next
It’s nada when you been to Nagasaki
At a rap party in Pate on all pop of the posses yeah!
I’m Tarzan, two strands away from animal
Buck like antelope, all these rappers is Amber Rose
I ain’t heard nothing hot since Control dropped
They taking longer than Detox
They don’t wanna Vol-tron and so on
Pour on, feel my forearm, wear it like Luanne Rohan
Heart on sleeve, chief smile because we move on
Mistubishi Galant, dupont
Been a mutant since mama slipping coupons for croisannts and croutons
Do some damage, get at em like I’m a neutron, bouton
Pass on em, recycle em like a Mormon
I rained, it ain’t storming
I’m ignoring all that female rapping shit’s ignorant
Competing with every emcee, come step if you wanna see us rap

[Hook]
