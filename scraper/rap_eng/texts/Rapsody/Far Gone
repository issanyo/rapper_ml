[Verse 1: Musiq]
Always thought I'd never ever see the end of you and me, girl
Always never seemed to last forever in this imperfect world
No, even through all the acceptance of all the imperfections between you and I
Still [?] to get us right, no

[Pre-Chorus: Musiq]
Hey, see neither one of us know what to do, here we are now, no
Always scared, wanna change but we just don't know how, no
Cause things got too bad and we said too much
I think this might be the end for us
Unless you can tell me if it's possible

[Chorus: Musiq]
Can we get back
What we've lost
Are we too far gone
To turn it around now
Can we get back
What we've lost
Are we too far gone
To turn it around now

[Verse 2: Musiq]
I really thought it would be you and me
Until the end of both of our lives, hey
Especially how we used to kick it all through the day
And how we used to do it all night
Now, things have changed so much that it's almost
As if we're not even together anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Musiq]
Always at each other like we got the answers but (neither one of us know what to do, here we are now)
Don't wanna apologize or let it go (always scared, wanna change but we just don't know how)
Don't know who's right or wrong
Cause things got too bad and we said too much
I think this might be the end for us
Unless you can tell me if it's possible

[Chorus]
Can we get back
What we've lost
Are we too far gone
To turn it around
Can we get back
What we've lost
Are we too far gone
Tell me how did we get so far, girl

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Tell me again, what we fighting for
Some days, we just angry, I don't know no more
Going through the motions, ain't fixing nothing
I could only take your company in smaller doses
Looking back on badder days, Sunday to Saturdays
I was all weak for love, now we always agitated
I ain't the same person, you ain't the same person
We used to love each other, we both had the same purpose
I recite Curtis to help me explain that
That was the making of you, and one thing I noticed
Is the other side, your side of the bed seems colder
Time seems to slip by now a lot more slower, you know
They say it flies when you're having fun
And I love you too much to say that we over
But I ask myself a lot, why we holding on
We trying but it don't seem to be working out for nothing

[Bridge: Musiq]
But we try, but we try
But we try again now
It's all right, it's all right
But it seems like you and me can never
Can never love never dies, no
All we gotta do is (put some new life into it)
If you're really trying to do this
If it's real love and it's worth it
Just gotta prove it now
Just got me and you
Ain't really nothing to it
So let it go, but if not
[?]
See about us
[?] tell me baby

[Chorus: Musiq]
Can we get back
What we've lost
Are we too far gone
To turn it around
Can we get back
What we've lost
Are we too far gone
Oh I just wanna know
Can we get back
What we've lost
Are we too far gone
I just wanna know
Can we get back
What we've lost
Are we too far gone

[Outro: Rapsody]
Any ho call up, I just hang up
I confront you about it, but you don't know it much
Uh, I could be somewhere else, hanging with my girls
Chilling with my girls but I'm trying
I'm really really trying
And I feel every day like my love let me die
I keep eyeing you, but I don't feel emotion
I don't say love, I don't think we gonna
Make it make it make it make it no more, eh?
Make it make it make it make it no more, eh?
Make it make it make it make it no more, eh?
Make it make it make it make it no more, eh?
Tears in the bucket, I'm tired of fighting you
And I feel like, I'm tired of fighting you
Nigga feel like chucking hard out the window, uh?
