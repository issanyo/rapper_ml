Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need a new pair
Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need a new pair
Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need a new pair
Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need a new pair
Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need a new pair
Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need a new pair
Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need a new pair
Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need a new pair

[Verse 1: Von Pea]
The Swoosh is in the back
Velcro top
Motherf*** a scene, I'm way too clean
Ooh weee, you see the damn
Damn, there goes a crease
What week is this?
Ooh I get paid
So maybe I can go put these away
Imma go see the doctor, Dr. Jay
Just general release, no hyperbeast
Keep steppin' to the beat
Just watch my feets
Your sneakers
Don't match theyself, That's a L
Turn quicker than a dog tryna catch his tail
Like, "oh my god, those s***s is hard"
Yeah, I got on sneaks, but I need the new
Funny how the new came out in 9-2
My older brother
I just saw an old picture of him in those kicks
You know I'm tryna get from ebay
They sorta look like Jordans
He say they called Flights
The day they arrived, I stared at 'em all night
I wore 'em to school
This grown woman said "Nice, wow, the old Flights"

[Verse 2: Josie Stingray]
Now when it comes to shoes
Money is nothin'
I need a pair to one-up Darren Hudson
My sister say I need to grow up and change clothes
Shoes all stacked up lookin' like Legos
My closet on read space
I got all the staples
I just got a new pair and they look fade-o (hey)
Man, I feel great
I didn't get a chance to get these in '98
No, I'm just an emcee who likes sneaks so don't hate
So, this ain't a trend
I'm so Winnebago
I'm in it for the long
This mood is all wrong
And ever since the internet, everybody on
Everybody got 'em
But not these, scuff 'em up, we gone have a problem
Cuz I paid two-fifty, fool, we gone have a problem
I'm givin' y'all notice
I'm bout to skip Autumn cuz my shoes is the coldest
When school's back in session
Y'all fools bout to notice
Forgo it
Believe me, I keep my spot seaweed
I'm the one that stole ya thunder, clepto
You still in them SBs?
I dime up
People say "What these [?] is killin' y'all shit"

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
9-5 kickies, 9-5 kickies
Grey, lime green like the rhymes stay sickie
Dressed to impress from my hickie
Yeah, in [?] to a tune like Mickey
Skip 4th period
Cop new Dickies
Match new Jordans
Only night courtin'
Ha ha
And with my boyfriend
Waterproof butter Timbs what I recommend
Better act like you know, like a thespian
In the ladies section like a lesbian
Tryna find a seven
In the pink ones
Ready to meet the world like I'm Fashawn
Cuz I know one thing that is fo' sho
Taste of my kicks will have em snappin' photos
Ha, like "where you get them from?"
Never seen nothin' like them round here, huh
Huh huh
And wait till the school day
Peepin' eyes from the boys in a cool way
Cuz I'm doin' it well, like Cool J
High tops, like the fade on Kid 'N Play
