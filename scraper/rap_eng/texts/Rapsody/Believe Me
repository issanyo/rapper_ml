[Verse 1]
Like, Like
Mountains and peaks, valleys I been through
The landlord telling me come through, rent due
Since you seem to have it all figured out
Next month while you coppin’ one, cop’ me a Benz too
They all think just because rhymes being laid
That niggas getting paid, when I struggle like you do
Put out more product and it's better than labels move
Meet the frustration that I never gave into, Nigga
Lauryn ain't crazy, just dont know what she been though
Complaining bout radio, my nigga, got no room
Cause niggas wit opinions dont support you on itunes
Listen, my soul mission was to rap and get paid too
Be someone that these little girls look up to
Now I see the game for what it is, a big chess move
Playing my cards all how they was dealt
I won't blessed with the money so my movement ain't felt
Nigga, smoke and mirrors, look in the mirror
Telling myself, "self ain't you glad your shit is imperial?”
I rule everything around me the C.R.E.A.M
Get your dollar, dollar bills yall this game is all a scheme
For control and being sold is a backwards kinda thing
They saying I'm the future so I’ll never waste my ring
And not answer my calling to be your daughter dream
My train of thought rapid, Im just blowing esteem
Putting fear in these rappers all proclaiming they king
If Maximus had a wife, then to Rome I’d be queen

[Hook]
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, too many of you frontin for TV
Only real live niggas get respect easy
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies

[Verse 2]
Miami beach, ain't seen no water yet
Heavy on mind like Avirex, I X’d
Out distractions, to be the rap rim
Goal that they tryna reach if you needing some evidence
You can ask 9th, address like residence
I'm nothing like these niggas we separate, I'm Evelyn
I spazz out like ex-wives to ballers
You wanna feel something? Then you know who to recommend
Jamla the squad in present tense, the team
Like Dream of '92 that they prayed to the reverend
To rebirth a nation, water distilled
So, when she break water spill, catch the flow like Jacqueline
Onassis, the curse and the gift
Canibus, take notes to you niggas that’s battling, nigga
Whats beef? Cattle and javelin
That shit ain't real nowadays, niggas just actin’ it
Zulu the real, the nation I rep
Keep medallions round my neck like the belt post accident
Kanye West, walk with Jesus my way
How you really all should pray if you knew what was happening
Yo, forget the name, they never can do
Twenty years still touched cuz the flow so passionate
Like prayers up to Jehovah when traveling
Protect me from rap foes and all the fake rap men
Believe me they souls is paper thin, for paper when
Heart ain't gold, I dont find you rich like Solomon
Rap three times nice like the number of wise men
Frontin’ niggas juke 'em every day like Heisman

[Hook]
