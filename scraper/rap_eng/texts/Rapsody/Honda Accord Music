[Verse 1]
Pardon my jargon, I'm [?] fresh, Martha Stewart
Living, Robin Givens, ahead of class
A Victorian, delorians
Guess I'm exposed
And they're adoring it
Heat like Miami, blazing like Portland
Can't check rap diddy like a pair of Air Jordans
I'm Gordon from the Bulls, fade away perfect
Curtains for certain, I'm important
Cold like Melo, hello, I'm rap or
Little Rudy of Kooley, shouts to Hooly

[Chorus]
Oh, I suppose I'm sharper than Zoros
Sword, Can't afford Maybachs I'm in Accords
Can't afford Maybach's, I'm in Accords
Can't afford Maybach's, I'm in Accords
?, I'm in Accords
?, I'm in Accords
?, I'm in Accords
Can't afford Maybach's, I'm in Accords

[Verse 2]
When flow slip, I'm equipped to dip out in the B.M
Mean like Weez, still like ?
? I been flowing ?
? under tongue like a pirate
From Sugar Hills like I'm Cyprus
Insane Wayne Gretzky, I should win an ESPY too
Sport game like I got flu
Sick moves, sick shoes, roll with sick crews
The modern day thriller
Like Ali and Mike Vanilla, rap Matilda
The prodigy shouts to Dilla
Looking cooler than Frank Lucas in a gray chinchilla
I'm gorilla in the legion of doom like I'm ?
I bet you by golly I reign supreme, it's rap

[Chorus]
Oh, I suppose I'm sharper than Zoros
Sword, Can't afford Maybachs I'm in Accords
Can't afford Maybach's, I'm in Accords
Can't afford Maybach's, I'm in Accords
?, I'm in Accords
?, I'm in Accords
?, I'm in Accords
Can't afford Maybach's, I'm in Accords
