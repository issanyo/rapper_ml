R-A-P-S-O-D-Y
Cause she's better than y'all, better than all
Serving no waiter, her time is now, fuck waiting on it
It's your time, baby, own it
R-A-P-S-O-D-Y

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Uh, I ain't Amish, but, yo, I promise
When I'm in the field you can bet I'm gon' keep it honest
Suspend you in time like self portraits, I guess I'm Mona
A perfect picture of what you get when you really on it, focused
Wrote it knowing you wouldn't probably get what I quoted
Off gate, it's just bait, when you get it late, bam, it's over
Bam, it's over, we taking back what we showed them
I know the routine, I'm a giant on giant shoulders
I see farther than that little midget that Jay Hova had quoted
And yeah I wrote it, more scary now that you know it
Uh, yeah, I'm pitching dope off, no squares
No blocks, been hot so who cares?
What the hell you driving? We still thriving

Breaking water that's labor for all the daughters
I've been working so when they older everything's back in order

You thought you was the shit, now you just may have to retire
Call me sire or

You get played lowkey, I'm more thorough than all your records
You make moves to make money
I make money from all my methods
Man whew, and my crew make all the best shit
That's Eric G on it, whew
I rose like your face to make up for shit that you do
Bust Smith & Wessons, I'm a weapon to those wept on you
That's that whip appeal, you gon' know my name for real
Baby, I'm
