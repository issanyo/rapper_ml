[Intro: Rapsody]
Rap Diddy and Raekwon The Chef
Salute to the Wu

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Black diamonds sence from Muhammad, I drop
Rhyming, reminding most of what they forgot
Raya lights, so at night yelling rap don't stop
Keep on going, we gon' continue elevating our plots
Dre 3000, haters, gon' single them
Scottie Pippen, tripping, one of the best, am I not?
If you forgot, since the top, I've been listening to them hot
Rae, Jay, Toomp from Atlanta, and Dre
Wu, saluting diamonds, New York to LA
Okay, player, now you see the root of me sway
From that, I never will, culture over bills, pills
Party life, I told y'all I'm really nice like Rae
[?] I shook 'em up, jello
Spitting diamonds and pearls, I am rap, hello
For those who couldn't catch yo, the name from intro
The info remains the same, I am hot and nitro
Glistering, glistening like black diamonds
Raya light bright, huh, this is semi blinding
Binding, my name here with some of the greats
These are treasures of our time, diamonds never outdate
Black diamonds

[Hook: 9th Wonder]
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"

[Raekwon]
Black diamonds and pearls
What up, 9th?
Rapsody, what's good?
Raekwon, you already know
Yeah, I got you

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Under the trenches, black men [?], that's red
Getting headshots, duffle bags under my legs
We breadwinners, the coalition slicker than Benzes
On my off day, paper day, play with my chemist
Bum rushing, bread, guns dumping, run from the feds
Rocking Nike boots, pencils in our hand, Nas said
We on the come up, an old school don on the run up
Take stacks of bread home and black in the summer
Real niggas know my get down, I run with my team
That pull out, let 80 out, and jump in the Beams
What it do bruh? That's my sister, give us some love
Or stay away, you might die tryna bob with these plug
I don't regret shit, veteran who vote for the real
Run around the world twice shooting dice with the buil
Them Shaolin alling, most of them wilding
(Word up) Word to mother, disrespect my medallion

[Hook]
