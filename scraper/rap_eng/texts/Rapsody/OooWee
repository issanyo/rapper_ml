[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I bet you feel so high, got your head in the clouds but you still come around like
Ooowee
I see what you started, I know what you promised, you're owning, you're popping like
Ooowee
Soon as you put your feet to the ground I'll lace you with a pack of that loud, some of that

Ooowee

Ooowee
Yeh, it's your world, I see you shining nigga, go and get it
Ooowee
Make sure you see me nigga when you touch down, I'm still here

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Fresh out the bed in my slippers, all my niggas is niggas
Brush my teeth while I figure how to get up on these riches
'Cos the Acura's rented and I need something more tinted
Hop in the whip and we been it, I call that whip Betty White
Whole white thing, like money they counting, I see it
Broke as fuck but we dreaming, out the window I'm leaning
Get out the lane, and when I get it ain't gon' change my nigga
I'ma still be the same regular ass nigga talking that

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I bet you feel so high, got your head in the clouds but you still come around like
Ooowee
I see what you started, I know what you promised, you're owning, you're popping like
Ooowee
Soon as you put your feet to the ground I'll lace you with a pack of that loud, some of that
Ooowee
Was the same back then as you are now, let's hope you stick around, come on

[Verse 2: Rapsody and (Anderson .Paak)]
I'm a window for homies, I know all of 'em watch
Time and time again reminiscing, remembering blocks
I used to walk around on 'em it's been a while now we back
Gotta speak on the youth to throw all my dreams in the air
My mind a hula hoop going round but got nothing to spare
Nothing to waste, head in the clouds, like I was high on that grape
I'ma pull up in something ignant, I promise just watch
Enough to make momma worry about them profiling cops
But I can't change I was raised by the old ones (oooh)
And when they see me they be like "what you know huh?
Don't forget all your family and where you came from
Money change, the spirit shouldn't change none"
Yeh I know I'm dope, all my homies they do
Malcolm Adekanbi, I'm humble as Gandhi though
Straight out my momma, came out with a Straight Outta Compton flow
I'ma an animal on it with Anderson, I love ya bo
We on that
(oooeee)
Go and shoot your shots, show 'em you can box, we won't ever stop that's that Puffy in me
(oooeee)
Well up to the block, headed to the top, got them things slapping in the car like
(oooeee)
Who that coming round the way? Come around the way, damn you fine as hell, come around this way
(oooeee)
Roll the windows down, yeh I like 'em brown, with your lighter brown, where we going now?
(oooeee)
Up the way, where the boys at? Don't wear your good clothes cos the homies that smoke that
(oooeee)
And the homies all know that, my head is in the clouds but my feet ain't left ground yet like
(oooeee)
Yeh I'm good with all the fam, if they better kiss me tell 'em put the money in my hand already
(oooeee)
Banging on the can, break it down, break it down, everybody
What they saying now?
(oooeee)
I'm playing outta your Bron Brons to have you running up the blunts, taking they pom poms
Cheering for me and my team while we eating on Wonton
Squeaking like Miyagi, I shout like the sun
So, who your sponsor? I told 'em I'm a  monster like Luke Cage
Take a shot and watch me walk away with just juice stains
Used to tell me "you just wasting your time with them"
Still I come around just to show 'em this confidence like

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I bet you feel so high, got your head in the clouds but you still come around like
Ooowee
I see what you started, I know what you promised, you're owning, you're popping like
Ooowee
Soon as you put your feet to the ground I'll lace you with a pack of that loud, some of that
Ooowee
Was the same back then as you are now, let's hope you stick around, come on

[Outro]
Ooowee
