[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
A breath away from callin'
Will I regret it in the mornin'?
I'm dangerously lonely, yeah, uh, yeah
Ain't seen you in a minute
Ain't nothin' changed, know you still feel it
But I'm bad at keeping secrets, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R.]
And I'll need a drink to be bold
It's hard to commit when I'm sober
So dangerous when I'm alone
So stay with me 'till we're hungover

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Oh, once I start sippin' I need more
And it feels so good I might just let it go, go
Let it go, go
I let it go, go
And it feels so good I might just let it go

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
To loose off Ace and this rum to ever bite on my tongue
I'm bold, I'm typin' in bold when I text you baby uh-huh
This liquor got me on one, no filter, say what I want
The most truthful when I'm drunk
Off love, feel like half a month
Too weak to lie about how I feel about you (feel about you)
Too go on to lie about how I feel about you (feel about you)
Two lies I tell if, well, I lied than try to say how I ain't wanna lie around you
That's the truth
It's in her spirit, I had to let this loose
Go!

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Oh, (ooh)
Once I start sippin' I need more (more)
And it feels so good, I might just let it go, go
Let it go, go
I let it go, go
And it feels so good I might just let it go

[Verse 3: Jorja Smith]
I think I said enough all my liquor’s gone
I must’ve drank enough now I’m feeling numb
Afraid of what I might’ve said in my defense
I was a bit over the edge
I know I owe it to you
Just be the same without drinking but
It all pours out and I’m on my own
Dangerous alone, could you just take me home?

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Oh, (ooh)
Once I start sippin' I need more (more)
And it feels so good, I might just let it go, go
Let it go, go
I let it go, go
And it feels so good I might just let it go
