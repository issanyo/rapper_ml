[Verse 1: Add-2]
Add-2 and I come straight from the ‘Go
And this verse is like a welcome mat, I put you on the floor
I could fill the world up twice with all the things that you don’t know
Yo, do you give them receipts for every time you sell your soul?
Please don’t get offended by the questions that I ask
See through my competition so I shatter them like glass
Have a seat inside my chambers I hope you don’t mind the gas
Death is just a test it’s only right I let them pass away
Cookin’ food for thought, the similes I make
I be cookin’ food for thought like Tariq when he need a plate
And this food is from the soul, this is some high stakes
And the stakes is high like De La, Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo
Yo, watch her drop it like a maiden name
Don’t put me on the track your legs ain’t fit to run that race
And I’m feelin’ like a mover, I will put you in your place
One time for Sonny Cheeba, two times for Geechi Suede

[Verse 2: Add-2]
You see I’m doper than the stuff that’s in your pockets, pipe or pedalin'
R-r-r-r-rock it, all you rappers out your element
Earth, wind and fire: Kwame, Linka, Wheeler
Earth, Wind and Fire: Maurice, Verdine, Philip
Homie you can call the cops, hot just like a boilin’ pot
Watch the people transform when we roll out like the Autobots
Wouldn’t wanna be y’all, yea we gotta leave y'all
Fans stay down like a fat man on a see-saw
All these rappers sick, then I guess I’d be the antidote
You don’t have the ammo homie, what the hell you plannin’ for?
I do just what I want plus everything you can’t
Girl your face aight but tell that ass I’m a fan
Spit that heat when I’m on that beat
Watch your step, better watch your feet
Get up out my seat, get up out my reach
Get up out my league cause I’m ‘bout to teach
When I wild out cause you find out I’m a beast
Throw a towel out, better bow down cause you see
Cause it’s mine now, put a sign out, when you foul out
Call time out t-t-t-t-

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Queen Rap, should be flyin’ off the racks
They ain’t give interest before so I just go up on the tax
Small percentage of niggas who can rap the way I rap
Numbers don’t lie and that’s the number one fact there
Riley Curry the game, I’m not amused by your questionnaries
My blessings way up there aimin’ for a two-peat
Ask me for a feature every beat’ll get a two-piece
Like ridin’ shotgun, um hmm, that’s a two piece
Double entendre, queen of these streets
Every rewind you’ll find a new piece, brand, brand new piece, uh
Queen Rap, if they askin’ what my name is
It ain’t Em but start with M, I got ‘em danglin’ by they anklets
Marlanna what the fam call me cause Rapsody bow famous
But you could call me sister cause we ain’t gotta be strangers
The world might be messed up but I ain’t gon’ let it change me
Add-2 from Jamla, Add-2 that’s two you just can’t hang with
Play

[Outro]
Playin’ that’s my car, chose a pimp’s Cadillac
Imagination changin’ the reality we at
You can try to drive far til your car get a flat
But everybody knows that you’ll be right back
