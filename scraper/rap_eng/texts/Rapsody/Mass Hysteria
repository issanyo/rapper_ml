[Verse 1]
Deduct riches who better with pitches?
The flow screw em up, fuck, wetter than dishes
Mama say "if you marry, make sure he got figures"
Daddy say "be respectful, don't ever say nigga"
My nigga
Well, there I go again breaking my promise
What is upon us? Lie on my sheets and I ponder
Reciting my mantra, I should put mics in a condom
I'm coming for honor, strength of a green anaconda
On your conscious, brain storming best get you some ponchos
9th Wonder accomplice back, look what we accomplished
Wit little to nothing, more than they thought we would conquer
We winning and did it all wit no bit of dishonor
Purple hearts, for all the wounded I wounded, Obama
Healthcare for they welfare call it lyrical trauma
ICU, its critical they sicker than vomit
Pitiful if they ever think that we'd break it like Omish
Traditions, told niggas like Minstrel shows
I'd blacken the face that ever took shots at my race
Like mase in a mason jar it'd be hell if I break
Tears, for all they fears they hearts would all ache
Like the many females that drank Chapel wit ol' Drake
And don't see a next date, guess my flow similar fate
To these rappers I look over em like at awakes
Peek in look at em still sleeping, word to big Jay
Hey

[Bridge/Outro]
I weigh my options like back at the mosh pit
Pushing me with the quickness, I'll send em to hospice everyday

[Hook]
It's Rapsody in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Coming through your area, causing mass hysteria
Flow been a weapon like Erykah mama gun
I'm bout to bury ya and pose out the window of the chariot
Live from the capital under like mail carriers
The Letters I read um the I's and the T's
Lines I spotted then crossed ain't no fear in my genes
No boxing Kareem, win everything I throw up, cha-ching
Bank that blank check, see through goals get you rings
From publications, label Caucasians and agents
The business side fuck it, the other half is amazing
We all tryna make it Phylicia raising a raisin
In the sun like brother Big Pun I'm not a player
Unless we lay-up in the Caymans drinking something pinkish
Shots of Ciroc cuz of how we rock, wanna thank us
Thinkers sharp as shank they sink inside of the bankers
Embezzle style they can't profile me like I'm Blanket
Michael Jr. - can't be seen or neither touched
Money over loyalty always will leave you fucked
Her name Karma and she got drama be actin up
Call it broadway when recording how I conduct hysteria

[Hook] + [Outro]
