[Verse 1: Tab-One]
Well I don’t know what’s on my mind these days
But see I find it kinda hard to write a rhyme these days
I guess I’m still feeling like the time I waste
Is bound to catch up with me, gotta find my pace
I gotta stay running like prefontaine
And let them competitors knows that we got game
It ain’t a secret that we keep this flame
And we ain’t known to hide, you ain’t gotta seek this mane
This in the wide open like a Dixie Chick
So when we bust, feel the rush like a pixie stick
Stay in focus like a crispy pic
And never falling hopeless in this risky bus’
I’m Tom Cruising, dipping in my socks
Crossing the living room while I’m living for the rock
Y’all ain’t feeling what we drop? Must be numb
Telling them they better watch but they thinking we dumb
They like

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever mane
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever mane
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever mane
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever mane

[Verse 2: Charlie Smarts]
As soon as I walk in the stairwell
My damn neighbour starting to stare, well
You don’t care to listen, I don’t care to sell
So I’ll see you around like carousels at the fair, well
To the haters, cheaters and liars
I’m living in the zoo with cheetahs and lions
Bout to get spins like CDs and tires
See this attire? She is the buyer
So, give it a rest, you can read my rights
It’s hot, they downloaded it, mediafire
I lead and they follow, uh, burn a copy
It’s easy to swallow like Murda Mamis
She be killing these kids like my style do
And you be feeling these hits until it’s round two
Yea, they just dissing me
Will my diss be on this play
They disbelieved, it’s like

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever mane
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever mane
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever mane
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever mane

[Verse 3: Median]
Hooray, where the hooks at? Hey, whatchu looking at?
Watch them ok it when the player go to put back
Up, up, up and away the fade looking back
Got ‘em all day and amazed like “Hey, look at that”
I too a hero and the flame from the wolf pack
Fame when it’s looked at, today from a look back
Carolina spawn them, spar til they chopping them
Our outcome inspired, like I am David Thompson
Send a bar, get up, post it up
When we really get to jumping do you know what it does?
Feel in love, reinvented, til they holding in cuffs
Alley-oop, throwing it up, showing them love
Get emotion with it, if you feel emotional approach them then
Get a close friend
Open and I stroke cause I’m supposed to hit it
Poster children for what the culture is
Yea

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
