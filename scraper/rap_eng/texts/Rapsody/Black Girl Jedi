[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Need a big black four door body to push
Night time running through the streets, Reggie Bush
Car dashing through lights the color of kush
Run into my baby he could feel on my tush
Jedi flow better than the veterans know
Or average perceived like weed they never grow
Weak for weak tides need [?] coco
Compose rhymes with the signs of a J-hov
Step through it a new jet yeah I step in slow
West Snipes called, take over, double my flow
A diamond girl, Leslie, I shine brighter
Every magazine from XXL, Source, your writer
Lighter fluid, sparks, something similar to read
Robbin' every bit of attention that's been given to me
Thank 'em now if you please, Mayweather touch me never
Forever rap shit, y'all should treasure and see, Miss R.A.P
Flow a [?] no half rapper, fuck these niggas that acting
Ain't hanging with me, another plane I'm on
Con-Air, the baddest in the bunch where I belong, Jedi

[Hook: Heather Victoria]
Black girl Jedi
Feel the force no pressure, that said I
Keep it hot, we b-girls forever
Hip hop on top won't stop forever

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
J-Skywalker and I'm back in the flesh
Just when you thought it was safe to address
Your dream I came and demolished the scene
No room to intervene I got it padlocked with Jean
[?] trust, niggas ain't touching the smart
Apart from all life sees the most involved
In the red zone, one play away from my calls
Nicole, Richie from the records I sold shit
I'm far from that, maybe only 50 and hold
And ho they can't stomach me John and O
Well they ain't well, in feelings like braille
12 play ok I make them rotate, compel
No joke, Chapelle shit, they better know who I am
Black girl Jedi back with the force and the jam

[Hook]
