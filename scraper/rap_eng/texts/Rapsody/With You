[Sample]
I want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I want to be with you
I just want to be with you

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
You want me to go whenever?
Yo, passed my training day, lyrical [? frost]
Denzel intel, a chip off the old block
This ain’t no act, so I don't know how to mask dope
Safehouse, motherfucka, that’s been your last hope
Known to piss niggas off, like Nicki pissed off pope
And I ain't no asshole, though I drop hit shit
I'm nice, I might come to bash hoes, galaxy [foam posit]
I don’t need those to step on stars my flow got it
A is for [aniseal], looking like Kevin D
Rolling like Thunder, I lighten up on you when I sleep
Yo I stay going hard like young boy near the puberty
If you rap, homey, see I'm intelligence minus [?]
Best be afraid of me, stop picking Laker beef
This ain't no game, nigga it's war when I rhyme on beats
I am rap, Minn-e-a-po-lis Twin City spit
Falling like Timberwolves when Kevin Garnett split
John Garnett shit, ATO big fish
Salute Molly, the one's that support me my nigga, dig
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Media bullshit, nigga, shout to the West Coast
Midwest, Third Coast, forever we been close
Respect to my Zulus, Jay couldn't [lay to]
Rebirth of a nation so salute to my Zulus
Peace, understanding, stay aiming like cannons
Rap bucking like [granite], gin n niggas is salmon
Fish out of water, I stay flipping niggas like random
I am Zulu, flow been cuckoo, check you too, ask young Guru
Rap, I got no more to prove
Night got my back, like mamba, I think respect due
Huh, yo

Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop

You know I-I-I want to be with you…
