[Verse]
Yo you a mu’fucka, I’m a beast
Ferguson without police I’m takin’ over streets
In the name of, what the game was
In memory of Mike Brown put your mufuckin’ hands up
No defense when you spit like Mayweather
Got checks to vouch for it, prayed you knew better
Flow – check; charisma – check; got it all covered, yea
It ain’t a challenge when you already ice playa
That's over your head too though, dumb pseudo
Couldn’t come off a boss if you came out your Hugo
That’s nothin’ new though, disappear like Pluto
Young Rocky I could train through the snow so
No matter whether this or that, respect my class
This a new type of dope, they call it chrono
Open doors with it might be on my Tony Romo
Ain’t nobody catching that Ray Rice
Here’s your evidence I been hit and I been nice
But I’m still playin' the field the game messed up, right?
You so wrong you should never hit wives
Vice versa, before my niece turns five
Bet I ScHoolboy’s bout the studio
Uh, so Serena, so so Serena
Never shut me up always open to serve you easy
Word to J Peezy whoever you call first is ends up salty when they meet me
I’m wiggin’ again, I’m like Big in the pen, nicest one behind bars
Halloween come early, October 7, my Lord
Now who wanna talk scary pick out costumes
Yo I'm a wiz with these bars ain't talking Rostrums
Or Diana with yellow bricks, I'm so awesome
I’m only fallin’ if we talkin’ about autumn
Brought the blues back like Charlotte Hornets, told me you want it Ain’t got exploded, kill ‘em like Kob' I'm ballin’
Pivotal in my ritual let me keep goin’
Ain’t got a problem like 3 stacks and top 40
Ain’t talkin radio, talkin’ longevity, you know me
Beauty and the Beast, I gave y’all the rose I got it down to a T
Was told I sound underground, I don't think I agree
To think about it, I swear I was put here to lead if you askin’ where I be
Somewhere like Sesame countin’ 1, 2, 3
Microphone sounds great, I swear it’s all me
We talkin’ all then I see Rap, top of the totem
Nowhere near the Hoover, never sucked up to anybody that’s for losers
For me and my squad there’s some things we ain’t used to
Unlike this you used to killin’ it as usual
The King’s back in Akron and the Love came with him
They told me there’s no friendships in competition -- that’s a contradiction
You wanna be the best right? You gon’ hafta go for the head of someone you do like
And they ain’t gon’ like that
That's control you in
Unless you both secured and you're niggas to the end
I’m just sayin’ what it is
And killin’ at the same time we call this square biz
Jamla, that’s how we live
