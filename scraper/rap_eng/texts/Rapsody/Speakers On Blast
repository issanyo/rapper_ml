[Verse One: Skyzoo]
Never be a drought as long as I'm in the front
They lookin around but couldn't find it off the jump
I'm cookin in loud and got 'em poppin off for one
I'm hookin the town you hear 'em droppin in the dump
A lil' more on the edge, they was lookin for less
Used to the tap, they was lookin for steps
I don't juice none of that, they mistook it for meds
The root is under that just say I shook off the reds
When the bass get the beatin with the 808 beneath it
Ain't a lane they could be in that I ain't already deep in
Take it how you need it but basically what it be is
I could break this into pieces and make me a few believers
Let 'em know from the go, now they dealin what go up
As much as I can throw, everything for the lower
One after the other one, then I shake another one
Huh! Dish them the opposite and watch how the double come
Got 'em sittin in pocket I provide 'em that one of one
All of this is the obvious, I was just linin up
Huh! And now they wanna bring the 90's back
That's ok cause that's where they design me at

[Hook: Skyzoo] (Background Singers)
And so my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast

Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast (Here they come yo, here they come)
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast (Here they come yo, here they come)
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast (Here they come yo, here they come)

[Verse Two: Skyzoo] (Background Singers)
Live from in front of the store that never close
If ever I go it's on a temporary road
Huh! Double back and repost forever home
Twenty D batteries you should already know
When the tape get the runnin and the 808 jumpin
Ain't a box you could carry that could carry out a drummin
See the block 'gon carry they 'gon carry by the hundreds
Try and cop won't carry they could carry how you want it
(Here they come) Couple broads that understand what speakers do
Hennessy Black pride tryin to get a liter through
Huh! Mookie Jordans no scuffs, keep it true
And if a freezer around I'm tryin to Tina you (*They dont get it!!!)
Back to the bassline and what's around it
I'm trapped in my previous plays I'm 'bout countin
I actually keep it the same so if you doubt it
Then you just wasn't listenin of how I been about it
If the rooftop was here how would you try and porter it?
Essence of a previous cloth that they imported in
Huh! Cut different so you see what the importance is
Show you motherfuckers how to sport this

[Hook: Skyzoo] (Background Singers)

Been good handle that tape it's all knocks
So I put that on ten, put that on ten
