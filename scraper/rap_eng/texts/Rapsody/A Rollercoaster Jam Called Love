[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
My darling baby
I know it gets crazy sometimes
But this here relationship is ours to figure out
But, we gonna make it
If we can just find a way to
Get through the grey

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Some days I wake up and I feel like
I don't know what's wrong and don't care what's right
And I ain't sayin' that's it you
Just saying times I think of myself more than I do you
To give you proper love I gotta love myself some
You gotta find yourself something, get you a hobby or something
During grey spaces we existing in
When we ain't quite a couple but we more than friends
I think about coexisting and how to succeed at it
We gotta give each other space just to breathe a bit
I don't want things to become too routine with us
It's alright, everyday we ain't gon talk that much
Just knowing I got you is enough for me
And you respect me having individuality
That's what makes us whole
That's what keeps us happy
Even in love u gotta keep your soul
Catch me?

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
My darling baby
I know it gets crazy sometimes
But this here relationship is ours to figure out
But, we gonna make it
If we can just find a way to
Get through the grey

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Sometimes we just existing and it's alright
Days we ain't unhappy nor on cloud nine
Just keepin up wit traffic riding zoning out
I asked you what's wrong you tell me nothing babe I'm alright
I guess every journey come wit long yellow lights
Slow down is what it's telling me, I'm tellin me, look
You oughta really listen to the signs you get in life
Tryna follow my own advice
Too many of my friends approaching 30
Upset that they ain't nobody's wife
I know better than to rush hmm
That's suicide
We just starting out
We got a few hills  to climb
If you meet me halfway I swear I got the time
To figure it out, that's why I'm asking for a little some space
Cuz even couples need a couple of minutes for a mental break
So don't trip babe, I'm just tryna breathe, relax
Love ain't easy days gon come like that

[Bridge: Rapsody & Musiq Soulchild]
'Cause that's my rollercoaster
My rollercoaster love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Rollercoaster love
Love, love, love
'Cause that's my rollercoaster love

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
My insecurities don’t help at all
There's still love there
Hope he don't stay upset for long
Are we there yet?
On some Ice Cube and Nia Long
Seems we are
Packing his bags about to ribbit on
Ugh huh, whatever!
Bounce then nigga
Knowing I regret the decision
Im gon’ miss ya
Love is funny
It gets cold in the summer and winter
Ya heart just wanna cuddle up
Make up sex wit a nigga, ewwwww
I promise baby I'm still deep in love wit you
Yep, Yep I know the MO, this is how we do
Up and down rollercoaster, too emotional
Got me feeling sick inside
I only like it when we ride
In the bedroom like a coupe, yeah
Arguments we loop, ugh
Going in circles I wanna circle back wit him, ugh
Back when we were friends, yeah them happy days
I really miss my boo boo hoping he don't stay way
Cuz that's my

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild & 9th Wonder]
Cuz that’s my rollercoaster love
My rollercoaster love
And we go
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Rollercoaster love
Love, Love, Love Love
Love, Love Love love (repeat 2x)
