[Verse]
Yeah, now they say I'm illuminati [yeah]
True I'm ill, my words loom and I'm naughty [yeah]
When it comes to the flow I'm badder than Bobby swear
But only Devils I'm fanning for these days are Jabari's tier
That's a level I'm levels above I'm out of here
Another stratosphere of fear I shook 'em like Kyrie was here
That's Earvin's Magic. Not devil magic
Find you some deeper logic, these are the nights I'm gladdest[Gladys]
When you realize you superwoman above the average
I'm a poet baby Laurette I don't relate to ratchet
Most careers are rapid I'm just trying to be around
Wonder told me be profound, pros found I'm astounding
A red shirt in beginning I'm Winston I'm winning
Without beefing with any my music says all I need to now
You ain't my competition, I'm out for bigger fishes
This is chess but ain't no pawn I'm in the ocean swimming
Shark attack I bring the artist inspiration
Drew off everything and still screaming out Zulu Nation
If you in the basement keep your focus tight as faces
Evil looks they'll give you when finally win and make it
My grandfather was a mason a star was born to be amazing
Your girl blossom and now I'm out here shinning like Daisys
Still throwing my middle finger to all the racists
If there's a hell you'll burn and be as black as all of our faces, ha-ha
Who you pray to Jah or the Rabbah, got a pride of Mufasa, ain't lying bet you a dolla'
On a path like Mandela a long walk to my freedom
Where we'll be equal only know a couple people that really flow this evil
I'll eat you with each tooth find you a steeple
Tell momma to prepare your body for viewing of many people
Ask Geechie and Chi too, aka this is it for you boy
We'll have a funeral and all play T.R.O.Y Ha. Huh
But I'm burning oil in the soil
I'mma need a lawyer just to collect all the royals
Friends ain't loyal, industry is shady
My circle getting smaller trying to stay away from Hades
It's hell when you know you hotter then they new Mercedes
Walking the same path as all them niggas in they 80s
Discrimination's still alive I face it on the daily
Well fuck it I got to thrive for all the girls that's now babies
Eh bae about to see a good girl go crazy
I'mma snap like the 3rd verse featuring Jay Z
On some king shit like Kendrick cyphers and Shadys renegading
I'm Phontigga on whatever you say shit
Not shooting no casings burning inside like satan
Pushing me to the ledge more ammo to get erased with
Mase shit. Niggas gon' need GOD when I'm done here
Vent just to vent a challenge don't mean shit here
I wonder if then you'll call me female rapper
Stuttering shit I have to snap your neck in half then, I don't give a fuck
Like it light I'm more darkskin
The truth and the light so your day's looking darker
I'm a jedi young. Feel pain like an accident
From memories I hold up, high where the attic is
You just average and who cares for women
Rapping the taste for them sour as old lemons
I'll remember you when I'm pushing that cold Audi
Ignoring your phone calls when you dial me, yup
Hating to my face now you wanna be proud hmm?
I walk the same path as Martin and Malcolm
Catch them in the shadows now whispering about them
Now you bowing to the squad and want a piece of our outcome? Noway
Flow better than, star Letterman
My jacket sleeve reid I'm hotter than two tees with pens, in August
Opposite Scut Farcus
No Christmas story the gift is right before us
Move forward[Ford] like Taurus on ya'll niggas scream glory. Rose
Like Christopher in the forest. Wake up
Told ya'll with no cake up, like Jacob
We will make up the difference laker in time
Little light of mine we shine like goldmines
In shrines they pray to the divine with bent spines
Forgive me for my sins Father killing my only crime
My favourite rapper cover in time, it's that time
Guess it's sign like the sign letter E, we gone rock
Aye, P fuck a block, run through it like who gon' stop me [who gon' stop me]
ABC with no defense. A descent of an infant from Africa, be proud
Please smile for heritage we carrying [carrying]
Torches like tortoises from Maryland
Slow killing the niggas they so arrogant with estrogen
It's apparent that I can handle men
Like bars on cycle how I recycle them to come again
I'm killing these niggas with shit I started with
In '07 like interludes, I interrupt
Killing motherfuckers with lyrics they can't reconstruct
Like twin towers, no two, one few only I
Can shine like the belt of Orion shouts to Jamla
Stamina no guided, they can't run with thy squad
We take over and rule it just like the emperor
End of thy weak shit, niggas all should peep this
My third eye seeking higher like Allah
Taking it farther [father] like biological men [yup]
Jamla the squad let the saga begin [yo]
Rather continue Big Boi and 3 Stacks
One fact like frat step up or step back
Just be weary, if you do you too can fade to black
Like Jay back on the track from the way I now react
Black American Gangster Frank Lucas I killed that
