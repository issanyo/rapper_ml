[Intro: Styles P & Talib Kweli]
Open your eyes yea, tell me what ya see
Emcees on deck this the elite squad
You shall see start recognizing your privileges
Yea before they start weaponizing these lyricists

[Verse 1: Styles P]
All praises due to Allah
But we worship the dollar, so what we gonna do for Jihad?
I was hard in the booth of the yard the hallway
Then I got wise, gave a little juice to the gods
Your body's your temple, try to keep the lesson intact
Progression is forward, regression is back
But if you make it to the essence, that's a blessing in fact
Fuck a stripper, I got mother nature makin' it clap
I could rain dance a rain rhyme, pass me a track
I adapt to the boom-bap, mic and the strap
Gimme a dap, real rap, I'm ahead of the pack
This is Kweli and Ghost, and every rhyme kicking, in the morning
What I'm hittin is, probably a roach
I can talk to the walls, been walked on
Listen dog I'm different, always use a Godly approach
Ain't the new Black Star, but shit I'm the mos'...

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
...dope
Like Mac Miller, we black silla, these wack niggas
Gotta give us dap, but they be gettin' too close
I abhor violence but I'm a bar away from whippin' the toast
Your assumptions is a slippery slope
You scared to pick up the soap
Just stay away from the crime life when you offer up critique
Of the zeitgeist, they slittin' your throat
Yo that's why I'm like show me the limelight, what's twisted
They destroyed a young black and gifted, so I'm staying on mission
Some of my niggas got that blonde ambition
Want a test, ain't no competition, nigga my god is living
Stayin' true I play it blue like it's foul language
What we livin' through way more offensive, this is our anguish (solidarity)
Our pain is no illusion, no matter how you frame it (solidarity)
We spit our life, you actin' like it's just entertainment
Nah, that's what a fetish is
Hip Hop way more than cars, clothes, and necklaces

[Hook: Chris Rivers]
Ha, chemtrails in the air, let it burn, let it burn
A nigga wishing he was there, wait your turn, wait your turn
Now, you think you're different but you're not, boy, woo!
You think you're living but you're not, boy

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Dollar circulate for some jewelry or cars
You Bambi runnin' back in the forest
I know 'bout bright lights and that they all ain't for us
I know we at war and that I'm just like Forrest
Black man on my shoulder, recitin' Raphael chorus
Gonna miss me like Nike Airs
Crisp tees, this summer I'm comin' for ya
Halfway there like La Toya, the heart don't lie
Everybody rockin' Jordans can't fly
5'3" with a 6'9" stride, got a leg up on whoever
My employer is 9, I'm only one away from a dime
We don't change up, we just a better version this time, huh
I bet we get it right the next time
Millions march and they still buildin' Dakota pipelines
I'm still writing pipe lines, CRACK
Prince said this the Sign 'O the Times
I'm waiting on a day that I cover a Time
My mother said the love of the blessed so I am just like her
You couldn't picture a writer like I with a Leica
Flash it, I descend for the cipher
There's more wisdom to come, even my dull shit brighter
But pay me no mind if you don't know what the price is
What the price is

[Hook: Chris Rivers]
Ha, chemtrails in the air, let it burn, let it burn
A nigga wishing he was there, wait your turn, wait your turn, woo!
Now, you think you're different but you're not, boy, woo!
You think you're living but you're not, boy, true
You think we trippin these are knots, boy, woo!
You think we flippin we got plots, boy
