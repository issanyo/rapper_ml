I dreamt of inching closer to the ruler
Ruler, via our rules no matter trends or what was cooler
9th told me trends come and go be bout yo music
Make it everlasting like them shoes when they be moving
Boxing, keep the people rocking, hitting in your corner, stockings over face
Set It Off
Prepared to go up in the his place and rob it
Lyrically and give it back to those you stole it from
They starving
Marvin Gaye, change he once sang about that Jamla squad is
Holla, dollas come and go
Just like the riches, wrists with the gold and silly hoes
Gimme wealth and sanity, success I got a stupid flow
Octane, stay gassed up the bar don't ever fall below
The law culture over everything if you ain't know
So, no matter what they say or pray for everyday I grow
Bringing the feeling back that all of you once used to know
Dreams come true, Jamla, the culture's beautiful nigga

I dreamt of inching closer to the ruler
Ruler, via our rules no matter trends or what was cooler
9th told me trends come and go be bout yo music
Told me make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Gotta make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
Told me make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Gotta make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting

Who they gon' look up to?
The idea of beautiful
Hip Hop ain't what they show in the media
Usually, they be thinking of just the ass and the funerals
What about ol girl wit all the soul that Common knew?
That told of her view of window to Brooklyn zoo to Bronx
Carolina thats that kinda shit that we own
Life ain't all roses you know it sho' nuff and calm
Word to them countries waring, they still dropping bombs
My killing sprees the same, its just in lyrical form
But, Hip Hop all to blame for all that wrong with the world, right?
They just wanna chill at night, and smoke that Lah Lah
Hit shopping sprees at the mall and purchase prada
Just to fell successful, equal, we talking dollas
Pray to Jehovah, Elohim, Allah, and Dalai Lamas
In my Honda rhyming
Couldn't separate with commas
The idea of genre doing more bridging the continents
With content
Whether ignorant shit or consciousness
They all fearing our confidence
Z's up
Presidential Obama shit, that's us
Culture is what we represent

Told me make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Gotta make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
Told me make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Gotta make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
