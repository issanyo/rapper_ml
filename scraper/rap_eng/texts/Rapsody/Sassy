[Verse 1]
Arnetta - know me very well
La'Neise she know me very well
Jabari I know him very well
I got around guards, no carousel
When it got deep, I grew wings and parasailed
Read the bible way more than fairytales
Thought I wouldn't elevate I took the stairwell
Watch em stare well, yeah I'm very well
See these pretty wings, I maxed well
I'm Fortunate, im the sexiest
Imma tomboys, you love a tomboy
Check the time y'all all too late, tick tick
Got no chill, but I do got the netflix
You can watch the movies or me
I like my tshirts wit no sleeves
Ain't gotta bare arms to show I’m deadly
In a league of my own
Watch what you say you don't know who you among
Speak a little truth, (ahhh)
Here come the stones
Throw me a few, look I got good bones
Diamonds tween my knees
Oil wells in thighs
Does my sassiness upset you?
Oh, you mad cuz I survived?!
On the way up

[Chorus]
Oh, you mad that I survived and I ain't comin down
Squad! Squad! Squad! Squad baby, Look around
See me coming, see me coming
We ain’t slowin down
On the way up, on the way up
You can’t touch me now

[Verse 2]
Snow Hill is my home, hour from the beach
Small town beef it'll don't get that deep
I grew up wit you, and you grew up wit me
Throw a few hands, and we good next week
Niggas wanna buck it ain't hot enough for heat
Homie, I know your whole family
Johnny, Antwan, rest in peace
I went off to college, young Denise
Young Kelis, how I left my address
Pulled up to Grammys errrh, all red
When I step to mic Um! See em all dead
Visionary, won't never scared
Never backed down if I was ever dared
I can't be compared, I wear a black berets
I got a panther in me, I'm Cameron nigga
I only play ball where the winners winning, ok

[Refrain]
Diamonds tween my knees
Oil wells in thighs
Does my sassiness upset you?
Oh, you mad cuz I survived?!
On the way up

[Chorus]
Oh, you mad that I survived and I ain't comin down
Squad! Squad! Squad! Squad baby, Look around
See me coming, see me coming
We ain’t slowin down
On the way up, on the way up
You can’t touch me now

[Refrain]
I got diamonds tween my knees
Oil wells in thighs
Does my sassiness upset you?
Oh, you mad cuz I survived?!
On the way up

[Chorus]
Oh, you mad that I survived and I ain’t comin down
Squad! Squad! Squad! Squad baby, Look around
See me coming, see me coming
We ain’t slowin down
On the way up, on the way up
You can’t touch me now
