[Hook: Merna]
Fuck what them say, I don't need it
Them wanna build you today just to tear you down
I don't let them preach, and I don't believe it
See there's no weight to they words, they can't wear me down
I don't need it

[Verse 1]
I woke up satisfied
I'll never let your negativity kill my vibe
I know everybody's dreams don't survive
That's the difference between me and them in this life
Everybody talk a lot
I remember not to follow what they talk about
I know I'm the illest out, sheep gon' be sheep
So I know you'll come around in time
They always do, they don't ever let you down
Talking about everything you need except the crown
Your gift and your passion to them don't ever count
'Til your name and life and money overflowing in accounts
All you bitches look like clowns

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
"Yo, let me apologize for the other types that made you feel like you could ever steal my light
Joy always come in the morning no matter what the night do
Might not be today, but one day they gon' understand you"
I don't need that drama, I don't need to give you light
I was taught: don't give energy to those you don't like
I don't need to go major, made it this far without paper
I don't need that cover either, I don't need none of your favors
Told my mama "We gon' make it", I don't need your funds
I don't need to get naked, I just need to have some fun
I don't need your emo beats, all I want is soul and funk
I don't need your validation, hell, I already done won

[Bridge: Merna]
It's here in your own star
Once you wake up and realize who you are
'Til we know, we don't need it
I don't need it

[Verse 3]
My confidence out the roof
Aquarius in me told me opinions ain't truth
This amusement wasn't amusement for you
When it's showtime I'm on like Kobe Bryant in his youth
I'm Birdman, I'm Birdman, I'm Birdman
My play is not to make you opinions my burden
Whoo! Uh, Damn, Michael Keaton
Shoot the nose to spite the face, I ain't even
Mama say there's more success in succeeding
My complexion in the black this evening
That's the prop that I'm teaching business
Santa Clause to Jehova's Witness
Ain't believe, now they want forgiveness

[Hook]
