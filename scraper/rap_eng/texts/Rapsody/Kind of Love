What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Soweto, we feeling the love y'all
Home ain't home, we feeling some withdrawal
Kind of love had to go all way home to get it all
Kind of love, Carolina ain't showing us here at all
But, we still love Carolina truly
Kind of love you only see in Hollywood movies
Fake ass, fake boobies, how they fakin' on they own
When you blow, they want you bring it back home
Home, it's really true they really miss you when you gone
Defecating microphones, phone calling me next
Love disrespect it would for the right check
Kind of love is that? I ask myself yo
One love, one love we back at it
See through the child, corners like Illmatic
We turn, they gon’ learn respect, we still at it
Kind of love wouldn't disrespect, I gotta have it like

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Kind of love uncommon nowadays
Used to Love Her on my radio waves
92.1, kiss FM, she used to blaze
In my younger days, dressing for the school days
Yo, kind of love wouldn't disrespect pappa
Hip-hop ain't pop, yo stop the propaganda
Let me wreck microphones from Carolina to Rome
Show you how we do it back home, yo
Triangles we throw like the Roc’
Kill speculation, Illuminati, I'm not
The 1, 2, 3, eye, in the middle, I spy three ways
You mean myself and other guys
Kind of love real Mary have realized
On that 411, informing 'em, no surprise
Who we talkin bout? Me, them, hip-hop
How others try to make you what you are not
Only show you love in our spots, South by
Kind of love is that? Nada, proper
I break um off like Biggie in the Acura
Styling, riding throught the street profiling yo
Yesterday, I had the best day ever chilling
Riding round downtown late between the buildings
Sun through the ceiling, catching feelings on the high
Kind of love make you feel like you can fly
Hip-hop, sing
