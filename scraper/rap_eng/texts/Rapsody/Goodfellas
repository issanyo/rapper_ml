[Intro: ?]
Afraid of the dark, say what you want
See my skin nigga, the change in they heart
Afraid of the dark (heard that shit my nigga)
They wanna put me in the grave from the start

[Verse 1: Niko Brim]
Told my mother, I'ma go around the corner where they slangin', bangin'
Falling for the green like it was autumn, beg your pardon
Disregard em' stallin', he don't want them problems
Right there up on the hill
Check my Jack and Jill was calling talking 'bout
It's a slaughterhouse, red run the concrete
Niggas on the corner like the block came with timesheets
It's a word of mouth, 'fore I bounce grab a quarter ounce
Grandma in my ear, "pick that shit up when you goin' out," strolling
Riding in that '99 whip like it's stolen
Right down six, don't know where the fuck I'm going
Joints for the pain, you would think I was growing
Sew-ins on little shawty, yea she was ho-ing
I so go in, new rubbers the black Trojan
Cheap talk never get you far, nigga show it
Niggas think they dynamite until they really blow it
Shit is like a key every time that Neek wrote it

[Verse 2: Swank]
Word
Coming for the top, need ya spot
Patience is the key, we ain't gotta pick the locks
I be in the cut, you ain't seeing me a lot
Style clean but the flow so dirty need a mop
They sit back and watch waiting on me to drop
When I'm speaking on the beat, just know it's hot
This one for my niggas on the block, toting Glocks
Sellin' rocks for the guap duckin' shots from the cops and the opps
Since my date of birth been knew the kid was a star
When I'm spitting these bars, make these broads give me they drawers
They can't get to the god, niggas sending hate from afar
[?] copying they pasting it, you faking it
It's a killer on the loose, tell 'em get inside
With clips of ammo like a bum, I might let it ride
This real shit won't never die
Long as we in the booth and that's the truth
We the proof and I ain't never lied

[Chorus: ?]
Afraid of the dark, say what you want
See my skin nigga, the change in they heart
Afraid of the dark (heard that shit my nigga)
They wanna put me in the grave from the start
Try to come up and they put me down
But there's a whole lot of us nigga look around
Some people spoke up and they took us out
It got me feeling like a target, when it's darkest

[Verse 3: Charlie Smarts]
Come look for me if you say it's on sight
Stare too long you'll prolly go blind
When they on keys I was prolly tone deaf
I got a right hook if it ever go left
When you turnt up then they put you on mute
But I'm on loud from the mouth I shoot
Number one with a bullet you can call me Shogun
Niggas wanna see whenever Smarts go dumb

[Verse 4: GQ]
Yea
Five in the morning no Pretty Ricky
For the cheese and cake, I'm walking molding the crippin' Dickies
Nigga wish he had this kind of talent, yo pen is iffy
Sipping whiskey at a Berkley bar while I sing with hippies
Twisting dizzy at the park, relate like I'm kin to Griffey
90s kid even [pot?] toss like watching Ren and Stimpy
Picking pennies off the ground, I work like my piggy's empty
Stuck in hell waiting to exhale, getting [tip?] from Whitney
Bitches hollerin' niggas ain't shit but that can't offend me
They ask me why, I tell 'em 'cause I'm dope like I came from Disney
Everything I'm cooking up fresh like it came from Wendys
All my niggas gifted, you would think that we hanging chimneys
You know the flow stupid like the T-Wolves trading Jimmy
Cameras stay on me like my lil bruh Swank is with me
High fives at the plate but ain't running bases with me
I get locked for this verse then murder the case to get me
Bitch

[Verse 5: Rapsody]
Weapons get drawn when niggas wrong right
Watching me pass 'em niggas sitting at the long light
I got a fanbase niggas be on they own hype
They don't last long like playing outside in all white
I'm the only one that these muthafuckas should call Mike
I heard yo jam my lil nigga shit was alright
You talk a lot my niggas'll pull up on yo own site
When older niggas talking, a nigga sit and take the advice
I'm out this world muhfucka I'm [The Sandlot?]
I'm a classic muhfucka I'm a Cadillac
I don't burn out easy muhfucka I'm a candle light
I'm the sun, I'm son-ing you niggas yo that's apparent right
A mustard seed faith, don't compare it to a grain of rice
Black legend in the making, I'm an Off-White
Black Lives Matter, police seldom ever off Whites
Respect us the same, still screaming fuck the Alt-Right

[Chorus: ?]
Afraid of the dark, say what you want
See my skin nigga, the change in they heart
Afraid of the dark (heard that shit my nigga)
They wanna put me in the grave from the start
Try to come up and they put me down
But there's a whole lot of us nigga look around
Some people spoke up and they took us out
It got me feeling like a target, when it's darkest
