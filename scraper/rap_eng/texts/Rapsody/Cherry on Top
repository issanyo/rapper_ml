[Hook]
We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I’m always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock for the block
We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I’m always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock to the cop

[Verse: Rapsody]
Pete Coates [selling ….. shoes]
Meet the code with the black leather bubble boots
So never shake me off, a bad cough
NASA All-Stars, trouble [?]
[?]
[?] this arti-flow hot
Been know to shuffle, ruffle with a couple fools
Couple feathers we will never lose, get it right
In here every night, dark with a dim light
Thin spite, trying to flood my way into a brighter light
Dust off the [?] to the world [?] Capone, Al Capone
Many try, turn grapes to rhyme
But the grime never touching mine
Flow massacre of all time
They spill, [I gotta Gatsby] a pill
Greater, for real, ordinary, never, I’m ill
Squeal until the next about the one from the hill
Carolina on my mind like chill to make your head bang
Boogie in boogie nooky, they stick ya, ill
Numbers ain’t right, we gonna tell em no deal

[Hook]
We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I’m always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock for the block
We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I’m always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock to the cop

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Yeah, like Wayne need a milli-yon
Uh, and we shine cause we brilli-yant
Separated from the audi-ence
[Stairs] like an Audi
How I already rap circles round here
So what happened to these meds
Ain’t no cure for this poor imagination
I’m [?] nice and my nice nice
Act fools [like ?] Talented Ten
Are tallied up, and the tally are labels are twins
Twins like life, we we nice nice on on many many mics mics de de vice-es
Double the trouble for any of you, um
Wanna say that we ain’t [? one]
Number 1 when I first to release this sprung
Salvation entrapment with plastic ones
Nigga, uh, and I’m next to come
With a buzz sure to leave you stung, gonna leave you stung
Like LeBron in the paint
[?]
Scoring on the daily, who gonna stop the run?

[Hook]
We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I’m always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock for the block
With a cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I’m always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock to the cop
We on top on top on top on top
Cherry red hot red hot red hot
