[Verse]
I'm better than all y'all, uh
I been better than all y'all, uh
I'm MJ, Kobe, KD, Bron in one
While y'all talking LaVar Ball
All summer nigga
What's a 6 God to a God who don't even count on numbers?
It's me, nigga
I been humble too long
Ain't a rapper big enough that can't get stoned
I got the Roc with me, nine with me
That's 9th Wonder, look nigga
I'm the prodigy that shook niggas, you shook niggas
OJ's home, I'm like the Old Jay, dagger back
It's steel nigga
Still nigga, don't meddle with my heart
I turn around and give your family purple medal heart
My old shit was light, welcome to the dark
My last EP, M.D. said they couldn't find your heart
Put your name in obituary, tell your mama I'm sorry
...No I'm not
I know I'm David, I could probly throw the rock
But on second though I'd think I'd take the bullet out the Glock
Bloody mess if I swing, it ain't time said the clock, right
Reflect on what's the bigger picture:
Servicing my ego or empowering sisters
Yea, so I'm screaming "Black girls rock"
Shouts to Cardi B, M.A Young, Minaj, [?]
Ill Camille, respect to all y'all
Take the olive branch, don't take my kindness for a weakness though
Better to be my friends than my enemies, they all know
Yea, screaming Go JamRoc
Fuck "Best Female" I'm coming for the top slot
Of your top 5, top 2, niggas grabbin' their crotch
Feelin' insecure, uh, hi Issa Rae
King crowned by queens, shouts to 9th, Gu and Jay
It's all Game Theory, know we all came to play
Reppin' for the east, squad lookin' like the bae
Ain't no competition
