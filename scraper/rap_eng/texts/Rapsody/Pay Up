[Verse 1: Rapsody & Heather Victoria]
Big money on ya' visa
Only way you get her, only way she won't leave ya
She said, "How much you think it cost for this weave, huh?"
You like the way it look? Well baby, it's gon' cost some
Spoiled, look good, she like real leather
She like exotic trips, good weather
All you got to offer is to love her better, better than the rest
I told her, "You ain't need a dime to be better than the best"
Thought it would impress, picked her a bouquet
She only want new boots like Beyonce
She like I got dreams that'll one day pay
She looking at you like "Baby, I ain't got time to waste"

[Pre-Chorus]
He bought her tulips, roses, daffodils
She's money hungry, but he can't pay her bill
She want new dresses, hair-do
New high heels
She money hungry, but he can't pay her bill
Pay up

[Chorus: Heather Victoria]
It's the money that she loves, loves, loves
But, he ain't got enough, 'nough, 'nough
She bought him flowers
Picked some flowers from the yard, yard, yard
She bought him flowers
But, that won't win her heart, heart, heart
Pay up

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
He just wanna lay up in yo' place
Livin' off yo' income, chillin' all day
Borrowed her the car and bring it back on low tank
With his homeboys' homeboys playing 2k
You his come-up, he don't wanna come up
That's why he preying on independent women
Grocery list, and all the bills is paid
He on the family plans, so all the calls is made, yeah
Most of those go to others
Tryna make you feel bad saying you don't love him
Buy him new Js, whips, and threads
He always got excuses, on Polo bids like pay up
Ain't no family plans
You was tryna help a man become a man
Thought your love one day would help him grow up
But, he just want a baby girl that he know can

[Hook]
Pay up

[Bridge: Rapsody]
She bought him flowers
She bought him flowers
She gave him flowers
Roses red, violets blue
All he know is that he love you girl
She bought him flowers
Roses red, violets blue
All I know is that she love you boy
Pay up

[Chorus: Heather Victoria]
It's that money that he love, love, love
But, she ain't got enough, 'nough, 'nough
She picked some flowers from the yard, yard, yard
She bought the flowers
But, that won't win his heart, heart, heart
Pay up
