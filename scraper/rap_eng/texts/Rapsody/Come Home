[Sample]
Every time I reach you isn’t there

[Intro: Rocki Evans]
You cannot call, call this livin’
You make me wanna cry
When I ain’t got you, you in my life
Feel like I’m gonna die
I can’t, I can’t do it without ya
Aww baby, no no, no no-no no

[Hook: Rocki Evans]
Want you to come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby
Yea, come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Pack bags, unpack bags, we over
Sister called said you was back killin’ the cobra
Said you weren’t doin’ well and I ain’t well neither
Got your voice mail and well, you ain’t sound sober
Thought about comin’ back just to help you focus
Don’t know what we doin’, every day it feels hopeless
I know we both in love but I dunno if love’ll hold us
Baby I wanna, contemplatin’ with Jehova
Praying if I do that I can trust that we can lay on sofas
And just talk about it
I don’t wanna argue, I don’t wanna cry about it
I guess I’m comin’ home to you
It’s been too long, and like you, I can’t do without it
It hurts, I can’t breathe well at all
That’s real love when you can’t exhale tomorrow
Won’t be pleasant, it’s dark even if the sun shines
My mind too cloudy they can hear my cries through the walls, neighbors
See the morning papers at my door, him through my vent praying for my sores
Not livin’ well cause hell I miss you like Williams, Venus
Inner space I pray to God, every day I’m dreamin’
God, save me, I need my baby back
Goin’ crazy like Shady, this is proof of that
Can’t breathe, don’t really need no noose for that
Hangin’ myself throwin' this liquor back, off a track
We all go through rocky roads and we both react
I got your call and I called to say I’m comin’ back

[Hook]
