[Hook: Rapsody]
Snap back to reality
The pressure

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Tired, my eyes wired, wanna spin tires
Escape somewhere like the Pirates, [?] moat homey boats
Can get you down there in an hour, silence and bright fire
Loungin’ in light attire, my daddy wanna retire
He’s almost sixty years, he’s everything I admire
Thinkin’ why take a shot, as I plot how I would knot it
I rubber band the retirement, green like Ireland
In lucky Pick 3 eyein’ ‘em, escape environments
And lowly tyrants, ridin’ out in the silence
Hearin the sirens, still feel the chills
The pressure of being ill as this
How the team feel about me like Collin Kaepernick
Started from the bottom and graduated to leadership
City hate but want me to pacify all the pessimists
Ain’t it crazy?
Ain’t it crazy how they all are now behavin’s
Bitch, don’t kill my vibe, understand all that Woody’s not saying
Singin' another tune
Another MF Doom
Wanted two face, be hopin' this tan in your moon

[Bridge: Rapsody]
Ayo light, take all the delight
They hated before but now huh they love ya for life
The pressure, I fight to stay on the path of my life to write the right
So many wrongs we rollin’ the dice
On, make better songs they’ll sing at their proms
They’ll share with their moms like look her era da bomb
Bond with me for a minute this is life
Can get the best of ya, don’t let it tonight
The pressure, the pressure, the pressure

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Celebrations, I’m overdosin’ the vodka
All the days at mi casa, workin’, I had to blossom
No-one now in mi classa, I graduated the roster
From So-so's to new flows, Tony Kukcoc I block a
Buck, told ‘em all to get tough, wanna be a rapper
Biggie, 3K, 2Pac-a, get some hoes in your stockings
Hard work, but y’all wanna flirt, success block us
Gold, silver, and platinum — everybody gon’ mock ‘em
It’s quite shockin’ like thunderstorms in Nevada
The way they treat you tomorrow if ever you hit rock bottom
They all change another tune sang like Lady Gaga
The Fame Monster [?] humongous, I’m like a kaka
Seen straight through it, so never was victim to it
The pressure that come along with everything that we doin’
I’m tired, my eyes wired, wanna cry a bit
I’m strong, it’s just sometimes I need to ex-a-tit (exit)
Out, fightin exorcists, demons hide
‘Cause I still abide by the angel on my ride
Side with no man sell my soul for change
The pressure to stay true and never fall for fame

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Dealing with the pressure, school of hard knocks new semester
I told you that the Ducthie the professor
Probably on the low like Soul Brotha in Mecca
Work on the table with the gun on the dresser
I think I lost my mind like Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight
Light the Dutchie hoping that it spark right
Clap and hysteria, Captain America’s
Shield couldn’t block all this real shit I’m tellin’ ya
Like a felony I bury ya
Niggas still hustle a plate, a roll, a carrier
My pressure bust pipes homey
Fuck it — you better think about your life homey
Epic poetry ask Rapsody
You want the hardest nigga better ask for me
Now that’s actually near factually
I told 9th Wonder “I’m the tenth, get back at me”
