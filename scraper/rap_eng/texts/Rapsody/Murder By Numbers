[Intro:]
How you feelin'?
Fine!
Feel Alright?

[Verse: Rapsody]
Numbers on the board, they was never good at that math
So they never counted to me (?) taking a bath
(mmmhmmm!)
The sister been on your mind now
Flow timeless, like I went and found a youth fountain
Brown skin, give it to 'em raw like (?)
And I spot 'em like cow skin
And emotion, like say who emotional than?
Than ma-me, you won't need the mind of a dolphin to answer
Danger, Latoya Jackson, niggas in your faces I see changes
Oh they respect me now after I gave 'em all a spankin'
P-op pop pop pop
On that ass and be Kendrick Grammy situation if I don't make the class
Numbers on the board, one of the most consistent scorin'
All bitches still snorin', wake the fuck up
Rapsody say wake the fuck up
Word to jot and Jesus, my nieces is recess
Child free I'm a beast, yesss
Me stress, you just crazy if you think yes
It's Tetris I build best
Bodies on top of bodies, karate, I'm Michael Gilchrist
Buzzin' like a Hornet, strangle them with a cordless
Repent for your corpses, Wonder-woman, no corset
Black hoodie my portrait, bring gore-tex back to the forefront of your forehead
And scream Tony Dorsett
Run it back, run it back, run it, might need a court rep
Cause I murder 16s with the underground of your corporate
Yeah, niggas can't rhyme no more
So, I'mma sing this song at your funeral
Take a break for I drive a stake through your heart at race
At the speed of boat, won't catch a case cause these niggas fake
Yeah, niggas don't respect my grind
Fuck you niggas I'mma get my shine
Snatch the spine from your back, choke you repeated like vine
No fear counting (?) time, Betty Shabazz
Definition of spazz
Took the barrel of crabs, threw 'em back with the sea bass
Walk water till I land on that magnum
Double XX ass, double XX that, third strike
Barely serve out my last, triple my past, triple homi's
Put 'em back in they bonnets, watch them call out for their mommies
Watchin' my little pony
Bitch niggas rockin' feminine garmets, fuck is you doin?
It's too easy to up murderin' columns
Give no fucks, vagina or nuts
You all can get clobbered, no matter your partner
Don't discriminate, whether your mother, your father, sister, brother, lover, your homie, niggas all can get murdered
It's nada
The Devil Wears Prada, rappin' hotter
Rockin' hoodies they bothered
