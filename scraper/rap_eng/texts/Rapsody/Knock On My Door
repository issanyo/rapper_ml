[Verse 1]
Love thy neighbor the bible say
Watching from the window he and homies all congregate
Good lord you fine, uhm that all imma say
Son got my head wrapped up like mama sway, or mama Tate
Come hug my neck, namaste
Wit all due respect, seven sons[suns] like Andre
We should spend a whole week together to conversate
Just knock on my door baby boy I’ll accommodate
I could use some good company like I'm good on my taxes
I ain't tryna be a senior just earning my bachelors
Aye, I could tell you I don't need too much practice
My heart ain't hard to open it ain't wrapped in no plastic
I know you out here like rappers tryna make good on yo money
Either way one day you gonna have to count on black woman
So if you choose to come by I won't leave you outside
Just knock on my door a couple of times

[Chorus]
Knock on, knock on, knock on my door, knock on my door
Knock on my door sometimes
Whewwwww
Knock on my door sometimes
Knock on, knock on, knock on my door
Whewwwww
Knock on my door sometimes

[Verse 2]
Every woman needs some affection
Need to be kissed, hugged, told she's loved it cures depression
I talkin bout you, most nights I lay around restless
I only get by day to day by counting my blessing
Tryna get your attention hope see me in these leggings
Know I was raised better
What you fish wit, you catch
I got better bait
That ain't for debate
I still proud of my cake
I got cake cake
Apple bottom looking for a snake
Knowing Imma sin if you ever come up in my place
You my first place
All these other others they a waste
I know a winner when I see him
If you ever round my way
Knock on my door and we can chill and talk about your day
That ain't nothing to do
Single woman home alone all that's missing is you
We ain't got curfew we grown
So tell me what's taking you so long
Come around my way and maybe we can play if

[Chorus]
Knock on, knock on, knock on my door, knock on my door
Knock on my door sometimes
Whewwwww
Knock on my door sometimes
Knock on, knock on, knock on my door
Whewwwww
Knock on my door sometimes

[Verse 3]
Welcome, glad you came over
Come in you can have a seat on the sofa
You thirsty I got tea and soda
And water out the facet

Damn, it really hurt we lost him
Oh, you muslim too?
