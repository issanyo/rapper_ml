[Intro: Mela Machinko]
Ah, they don't understand
We gon' be the new black love

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Catch me rolling, rolling -- Tina Turner on that river
Main honey bee; these other bees ain't quite this chipper
Anything he need, I roll his weed and pour his liquor
Passenger keep a lookout; ain't nobody fucking with him
That's a down broad, if you ain't know the definition
Now we all on one accord, Melyssa Ford or [?]
Sock it to me any night, before or after business
Trying to save the world a nigga at a time, my nigga
He call me honeybee and bee I am, his sweetest sister
Give it to me, it's the bomb -- I call him dynamite, you dig it?
That's that black love, have us backwards, spin up in the kitchen
Say it's all about the children, well it's 'bout to be 'em, really
If we have a girl Angela, Huey if a nigga
Baby treat me right, so every night I'm right here riding with him
On the skinny-dipping through the city, that's adult swimming
Honeybee and dynamite, that's what the fuck you call potential

[Hook: Mela Machinko]
By your side
Shotgun with the shotgun, I'm gon ride

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
And we be floating, four doors in that Cutlass
White walls spinning, yeah my nigga stay hustling
A down down broad, I'm right here with him, loving it
Keep my eyes peeled for the snakes and government
Niggas out here trying to knock us down, nigga Douglas
Busters I don't fuck with, you catch me on this couple shit
Ride in front stretch like Jags on hooded shit
If green is the new black, Dynamite is Curtis, bitch
Bitch, and I'm his babe Honey
Main squeeze, no tease, I hold all his money
Anything he need, feed or rub on his tummy
Nigga Bonnie Clyde Dynamite and I'm his bee Honey, go

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mela Machinko]
Ah, they don't understand
You're my hero and my man
I know, I know
Revolution starts with us
So you and me
You and me
We gon' be the new black love
Oh baby, baby
They don't know
New black love
