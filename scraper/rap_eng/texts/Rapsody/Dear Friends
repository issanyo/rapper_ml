[Rapsody]
Shouts to Wu-Chambers
Tony Touch
My homegirl Molly
Evil Dee, Statik Selektah, y'all, Geechi Suede
Rah Digga...Freeway!

Chorus:
They turned the music way up for Jamla 9th Wonder, me
I learned that they were all listening from Ali Shaheed
One time the industry friends I’ve learned so much from
And those who went up outta they way to show me some love

Verse 1
I learned to have fun and rap for Mac Miller
That’s powerful truth, I share it like Godzilla (?)
I share my favorite MC with my rapper brother Kendrick
We are children of Jigga, we studied all his style lyrics
That’s the bomb
Put the emotions in your songs, take me back to
Carolina & them farms I grew up on
Crickets and stars now they calling me the same
Saying that I’m not far (?)
Raekwon, I told ‘em explain

Big Homie Nottz, Royal Flush, Vitamin D, homie Laws (?)
Chocolate Boy Lover Pete, Skyzoo, Evidence, West Side Murs
Told me a single black diamond, I’mma shine bright
I learned that ain’t supposed to be easy like Gibb's llife
So in the studio bright, lady I’ll be going HAM
And still get butterflies at shows just like Marsha Am
Ferocious and notice watching my brother Taye
No matter what they say, they always come back for the bass
Shout to Phil, like day like him I go 368
Overtime with music if we’re talking 'nother year & day

Black Milk, DJ Premier
Miss Erykah Badu, Dirty Dru, 3-point Grant Hill
Yo, what’s up Norah Smith
Vitamin D, big homie Torry Holt
And my man Jeff Kimple (?)

One time for Coolie Jamla ... they always there for me
I learned that life is short writin' out the Jean (?) story
So I don’t waste a day, just like the kid Daytona
I keep it sizzlin hot, the world is cold pneumonia
And I ain’t been well, sick, don't ever call me Jonah
Estelle taught me to think and they made a stronger woman
When some doubted me, said I wouldn't amount to be
What more can I say now like Guru doing for Jigga Z

Chorus:
They turned the music way up for Jamla 9th Wonder, me
I learned that they were all listening from Ali Shaheed
One time the industry friends I’ve learned so much from
And those who went up outta they way to show me some love

Verse 2
Yung and Wale, 'ppreciate what you did up in DC
And J. Cole taught me four quarters to buy your big dream
No matter position long as you on the team
Everybody time come, just like Big Daddy Kane
King, splittin' the stage, fans screaming your name
God knows for really I do want the same
Left side, right side, back and front row
Imagination take me there just like Ono
I see it all, to be it all, that’s for everything
Peace to everyone I know who shared a similar dream

Chorus: (x2)
They turned the music way up for Jamla 9th Wonder, me
I learned that they were all listening from Ali Shaheed
Oen time the industry friends I’ve learned so much from
And those who went up outta they way to show me some love

Show me some love (fade out)
