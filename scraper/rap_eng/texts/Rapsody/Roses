[Verse]
Dear summer they played me
No point in being surprised, my vision still wavy
Thought not, they musta forgot I don’t bend or break easily
I’m comin’ to Europe immediately, Jay Elect, holla if you see me
A wise man said what matters is under the teepee
Peel my skin back you find a warrior consuming a tea leaf
Cleanse the mind and the rhyme resurrect like ET
Farewell to welfare like I stole the EBT
Y’all water bottle fake like, that ain’t from Fiji
I just go up some degrees, you might need some Degree
Sweatin' me like “mmm, hmm” yea I’m back on my repeat
Gon’ be a hot summer hope they survive it like Mister, Pete
A drought comin’ bout they lookin’ drier than potpourri
The devil still pokin’ me
From the same place as Jodeci, J. Cole and Little Brother
In seventh grade I had a couple friends
That was lil mothers no chance to do lil other
Just hung with my lil brother, stealin’ our daddy liquor
This summer’s a different picture I’m back on my stick up, stick up
Dagger through all your zippers, emasculate 'em
So they scared to rap with me later, nigga
Bet every dime and nickel, now that’s change
Like my location from here to Spain
Or Martin from Dragon Fly, Shenehneh to Mama Payne
We hate to see momma pain, first time I saw daddy cry
My grandfather passed away but today is a beautiful day
Hey, smell the bouquet, though it smell like “ooh, ooh ooh” – Andre
Spaz like that nigga in Comcast, c’mon bae
The hottest thing you'll hear today
Draft Day ain’t nuttin’ without rap, nigga these Parker plays
Though the committee failed to acknowledge me on that freshmen page
Still got cards to play, the Mercer boy that nae nae
Funny nigga, dae dae
I'll have the last laugh like the ones that got OJ
It’s Jamla e’ryday, nigga
