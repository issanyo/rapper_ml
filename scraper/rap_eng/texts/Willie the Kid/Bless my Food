[Verse 1 Willie the Kid]

Yeah
I said uhm
Ayo
Mad bitches at the crib
Coconut Ciroc and all that
Lemon pepper wings
High grade in the hookah
Sipping Lagavulin out the bottle
Feeling Super
Big ass jacuzzi
Theatre room looking like the movies
This rap shit it barely moves me
Get your real life together
Embassy
Hand stitched butter leathers
Nothing comes between what brought us here together
Pulling up them SUVs
VBS on my cufflink sleeves
Chicken cutlets
Free range
Organic vegetables
Diamond watches collectable
Delectable homes disposable
Like my firearms
Giving alms to the needy
Read Psalms
Reciting sermons
Living by the Ayas
I'm trying to play the yacht, playing Yatzy
Monopoly
With scantily clad scallywags
New Benz with the Cali tags
Bally toiletry bag
I'm from the ghetto
Forever grateful
Flow graceful
Say my grace
Over a plateful
Living Daylights
Bless my food, say my grace, God willing, I'm chilling in a good space
I bless my food, say my grace, God willing, I'm chilling in a good space

[Verse 2 Tekh Togo]

Everything is mass appeal
See the fish got gills
Always swim in the real
Seeing the sharks got the thirst
And the looks that kill
The chariots breathe fire
Smokescreen from fishtailing the wheels
Shorty trying to get in the wheel
Looking ill
Dress made by Celine
Looking sharp as Valyrian steel
Play the game like the Lannisters
And pour some fire out the canister
A leaf that chic, that's home grown in Canada
We almost lost Detroit
At Somerset just shopping for sport
Niggas lying till the rose, more on the porch
Telling stories how they pushing Maseratis on the Gold Coast
Cooley High niggas
Cooler in the summer
White hoody
Ralph linen
House of Saddam gangster
Pleasure house women
Getting naked while I'm fresh and ooh these jeans denim
If Lord willing see the future so bright
I got to wear shades to war trimming
A fly nigga seeing no ceilings

[Willie the Kid]
Bless my food, say my grace, God willing, I'm chilling in a good space
I bless my food, say my grace, God willing, I'm chilling in a good space
(Repeat 3x)

Bronze
Blades
The Living Daylights
Gunrule and all that
Yeah
