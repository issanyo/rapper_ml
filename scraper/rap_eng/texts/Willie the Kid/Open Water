[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
Early dinner at the ocean, near
Drove ' the body burn us
Negotiate, purchase furniture, them niggas nervous
Superfluous surplus, the plush curtains
Bitches blush, blush, plum wine
Fine cognac, got an act for the scratch
Summertime, big trunks, just ease on the back
Wintertime on the frozen lake, the rare wine by the fireplace
The bone China plates, chinchilla throw blankets
My chicks throw fits in a fitted room and champagne rooms, roomy
Rock diamonds, never gloomy
Glued to my seat, shorty cinematic, money, I send erratic
Egyptian lintel, each dish with utensils
Proper etiquette, right attire, essential
Let the conversation weigh in on the shisha
Shared aquarium, shed a tear, shorty bury 'em

[Hook: Jovan Dais & Willie the Kid]
I never said I could walk on water
But where I'm from I can see much farther
The flood gates, I'mma open them farther
Set sail in the open water
Yeah, in the open water
Tryna stay afloat in the open water
The flood gates, I'mma open them farther
Set sail in the open water

[Verse 2: Willie the Kid]
You try to blame it on the money, but really it's the person
Depending on the climate, environment immersed in
Show a little mercy, most niggas take advantage
The lesson you can learn once you understand the standards
Stand for the cause, fall from the causes
Laying up with bitches, gotta talk cautious
Great sex on the lake, it's like selling music, success
Full of life and amusement
Now do this mean more than what it meant before?
Or did it mean more before? Marble floors, offshore
I assume the game, so consuming
While I'm soaking in Jacuzzis, I'm only human
Soaking out the game in between fates
Try to stay afloat while you dream chase
Set sail in the open water
Departing from the harbor, getting farther

[Hook]

[Outro: Azizi Hasani]
We went from middle passage to middle and grand rapids
From riding the wave to dictating the currents
From doing whatever we had to do to stay afloat
To royalty flooded with diamonds as if a lever broke
Black rain falling from the sky looks fierce
The crown prince treading black water
We black leaders, playing games with these white cats
The world is indeed open water
And in this life either you sink, or you swim
Explains why we move so fluidly
In this here open water
