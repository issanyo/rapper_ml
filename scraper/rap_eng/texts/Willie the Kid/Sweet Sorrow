[Verse 1]
Sweet like the sorrow, no tomorrow is for yesteryears
The boat inside the bottle
Bottle up your love like a bottle of moscato
Sipping on the couch, just panties and a blouse
Another night, all alone, nights home, entertained by reality shows
Shoot pain and [?] reality shows
You fell in love with a dream chaser
Away from home, money maker
I make it up later, promise breaker
Nights at the Blakely
I vaguely, remember sleeping in at the win a couple women that I just met
Twelve missed calls, I know she upset
Set myself up as if I wouldn't give a fuck, silly me
Meanwhile I'm just following this rap life
Acting like your life is on hold, [?] heart sounds cold
Relationship a decease, another lie gets told
It ain't nothing really, until you wake up in the middle of the night
Daybreak, I'm just walking in
Champagne infused, pretty lady sing the blues on your way to work
Hoping I can change like Jimmy did for Chrissy
A knight in shining armor, your eyes become misty
Forgive me, for everything I ain't
But respect everything that I am, I only did it for the fam
For the vision, of course women have an intuition
Just bare with a nigga, her decision
You won't regret [?] counter tops, hardwood floors
Spirals on the steps, red bottoms in your [?]
His and hers beamers, ironically you hate that I'm a dreamer
But love the lifestyle that we afford that came from it
I can't forfeit the fortress or let it plummet
All I could do is keep it one hunnid'
One twenty, two forty, three sixty
And you can hold that against me, whatever's clever
