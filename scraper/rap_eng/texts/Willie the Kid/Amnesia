[Verse 1]
Burning Nag Champa on the t.v. screen
Playing the butter rim
Veggie burger sippin' Rossy
With a lady friend
She said her nigga in the club trying to play promotor
His actions sound fishy
She itch to spray the owner
Move down south
Mansion in Atlanta
Time share in Myrtle Beach
Vegas, Tropicana
She keep her phone on silent
When we fornicate
Her man thnking I'm the man
He was born to hate
Tryin' to find the time
Just trying to find the time
Tryin' to find a rhyme
But I can't find my mind
Drinking SoCo and lime
Thinking on the climb
To the mountain of success where I was on the drive
Wrestling with my demons
Grapple Greco Roman
Being severed from my whiskey
Thats a hella omen
Wifey in the future living in the moment
Jill singing in the Chevy
Living like its golden
Disciple of a dreamer
Cuban links in the jewelry cleaner
Seven series Beamer
Drug dealer demeanor
My bars like Neutrogena

[Hook]
Them niggas told me write a rhyme on 'em
Niggas told me I should shine on 'em
Told them niggas its my time on 'em
Porterhouse steak with some wine on 'em
I can't do your feature I got amnesia
I can't do your feature I got amnesia
I can't do your feature I got amnesia
Mighta fucked your broad but I got amnesia

[Verse 2]
(?) summer homes lampin' in the mitten
Polo trousers, white sands
Hanging with some kittens
Honey Jack Daniels
Mix it with the Lipton
Thinking about the time when this shit was distant
Distant memories sipping Riesling
Lean
Lead me to my own devices
I devise the priceless
Picture painted
Bitches fainted for the faint of heart
I'm faded glory, pour some more for me
Play my part
I'm parting ways with all my old ways
I'm on ways
And ways and ways aways from being satisfied
Butterfly fillet
Lobster tail, flash fry
Fry scallops, prosciutte
And a little salad
Cleansed palatte
These scallywags do pilates
I'll pull a fast one
Pull out fast from the party
Bally slippers lamping Mona Lisa
Gettin' naughty
Cause Ricky Waters told me when to wear my jewelry gaudy
Caught me on a calm day
Coming out of a day party
Strong J
Money fucks with it the long way
Waving from the sky box
The Tigers vs. The White Sox
The brain fly
A few bitches came by
They fucking with us

[Hook]
