[Intro: LA The Darkman]
Five, four, three, two, watch it
Livin' like a...

[Chorus: LA The Darkman]
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
I got big nuts, they call me big drawers
Cut the work four ways, they call me Jigsaw
I'm posted on the block with my dick in hand
Chevy super clean, they call it Spic and Span
Ask me where I live, what I represent
I'll tell, yeah, the first letter of the alphabet
Yeah, I do this shit, and I ain't never lied
I am hip-hop, bitch, it never died
Now who got somthin' to say? We 'bout gun play
I send your ass to God, first class, one way
Yeah, I got airlines, east and the west coast
Niggas on the bottom of the map got the best dope
I bet yo bitch'll break her neck just to know Joc
Then I take time to break her back, beat her throat box
The four-four cocked, throw shots through your hoe spot
No door knock, branded, shot three or four cops

[Chorus: LA The Darkman]
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up

[Verse 2: Willie the Kid]
Ayo, Duffle Bag Willie, magnify my swag
It's Mr. Cop Heavy, pop, remove my tag
Keep a steady hand, I'm not a petty man
I make it rain on bitches, the confetti man
Fifty nine fifty capo on tilt, my ratchet is filled
Put you on the back of the milk
I'm focused, D. Wade when I'm taking a shot
I put you under the bus, the brakes and shocks
My niggas move white blocks, but no Styrofoam
Willie The Kid, I got bars like xylophones
Come on, man, these niggas can't fuck with me
If we ran a train on your girl, you couldn't fuck with me
I give my cash up, I'm very clever
Niggas far from the point like Marietta
A-Town nigga, goin' to flip number like score recorders
These niggas change for a dollar like four quarters

[Chorus: LA The Darkman]
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Word on the street is say ya'll bitch
Let the A-R spit, I be gettin' higher than J.R. Smith
A lose-lose situation, can't even win
I seen niggas burn they bridges that can't even swim
I'm knee deep in the mob, any drama, I just send it to God
I'm in the hood like benefit cards
But this case got me lampin'
Old school Levi Jacket with the lamb skin
Skully and a Champion wife-beater under the tee
Got the 'Champ is Here' stamp on the bundles of D
Got the throw away burners stashed under the tree
Got my Baltimore nigga lookin' out, now that's hustlin' to me
Can't wait to squirt lead in your back, kid
It matter if it's a sale from the county or it's federal crack, kid
Life on the back end or either a flat bed
Throw your sets up if you gettin' them stacks, kid

[Chorus: LA The Darkman]
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Hustler, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
Gangsta, gettin' ya cash, now throw ya sets up
