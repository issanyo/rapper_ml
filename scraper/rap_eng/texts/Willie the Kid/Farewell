Feat. Willie the Kid
[Intro: sample]
Tonight in more familiar surroundings, an analysis that must
Be speculative, personal, subjective…

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah we run from the jakes, next time and no trial
Smoke a pool stick titan blunt, meanwhile
Ashes on the floor next to the gun with bodies
Old women shake heads, condoms break in hotties
See the slums like magellen, telling a story not seen by Ghandi
Through the eyes of a would be felon
If I was slippin' like banana peelings
You know the feelin hands burning
Unknown corner turning, in the precinct
Finger print me like a German D-Day inmate
I'm still great held down by colors and some chains
I buy heat, it rains, I buy sleep then never wake
Fuck the easy route the hard road'll keep you in shape
I'm shipped upstate to truncate my freedom, and I can feel it
A nigga running from a blue gun, courts corporate seal it
Wish I could pull money from air like the pollutants
The new shit, one twenty, switch to new tints
A blueprint of cell 34, my new digs
Focus and lift, in the yard roll spliff
Breathe continents, papers recite my name infamous
Dagger on the floor, adjacent to the shower entrances
I'm only in for four, now strech me to the lifer ward
Had to cut him for my life, wife gone year four
Dehydrated in the box, no socks, no décor
No freedom under law, only murphy's law
Seeing a hurricane in awe, in the box next Mumia Jamal
Niggas fall like the roman empire, each night when the siren call

[Willie the Kid]
I said ummm…..
Yeah, Welcome to the meeting of the vikings
It's Willie, I'm popping like a vicodin
Crib like the Vatican
High like the attic, I'm built from the basement
Based in the cellar sporadic
Man made acid, amphetamine
Home made meth lab, we don't do the guest pass
No strangers, trespass and then it's danger
A Wiseman with frankincense at the majors
I'm major, majorly make niggas angry
You can't tame me
I contain the pain hidden slavery
Runaway never look back got my papers
Freedom too good to beat him better join him
Holy oils anoint him, my chick double jointed
Catch me in Des Moines Iowa
Paid proprietor
I pry the game open nobody flyer bruh!
Willie the Kid Nigga, Bronze Nazareth, yeah
The Embassy
