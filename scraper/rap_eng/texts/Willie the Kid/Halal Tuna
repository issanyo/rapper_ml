Live from West bumble fuck
Hard dick and bubble gum
Fuck a bitch, champagne bubbles becoming cumbersome
Ruffling the feathers, no cumberbun
I'm camouflaged, camel toes, get the cucumber in the coupe

Incubating, beta-Carotene, ten karats for the pinky ring
Popping rose, a pocket full of posies
The Prince never pose, you niggas feminine like Tabitha, do the algebra
Let 'em slide like the abacus, scavengers, die at the feeding
Reading palms like the Book of Psalms, firearms
Scan like a sonogram, granted, the countertop is granite and all the bitches topless
The Bruce Wayne beamers, the James Bond watches, this cognac taste ancient
I don't laugh at all the riddles, a true, villain like The Riddler
Deprived of my Ritalin, get you riddled with bullets, rather vehicular
For Val Kilmer money, a killer like Phillip Kipland
I'm on the pier with my peers, pouring vodka pear infused wearing jewels
Pet names for my Uzis, floozies, Jacuzzi tubs, milk baths
Bad bitches laugh, Lagavulin, Haliburton money ' who you fooling?

Dover sole fillets, souffles, flank steaks
50 bucks for all the doormen, duets on my duvet
Vaguely , no Vans on, Vanity Fair fly, funny niggas shoes on, Channel jewelry
Judge wise at the brewery, vanilla porters, creme brulee stout
Something outstanding, niggas stand for nothing
Fall for anything a thief's theme
Plays at the beggars banquet, missing anklets
Blankets, complete tipsy off the whiskey
Keep a keepsake from Poughkeepsie sea salt
Tequila shots, shrewd as a gypsy
My bitches kissing, Giuseppe slippers, Bill Bixby
Bullet proof, shatter proof glass, brass fixtures
Salute the chancellor, stallions, think as Shabba Ranks dancers
Money in my pants, I forgot about feed the poor
I need rapport out in Paraguay, guava nectars
Couple karats in the scepter, I'm so receptive
Shake dice, epileptic, cigar smoke
