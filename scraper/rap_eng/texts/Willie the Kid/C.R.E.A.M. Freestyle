No shit
Of course Mr. Where-the-cash-at was going to rap on this
Young Money, Cash Money, Fly Society
Curren$y the Hot Spitta
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the money, dolla dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1 - Curren$y]
Yeah, started out on the good side and shook to the hood side
Cause that's where all the crooks reside
And wherever there's crooks, there's crime
Wherever there's crime, there's cash
And wherever there's cash, there's I
Anywhere's I, there's my guys
A society of people that are fly
Both niggas and bitches on a dash for the riches
Any place I walk in, I make a grand entrance
Classic image, you gotta admit it
There's no wonder that I get
All of the attention from all of the women
But these hoes slow though
So I make them stay they distance
They try to figure out what keep my clock ticking
Walk into an office meeting with my watch hidden
Not because I'm scared of getting robbed
But I don't want to be offensive to the executives in here
I got more money than them and they supposed to be the ones with good jobs
Hot Spitta, that nigga, I'm a hood star
83 Cut dog, that's my favorite hood car
Corner pocket uptown, that was my favorite hood bar
Pass me that chopper, I'll show you what it's good for

[Verse 2 - Willie the Kid]
Uh, this Willie the Kid
My nigga Curren$y man
Young Money
AMG
Fuck with me
Willie the Kid with the slick lines, these wack niggas
I make 'em fans when I spit mines, relax niggas
Paralysis, bullets hit spines
Cash analyst, expand money like six times
Catch me on the vogue time zones, I switch times
Chase Cognac with Coronas, I twist limes
Big 9 my waistline, it fits fine
My flow sublime, I gets mine, I dig dimes
Temporary plates, smoke tips on a sick whip
I'm trying to get more paper plates than a picnic
The crown prince
Cash rules, I'm addicted
Disease with the need for the cream I'm afflicted
I'm putting on a show for these Hip Hop cops
Let 'em watch, I'm top notch
Burn like hot scotch, I hopscotch
The Midwest for the currency quickly
In Muncie, Indiana when Curren$y hit me
On my way out to Kansas, outlandish
Niggas flake like dandruff, fold like pamphlets
I got a new bitch, resemble Dorothy Dandridge
Used to spit anthrax, now I'm just rancid
My nigga
