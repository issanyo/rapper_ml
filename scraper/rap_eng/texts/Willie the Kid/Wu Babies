[Intro:]
Please don't me for a reason
Feelings gone and there's nothing I can say
Please don't[Blades] ask me for a reason [pure blades man]
Feelings [nothing but blades] gone and there's nothing I can say
Yeah!

[Verse 1:]
Never mind him he never mind me
We caught it a flaw character, disregard it
Scorned like a Scarlet letter, and let everybody know upon first glance
Bound his hands and his head in a stocks route
Everybody watch smack him
Humiliated, upheld by the dual blading
Double edged, the razor sharp wedge prying
Life is hard, even harder when you not trying
Flying, unidentified object
The most complexed concept, ma conquest
A conquistador tryna conquer more
Willie, a bought a Tommy young kapor
Yankee doodle fucking southern bells
Puffin L’s shemay L all is well
Swell I never dwell
I rather see a nigga eye swollen
I don't take no breaks, semi colon
Prefer Henne no Coca Cola
But so ill like Ekola from Angola
Willie, nigga lock broke off
These niggas fold like a brochure

[Verse 2:]
Uh huh!
Ayo fuck that
I slid a nigga round in dope no joke
Seen Smokey Roberts end up on the floor
Pull a rope on these bitch ass niggas that sniff coke
Need a minute, plus in time intermission we can foke
Fuck a book throw a nigga a towel or get smoked
I’ll clap you to sell it if I have to for O’s
Drive pass you come back and harass you for doe
Time is money which everybody know
Cut your hands off now stinking by the toe
Sharper than nigga sword that nigga go let you know
I’m on the go, niggas mad ma backpacks on the greyhound
Will of all people shootback fucking lay down
No rap battles at 8 miles these fake clowns all get chop down
And Ace now protect y’all
Not all pawns on the board like connect fours
Niggers mattered in the morrow I stretch raw
Caught a nigga in the mess so I stepped off yeah!

[Verse 3:]
Ma flow catching a cold
Fix it with some [?]
Dog doing cup, of some cold water hard cause i'm stuck up all
In ma pro too
More medication for ma full dedication
For all those who’s been waiting
To see god verse hating
I might die cause my fever too high, ma head might bust
We all chilling folk
Why you gun don’t bust, yeh yeh yeh yeh you better slow down
Whip you ankle out you feet now, Whip you ankle out you feet
[Ha ha ha]
Pigeon toe mother fucker Pigeon toe mother fucker
This not happy feet, she got angry feet
This not destiny, that’s false chemistry

[Outro:]
You know what I mean
So so we we we come
We we we try to like spot out a like 5 or 10 years ahead and whatever
You know what I mean on some like
Yo we gonna be like by this time we should have this much or whatever
You know what I mean
We try to calculate ahead of time, you know what I mean
Where we can’t just mess around and just get no be oh everybody just fall off
You know what I mean where we got nothing to fall back on
You know what I mean so we just trying to get hey
And make sure we all secure for our foundation, our babies
Our family and everything
