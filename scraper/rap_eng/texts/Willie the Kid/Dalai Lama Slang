[Sample: (?)]
Yo man what ya'll punks wanna do?
We ready, y'all just name the time and the place and we'll be there
Well this is the place, and you know this the time
Let's get it on then
(?)

[Intro: Planet Asia]
What ya'll talking about really been down with this gold chain shit
Yeah yeah yeah you know that shit
Ya'll niggas is late
I got a [?] for [?] right now
You know this that
This that shit right here though
You snatch that out from him
This other shit though
You might have to pay like eleven for it
Know mean
This shit is bugged out

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Eat the nine rhyme keep your mind, I'm deep in design
Direct Desert Eagle, gun wound Dashiki grind
Chamber trained champion sweats frames is dame to dame
Sci-fi social equality Dalai Lama Slang
Shadowbox shower posse, sharpshooter in a (?)
Shalimar blasting out the Chevy
My power points up numbers, Nautica and Nova Scotia
My nine hour difference be the culture
Most notable jewels is noble to I'm holding you
Accountable digital analog niggas is coming through
Born to build, build upon real, this how we sharpen steel
The boss is here, blue collar scholar without the office gear
Set sail, the change stay wavey, word to the winners
Words of wisdom rise above all evils and all the hells of prison
And for the last bar, me and Willie like the nemesis
Double R with more speed than NASCAR

[Chorus: Planet Asia]
We a whole different strain
Swordsmen sorcery, professionally trained
With seven and a half ounces of brain
This is gold chain, Dalai Lama slang
We a whole different strain
Swordsmen sorcery, professionally trained
With seven and a half ounces of brain
This is gold chain, Dalai Lama slang

[Verse 2: Willie The Kid]
Ay yo
My minimal effort, you fuck niggas forced it
I'm from Michigan, dirty water out the faucet
Polluted like Putin
Vladimir this here you might spill fluid
I'm low key in a blue Buick
You niggas sewage, Jet Blue I flew it
Jet beauty of the week, freaks speaking fluent
The weed loud like jet fuel, they smoking Louie
While I sip Louie, Louis Vuitton, new shit
Full time job not to get niggas robbed
All my niggas goblins, coach 'em like Tomlin
I'm out of town all the time, rocking jewelry
I (?) your tom-foolery, you're fooling
Indoor pool, nigga really cooling
Richie Rich, silver spoons, bitches spooning
Never coon, undefeated like Mayweather
Talking nothing from nobody, I'm just better

[Chorus: Planet Asia]
We a whole different strain
Swordsmen sorcery, professionally trained
With seven and a half ounces of brain
This is gold chain, Dalai Lama slang
We a whole different strain
Swordsmen sorcery, professionally trained
With seven and a half ounces of brain
This is gold chain, Dalai Lama slang

[Outro]
W.T.K., Planet Asia
Apollo Brown on the 1, 2

Dalai Lama Slang
Y'all know
