[Talking]
Word I ain't even know they were cousins man, what?
Yeah, pass me that Remy


[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
Liver and onions, my schlong come between cousins
Blood is thicker than water, let them hoes fight
Now how delightful, pure as the driven
Drove every beamer, drive freak bitches crazy
My drive, count the money piles at the pow-wow
Penetrate the pussy, rap shit, put a towel down
Niggas on they minces, me I'm not convinced-from the trenches
Sex in random sequence with wenches
Women love it like free drinks, thirst quenching
It's heart wrenching, for tension, their eyes squinting
Mention me they might let you in the venue
While I be low-key sipping Malbec, suede menus
Copping leather from Crete, Dubai Gold District
Strict discipline, plenty pair of Polo chinos
Pleasantries, plant trees for the mezzanine
It's pleasant, rosemary feasant, feta cheese
Jeans frayed like a peasant, throw confetti
Bitches frolic in the meadow, I made the feddy
Comfort, confront niggas fronting fraudulent
Sipping Don in Milan, my shit be marvelous
Get you fingered, no fingerprints
Prissy chicks take initiative to sit amongst us, play the bunker
Legal tender for dinner, suppress the hunger, shit
Fresh like a mint sprig you prick it's Willie
