[Intro]

Stay on that cold shit
Watch who you roll with
Keep your mind on your figures
And your fingers on the trigger


[Willie the Kid]
I rock the 'D' had like Doughboy did
I'm splittin bitches splendid
I'm spendin dollars at the Spinnaker
Apple cider vinegar
You can't convince me
The scent indicated indica
King senses
Silk scarf came from India
I'd rather fuck a Joslene than Irene India
I'm superficial
Sue me
Play the Ocean like George Clooney
Casino
Clams Casino
I see C-Notes
Vanilla notes in my Chardonay
My naysayers
They saying never while they favorite rappers do the Ne Ne
My neighborhood The Wire
Cause every name it ain't no WeeBay
And every bitch and no Bae niether
They knew my name
My name this nigga ringing at Nordstroms
I'm pullin foursomes
Three whores at Four Seasons
Pour some Riesling
Put your arm in a sling
My nigga sling dope
Fuck per diem
You see em
Japanese denim
I never lived it
I'm a live it beloved believe it
I need Bulimis in Belize
Cheese Blitz
Bulletproof Beamers
Bullet shells fingerprintless
One blink and its complete blackness
Apprentice
The crown prince TCP
It's penicillin
Bitches peal they clothes off
You fallin off

[Royce the 5'9"]
I am the end-all be-all of all beins
I am the fire the easy rider that's ridin the spirit the eye thats on top of the pyramid
All seein
G-O-D takes the day off and calls me in
Uh
I'm the race winner the straigt sprinter
The drum
Flip you in reverse like Rae Sremmurd
I'm sunk in the seat in the Benz thinking about todays dinner
Do todays dinner friend then I'm taking em out for somethin to eat
Reapin the benefits I been official Master
P of this syndicate shit
My penmanship pen and pixel
Nickle Ryan is signed M-Seal 10 fold
Grew up with a sweet tooth for Kim Field's French rolls
The Facts of Life is this toolie just wants your folks dead
Word to Tootie we turn students to coke heads
Your girl's studious maximus glutious I sieze her
And take her back to Julius word to Max Julien
The briefcase handcuffed to my left arm
You like a joke recycled dope
When you was younger
You was up under the microscope
Now you stepped on
Like if I kicked my girl out
Ever car in my name for that reason
I groom her well
I teach her every time of year is Neiman Saks season
She act up I leave her on the clearance rack at Bloomingdales
Now she's in the market to hang with marks who ain't doin well
And before I'm fake I'd rather get no cake
I been this way
Since me in La was in the Lexus in the front of the Ebony Showcase

You know where I come from
I stay on that cold shit
The OGs told me watch who you roll with
Watch them niggas
Watch them bitches
Keep your mind on the figures
And your fingers on the trigger

Niggas know where I come from
I stay on that cold shit
The OGs told me watch who you roll with
Watch them niggas
Watch them bitches
Keep your mind on the figures
And your fingers on the trigger

Keep your mind on the figures
And your fingers on the trigger
