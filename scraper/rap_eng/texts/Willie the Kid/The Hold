[Verse 1: Willie The Kid]

From where it start
Till the flight depart
The author, the blind archer
Chicks coming out of camisoles
Camel-toes, ten toes I stand
As opposed to surrendering
And suffer on land
Shorty loyal like Camille Cosby
Plant chamomile, calamine lotion
It feel wobbly, turbulence
I deplane then adjust
I'm just contrasting and justifying
Juxtapose, enough posing
My impulse I'm playing possum
Summertime time-pieces
Niggas, sometimey
Watch em, I sip Champagne
And go shopping, Let's talk shop
Under chandelier's a mere option
Cop Dodsons, antique from the auction
Cut Cigar caps, double gullotines, Waltzing
I walk the long way home
Honing in on my poems
Humm a couple hymns to myself
Self-worth. I'm gone..
I can't condone what these niggas doin'
I can't complain either
Flights out to Argentina
I've seen enough to know enough
When enough is enough
You can't block my puck
I'm on the cusp with a cup
Stanley. This ain't hockey
But I'm ice-cold. Figure-8's
My Sixteens is quite bold
Behold, the most excellent of word usage

[Verse 2: Willie The Kid]

No discussion, only repercussion
I reap the benefits, the lear lean like Robotussin
Over-flustered, fluctuating like a fan-base
The Black Rembrandt
Branch out, sketch a landscape
Rosemary on the lamb shank
You niggas shaky
Shaking hands, throw bands
She dance to Achy Breaky
Broken-hearted artist starving
Out of former union
Unity, you better off
Watch Petunias blooming
It costs more to pretend
Niggas too timid
Intimidating temporary plates
I need motives
Debating never, sipping Jameson
Egyptian bitches, hieroglyphic how I script it
Sculpted in the image of a menace
So menacing, niggas been miniscule
Scan 'em like a scute number
Visioning Aquariums
Jewels I'm wearing 'em
Acquired taste, I'm preaching to the choir
Wired to a higher place
Replaced passion
Complacent, not a inkling
My bitches shimmy in sheer shirts
Binge drinking. Cashmere Curtains
Earn my money early
Bamboozled on stage
Nigga, show your pearlies
White Remy,
Plenty bitches at my tight and curlys
Best friends, Laverne & Shirley
For sure nigga
