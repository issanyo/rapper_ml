[Verse 1: La the Darkman]
Yeah, I rock different color forces, cherry and mango
Different color whip collection look like a rainbow
Sometimes I push the Benz, sometimes the Range Rove
Standard, the luxury, they can't figure my angle
But they know that I get dough from the way that my chain glow
Diamonds get 'em on my dick, I could snatch your main ho
Far as the flow, I'm like a Ferrari Testaro'
When I hit the gas on that ass, nigga I'ma blow
Sorta like Russell Crowe, smooth and on the low
Getting money trying not to let nobody know
In and out of state, with that weight, bag it up, get that cake
Pray for every trip, I get there safe
If I don't believe I'll be stuck in a jail space
So I move with urgency, but at a snail's pace
With God's grace, I keep getting checks like Mase
When it comes to hip-hop, I'ma be the new face

[Chorus x2: La the Darkman]
Everybody want a piece son when the money comes
Some are smart with it, some are just dumb
Niggas will try to kill you just to get a crumb
But I'm from the hood, so I bust my gun

[Verse 2: Willie the Kid]
Eh-yo, when it's time in Chi-Town I'm on my way
Magnificent mile to spend a lil' something
I'm pimping hard out in Detroit
Catch me in Greek Town, Casino style I'll win a lil' something
Sike , nah, I don't gamble
I scramble the top floor renaissance overlooking Windsor
Watch the sunset, next morning shoot the summer set
Cardiar store where they overlook pretenders
It's Coney Island, I don't need no McDonald's
Back to the Chi, yo I need G.O. Donalds
Shoot to the roof, nigga home sweet home
But ain't shit sweet at home
Except the chicks, pretty mamas who accept this dick
I fuck a nigga's baby mamma with the high school with
They know Willie been fly, there's no Benny Highners
I'm b, p, and t, purge baskets you bastards
I got it mastered, midwest's best
Dirty south transplant, up town nigga
I'm frequent flyer, I won't stop nigga
You know how I get down, I get around

[Chorus x2: La the Darkman]
Everybody want a piece son when the money comes
Some are smart with it, some are just dumb
Niggas will try to kill you just to get a crumb
But I'm from the hood, so I bust my gun

[Outro: La the Darkman]
The honorable La Trafficante, man
You know what I'm saying? Fucking with my nigga, J-Love
You know what I'm saying? Yo; this shit out on the streets [?]
