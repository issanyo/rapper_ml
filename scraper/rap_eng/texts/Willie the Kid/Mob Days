[Verse]
I fell in love with the process and shit got easy
That's overstanding, ever since it made more sense to keep it safe, disk us
I stay planning, I stay planning
Cause ain't no pinching in rap
Nothing cool about niggas trying hard, tell 'em cool
Catch me in the [?], pullin' like Fela-Kuti
Good fella, diamond cut you [?]
I never eat [?], this too snooty
You sloop for this slack joy, yo, 'cause you loco
My vocals resonating global
I stay humble, money comin' in, comin' out, accumbling
My career so consuming I'm wondering
It's a one way, monday like a monday until one day
My day with destiny, I'mma see, oblivious to this shit
Until the city set the seas and decease
A nemesis ran it back, right back
It's natural, I just keep like that
Well that a reason clooty, you niggas coolers
I exclude myself, voluntarily
I'm never tied, I'm over certain shit entirely
Nowadays it take a lot to expire me
Momentarily I get a moment
To break shit down until I'm zoned

[Chorus]
Don't be mad, nigga, don't be hating
Don't be talking bad, look for motivation
I'm looking good, feeling even better
I'm doing good, nigga, whatever
Don't be mad, nigga, don't be hating
Don't be talking bad, look for motivation
I'm looking good, feeling even better
I'm doing good, nigga, whatever

[Outro]
Fuck, fuck this...
