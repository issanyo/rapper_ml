[Verse 1 S-Class Sonny]
Yeah
Uh
S-Class (whispered)

Future of the game, and it's big pressure
Benz Kompressor, same color as lemon pepper
Interior iodized, chinchilla pepper
All these niggas falling off
Think they really lepers
All superior strategists who I build with
Attack them from the weak side like a will blitz
Every meal's sacred like we're eating gilda fish
We're balling for real
You niggas Miličić
I ain't feeling chicks
They're all heartless here
All they do is chase sacks like Demarcus Ware
Embassy
We're America's team
Kush bales, brick sales, America's dream
Wrapped tight, cellophane plastic on the coke
And a flow that be sicker than Magic's results
Positively the best, in the Lexus reclining
More dangerous than drunk texting and driving
Gucci loafers exclusive, call them next years
If you ain't talking dough, it's falling on deaf ears
Helen Keller
I don't see these niggas
TCP & Nazareth
We're feeding niggas

[Verse 2 Willie the Kid]
I said, uhm
Pull it off like a mask when the caper's finished
Swordfish, lemon butter sauce, with the capers
Willie two-times
I get-the-papers, get-the-papers
My abnormal rapport, my normal nomenclature
Rare form for the art form
Cold like the Netherlands
Sever hands of a thief
Hawthorne
Bitches playing nurse
For a purse
I disperse worth
Sweet like a Werther's, Original
In intervals
I count the money
Hundreds with the hundreds
Fifties with the fifties
Twenties with the twenties
Preserved like a mummy
Willie the Kid
Renaissance Man
Amazing Poet
Sipping Chimay with some jezebels you probably go with
Jacuzzi bubble
Terry cloth
Ralph Lauren slippers
I'm debonair, a souvenir from ocean and for dinner
It's simply ravishing
Ocean waves crashing in
Cash in these chips
Take sips of Jameson
Amazing blade welder
I'm Cecil Fielder in the field
I don't field niggas
Willie Lynch rich
House niggas verse the field niggas
Porsche panorama engine
Purring like a panther
Well-versed
Every line, every stanza
We're shooting like Bonanza
Niggas kissed the canvas
Wait
That's all I've got Bronze

[Laughter]
