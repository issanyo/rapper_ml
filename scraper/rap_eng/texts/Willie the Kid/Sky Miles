[Hook]
We came to take you higher
And higher, and higher, flight

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Ninja Turtle marijuana, cut it down
Leonardo's katanas, we in town
Found with hoes around us, dirty rotten scoundrels
Twisting up seedless quarter-pounders
Yeah I party, bitch never seen a flounder
She working at the Gap folding jeans on the counter
Niggas lounging, wood panels on the wall
Like the inside of them late 70's housing
Nigga, I'm Mitchell and Ness, vintage flow
OG, no retro, grab a nugget
Pack a bowl, that's Super Tecmo
Chivel es dough, shut the door bitch, let's go

[Verse 2: Willie the Kid]
In my new car, going like I'm too far
Money show truly who you are
Whether you a star or a shooting star, a shooting star
So you want to spar with a southpaw, get your jaw draw
I got a bitch like the black Zsa Zsa Gabor
And she could pull a chick faster than I could pull
In Acapulco, pouring shots of tequila
She bought her friend, I brought Curren$y, he bought the reefer
What up Spitta? We buzzing like a transmitter
These niggas bitter, slipping like a transmission
I'm Brita, spring water with the flow
Break the bank like it's brittle, brush money like bristles
Official, a root canal, bicuspid
I'm on the cusp of these bucks, not a husband
But I'm in love with the money fuckin' lusting
Long like the hair of Rumpelstiltskin, I'm Teddy Ruxpin
Hold my grizzly, Willie gets busy
The fly Jet Life insure Met Life, right?
Hot Spitta with me, never a Dull Moment
