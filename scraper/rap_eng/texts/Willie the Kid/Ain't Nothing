[Verse 1 Boldy James]
I'm from Detroit so I represent
For my ConCreatures
We're a force to be reckoned with
Come up shorter than a midget
On his knees
No weave, but the 40 got extensions
Long as them pigeon toed project bitches with the bowed legs who old men is locked up in prison
Or he either got laid out
Who sell dope, do hair, and babysit out of the same house
So the police don't know when to raid
O.T. on the low, keep getting paid
In full
Plus she got crazy pull
She know every drug lord in the whole entire neighborhood
Bitch touching real chips
Quick to let me know if it's straight up
Or some stepped on bullshit
My full metal jacket
I'm Mr. Goodwrench
Let's get ratchet, but don't forget the good sense

[Verse 2 Willie the Kid]
So I pull up in the beamer right
Fresh off my flight on a rainy night
Had the Agassi's on
It's sirens
Blue and red lights at the nightclub
It's drizzling
Welcome back to Michigan
Cherie, she running up
Tapped my window
I had my little brother with me
Looking like she's crying when I rolled it down
She simply
Told me Little Jay from around the way
Got into it in the club, with some niggas
Over nothing
Started busting
Fucking up packs
He used to do that
A fool as nigga
Talking too much
Switching up cliques
I mean it figures
Little niggas pulling out guns
What you said on the Facebook?
Proud to be a crook where I'm from
Shit it's never fair
Shake or be shook
Put a rose on your grave
Or some cash on your books
I'd rather get fly
Count money with a bitch
She get high
While I sip the Remy
Weed smoke in the sky
I tapped my brother like
'See Cherie talking about your man
Lil niggas got it fucked up
It's real, but understand
All it takes is one bullet
Weak niggas scared enough to pull it
Don't be somewhere, you probably shouldn't.'
It's real

The land of the brave
The home of the gritty
Ain't nothing fair when you're living in the city
(Repeat 3x)
