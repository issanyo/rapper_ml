[Intro]
Foreign cars in my neighborhood, yeah
The paper good, yeah
My niggas on TCP
Real estate acres
I'm either around money, yeah
Or I'm around some love, yeah yeah yeah
Most times both, yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
I forgive, I don't forget though
Friend or foe, the foe shit gettin' love, like it's real
Way before the fuck, shit I hate to break the news
But you can never break the seal, solidified
Slidin' in a five fifty, nothin's free
Everything is incentivized, pay the fee
Crime pays but the overhead
Is puttin' certain type of nigga over the head
I overheard somethin' at the bank
I would've never heard hanging around niggas
The talked about this and that, a bunch of nothin'
The same old same, you in some bus bluffin'
And then they mad when you start movin'
Provin' everything you said is what we doin'
Do well, let the work speak
Emotions are distractions for the weak
Only the strong prolong
If you somewhere you don't belong
It won't be long before you level up
Or maybe fall down, things are settled up

[Bridge]
The same fools rush in
Foreign cars in my neighborhood
My bitch bad but the paper good
Dealer plates, my niggas on papers
We want it all, real estate acres
Foreign cars in my neighborhood
My bitch bad but the paper good
Dealer plates, my niggas on papers
We want it all, real estate acres
Foreign cars in my neighborhood
My bitch bad but the paper good
Dealer plates, my niggas on papers
We want it all, real estate acres
Foreign cars in my neighborhood
My bitch bad but the paper good
Dealer plates, my niggas on papers
We want it all, real estate acres

[Outro]
Yea, TCP
And rap music
The license to ill
License lounge
Yo we loungin'
Foreign cars through the neighborhood
My bitch bad, nigga
The paper good, nigga
We want it all, nigga
You unknown
You fly
