[Verse 1]
Ice cold water, Willie nice, Molson Ice
Malt liquor, never sip a Mimosa no ice
Real ice up in my chain
Moissanites are Manti
Blind your cornea, no zicronium
Cubics
Rubik's Cube, you can't figure out a nigga like me
You might doubt, but dead wrong you more than probably might be
The fly persevere, duffle luggage leather
They clear Ray Bans, Monclers then your feathers ruffle
Farewell to all the fraudulent
My heart frost bit
And Smitten what a litany
These sneaks Tiffany Blue
New Benz kidney bean burgundy
I know you heard of me
Sipping burgundy in Hamburg, Germany
Danke schoen, damn shame The Fly 3 on the way
Bitches in their underwear, the Bose and glacier bay
Glasses of water, the world bring glasses
My niggas dropped out of school, the hood became classes
Salute the real for a change, call the fakers out
We celebrating on the boats 'till they take us out
Drank a Stout then a Pilsner
Peeling paper back like a sticker never stuck
Willie been a stickler
Tutankhamun furniture, the jewels Amadeus
Spend a day off the grid in the Himalayas
Lay it up in the winter
Moms in cashmere and Denim
Bitches never front
I need my trunks in the front
Elephant skin, swimming trunks, private Jacuzzi
Pocket full of money, crib full of floozies
I'm trying to be the black Bill Gates
Will not the Fresh Prince, but I will fill banks
