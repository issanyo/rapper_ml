Ayo son check it out, man
Remember that nigga with your boy?
With the work, with the bricks and all that man?
Hold on, with the 13 joint? With the 13K?
Nigga!
He got it bro, I seen, wanted the weight
Alright, so lets get this team together
Fuck that, we need this bread nigga
Go in there and bust these niggas
Hold up, call K, and Luke
Let's get these niggas dog
Let's go
Hey handle your business, the correct way though
Let's knock the living daylights out these niggas
And get this cake
Bring that fire back

[Singing]
Whenever a day goes by that I don't hear the sound of the hunter's gun
Whenever a night goes by that I don't hear the sound of the siren scream

[Verse 1 Willie the Kid]
Taught him everything he knows from how to roll a blunt
To cook cocaine
To break his Glock down to pieces
Absentee father, his big brother, became his life's thesis
A reference, wide-eyed
His mother consulted the reverend
Revered in the hood amongst other adolescents
Misguided
Oblivious to certain lessons
He don't give a fuck, turn that trap music back up
Polo everything
Fuck school
Educated on the corner
Driven by the paper
Specialize in petty crime
Nickel and dimeing
He overheard his brother talking
About some niggas on the north, niggas shining
Trained to be a spot rusher
It's all verbal though
In actuality he never let his gun off
Ran off
Told his little man about the plan
Trying to beat his big brother to the chase
Just to make him proud
Sipping Henny straight
All he smoke is loud
He's nervous
Headed to the other side of town
Him and his man masked up, kicked the door down
Screaming 'Where the money at? Nigga where the work at?'
Unexperienced, when the shots flew, he caught two
Laid dead, his friend shot, he pulled through
Misguided, mistaking bullshit for treasure
His mother
Blamed his older brother
Forever
The Guilt
