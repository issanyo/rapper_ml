I said ummmmm
I like them fertile, like the fertile crescent
The crescent moon, moonshine, divine evanescence
All black like the essence fest, I'm festering
Feathers, (Missing Bars), my money comes invested
The monkey shines, fine china wit my name upon it
Pondering, wondering, we remain the wonderfulest
So fill it up till it runneth over, so fulfill it
Prepare a hundred dollar bill, just trying heal my ills
I'm spilling Jameson, naming the famous cities I've been
I lay my hood fame to kinfolks to run up a bin
Bitches frequent, I'm current, never been delinquent
(Missing Bars), Holistic, I get the loot relinquished
Pay me, yeah, pay me like it's obligated
The gated cribs, new beamers, the shit get complicated
I made it work then I made it work for other niggas
Selective amnesia, they vaguely remember

Remember from where it started to where it's at to where it's going
Forward, never back, yeah, from where it started to where it's at to where it's going
Forward, never back, yeah, from where it started to where it's at to where it's going
Forward, never back, yeah, from where it started to where it's at
Going forward, never back

Yeah, puff cigars on the balcony, the background music soothing
Two masseuses maneuver, Maroon BM, be in museums
Suede tim's with a pretty chick, so cultured
Michael Bolton but the herbal quotes I wrote provoking
Poker faces, smoking aces, a broken token, appreciation
I make them waves, wayfarers, Ray-Bans, Ferragamos
Precipitation is unlikely, I'm likely, (Missing bars)
Enlighten me, tell me something I was never told
From the beginning to where we at, we just beginning
Infinite, most definite forever winning

Remember from where it started to where it's at to where it's going
Forward, never back, yeah, from where it started to where it's at to where it's going
Forward, never back, yeah, from where it started to where it's at to where it's going
Forward, never back, yeah, from where it started to where it's at
Going forward, never back
