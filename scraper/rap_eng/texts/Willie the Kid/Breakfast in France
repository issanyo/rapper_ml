[Verse 1 Willie the Kid]
Money dance and I'm advanced
Breakfast in France
Never back glance
I look back for nothing
Anything goes so keep something on your stomach
To withstand the disgust, discuss it over hummus
A fungus among us
Humungous
Will turn to whoremongers in abundance
Distrust
Trust me I see clear
Clean slate
Ate where the kings ate
Black queens in my king sized bed
Bedfellows
Rare pillows
Pop it in your spring lake
Pasta pillows (?)
I pair the most appropriate wines
You niggas seem fake
The bitches acting realer
Real niggas
There's plenty of us
Less is more, less is more
Money involved in many of us
Switch sides get forgetful and can it be?
That it was all so simple
Simply put
Put your heart and your soul in your goals I was told
Now I'm toasting around the globe

[Chorus Kyss]
Sipping momosas
Make the toast
From little ghetto boys to the ocean coast
Breakfast in France celebrate, the game's won
And we won't forget where we came from
Where we came from
Where we came from
And we won't forget where we came from

[Verse 2 Willie the Kid]
A thinking man's raper
I write for real niggas with ambition
Foreign car lovers, two steps from the kitchen
Articulate and speak clear
Confirming they position
Two steps from corporate
My mind is in the orbit
Orgies in Orleans
Electric orange Corvette
40 b's Gortex
Texting back home
Though it's early
Montclair logos on my coat show
Shopping in Mont Saint
Sightseeing in Paris
My Grand Rapids merit
Used to play the terrace
A few chicks from Ferris
Ready for the world
And yet nothing could prepare us
Transitioning
Sending money to my family
Popping champagne on the canopy
Came a long way from a stairway
Staring at the jewelry in the window
Now it's ocean breeze when the wind blows
Blue crab scramble
Fresh squeezed orange juice
Serenade, horns, flutes
Young black boy from the midwest
I Did more to get less
Some more chances
Now it's breakfast in France
Understand this sh---
Yeah...
(Glasses clink)

[Chorus Kyss]
Sipping momosas
Make the toast
From little ghetto boys to the ocean coast
Breakfast in France celebrate, the game's won
And we won't forget where we came from
Where we came from
Where we came from
And we won't forget where we came from

No we won't forget
No we won't forget
We're having breakfast in France
No
We won't forget where we came from
Where we came from
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
No we won't forget
