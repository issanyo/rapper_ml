[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
Stay afloat, new boats, Hublots
Blue flame, butane, a few hues
The view beautiful, new hoes, infuse bourbon
Cigar burnin', Hermes, my newest burden
Yellow Nuvo, David Yurman shower curtains, conversin'
Bitches nestle, steer the vessel
Yellow diamonds shimmer like the ocean surface
Enjoy dinner by the pier, cuisine Turkish
Marina, this white sand what a souvenir
Lakefronts, niggas fake as Lumineer veneers
A luminary, a visionary, narrow-minded niggas need to not...
Nevermind, I'm a navigator, follow quadrants, I never squander
Or wander about aimless, you niggas proud to be shameless
And that's the problem, my squadron, Lake Michigan, sport fishin'
Or Reeds Lake Lacoste down, coffee brown-black shades
Waves crash, save cash
Matured money, age fast, fast money but the yacht slow
Yacht masters, braised bass
Not a state, a peninsula, it's Michigan
Nothin' sweet, no insulin
Intimate nights, take the boat to the flight
The Fly 3 comin'
Intimidated? You should be, behold the horror
My flow water, rap wise, I'm like, penny wise, copper foamposites
Penny, Penny's
Never penny pinch, paid a pretty penny for the image
Not a blemish, epitome, my kindred spirit
Drinkin' spirits, drive German cars, I'm driven
Pick 'em like geraniums, germane to every issue that I've been in

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
So here's another miracle as I live out Jesus's parables
Life is funny, hysterical
They say it's lonely at the top
Compared the air up here is unbearable, make it hard to breathe
Trapped in our dreams, so it seems, it make it hard to leave
Shackled to my own thoughts so every track's an onslaught
That'll one day set me free and leave me where I need to be
That be that optimistic airy shit, scary shit
The same hard-headed way a thinkin' that'd be the one that I get buried with
City on my back, the only one strong enough to carry it
City where death is comin', now look how close the cemetery is
We don't wanna make waves or end up where they make graves
A mentality we can't change so we just try to maintain
By maintain, that just means we all remain tame
The world is crazy and the goal is to remain sane
Don't think outside the box, they want us to remain plain
They ain't gon' be happy til we all sharin' the same brain
College is artificial, knowledge used for profit
To fatten the institutions while all we still end up jobless
That's how they got us, like milk and honey was promised
With a degree you ain't shit, and you really ain't shit without it
Look, not to offend anyone who didn't turn the tassel
But I grew up in a home where them loans turned to a hassle
Before the debt is gone they want to go on and get their Master's
It's a distraction
Cause life's not a job, it's what you should master
Who do we follow if not ourselves?
Do we not ourself?
At a nine-to-five workin' to make wealth for somebody else
No matter what I been through, I'm a continue
Cause when shit gets deep I gotta swim too
