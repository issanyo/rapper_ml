[Verse 1]
Ladder of success, my excellence is a matter of finesse
Festive, next I'mma look inside mine
Some say the flesh ain't strong enough to climb
Towers of the shrine but the powers of the mind
Unlimited temptation to take a shore
Out to the sea many men fell aboard
Loose floorboard in the currency of forgiving
Face down I'm incapable of swimming
Money for my niggers champagne for the women
Japanese denim I'm damn glad you could send them
Willie, Willie I'mma just earn the....
Cursed with the gift to give a fuck but I'm learning
Earning while I'm waiting, waiting while I'm learning
Turn I'mma turn over new me is for certain
Certainly believe I could be the same person
Cursing toast ahead chef
Laugh with the major D leave a big tip for the waitress
Anxious pulling chinchillas out
Outside my comfort zone zoning
Watching new options
Shopping chicks who inherit yachts, mariachi
Bands expand and form atlantes
Understand later but a cross headed B
Be another soul lost at sea

[Chorus]
Sink or swim, you'll never find me
The way I drown in you, I'm gone
Lost and alone, you come to me, in my last dreams
I scream, oh oh

[Refrain]
I'm lost at sea (Scream, oh)

I'm lost at sea, I'm lost at sea
I'm lost at sea, I'm lost at sea
I'm lost at sea, I'm lost at sea
I'm lost at sea, I'm lost at sea

[Verse 2]
Smooth sailor new car fish tailor
Pretty chick misbehaving, grand hating save it
Couple dimes for a rainy day
Enjoy the day shore ride the pain away
Sea shore where the sea shells vary
And many men washed up trying to bury
Emotions drown them on hard liquor
Or you could stick to your virtues do remember
Do turn to simple time the summertime
And I'll be fine sipping red wine winning down
I'mma self surround it but I'll ground it
Keep it down that chick I just wanna check
Enough respect to wear diamonds on my neck
And you can keep all the shit the hoopla
Farewell faring free
Niggers for anything I'm forever me
When you feel like the fliest you could ever be
Be mine for the cost that be
Be another soul lost at sea

[Chorus]
Sink or swim, you'll never find me
The way I drown in you, I'm gone
Lost and alone, you come to me, in my last dreams
I scream, oh oh

[Refrain]
I'm lost at sea (Scream, oh)

I'm lost at sea, I'm lost at sea
I'm lost at sea, I'm lost at sea
I'm lost at sea, I'm lost at sea
I'm lost at sea, I'm lost at sea
