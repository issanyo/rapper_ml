I said uhm

[Verse 1 Willie the Kid]

Sipping Caf√© au lait
Hold the flute by the stem
Simply OJ
Mix it with the gold bottles
My role models ride Rolls Royces
Puff hand rolled cigars at the grotto
Cold oysters
Never too busy to get fresh
I'm boisterous
I keep your bitch moist
I'm poison
Anoint the clit
Willie the Kid's flow
Sharper than stalagmites
I'm never stagnant
Stagger off the jet
Wipe the smile off your face
I don't do a lot of joking
Pop champagne
My niggas do a lot of smoking
Smuggle everything
We're from that low budget area
Plan to land choppers on aircraft carriers
Straight to the dock
Got returns on my stock
Come
From a good stock
Pink stains on my smock
I'm an artist
Regardless
All my niggas hood though
Charming young man
I could bag Lisa Kudrow
Least we ain't fold, sell our souls, or sell each other out
And that's more than I can say about most of ya'll
Doubt is all mental
Grimier than kraut flow (?)
Sicker than the gout
Fundamental
And I don't give a fuck about none of ya'll
Just have that money right
I'm a clean nigga
I like my house clean
Like my bitches clean
Keep my car clean
Keep my son fresh
Food in the pantry
Bookshelf full of books
Niggas can't be
Fucking serious
Shit is hilarious
Delirium

[Verse 2 Sha Stimuli]
Delirium
Yeah, Look
Pastor, preacher
That's strapped with ether
You rapping divas
I can't compete with ya'll faggy features and happy feet
But I smack your teeth with the back of heaters
My tracks are deeper
Bitch I spazzed on beats
Since I had a beeper
Matter fact, I had a trapper keeper
A pre-teen
I dispersed my hurt
Now I don't just bury my foes
I make them turn in dirt
Observe my thirst
As my over-wordy verse will murder jerks
I'm at your door like it's October 31st
Trick!
No mask on, or costume
Animated nigga
Not a cartoon
This is for my block goons
Corny boys, heat holders, Glock popping G's
From the killers seeing death to the dudes watching Glee
I got them
I'll be going in
You don't even got to see me like blowing wind to know i'm a blow and win
I flow and grin cuz this shit is just crazy simple
Like stealing a baby's Skittles
Ya'll ain't fucking with me
Look
I rhyme with ease
I combine with beats
Like I'm siamese
God defined a freak when designing me
So any label signing me
It's like you let a live disease
Inside the streets
I blind the weak
I'm spreading it virally anytime I leak
And I don't comment on nothing
I let my progress speak
Now that ya'll have found me, the game's over
Hide and seek

[Verse 3 Sean Price]
Yo
Pau the chest basher
Raw the skin clapper
Sean Price (P!!!)
Allah's best rapper (Yes!)
Touch the mic when I get off the stage
And get beat the fuck up when you get off the stage
The rage
I control is civilized
The gauge, I am known to kill a guy
I don't know about you
But I'm well known homes
And I don't know about you
Asia, Africa, Tokyo, Japan
My razor slash your okydoke with hands
Cock the skit (?) and blam the cannon
I'm old school like mock necks and Chandra Barren (?)
Truth be truth when I step in the booth
And my son's got talent
Call him musical youth
Haha
But don't pass the dutch
I'm professional so when I'm finished pass the bucks
Motherfucker
