[Willie the Kid]
Its ceremonial, non testimonial
A test to my greatness, harmonial

Musical, car service swerving thru the traffic
Half drunk, fresh as a fuck, Im a maverick

Chilling with my Cali bitch, hot enough to calibrate
Her caliber, burning off calories, she masturbate

Just bought the calico, I ain't even load it yet
Think before I answer, living life, no regret

No sweat, mink on, Ralph Lauren sweater vest
No name shades on, bought 'em cause I liked 'em

Better yet, let me call some hoes up, bubble at the W
Bubble bath, shorty said they coming thru

Live at the bar-b-q, Willie, Im a young Nasty Nas
It ain't hard to tell, Big L in camouflage
Im a renaissance man, sip Chimay at the tavern
Funny as niggas got me laughing

Bask in the glory, sorta like Moses in the basket
Burying the hatchet, casket, cask and cream

Type of smooth ass nigga. Im flying above
I just flew past niggas, Im aviating

Aviators, Raybans, eight to eight'n
Eight bands in 12 hours, debate pagans
The fly. No Pegasus, Pandora
Im shitting, epidurum, enigma

My stigma, the serum, candlelight visual
I burn'em, chain swingin on my sternum

I'm vigilent, visualanty in Ypsilanti
Denim jacket stay vintage
