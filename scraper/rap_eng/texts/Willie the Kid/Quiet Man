[Intro]
Yeah
Detroit Red, ladies and gentlemen
Round of applause for Detroit Red
Thank you


[Willie]
A quiet man, a party going on in my mind
It's a riot in my heart, shall I start apartheid
My patience, died in a protest and left
Nothing but insanity, me and my new girlfriend
Heading to the rally, with picket signs
Fighting for humanity
Who would've knew, it's the place where I lost it
My piece of mind, whites only on the faucets
A quiet man, a party going on in my mind
Uninvited, perhaps I'll crash it
My state of mind, from Crenshaw to crash it
Ill, ill street blues, county blues
My life, a drive-by, niggas riding, they count me in
You set trippin, but then again
I'm quiet man, a party going on in my mind
I can't sleep, noisy ass neighbors
I can't complain, hate to get evicted
My hope, came by the crib just to kick it
And brought my faith with him, I could've cried
I ain't seen him in a minute, my nigga, you slippin
A quiet man, a party going on in my mind
Not the club, no HE promotions, promoting another flyer on my whip
ATL pics, taking flicks, ain't that a bitch
A quiet man, a party going on in my mind
A celebration, for Willie he was spitting, yeah
And then my ego start trippin, and my labido had to tell him
Listen pimpin, quiet man, yeah

Yeah, Willie The Kid, Detroit Red, I said um
There's a party going on in my mind, yeah
