[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
Not to be confused with no one
Very similar to few, specialized in the blood spewin'
Fresh from [?] pool, I'm crazy gluing
Secluded, deprived myself from certain fluids
My influence, sick like the influenza
I'm fluent, fucking bitches on credenzas
Credentials, so essential [?] how niggas blew it
A marisol and all of y'all environment polluting
Saluted generals, rap niggas mop the deck
Before the five minerals, we tryna' cop a set
Private jets, no [?], I'm jet settin'
The vinyl, so many plays on a test pressin'
Then it's all over
Fade away like a crew who came together for the sake of making money
Once the money was made, blades nigga, fucking blades
Well he's sticking to the paper, papier-mâché
Play charades, the kid, no high top fade
House party, I fucked Sherane, Sydney too
I clean out what I embody like the kidneys do
Deliver, deliver freedom, what the benjies do
Marble floors, every floor, looking from the foyer
The law bathrobe, I could've been a lawyer
But instead I'mma tread upon the bigger tread
Stitch after stitch, thoroughly my thread

[Hook(x2): Willie The Kid]
Hunt the prey, make the kill
Drag him back to the cave, my niggas feast on the weak
Blades, blades nigga, fucking blades
Blades, blades nigga, fucking blades

[Verse 2: L.A.D.]
I'm cold as Michigan winter, off centered
Acknowledge, thirty-six chambers before you enter
Blades intense as a columbine trench
Embassy enterprise, numeric excellence
El Padrino, embassy Gambino
Author and director, La Tarantino
Blue [?] surprise, Boston marathon
Through the airport, guns in my carry-on
Snakes in the grass, everyday I'm on my lawn
Make a body disappear, like I hold a magic wand
Then I'm gone in my Aston Martin, weed sparkin'
Homicide chalkin', great white sharkin'
Gunnin' and huntin' money, killer bees love honey
Might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
Blades, blades nigga, fucking blades
Blades, blades nigga, fucking blades

[Hook(x2): Willie The Kid]
Hunt the prey, make the kill
Drag him back to the cave, my niggas feast on the weak
Blades, blades nigga, fucking blades
Blades, blades nigga, fucking blades
