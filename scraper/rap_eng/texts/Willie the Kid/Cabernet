[Verse 1: Willie The Kid]

Somewhere sipping a Cab blend
Catch a cab to the cabin
Camping at the Canyon
Compatible companions
Pretty women
Medicinal use for lemons
Clementines cleansing
Dinner time, Patagonia coats
Watching Michigan & Clemson
My clique popping Clicquot
Decode the G-code
You niggas clumsy
Money clumps like Oatmeal
Ill like a meal worm, The Fly
Rag and Bone jeans
Perseverer leather shit
Custom made pieces you will never get
Get your real life like your twitter life
(When) Life gets dark
Just preserve every bit of light
And be thankful
Low hanging fruit falling far from a tree
Let the winds carry the seeds
And see what it be
Meanwhile, Willie The Kid'll sip Bellinis
Fuckin' bad bitches
Counting money on a Sunday
Believe me, mediocrisy is not enough
That's why Aquamarine
Been coming soon for Six Months
Bask in the moment
For a moment
Wild like two MILFS
Muffled moans, muff-diving on it
Notice niggas never show gratitude
The car got attitude
The crib got character
Terrace altitudes
Terry cloth robes, a narrator
Narrating greatness
To narrow-minded niggas
Go figure, the real thing
Not a figurine
Fingerling potatoes
Tangerine gastrique
Strict on my lady friends
Bend over backwards
To prove worthy
Then I bless 'em like the clergy
Willie get the paper, call it clerical
Call me anything
But don't compare me
Niggas be hysterical
I take pride in being me
Paid for my parables
Very good merrigolds
Planted, every pair of jeans folded
On a Merry-Go-Round
In the walking closet, I never lost it
I mighta lost interest. Slight difference
