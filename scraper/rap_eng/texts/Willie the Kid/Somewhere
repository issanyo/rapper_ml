[Intro]

Victories, man
It's so sweet that
Even if i see defeat, it's so unfamiliar
I probably won't even recognize it
They say why go through Hell
Chasing something you was gonna get anyway
On your way to Heaven, you nah'mean?
You get deep but music like family matters at the heart
You start to play your part
You know what I'm sayin'?
At the end of the day
It's all about the way you respond
Your life is a reflection
Of the decisions you made in your life
The many paths you could take
But one thing's for certain
You'll all end up somewhere

[Verse 1: Willie The Kid]

My catch phrases amaze many
There's no Catch-22's to what I do
I'm doin' mine differently in lieu
Despite lewd behaviour
I'm taming the shrew.
Frosted shredded wheat, Willie
Money-making Willie
I'm peeling all manilla envelopes
No achilles tendon
My tendency to count count legal tender
Sip Martinelli's in the telly
With black Liza Minnellies
Lies, you can tell me
The truth, I'mma see it
It's one thing to want it
Another thing to be it
Be as it may, I got a wide array of talents
Paths I could take tryna find a perfect balance
Options, i opt to live without one care
Until I end up somewhere

Yeah, nigga, I ain't got one care
But I'mma end up somewhere
