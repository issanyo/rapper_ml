(Intro)
Alright, Alright
Get high, Get High
Say bye, close 1 and 2
Open the 3rd eye

(Verse 1)
Rolling up that Mary-What
I dont take no L's except
When I roll this Marijuana
Carry yah ova
Or Kyrie you over to the furthest of nova
Now im hangin like a retired jersey
Ya career over
Getting holaa, just to hover over a body thats celestial
Projected via astral, I crossover
No bottles but I hangover, the cross with a lighter of course
Then set the course ablaze and let my spirit move like its the force
Cross over the realms im heaven sent smell the Aroma
Even when im in the U.S. dicen smell it on Europa
See Europa as I breeze through the Coast-Ah
Picture me rolling the potent in Costa Nosta
Mix the elements, then i chief all the keef like I'm sosa
Till the all the weed is ova and im moving slower
But the crystal fiji flowing, this is nature that im smokingg
Close one and 2 & let the 3rd eye focus

(Hook)
"Roll one up & then I roll one again
Roll one up & take a hit from the pen
Roll one up, I do not think ill decend
But if I did can you smell it me
Im heaven sent"

(Verse 2)
Fumaa
To the cara, feel the paz
Mas, kobe widdit
Will not pass
Its gas, obi sithin
& you know
This Grass is greener on this path
Bliss pass es ignorance via brath(breath)
Purified through smoke till stress tends to eject
Like im back up in the 90s dealing with cassette
Coughin till im ina coffin you puffin that coffing you gon end up in a casket
Tell Houston that im Harden, perdona, im blasted
Its been a long day, how the kush you think I end it ?
Get lifted with my prayers, im the indicus led reverand
7 days, strength for the week, all this stress gots2get mended
Holy shizzle this got me holy, leaking sin though im feelin wholly
Circle completo like logos, completion like done loading
Escalera baja llega, by the well of Jacob, foalling
Algo ba bajando, mothers nature descended, knowing
Im in sense, smell the substance thats heaven sent
Peace of nature, smell her hair i whiff that Heaven scent

(Hook)

(Bridge/3rd Verse)
Fuma...
Fu-fu-fumaa
Me gustaa-
Gusta-
Fuma
Fu-fu-mas
Mas...
Paz like im Buddah
Tu tas mas aya
Mas aya
Fatha by
Fatha , So why
Why bother ?...

Fuck the pain, fuck the system
Fuck this job, fuck the isms
Im so sick, roll prescription
Bump the beat, feel the rhythm
Spit my spirit you can feel him
Roll that potion get to healing
Roll that potion get to healing
Theres no better feeling

(Hook)
