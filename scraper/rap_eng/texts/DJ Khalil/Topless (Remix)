[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, yeah, no roof
Live life topless, can't nobody stop this

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, this the DR., in charge of saving artists out the ER
Bring them back to life, beats like CPR
Made the westside worldwide, no PR
Gangsta rap god, I'm the end all, be all
California love, from the Bloods to the C-Dogs
The Compton monsters make you wanna cut your MP off
The greatest in the game, haters should be ashamed
For not acknowledging the brain of the west coast king
Brought Chronic to the scene, folded pills in the lean
Now the game full of puppets, look at me: no strings
Again and again I've shown, you seen me
Piss on niggas' egos, ruin they self esteem
Sky the limit, no roof, I can do what you dream
Done it all 'fore you ever did a thing, knamean?
Tees and black jeans, no bling, just bang
Officially deranged, clinically insane
Look Eazy, ain't a damn thing changed, I promise
Still live like we did back with Straight Outta Compton
Taught niggas how to have attitudes on some hood shit
Showed them what to smoke when they were blazing that bullshit
That's why you smell the drug aroma when my record play
Not a blemish on my image, decorated resume
A legendary legacy
All that I was, you'll never be, fuck is y'all telling me?
Forever on top
Face it, you'll never be better than the Doc, ask Pac
Again, I say it's never gon' stop
Face it, you'll never be greater than the Doc, ask Pac

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My motto is live by the bottle, so why is my supply low?
Bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded, but I still reach for the sky, though
Ghetto idol, I think, but what do I know?
Shit, I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Don't act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly, Muhammad Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag
West coast, the home of the body bag
The shotty, the mag, Los Angeles, where the party at?
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back, so have a cardiac
Started back with the black, Raiders starter cap
Gangsta rap, we practically fucking started that
Everyday with this game I'm getting smarter at
Sky's the limit so every time I get on the track

[Hook]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
1996, I left it all behind
'Cause I ain't got no roof on mine
I had to jump ship, I double back for my chips
My captain handle my shit
I've never been the losing kind
Grind, I feel it like it's year one
I'm a fool anywhere near square one
But ain't no glass ceilings, I crash through 'em
Ain't no coal spills, I light a match to 'em
Ain't no haters right, just say congrats to him
This is Detox, it's rehab to 'em
I bring it back years later, let it flow through 'em
Putting that Chronic in their systems like I used to do 'em
Respected so it's proven that's what I've been doing
Moving the game like weight and everybody been using
Bitch, it ain't really nothing left to say
You're tuned in to Detox, I am Dr. Dre

[Hook]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 3: Nas]
Your skin's your travelling bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab, while mine's glistenin'
Vivid on my skin, how many continents I visit then
You can journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shitting on them, your brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it, however you want it, I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit, the grind
My genetic code make up, murderer by design
On Mayan calendar time, when night meets day
I'm in the light grey Bugatti like a high speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger, the jumping rope in place
Muhammed Ali hobbies, no Pilates, try'na keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man's wife, see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward, but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, Baguette's glowing
Keep your lid, yet dawg, the private jet Boeing, topless

[Hook]
