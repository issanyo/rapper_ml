[Intro]
Ugh

[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was a minute with my grandma
I would tell her how I made it, listen to me grandma
Security wasn't workin', he failin' his job
He look at God
And I got a call from Universal like "hey this Ferg?"
But Rocky told me if them labels call just curve
I'm sittin' here like "damn Rocky you got nerves"
He got us this far so I'ma trust his word
Then [?] call me "what's up homie?
Got a deal for you like 2 mili"
When Rocky asked get money
Too much money, this half only
Two mil, two mil, I don't know
Grandma I ain't lie
Then Geno called like (?)
Got a deal for us like 3 mili at Polo Grounds
That label deal A$AP Worldwide, this shit unreal
Now we signed signed it
Grandma, now we signed it
Wish you was here to smell this air
And I could touch your pretty hair
We could talk for two more years
Push you around in your wheel chair
Momma say hi
"Hey mother, dear"
Your birthday on Christmas
And we shed a tear like every year
Celebratin' your happy years
Hopin' that your spirit clear
When (?) feel it you can touch my nose and brush your clothes
Light flickerin' from the chandelier
You see she blew that candle near
What you don't know you shall feel
But I know my grandma, I ain't scared

[Hook]
Grandma
I'm talkin' 'bout my grandma
Grandma
Grandma
Talkin' 'bout my grandma
Grandma

[Verse 2]
Grandma ain't gotta go through pain no more
Arthritis and pain and sores
Bleedin' red, they paint your gauze
Many nights you pray to God
Lord help me, I can no more, I can't endure this pain no more
What about my husband? He want more
Can't stand up cook, can't stand at all
Times I heard 'em down that hall
"I heard you down that hall"
It was times I heard 'em down that hall
"I heard you down that hall"
Don't be slick you fucked that neighbor
Tell me lies, you tell me fables
"You really think I'm stupid?"
(?) I hate you
Take advantage, I'm disabled
What about time I fixed your table
All of them times filled your naval
Coulda had a guy that fixed that cable
But I know you and I love you
Yeah I love you, you spoiled motherfucker
Fuck them other bitches sucker
Let them other bitches love ya, bitch
I'm good and know my kid love me
The only reason why I still really wanna breathe
Even though you love me unconditionally
And I understand the circumstance when it come to me
(I'm sick)

[Hook]

Grandma

[Bridge]
All I ever wanted was you here with me through all this shit
Through this life that I live, through this life that God gave me
All I ever wanted was you here with me through all this shit
Through this life that I live through this life that God gave me

[Hook]
