[Intro: Kobe and (Bun B)]
Cause them boys keep challenging me
So I'm gon' make sure I can drop em (drop em)
Load em up and cock em (cock em)
Arms out the window and aim! (I will pull it back)
Aim! (I will let it go)
Aim! (I will lay it down)
Cause them boys keep challenging me
(But there's no competition)
So I'm gon make sure I can drop em (drop em)
Load em up and cock em (cock em)
Arms out the window and aim!
Aim! Aim! Aim! Aim! Aim!
Cause them boys keep challenging me
(But there's no competition)

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Cause I am Mike Jordan, Mike Tyson, Mike Phelps
Michelangelo with the flow bro, and the mic helps
Ha! The mic stealth, that's for the mic's health
You'll take me out now that's the funniest shit, Mike Epps
They say the street need a hit, it ain't gon write itself
So I'mma set this bitch on fire, it ain't gon light itself
And I'mma beat the beat up, it ain't gon fight itself
Fucking let it write itself, until it good night itself
That's for the OG to do it
Just equip me and do
You know what we a do fool
I will pull it back
I will let it go
I will lay it down

[Hook: Kobe and (Bun B)]
Cause them boys keep challenging me

[Verse 2: Bun B]
'Cus I am Al Capone, John Gotti, Larry Hoover
Tooky Williams, Mike and sexy on, bitch I will do ya
Now when you talking do a million people listen to ya?
Or do they slip and keep it moving like they never knew ya
You born a sucker, die a sucker, yeah, you get the picture
When you go, you gon' try to take some trill niggas wit ya
Son of bitch yeah, I say fuck you for a picture
Come in to get yo head a bodybag, this shoulda fit ya
Nigga talking down in your subliminal rap
We're playing, you get slow dice
Like slit through the craps
Snap back to reality, there'll be another studio
Casually, try to battle me
I leave them rattled G
That's for the OG to do it
Just between me and you
You know what we a do, fool
I will pull it back
I will let it go
I will lay it down

[Hook: Kobe and (Bun B)]

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Staircases and aces, razor blade cameras and scrapers
Get through it big, I got the rhythm to bend cages
Choppa mad, places in front
We just stunt, you know my shakers
All of them shoot just like the Lakers
Paper fryers and Goliath, mission attired, he wired
Kill that nigga with the quick fast and tie it
Check that Houston goose and the cranberry will loosen niggas up
Quinton thought he was straight just like some moose and
Stat and Pharell busting them bow and arrows
We touch so we lowing sparrow
Chums is long and goofy like cousin Cowell
Truth or fire, dope fiends get crucified
Both teams is super loud
Me and Buns, the underworld is ours nigga
Pantries is filled with nothing but blow and scampy shrimps
Try to stop me nigga, shoot through his eyes
Blow trying to cope, copping the stove, he drove pop us
