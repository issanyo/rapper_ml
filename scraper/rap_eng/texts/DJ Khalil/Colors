He's a kaleidoscope to look in; a black men and white women
Sometimes together make exotic looking children
But mixed race kids become fixated on separating themselves from the hatred
Your grandma on the black side make you slam the station
Your grandma on the white side was educated in schools that were segregated; maybe she was racist
Maybe you can't, today, school her on some brand new today shit
If I grew up a rich boy, like this boy, this white boy, like you boy, the Christmas toys, the privileged joys
I think I'd be less stressed, the whole family at home, the ideal address
But he's dealing with self mutilation, dungeons and dragons, Ouija boards, rituals with satan
Yeah, we grew up with similar anger
