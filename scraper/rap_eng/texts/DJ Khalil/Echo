[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It seems like no matter what I do
I just can't get away from them
(Get away from what?) The voices
I can hear 'em calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
I eat rappers, with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time, I'm super human
My world is like a Rubik's Cube, it's too complex girl
You assuming, Cupid's looming, my mentality's caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman Show, all I have is music, ho
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago, so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
But you better put a fork in it if you think I’ma lay here just spooning, yo
Oh, you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful?
Diabolical to my last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core to the bone cold all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
Ever since I was 13 I learned how to sew and sewed shut my own bootyhole
'Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I’ma set this bitch on fire!
And this time I don't mean I'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
'Cause this time when I fuck this world I’ma put the whole goddamn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hole yet, I'ma go get Nickel and try to rip it wider

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Shh! Did you hear that?
I thought somebody just said something
Is there anybody there?
Classical poems, battle my own demons, I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn stabbing my clavicle bone, I'm matador prone
First time I seen a desert eagle I was letting the .44 buss, the .44 pop
The first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs, looking at Robocop
I am not a man, I'm a logo, I'm a such thang
In order to clean my veins you need Saleen, I'm never referring to the solution, I’m talking about more like the Mustang
Vroom! Get respect from the get-go, hello! Step to the echo, echo, echo
Pen got a mind of its own, got to write my rhymes with a timer
Otherwise I’ll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati, as the petrol swallows
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton, check your Bible inside it
It'll say this guy's an elephant, I’m fly like I’m killing the scene like
I’m a villain with wings, I’ll sleep when I’m 6 feet deep
Right now I’m living a dream, though we may be reckless
The ladies check us, they whisper Shady Records, baby echo!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
