[Verse 1:]
So we're going through things with changes
Are you ok, ok?
I know everything around you is changin'
'Cause of your mighty faith
You never see the next good thing comin'
'Til it's right in your face
And there's a time when the bad from the past
Seems to fade away
Now you got daughters
Now you got sons
Now you got love
You in on the south to south wall
Got yourself one
Now you feel love

[Bridge:]
They come for your dream
Come for your work
They make you mean
They make you err
They take your worth
They take your worth, your self-esteem
They make you hurt
They make you hurt, they make it seem
Like it ain't worth it, but

[Hook:]
It's always worth it, it's always worth it
You can get up (Get up and try again)
It's always worth it, it's always worth it
You can get up (Get up and try again)
It's always worth it, hey, it's always worth it
You can get up (Get up and try again)
It's always worth it, hey, it's always workin'
You can get up and shine (Get up and try again)

[Verse 2:]
So you're dealing with things, got to thinkin'
Are you ok, ok?
You know the mountain won't move
Unless you make it get out of your way, yeah
You never know you got a real good thing
'Til it's right in your way, yeah
And there's a time when the tears inside
Run down your face
Now you got vision
Now you got hope
Now you got love (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Just have to listen
Keep your eyes above
Then you'll see the dove

[Bridge:]
They come for your dream
Come for your work
They make you mean
They make you err
They take your worth
They take your worth, your self-esteem
They make you hurt
They make you hurt, they make it seem
Like it ain't worth it, but

[Hook:]
It's always worth it, it's always worth it
You can get up (Get up and try again)
It's always worth it, it's always worth it
You can get up (Get up and try again)
It's always worth it, hey, it's always worth it
You can get up (Get up and try again)
It's always worth it, hey, it's always workin'
You can get up and shine (Get up and try again)
