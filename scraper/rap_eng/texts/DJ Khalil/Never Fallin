Down
Never falling down, down, down
Ever falling down
Never falling down, down, down
Ever falling down

[Verse 1: Eligh]
Even if I was blindsided by mack trucks
In the side street, in the alley way, in a foreign city
I'd still make it back home
On a highway
No bulletins no street signs, no other cars, no radio, no satellite
I'd still make it back home
Connected to the universe like a string of lights on the holiday
If one's out doesn't mean demise of all who roam the stome
Feel the earth char with the fire water and sky under his home under his toes, under his flows, under his belt
It's the brain who sets tones
I never regret the way canals of birth shot me forth on my feet Not my fins, I am a man to finish it out
Don't forget gravity laws
Only thing keeping me from flight
Wings of space, infinite night
Down the spiral not in sight

Never falling down, down, down

[Verse 2: The Grouch]
Great there is no father
It's her and her offspring
Nobodys offering help, skin ain't softening
Acts chopped to the ankles, her babies coughing
Maybe the check will come today, the wait's exhausting
She's the pillar so, she can't be tilted
Give her sons
The feeling as though, they got a million to blow
Need no stilts to reach the stars
Teach the kids to reach with their heads
And they each will be yours
I give a piece of me for her to have a piece of mind
Or a piece of your chicken 'cause it's ramen all the time
She's thin and getting scared but she never lets on
Many men will not fall cause their mama's head strong

[Verse 3: Sunspot Jonz]
Pick your feet on up
Why dont you get on up
Lift your spirits up
Damn I know this shit is tough
I flunked in high school
My pops he left me young
I often lost my cool days, I feel my mama's gun
I lost my only son
When my girl she almost died
Had abortion haunted by a babies eyes
And every reason lies
Cause you know the truth inside
You're feeling like a coward, like the wrong person died
But still you gotta ride
Let the years pass 'em by
Never really knowing why
The questions why I'm always high

Never falling down, down, down

[Verse 4: Bicasso]
Look
We slipping and sliding
808 kick riding
Serving rocks, balling while they conquering and dividing
Teeth glistening shining
Listening to ourselves lying
Believing a bleeding ego, still trying
Identifying with the why and the whats
Self hating is the scars and the cuts that run deep down
Not giving a fuck behind the sweet sound of the new blues
Rattling the truck from the sun roof to new shoes
Chrome
Neglecting the home
Disrespecting the zone
That Sankofa should of shown us
Looking back before the times that they owned us
But never really owned a damn thing that spirit sounding like

Never falling down, down, down
Ever falling down

[Verse 5: Luckyiam]
I'm hella irresponsible, I'm possibly the cause
Of my subsequent downfall
Now a take a pause and reflect on my karma and laws
I've ignored all the signs that could cause
A turn and redirect my preferred
Course of action, before the curse of my actions
The rehabilitation of the baddest on the planet
Will set a mark, a mile stone of progress
The life changing tones of why heart and soul mean the most
Learning voices be the search and exume all my skeletons
A room full of demons where the angel was a prisoner
She's tortured for the visitors
The listeners who read between the lines
And stay inquisitive to dissect these sentences

Never falling down, down, down

[Verse 6: Scarub]
Last night I took a field trip
Kind of bent, hopped a fence
Cut across a playground and laid down in the cemetery
Reflecting on my past, present, and current events
Speech slurring venting to the moon I swear she was answering me
Not literal, but in the spiritual sense
We spoke me, myself, and I, but I wasn't alone
In fact it felt that picture of a beach with footprints and the sand
You know the poem hanging in grandmama's home
Where does love come from?
Where does it go when its gone?
What takes its place?
And why does that space turn hard as stone?
Another year I am older today
In many ways I've grown
But in my head them, them questions still they roam
Riding the bike she said its like cycling in circles
With your eyes closed
No hands blind fath is what she called it man
Said life's an ocean with a lot of commotion
Once you dive in, yeah it's deep
But if you could swim it ain't mattering
