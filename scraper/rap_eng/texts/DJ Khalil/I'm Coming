[Intro]
Yo rap is all fucked up and shit, and niggas is like
Yo, we need somebody to fix it
Somebody need to fix it, you know what I'm saying?
But you know what?
I don't fix things
I break things

[Hook]
I'm on my way
To steal the day
Turning to gold
Warm from the cold (I'm coming)
The devil is near (yeah)
I cannot hear

[Verse 1]
Rappers wanna be like me, it's stressing
They're getting a little too close like Kanye and John Legend
I'ma teach you a bad lesson
You will need Barry Bonds' steroids to match my aggression
It's a blessing, review my record
Use only periods and commas cause there is no question
I'm a walking weapon, I'm part Jimmy Henchman
Part Michael Concepcionâ€Ž, the name alone is threatening
I am more than a man, have you figured it out?
Scared Moses back up the mountain, I'm sicker than thou
Spit quicker than thou, quicker than the brain allows
Quicker than Mexican women clipping they eyebrows
I breathe smoke, never joke, I'm the illest walking
I shoot a puppy for barking, I'm an expert marksman
Lyric Jesus bout to open up his arms
Where anger is angels, pain is priests, and torture is God
I'm coming

[Hook]
The angel's here
To cast out fear
Glitter of hope
Sever the rope (I'm coming)
The devil is near (yeah)
I cannot hear

[Verse 2]
I return when the game is the softest
I don't push the envelope, I push the whole post office
Find out from Clive Davis who turned down them offers
I make the most lobsterish artist look like a crawfish
Why is my spirit down
MTV best MC countdown and my name ain't coming outta Sway's mouth
Still I'm saluted like a man of the cloth
I write my ass off so they don't write my ass off
Nah, nigga let's go, the murder molest flow
Convertible crept slow, prefer to caress dough
I heard it [?] you shot on the dance floor
You softer than damp snow, get your snow cancelled
My pen is my needle, my easel I'm lethal, leave you
In a position that's fetal in your Volkswagon Beetle
Animal type, better keep me on the leash yo
You'd rather ride a porcupine naked than fuck with Chino
I'm coming

[Hook]
I'm on my way
To steal the day
Turning to gold
Warm from the cold (I'm coming)
The devil is near (yeah)
I cannot hear

[Verse 3]
I stay pilled up, I'm developing drain bamage
I mean brain damage, put the rap game in a bandage
Only G Rap's better, let's get that established
I fell from Heaven, I'm God's dandruff
You don't want parts of the kid, I carry a SIG
I'm bout to black out like ink from a squid
They can't believe a Puerto Rican is the illest
You can't spell rap without the PR in it
I'm turning the Earth to a pillar of salt
Killer at heart, watch me turn revenge into art
I was torn from Satan's ribs, hating humankind
So when it's time to go to Hell, won't even stand in line
I can't be outshined, before the Pope died
Sent me a text message saying that the world is mine
Bottom line, I'm the only nigga strong enough
I'll be the star in God's movie til the credits rolling up
I'm coming

[Hook]
I'm on my way
To steal the day
Turning to gold
Warm from the cold (I'm coming)
The devil is near (yeah)
I cannot hear

I'm here
