[Verse 1]
Let your spirit fly high, let your spirit be free
Cause dreams are meant to come true so dream as big as you wanna be
Remember that love is sacred and happiness is the key
And if you wanna change the world then be the change that you wanna see
Make a friend of someone, someone you don’t already know
Plant a flower in the ground and watch it grow

[Chorus]
Just take it easy, take it slow
Don’t rush through life, just let it flow
Let your imagination run wild
See the world through the eyes of a child

[Interlude]
Live again
Live again

[Verse 2]
I tell you what I know, I know the world is round
And when a tree falls in the forest, I know it has to make a sound
Now why I can’t I believe in God and still believe there’s other life?
Because I bet one day we’ll all look up in the sky and see their light
Now I don’t think the world is gonna explode but it’s comin’ to an end
It’s the day we’ve all been waiting for when we get to start over again
Until then…

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Young boy, young boy, don’t grow too fast, you’ve got to make these days last
Young girl, young girl, you’re gonna want it all back when its gone and passed
Old man, old man, do you remember when you were young?
And lady, oh, lady, how do you feel now that your life is done?

[Chorus 2]
Did you take it easy? Did you take it slow?
Did you rush through life or just let it flow?
Did you let your imagination run wild?
And did you see the world through the eyes of a child?
