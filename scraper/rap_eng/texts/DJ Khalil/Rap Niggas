[Chorus]
I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two, extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga
I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle man a shooter that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two, extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga

[Verse 1]
V12s in the valley, black on black, nigga
Esse in the valley do my tats, nigga
White boy in Manhattan, pay my tax, nigga
Drive down to the Hamptons to relax, nigga
I stopped smokin' weed, then I relapsed, nigga
Traveled 'round the world, and I came back, nigga
Worth a couple a million, that's a fact, nigga
But I am nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
I own all the rights to all my raps, nigga
German plates with sheepskin on my mats, nigga
Murder rate increasin' if I snap, nigga
Ain't no hangin' out, we tape y'all off and double back, nigga
Open trust accounts deposit racks, nigga
Million dollar life insurance on my flesh, nigga
Beamer's, Benz, Bentley's or a Lex, nigga
Ferrari's and them Lambo's that's what's next, nigga

[Chorus]
I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two, extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga
I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle man a shooter that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two, extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga

[Verse 2]
AMG Mercedes, back to back, nigga
Chopper to his face, now that's a wrap, nigga
Streets talk and that's a rat nigga
Yo' P.O. call you up, look that's a trap, nigga
Beat that case, that was that, nigga
Told the world, 'Look I'm back,' nigga
Saved my deal, then I cracced, nigga
They folded, so I left, nigga
Can't no motherfucca tell me shit, nigga
We the No Limit of the West, nigga
Percy Miller at his best, nigga
Jigga with the Rollie and the vest, nigga
Acne jeans and Giuseppes, nigga
Servin' fiends off the steps, nigga
Murder sprees for the set, nigga
All facts, ain't no mothafuccin' threat, nigga

[Chorus]
I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two, extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga
I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle man a shooter that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two, extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga
