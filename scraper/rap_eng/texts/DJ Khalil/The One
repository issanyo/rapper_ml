The game was looking weak, the whole scene starved
So I came through with some Muscle Milk and protein bars
Barbells and jump ropes, Bowflexes to body it
And a couple Billy Blanks Tae-Bo Karate kicks
If you ain't Million Dollar Dreaming then we opposites
In high school I was voted the most Ted DiBiase-est
Also the most slept on, cause my Ted DiBiase-ness
An Inglorious Basterd and you looking like a Nazi, bitch
They say it's hard out here for old boy, then tell me where Taraji is
I am going so raw watch me Soy Sauce, Wasabi this
Nobu/noble on them Pro-Tools, hot as H-E- double hockey sticks
Make sure you give the chef your compliments
And thank him for his constantly great tasting accomplishments
A smiley face, emoticons if you want to remain anonymous
My retirement's on hold, I got the whole world on conference
Matchstick Man, I really have the confidence
That I'm a give them G.O.O.D Music like Common Sense and Consequence
Content that's relative across the continent
New York, Houston, Chi-Town, Los Angeles
