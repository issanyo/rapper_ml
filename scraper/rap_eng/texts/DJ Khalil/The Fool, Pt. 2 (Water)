And they were all at war over land
Thinking land was wealth
But the truth is in the water

What's up the water homie?
Know what the water showed me?
They wanna control the water
Know what the water told me?
That life begins in the water
So only this water knows me
This ocean within
I dove in it when I was lonely
Do you know the weight of water?
People don't know the depths
This ocean within me
Same waters they don't protect
While those in the know invest
We know that they don't posses it
Our hands can't hold the water
A man can't own the water
We owe the water
You know where water goes?
Which way the water flows?
See a reflection on the waters if you wanna know
Ocean within me
Lifting up to the sun and the clouds
They giving life to the earth once it's thundering down
We search under the ground
Search other planets for it
What is the water worth and how does the water work?
Beyond the thirst, your reflection on the surface
The direction of the currents, what they show
A person and a purpose below
Who you are and which way you should go

That's all anyone wanna know
Just who you are and which way you should go
That's what the water shows
Yeah
That's all anyone wanna know
Is who you are and which way you should go
That's what the water shows

So tell me, what's your water?
When do you see as clear as peering into the water?
Is it a close peer reflecting your truest image
Refreshing the truth within ya
Or is it a song?
Is it a psalm, you clear and calm?
But where do you see as deep as looking beneath the water?
Study the present tense
The currents, the present tensions
And sense 'em and swim against
Notice the slippery slope of the mainstream
That's the name of the system that floats many away
Watch the river
Those listening close know where the winds are blowing
Hear whispering in their souls
Water within the scrolls
Waves that can carry you forward
Water that gives you hope
It keeps you afloat
Whole ocean within
They don't get why I always got a grin
They don't get why I don't always gotta win
Do you know that when I walk in the sun I get chills?
There's an ocean within me
Whole life navigating in skin
It ain't a lot that can phase me
Nowadays I feel wavy
Like I'm walking on water
I wasn't trained in the Navy
But we fight for these waters
Because these waters, they saved me
All water is holy water, I bathe in it daily
Now can you tell me what the water's worth?
Or how the water works?
Beyond your thirst for it
Your reflection on the surface
The direction of the currents
What they show, a person and a purpose below
Who you are and which way you should go
That's all anyone wanna know
Uh
Who you are and which way you should go
Uh
That's what the water shows
That's all anyone wanna know
Is who you are and which way you should go
Uh, that's what the water shows


But somehow our thirst for water
Became a thirst for land
Man
We come up for some land
Ahh
Drink the sand (Caw)
Now there's a whole desert within
My whole world is a desert
And my whole world is at war
