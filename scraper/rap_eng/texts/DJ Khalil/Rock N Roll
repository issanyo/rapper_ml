[Intro/Hook: Kobe]
Hey lil mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi
You know me, I'm flying in the air like living on a bird
We're on the corner serving that rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll
Posted on the corner with the rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Willie Nelson nigga, we run flusty, crocodile hat
Cowboy rap, hammer game trusty
Diamonds on from Ghana, Boca retire in a yacht
With the middle name Lex, pop my llama
Movies get made in HD, let me get your eighty-three
I'mma scout faces so straight meetings
There's nothing you can do with my real niggas
Not the ones I rest my head with, my son a real crew piranha
Two wheels scooters, the new Rugers, floating through the Beverly Center
I count a ten up with my shooters
All these is high powered, Bob Dylan style, my niggas
Post it up, yeah frontin' at Mr. Chow's, titanium hustle, switch color
Most of them rich brothers are only on fucking and switch nuggets
Luggage is the real shit, who kill shit niggas is nothing
Blow a blunt, repeal shit

[Hook]
Hey little mama, little mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi
You know me, I'm flying in the air like living on a bird
We're on the corner serving that rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll
Post it on the corner with the rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll
Hey little mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger
Yeah, better will blast ya now take it hit of this rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, everything platinum, even my baggage
You want a platinum rock? Then go see Larry
He got the yellow hat, yellow Maxes Air, looking like me
With a yellow back, pretty long hair
Suck a dick like Karrine Steffans
With Bobby Brown on speed dial, his ex dial stay on the check-in
I got that Mickey, baby, little mama
I got the bomb, call me Tom Brady
Move like a running back, 21 Tomlinson
Know how to push it back, you should pay homage and
Shit is too potent, make you feel like vomiting
Your black/white birds can give me five like Donovan
Pop the champagne for the illest hustler in the game
I got the Pink Floyd eyes on all day
And I ain't even mention my deals yet
Cuz I don't wanna have you freaked out over this real shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
All stand up, we in the building, let the birds fly
Rock star to my heart, anything else? Uncivilised, go
Rock star like the Red Hot Chili Peppers
I can't front red tops got me feeling extra
I drop the top so I can show the stones
I got the sour so I'm Rolling Stones
I'm popping shit on my mobile phone
I never slip cause I keep the fully loaded chrome
And have my niggas even stay â€¦
That's why we pour a liquor for the Grateful Dead, we miss you
Where I'm from, it's either guns or roses
And fuck with me you need a bunch of roses
And Lord knows is keep the led zeppelin
A nigga put it then we dead ressing
You can tell a bitch is still an e
We got that white girl nigga Sheila E
Diplomats we the eagle(Killa!) we finna be greater than the Beatles

[Hook]
