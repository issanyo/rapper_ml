[Preface]
It's the return, and what I mean by return is the return to everything you love about hip hop

[Chorus]
Return... to the way we were before the influx of drugs and money occurred
Return... to the way we was before the rise of lies, fake players and thugs
X2

[Verse 1]
We bring it back now - face it
Back to the basic.  The track - Khalil laced it
I run em like Asics
Circle the globe.  Navigate my black thoughts like a king on his throne
The return: No jheri curls, crimps n perms
Crack deals, fake rappers writing rhymes on sherm
You must learn
I teach who it may concern
And keep the flame lit to make Hollywood burn
Pure righteous
We move em out like Cypress
In the belly of the beast with my group of lifers
Khalil's cuts, cold as black steel
Cause chaos in the hour of disc jock payoffs

[Chorus]
X1

[Verse 2]
Return... This nubian player shine through you
Continue the art brought to us by the Zulu
I ride the soundwave ridiculous
Omnipotent, scientific: Chace Infinite
Express my god body in sentences
Bear witness and listen to what the difference is
Vainglorious, we reached the peak
Back when rap was dominated by red, black and green
Now it seems on your tv screens
False images of caviar and champagne dreams
Each day is like a bad dream and at night?
Living baseheads celebrate city life strife
To the fullest extent
I manifest lyrics of fury
From the depths nobody can step to me
I said it on record so set it straight
I set it off, the verbal molotov, die from the verbal holocaust
Before Antoinette was the boss
I've been making average MCs take a loss
Of course we Return...
Welcome to the world, introduced live on stage
Projecting the light waves. Thick as the everglades
While yall masquerade
I remain myself on this quest to get paid

[Chorus]
X2


[Verse 3]
I master the ceremonial phrase
And hit you with lyrics reminiscent of the glorious days
All for one in this game
The only thing that's changed
Is the multiple frauds allowed to use our name
In god we came, so in god we trust
Check the Ultra Mag vibe in the nucleus
I let the words flow and relate to the criminal minds -
Follow the leader to the next text in time
Exercise the mind and you'll find
Light inside of my oratory design
Return, for all my graff niggas who burn
DJs in the world watching their Technics turn
For my B-Boy brothers suffering floor burns
Bust a headspin to this one - Return

[Scratch solo]
Return...
