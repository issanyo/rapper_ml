[Hook]
Lean on me, lean on you
You got a phone, I got one too
We can take a sip and smoke a blunt or 2
Lean on me, lean on you

[Verse 1]
Purple pushing, pink peons
Ain't getting no money hanging with them weak cones
Hoes and purple panties
Mary pushing past me
Moppin my shit, a nigga mad that I'm gladly
Sippin slow, at the red light
Hopin this bitch get ghost knowin I hit before
There's a lean about his toast and maine I let it roast
Used to spend a dollar on dope and not the liquor
Now I spend a dollar on dope but nothing occasional
Coke, co or pro pro meth, yeah I'm activist
For the activist, you an actor
Actually an actress
Kill the late stacks and might smack your bitch
Styrofoam gum but it lean left, one night the turn up
Bout to squeeze blood from the turn up
Power how the blunts burn up
These bitches better learn us
A hunneds on they summers couldn't turn us
Steamin like a hot furnace
The boys got burners, the attitude in that turn up
Shit and rap burgers, I pack the tracks murder
Just leanin off the syrup, satellite swerving to the right
High as a kite, wish I could do a couple nights
Might buy a couple pints
Polarize, the lower size
Niggas oughta know I'm high

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm so high, baby I'm so high
Baby I'm so high, baby I'm so high
