[Chorus]
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas, swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like U-like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas, swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless

[Verse 1]
I just wanna come down one day, 'round one day
Candy painted with surround one day
Clown one day, show the grill, show the grill
I just wanna bend the corner late night to the early morning
Got an old school with some new components
Back then, they didn't want me
Now that I'm swangin', they all on me
Now that I'm pullin' up clean, I doubled the figure like double the cup of the lean
Glasshouse with the gleam, screams like puppets on strings
Yadadamean
4 pm at the Kappa on swangers and adapters watchin' me ball, yeah
Salamander on the slab, two miles per hour, they watchin' me crawl, yeah

[Chorus]
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas, swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like U-like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas (Chop suey), swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless

[Verse 2]
Poppin' up twice, trunk shakin' like a fist full of dice
Wrist game like a cooler of ice
Chandelier-like, who need some light?
UFOs like, who need a ride?
Don 'Ke keep the South on the side (Southside)
Southside while I'm tippin' on fo's
Suplex when I'm slammin' them doors
Top drop, keep my halo exposed (Look at that)
Swang down, sweet chariot stop
Ron C might go off with a chop
Beltway all the way to the top
Jammin' Screw on a tape 'til it pop (Screwed up)
Texas gave me a lot, feel like it's home
From M-I, crooked with love
Forever it's diamonds and wood in the chrome, mane!

[Chorus]
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas, swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like U-like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas (Chop Suey), swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless

[Outro]
Learnin' shit from Texas
Learnin' shit from Texas
