[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
I'm stuck to you
I'm sorry I can't get loose
I'm stuck to you
I apologize for all the times I blew
I'm stuck to you
I'm sorry I can't get loose
I'm stuck to you
I apologize for all the times I blew

[Bridge: Johnny Venus]
You pretty black rose, you brutalized soul
I pinky promise I won't hurt you no mo'
Don't leave me out, out in the cold
'Cause I don't wanna die anymore (Alright! Attention!)

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Mister misunderstanding is marryin' miscommunication today at 3
Don't lose your invitation, they say it's the place you ought to be
Filled with the who's whos? Ah, who's you? Who's me? And who's anybody?
Please stress and you'll find it (like casket [?]), well gee, just wait and see
Who grabbed me by the collar?
Made me make 'em holla, I should've reconsidered, I know
Niggas ain't shit, huh, well you ain't lyin'
And I hate, I hate to be E-let go
So in this nightlife, said I apologize

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
I'm stuck to you
I'm sorry I can't get loose
I'm stuck to you
I apologize for all the times I blew
I'm stuck to you
I'm sorry I can't get loose
I'm stuck to you
I apologize for all the times I blew

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
First time did this verse, spit it half-assed
I wasn't in the mood, goons get emotional too
You angelic, getting high got me closer to you
Summer nights, stargazing, Frank Ocean and 'shrooms
Girl you drive me beaucoup cuckoo
Fucked around in you even though you down to fuck bitches too
There's nothing that you won't do
Mama ain't raise no fool, well now I guess that ain't true
I'm in and out of symbiotic situation shit too often
Never finish how they started, used to fuck you on the carpet
The floor is hot lava, Hawaii tickets we always talked about
I guess I'm finna go without ya like Forgetting Sarah Marshall
Marshall ain't came in here for a minute
Depending who you asking, you ask who you depend in
But what we been through ain't nobody business
My love for you is infinite

[Bridge: Arin Ray]
Fake me in the same clothes
Fuck that if I say so
Worst part is she can’t clone
Love, love is—
Everything that we came for
Everything that we made for us
Everything that we paid for
Why is it breaking us down?
Love, now why-why
Why is it breaking us down?
Love

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
I'm stuck to you
I'm sorry I can't get loose
I'm stuck to you
I apologize for all the times I blew
I'm stuck—
