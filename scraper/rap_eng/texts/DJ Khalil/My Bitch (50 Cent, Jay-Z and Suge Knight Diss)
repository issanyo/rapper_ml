[Verse 1: To 50 Cent]
Let me tell you a story about this bitch I know
Grew up on the south side sucking dicks for dough
Give her a half a dollar, she'll put on a show
Do anything to be in a Dr. Dre video
The bitch went Hollywood
One trip to the West Coast
She got fucked by this white bitch had her legs wide open
As long as my pockets were fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
My pretty young thing keep my nuts drained
But all the time she was plotting on my Aftermath chain
Bitch couldn't stay in her lane
Started running with this ho from the south
Gold grill in her mouth
She put her on the track
Gave her her first thong
Introduced her to her two girlfriends from back home
Fucked the industry, tryna take the fast route
Ran into a gangster and he turned they ass out

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: To Jay-Z]
From the projects hustled all day
Niggas called her Sophie from around the way
Used to play hard to get so they thought she was gay
Bougie bitch who ever thought she was raised in B.K
Moved out the hood
Changed her name to Jay
Told everybody she'll be working with a mill one day
I was introduced to her back in 96
She had a wavey haircut and some big ass lips
At first she was hard to hit
Come to find out the last ten years she been sucking Big dick
Got a family now
A house made of bricks
Four grown ass kids and ain't none of them shit
She still my bitch so I stayed around
But she always tryna dash when other dame's around
She tryna play The Game but I got the bitch number
She said she won't but she'll be back next summer

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: To Suge Knight]
Last but not least my gangsta bitch
From Compton always in and out of jail and shit
Bitch tried to burn Snoop
Stole Chronic from Doc
Blew the whole West Coast, even tried to fuck Pac
Type of bitch to stand on Beverley Hills
Word on the street she got a few real niggas killed
I look up now she on my dick
Telling me how she always gonna be my bitch
Pop up at award shows always following me
Bitch doing dumb shit, got a college degree
No pre-nupt, one nigga got stick with her
I was smart knew always not to fuck with her
What goes around comes around, scandolous shit
Somebody tried to kill that bitch
Burned the bridges and ain't had one friend left
Niggas that know her called her the devil in that red dress
