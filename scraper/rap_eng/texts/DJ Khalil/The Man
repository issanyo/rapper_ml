[Intro : Duke Hodasi]
HODGangg!
So! King HOD, I’m going in, Leh go

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
Well you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the man
Well you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the man

[Verse 1 : Duke Hodasi]
Go ahead tell ‘em, I’m the man
Duke Biadela Yao Hodasi, that’s my name
I'm blowing haters away like I’m a fan
I’m so high, it's like, I’m in Amsterdam
Last name start with an “H” like Saddam’s
So forcing you to listen to me, that’s my plan
Wanna who the best is, ask the fans
I retired for a while, but I’m back again
HODGangg is the best crew
Yo’ dad is a fan too
Go back, if you jealous
If you ain’t dope man, you should get lost
Like GOD, they used to look down on me
I was on the ground then they were on the balcony
I’m a boss now, so they bow to me
Goal!?, make GOD and my family proud of me

[Hook : Aloe Blacc]
Well you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the man
Well you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the man

[Verse 2 : Duke Hodasi]
Back in the days
I couldn’t find a way out, like I was stuck in a maze
I used to be a bad boy like Puffy and Mase
Then one day I told myself that is time that I change
I made a promise to be a better man, starting today
Then my life turned around when I started to pray
Befriended GOD and saw his blessings coming my way
They hear me rap and go like we are fucking amazed
Doing me, don’t like it, go jump in a lake
Like Burna Boy, I’m always running a race
If you come in my lane
You will get a punch to the face
I’m here for good, I’m not retiring again
Like the Iron Man, I’m stuck in this game…HOD

[Hook : Aloe Blacc]
Well you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the man
Well you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the man

[Outro : Duke Hodasi]
I thank GOD for this talent He has given me
And also all the good people in my life
Especially my dad, Mr. Yao Hodasi
And, my brother, Mr. Denzel Hodasi
You two have always been there for me
And I really appreciate you guys for that
I’m really sorry for all the mean things I ever did to you guys
I will do anything I can to make you guys proud of me
HOD!!!
