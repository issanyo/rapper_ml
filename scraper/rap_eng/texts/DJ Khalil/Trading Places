You dream of trading places , I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much lose, you can not fill these shoes
Be careful what you wish for

If I was a Crip I'd be from Long Beach cuz
Rocking the Polamalu, yellow and black Impala
Follow me two times ten, where the bitches ain't the only ones thats rollin' this Escalades stolen
Caught him in the drive through (we supposed to be brothers)
Long Beach rollin twentys, mutha fucka
V.I.P gang bangin' on the rooftops
Since Dre made Snoop hot, the Dogg Pound blew drop
Bouncin' in Manhattan, Crippin' in the Big Apple
Blowing chronic smoke into a blue sky do I
Look like a mutha fuckin snitch?
Hell no, Doggy Dogg got the whole fuckin world yelling (Crip)
Give a fuck about a bitch unless its my wife
Infiltrate the dog house its going to be a dog fight
No Vick just Rottweilers and Pitts and the D-O Double G stay on his gangsta shit

Be carefull what you wish for
