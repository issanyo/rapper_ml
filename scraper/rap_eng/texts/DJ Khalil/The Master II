[Intro]
Don't let it bother you. We're not trying to find out if we're better than somebody else or if we're different than somebody else. We're trying to find out who we are, what we are, where we are, and the possibilities of where we can go. That's self knowledge. What good is it gonna do us to find out what's wrong with somebody else if we don't know what's right with us? You don't fly to your height on another man's plane. You fly to your height on your own. That includes self knowledge and the power thereof

[TiRon & Ayomari]
Show love, give thanks
Take time, be calm
Don't trip, don't trip
Don't trip, don't trip
Fall down, get up
Hold on, be strong
Don't trip, don't trip
Don't trip, don't trip
Show love

[Outro]
So the mastery of the heart is what gives you access to the idea in the pool of liberation. The law of attraction is love in action, drawing you back towards the center, while love is so important and we see it's not going on down here on planet Earth. Anyone that can pick at your ego, and make you slap them, hit them, shoot them, is your master. It doesn't matter if the master is that big, and has only a four letter or four word vocabulary. That little child becomes your master if he or she can force you to lose your temper. What's going to solve our problem as human beings in the community, the collective, the family, and the couplets - man and woman, husband and wife - is love, real love. Not real passion, real love - power
