[Hook: Kobe]
And I'm drunk and I'm blown, and I don't know what I'mma do
Got it cocked ready, loaded, and I'm looking for you
In your nightmare
I'll be right there

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9]
Yeah, uh, you ain't even in a realm we spit
Nightmare's mental, Freddy Krueger pencil on my Elm Street shit
Believe none of what you see, none of this shit you've heard
I call rolling a blunt of herb turning over a new leaf
A mixture of Biggie and Pac, going upside your head
With a mic stand at your show, it's me giving you props
My mind's pure, I thank Pope, I game 'til the bank's broke
And my flow's Novacane as Frank Ocean
It ain't a thing to hang-a-ling, night tears by day
Nightmares of the night like dang-to-dang
It's 6 million ways to end your life
And I chose the tool over the bloody glove with the finger knives
I'm who you can't stand, probably leanin'
You probably dreamin' 'bout Mr. Sandman mixed with up with Robert Englund
Me? I put it right there to see
How could I ever have a bad dream when the nightmare's me? Nickel

[Hook: Kobe]
And I'm drunk
And I'm blown
I don't know what I'mma do
Got it cocked
Ready loaded
And I'm looking for you
In your nightmare
I'll be right there

[Verse 2: Professor Green]

Hahaha
Everything in life comes at a price
It's time for you to pay

My pen is my paintbrush
I'm forever taking it farther and further
God forbid that I ever extend my art to murder
You don't wanna see me and these Shih-Tzu's in a pen
I'm a pit-bull
The world needs a new Fritzl doesn't it
I ain't thinking about pistols
Fuck a stick
I'm more interested in doing some other shit
Planning shit out
And really having some fun with it
Disintegrating your body instead of dumping it
I don't care how uncomfortable your cupboard is
I'll be up in it
Until I hear your front door opening
You're coming in (Surprise)
Til it's time to get to work
With the screws and all the other tools that I come here with
Yeah I'm fucking sick in the head
Should I operate in silence?
Or pick a cassette
To drown out the screams
As the blade tickles your flesh
I can hear the heart in your chest beat as you plead to me
Until I cut your tongue out when I'm sick of hearing you beg
Should have quit while ahead
You little fuck
You think a little blood is punishment enough
For all the things that you said?
Just as the blade I picked to finish you hits your neck
You wake up shivering in your bed
Yeah I'm a nightmare

[Hook: Kobe]
And I'm drunk
And I'm blown
I don't know what I'mma do
Got it cocked
Ready loaded
And I'm looking for you
In your nightmare
I'll be right there
