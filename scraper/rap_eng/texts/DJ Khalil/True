Intro

[Hook]
Say something true
Behind every man is a woman
I never do it for attention
If you're nice you should do it all the time Ms
True, these other women false but you
True, we can kick it long as you keep it
True, I'm down to take that dare with you
True, forget the consequences

[Verse 1: Freeway]
Wendy's drive through she got me open nice
Know how to work the mic, plus she ride too
She make me thick crab cakes never fried foods
Plus she rock them red bottoms like she dah-moo
Feels like a model when she stylin' on commas and
All these other niggas swear they got her what she my boo
She a stew at this so she fly too
She got cake too, all the ay vibe coop

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, alleviate without a stressing
The baddest bitch thats why add like a Twitter mention
Other niggas beginners, she barely seen that bentley
She been recently missing 'cause she been seein me pimpin
Smoking this sweet my deepest shawty sweet Mississippi
I hear the beat I better seem, like you singin a symphony
I blowin rather just me and now I'm at us
Don't worry when I caught these feelings, just know I have em
Just know it's love, just know it's real
Some couple hundred is really nothing I'm blowin heels
Make a candy ring shawty so for real
Seas everywhere, hell yeah soldier feel

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Bring out the sun girl, you the one girl
You do the thing girl, you should be my main girl
That's

[Hook]

I call the party and she got me spending time
She got me chasing seconds
And she don't even give her father time instant message
I'm only chop it off before we connecting
Body like an hour glass sweet as  nip-tuck and liquor
Each side my rock, Louie handbags nothing lesser
Every day she oovoo me don't even let her now or bad
Every day she oovoo me dont even let an hour pass
Take my time and massage in the shower
Just say I got the power 'cause I never need the power nap
Long flights to parish or flights to islands
Yes we're in our back 'cause you can't get an hour back
Physical then she spend the nights in bollies
We take long nights trial just to spite the mollage
And after high school she went right to college
Make her give me good brain just to spite the knowledge
Thirty thousand feet up just to spite the Pilot
I would never trap her but I'ma keep her, yeah
