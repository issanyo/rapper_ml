(Verse 1)
What the devil wanna see
Me
Fall to his feet
I never listen to what the preachers preach
What the teachers teach
Cause my mind resonates where a cell be
Walking through these streets
I grip my Jesus piece
Peace
Holy Ghost tapped me on my shoulder
In the booth
If I speak the truth they gon wanna kill me
Well if you gon shoot then shoot
I don't fear death
So if this is my last breath
Let me make sure I followed every step
That God set for me
I rely on his guide heavily
He told me to tread carefully
Cause these the last days
So Satan in a craze
Trying to take as many as he can
Before he meets his faith
So please let's pray
You either in the black and white
Homie there ain't no gray
Me city turning chiraq
Before they fight they gonna spray
