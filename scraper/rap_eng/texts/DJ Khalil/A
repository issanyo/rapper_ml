Hold up wait a minute
All I dream is craziness
Killing innocent victims
Blowing up these absolutists
I don’t see what she sees in me
All I see is uncertainty
All I do is my obligation
Set this bomb for detonation
Tick tock, nothing happens
No planes up above, so my bomb isn't blasting
We wait patiently
It’s all so silent with my girl next to me
I never thought I’d be in love
Especially at a time when war is trouble
Can’t wait so down the bridge goes
We all look down and damn they know
We all get up because this battle is beginning
I beg for forgiveness because I’m about to be sinning
Inhale Exhale
Inhale Exhale

My leg got stomped by a stallion
Gotta let my girl know I’m a be dying
But I don’t mind it
I always knew I would be expiring
But I gotta thank the people in my live man
The past few days have been a full lifetime
I feel integrated with my own life
As I think about my dad whose dead
Killed himself when he was defending
Inhale Exhale
Inhale Exhale

Hold up, give me a minute
I need my sins to be forgiven
Thinking about suicide
This ain't right my mind is sky high
I could see why they did
But I would never execute the sin
All I’ll do is say good-bye
Bless my life and thank my wife
She made my life be amazing
This romantic love is my salvation
Oh man here he comes
I can hear the forest floor begin to drum
All I crave is this absinthe liquid
It has my spirits so uplifted
As I recognize the value of life
All this killing is unjustified
I don’t like to think about killing
I've done too much in this business
I have no right to forget
No war can absolve this vast guilt
Inhale Exhale
Inhale Exhale
