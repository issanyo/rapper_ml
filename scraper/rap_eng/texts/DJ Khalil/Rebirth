[Intro]
If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Came up fast, bittersweet
Please prepare me mentally
‘Fore you take my soul and empty me

[Interlude]
Now that you’re no longer a lord that’s trapped
You have graduated to the Hood Pope
You have made it to represent your people
Show them another way
Be the voice of the people who couldn’t make it out the hood

[Verse 1]
Make sure my family good, my ma still in the hood
I ain’t rich like they think cause I copped me one mink
They think I got me a house with a big couch and a gold sink
With a model bitch with a gold ring, big ass fish in a fish tank
Haha, you laughing, just put me in my casket
I ain’t even into nagging, it's what it is, I’m passing

[Interlude]
And though times is hard now, your success awaits them
I’m no different, we all the same
Ferg made it out? Well, I can play that game
You’re not exempt from the growing chain
Niggas forget who’s afraid to change
Yet a trapped lord, I will remain

[Verse 2]
Hood Pope, I’ma teach these confused folks how to maneuver
Through folks and attention, get you choked, you know
Slim model girls sniffing the coke
Fiend on the block sniffin’ the dope
I wanna help, I don’t know, tell me the, antidote
How you hood and a pope
Conscious thinking, ghetto though
I’ll teach you how to build a grow tree
Life like a bike and pedal slow

[Interlude]
Now you’re the voice of the guys on the corners
And the kids who have no direction, guide them
Through the trials and the tribulations
Teach them the world can be accumulated with patience

[Outro]
If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Came up fast, bittersweet
Please prepare me mentally
‘Fore you take my soul and empty me
