Aftermath presents...
Bitches on my dick
Action!

Haha. Good lookin' Khalil. Let's take these niggas to the stadium

[Verse One]:
Run for the hills, I'm takin' niggas meals
On some high school bully shit on big wheels
Bang like Big Foot on some E pills
Neck full of ice, give a vampire chills
That's not my life, I don't wear that shit for real
I just said that shit to get some bitches on my dick
Spread that shit to make the whole globe sick
Like pestilence, locust, that biblical shit
Unequivocal, not typical but still sayin' bitch
Do what I like on that digital shit
Carson been on the map, I'm just highlightin' it
The west coast is back nigga ain't no fightin' it
Chinchilla on my back
Feather in my cap
Look like Chewbacca on stage when I rap
Pimp pimp horray, I'm here to save the day
Thank God for Bishop, these other rappers is gay

[Chorus]:
Bitches on my dick (yep!)
Celly on my hip (yep!)
Fresh white tee and some crispy new kicks
Shinin' down my ride 'bout to roll down the strip (yep!)
Then tip a couple dubs watchin' sexy girls strip
Bitches on my dick (yep!)
Celly on my hip (yep!)
Fresh white tee and some crispy new kicks
Shinin' down my ride 'bout to roll down the strip (yep!)
Then tip a couple dubs watchin' sexy girls strip

[Verse Two]:
New white tee
State Property
Blue denim, with a fresh pair of Nikes
For that free promotion, niggas better pay me
Dippin' yachts on the ocean niggas sippin' ice tea
Return of the ? nigga mixed with the scholar
Screamin' "revolution", still poppin' my collar
Off backpack rap, still stack them dollars
Still call feminists 'women witches' still get 'em out they Prada
Gorilla Pimpin', I'm Donkey Kong savage
Fuck Crunk dancin' I'll still Roger Rabbit
Do the Kid N Play little hola hola aye
Then running man and cabbage patch that's how I sway
Grown ass man, hundred stacks in my hand
Peanut butter leather call my Beamer 'Peter Pan'
International gigolo Cali, Rio to Japan
You might not recognize me I come back with a tan

[Chorus]:
Bitches on my dick (yep!)
Celly on my hip (yep!)
Fresh white tee and some crispy new kicks
Shinin' down my ride 'bout to roll down the strip (yep!)
Then tip a couple dubs watchin' sexy girls strip
Bitches on my dick (yep!)
Celly on my hip (yep!)
Fresh white tee and some crispy new kicks
Shinin' down my ride 'bout to roll down the strip (yep!)
Then tip a couple dubs watchin' sexy girls strip

[Verse Three]:
Bitches on my dick
Celly on my hip
Suck a nigga up until there's lugies on your lip
If niggas wanna trip
Act out a script
I make short films, let me show you a clip
It's a horror flick
You don't want no drama
Got the heart of a pimp and still love my mama
I respect women, I treat 'em like a rose
I only disrespect them bitches and them hoes
I can't lie cause I love y'all too
Menage e trois, girls on girls, hit my boys off too
I'm a scorpio
I can't help it yo
Misogyny, pornography runs in my blood flow
Can't you just feel the love?
Tell the DJ play this song when you in the strip club
I ain't in love with no stripper nigga, that's a sin
Bitch I can't be your hubby but we can be friends

[Chorus]:
Bitches on my dick (yep!)
Celly on my hip (yep!)
Fresh white tee and some crispy new kicks
Shinin' down my ride 'bout to roll down the strip (yep!)
Then tip a couple dubs watchin' sexy girls strip
Bitches on my dick (yep!)
Celly on my hip (yep!)
Fresh white tee and some crispy new kicks
Shinin' down my ride 'bout to roll down the strip (yep!)
Then tip a couple dubs watchin' sexy girls strip
