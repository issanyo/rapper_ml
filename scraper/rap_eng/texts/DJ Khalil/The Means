[Verse 1]
Do you really know the difference between needing shit and wants
Niggas after my position think I do this shit to flaunt
Like I do this just to stunt, hoe I been struggling since a runt
Now I got paper, I get pussy, then get ghost I know I haunt
Young king, black market, spark I’m higher than a punt
Sipping xo nothing special, only fire in my blunt
No boo this is not no rental, brand new tires on the truck
And if my partner say he down, I’m gon’ pick my nigga up
Carti yay yeah for my fragrance and my frames, I’m clean as fuck
Slid through my granny’s and my cousins, hooked them up yeah just because
Keep that food up on the table, man I carry my own weight
Never said I never need help, there was times I wouldn’t straight
Throw your hands up to the sky, if on your ride you can relate
Seen some gurneys on your journey, nigga gone and cop the wraith
Cop you and your girl them flights, get the fuck up out of state
Four Seasons with your visa out in Pisa grubbin steak

[Chorus]
If the ends justify the means
I’m gon’ spend that bread on anything I need
If my friend pull up with potent packs of weed
I’m gon’ probably cop some tree just to keep my mind at ease
If the Benz fresh off the lot look super clean
Then I guess yeah I’m gon’ cop that cause a scene
All depend on what you spend what you receive
Gotta look out for your team
Nigga justify your means

[Verse 2]
Now if my clique win the war
Do that mean that I’m right?
I’m just saying I ain’t playing I’ve been fighting my whole life
I ain’t stunting outta spite
Only I want it cause it’s tight
I’m feeling higher than a kite and I fly that bitch at night
‘Cause I always did my thing
I got cream bring me
I’m a nerd to these gangsters
I’m a G to these geeks
If I fuck with you a hundred I would never charge a fee
You’d be surprised if you heard what they saying in the streets
So I had to talk to God
I ain’t trying to go to hell
And my momma would agree she know exactly how I feel
Paying bills and your kids feed how could you regret
Do your thing, fuck you mean ends justify the means

[Chorus]
If the ends justify the means
I’m gon’ spend that bread on anything I need
If my friend pull up with potent packs of weed
I’m gon’ prob’ly cop some tree just to keep my mind at ease
If the Benz fresh off the lot look super clean
Then I guess yeah I’m gon’ cop that cause a scene
All depend on what you spend what you receive
Gotta look out for your team
Nigga justify your means

[Verse 3]
Bitch I'm ski mask down if I need to
Boulder on my shoulder, I ain’t talking bout CU
Breeze through in a green coupe
Gold spokes, feeling like Caine
Off of caine and the blunt smoke
Late night on a trip to
Thinking ‘bout a lick, baby momma and my son
Ain't nothing new, up under the sun
Just another black man broke gunning for funds
Pull up at the cash gold spot around 12 o’ clock
Bumping Pac, gotta take a deep breath
Open up my wallet got no ends in it
But a pic of a kid and a note that says
Eliminate risk there’s no reward
No way I'm doing this sober dog
Took a big ol' swig out the cognac fifth
Is you ready?
You know it boys
Kick the door open rush up in the store
Just me and two homies with some criminal skills
But we slipped up tripped up the silent alarm
In a minute one homie was killed
Other nigga dipped made a move to Brazil
Well me I got popped doing time in the pen
Took a risk just to pay my kid’s medical bills
Another lesson when the means don't meet the end

[Chorus]
If the ends justify the means
I’m gon’ spend that bread on anything I need
If my friend pull up with potent packs of weed
I’m gon’ prob’ly cop some tree just to keep my mind at ease
If the Benz fresh off the lot look super clean
Then I guess yeah I’m gon’ cop that cause a scene
All depend on what you spend what you receive
Gotta look out for your team
Nigga justify your means
