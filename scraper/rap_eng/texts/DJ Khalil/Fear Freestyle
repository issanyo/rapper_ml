[Emilio Rojas]
Listen, I ain't messing with ya if I don't know where you live
Fuck around with us and we show up...
Listen, I ain't messing with ya if I don't know where you live
Fuck around with us and we show up at your crib
I ain't doing business with no strangers or acquaintances
I ain't talking paper with friends cause it hurt relationships
I seen the craziest, not knowing what to make of it
The Roc City fragrance will spray you on some playful shit
Another mural, they brutal, they fucking through
At any moment, the door could be open like The Adjustment Bureau
You trust your girl but I heard tales of dames that run trains
If you touch, you get slain just like the third rail (all aboard!)
We keep scheming on skeezes, they keep skeezing
Hey, they put a twist in they lip, Joaquin Phoenix
My dream sequence is propane with the head of your clique
He been surrounded by dicks just like a blow bang
Ain't no shame, I live without it, I figured out that nowadays
You normal or you corny, I went a different route
My clique about it, we silent, that's how we move
The ones you gotta watch be the quiet ones in the room, right?
Since adolescence, I had a presence, it's mad impressive
You staring at an ass injection like it's past perfection
Cats accept it without asking questions, yeah
Well I'm with natural women and they ain't coming with no plastic section
She wanna role play, that's why she coming my way
She can be LeBron's mom and I'mma be Delonte
She gotta fuck me, the bride of Chucky is Child's Play
I've gotten lucky, them women love the way I taste
A lot of fuckery has gotten ugly so I wait
For all them dummies to get the fuck out of my way
Yo, fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way
Scorching, I been recording inside an ashtray
You Scott Storching, you snorted all of your cash away
While Emilio would be sunning, grooving his pathway
