[Hook] [Kobe Killa]:
One knocks get your ass a little bit of yay
Two knocks get your ass a little bit of haze
Three knocks that's when niggas comin' with the cheese
More than four knocks, nigga that's the police
If you don't know the code don't come around here
If you don't know the code don't come around here
If you don't know the code don't come around here
Don't come around here, don't come around here
Bang!

[Verse One] [Bishop]:
For the loot I'm Uncle Luke nigga don't stop, get it get it
Don't stop, get it get it, triple digits, six digit
Bitches want my digits so they ask me for my digits
Wanna visit, wanna kiss it, gonna kiss it, gon' unzip it
Fit it, slip it in her cervix
Bring 'em in, keep 'em out like Curtis
Top notch, hot sauce is the verbiage
Sprinkle drops on the blocks then serve it
Bon' apetit for the streets Top Chef
I show you how to serve it
Weigh it like yay, sling it like yay
It's pure dope of course, every word I say
Pablo Escobar in every bar
In every bar I gotta party like a rock star
Lindsay Lohan, I get blown in the Jaguar
Love them snow bunnies more than Tay Diggs hard
Yeah I'm on them crackers more than caviar

[Hook] [Kobe Killa]:
One knocks get your ass a little bit of yay
Two knocks get your ass a little bit of haze
Three knocks that's when niggas comin' with the cheese
More than four knocks, nigga that's the police
If you don't know the code don't come around here
If you don't know the code don't come around here
If you don't know the code don't come around here
Don't come around here, don't come around here
Bang!

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
It's the new Master Ace, I'm Sittin' On Chrome
Sitting On Chrome, jackers get your brains blown
It's the new Master Ace, I'm Sittin' On Chrome
Sitting On Chrome, push a button, roof gone
Like a hurricane did it, like a hurricane hit it
Watch me lean, looking clean
Haters you ain't gotta admit it
I'm so pretty sippin' pretty in that next top model
Drive report in the Porsche, fuck the Next Top Model
Bishop's that nigga in the lake, no lie
Bishop's that nigga ask them boys at NY
Bishop's that nigga? Homeboy, worldwide
Even 'Pac and Big love it bump me on the other side
Carson's in the house, my gun's in my pants
Faggots looking at me huh, who wanna dance?
The straps in the car, homie you ain't got a chance
I'm ready for whatever in my B boy stance

[Hook] [Kobe Killa]:
One knocks get your ass a little bit of yay
Two knocks get your ass a little bit of haze
Three knocks that's when niggas comin' with the cheese
More than four knocks, nigga that's the police
If you don't know the code don't come around here
If you don't know the code don't come around here
If you don't know the code don't come around here
Don't come around here, don't come around here
Bang!

[Verse Three] [Bishop]:
For the cheese I'm Young MC, nigga I Bust that Move
And I bust that move like I transport you know who
I gets that through like Jebediah Bush
Slanging on the radio, I ain't gotta push
See the pretties do it for me, the DJ's do it for me
I'm up in Club Shaq they sayin' me so horny
You know I'm numero uno
I'm the boss now bitch but you mustn't get the memo
M.O., N.E.Y., I got plenty
Touch it and you die, shots from the semi
Shots from the Henny, I'm Jack Ruby with the semi
I Anna Nicole you, you won't get a penny
I'm heated like that trim spa
? try to trim y'all
Have you in black like Jenna's 6 for your funeral
I do it, I do it, what the business is?
? your whole family, no witnesses

[Hook] [Kobe Killa]:
One knocks get your ass a little bit of yay
Two knocks get your ass a little bit of haze
Three knocks that's when niggas comin' with the cheese
More than four knocks, nigga that's the police
If you don't know the code don't come around here
If you don't know the code don't come around here
If you don't know the code don't come around here
Don't come around here, don't come around here
Bang!
