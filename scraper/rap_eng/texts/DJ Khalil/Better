[Intro]
*Sobbing*
I don't belong to you anymore

[Verse 1]
Never low, she stay high
Hit the room and she was aimin' for the skies
I held her pain but she came back
She would spread those wings, she'd be too damn fly
Never down, she stay up
Don't need nothin' from me, she keep her weight up
In my time, you know my name
She don't care about the money or the fame

[Chorus]
She just wanted to love me and I wouldn't let her
Now she don't know me, 'cause somebody treatin' her better
Now she don't know me, 'cause somebody treatin' her better
Now she don't know me, 'cause somebody treatin' her better
She just wanted to love me

[Verse 2]
I was a mess, but so was she
Never prayed, she just put her faith in me
I didn't care, she cared too much
I thought I needed space, she just needed love
I was too young, to understand
Even the man can intervene with the heavenly skin
She still knows we're meant to be
But she won't ever take me back, it's too late for that

[Chorus]
She just wanted to love me, I wouldn't let her
Now she don't know me, 'cause somebody treatin' her better
Now she don't know me, 'cause somebody treatin' her better
Now she don't know me, 'cause somebody treatin' her better
She just wanted to love me
She just wanted to love me
