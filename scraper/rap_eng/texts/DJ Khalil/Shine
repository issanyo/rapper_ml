[Verse 1]
Driving through the fog with my high beams putting on my Visine 
Let me tell you just what I seen
Angels falling from the sky 
I just hope that they can take me
Back to where the pearly gates be 
And I been counting down the days because I know we gotta die soon
That just means I get to fly soon
And I know I'm not the only one out here that's not afraid 
Alright alrighty now I'm finally on my way
I know I can't fail if God testing my faith
And if I don't hurry I might be too late
Even with all of this darkness in my grave

[Hook]
I still can't help but shine (shining)
I can't help but shine (shining)
I still can't help but shine (shining)
And we can't help but shine (shining)
I can't help it
(I'm shining, you see it, ay)
I can't help but shine 
(I'm shining, you see it, ay, ay)
I still can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ay)
And we can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ay, ay)
I can't help it 

[Verse 2]
Ever since I was a little baby this has been amazing 
Thankful for the life you gave me 
With every step and every breath know that I been living by you
Lord just tell me what should I do
And I been counting down the days cause pretty soon this will be all gone 
And your the one that Ima call on
That's how I know I'll be free and won't be locked inside a cage
Alright alrighty now I'm finally on my way
I know I can't fail if God testing my faith
And if I do t hurry I might be too late
Even with all of this darkness in my grave

[Hook]
I still can't help but shine (shining)
I can't help but shine (shining)
I still can't help but shine (shining)
And we can't help but shine (shining)
I can't help it
(I'm shining, you see it, ay)
I can't help but shine 
(I'm shining, you see it, ay, ay)
I still can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ay)
And we can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ay, ay)
I can't help it 

[Verse 3]
Raised in the ghetto
I promised my family told them that I'm bout to take it a whole nother level
These niggas that stay in my city be getting all cozy but I never settle 
And I'm making my way to heaven while all of my homies been facing the Devil
And speak of the Devil
That nigga tryna get in my brain 
So I roll my weed to ease my mind a bit mind a bit 
Sometimes I pace myself and take my time with it time with it
Plus I be staying in track like a locomotive and I'm planning to make it
So it doesn't matter if you never notice a man in the making
And I close my eyes sometimes and dive in a pool of my dreams 
And I been search far and high and wide until I found my wings
You gotta be crazy if you say you fly as high as I do
As so as I make it to the pearly gates I'm praying that they gone open up

I still can't help but shine (shining)
I can't help but shine (shining)
I still can't help but shine (shining)
And we can't help but shine (shining)
I can't help it
(I'm shining, you see it, ay)
I can't help but shine 
(I'm shining, you see it, ay, ay)
I still can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ay)
And we can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ay, ay)
I can't help it
