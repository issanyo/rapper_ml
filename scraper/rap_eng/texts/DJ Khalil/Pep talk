[verse 1]
How do you expect respect when you reject to give it to yourself/ now i'm not sayin' you gotta be cocky but be a little confident, take the feats and pocket it. Cause every penny, nickle and dime adds up to an accomplishment so every single thing you do acknowledge it! understand where you did good and learn how  you could polish it/ make it great and polish it/ n' work till it's astonishing and if you want it then you gotta study it until you gotta scholarship and a grasp on all of it. So work hard, play hard but don't get lost in frolicin' be a workoholic cause if you gotta dream then Face it,cause  you're never gonna make it if you don't chase it and face it you're basic-lee basic if you try to follow someone elses creations and be someone you're not. try be your self be an indiviudal with a dream so incredible and ridiculous that you even gotta doubt yourself but you gotta give yourself the benifit of the doubt
