[Verse 1]
Can you keep a secret?
Would you kiss and tell?
Don't anybody know anymore how to keep anything to they self?
I'm pretty sure I'm doubtful
Too many scars to be an optimist
Yeah I'm just a fool from the old school who's still tryna be monogamous

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me everything about you
I'm ready to listen
What's your biggest fantasy you wanna see come true
When you're wishin' for what you're wishin'?
I tell you everything about me
There ain't no secrets that I keep from you
One thing that ain't no secret that you know already know for sure
Something that we could do

[Chorus]
We could dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
And dance real slow
Real slow
Real slow
Real slow
And imagine if the cops ain't killin' nobody
Imagine that our bank account filled with money
We dance real slow
Real slow
Real slow
Sorry if I step on your toes

[Verse 2]
You can open up your eyes now
And tell me what you see
Do you feel like there's a place for you and me in the home of the brave and the land of the free?
I'm a lover not a fighter
But I fight for what I love
See the world is full of jokers, fakers, haters and takers
You know I'm none of the above

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me everything about you
I'm ready to listen
What's your biggest fantasy you wanna see come true?
When you're wishin' for what you're wishin'?
I tell you everything about me
There ain't no secrets that I keep from you
One thing that ain't no secret that you know already know for sure
Something that we could do

[Chorus]
We could dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
And dance real slow
Real slow
Real slow
Real slow
And imagine if the cops ain't killin' nobody
Imagine that our bank account filled with money
We dance real slow
Real slow
Real slow
Sorry if I step on your toes

[Bridge]
I'm not the vain of type to show on TV
I'm tryna change the way that people see me

[Chorus]
We could dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
Dance with our eyes closed
And dance real slow
Real slow
Real slow
Real slow
And imagine if the cops ain't killin' nobody
Imagine that our bank account filled with money
We dance real slow
Real slow
Real slow
Sorry if I step on your toes
