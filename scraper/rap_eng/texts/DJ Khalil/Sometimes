[Intro]
You know, most of these niggas ain't shit
But, when you find you a smooth brother...
You know what I mean, like, a real good brother
You better keep that nigga
Because things do change you know
Sometimes...

[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
Sometimes I wonder would you show love if I’m average (uhh)
Such a good heart my surroundings just make me savage (uhh)
Sometimes they wonder will I deliver a classic baby 
Now I’m strong arming the game, Angela Bassett
T-T- Tell em’ I’m a don, coke seats Nicky Barnes
Movin’ up, all my bitches clean up nice, think they Florence
From where the feds got the phone tapped, Gregory Hines
What goes up must come down nigga, thats a 69 (oww)
Sometimes they think that I changed for what its worth
Young nigga cool as a fan, go buy the merch (uhh)
Even if this life wasn’t sweet, never dessert me
We gone stay forever like black people in church preach (church)
Sometimes niggas don’t hate you, women want trust
Sometimes I pray that my people believe in us
Sometimes she try to be good, can’t make it up
Funny how a mack moving this powder could make you blush (sometimes)

[Hook: Dominic Gordon]
Lately, the world done gone so crazy
I seen things that I can’t believe
Man it's getting too hard to breathe
That’s how it feel sometime
(yeah, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh,)
Sometimes!

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Sometimes they love you, sometimes I feel the neglect
Yes I’m, young Berry Gordy temptations are of the flesh
Yessir, demons are TLC’n, they creep up the best
This is a Weekend At Bernies these niggas dancin’ with death (uhh)
Kill of the phony friends, can’t let the cancers breathe
Please girl don’t steal my heart, this is the land of thieves
I’m Dr. King on the balcony, what a cancelled dream
Money’s the root of evil that destroyed the family trees
Sometimes my futures bright, sometimes its dark around me
I’m living through these bars, can’t get the law from round me
Life was so awful, we made it, now she so awkward round me
Still bending corners like I overheard you talk about me (oww)
Told you this is peacoat galore, p-i-m-p, d-o-p-e they told me ki's open doors
They must be down with opp how JB coming for y’all
Sometimes you gotta let it go and let shit go run its course (sometimes)

[Hook: Dominic Gordon]
Lately, the world done gone so crazy
I seen things that I can’t believe
Man it's getting too hard to breathe
That’s how it feel sometime
(yeah, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh,)
Sometimes!

[Outro]
Yeah
(That brother is ice cold!)
Sometimes, occasionally rather than all the time
From time to time, every so often
Sometimes only shows you my inconcistency
It also shows you that I'm human
Sometimes I dig you baby, sometimes I don't
True player for real
Sometimes we slip, sometimes we trip out
But will there be a time you niggas'll be able to fuck with me
Know what I'm talking bout?
Not even on my gloomy days
