[Adlib: THURZ]
L.A. to Illadelf'

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
I said, lo and behold black information overload
I walk around in a trance, Paul Oakenfold
The one that used to be the lowest on the totem pole
I reconstructed my goals and left a broken mold
Then set sights on the open road
And hit up anywhere and everywhere, that real shit is born in soul
The game got me on an honor roll
That mean whenever speaking my name begin it with The Honorable
T-A-R, one 'I' like a monocle
'Q', I bring the riot through and laugh like it's comical, boy
Shit, I beat ya' ass like a mama do
Smoking catatonic chronic, out in Bonnaroo
I'm psychological, so jump like Geronimo
Get your fucking ass knocked down like a domino
Yo, I don't work then I won't eat
No, I don't Facebook and I don't tweet
Ya'll mother fuckers out of control, like O.C
Taking a loss on the chin, like a goatee
Me? I'm kind of like a cellar door, low key
Used to mix bottles of Champale with O.E
I'm Aristotle I can't fail, I'm O.G
I came through to get free like no fee
Yo, they got me on the pedestal, trophy
Got 'em saying, damn 'Riq cheating like adultery
Sycamore, sitting on paper like upholstery
Noam Chomsky, on the organized rhyme-spree
To battle me would be a borderline robbery
And that's what it is, I'm Jimbrowski
In certain circles, call me the Big Lebowski
Ya'll Steve Urkels better find out about me

[Verse 2: Thurz]
Look, I been telling niggas I'm a terrorist
A biopsy might show you where the weapon is
Remove my brain, the bomb might self-destruct
Nuclear meltdown, Japan times ten - we all fucked
I'm uncut, Peruvian
Coked up, hydrochloride my fan base doped up
Lames duckin', chickens cluckin' you hemmed up
[?] [?] tailoring the city like black Chucks
This is the score to the riot, got heart in ya'
Too many rappers in the closet like Narnia
With the anal raps, all of them is fucking ass
The whole world on fire is the forecast
And suckers telling me you ought to take deep cover
Niggas wanna leave me like I'm sexin' Jesus' mom
Holy motherfucker
Kill the best member 'pon your team and his mom need a plumber
Delonte West motherfucker, but 'F' that
Reaching for some higher goals, higher places gotta take the higher road
To the dream, a 5'9" Olajuwon, kid
Cut that dead weight so a nigga can live
Refined like wine, take a sip and wake up from the hangover
Watch how I define
The game of Wilt Chamberlain and Kobe on the track
I might resurrect and probably bring Chick Hearn back
To commentate about this legendary shit
Commemorate me, at the funeral, play this
I swear, I'm on my Peter Parker tip
Mutated to a superhero like a spider bit
My ass, and now I'm spinning webs around your clique
Spider Man, tighter than your loose flow
Putting work in like Mexicans in front of the Home Depot
Look, this is the Molotov cocktail
We burn it down like demons ran out of hell
This is the riot with the bars, no taking L's
