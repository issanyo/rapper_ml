[Scene VI]

[KAI:]
What'd you wanna be when you grew up?

[THOMAS:]
Honestly? A musician...

[KAI:]
What?

[THOMAS:]
I know man, crazy right?

[KAI:]
Nah, what's crazy is...
Original music hasn't been created since Earth!

[THOMAS:]
I know man. Lucidity...

[KAI:]
What?

[THOMAS:]
Back then, people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness. Shit we took for granted was obvious; water, food supply. It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I dunno, I guess that's what I'm looking for...

[KAI:]
What, being able to make music?

[THOMAS:]
Not just that. If the laws are abolished following the migration—we're free dude!

[KAI:]
We're not slaves, Thomas...

[THOMAS:]
We aren't? You can't do anything outside the cause—not really. That's why we watch the same movies and listen to the same music. I mean don't get me wrong, the catalogue is incredible, but we need... I don't know...

[THALIA:]
Something more?

[THOMAS:]
Yeah, somethin' more...
