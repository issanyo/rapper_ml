[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was a gold chain with that gold ring
Twinkle twinkle 'cause they gold, man
Candy paint with the gold flakes
"Stay gold," said Granny as she smiled with her gold teeth
I got a goal to be golden like King Tut
Often those pictures of that gold, they would flicker
Make it hard to call me nigga
'Cause the chains ain't the chains they chained us up with
This rope ain't the rope they hanged us up with
24K gold face with the rollie
Invisible set with the grill, that's how gold taste
Jordan 7s, golden moment with the gold lace
Gold time, gold mines with the gold gates
If I die, bury mine in a gold case
Slow down, never mind it's a gold chase
Goin' for the gusto in a gold place
May God forgive my sins for a gold space
Krizzle

[Hook]
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the boat man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

[Verse 2]
I had a partna that went gold on the track and field
But the gold never shined in our atmosphere
Gold bottles, I ain't talking about the champagne
Malt liquor, sippin' gold helped us maintain
Hood niggas watching Goldie like that's us
Baggin' up the gold dust with the laws rushed
Snitchin' on them golden boys with the gold trust
Represented by the lawyers with gold cuffs
They order sweet potato with the gold crust
At the same restaurant with the gold judge
That hate the confidence and shine that the gold gives
So we take away your freedom and your golden years
The only time you see your mother's golden tears
Like, what good is gold if you never here?
What good is gold that you never wear?
I hope it pays your way on a golden pier

[Hook]
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the boat man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
And he claims that I owe, Lord, Lord, bury me in
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

[Outro]
And this song isn't meant to be a glorification of gold
But the understandin' that even if I could take all of this with me
That I’d give it away to get to heaven
I’d give it away to see my grandmother again
I’d give it away to be at paradise and be at peace with myself
Big houses, nice cars, all that stuff cool
But it's materialistic things that we strive so hard for
As human beings, and it's not fulfillin'
It doesn’t take away the pain, it doesn’t take away the loss
You have to search higher, you have to go higher for that
The higher power, that higher energy
And that’s what I’m striving for
So in the event that I go and you have to bury me
You can bury me with all these things
And as soon as I see my Maker, I would give it all back
I’d give it all away because it wasn’t nowhere near as important
As being in Heaven and bein' at peace
Believe that there, believe that there, hah
Bury me in gold, hahaha
That's the rapper in me just wantin' to do the hook one more time
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peace to everybody, man, stay blessed
God bless, we love y'all
