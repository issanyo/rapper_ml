[Intro]
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Uh
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Uh
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Uh
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac

[Verse 1]
Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for?
So I can roll around in a RAV4? Never that
Cadillac pimped out, fish bowl, true vogues
Fifteens, but I had to go and get two mo'
Whassup, get buck, shake junt killa
DJ booth with the pole in the middle
For the edge of the rest to go flash up a bitch
See how far these vegetables get us
Pour up, the show up, the focus
The doors ain't typical when they get open, hol' up
You ain't never been sky high
Swear I coulda died when I hopped out my ride
Like four or five times, no parachute
Bungee jump for the loot
Hock a loogie out the roof, what I feel like
Porn on the screen, two hoes on the scene tongue kissin'
You would think my whip dyke
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—too early for the hook
Not sure if it's the sawed-off pump or the bass in the trunk that keep a nigga shook
Careful no crook, tell a bitch, “Look.”
How I work the wheel and the crisis
Police behind us my index was grindin' her pussy like rhyme with no timin'
I think I'm nicest of all (All, all, all, all)
That's the way I feel, bitch! Crawl (Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl)
Why you showing your grill, bitch? We off (Off, off, off, off)
Our way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace from somewhere unique
Have no fear, uh

[Hook]
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Fuck yo' whip, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Fuck yo' whip, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!

[Verse 2]
Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for?
So I can roll around with a nympho? Yessir
Twenty five lighters on my dresser, the best of
Versace, Versace, Versace, my bezel
The bass and the treble will beat, ho
Komodo with the four-door when creepin', slow
I pull up on the high side, God give me high five
Every time I holla, " I thank you, Lawd"
Jesus please, don't let the jackers try to take what's mine
Hate to have to black out, reach in the dash to the Lac, ‘fo the Act Right
Cause a nigga act like I'ma just back down
And I'ma put some vogues on these toes bitch
I blew the back out the trunk with the fifth wheel slump
It's some neon that's red, that's my old shit
But this some cold shit
That my granddaddy wish he could have drove in, then passed down
So in honor of Zebby, I bring a ho down like a levee
When I slab 'round in this glass house
See me in it, it was easy pimpin', 'fore you even finish trick or treating trippin', she wasn't even with it, she was outside the Lac tryna ease in it
She might fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)
It ain't really that high, bitch crawl (crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl)
Why you showing your grill, bitch? We off (off, off, off, off, off)
Our way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace from somewhere unique
Have no fear, uh!

[Hook]
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Fuck yo' whip, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Fuck yo' whip, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!

[Outro]
Slabbin’ ‘round, my windows down, you hear the sound
That sonic boom, that ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bass
That shake your baby momma crib
Pardon me if I phone home 4000 miles away from where you at
If you ain't holdin' back I can take your whip
C-A-D-I-Double-L-A-C-T-I-C-A
C-A-D-I-Double-L-A-C-T-I-C-A
C-A-D-I-Double-L-A-C-T-I-C-A
C-A-D-I-Double-L-A-C-T-I-C-A, K-R-I-T forever

[Skit: Big K.R.I.T. & crew + employee]
Hold up, nigga
Nigga, hit that new spot real quick called Mo' Grease than Beef nigga, see what they hittin' on round this bitch
I heard they got some fried biscuits too, though
Yeah, they be giving them hoes away though, I don’t want no given-away biscuit

Yeah, man, what happenin', welcome to Mo Grease than Beef, what can I get for you, man?

I want a #1, my nigga, but, uh… I don’t see what it is on the menu man, run that shit down for a player real quick

Oh, you want the #1? Shit, well, the #1 come with two sides—shit, you can get some poverty or some famine. And bruh, if you don’t want that famine, nahmsayin, you can always get some low self esteem—or a biscuit

Mmm, nah, I’m good on that, my nigg’, I’m good though…

Say, bruh, I know you wanna take some food home to your baby mamma. You can go and get her the Plan B meal—it come with a free DNA test, two bitchass niggas. Shit, or you can get a biscuit. Best part of all this, it’s already prepared for you, bruh. This shit been sittin’ here all day. Waitin’ on you
