[Intro: Kobe]
What, wait, hold up, pass
Time to roll another bag
Time to take a puff, pass
Let it out, Aftermath
D-R, D-R-E
And all my niggas please stand
All my bitches please stand
Here we, here we go a–

[Verse 1]
I hit the ground running, not a second lost
If nothing else, know this hustle you gon’ respect dog
Or get checked by the best, don’t get me upset
‘Cause I got more of what you saw that ain’t been seen yet
So it’s whatever homie, try me never homie
Talking down on the crown, you know better homie
I’m so surprised that you guys really disappoint
Let’s arrange it, I’m available any day you want it
He got an issue don’t he? Well he can get it, bruh
What he running ‘round hating through the city for?
A lot of niggas play, but I ain’t with it, bruh
That’s all I’m finna say, with that I’m finished, bruh
It’s time to see about niggas with diaria mouth
Catch amnesia when I ask what all that be about
So all you dick-suckers, just know I’m rich suckers
For twenty summers I been doing plenty numbers, nigga

[Hook: Kobe]
The game fucked up and she almost gone
One last time I’ll get mine and I’m gone
Bringing rehab to the street blocks
Bang it out your system this is Detox

[Bridge]
Oh, look at me when the beat drop
It’s on again, I welcome you to the Detox, oh
I’ve been waiting for the perfect time to hit the block serve this

[Verse 2]
They want to turn the undefeated to the underdog
Only concerned with money, I’m paying none of y’all
I overcame all odds, I ain't run at all
Everything under the sun, I done done it all
I want it all, and I’ma go get it
Even if it mean I got to take on the whole city
I’ma stay busy, chase that billi
Stack those so high, hoes get dizzy
Make my bank match my ambition
On a mission tryna spend what I can’t take with me
Listen, no bullshit homie real talk
And you ain’t gotta like me I’ma still ball
Even if I choose to take a couple years off
Upon my return, I’ma still floss
Even harder though, so let the robber know
“Hey haters do you thing, got my shine regardless though”
When it seem like it’s over, I’ma make a wave
By whatever means and that’s what make him Dre
My heart consumed with determination got to say
Let them Bogart, I’ma go hard all day

[Hook: Kobe]
The game fucked up and she almost gone
One last time I’ll get mine and I’m gone
Bringing rehab to the street blocks
Bang it out your system this is Detox

[Bridge]
Oh, look at me when the beat drop
It’s on again, I welcome you to the Detox, oh
I’ve been waiting for the perfect time to hit the block serve this
