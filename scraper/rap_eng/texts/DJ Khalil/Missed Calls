[Hook: Johnny Venus]
Girl, I ain't no starâ€”I just ain't from round here
My pilot told me I'll go far, if I stay from 'round here
Hell, I'm so good at missing calls, bitch, I'm perfect this year
And I suggest you trace your scars, if you get lost my dear

[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
Nigga, I can't tell if I'm dreaming
Lord, forgive me if I think I'm in charge
But the snakes in the grass are starting to get smart
And the snake in my pants is starting to get hard
And I'm fucking everything with two legs and a heart
And some ass, and some titties, and an ATM card
Fetish for my flaws, and I lust for my scars
And this broke nigga dick guarantee I won't starve
Well I suppose, that you suppose, using hoes, is getting old
And you oppose, that maybe I, should grown on up, and iron clothes
And find some hope, find some work, and write in cursive
Been a flirter since my birth, they wrapped me up so i ain't fuck the nurse
Too numb to react when you struck a nerve
So I hits the bitch in a circle jerk
With me, myself, and my demon semen
Canine teeth got me feline feenin'
Hold up, rewind, make a beeline, feel like a bald eagle chiefin'
I ain't even breathin'
I'm a motherfuckin' ghost you can tell cause I flow
And I lose my head without even bleeding
Fuck what a motherfucker thought, that they knew about us
We got the juice and we keep on squeezing
Like drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Hold up me cup, me take a sip
Hold up me pinky, me think me rich
Me being foolish, me no pay rent
Me look at roomies, all of em pissed
Eviction notice, taped to the fridge
Thank the most high, me no got kids
They would be cannibals, eating your kids

[Hook: Johnny Venus]
(I told her)
Girl I ain't no star, I just ain't from round here
My pilot told me I'll go far, if I stay from round here
(You see me in that bentley, don't start to acting friendly)
Hell I'm so good at missing calls, bitch I'm perfect this year
(When the room's spinning and the who's who's in it)
And I suggest you trace your scars, if you get lost my dear
(Aye you ain't on the list, now the A-list enlisted)

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
I done had all night to think about this
I done had all life to think about this
Get a plate with strife and too South for shit
Let me click my heels and toss on them grits
Let a nigga hold five 'til my grinder click
I done had all life to think about this
All y'all judging, handful of Bics
I done passed out twice and I ain't been hit
Shit I might be blessed let me right this left
Navigate this ride, I really don't need an apartment
Line like who bought the fifth
Hoop out the lobes and who had got kids
Let me get that little piece together
Pen start on my thesis sweater?
? Head start on my nieces sweater
Money thrown on my chicken, man pizza whatever
Gotta go gotta go gotta leave you better
Grew up where the leaves are wetter
And I hope and I pray when you read this letter
That the seeds don't catch up to your knees already
Cause all my dogs good
They running, they running don't run out the clock
They living in a false hood for damn way too long, man, check out the stock
But that's cool, y'all can keep on sipping out this narcissistic pool
And I'ma sit outside that shit just like the old dudes
Said I'ma sit outside that shit just like Kukoc do
And watch you jump hula hoops to satisfy your sudoku

[Hook: Johnny Venus]
Said baby girl I ain't no star, I just ain't from round here
(White walls and wood floors)
My pilot told me I'll go far, if I stay from round here
(You, you see me at the bar don't, don't go to hollerin' about no shots)
Hell I'm so good at missing calls, bitch I'm perfect this year
(don't fuck with me)
And I suggest you trace your scars, if you get lost my dear
(one check out the window, people watching, slow up)
