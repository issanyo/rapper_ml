All I know (What?) is who I am (Yeah!)
I don't know (What?) who I'm not (No!)
I just came through to do me (Yeah, yeah!)
And I'm asking you (to what?)
Show some love!


[Verse 1 - (Lloyd Banks - Trouble On My Mind Freestyle)]

Screws all in the Bentley, get the Doc (Doc)
Ain't no guarantee, ain't trust her, got a pistol for a partner
The way I pop shit hits the competition like a choppa
Tell a bitch quick, don't listen to me, listen to your sponsor
Mr. Poppa in the car, the parking lot ain't far
Take her down to Hollywood, drop right on the star
Heart breaker motherfucker, every night is a scar
You niggas so far behind I can minus a bar
At the bomb of the market you a target
Self inflicted pain 'till I find someone to spar with
My style dip in caine that's why I come off like a martian
Got a shoe, get my Beam, red carpeted the apartment
My picture's next to cool, im running of an AC
48 hour maximum, she gone on day 3
Making more on an accident, im back in KC
Ain't a motherfucker matching, watch me stack in HD

All I know (What?) is who I am (Yeah!)
I don't know (What?) who I'm not (No!)
I just came through to do me (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2 - (Dr. Dre - The Wash ft. Snoop Dogg )]

Back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is expected and I'm feeling that demand
Los Ang', broad day gunnin'
That ain't no earthquake it's just Dre comin'
If this shit ain't played, the party ain't bumpin'
If I don't show up, the ho's ain't fuckin' (Real talk!)
Cali sunshine, come visit
Just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it
All Star league, you writing Benjamins
I handles my business, fuck fake niggas
I sell game a quarter million a track
The good Doc back with a brand new sack
Shit's wrong, money gone, I blast
Out of town, out of bounds, no pass
Runnin' up, talkin shit, get smashed
Shoot first, ask questions last
