[Verse 1]
I’m a lone lost wandering soul tryna find where I belong
And I’m lookin’ for a place where it feels alright to be wrong
Just a loud-mouth, hard-headed, fool-hearted stubborn old son of a gun
Chip off the old block with a chip on my shoulder that weighs a ton
All I know for sure is that nothin’ is forever
And all that matters is how we get along together
Life gets harder every day that I get older
Hope I figure out why I’m here before it’s over

[Chorus 1]
'Cause we’re here today and gone tomorrow
We’re here today and gone tomorrow
Lead the way, never follow
Here today, gone tomorrow

[Verse 2]
I been stuck at home alone on nights when no one calls
And I’ve had nights where I can take my pick or have them all
And I had those days where I search my pockets for a nickel and a dime
And I’ve had those days where tryna make money was a waste of my time
I’ve had shiny brand new leather patent loafers
And I’ve had torn up bruised old teddies handed over
All I know for sure is that nothin’ is forever
And all that matters is how we get along together

[Chorus 2]
'Cause we’re here today and gone tomorrow
We’re here today and gone tomorrow
Through the joy and the sorrow
We’re here today and gone tomorrow

[Verse 3]
We ain’t promised tomorrow
So I’m gon’ live for today
Been from 5 star hotels to cockroach motels
And rode day-whole drive retails to thrift store re-sales
I’ve had chauffeured town cars to an old broken down car
It ain’t what happens to you it’s what you do about it

[Chorus 1]
'Cause we’re here today and gone tomorrow
We’re here today and gone tomorrow
Lead the way, never follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Here today (hey)
Here today (hey)
Here today (hey)
Here today (hey)
