[Hook: Kobe]
This is the gun, this is the war
This is the life we fightin' for
This is the block where we hustle to survive
So this is the goal, the end of our life
This is the feeling of hunger inside
Oh my lord, what have I done this time
It's one Blood, it's one Crip
It's two guns, and two clips

[Verse 1: THURZ]
Shots rang out, the block better duck
Daddy was a [br?], [?] was a blood
'Nuff' man 'a die from the slug of a foolish man
Time never stops, world keeps spinning
Folks'll keep living, born in the gang shit, but dude never gave in
Money was a hoopa, 'bout to be a Hoosier
Starting two-guard, hit the winning shot against Crenshaw
Celebrating with some groupies, trying to unsnap the bra
Letterman jackets, smiling for the dips
Wrong territory with some blood thirsty Crips
Black hoody walks up, navy blue chucks
Loc'in up, throwin' up a set, and what not
Shermed out, eyes half closed burnt out
With the burner on his hip, that he gripped and pulled out
Dude recognized him as his life flashed his eyes
The same nigga that lost his son in a drive-by
Executed by his older brother, killed his two year old son and grazed his baby mother

[Hook]

[Verse 2: THURZ]
You know no bad deed goes unheard of
The Blood, his older brother caught news of murder
Gassed, his whole family feeling the turmoil
Revenge, the death of the closest nigga to you
Grabbed one gun, one clip, keys to the Chevy whip
Accelerating through the street, shoulder with a chip
Hollow points, I let 'em rip, bodies droppin' gettin' hit
Karma coming quick from killin' that damn kid
Got the killer sittin' on the hood of his car
Lookin' like he was waiting, prepared for the war
Car in park, hopped out ready to tan
Niggas, but he squeezed the trigger, the gun jammed
The Crip just laughed, as if the scene was planned
Cocked and aimed at the Blood with his right hand
You shoot my bitch, I kill your loved one
Nigga, you kill my son, you meet my gun
An eye for an eye, a Blood for a Crip
The streets of L.A. ain't made for no bitch
