[Verse: Nick Grant]
Yeah...
Uh, let's get it
Classy, but nasty
Thumb all in her ass cheeks
Move fastly
Sinning while we listening to this Al Green
So glad we, touchin'
I fuck you like you had bad week
80's baby, wavy
You'll think I'm hailing a taxi
Correction, I'm so wavy
This should be sponsored by Max B
The black Leo DiCaprio, tuxedo, Great Gatsby, exactly

[Hook: Miloh Smith]
I'm coming home again...
Baby don't forget the rose and gin...
You gon' have to play this song again
Oooh 'cause it's on again, it's on...
Oh, I'm coming home again...
Baby don't forget the rose and gin...
You gon' have to play this song again
Oooh 'cause it's on again, it's on...on
It's on...on
It's on...on

[Outro: Nick Grant]
Well alright...
The wonderful sounds that you are listening to
Are being brought to you by the beautiful people of Culture Republic
Where dreams come true, ya' dig that?
It's 'bout time we bring the real back
One-of-a-kind, so soulful
I have the ever so talented Miloh Smith with me ladies and gentlemen
You know it only gets better
I understand you got a little devil in you baby but...
To not agree with us would be a sin
Sit back and enjoy the show
Don't forget the rose and gin
This is The Return of the Cool...
Let me hear that back...
