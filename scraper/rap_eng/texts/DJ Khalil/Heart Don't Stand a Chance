[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Verse 1]
See, I be catchin' you starin', be careful
The idle mind is a dangerous place to be left in
But keep your eyes on me
Yeah, your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
Your knees can't hold your legs
Your feet just want to pace
The eyes keep me all in a trance
Let me ask you
Would you leave it all in the back of your head
Or all in the palm of my hand?
Ain't nobody holding you back
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance
Your knees just want to break
Your eyes keep me all in a trance
And let me ask you
I know the approach is so far from what you're used to
But you know it
And do I hold a candle to the last one over your moon?
Baby, of course I do
And I'm not closing my tab
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Verse 2]
Two-step in the corridor
Spinning the greatest hits of Hall & Oates
Open of chronic smoke
I know my time will flee
But your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
The moment is all that we have
My meter should be up by the half
A ticket is the least of my cares
So let me ask you
Am I dreaming?
Mind on a tip of a cloud
Or is it real as the stone in your crown?
Say, ain't nobody towing my Jag
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance
I'm waiting for the white flag
You're talking with the blunt in your hand
And won't you pass that?
I know, in the morning
The sunlight cover your wounds
But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew
Baby, your course, I flew
But I'm not over what we had
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Skit]
I remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was
And looking down and seeing my body spinning around in the white water
