Verse 1:
Young kid,Age 9,Wanted to rhyme
Yeezy dropped dropout which was high at the time
But his lines were too personal to come from the person
So at 9, I chose to right mine
Little youngin' with dreams so vivid like HD picture
Put 100 on flow,Bro I can't kick witcha
Cause I'm tryna make it out of this hole
Plus the rap life need a little bit more soul
Selling souls for bugattis,Fake like illuminati
Probably never saw a Glock in life,Nor caught a body
Copy every little thing he seen on TV
Laid on it on wax,Then tried to sell the CD

Hook:
Down (Quality Falling)

Verse 2:
808 Kick, Boom Bap shit
Gasoline Flow near a lit matchstick
Matched it,The power of early Nas on his Illmatic
Causing havoc,Where's the casket?
Telepathic,Conversive verses speak to you
Open old would so people I bleed for you
Seek for you,A better voice for tomorrow
Bring better a blueprint of seeing through the sorrow
Arron Afflalo,Shot for success
Spit a witty metaphor & then I start to progress
Address my flaws,Aggress the cause
Make these silly minstrel niggas recess faux pas cause

Hook:
Down (Quality Falling)
