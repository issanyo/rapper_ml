[Bass and Guitar by Chin Injeti]

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Awakened from my slumber by the thunder, lightning clapping
Raining on my window pane and praying I make something happen
A preacher's prophecies never bothered me when I was younger
Sitting on my Grandma's lap, as she cried I often wondered
What was her tears for? Could it be for my grandfather?
Or maybe she felt for me cause I'll see more of those cold tomorrows
Then she see the world will up and turn on me
Cause the morals that she often spoke were meant for 1923
I fall asleep off in her arms, a Psalm was spoken
The Lord is surely my shepherd, he lead me to the water
Thought that often stuck with me
Amongst the wolves that run the streets
Out here paying dues to lose
I pray your angels come for me
A non-believer I never have or could be
Lord give me time to peep the signs I should see
Sipping got me feeling like a player riding clean
Bending corners hoping I might find my saviour on the curb
I rarely go to Church
False prophets rocking Prada so I rarely feel the word
Jezebels lurking in the pews on the first
Preacher's weaker than the deacon cause it's hard to fight the urge
It's hard to live and serve when you on the Devil's turf
Sell your soul for the low with no sense of what it's worth
Don't get it twisted, I ain't no saint, I ain't no pastor
But prayer ain't just for cloudy days and natural disasters
Aware of what comes after, I bet you ain't for sure
I was warned that Heaven ain't the only place to go
I'm doing what I can cause there really ain't much time
I leave this in the Lord hands
I'm tired of crying
Yeah, Krizzle

[Hook: Ashthon Jones]
(Man down)
Hopin', prayin' sayin' I can’t turn (back now)
He will find you, this world will blind you
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hopin', prayin', sayin' you can’t turn (back now)
Help is just one prayer away
Don’t be afraid to say
“Mayday”

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Am I biased? I been pious put my nose up in the pews
Like Paul I bear good news
They think I'm pall-bearing
My message sounds like death to these hearers as they perish
Scaring to think we on the brink of death
But no one stops to look for answers on what happens next
Got a couple scriptures from my grandma
Sayings from a preacher
But can't live out these standards that we heard it takes to reach 'em
But when I look at Jesus, He lived the life I couldn't
Suffered for my crime so I wouldn't
I used to have to sneak into movies cause I couldn't afford to pay
Explain to me how someone paid my way
When I hear K.R.I.T. confessin', I respect him
Cause most of us be lyin' like our lives don't need perfecting
Nothing that we can muster, nothing that we can change
Admittin' that we're imperfect, offending God with our games
Look I'm just being honest so don't take me for no lame
I seen it for myself, I'm a product of this thing
Now I found true religion, and it's not inside a denim
And them overpriced shades have never given us vision
Let's go

[Hook: Ashthon Jones]
(Man down)
Hopin', prayin' sayin' I can’t turn (back now)
He will find you, this world will blind you
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hopin', prayin', sayin' you can’t turn (back now)
Singing what you know so urgent
Keep calling
Help is just one prayer away
Don’t be afraid to say yeah yeah
“Mayday”
Help is just one prayer away
Don’t you be afraid to say
“Mayday”
