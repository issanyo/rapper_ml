[Verse 1]
Grab your shotgun, cock it back
Shoot the sun until the sky is black
Now I shall hope that the sun got rhythm
Cause he gon’ dance when that music hit him
Like bang, bang, bang, darkness fall
In the nighttime I’m camouflage

[Bridge]
Now I, I, I, I don’t know who you are
But girl I wanna know if you can move like this
And I, I, I, I, don’t know if you’re gonna tell me
But I wanna know what your name is
And you gonna make me fall in love with you, with you
Keep on shakin’ your hips

[Chorus]
Now can you do this? (Yea, I can do that)
Can you do this? (Yea, I can do that)
Can you do this? (Yea, I can do that)
Can you do this? (Yea, I can do that)
I know you think that you can move
But can you groove the way I groove?

[Verse 2]
Grab your slingshot, find a stone
Shoot the moon until the night is gone
Now I should hope that moon got rhythm
Cause he gon’ rock when my stone hit him
Like boom, boom, boom, let me shine
He should know that the day is mine

[Bridge] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now why you standing on the wall
Did you come to dance at all?
I’m watching you girl, watching me
You got moves, then let me see

[Bridge 2]
Can you do this? (Can you do this lady?)
Can you do this? (Can you move like I do?)
Can you do this? (Can you shake, shake it mama?)
Can you do this? (Can you break it on down?)

[Chorus]
