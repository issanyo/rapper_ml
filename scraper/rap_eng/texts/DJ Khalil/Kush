[Intro: Sly]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now, this that puff, puff, pass shit
Cheech and Chong glass shit
Blunts to the head, kush pillows, no mattress
Speedboat traffic, bitches automatic
Cross that line, fuck around and get yo' ass kicked
We roll shit that burn slow as fuckin' molasses
Probably won't pass it, smoke it 'til the last hit
Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch
Andre, 3001, another classic
Go ahead, ask him, bitches, 'bout how I be smokin' out
Party all night, yeah, it's goin' down
Order rounds, we smoke a quarter pound of that good stuff
Oh yeah, we smokin' all night
Yeah, puff puff pass that shit right here
Nigga, better than my last batch
Caramel complexion and her ass fat
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)

[Hook: Akon]
I know you tryin' to get high
Type of shit that have you leanin' sideways
Take a whiff of this suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want that bom bom biggy?
Holla at my niggie right here in L.A.
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale!)

[Bridge: Sky "Pyper" Jordan]
Hold up, wait a minute!
Let me put some kush up in it!
Hold up, wait a minute!
Let me put some kush up in it!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Still I am tighter than the pants on will.i.am
Backthrow, back still, I have a pound in my backpack
Next to where the swishas at
Smokin' presidential; got some bubba, I give me that
Need it for my cataracts
Four hoes and I'm the pimp in my Cadillac
You can tell them Cali back, matter fact
They'll know this ain't 'dro, get a whiff of that
No, it ain't no seeds in my sack
You ain't never gotta ask, dog
What he smokin' on? Shit, kush 'til my mind gone
What you think I'm on? Eyes low, I'm blown
High as a motherfucker, there ain't no question 'bout it
Niggas say, "Smoke me out," yeah, I really doubt it
I'm Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded
So if you want it, you know your nigga homie
You can put it in a zag or a blunt and get blunted
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale!)

[Hook: Akon]
I know you tryin' to get high
Type of shit that have you leanin' sideways
Take a whiff of this suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want that bom bom biggy?
Holla at my, niggie, right here in L.A.
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale!)

[Outro: Sly]
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make yo' ass choke
Hold up, wait a minute, you can go put it back
‘Cause what you got in your sack, boy, it ain't that
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make yo' ass choke
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale!)
