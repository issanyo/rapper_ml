[Hook 2x]
Ocean views, small circle it's a chosen few
I wrote it down and I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true

[Verse 1]
Blessings, bitches in my section
Young with all this money, I'm obsessive, weapons
Turning off y'all extras
Turning off this bullshit direction
Turning off my grind
Waking up to mo' pressure
But it's all in yo' mind, so I never feel pressured
Knew it's all in due time, now hunnid stacking like Tetris
Hustle hard is my message, then double back and get extras
Know I spaz when I cash it
Yellow Bone, white Lexus, all black tint, two white cups, fat gold chains, pride, Texas
I'm just young and I'm reckless, I'm just on for my section
I'm just out here on top speed with my top down and I'm revinâ€™
I don't know about Hell, I don't know about Heaven
All I know is 'bout right now and this lifestyle is interesting
Iced down in my section, I just write down these confessions
Niggas died to get life around me, I guess that I'm an exception
Blessings

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm in these streets with my Cuban on
In my Benz with my music on
Old friends like what have you been on
Shit, I've been on my grind
I ain't usually home, focused, I ain't using phones
Lately I've been using song to get my point across
While niggas 'round me lose it all, but that's your point to toss
I guess I always knew to ball
And as this world revolves I'm cracking 'cuz I do my job
Look, from fucking hood rats to fucking stars
Spending all cash, to sliding cards, it's the definition of living large
Smoking top flight in the biggest cars
Told you '08 this shit was ours, getting this cake, yeah nigga then getting more
Look at this world young nigga, this really yours
Nigga this really mine, my niggas is really for it, them buildings is really high, them cars is really foreign and all I see is...

[Verse 3]
Yeah, early morning off that flight though
We gon' go hard then get right, bro
It seemed simple, that's not life though
10 years later I'm alright though
Look, these niggas act like they don't like dough
They be mad cuz niggas shine bright though
Look, I got a Ruger and a Bryco
But I'ma let you pick which way tonight go
I got my dough right, plus the right dough
I mean it's legal, pay taxes to them white folks
My precedure, stay crackin 'till my life's low
Then when I die, Blue rag around my rifle
Hunnid thousand in my coffin, that's just life though
Play a Stevie Wonder song, smoke some flight, bro
Crack a pint of Actavis then pour in some Sprite, bro
Until that day I'm walking toward what's in my sights though
'Cuz all I see is...
