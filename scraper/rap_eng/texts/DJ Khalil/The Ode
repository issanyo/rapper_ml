[Verse 1]
They ask about you in my interviews
How could I love you, still really not be that into you
Too many niggas around you, you gotta pick and choose
If ever not consistent with you, that’s how niggas lose
This older woman she’s well in her forties
She did everything for me, I fucked her as a shorty
Right on my granny floor, I swear I used to love her
It ain’t that common that a bitch like her would turn corporate
She’s in the club with them youngin’s, she got some ignorant ways
But they don’t really care for her she out here getting paid
She fuck with niggas and bitches she got options for days
I try to impress her and say some shit Rakim would say
She throwing curves, she changed the pitch 
I want a piece, gave me a sample and it made me rich
Girl if you never taught me anything, you taught me this
You best get out of your feelings it’s all about the hits
You make me sick, I wrote letters to you
I hung your pictures on the wall I was jealous of dude
No they don’t know you like I do baby tell em’ the truth
That you won’t always feel this way, the inevitable, I want better for you
I seen em come and go, you treated niggas like freaks
Trust I already know, know that you been cheating on me
Feel up your body of work, tell me where you wanna meet
Either we out on the corner or up in studio b, don’t ever leave

[Sonyae Elise – Hook]
I let a lot of niggas in who ain’t deserve me
I let him touch all on my crown, it wasn’t worthy
You a fool if you think I don’t know the difference
I swear you everything that I was ever missing

I let a lot of niggas in who ain’t deserve me
I let him feel all on my crown, it wasn’t worthy
You a fool if you think I don’t know the difference
It’s like you everything that I was ever missing

[Verse 2]
No tatts on me and her white homies love it
I make em comfortable so they cut the budget
Bitch I hate you, I never knew your other side was rotten
When all the lawyers cut in my business, they outta pocket
When you other niggas hot man I too could be forgotten 
Still I’m ahead of my line just trying to stay out the gossip
She done been around, and I’m hip to the hoe hoppin’
Born in the Bronx still she bounce out of pockets of Compton
From the go, even so far down below, she seems conniving 
Them country niggas kept most her interest I’m being modest
Not just cause I’m from the south, I was just here on the couch 
Watching the awards then you offered to buy my mother’s house (damn)
You social media with your shit, what’s your angle
You running circles round my mind I check for halos
Clothes minded still open doors with wire hangers
Until the next time I write you don’t be no stranger 
 
"Love of my life” (in unison)

[Sonyae Elise]
The perfect wife I got your back
Cause I’ma get you this money and ain’t no strings attached 
Fuck feelings and emotions put all that to the side
We on a mission stay focused, its bigger fish to fry
Eight, eleven, seven, four 
Can’t teach a bitch new tricks
I’ve seen and done it raw
I’m rotten to the core
In and out of foreign doors
Making love on marble floors
Been around the aye aye aye 
New Jersey Singapore
Never loved a nigga more, damn I said it
Gotta share me with the world but I’ma give you credit
I ain’t been in, love, love, love, love, love like this 
Since, Nas and Lauryn ruled the world righteous
My, sweet as morning do I fuck with you
I know your heart is pure, I know your words is true
I know I got a past, but shit you got one too
Don’t judge the way I got here did what I had to do
You should be happy that I sacrificed so much for you
I take your trust, make you reflect and write a song or two
I got you fresh as fuck and out here living comfortable 
No matter how you tell your side I did it all for you

[Sonyae Elise – Hook]
I let a lot of niggas in who ain’t deserve me
I let him touch all on my crown, it wasn’t worthy
You a fool if you think I don’t know the difference
I swear you everything that I was ever missing

I let a lot of niggas in who ain’t deserve me
I let him feel all on my crown, it wasn’t worthy
You a fool if you think I don’t know the difference
It’s like you everything that I was ever missing
