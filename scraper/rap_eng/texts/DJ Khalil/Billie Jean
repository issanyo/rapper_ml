[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round, yeah
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But people always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me got be careful who you love
Be careful what you do cause the lie becomes the truth, hey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Oh no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me be careful of what you do, what you do, what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful who you love
Be careful what you do cause the lie becomes the truth, hey yeah
