Breathe the streets without a name
These burning clouds don't always look the same
Midnight moon you are my thunder
I am the glass in which you wonder
Still I keep falling on this

Heartbreak in love
I am losing myself in you
This heart heartbrake in love
In my head you know I'm holding
Holding myself for you
This heart
This old heart
This old heart will stay for you
This old heart
This old heart will stay open for you

Stay a thousand passing days
I see you break the jealousy it waits
Morning May until September
You are all that I remember
Still I keep falling on this

Heartbrake in love
I am losing myself in you
This heart heartbreak in love
In my head you know I'm holding
Holding myself for you
This heart
This old heart
This old heart will stay for you

This old heart
This old heart
This old heart will stay for you

This heart heartbreak in love
In my head you know I'm holding
Holding myself for you
This heart
This old heart
This old heart will stay for you

This old heart
This old heart
This old heart will stay for you

This old heart
This old heart
This old heart will stay for you
