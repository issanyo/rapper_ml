[Asheru]
Ashane brought the Nomo, Nomo brought the word
Which is Asheru, the crew is Unspoken Heard
Wes Jackson had the vision, and brought it to fruition
With a little hard work, perserverance and intuition
Seven Heads is the label, free to just to be
The envy of emcees, my man trust me
What once was a logo, is now in my bloodstream
People always ask, yo Ash what does it mean?
And I tell em you, yo we represent the masses
A herd of folk, that came to set it on your asses
That's why I'm teaching classes, life is my syllabus
Take out what you can, cause no one will deliver us
Jack shit, we moving backwards, in a downward spiral
The rest of ya'll is swimming in denial
Meanwhile, like we told ya'll it's about time
Better make way for me and mine

Chorus
We gotta get what's rightfully our's like the Maroons done, Soon Come
We wanna stand tall and shine bright like the noon sun, Soon Come
The time for shucking and jiving and playing the coon is done, Soon Come
We live by the principle of the snare, bass, and drum, Soon Come

[Blue Black]
Fear ain't a factor it's the pain that's real
That's why brothers run from guns made of stainless steel
You can hear, shrieks of horror against the night
From the helpless without enough defense to fight
Children grow too fast without a strong foundation
They ain't built to last, they reject their past
Cut class and the generation gap is vast
So they scared to ask, it's a difficult task
We gotta, unlearn the lie, and unveil the mask
Teach em how to be thorough, and not come half-assed
Everything that we want is right behind the glass
Yo it yours for the taking, hit em, full blast

Chorus
We stand face to face with hardship ya'll, we never run, Soon Come
Going out to all of my Cinnabunz and Wimbledons, Soon Come
We wanna welcome you all into the new millennium, Soon Come
Remember Sankofa, and don't forget where you come from, Soon Come

[Asheru]
Im 24 years old, molded by my peers and family
Keep em close cause no one else can handle me
Some might find it strange the way I change moods
One minute from the next, go from happy to vexed
With no prompt, I'd be foolish to think there's no comp
With brothers outside my show standing 'round like "wanna rhyme"?
Well Hip Hop is what I do
You think a brother can't do this simply for the art, but I do
You put this in a capusule for years, because it's timeless
These rhymes ain't only nice, son I'm killing em with kindness
And you won't find this side by side with the spineless
Watered down pop shit, bleached out and rhymeless
You can go and get my brother Wes to co-sign this
Seven Heads stay in the plus and not the minus
Bascially meaning I got security like Linus
To keep pressing on, never looking back behind us

Chorus
We gotta take what's rightfully ours like the Maroons done, Soon Come
We wanna stand tall and shine bright like the noon sun, Soon Come
The time for shucking and jiving and playing the coon is done, Soon Come
We live by the principle of the snare, bass, and drum, Soon Come

Truth, balance, harmony, love, life, equality, all of the above
Moutnains we gotta climb, are all equal to one , Soon Come, we Soon Come
Truth, balance, harmony, love, life, equality, all of the above
Moutnains we gotta climb, still equal to one , Soon Come, Soon Come
