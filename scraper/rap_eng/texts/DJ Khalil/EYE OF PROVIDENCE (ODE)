Eye of Providence

"Your children are not your children
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself
They come through you but they are not from you
And though they are with you they belong not to you
You can give them your love but not your thoughts
They have their own thoughts
They have their own thoughts
You can house their bodies but not their souls
For their souls dwell in a place of tomorrow
Which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams
You can try to be like them
But you can not make them just like you..."

So true in this life
You better change
Rest in Peace
Amy, Whitney
And Etta James
The spirit and soul
In this music
It forever rings
You can put that on everything
Produce, create innovate
At the highest level
D-Pros is back
Pimp smack these devils
Snatch the pitchforks
To throw them off the boardwalks
The Empire of the Sun
About to burn down New York
Now being broke
Is the root of all evil
And fools sell heroin and dope
To their own people
I don't get it
I just spit the truth bitch
Think not?
You out your mind
Newt Gingrich

Who thinks black kids need janitor jobs
That’s bad to the bone marrow
Young pharaoh with tarot cards
Poetic genetic
Manipulation of custodial Gods
I ain't know Prosper got bars,
Plus
He know each soul is bound by the stars
Burn the mic
Hey, leave the steel charred
Oops upside your head
We just beat all the odds
What’s Beef?
Jan Brewer
With head Nubian in charge?
Ha!
What a mirage
Your'e Bamboozled
Get out the trap already
Lil’ thugs
Hold your gat steady
Start the revolution
Rest in Peace to Makaveli
