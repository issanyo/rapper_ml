[Hook- Sabi/Legacy]
Born to make it alone from the skids
Don’t take it for more than it is
Cuz we’re tough kids
We are tough kids
You already know, you already know
Come on
You already know, you already know
Come on
You already know, you already know
Come on
You already know, you already know

[Verse 1- Legacy]
Don’t be sayin’ they gon’ help me and still be bluffing
So if you ain’t gonna hate on me, don’t tell me nothing
Heard you lyin’ on me, little man, better tell the truth
I’m not your girl, but I am still ahead of you
Too cool to care, screw new suits for douche dudes
Rule blind ref to the def, what do you do
Testing me trusting me, you lucky I’m for you
If hip hop is dead then I must be immortal
While I was on the road spending nights with dancers
You was at home talking ’bout how tight my pants is
They throwin’ all these shots and they think it’s gonna rattle me
My haters Pepto Bismol brings shit outta me
Like ever since a kid I knew the top was where I had to be
The sky is the limit and I’m makin’ fun of gravity
I’ll fight it on me with no sword maybe with no gun
Try to stop me, you won’t make it
Man, maybe it was cuz I was

Born to make it alone from the skids
Don’t take it for more than it is
Cuz we’re tough kids
We are tough kids
We are tough kids
Here I come

[Verse 2- Ben J]
I’m a tough kid proven my actions are foolish
I spit dumb bars like boy that’s stupid
What is he ruthless have a brain use it
Havin’ an illusion I’ma go how you get
You better watch out if you walk the streets
Cuz if you ain’t got money then talk is cheap
You wanna walk with me talk with me bark with me sparkle me
Boy I know I’m better cuz my cheddar got calories
Got my own squad ran my name like they marry me
We the best now and there is really no comparedy
All ya do is better me like bowin’ on the floor
I’m a tough kid code name Kids Next Door
I don’t take no shit, we don’t take no shit
All my niggas on my team they don’t take no shit
Bring ’em out cuz I’m goin’ in like WOW
You niggas act so surprised a beat down

[Hook- Sabi/Legacy]
Born to make it alone from the skids
Don’t take it for more than it is
Cuz we’re tough kids
We are tough kids
We are tough kids
