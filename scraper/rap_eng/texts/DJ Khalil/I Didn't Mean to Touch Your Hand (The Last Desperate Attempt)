I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque

I really hadn't looked in the mirror in a while
Didn't notice that I was an inferior style
Thank you for bringing back the fear
Hadn't been on the depressive tip for the better part of the year
I let this MC thing get to my head
I forgot that I had wanted to be dead
You were the only girl that guessed that I was a phony
And that I only owned loneliness
I'm sorry that my touch felt like clutch or a crutch
Or other ugly things of the such
For a little minute I had thought that I was in the middle
Of beginning to play this game with you
I'd actually win it
Wow how could I actually thought that now in your honor
I bow thank you for being so dope
Thank you for seeing no hope
Uncomfortable zone your boyfriend wants me to be alone
I'm calling the mystical experiences
Mental and unhealthy psychical appearances
I run a dozen or a thousand yards
I know that it never was in the cards
You can't be a king when you're a two
I can't really sing this in front of you
Because your royal flush
Has defeated my loyalty mush
The thing that I see with my eyes
Or this rush underwater and yet a seamless crush
I miss you so much
I miss you so much
I miss you sooo much

I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
I really hadn't looked in the mirror in a while
Didn't notice that I was an inferior style
Thank you for bringing back the fear
Hadn't been on the depressive tip for the better part of the year
Uncomfortable zone
Your boyfriend wants me to be alone
I'm calling the mystical experiences
Mental and unhealthy psychical appearances
I run a dozen or a thousand yards
I know that it never was in the cards
You can't be a king when you're a two
I can't really sing this in front of you
Because your royal flush

I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
I didn't mean to touch your hand
I didn't realize that I was so grotesque
