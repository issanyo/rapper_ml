[Skit: Anderson .Paak]
(Do you have girlfriends?)
You pickin' on me?
(No, why are you saying that?)
Why are you picking on me?
(Why would I do that? Now let me ask you this question)
Why you pickin' on me?
Shut up and sit down! I told you to sit down!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
Don't use it, timing is all we got
Baby girl, your prime is about that long

[Verse: Anderson .Paak]
Oh, hell no
I had to get back for the candy, uh
I flew for an hour then landed, oh
She live on a beautiful campus, oh
She dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes
Know what she want and she know I ain't shit but a savage, ooh
She soaking up game
Her brain is a series of pamphlets, wow
She told me a story as long as her lashes
Oh what a hopeless romantic
Fucking with jokers and addicts
She told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit
I said, 'Baby girl, you ain't even old enough to be jaded'
And wow, she want visual stimulation
Short attention span and little patience
I like Hennessy and record players
Teddy Pendergrass and Sammy Davis
Opposites attract. I swear, we a magnet
Don't be fucking up your scholarship
I can't help you with grants
Word to my father, my word and my balls is 'bout all that I honor
As God is my witness if you don't jump back in this bed

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
(Do what you want, what you want, as long as you jump in the bed)
I only want to do what feels right
I have to be gone before the midterms
You making up your mind, you're out of songs aren't you?
I wanted an encore, more tunes

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, come back to bed
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
Timing is all we got
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
