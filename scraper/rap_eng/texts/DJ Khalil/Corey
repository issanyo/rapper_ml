[Intro]
How could you hate the only brother that you never had?
I don't take it personal, I promise I ain't never mad
I could love you from a distance, I ain't gotta see you
It might not be me but somebody need you
Love don't disguise the evil

[Verse]
The summer coming, that mean bodies coming
Youngins 'round here don't respect you if you ain't body nothin'
I talked to Corey 'bout politics, know he probably frontin'
Even though he labelled minority, know somebody huntin'
Tryna avoid all the politics, Corey hated rumblin'
Temptations callin' your name will turn you to David Ruffin
June 23rd homie got cold, they killed his favorite cousin
Lawyer tried to give him options, he could not relate to nothin'
Corey had a homie that rapped, he told him come play him somethin'
Said he liked his music, it's different, he really sayin' something
Corey had a job but his homie was broke tryna rap
His homie lived with his cousin, his homies bagged all kind of crack
Corey went home to his family on the daily
His homies had other niggas around, he knew 'em barely
Corey naturally scary, so any issue he callin' his homie
His homie trapping for studio time, he walkin' only
Sometimes he catch the train, every now and then he'd get a cab
He got a gift, hundreds of thousands, it's written in his path
Corey too stuck in his ways to chase a dream
He'd much rather be content with his nine-to-five and it seems
His homie is gettin' distant on him
The music got him away from the routine so Corey said he got different on him
He heard his homie got signed by a legend
This the same nigga he could call, leave his mama the message
That's the same homie you got jumped, told you ride with a weapon
Same homie that seen them niggas and told you don't care if I get arrested
Somehow y'all lost touch, Corey constantly blame his homie
His homie tried to reach out but Corey was actin' phony
Actin' fake busy, guess he felt that would balance out
His homie workin' on his album, got no time to chat it out
He offered Corey a flight, said he could land by tonight
Corey replied shit like maybe I might
Corey pride took over, I ain't lettin' this nigga fly me out
I'd rather play the hood anyway, it's nothing to lie about
He ain't tell his homie that, told his homie he'd call him back
A week passed, his homie recordin', he still ain't call him back
His homie ain't even feel no type of way about it
They both from the bottom, his homie found a way up out it
Now the only way he see him is on Instagram
He don't like his pictures, his homie stay in a different land
People in Africa love him, homie got different fans
Who would've thought y'all have different plans from gettin' ran
Out the building when the police would come
Y'all was robbing the pizza man before the pizza was done
Corey homie had had a daughter, I think it start with a K
Corey ain't bought a gift for baby girl until this day
His homie on TV now, and Corey can see the crowds
His fans know every word, plus they repeatin' it loud
Homie nice with the fashion, he see him kill 'em with style
Corey startin' to feel it 'cause they ain't chilled in a while
Homie kept it in motion, ain't seen Corey in a minute
Homie got a hundred homies that's genuine, come with business
Homie always fuck with Corey but music is what he wanted to do
Now when he be comin' through he heard Corey be mumblin' too
Talkin' how the homie left, forgot about the family
And all he had to offer me was a flight to Miami
Corey strugglin' but meanwhile the homie paid
Homie got a crib, if it get dirty, homie get a maid
Corey envious, homie thinkin' if I was only paid
Every time they say his name, Corey say that's my homie Dave

[Chorus]
How could you hate the only brother that you never had?
I don't take it personal, I promise I ain't never mad
I could love you from a distance, I ain't gotta see you
It might not be me but somebody need you
(Love don't disguise the evil)
How could you hate the only brother that you never had? (how could you hate?)
I don't take it personal, I promise I ain't never mad (I promise)
I could love you from a distance, I ain't gotta see you (I ain't gotta see you)
It might not be me but somebody need you
(Love don't disguise the evil)
