[Chorus]
All that money and you still broke
Being rich don't make you rich
What's a silver spoon to a black pitchfork?
Being rich don't make you rich, get your head right

[Verse 1]
To get to heaven, you gotta raise a bit of hell
Raise the bar, get my brothers outta jail
Raise the minimum wage and let my sisters live well
Being rich don't make you rich, get your head right

[Verse 2]
So many cooks in the kitchen
But the main ingredient is still missing
So if you're really hoping and wishing
Get off your knees and get on the mission, get your head right
Being rich don't make you rich
You son of a *bitch*

[Chorus]
All that money and you still broke
Being rich don't make you rich
All that money and you still broke
Being rich don't make you rich
All that money and you still broke
Being rich don't make you rich
All that money and you still broke
Being rich don't make you shit
