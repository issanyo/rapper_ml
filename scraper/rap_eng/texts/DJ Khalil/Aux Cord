[Intro]
Yeah, just pass the aux cord man
Yeah, just pass the aux cord
Heh, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm just tryna play that fly shit, Sly Family Stone ride shit
Even if you don't smoke, get high shit
Laid back like this that, this that, this that vibe
Finally got off work like this that, this that ride
To vacation, across 110th Street was blazing
For the motherless children that related to Mahalia
I know, you tired of that you can't feel it in your heart
Let the music be your secret lover like Atlantic Starr
New Birth, Wildflower was that jamming shit by far
And Eddie Kendricks' voice will have you singing in your car
I know, I know, I know Marvin played at your home
But that's the reason why your parents had to get it on
That's the reason why you're probably here anyway
Don't fret, you can play that bullshit any day
But, I'm just saying it's a whole catalog
Of analog, the warmer sounds you've ever saw
Pass the aux cord

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Instant Vintage, might as well, that Raphael Saadiq, yeah
Voodoo moved your soul, Cruisin' was made for L-U-V-ing
Badu food for thought, eat out her Appletree and
Jill Scott forever golden, R.I.P. B.B. King
Prince and MJ that we played, barbecue to death
Summer shine, summertime, Will Smith and Jazzy Jeff
Willie Hutch scored the mack while Foxy Brown was slept
Billy Paul, Me and Ms. Jones, I always knew she crept
Barry White, Love Unlimited for the Soul Brothers
Ohio players and heat wave for the Cole Brothers
Funkadelic, Minnie Riper through the speakers
Bill Withers, Johnnie Taylor, cheaper just to keep her
David Ruffin and The Temptations
Christmas time, Silent Night, Gladys Midnight Train kept the Pips waitin'
I'm saying, we can go and chill on that other shit
And join the Parliament, mothership
With this aux chord

[Outro: Nikki Greer]
Music on another level
Let this eargasm take you to Heaven
And get you high
Waking me up
You're taking me higher, ohh
You're waking me up
You're taking me higher, ohh
Keep waking me up
