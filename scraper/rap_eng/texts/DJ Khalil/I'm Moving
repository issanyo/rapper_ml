[Hook]
I'm moving all my work today
I got a brand new K and a Cornern is open
I'm going on my way to the hussle house
To get a big Ol ounce of powder
I'm moving

[Verse 1]
Crack don't fail me now
You got a hold on top throw you out
Turn into a bomb 64
You gotta the police on your I know hide yo
When you're starving and your supply low
And wind up to street ain't selling you fatigue
To see the only one with heat
You watch the fiend walk in their sleep
And you tryin' to get anything you can
‘Cause you're daughter need to eat
Then charlie need paint and feed and beat
And your phone blowing up cause your price can't be beat
Born in the crack house, raised right in front
Make you sell just to get the new adidas with the shells
With a dream , a triple bean here never fail
And you taking his grandmother's else
Diamonds are forever and this rhyme is kinda clever
Watch you turn crack rock into cheddar

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fiends wanna take me out to buy God's grace side
Make it out the ghetto, ain't a place to grow old
The sun might shine but the water's so cold
You could see the pain and my face grow
I used to have a inner sing glow
Now I'm diligent deliberant dough
Many which me would go raw see
Please be ready when the big bear scared of the slops
Of snow, niggas don't tell ‘em don't show for the fear of the poor and the slow
But neighborhood lost our hope
You can ball till your wheels fall off
But you couldn't come close
Enough, you're selling this millionaire stuff
Unless you woke up early as us
Never say never, if I could I would do better
So I turn crack rock into cheddar

[Hook]
