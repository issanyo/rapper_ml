[Hook]
Got my guns and magazines
Ending up in front of me
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

[Bridge]
Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
I go to war to my heart stop, niggas ain't listening
Get the thumping and the dumping at your newborn's christening
Tell your homie, tell his homies, he 'gon need more homies
Ain't this a bitch I got the extended clip right on me
And my diamonds on my neck, I dare a nigga to scheme on it
The ruger on deck, it's hard to miss with the beam on it
I'll give your ass a permanent nap-- sing you a lullabye
I got money to run, so fuck an alibi

[Bridge]
Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Yeah, I believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop I'm on it
Morning or the night, I spot-cha I gotcha
Wake up cuffed to your bed, cops asking 'who shot-cha'
As the world turns, (?) will be learned
The hollow tips burnin and I ain't concerned if I ain't hit
Than I ain't hit, so a nigga don't really give a shit
You know who you fucking with
Come through dump more than a clip
Niggas be on some stupid shit
Till they get hit, ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 3 - Kidd Kidd]
K-I double, shot gun barrel double
I always run a couple and I move 'em on a double
Racks in the duffel, Mac with the muzzle
Makin' circles in you, all black like a tunnel
I only know how to hustle, can't stay outta trouble
I got a big gun, mutha-fuckers scuffle
Kidd Kidd, will you ever change?
FUCK NO! Pimp zone, Rida gang, you already fuckin' know

[Hook]
Got my guns and magazines
Ending up in front of me
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

[Bridge]
Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

[Verse 4 - Kidd Kidd]
Man these niggas so fake, I call 'em knock off
Light pringles high pop the top off
You ain't hot dog, you the fucking Micky Mouse (aw)
I'm on fire like Louisiana hot sauce
Brand new J's cost a buck fifty niggu
You scuff these Iâ€™ll scar your face, buck fifty, nigga
Been fucking with them pigs, you a guinea niggu
And you always begging, you's a ''give me'' nigga
I wear my gun like its trendy niggu
You pussies ain't shit, kitty litter
Uh, see where all that bitching getcha
Right in front of this pistol

[Hook]
Got my guns and magazines
Ending up in front of me
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see
