[Verse 1]
Heard you own a new car and a big home (big home)
Owning everything but your mistakes
For what, for what, for what?
Showing off your art and all your new gold (new gold)
Acting like Usain Bolt
So what, so what, so what?

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, tell me where your friends now?
Baby, that's you on the way down
You know I be there to catch ya
'Cause I'm faded with my arms out
But you won't remember when I call on you when I break

[Chorus]
How can you love me? How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me? How can you love me?
How can you love me when you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart, when you don't have a heart
When you don't have a heart, when you don't have a heart

[Verse 2]
Standing in the foyer in the silence (silence)
Penthouse feel like an asylum
Alone, alone, alone
Riding off of love without a license (license)
That ain't Fiji falling from your iris
As you watch me go, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, tell me where your friends now?
Baby, that's you on the way down
You know I be there to catch ya
'Cause I'm faded with my arms out
But you won't remember when I
Call on you when I break

[Chorus]
How can you love me? How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me? How can you love me?
How can you love me when you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart, when you don't have a heart
When you don't have a heart, when you don't have a heart

[Bridge]
Heart out of reflections
Your fake friends, they all come and go, come and go
[?] stay-at-homes may crumble
But my love will grow, my love will grow

[Chorus]
When you don't have a heart
When you don't have a heart
When you don't have a heart
When you don't have a heart

[Outro]
When you don't... a heart
When you don't... a heart
When you don't... a heart
