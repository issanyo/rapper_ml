[Hook]
Come on lift your spirit
And toast a cheer
To all the good times
Throughout the years
And just remember
It ain't where you're from
It's where you're at
It ain't who you know
It's who's got your back
Who's got your back

[Verse 1]
Times have changed
Everything's strange nothing's what it seems
Here's a friend someone who drops in
Or a face on a telephone screen
When my chips are down and I'm feeling low
Who I'm 'pose to call?
Who's gonna help me stand on my feet after I fall

[Bridge]
So ladies and gentleman and boys and girls
This one goes out to the people who helped me most in the world

[Hook 2]
So lift your spirit
And toast a cheer
To all the good times
Throughout the years
And just remember
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
It ain't who you know it's whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
And whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
It ain't who you know but who knows you
And whose got your back

I told my secret to a friend I thought I could trust
He swore he'll keep it on his momma and the Lord above
All the time I've come to find my business all in the street
I still try to forgive that low-down, double-crossin' dirty cheat

[Bridge 2]
So ladies and gentleman and boys and girls
This one goes out to the people
Who helped me most in the world
Hey brothers and sisters
Hey women and men
I dedicate this to the people whose down since way back when

[Hook 3]
So lift your spirit
And toast a cheer
To all the good times
Throughout the years
And just remember it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
It ain't who you know but whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
And whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
It ain't who you know but who knows you and whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
And whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
It ain't who you know but who knows you and whose got your back
