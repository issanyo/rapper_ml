(Cardo Got Wings)
(4-1)

[Verse 1]
We a secret society
With work in variety
In the bar sippin' champagne
Killas on the side of me
Flyest shit up in the sto'
It's Payroll's clothes
I use to get them sandwich bags
And move mayo O's
Yo new watch
Man that thang so old
I been had it
I'm in Gucci droppin' thick ass stacks
On thin ass jackets
I'm in the Benz stackin'
That's Benjamins dummy
Coughin' out stacks
Like a nigga sick of this money
Whole click doing lovely
Yeah errbody prosper
Welcome to the life of a mobster
Cameras around the crib, a couple choppas
I got a couple jockas
Bitin' my style
But they go need a couple sponsors
Laughing at [?] with my Cali partners
Icy watches blindin' the waiter
We keep our eye on that paper
Might just fly out to Vegas
Sippin' Margaritas
Wearing Y-3 Adidas
My life a movie but they just see the teaser

[Chorus]
In my lifetime, Ima do big thangs
Rock big watches and cop big chains
In my lifetime, I want the house on the hill
Even with no deal, still worth a few mill
In my lifetime (yeah)
(in my life lifetime)
In my lifetime (we want it all)
(you know?)

[Verse 2]
Ricardo Tisci Nikes on
Walk in the club
With some' icy on
I can take a rich nigga Wifey home
I stay with some' pricy on
But I humble
I remember vividly when I struggled
Watchin' Range Rovers past
While I'm on the ave
Moving nickel bags
Tryna flip em quick and fast
I just want a bigger stash and a bigger bag
But I gotta grind
I was chasin' dollar signs
You was on the sideline
That's why I laugh at these rap niggas
Talkin' like they big money trap niggas
Like they some ballin' ass stack getters
I see they cheap jewels
Like what is that nigga?
The game been good to me
But I still keep the wolves with me
I get money and stack, It's all basic
I been rockin' presi's since they had small faces

[Chorus]
In my lifetime, Ima do big thangs
Rock big watches and cop big chains
In my lifetime, I want the house on the hill
Even with no deal, still worth a few mill
In my lifetime (yeah)
(in my life lifetime)
In my lifetime (we want it all)
(you know?)
