[Intro]
Soldier in the city, soldier in the city
Soldier in the city, soldier in the city

[Verse 1]
No job to occupy my time
What else you expect me to do except cry?
It ain’t stealin’ if it’s someone else’s find
Refuse to lose with this trouble on my mind
Johnny Law come messin’ down my door
Well the police don’t scare me anymore
I been in that back seat so many times before

[Chorus]
Soldier in the city, I’m a soldier in the city
Soldier in the city, I’m a soldier in the city

[Verse 2]
Tryna make some cheese outta all of these things
Wanna find a queen but all I’m seein’ is tramps
Every day feels like I’m away at boot camp
Tight ass little kids bustin’ out the street lamp
Neighbourhood hustler come knockin’ at my door
Gotta pay my debts, need to settle the score
Cause I don’t want no more trouble from these fellas no more

[Chorus] x2

[Bridge]
Can ya hear me marchin’?
Left, left, left, right, left
Fight to survive, try to stay alive
You can hear me marchin’
Left, left, left, right, left
Fight to survive, try to stay alive
Can ya hear me marchin’?
Left right left
Don’t ya know

[Chorus] (Left, left, left, right, left)
