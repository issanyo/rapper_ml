Verse 1:

If I do, then I get back up
Yo, they caught me on the reup
They heard I had the trees up
Private building sessions
How the fuck the boydem preed us
I had a bad weekend
Car got towed up to the east end
I got back up, like when you save the same picture
I got the Juice now, yo these lames is just Bishop
They hating on the low
Me I'm steady on the go
Tryna' make it happen
Ayo, I'm tired of always rapping
About the struggle
But yo thats really all my heart knows
I park low, spark dro
Thinking how to get mine
I'm blazing at a car show
Amazing what it cost...
It's nothing to a boss
I'm thinking how to get 5
Series in the bm
I used to push a 3
Now I'm really grinding, ayo that's word to Pusha T
Nix! uh

Hook:

Never fallin' down, down, down

Verse 2:

Out the gutter, uh yo...

Ok, I know a couple friends
That's been out here flippin' hands
Way before they sipped on Hen
They can't afford to slip so, when that nigga's feeling brave
Guess he wants to dig his grave
Make him meet his dead relatives, presidents and ministers
The one they say they killin' for
Tell me what you in it for
Stickin' up convenience stores
Walk it just to cock it, stuff your pockets til your dinner full
Hunger got you bugging so you're gunning til your belly's full
You see that's what the struggle do
So I probably hustled you
Then I tried to muffle you
You see it's nothing personal
Cause first of all my pockets starving
I did what I had to, man I learned that shit the hard way
It's all about survival
Ain't nothing safe without faith from a rifle
Quran or the Bible cause you need something to guide you
Boy, your brother might knife you
Family might line you
Streets sub-zero in the season, the heat waves
Hearing brothers die, mothers crying that's each day
Heros don't exist but you could see what the streets made
Shit, you could see what the streets made
Heros don't exist but you could see what the streets made
Uh, Kwame gang!
