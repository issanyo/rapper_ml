[Verse 1: Chace Infinite]
Trials of the black hearted, in the land where
Just because of your skin crooked cops make niggas targets
My upbringing was solid, but shit I got involved with
Could have had me stretched out, or somebody caught me
Cold streets grown, (a land)? it's awkward
Can't even understand the language that they write the laws in
We've been struggling for centuries and bet it
Kinda odd how we made a industry out of lettuce
The book says only the word was in the beginning;
I get the feeling only words will be here in the ending, so
I lie with divine energy every time
Harness the power of words written in rhyme
Simple as pluckin’ grapes from the vine, I produce fruit
Foolish and form deep in my mind, a couple a screws loose
Crazy as Howard Hughes laying tools on ....(?)
Focus on my own vision, niggas who screwed you
I form thoughts on left sides of the brain
I express it in the flesh, it may come out as insane
I'm loyal like a nigga that grew up in a gang
Plus I resurrect the dead and bring them devils to flames

[Hook: Krondon]
It's hard to raise children, no lights in the building
And half the neighborhood won't survive in this system
The coroner is overworked, cops killing every
Innocent nigga just trying to make a living

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
The effects of a drugged out city
Kept it thugging all my niggas was thugged out with me
First born grandson of a killer from Mississippi
Hit the pavement in the teens like he hit the G in the 60's
On a mission, they pushing that product purp, keep me paranoid
Already sold the city and carried it up like the Jeffries Boys
The 26's keep plenty bitches up in the ride
Way too busy counting that cake to think about genocide
Pocket full of stones, but I'm killing my own
Matter of fact, I finished a pack before I finished this song
I wanna just rap collect my stash go rock some shows and get blown
Don't give no fuck I step on no toes a nigga just trying to get on
Get on some cheese, get on some green, get on some ho’s, get off my back
It ain't no justice for these people for what they did to Oscar Grant
Bust them back, take their life before they take it from us
They're just gonna kill us in our sleep if we don't wake the fuck up, fuck up

[Hook 2: Krondon]
It's hard to raise children, no lights in the building
And half the neighborhood won't survive in this system
Like it ain't a given we get up God willing if we're
Innocent nigga just trying to make a living
The coroner is overworked, cops killing
Hands up to the ceiling if you feel like
"fuck the lieutenant" and everybody be killed with them
For the people they won't let live peaceful

[Verse 3: Chace Infinite]
The effect of a war torn city, spreads like
A cancer to the populace that shows no pity
Gotta get the people off the government titty
Citizens is so sick clearly, holler if you hear me
On my Pac shit until the pigs kill me
Cold slugs killing all my brothers in the city
You "confused a pistol with a taser gun", really? Shit...
Another notch for the devils that support this
How long can we afford to go through such tortures?
Young lives framed in a painful portrait
Blood stained porous, concrete is morbid
Innocent men slain inside a wood coffin
They contradict the laws far too often
Proof that these people are devils and just thoughtless
Praying for peace now but want justice for Oscar
Calling on angels of vengeance, to the government
We trying to case and get that crooked cop a stiffer sentence
This ain't the place where hate was invented
But I'll be damned if this states ain't the best that did it
Fooling the world into thinking that it's peaceful interest

[Hook 2]
