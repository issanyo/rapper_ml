[Verse 1]
I ain't worried 'bout you niggas, I'm in my own lane
I'm just gettin it in while I'm stayin' out the way
Lounging in plush cribs on the phone talkin biz
Only legit convos of course I ain't a kid
I ain't new to this, been on the grind since a kid
Boy I'm use to this, no where to go head to toe in exclusive shit
Over priced jeans, granny say it's foolishness (come on granny these balmains)
New Benz S-Class, leather with the wood dash, tinted glass
I honk when I ride pass scoopin' cash
I only use premium when I get gas
Jump in a 6 with a different color wrist
Today is rose gold with a rose gold kit
You ain't in the mix, you ain't never seen paper
Nigga we was gettin' truckloads as a teenager

[Chorus]
I be ridin' up the 5 in a 5
I be ridin' through the 6 in a 6
I be crusin' down the 7 in a 7
Lookin' at the world behind tint
We got no time for niggas
We got no time for bitches
We ridin' around in 5's in 6's
We got no time niggas
We got no time for bitches
We ridin' around in 5's and 6's

[Verse 2]
We look like money but we got way mo'
Iced up look at what the yay paid fo'
Beamer 2 door
Benz got 2 mo'
Valeted out front I'm at the bar gettin' blowed
Sippin' on Patron with this bad bitch
Laughin' while the Rolex dancin'
Ridin' through the woods like I'm campin'
But I'm just tryna make my way to my palace
This the same way my idols put it down
D niggas ride foreign off of kilos and pounds
Heroin and pills I done been there forreal
Then my name got hot I had to switch lanes and chill
Like the diamond link I'm rocking
In the foreign reminiscing about my days of rock swappin'

[Ab-Lib]
If a fiend ain't have 10 dollars they was complainin' bout the size of the rock, a nigga came a long way

[Chorus]
I be ridin' up the 5 in a 5
I be ridin' through the 6 in a 6
I be crusin' down the 7 in a 7
Lookin' at the world behind tint
We got no time for niggas
We got no time for bitches
We ridin' around in 5's in 6's
We got no time niggas
We got no time for bitches
We ridin' around in 5's and 6's
