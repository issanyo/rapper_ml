[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I’m in this mothafucker doing what I wanna
10 bottles, 10 bitches go with my persona
Pull up in that Enzo then I do donuts
I’m that cool, cashews, make 'em all go nuts
(Baby got ass, I need me a shot of that
Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag)
That's right, she's got something that I wanna see
That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something
She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something
Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something
Club filled with dead bodies
If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry
You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted
Do what you wanna do, drug test on you

[Game]
Lotta money when I talk
Big mills, big deals ‘bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bassline
She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time

[Dr. Dre]
Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It’s forty days, forty nights if I’m making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed then we good

[Hook: Sly]
If you got drugs in this motherfucker
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something
High off something, high off something
'til your mothafucking brain don’t function
High off something, high off something
What I supply taking you high?

[Verse 2: Game]
Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape
Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin’ off big spendin’, letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded
X-rated that's what I like glad that you made
To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and

[Snoop Dogg]
May I, kick a little something for the G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

[Hook]
