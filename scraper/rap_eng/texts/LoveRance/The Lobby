[Intro:]

Do I got 2?
Or is it 3?
Might've been 2
Yep

[Hook:]
Man I'm finna meet 3 girls in the lobby
Baby start seein but she stay in the pilates
When I go to sleep I'm a dream of your body, your body...
Cause girl nobody fuckin with you...
Cause girl nobody fuckin with you...
But tonight, girl I'm fuckin on you

[Verse 1:]
Baby, What's yo name?
I see you got the potential (got it)
I see you wanna lounge around live niggas but you ain't got the credentials
See that could be a problem
But that ain't even the issue (no no no...)
Don't trip boo, I'mma introduce you to what you never been used to
I like when you doing yo hair
Up in the mirror
Put them hands up (put em up, put em up)
And the shirt off (take it off, take it off)
See you been hittin that gym and been getting it in
I see the results
All of that
Runnin then you stretchin it
The best you get for any amount of money that you got mane

[Hook:]
Man I'm fiendin with 3 girls in the lobby
Baby start seein but she stay in the pilates
When I go to sleep I'm a dream of your body, your body...
Cause girl nobody fuckin with you...
Cause girl nobody fuckin with you...
But tonight, girl I'm fuckin on you

[Verse 2:]
Feelin gets, make her mind and her body melt
Make her wet, swim in her like Michael Phelps
No games, play the cards that I was dealt
Fuck her good, eat her good, till there's nothing left
Wake up in the morning... repeat it
If you don't look like last night... number deleted
Undefeated, a king, that's how I'm treated
Black & Gold pieces, had to Drew Breeze it
Then you pull up in the CL
Pink car, white interior, seashell
As the night feel
Sudden feelin like Loverance tape on the April, well
Uh, lovin yo body, realest silhouette
I ain't thinkin ask me shorty, girl I'm feelin text
You thinkin now, I'm thinkin next
You thinkin time, here's a rolex

[Hook:]
Man I'm finna meet 3 girls in the lobby
Baby start seein but she stay in the pilates
When I go to sleep I'm a dream of your body, your body...
Cause girl nobody fuckin with you...
Cause girl nobody fuckin with you...
But tonight, girl I'm fuckin on you
