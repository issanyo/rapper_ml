[Iamsu!]
I'm a rich city nigga, got hoes on my dick
Know niggas that will kill, niggas that'll hit a lick
They call me suzy, suzy
G-shock on my wrist
And I never wanna see some Reeboks on a bitch

[LoveRance]
I'm a San Francisco nigga, I just thought you should know
But I live in the rich, got a girl in the O
Hit my boy Jay Rock when I slap in the mo
He got a bad ass bitch, so I brought 2 more

[Iamsu!]
She don't like HBK then she must be gay
Wild young nigga I'm a say it all day
Back in school I was in the fucking hall ways
Now I hit the fucking club and I just parlay

[LoveRance]
LoveRance tell me where the skunk's at
Naw nigga I can't give out that
Information 'cuz if you start hating
My goons will send you to a private location

[Skipper]
They call me Skipper, Skipper, Skipper, Skipper
And I be swaggin' all day[x2]
They call me Skipper, Skipper, Skipper, Skipper
And I be swaggin' all day[x2]
[Kool John]
They call me Kool John, Kool John, Kool John
And I be swaggin' all day[x2]
They call me Kool John, Kool John, Kool John
And I be swaggin' all day[x2]

[Skipper]
Uh, What you know about me
Pull up to the club bout 4-5 deep
Fresh pair of SB's all on my feet
And I like big butts on all my freaks

[Kool John]
Beep, Beep
Who got the keys to the bimmer
Purple weed steamer
Bad bitch Selina
Dumped her
Tell me have you seen her?
Notice how I play, I don't go that way

[Skipper]
Down with the cause, so it's down with the drawers
Hotter than the summertime, cooler than the fall
When the gang is in the building everyone know we ball
Got them yelling gang shit from the windows to the wall

[Kool John]
And everybody gon' know my name
See my gold chain, and my polo frames
OG in the game, you see my gray hair mane?
And I don't stick the pink if it stinks
Pbbt Bitchâ€¦
