Bend it over, bust it open, bend it over, bust it open
Bend it over, bust it open, bend it over, bust it open
Bend it over, bust it open, bend it over, bust it open
Bend it over, bust it open, bend it over, bust it open
I can’t be in your presence, so baby send that picture

[Verse 1: Loverance:]
Or baby we can just skype, we can chill and talk all night
I heard you got that stripper pole, you gone show me that thang tonight?
Just jump on it then climb up, slow it down then wind up
On iChat, on my iMac, that’s where you can have that
Have internet access, baby you the best dress
When you underss my lips say yes
Kissin your flesh I wish I can
Be that hand that covers your chest
But I can’t tonight, so I fantasize
You and me tonight, my tongue in between your thighs

[Hook:]
Baby I wanna see you so baby take that picture
Baby I wanna see you so baby take that picture
Baby I wanna see you so baby take that picture
Baby I wanna see you so baby take that picture

Take off your pants, take off your top
Take down your panties, pop off that bra
Take off your pants, take off your top
Take down your panties, pop off that bra

[Hook:]
Bend it over, bust it open, bend it over, bust it open
Bend it over, bust it open, bend it over, bust it open
Bend it over, bust it open, bend it over, bust it open
Bend it over, bust it open, bend it over, bust it open
I can’t be in your presence, so baby send that picture
I can’t be in your presence, so baby send that picture
I can’t be in your presence, so baby send that picture
I can’t be in your presence, so baby send that picture

[Verse 2: Loverance]
Or maybe you can call me up
There’s no limits or minutes on my cellphone
I asked you what you doin tonight
You say studyin, you stayin home
You got a mid term early in the morn’
Put your fingers to the test, let me hear you moan
Your roomie’s gone, you home alone
Damn I wish would of kept tingle on my phone
Or Oovoo, Ooovoo, yes you
Sound like you need a nigga to come over there and Dress you
Coress you, test you, push to that limit
Photo album full, pictures all up in it
I’ll keep talkin shit till baby you finished
Or my battery just..... (Hello?)

[Hook:]
Baby I wanna see you so baby take that picture

Baby I wanna see you so baby take that picture
Baby I wanna see you so baby take that picture

Take off your pants, take off your top
Take down your panties, pop off that bra
Take off your pants, take off your top
Take down your panties, pop off that bra
