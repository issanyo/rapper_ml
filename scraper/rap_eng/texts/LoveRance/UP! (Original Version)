Pussy on my lips juice box taste good to me
Put it on my tongue, fill me on up
Put it in your gut, tear that pussy up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
She ain't got to tell me she want it

Do crazy things I beat the pussy up

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Skipper]
I'm me, you know I'm a big dog
I dive in head first like a free fall
Big wood, thicker then a tree log
Had her bouncing on my dick like a see saw
Baby I'm raw, like I don't use protection
We can get it right here in the VIP Section
I wanna fuck you right here, like Erk say
Mr Ice with the cream, no dessert please scream my name
Baby I'm Skipper, just one dance shawty reaching for my zipper
And now I'm a dick her
You can pick her up or I'll deliver
Panties in the way, if their new then I'm a rip em
I go hard in the paint, boyfriend muggin all hard cus u came

Got to deposit that dick to call it a sperm bank

[Hook]
