Now twerk it for a real king
I’m the ground king like bombee
Grab her ass, tell her make that shit freeze
Pussy tighter than the eyes on a chinese
If your ass ain’t fucking, get from round me
I need a pussy so wet it might drown me
I’m the pussy king, go head crown me
You found me, standing tall in that thing
Yeah on me
Comin up short, mugsy boats
If your man do you like this, let him go
Let them know that loverance is digging you out
You got realest nigga no doubt
Logo in that’s how, low grabbin her butt
Low smackin her ass, ...now commence to smash
Yeah I’m deep in it
That’s my damn shoes, but it’s alright, cause I brought too

Make that shit clap make my dick bigger
Now twerk it for a real nigga, nigga
Make that shit clap make my dick bigger
Now twerk it for a real nigga, nigga

Niggas on the sideline, they be haters
Hit the stage and fuck it up, call me crater
Yeah your style is cool but I’m past greater
In the club, standing on the couch bitch
Pouring sirock on somebody else’s bitch
Yougn stunna, rob bottles
You can tell she a freak by the way she swallows
Wait, but I like it, I like it
When she on top, I love the way she ride it, ah
Bottom lip, love the way she bite it
Yeah I’m hard as shit, I ain’t gotta lie this
...shit, bring that ass back, make that ass clap
With an arched back, yeah talk shit
But so what, I’m drunk as fuck, back it up
When she smack it up
