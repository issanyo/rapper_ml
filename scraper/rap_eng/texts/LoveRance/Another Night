[Chorus: LoveRance]
Another night, another drink
[?]
It's like I seen you before
But you are too good to be true
Another night
Another drink
Another night

[Verse 1: LoveRance]
Uh, when I get you all alone, girl
Can I take you to my home, girl?
You can bring your homegirl
Shit, we can have a threesome
Any [?] on my [?]
[?] jump off
And land on the liquor
You said you never tried
Nothing nasty with your homegirl
'Cause that your sister
Well, I don't believe that shit
She talking about how she would eat that shit
And that the-, this last drink
I know you [?] club with me

[Chorus: LoveRance]
Another night, another drink
[?]
It's like I seen you before
But you are too good to be true
Another night
Another drink
Another night

[Verse 2: Pretty Boi]
Me and Rance got the club going crazy
Bad chicks in the vip, we wasted
We turnt up and we faded (true)
Real talk on off I'mma make it (high)
Baby, let me know what's the move, yeah
Tryna [?] a tool if it's cool, yeah
Me and you plus a friend at the condo
You say you wanna live once, baby, YOLO
[?] down when I got the magic
Hey, high as fuck like an addict (yeah)
Tryna stretch it up like the last thing (yeah)
You might fuck around and get it while in traffic, hey

[Chorus: LoveRance]
Another night, another drink
[?]
It's like I seen you before
But you are too good to be true
Another night
Another drink
Another night
Another night, another drink
[?]
It's like I seen you before
But you are too good to be true
Another night
Another night (Another drink)
Another night
