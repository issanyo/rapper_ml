[Chorus: Pretty Boy]
I only fucks with a bad bitch
In the club with a bad bitch
Goddamn, let me get it in
I'm fuckin' with her
B-b-b-b-bad bitch
I only fucks with a bad bitch
In the club with a bad bitch
Goddamn, let me get it in
I'm fuckin' with her, her

[Verse 1: Balance]
Shoe game ill, kill bitches with your face
Bad bitch bad, every nigga wanna date
Attitude real, keep a real nigga straight
All I fuck is dimes, bad bitches never hate
If a nigga wild out, tell a nigga skate
Bad bitch contest, come in first place
After work hit the gym, squat both plates
Ass so fat, man, a nigga can't wait
You a bad bitch, never average
All your homegirls be savage
Gucci, Chanel, you have it
Designer fashion, you an addict
Addicted to your ass and the way you twerk
The way you shake cake got me wantin' dessert
A bad bitch bad when you put in work
And that's why I fuck with you

[Chorus: Pretty Boy]
I only fucks with a bad bitch
In the club with a bad bitch
Goddamn, let me get it in
I'm fuckin' with her
B-b-b-b-bad bitch
I only fucks with a bad bitch
In the club with a bad bitch
Goddamn, let me get it in
I'm fuckin' with her, her

[Verse 2: LoveRance]
UH uh
Bad bitch with the Rose in her glass
Long hair, cute face with a southern ass
Love it when she make her hips sway
When she walk past, eye contact
Damn girl, you did that
Keyshia Dior, on your lips
Fendy belt, hug your hips
I'll hold you thoughts, if you let me
Iced out, rink, young Wayne Gretzky
Well, pretty lady, I'll ride for ya, uh
Under pressure, I'll lie for ya
Your man say he love you, will he die for you?
Jodeci in '93, he gon' cry for you
Uh, when I take you from him
Hop in my Benz, bring all your friends
Take a piece of the Earth, put it in wind
Shots of Patron, watch your head spin
Like ooh!

[Chorus: Pretty Boy]
I only fucks with a bad bitch
In the club with a bad bitch
Goddamn, let me get it in
I'm fuckin' with her
B-b-b-b-bad bitch
I only fucks with a bad bitch
In the club with a bad bitch
Goddamn, let me get it in
I'm fuckin' with her, her
