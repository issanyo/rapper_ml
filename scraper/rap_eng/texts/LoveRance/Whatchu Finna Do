[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Whatchu finna do with all that
Whatchu finna do with all that
Whatchu finna do with all that ass
Whatchu finna do with all that, all that
Whatchu finna do with all that ass

[Verse 1: Jonn Hart]
Damn, that move like jelly
Cake straight from the deli
Is it real, girl? Tell me
Can't fit jeans, she can only wear jeggings
She got a badonkie
That big thump thing so clumsy
And I say this humbly
That booty could feed a whole country

[Pre-Hook: Jonn Hart]
Booty booty booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty booty booty, rockin' everywhere
Oh, yeah, rockin' everywhere

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Whatchu finna do with all that
Whatchu finna do with all that
Whatchu finna do with all that ass
Whatchu finna do with all that, all that
Whatchu finna do with all that ass

[Verse 2: LoveRance]
Now shawty got an ass on her
Show couldn't pass on her
When I seen the curves on her, I didn't wanna do anythin' else
Besides swimmin' her, young Michael Phelphs
That ass needs to be spanked by my Fendi belt
Slow kisses, back dimples, watch a 90 mil
That ass, hmm, how you fit it all in there?
Sit the glass right there, baby, you ain't playin' fair

[Pre-Hook: Jonn Hart]
Booty booty booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty booty booty, rockin' everywhere
Oh, yeah, rockin' everywhere

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Whatchu finna do with all that
Whatchu finna do with all that
Whatchu finna do with all that ass
Whatchu finna do with all that, all that
Whatchu finna do with all that ass

[Bridge: Jonn Hart]
It's driving me out of my mind
Every time a nigga see it from behind
Can't get it out of my head
I hate to see you go but I love to watch you leave

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Whatchu finna do with all that
Whatchu finna do with all that
Whatchu finna do with all that ass
Whatchu finna do with all that, all that
Whatchu finna do with all that ass
