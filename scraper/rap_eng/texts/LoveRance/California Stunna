[Verse 1-LoveRance]
Young Stunna nigga, San Francisco native
If you let that nigga fuck yo pussy downgrade it
Niggas gon' hate it, but I keep it real do'
I'm fuckin' this game like Pinky no dildo
These bitches love my style
They really love my swaggy
If I stick it in yo' hoe I bet she call me Daddy
Bet she call me Rancy
Bet she call you Boosie
I take a straight classy bitch
And turn her to a groupie
I take a rich bitch, turn her to my side hoe
Cause my money long like the arms on Rondo
Four door Honda, feelin' like a Lambo
Doin' donuts with my eyes closed
With my top dropped down, middle fingers out
Screamin' out loud, "how you like me now?!"
I'm a gangsta that's straight from Californ-I-A
Tell ya girlfriend juicebox, catch a fade

[Hook-LoveRance]
Thought I told ya
I'm a California Stunner
You can keep that hoe cause I don't really want her
Thought I told ya
I'm a California Stunner
You can keep that hoe cause I don't really want her
Thought I told ya
I'm a California Stunner
You can keep that hoe cause I don't really want her
Thought I told ya
I'm a California Stunner
I'm a dick ya bitch down and take everything from her ha

[Verse 2-LoveRance]
I'm a stunner baby, and I'm cold as hell
And my stack, is thicker than a Southern Belle
Got my car dipped in orange, Kenan Kel
Tell that bitch I'm a Boss like Meek Millz
High prices hoes, I give em cheap thrills
Told that bitch roll up she started crushin' pills
Now I'm higher than my phone pilot Galaxies
Now she mad at me, her pussy was a casualty
In it for the scene (?) no witnesses
And my egos on Precious, that's how big it is
Bitch I ball, bitch I ball, Jason Kidd
Cancel that bitch, Game Over Lil' Flip
And I'm rollin' down the street bro
I'm about it and I'm lookin' for a freak hoe
I'm a stunna, I'm a stunna call me Stone Cold
Big bank take little bank and leave y'all broke

[Hook-LoveRance]
Thought I told ya
I'm a California Stunner
You can keep that hoe cause I don't really want her
Thought I told ya
I'm a California Stunner
You can keep that hoe cause I don't really want her
Thought I told ya
I'm a California Stunner
You can keep that hoe cause I don't really want her
Thought I told ya
I'm a California Stunner
I'm a dick ya bitch down and take everything from her ha

[Outro-LoveRance]

Big dicks we slang
Freak bitches do ya thang, do ya
