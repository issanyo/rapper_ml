[Hook: LoveRance]
Shawty this your anthem, yeah
Shawty this your anthem, yeah
Shawty this your anthem, hey
And let me see you twerk, twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
Shawty this your anthem, yeah
Shawty this your anthem, yeah

[Verse 1: LoveRance]
Shawty this your anthem let me see you bounce
Swaggin in the vips
Smellin' like an ounce
Standing on the couch, wobble that ass
Get this large amount
You can't even doubt, count
Make you smile, then we're leaving out
Take you to the mall
That's a date, that's a shopping spree
Poppin' rubber bands stunt in front your friends
They joking me, Louie V
Cover my eyes while they watching me
Turn around and dip it to the ground
Make it clap for me
Need a standing ovation, when I'm throwin currency
High right now, eyes burgundy
And your curvery is absurd to me
I got a touch and I got a feel
I gotta see that ass real
Cause if it is I'll take you home
Beat it up and I'll make you moan
DJ this her favourite song
This style she's been waiting on
She heard it when she was at work
Now it's time for that ass twerk
I love her when she take it low
Sweat the flow, slow it down
Speed it up, if you sing for the night ladies let me know what's up

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: LoveRance]
Shawty this your anthem
Let me see you drop it low
My Twitter certified
But you a certified pro
If you bounce it for me baby I'mma make it rain
Tap your girlfriend, tell her do the same
Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble for me
Uh, take a shot, lock and load, I love what I see
And if you lovin' what you feel,let me know that it's real
You keep bouncing on my dick, but you can bounce on my grill
Whatever you like I bite, you bouncing that ass jus' right
I might, just might, take your ass down tonight
The way you wobble baby, makes me wanna' feel it
The way you keep talking that shit, makes me wanna' kill it
Uh, grind
Let me take my time
Let me see you bring it back, make that ass recline
It gets me every time, but I'mma blow your mind
I'mma kiss you where the sun don't shine, lick you..
