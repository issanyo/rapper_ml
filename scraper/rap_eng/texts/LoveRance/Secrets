[Hook-LoveRance]
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby, baby
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby
And I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby, baby
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret
Tired of bein' yo secret
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby, baby
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby
And I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby, baby
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret
Tired of bein' yo secret

[Verse 1-LoveRance]
Now tell me do you want me like I want you?
I need you baby
Yo' body is calling tell me should I answer it?
If I answer it would you hang up?
Would you hang up?
If I answer it would you hang up?
Would you hang up?
I'm tired, of sittin' around, contemplatin'
Back and forth, my mind is racin'
Cat and mouse, I'm tired of chasin'
Yo' man on the side, I'm tired of waitin'
A friend, but I'd rather be yo' man
You tell me that you're not into that
I pretend to understand but damn
(What is it now Rance?)
Can I get a moment of yo' time?
Of yo' time?
Can I get a moment of yo' time?
Of yo' time?
Can you be mine?
Not for a night maybe a day
We'll get away in my arms ya lay
He'll call ya phone but I'll tell ya say
You put it down you begin to say

[Bridge-LoveRance]
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
You should never it go
Never let it show
Cause you know like I know
We should never let it go

[Hook-LoveRance]
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby, baby
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby
And I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby, baby
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret
Tired of bein' yo secret
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby, baby
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby
And I'm just tired of bein' yo secret baby, baby
I'm just tired of bein' yo secret
Tired of bein' yo secret
