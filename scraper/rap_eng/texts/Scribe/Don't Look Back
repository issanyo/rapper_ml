[Verse 1]
Back when I was 15, the year was 95
I use to dream one day I be the
Best rapper alive, I never went to
School without my walkman by my
Side and my tape-biggy smalls ready to die
I attended lewidhigh that?s where I got into some mischief my dad found out he sent me to Auckland city to
Live with a reverend that was strict and very religious, I tried to resist it but there was nothing I could say
Next thing I knew my
Bags were packed and I was on my
Way begged my mum to stay I
Promised I would behave she told
Me, no you got to go and not be
Afraid she told me I would be ok
And I had to be brave knew my
Life from that moment would never
Be the same, I forced a smile in
Effort to mask up that pain. I said goodbye, took my seat on the back
Of a plane, I shed a tear and swore I wouldn't look back again

[Hook]
I won't look back I keep on and keep
Strong cause yesterday is long
Gone, don't look back there is a
Time keep in mind the human race
Don't get left behind

And don't look back keep on and keep
Strong cause yesterday is now long
Gone, don't look back there is a
Time keep in mind the human race
Don't get left behind

[Verse 2]
Meanwhile in 99 had a pad I'm
Writing rhymes, my girlfriend's
Pregnant she's about to drop at
Any time, I know I?m crazy young 19 with a baby-son on top of that I?m
Trying to contempt with my lady's
Mum, calls me a loser and a good
For nothing lazy bum
She says give up the music, that my day would
Never come, but I can't turn back
Now I got no option to fail cause
Mum and dad just lost a house in mortgage sale
I say a solid prayer and yeah I
Know my god had heard me cause the
Next day P-Money asked if I would
Sign it dirty next thing I know is
That I?m leaving to go record my CD
I tell my son things will be
Different next time you see me
Quickly change his nappy
He looks playful and happy, I got going
Catch my plane after the back of a
Taxi, as I drove away slowly I
Started to cry, because that moment deep inside a part of me died

[Hook]
I won't look back I keep on and keep
Strong cause yesterday is long
Gone, don't look back there is a
Time keep in mind the human race
Don't get left behind

And don't look back keep on and keep
Strong cause yesterday is now long
Gone, don't look back there is a
Time keep in mind the human race
Don't get left behind

[Verse 3]
Now it's been four years since
Crusader made its way to the top
Went around the world represent NZ
For hip-hop now I'm touring
Nominations in the M2 seven home a
Five time platinum plaque with
Silver scroll, Australia went gold
That's 35,000 sold at 25 years old
I just exceeded my goal, tell me
Where to from here tell me where
Else can I go, what can I possibly
Do, what don't I already know
Got everything I need but still I
Feel something lacking in my heart
Don?t feel content I can't get no
Satisfaction, my heart is full of
Love, hate, pain and frustrations I
Know my fans they got a lot of
Expectations, they think that I can
Make it, they think that I can take it, my true destiny I can not
Escape it but it will all be ok
Cause I wasn't put here to stay
But there?s something things that I know before I go that I got to say
And its

[Hook]
Don't look back I keep on and keep
Strong cause yesterday is long
Gone, don't look back there is a
Time keep in mind the human race
Don't get left behind

And don't look back keep on and keep
Strong cause yesterday is long
Gone, don't look back there is a
Time keep in mind the human race
Don't get left behind
