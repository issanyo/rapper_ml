Still here, stronger, no doubt man we're stronger


[Verse 1: Scribe]
And I made it through, and I made it through the
Oh, and I made it through the rain and the cold through the dark all alone
My life hit rock bottom I had no where to go
And if I could turn back time and change the road that I chose
All the mistakes that I made, it burns a hole in my soul
And it took all that I had to get out of that hole
It took the birth of my sons to get back my control
So man I just went number one, ain't going back to the dole
I'm stronger than ever, my enemies they thought I would fold, and yo

[Chorus: Scribe]
That's why I'm standing up
I'm holding on to my life yo, I gotta be strong
Now watch me rise you won't see me fall
I'm stronger now, we could take them all

[Verse 2: Tyna]
So alone and confused and my soul was abused
And a hand came off the hangman to throw me the noose
It took the love of my family and my friends to show me the truth
I lived a lifetime of pain and I was only a youth
And its hard tryin' to swim in an ocean of fools
And I thought I'd catch a break, but I'd broken the rules
And my Aunt always told me take care of yourself
Lest the devil put a fork in the road that you choose
And even the strongest trees must grow from the roots
See a house without love ain't no home it's a roof
It's shelter without warmth, man you know its the truth
And I feel most at home when I'm alone in the booth
And my flow is unstoppable this poem's the proof
It's poetry pen and paper my label is showing the fruits, right?
While I grow and improve and their all slow and observant
Exactly what you've learnt and your old and thrown at the curve
And if they're showing concern, it's not cause they care
It's just cause they know what they owe in return
Time just feels like it's taking me too long
Trials and tribulations are why I grew strong

[Chorus: Scribe]
That's why I'm standing up
I'm holding on to my life yo, I gotta be strong
Now watch me rise you won't see me fall
I'm stronger now, we could take them all

[Verse 3: Scribe]
Oh, tell my mother that I love her like no other
I'm holding off in above we made it out of the gutter
Did I stutter?, I came with the good for my fam'
I came from the hood you got no choice but to plan
A way to make it out, somehow we'll break away
From these chains like Che Fu we'll never "Fade Away"
I came to stay made it through the rainy days
Never will I go astray came to take the pain away
That's why I'm standing up, I'm holding on
I just made it through the storm, by all rights I should be gone
They said I'd never make it, I'll prove them all wrong
I took the pain now for so long
And I'm still here and its my life and I'm not scared against
All odds I got here give me your best shot, yeah
'Cause I can take it I was destined to make it
I was destined to forever burn in a fiery lake

[Chorus: Scribe]
That's why I'm standing up
I'm holding on to my life yo, I gotta be strong
Now watch me rise you won't see me fall
I'm stronger now, we could take them all
