[Chorus]
Try to remember when life was slow
Try to remember when you were young
Try to remember when life was slow
Try to remember when you were young

[Scribe]
You used to be my man, we ran the streets, had a plan to make two-fifty grand
Start a rap band, rock the land from here to Japan
I used my knowledge to expand my thoughts
Caught you trying to sabotage
Betrayed me with a kiss, you used to smile as camouflage
We used to spar in your garage when we was little
Now I write riddles and string together rhythm like fiddles
Like skittle sticks, I picked you up, she was thick in the middle
Betrayal ain't new to me
In fact it's the only thing that's true to me
I'm soon to be gone, since I grew to be strong
What you're doing is wrong, and so long as the mic's in my palm
Going out like Genghis Khan in this track
Taking it right back to the essence, count my friends as blessings
It didn't take me long to write this song, I learned a lesson
Dressing mics like a phenomenom, hanging like gardens to a Babylon
But you need the power to keep moving on
I'm-a lift you upon my shoulders, and in the end forgive you

Watch who you trust, 'cos your friends could be your enemies
They just pretend to be to hide their true identity
Life is love, that's the way that it was meant to be
But love is gone, once erased from the memory

[Chorus]

[Scribe]
Yo, yo ... she was like the warmth of the sun
Didn't think it could be done, she led me to believe she was the one
Who'd love me to the end, a friend I could depend on
Life got complicated, I knew it from the start
She'd be the one who broke my heart
My life it fell apart, emptiness took her place
But it was the taste of hate, that made me recognise her face
Love was gone, without a trace of ever being felt
It wasn't love that helped me when I was down and out
I couldn't cope, my only hope was rope around my neck
The only way to escape the things you can't forget
A lesson learned, don't give your love away unearned
'Cos time turns, and hearts burn, can never be returned ..
... to sender, When I think about the bitch I can remember
Times that I reached out for her Summer and December
Defend her and represent her to the end
But had to make a promise to my heart that I could never love again

Watch who you trust, 'cos your friends could be your enemies
They just pretend to be to hide their true identity
Life is love, that's the way that it was meant to be
But love is gone, once erased from the memory

[Chorus]

[Scribe]
I was a kid and I was full of life, I didn't know
Things like hate, didn't even have a chance to grow
My parents didn't know 'cos there's no way that I could tell
Them that their angel secretly lived in a private hell
Yo, I could smell the alcohol upon his rotten breath
I prayed for death as he laid his hands upon my breasts
I cried and screamed and said 'You're not allowed to do these things'
But he was mean, he told me if I told he'd break my spleen
I was a queen but subjected to being disrespected
I was infected with this hate without an antiseptic
And disgusted with this man with whom my Dad had trusted
I tried to fight it, yo but in the end I had to hide it
Deep in my soul, What part of 'no' didn't he understand
'N' or the 'O', or was it simply 'cos he was a man
I could have ran and escaped to a foreign land
But I stayed, and today it makes me who I am

Watch who you trust, 'cos your friends could be your enemies
They just pretend to be to hide their true identity
Life is love, that's the way that it was meant to be
But love is gone, once erased from the memory

[Chorus]
