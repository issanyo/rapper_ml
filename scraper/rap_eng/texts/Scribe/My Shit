[Intro]
It's my shit...
[?]

[Hook] x2
Ain't nobody else in the world that can flow like this
Take some words that I wrote
Put it down in a flow
Make it sound dope like this
It's my shit
That's why it sounds like
Like, like, like this

[Verse 1]
Yo, If you see me up in the club, I be V.I.P
On the low, sipping that X.O.V, S.O.P
Got Ty-Ty & Ladi-6 on the left of me, We
Tear the floor up all night like we was high on ecstasy, I
See emcees try to pep my recipe for success
Try to copy me, the way I rap, way I dress
Damn, I'm not impressed
Know you wanna be live
Wearing your hat to the side
You look like you wanna be Scribe

[Hook] x2
Ain't nobody else in the world that can flow like this
Take some words that I wrote
Put it down in a flow
Make it sound dope like this
It's my shit
That's why it sounds like
Like, like, like this

[Verse 2]
Yo I listen to my shit
Everywhere that I go
From my house to my car
On the way to my show
Just to spit my shit
My shit get you high quick
Switch it up, flip it up, my shit
Pick it up, slow it down, like this
My shit is so courageous
Everyday with the flow my shit is so tenacious
My shit is what we ride to
What we get high to
When I'm with my crew
Y'all know how I... do

[Hook] x2
Ain't nobody else in the world that can flow like this
Take some words that I wrote
Put it down in a flow
Make it sound dope like this
It's my shit
That's why it sounds like
Like, like, like this

[Verse 3]
Yeah, My shit is blowing up
Both hands, throw em up
Put it in the air
Say yeah we ain't slowing, no
I ain't stoppin' now
My shit is poppin' now
Industry, lock it down
It's that chocolate brown
Dude from the antipades(?)
Skills like good
Australia lovin' my shit like them hilltop hoods
When I roll through the city from
Melbourne to Sydney from
Adelaide to Perth
Got the Gold Coast with me
I get busy down in Brizzy
They see me, they on the d-low
They lovin' my songs
From Wollingong up to fre-o
Hey yo, my shit's so dope I could say nothin' on a track like sshhhh
(listen,.. You get me.)
