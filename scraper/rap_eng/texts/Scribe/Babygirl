Nothing I Wouldn't do for you my baby girl
No one else That means more to me in the whole world
No one else i would be with if i had one wish
No one else that could ever love you like this

No way I would Rather be and
Right here just you and me just
Laying 'round till lays are leaving
In your arms were full asleep
When I wake up you were try to leave
Trying to hold your back on your sleeve
But I know that you got to go so
Hope you know that
There was never that I would ever do that hurt you
Never leave your side, never would desert you
And you know I would ever be the first to
Tell you the truth even when it hurts to
Put that in reversal
Pray to god that you would do the same
For you ill walk through the rain
And thorugh the pain

Nothing I Wouldn't do for you my baby girl
No one else That means more to me in the whole world
No one else i would be with if i had one wish
No one else that could ever love you like this

Nothing I wouldn't do for you my baby girl
It's so beautiful never knew that you would touch
Me in a way that me make me wanna change the way
I used to do, how it used to be
I tell you truthfully
You know you only get the truth from me
I just want you to be happy
And I don't give a c that anybody loves you more than me
I hope you know that
There is no one else that ever could replace you
I would never take you for granted and every day I'm gratefull
And I will be eternally thankful
And on the 8th of April celebrate you
If you do I will be faithfull
I swear to God

Nothing I Wouldn't do for you my baby girl
No one else That means more to me in the whole world
No one else i would be with if i had one wish
No one else that could ever love you like this

[singing girl]
I don't want no one else
Girl you are the best
What am i to do if i ever loose you
[end singing]

When you're gone I cry for you my baby girl
I would die for you
And I would do anything that you want me to
I'll take the stars out the sky for you
I never knew a love love love like this
Tell me what am I supposed to do
Cause I would do anything in the world babygirl
If it means to be close to you
And you know that cause i show that
And I never hold back when it comes to my love for you
And it was like
Love on first night when we met at the hospital
And I ain't gonna lie so
I apologize 'cause I brought you in such a crazy world
But it's because it's I love you
No one has to love you
As my daughter as my baby girl

Nothing I Wouldn't do for you my baby girl
No one else That means more to me in the whole world
No one else i would be with if i had one wish
No one else that could ever love you like this
