[Intro]
Not your stereotypical type of individual
Types of individual
[?]

[Verse 1]
Far from the nonsense
While peeps walk the streets in their sleep
I stay conscious, ready to speak over beats for the needs
I represent a thousand souls who never made it this far
Watching from the other side of the stars
It's been a mission in mars
Pushing my music, not just amusement
I made this so you can use it for your own improvement
Not as an MC, as a human living on the same Earth
Breathing in the same pollution, everything was meant to be
Hip hop was sent to me, keep the fame the money
I hold it sentimentally
All material things will return to dust eventually
I'll be the MC whose lyrics will last infinitely
So to the death of me keep tryin' to snatch the breath of me
Negativity only ever brought out the best of me
It was my destiny to be one of the illest
I represent that to the fullest

[Hook]
Scribe take it serious check it, check it
Check it, each word each line perfected
Scribe original next level shit for you to listen to
Those who don't give a fuck I do
Scribe take it serious check it, check it
Check it, each word each line perfected
Scribe original next level shit for you to listen to
Those who don't give a fuck I do

[Verse 2]
Ay yo watch and observe a master of words
Internationally from the suburb
Where rhymes are never heard unless they're seen by the third
Always preferred droppin' rhymes over doin' crime
Captivated by hip hop doin' time
Sentenced for life, a life time of whippin' mics
Use my insight observe the world through ways alike
For yo I'm not gonna go the way this time I'm doin' whats right
I'm the Scribe I write it down and send it from my windpipe
I've been tight since the day of my birth
You can represent your neighborhood, money, guns, I represent Earth
Defender of the universe so choose a verse and test it
You'd be first to find the exit when I write my next shit
I'm doin' everything I said I would true to my word
Life is superb I'm finally gettin' what I deserve
And its like that what, so realise and recognise
And when you see me you won't have to wonder why

[Hook]
Scribe take it serious check it, check it
Check it, each word each line perfected
Scribe original next level shit for you to listen to
Those who don't give a fuck I do
Scribe take it serious check it, check it
Check it, each word each line perfected
Scribe original next level shit for you to listen to
Those who don't give a fuck I do

[Verse 3]
Ay yo who said I wasn't ready- that Scribe would never make it
The hateration only motivated me to take it
Kept hip hop sacred even though at times I felt forsaken
Make no mistake my skill is real there's no way you fake this
I had the hunger since I was younger with beats and pieces
Check my credentials the evidence to support my thesis
That's if you don't believe it look for yourself and see it
Open you ears and hear the deepest air and speak it

[Hook]
Scribe take it serious check it
Check it check it, each word each line perfected
Scribe original shit for you to listen to
Those who don't give a fuck I do
Scribe take it serious check it
Check it check it, each word each line perfected
Scribe original shit for you to listen to
Those who don't give a fuck I do
