[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, ain't no one like me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Congratulations, you made it
Welcome to The Crusader
It's been a long time coming yo
But I'm here now so what you wan' do?
How many dudes you really know
Can flow... like this?
Like this, like this, let's do it!

[Hook]
How many dudes you know roll like this?
How many dudes you know flow like this?
Not many, if any, not many, if any
How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know anybody

[Verse 1]
Check, check to the mic, check
A one two from the crew coming through, are you hype yet?
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something on Scribe
They ain't got nothing when I'm up and alive
And can't front when you're feeling the vibe
You know Scribe is taking you high
Love it with the double bass, vibrate
Shook the plates in your vertebrate
Yo, hit a man, move like a RS
Subaru with a crew come equipped like a body kit
Lyrically Bob Burnquist
So one foot is in the style through his tongue like a stale fish
This kid named X from the Vic
Wanna get with the Scribe in live like a oh-five
I got vibe like a beehive and when the muzzle from the squid
Of a pimp by the seaside and get down on the wave that we ride
Around town on the down low
Never know, what the flow bro, chop, chop
Can't stop hip-hop, cause it don't stop, hmm, check it out

[Pre-Hook]
(There's) Check it out
(No) Check it out
(One) Check it out
(Like me)

[Hook]
How many dudes you know roll like this?
How many dudes you know flow like this?
Not many, if any
Not many, if any
How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know anybody
How many dudes you know roll like this?
How many dudes you know flow like this?
Not many, if any
Not many, if any
How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know anybody

[Verse 2]
Something for the ride on cruise control
When the bass vibrates, shake the vibe like a earthquake
Though this state is not good for you
You made a great mistake, your eyes stop and bomp be gone
Sick of this, flick the switch, nitrous, kick wanna trip
This is some new shit, real deal like Cody Field
There's no telling if you ride like Mike, you just might
Roarck like doubie drop, doubie drop tight, T-club get it on
Representing all night, take flight like Nike kicks, the new tricks
And make quick, when the vibe hit, don't sit just get on down
And profound with sound that we found with the underground
Don't sit just get on down and profound with the sound
That we found with the underground

[Hook]
How many dudes you know roll like this?
How many dudes you know flow like this?
Not many, if any
Not many, if any
How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know anybody
How many dudes you know roll like this?
How many dudes you know flow like this?
Not many, if any
Not many, if any
How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this?
Uh-uh, uh-uh

It's all good, it's all good when you come down to my hood
And come to South Canterbury, it's all good uh, uh

And come to East Canterbury, it's all good
