[Intro]

[Hook] x2
Put your hands up, reach for the sky
Cuz we be on fire, we flame all night
And we be the elite in the game
And we in it for life
Like hey ! We some rock stars !
Bring it real live...

Put you hands, up high

[Verse 1]

[Hook] x2
Put your hands up, reach for the sky
Cuz we be on fire, we flame all night
And we be the elite in the game
And we in it for life
Like hey ! We some rock stars !
Bring it real live...
