[Intro]
Wake up it's time to go to school
I don't wanna go to school mommy
I'm gonna be a rapper one day...
And take you far away from here

[Verse 1]
[?]
To the day they say that I would get no radio play
To my years start fading away
Till these lyrics are gone
Till physically I can no longer perform
