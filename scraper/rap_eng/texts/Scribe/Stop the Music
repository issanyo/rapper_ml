[Verse 1: Scribe]
And I hope you feel my pain
Hope you don't forget my name
For the cause I claim and the reason I came
Tell me was it all in vain?
I walk ball and chain
Through the midnight rain I'd sing
And the man would say
Stop the music playing loud and clear
Cause they don't want to hear
Oh Lord they don't want to hear
But its loud and clear
And its deep inside my soul

[Hook: Scribe]
Raise some hands
Say my name
And let it Bang!
(Chorus x4)

[Verse 2]
And I refuse to lose, no
I've never been the type to quit
You'd probably give up now and just turn back around but that's one of many differences
Because I don't care what the distance is
I told you I'd take it all the way
I couldn't just walk away and just pretend like I don't have more to say
Stop the music playing loud and clear
Cause they don't want to hear
Oh Lord they don't want to hear
But its loud and clear
And its deep inside my soul
They can't hold me down no more
They got to let me go!

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Coz I know what I've gotta do
I couldn't stop now even if I wanted to
They told me give it up its impossible
I never bury my head in the sand like the ostrich do
And I'm young and I still got a lot to prove
I can't stop, won't stop, unstoppable
Elevator looking down on all obstacles
Until I heard a voice from the other side of the room, telling me to
Stop the music playing loud and clear
Cause they don't want to hear
Oh Lord they don't want to hear
But its loud and clear
And its deep inside my soul
They can't hold me down no more
They got to let me go!
