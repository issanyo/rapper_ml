[Intro]
Yeah, it's the remix
P-Money on the beat
You know how we do it
It's my girl song
So ladies listen up
This is about my lady
She knows who she is
Ayo, let's do it

[Verse 1]
When I'm with you I feel I can do anything
I can just spread my wings, I can just say some things
Because I feel comfortable when I'm around you girl
We can do what you like, me and you against the world
Ever since the day you came, I haven't felt no pain
I'll never be the same now I know I love you

[Chorus]
More than all my kicks, more than all my clothes
(Yeah, love you way more than that)
More than all my friends, more than all my flows
(I love you more than hip-hop, I told you)
More than everything, you were there for me
Just like you said you'd be (just like you said it)
Through my darkest days, my coldest nights (yup)
Kept hold me tight, you said I'd be alright
I wish I could turn back time to when you were mine
(My lady, that's my lady)

[Verse 2]
Yo
Two words: me and you, let's just get away
Far away from it all, let's find a better day
Everything's alright, we talked all night
On the phone, let's go, just us all alone
I know I was unsure before
But now I see I love you more

[Chorus]
More than all my kicks, more than all my clothes
(Love you way more than that)
More than all my friends, more than all my flows
(I love you more than hip-hop, I told you)
More than everything, you were there for me
Like you said you'd be (jug)
Through my darkest day, my coldest night
Kept hold me tight
You said I'd be alright
I wish I could turn back time
To when you were mine

[Verse 3]
Never thought you would be everything that I'd need
Everything I ever wanted in you I can see
And then we made love, from the car to the house
To the hall on the wall, from the floor to the couch
Then I went away on your, you said you miss my touch
I replied, "I love you", you asked me how much

[Chorus]
More than all my kicks, more than all my clothes
More than all my friends, more than all my flows
More than everything, you were there for me

[Outro]
I love you
More than all that shit
More than everything
My lady
Uh, yeah
We out, bounce, bounce, bounce
