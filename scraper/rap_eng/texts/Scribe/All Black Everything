All black everything, black cards, blacks cars, all black everything all-all black everything (x5)

[Verse1: Scribe]
Yeah, you know I'm all black everything
Married to the game all black wedding ring
Always been repping for my all black team
Since I was a little boy and had all black dreams
Now I'm rolling got the skills you never seen
I am the Mils Muliaina, making hits for my team
It's what I do
Hey, so tell me what you gonna do, uh !
What you gonna do when I Ma'a Nonu you ?
You know my skills Sonny Bill always hey ! (x3)
I'm Cory Jane I run the track all day hey !
And you don't even have to say that I killed it
Just let them know that I am back Zac Guildford
That's why you gotta run harder, and plan smarter
Cause it's my turn to kick it, Dan Carter

[Verse 2: Scribe]
Second phase, centre stage, watch the S flow
All Blacks y'all know who the best bro!
All black everything is the dress code
I'm going at them in my all black test mode
And when I hit it there's only one way that I know
I'm spitting every line hard Jerome Kaino
It's my time so, don't even try to slow me down
I'll run circles around them with a blindfold
I never stop when I start I am a carver
I'm ready keep them waiting like Isaia Toeava
So I wouldn't even bother cause my team destined to win it
No we not English but we the best in it
No limit to the heart it's all in passion
No gimmicks just hard work and practice
Now it's time to put the words into action
And let them know who the best on the atlas
It's all black, everything
