[Verse 1 - Scribe]
Yah, yah, I said I'm so high
Put me on this year we number 1
Pass a beer, cheers never thought we be up in here
Christchurch city, so pretty in the summer time
We drop a summer rhyme and it got to be double time
So high, lazy eye down for whatever, uh, uh
They know I'm better then the 19th letter (Letter)
As to the shizzy, a rizzy, a busy man
Can rap to get dizzy, can't get busy the way I can
I'm well known to expand on ya
I'll leave you touch with out even laying a hand on ya
Ya know the who, who, yo we coming through (Through)
Represent my crew (Crew)
Taking you on a ride a ride is like

[Hook - Ladi6]
Oh, its sound's so nice
You're the love of mine, you're the love of mine
Oh, its sound's so nice
And you're the love of mine, you're the love of mine

[Verse 2 - Scribe]
Yo, I heard about it back in '86
When I went to school with Voodoo Child, Spex fam' and Ladi 6
8:30 sharp at the alley on Carisbrook
We might be late yo but we got to wait for Cook
Back in the day you know my brother was the man then
Battles came to and end when he drop his hand stand
Could never tell her how I felt about her
I just keep it inside me while the other people crowd around her
But I was in the back, thinking of little raps
Scheming on a way so I could make contact
We fell in love in the struggle over the wrong rap
'Round the time I got caught stealing from the top rack
She encouraged me showed me how to stop that
Made me realise that I was chilling with the wrong cats
So just for you I sat down to write this song phat
To let you know that Scribe is back and on track
(Track)

[Hook - Ladi6]
Oh, it sound's so nice
You're the love of mine, you're the love of mine
Oh, it sound's so nice
And you're the love of mine, you're the love of mine
(Yeah, yo)

[Verse 3 - Scribe]
I do this for my fam', even Geoff saw you did stand
Pre 23 little pom from Peter Pan
My brother T, Ju Ju most importantly my mum and dad
Spex fam' and Ladi 6, the sisters that I never had
Things aren't so bad yo the Scribe got a pen and pad
This year we are taking over, ain't no more holding back
Shout to my cousin Jazz Reece, Quita Anuheara
My aunty Helen, Peter, Tasmo, Janet and Anita
And to the Smithy's, Anorto and Giddy
Elaina, Jonny Solomon, Ebalie and Libby
And all the Simpsons, mmm

Just know you with me no matter what I do, do

It's my entire crew you could never stop it, stop it
Yeah, you know

[Hook - Ladi6]
Oh, its sound's so nice

Oh, its sound's so nice
