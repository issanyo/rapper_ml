(Dilz - Verse 1)
Thursday night I've finally got you over, haven't even showered you don't care about my odour, took a look in the mirror thought I was staring at an ogre, but you give me that feeling like I'm not a no hoper, it’s been a long day I couldn’t wait to see you, it’s almost like I need you, I hope that you think me too, I left my last girl just so we could be together, there’s no understanding but I know it’s you and me forever, and whenever our lips touch, I'm feeling like it's love, emotions are mixed up, I’m feeling a bit stuck, the doctor wants separated, I’m devastated, loving you is second nature, with you I’m alive, look I’m the type of guy that is with you ride or die, though I shouldn’t really drive, babe you are knowing why after seeing my friend killed, I want you by my side though it’s driving me mental

(J.Williams - Hook)
Can we be strangers once again, can we take away the start so we don’t need to end, you’re that girl I wish I never met, but there’s nothing I regret.. I’d rather be Lonely, I’d rather be lonely, but you are my one and only..

(Dilz - Verse 2)
When its time to open up you do it so literally, then i try to talk and you don't listen to me, I'm always putting you down, your pouring everything out without making a sound, Im feeling empty inside, your looking empty yourself, when it comes to you and I, I think your meant to be shelved, You get along with my parents well, you always look great and appearance sell but, its clear as hell that your only wanting the fun, from the moment we begun I thought “she is the one”, I was in a dark place you helped with seeing the sun, now the side of my mouth’s bout to meet with a gun, wanna grab you by the neck but you'd like that, yelling in your face and you don't fight back, thinking bout the nights that I laid in the cold with ya, come to find out I’ve been dating a gold digger, shit..

(Scribe - Verse 3)
Listen, reminiscing to times where, you were right here with me living my nightmares, you can see it in my eyes when I stare, the dream that I shared, lit up brighter than times square, you know I cared for you even cried tears, had to fight fair, no one said that this life’s fair, so nights when I start missing you like desert rain, I drown my sorrows hope tomorrow I don’t feel no pain, when I go to sleep I’m praying that these feelings change, when I wake up in the morning I still feel the same, was this really love or is it just a game, you gotta tell it to my heart baby Taylor Dayne, and this is not a joke nah I’m not Daymon Wayans, I don’t want more money I still feel Major Payne, but I’m grateful Mary Jane saved me from Kristov, love drunk I’m pissed off, made me wanna slit my wrist off, damn..

(Dilz - Outro)
Chardonnay’s apart of me, pardon me, my harmony and bliss is getting kisses from this girl I love that visits, I see her on the corner, pick her up I know I want her, need to taste what she will offer, love drunk and I’ma goner x 2
