[Verse 1]
Scribe and Ali and yeah, we still together
Through the stormiest weather it's been a long forever
Holding it down in the South surrounded by the Southern Alps
With the lyrics heartfelt if you know what I’m talking 'bout
Then throw your hands in the air. I freestyle in the square
Then I'll catch a number five so I can rock on the pier
Get live I'm 90.5 the Main Source Show
Spell it out for cats who don't know bout the F L O
And we how move through the rain, sleet, hail, and snow
Rocking mic with our minds, heart, body, and soul
I'll be unsigned hype till I get creative control
And I know the haters praying that the Scribe won't blow
But (it's too late) and I made it like that
I sacrificed everything just to get where I'm at
And to be honest, I'm not stopping till I'm counting them grands
And everything's on schedule and according to plan

[Hook]
But so you're out of time if you think you fucking with mine because
(it's too late)
I know you didn't want to see Scribe and Ali doing our thing but
(it's too late)
Yo, smiling at my face stab me in the back, it's cool because
(it's too late)
Because I'm here now; it's our year but for you
(it's too late)

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's too late Scribe and Ali since '98
Still going, were still flowing like a can of Speights
Still cut up the vinyl plates like a piece of cake
Still write songs to stimulate your mental state
Sharpen your state of mind; catch up yo, you way behind
Like even your anatomical clock is out of time
We on a mission, moving up at a steady pace
Aiming for first place, so we got no time to waste
And you can do it too, the Scribe is gonna show you how
The only trick is that you got to d-d-do it now
And stop sitting around like you got nothing to do
Say you can't do it then its already too late for you
Take out a leaf out of rhyme book you know I made it through
Can't teach a crowd if you can even educate the crew
You know I came prepared training for several years
I made it here without a second to spare

[Hook]
But so you're out of time if you think you fucking with mine because
(it's too late)
I know you didn't want to see Scribe and Ali doing our thing but
(it's too late)
Yo, smiling at my face stab me in the back, it's cool because
(it's too late)
Because in here now it’s our year but for you
(it's too late)

[Verse 3]
Said it's too late for haters out there trying to stop me now
You never heard, yo, I submerged from the underground
This time I'm staying up and I ain't never coming down
I made it this far and I did it all by myself
So think twice if you think gonna take me out
Said you don't know me and you don't know what my crew's about
Cause we've been doing this. We're not new to this
And we've been proving we're forever staying true to this
Get with the movement as I’m not hanging round for long
In fact, I'm gone, you're too late you better check my song
You know this lyricist individualist
MC puri-slash communication specialist
Even when effortless my skill can still rip a show
This Scribe is definite so don't act like you didn't know
I know you know my rhyme and you flow it line for line
But it's too late to decipher cause you out of time

[Hook]
But so you're out of time if you think you fucking with mine because
(it's too late)
I know you didn't want to see Scribe and Ali doing our thing but
(it's too late)
Yo, smiling at my face stab me in the back, it's cool because
(it's too late)
Because in here now it’s our year but for you
(it's too late)
