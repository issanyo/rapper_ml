[Intro] x4
Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !
Chea chea chea chea !
[?]

[Verse 1]
I get up off the ground
Brush the dirt off my clothes
Look around and see I'm outnumbered
Surrounded by foes
If an average man had to stand and carry my load
He would have chose to fold
And surrendered a long time ago
But not me though, I'm not that average Joe
You ain't bout [?]
I've got the heart of a king and a warriors soul
That's why [?] till the day that I go

[Hook] x2
I am a champion, I never say die
Even when all hope is gone, I'm still gonna try
Because I cannot [?] and let them win
And if I fall, I get back up and stand again
I am a...

[Verse 2]
Champion, why you look so surprised ?
When you met you had surely sworn
I'd met my demise
Ya'll left me hanging on the edge of a cliff
So I hung...
Watched you walk away and then disappear into the sun
And even though my arms were numb
I just couldn't fail
And I climbed muy way back up, tooth and nail
And yeah I just had to prevail
To ensure my revenge
So when the smoked cleared
I'd be the last one left in the end

[Hook] x2
I am a champion, I never say die
Even when all hope is gone, I'm still gonna try
Because I cannot [?] and let them win
And if I fall, I get back up and stand again
I am a...

[Verse 3]
Champion, knock me down to the floor
Every time I'm down it's guaranteed
I get up once more
I've got too much heart to not
Too much heart to not
Came from nothing I made it all the way to the top
[?]
My skills are unseen, I'm the man
[?]
Y'all ain't hot to me, my flow is like sunscreen !

[Hook] x2
I am a champion, I never say die
Even when all hope is gone, I'm still gonna try
Because I cannot [?] and let them win
And if I fall, I get back up and stand again
