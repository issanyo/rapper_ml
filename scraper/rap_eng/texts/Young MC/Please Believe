[Verse 1]
Now, I'm an audiophile kicking audio files
Who started as a baby as an audio child
I got behind the mic to show my audio style
Then I flipped the script to make the audio wow
My flow will make the girlies give a sexy smile
Cause they know this bro will go the extra mile
When I'm not onstage, I keep a low profile
But I still kick a verse because I'm versatile
So your head starts boppin' and your toes could tap
Or whatever other body movement goes with that
Other rappers come around with the flows they chat
But they don't measure up to mine, and yo, I told them that
Every stage I stood and every seat I sat
Had a mic in my hand with something sweet I spat
Cause it's just cool like that, I lyrically achieve
And I'mma give it to ya proper, baby, please believe

[Hook]
I'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe
I got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe
Lotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived
Because I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave
I'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe
I got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe
Lotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived
Because I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave

[Verse 2]
Now, I paid my dues, sacrificed a lot
To make sure these flows come out nice and hot
Wanna count me out? My advice: should not
Because I ain't in the mood to sacrifice my spot
I didn't make no plan or devise some plot
I simply made the call to give all I got
Yo, and some of these cats don't deserve their slot
Because they got global warming and they still ain't hot
See, hip hop music's like a part of my soul
Like a part that's dominating and its taking control
Cause I see a lot of actors that be faking the role
And the part that they be faking is what's making me whole
See, they're banking on the fact we're singing rap on a row
But neglect how the effect of putting rap in a hole
Rappers missing the goal, I won't be naive
Yo, I'mma give it to ya proper, baby, please believe

[Hook]
I'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe
I got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe
Lotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived
Because I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave
I'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe
I got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe
Lotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived
Because I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave

[Verse 3]
Please believe that my rhymes ain't gentle
Defeat the comp or stay complimental
And none of these incidents are incidental
When I bust my rhyme over the instrumental
Mental, physical, lyrical flow
I let you know the dealie if you really don't know
And if you actin' silly, then its really gon' show
Cause they got the pedigree to see it's really gon' blow
Yo, I been doing this right here for way back
I paid dues, now its the time for payback
I'm stepping up, I got no time to lay back
So if you miss a line, press rewind to playback
And give yourself a present like it's Christmas Eve
Cause I got a little something for ya up my sleeve
Yo, forget about the notions that were preconceived
Cause I'mma give it to ya proper, baby, please believe

[Hook]
I'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe
I got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe
Lotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived
Because I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave
I'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe
I got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe
Lotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived
Because I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave
I'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe
I got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe
Lotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived
Because I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave
I'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe
I got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe
Lotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived
Because I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave
