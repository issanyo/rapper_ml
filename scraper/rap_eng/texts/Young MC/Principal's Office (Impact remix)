Now normally if I can help it
I don't spend a lot of time in the principal's office

What!? Nine o'clock

Now as I get to school, I hear the late bell ringing
Running through the hall, I hear the glee club singing
Get to the office, I can hardly speak
'Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week
So to my first class I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And when I get to the room, I hear the teacher say
"Mr. Young, I'm happy that you could join us today"
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up I find there's gum on my seat
And with the seat stuck to me, I raise my hand and say
"Excuse me, but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?"
The teacher got upset and she screamed out "No"
It's off to the principal's office you go

Twelve o'clock comes with mass hysteria
Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And when I tried the applesauce, I heard it crunch
I'm running up the stairs with a front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed and says, "you must be jokin'"
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke 'cause my front tooth is out of place
So I walk through school with ice on my lip
A nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I walk and I'm dragging it
No school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it
Forget class, I'ma shoot some ball
With a late pass I've got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says, "Whaddya know?
It's off to the principal's office you go"

Recess

Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feelings
Give me a week, me and the girl will be dealin
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said, "Hi, my name is Marvin, known as Young MC"
But then the bell rang and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes will begin
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hope that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me, "You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you"
So then I sat there reeling and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, The sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter
When I finished the note it was ready to pass
The teacher took it and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
Even my girl was laughing, it was too late
No need to write another note, 'cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me and I said, "I know
It's off to the principal's office I go"

Yo, you think this bad?
Wait 'til I get my report card
