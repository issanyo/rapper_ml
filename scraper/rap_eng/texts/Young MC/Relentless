[Hook]
I'm relentless, that's the way I meant this
I'm relentless, watch me represent this
I'm relentless, no you can't prevent this
I'm relentless, ahhhhh

[Verse 1]
Now if you give me a sec, watch a brother wreck
Watch a brother rhyme, watch a brother cash that check
Cause I got skills to put the heat on deck
But guarantee y'all ain't getting me on spec
Cause I get paid for my dialect
Any other way, I'mma say, "I object!"
So let this go when I disconnect
Put the disco back into the discotheque
Ladies, fellas, how you feel?
I got something I must reveal
Anybody out there wanna know the deal?
It's relentless, meant this, keeping this real
Moving fast with the mass appeal
If you wanna ride, baby, let me take the wheel
Tires squeal, that's what my intent is
Young man moving, ooh, relentless

[Hook]
I'm relentless, that's the way I meant this
I'm relentless, watch me represent this
I'm relentless, no you can't prevent this
I'm relentless, ahhhhh

[Verse 2]
Secondary, secretary
Best to keep up cause it's getting hairy
Permanent flow, not temporary
Cause the fellow on the mic is like legendary
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
God may grow if its light and airy
Rounds are quite tight but it might be scary
Watch him take flight like a white canary
Up, up, and away, lets go see
It look good up there, I must agree
You like this joint, now, well, its all me
No tellin' how hella high this gon' be
School of rap, I got my degree
Equivalent of the PhD
Plain to see, you can't circumvent this
Young man moving, ooh, relentless

[Hook]
I'm relentless, that's the way I meant this
I'm relentless, watch me represent this
I'm relentless, no you can't prevent this
I'm relentless, ahhhhh

[Verse 3]
Relentless, let me count the ways I meant this
Coming out into many ways I sent this
Lyrically, its the way I present this
Now pick on, but check on the way I bent this
Cracked a tooth, you better call your dentist
Tried to bite, but yo its hard to dent this
On my grizza, but I'm not from Memphis
So call up Trump because you found your apprentice
To all of those that would try to prevent this
Whatever reason you seem to present this
Once I leave, I'll be leaving you senseless
Got no D, so you're feelin' defenseless
It's like cash in the bank when I spent this
I got a rep so I gotta represent this
Thank you very much if you want to compliment this
Young man moving, ooh, relentless

[Hook]
I'm relentless, that's the way I meant this
I'm relentless, watch me represent this
I'm relentless, no you can't prevent this
I'm relentless, ahhhhh
I'm relentless, that's the way I meant this
I'm relentless, watch me represent this
I'm relentless, no you can't prevent this
I'm relentless, ahhhhh
