[Hook]
In the morning, in the evening
When you comin', baby when you leavin'
If you can't sleep, guess we're even
Cause you best believe it
It's all about you, you, you, you
It's all about you, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
First time, pool slide, you was taking it out
Water getting on your body, you were shaking it out
Had the brothers saying, "Man, baby raking it out"
Summer's getting in my eye, but I was making it out
But before too long you were back on the block
Hearing gossip and talk behind your back on the block
I'm just knocking on your door, I ain't cracking a lock
Cause you ain't have a suitcase, but you was packing a lot
So I came with a plan and an opening line
To get in your heart, baby, open your mind
Yeah, we all got issues, I'm coping with mine
But that notwithstanding, I'm hoping to shine
I know lots of guys try to holler at you
Acting kinda wild, coming out of the blue
But I got more here than them other guys do
Cause this song ain't all about me, no, it's all about you

[Hook]
In the morning, in the evening
When you comin', baby, when you leavin'
If you can't sleep, guess we're even
Cause you best believe it
It's all about you
In the morning, in the evening
When you comin', baby when you leavin'
If you can't sleep, guess we're even
Cause you best believe it
It's all about you, you, you, you
It's all about you, you, you, ah

[Verse 2]
Next time, late night, you were out at the club
So fresh, so clean, hoppin' out of the tub
You about to do a track with a vocal or dub
With the guys all starin', only hopin' to rub
And me, I performed, I was up on the stage
With tracks from the lab, lyrics off of the page
I turned out the spot then collected my wage
And asked you for your time, cell number, and age
Excuse me if now I'm seeming too bold
Or warm up if now I'm seeming too cold
My main job for now is feeling your soul
Cause its more than a microphone I need to hold
There's many good things we could hop into
If you're feeling these lyrics that are parley-voo
But you gotta let me know it if I overdo
Because this song ain't all about me, no, its all about you

[Hook]
In the morning, in the evening
When you comin', baby, when you leavin'
If you can't sleep, guess we're even
Cause you best believe it
It's all about you
In the morning, in the evening
When you comin', baby when you leavin'
If you can't sleep, guess we're even
Cause you best believe it
It's all about you, you, you, you
It's all about you, you, you, ah

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm no expert in the [?] fare
But I think the two of us would make an alright pair
And it feels real good whenever you're right here
And it feels even better when its your idea
Doesn't matter what day, week, month, or year
I wanna hold you close, whisper in your ear
Like twenty-twenty vision, I can see this clear
And all the [?] transmission that'll never change gears
The first time you got my attention
A borderline divine intervention
We'll take this thing to its full extension
Stay with you so long you can share my pension
And share each day, girl, that we go through
Call you any nickname that you want me to
Sweet Thing, Sweet Heart, Baby Girl, or Boo
Cause this song ain't all about me, no, its all about you

[Hook]
In the morning, in the evening
When you comin', baby, when you leavin'
If you can't sleep, guess we're even
Cause you best believe it
It's all about you
In the morning, in the evening
When you comin', baby when you leavin'
If you can't sleep, guess we're even
Cause you best believe it
It's all about you, you, you, you
It's all about you, you, you, ah
