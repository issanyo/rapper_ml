And you don't stop
And you don't stop
And you don't stop
And you don't stop

(I'll go)
You better keep on your jacket cause it's cold outside
(I'll go)
And I don't need you to worry that I run and hide
(I'll go)
Best believe me, my darling, when I tell you so
(I'll go)
Wherever you want to take me, that's where I will go

[ VERSE 1 ]
Listen to the rhyme as I kick it
I used to think that every single woman was wicked
I used to think that she would step to me and then do me wrong
Because I made some dollars from a hip-hop song
Now I know I'm being kind of hard on them
But the girlies used to do me like an ATM
Walk up smilin, move like a flash
Push a couple of buttons and step with the cash
So here you come like a diamond in the rough
Talkin sensible and not the same old stuff
But I was still scared and actin kinda timid
Because the other girlies really pushed me to the limit
But now I think I've had a change of heart
Because I feel kinda empty when we're apart
And I don't wanna lose ya, so now I let you know
Wherever you want to take me I'll go

[ 8X ]
(I'll go)
And you don't stop

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now I wanna say I'm sorry for everything I did
I'm lookin like a man but I'm actin like a kid
I wanna get witcha but still I'm movin slow
A man is always frightened of the things he doesn't know
But yo, that doesn't mean that I should do you wrong
Because we been together for oh so long
And you've been with me through thick and through thin
So it's about time I should let you in
So baby, baby, you're the light of my life
You're the apple of my eye, someday you might be my wife
I wasn't bonin or hittin skins like all the rest
Because I been boneless and skinless like a chicken breast
So come with me and I'll come with you
It doesn't really matter, baby, what you wanna do
I'm sayin yes to ya cause I'm sick of sayin no
And wherever you want to take me I'll go

[ 8X ]
(I'll go)
And you don't stop

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now if you have a little trouble choosin
I'll tell you with the Young one you will never be losin
Always tell the truth, never give an excuse and
By the way you'll never find me smokin or boozin
See, I'm nothin like the men that you had before
With a wam-bam, thank you m'am and then snore
I'm tellin you straight, cause that's the way that I am
There's a whole bunch of room between the wam and the bam
Consequently or incidentally
I want to love you slow and then caress you gently
I treat you like a queen and not like a hooker
The other guys be illin because they think you're such a looker
I'll be your jacket when it's cold outside
And I don't need you to worry that I run and hide
Best believe me, my darling, when I tell you so
Wherever you want to take me, that's where I will go

[ 8X ]
(I'll go)
And you don't stop
