[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen
In the next ten rounds for the heavyweight championship of the world

[Verse 1]
Now I have won 1 million battles, take MCs, round 'em up like cattle
Grant em and then I lock em up in a pen
And if they want another try then I will do it again
Because my name is Young MC and rockin' a mic is my craft
But when I first started everyone just laughed
Cause I got rocked 'n rolled, left out in the cold
Cause I was tryin' to battle men when I was ten years old
But time went by and I got wise
And every time I did a party, well I opened my eyes
Until now ya see before, the guy who won't ignore ya
Won't be talkin' about the girlies, like I read on Latoya
See I am just that kind of fella
Sometimes rough, most other time mellow
Gather a crowd when I start rappin' out loud
And I am here to rock a party, that's what I vowed
So, just like Clark Kent is into Superman
I become a super hero when the mic's in my hand
Cause I am hard to swallow, a tough act to follow
I'm solid straight through while the others are hollow
Cause I been rockin' parties since I was a child
And every time place that I went, I made the crowd go wild
It wasn't hard for me to do it, there was really nothing to it
And not once did I hear someone say, yo Young MC ya blew it
So listen party people I got something to say
I guess I'm just like Burger King, because you have it your way
You know it makes me delighted to think that I'm a rhymin' writer
So next time I have a party, I'll make sure that your invited
The jam of the year, I'll hold it right here
And after all is said and done, I like to make it quite clear
That I came here tonight to have some fun, my name is Young MC
Backwards it's MC Young. I let 'em know

[Hook 1]
I let 'em know

[Verse 2]
Now, one an' one is two and two an' two make four
My name is Young, I rock the house, we're talkin' rhymes galore
It doesn't matter who you are, or who you want to be
You'll never ever rock as nasty as the Young MC
So now darlin', darlin' come and see my show
You want a ticket then I get you one in the front row
And you can bring a friend, yes a girl perhaps
And when the show is over, come sit on my lap
Because you can't resist me, neither can your friend
It starts in the beginnin' finishes up at the end
And all these others come around and swear they're better than me
When they can't even deal with the Young MC
I mean they think they in command, but they're out of control
They think that they're out of jail, they're only on parole
They think they're walkin' on water when they're on a jet ski
They think they hot on the mic, they ain't as hot as me
They think they flyin' through the air, when they on a plane
They think they have a sound mind, when they goin' insane
They think they lyin' on the beach, when there ain't no sand
They think that they the freshest rapper, they ain't heard the man
So let me tell you party people this is how it goes
I am the one you listen to, cause I'm the one you chose
And if you think they competition, they can deal with me
Here is my number, call the house, the name is Young MC
I let 'em know

[Hook 2]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I let 'em know
Break it down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
They said a boy is a boy and a girl is a girl
And Young MC, he is a rapper ready to rock world
I am a man with a skill, of a duty to fulfill
Of party goers every which without the need to get ill
No need to scream and to shout, cause that's not what I'm about
Cause I'm a man who's rockin' the jams, to this there is no doubt
Continuing with my tale, to never flop or to fail
Be good to you just like a discount at a one day sale
I'm not a criminal or hood, neither the riff or raff
If every rapper was a comic, I'd be makin' you laugh
If every rapper was a worker, I'd be chief of the staff
And on a scale of one to ten, I am a ten and a half
If every rapper was a lion, I'd be king of the beast
If every rapper was a cop, I'd be chief of police
If every rapper was a soldier, I would be Rambo
If every rapper was Hawaiian, I would be Don Ho
You're a fish who's out of water, I'm a great white shark
I'm a healthy burst of lightin', you're a shot in the dark
I'm a law abidin' citizen, you're breakin' the laws
And I'm a man who's almost perfect, you're filled with flaws
This is not exaggeration, this is straight up truth
Rap is to me what good sex is to Dr. Ruth
Rap is just like sex cause I'm aimin' to please
But when you're listenin' to my rhyme, you'll never catch a disease
Now like a man once said, when you're slow ya blow
To prevent against this I'm always good to go
Never ever frontin' moves, I'm makin' sure of stuff
And when the mic is in my hand, that's when the stuff get rough
Cause I'm a man who's on a mission and I'm not done yet
Cause this is rougher then the roughest of the rough stuff yet
I make noise like a smoke detector when there's smoke
And I'm good to go, so now you know the Young MC's no joke
I let em know

[Hook 3]
Word em up, I let em know
There it is
