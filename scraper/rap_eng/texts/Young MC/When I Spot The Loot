[Intro]
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Money, paper
Cheese, cheddar
Scrilla, spot the loot

[Hook]
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute

[Verse 1]
Paper chase, it's a paper chase
And if you don't think so, let me make the case
On your mark, get set, gotta make the race
And if you come into my lane, you better make some space
Cause folks'll do anything to get that note
Like politicians out tryna get that vote
Or the media following to get that quote
And if you fall short, baby, that's all she wrote
Whether rich or poor, people want some more
Wanna do a little better than they did before
They can hate their job, but they know the score
That the paycheck's simply what they working for
Wanna buy anything from a fancy store
Or get the nice out by the shore
Ladies to adore, lookin' hot and cute
That's what I think about when I spot the loot

[Hook]
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute

[Verse 2]
I first grabbed the mic when I heard the beat
And then laid the hot joint to alert the street
But I had to do more than just serve the heat
Had to raise the bottom line on my balance sheet
Had to make my mission statement clear
Just to put hot songs into your ear
To erase my doubts, overcome my fear
And transform my hobby into a career
If you understand that, you can understand this
I put every bit of effort into how I planned this
On tour to ensure the fans that man this
With my eyes on the prize so I'll expand this
I worked hard to get it, you can take it from me
But you better get your own, you can't take it from me
Cause I'm breaking in, see, like a top recruit
And that's how I go about it when I spot the loot

[Hook]
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute

[Verse 3]
Light bill, phone bill, cable bill, damn
Gas bill, water bill, got me in a jam
Internet, Blackberry, they know who I am
And that's on top of breaking off Uncle Sam
And I ain't even mention either mortgage or rent
Or the car, no payment for the money they lent
And the credit card charge, man, its hard to prevent
No matter how much you make, its like its already spent
Now there ain't no doubt that it's hard to cope
But that ain't no reason to give up hope
You can see yourself sliding the slope
But if you reach out ya hand, you might find a rope
Now here's my point, and there's no dispute
Yo, for hard work, there's no substitute
If you plant a seed, then you'll bed a fruit
And that's the way I feel about it when I spot the loot

[Hook]
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute
(Hey!)
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute
(One more!)
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute
(Hey!)
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
When I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit
And any other alternative does not compute
