[Intro]
Now normally if I can help But I don't spend a lot of time in a principal's office
(RING!!!)
What?
9'o clock

[Verse 1]
Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing
Runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing
And as I get to the office I can hardly speak
Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week
So to my first class I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And as I get to the room I hear the teacher say
"Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today"
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat
So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand
And said, "Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?"
The teacher got upset, and she screamed out "No!
It's off the principal's office you go."

[Verse 2]
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria
Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke cause my front tooth is out of place
So I walked to school with ice on my lip
The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I'm walking, I'm dragging
Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it
Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball
With the late pass I got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says "What do you know?
It's off to the prinicipal's office you go."

Recess!

[Verse 3]
Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feelings
Give me a week B, and the girl'll be dealing
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said "Hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC"
But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes would begin
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me "You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you"
So then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, the sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter
When I finished the note, it was ready to pass
The teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
Even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late
For me to write another note cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me, and I said "I know
It's off to the principal's office I go."

Yo, you think this is bad, wait 'til I get my report card
