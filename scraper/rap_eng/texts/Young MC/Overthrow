[Spoken Intro]
Friends, homies, and countrymen
Lend me your ears
Let me holla at you for a minute
We found ourselves at a unique moment in time
A time to seize upon a golden opportunity
A time for the overthrow
A time to give a voice to those who have lost their voice
To speak for those who have no status in the current status quo
A time for us to make history by simply changing history
It starts here, it starts now
It's the overthrow

[Verse 1]
Now I'm pleased to profess, from the east to the west
That there's something going on that I need to address
Some feelings in my heart that I need to express
And some possible solutions I need to suggest
The world I see is a world of excess
That's enjoyed by a few and in spite of the rest
The words that they speak and the way that they dress
And the rest fall back because we say we're impressed
I see a lot of good people go through stress
Because they won't sell their soul for the gold of success
I know I'm not alone in pointing out this mess
But to get a coalition, you gotta coalesce
Suppose this one goes out to those who oppress
Don't care about your clothes or the roads you possess
To make progress, I gotta let you know
You must bear witness to the overthrow

[Hook]
It's the overthrow
I'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow
Cause that's over, bro
And it's not over property or over dough
Throw the hourglass up, time's over yo
It's the overthrow
I'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow
Cause that's over, bro
And it's not over property or over dough
Throw the hourglass up, time's over yo

[Verse 2]
While at home in your palace on your throne with your chalice
I'mma creep up from behind with no meaning of malice
Don't need to be rude, and no need to be callous
Avoid the shot [?] from [?] to Dallas
You're making so much money that you pack it away
A lot more than was available back in the day
I'm reacting the same, look at this whole thing now
You keep this up, you gon' bring this whole thing down
I won't stand still just to watch this fail
Cause the actions of some of them beyond repair
So well this train just went off the rails
But if we stand up now, then we must prevail
Cause there's so many souls who could tell the tale
Let me give you a tip: we gonna tip the scales
I'mma blaze the trail so we all can grow
But you must bear witness to the overthrow

[Hook]
It's the overthrow
I'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow
Cause that's over, bro
And it's not over property or over dough
Throw the hourglass up, time's over yo
It's the overthrow
I'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow
Cause that's over, bro
And it's not over property or over dough
Throw the hourglass up, time's over yo

[Verse 3]
Lullaby and goodnight, but the rhymes that I write
That you can't get away from, try as you might
You had your chance, but you were high as a kite
So because of your sin, now you're in for a fight
The rap industries wanna speak up tonight
For those in the know where they're feeling my plight
They smile in your face, but it just isn't right
Cause they promise you Paris, but they give you parasites
My metaphors are nice when I turn a phrase
And they can be interpreted in different ways
So if somebody out there has got you crazed
Use this song for what you want, man, I won't be phased
Look, there's so many folks feel oppressed these days
But if you got nerve, you deserve some praise
They'll be amazed when you let them know
That they must bear witness to the overthrow

[Hook]
It's the overthrow
I'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow
Cause that's over, bro
And it's not over property or over dough
Throw the hourglass up, time's over yo
It's the overthrow
I'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow
Cause that's over, bro
And it's not over property or over dough
Throw the hourglass up, time's over yo
It's the overthrow
I'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow
Cause that's over, bro
And it's not over property or over dough
Throw the hourglass up, time's over yo
It's the overthrow
I'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow
Cause that's over, bro
And it's not over property or over dough
Throw the hourglass up, time's over yo

[Spoken Outro]
Now, let me make this clear
Just because I'm a veteran in this game
Doesn't mean I feel anyone owes me anything
I'm not looking for some kind of handout
But you don't need to engage in affirmative action
In order to engage in action which is affirmative
Know what I'm saying?
I'm not looking for the proverbial forty acres and a mule
I just want equal access to the real estate agent and the car dealership
And once I get through that door
I will handle my business, please believe
But until that day, you must bear witness to the overthrow
