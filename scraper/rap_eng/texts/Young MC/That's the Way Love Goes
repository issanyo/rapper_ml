(Yuh huh)
(Hey hey)

Okay, this is what I say
About when I was a young man
Back in the day
I see a young lady
Thinking she was fine
Then I try to step to her
Just to make her mine
Bet, I proceed with a plan
Tellin' her how I could be her man

Lookin' in her eyes
While I tossed the bait
But she threw it right back in my face
Now I wanted this girl just to talk to me
But she wouldn't even take the time to walk to me
I got dissed
And that made me made
So I ran home just to tell my dad
I had a question, for my dear father
If girls treat you this bad, why bother?

He said you're learnin' somethin' everyone else knows
Just listen close son
'Cause that's the way love goes
(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)

Now I remember
When I got older
The ladies got hotter
And my luck got colder
Girls tellin' me I won't go for that
Just because Young MC was not phat
Now by Phat, I don't mean overweight
I mean makin' crazy dollars
'Til they come in a crate
Ya see, I had myself a job
I worked as hard as I could
But to the young ladies
It was just no goo&100

Wow, I guess you can't win for losin'
Havin' bad luck with the girls you're choosin'
I said to myself these dames are wack
But give me some time and I'm gonna get them back
But for now I manage my situation
I'm pickin' my women all across the nation
I'm havin' rough times with the girls I chose
But I'll have to deal, because yo
That's the way love goes
(Yuh hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
Break it down

(BRIDGE)
Alright, I went out last night
Thinking about a girl that would treat me right
I find myself chillin' at a discoteque
And the night went better than I could expect
One girl, down for the whole evenin'
For when I got there to when I was leaving
We went to her place and got in a cab
She said she was a model
I said, yo, alright
We opened up a window to watch a full moon
But the night was much colder than the afternoon
She started to shiver
So I gave her my sweater
I said you alright?
She said, yeah much better
I held her close, she felt good in my arms
And I knew this girl would do me no harm
Thinkin' how the two of us could be as one
Then I fell asleep before my boat was done
Now I woke up, I was still in her place
In the mornin' sunlight I could see her face
Yo, I tried to get up, so I could start my day
But I merely knocked over my breakfast tray
Now this girl went and made breakfast for me
When last night was the first time she saw me
You win some, you lose some, I suppose
Well I feel like a winner, yo
'Cause that's the way love goes

(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(My my my my, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes

See ya!
