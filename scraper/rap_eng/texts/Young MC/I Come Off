[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, ya, ya, you got it going on
Aah na-na, na-na

Now I wrote this record for when I perform
Lonely nights inside a university dorm
I put pen to paper with a paper and pen
For the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men
I get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddy
Krueger with a Luger turnin' men into spaghetti
I'm like Fats Domino, off of Blueberry Hill
Because my rhymes are funky fresh and not run of the mill
Just like a king has palaces I give an analysis
You can't talk because you suffer from paralysis
Of the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue
Comin' to you compliments of a brother named Young
Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless
So be quiet and let an educator teach this
It's due to my producer, so he's in a rage
And Mike you control the vinyl I'll control the stage
'Cause I come off

[Verse 2]
Four score and seven years ago
There were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know
Four score and seven years later
I dig holes in those rappers like the moon with a crater
Because to battle me you're really taking a risk
'Cause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc
Like Tyson drops boxers in rapid succession
That's how I'm droppin' MCs in the rappin' profession
I'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker
And I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snuka
Like a shuttle goes up into outer space
People's hands go up when I enter the place
I don't mean to brag or boast or to tell ya I'm great
But I can rock the microphone like Dorothy Hamill can skate
Yeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Louganis can dive
Don't have to be Saturday night for Young MC to get live
'Cause I come off

[Chorus]

Yo I come off, My name is Young MC and baby I come off
Yo the brother's comin' off, Bust this, Here we go

[Verse 3]
Now one behold, Young MC struck gold
From the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old
From the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb
From the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum
You know the other rappers wanna play a game with me
They run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC
Like a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be
So when I start I say Olly Olly Oxen Free
Yo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one
So pay attention cause you don't wanna miss one, of my healthy rhymes
Nobody's are healthier, New York, New Jersey, LA or Philadelphia
City to city, and town to town, place to place
Country to country, 'cause I get around
Even if you were in prison you'da heard me play
'Cause the warden had me rock and I'm on the PA
So when you get out come and see my show
And if you start static back in you go
'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam
And when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn
'Cause I come off

[Chorus]

I come off. Yo baby, I come off. Here we go...
