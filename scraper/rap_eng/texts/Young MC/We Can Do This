[ VERSE 1 ]
Aiyo, stop what you're doin, kid, here comes the tracks
From the heart to the head to the pen to the wax
And then to the store and the video channel
I'm not the Black Crows but I'm still 'hard to handle'
I don't wear sandals, I'd rather wear kicks
When I chill with the fellas and I watch the Knicks
See, I run things like Judge Wapner in the court
I'm like New York in the winter cause I take no shorts
Or no sports, but I know something too
Gimme the mic and 4 minutes and I show what I can do
Fu Man Chu was a famous oriental
And Katmandu made a funky instrumental
I don't get sentimental, even with a honey dip
My chorus line a rental cause I have a pink slip
And I won't flip as I make my way through this
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

[ Chorus 4X ]
(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this

[ VERSE 2 ]
I make papers like an IBM
Most of my friends clock the ends so I'm down with them
I don't need nobody tryin to sweat me or tryin to get me
Or tryin to soak me like a Tetley
Tea bag, to slap on a feedbag
Playin like Olive Oil but lookin more like the Sea Hag
So don't pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today
Here's the pun and then some, you can be on your way
See, I'm sick of all the beefin and the riffin
From the hype and the pipe and the cocaine sniffin
Walk around the way robotic
Thinkin you can get what you need to get from a narcotic
Girls ain't speakin, no, they're just freakin
Livin life fast like the last of the Mohicans
Think they know it all but they don't cause they clueless
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

[ Chorus 4X ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Yes, we can do this like Brutus, play it like a flutist
Or jump it like a nudist parachutist
I'm not new to this, but you already knew this
That's too many rhymes at one time, so yo, screw this
I be bonin like a skeleton, never wear Benetton
If I watch the base then I be watchin Terry Pendelton
Love to eat Jellitan to keep my body toner
And if [Name] wore some Nikes she woulda gone to Barcelona
So pick up the phone and call your friends
This is somethin that be bumpin from a Yugo to a Benz
I might make ends but I'm not in it for the money
You're not Lamont Sanford but you're still a 'big dummy'
I hang out with the honeys to pass the time
And I hang out with the homies to bust a rhyme
I draw the line at actin dumb and actin foolish
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)

(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)
And I'm out
