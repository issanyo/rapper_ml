Now this rhyme right here has been dedicated
To all rap fans that said that they hated
The other MC's whose rhymes deviated
Cause this is real gold, it's not gold plated
A few years ago these rhymes were created
I was real proud and very elated
It took a long time as I calculated
But now I look back, I'm glad I waited
At so many times I was so frustrated
Cause I couldn't finish up what I initiated
I got mad and quite agitated
And I remember rhymes that I had confiscated
But one day, this girl, she perpetrated
She was cute and quite educated
We got married at once, and it was consummated
But once it hit the books it was ill-fated
She took me to court, to have it litigated
A judge and a jury, that's how it operated
The jury went away, and they deliberated
Then she took all of my money, had my house renovated
I felt so poor, and so humiliated
Because of a fight that I instigated
But I got my money back, and I was jubilated
Cause the first court decision was never validated
For weeks and weeks, I just celebrated
Because the jury and judge recapitulated
And all of my funds were never liquidated
Yes I won, yes I dominated
I saw another girl and my heart pulsated
She just looked like that girl, I made it
Would've have been part two of this rhyme that I've stated
So I'll just go home and read my Sports Illustrated
