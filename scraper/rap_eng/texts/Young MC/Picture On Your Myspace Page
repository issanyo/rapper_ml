[Intro]
Good morning, Marvin
Morning, baby

[Verse 1]
Woke up in the morning, turned on the PC
Checked the inbox, who emailed me?
Hit the MySpace, got a friend request
From a lady that I met at a show out west
I clicked on her page, went to her site
And I knew right away something was not right
Cause the age on the page said "21"
But her favorite TV show was Sanford and Son?!
The picture looked close, but it wasn't exact
Made her look a lot younger, as a matter of fact
It was dark in the club when we started to chat
Yo, but I don't remember homegirl lookin' like that
She wanted to talk in the dark with the crowd
I was headed backstage where it wasn't so loud
But she didn't come into the light backstage
So is that really your picture on your MySpace page?

[Hook]
Is that really your picture on your MySpace page
Or is it of a girl that's like half your age?
I should've known when you didn't come backstage
That that wasn't your picture on your MySpace page
Is that really your picture on your MySpace page
Or is it of a girl that's like half your age?
I should've known when you didn't come backstage
That that wasn't your picture on your MySpace page

[Verse 2]
Next morning, turn on the PC again
Some other young lady wanna be my friend
Hope this one don't wanna play pretend
After yesterday, I didn't have the time to spend
So I looked at the page in a careful manner
A lady in her twenties with a hair bandana
She said that she worked as an event planner
But her favorite TV show was Hannah Montana?!
Her messages had a bunch of high school chat
Event planners I know don't talk like that
How the daddy look cute when she babysat
You a high school girl, where your mom and dad at?
Cause grown folks here just can't relate
To a little girl lyin', said she want to date
Better slow your road, girl, and act your age
And go change that picture on your MySpace page

[Hook]
Is that really your picture on your MySpace page
Or is it of a lady nearly twice your age?
Fifteen'll get me twenty inside a steel cage
So change that picture on your MySpace page
Is that really your picture on your MySpace page
Or is it of a lady nearly twice your age?
Fifteen'll get me twenty inside a steel cage
So change that picture on your MySpace page

[Verse 3]
There's a rapper I met after doing a show
Who said, "I got the style that could make big dough"
"I don't have a CD I could handle, bro"
"But check out the MySpace, you could hear my flow"
So I checked out the site, but the kid was wack
Kickin' boo boo lyrics over boo boo tracks
There were so many things yo the homeboy lacked
That it didn't make sense to even call him back
And the face in the picture wasn't who I met
Cause this guy had a face I could not forget
So I searched online, and what did I see?
He was wanted by the cops for a robbing spree
Did two gas stations and a liquor store
If we don't get him soon, then he might do more
He was last seen with a sawed-off 12 gauge

[Hook]
Is that really your picture on your MySpace page
Or are you better known rocking a 12 gauge
And running in the street on a crime rampage?
Man, that ain't your picture on your MySpace page
Is that really your picture on your MySpace page
Or are you better known rocking a 12 gauge
And running in the street on a crime rampage?
Man, that ain't your picture on your MySpace page
Is that really your picture on your MySpace page
Or is it of a lady nearly twice your age?
Fifteen'll get me twenty inside a steel cage
So change that picture on your MySpace page
Is that really your picture on your MySpace page
Or is it of a girl that's like half your age?
I should've known when you didn't come backstage
That that wasn't your picture on your MySpace page
