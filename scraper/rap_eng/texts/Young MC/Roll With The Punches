Roll with the punches is what I tell
To people when things dont go too well
When you go for the gold and come back empty
When the ups are few and the downs are plenty
When you talk with the girl that you always desired
You busted a move but the move backfired
When life puts you in the little crunches
Dont give up, you've got to roll with the punches
Roll it baby

Work, no matter what occupation
Any time's good time for vacation
Everyday's the same you can't believe the monotony
So when the weekend comes its like you had a lobotomy
You can't do a thing without the boss start yellin'
It wouldn't be bad if his breath wasn't smellin'
A good day's work for a good day's pay
But that's before Uncle Sam takes a portion away
Now a lot of times you feel just like quittin'
But without a job you're home alone sittin'
Checkin' the want ads for jobs to fill
Watchin soaps, Geraldo and Oprah, and Phil
My advice is to roll with with it honey
And soon you'll find that you'll be in the money
Expense accounts and three martini lunches
And thats what you get when you roll with the Punches
Roll it baby

You got to roll with the punches
Roll with it
Roll it baby

Lotto, take your chance for a dollar
If I win then I'll scream and holler
High on the hog is the way to be
And it's def livin in the lap of luxury
I picked 4 numbers they were all okay
For the 5th and 6th I used my birthday
But I erased my birthday and said better yet
I'll use the birthday of a girlie that I just met
I filled out the ticket gave it a kiss for luck
Handed it to the agent with a brand new buck
Went home to watch TV on a Saturday night
4 numbers came up and they were all alrright
Now what happened next, nearly made me drop dead
It wasn't her birthday it was mine instead
I said next time I'll just play my hunches
But what the heck, I'll just roll with the punches
Roll with it

You got to go with the flow
Like this

Women, let me tell you about 'em
Can't live with them, can't live without em
The ones you like only seem to hate you
The ones you hate only seem to date you
Girls will often tell you, you come on too strong
You got to take it slow to make the love last long
But I say, the early bird catches the worm
The late bird gets the gilrie with the two dollar perm
Man, that put me in dilema
Case in point a fly girl name Gema
I met this lady at a quiet place
About 5 years ago we were face to face
I stepped up to her, tossed the first line
Like fishin' I was wishin' that the girl would be mine
I told my best jokes and she started smilin'
A voice inside said yo Young you're stylin'
But then Gema really startin actin' silly
Cuz she broke up with her boyfriend Billy
She wanted advice and she was coming to me
I said you need Dear Abby not the Young MC
Because I don't mind being a shoulder to cry on
But I need one who needs a body to lie on
'Cause nowadays I got girls by the bunches
See I got smart and just rolled with the punches
Roll it baby

You got to go with the flow
Roll it baby
Nowadays I got girls by the bunches
I got smart and just rolled with the punches
