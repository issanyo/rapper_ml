[Intro]
Alright
I'm back at it
I'm back at it

[Verse 1]
I got a little bit of time and a lot to say
So I'll kick it in a rhyme yo without delay
You can see a brother shine on the ground today
And you'll never get the time for your mind to stray
There's a lot of brothers rapping and they saying they hot
But you listen to the lyrics, they ain't saying a lot
Cause I'm really not impressed by what you saying you got
And you really can't believe that I make you stay in your spot
See, you try to make a point, but its up in the air
Like you walking in the closet and got nothing to wear
And you jealous with your girl cause she stopping to stare
And she saying, "Hey baby, that's Bubby right there"
Don't blame it on your girl, you can blame it on me
Cause I got the nerve to question what you claiming to be
I just came in to see, I ain't looking for no static
But yo homes, let it be known: I'm back at it

[Hook]
I'm back at it, yes, I'm back at it
Make it add up just like in mathematics
Do it for the fans that say that they've had it
Those that got static, yo, I'm back at it
I'm back at it, yes, I'm back at it
Try to be mellow and not melodramatic
Rappers done got too wild and eratic
Those that got static, yo, I'm back at it

[Verse 2]
I don't pop no gat, I don't hit no chick
Only flip mad lyrics, never flip no brick
I be coming with the styles you could pick up quick
And when I'm done with ya, guaranteed it gon' stick
I ain't hating on nobody out there making they cheese
I just wanna get the chance to try to make it with these
I don't need to ride dirty and be faking my steez
To get the guys head bopping, girlies shaking they knees
See, I started busting rhymes back in '78
Many thought that hip hop could never be great
They thought the mainstream just could never relate
Till we ran through every small town, city, and state
Many rappers use mics just to make 'em a star
But they didn't understand that you could take it too far
Now I'm raising the bar, so get acrobatic
And yo homes, let it be known: I'm back at it

[Hook]
I'm back at it, yes, I'm back at it
Make it add up just like in mathematics
Do it for the fans that say that they've had it
Those that got static, yo, I'm back at it
I'm back at it, yes, I'm back at it
Try to be mellow and not melodramatic
Rappers done got too wild and eratic
Those that got static, yo, I'm back at it

[Verse 3]
Young man back in the place and all in this
Party people get on the floor, let's begin this
DJs doing your thing, go 'head and spin this
Play it loud, look at the crowd, that's the business
I ain't in the mood to hear a rapper complain
I just wanna put this rapper to the back of your brain
I ain't rapping for no rims, I ain't rapping for change
No, I'd rather turn this rap into a capital gain
I'mma go for money, I'mma go for time
Make you go bananas when I go for mine
I'mma keep it going so you know that I'm
Just like Nolan Meyer when I throw my rhyme
I went skill and pedigree intertwined
You're not into rap, but you're into mine
I begin to shine cause I'm charismatic
So yo homes, let it be known: I'm back it at

[Hook]
I'm back at it, yes, I'm back at it
Make it add up just like in mathematics
Do it for the fans that say that they've had it
Those that got static, yo, I'm back at it
I'm back at it, yes, I'm back at it
Try to be mellow and not melodramatic
Rappers done got too wild and eratic
Those that got static, yo, I'm back at it
I'm back at it, yes, I'm back at it
Make it add up just like in mathematics
Do it for the fans that say that they've had it
Those that got static, yo, I'm back at it
I'm back at it, yes, I'm back at it
Try to be mellow and not melodramatic
Rappers done got too wild and eratic
Those that got static, yo, I'm back at it
