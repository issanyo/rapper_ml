Listen to the beat of the music (x20)

Ahh looking out my window at the world I see
A whole bunch of problems looking back of me
And I'm not one to get involved
Therefore problems will never get solved
We've got acid rain Saddam Hussein
National deficit and crack cocaine
Homeless people being driven insane
By a world that gives them not a thing to gain
I start my car and get in the fast lane
Driving by all the strife and strain
I feel the sunshine but I don't feel rain
'Cause I'm looking at life from behind a windowpane
I shut my mouth and I do not complain
'Cause if I did then it would go in vain
I live my life in the way that I choose it
I just aah listen to the beat of the music

So this is the way life's supposed to go
I work my job and I collect my dough
And as long as I still get paid
I can do what I want and never be afraid
Because I waited and i stood in line
Took my chances 'til it was my time
Worked real hard to learn how to rhyme
So now I'm not giving you one thin dime
People approach me just because I'm
A successful rapper who is in his prime
I worked hard so now I think it's fine
That you have your life and I have mine
I started writing at the age of 9
I broke no laws and I commit no crime
I got what I got and I don't want to lose it
So I ahh listen to the beat of the music

Well a change is needed and I can tell
That if I change that then everything will be swell
'Cause I can't get upstairs
If I keep on acting like I do not care
Now this is something you people should not miss
And open ear is what I insist
And your response should not be cold and brisk
To a man if your life is better than his
By making this song I guess I'm taking a risk
Of being insulted chastised and dissed
Or called a commie or a socialist
'Cause I feel success is not selfishness
See my philosophy goes like this
An open hand should not be greeted with a fist
A dirty look or a slap on the wrist
And angry word or a boo or a hiss
Now you've done things in life that they've missed
But those achievements belong on a list
Be unselfish if you get the gist
'Cause there's no reason to be so pissed
Turn around baby make that twist
Follow me every bro' and sis'
I got my Walkman and I'm gonna use it
Helping people while I listen to the beat of the music
