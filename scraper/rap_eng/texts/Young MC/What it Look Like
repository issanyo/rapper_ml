Yeah, yeah
What it look like (what it look like)

Now check it out
What you see homey ain't always what you get
You gotta take your time and never let 'em see you sweat
'Cause if you lose your mind and you start rhyming just to kick it
Somebody's gaurunteed to pull your ticket
Now you know you can't drive in LA with no insurance
Especially if you holdin' mad warrants, doin' 90 down Florence
But you tell 'em yo your rims is tight
But its hard for them to see 'em when you rollin' side streets at night
No doubt you're a winner, but yo you gettin' thinner
That may be because you be havin' top ramen for dinner
Your crib is arraigned, ?? tellus ?? is messin with your man
Till you ?? doxt my munch ?? 'cause you got problems with your dental
To anybody lookin' how you livin' legit
But ain't nobody really care enough to tell you to quit
'Cause you're a step away from homeless, up ridin' a bike
And though you think you livin' G, but what it look like?

CHORUS

You say your crib is long but what it look like?
You say your cash is long but what it look like?
You in the danger zone so what it look like?
What it look like baby what it look like?
You got a fancy car but what it look like?
It's gonna take you far but what it look like?
Think you a superstar but what it look like?
What it look like? (Baby when I'm on the mic)

You can't live wit 'em, can't live without 'em
And you're too dumb to know what to do about 'em
And she plays you, never givin' proper respect
You treat her like one time when she just wears ? tech ?
Then you ask her not to cheat she tells you baby I won't
But everytime you leave town she on her back gettin' boned
And you don't understand why she do you like that
But if you live like a rat, you give like a rat
You shoulda thought harder when she started to flow
You shoulda thought about more than just the back of her stroke
'Cause you was singin' you's a man and you never get hurt
But then you never counted on baby doin' the dirt
Now you were happy 'cause your boys think you livin' the life
Thinkin the two of you in love and you were given a wife
But you know someday soon she be takin' a hike
She might be lyin' in your bed but what it look like?

CHORUS

You got a girl with you but what it look like?
She knowin' what to do but what it look like?
You sayin' she'll be true but what it look like?
What it look like baby what it look like?
She's chillin' on your arm but what it look like?
She like a good luck charm but what it look like?
Is she a flossy momma what it look like
What it look like? (Baby when I'm on the mic)

Now everybody wanna be a rapper (yeah)
Everybody wit' a mic wanna be a rapper (yeah)
So dapper that they run they mouth hollerin' about respect
But then they never scrutinize on the size of the check
You see life don't change when you sign that deal
You need a true definition of keepin' it real
You be in the studio makin' a gang of noise
But it's nothin' if you sellin' just to you and your boys
They say God bless the child that's got his own
But say a prayer for the baby on the microphone
They got you walkin' round hard but they treatin' ya soft
You makin' 80 cents a record and they rippin' ya off
They make five or six dollars and they keepin' it tight
Blow you up in the mornin' and you gone at night
Videos are bein' made to put hoes in
And The Source is only good to sell clothes in
Now you can call me bitter baby that's for sure
'Cause I made mine and now I'm comin' back for more
And it's lesson number one when you rockin' the mic
It sounds good to you yo but what it look like?

CHORUS

You got a microphone but what it look like?
You say your rhymes is on but what it look like?
It's to the break of dawn but what it look like?
What it look like baby what it look like?
You got your record deal but what it look like?
You gonna keep it real but what it look like?
You think you hard as steel but what it look like?
What it look like? (Baby when I'm on the mic)

What it look like? (x3)
Baby what it look like?
What it look like? (x3)
What it look like (Baby when I'm on the mic)

Yeah
And it don't stop
And it won't stop...
