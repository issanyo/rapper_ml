[Verse 1]
Well my name is Young MC and I'm cold rockin' the house
I came up into the place and I'm a-turnin' it out
Cause I'm a mover, a shaker, for real and not a faker
Put your girl up into my face and if you diss me I will take her
Cause I'm one of a kind, I'm going to rock the Earth
And I'm worth my weight in gold, gold in weight my worth
Not Doug E., Run, Whodini, Cool J, or Shan
My name is Marvin, Young MC, and I'm a hell of a man
I got my name well known all over the place
To all seven continents and even outer space
Cause when they're flyin' in a plane or goin' out for a walk
Yeah frontin' people listen when they hear me talk
They told me time will tell, and it has told
Cause I've been rockin' a microphone since I was ten years old
I'm a jack of all trades, and a master of three:
Rockin' the tables, rockin' the mics, and rockin' the young ladies
So then yes indeed, give you what you need
Without crack, marijuana, cocaine, or speed
I don't drink or smoke, and that ain't no joke
I just pick up the microphone and start to go for broke
So if you think that you can deal
Get on the mic, get on the wheels of steel
And then do your thing, or make the telephone ring
Cause if you dance then dance, and if you sing then sing
Because once I start there ain't no stoppin
Heard of hiphop, Young MC is hiphoppin
Mix, scratch, and blend every now and then
And I love to rock the mic when I'm around my friends
I like to go for broke cause I'm that kind of man
Yo I'm a die-hard rapper, you're my die-hard fan
So in closing, I'd like to thank everyone
But don't touch that dial, because my rhyme ain't done
My name is Young

[Hook]
(Who is it?)
(What did you say your name was?)
My name is Young
(Who is it?)
(What did you say your name was?)

[Verse 2]
Now they call me Young MC cause I was young when I started
People tried to break, yo that's cold-hearted
Rock the mic on every chance I get
That's why I'm making more money than the national debt
See I came into the place to make my name known
As the Commander In Chief of the microphone
They thought I was wack at first, but once I started to rhyme
They said I'm called Young MC, let's hear that one more time
I take the bull by the horn when opportunity knocks
And I'm notoriously known as the kid that rocks
So listen to me, don't say boo me, you don't like me you can sue me
But once I'm finished rapping you'll be happy that you knew me
You hear just what I'm saying, see where I am at
Cause I'm the freshest rapper out, it is as simple as that
Yo I'm the freshest rapper out, there's not much more I can say
I put the cap in Cap'n Crunch, the oil in Oil of Olay
I put the good in Good N Plenty, bad in Bad News Bears
I put the jack in Jackson 5, the son in Sonny and Cher
I put the mutt in Mother Goose, the doc in Doctor Seuss
So when I'm mic'in' upon the mic you know you gotta get loose
My name is Young

[Hook]
(Who is it?)
(What did you say your name was?)
My name is Young
(Who is it?)
(What did you say your name was?)

[Verse 3]
You see I rhyme real fast 'cause I am on the go
Federal Express called up my agent but I said no
Money-makin' Manhattan is the place where I went into school
Goin' into class every day, followin' the golden rule
I'm takin' it out of the class, I'm steppin' it on the train
And some of the people that you see, they really can make someone go insane
I'm takin' the bus out to Hollis and in Queensville
I'm hangin' it down with the fellas, hope I don't get ill
Because I'm rockin' upon the mic, and really doin' the best I can
Stayin' with all the ladies, with a microphone in my hand
Makin' up all the money, and just takin' up all the time
Because the Young MC is my name and yo I'm ready to bust a rhyme
So when I'm checkin' the party people there's a story to tell
It isn't about Humpty Dumpty or the farmer and the dell
It isn't about Pinnochio or Alice in Wonderland
It's all about the funky rapper who's the greatest man
My name is Young

[Hook]
(Who is it?)
(What did you say your name was?)
My name is Young
(Who is it?)
(What did you say your name was?)
