[Intro]
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Make you move

[Verse 1]
Now its a hot time in the old town tonight
With a hot rod mama throw down tonight
Cause I got time for the whole crowd's delight
And when you spot my neighbors, no doubt its tight
Cause when you sit still and you need some rest
I bet the fact is that you need it less
You need to rise up and you need to dress
You need to do something or you'll feel depressed
So the sun goes down and the night come on
Walk in the nightclub and a light come on
You feel the work week's just a night too long
Well, give me just a minute, I'mma write that wrong
Cause this right here with excite the throng
Have the girlies saying, "Baby, I like this song"
I'm fighting strong when I bring this groove
And I'm gonna make you what?

[Hook]
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move

[Verse 2]
Now I came here just to rock for you all
To make you dance and make you rock till you fall
The place is hot, how could you not have a ball?
And did you notice there's no clocks on the wall?
The time is now, there's no time to stall
You wanted to party, I do recall
You better get up and get off that wall
Go ahead and dance with that baby doll
There you go, now you're feeling free
You're being the best now that you can be
You're shaking all insecurity
You can go for south, man you don't need me
There ain't no doubt, now we rockin', G
It's going throughout the whole property
Its got to be the whole place approved
So now I'm gonna make you what?

[Hook]
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move

[Verse 3]
Now, I've been making people move for quite a long time
Even when I didn't need to write a long rhyme
People moving to the beat, looks like they don't mind
If you give the people heat, you most likely gon' shine
I'll tell you something, baby, no doubt I'm gon' grind
Forget about the rest, I'm the best you gon' find
A nice guy don't need to treat you all kind
I'd rather just chill so that we can unwind
Fine, we're moving to the beat out here
Loud enough to hear it in the street out here
The girlies in the place are looking sweet out here
And the brother on the mic is bringing heat out here
It's time for y'all to take the lead out here
I did my job, gave you what you need out here
Indeed, out here, we can all improve
And I'm gonna make you what?

[Hook]
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move
