Song:   Back in the Day

Verse 1:

Back in the day
Growing up in Hollis Queens New York
I used to play in the day til the day got dark
And everyone around me knew everybody else
No matter what you do, you're never by yourself
School and homework were neccessary evils
Before you went out and daredeviled like Kenivel
Football and softball and b-ball we played
Cause that's that we went about it back in the day

Verse 2:

Now back in the day
Block partys going on in the summer
The echo in the street was the beat of the drummer
Guys and girls dancing, and kids ran around
When I got a little older, grab the mic and throw down
I always rocked the party, I never was afraid
Cause if you made a record you was gonna get paid
Baby D was in there, and so was Super Rhymes
And every signle DJ had a pair of good times
Now ?? hooked me, and put me in the crew
But 15 brothers made it something like a zoo
When I got through, like the other crews around
With Jam, Pete, Hollis Crew and Solo Sound
But meanwhile, all the kids were getting into fashion
Spend a couple dollars, hit the ave with a passion
Trying to be in with the rest of New Yorkers
Mock necks, knees, and a pair of british walkers
The ?? to the turn to the ave for the shopping
And once you got started, yo, there was no stopping
And when it got cold there were coats to get inta
Sheep dogs and goosedowns that keep you warm in the winter
Collecting dust in my house today is some of the gear that I used to wear
Around the way
You gotta dress to impress is what I always say
Cause that's the way you went about it back in the day

Verse 3:

Back in the day I watched wrestling with Superfly Snuka
A quart of ?? and a strawberry bazooka
5 for a haircut, and they can make it thourough
And 50 cents can get you anywhere in the borough
Karate movies came on Saturdays at 3
The films were kind of cheap but they were dope to me
Movie scores for 3 bucks, and 5 in the city
So 20 was plenty, with someone who was pretty
You had to have heart, though
And suckers were forbidden
Yes we were kids then, but no we wasn't kidding
I often reminisce about the real good times
Yo, I know it's not Georgia, but it's still on my mind
Back when we used to have the partys in the park
And crack wasn't nothing but a broken sidewalk
You helped a brother out so he could make his way
Cause that's how you went about it back in the day
