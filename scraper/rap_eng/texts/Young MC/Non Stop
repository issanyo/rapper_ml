Well if you listen, you're learnin'
The money I'm earnin'
Out from Hollis, Queens, and not from Mt. Vernon
People all over the place, I'm tellin' you now
It's guaranteed for treble and bass, and showin' you how
To kick out rhymes like a blizzard kicks snow
Cause my name is Young MC, the boy that's good to go
Cause I'm rough like Hunter, clever like MacGyver
Rock the mic all 24/7, don't spit saliva
Cold like ice and hot like fire
Givin' you a shock like a plug and a wire
Cause people go crazy when the mic's in my hand
Cause I'm like a Robocop and you're a regular man
My rhymes are mine and not stolen, the mic that I'm holdin'
You told me some rhymes that was weak, so I was rollin'
Around on the ground cause it was so damn funny
Don't call me honey, no you never make no money
My rhymes are written, fresh and never bitten
I'm standing, you are sittin'
You hear me and then you're quittin'
You're out of the game, nobody knows your name
And your claim to fame is that you show no shame
New York to California, yes coast to coast
And I'm dustin' MCs like Ghostbusters dust ghosts
I wrote a little record for the hip and the hop
My name is Young, the record's called "Non Stop"
Non stop for the rhythm, non stop for the rhyme
Non stop for the people who are right on time
Non stop for the treble, non stop for the bass
Non stop for the brother who is on the case
I came here to prove a point and to try my best
To get the people on the floor in three minutes or less
There'll be no time for cuttin', no time for mix
To do in three what other rappers can't do in six
Cause I was chillin' at a party, the record was playin'
"this is brand new", that's what the DJ was sayin'
But no matter what the people stand on the wall
They'd have more fun goin' shoppin' at a shoppin' mall
So then the DJ called me over to help out that night
He said "Yo yo that's Young MC", I said "Yo yo that's right"
So then I grabbed the microphone, the party started to hop
Cause when I start you know I go non stop
I'm ready willing and able, the mic and turntable
If I'm not on tour, I'm at home watchin' cable
I made "My Name is Young" and I made "Let Them Know"
So on your mark, get set... here we go
I make the crowd go insane, don't use cocaine
I like to travel a lot because I travel by airplane
Sittin' by the window, sleepin' with a bimbo
Take you off your balance like your life was in limbo
Too hot to handle, hotter than a candle
Sloppy like Oscar, but neat like Tony Randall
My rap is inconceivable, it's unbelievable
To me it's easy but to you it's unachievable
This is the lowdown, forget about the throw down
Live from New York, it's a hip-hop hoedown
My lip service makes you nervous
Yo don't play dumb, cause you know that you deserve this
Renegade rebel, rockin' bass, rockin' treble
Takin' rap to a higher echelon and level
Elevatin' hip-hop, let me make a pit stop
Yo, go tell your friends about the jam they call the non stop
