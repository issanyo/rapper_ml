[Intro]

[Verse 1: MC Trouble]
Trouble on a different tip
...
For my kind
Coming from one
To crush the stereotype
That if you're brown you're down
The constitution wasn't written for me
So check your history we're still in slavery
Democracy has got hypocrisy
It's not a controversial plea
We speaking of the agonies
Of my race and voicing with my faculties
Refusing to be a victim of the Klan
A white man's worst fear is an educated black man
So I'm undertaking responsibility
To educate minds
So we can
Self-education
In order to be fit to fight for power

[Hook]
We gotta get a grip
Gotta get a grip
We gotta get a grip
Gotta get a grip



[Intermission]
"Look I have no problem with the song, but the video is too much, it's too strong, it's too much."
"Too much for who?"
"Too much for you, too much for me, too much for your fans Trouble"
"Look man you manage, you do your thing, and let me do mine and we'll leave it like that"

[Verse 2]
Coming to trip with a [?]
They say I've seen too much
I'm overstepping the boundaries over points I wanna touch
Not gonna sugar coat it
[?]
But yo I keep driving, I know that it's possible
But justice from where I'm from ain't topical
The world's in debt[?], so Trouble is set
To wake up my brothers and sisters, who have slept
On the fact
Of how America's red even though it was built from the sweat of a black man
Brothers sisters fathers mothers again and brothers
Ha ha
We gotta move or get moved on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Live your life comatose with no hope dreams or broke
But with every roast of the pipe another brother smoked
And I'm angered to see the pace of destruction
We're killing off our own race
Any comprehend this?
We've gotta end this
Take your place in the world
We began this
Civilization rise before we all said
Stop and trip the concept[?]


[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fighting for consciousness
Son with the heart of this
Mind our mind cuz I speak of what's wrong with this
World and nation we live in
I'm at a handicap color, the color of my skin
I vow with all that's sacred
I'm much too strong to take it
What do you do when you're born of the black race
The economy's ran to try to keep you at a slower pace
[?]
Know your history we came from lines of kings and queens
They came [?]
On the news another dark man slain
Rose from the ghetto got caught in a gang
He was a rapist is what they spread as reality
But we know police brutality
In the station it's not out of the norm
You can kill a black man if you wear a blue uniform
Now it's [?]
They send a man to the moon
They can't stop the Crips and Bloods?
Cuz they love it, brothers killing brothers
While they laughing, Oh let them kill one another
It's the truth, they help killing our youth
We don't fight the power no (?)
Now brothers and sisters let my word be bond
Check this out, we gotta move or get moved on

[Hook]
