[Intro: The Good Girls]
I want, wanna make you mine
I want, wanna make you mine
I want, wanna make you mine
I want, wanna make you mine

[Hook: The Good Girls]
I wanna make you mine
Tell me if you have some time for me
And if you want me
Good girls, we're gonna be
I wanna make you mine
Tell me if you have some time for me
And if you want me
Just give me your love

[Verse 1: MC Trouble]
I've been looking for a guy like you for a long time
Realizing that guys like you come once in a lifetime
I had to step back, check you out
See what your madness is really about
You got the juice that keep me hype
Meaning you got the clout
And that's just my time
I want you to love me
You never bug me
So come rush me, you know, love me
You're oh too smooth and that's just how I like it
Never feenin' for the body and get too excited
Just how I like my men with class
Not a over-hyped clown only out for the-
Ask me how I'm living, I might say "for you"
I wanna make you mine, come on, rush it
I wanna make you mine, [?] bust it
I wanna make you mine, 'cause I do adore you

[Chorus:]
I just want to make you mine
I just want to make you mine
Ooh, I just want to make you mine
I just want to make you mine, baby

[Verse 2: MC Trouble]
I can see you and I sipping a martini
Me and my...
You in your bikini
With all this assets, life could be swell
I can tell you know it well
You're hotter than hell
I'm gifted, yeah, enough to keep you jumping
See, I know that you like it rough and
Baby, know that I ain't bluffin'
Trouble ain't blushin'?!
Check this, I can thrill you with a kiss
Be all that you wish for, someone you'd kill for
I won't even front
I'll be your world
Trouble's the name, and I ain't a Good Girl
The attitude would never be funky
I'm hunky and spunky
Now show me you want me
You like my moves and you think I'm hot?
Then come with it and give me all you got

[Chorus:]
I just want to make you mine
I just want to make you mine
Ooh, I just want to make you mine
I just want to make you mine, baby

[Chorus:]
I just want to make you mine
I just want to make you mine
Ooh, I just want to make you mine
I just want to--

Jay! Heh. Let's take it to the bridge!

I want...
Trouble! P-Pump it up!
I-I-I want...
Trouble! P-P-P-P-Pump it up!
I-I-I want...
Trouble! P-P-P-Pump it up!
I-I-I-I-I want...
Trouble! P-P-P-P-Pump it up!

[Verse 3: MC Trouble]
Give me the time to cold break it down in a rhyme
'Cause I think you should be my guy
Not only 'cause I think you're fly
The Trouble don't lie
Why lie? For that I'm simply too fly
It takes no time to throw a line
I ain't with it, that ain't my kind
Straight up, I wanna make you mine

[Hook:]
I wanna make you mine
Tell me if you have some time for me
And if you want me
Good girls, we're gonna be
I wanna make you mine
Tell me if you have some time for me
And if you want me
Just give me your love

Good Girls, let's kick this!

[Chorus:]
I just want to (just) make you mine (just)
I just want to (just) make you mine (just)
(Give me your love)
Ooh, I just want to (just) make you mine (just)
I just want to (just) make you mine, baby (just)
(Give me your love)

[Chorus:]
I just want to (just) make you mine (just)
I just want to (just) make you mine (just)
(Give me your love)
Ooh, I just want to (just) make you mine (just)
Yeah, I just want to (just) make you mine, baby (just)
(Give me your love)
