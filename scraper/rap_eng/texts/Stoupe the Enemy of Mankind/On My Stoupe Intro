Assassin

Born to spit it, every thought is vivid
I'm getting raw with it and and showing court the exhibit
Write a song by the minute give an encore before im finished
Beyond all limits there's no heading back
When I get on tracks, golden legend, weapon selection an axe
The messenger sent by settler blend
Forever with never again just to get to the end
While I live for the now and they grip for my style
I'm switchin the dial to kill some shit that's foul
Spitting vile outrageous
The greatest freestyle that ever tear up pages
No writtens, hold my cyphers in steel cages
Assassin of the ages, ninja star type of cypher breaker
Fire blazer live by nature
Off the top skyscraper live bait ya
Spit that boom bappery rapidly
Backsmack wack rap cats with a backpack for trying to rap with me
I'm unequivocal naturally self evident truth
Require no proof, low on my roof
But high on my Stoupe
Since nobody fucking with the energy
I've come down underground to become the best emcee
I've brought some friends with me, they're just as deadly
Only real stand next to me son and you ain't ready
