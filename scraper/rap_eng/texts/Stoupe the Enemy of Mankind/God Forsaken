[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, Jedi Mind
Listen

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
The big four fifth gonna split 'em in the middle
In a little I'mma riddle, I be feeling kind of brittle
I was dealing with the ghetto I was feeling for the ghetto
I was feeling for the metal and my feet was on the pedal
I was feeling like Geppetto I was showing them the plans
And the pain fall worse if you know it in advance
It was going to the hands and it's over with a dance
And you're walking over sands in the holiest of lands
And the holiest of man told me put it in a rhymebook
You would never understand the beauty of the rhyme, look
Blood is on the rhymebook, blood is on the walls
And the blood is dripping everywhere similar to jaws
Similar to wars and the chopper is gonna spit
For every single rhyme there's a [?] getting hit
I was silent for a bit but I'm back for the crown
With the black and the brown and a mac and a pound
Yeah

[Chorus]
They put a lean on you and the beam on you
They put a price on you, roll the dice on you

They put a lean on you and the beam on you
They put a price on you, roll the dice on you

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Hit 'em with a long pipe jig 'em with a long knife
Hit 'em in the middle and I grill 'em with a bombstrike
Show them what the god like show them how to die
Show them that it ain't nobody holier than I
If they holier than I then they holier than Jah
Holier than anybody roaming in the sky
It's colder in July the blacksmith anvil popping off low key that'll get your man killed
Turn 'em in the landfill turn 'em into particles
Avoid [?] pro, make him [?]
I had to kill 'em honorable and I had to kill 'em fast
And I had to build a legacy I had to build a path
I be building with the gods so I gotta deal with math
And I'm all about fetty so I gotta deal with cash
And the shotty pointed at him so he had to do the dash
And he had to break north and he had to do it fast

[Chorus]
They put a lean on you and the beam on you
They put a price on you, roll the dice on you

They put a lean on you and the beam on you
They put a price on you, roll the dice on you
