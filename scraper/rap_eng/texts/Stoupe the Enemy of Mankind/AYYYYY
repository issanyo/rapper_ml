What up now, I stay on some bugged out
Gun blaow on track but I doubt that you done that
Just 'cause you rat-tat-tat don't mean you ever killed shit
I'm Skywalker, you ?? talk and I don't feel it
And one time, I represent rawness
Of course you gon' forfeit
Y'all walking cautious forced to quit from the vibe that I'm on
High and I'm gone, my mind is pure
From the booth here til I fall
Get my rhyme on so try on best up in this cell
Bless it with the el, plus I'm connected to the hell I put myself through
I'll tell you what I've felt
Fire burning my flesh, it was intense
But I still kneel on my (stoop/Stoupe) to the heavens
Screaming with a passion
There is no god, if there was this wouldn't happen
Took a deep breath, cross the street for a dutch
Had to want to understand it but Butta dreaming too much
Woke up with a blunt that was already rolled
And the sign on the table that was telling me go
I didn't know which way but I went anyway
And I never came back after I left that day
