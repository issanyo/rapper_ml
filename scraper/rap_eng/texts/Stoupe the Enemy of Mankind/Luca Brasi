[Intro]
Now tell me, who did it and how did it happen
Luca....Luca Brasi...he said his name was Luca Brasi....he put a gun to my head and said that either my brains or my signature would be on the contract

[Verse]
Start it off, I put a bullet on your torso
My shit knocks like morse code
Blood on my collar, change wardrobe
Every dog has his month, check the horoscope
Mentally twisted, wicked mixed with a little vicious
Malicious, me ever losing is fictitious
On this concept, I’m complex, no comment
For my content to go to convent is uncommon
Did it without a grant like Ulysses
Luca Brasi, got you swimming with the fishies
I got blood on my heel, no achilles
Any other way to the top would be silly
Did it with no tobacco, fiasco
Hot like tabasco, I’m the true Donnie Brasco
Dysfunctional, I’m like the Untouchables
Unbustable, busting bills open, Huxtable
Audacity, ain’t nobody passing my capacity
Packing the pistol, dropping bodies off the balcony
Insomnia, sleeping with a milli under my pillow
The mafia, trying to get my pistol, my black widow
Yeah, it started when I lived my dreams, inception
Now it’s like you haters can’t be in my perception
Being the best is something you can’t boast
That’s my life, I keep a grenade in the lamppost
I’m the real life Don Vito, no Don Cheadle
Don’t bug me like a mosquito
Or you’ll be bleeding like cherry popsicle red
Your final destination is a hospital bed
Pushing me further like wind power
They too scared to even let me in the twin towers
Yeah, whatever, got saboteur
Amateur gangsters with fake calibers
Killer back and forth like a palindrome
Antidote, bust his head like a cantaloupe
I see these wack gangsters with prostitutes like you can’t elope
You wannabes couldn’t see me with a telescope
A true animal, no cannibal but I’m actual
Blasting casual, acting way too rational
Remain calm, don’t even move a keychain
Holster loaded with six bullets of pain, this is Kane
