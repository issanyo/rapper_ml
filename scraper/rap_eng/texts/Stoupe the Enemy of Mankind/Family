[Intro]
You Spend time with your family?
Sure I do
Good
A man who can't spend time with his family can never be a real man

[Hook]
Honor, Loyalty, Respect; it's the shit I expect from you
If you a friend of the family then the family's blessin’ you
Mo’fucka respect the ring, you know it’s the best to do
You know to respect the crew

[Verse 1]
A wise man once said to me
"Keep your friends close and forget about your enemies"
But when the snakes come out with the weaponry
It's one hundred percent that they weren't real friends to me
There's no reason to worry though cause they aren't as hard as they pretend to be
I check my friends like I check my cheese
If someone takes it from me I will strike back, it's my destiny
It's the definition of loyalty, definition of equity
Keep both business and pleasure separated, that be the recipe
Worried bout getting shot down like a Kennedy
But I got my fam beside me, protect me at my embassy
Some I’ve been running with as kids, I’d die for em’ breathlessly
Some joined cause of pregnancy, wife naggin’ them endlessly
And the money that we makin be helping them endlessly
I’m their Don Corleone, foes of mine fear my legacy
If they fuck with the family then they momma read their elegy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Family are the motherfuckers who won't go behind your back
They are the first defenders of your legacy when someone goes on attack
A real family is the one who'll tell you if your flows are wack
They carry Uzi's for you on the shoulder strap
Family love is authentic, presented by the entrance
The true affection's selected, may be relentless
For real, if they're looking out for your ass day-to-day
Then for real, they should stay inside your database
It's unfortunate but family tends to fade away
But love is something that the galaxy can't take away
It could be your relatives or your label mates
Either way, it's the ones who recognize your fatal ways
They could be generous or genital-less degenerates
Blood isn't of relevance as long as both sides get the benefits
Don't mean to be sensitive but my family is never negative
My crew is closer to me then some of my relatives
Family ain't who your born with, it's who you die for
Just me and my family, you know that's who I lie for

[Hook]
