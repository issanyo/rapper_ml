1st Verse
The shame I'm holding onto
The high that I desire
This long and winding road
Left me alone, all alone

This feeling that I want to die
This habits gotta hold
The soul and spirit know
The heavenly, the heavenly

Pre chorus
My mind has lead me wrong
Give me something real (give me something real)
Some hope is what I long
I just wanna feel (I just wanna feel)
You you you you you

Chorus
You and only you and you and only you(x3)
You and only you

2nd Verse
The guilt that pounds my chest
The suffocation's like I never get a chance to breathe
The tears just ran away
I get no relief, there's never peace

Pre chorus
My mind has lead me wrong
Give me something real (give me something real)
Some hope is what I long
I just wanna feel (I just wanna feel)
You you you you you

Chorus
You and only you and you and only you(x3)
You and only you

Vamp 1
When I'm all alone and I get nothing left inside, yeah (you and only only you)
All I want is you you you (you and only only you)
I got nothing left no nothing left but (you and only only you)
Oh my Lord, I got all my love for (you and only only you)

Chorus
You and only you and you and only you(x3)
You and only you

Vamp 2
I got, I got, I got nothing but (you and only only you)
Ain't nobody make me feel the way you do (you and only only you)
Said I woke up this morning with you on my mind (you and only only you)
You and only you is all I need to make it through (you and only only you)
You you you you
