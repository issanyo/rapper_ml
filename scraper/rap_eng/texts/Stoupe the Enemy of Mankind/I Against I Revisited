[Verse 1: Planetary]
In my historical oracle, I blast metaphorical
Editorials educating in my territorial
Get torn, heavily armed with seventy bombs
That'll blast divine like the heavenly song
Your men'll be gone
If they explore my deepest thought
I beat hearts in two then ask demons for chalk
I'm dreaming to stalk emcees in the dark I walk
Blindfolded the mind's golden, watch how you talk
My style is a art, recognize lyrical purity
All hell breaks loose like a mall with no security
The dopest vocalist, with my third eye I focus with
I proceed, flow with the speed of a Indie motorist
There's more to this than wasted, shiny chains and bracelets
I hit tracks my tongue wait for the brains to blaze it
Amazing angelic, tell it to your people
("Your mic and my mic, come on yo, no equal")

[Hook]
Illadelph is like the sun cause we shine with rhymes
Underground is like the moon you only see us at times
At times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I'm a hellraiser, beautiful mind that smells hatred
Yell phrases, spit heat and melt faces
Excel gracious, rugged terrain on hell’s pavement
Drinking from god’s well until my chest cave in
Wes Craven, nightmare, iron maiden
Keep the iron blazing in this dying nation
Ninja Gaiden, throw stars in constellations
Bars abominations out of satan's basement
From the land where football fans will beat the shit out you
Nuns get beat with hammers til they spit out jewels
Pits that walk astray and take a rip out you
Niggas spit clips and walk away cause they don't live by rules
And I'mma make my presence felt every inch I move
Box game is evident from all the clicks I bruise
Rhyme game is heaven sent, don’t make me rip y’all fools
Or we can pass this mic around and watch your squad get chewed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Don't ever come to me with war
I've severed scores of orators
Rappers fall onto all fours like minotaurs
With Jedi Mind and the Planetary be bombing this
We staying one step above you like a pharmacist
With Ominous, detonate the bomb
Heads dread, hallucinogenics, and Vietnam
I spit a psalm, create bombs like an Iraqi
Swear on the bible and then lie to Ecclesiastes
(Assault and battery)
Battle me that'll be what splits you
Store enormous amounts of energy in a crystal
We boa constrict you, the gods are militant
You faggots couldn't go the length like you was impotent
You ignorant, your whole click is split in half
You step in Allah path, and face Allah wrath
What!

[Hook]
