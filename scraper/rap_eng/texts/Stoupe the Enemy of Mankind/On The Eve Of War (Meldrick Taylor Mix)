[Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz]
This is raw, all across the board, Liquid Sword Chamber
If it's coming from my jaw, then it's pure anger
Heavy metal rap, with a 44 banger
We can settle that, let the mic cord hang ya
I pay homage to the best of them, like Christopher Wallace
And bring drama to the rest of 'em, with biscuits from coppers
I'm with the Lord-Justice, and we raw gritty
Pits of hell, Illadel' to New York City
I brought a four with me, we can capture the ring
And now we more merciless than a Statue of Ming
And ya'll are more purposeless than a pacifist king
You gonna die, like a brawl with a gat in the Bing
It's a passionate thing, the way we make classics
Genuine brilliance or innate madness
Yeah, we all spin on the same axis
And this chrome thing here leave your frame backless
The police always trying to aim flame at us
So I don't mind when a pig brain splatters
I don't mind that we all gonna die soon
I return to the silence of God's tomb
Yeaaaah

[Hook - GZA] x2
There is no escaping once my blade start scraping
My sword indeed make more niggas bleed
Wanabe MC's is shaken
So swift naked eye couldn't record the speed

[Verse 2 - GZA]
Imagine a rhyme in it's prime, from off the baseline
Skyscraper vertical, support the hang time
Evidence that was left at the scene of the crime, traced back to a few from outta group of nine
Who perform well regardless to the price of the tickets
Off or on stage, whatever
Still kick it, with the footwork of Freddy Adu
It's all new, now the rap commissioners they wanna clone my shoe
With the rose now, and its difficult to climb
With the heat and wind and fallin' rocks combined
It's hard to stay aligned the course is an obstacle
Within each chamber the force it unstoppable
Lyrical swordsman blade sharp, I'll cut out your heart
MC's want no part of any type of conflict
Because when I respond quick, it gets thick
The problem goes beyond sick

[Hook - GZA] x2
There is no escaping once my blade start scraping
My sword indeed make more niggas bleed
Wanabe MC's is shaken
So swift naked eye couldn't record the speed
