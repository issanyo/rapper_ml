[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Y'all motherfuckers woke a demon up
The bullets splatter through your spleen and guts
The whole clique duckin they PO
They need to pee in cups
We murder shit like everything the Europeans touch
I dont even talk to motherfuckers, that could lead to trust
We on our din, devils only deal with greed and lust
Beat an elephant with bare hands and take his bleeding tusks
Anytime you hear a cop was murdered best believe its us
Jus Allah load the Glock put em in the weeds and dust
I ain't I sucka I was born with hercules in us
Strangle snakes, dangle grapes fed by European sluts
Yall know where to come to when you need the fuckin trees and dust
Ayo D?? I need by ?? these fucks
I got the power to devour trees , seas and such
I got the power thats the caliber of jesus touch
It dont matter the caliber I proceed to rush
Vinny on a whole nother algebra than the Greeks could touch

[Verse 2: Demoz]
Let me tell you a little something bout a nigga named Moz
Look in his eye you could see the evil if you high
You could notice a little nigga that's eager for the sky
Behind bars scarred like jesus when he died (when he died)
Nigga I was in the hole for a whole 6 months getting high off the reefer thinking why
Im with the roachs and rats hopeless and ?? line and line and the hole in the crack
Nigga I was in the hole trying getting my back, niggas snitching and CEO tried getting my bag
But I dont give a fuck about a snake or a fag a hater id rather see Adolph paid off, laugh
This is real life fuck getting paid off rats And selling my soul to the devil getting paid off rapping Mozerade, Maz , Pazienza clap boys ?? back man you still screaming duffle bag boys

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
I have lived a century, I've tapped into my 6th sensory
I am a potential enemy
My entire inner chemistry, every inch of me, is divinity
Unequivically supremacy
I have undesired energy
Sins friendly since empty
Show the prince of peace no clemency
Give him an extremity of insensitivity
Let his kin and ministry witness his disassembly
I just love sufference, I'm destructive, unproductive
Tussid, not much substance, thuggage
Above judgement, unaware of any error of doubt
Where it counts, I'm a fair amount of paramount
I embody a monopoly of ungodly
The hobby robbed me of my common camaraderie
My apology, arid, insincerity
Charity, very generic, it's hilarity
