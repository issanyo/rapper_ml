I finally understand what all this is
How it was all possible
Now I see
Good Lord, how we must look from out there
Our addiction is evil

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
My brain's on another level than yours
You could only comprehend half of what my memory stores
I only walk through the heavenly doors
And never tryna see the penitentiary walls
I walk barefoot on the equator
With the mental acumen of Bob Lazar
My frame can't be explored by y'all radar
My name can't be absorbed in God's quasar
So I ain't tryna stay around this Hell
Twelve thou from all the twelve tribes of Israel
They call me Ishmael, Lord of the Seas
I'll take your life quick, gone in a fucking breeze
You don't deserve to breathe, your brain thoughtless
While I remain in the same Spain fortress
But pain's gorgeous and love is torture
And anyone who tell you different is a martyr

[Samples]
It makes no difference what I do
Whether I draw blood or not
You cannot see God unless you are pure
Prove there's no evil and you can go
It's the violence of my will against theirs

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I'm from the pits of hell escaping from an Egyptian cell
I dedicate this to the saints that's doing bids in jail
You fucking kids are frail and we the purest form
And the biology of magic is a gorgeous psalm
My deepest thoughts are strong and I'm unbreakable
You wouldn't overstand, you're humanly incapable
My appetite for blood is gruesomely insatiable
And I'm a righteous thug that's brutally defacing you
And you don't want no war, it ain't a game, daddy
I spit a bunch of slugs into your fucking frame, daddy
You just a fucking crumb, my clique is hustling jums
I spit a rap at you to liquify your guts and lungs
But the Devil made me do that
Fighting for the rights of Islam armed with two gats
But y'all knew that, we was coming for blood
And your body, the perfect specimen to put in the mud

[Samples]
You are only a vessel for our God
What are you afraid of?
Eventually everyone does the same
We're not evil because of the evil we do
We do evil because we are evil

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I civilize the savages while you support gay marriages
Evil demons and the Jesus of Nazareth
I keep my blade more sharper than the cactus's
I keep grenades in my parka for the pacifists
And you can't lie to God, cousin
You can't lie to the great Master Fard, cousin
It's a facade, cousin, they wanna lie to you
They wanna tell you that the government's reliable
They wanna tell you that Islam is dangerous
When everybody know the Christians are the blame for this
Cause it's the truth, deal with it
But you complain every time I'm real with it
I'm 'bout to kill critics and then take 'em to war
And teach 'em how to put they love and they faith in Allah
Or I'm breaking their jaw or I'll take 'em to burn
Cause that's the only fucking way that the pagans will learn

[Samples]
Essence is revealed through praxis
Because you are not ready to receive it
It's not like we have any option
There is no history, everything we are is eternally within us
We're not sinners because we sin, we sin because we are sinners

Bleeding trees waiting for judgement day
Where we can all hang ourselves from our own branches
It's not that easy
