[Intro: Flowz Dilione]
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Flowz Dilione]
I'm trapped inside a mental prison
Sentenced to life with no release
At night I sleep next to a knife and hope for peace
My mind won't let me dream so i'm cursed by these nightmares
Visions of my younger brother's blood all over my hands
I'm sick of waking up covered in sweat
Because I'm paranoid that my mates are fucking my ex
See I'm fucked in the head from all the drugs I ingest
I have a heart made from stone there's no love in my chest
There's so much i regret I've made so many mistakes
And yes I do believe in karma so I'm very afraid
I'm not mentally sane
Definitely missing components
And i'm missing composure when I handle the blade
I can't handle the pain that I feel when I'm sober
And the ending feels closer as I stand on my grave
As a man I'm ashamed that's why I hide my emotions
The only time I expose them is when I sever my veins

[Hook]
Will I ever escape from these chains that I'm trapped in?
Or is my fate destined just to fade into blankess?
My brain is stained with the madness
And every time i look into a mirror i see the face of a madman
X2

[Verse 2: Flowz Dilione]
Addiction has me in a tight grip
Just like my hands around my throat
My mind's sick from all the methamphetamines I smoke
Now my memory's a ghost lost forever in a brainstorm
Where the dark weather stays and forever the rain pours
I can't escape war the fighting never ends
So of course I'm gonna go and fucking hit the pipe again
My life is bent I don't think that I've ever been straight
And time spent now is with drugs and never with mates
I have a cancerous fate there's no cure for this sickness
I'm past the point of no return I'm permanently twisted
I'm murderous when drinking fueled by revenge
So that slut can only hope that I never see her again
I'll be leaving her dead
She won't be talking shit when i'm fucking eating her flesh
And the knife is deep in her neck
I now dream of my death stuck alone inside this mental prison
Where my screams for heap fall on deaf ears as gentle whispers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Peeps]
Depression is something you can't win
You can just suppress the symptoms
I ain't letting them in and they ask if I'm ok but I ain't listening
I am different I am fucked in the brain
Something has changed something is missing
Cut to the rain jumping in front of a train
Death my ugly mistress
Fuck that bitch I don't want to know the whore
She's the overlord to my sober thoughts
So I smoke this draw till my throat is sore
I've got no conscience stored no control no more
Fuck them doctors they're nothing but impostors
Chuck you on them tabs leave you feeling lost kid
You don't know what the fuck that I've been through
You can keep the tissues give me a pistol
I ain't scared of you i'm scared of myself
Scared of what I'll do to everyone else
Did I go overboard? did I go crazy on drugs?
No it's just the prescriptions the doctor gave me bruv

[Hook]
