"Soul's from the streets of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane"

[Verse 1: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
My mathematical powers devour cowards as I spray words
Like acid rain showers, nations, you can't face them
Erase them or I praise them, as my mind excites the wind
Like spiritual incantations, time will clash
On ya cipher, lyric concealed behind whirlwind fire
Or flood, draw blood from wack souls as I smack hoes
With accessible decibels
The damage that my syntax causes is irreparable
The vanity of my insanity force ya whole click to be divided
You have just bear witnessed to dub side united

[Verse 2]
Who do you love? Bugs, styles and fresh
And numb somes of soul, witchcraft
The clutch is the archer's mode, and sure plot
Of device, we shot twice, out of the same barrel
Rush through life, it's off this slug
Advise me with words from death, and new com battles
Far time left, and pure shot plug that way
You marathon, let me down to grace the plate
Full stagnant, touch I, but revamp the squad
Gettin' loops, saviate on contact

[Verse 3]
The triflin four fists, sparks another spliff
Bodies left stiff, you can't fuck with my ruggedness
My gunshots is leaving niggas on they asses
Smoking all the cannabis, like the weed savage
Rip dimensions and it matters, you take an L
You no challenge, I blow up, ya muthafuckin' brain cells
And leave you leaking, the slang tongue speaking
Cocks back the fifth, teflon starts to seek it
Criminals on a move, set a threat
Sip the moet, and let off the twin techs to ya muthafuckin' chest

[Hook]
"Soul's from the streets of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane"
"Rhyme be coming from an illadelph state of mind"

[Verse 4]
I speak double-double, cause double trouble never do I rumble
On a rule, my microphone sever clones
It's beyond binoculars, since the 46 chromosomes
No more no less, no need to flex the evil, trip with the clip
I got the 6-1-0 flow, and 082 is my zip
Yo, so call me out in Philly when you down to flip
No frill skills, or freestylin' when y'all wildin'
I'm broadcasting all the way live, from Philly's Long Island

[Verse 5]
I visualize cream, tech's strapped with infered beams
Stash keys, and tease, bickin' back sipping Don P
My click of criminals, living comfortable
My pockets full of benjamins, fool surrending
When I'm blendin' in, dub side invincible
Imperial, for lyrical tactics
I react with, son you get ya ass kicked
Indeed the face of evil, is the face told by me
So I proceed to bleed my people, niggas say I'm too cerebral
Realize, dub side, flippin' perfection through your section
Sanity's slippin', whose the next victim to catch a bless

[Verse 6]
Set a threat, I rip the mic and run race like an auto shop
[?] I disperse leavin' heads in a casket box
Watch this nappy headed villain, brutal torture is illegal
I back down clowns with a four pound, as I defeat you
Inserting lyrical slugs, that's straight deadly
A nickel plated verse I spit like a hollow tip steady
Constantly cocking back rapid fire weapon
This adolescent keeps a clip full for street protection
Ain't nothing complex about the way I cock my biscuit
I said a threat and bust a tech son, it's not explicit
Exquisite, in divine rhymes I drop like jewels
The mic I abuse when I choose to break fools

[Hook]

[Verse 7]
With this course, I force many emcees out the galaxy
Challenge me, I rip apart flows with my analogy
Now that me, got that established I crack ya cabbage with styles
You can't manage to damage or even fathom the mental capacity
Cuz I harass these wack emcees, in degrees
I splatter universe, and mounting casaulties
In the dark, I spark cells, dwelling in dungeons
My assumptions canonical, unstoppable, mad logical
I pull centrifugal, mystical, my poetics
Rip phonetics up, and rich with the cynical

[Verse 8]
Coming back from the city of Atlantic, it's the hispanic
Causing mass panic, with fat static for ya addict
Automatic, I stick shift swift if you test me
Left the ciphers, layin' lifeless, seen in one spot and attended
Bet you get ya crews bruised in black and blues
Put ya name and age on the front page, of the newspaper
I drape my hood up on my carriage, damage faggots
With the habits, feedin' on emcee's like maggots
Inspect ya gadgets, my style switches cause I flipped it
Return the microphone, fix the stitches, cause I ripped it

[Verse 9]
I can't stand like a maniac depressin'
That's been submerged in subterranean utopia
My dimension that I'm representin'
Is the Philadelphia suburbs
Which has regenerated neoterics
That kicks esoteric poetry on this plain of obscurity
One element, top lyricist
Interlocked with, D-U-B squad of imperialist
With an innovator as the dictator
So we can see you, liver clues with solipsistic views
Heads emulate but can't duplicate
Cause this side can't be tugged, yo, one love

[Hook]
