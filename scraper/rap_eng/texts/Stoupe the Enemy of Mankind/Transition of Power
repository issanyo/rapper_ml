[Verse 1 - Lil' Fame]
Ayo them boys are dead
Yep, yep, I do that
See me in the streets and they wonder my crew at
I'm to the good, but y'all already knew that
They fear me like Radames
I got the Juice, Part 2
Fuck it, where the fuck is Raheem and Q at?
Tell them niggas I'm bringing '92 back
Cause everybody wanna act rowdy
And shoot up the party
See no persona is John Gotti without the body
And you know who, you know who give niggas the blueprint
On how you gotta do shit
The truth is back
And I am that (yes sir)
No more, no less, stand tall, no vest (no stress)
I know I talk a lot of shit but I can back it up
We kinfolk with them blammer manufacturers
(It's blasphemy) but ain't nothing soft about me
You get hit with the grand finale

[Hook]
This is thug activity (street life liberty)
Old ghetto remedy (toss em a slug)
Find me where the winners be (transition of power)
Find me where the winners be (transition of power)

[Verse 2 - Billy Danze]
I came here to win something
You know my type, I'll defend something (easy)
Fragrant and grimy on the pavement
Losing ain't an option
It's a process when your project hoppin
Progress, that's what's poppin
No stress, they done let the block in
Pour Old Gold, they done let Barack in
Now look at homes stroll
The White House halls, Chi-Town boppin
Me? I'm at the top ten
No transition of power, no inauguration, I just popped in
Watch and learn some shit, I'm concerned with hits
Privilege and craft, I'm confirmed legit
I'm like a mu-gician of musicians, we all gifted
They stop to listen and briefly visit, exquisite (easy)
I'll give you chills when you chill and leave you tilted
Y'all in the building, try not to forget who built it

[Hook (repeat x2)]
