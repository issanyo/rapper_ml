[Hook: Block McCloud]
We're so sick with the flow, sing along like you caught A disease
Manifest in the mirror, don't sing lip shows
We go beyond Man it's hard to believe
Guess we're blessed it's a miracle So watch
It's the Army Of Pharaohs bring your squad to its knees
Go from flesh to the spiritual Gotta pray for a miracle
Like Moses when he parted the seas
Yes, yes, it's a miracle

[King Magnetic]
They talking stupid on the stoop, I'm in the studio with Stoupe
I'm unusually loose, In a movie role with truth
Co-starring, don't spar with no artist my level
Froze target, slow harvest, bogarted by metal
So god but so ghetto, so far but so settled
Don't harbor no problems, no father slow peddle
Roseto late bloom, now silence the method
We all got a history of violence on the record
Except for this record Babygrande, if this lady take the stand
Then my record's playing in the court like a reggae band
Still a lady's man, Mag expects it
I don't get brain, I test dames' gag reflexes
Ecstasy dealer, I bag they X's
Stab 'em breathless without grabbing breakfast
I might pull her hair though, or with something out with air holes
Get lower than a flat when I'm reaching where the spare goes!

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, yo
You can Never fuckin' test the God
The kickback of the Smith & Wesson hard
Allah think that you a devil for ingesting lard
That's a part of every lesson that he said the far
Vinnie never claimed to be a prophet, I'm a vessel God
Me and my seven Mac-11s have a special bond
Same bond when the Qu'ran give me a special calm
I wave the motherfuckin' ratchet like its Desert Storm
And use it so I can detach you from your legs and arms
Im the one who reinventin the steel
The one who took the art of rhymin', reinvented the wheel
My venom will kill
My spit game like a neurotoxin
They call me blood and guts warrior, Arturo Boxin
It's nothing anything or anyone can do to stop 'em
Matter of fact even attemptin', it's a foolish option
Anyone who try to disrespect my crew, I pop em
Or tell the rest of the Boriqua, bring the tool and ox 'em

[Jus Allah]
Bury them and the Aryans that carried them
All stare, scared their humanitarians
Spare none of them, tear their young from them
Shun them, run them into Kingdom Come's conundrum
Hunt them, punish them, confront them
Drunken them, come undone Sunken
Summons him from the stomach of a sunless dungeon
Bludgeon them, make the chump to become consumption
Not an option to stop us, fairly obvious
They're innocuous, the despair of the populous
Get your fill of ill-gotten goddesses
Drill them with a modest amount of bottomless promises
Turn the water scarlet red, let it churn from the faucet heads
Get to detailed little trails in the carpet threads
Have 'em adamantly smack on the architect
Havin' carte blanche on the carnage, have my heart set
