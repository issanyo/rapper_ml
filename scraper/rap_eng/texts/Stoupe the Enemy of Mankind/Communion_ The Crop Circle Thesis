[Verse 1: El Eloh]
I am he who walks beyond the cycle of Tan
A guinea systematic survey
On the heavens long before the spells of Kemet
I had advanced cosmos, journey apologist
Substantiate statements
I commands the aspects of creation
Astronomers can't even interpret my ancient civilisation
Of Andromeda, the Dragon of Dracos
Come touch the inner sun
I went forth, a life force out of the core of Epsu
Bring forth the possibilities of solar energy into infinity
Like a Nimbo; endless, trapped it, Kingu
A myth too ignorant like the Sumerians
Explorer of the solar system like Galileo
Bring the mist of Mahabharata
Celestial God symbolic to the disagreeable complex mathematics of the Hebrew Bible
Receive and transmit the letters of the Rasqiniaans
Who have seen the third suns
I am like Milutin Milanković
Who outlined the theory of ground philosophies
Messiah of all biblical tablets
Watch how the process of creation
Links with the measurements of time
Scientifical like a geologist
I bring the geological changes to the world
Like the prophecies of the Book of Revelations

[Verse 2: Cosmic Crusader]
The compartment allies
Now my device shatters the fusel anomas
And for my dialectical, destroyed innocuous in conquest
Travel beyond five dimensions
A cipher cytoplasm or phantasm
An archetype antithetical to atoms
I leave you vacuous like an Organtoron
Pulses facilitate my brain waves
Determining what planet I’m on
Cybertron transmit my Mhakabaraso over the sea of influence
Never neglect my nebular units
Stereo-material movements
Painfully cranials statisticals giving your cerebral cortex
Damaging demigods, crushing egos
Into which a wench began by extracting a transcortical
Connections of macros-manic animals
Caves of sleek stature, once sabbatical
Once bring drama, I’m bright on harrowing lava
Within the plexus from my anatomical
It gets darker, a sense of urgency
Enters the atmosphere with my excursion
In this microcosm, a third version
Specifically a generation of mutated
Warriors from the Nether that’s ‘Neva Antiquated’
My flux is like somatic stimulation
As macro-electrolytes converge
Eternal recurrence, my mentals merge
It's cyclical, but it revamps its own thesis
Reaching the premium blend in the communion

[Verse 3: Ancient Kemet]
Follow me beyond the cloud
In the stratosphere to the House of El Huul
It should lead you to a place opposite my heavenly throne
In the temple of ancient Kemet
Who discovered the wonders and the 24 elders
These beings, the Rasqiniaans
Come to enlighten you with supreme mathematics
Dramatically stood – twelve disagreeable, twelve agreeable
Seven feet tall in diameter
These elders sit on the flight in the craft Niburu
Passing through the universe density levels
Heading straight for the wrath of Andromeda
Elliptical physical galaxy
Containing beings in the line of Dracos
Stomping on negative snakes like broncos
Create magnetic field around my aura
Incapacitating ships
Negative energy creates the spiritual slaughter
Where you dwell in the physical world is horror
My mind returns to Illyuwn
To inform the elders of the incident
In case of the need for assistance
To return to my epic form
From my physical, and see my soul arise into a sham
Hitting the arcs of cumulus clouds of Annun
I left my image of a crop circle
In the form of a galactical star map
Perhaps to another plane of consciousness

[Verse 4: Ikon The Verbal Hologram]
Through a series of psychological tests
I have been declared a demon
Traveling through dimensions
Fatal weapons leave you bleeding
Dissecting gray matter, doesn't matter in my cathedral
But how could you stand my Timberlands in your cerebral?
Faces of space probes be scattered through my mental
Acoustics in my chamber just endanger instrumental
Fundamental rhythms are symbols of eternal power
Get devoured by my infinite skills to disappear
Getting lost in the holocaust that rage between my ears
Complex like gravity, tragically and mathematically
I defeat your squadron black magically
Analyze the tangle as you get mangled by my triangular rhythms
Systematic rotations of my words cause cataclysms

[Verse 5: Breath of Judah]
In the farthest universal
At your communion Nefilim council
Beings come to some planets in your galaxy
That were most frequently visited
Because life existed there in various forms
And deities it was why they explore Mars
Gives meanings, Ahnk is Jah
Foremost to the firm land
Super friends of man, fore-prophesize sight
Tight with a photon of light, rubber band
Others in Orion, skies or heaven
Star sections, constellation ploughing towards us
Lending aid to help our Taurus
Routine, orbit on the slate, clean
Took a thousand, one for sure fall
Equinox a birth time deemed, the team of thirteen
Searching our rich natural resources
And minerals to take back after retrieving
Our responsibilities are fulfilled
Like the Onus of Annun and Enlil
So, build the unstoppable force of evolution!
