Continually suppress myself, sometimes my head is too aware
Missing out on rest because sometimes I get too fucking scared
The penalties of my mind doing shit that yours don't..
Its boundaries forever missing, there's no cure, I'm left with hope

Hypochondriac as fuck, aware of every capillary
Ain't a type of worry that you could name that I ain't have already
Anywhere I go there's no familiar faces
Anything I look at for too long just stops to make sense

Every single action that I take becomes a memory
Looking at the same picture, you don't see the shit I see
Look a little closer, try to understand my pain
Geometric patterns in my sight before a migraine

Then my dissociation stops, I feel reality
But my perception and experience of it is so much
I disconnect immediately again before I throw up
I might be faking, but it's more than likely Satan's cold touch

If you want to know about overthinking, ask me how
I'm never sure, it could be purely panic, or I'm passing out
And as I get older, yo, it just gets worse
Counting my steps to confirm my control, I feel cursed

At the same time I feel blessed it's all internally
Although I feel my soul grow weaker every word I speak
I was given this gift because I'm strong enough to handle it
Give my mind anything and it'll just dismantle it

Sometimes I won't even leave my house 'cause of a bad feeling
But it seems like I always get that mothafuckin bad feeling
I still ain't sure how to identify it when it fucking matters
Forcing me to treat all of my feelings like they fucking matter

If you want to know about overthinking, ask me how
I'm never sure, it could be purely panic, or I'm passing out
