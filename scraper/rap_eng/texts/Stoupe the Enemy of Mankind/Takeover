Hip-Hopery, arm robbery, straight jackery
None backing me, flashing guns
Chuck poison at the gas pump
Blasting blunt skins on some fun shit
Take her for the cash son
The last one that had to run left with stacks from the ransom
Old man done, ran out of money stealing lattes from his grandson
Buttatones know the name
I don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck the whole game
You can't black ball an AWAL
I don't even play ball
That's not what I got my name for
I get live and stay raw
Catch me on the train and bass yo with my headphones on
In the zone beyond normally reach
My thoughts are so deep, my soul is one
If then than if
Fuck the same old song
I've been chilling charging my own battery for so long, so long
