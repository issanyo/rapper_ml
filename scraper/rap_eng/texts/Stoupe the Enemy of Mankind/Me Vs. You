Raw from New York to the center of the Earth
?? warning y'all talk, no one remembered the words
Give it up you can't spit nothing, better rehearse
Wack fuck your rap sucks, I never check for your verse
You ain't shit I don't like you, stop spitting like you homicidal
You probably go home and read the Bible
Livest rapper alive, I hold the title
An emcee so deadly I already killed every rival
They can't come against me, lost before began
I'm coming for your head with a sword in my hand
Guard your neck while the architect drawing a plan
Spit unique, when I hit the beat you fall where you stand
People talk about you, then that's what it is
Have some food on the stove when I come to your crib
After I eat I'll make your mom suck my dick
I'm a sick fuck everyone I know is fucking sick
