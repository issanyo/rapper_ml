[MadMan]

I'm the naysayer, throwing straight jabs and haymakers
The KO floor shaker, I'm the motherfucking jaw breaker
Slash deal maker that stack paper
I'm the wax baker, cannabis vapor
Staying higher than a skyscraper
The Empire Stater, keep one locked in the chamber
Better watch your behavior
I'm the freak of nature, everybody's in danger
Kill and leave no remainder, I'm your personal trainer
Straight liquor, no chaser, whole bottle of Jager
Don't do me know favors, my flow will melt the glaciers

[Tones]

The earthquaker, Grand Canyon crater creater
The ground raiser, human waster, fresh paper lacer
Mic embracer vocal amazer flavor spitter
Fire twister, the lava spiller
Zodiac killer, primate gorilla
Stage diving back flipper
Realer understander smooth hustlin trigga gambler
Comatoser, mental overdosed unfilled scroller
Spliff roller, roller coaster overthrower
