[Verse 1: Breath of Judah]
To the angelic seventh cathedral
Relic illadelphia, write words of power
Him who was holy, who holds the key
That opens, no one considered
Since an initiate's sound of seven trumpets
Those Synagogues of Satan
Will fall down at my feet knowing I've awakened
I'm comin' soon for them, Elohim's the New Jerusalem
Puttin' millennium criticisms on christians
Two shall be revealed by the seventh cathedral seal
As above, so below. Behold Davidâ€™s seal
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
Those who defame me shall keep open my wounds
No liars allowed in the school of Mogoon

[Verse 2: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Seven plagues of the seven angels
Seven emcees get strangled by the seven holiest triangles
I have mangled plexiglass beams that see through
Sons of Evil like Robbie Knievel
I believe you are the lamb prepared for the verbal slaughter
Save your breath like you was under water
I am torture like the fear of internationalism
Nazi eugenics and economic rationalism
I am the being born unto the scourge
And I am the being bringing holy wars
Orators from the womb of ill Yune
Glory be to the sustainer El Kuluwm
Gabriel fell from the steps of the heavens
Extraditing evil-rooted angels in the seventh

[Hook x2]
As it was in the beginning
So it shall be in the end

[Verse 3: Rasul Allah]
Black Tibetan abbot Abyssinians
That begins the extortiation of the fullations
Battle through the tombs of the Shangri La
Of Illadelphia Shambala, enter the paradigm
Of Rasul Allah Assyrian celestial Hebrews
Penance of the Etherians, hieroglyphians
I am the silhoutte, a risky [?]
The ill czar shine of two one five
Behold sons of limitless light, border rights
That reveal from the seventh heavenly hill
The book of el's, in jail, the apocalyptical tabernacle sacred
Satharotic, propheatical chapels
The synagogues of El Kuluwm, the ghost fills the monastery
Sanctuary cathedral, from the kingdom of Melchezevik
We the mystics redeem the Annunaki Elohim
We were originated from where? The blackness of light
Was formulated from our synapses
If you get tarnished in all phrases and salutation
To the mercifullness, glory of the Sunz of Mansion

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ancient Kemet]
Sink like the Titan', into the cold
Dark waters of the ocean, my thought modes
Shift Atlantis into motion
Elevated to rise beyond the shores, revelators
For episodes to the future, energy seekin'
Intruder, infiltrate the perimeter
Lock you in my initiation chamber
Prove to the guard snakes, not a stranger
With four large spiritual anger

[Hook x2]
