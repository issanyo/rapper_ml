[Intro: Slaine talking]
Wake up
Wake up motherfucker

(Strobe light effect everything movin' slow)

[Verse One: Slaine]
I woke up afternoon with my jeans and my jacket on
Empty bottles everywhere, Jameson and Jack is gone
Ashes on the futon, roaches in the ashtray
Cocaine residue stickin' to a glass plate
Eyes on fire, head bumpin' like a bass kick
Last night's a blur let's ensure I was wasted
But what I do last night?
Where was I last night?
A kid from Miami round 5 on a fast flight
Hopped in a cab to the lab laid a rhyme
Met my peoples at the bars for some drinks, eight or nine
I was blunted when I came, puffin' marijuana blends
Caught up with some corner friends
They fucked me out my mind, I mean they must've no doubt
Cause I'm on the couch with a night I know nothin' about
I'm a villain in the night when I'm spillin' my drinks
Until I piece it back together and I fill in the blanks

[Scratched Hook x2]
(I'm sick demented, I came to represent it)
(Drugs got my brains fried makin' it hard to think)
(Strobe light effect everything movin' slow)
(I keep livin' like this I might lose it)

[Verse Two: Slaine]
My anxiety was awful, kept me feelin' hostile
I stopped pacin', my heart racin', a flarin' nostril
I remember a girl who was wearin' some Aeropostale
A lost soul, I think she had me caught in a lasso
All day a sucker for love, I'm such an asshole
Drink on and drugs kick in, it's only natural
Mixed up like Donnie Soprano and Tony Brasco
Dick suckin', crazy ass hoes, it ain't a hassle
This is how I was thinkin' 'bout the bitches and the drinkin'
I figured the blinds open has us blinkin' on a Lincoln
My man was walkin' toward my stoop my fuckin' heart sinkin'
Bangin' on my door, something smelled fishy I stopped drinkin'
Pulled me aside his eyes are clouded with tears he can't see
He said, "Allison is dead."
Oh my God it can't be
The pain written on his face he didn't have to talk it
My address was on a script bottle in her pocket

[Scratched Hook x2]

[Verse Three: Slaine]
Yes I'm a man who's been filled with malice and shame
Between dreams and reality I balance and hang
Dare we say that I'm pissin' away my talents and thangs
And what could I have done to save Allison James?
? know me, I was sniffin' coke till the nose bleed
She was eatin' Xany's, shootin' dope until she O.D'd
I took her to the hospital, left her for the doctor
And the nurses probably looked after her, watchin' her
I like to make the details up as I go along
And think I did the right thing even though I know I'm wrong
But I don't know what all this does, push me to the wall
I had another in my cell the smell of pussy on my balls
(She died)
I didn't even know who she was
Maybe she was just a whore who'd only blow me for drugs
Maybe I was just in love on that day in September shit
Maybe it's a fantasy, maybe I remember it
