We just got off the phone and it's over
I'm mad about you, you're mad about me
Baby it's over
I realise it's cruel to keep you standing around
While my heart acts so confused
I've been unhappy
I failed you, you love me

I'm learning to open other doors
Just before it rains
I'm learning to open other windows
I'm ready to feel

I cherished all your care and now it's over
You tried to keep me
I tried to keep you, baby, it's over
I know we both have tried
But now it's time to come clean
I'm so sorry to do this, daddy
I made you unhappy
I left you, you loved me

I'm learning to open other doors
Just before it rains
I'm learning to open other windows
I'm ready, I'm not ready
I'm leaving you, baby

I'm learning to open other doors
Just before it rains
I'm learning to open other windows
I'm ready to feel the rain

You held me like a a flood of gold that you had bought and I had sold
I'm ready to feel the rain, I'm ready to feel
I'm leaving you in the rain, I'm leaving
