This could be the last time you ever hear me son. It's what I live and die for. Yeah. Feel the vibe right, right

Sometimes I wonder what the fuck is the meaning
People looking at me like I'm stuck or I'm dreaming
But this could be the last time you ever get to hear me
You ain't got to feel me, you motherfuckers fear me
I speak clearly, I keep it moving with the earth
You can search, you will never hear truer words
From birth til death, home to the tomb
Cradle to the grave
From seed to full blow
Entrusted by my sacrifices symbolize potential
A vibe that can only be described by the instrumental
This is life, you could feel the energy
Reminiscing of the fleeting friends that been next to me
Life changes as it comes, I'm fading to the drums
Make the sun shine and turn the pain into the love
One time I changed my mind and still ain't enough
Blazing up, doing what ever I can to escape the touch, straight up
