[Chorus]
You better run, girl and find yourself a better guy
There's too much madness for you to even try
You better run, girl and find yourself a better plan
There's so much love here but I ain't your average man

[Verse 1]
We don't got a dinner set that makes you feel classy when you eat
My dear mother curse my father out cause he cursing when he speaks
The feds known to interrupt a meal 'cause we don't respect the law
So & so missing from their seat 'cause with the drugs comes the withdrawal

[Chorus]
You better run, girl and find yourself a better guy
There's too much madness for you to even try
You better run, girl and find yourself a better plan
There's so much love here but I ain't your average man

[Bridge]
I pray and plead you go and get up and leave, girl
Go save yourself while there's time
Your mommy, daddy ain't approving of me, girl
So go and find that good fit, goodbye

[Verse 2]
My brother tried to stab me Christmas Eve 'cause the baked clams I ain't share
My sister beat the neighbor up 'cause her bad kids don't play with my niece fair
We don't got a phony cover up what ya see is how we do, do
So God bless if ya treat me right but if ya don't, I'm scared for you

[Chorus]
You better run, girl and find yourself a better guy
There's too much madness for you to even try
You better flee and find yourself a better plan
There's so much love here but I ain't your average man

[Vamp]
(Run, girl) Run! You better run, you better run, you better run, you better run, you better
(Run, girl) You better, you you you better, you better, you you you better
(Run, girl) WooHoo!
(Run, girl) You better run, you better run, you better run, you better run, you better run, woo!
Run girl!
