Words that you gave
Stories you save
Waste of your time
Work you said, no
Magic within me
No magic without
You'd hear my heart
If you just shut your mouth
When you take it
Take it easy
If you take it at all
When you take it
If you take it
At all

You scream
All tears stream
Pack my bags and cross the street
No light left on for me to see
You're the one that wants to leave

Not at my most eloquent
I'm at my most element, no
Magic within me
No magic without
You'd hear my heart
If you just shut your mouth
If you take it
Take it easy
If you take it at all
When you take it
Take it all

You scream
All tears stream
Pack my bags and cross the street
No light left on for me to see
You're the one that wants to leave

Feet touching feet
Sleep slowly taking over me
Beyond all walking
I will find
Feet touching feet
Sleep slowly taking over me
Beyond all walking
I can fall
If you take it
Take it easy
If you take it at all
When you take it
If you take it
At all

When you break me
Break me easy
If you take me at all

If you take me at all
