Transparent vocals flesh to the mind
Everything inside get expressed when I rhyme
I represent Buttatones til the end of time
All reflection in the brilliance that once let you shine
Nevermind you wouldn't get it anyway
All the visions of tomorrow get sent to yesterday
I fought hard, got scarred, couldn't get away
And after that she still won't let me stay
What could I say love it evil, hate is pure
Been holding on for so long I can't wait no more
Walk outside with a firearm to engage a war
I'm a peaceful person, that's what they made me for
Spent days being poor that led to nights being cold
It's all according to life on the ??
Somehow I found a way to connect mic to soul
Overhead as I ride hold the light I control
