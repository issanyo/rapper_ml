[Hook: Samples & Vinnie Paz]
Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
Y'all ever smell the stench of dead bodies?
Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
Animal thugs who bust slugs in the lobby

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz & Des Devious]
Fuck George W. Bush and what he stand for
For sending my little cousin into the damn war
What the fuck we on somebody else's land for?
Murder innocent people for Uncle Sam's law
Everybody know it's all over oil
It's all for the greed and the money that ain't for you
It's all for the head of the state that ain't loyal
Off with the head of a snake, he ain't royal
He gave two-billion dollars to the Taliban
And young Americans dead before they had a fam
Look, I don't got beef with a war
I got beef with a war mistreating the poor
I got beef with everything that he do
I got beef with the lies misleading the youth
And I'm about to take the law in my own hands
And I'm about to aim a 4 at a grown man
North, south, we should ride up at night
Black masks, black tape, black gun to his wife
Should we terrorize the city like the Summer of Sam?
Or should we kidnap the president's wife without a plan?

[Hook: Samples]
Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
Anybody move, shake, shiver, quiver, I buck

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz & Des Devious]
We at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave
And I'm about to run up in this motherfucker and blast
First things first, cousin, how we get in?
We could take the janitor for all they gear and they timbs
We could tell them that we trying to raise money for aids
And we could start the onslaught for all they criminal ways
Now that we in here, where the fuck the wife at?
Where my four pound? Where the fucking knife at? My fault, it's right here with the spiked bat
We deading 'em raw, nobody can fight back
She probably in the bedroom scared to death
She heard gunshots and she knew what's next
Des, kick in the door
If the bitch make a move, dump a clip in the whore
She ain't moving, that bitch took a piss on the floor
And she ain't getting nothing else except a kick in the jaw
Tell her husband we need more money for poor folk
And to respect others like the book that Allah wrote
Nah nigga, I ain't with that deal
Put a bullet in her head and let him see how it feels

Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
