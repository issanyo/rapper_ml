1st Verse
I'm the fool a sucker too 'cause who I'm praying to
I'm painted as the enemy, 'cause I don't do what they tell me
This juggernaut of ones who mock and sell souls for a shot
Have the nerve to curse your name, laugh at you call you lame

Pre Chorus
But nothing, nothing compares to when I get to see your face
So I can't, I can't, I can't wait

Chorus
'Cause boy it's gonna be hot
When the whole world goes down in flames (just burn it up yeah, burn it up yeah)
Yeah it's gonna be hot
When the whole world goes down in flames (just burn it up yeah, burn it up yeah)

2nd Verse
I don't fear no one who bares the same flesh that I wear
Nothing in the world scare me, I pity those that don't know he
Denying you, 'cause lies hate truth, they read and watch the news
The media mutes your name, politicians use for gain, yeah

Pre Chorus
But nothing, nothing compares to when I get to see your face
So I can't, I can't, I can't wait

Chorus
'Cause boy it's gonna be hot
When the whole world goes down in flames (just burn it up yeah, burn it up yeah)
Yeah it's gonna be hot
When the whole world goes down in flames (just burn it up yeah, burn it up yeah)

Bridge
If you don't wanna feel that fire like me and my friends, let me hear you say whoa oh (whoa oh), whoa oh (whoa oh)
So if you wanna crush that liar, join me and my friends. Let me hear you say whoa oh (whoa oh), whoa oh (whoa oh)

Pre Chorus
Nothing, nothing compares to when I get to see your face
So I can't, I can't, I can't wait

Chorus
'Cause boy it's gonna be hot
When the whole world goes down in flames (just burn it up yeah, burn it up yeah)
Yeah it's gonna be hot
When the whole world goes down in flames (just burn it up yeah, burn it up yeah)
Boy it's gonna be hot
When the whole world go down in flames
