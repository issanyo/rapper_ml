[Verse 1]

You want to take shots of alcohol?
I’ll send straight shots to your upper jaw
And fuck you up raw like sex wit no condom on
In school I never got along wit my peers
I was too busy hollering at soccer moms in the parking lot outside sears
Oh my! Lets take some time to rewind the clock
Before these fake felines were all over my (moan)
I’m talking Halloween in second grade
I cut off my neighbors leg, with a razor blade
That everyone thought was fake
Trick or treat was never meant for me
Because I’m ill mentally, with lyrics especially
Obsessed wit the kill murder weapons are my accessories
Chopping limbs off pedestrians, just for looking at me
I kill shit naturally, I turn active soldiers to missing in action
I’ll drain the piss out your bladder, make you ashamed to be a rapper
I'll help u find another passion, just to shit on that one
Now beat that. No Mike Jack, no career and no deal
You went from street cat to street rat
And now you just road kill

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Who got skills, that could destroy and rebuild
Entire regions? I'm fire breathing MC's who claim to be real
I grip the mic like I grip the steel
Like my life depends on it
Put a niggas death on it, I got a license to kill
You the type to bring a candle to a flamethrower fight
I’m the type that’ll take your shine and turn off the lights
YoU say you committing crimes and never lose in a fight
But when its time to ride wit your niggas you nowhere in sight
I see it in your eyes you be fucking with the blue and whites
I hope it was worth the price, I hope you made peace with God on your final night
Lay you on your deathbed wit a mac 10 and shotty
Bullets ringing through your intestines midsection and reshaping your body
Until you deformed beyond recognition, and see these demons within me
I don’t need an exorcism or a second opinion
I just need some prescriptions, blast the doc if he don’t fill it in
And kill any witnesses, I let them know who the illest is! Bitch

[Hook]
