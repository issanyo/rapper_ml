I'm America's Nightmare
My mind keep stepping in the depths of hell
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
Livin' in the world no different from a cell

[Verse 1:Vinnie Paz]
There wasn't a god before me,there won't be a god after me
Attack you on a cellular level and cause atrophy
I'm a war monger I never explore passively
I would die first so humans a blood match for me
I was in the land of Israel with four Maccabees
I am the perfect machine you can't hack in me
My mind is the perfect regime you can't rap with me
Nine with the infra-red beam and blood splats on me
Vinnie ain't a sucker, he doesn't record happily
I just black out in the darkness of god's tapestry
Boomerang suckers I throw em they come back to me
That's why I travel with guards and 4 gats on me
I don't even listen to y'all, y'all all wack to me
I don't want that bullshit y'all make attached to me
45 calibre claw so fall back from me
While y'all gradually get trapped in the earth's gravity

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
Unafraid of zero, I am made of make believe and miracles
Heroes, I am of space's greatest materials
Spiritual, invisible, immaterial
Simple, insensible, imperial
Indispensable, pinnacle, essential
Uneventful, unpreventable
My mind is sinful, my body's a temple
My soul is cleansable, I'm full of potential
I allure the pure, I adopt the rotten to the core
Copy these atrocities of war
Poke two holes in her shoulder to hold me over
Eyein' me sober is like findin' a four leaf clover
Pray for my obscene behavior, I'm a dream slayer
Call me when you need a favor I'm a team player
I'm a peacemaker, cheap labor
Be with your believed creator, greet nature

[Verse 3:]
For my fam I'mma ride for ya, I commit a homicide for ya
In the court with the judge tell a fuckin' lie for ya
And that's just somethin' that a sucker couldn't understand
How a G shed a tear then hug his man
My mind only paralleled by the laureates
Tell Satan I just caught a body and absorbed his debt
I cock the hammer and I saw him sweat
You must be stupid thinkin' you could be a devil and Allah forget
We the greatest fuckin' clique in the game
If you know somebody better pussy give me they name
It wouldn't be sane, that's a dumb fucking move cousin
I got the Roger Clemens heater 22s cousin
I ain't sayin' y'all can't be around here
I'm just sayin' we ain't gonna let you eat around here
We demons round here, carnivore heathens round here
A bunch of grimy motherfuckin' human beings round here
