[Intro: Spoken, John Doe (Kevin Spacey)]
"I'm setting the example, and what I've done is gonna be puzzled over
And studied
And followed
Forever."

[Verse 1: Ikon]
Prepare for the verbal war
The hologram advance, physical form
Manifest the universal mind into the law
Travelling lands, I stand on sands of chemical vibrations
The math, kings of light departed in wrath
So where you gonna stand when the Elohim return
Seven great stages throughout the ages say you burn
It's my turn to shine
I redefine the crystalline-biological structures, implanted in your mind
So I find the deaf, dumb and blind
And bless 'em with science, and leave the blind ones behind
Descending into big balls of mass, in the form of rain
The Verbal Hologram brings pain
So rearrange disagreeable ways that brought you the darkness
Take hold and rip out your soul from your carcass
And rise away like a sham
The Verbal Hologram is the verbal avalanche
One last chance to re-plan and over-stand
Before the Hologram sends your camp to Holy Land
So ask your man, when he returns to where I sent him
The plan was to kill God and reinvent him
Practicing Black Magical tactics like voodoo
Attacking like the seven deadly warships of Nibiru

[Hook: Sample]
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum

[Verse 2: Ikon]
I bring forth the mighty Udamiu, the powerful Sapagra
The darkening behind you, the biblical omega man
The Ashtar command, I came to bring mortals the barathary gland
So here I stand on the Four Corners of Stonehenge
Travelling through portals, the thunderbolt of battles, the lord of the immortals
The zeal of the seven, the rising of the demon
The lost books of the Bible and forgotten books of Eden
The heathens, who burn like pyrhosis
Handed the Holy tablets, like Moses
The blackening of roses, will send you to the edges of the land
The emerald tablets, of Thoth the Atlantean
The hands of the mighty lion of Judah
Will throw you through the triangular portals of Bermuda
Exploring the Hologramic aspects of consciousness
For aliens to devour
Orthodox first relativistic equations for power
The shower of acid rain brings pain to the land
You cannot kill what you cannot see
The Verbal Hologram

[Bridge: Spoken, John Doe (Kevin Spacey)]
Don't ask me to pity those people. I don't mourn them any more than I do the thousands that died at Sodom and Gomorrah

[Hook: Sample]
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
