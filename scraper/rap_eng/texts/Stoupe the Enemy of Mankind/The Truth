[Verse 1]
Yo, don’t make me add another chapter to your medical records
You wanna disagree a second, get spat on your necklace
And when it comes to rhyming, your flow is common
As the electric slide at a wedding reception
I don’t give a fuck what company you got a contract with
Or them selling niggas they jumping to sign the wack shit
You talk reckless but no one respects it, boy
I’m the reason your wifey don’t press you for sex no more
And I’ve just ignored a cheap shot so roll with your hollering
Your overpriced catalog belongs in the dollar bin
You sensitive nigga, you too feminine dawg
You probably watch porno movies with no women involved
From what I heard you and your fam ain’t feeling women at all
So it’s pink thongs and Coach bags for him and his dawgs
Six-figure bitch nigga this is just the warning shot, popp popp
The next step will be a ten minute brawl

[Hook]
"Mayne, ain’t nothin changed"
"Brothers ain’t gettin it"
"It hurts"
"Your bodily function"
"But we gotta put a nigga to work"
"Already ready ? "
"How can I show ya?"
"I’ll turn out the lights, and some will go bitch"

[Verse 2]
I can spot a coward from across the room acting real hard
Do I believe for a second you packin' steel? Nah
But I still hear 'em lie about the cats they will rob
But a gun shot sound will make you track and field stars
Too much fakin', too much truth concealing
That ain’t Jacob, you bought your jewelry at a booth in dealer’s
Ooh, I’m killin' em with true words, you jerks get buried
Some of you will feel offended, if the skirt fits wear it
Don’t ask me about collaborations, fuck no
For God’s sakes I got a reputation to uphold
This here is the beginning of your ending fam
It’s Supastition and Stoupe, that’s my extended fam
We on a mission for loot, before you see me fail
You’ll see a bitch win a beauty pageant missing a tooth
I'm sick in the booth, I'm fire, even a compulsive liar
Has got to admit this nigga’s the truth

[Hook]
