I lie awake in my bed shaking my head
Fighting off life til the day that I'm dead
Struggling when it come to making some bread
I have mad time but I waste it instead
I can't sleep, the train keep passing me by
An old man asking me why, can't answer his cry
It's too much stress, rest with one open eye
Having flashbacks to that night that I almost died
Don't know how I made it, it was so cold outside
Demonstrating the will of my soul to survive
Still here to tell it, some got to die young
Naturally I had to turn tragedy to triumph
'Cause these days I have make it hard to remember dreams
But I memorized that one time when I was 17
I was locked up and stayed up all night
Thinking 'bout all the things I done wrong my whole life

I can't breathe no more, I can't see no more
I can't sleep no more, I don't dream no more
[2x]

Now I lay me down to sleep
But I wake up 6 feet deep
Trapped trapped trapped trapped.....
