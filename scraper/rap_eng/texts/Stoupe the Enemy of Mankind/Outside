- Meet Me Outside -
- Meet Me Outside In the Road -

Well I got no credit and I got no dough
Noesis gold standard based solely on flows
Rolled up
To the show with the vodeodo
The rhyme folio closed design
Nobody knows
It's fine

It was the coldest of colds
I'm frozen through the opening odes
Trying to cope with the jones inside
Not the swaggering dope
More like
Dagger and cloak
Up and at 'em and smoke
If a road I find

You materialized at nine local time
Put the circle round you like the kosher sign
If its all parve
Catch em' off guard
Gonna Bob Marl'
Spark on the job
Lawd lawd

Back to the bar
Bless for the friends and the enemies
No stress
Testin' on the set with the energy
It's how I let it be
Count it down to get at ease
Later for nostalgia
Now we paint the melody

- And to set it free -
- You must lose control -
- Take my move and save me -
- Meet me in the road -


- Meet me outside -
- Meet me outside in the road -

Well I got no bearing
And I got no sense
I still believe emcees should rep in the flesh
With a desk sequestered headset check hello
Im outside wrecking the worlds tiniest cello

Acapello rocking to the chopping of your aquifer
And bopping to the rhythm of you hopping on whats popular
Gimme gimme is the doctrine that seducted us
Why I need the sticky like the topping on your baclava

Delicious
Not superstitious with the way I pass
Crews ain't fit to hit the eucalyptus faking raps

Though it suit the prisons
It ain't too pernicious:
Proven by the new decisions
Paper motivate em fast

Not a savior or the basis for acquaintance
Too old for flaunting it in faces or on stages
Lay an invitation and I'll gladly oblige
Hey yo, the basement or
The whip or you could meet me outside
