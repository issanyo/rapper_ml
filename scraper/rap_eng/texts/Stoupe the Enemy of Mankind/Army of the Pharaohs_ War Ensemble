[Intro: Captain Benjamin L. Willard in the film Apocalypse Now]
In a war there are many moments for compassion and tender action. There are many moments for ruthless action. What is often called ruthless. What may in many circumstances be only clarity; seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it
Directly, quickly, awake!

[Verse 1: Ikon the Verbal Hologram AKA Vinnie Paz]
I exit out of my sarcophagus, fourth Horseman of the apocalypse
For my esophagus breathes a evil that just demolishes
Abolishes, to the darkness of Mephistopheles
Mental enteral that went through an ancient acropolis
Conquered this, from a fetus to genius
Took DNA from the Shroud of Turin and cloned Jesus
Merciless leaders, the 19th galaxy
Born to a storm on the seas of Gallilee
Battle me and suffer whiplash from my apostles
Leave you in shackles in the castle of Nosferatu
Ikon is hostile and mortals cause contusions
Hologram is known for placing poison in Christians' Communion
Slash, with the actions of ultra-violence
Crucifixions, indiction by Pontius Pilate
I walk naked in the house of David with pride
Force you to bleed just to make sure that you're still alive
Crystallize, we keep it live, y'all can't see me
Banish satanic verses like Ayatollah Khomeini
I break in half, Satan's staff with ancient math
I wait and laugh, create a fuckin' blood bath
What!

[Excerpt: Captain Benjamin L. Willard]
"...I am unconcerned. I am beyond their timid, lying morality..."

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
I bring the gory oratory yes demorally derogatory
Mad expository expedition in your auditory
Categories don't apply
Your mind's eye is blinded by my battle raps
Like cataracts, your habitat is Halifax
Once I run you out your native city
Shea's committee is pretty witty we show no pity
I deflate the second-rate, wack MCs who replicate
Every trace of Esoteric found up in their record crate
I devastate, homosapian metabolism
Like human cataclysms and read them with an anachronism
My precision makes incisions on your acrotism
Battlin's a bad decision leaving you with aphorisms
I whip ass like masochism dominatrix
That's the basics, Hologram brought The Matrix
To fake kids, fifty dead MCs to my credit
Learn from the druid better known as Esoteric

[Hook]
A, A, Army of the Pharaohs

[Verse 3: Virtuoso]
In this the final conflict high powers and commandant's to enlist this
The fluid I spit is viscous, without so much as whispers
And with the swiftness of what you transisted can carry info
A widow's left where your wrist is directly cut by my discus
Forged upon the anvils of Hephaestus
With the hand skills I slam your damn grill
Executin' Greco-Roman holds
Roll in Trojan battle gear, explodin' through the atmosphere
I saddle fear and read cerebral centipedes as evil steeds
The feeble fleed
Holdin' severed rapper's heads toward the sky as the trophies to be viewed by the mischievous eyes of Loki
I hated your verse so I went back in time and waved a dirk at your mother's warm uterus
To kill you before you were born like fried yolks
My ammo splits the trunk of petrified oaks
It's time to die folks
You think that I joke?
I leave your thighs yoked
Your wrists are broken, tied to horses
You quartered, as forces pull you in opposite directions
Dissection of my anatomy, will lead to the unveilin'
Of what had shielded a tiny toddler wieldin'
A giant computer body, which is similar to Robotech
Download direct, from the million megabytes of rhymes that rest on Virtuoso's neck
