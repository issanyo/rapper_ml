[Verse 1]
The sky’s in my eyes
(Flying high like an airplane
Floating through the sun like a spring rain)
You’re the happy when I’m blue

The cold butterflies
(In my belly like an earthquake
Like the rocks ripple on a still lake)
Scared I’m gonna lose

[Chorus]
It's a big nothing, just something that I gotta do
So I'm just asking, what's happening with me and you?

If you wanna be my girl, wanna by my girl, say you wanna be my girl
(Say you wanna be my girl, say you wanna be my girl)
If you wanna be my girl, wanna by my girl, say you wanna be my girl
(Say you wanna be my girl, say you wanna be my girl)

[Verse 2]
The spark in your eye, girl
(Starts the fire like a matchstick
Keep it burning like a habit)
Helps me getting through

The chills from your voice, ooh
(Summer breeze on a hot day
Like some A/C and some Kool-Aid)
Got me feeling new

[Chorus]
It's a big nothing, just something that I gotta do
So I'm just asking, what's happening with me and you?

If you wanna be my girl, wanna by my girl, say you wanna be my girl
(Say you wanna be my girl, say you wanna be my girl)
If you wanna be my girl, wanna by my girl, say you wanna be my girl
(Say you wanna be my girl, say you wanna be my girl)

[Verse 3]
See I would fly a million miles on the worst airline (coach), all around the world
(Just to see your frown turn into a smile)
And I would walk a million more in some three feet snow (ice cold) back around the world
(Show you I'm for real just in case you didn't know so)

[Chorus]
You, if you wanna be my girl, ooh! Aww, baby
If you, if you say you wanna be my girl, ooh!

If you wanna be my girl, wanna by my girl, say you wanna be my girl
(Say you wanna be my girl, say you wanna be my girl)
If you wanna be my girl, wanna by my girl, say you wanna be my girl
(Say you wanna be my girl, say you wanna be my girl)
