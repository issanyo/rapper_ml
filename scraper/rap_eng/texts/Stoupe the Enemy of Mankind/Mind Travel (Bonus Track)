[Intro]

[Verse 1]

Travel on the highways of my mind
To see the secret societies that’s lived throughout time
If you don’t see them you blind
I can't overstand your weak thought process
It’s true I blow trees but I think shit you can’t comprehend
Play the beat I lock it in, make it official
Talk shit I’ll knock your kin, speak the language of my pistol
Red dot aimed at your forehead have you looking like a Hindu
Your God is non-existent so nobody will miss you
Ima heathen that’ll hustle you for breathing
The immaculate bastard, killing rappers it’s the season
Freshmen lists and number one hits don’t mean shit
I remember my teachers telling me I ain’t gon be shit, parents in agreement
Ima bad influence on the youth kids, But the truth is
I don’t do this for you bitch so say my music is a nuisance
I say its art, decapitation is fascinating
So believe me when I say this: my words are razor sharp
I stay in the land of the tyrants, settin flame to the environment
Until you kno my name, and address me as your highness
I’ll cut out your fucking iris have you seeing reality
That fighter mentality will speak to you solemnly
What a tragedy that so many casualties come from my battling
You try and kombat my family and I’ll finish you fatality
Don’t step to this demented kid
Or you’ll be in need of a vest and shit
You’ll get no love like dj’s in the club that let the record skip
So for now I’m fucking lesbians
Having sex wit 10’s again
Kissing her she kiss her friend
Some wrestling we gets it in
I’m the perverted wordsmith
With a dirty mind that gets worse wit time
I’ll take your rhyme and reword it
To sound like bible verses. (Revelations)
Thou shalt not step to me
I’ll inject you wit a dose of lethal reckoning
For its the God of rap appropriately titled
Choose any other God or idol and I’ll turn you suicidal
You lived a long life and I’ll show you the end of your cycle
You’ll die under the hands of Rampage the motherfucking psycho

[Verse 2]

Always been part of the minority
Disrespecting authority
The cause of terror in the modern era
Of storytelling orally
Deep meaning and realness my only currency
I’m here to tell washed up authorities
You boring me. useless like old warranties
Writing wit the pen until I wear it, only thing I cared about
Because I was socially unaware of my whereabouts
I was stuck living in my parents house
Until they kicked me out for popping off at the mouth
My bags was packed before they made a sound
Sick of what simon say
That sticky haze just ease my mind
When I rhyme it help’s me concentrate
Like I’m in a alternate reality in my zone
Nietzsche and string theories
Inhaling the smoke of Henry David Thearou
You know how it goes exclusive neighborhoods keeping us the most segregated
My homie drove to the wrong one when the bullets penetrated
It’s easy feeling lonely but harder to trust
When our own country run by the rich and corrupt
Fucking disgrace, the high prison rate
Mainly blacks and Latins because the pigs discriminate
They could shoot me in my own place and probably get a raise
Nobody safe, even the children get no wages for high profits
Discrimination alive from Clifton walker to Trayvon Martin
The war just starting flip off the government watch
Use your brain kids don’t let Fox stations
Keep you brainwashed tune out of the box
The concept is so basic but the world is so flagrant
Slavery never died it’s just reincarnated
That’s why I spend my days awake neva sober
Brain unstable doctors saying I’m fatal but I’m a soldier
Never run, you know what fuck it this coma is done
