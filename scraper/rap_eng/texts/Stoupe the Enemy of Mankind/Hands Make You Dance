1st Verse
Every time that he starts to speak the people flock around (flock around)
And every time that he plants his feet the sheeple stand their ground (stand their ground)
He shouts louder, gets prouder, gains more power by the day
The soul stick up, more slicker, get rich quicker while you pay

Pre Chorus
So I been looking out these eyes more clearly
Looking into things more in depth
I been praying so the blind can hear me
'Cause everybody destined for death

Chorus
Something making everybody go follow your mans
Something making everybody get close next to him
Something making everybody go follow your mans
So someone gotta call on poppa stomp out all his plans

Post Chorus
But the hands still make you dance x4

2nd Verse
Cripple mind, body, spirit, creep in when your armor's down (your armors down)
Persecute all that disagree & block the common grounds (the common grounds)
The worlds captain, red dragon, the good heart acting comforter
The peace splitter, mind tripper, the truth stripping governor

Pre Chorus
So I been looking out these eyes more clearly
Looking into things more in depth
I been praying so the blind can hear me
'Cause everybody destined for death

Chorus
Something making everybody go follow your mans
Something making everybody get close next to him
Something making everybody go follow your mans
So someone gotta call on poppa stomp out all his plans

Post Chorus
But the hands still make you dance x4

Bridge
Keep moving & keep doing everything that he tell you to
So keep losing, & keep proving its his world you just walking through x2

Post hook- but the hands still make you dance x4
