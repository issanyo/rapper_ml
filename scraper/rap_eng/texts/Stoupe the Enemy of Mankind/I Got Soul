Intro
I met a girl the other day and she said "Wow, Eamon, you're different from the other men I see"
Well a, I said "I'm different 'cause I got soul baby"

Verse 1
I ain't got a fancy car I own
'Cause I done put millions up my nose
I ain't got a uptown lavish flat
I've signed some bad contracts

I ain't got a new watch big ol' chain
And I don't got pilots, private planes
I don't pop bottles with lots of ho's
It ain't 'cause I'm broke but

Chorus 1
I got soul (woo woo) baby, I got soul (ain't nothing wrong with that)
I got soul (woo woo) baby, I got soul (ain't nothing wrong with that)

Verse 2
(Smooth) I never copped Jordans in my life
And I don't rock clothes that's highly priced
Never catch me doing no trendy dance
Old school like my old man

Famous friends don't call me no more
And I ain't on sold out arena tours
I don't got trap beats with mumble raps
But baby I back and

Chorus 2
I got soul (woo woo) baby, I got soul (ain't nothing wrong with that)
I got soul (woo woo) baby, I got soul (ain't nothing wrong with that)

Bridge
(yeah) You can have all the fame and followers
But under all the lights he folds
A man can have a million, billion, trillion, zillion dollars
But he still lack soul
It's something that you just can't teach
It's something that I can't control (aaaah)
(woo) But baby I'm just too cold 'cause
