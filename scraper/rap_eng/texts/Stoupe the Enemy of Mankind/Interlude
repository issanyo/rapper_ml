I'm not use to this. The poetic metaphors, remember your lines

I lay the first brick it forms the foundation for you. All I can imagine became apart of my creation. In my imagination I can still see you. No, I see us. But we're so see through, or maybe I just got the wrong angle I'm not seeing it right. I don't know what I expected, can't believe this is life. I must've missed something important, should have found my way down. Grown now, but I'm still that kid chilling on the playground. Michael Jordan, McFlight confidence. A shark circling, feeling slightly ominous. But a monolithic disguise that doesn't cover my eyes. It's poetry, these metaphors make me alive
