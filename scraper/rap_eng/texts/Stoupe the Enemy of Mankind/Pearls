[Intro]
Hai messo giù che strano effetto che mi fa
Ti perdo ma, ti perdo ma
Sei rimasto ancora qui nell’aria

Maybe it means something
That all I think about are trains
Or could it be that I just needed one thing
To mark the change of night and day

Or maybe my mind is bored
With no passage I can enjoy
These pearls might be strung too tight
All dressed up ready for the ride
I wait under station lights
The train never comes

Maybe I miss the snap and the scream
Of the ocean washing over me
I'm not a part of any one thing
And all of this combined has made me

Early morning rain smell's well worn
Ice of winter has come and gone
These pearls might be strung too tight
All dressed and ready for the ride
I wait under station lights
The train never comes

Between days, between nights
All dressed up and ready for the fight
I'm standing there under station lights
The train never comes
Why should I get all decked out
For the world's biggest let down
Why should I get all decked out
When the train never comes
