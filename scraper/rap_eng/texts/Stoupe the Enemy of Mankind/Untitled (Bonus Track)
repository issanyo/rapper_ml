[Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
The lawnmower-man smashes, through ya skull with battle axes
We whip asses, with Ajanti daggers
And smash this, crushing opposition like we was fascist
Stigmata and four gashes
We bashes, the faggots who can't attack it right
Take they sternum and then turn em into my acolytes
That's the sight of blood, that make a child stop
That's the rise of thugs that keep it wild hot
I hate you, say a prayer to our heavenly father
It's fatal, like a NATO military armada
We hotter, warriors from Atlantis
Couldn't overstand how raw the Hologram is
The mantis, who used the flame rod
You couldn't physically bruise the name God

[Hook- Ikon x2]
We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ

[Jus Allah]
We born builders, as life takes its toll
Legends of the seven, embrace my soul
Transported off the planet, by a supreme force
And told to return on the day of Pentecost
I bisect the ways between Heaven and Earth
And scramble messages from God into your church
Deception, blinds your perception
My reflection outshines the other colors in the spectrum
The brethren, I cease the peace corps
We follow street laws, engaged in Beast Wars
The visionary bombs, with military arms
Aimed at that motherfucker with pitchfork and horns
I shed alchemy throughout the galaxy
To cause fire and ice, like Flames in Calgary
You're trapped in, the core of corruption
Left a fossil, in my path of destruction

*voice sample from Wilfred Owen Poem 'Sonnet'
Thou long black arm
Great gun towering towards Heaven, about to curse;
Reach at that Arrogance which needs thy harm
And beat it down before its sins grow worse

[Hook- Ikon x2]
We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ

[Ikon]
I am the man who lives above the force of good and evil
[Jus Allah]
The man that handed down the powers to give to my people
[Ikon]
Live under laws of bald eagle
[Jus Allah]
There's no tomorrow
[Ikon]
Get trapped with the trenchcoat killers in Colorado
[Jus Allah]
Blazin spark, and feeling certain my days are marked
Live a life that conflicts with the ways I'm taught
[Ikon]
Fuck it, we bring it hardcore, raw and ragged
Ya team must be hidin they balls, like a faggot
[Jus Allah]
I came with the light and gave sight to the sages
Black ink contained to write truth on white pages
[Ikon]
You're sliced faceless
[Jus Allah]
Subjected to a massacre
[Ikon]
Jedi Mind, bombin your moves like John Africa
[Jus Allah]
We laugh at ya
[Ikon]
The devil is the bomber
[Jus Allah]
We unaffected as we protected by God's armor

[Hook- Ikon x2]
We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ
