Dialect unorthodox, official manuscript
Holding abacus rocks on an acid trip
Flavor unusual, taste bud beautiful
The truth is brutal for what it can do to you
Expressing truths who traded smoking it
Buttatone will match the rhythm of the beat and get me up in the zone
Disgusted overlooked, treated like a misfit
I'm all human being, being forced to eat shit
Unappreciated, releasing unapproved unmixed versions of verses that came from one dutch spliff
Creativity is fascinating, unmatched
Starring at that ass elevating
So while you pride yourself at having patience, I'm done waiting
That's what you call a virtue?
I take the beats cash, Tones with stolen shoes mothafucka
I just said that 'cause I can
Wasted every single bar on my one fan
Discrete hidden obsolete description
Rocked to the wisdom of the highest position
To fuck her via rhyme, so I got to hold the chronic
I ain't casting shit kid but my motors are silent
I got the clip near, ready to go the distance
You ain't gotta like it, most you fucks don't even listen
I'm always ?? on my (Stoupe/stoop), Red Martina
Jedi Mind Tricks, Canibus, Dutch ?? ??
