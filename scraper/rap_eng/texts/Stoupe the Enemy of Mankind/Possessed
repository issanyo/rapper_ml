Plagued by the pain it eats psychotic thought
People acting tough only hear a lot of talk
Represent Ol' Yalk, you hear it in my voice
Anything I say is raw, spit lyrics with no choice
From the bottomless depths to the top of this mess
Surrounded with obvious stress taking ominous steps
Draws the end, but I'm already dead
?? ?? took all of my breath, just call me possessed
This world made me crazy, can't even explain it
They watching their views, lately this shit is contagious
Politics and religions fucking with the people
Anything to keep us distracted from the fact that we equal
