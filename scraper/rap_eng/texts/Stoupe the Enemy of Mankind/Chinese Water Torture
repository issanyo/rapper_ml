[Verse 1: Breath of Judah]
I'm on a killing spree
The Cantonese, torturing
Painting a picture with a paintbrush in water color of genies
Holding the key, vitality
It's all you need, if you're a different being
It will be a different color when you bleed
Accurately punctured from needles in you nervous system
Are like the seaman, not water soluble
Because of the attributes of yin yang is dual
When I cut you simultaneously like whang killing you too quickly
If I were to bang, witness thee, I hang you in aqua
Sending electric shocks to open up all your chakras
And when I do, the all set [?]
That will biochemically plant water beads on your brain
While putting salt water on open wounds to have you in pain

Suf- Suf- Suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water

[Verse 2: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Four score, the verbal hologram is verbal war
Chinese water torture into your molecular structure
Ancient scholars wondering where they've seen us
Babylon's hanging gardens and the temple of Artemis
The Hologram crushing you to grains of sand
Lawnmower man, computer generated battles of the unseen hand
Internal bleeding, I bed my seeding with deadly arrows
Fly like sparrows, and get destroyed by the army of the pharaohs
Cyborg, [?] to the womb
Alive where you will see traveling loons from [?]
The ancient palace, the ancient chalice
Mystical like aurora borealis
The palace of pain, y'all [?] kicked up [?] in flame
Half Abel, half Caine, get slain by the verbal flame
Bring forth the sights of Anunnaki Elohim
Image of the 24 lead supreme
[?] ripping out your spleen
Distributing gangrene throughout your team
Lord of the rings brings deadly hologramic dreams
Word up

[Hook]
And my basement's an arrangement of different torture devices
Suf- Suf- Suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water
And my basement's an arrangement of different torture devices
Suf- Suf- Suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water

[Verse 3: Breath of Judah]
You hear the pounding in your head
When I hit the disc gong, the vibrations will start circulation
Of gongs, the body's meridians and everything
That has pores, even obsidian
With the creek moisture and this part of your torture
I'll anoint ya with libations pouring liquids and cleanse
And you'll feel as if you were diving in the ocean
And caught the bends
The elements of the seas to cure all disease
Now tell me if you're unpleased
I'll treat you like a dog and never wash off your fleas
Have you waiting 'till I fill your bowels
With a fish bowl full of frenzying and hungry sea monkeys
Suffering from internal mange
You'll have to consult to the I Ching for change

[Verse 4: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Look in the mirror of the soul to see exactly where the flaws be
Leaving your squad dead on the side of the road like Ennis Cosby
The Hologram eliminating the Earth's population
Matrix field bases of organic manipulation
Ikon dwell in the forest like the Ewoks
We rot for following the prophetic books of Enoch
The treetops hang over your cipher like a ninja
Within the perimeters of the disagreeable sinner

[Hook]
And my basement's an arrangement of different torture devices
Suf- Suf- Suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water
And my basement's an arrangement of different torture devices
Suf- Suf- Suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water

[Outro]
Gently drip single droplet of water upon his forehead
And feel him spoke
