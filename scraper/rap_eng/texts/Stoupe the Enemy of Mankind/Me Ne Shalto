[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, Jedi Mind baby
Check it out, yeah, aight, yeah

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Junkyard Dog, real dirty and mean
Take your face off cousin, I’m a surgery fiend
The type of cat that would rather just be heard than be seen
Hold a gat at the end of it's a burgundy beam
We serving the fiends, with a dose of the uncut
And when there's beef with the heat, they don’t want what
You just waiting for the bomb to reign
Put your body in a hole like Saddam Hussein
So guard your frame when the .45 shells drop
'Cause it’s dark and it’s hot like in Hell, Ahk
Vinnie Paz on some other shit
I like my gat chrome, backbone and a rubber grip
Licking shots at the government
With a knife out at the White House right in front of it
That’s who you fucking with, I’m a sick monster
Slam dance in the motherfucking pit monster

[Hook]
Y'all motherfuckers don't overstand skill

[Break]
This for my man

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Listen I ain't gon’ play no more
Beat a faggot till he ain’t fucking gay no more
We gon’ stay making hits, this is infinite
This is Vinnie Paz world, you just live in it
You just living in my world of doom
Until Jedi Mind decide to build your tomb
I build with goons, build with brother that’s hustling leak
And there ain’t nobody that's rawer than us on the beat
Ain’t nobody rawer than Paz-Man
Cause I can drop a motherfucking bomb on you like the Gap Band
We coming strapped man, it’s a war cousin
Hit you with the Ric Flair figure four cousin
Barry Windham right hand to your jaw cousin
Road Warriors, Animal and Hawk cousin
Take a walk cousin, cause I'm done with you
Or you’ll be looking down the barrel of a gun or two

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I’m coming for your head
Like something from the Dawn of the Dead
Vito Corleone style, horse on a bed
Thoughts on a bed from a hollow tip
Chop off your fucking tongue, make you swallow it
You the type that got, I’mma do Diallo hit
The type to admit you faggot and be proud of it
Turn it down a bit, I can't think daddy
I think I need another motherfucking drink daddy
I think I’ll hit the fucking bar with King Syze
Who’s these motherfuckers dressing in pink guys?
You a retard; claim to be street smart
But you the first one to run when the beat start
You fucking sweetheart, you’re in the wrong game
Beat your head till you dead with a long chain
Jedi Mind Tricks gon’ have a long reign
And the opposite of pleasure is all pain
