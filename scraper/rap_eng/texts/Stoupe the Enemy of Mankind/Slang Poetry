They scarred of my potential, crippled by my capacity
I hear the instrumental and spit words so naturally
A wordsmith, red shift a galaxy
I spit halogen electricity at those that battle me
Born to rap to this beat, define gravity and rise up
Getting so high from the lie I make the sky duck
I'll rap circles around your whole team for 5 bucks
Local show's terrible, I'm telling you why it sucks
'Cause rap is payed or played, they're songs to no crowd
It's on when everyone got bars, but no one's on now
Then hop into the cypher with a stylee at my sold out
Avoiding your pounds with head nods and no doubts
Maybe it's just me but I don't get excited by the critics on my ?? with the same hands they type with
Like the recognition, but that ain't why I write it
When this poetic gift is presented to you stay silent
