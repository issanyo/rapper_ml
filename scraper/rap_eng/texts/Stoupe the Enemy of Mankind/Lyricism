[VERSE 1: MC Stoney]

My lyrical energy cultivating spiritual entities
Mutilating cynical melodies, stimulating like physical therapy
Demonical pedigree generating metaphysical ecstasy
Intoxicate your mind-state every time I'm dropping flows
With my logical, philosophical, metaphorical, musical rituals
Inimical, theological, dialectical, poetical underground Hip Hop General
You skeptical homosexuals need to get off of these testicles
Colder than frozen ventricles up in a Eskimo
Unsympathetic Saber-tooth
Unapologetic knocking pathetic rappers off of they pedestals
Ya'll mannequins ain't man enough to be standing up to my stamina
I'm needing anger management like Adam Sandler
Fifty-caliber mighty like excalibur
Damaging challengers sacrificing all u whack battlers

[VERSE 2: LSD]

Millimeters of reason, reach and redeem your achievements
In hiding fear and depleting, as you continue receding
Into the belly of the beast, I'll eat a heart while it's beating
Then let it's flow of bloodshed drown the ones who deceive him
I rep the region for a reason, y'all recycle like seasons
Dim the lights, check the mic and have a seat while I'm speaking
I took defeat under my wing and passed her out to my haters
Congratulations your inspiration was truly a favor
Like the flavor off the vapor addicted to getting paper
Got a rhythm you can savor, shine and cut like a saber
A rhyme crusader with some crazy ass fans like The Oakland Raiders
Highly motivated solely to fully commit to greater ways
To lay a take deep enough to fuck around and change your day
And y'all just thought I came up in this bitch to play
Elastic mind of matching time with pride and action
I'm imagining that you can understand a crime of passion
Like a bag of matches right by the pilot of leaking gasses
And every one in your family tied to a gasoline soaking mattress
Body's covered up in open gashes
While I flick the ashes off a cigarette and hope it catches
Wired to explosive plastic, coke and acid
Drinking liquor out the bottom of a busted bottle mixed with broken glass
And spit a flow to the open mass
While I'm toking grass and pissing in these bastard's open caskets!

[VERSE 3: Sto-ik The Poet]

Psychologically: I'm merciless, biologically: murderous
My ideologies are carried through you like a surrogate
It's like I'm facin' a bunch of motherfuckin' invertebrates
But one thing that you'll never see inside of me is: nervousness [yup]
I swear it on my life and put it on my family
That, that'll be the day you see me suffer with humanity
You better pray that I don't lose my fuckin' sanity
The gravity of everything lies inside of the tragedies
Somebody tell'em they should cease and desist
My rhymes will always pack a punch, it's like I speak with a fist
Period, now watch the fuckin' pussy bleed from his lips
Delirious, but subconsciously man he knows where he is
Look me in my eyes, I'm quick to put a hole in your soul
Rippin' out ya tongue and laughin' if you think that I won't
So fuck around and find your body with a knife to your throat
Before I terminate your life and disappear in the smoke, oh...
