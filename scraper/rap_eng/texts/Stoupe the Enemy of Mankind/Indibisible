[Verse 1: Canibus]
I transmit images over the distance
Using the inflation premise of 10 to the minus 32 seconds
Back to the Canibus era, my eponym is apparent
Those who hear my efforts gotta give me the merit
Off lyrics alone I'm a legend
But I can't take credit, the English language was not my invention
It's the way I put it together, the incorrect English editor
Can't nobody ever do it better
People forget but the history will remember
I plead guilty to the charge and accepted the sentence
Let the records show I resisted under the pressure
My short but precise endeavor to raise the measure

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Hip-hop forever, that's what I see when I look in the mirror
Regardless of whether I'm not a bestseller
I'm a first class spitter, the literal literature ripper
Painting pictures for intelligent listeners
From any and all dispositions
The fusion of what's written creates a fission called Canibusism
The intellectual division of science and religion
People waste their momentum trying to defend it
All I do it put it to ink then put it to print
See what you think, maybe I should speak to a shrink
I could fix the way they look at the world
They read all these books in a barrel but they can't think for themselves
Self-contained, I'm all balls, belts and brains
Must be strong cause no one ever help Germaine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Observe the whole world's pain and tell me you ain't tired of prayin'
The Catholic faith will never be the same
You could be put in chains 'cause you got a Muslim name
Sent to Guant√°namo Bay and tortured for days
Man, I'd rather buy some land and grow an orchard of grapes
Drink vegetable juice, stay away from steaks and shakes and snakes
These rats in the corporation's is fake
Nobody ever gives you what they already didn't take
Invest and wait, you'll be broke till you break
Man you learn to pick a lock you wanna open a gate
I mimic haters like flight simulators at air bases
Recovered from an inverted spin, now I'm famous
Those who respond to Rip the Jacker with hate
Show poor taste and only exacerbate their fate
MicClub.net, get it right motherfucker
Get it right, get a mic

[Hook]
