You ain't ready for revolution, you so scared of a word
And you slaves to the dollar, they preparing the herd
I'm aware of my worth and convinced in the song
While I'm here on this earth since birth til I'm gone
I ain't worried 'bout the media, any politics
Sulk is to manifest the way I'm living til it's positive
An underground rapper, I ain't trying to be your idol
I ain't trying to be famous, I look slightly homicidal
But I'm a peaceful person stuck in a world of war
Saw a picture on the net of a baby dead on the floor
Looking like he caught a slug from a sniper
In the middle of the street still in a bloody diaper
That's what this planet's come to, we don't even recognize
To busy with TV and PC, desensitized
It's chaos but it seem like it's accepted
World wide web got the people disconnected
Force fed and since you don't believe the propaganda
When they gonna understand war's not the answer
Only brings brief relief to the problems at hand
Following puppets while quoting Obama's "I can"
Give me a foundation, stop building off the lies
William Cooper's dead, they killed him and I know why
They hired Alex Jones to control both sides
But they can't get at Tones, open mind and closed eyes
So high above it I see through the ??
Signed from laws but still heed to the consequence
It's all games, we're really fighting over hunger
Wanting innocent souls, lie lifers by the number
