You've got the most delicate frame
You've got the most delicate ways
When the world comes down
And you know it will
You got that way

Your heart sings behind your ribs
The sleeping giant
Alone in its crib
Somewhere between so along and song
You carry me warm like the wind

Yes the wind is a sad  place to be
Yes it is I am coming to get you down
Pulling you out gently
No matter where you are
Gently
Gently

You can do what you want
You can't do wrong by me
Not by me
Courage bears teeth
Courage bears truth
You carry me warm like the wind

Tell me

Yes the wind is a sad place to be
If it is I am coming to get you out
Pulling you down gently
No matter where you are
Carefully
No matter where you are
Gently
Gently
