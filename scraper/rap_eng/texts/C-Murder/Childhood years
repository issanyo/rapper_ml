Intro: C-murder (talking) with Porsha singing
This is a story about my childhood years
For all my niggas
For my life as a ghetto child
. There's so much pain

Verse 1: ????
I remember as a little kid
Growing up. Many of my friends didn't make it up to bricks
Punished for the shit that they did, it gets so hard to live
Mama cut the same tears, livin' in fears
Wondering if their son died or survived
But mama, I'm cutting the 45
I die, tell mama don't cry
Dry eyes, 'cause how I live. I know to smile
A young misbehaved child, running in the streets wild
Try to make my money, pop
My eyes are getting slim
And my life is getting down, and I feeling like death is near
And I'm hoping that the heaven's here
I cry, 'cause the Lord knows how m! any years I've tried
But this life's a lie. It ain't not a hope unless a nigga die
Lord why!!, Lord why!!

Verse 2: ????
My childhood years was kinda rough because my pops weren't there
I was left to peer. Always pay but no one to share
These hard times, stressin' to sell nickels and dimes
Had to support my family, no one else was puttin' time
Reminiscing about on dead peers troughout the the years
No more tears, my childhood years with scrilla fifth
Who's the maycliff for all this fucking fight to stop a nigga
Just a price I have to pay, nigga
My childhood years

Chorus repeated once: C-Murder (Porsha singing in the background)
My childhood years, got my shit in tears
It's hella scary
I'm trapped, and I don't wanna die in a cemetery
This ghetto ties got me livin' in pain
Lord knows I don't wanna die in vain

Verse 3: C-Murder
My childhood years was spend in cemeteries bearing my peers
Many tears, that I have shaded, for my niggas disappeared
In a bad year. Now with depressed in just memory
Drinking Hennessy. To dry away my misery
Trapped since birth, a ghetto child living in curse
It's getting worse, until I'm covered up in dirt
The pain it hurts
That be the reason why my blast first
'Cause I refuse to be a victim in the black hears
Memories up with child runnin' wild
I couldn't smile, because my motherfuckin' life was foul
A troubled child, stressin' from his childhood years
Heavenly father. Could you please wipe away my tears

Verse 4: Reginelli
I could remember way back, when a! nigga was sick
I just to watch my brother do some dangerous shit
Staying out all night, mama worrying sick
Wondering if he was dead or just play with a bitch
But when I saw this wild nigga came up like I did
When I eat dwellars, when the niggas start to slanging that shit
I tight up on my hustle. Start to paying the bills
Shading tills, 'cause my brother got locked up for three years
After that a nigga start to grabbin' the mic
Write rap, on sheet of paper, making solider shit tight
Three years later, my brother came home from jail
Tellin' me he wrote rap, when he was strapped in a cell
A week later, we was some No limit soliders
Gambino family, for all the readers and rollers
But you can tell a nigga been shading some tears
By the way I live
My childhood years

Chorus repeated once

Outro: C-murder (talking) with Porsha singing

Childhood years
Shading tears
For ! all my dead peers
Hard time strapped in the game
Try to maintain
