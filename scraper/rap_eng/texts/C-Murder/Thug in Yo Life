[Intro: C-Murder]
Every soldier need a thug, and every thug need a soldierette
See me, I'm a tru playa ya heard me

[Chorus: Suga Bear (C-Murder)]
And I don't wanna kiss and hug you
All I really wanna do is love you
Thug girl (You need a thug in your life)
I need a thug girl (You need a thug in your life)
In a little every now and then
No relationships we just friends
Thug girl (You need a thug in your life)
I need a thug girl (You need a thug in your life)

[C-Murder]
You said you lookin for a thug to show you love
Well, baby boo, whats up with you my name is tru
How do you do?
I'm fascinated by the way you look
Your pretty face make me wanna steal your heart if I was a crook
You said you wanna have a little fun
But if you're looking for a man I ain't the one
I see you didn't run
You say you interested in this thug
Well, introduce yourself and you can be a phone call away from ghetto love
No strings attached, take it slow
You say you never met a man like me before
Oh you ain't know, forever grow
No time for games, too many squirrels in my world
Pretending to be a pearl
That's why I need a thug girl

[Chorus]

I'm a tru playa

[Krazy]
You know how we do this here baby
Erotic sex in ya man's bed you know I'm gone freak ya
Sexy you know I love ya but lets keep it a secret
Tell ya girls if ya want you know they can't be trusted
She wanna sex you anyway so she gone get you busted
Somebody snitched now ya man be bootin' me up
Word on the street if he catch me he gone shoot me up
Tell that fool he better chill, I never touched you girl
If he don't I'm gone have to put that chopper in his world
I fantasize of you naked girl I just can't shake it
If I offered you my heart sweetie would you take it
Don't break it, cause that's all I have left with pride
Baby we can rule the world with you at my side, now

[Chorus]
