Verse 1: C-Murder

Christmas in the ghetto just ain't worth shit
Tell Santa Claus he better watch his back
I guess I get the same fuckin thing I got last year
Sittin' in a bird dog drinkin beer
I don't have a job
No food, no fun
But I got the dope
3 keys and a gun
So I tell the fiends to me on the block
Open up shop and start sellin rocks
I'm making big dollars off these motherfuckin fools
If they wanna jack
Then the money's in my shoes
Now here comes a dope fiend begging for a hit
Saying can I please get a 50 $ fix
He showed me the money
Then I went for my stash
Got the dope fiend's a 50 dollar bag
The man said "Freeze ! " and my mouth just dropped
The stupid ass nigga was an undercover cop
Yea I was mad
But I didn't want to run
Staring me in the face was a big black gun
Now it's Christmas Eve and I'm locked behind bars
Sitting in a cell looking up at the stars
Reminiscin about my kids with tears in my eyes
Thinkin to myself I just want to die
Livin in a house with no food, no heat
It may be cold but hell is the street
Cause the place I'm from Santa don't leave gifts
In my house Santa only shop lifts
Holidays in the hood ain't no motherfucking joke
When people all around you is starving and broke
Cause if you're black and poor , it's hell
You only hear gunshots, you never hear bells
So if you got a way out then go
Cause it ain't no fun with Christmas in the ghetto...

Chorus :
It's a Christmas in the ghetto
Fa la la la la  la la la la la
It's a Christmas in the ghetto
Fa la la la la la la la
Dealers bakin, fiends are waitin
Fa la la la la la la la la la
It's Christmas in the ghetto
Fa la la la la la la la


Verse 2 : Master P

This Christmas ain't it
I didn't hit a lick
Waiting on Santa is like waiting on a trick
Now I'm going to the mall to get the fresh gear
I'm from the projects, I've never seen a reindear
Stick em up, stick em up, boom !
Now you're doomed
I guess my present will be you
Now you know that I'm jackin
N I ain't payin for the gas cause you know I ain't actin
I'm the grinch cause you know that I don't play
Some say , "How can you do this on a holiday ?"
Cause when I look I see reflections of me
Kids in the ghetto never had a christmas tree
Hand down clothes for the new year
The rich drink champagne, the poor drink beer
No christmas cards, just a letters and a "rent late"
My little brother wanted a bike, he got skates
Now I don't give a damn
Forget Uncle Sam
I thank God for the turkey
Last year we had spam
Looked out the window, what do I see ?
Dope dealers running from the police
Welfare cuts was the last line
Sent many people to the God damn soup lines
Homeless people with no shoes on they feet
In and out of cans trying to find something to eat
I reminisce to the people that ain't here
Hopin to have a better fucking new year
Dope fiends selling TV's and sweaters bro
But I ain't trippin cause it's Christmas in the ghetto
