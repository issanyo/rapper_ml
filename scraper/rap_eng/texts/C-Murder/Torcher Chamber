[C-Murder]
I ain't scared to die
So welcome to my muthafuckin torcher chamber
Disrespect my crew, bitch you in danger
C-Murder who I be, TRU is my click
My minds on killin but in the process T'm gettin rich
Ain't got no time for no niggas that be stuntin
Cause my mind gone
I'm workin with a little bit of nothin
Niggas wanna know,"Why they call you C-Murder?"
Cause I don did more shit the average nigga never heard of
Since I lost my brother
I'm always ready to shoot up
They say I went crazy ever since I tooed up
They say I went to jail I got that TRU up on my stomach
On my back and my arm, cause niggas ain't funny
Cause I'm No Limit for life
A motherfuckin soldier
This will be your last dance
I tried I told ya
Flippin quarters to ones
And ounces to quarter keys
[cause niggas from the south stack G's]
1-8-7 always on my mind, to you playa haters
Fuck y'all, No Limit ain't hard to find
Like I said before, you fools can't get me
A lot of niggas scared to stand in the same room wit me
So don't fuck wit me unless you trying your fuckin wig split
C-Murder don't take no bullshit

Chorus:  I ain't scared to die
	 so welcome to my chamber
	 kill em all [Boom]
	 your life is in danger
	 (4x)

[C-Murder]
They label me an outkast
So an outkast what the fuck I be
Specialize in homicides
And slangin "D"
Cause every muthafucking thing I do, is drug related
Nigga what you ain't got my money
I sure hate it
Be get that tey
It's time to pull a hard card
I'm like the devil, shootin niggas make my dick hard
Ridin on his set
I'ma catch him slippin
C-Murder like to see a nigga blood drippin
Man make the money
But money don't make the man
Rest in peace nigga
This will be your last dance
Cause fuckin wit my crew
Is like pissin on my set
I man don't whoop ass
The poke gon break your neck
And if that don't stop ya
Serv gon rock ya
"P" gon pop ya
And silkk gon shock ya
Cause once nigga, always a nigga
Don't get no harder than me
Cause when I kill ya, they won't find ya
So bitch don't fuck wit "C"
Nigga break yourself
You heard what I said
Two attempts on my life
Muthafuckas want me dead
But I ain't paranoid cause I can't be stopped
Sittin on half a key
And I'm  still slangin rocks
Cause I'm from the projects,where murder rates rise
But I'm still gettin paid
Cause I ain't scared to die, slangin 24-7
My life is in danger
Welcome to the torcher chamber

Chorus: (4x)
