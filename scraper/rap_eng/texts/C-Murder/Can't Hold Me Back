[Intro: C-Murder]
Say Magic, remember that nigga QB from uhh Life or Death
That commercial we did for a nigga
First appearence as a No Limit Soldier
But it's number two nigga check it out

[Chorus 2X]
You can't hold me back
Only real niggas feel this
Nigga feel this
Bitch niggas can't feel this
Feel this

[QB]
This for the niggas under estimated, mad style, mad created
Fuck all them niggas that playa haters
Send out dippin' spirit shit, what's wrong, I hearin' shit
When I jump on the song, it's straight lyrics bitch
My first appearence was on Life or Death
It's hard to mantain in this game but I still caught this much respect
I waiting a long line, no with no wit'
I didn't pick up no hands got me some ki's and I made a hit
Y'all niggas mad cause i'm nation wide
You besta realize I have a style
Nigga don't be surprised
There's not no party
I'm coming with dope shit regardless
Coming with a weak hit nigga hardly
And when you rich bitch niggas talk
And when you broke bitches yap
A automatic go off full track
A future pay nigga, a made nigga
Not a day nigga, a fair nigga, fair nigga

Chorus 2X

[C-Murder]

That shit comin' out soon
No Limit family, ??? motherfucker
