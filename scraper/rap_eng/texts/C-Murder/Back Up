Status too lifted
Talented and gifted
You tossed it, I pitch it
A hog in the dog
Ball, fall and ball
I touch all of y'all
Duck off in the fog
Sippin', a lil' tipsy, like Nipsy
Fortune Teller said it look bad
She was a Gypsy
Mean like Feind
A gangsta, Nawha mean?

Verse 2:
Watch me

Treat em' like a doubie
Rollit and spin it fast
Just like a Oozie
Ain't gone let it Blues me
Let nothin' get to me
Come back hard and star in my own Movie
If ya think ya know me Man
You don't know me
I done seen it all, And done it all
Ain't nothin' you can show me
I roll with high rollers
And Purser Snatcha's
Cut Boys, homie that still cause throwbacka's
B.G. skeeza's that count cheese and hold Keys
Screamin' C, Please let me see ya enemies

Verse 3:
Ridin' down the wrong way
Down a one way on a Sunday
With a A.K., with the Bass Hay(Hey!)
Wildin' Out, Wildin' Out boy
With a pocket full of stones
I'm in the zone
Do the Gangsta Walk(O.K)
Do the Gangsta Bounce(Alright)

Mean Mug that fool
Now show ya Gold's boy
