[Intro]
Co sign let's show these boyz how we rock (straight Gutter)

[Verse One]
I am deep in the game, I weight more than six feet (for real)
I am straight street ain't nothing fake about me
From the pen,to the hood to the studio booth
One hundred percent Tru I only speak the truth, my G code is impeccable
I am Capo at this, check my tat

We in the Lac chocking, when I am hurting I push those ghetto tokens
One thousand four grams, we call them hood chickens
Watch me pluck them feather imbombit nigga, fuck the weather 187 on a slick
Then it's on (we run this) fuck the House of Blues
Wodee move I anit got nothing to loose
Bop ya head if you a gangster (Bop ya head if you a gangster)

Because I am killing everything in site close your curtain tights
It's gonna be a long night
Yeah it's murder

[Chorus]
