Tru niggas gonna ride (we gonna ride or die)

Verse 1: (C-Murder)

Hit em' up, hit em' up, nigga i fuck them hoes
I smoke weed, make you bleed and it's time to go
And I walk with the league that's what gangstas do
And say where them dollars at? like gansta boo
And skee mask on the muthafucken dash my nigga
Cause if you see me that's yo' muthafuckin' ass my nigga
And Mr. Magic got that chopper for yo' ass my nigga
Take off my mask, so you can see my laugh my nigga
I represent that 3 nigga, so fuck what you claim
New Orleans is the place where I slang my caine
Red rum, red rum nigga (nigga) look who tried to harm me
I told you muthafuckas no limit is the army (What?) (What?)
If I die, i'll never cry, see the hate in my eye
It's time to ride, muthafucka bye (bye) bye (bye)
I told you muthafuckas dont fuck with TRU
It was a dumb move nigga, now I'm fuckin wit you, biotch

Verse 2: (Magic)

They got to kill me to get to you
Before they leave, i'ma have them bitches black and blue, believe that
Muthafucka you ain't heard of us?
TRU til' i die, man we muthafuckin' murderous
]From the place where them hoes crazy, niggas shady
But I maintain, cause no one could ever fade me

If you dont think so, then you could get the fuck fuck
I'm here to get you riders, so nigga what what
And i ain't stopin' til we tear the fuckin' club up
So where my niggas at? actin' fuckin' fool
And where the bitches at? show em' that bithces rule

Smoke your herb nigga and get your drink on
You gave the party, everybody got their dance on
