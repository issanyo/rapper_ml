[Verse One: C-Murder]
Yeah it's hard to be us
We pray to god so in god we trust
We must cease enough
Cuz its unjust
Can't touch my green dubs
[?] cold heart in me
I see the boys in the making in my building
Children no pop guns yep they got real ones
Nobody feel them but me yeah I really feel them
That's why I'm still in the jets and I got millions
We love souls
Hate it for hell  the cross roads
Genocide I don't care if I die nigga my heart froze
I smoke dose I'm killing myself with the same Glock
I can't stop I got that thang under my tank top
So I roam like Trayvon to clip my hair
I drank and a beer and shit and tear plus my momma said
Well you gon' die soon
So I look up to the moon
And say fuck it with the middle finger I'm a goon

[Hook x2: C-Murder]
Nowadays it's hard to be black
Gotta watch my back they see me running and packed cause nowadays it's hard to be black

[Verse Two: Boosie Badazz]
It's hard to be black and even harder
When your money flowing like water
Some won't be a thug
So son won't be his father
Judge he turned his nose up, sinners is bad
Life with no parole, how they sell us is black
9 times out of 10, we killing our own kind
Liquor stores on every corner to kill us in due time
I ain't lying my race got no peace
Uh, shoot me in the back but run from the police
It's so hard being me- a successful nigga
Got these devils pissed off at my complexion nigga
Cause I'm black seem like it's so hard to get high
Cause I'm black seem like it's easier to get fired
Cause I'm black seem like it's easier to get time
Same charge, white boy- 5
Me, my boy- 99
Obama ain't lying you made it hard for a nigga
Ain't a black nigga with power
They trying to slaughter a nigga
It's hard

[Hook x2]

[Verse Three: Snoop Dogg]
You see the system was designed to keep us all down
That's why it's up to me to never let them turn it around
Burning it down
My sound go cray through it
Put a real team to it
Don't dream, do it
See, we got to be a little more careful
It's getting unbearable
This shit is so terrible
Now take a look in the mirror
It seems like you can't see what I see
So let me make it more clearer
It's hard being black
Give us all that fame, then you take it right back
Now how we 'posed to act
Now we can't work, can't eat like that
These are rules of the game
They build you up and knock you down
And leave you full of ashame
Materialistic
Gravy and Bisquick
When you're black
It's a fact
Living life is optimistic
