[Verse 1: C-Murder]
Sometimes I think the Lord is testing me
Don't want to go to jail, I'm tired of getting arrested G
I know I'm sinning when I'm sell crack
But to a young nigga like me, a G ain't no turning back
Trying to settle down is hopeless
With a nagging old lady and a baby I can't cope with it
A chance is something that I never had
I'm standing on this corner, I got my rocks up in a skittles bag
Can't make a move without my boy
I wear a bulletproof vest and watch my back because I'm paranoid
You know the ghetto is a trap
I'm not 2Pac but these jealous niggas got me strapped
Raised like a criminal and born a bastard
Visions of a jail or a grave, a closed clasket
Reminizing about my murder friends
But I'm proud of selling drugs, supplying my family with these dividends
My nose bad nigga like a rock star
Tired of swallowing dope everytime I see a cop car
Can't leave this spot 'til all my fuckin' crack gone
Six rocks never asked the Lord to let me make it home
Cause I'm a nigga on the run
If you talk that shit, I'm gon' have to get my damn gun
Cause I can't take no chances
Either me or you going to die, I guess that will be your last dance

[Chorus: Master P]
Your 187 dance, 187 dance
This will be your last dance
187 dance, 187 dance
Fool this will be your last dance
Last call for alcohol
I mean blood's spill on the wall
Last call for alcohol
I mean blood's spill on the wall

[Verse 2: Master P & Mia X]
Blood on my palms and I pack a Glock
For these suckers and bitches tryin to bet me on my fuckin rock spot
But Mia X got your back P
Cause ain't no bitch nor they kinfolks ever gon' faze me
And if you step to us killers then you dead
Cause I sleep with a HK, Tre-8 and this infrared
Another broad ass nigga on this back
Then if it is on your mind we got this second line in for you
In for you
What about you and you
Don't fuck with my crew 'cause I'll do y'all too
Bust caps on whoever
Whenever, however, whereever
So the crowd better start ducking
Cause these No Limit TRU Soldiers still ain't finish fuckin busting
Won't leave no witnesses to talk about it
Mr. Serv-On got life insurance and I'm bout it bout it
Now don't talk about the way we do this
And bitches think they prepared to do this, prepare to eat some bullets
So come dance with the devil with the gold teeth
Ain't no butterflying on the floor but may you rest in peace

[Chorus: Master P]
Your 187 dance, 187 dance
This will be your last dance
187 dance, 187 dance
Fool this will be your last dance
Last call for alcohol
I mean blood's spill on the wall
Last call for alcohol
I mean blood's spill on the wall

[Verse 3: C-Murder]
I'm waking up in cold sweats, I just realized
It wasn't a dream, I shot that fool in the drive by
Another victim of the dope game
That nigga tried to rob me off my heroin and cocaine
A lot of pride, a lot of heart, so how you figure
My rep was on the line, of course I had to kill that nigga
Crepped up on him playing basketball
Rolled down the window and I shot that bitch with my sawed off
I'm kind of crazy you can't get me
A lot of niggas scared to stand in the same room with me
I'm bout the dope pushing money bro
Just got out of jail and already back slanging dope
My daddy wasn't there for me G
And my mom left me in the house abandoned at the age of three
So don't ask me why I'm heartless son
Cause I was raised by some killers, so I guess I gots to be one
I'm down for whatever
Murder, selling drugs, and robbery in any kind of weather
My girl say I won't live long
I'm sick because I idolize Scarface and Al Kapone
Won't none of these niggas don't understand me
Master P, King George, and Silkk and Cali G
So don't fuck with TRU man
And if you do, this will be your last dance

[Chorus: Master P]
Your 187 dance, 187 dance
This will be your last dance
187 dance, 187 dance
Fool this will be your last
