Fuck wit my shit, TRU Global for life nigga

[C-Murder]

This goes out to that bitch nigga 2 Chainz
You can never be me cause you too lame
I'll pop you in the chest and make two stainz
And if I catch you a vest then my next aim

Hey man a real nigga tried to warn ya

[C-Murder]
2 Chainz boy you a pussy ass nigga
Ol fake ass nigga tryna be a TRU nigga
Boy you're reppin' my shit nigga actin' like a bitch
Now you gotta get fucked by this Calliope click
With no rubber no grease no fuckin' police
In the streets I'm a creep I'll put your ass to sleep
I done peeped at ya dawg I done hollered for your ford
Made a phone call and all y'all was actin' like broads
I swear to god if I see you I might lose my religion
You ain't never been in the kitchen cookin' up chickens
Prolly be a stool pigeon for the cops if you caught a misdemeanor
Ain't never had a scale or a triple beamer
And no bail no arrest no bulletproof vest
No fake piss tryna pass law test

Got a lot of shit I care for but this TRU shit nigga I die for it
Live life like the movies I ain't talkin' Tri Star

One thing I will never be two words bitch nigga
One thing though I gotta be two words rich nigga
