[Hook]
Ohhhh
It's life or death in my town
And I'm standin' on deadly ground
I just wanna live my life
All by myself...

[C-Murder]

Life is full of debt
And life is full of cnflict
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick
Society today is all twisted
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin'
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies
Cuz death is a disease to all my TRU g'z
The can't shake it
They can't seem to break the cycle
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal
Ralph Sten said money...runs the country
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya
I done see mothers turn on they own kids
Money make brothers turn on one another
Even make each other split the other's wig
Animosity
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back
Life or Death
Cuz ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath

[Hook x2]

[C-Murder]

I'm already dead
So can't nobody kill me
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me
My pain brings anger to a total stranger
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger
I just wanna be surrounded by somebody that luv me
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in
In my days rappers die
So I take it as a message
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings
Tell Em' I'mma changed man, but they don't hear me
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me
Let the past be the past
I'm investin' in the future
Watch the ones that swallow most ya
And the ones that'll do ya
My advice to the world
Maintain your sanity
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil thoughts cuz there's gotta
Be another way
Life or Death?

See me?
I trust nobody
Money is the rule to all evil
Better watch yourself boo
