Represent No Limit

Chorus
[Mo B. Dick]
It's alright
[C-Murder]
It's alright, It's alright x6

[Mo B. Dick]
I know deep in your mind
You keep thinkin that i'm playin around
Just because I hang with my homies
And you know that we be puttin it down
We be hangin at the club
And I know them hoes be showin me love
Girl believe me I'll always be true
Cause I'm givin all my lovin to you

[Mo B. Dick/C-Murder]
Chorus x6

[Mo B. Dick]
Girl you know you be my one and only girl
And i'll take you to any place in the fuckin world
But you know it's still that you ride in my Lac
While I'm on these fuckin streets makin stone cold cash
Remember I'm the one that bought your first gun
Taught you how to be a soldier, told ya never run
Told you how to cook, told you how to work a scale
And when I went to jail you got me out on bail

[C-Murder]
My poppa always told me we would be together
But I never thought that we would make it through the bad weather
Spent time in jail, disagreed but you was there for me
And fuck what them haters say cause girl I know you care for me
I'm livin like a thug, on the edge, but I'm comin
Doin shows overseas and I'm constantly runnin
You tell me my baby girl don't know who her daddy is
It's cool cause on the grind I'm hustlin, providing for my kids
And when I'm home ain't no limit to the love that you give me
And when I say I love you, girl I make sure you hear me
I got your name tatted on my chest so you know it's real
And Mo B. Dick's the same way, I can't explain how a nigga feel
That's why when I'm with ya, never hit ya, and I miss ya
Wanna be with ya, can't do without your picture, and thinkin bout comin to
Get ya
Cause it's cool when we fight I know you right
But later on that night, fa sho, we goin make it alright

It's alright
For all my No Limit soldiers out there
With thier No Limit soldierettes on they team
That true love, stick with it ya know what I'm sayin?
Fuck a plan B cause plan A is alright
Keep it real

[Mo B. Dick]
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
