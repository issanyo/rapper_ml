[Master P]
Can't no one out side infiltrate this no limit organization
So prepare yourself prepare for a battle

[Chorus 2x]
Real niggas going to ride playa haters going to die because after
Dollars and cents only the strong survive

[C-Murder]
In gats we trust no limit niggas going to bust
If you ride with me you gots to die with me
Put your rags in the air here comes the brigade
I sold dope on the block cause true niggas get paid
Army fitues with my boots and my gat
Luitentant of a bunch of niggas
Paid and strapped we got we got bitches and blunta
We got weed and money representant them killaz
And them haters be running i got bitch niggas
Anticipating my deck scared to show they face
Cause they scared rap huh
My money to big for them pigs to jock me
We ghetto millionares so them feds going to watch me
Paper chasing for green ain't no punks on my team
I live the life of a thug fo fill'in my dream
Fake niggas going to crumble at the site of my nine
No limit soldier don't fall off real niggas going to ride

[Chorus 2x]

[Master P]
Oh lord can you feel me
Or tell me why my lil' brother Kevin Miller
Had to die and i still hear
Gun shots when i sleep so i'm sayin
Fuck the world and the police
Incarcerated by the ghetto so we trapped
That's why broke niggas in the hood bust caps
Nigga said gangsters make good politicians
And that is why we stay strong black and independant
So the world is like fuck a viatnam
I wish i was the president i could send the bomb
Penaitentary's stay packed now they filing forms
For mexicans and blacks ugh

[Chorus 4x]

[Master P]
Ugh only the motherfucking strong surive
C-Murder Master P eternity nigga
Whats up silkk
