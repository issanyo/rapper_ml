I'm on the block tryin ta make some change I'm tired of being broke
So I'mma get my money right and smoke some weed and coke
I couldn't concentrate in school with the problems I had
When my brother went to jail is when I took the wrong path
That's when I had to step up and be the man ta make it right
Eat and sleep all day and hustle, hustle all night
If anybody need me well they can catch me be on the block
In all black with a Glock and a mouth full of rocks
Muthafuckin cop straight fillin still totin Glocks
I'm on the block posted up chillin by the barbershop
I told my nigga make the holla if them people pull up
So I can get the fuck cuz I ain't tryin to get that dig look
(I dig up in y'all like Min Yawl
Fuck around and get ya head cracked
Playing with this tru dawg so back up off me lil' daddy
Before ya piss me off
Carry max, gauges, choppers, and double barrel sawed-off
We ain't come ta have stuff, we came ta bust heads
Burn houses to the pavement if we feel we gettin
Played, now everyday
Hobbies is load and bust and knock a nigga leg off
If a bitch say somethin, now who be the rawest nigga
T-R-U the most dangerous
Just load'em up it ain't no thang ta us
We maxing up a coming ta get cha
Oh fake ass niggas gonna make us split cha
On the block with the rocks getting richa, the picture)
