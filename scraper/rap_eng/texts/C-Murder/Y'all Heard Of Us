[Chorus 1:]
Now all ya’ll didn’t heard of me
Now I'm C-Murder
I dine things y’all ain’t never heard of
Now I’m a fool boy, you call me a fool it’s on
I’m willing to die for mine, I’m willing to die for mine

[Verse 1:]
Y’all wanna mess with this hot boy
Test me with that top, you get stop boy
On the spot, money busting out my socks boy
It’s hot and now these cops on my jock boy
I breaks bread with these baseheads
I show some love until they slip and trip son
It’s bigger than thugs
Wanna label me a triller
Still don’t push me
Life is hard
I’m tryna fill my own graveyard, the 3rd ward volunteers
Told me be cool, you know Imma fool
Messing with real niggas can get your head bust
Me and my homie we about that papers
Is money we after
Straight money makers
Hood boys can never be no fakers
I spit that gangsta rap forget that hip-hop
I bought them gangsta ass beats that make your head bop
Then make that iron cock and then show stops
Cause it’s money page 7
Cause I don’t give a
But they all heard me

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2:]
If you don’t know me
Ask somebody, you know
And I bet they know
This lil hustler quick to draw down
And split ya or cut ya throat
This lil hustler quick to handle his business
And quick to creep
This lil hustler ain’t bout coppin
No play or squashing no beef
This lil hustler keep a 40 up on him with an extension
This lil hustler will steal you even when ya paying attention
I’m a uptown gangsta, VL gone
When I die bury me with ya bows and T-shirt on
I’m a fool like that
I be walking through the hood
With all my jewelry on
Hustlers wonder how I do it
I’m real, that’s how I could
It gets no realer
I got killas on my team
Just waiting for me to send them
I was raised with gorillas and gangsters
Killers and thugs
That’s for hater
They will touch you up
These choppers sending niggas all true to the game
You hear C or BG
You gotta know them names

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Know all ya’ll didn’t heard of me
I’m B Jizzle
I don’t think you fake boys scared though
I smacked bitches, shot niggas
Sold coke, caught cases
I’ve done it all
I ain’t reppin
I don’t stunt it all

[Chorus 2]

[Outro:]
Throw your hands up [x2]
Free C- Murder, Callio
Throw your hands up
