Chorus
This be the truest shit I ever said
A nigga might wind up dead
With money comes bad times
These days you got to have a strong mind
I grew up as a motherfucken thug
An outkast couldn't do shit but slang drugs
In and out of jail ain't no place to be
I'm not short dog but I just want to be free
Made a lot of money do dirt pulling capers
Don't give a fuck who I hurt
You wonder why a nigga can't sleep man
Because I got the blood of my dead brother on my hand
A true nigga can't rest g
Till these bitch ass get the fuck from around me
You sweat the tank but your not a real soldier
Would you die for this shit "no" P I told ya
Your true to the game but your ain't true to me
Nigga be yourself you can't be me or P
My veins pump no limit blood from day one nigga
Ask Big Ed he put it on his only son
Chorus 2x
I got a few niggas want me dead
Anticipating my death for the shit I said
Huh true soldiers true niggas
Motherfucking blood true love thugg figues
Bitch niggas be plotting on me
Behind close doors niggas hola when you see me
P said if you going to get'em
Get'em shoot first and make sure you hit em
I can't lose another tank dog
One more dead and watch no limit go off
Y'all ain't ready for war
I leave niggas tripping off the shit that they saw
I known for taking niggas out in street murder one
Muthafucker check my rap sheet
I thank P for taking me out the game
Put the mike in my hand and gave me my name
Chorus 2x
