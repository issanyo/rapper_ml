[Intro]
Murda, true, blow, yeah, you hear me?

[Hook]
Trying to rob me, dog, I'ma knock you off
Let that pistol cough, don't test me, foe
I'm a real one dog, a drug dealer, uh
Don't make me steal a cup, just let me peel this [?]

Trying to rob me, dog, I'ma knock you off
Let that pistol cough, don't test me, foe
I'm a real one dog, a drug dealer, uh
Don't make me steal a cup, just let me deal this drug

[Verse 1]
I say y'all motherfuckers ain't ready
I'm riding with them 25 bricks in my Chevy
I tell my nigga "meet me in the east by the levy"
It's heavy, a duffel bag full of get ready
I'm deadly, bust a head, now send me to my celly
I'm in the belly, sometimes I feel like I'm Makaveli
I'm crucified, boy, bleed from my belly
I'm high, homie, put some fee in for that smelly
My only words to the sky is "Lord, let me die"
If I'm survive, I'm gon' ride, can't no nigga slide
Can't no nigga hide, boy I'm crazy, they gon' pay for mine
Waistline, tech nine, I hit waist and spine, boy
Money I'ma make mine, a broke nigga is a coward and I takes mine
They say I'm a product of my project
It's [?], tell a nigga push my top back
But I don't there, your bullets might bounce back
I'm bulletproof, boy, don't die for a ounce of crack
But I don't there, your bullets might bounce back
I'm bulletproof, boy, don't die for a ounce of crack

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Al]
As the Den-block hustler, knows as cocaine corner
Be first-round draft picks, the dope game wants us
There's blood in these streets, a couple homies died on me
But niggas still got heat, so we still grind on 'em
Trying to move a couple zips, watch 'em do a couple flips
Blue steel, rubber grips, bread sales [?] tips
If angels pull triggers, hammers hit pens
Kings hit the cells, then bullets start to spin
The gun it extends, and the barrel throw flames
You should never rob a black boy, we pop that thing
Fuck biz, fuck jackas, fuck these scandalous ass hoes
SK's, AK's, AR's, catacombs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Be]
We done beating the window, flame matching the tempo
Flames dancing [?], with the front-end of my reload
Rigging and frustrated, blow what I come
I don't want to kill you, but I ain't the one
Take you tongue, catch yourself, you can speak at your own grave
Respect a nigga house, and don't get caught in the wrong safe
More or less, nigga, watch what you say
You can kill your morals, like suicidal, but you speak out the day
And I'm [?] stone-throwing snake, they want to break me
Tell 'em old plotting-ass niggas "come and face me"
See [?], or you'll never have to chase me
Put that pistol to your fucking mouth, until you taste it
I'm waist-deep, violent waters, running in ocean wars
We ain't skipping, shots tired, right outside your door
Knock on your window, like, "you gon' rob who?"
Bow-bow-bow! Never land, never do

[Hook]
