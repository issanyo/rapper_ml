[Intro:]
What you looking at nigga? Got it on my mind [2]
What you looking at nigga? This ain’t the time
What you looking at nigga?  What's up rollie?

[Verse 1:]
Boy I see you with your fake rollie
But you trying to get your face fold in, I stay hold in
You deep, I don’t need a clique surrounding me
Out of bounds, I let the haters spit, believe me...shit
Am digging into the graveyard, you love me
You love me now, my fucking haters
Oh praise God he made me with a big heart and big nuts
Nigga what? See I don't give a fuck
Give it up, for what?  I’m the dope man cocaine, and the safe under the floor man
Nobody know man, I’m tired of these whack gigs
We jack fools, criticize how I will smack you
They mobilize, I never die, you never whack trooper
My tattoos for the bullets spitting at you
And am mad, hold up boys
See you ain’t ready for me
See I am demon, screaming, ain’t no heaven for me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I hear the whispers of pussy niggas and silly bitches
Their conversation don’t hold weight
Promise me partners these niggas they speak my name in pain
We ain’t things forever may they remain in pain
To live in silence is asking much, from the street talk
You drop a mile like roller coasters and see-saws
Rolling dices like, but I ain’t one to gamble
Until it’s time for retaliation and lighting candles
I just started in these streets trying to buy me weed
Please believe me that there's a (Unable to transcribe the line; words are not clear)
Nigga trap you, what's up right beside you
Keep it quiet and niggas end up sleep in silence
Can't nothing stop the black boys,we go hard
Hey, your people kissing pictures saying oh lord
Lakewood nigga (Unable to transcribe the line; words are not clear)
When we beat this shit out if niggas we’ll drop this on you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I don’t want to you looking at me keep your eyes closed
Big pistol whipping in the temple, leave it mind whole
Looking at me wrong, get you in a six
A hundred nigga real quick ain’t no fake shit
Mind flow, creep up in your condo
Tie your baby mamma up, put her in a blindfold
Don’t want her looking at me, what you looking at?
Got her looking at me looking at me
Got everybody looking at you
Plus I’m trigger happy, especially when a pussy nigga looking at me wrong
Bitch, cut four seven more shit, seven more bitch
Bitch fuck around we could spoil you
Fuck them other niggas crooked hard bitch
We are you from front to back nigga, they know that not to fuck with that nigga
I came up in the trap nigga with a lot of trap niggas
That's why my money long and I got a gat nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
Ahhh what's happenin nigga, I’m from 37 that’s why I have a new nigga
You better hope and pray that I don’t get mad at you nigga
Because my gages, they got bullets, they go blast on you nigga
Act fast C-Murder,  we ain’t never heard of you
I be with robbers and them killers that's for certain
You can't hang with the boss and ain’t working
Trying to bitch with us, it’s all murder
Big Glock 40 and getting naughty
Rap niggas pussy it’s a lingerie party
I’m going to hit you in the damn you’re so horny
I make the rollie hug my wrist, not too many young niggas thug like this
Streets say they love this shit, ain’t no nigga come up through the hood like this

[Chorus]

[Verse 5:]
Whatever happened to how we played it back in the game
When it was hood, the streets ain’t clacking the same
This fucked up, my so-called Gees back in the lane
I remember right, 4D jack in the lane
The hustle was tight, the snitching took slack in the game
Fears a few pictures put a crack in the frame
Shit went fuck, get whopped, back in the flame
Just hustle a equation for a sack in the day
Nigga forget about your homie when you cup that hack in your hand
Everything was everything before we tracking the fame
Soon as we start tracking the fame go to homie
Blind by then hating fake villains
The case solve, spilling his waste on
To niggas we both fuck, which is crazy how once gangster get on some thug shit am, stuck with
The same old uptown mind-set, came off the poof now that it’s uptown grindage

[Chorus]
