Yo C-Murder, you believe all these people they call me hopeless
[C-Murder]
They say when your hopeless your not expected to do good, be successful
And it's by all means impossible to accomplish any goals

[Lady TRU]
They say I'm hopeless
[Sons of Funk]
They say I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
[Lady TRU]
Like a bullet with a hole in it
[Sons of Funk]
Ohh, like a bullet with a hole in it, oh yeah

[Magic]
Look here, it's not easy I struggled to get in this position
Taking my people out the ghetto was my only mission
I was jacking and strong arming accomplished i done changed
Making money living good I'm out of the game
See as I refused to see good in my accomplishments
All I ever get is dirty looks, never compliments
I figure jealousy, wishing that yall could be me
Cause I'm living larger then life at the age of twentythree (ha ha)
Alot of pessimistic people is speaking about my lifestyle
So when I enter the center I look for the smiles
Many expected me to go down the tubes
Now the same people wishing that they could be in my shoes
But I'm the one they call hopeless
Lord forgive em for thinking that I was worthless
I forgive and forget
And I learn from every life experience
I hope yall feel every word cause this is real it gets
They call me hopeless

[Lady TRU]
They say I'm hopeless
[Sons of Funk]
They say I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
[Lady TRU]
Like a bullet with a hole in it
[Sons of Funk]
Like a bullet with a hole in it, bullet with a hole in it, oh
[Lady TRU]
They say I'm worthless
[Sons of Funk]
They say I'm worthless, worthless, worthless
[Lady TRU]
And I'm up to my head in it
[Sons of Funk]
And I'm up to my head in it, up to my head in it, oh

[C-Murder]
They said I'm hopeless and I never make it
They doubt it, call me an outcast because I'm bout it
Now why you wanna label me and say I'm a thug
I never said I wasn't because this ghetto is in my blood
But I maintain through poverty and tears
My only wish was that I make it to see another year
I left my dreams up in the penn, feel my constant struggle
And one man against a nation, damn I miss my brother
I walk a path to a dead end cause I'm lonely
A childhood full of rainy days kept me homeless
I always wondered was I cursed
Since birth I felt I never had a fair chance in life on this wreched earth
My lonely memories of the past, they got me thinking
I don't wanna see the future, but die in vain
I ask the Lord will he forgive me
Before I leave this world I wanna live a better life because I'm hopeless

[Lady TRU]
They say I'm hopeless
[Sons of Funk]
They say I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
[Lady TRU]
Like a bullet with a hole in it
[Sons of Funk]
Like a bullet with a hole in it, bullet with a hole in it, oh
[Lady TRU]
They say I'm worthless
[Sons of Funk]
They say I'm worthless, worthless, worthless
[Lady TRU]
And I'm up to my head in it
[Sons of Funk]
I'm up to my head in it, yeah
[Lady TRU]
They say It's hopeless
[Sons of Funk]
They say It's hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
[Lady TRU]
For me to make it out the ghetto now
[Sons of Funk]
For me to make it out the ghetto
[Lady TRU]
They say I'm struggling
[Sons of Funk]
They say I'm struggling, yeah
[Lady TRU]
Like a heart with no love in it
[Sons of Funk]
Like a heart with no love, heart with no love
