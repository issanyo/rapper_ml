[Silkk the Shocker]
Some dudes think it's bout rap, look it's bigger than that
The real be up front, you fake dudes get in the back
We got guns and believe me you can get it from that
Gotta lot of money and mostly I ain't get it from rap
You think it's a game cause we ain't jacked in a while
I bust caps in the Y, funny that's why we crackin' a smile
Glad to shut chu' up, cause that's too loud
Don't mess with that file cause that's a while
Still roll through the hood, Bentley with the top off
Feel me, I'm not gon' stop so you can hop on
Man we got bullets that skip playas and hit haters
Slikk and C, No Limit known to get paper

[Hook]

[C-Murder]
