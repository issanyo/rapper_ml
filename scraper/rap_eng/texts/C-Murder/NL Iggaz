Pull out the Porsh chicks run to the car
Blow my smoke to the sky blazin' dutches cigars
I got the street in my veins my block runs thru my blood
Plead guilty to tha charges when I'm facin' the judge
Fuck it I'll do the sentence lift weights & read books
Make me a millionaire in jail wit a mill on my books
Only understand crooks ya'll niggas is suckers
I'm in a booth waitin' for a CEO to front us
I got the hood relyin' on me not to mention myself
So if the drug game dead I can rely on my wealth
Nine outta ten niggas is haters I'm the other one
Like startin' fires that blazes & stackin' my funds

Uh hu I bet ya'll love the way I flips em' out
Funny guy hu now watch how these clips come out
I done took it where ya'll can't go now how bout that
I done turned these straight up niggas into stumblin' cats
An they mad at me cause they say I spit it to rough
An throw it at you like a chick who don't get it enough
What is it X-ray vision the way I see thru this cats
That's why I roll wit thugs who love the squeeze them mac's
Remember back til' when we hid them stacks in alley ways
Now we keep that dough comin' & goin' like holiday's

[Chorus]
