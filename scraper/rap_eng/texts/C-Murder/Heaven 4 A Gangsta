[Chorus]
Is there a heaven for a gangsta gangsta gangsta ughh 2x
Is there a heaven for a gangsta

[Master P]

Grew up in the ghetto, raised by a killa
TRU across my stomach
Your neighborhood thug nigga
Trying to make it, out this fucked up environment
Where niggas die trying to make a dollar out of 15 cent
The ghetto got me crazy
I smell daisies
But I can't die tonight my ol' lady pregnant with a baby
2Pac said there's a heaven for a G
But I wonder if there's a resting place for killas and gangstas like me
Been fucked up for most my life
Done sold my soul to the devil
I hope I die in my sleep but I know it's gonna be a 187
Ain't no turnin' back I'm strapped with 2 chrome gats
I see death round the corner
My time to go I'm ready black
Cause I'm a soldier, gone off that douja
Ain't no crying at my funeral I lived life to the fullest, a high roller
So when I die, put me in a pine box
Bury me like a G, 2 Glocks, and a fuckin' bag of rocks
And open up clouds for this stranger
Before you take me lord, tell me!

[Chorus]
[Silkk The Shocker]

Just a young nigga, addicted to fast cars, fast money, and fast bitches
Got me blasting til it's the motha fuckin' last nigga
It's gone be hard, tryin' to get into heaven, cause my life is on some money
All I see is 211's and 187's, sell a nigga never
So livin' gangstafied, __ and bangin'
You know, just imagin' niggas be actin' bad up there
If they had a heaven for a gangsta
Block parties for days til we get tired, free sex like the sixties
Nigga drinkin' up on some forties, nigga puffin' up on some swishers
Dice game every hour
For the gangstas money and power
Rewards for niggas that's bout it
Preacher time for busters and cowards
Cause every nigga I know on the block
Will be livin' in mansion and ridin' old school
Al Capone will be the fuckin' president
Everything I ride would be on some gold shoes
And if there's a heaven for a gangsta I can't wait
For Pac and E to have some bitches and chronic at the gate

[Chorus]
[C-Murder]

Is there a heaven for a motha fuckin' gangsta ass nigga like me (Fuck no!) I doubt it
Cause niggas like me down south (new orleans) stay bout it
Swamp niggas
Tru soldiers
Fill your head with lead
I ain't scared to die I'll smoke your ass like douja
Retaliation is a must so I bust
Your ass be on the run I can't keep bullets up in my fucking gun
They ask me why am I so sick
It's cuz of my click
Full of murders and robbers, rehabilitated convicts
Rest in peace to all my motha fuckin' dead niggas that took a stand
God forgive me but I know I'm going to hell man
I walk the streets with my converse, khakis, and my chrome gat
Pockets full of drug money and crack, heroin
Will I ever see the man upstairs I know my chance is slim
Cause God don't want no killas standin' next to him
So I'm a hustle, and sell my D (dopeman)
But I wonder is there a heaven for a gangsta nigga like me

[Chorus x4]
