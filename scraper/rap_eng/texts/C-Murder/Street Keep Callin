[Hook x2: Dez and Monica]
Every time I try to leave this game
These streets keep on calling me (streets just keep calling me)
Just keep on calling me (just keep on calling me)

[Verse 1]
Now this ghetto got me crazy and these streets got me trapped
Many times I tried to leave but this game keep pulling me back
In a circle full of crime bout to lose my mind
Shit I wanna make a change but I just keep wasting my time
Ain't no real future selling dope only few make it out
For a ghetto nigga like me got too many golds in my mouth
I can't get a job ain't nobody gonna hire a thug
And my rap sheet consists of 187 and drugs
And going in and outta jail everybody say I'm a fool
But even the President make mistakes, shit I ain't perfect dude
I gotta do something ain't nobody gonna give me nothing
Gotta mouth to feed
So I'm gonna keep these fiends jumping on my block niggas
Shit I'm the man outchea, I'm the jury and judge
So don't fuck with me cuz
It's like the Vegas Strip
These streets is always open
As long as the money roar, I'm gonna keep this city small

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Now see the hood it's all good
You ain't highly educated, so you just can't have shit
Cause you will be playa hated
My boy just bought a new Benz now he's the man in the city
Now it was cool at first but these niggas started actin shitty
I tried to go straight but these fools just wouldn't let me
A nigga see me in the mall so a nigga tried to sweat me
It was cool for a minute yeah, I thought I was free
But I knew I couldn't leave cause these streets keep calling me
