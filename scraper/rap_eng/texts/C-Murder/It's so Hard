[Intro, Martain Luther King Jr & C-Murder]
I have a dream
(There's no easy walk to freedom)
That one day, this nation will rise up
And live out the true meaning of its creed
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal

(Chorus, Jahbo & C-Murder)
It's so hard (Mama pray for ya' baby)
To be your brother nowadays
To be your brother nowadays oh (Come on man, come on)
It's so hard (Mama pray for ya' baby)
To be C-Murder nowadays (It's my testimony man)
Na na na na na na na na na (Still I rise)

Verse One:
It's the never ending story
I'm Corey this is my story
And I'm trapped in crime
They kidnap me because my glory
Keep laughing this ain't funny
The main basis is money
We integrated but still hated
Better days is coming
Politically I'm in prison incarcerated prevision
Now who's decision was it to eliminate my position
The opposition is [?]
I'm allergic to submission
They legal strategy see I was taught in catechism
We lost our last mission now it's time for violation to cease
In genesis yeah we walking for peace
I hear you talking through me
Cause' my protection is heaven
I'm only telling you never to divide just make it better
Whatever they know I'm not guilty
The crooked cops dealt me
A bad call, we pray and fear is hard
I'm taking [?]
Exposing my constitution to police
Now whoever can see, it never was me

(Chorus, Jahbo & C-Murder)
It's so hard (Mama pray for ya' baby)
To be your brother nowadays
To be your brother nowadays, oh
It's so hard (Mama pray for ya' baby)
To be C-Murder nowadays (Never give up though, there's always hope, remember that)
Na na na na na na na na na (Still I rise)

It ain't no justice if an innocent man is getting busted
I'm in the public eye
They wanna trap me till' I die
I'm rapping, you telling lies
Convict me with closed eyes
I'm tryna' make a change
And you just blinding these guys
Let's hit rewind and retry
Recalculate our every move
You fabricating clues but I ain't destined to lose
It's looking messy the news
Is tryna' give me the blues
But I'm prepared for battle
I walk in great mans shoes
And every step is getting harder
I'm carrying the weight of the world up on my shoulder
It's so heavy for a soulja
My babies is getting older
I watch em' grow behind the glass
Now that's the worst thing man they get so big fast
I think it's just us
Cause' ain't no justice
Prepare for college cause' the knowledge man you must get
We took a rough hit
But I smell victory
So I embrace my place and make history

(Chorus, Jahbo & C-Murder)
It's so hard (Mama pray for ya' baby)
To be your brother nowadays
To be your brother nowadays, oh
It's so hard (Mama pray for ya' baby)
To be C-Murder nowadays (I have a dream)
Na na na na na na na na na (Look)

Now only god can judge your decisions to pull the plug
On every thug, I wasn't thuggin' now you buggin' show me love
I'm touched, my people love me so much
They can't trust the system
It's full of brothers they a victim
You know I wish them well
Cause' when dealing with jail he was a hell of a fella' that's why he never failed
I will forever tell you the truth
The proof is right in-front of us
It's hard for everyone of us
Society want none of us
Believe me it's deceiving
Now what's the reason they living said so easy
My baby needs me
My family is so sad they shedding tears
My kids be like "We want you home dad"
They so scared
My [?] intelligence is irreverent
Yeah they trying to ruin me
No bail with felonies
Motel they tellin' me
But they hypocritical
Yes it is political
Lord I keep it spiritual

(Chorus, Jahbo & C-Murder)
It's so hard (Mama pray for ya' baby)
To be your brother nowadays
To be your brother nowadays, oh
It's so hard (Mama pray for ya' baby)
To be C-Murder nowadays (I have a dream)
Na na na na na na na na na (x2)
