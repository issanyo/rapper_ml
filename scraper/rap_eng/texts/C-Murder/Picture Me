[Intro]
Motherfuckers,you see a TRU nigga walk on the streets
You step on the side and respect that man
TRU niggas never die we recreate to survive

[Chorus]
Picture me a TRU nigga
(real niggas don't die.Cause TRU niggas gon ride.)
Picture me a TRU nigga
(real niggas don't die.Cause TRU niggas gon ride.)
Picture me a TRU nigga
(real niggas don't die.Cause TRU niggas gon ride.)
Picture me a TRU nigga
(real niggas don't die.Cause TRU niggas gon ride.)

[Magic]
I been livin my whole life just awaitin this opportunity
To clock G's and makin you motherfuckers see
Criminal minded I'm leavin you bitches blinded
You motherfuckers should kneel when my thoughts start unwinding
I joined a force to be reckoned with,and we all TRU
We got political leaders jockin our fuckin crew
Millionaire mothafuckas but still we thug niggas
Catch me flossin in Hilfigers with my TRU niggas
Coatin bitches only fantasized in your biggest dreams
Make em scream like Master P (ungh!) scream for Ice Cream
Got a nigga like Mr. Magic makin six figures
It feels good to be a TRU nigga

[Chorus]

[C-Murder]
Motherfuckers know I mean business,when I walk in the streets
I keep a picture of my kid,in case a nigga get me
Affiliated with this army,and TRU be my click
Tattoes,all up on me,cause I'll die for this shit
My definition of a TRU nigga.I represent it
Is a soldier ready to ride for No Limit,and win it
And if I lose another tank dogg,he's always in my memory
I put you in a song and you become a part of history
To all my real niggas:don't let the ghetto take you under
If you travel the streets,make moves,in large numbers
A couple guns,some extra clips,don't make you bigger
You need some niggas watchin yo back,you need some TRU niggas

[Chorus]

[Magic]
You have the right to be paranoid
You standing in front of the Southern's finest
Bein broke and livin slow is some bullshit behind us
Million dollar dreams of gettin rich
Smokin my weed and drinking hennesey down by the pitcher
Ain't no slippin because my click is fuckin airtight
So playa hater get yo shit right
I annihilate you niggas I think is gonna bother me
No greater love then bringin myself on my enemies
So lord forgive me for thinking materialistic
But society's full of bullshit
I done sold my soul,so you can label me a paid nigga
It feels good to be a TRU nigga

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Laughing.).Picture me with TRU records
A made nigga.Immortal.Us niggas never die.We multiply
(Laughing).I'ma make all you niggas remember me
Y'all niggas feel me?
