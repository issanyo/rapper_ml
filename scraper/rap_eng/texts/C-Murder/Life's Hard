[Chorus:]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don’t ever let them nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend, be about your business
Stay ten toe down and get it
And work [x8]

[Verse 1:]
When you call a nigga phone and never answer for you
That mean that nigga never gave a fuck about you
You in the streets, don’t keep your Id in your wallet
I got like six names, I can be anybody
Early in the morning got the store rock
Everything I do I see somebody watching
Lost everything I had
The Future said he got me
I turn them free bags into millions of dollars
Make some jewelry up,now I’m gooder than you
Feel like my slick partner blow them cash pot
Hit up Doffe on working in the dump
So anything you want I got it in the trunk

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
They say crime don’t pay
Well the grind don’t pay
Get the line
Don’t flying, and the sun don’t shining
Still I take time, in the coming due time
I ain’t got no time
I’m raw for mine
Don’t ask how, all my cash come
Can’t wait then cause I need it now
Tell them say
My pistol hanging
I make the shoe rain like I’m Jessy Jones
I got great hang
Ye I’m packing rich
I’m a pimp nigga I can make a bitch
And I can’t turn one a them wild bitch
But u can turn her from being to a whole brick
Man 2Pack, that old shit
Fill a nigga ass with holes quick
Loose a nigga head for a trophy
Then dump a nigga body in the ocean
Frig up bitch with my trigger finger
Same finger that I want to blank with
How the fuck you a hit man
And I payed you and you ain’t hit a shit
Not bird game but it’s rich squad
But I’ll make a nigga hoe say dip quick
Got a new map with a cooler on it
Hold your force gotta show em something

[Chorus]

[verse 3:]
You in the streets and you ain’t got it nigga you better take it
Every nigga round me is impatient
Down in Miami I know a couple a Haitians
Man, GOD and projects, the brick stupid, crazy
Before the day over, twenty to a head
Remix like I cater
I serve you like a waiter
You on the block with no pack, nigga I see you later
Got dope all flavours
Catch me working daily
All I want is paper
Damn G we made it
We gotta go to work
You can’t be looking crazy
You go trap a goal
If you know how to play it
I had to switch
My whole three niggas snitching crazy

[Chorus]
