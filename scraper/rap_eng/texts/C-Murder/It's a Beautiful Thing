[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah Alot of people always ask me ...
Snoop Dogg  ... What it feel like being on No Limit Records ?
How that nigga P treat you ?
What C-Murder and Silkk the Shocker like ?
Nigga let me tell ya somethin

[Snoop Dogg]
Fancy cars, big ole rings
Pushin the dope and I don't mean cocaine
No pain, no game I struggle for mine
I hustle for mine and that's all the time
I b-ball wit P, C, Silkk and Serv
Went to my homies from the CP Third
Southside niggas on the west coast curves
We givin up love, while we blazin up bud
How yall fell about that No Limit shit ?
Big Snoop Dogg you know we rock that shit
Well put on yo jersey and yo mothafuckin tank
And show yo golds and crack some hoes
We closin down shop but the game be sold
Imma have money even when I'm old
From a G to key when u fuckin wit P
Somehow someway got to get the money

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Hell yeah it's a beautiful thing
Yeah yall it's a beautiful thing
No Limit it's a beautiful thing
Yeah yall it's a beautiful thing
(TRU, TRU) (Can yall dig it ?)
Yeah yall it's a beautiful thing
TRU it's a beautiful thing
No Limit it's a beautiful thing

[C-Murder]
Snoop check this out
Me and my nigga Snoop shootin dice lookin fo cheese (for keys)
We get high cause we keeps that bomb ass weed
And fuck them otha niggas (why ?) I'm ridin wit Dogg (Dogg)
And I'm 6 ft tall (tall)
And a couple of a calls (Calls)
And bookoo broads (Broads)
And bookoo hoes (Hoes)
And bookoo shows (Shows)
And fat optimos (Optimos)
Tru playaz for real, run up you gettin killed
Make the wrong move and I'm tying yo shoes
Mac down south nigga wit the Cali boyz
And like Roy we totin them plastic toys
(Beach) On the beach droppin nothin but heat
From the L.B.C. to the CP3
I love this shit like I say in bed
Its like 2 bad bitches givin u head
Snoop in the tank countin nothin but bank
What yall thank nigga ? It's a beautiful thang

[Chorus]
