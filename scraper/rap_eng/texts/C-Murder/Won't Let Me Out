Sittin' here in the belly of the beast, C-Murder
Trapped in crime behind bars, TRU
I'm locked up, ain't no love
They won?t let me out, think they testin' me
Check this out

Incarcerated, eliminated, I sure hated it
It's hard labor for life that?s what the judge stated
D.A. trippin', he shady, I think he wanna kill me
Talk to my cell every time I'm mad, I know he feel me

Yeah baby, I moved on, you can keep the pictures
That's my girl, she left me, she ain't keep it real wit me
Now I'm stressin', I need a victim so I can hit him
And 30 days in the hole is cold, but watch me ride wit him

I'm steady tryin' to find the motive, why do what I do?
The freedom ain't gettin' no closer no matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
The cops patrollin' and that had ?em stopped me

And I get locked up
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)

Locked up
They won't let me out, oh
They won't let me out
(They got me botched up)

Locked up
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)

Locked up
They won't let me out, no
(Caught up, I?m locked up but they can't stop us)
They won't let me out

Some more visits and ripe chickens across the border
What's your number? I'm hurtin', let me get a money boarder
I owe my lawyer some change, now he might drop the case
Now if my player don't shake it, I might hop the gate

Starin' at these walls I'm fallin', he set my court date back
Payback when I shake back and cop a Maybach
I'm eatin' beans and lustin' on King?s magazines
It seems I'm home free but it was just dream, damn

I get locked up
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)

Locked up
They won't let me out, oh
They won't let me out
(They got me botched up)

Locked up
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)

Locked up
They won't let me out, no
(Caught up, I'm locked up but they can't stop us)
They won't let me out

Visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is gettin' empty
Cellmates eatin' food without me

Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
(Move on with my life)
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I get locked up

I'm spreadin' my gangs ?cause I'm straight done in like a gang banger
Don't play no games and mess around and shank with the hanger
That's how I'm comin' and I do my dirt and stick and move
Tears tattooed, a head busta walkin' in these shoes

Snitches workin' with the warden, eyes open and scopin'
And these humps I'm smokin', got my lungs chokin'
I'm the big dog on the blocks, I got 2-for-1's
And 21 with a L, I'm hopeless, son, I'm locked up

They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)

Locked up
They won't let me out, oh
They won't let me out
(They got me botched up)

I?m locked up
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)

Locked up
They won't let me out, no
(Caught up, I?m locked up but they can't stop us)
They won't let me out

Will you pay me a visit?
They won't let me out
Send me some magazines
(I?m locked up)
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)

Send me some money orders
They won't let me out, oh
Pay me a visit, baby
They won't let me out
(They got me botched up)

?Cause I?m locked up
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)
Where's my lawyer?
They won't let me out
(I?m locked up)

Locked up
They won't let me out, no
(Caught up, locked up but they can't stop us)
Get me out of here
They won't let me out

Locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out

I'm locked up
They won't let me out, no
(Where's my, I?m locked up)
They won't let me out
I'm locked up
