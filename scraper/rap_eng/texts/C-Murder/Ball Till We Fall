C-Murder: (talking)
Nigga, between this No Limit and TRU shit
You gotta take me out the game to take me from this shit here boy
This real down here, niggas getting paid
And we gonna stick together and represent it foverever

Chorus: (x2)
We gon' ball till we fall nigga
I'm gon' ball till I motherfucking fall

C-Murder:
Try to sell a million records, get paid like a bank teller
Have I ever crossed the line, nigga never
I'm gonna ride with the tank to the end
Test me (test me) and watch Big V do you in
I only answer to one nigga on this earth
That's the colonel, fuck with him you get hurt
I'm known for catching niggas in their residence
I'd tell you more but that shit considered evidence
I'm a motherfucking straight shot
I got to have it on the blocks, where a nigga used to slang rocks
But TRU niggas smoke weed like trees
No Limit niggas cash shecks with no I.D.'s
I never ran from a man in my life
The hardest nigga, but you better have your mind right
Don't snort no coke or shoot heron
Bitch I'm crazy on my motherfucking own, and uh
I ain't about all that getting dressed up shit
I go to clubs where them thugs hang out bitch
I won't rest till they put my name on the wall
In other words, I'm gonna gonna ball till I motherfucking fall

Chorus x2

Magic:
I'm gonna ball nigga, there's not a man that gon' stop me
I'm a bad motherfucker so these Fed's are scared to watch me
I real definition of a thug is me
Mr. Magic motherfucker, I know y'all heard of me
Been in it from the beginning, consider my self small
Converted pounds to G's and I ain't never got caught, cause I got heart
That's how I got myself into this position
Now I'm in the game and the fame is an addition
Now vision this 9th Ward nigga working meals
Cause I got skills to pay the bills
Feel what I feel
A nigga couldn't pay me to pause
Cause I'm gonna ball til I motherfucking fall nigga

Chorus x4

Us niggas gonna ball till we fall nigga
Feel what I'm saying
No Limit and TRU records baby, peep this out
" You ain't got a thang, unless you got a tank"
Ha Ha
