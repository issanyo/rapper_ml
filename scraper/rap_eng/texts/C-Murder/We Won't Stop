Can't stop til the tanks on the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall
We can't stop til our tank's on the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall

[Mafia talking]
Today, I'd like to welcome a few souljas (welcome)
To this No Limit world (No Limit world)
A world where we've been preachers (huh Bro)
Harassed (harassed) and even incarcerated for making it (fuckin' FBI)
And chasing the finer things (fuckin' government)
Even though we legit, (you fuckin' cockroaches)
Ghetto millionaires (millionaires man)
Society still tryin' to cage us in (open the big bin man)
But today, (today) today I say fuck the world (fuck the world)
As we made it, Silkk the Shocker (Silkk the Shocker)
C-Murder (C-Murder, bossalinie)
And Master P... Made men (da last don)

[Master P]
UGHHHHHH....
We can't stop til the tanks on the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall
We can't stop til the tanks on the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall

I got a pawn for the week, meet me up the street
See momma gotta eat, how much for a key
See my bank from ghetto blood, when my homies show me love
When hotboys run the streets, it was tanks and hugs
Niggas ain't gotta hustle no more, easy come, easy go
No limit should be platinum before the shit hits the store
With my cutless he could get his mind right
And (trey hamm?) loved the lime light
Big boys pushin' dimes right
And y'all hatas ya'll don't wanna fight

Ughhhhhh....
We can't stop til the tanks on the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall
We can't stop til the tanks on the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall

[C-Murder]
I visualize gettin' shot by the bullets of my enemies
Rest in peace, to all my fallen homies
Young souljas turned victim at the full moon
I still shiver when i glance at my war wounds
Niggas feel my justice, and facial expression
So many mother's shed tears i guess they learned they lesson
Cause TRU niggas make the world go round
The world ain't never been the same since the last don put it down
T-R-U, M-O-B, til the day we die
We represent the intercity, the dark side
We made men, made from the realest niggas thoughts
With the game from our veins straight to the heart

Nigga, feel it, know what I'm sayin'
We represent the made men til the day we die
Silkk the Shocker (Made Men)

[Master P]
Riders, Ughhhhhhhhhhhh....
We can't stop til our tanks on the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall
We can't stop til the tanks on the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall

[Silkk the Shocker]
Made man, y'all motherfuckers know me
It's like the world is mine, you livin in it, y'all niggas owe me
Cause i see death before i see life, death before I see white
Death for a price, by the shotty left of the vice
My only advice is I'm a thug, nigga, now ride once killas
See you don't wanna test my tank doggs, you don't wanna test me nigga
It's like I, beef with the top, sleep with a Glock
One hollow be paranoid, just like I, sleep at watch
It ain't my fault, if we had to take it to war
Might not be that serious, but you x-ed out if I take it to heart

I'm a made man, that means ya'll can test it anytime
And so many niggas wanna see me not make it
I'm a ball til I fall, all of us, me, P, C
The whole No Limit nigga, I'm a made man, ha ha...

[Master P]
Ughhhhhh....
We can't stop til the tank's at the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall
We can't stop til the tank's at the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall
We can't stop til the tank's at the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall
We can't stop til the tank's at the wall
Cause we made men and we goin ball til we fall

We goin' ball til we fall nigga
From the south, to the east, to the west
And up north nigga, and to my little young nigga
Free, in New York, keep your eyes open nigga
Think with your mind and not with your soul
That's how you free your pain
That's how you become a made man...
