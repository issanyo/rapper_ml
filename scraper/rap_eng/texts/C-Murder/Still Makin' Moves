[Lil Kevin]
Hey C-Murder, who you who you hang with?

[C-Murder]
Say lil kevin boy, you know i'm still makin moves with thugs

[Master p]
Part 2 nigga!! haha all dem thugs get em up out there nigga

[C-Murder]
I leave the house 10 o clock and jump in my lac
Call my niggas fiend n mac cause they got my back
And even the one time you was tryin to hack
I still pack a strap and recock my gat
Eliminatin all my enemies tryin to blind me
Im still makin moves but it's hard to find me
Steadily gettin richer pursuin my dreams
I just cashed a check for three million d's
I told yall niggas last year dont play no games
Got dem no limit niggas out there callin my name
Went from sneakin in stores to dem sell out shows
Went from crime to rhyme already did my time
I say you dont wanna go to war wit me
I got hot boy n big swoll wit me
Just some more ghetto muthafuckas ridin wit me
Cause makin moves wit thugs is a hobby

[Chrous: Mo B. dick]
All my homies know tha deal
If you thuggin keep it real
Dont forget to pack tha steel
Incase we got some caps to peel
You know tha deal
This thug's for real
We pack tha steel
Got caps to peel

[Master P]
How many niggas wanna ride wit me?
Throw a party thug girls get wild wit me
Its involved wit green nigga bother p
56 million like tha lottery
From the charlotte hornets to mtv
How many patnas do you see when im on tv?
And if i get cut im gonna buy tha team
Cause i made my money from tha triple beam
I lived tha life of a dealer nigga hangin wit killas
I fucked around and come back to slangin keys
But thats alright cause these niggas get paid
Young niggas gonna be thugs to the grave

[Chorus]
