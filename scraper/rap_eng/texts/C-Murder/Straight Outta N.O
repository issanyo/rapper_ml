[C-Murder]
Wassup niggas and niggets?
We got the muthafuckin infamous three in this bitch
That Uptown nigga, that Third Ward nigga
And that Ninth Ward nigga
We represent for every hood on this muthafuckin globe
No Limit, nigga check this out
I'm a tell you niggas like this

[C-Murder]
Straight out the projects, a crazy nigga named C-Murder
Quick to put a muthafucker in a death gerter
First we blank to smoke weed out of zig zags
And call it chop chop to meet me on the dope spot
In the projects we flip checks for the bricks
And beat dope fiends down with them iron sticks
My nigga Serv and Mr. Magic bout to cause havoc
Ready, aim, shoot, niggas jumpin like some jack rabbits
I hit the third and I swerve with Serv
Pushin birds by the herbs, from the jets to the suburbs
A trigger happy muthafucka with respect, breaking necks
Coming straight out the muthafuckin projects

[Mr. Serv On]
These motherfuckers don't know me
You niggas don't know muthafuckin streets
I'll fuckin survive

Straight outta uptown, a rowdy muthafucka named Serv
You niggas need to believe what the fuck you see
And not what the fuck you heard
Before it's all said and done, nigga I'm a make you stand and bow
When I flow all my muthafuckin raps on the tracks, everbody get wild
(Uptown, uptown, we don't take no shit
Uptown, uptown, niggas staight jack ya bitch
Uptown, uptown, we don't take no shit
Uptown, uptown, niggas straight jack ya bitch)
Back to lesson at hand, bitches gotta understand
Fuck it nigga I accept this fuckin war, I'm the fuckin man
You can go blow for blow, rap for rap, better yet blast for blast
What up nigga, I'm talkin too muthafuckin fast
I tell you nigga I'm a slow it down
No Limit, I never fall, damn you hate to see some muthafuckin' killas ball
So guess what niggas when I come around, you know it's going down
Believe it nigga, I'm straight outta uptown

[Magic]
Man wait, hold on, hold on
Ya'll niggas is something fuckin else bruh
Man fix me a fuckin drink and roll me a blunt
Let the downtown nigga do a little something ya hoid me?

Straight out the Ninth Ward, remember me, It's Mr. Magic
I'm here and I'm hittin harder than a heron habit
Got the world screamin Ninth Ward, bitch I might drop it
When I'm driving in St. Clause, all my pastors die hard
Because I made it and I'm keepin' it real
Every song I scream Ninth Ward, I could imagine how ya'll people feel
See my name all over t-shirts
Walkin with my CD's, coming to concerts
I can see em pushin in the crowd
Actin real ignorant, screamin real loud

(From the Nine, niggas don't mind dying
]From the Nine, niggas don't mind dying)
Huh, huh
(From the Nine, niggas don't mind dying
]From the Nine, niggas don't mind dying)

Now where my niggas at, what what

Where my niggas at, what what
Where my niggas at, what what
Straight out the Ninth Ward
