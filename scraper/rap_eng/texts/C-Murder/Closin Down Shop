[Intro]
Say Magic
Slim brah
Nigga we gotta go ahead and close that little quarter shop we got on Broad
Fuck them niggas watching us bro we
Gotta lay low nigga fuck

[Hook x2: Soulja Slim]
I'm closing down shop so clientele stops
Knocking at my door fuck no
I dont have no more dealys not being sold
Cause it's too hot plus I'm on parole

[Verse 1: Soulja Slim]
It's twelve in the noon, I'm just waking up from a flight
Hicks been knocking at my door all goddamn night
And my hoe she busted talking bout she tired of that
Deep and down tell her bout how much paper we be stacking
Cause they run from that smack and that shit I got raw
Don't ya be a dog, this dealy might bust your heart
And the niggas that I get it from supplies the city
They got other niggas with it but they bags be shitty
Cause they trying to put too much cut on the dope
To make a little more ends
But the only person scoring is they friends
They got 20 dollar bags, they got 10
But now you going let your boy move all the ends
Now see my clients, they know what the fuck they be buying
They be coming shop be closed and they still be running
Making my shop high and they might come kick it in my spot
But I got my shit got cause I ain't about doin no more time
You got on them bullet proof vests I got on mines
Bullets be flying, flying

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Murder]
I'm closing down shop cause my clientele's getting too big
I got these laws on my balls and they sweating my shit
Dope fiends knocking at my door, they got my spot too hot
These suckas running on my colors on my quarter shop
2 baby mommas, 4 kids, 3 mack elevens
3 cars, about 13 boo boo's
I'm just a ghetto superstar
On parole, convicted felon known for 187's and 211's
A young nigga down to do whatever
First and fifteenth checks fix blowing up my beeper
Beaucoup pages new credit, my shit is cut up and ready
I'm on top never drop, pushing keys that rock
But I gotta close shop cause my spot's too hot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Magic]
Bitches trying to catch the wrong niggas, now tell the truth
You ain't hear we came in strapped nigga, react nigga
Watch for me, dont wanna see me last, keep talking trash
I'm gonna be the one behind the mask, blasting at your pussy-ass
What, boy you disrespect my clique you stupid bitch
I'm about to jump off in your shit
I rumble in the jungle with the fiercest piece alive
Climb the biggest mountain with the highest peaks it high
From the biggest ocean with the biggest fucking fish
If I ever hear you speak these filthy words again
I told you mutherfuckers I was coming (what)
I brought the tank mutherfuckers, stop running (laugh, gun cock)
Dont move a fucking muscle, got no time for no wrestling
Got no time for no tussling
Shut it down
