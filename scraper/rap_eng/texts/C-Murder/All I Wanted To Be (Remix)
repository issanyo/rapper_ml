[Intro]
[?] a little trying to sleep, homie
'Cause I ain't phony, yeah I go
Real life right here, feel my pain

[Hook]
All I wanted to be was a soldier, a soldier
All I wanted to be was a soldier, like me
All I wanted to be was a soldier, a soldier
Hustle on the block, flip rocks, and take over

[Verse 1]
Yeah, so many people wish me dead cause i'm a problem
So many problems come to me, cause I solve 'em
And many girls, they hate my guts, they say I dog 'em
It wasn't that, it was the lines, and you crossed 'em
Yeah, I tossed 'em, and I had to do this often
But I can't worry, 'till i'm buried up in my coffin
I'm having dreams that my brothers trying to kill me
And spill me, now why this nigga hate the real C?
After the meals, we still supposed to keep it [?]
I went to jail, any bail, he said he didn't love me
It's ugly, when your brother prosecute you too
Say I'm the black sheep, just show him where the Mac be
P, dog, all you had to do was ask me
But you chose to do your interviews and blast me
[?] me, I was murdered by my hero
A bullet through my heart that tore my whole world apart

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Never kick a man when he's on
Never bounce on your brother when he's in the box
It's bad enough he's in the box
You mad enough to point a finger, bro, well, look in the mirror
And when the smoke clears, I bet the picture's getting clearer
A spitting image of an unloyal hypocrite
[?] old nigga, now picture this
A small victory, 'cause now I know how you really feel
And I ain't dead yet 'cause real goons is hard to kill
Yeah you lied on me, but I ain't cried homie
Sometimes I feel like you might have called the cops on me
Your pops phony, I ain't trying to buy nobody's love
And tell your whole clique: fuck 'em, they just fake [?]
The black sheep, with the black G's and black teeth
The black ski mask, the black brick's in the back seat
The black P's, black heart, and now a [?]
Of a true nigga, I had to let this verse go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's debit for designer and lord to your honor
I promise to always be mindful and conscious
I dry 'em up, I never got a letter from my momma
Whatever, guess the type of son I am is not the kind of
Son that she wanted to be bonded with
That's why I hit the bottle quick
A young nigga stressin', I was out of it
And pops wasn't a role model, never gave a baby bottle
Never made a baby smile, that's why I never holler
I follow, my own route is what I'm gonna do
What I wanna do, but I promise to stay true
'Cause all I wanted to be was a soldier, see?
All I wanted to be was a soldier like P

[Outro]
Y'all know what I meant, man
I been gone for years
I shed so many tears
And for many years, you hear me?
And this is just from the heart, homie

It's just me, myself, and I
It's just me, myself, and I; until I die homie
