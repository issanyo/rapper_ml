[Taken from Martin Luther King Jr's speech]
Though we come to cash this check
A check will give us a fund demands
A riches of freedom and the security of justice

Chorus [C-Murder]

Forever TRU, 'til I'm dead (Do you still love me?)
This be the TRUest shit I ever said
I'm forever TRU, 'til I'm dead (Do you still love me?)
This be the TRUest shit I ever said
Forever TRU, 'til I'm dead (Do you still love me?)
This be the TRUest shit I ever said
I'm forever TRU, 'til I'm dead (Do you still love me?)
This be the TRUest shit I ever said

[C-Murder]
Me and my nigga knew we ride, and vibe
And smoke weed, and get high and talk about my niggas that died
No Limit Records opened doors for niggas
But they rebelled, turned Bendict
Don't make me get up in your shit, bitch
And let me tell you something you alredy know
Fucking with me, is like fucking with the whole yole'
I'm still depressed about my nigga Mac
I let him roll with some bitch ass niggas, but I'ma handle that
And to much drama for my baby momma
Them niggas tapping my phone, they wouldn't safe at home
I need a ride or die, stand by my side, from the projects
My baby boo be the realest chick I ever met
I let that Cash Money shit slide but it's cool
But next time I'ma have to act a fool
I keep it street, and them real niggas love it
Forever TRU til I'm dead, cause I'ma die thuggin', ya heard me?

Chorus [C-Murder]

Forever TRU, 'til I'm dead (Do you still love me?)
This be the TRUest shit I ever said
I'm forever TRU, 'til I'm dead (Do you still love me?)
This be the TRUest shit I ever said

[C-Murder]
Be runnin' outta clubs, as nigga be rasing flags
You only get nine lives I murder that ass
It's the world's most dangerous crew, TRU Records
My crew stay behind bars, we ghetto superstars
Been droppin' bars in studios, and finger fuck pretty hoes
And got a pad in every ghetto
Niggas wanna be a pimp, that's a lie
The tank dumpin' niggas like Kemp, then they die
It's on now nigga, I'm ready
You see my face up in your dreams like Freddy
So bow down, all you motherfuckers leaving my crew
Bow down to a TRU nigga greater than you

Chorus [C-Murder]

Forever TRU, 'til I'm dead (Do you still love me?)
This be the TRUest shit I ever said
I'm forever TRU, 'til I'm dead (Do you still love me?)
This be the TRUest shit I ever said

[C-Murder]
Forever TRU baby, you know what that means?
I'm with this shit 'til I'm dead, you dig?
No Limit, TRU, forever
Do you still love me?
