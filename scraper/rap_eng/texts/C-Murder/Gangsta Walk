[Intro]
Gangsta gang Gangsta Gangsta Gangsta Gangsta
Gangsta Gang Gang Gang Gang Gang Gangsta (walk)
Gang Gang Gang Gang Gang Gangsta (walk)
Gang Gang Gang Gang Gang Gangsta (I'm a gangsta)

[Verse 1: C-Murder]
I'm a motherfucking gangsta nigga
I still make moves and smoke weed with thug niggas
I love you niggas, my drug dealing days in the past
But I never hesitate to kick a dumb dumb nigga's ass
I call shots just like I was the last don
You heard a TRU Records bitch that's mine
My shit's hot, not even all the ice in the North Pole
Could make my motherfucking rhymes cold
And I'm ghetto like a bitch trading food stamps for cash, huh
I'm about to score another bag
And I speak with a muthafucking slur when I talk
And I still do that muthafucking gangsta walk

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know my apparel, double barrel with the hollow points
My young homie in the back seat he swallowed joints
When the po-lice get after, we dipping on three wheels
Cup filled to the rim, feather in my brim
Headed to a party in the LBC
No Limit Soldiers with the DPG
When me and my homeboys step into the house
All the bitch-ass niggas start breaking out
Cause you know they know what's up
So we started looking for the bitches with the big butts
Like her but she keep crying, I gotta boyfriend bitch stop lying
Punk-ass hooker ain't nothing but a dyke
Suddenly I see some niggas that I dont like
Cripped out, ripped out, flipped out, they dipped out
Soon as they found out who we all a-bizout

[Hook]

[Verse 3: C-Murder]
Sometimes I want me a bitch, sometimes I don't
And sometimes I gotta bust a nut and sometimes I won't
From the crips to the bloods to the niggas sellin' drugs
Yet niggas pimp hoes in the muthafucking clubs
I'm the 'G' in gangsta
The nigga that'll hang you, the ship that'll sink you
And the bullet that'll bang you
I'm the hour in a clock, I'm the high on the rock
I'm the last motherafucker you would ever wanna stop bitch
I'm rich, fuck rap
I'll preach then have your bitch-ass working for me
I hit you with a 187, I'll shank you
Cause I'm a mothafucking gangsta nigga

[Hook]
