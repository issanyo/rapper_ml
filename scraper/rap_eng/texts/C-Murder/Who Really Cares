[Chorus:] [x2]
Who really cares I was raised on welfare
A little shitty ass nigga
Nobody else cares
Who off to grab me
My mamma couldn’t find me
So, I said fuck it
I was hustling while I was rhyming

[Verse 1:]
No house
No food
No eat
Hunger pains had a nigga just praying for sleep
A need deep in the street
Just a nigga live cree
Just a nigga live pass the beat, no meat
Ain’t there’s red beans and rice
So ye, it was a fucked up life
I’m walking round and pissing pampers all night
Alright, that’s how the seeds been planted
The baby ganster empty handed
Now let me be a little kind
I’m stranded in the projects
Coke with us
No playing
Don’t pay us
Don’t feeling safe, okay
There’s no way
That  little kid like me will miss the chance
To get a second chance
My nigga, a second I plan a picture
I can’t, earn a good rocks,a book rocks
And the ice box get slain by my white socks
And if the cops hit the blocks
Don’t be smiling when I got them
When they leave imma throw up in the box, that’s me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Who really cares by the way we was raised
In the streets and the A niggas trying to get payed
Getting money from utilizing that criminal waste
Cause a lot of time, being a criminal pays
Gotta get it so them fam can eat
And the system ain’t design for we niggas
So we turn to the streets
The streets turn a nigga strate to a beast
Even eat or get ate
And there’s ain’t no way I’m gonna end up at a place
So we're damn, we're crook
I’m chasing the ticket
Going out there, gonna get it
They ain’t come back with us
Know what’s it like not to have shit
And see niggas with it
Had to figure out a way
That I’m finna gon get it
Niggas keep the tool on there foot
From them other niggas from tripping
Tryna catch a nigga sleeping
When they try, imma kill him
But that’s just the way us niggas is living
Due to certain circumstances
Just working with the shit we was given, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
In my life I can’t let a nigga cross the line
Cause if he cross that line
I’m have to off that 9
I’m have to toss that hat
I make it cough and spine
Ye I loss a clip
But his house bigger than mine
Gotta keep them niggas in line
That’s how we coming in zip code
Ziploc bates
Boy we cut them we pistols
And I miss those
Niggas dead that I love
And my home is with a L
Like a porch boy glob
See we know that forever we would mug the system
I know you got your people
And I know you really miss them
Restrictions, between the cops and the blacks
I remember uncle boy got popped
At the bus stop
Must not let the streets just take me under
When I’m full of that shit
Sometimes it really makes me wonder
People so innocent can become an animal
There’s so much venjohn within
And murder many man

[Chorus]
