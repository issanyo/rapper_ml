Chorus:
I'm staring at the walls, I can't sleep
I wanna see my kids, I wanna be free (they got me lock down)
I'm staring at the walls, I can't sleep
I wanna see my kids, I wanna be free (they got me lock down)

Verse 1:
My lil' cousin Folley, down in that 'llo
I gotta phone call, said them niggas in the store
I said "Is you playing or dogg, is you real?"
'Cause you know that somebody is 'bout to get killed
I started loading bullets in my chrome revolver
Whenever I gotta problem, it's my problem solver
Then I call Boo-Boo, and told him to call Tony
Told him meet at the spot, just incase them people on me
My trigger finger itchy, and I am smoking on that sticky
To puffs was enough, to get me feeling tricky
I roll up on the spot with forty-five reasons
To leave a nigga bleeding, like it's kill a nigga season
Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat-Tat, some fools got wet
Now I ain't break a sweat, but I got their respect
And now I am in a cell for the holidays, oh well
At least I am alive, shit I could of been in hell

Chorus:
I'm staring at the walls, I can't sleep
I wanna see my kids, I wanna be free (they got me lock down)
I'm staring at the walls, I can't sleep
I wanna see my kids, I wanna be free (they got me lock down)

Verse Two:
Going in and out of jail, my people say I'm finished
They said I'm bad news, like my big cousin Jimmy
My name's in the paper, cause I'm always in messes
The po-po's caught me hot with some guns and a vest
But I'd rather get caught with it, then without it
You run up on No Limit, you better be 'bout it
I'll never tuck my tank in, I'm never running
I don't care if it's me against a motherfucking hunnit
I represent the tank, that means I'm a soldier
I wear No Limit Gear with MP's and smoke doulja
There goes the police sweatin' me again
I had some open warrants so the fools took me in

Chorus:
I'm staring at the walls, I can't sleep
I wanna see my kids, I wanna be free (they got me lock down)
I'm staring at the walls, I can't sleep
I wanna see my kids, I wanna be free (they got me lock down)
I'm staring at the walls, I can't sleep
I wanna see my kids, I wanna be free (they got me lock down)
I'm staring at the walls, I can't sleep
I wanna see my kids, I wanna be free (they got me lock down)
