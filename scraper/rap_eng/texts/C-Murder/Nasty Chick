[Intro: C-Murder]
Listen up motherfuckers I got a story to tell
All you niggas out there holding hands with these motherfuckers street
Them motherfuckers behind doors holding meat
You might be holding a nasty ass

[Chorus (2x):]
Nasty bitch, gonna fuck my boy
Now how you gonna fuck my boy
That's why I don't love them hoes
You can't trust these dog ass hoes

[Verse 1]
I was in love like a motherfucker with this bitch
But uhh, I wasn't doing nothing but making her rich (shit)
But damn, she used to played it so cooled
I guess she must take C for a fool
I swear the sex had my motherfucking mind gone
And I was tweeking like a fiend for that heroin
And when I put it in, the way that she moaned
Made me never ever wanted to leave her alone
The back rubs in the hot tubs, watching videos
It made me crawl when she took it all down her throat
Surprise, shit I hit her with a five karat
And later on we can talk about marriage (huh)
Ya name tatted on my chest, fuck them other broads
We hold hands when we walking through the shopping malls
My brother told me V charge it to the game
But uhh, listen up, cause it's a motherfucking shame

[Chorus (2x)]

[Verse 2]
I used to page this girl about ten times a day
But after 9, she was hard to find
One-of-a-kind, huh, so I was blind with the problems we had
Found a number in her purse, said it was her dad
I got a phone call from my nigga Jubilee
He told me, he saw my girl in the movies
With another nigga, nut it wasn't me
I said man, you must be tripping, nigga it couldn't be
I thought it was love, but I guess the love was gone
So then I put up the phone and then I went home
Park the car, walked in the door, walked up the stairs
And I damn near slipped on her underwear
Opened the bedroom door, seen a ho
With a nigga ro, bout to grab my fo-fo, hold
Damn, bitch I thought we loved each other
Nasty bitch gonna fuck my brother

Bitch, get the fuck out my house
Pick up your dirty ass draws, get that cum off your chest
And wipe your motherfucking mouth, and get the fuck out, biatch!
Fuck you gonna fuck my motherfucking boy
Ol' cheesy ass ho
I didn't like you anyway
Biatch
I catch you in the club, I'ma sneak your ass
Fuck, nasty bitch

[Chorus (2x)]
