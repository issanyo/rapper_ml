[Chorus: D.I.G.]
Too much noise in my ears to think
And not enough liquor in my bottle to drink
I'm goin' in the pussy and I hope I don't stank
I'm suffocatin in you baby, I'm startin to sank

[D.I.G.]
I need some Hennessy with my weed so I can get high
Man feel this shit I'm sayin to you nigga, this ain't no lie
To much motherfuckin noise in my ears to write a verse
Now give me the weed to hit so I can break this curse
This world got me stressed out, that's why I'm always in the bottle
I hit the hen, that shit ain't worth my motherfuckin problem
Haters hate to see a nigga come up
So if see my enemy, I'm gonna through my gun up
These hoes need to understand dick ain't bout' no game
That's why I only fuck with bitches who got a man
Cause pussy bad for you, have a nigga dying in lust
Can't get enough of them guts, that's why they fucked up and out of luck

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Seee, soldiers is some niggas you don't wanna try
Run up on the tank, and get touched, then we ride
I got blood on my hands and I loved to get my dick wet
And I think about the pussy, now blood only coats that
Bitches think I'm nasty cause' I love to get my dick sucked
Two guards to the head,before I fuckin rip them guts up
Now look at that beem on your shirt, it's probably red
And you know I get off, just to know that you dead
I got problems on my mind and I probably can't solve 'em
But you know how I get em' off, wit 38's that revolve
Never bite the hand that feeds me, now that's game to the rollers
And I know y'all niggas mad, cause Snoop Dogg is a soldier

[Chorus]

[C-Murder]
I'm feelin kind of good my nigga, and smokin ounces of weed
And plus I'm drinking, and got two bad bitches with me
Is it the pussy that I'm gettin that's got my feelin so high
Don't ask me why, gettin' blounted is my number one job
Is it the ice on my motherfuckin wrist?
That's got these dog ass hoes acting like bitches
Or mabye its the 50 g's I spend up on my teeth
Or the fact that no other nigga can rap like me
It's too much noise in my ears to think
And not enough liquor in my bottle to drink
I'm goin' in the pussy and I hope I don't stank
I'm suffocatin in you baby, I'm startin to sank
It's too much noise in my ears to think
And not enough liquor in my bottle to drink
I'm goin' in the pussy and I hope I don't stank
I'm suffocatin in you baby, I'm startin to sank
