[Hook]
Bound by locks and chains, we gotta brake free
Free my nigga C, release my nigga E
A true justice movement, what you finna see
Now let us loose 'cause being free is how we gotta be

Bound by locks and chains, we gotta brake free
Free my nigga C, release my nigga E
A true justice movement, what you finna see
Now let us loose 'cause being free is how we gotta be

[Verse 1]
Free my dogs, victims of the system
They all in prison, listen up close, and pay attention
Over-sentencing niggas everyday, in my hometown
Shoutout to my partners locked up, including Eric Brown
They sinking niggas every minute, and letting 'em drown
Trying to make sure they'll never get out of touchdown
Can you imagine that? With no release date?
If your life is on the line, you know that's what they gonna take
I think it's safe to say that the system crooked
The judge, the DA, even the bitches that working booking
Shit I'm steady looking, watching them take my life from me
They trying to [?] sentence me to a century
Shit is real, when you living a life of crime
Look what they did C-Murder, giving him all the time
Shit, but don't stress, just keep your patience
Through trials and tribulations, and one day we all gon' make it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What goes around comes around
Yeah, it's true, and I suffer a consequence for most crimes that I do
I remember what they did to C-Murder, it's nothing new
And having no evidence is a reason to cut him loose
It's a must, I keep it real, spit facts when I speak
Yeah I lived a life of crime, but what about the police
What about the DA and the judges who sentenced me
Open your eyes, pay attention so you can see
The court is in session

[Verse 1]
