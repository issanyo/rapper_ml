[Master P]
I know a couple fire girls that like to dress shob
I got a bad habit, so I might kill and rob
But say Oh Na Nae, ape out tha way
This boy don't play, I got that deuce wit that Tre
So step to me if you wanna, I got some soldiers on tha corner
(Hoody-Hoo!)Hoody-Hoo if you a goner, don't say I didn't warn ya
You think that I'm fakin? You wanna bump? You got some bacon?
Its hot where I'm at cuz the police be chasin
I'm in tha press tryin to check on my dope
Through tha mac, from tha meadow, to tha Calliope
I got a big body Benz, so you know I got ends, I dont have that many friends
Cuz them niggas will do ya in!

[Chorus]
Get Yo Mind Right (8X)
You....betta....get yo mind right
Get yo mind right

[C-Murder]
Man its hot! (How hot?) Man hotter than before
I just seen a little kid got shot up at the store
Another soldier done fell, will his killer go to hell?
Old lady seen it all, but she won't tell
Who really cares wit his dark skin and hair kinda nappy
Preacher said: "Dont worry, be happy"
A momma cries, a baby dies, and she'll never get to see her son's eyes
Alot of genocide got us killin up our own kind
Are we that blind? Or we committed to crime?
Dont be foolish! A weak mind can't fight
That's what they want(Thats what they want), so you betta get yo mind right

[Chorus]
Get Yo Mind Right  (8X)
You....betta....get yo mind right...get yo mind right (2X)

Get yo mind right (8X)
You....betta....get yo mind right...get yo mind right (2X)
