Got a crush head rush what a sensation
Butterflies all night can't stop shaking
Head first I will dive
Head first I will dive

And I can't explain what you do to me
And I can't explain what you do to me
Can't explain what you

No need for gravity when you're floating
No others got the color of my emotion
Head first I will dive

And I can't explain what you do to me
And I can't explain what you do to me
What you do what you do
No need for gravity what a sensation
No need for gravity what a sensation can't I
Can't explain what you do to me can't explain what you

Head first I will dive
Head first I will dive

And I can't explain what you do to me
And I can't explain what you do to me what you do what you do
No need for gravity what a sensation
No need for gravity what a sensation can't I
Can't explain what you do to me can't explain what you to me
Can't explain what you do to me what you do to me what you do to me
