[Verse]
I'm too drunk to drive
But you driving me wild
So pass me that red cup
We're getting fucked up on this love
And there's no one home
Except you and me getting stoned
So let's rock while I roll
I'm getting fucked up on your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I got one reason tonight to get crazy
And these three words for you, "come ‒ with ‒ me"
I got a fifth, I got a six pack and an eight of weed
I left out seven to make sure that you're still listening

[Chorus]
You can count on me, so count on me
And even when the party is over you can count on me

[Verse]
I'm too drunk to drive
But you driving me wild
So pass me that red cup
We're getting fucked up on this love
And there's no one home
Except you and me getting stoned
So let's rock while I roll
I'm getting fucked up on your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I got one reason tonight to get crazy
And these three words for you, "come ‒ with ‒ me"
I got a fifth, I got a six pack and an eight of weed
I left out seven to make sure that you're still listening

[Chorus]
You can count on me, so count on me
And even when the party is over you can count on me

[Bridge]
I climbed my way to a perfect ten
Yeah, I'm on cloud nine, I wanna see you again
'Cause when we're together we celebrate
Gonna blow out them candles like it's your birthday
Ooh, count on me
I got these three words for you, "count ‒ on ‒ me"

[Chorus]
You can count on me if you need a pick-up
Count on me if you ever feel stuck
And even when the party is over you can count on me
