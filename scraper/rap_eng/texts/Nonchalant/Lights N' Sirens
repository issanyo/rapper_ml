(intro)
This track, is by no means, to disrespect, you men and women in blue, that's
True...
But you know there are a few of you out there...
That's just fuckin' it up for everybody

(verse 1)
I see the red lights flashing, damn here they come, what did I do?
I gotta think about what's already done so I'm pulling over
My Range Rover, windows tinted
Got my hands on the wheel while they flashin lights in here
What you lookin' for is underneath your nose
If you take a look around, while you pattin' down my clothes
But it never fails, you got me payin' bail
While the true bad boys is on the streets raisin' hell
I couldn't see it, I couldn't be it, another dirty cop
How the hell is the crime rate rise gonna stop
Transactions, his-a-action, you keep passin'
Every damn day cause I see it around my way
You think you true, but who's gonna win or lose in this crime game
Niggas on the street, doin' dirt through the time change
You writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

Chorus()
Through my window
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin') x2

(verse 2)
Mr Officer, Mr Occifer
Where the hell are you at when I be callin' ya?
Nickle and dimin' passin the time in a doughnut shop
Why don't your ass be a real cop?
Ain't no stayin' at the borders, check your sons and daughters
The judges don't avenge us cause their ass is out of order
I can't plead my case, but when I don't need you
Your ass is in my face sayin' I see you
But I can see you too, and everything you do
Swinging your night stick, Mr man in blue
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now raise your right hand, and your oath, now what's your motto
To break all the rules that your ass is 'sposed to follow
That right hood on your head is just invisible
And when I dig deep, yeah it all gets political
Cause drug orders come from the borders not from the streets
Ships and planes, check the first class seats
But you still pull me over, put your foot on my neck
Hold me down till I stop breathin', said that I flex
But everything must change
Nothing stays the same, so I'ma see that you have your day
When the shit hits the fan and starts to spray
Find my tape, stick it in and then push play
Yeah, this is your foretold warning
And you know I'm getting practise from the deserts that I'm storming
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

(chorus)

Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin')
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin')...
