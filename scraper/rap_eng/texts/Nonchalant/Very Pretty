(Intro)
(Simo Soo)
Ahh... check check
Oh shit

(Chorus)
(flower boy 卓颖贤)
When I was a kid I truly believed
That I could never survive in this reality
But you’re gonna see me on your screen
Yelling ‘mama mama look at me’

(Verse 1)
(Simo Soo)
Indeterminate species like Grimace
I’m so advanced and you are beginners
Disturbed and down with the sickness
Need new villains on my hitlist
Shout out to Grant with the sweet art
I’m full of shit but I am a sweetheart
Negative about my lifestyle
I dressed like Young Thug before Lifestyle
I made rap noise before Death Grips
First Sydney rapper who’s queer, kid
Fuck Sticky Fingers they’re basics
Coming for you with a face kick
Aus music industry so many Weinsteins
On the timeline, it’s your time please
Hold my drink, Lil Peep spirit guide me
I’m a twink but got a tiger inside of me

(Chorus)
(flower boy 卓颖贤)
When I was a kid I truly believed
That I could never survive in this reality
But you’re gonna see me on your screen
Yelling ‘mama mama look at me’


(Verse 2)
(Simo Soo)

Internet used to be my best friend
We were intimate but now you’ve filled me with dread
Anxiety on every corner
I’m trying to see the opposite of this trauma
But catch me in Footscray being hella cutie
Or in Preston listening to Fela Kuti
Negativity washing over me
Tell Troye Sivan to come get at me
Yes Rave with another classic
If you don’t get it give it 15 minutes
And it’s so rad how you givin’ thoughts
Enough to comment that you think I suck
Yeah that’s the point my cutie friend
You’re ten minutes from being a Stan
If radio never plays me again
If that needle don’t drop maybe that’s the plan

(Bridge)
(Simo Soo)

Bout to do a TED Talk to teach these basic bros how to fuck
Yeah I don’t do luck, I get working, watch the work speak up
4KTV ya eyes not good enough to see me
That’s why these sweeties dreamin ‘bout me, I’m so creamy, very pretty
I’m the ghost of Beefheart and Frank Zappa
I fuck the tapes up like I’m Delia Derbyshire
And I inspire things in people like fire
You just do hot takes on Twitter cos it’s easier
And I’m equal parts of Wednesday Addams and Ad Rock
You got fake feelings yeah you’re shutterstock
And no photos with me cos your shutter’s stock

(Outro)

You’re gonna see me on your screen
