[Verse 1: Victor]

Soldier mentality
Still tryna battle me?
The best there ever will be
After somebody kills me
My actions are irrational
Top notch classical
My talent is immortal
But my swag is unstoppable
Still tryna get it?
But I still got it
Some doubt it
Let em' hate bruh
Cause I'm bout it
Top Notch G
V.I.C
The best in my city I'm a rap king

[Verse 2: Nonchalant]

Man I'm a shogun, top ranked general
You won't even be the best after my funeral
My rhymes are immortal
You got your five minutes of fame
I stepped in the game
And you took the walk of shame
No. 1 Mc put me in the hall of fame
The rap game wild it just got tamed
And I'm the best its not self proclaimed
And I just killed it R.I.P rap game

[Hook: Victor]

I'm the best in my city you can't be like me (aye)
Hating on cause I'm as fresh as I can be (wassup)
Wanna get wit it I'm a show you where I be (aye)
Everywhere we go we some top notch g's

[Verse 3: Zay]

I'm a top notch g, and I'm known to go off
Haters always talking man, but I just brush em' off
Cause they don't compare to me, cause my swag too classy
They don't got nun, so I stunt on em' badly
But sadly, I done took over the rap game now
So all you other rappers get back or lay down
And if you wanna start something, then get ready for a showdown
Like the Superbowl I'm a score the last touchdown

[Verse 4: FDG]

Coming last slash illest on the mic its Mr. Grey
Coming up in this rap game, making dollars in the A
Haters wanna flex all day
But they do not wanna play
With Mr. Grey AKA Mr. Make them haters pray
That I never spit like this
My lyrics sharper than a knife
I am something like a match I put this fire in your life
So I'm here to let you know, that I really am the best
You not on my level yet so never put me to the test!

[Hook]
