(Baphomet MC)

Yeah, there's so much shit that I'm going through
And most times I don't know what to
Do I toke on that green? *Yes*
Do I smoke dank ass weed? *Yes!*
So I'm kind of sorting out my problems... bought condoms
Got latex for that safe sex I'll never have
Keep falling in love with crazy bitches
So I'mma flame this swisher and get prop with the pen and pad
Now I feel it!
Nonchalant with my collabs 'bout to kill it
Manipulate more minds even though my mouth is still, bitch
I know what I know
And I don't feel you bruh
I've seen the water rise
Recedes when Martyrs die
I'm a loser now but wait for my fate
To take me to that place where I can blaze with the greats
And escape...

Hook

Punch out ya damn teeth x7
Punch 'em out x3

(Nonchalant)
