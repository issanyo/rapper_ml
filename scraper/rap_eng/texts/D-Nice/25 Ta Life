It was a hot summer day, I was dyin from the heat
Walkin up 118th street
Although I'm hot like stew
In the back of my mind it was a bottle of brew
Now a ice cold bottle would just quench my thirst
Or get some boom from the dread, which ever one comes first
Now is it brew? (yeah) or is it boom? (yeah)
So I lit up the boom and now may I presume? (yeah)
Now about 3 o'clock I had to meet my crew
I looked at my watch and then I noticed it was half past 2
I saw these two honeys walkin down the avenue
And one of them said: all I think about is havin you
Now in my mind I realized I coulda took her, coulda took her
But Nice is not the one to treat the ladies like a hooker
Don't mean to diss, but it's not on my list
So I gave her a kiss and said: ehm, good-bye, miss
From the streets I heard a horn beep
There was a crew 4 deep in a dark blue jeep
I heard em speak, he said: my ride is fat
So why you're sweatin D-Nice, baby, he ain't all that
Now first things first, why all the rude behaviour
You shoulda been taught how to respect this flavor
He jumped out the jeep like yo, what up chief
But I don't eat pork, so I guess he wanted beef
I realized I was on my own
I didn't proceed to make a move until a blow was thrown
He swung but missed, I caught him with a fist
Although I wish it didn't have to come to this
I started breakin him down with the speed, had him astounded
The right caught his jaw and it sounded
Like boom boom bap boom bam
He had no idea that D was nice with his hands
He stepped back, so I thought he was through
But right about now up steps his crew
We all threw down and went round for round
I'm givin it all I had to give until I fell face down

They proceeded to stomp but in all of the madness
Somehow someway I was damn sure glad this
Person slid me a pistol from behind
Not the weasel, pop-pop-pop goes the 9
So if you're wonderin why you ain't heard word of them
I (murder them murder them)
But since I pulled the trigger I guess I have to pay the price
Pushin 25 to life
