[Intro: D Nice (Sample)]
(My name is D Nice, my name is D Nice
My name, my name is D Nice
My name is D Nice
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it)
Yo, this is D-Nice and I'm about to drop some funky lyrics on this track I made up, you know what I'm saying, huh, yea and you don't stop, yo

[Verse 1: D Nice]
My name is D-Nice although I hate to admit it
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it
See every episode remains in this mode
Very cool, very calm, there's no sweat in my palm
I just pick up the mic, proceed with a song
I get right to the point, my competition's not long or short
It's like a sport hanging in the middle
But now if you're puzzled, let me kick the whole riddle
That my name is Derrick and if I didn't mention
D-Nice is just a description
It describes the kid on the mic
I'm the TR-808, huh, but just call me D-Nice

[Chorus]
My name is D Nice
Take, ta-take, taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

[Verse 2: D Nice]
I start to think, a very big conscious all around me
Who will be the sucker MC to try to doubt me
Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or him
But I'm like a tree and every lyric is a limb
You throw it on the turntable, very unstable
But you gamble because you need that example
There's a 1000 MC's on the planet earth now
What is the word you say to get hers
Some like to explain, some talk educated
Some like McBoo, he's X-rated
I like to think of myself as a pure rebel
A radical thinker on a musical level
Cause suckers want to stop me and girls want to kiss
Wherever I go, yo, it seems I can't be dissed
Cause my name is D-Nice but all the girls call me Derrick
It ran through my crew so I guess I've inherit
The job of explaining and also retaining
The fact D-Nice is remaining
Not a king nor a prince but as a teacher
With dope beats like this, I know I'm gonna reach ya
So now I don't think you should all despise
This fact D-Nice is on a rise
Straight to the top like a bubble of water
It's a slaughter so I think you oughta
Think realistically, not egotistically
It's suicide if you even think of dissing me
Cause if you try, I'm a make you wait
To learn the reason I'm the 808, but just call me D-Nice

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: D Nice]
I live in the Bronx by the D and the 4
Writing lyrics, it's addictive, writing more and more and more
About peace, about wars, about whores
Breaking city laws to me become a chore
I wear no jeri curls but I still pull girls
I don't slur my words when I rap cause that's wack, huh
But in fact, I do not slack
When I drop the funky, funky lyric on a track
I'm not conceited when I walk the streets
And you can tell by the words that I speak
That I'm not just another brother on the mic
Cause the females love me and they call me D-Nice

[Chorus]
