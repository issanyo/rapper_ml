Featuring KRS-One

Intro: KRS-One

Bo bo bo! How many times I gotta tell you man? D-Nice, number one
Lyracist out here in the world today. All the suckers that want to
Perpetrate the fraud must come correct! Know what I'm saying? This
Is KRS-One from the massive BDP crew. And of course we are doing it
Just for you. The styles are from 1990, and 1991 and 1992. So we
Gonna break it down a little something like this, check it out

Chorus: KRS-One
I say the TR-808 is coming, bright and early in the morning
I say the TR-808 is coming, but you see that is daily living

Verse One: D-Nice
I-I'm D-Nice the 808 it's no mistake
Now this is not the time but the music that I make
And wait, I'm telling you, why don't you just listen
Just because I come from the Bronx I'm not dissing or wishing
Cause the beat sounds groovy
I drink Ammoretta on the rocks cause it cools me off
And usually when I am speaking
I usually wear a cap and gown when I'm teaching
Or reaching out, huh, to touch someone
I'm rocking on the microphone just to have fun
So run (Bo bo bo!) cause I'm number one
And if you want to battle me then pull out a gun
Don't forget the ammo-nition and listen
Don't ever bite a lyric cause then you're pissing me off
And with the style that I'm bringing
The girls love it, and of course, girls I'm swinging
And seeing (Bo bo bo!) I left the girls' hearts broken
Now I'm back to tell you all I'm not joking
And I'm hoping you see that I'm the main topic
You put me in the wildest crowd and I'm a rock it

Chorus

Outro: KRS-One

Yes man, you see every time of the week BDP rules! You know what I'm saying?
My man D-Nice in the house producing up his own album this time in 1990. How
Many of you suckers out there can get with that? Ha ha, you know what I'm
Saying? I'm not gonna give no shoutouts on this record because the whole BDP
Crew know who down and who ain't down, so if you not down, throw your hands in
The air if you ain't down. Ha ha, suckers! We fresh for 1990 as usual. My man
D-Nice wrecking the parties, wrecking the females, wrecking the clubs all over
The country. London, Japan, Germany, everywhere on the planet we rule. Get it
Through your head once and for all. My name is KRS-One, I'm outta here. Peace!
