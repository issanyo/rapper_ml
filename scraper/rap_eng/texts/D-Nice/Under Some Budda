I meant to do that
Ha ha ha ha!

I was coolin' at a jam with my boys in Nelson Park
Up in the Bronx where the suckers get stomped
It was me, Reef, James, Bob, and McBoo
Hundreds plus the 64th Street crew
We was coolin', but I was tryin' to debate
Should I pick up the mic but a sucker went "Wait"
He asked me if I was D-Nice the 808
I said "Yeah, and get the hell outta my face"
He claimed he was the greatest MC and ready to throw
His DJ cut up a break beat and whatta ya know
He picked up the microphone and these
Played out rhymes that went out like striped Lees, huh
He said "Huh!" and I said "Yo"
Take those rhymes and give 'em back to Kurtis Blow
'Cause these ain't the breaks and I hold the weight
To try and challenge me and my crew is a mistake
You must be...

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Break

Ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha

So I picked up the microphone and got live
He was confused and had his hand by his side
McBoo laughed and James knew the time
And Hundreds and Reef had their hands on the nine
They was waitin' for his crew to approach me
They made a move but my crew was watching closely
Boo said "Yo, allow me to diss you"
"Make another move and you'll be swallowin' a pistol"
"What did you think, before you stepped up?"
He mumbled somethin' smart and James said "Shutup"
He said "Shutup? Who made you chief?"
He laughed and Reef put the gun to his teeth
His crew ran and he was left alone
Beggin' and prayin' hopin' he could go home
Now what did he have to mess with me the 808?
To try and challenge me and my crew is a mistake
You must be...

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Now I'm whatya call D-Nice, the 808
I'm for real and you know I'm no fake
I go do a show travel, from state to state
And any rapper who tries me is the rapper that I'll break
I love to have a candlelight dinner at eight
Prefer to take a nice young lady on a date
I may eat fish but I could never eat steak
So when you cook me dinner don't put it on my plate
When I find a girl I'ma call her my mate
I love to make love, but I never ever rate
I stand alone and hold my own weight
To try and challenge me and my crew is a mistake
You must be...

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda

Under some budda

Under some budda

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda

Under some budda

Under some budda

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it

Under some budda, be under some budda
Under some budda, be under it
