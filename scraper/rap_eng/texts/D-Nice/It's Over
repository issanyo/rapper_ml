[Verse 1]
I wanna get it straight about this girl I loved
I know she was sent from the heavens above
Just to make me happy when I am down
But I felt bad when she wasn’t around
Now this all happened ‘cause of jealousy
By this one girl who I couldn’t believe
Started spreading all these rumors making me look bad
My reputation was threw, and she was glad
Talkin’ ‘bout things I’ve done, or would have did
The girls that I have, the love I couldn’t give
The time that I spared, the love that I share
And all together, it means I would not care
I didn’t understand, I was the talk of the town
I realized why she put me down
I found it all quite shocking, I was quite surprised
I once loved a girl who I now despise
But it’s over now

[Chorus: Dawnn Lewis]
It’s over now…it’s over now
It’s over now…It’s over, it is over now

[Verse 2]
It’s over, between the love that kept us together for a while
Since the time we met
Between a love that showed if we really cared
It’s like something came and burned out the flare
Like walking down the street that has no light
With no one there to hold you tight
And no one there to share your love, honey
And no one warm to kiss at night
But I’m sorry it happened the way it did
But I got my own life to live
And if there was a chance we can be together
I’ll try to make this one last forever (it’s over now)
But it’s not, and I wonder why
And now she tells me, “D-Nice, goodbye” (bye, baby)
But she cries remembering when we said we can be friends ‘til the end
But baby, it’s over now

[Chorus: Dawnn Lewis]
It’s over now…it’s over now
It’s over now…It’s over, it’s all over now

Break it down

[Verse 3]
Talkin’ ‘bout things I’ve done, or would have did
The girls that I have, the love I couldn’t give
The time that I spared, the love that I share
And all together, it means I would not care
I didn’t understand, I was the talk of the town
I realized why she put me down
I found it all quite shocking, I was quite surprised
I once loved a girl who I now despise
But it’s over now

[Chorus: Dawnn Lewis]
It’s over now…it’s over now
It’s over now…It’s over, it’s all over
It’s over now…it’s over now
It’s over now…It’s over, it’s all over now
It’s over now…it’s over now
It’s over now…It’s over, it’s all over
It’s over now…it’s over now
It’s over now…It’s over, it’s all over now
