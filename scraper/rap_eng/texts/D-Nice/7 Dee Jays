[KRS-One]
YES! Chillin in the place right now
Harmony and Heather B, Ms. Melodie
DJ Jamal-Ski, DJ Kenny Parker
And of course we are gettin MUCH DARKER
Because the Africanism is in EFFECT
So check it out, MAN!
And try not to bite the lyrics
POI!

So come in now with the chorus of the day
Because we don't play

[Chorus: KRS-One]
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
It takes one soundsystem playin music loud
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
But D-Nice, you're gonna make the party live

[Verse One: D-Nice]
Bust it, yo
I love to diss whores, I love to do tours
Makin young ladies just drop their drawers
And when they drop em, I don't kick em, check it
Like the Fat Boys said, I "Brrrrrrrr, STICK EM!"
From that point on, I say we're on for the night
But I love it when the girl just call me D-Nice
And if she gets bold and try to ask for a fee
I say, "Please ho, it's all about me"

[Verse Two: Heather B]
It's not the star spangled banner or the red white and blue
But the underground sister from the Edutainment Crew
So what you do, is back up if you work for Bush
Cause all the Presidential prison pushin politicians
Gotta get MUSHED, gimme back my land you SUCKA
You beat down my father and you raped my mother Africa
And now you wanna laugh at her
I feel like pickin up a razor, and slashin ya
Snatch up Margaret Thatcher and unmaskin her
To find out she's a man without a manicure
Go to President DeKlerk without askin her
And BUST SOME SHOTS for South Africa
And if Margaret jumps in, I start bashin her
For every freedom fighter start crashin her
And then Heather B will get nastier
And pull out my two shot derringer
Cause yes, Heather B comes classier
Cause Heather B, Jamal-Ski, and KRS the trainer
Makes up the dope crew called, Edutainer
You'll find the law of balance on the two turntables
So look out for the FRESH Edutainer label

[Break: KRS-One]
Biddi-by-by, by, by-by-by, Jamal-Ski, ki-ki-kiyah!

[Verse Three: Jamal-Ski] {best guess}
Jump up and be upon the mic and stick em
Come follow me the man me work for the mic

That moves with the rhythm passionately
I ain't ego trippin I do it humbly
Cause everybody's bound to hear the sound of BDP

And three (badda-ba-ba-by-by) it's the magic numberrr
(badda-ba-ba-by-by)

[Chorus: KRS-One]
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
It takes one soundsystem playin music loud
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
But KRS, you're gonna make the party live

[Verse Five: KRS-One]
Well now it's Blastmaster KRS-One
When we come in the dance, my lyrics not done
Pray to my father cause yes me are the son
Cause you are the guide and my pro-tection
Any sucker MC must run come
Kyan't test the Boogie Down Production man
Move ya ras claat, BDP stand alone
1990 lyrics 'pon the microphone
Every posse KNOW we come in the dance
We teach reality-ta-tee an'
Reality, reality-ta-ta-tee
We nah deal with sickness and negativity
We come up in the dance in the ruff stylee
In the discipline KRS-One is just a flyer
Come up in the dance with my man called Edi Ayah
On the con-sole we have the man D-Square
Come up in the dance, and him must comb him hair-ah
Come up in the dance, and me let off a clip-ah
At George Bush, cause him D my nigga

Ms. M-E-L-O-D-I-E on the mic check
Well I'm up in your face like the wind from a blizzard
Got my wrap around your throat, like you're chokin on a gizzard
If someone said, well damn, who is it?
It's Ms. Melodie, the real, so get with it

[Verse Seven: Jamal-Ski]
Fatalistic pessimistic, a big conspiracy
The way they treat blacks, in white society
It's erection rebellion, revolution uprisin
Takin no shorts, because JAH is guidin
Government they try to manage and rule
Dictate, regulate, and perpetrate the fool
That's why I search, explore, inspect, investigate
Drop down knowledge, and KILL dub plates

[Verse Eight: KRS-One]
Kill dub plate-ah mi say kill dub plate-ah
Kill dub plate-ah mi say kill dub plate-ah
KRS-One, boy, must come fi straighter
Comin up and doin the dance but not from eighty-eight-ah
Every posse know me come in the dance not later
Come in early, every posse captivator

Come up in the dance, and we cannot debate-ah

Close the book, pick up your gun
And fight in the African revolution
Righteous man, get liberation
Wicked man get execution
It's called the battle of armageddeon
Through my mouth is a translation
Unto recknoning to circulation
Nuff African education
DJ Kenny Parker YES you are the don
Edutainer teach nuff wisdom
