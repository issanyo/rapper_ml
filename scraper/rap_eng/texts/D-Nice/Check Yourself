[Intro: D Nice, (Too $hort)]
You know $hort
A lot of people out there want to be my friend, you know
Just because I got a little hit record out, you know I'm sayin'

(I know, I know, rap groupies, you know haha)

Definitely rap groupies
You know what I'm sayin?
Yo, we should do a little somethin for 'em, you know

(Check em, let's just check em, check em real quick)

Let's check em, man

[Hook]
I know that you are out for my wealth
You better just check yourself
Cause in these days we don't go for that
So you better try someone else
I know that you are out for my wealth
You better just check yourself
Cause in these days we don't go for that
So you better try someone else

[Verse 1: D Nice]
Now I can recall the first time I was out on tour
With my boy Too $hort, leavin' everyone in awe
I met this little honey, she said, "Hi, my name is Bunny"
I never would have thought she was out for my money
Now she appeared to me to be smart and legit
Equipped with hips that'll break your whole shit
But before that I can get a chance to knock it
The goldigger's goldiggin' in my pocket
First she tried to say that she was playin'
She musta thought I was a fool cause she was sayin'
"Ugh, oh D-Nice, I want you, I want you"
I wouldn't try to trust her even if I want to
I wanted just to smack her in the face
But hittin' females is just a bad mistake
I guess tryin' to get your money is a hobby or a sport
Cause next she tried to kick it to my boy Too $hort


[Verse 2: Too $hort]
It's kinda funny, you want money from a pimp
(Biatch) you're thinkin' like fifty percent
I put my foot in your ass and then I owe you the rest
I know the game, hoe, cause I'm the best
Playin' broads ain't based on luck
You want money? I want to fuck
And after we do all that
I'm takin' my money back
Biatch, kiss my pimpin' ass
Cause all the time I didn't have this cash
You wouldn't call, wouldn't give me a number
I couldn't see ya like Stevie Wonder
I made a hit record, now I got money
You want to play Short Dog for a dummy
You're so cool cause you think I'm rich
You know you want to be my bitch
I'm not single, baby, not for you
Fuck a bitch, and that's the goddamn truth
If I was you, I wouldn't hold my breath
Cause all you money-hungry hoes might starve to death

[Hook]
I know that you are out for my wealth
You better just check yourself
Cause in these days we don't go for that
So you better try someone else
I know that you are out for my wealth
You better just check yourself
Cause in these days we don't go for that
So you better try someone else

[Scratching]

[Verse 3: D Nice]
Now I'm not tryin' to come down too hard
If you need some money, you should go and get a job
But this one does not go out to all women
Just those who try to kick game for a livin'
Cause I'm not the one to be played
So don't step to me when you want to get paid
Cause you're the type of woman that survives on greed
Yo $hort, won't you tell her what she needs

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
What you need is some type of financial support
You won't get shit from your boy Too $hort
I don't pay bitches and never will
I'm too busy tryin to pay my bills
I understand your reason for tryin'
But I been mackin since '79
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself
Short Dog's in the muthafuckin house, bitch

[Hook]
I know that you are out for my wealth
You better just check yourself
Cause in these days we don't go for that
So you better try someone else
I know that you are out for my wealth
You better just check yourself
Cause in these days we don't go for that
So you better try someone else
