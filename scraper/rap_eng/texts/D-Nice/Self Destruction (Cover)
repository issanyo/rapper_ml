Beshoon neshoon meedeem ba mal

Dutchess
They got a problem with you
They got a problem with me
They say that black lives matter
Well I just don’t see
Black boys laying dead in the middle of the street
How long will it be before I rest in peace

Mychelle Lee
(Ah ah ah ahhhh)
Unnnhh what a time that we living in
Your biggest sin being
All about the Benjamins
No pot to piss in
But focused on a mention
Your self respect diminished
If you had it to begin with

Lil Sleepy
Chikity check yourself
Before you wreck yourself
Lil sleepy gon’ teach em a lesson
Don’t self destruct
I’m dodging the police
Scared they gon’ beat me mistreat me
Leave me leaking in D.C
Man I hope it don’t get like the TV

Miss Gray
My, people I love you boo

How can we fight injustice
I don’t think they listening to me
Katrina tell’ em something

Kenilworth Katrina and Vivid

Hook

Slim Jenkinz and Juda Trufe
Seems like every situation is a lituation
Instead of turning up
We need to turn up on some innovation
And how we need less hate
More unity, more leaders
Less dope boys, and trap queens
And more teachers
Instead of you worrying about the
Flick of the (flick of the) wrist
Flipping and flipping the bricks
Ripping and running
Hitting the strip with the clip
Hitting the prettiest chicks
Wake up pay attention
We slaves to our society
Prison system using our black men
As a commodity

Royal Cash
’84 black baby
Crack era was crazy
Told us we was free
But its modern day slavery
Walking generations killing black kids
And they calling us racist
(WHAT!?)

Uptown Shane
L-M-S-C!
What they saying what they saying
11:11, they say they walk but they playing
Law, law, law!
Find your loudness in silence
Find your light behind your eyelids
Fly wherever
You the pilot!

Keylow Black
Police done did it again
Strip a queen all the way down
Send me back to the pin
Guaranteed me and my queenz
Yea we gon’ win
The only way we getting out our anger
Is straight through this pen

Sonic Boom
Pop, pop, pop
Another one shot by the cops
Death toll off the Richter
And the rich will make a profit
Black people we can stop it
We can million man march
Yo Styles, tell them how to flip
This poverty to profit

Styles Montana
Annihilation most are facing
Without a proper cause
Trying to fix population growth
In a world that's ours
Scars are deep
More than the police in these streets
We out here killing one another
Like we behind white sheets

Betty Bipolar
But you don’t see it
You hitting on me beating on me
But you ain’t ready for what’s going on
In these real streets
I wear all this Maybeline
Trying to cover this up
But I really want to know
Why we bout to Self Destruct

Hook

Solo
Hands up, hands up
We telling ‘em don’t shoot
Old Queens straight work
We killing ‘em in the booth
It’s a U-N-I-T-Y that’s unity
Spittin’ all this Sojourner Truth
Murder scene

Grynd
You can’t change the world until
You change yourself
Got the government telling lies
While distorting our health
Heres the wealth
We got the power all in our self
If we just get up off the gram
And read a book off the shelf

Mafia Twins
As-salāmu ʿalaykum
Mahum didilau
The Mafia Twinz got a message for ya’ll
We tired of going to janazah's
When somebody get popped
We need all this madness in the world to stop
(bang bang)

Kristie Yamagucci
Black power’s what I’m promoting every hour
Filtration, in position and them bastards born cowards
Retaliation 'cuz I’m black and I’m proud
And every time we make a move
We got ‘em jacking our style
But, they hate us and our intelligent minds
They couldn’t take it even if we shared the same demise
Or we could gain plato colors
That’s the story of life
We the majority
I be damned if I do slavery twice

We the majority
I be damned if I do slavery twice

Choppa Locka
U-n-i-t-y is what the queen talk
But we killing ourselves
And we killing our kids
We living life through the glory
Of a piece of steel
When we got’ realize that black lives matter
And not only when the white man pull the trigger
United we stand
Divided we fall
And if we all stand together
They ain’t taking us all
They ain’t taking us all

Roe B
Everybody quick to screen black lives matter
But ya kill another brother just to make your pockets fatter
You going back to prison
They claiming that they miss ‘em but
Ya just another brother falling victim to the system
Just another slave through mass incarceration
Now ya adding to the cash of a mass incorporation
AIn’t no family structure
Now call that self destruction

Just another slave through mass incarceration
Now ya adding to the cash of a mass incorporation
Now ain’t no family structure
Now call that self destruction
