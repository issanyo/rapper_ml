Thats My A1 Girl
You know thats my A1 Girl

[Verse 1: Just Rich Gates]
Got Gucci on
Got Louie On
Gots to know that J Rich
Pull up in my A1 whip
Hop out with my A1 Bitch
Jeremy Scott adidas
Gots to them my A1 Kicks
200 Shoes I got stupid picks
Im Sneaker-head I get super head
Sniper shots call her infrared
Thats my A1 Bitch
She down for that nasty shit
Gutta Shit
Got Bread for that butter shit
Like Tommy Buns Im taking extra trips
Like Judge Dredd I got extra clips
Temptations for my girl
Montana Rich give her the world
Ima Nike Boy so you know I keep that check on her
Crossing up the mall with this cash Im balling like the Spurs
Last supper with these racks , I be breaking bread
Smash my shawty down till I break the bed
