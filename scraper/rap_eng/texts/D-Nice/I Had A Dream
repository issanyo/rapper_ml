[Intro]

(Dr. Martin Luther King's I Have A Dream)
I have a dream this afternoon
That the brotherhood of man will become a reality
In this day
In this (?), we will be able to achieve this new day
When all of God's children
Black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles
Protestants and Catholic, will be able to join hands
And sing with the negros in the spiritual (?)
Free at last, free at last
Great God Almighty, we are free at last

Ohhhh

I have a dream

[Verse 1]

I had a dream
We all came together in harmony
Sharing much love (Ohhh)
It was crazy
We was loving eachother in unity
The only problem, I woke up outta my sleep, no, no

(Chorus)
Last night, I had a crazy dream
The world we live in was in peace and harmony
Please tell me what we must do
To make my dream come true
Ohhhh

I have a dream

[Verse 2]

I had a dream
There was no war or poverty
In this world we live in (Ohhh)
Peaceful world, hand in hand, each boy and girl
(And then something happened) I woke up outta my sleep!
Tell me why

(Chorus)
Last night, I had a crazy dream (I had a dream)
The world we live in was in peace and harmony (Harmony)
Please tell me what we must do
To make my dream come true (Somebody tell me what do)
Ohhhh (I gotta make my dream come true)

Last night, I had a crazy dream (I had a dream)
The world we live in was in peace and harmony (Harmony)
Please tell me what we must do
To make my dream come true
Ohhhh


(Excerpt of I've Been to the Mountaintop)
So I'm happy tonight, I'm not worried about anything
I'm not fearing any man!
Mine eyes have seen the glory!

[Rap breakdown]
Can you
Picture a land where every man
Stands as one, hand in hand
As the sun, shines brightly
I dream one day this might be
Destruction of the negativity among the people
The positivity without a doubt will keep us equal
Peace and harmony is the thing
We must work together as a team
Ya know what I mean?
D-Nice is on the scene and (I have a dream)

(Chorus)
(Last night) Last night, I had a crazy dream
(I had a dream) The world we live in was in peace and harmony
Please tell me what we must do
To make my dream come true (We can make it, we can do it)
Ohhhh

(Say it again) Last night, I had a crazy dream
(I had a dream) The world we live in was in peace and harmony
(Peace and harmony) Please tell me what we must do
To make my dream come true (Make it come true)
Ohhhh

(It's up to me and you) Last night, I had a crazy dream
(There's something we can do)
(Come on, come on)
The world we live in was in peace and harmony
Please tell me what we must do
To make my dream come true (We can make a better world)
Ohhhh (If we try)

Last night, I had a crazy dream (We shall overcome)
The world we live in was in peace and harmony
Please tell me what we must do
To make my dream come true
Ohhhh

(Dr. King's I Have A Dream)
I have a dream this afternoon
That the brotherhood of man will become a reality in this day
When we say
Black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles
Protestants and Catholic, will be able to join hands
Free at last, free at last
Great God Alighty
We are free at last
