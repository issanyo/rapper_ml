[Verse 1]
You're like a wave, pulling me deeper every time you go
No longer your slave, no longer thinkin' about us
You feel me from your maze, following the crumbs that lead me to him
No longer in your haze, no longer thinkin' about us

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been trying, trying to make sense of it all
How the sense of your touch, it is my only floor
'Cause I've been trying, trying to fall out of love with you
Out of spite of everything you do
We're no longer "Us"

[Bridge]
We're no longer "Us", we're no longer "Us"
We're no longer "Us", we're no longer "Us"
We're no longer "Us", we're no longer "Us"
We're no longer "Us"
We're no longer "Us", we're no longer "Us"
We're no longer "Us", we're no longer "Us"

[Verse 2]
You're like the sun burning and leaving your mark on me
You've never been unturn, but I've outgrown us
He was my saving grace, finding a key that you threw away
It was never your place, but we're no longer "Us"

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been trying, trying to make sense of it all
How the sense of your touch, is my only floor
'Cause I've been trying, trying to fall out of love with you
Out of spite of everything you do
We're no longer "Us"

[Outro]
We're no longer "Us"
