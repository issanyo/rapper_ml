[Verse 1]
It's so hard, waiting for the lights to go out
My time was wasting on your own self-doubt
And I would give it all, give it all for us to go back to what we were
Before it all, before it all drove you into the arms of her

[Verse 2]
Black and white, we lost a fight to each other
Your hands grinned around my neck, only hear the smother
You left your mark, left your mark on my skin but it sinks deep within
You lit a spark, lit a spark, but blew it out before we could begin

[Chorus]
You were hard to find and peace of mind, you've taken over control
Caught up in you, didn't think this through, you've taken over control
You were hard to find and peace of mind, you've taken over control
Caught up in you, didn't think this through, you've taken over control
You were hard to find and peace of mind, you've taken over control
Caught up in you, didn't think this through, you've taken over control
You were hard to find and peace of mind, you've taken over control
Caught up in you, didn't think this through, you've taken over control

[Outro]
You've taken over control
You've taken over control
