Summertime is coming
Can’t wait for it to kick in
Summertime is coming
Coming our way

Now i’ve been on my best behaviour
For months and months when it was cold
I can't be an angel on the dancefloor
With sunlight at an all year low
So take the night and make it major
Catch a lady and start the show
Let me hear you sing this record
Just impress me with your flow

The sight of fresh green on the trees
Is the type of good news that i needed
Bringing me out of hibernation
Bringing an end to my frustration

Summertime is coming
Can’t wait for it to kick in
Summertime is coming
Summertime is coming
Can’t wait for it to kick in
Coming our way

Now i’ve been on my best behaviour
For months and months when it was cold
I can't be an angel on the dancefloor
With sunlight at an all year low
So take the night and make it major
Catch a lady and start the show
Let me hear you sing this record
Just impress me with your flow
