[Chorus]
I walked away to let
Go of my shame to find
My way home
You asked me to stay
And take the blame
But you never ever felt like
Home

With your deep dark eyes
No need to apologize
You pull me in you won me
Over

With your foolish games
You never knew my name
Never let me in never gave me
Closure

[Chorus]
I walked away to let
Go of my shame to find
My way home
You asked me to stay
And take the blame
But you never ever felt like
Home

You are nothing but lust
Nothing was ever enough
You took it all took me for granted

Each time we tried
We were always reminded why
Why we were wrong why were stranded

[Chorus]
I walked away to let
Go of my shame to find
My way home
You asked me to stay
And take the blame
But you never ever felt like
Home

[Chorus]
I walked away to let
Go of my shame to find
My way home
You asked me to stay
And take the blame
But you never ever felt like
Home

(Home...)
