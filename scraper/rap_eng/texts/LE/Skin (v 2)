It's so hard
Waiting
For the lights to go out

My time was
Wasted
On your own self doubt

And i would give it all
Give it all for us to go back to what we were

Before it all
Before it all drove you into the arms of her

Black and white
We lost the fight to each other

Your hands gripped around my neck
Hold me here to smother

You left your mark
Left your mark on my skin
But it sinks
Deep within

You lit a spark
Lit a spark but i blew it out before we could begin

---You were hard to find
---Your piece of mind
---You've taken over control

---Caught up in you
---Didn't think this through
---You've taken over control      ---x4

You've taken over control
You've taken over control
