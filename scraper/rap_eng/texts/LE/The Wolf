[Verse 1]
You run like a wolf, like the cold blood through my veins
Picking up speed as the drugs overtake my brain
You howl like a wolf, like the sound in my heart
Howling for love, howling for a brand new start
Falling out and falling down
This lone wolf can survive in this lonely town
Apart from you, I don't want to go
But there's nothing else for me here anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
How can you say that I'll be okay without your love
Should be enough to guide me through this maze
And I won't stray and I won't lose my way
And I won't stray and I won't lose my way
I will keep running with the wolves

[Outro]
The wolves, the wolves
