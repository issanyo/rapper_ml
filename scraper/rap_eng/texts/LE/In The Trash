[Intro: Rietti]
Do you ever wonder what they’ll write on your gravestone?
Some of just throw this life away, wasting it on meaningless highs
Why dont you cover ground… Before ground covers you?

[Chorus: Rietti]
Throw this life, in the trash
Marriages failing, business crashed
So I throw this life in the trash
I’ll take anything you give me, I’m simply rash

[Verse 1: MC Dave]
Inhale a few puffs, it all slows down
Can’t get enough it’s a little too much
Your eyes go red, you need to be fed
Next think you know, your running from the fed
Come next morning, your thinking ahead
What can I take to make me break?
Screw reality its one big fantasy
Everything you see is not meant to be, what
You see is me feeling free
Fading away, trying to hit the top
Then rock bottom, start all over
This guy calls me, in his range rover
Comes a little closer then slows down
Next thing I know, I’m home
Doing a line of coke alone

[Chorus: Rietti]
Throw this life, in the trash
Marriages failing, business crashed
So I throw this life in the trash
I’ll take anything you give me, I’m simply rash

[Verse 2: L.E]
Once knew a boy used to act like a man
Fifteen years old sold his sold for a gram
Sold his soul for the strip, making dough with a break
Couldn't hold down school so he’s holding a clip
Damn, man what a life
Zip lock bag and a gram full of white
Big shot bangs that he gives for the ice
He’s awake for the day but he lives for the night
Smoke weed from the age of twelve
Coke, Lean, MDMA as well
Push trees every day for his G’s he’d sell
Living heaven on earth on his way to hell
But maybe he was made to be
He had no dad from the age of three
His mum went mad for a way to free
So puffing and smoke was her way to breathe
And thats the only life he knew
The cards your dealt sometimes ain’t fair
There’s irony in the way he moves
The more weight he pushed the more weight he bears

[Chorus: Rietti]
Throw this life, in the trash
Marriages failing, business crashed
So I throw this life in the trash
I’ll take anything you give me, I’m simply rash

[Verse 3: Rietti]
Don’t get it twisted, I ain’t dissing the addicts
Insult to injury? There’s enough on their palettes!
I’m writing ‘em a ballad so I’m raising a chalice
Some of them are derelicts neglected by bad parents
I ain’t judging, I’ve never taken a puff
But your young now why go making it rough
Destroying your body with stuff making it tough
Like Kryptonite to superman, when he’s drugged
Locked in our rooms yeah we both do lines
But you do the white type and I do rhymes
Come off it! Hell I get a high off it
And hell yeah of course I make a nice profit
An addict’s goal in life isn’t about living
Always getting higher, just about existing
True those tokes might give you a sick trippin
But you may as well shoot yourself with a Smith Wesson
Its dum to smoke this, do you notice
The effects of your actions when overdosed and hopeless?
You never know next week you could have roses
On your tombstone for being too-stoned and yet you throw this

[Chorus: Rietti]
Throw this life, in the trash
Marriages failing, business crashed
So I throw this life in the trash
I’ll take anything you give me, I’m simply rash

Throw this life, in the trash
Marriages failing, business crashed
So I throw this life in the trash
I’ll take anything you give me, I’m simply rash

Throw this life, in the trash
Marriages failing, business crashed
So I throw this life in the trash
I’ll take anything you give me, I’m simply rash

In the trash… In the trash… In the trash
