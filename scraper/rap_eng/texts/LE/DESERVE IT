CHORUS

I know i say alot things i can't do..

I know ive said alot things i can't  prove but...

But i would do it all  for you.. even when wishes never really come true..

Gave it your all i didn't  ask you..

Figured the  person that i needed was you

So baby girl come through ..

Let me give something that you ain't never knew

Just know you're the one who deserves it..

You the one that gives me purpose today

You the one who deserves it

Don't you ever for a secondd think I'd leave

You the one who deserves it

Still the one the gives me purpose (Oh yeah)

You are my soulmate 

(Everything, My Everything)



VERSE

Who would have thought that I'd really ever get you..from what ive seen my baby   you hen came through ...

All the things we been through..the type of situations we then went through..

Got you all your  in moods..telling me that im rude...through the trail and trabultions baby  we then broke through


..I will never ever leave your side.. give me all the reasons why i  provide

All this time all this love...we act up then make up..

Since we know we gotta hold on tight..and everything will always  be alright....

All these words that i speak at times they get you weaker than weakeast link

Im talking poetry that sweep of your feet


Im taking rose petals and a diamond ring (Yeah)


Don't  you ever listen to all out opponents

Cause all they wanna do is break the love component

Don't you ever feel like we are never growing..

Cause everything that's natured slowly becomes a  holy
