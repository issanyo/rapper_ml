[Verse 1]
It's not what it used to be
No youth, no love, no trust
Our innocence was left in the past
With the idea of us

[Chorus]
Hold on, we're coming up short
Hold on, we're not who we were
Hold on, we're too far off shore
Hold on, I don't need this anymore

[Verse 2]
And my shadow isn't apart of me
Oh, it hides in the darkness of your heart
And you took what you wanted
And you pulled me apart

[Chorus]
Hold on, we're coming up short
Hold on, we're not who we were
Hold on, we're too far off shore
Hold on, I don't need this anymore
