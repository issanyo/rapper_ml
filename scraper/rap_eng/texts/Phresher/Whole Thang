[Chorus]
Whole thang, whole thang, whole thang
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (byatch)
My name Harry in the streets boy
I'm bout to tell you what you need boy
Got the game on a leash boy
My niggas looking for a feast boy
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)

[Verse 1]
Damn right I want the whole thang
Especially with a PH that's my whole name
I swear to god these niggas so lame
They on this bitch, I play the whole game
Bitch I'm balling like Lebron James
Won't stop till I sell out the gold day
That bitch ain't gotta speak up on every propane
I hear you falling off when I hit a rollie
Come get your one and only stolen
Eat a pussy up like it's Lo Mein
Rip my shirt up like I'm Hogan
Then beat the pussy till its swollen

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn I ain't got no chill boy (I ain't got no chill boy)
The game always tryna kill somethin (always tryna kill something)
Evel Knievel cause I'm still stuntin' (cause I'm still stuntin')

[Chorus]
Whole thang, whole thang, whole thang
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (biatch)
My name Harry in the streets boy
I'm bout to tell you what you need boy
Got the game on a leash boy
My niggas looking for a feast boy
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)

[Verse 2]
My money still flipping like an acrobat
Bitch why you just eat and ganging there's nothing after that
Niggas can't see me they got cataracts
Don't let problems escalate I ain't no Cadillac
See me in the streets they be like there he go
Keep one eye open like I'm Fetty though
You cash like the gated home, I'm ready though
Turn your brains to spaghetti-O
My god, my god
Ain't nobody out here fucking with my squad
Ain't nobody out here  as chill as me as real as me
When they talking bout the greatest
They consider me

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn I ain't got no chill boy (I ain't got no chill boy)
The game always tryna kill somethin (always tryna kill something)
Evel Knievel cause I'm still stuntin' (cause I'm still stuntin')

[Chorus]
Whole thang, whole thang, whole thang
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (biatch)
My name Harry in the streets boy
I'm bout to tell you what you need boy
Got the game on a leash boy
My niggas looking for a feast boy
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (the whole thang)
Fuck half, I want the whole thang (I want the whole thang)
