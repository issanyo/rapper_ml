[Verse 2]
If you ain't rapping you ain't got no haters
Ladies love us niggas gotta hate us
At the bottom yall did nominate us
Every time I get serviced by the waiter
Alligator shoes and crocodile
Gotta make my mom and poppa proud
Bad bitch from the Wallace
Hit it from the back chopper style
Word to Master P Miller
Hang with nothing but gorillas
Hang with nothing but some childs
Hang with nothing but some dealers
My flow crack like hard white
Your shit sound alright
I can tell you had a hard life
Niggas know PH gone like

[Chorus]
I'm popping, I'm popular (popular)
I'm popping, I'm popular (biatch)

I'm popping, I'm popular (popular)
I'm popping, I'm popular (biatch)
I'm popping, I'm popular (popular)
I'm popping, I'm popular (biatch)
This ain't no charity
Got nobody to carry me
Moment of clarity
I'm popular on my popularity
