[Intro: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Really, really, same image
Only fuck with real street niggas
In the kitchen, whippin' chickens
Mixin' chemicals like a chemist
Apartment buildin' servin' tenants
They catch a case, take a sentence
Ain't want no names get mentioned
Don't fuck with no lames or no snitchin'
I'm making flips like a gymnast
I'm balling hard like Emmitt
This bank card got no limits
You ain't ballin', nigga, that's a scrimmage
Any beef, I'ma end it
Big FN with extended
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Nigga you don't want no problems
Stay with shooters, yeah I got 'em
I say shoot 'em, then they shot 'em
Knock his top to his bottom
Like, oh dawg, I'm a menace
You need 'em bricks get your K
Industry nigga still in the streets
Ain't shit changed but the chains

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
One god damn minute
Hold up wait a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me count ya minutes
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me count ya minutes

[Verse 2: Phresher]
Big head Jimmy Neutron
Fuck a bitch on a futon
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Nigga this ain't Groupon
Do my dirt all by my lonely
All my bitches know we homies
If I pull up wit my bitch hoes better act like they don't know me
All my side bitches in check, diamonds clear like windex
One point got an index
Smash your ass like an insect
So you better be goo
Shawty better be new
When I walk in the room
She know she fuckin' with a goon
Did (?) at the same time
My third leg got hang time
Bang, bang, bang time
Game face when it's game time
(?) Dora
Got her screamin' like a whore-a
She keep beggin' me to stop
But she really want more-a
Dirty soap (?) dick (?)
But the dick's so addictive
Homie how could you blame her?
Her hand dealt like Kramer

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
One god damn minute
Hold up wait a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me count ya minutes
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me count ya minutes

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Boy, now what's the issue?
You gonna make me get with you
You want talk that girlie talk bitch you can talk to my pistol
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I got big paper I'm spendin'
I get to flashin' on 'em, my whip blasted on 'em, I mean any nigga can get it
That's 30 in the extendo
I had your bitch in the end zone
Nigga she sucked me out the friend zone
Nigga she sucked me out the friend zone
I'm so good with the hoes
I pulled up in the Rolls
With my diamonds blinkin' like strobes
In a Kanye shirt with holes
I'm blowin' paper like Dat
My niggas in here strapped
They'll bust, you won't bust back
That's why I act how I act
I see it oh, so, clear
You niggas ain't really-really with this shit
Got me thinkin' I really, really, really run this bitch

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
One god damn minute
Hold up wait a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me count ya minutes
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me count ya minutes
