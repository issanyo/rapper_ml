[Intro: Phresher]
Wait, wait
Wait, wait
Wait, wait
Wait, wait

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
One goddamn minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Start shit then I finish
Hard head, I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga like a future menace
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Start shit then I finish
Hard head, I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga like a future menace

[Verse 1: Phresher]
Big head, Jimmy Neutron
Fuck a bitch on a futon
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
Nigga this ain't groupon
Do my dirty by my lonely
All my bitches know we homies
If I pull up with my bitch
Hoes better act like they don't know me
All my side bitches in check
Diamonds clear like windex
One point' at ur index
Throw your ass like an insect
So you better be cool
Shawty better be new
When I walk in the room
She know she fuckin' with a goon
I get em in at the same time
My third leg got hang time
Bang bang bang bang time
Game face when it's game time
VA be the score-o
Got her screamin' like a whore-o
She keep beggin' me to stop
But she really want more though
Dirty soda got addictive
But the dick so addictive
I mean how could you blame her
Her head dumb like kramer

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
One goddamn minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Start shit then I finish
Hard head, I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga like a future menace
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Start shit then I finish
Hard head, I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga like a future menace

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
All my jewelry expensive
All my windows ain't tinted
You gon' see who up in it
I might candy grey bentley
I might buick my century
I'll erase your whole memory
I might ruin you Wednesday
I'mma erase your identity
Damn, I might just hop in sedan (damn!)
I might pull off in the lamb
I might just go on vacation
All of my syrup ain't maple
I might just syrup my sprite
I might just bobby my night
I might just sip on some purple
I might just sniff on some white
Catchin' plays Jared Rice
All my shooters Mark Price
Shootin', jumpin', Glen Rice
Dan Marino, Miami
Trip to Hawaii to tan me
Can't nobody stand me
Promethazine in my pantry
Nah, bitch I need a grammy
RiFF!

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
One goddamn minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Start shit then I finish
Hard head, I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga like a future menace
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Start shit then I finish
Hard head, I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga like a future menace
