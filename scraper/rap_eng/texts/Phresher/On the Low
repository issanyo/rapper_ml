[Chorus: Desiigner]
I get money
All my niggas trapping
She a freak
I heard she ride it like a
On the low low
On the low
On the low low
On the low

[Verse 1: PHresher]
Nigga like me, always had his Margiela
I ain’t Pillsbury, but I been doughed up
Money on a string, like a yoyo
Beast told me hit him up, he got a [?]
Tell your man I ain’t boxing, I ain’t Carter
His money so so, you need to shut up
All it took was a couple [?] a sawed off
I ain’t sayin’ you a ho though
Birds in the six, you a dodo
Bomb pussy, but you ain’t ‘bout to blow though
I be hittin’ in the case, sipping Jo-Jo
Head banging, got me tellin’ on my woes

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I get money
All my niggas trapping
She a freak
I heard she ride it like a
On the low low
On the low
On the low low
On the low

[Verse 2: PHresher]
Who getting money, nigga throw it up
PHresher with a "PH", bet you know what’s up
Shake your ass if you old enough
I hold you up, coocoo for some cocoa puffs
I’m a serial killer
Hundred thousand dollars on me, take me to the dealer
One fast move, shooting like Reggie Miller
Said I'll get J like thriller
I’m good everywhere, nigga how you sound
Stop nickel and diming and go buy the pound
Niggas talk slick when I’m not around
It ain’t no secret that I run the town

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I get money
All my niggas trapping
She a freak
I heard she ride it like a
On the low low
On the low
On the low low
On the low

[Verse 3: Desiigner]
PHresher and Desiigner
Feet up like the recliner
Slapped on her silk pajamas
Y’all niggas got Alzheimer's
We eating like piranhas
Fucking up some commas
Feeling like Obama
Word to my mama

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I get money
All my niggas trapping
She a freak
I heard she ride it like a
On the low low
On the low
On the low low
On the low
