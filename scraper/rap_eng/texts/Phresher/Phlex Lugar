[Intro]
All I do is flex
All I do is flex
All I know is flex
All I know is flex
All my niggas do it for my niggas
I'm a nerd man
All I know is flex
All I know is flex

[Pre-Chorus]
Cooler than ice in a cooler
Your highness, I am your ruler
Icy exploding my jeweler
What the fuck on your medulla
In love with that ass at the Hooters
I am the shit like manure
Walked down with a couple of shooters
We done bout to blow your medulla

[Chorus]
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)

[Verse 1]
I got 10 bitches over here, another 10 over there
20 bitches all together, all my bitches go together
Hit it down for whatever, I take em down altogether
Pussy popping all together, so I take em all shopping together
Bet you can't do it like me, bet you can't do it like me
You ain't got pull like me, eat the pussy till you full like me
I'm the nastiest nigga on the planet, I know it
That's why I'm fucking your bitch, you ain't even know it
Big game, I got floor seats, right next to Spike Lee
Bitches ride me like a horsey, that's why they don't like me
Fuck whoever don't fuck with me
Mad as hell they can't fuck with me
Lucky I ain't with the fuckery
But I'm here to stay so you stuck with me
Till I'm dead and gone, DJs gon play my shit
When they hear my lyrics, the fans gon say my shit
And say my shit, and say my shit, that's legendary
You should probably go to bed already
Or take a shot to the head already
Cause you dead already, goddamn

[Pre-Chorus]
Cooler than ice in a cooler
Your highness, I am your ruler
Icy exploding my jeweler
What the fuck on your medulla
In love with that ass at the Hooters
I am the shit like manure
Walked down with a couple of shooters
We done bout to blow your medulla

[Chorus]
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)

[Verse 2]
I like to flex, my niggas they love to flex
Diamonds on neck, baby VS, watch what you text
Niggas die over text, better come at me correct
I got that fuck who got next, word to my set
Did you eye just to see the gang
We don't let the bitties hang
Only Chiddy Chiddy Bang
Walk me down with a bitch
Beat the pussy up jabbing this bitch
Left hook like I'm stabbing this bitch
Pussy good call the cat for a fish
Never ever give my math to a bitch
Word to Yo Gotti, it goes down in the DMs
Hundred man from the AM to the PM
Bitches drop down to the ground when they see him
That nigga gorgeous and his shining so flawless
PH be higher than August
Just with the cup and the coffee
Don't talk about my ratchet saw thing
38 nose smell like a dolphin, back the fuck off me
Cause you killing me softly
Got a bitch badder than boujee
Don't know how she single like a loosie
She be wanna kick it, I ain't Burce Lee
If she ask for paper give her a loose leaf
Goddamn

[Pre-Chorus]
Cooler than ice in a cooler
Your highness, I am your ruler
Icy exploding my jeweler
What the fuck on your medulla
In love with that ass at the Hooters
I am the shit like manure
Walked down with a couple of shooters
We done bout to blow your medulla

[Chorus]
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
All I do is flex like Lex Luthor (we flex)
