[Chorus]
Only want to fuck me 'cause I'm on the radio
Only love me 'cause I'm on the radio
Y'all be hating 'cause I'm on the radio
Volume up please when I'm on the radio
Only want to fuck me 'cause I'm on the radio
Only love me 'cause I'm on the radio
Y'all be hating 'cause I'm on the radio
Volume up please when I'm on the radio, yeah

[Verse 1]
Heard my song on the radio, now things changed
All these women want to drain a main vein
I can't trust these hoes, just my main thing
All this cash money, rockin' bling bling
I'm just livin' life and tryna maintain
You know that I ride with the same gang
You can't sit with us 'cause it's a gang thing
Call my shotty pops 'cause it go bang bang
Don't get your head knocked off, head knocked off
I'm what you call a top dog, a top dog
I go all in for my squad, that's my squad
No sucker shit on my watch, while I watch

[Chorus]
Only want to fuck me 'cause I'm on the radio
Only love me 'cause I'm on the radio
Y'all be hating 'cause I'm on the radio
Volume up please when I'm on the radio
Only want to fuck me 'cause I'm on the radio
Only love me 'cause I'm on the radio
Y'all be hating 'cause I'm on the radio
Volume up please when I'm on the radio, yeah

[Verse 2]
They used to act like they ain't know me (they ain't know me)
Now all these niggas tryna bro me (don't bro me)
You ain't no kin, you ain't my homie (we ain't homies)
No I can't go back to the old me (fuck the old me)
Black mamba, I ain't Kobe (I ain't Kobe)
Mama said boy you a star, that's what she told me (that's what she told me)
Never let 'em get too comfortable (can't get too cozy)
Gotta make sure that my bros eat (all my bros eat)
I can't trust a ho nigga or thotty (no thotty)
Only shiesty niggas movin' walky (so walky)
Gotta get the shmoney, word to Bobby (free Rowdy)
All this ice on me, come play hockey (come play hockey)

[Chorus]
Only want to fuck me 'cause I'm on the radio
Only love me 'cause I'm on the radio
Y'all be hating 'cause I'm on the radio
Volume up please when I'm on the radio
Only want to fuck me 'cause I'm on the radio
Only love me 'cause I'm on the radio
Y'all be hating 'cause I'm on the radio
Volume up please when I'm on the radio, yeah

[Outro]
'Cause I'm on the radio
'Cause I'm on the radio
'Cause I'm on the radio
When I'm on the radio
