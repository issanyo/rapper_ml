[Intro]
Go Grizz!

[Chorus]
Them girls ain't rocking them shoes (Like you do)
They don't squeeze into them jeans (Like you do)
Them girls don't have me daydreaming (You do)
I hope and pray that you see
That you do
Them girls ain't rocking them shoes (Rocking them shoes)
They don't squeeze into them jeans (Into them jeans)
Them girls don't have me daydreaming (Have me daydreaming)
I hope and pray that you see
That you do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do

[Verse 1]
I just wanna wake up to you
Never ever break up with you
Crushing on you since high school
I can see you weren't comfortable
The nigga you with treating you just like a thing on the side
I can see right through them beautiful eyes
I know the truth, that you ain't gotta lie
Hop in my ride
Know you dealing with a of games
Ex's played a lot of games
Let me show you all the finer things
Upgrade you, designer things
Drape you down in all kind of bling
Drive me crazy, in and out of lanes
I just wanna do all I can
All men are not the same

[Chorus]
Them girls ain't rocking them shoes (Like you do)
They don't squeeze into them jeans (Like you do)
Them girls don't have me daydreaming (You do)
I hope and pray that you see
That you do
Them girls ain't rocking them shoes (Rocking them shoes)
They don't squeeze into them jeans (Into them jeans)
Them girls don't have me daydreaming (Have me daydreaming)
I hope and pray that you see
That you do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm obsessed with your overbite
Sexing, talking over night
Drunk in love, no sober life
Girl, you louder than a motorbike
I bet the neighbours know my name
How your [?] sounds, simply over sex
But neither one of us got capes on
I just wanna love you night and day
You call, I'm coming right away
Them girls don't get no light of day
You make me feel some type of way
Never propose, I might today
Never propose, I might today
Never propose, I might today
I'm just hoping that you say (Woo)

[Chorus]
You do
Them girls ain't rocking them shoes (Like you do)
They don't squeeze into them jeans (Like you do)
Them girls don't have me daydreaming (You do)
I hope and pray that you see
That you do
Them girls ain't rocking them shoes (Rocking them shoes)
They don't squeeze into them jeans (Into them jeans)
Them girls don't have me daydreaming (Have me daydreaming)
I hope and pray that you see
That you do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
