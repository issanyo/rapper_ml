Getting to the bag, it ain't no stress
Yeah I'm cashin' out, I think they upset
Oooh, that bitch blow me up like a trumpet
Ballin, Yeah I'm ballin just like the Celtics
Miss me with that fuck shit

You still rockin' that Truck Fit
Flexing on the gram'
I see you drinking Robitussin
Yeah I came from nothing

Bite my swag

[Verse 2: Phresher]
I was doing back to life
Picked up the microphone
I was in the streets
I had to leave that life alone
We can get it in but
You know that I got wife at home
Don't get uptight, mobster like I'm Al Capone
They ain't fuck with me
No they ain't fuck with me
Acting up, don't say what's up to me
No monogamy, ain't got no time for fuckery
Stay and suck for free but all my bitches suck for free
No time for freakin, only on the weekend
Don't be creeping, throw out the deep end
They want the D and I ain't talk defense
The economy, got a lock like a prison

[Hook: FatboySSE]

It ain't no stress
