Grrrrrrrrah
Biatch

[Hook: Desiigner + PHresher]
Walk in the spot give me 10 'em (10 of 'em)
Pussy ass nigga know he been in her (been in her)
Know he mad cause I get bread like a dinner roll (dinner roll)
When you grind everything will go (bing ah-ah-ah)
When you grindin' everything will go (ah-ah-ah)
When you grind everything will go (woah ah-ah-ah)
When you grindin' everything will go (ah-ah-ah)

Walk up in the spot, give me 10 of those (10 of those)
Pussy ass niggas know you been in her (been in her)
Mad I get bread like a dinner roll (dinner roll)

[Verse 1: PHresher]
Gettin' money like a finger roll (finger roll)
Hot cold and it 10 below (10 below)
He and Charlie fuck with centerfolds
What you know about the crime?
What you know about the shows?
Sittin' on the Bentley waitin' for the (?) to fuck yourself
You in the gang
Niggas actin' like they love you, they don't really love you
Every time I make a dollar, try to see it double
Triple that
Put somethin' where your temple at
Where your left nipple at?
King I resemble that, remember that
Niggas fuck with you when you're up, never down
You ain't fuckin' up a check then them niggas ain't around
By yourself

[Verse 2: Phresher]
Even when I got it I ain't got it
My money be a Aladdin
Investin' in narcotics
My flow cut, no narcotics
My niggas know they can get a safe cause I got a loaf
Ain't got a boss, it ain't hard to see I get it by the boat load
I be on a roll
With my fuckin' whoa's
Might go check my soul
In Atlanta woah
Stickin' to the code
Money over hoes
Rip a couple shows
Then some Fanta
You watch your rabbit ass mind if you ain't on the grind
Get another cup and drink the Yak and these dollar signs
Stay in these streets as they say out of sight, out of mind
I might go Columbine if your ass get out of line
