[Intro]
PH

[Chorus]
Mama used to ask when will I learn
Now I count money 'til my eyes burn
All the respect, nigga I earn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Mama used to ask when will I learn
Now I count money 'til my eyes burn
All the respect, nigga I earn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn

[Verse 1]
Don't be mad at me 'cause you procrastinated
Shit I had to make it, even Magic made it
Made the wrong move and get assassinated
Get decapitated, no exageration
Rolls Royce, back to back to back to basics
Done with all the shit in your imaginaton
Had to come hard, no ejaculation
They congratulate me like I graduated
I don't mean no disrespect homie
Don't check unless you got a check for me
Something glittery around the neck for me
Lawyer got the shooters on deck for me lil nigga
Bitch I'm a don like Cheadle
Arrogance out like a beetle
PH too goddamn cerebral
Always on point like a needle
I ain't got time for emotions
Tell that bitch keep it in motion
Wrist naked, fingers, I'm frozen
Want to ride the wave, this ain't an ocean
Look at how far I came in a year
Try but you gotta [?] in here
Pop the hood, it ain't no engine here
Somebody killin' niggas' engineers

[Chorus]
Mama used to ask when will I learn
Now I count money 'til my eyes burn
All the respect, nigga I earn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Mama used to ask when will I learn
Now I count money 'til my eyes burn
All the respect, nigga I earn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn

[Verse 2]
As far as licks, still hittin' it
Still takin' trips but I ain't trip a bitch
Nigga you just really started gettin' it
Zip your lip, you switch just like a little bitch
I got heat for each and every one of you niggas
Kickin' this shit like a punt to you niggas
I'ma keep, I'ma keep sonnin' you niggas
My name hold weight like a ton of you niggas
I hop on a track, go beastmode, yeah
718 be the three code, yeah
Nigga beat the odds, no cheat code, yeah
Paid in full, gotta watch the RICO, yeah
I'm the nigga that you talk to
Forty bands on a walk through
Posted up just like a boss do
I ain't lucky, fuck a horseshoe
Got a house in the hills playboy
Float crack like krill playboy
You sick, I'm ill playboy
Shit real in the field playboy
How you feel, how you feel playboy
Better chill, better chill playboy
Goons starvin', need a meal playboy
So you know they all down to do a drill playboy

[Chorus]
Mama used to ask when will I learn
Now I count money 'til my eyes burn
All the respect, nigga I earn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Mama used to ask when will I learn
Now I count money 'til my eyes burn
All the respect, nigga I earn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
Waited on the bench, now it's my turn
My turn, my turn
