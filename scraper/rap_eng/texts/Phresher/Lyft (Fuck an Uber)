Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Stone cold, you see this brick on my wrist
I tell my shooters shoot, they shoot they don't miss
Flying coast to coast, don’t need no assist
Diamonds on my neck the color of piss
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Stone cold, you see this brick on my wrist
I tell my shooters shoot, they shoot they don't miss
Flying coast to coast, don’t need no assist
Diamonds on my neck the color of piss

[Verse 1]
Richer than a bitch my lifestyle
Every nigga with me iced out
You might wanna calm your wife down
She know I’m the nigga right now
Put the motherfuckin’ mic down
Tell your hype man to pipe down
Yeah they left me in the dark
I’m the nigga with the light now
Told [?] it’s some lights out
Don’t do circuses, I don’t like clowns
All my niggas stone cold
I colored in weather in Chi-Town
Pillsbury, got a lot of dough
Bank account reflect a lot of O’s
She wanna kick it like karate though
Suck and fuck me, then it’s time to go

[Pre-Hook]
I’m nigga that they go to
Wild hair like Goku
[?] open off the protools
Then I proceed to lay the vocals
You little rat niggas local
Fake beef, niggas tofu
PH don’t follow no rules
My chopper whippin’ like an old school

Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft

Flying coast to coast, don’t need no assist
Diamonds on my neck the color of piss
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Fuck an Uber, I pull up in a Lyft
Stone cold, you see this brick on my wrist
I tell my shooters shoot, they shoot they don't miss
Flying coast to coast, don’t need no assist
Diamonds on my neck the color of piss

[Verse 2]
I keep it real, no restate
I’m the trillest, no debate
I get it early, fuck release dates
PH far from a cheapskate
I got broads in the P state
MIA like where the Heat stay
Got a white chick and a rainbow
Eat ‘em both together like cheesecake
Then I league play, for pete’s sakes
Stop drop and roll, I’m on fire
I go in head first like a diver
Kill ‘em, I leave no survivors
I might be young but I’m wiser
My role model a MacGyver
I’m the young cracker supplier
Keep my foot on the gas ‘til I retire

[Pre-Hook]
I’m nigga that they go to
Wild hair like Goku
[?] open off the protools
Then I proceed to lay the vocals
You little rat niggas local
Fake beef, niggas tofu
PH don’t follow no rules
My chopper whippin’ like an old school
