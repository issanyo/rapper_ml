[Intro: PHresher]
Yeah, get my levels
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Big lawn, right, right, right, yeah

[Chorus: PHresher]
Me and my niggas should've been on
Crew thick, only 'bout ten strong
Chill mode, look at my wrist on
Made the bed rock, Fred Flintstone
Nigga I ain't never in the friendzone
Nigga so good, put her friends on
Nigga couldn't see me with lens on
House on the hill got a big lawn
Me and my niggas should've been on
Crew thick, only 'bout ten strong
Chill mode, look at my wrist on
Made the bed rock, Fred Flintstone
Nigga I ain't never in the friendzone
Nigga so good, put her friends on
Nigga couldn't see me with lens on
House on the hill got a big lawn
House on the hill got a big lawn, house on the hill got a big lawn
House on the hill got a big lawn, house on the hill got a big lawn
House on the hill got a big lawn, house on the hill got a big lawn
House on the hill got a big lawn, house on the hill got a big lawn
