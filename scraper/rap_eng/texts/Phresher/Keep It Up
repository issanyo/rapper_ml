[Chorus]
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up
All of my niggas, they freeze it up (yeah)
She came with you, I'ma leave with her (yeah)
Bad as hell so I beat it up (yeah)
Tables turned, now they be needin' us (yeah)
Name always in the media (yeah)
Life was so hard, now it's easier
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up
All of my niggas, they freeze it up (yeah)
She came with you, I'ma leave with her (yeah)
Bad as hell so I beat it up (yeah)
Tables turned, now they be needin' us (yeah)
Name always in the media (yeah)
Life was so hard, now it's easier

[Verse]
Shit I got on outta Hammer's closet, commas on commas, these damn deposits (yeah)
I'm countin', don't tell Uncle Sam about it, rappin', them servers be analyzin' (yeah)
'Member they ain't give a damn about us, we livin' life, you just fantasizin' (yeah)
Dab in that bitch, I go Cam about it, ruby car coupe with the camo body
None of my niggas wear Dockers, all of my bitches got knockers
Walk in that bitch with the chopper, handlin' beef like a Whopper, yeah
I do not fuck with imposters, none on my roster, life of a mobster, yeah
Rigatoni be my pasta, they holler Barbara, skeleton lobster, yeah
Don't get too close to me, only bad bitches can roll with me
Sing to that pussy like Jodeci, get on your knees where you 'posed to be
I got all of my woes with me, none of you niggas is cold as me
Skippy that look like Ginobili, haters still can't get a hold of me

[Chorus]
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up
All of my niggas, they freeze it up (yeah)
She came with you, I'ma leave with her (yeah)
Bad as hell so I beat it up (yeah)
Tables turned, now they be needin' us (yeah)
Name always in the media (yeah)
Life was so hard, now it's easier
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up
All of my niggas, they freeze it up (yeah)
She came with you, I'ma leave with her (yeah)
Bad as hell so I beat it up (yeah)
Tables turned, now they be needin' us (yeah)
Name always in the media (yeah)
Life was so hard, now it's easier
