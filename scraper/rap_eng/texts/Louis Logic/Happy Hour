[Verse One: Louis Logic]
Open the flood gates to where the drunk stays
My crib is more like a liquor store that's open on Sundays

[Charlie Bawles aka Checkmark]
And I got one way to look at life, through empty green bottles
Seems all I wanna do is bang brews and teen models
Team motto? Rep Red Star and stay true
Furthering the gap between us drunks and J. Crews
I drink booze in school, had a flask in class
Tapped kegs, broads and backboards and mastered math

[Louis Logic]
I'm like a nasty brat when I don't get my way
Open the gates so somebody's getting broken today
They on the nuts so much it's like they hoping I'm gay
These poor punks will get their store front closed for the day

[Checkmark]
Me being sober Fridays?
That's like Da Brat liking dudes
Type to strike a move
All about cash, mics and brews
That's right ya lose
Cause your flow couldn't stop the man
That'll clap you with a bottle till your dome look like Rocky Dennis

[Scratch Hook] {x2}
"Budweiser in the daytime, Heineken after nine
And hit your record after record and rhyme after rhyme" - Sadat X 'Rockin It'
"Featherweight contenders surrender" - Inspectah Deck 'R.E.C. Room'
"No question"
"Chill count to ten, and bring me back a Heineken" - Black Sheep

[Verse Two: Checkmark]
I get a 12 pack of Heiney's and a couple of stouts
Enough to get your girl drunk when I bust in her mouth
The type to
Smuggle about 20 beers to a movie
Brews Brother number one
AKA Palmer Brewsky

[Louis Logic]
And slam backboards, stand back boy
I'm coming through, Brews Brother number two
Running down the street drunk, in Spider Man underoos
On the news wilding
Kicked out of a dive for becoming too violent

[Checkmark]
I strum a dudes violin with a bottle cap
Swallow tabs in front of broads and XO my cognac
In a Pontiac with an open container
Cause I don't care y'all
My real name is Charlie Bear Bawles

[Louis Logic]
We'll prolly tear y'all a new butt hole with this one flow
Then hop the chain and bounce on the run from Columbo
Now the pigs in the station house wishing they knocked me
Cause I came to town chasing down chicken like Rocky

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Louis Logic]
When Louis Logic and Sir Charlie are served barley and malt
Run up the tab on the bar keep, it's hardly our fault
Cause I drink so fast I always spill some on my lap
That's why it's so hard to perform cause I'm drunk when I rap
Or something like that

[Checkmark]
I muffle your DAT, sabotage your whole show
Sad ya got a catalog of old flows
Mr. Cattle Prod Hoes, stab a broad slow
Charlie Bawles, God's flow, in Babylon with bomb 'dro

[Louis Logic]
And the jabber jaw pro
Y'all can call me Dr. [?]
Cause I always ask the class if they brought so vodka for me
Today's lesson is how to tell obnoxious stories
But if I don't get a sip of some liq's, I'm not performing

[Checkmark]
Toss the door man a $20 and I sneak in a case
And pour some brew on the coochie just to sweeten the taste
Give me a beat with some bass, I have the place rocking
Battle crews for brews and win more cases than Cochran
