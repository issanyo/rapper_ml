[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
Stop the beat
You're under arrest
How could someone forget who's the best
When Celph's got both of his guns to your head
And El-Fudge propels slugs to dispel thugs
Who come with they best
So Demigodz ain't even somewhat impressed
And don't forget the punk with Tourettes
That's me
I curse worse than Taxi drivers and sailors who's stranded at sea
Listen to me, dumb nigga
Pussy, cunt licker
Fuckin' cock sucker, motherfucker, give me the keys
What the fuck?
It's the misfit retard
Who's green card give the kid permission to leave Mars
Whippin' a lifted police car, driftin' between stars
And kissin' your sweet heart while I listen to Street Smarts
The Demigodz CD charts in Hell's dungeon
Burnin' up Satan's 1200's, the smell's pungent
To sell something close to us
You should have to be hot enough when it comes out to roast ya nuts

[Hook]
Suffer and torture is all you see
Stay off the streets, try to hide your beliefs from the thought police
Nothin' can warn ya, once an informer reports ya
We're comin' for ya, duck in the corner
You made an album? You dumb fuck, that was a waste
You run your mouth and you'll get smacked in the face
You can leave your house with a mask and a cape
To disguise you, we'll find you, that isn't safe
