[Louis Logic]
Perfectionist rhymer
It's only cause I'm such a dick you always find me next to vagina
And people like, "This fuckin' kid's just as sick as sex with a minor!"
Sensitive whiners, just tryna censor my line up
My CD is diseased, please be cautious
Cause each queasy chorus will leave ya nauseous
Each verse is equipped with evil forces
For teachin' your kids how to be remorseless
All of ya high horses, please get off it
If you don't like my songs you can eat my sausage
And I got a set of meatballs you'd need a forklift...
To reach to your lips just to feed your orifice
Indecent authors of the world unite
Run to the video store and rent "Kiss the Girls" tonight
Read "American Psycho"
And Mein Kampf, learn how to build a time bomb
It's easy gettin' a rifle
Start up a revolution or practice an execution
Whatever you're doin', don't be another contented human
Who wakes up in the mornin' yawnin'
Pourin' another coffee when you should be out puttin' your boss in a coffin
Cause no matter how often you break the law
Take the Lord's name in vain, or rape some whore
Say no more, cause you haven't had a loose screw yet
Lou's cassette will send you right over the cuckoo's nest
Motherfucker!
