Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know what I'm sayin, yo, yo, OK
So this is it kids, your whole fifteen bucks worth
It's been a long wild ride getting here
Lost a lot of friends, made a few lifelong bonds
Mostly enemies though, so, uh, you know
I guess at this critical juncture, y'all expecting some answers
To a few pertinent, burning questions
You know, "What's gettin' ready to happen with hip hop, Lou?"
"Yo Lou, what's gettin' ready to happen with hip hop man, what's getting ready?"
So I tell 'em, "You know what's gonna happen with hip hop?"
"You know what's gonna happen with hip hop, man?"
I'll tell you what's gonna happen with hip hop, money:
Whatever the fuck I say!

If it isn't broke don't fix it
That's why I call bitches hoes and hoes bitches
A lot of politicians would probably wash my mouth with soap
That's how it goes? What, I'm not allowed to joke?
I never fix it if it ain't broke
That's probably why I drink beer and chain smoke
Think weird and now these emmer-effers wanna wash my mouth for me?
As if I don't have my own eyes, how corny
Cry babies, you think you're looking down on me
Cause I pound forty beers a night and walk around horny
Mother always said I had a mouth on me
Shit, I'm makin' records now, it worked out for me
So if it isn't broke don't fix it
That's why I call niggas hoes and hoes bitches
You shitheads don't get it, I'll rephrase it then
I always play to win, so when the games begin you ain't my friend
And so, in summation, for those delusional grandiose shits
Who feel their slimy characters are personified
In this polyrhythmic potshot of a record
I offer you this: I'm not not shittin' on you filthy motherscratchers
