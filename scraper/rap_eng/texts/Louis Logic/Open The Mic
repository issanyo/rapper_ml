[Verse One] [J-Love]:
Yeah, uh, yo
Let me spark this
I'm already wound up
Lets burn it from the ground up
Turn the fuckin' sound up
Allow drunks spittin' on this underground cut
Come around
It's goin' down like the town slut
Keep your mouth shut
I'm quick to set it
Kid forgot it
I get gas then piss unleaded
Your shits pathetic
Slip before your wigs beheaded
Disconnected and ripped apart like a Christmas present
Flip this record
We can battle on the instrumental
Battle to a quicker tempo
Battle with a pen and pencil
Your girls digits in my pocket
That's coincidental
But if they had a pimp Olympics I would win a medal
I've been a rebel for the most of my life
I go to your show with a knife, start provoking a fight
Jump on stage just when the moment is right
And scream "open the mic"
Your opponent gets sliced

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]:
Out the mouth comes fire
Who ignite the fullest?
Celph Titled feed you lead, make you bite the bullet
Talk imaginary crime stories and get dealt shots
Surprise you with the Kalico and get shell shocked
And Hells hot
You don't wanna get caught there
When it's warfare we suit up and carry fours in pairs
I'll rob a bitch a too
Snatch her purse with the quickness
Not Jamaican but I love to jerk chickens
Niggas disrespect I never keep it on wax
We load up the vans
With soldiers and fully loaded macs
Crashing threw the windows of your crib
Blastin' shots
Wearing Navy Seal suits to look like astronauts
Don't give a fuck about rap
You talking thug shit
Drain your bodily fluids
Now you lack substance
Whether east or west
You bring beef round here
I'll launch a missile to your city till the coast is clear

[Verse Three] [Louis Logic]:
Ayo you feeling me?
Well get your mittens out my trousers
Or we'll deal a beating out like a clique of rowdy bouncers
You sit around announcers, got nothing to say
Like your girl when I'm standing up and fucking her face
Shit
We take shots like they don't effect us
With more rounds of quarters than bankers and pay phone collectors
I slip licks with thick chicks and stay so erected
As if my dick fits in a slick slip like Lego connectors
Hey don't forgot this
Jay Love & Celph
And J-Zone spit heat like they come from Hell
When I'm pissy I can dump as well
When I'm not, I'm just pissed off
So your two choices are lump or swell
Chicks tell me I'm something else, the way I eat snatch
In a pair of cushion knee pads and safety mats
And lately that's been the reasons they hate me rappin'
Cause my dick disappears in your chicks mouth like baby aspirin

[Verse Four] [J-Zone]:
Y'all say Zone is a one trick pony (and he talks about is hoes)
I say Zone got a long dick, blow me (mothafucka)
The more y'all hate, the more the money come
I ain't been unanimous loved since I was 21 with Music For Tu Madre
My first LP?
All that critical acclaim?
Shit, I was up in Starbucks and couldn't afford a latte
But now I talk trash and bring Hell to the people
You're not a broad or a bank teller...I don't want to see you
Too cheap to go clubbin' (yep)
Too ugly to model (uh huh)
Too broke to drink Cris, but I'll front with the bottle
J-Zone give a dime to record (what?!)
Bitch please, rich or poor, y'all ain't worthy to wash my drawers
ARC on the beat (Record Collector)
I, Couple and Celph use your bathroom and pee on the seat
And fuck a holistic hoe
I'd rather have a hoe with lipstick blow on my balls like a piccolo

[Verse Five] [J.J. Brown]:
Now hold up
You can't have a jam without the engineer man
It's double J. Brown in this bitch, jeah!
I, get into your psyche, don't care if you like me
You pussy, even your lesbo flow is so dykey
Check the level, dump the treble that's the phat G sound
The devil's on a whole new level when we roll through your town
Cause it's the O double D, C-O-U-P-L-E
With J.B. on this banger, courtesy of A.V
It's hot shit
Ooooh, don't say you is when it isn't
Like jerkin' off with your left hand, our shit just feels different
And +Por Que+ you wanna act like you got that pimp shit
Sin-A-Matic heads know that my posse makes hits
I heard you thinkin' drinkin' is some shit that we say
But best believe I leave ? drippin' with Grand monyay
Hip hop horray
It's the end for you clowns
And leave your hoe to standing up
You sit the fuck back down
