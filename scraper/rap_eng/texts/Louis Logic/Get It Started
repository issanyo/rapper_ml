[Verse One: Louis Logic]
Follow the sounds of the drunken dragon
And just imagine recovering alchies, jumping from the wagon
(Look out!)
Someone's staring in that your mom knows
As "The King Of Put Downs" and "Most Ignorant Snot Nose"
Who got flows, much liver
Than a 2Pac show
A drug wired truck driver's
On caffeine pills
My nasty spills surpass the thrill
Of the change to chill in bed with two muff divers
Fuck a Budweiser
I'd rather taste the geyser
Of Jaegermeister squirting out a stripper's shaved vagina
What a way to find an artist, waiting for the show to start
Don't snooze punk, there were two drunks on Noah's Ark
Throwing darts in Jehovah's bar, sipping smooth rum
Scheming on how to stick the only chickens who would come
You bet your ass if Lou was born I would've had 'em both
Super drunk on Jack and Cokes and crash the boat

[Hook: Louis Logic (J-Love)]
Ayo J
(What's going on Lou?)
Let's get it started
Respect to artists at the bar so much, he's never carded
It's
(Two for us) and none for you
So who can fuck with J on the beats?
(Or get as drunk as Lou?)

"We keep it tight and that's the way it's supposed to be" - Grand Puba 'A Little Of This'
"Ya frontin' boy, come against me" - Gang Starr 'Full Clip'
"Louis Logic"
"J.J. Brown"
"Y'all ready?"
"No!"

[Verse Two: Louis Logic]
Let's get it started
Catch a harlot
In stretched leather garments and wet her carpet
I'm in the sex department at your local video shop
Trying to ingest Bacardi mixed with some pop
With a grip on my crotch
Looking for lust in all ya slut's blue jeans
It's nothing personal, I'm just too mean
So what new scheme, will I invent next
To blend sex, music and beer?
Into a world of art that you shouldn't hear
I make a profit when I take a topless chick's picture
And disfigure the size of the tits bigger
Cut and paste a couple of sick niggas like me and J-Love on the nipples
Spazzing out like a couple of cripples
Who sip liquor till they chuckle a little
Now isn't that cute?
With all this talk about booze and puke
It's no wonder you sick of that dude
They call The Dragon
When they looking for some action
Drunks ain't falling off anymore
I push 'em off the wagon

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Louis Logic]
I'm the evil voice that's in your head
When you're drunk as a skunk
That always has you heading back to the keg
Then you end up splashing your leg with a river of puke
That gets in your boot
And no one at the place will sit next to you
I'm the barer of bad news
A terrible brat who
Sneaks out your mom's window in a pair of your dad's shoes
I'll dare her to tattoo
My rap name, square on her ass dude
And deny it like, "I swear I'm not that Lou"
I'm the reason they invented gauze
Cause I'll clench my jaws around your bitches neck, see all men are dogs
But none of 'em like Lou, will run up and bite you
And just to be spiteful, start humping your wife too
I'm the rightful ruler and king of the castle
Doing his thing with Long Island Ice Tea, so fuck a Snapple
I'll chug a flask full of whisky and ask you to diss me
After I'm pissy, just to prove how much I love to battle

[Hook]
