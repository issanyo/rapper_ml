Hands across the water

Has it really been 6 years
Standing on the edge of this pier?
With my face gone shiny and wet with slick tears
Wishing I could tell you, you've been missed here
I let my ship steer into dark waters
And had to say a few "Our Father"s
In hopes that he exists and it fits into the script that god authors

You were my best friend and my biggest fan
My sweet guide waiting in the sand at the seaside
I know we'll meet again when I'm crossing over these tides
But in the meantime, I just reach my…
