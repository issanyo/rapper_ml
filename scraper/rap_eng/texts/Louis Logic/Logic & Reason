(uh, ah)
Together again for the first time (yeah)
R-Son, the voice of reason (check it out)
Louis Logic, J.J. Brown
Back up in this motherfucker (yo, yo)
Before you even knew

[R-Son]
Be prepared when the clock strikes, we ignite these hot mics
To heat up the spot like bauxite
Snatchin' the spotlight from those who don't deserve it
When you want the set wrecked, my bros is at your service
Be careful what you ask for, the chaos'll be extreme enough
To warrant a FEMA task force
For a damage assessment, batten down the blast doors
You had your chance to study up, these here is the crash course
Down to the last straw, we take cats that were passed off as emcees
And strip their masks off, the black Isaac Asimov
My sci-fi imagination is so sick you'll need vaccination
Causin' exasperation (Damn!) and scientists tryin' to find a cure
Failin', cause the toxin's so pure and I'm so sure
Of the venom Randy's droppin'
That each record comes with a vial of anti-toxin

[Hook]
R-Son...in your sector...Louis Logic...cocaine with words
Verified...the question is this...you wanna battle?
Jay scratch the wax...R-Son, in your sector
Louis Logic, cocaine with words...verified
Yeah, real logic and reason...like this, yo, yo

[Louis Logic]
Back in part one, R-Son left you far from stardom
Now it's bar-none, I'm tryna leave you locked up in a car trunk
With large lumps on your dome like the Epcot Center
Many a venomous snake skates once the despot enters (Here ye, here ye)
The ruler in charge, cooler than Arctic snowstorms
Louis is artistic, this is bully your squad with no horns
Clothes torn like you're in a schoolyard grudge match
With two hard thug brats who aim to take your lunch bag
And once back on Memory Lane, you'll get chased
By the dude in the dunce cap who never gets blamed
So save the judge act for Mills Lane, I never arraign
Though I'm more able than the man who killed Cain to spill shame
I will maim your respect, will place you in check
I will strangle your neck, and you'll still bang my cassette
And I ain't threatenin', that's just how it is
You need to be more like Mrs. Markie and get the fuck out the Biz

[Hook]

Uh, yo yo check it out, yo
[Louis Logic]
When I'm comin' down the home stretch, sudden death rules in effect
With no rep', that's the type of fight that you can expect
Cause I'm flier than stupid insects, ya'll bang on the ground
So if you're still hangin' around it's with a noose on your neck
[R-Son]
If the prospect of lynchin' causes tension on the surface
The purpose of this word is to make you nervous
And when the paranoia sets in, it'll make your head spin
Clairvoyantly reading your thoughts like Kreskin
[Louis Logic]
And I got a plan for your dissection and a fresh blade scissor
To remove your breastplate quicker
Understand I could kill y'all with a rhyme
So you best wait, mister
I'm still strong in the mind like an ex-weight lifter
[R-Son]
The best shape shifter can't mimic this
The power of logic and reason combined is limitless
That's why we left behind witnesses, to remind innocents
In our presence, the ones who survived are the penitent

[Hook]

Yeah, yeah yeah, so if you didn't know, now you know
(Now y'all motherfuckers know)
Motherfuckin' Louis Logic up in this bitch
(The original Shadow Cabinet)
You're man R-Son, aight, takin' this motherfucker over
I been tellin' y'all niggas, it's time to take this game a little more serious
Yo, J.J. Brown on the motherfuckin' boards
(Comin' through in your sleep, comin' through in your memory, it's like that, what?)
