Flood in the basement don't care
Cracks in the sidewalk pavement don't care
My career is going nowhere
I'm okay with it cause I don't care
Moth holes in my favorite cardigan
Parking ticket on my car again
On top of it, Rolling Stone says I'm a charlatan
But I'm not arguing I don't care

Don't Care
Don't Care
Don't Care
Don't Care

Oh, what a shame
To no avail
They should throw me in jail
But they won't
Please say no
