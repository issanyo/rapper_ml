[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
I slip liquor, 'til I'm one lit nigga
Who likes to grip sisters up and give 'em tit twisters
A bit sicker than chicks pissin' standin' up
So the press better jet if they don't want their camera's crushed
Into sand and dust, scammin' us? You're a lunatic
Passin' up caviar pussy for the tuna fish
Punitive steps fall on ludicrous heads
Along with numerous threats that Louis expects
To wet the palate, heads will catch a mallet
My special talent is drinkin' til I forget my balance
Never challenge a cat with nothin' to lose
Let alone never think of touchin' his booze
I'm just in a mood, the premise of which
Is touchin' some boobs and wettin' my dick
So when this nigga here gets ya, with some beer nourishment
It isn't peer pressure, it's just some beer encouragement

[Eddie Bones]
When it comes to drinkin' I make moves without thinkin'
Word mumblin', stumblin', the breath stinkin'
Quick to put my dick in ya girl and a friend
Yo this rounds on me, but I'ma hurl at the end
Yo, cause I'm the type of guy that likes to drink
I might act real wild and spend a night in the clink
Wake up the next mornin', drink a 40 at church
Find a shorty to flirt, put the bone in a skirt
Me and my man XL turnin' foreign lands
Always reppin' at a party never pourin' cans
And if you snorin' man, you better watch out
Cause when I'm finished, this bottle gonna break in ya mouth
When we break in ya house, we goin' straight for the freezer
Whether it's beer, champagne, even Tequiza
I don't care
They call me "Ebeneezer" cause I don't share
I'm puttin' kegs on my Visa

[Checkmark]
Ayo Charlie Bawls always pounds beers
To drink you under the table so you can suck my dick while you down there
'Round here we stock bars, party like rock stars
Double fisted, doin' donuts in parked cars
Head spinnin', sittin' on a keg grinnin'
X, E, me and Louis rep engines
Send ya herbs with flames spittin' words at dames
We bang Bartles & Jaymes 'til it slurs the slang
Ya heard the name
This here's that drunken flunky shit
Wake up and drink a beer when you're really hungry shit
Run ya money bitch we got a fully stocked bar
Bruh, praise Red Star, Brew Akbar
Fuck a cop's car, got a box ridin' shotty
Find a fox tryin' to party, this cock, shinin' for me
Grind ya body for the greatest drunks of all time
Rockin' beer goggles until the hogs are all dimes

[XL]
XL and Checkmark, back in the lab
Half in the bag, shit face fallin' outta cabs
We been laughin' at you kids for years
Enemies, shit talkers, friends drinkin' these beers
From grain alcohol to Vics 44D
Vanilla extract to shots of Listerine
I drank the malt liquor and everything in-between
And got ways of gettin' intoxicated never seen
Violence, alcohol, drugs and rap
Go together like Jaysaun bongs and 20 sacks
You cats are lightweights, we play for high stakes
Alcoholic when I don't drink my hand shakes
Told y'all on Chemical how the X get down
With Wild Bill punchin' kids in they face so lay us down
Throw the empty cans down and order another round
XL, drunken flunkies, representin' Boss Town
