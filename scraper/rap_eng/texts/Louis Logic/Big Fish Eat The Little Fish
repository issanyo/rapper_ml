You're not from around here are you? Those are funky clothes
I've watched you for the last week eating lunch alone
This town's weird it kinda sucks you know?
I mean there's less people than cows here, but it's home
I'm guessing that you're wealthy from the city
No, don't get up. I'm the welcoming committee
Really, sitting by yourself is such a pity
I'm teasing you. It's just a little healthy fun, you dig me?

Oh, it's you again! Looks like you could use a friend
Sucks to be you, right? Maybe it's them shoes you're in
There's a lot of hooligans in this little school convinced
It's cool for them to use their strength and pull to be cruel to wimps
You know you kinda run like a chick?
I noticed when I chased you and you dropped your lunch by the bridge
No, I don't hate you, but it's just like the fish, eh dude?
The little ones get eaten up by the big

Perfect as I was, the sky opened up and cursed me from above
Was it all just a part of the plan?
When it's balled up your heart is as large as your hand
You only hurt the ones you love

We gotta stop meeting like this
You should be sucking your little lollipop not eating my fist
You're like a soggy mop with your weak little wrists
This is an awful lot like beating up chicks
What do you think that no one sees just what you are
When you're a guy hiding far too much Venus for a Martian
I don't beat you just to tease a little smart wimp
It's cause someone needs to, to teach you it's indecent that you want men

Perfect as I was, the sky opened up and cursed me from above
Was it all just a part of the plan?
When it's balled up your heart is as large as your hand
You only hurt the ones you love
You only hurt the ones you love, love, love, love

When you get what you want
What will it say of the tough guy you flaunt?

There's no cure for what you are
