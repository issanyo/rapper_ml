[Intro]
I'm no fucking good, and I never have been

[Verse 1]
I was born with a sick morbid addiction for the disgraceful
More than a bit tormented with a love for the distasteful
Sick fables told in a rhyme, disabled most of the mind
I had, with my mom and dad threw me out the pad cause i got so into wine
Kind'a had a lust for the hazardous stuff they just didn't like
Made 'em mad at us when we grab our nuts and had to cuss when they give us mics
Sip again, its like it did what spinach might do to a sailor
In the right mood I'll invite you to bite Lou's genitalia
Ever had your walnuts crushed, let a rapper call us nuts
Better have your balls tucked up tight if you like your draws uncut
You get your mic cord unplugged quicker than you get a ticket when you double park at a shop that sells doughnuts just a couple cars from a cop
I love to start with a scotch, or another hard liquor shot
Even when a fella swig a lot you can never tell if I'm lit or not
My, does it hit the spot when I trick a cop with a itch to lock me up
Probably just cause J and I got a little too much hiphop in us

[Hook]
It's a little bit devious, and a little ingenious
When your CD is teaching kids the meaning of what a heathen is
The devil wan'na get a piece of this but I won't let 'em
Still Heavens had it for the grievances I bet I don't get in
I'm a, little bit wrongdoer, but a bit like righteous
Still scribblin' my songs through the midst of a midlife crisis
They tellin' me that I'm the nicest but as much as folks would
They seldom mean how my life is I been up to no good

[Verse 2]
Malevolent resident, turned decadent president
Ever since Heaven sent me into a saloon full of bad medicine
J jettison beats through the board, bangin' time, reach through the chords
Like a modern day Edison who had invented his own Frankenstein
And made a rhyme way better than the rest of the rap rejects
Three steps ahead of the pack and destined to have respect
For incredible raps and tight shows, two devilish cats you might know
For craftin' more unforgettable tracks for the brats than Tyco
They thought he was a psycho cause he likes flows in a 3-4
And writes prose with his eyes closed while he drives home on a detour
Scourge of the police force on the run with a cold twelve-pack
Stupid and drunk and doin' a hundred and one with no belt strap
The ruinous one Louis has come tell that to our governor
I've taken the track to Hades and back and hell had to turn the oven up
Truth is they hated the rap music has greater impact
On views than the mistruths on the evening news so the devil's takin' it back

[Hook]
It's a little bit devious, and a little ingenious
When your CD is teaching kids the meaning of what a heathen is
The devil wanna get a piece of this but I won't let 'em
Still Heavens had it for the grievances I bet I don't get in
I'm a, little bit wrongdoer, but a bit like righteous
Still scribblin' my songs through the midst of a midlife crisis
They tellin' me that I'm the nicest but as much as folks would
They seldom mean how my life is I been up to no good

I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drink the cup dry
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drink the cup dry
