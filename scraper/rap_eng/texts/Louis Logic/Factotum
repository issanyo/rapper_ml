Louis Logic, Super Regular Recordings, 5g's Platinum, J.J. Brown

[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
Yo, before setting' it off know that the predator draws
More blood than an open wound against the leading competitor's gauze
Leaving sores on bleeding jaws on the path
You should keep your eyes on Louis Logic & the drunken pies on icon
Misconstruing optical illusions when boozing as bottles ooze and
Love songs of us getting our drunk on
Tippin' tequila 'til my tongue's warm, then fall off the stage
Pass out while writing a rhyme and scroll off the page
Wake up in a rage with the shakes, where's my love gone?
I'm un-calm, a bottle of Jack at my lips
And a Guinness I.V. in one arm, Bass Ale in the other
Makes tonight's Black & Tan, but I still fail to recover
I hit step six and my train of thought derails from the others
Daydreaming of a damsel with grain-alcohol wet lips
So it's a Beck's fifth for breakfast
I'll count it as the juice from that food group and mark it off the checklist

[Scratched Samples]
"When I get bent, I must represent"
"It's the truth, like vodk' one-eighty proof"
"Shorty let me tell you 'bout my only vice"
I gotta...
"Drink a beer
"Now gimme that
"When I get bent I must represent, no question
"I drink a Guinness Stout
"I take a small swig" (x2)
"Tap it and then crack it...

[Verse 2]
I was born to beer kegs at college dorms and pop's liquor cabinet
My drunken slur is like a British accent
Cause when I'm taking a flask to my face 'til I lay in the grass
And erase every trace of my past
I'm reborn a secret agent whose feet beat the pavement to the bar stool
At a bar full of drunken drivers called the carpool
With a preacher at my right side, a cop at my left
Double-fisting a bottle of Beck's and a vodka and Schweppes
I spit a sad life story with a Scotch intellect
And nod off in the middle, that's the possum effect
I'm still alive though, even after the shit close, I'm outside
Sharing sips of Cisco while I chill with a wino
Who suffers from bottle neglect
He need a pint of self esteem, plus a shot of respect
With such a delicate habit, it's a lot to protect
Cause Lady Liks is like a landlord, she got to collect

[Scratched Samples]

[Verse 3]
The drunken dragon's emerged from hibernation in a musky dungeon cavern
With an unparralled thirst that's unimagined
Swerving an old suburban with the front end crashed in
Signs of a hard night previous, start a devious bar fight
And escape with a six pack of Miller Lite and a cape
Draped over my shoulders with a mask hiding my face
I erase my own identity, and I'm not even speaking governmentally
First name is surname, scene from a memory in a black out
I was found with my back out, naked assed
It's like my friends are proposing cause they afraid to ask
Is Logic's doin' the shit that made 'em late to class?
The fool is back in the china shop, I got to break the glass
After toastin' with Icon, we raise the magic potion
And the drunken addits notion last devotion
Now that my bladder's soakin' with metaphors in it
I retreat to my suite at the Betty Ford clinic

[Scratched Sample: Black Sheep - "Pass The 40"]
"Pass the forty, pass me the forty, pass it if you may"
"Pass the forty, pass the forty"
"Pass the forty, pass me the forty, pass it if you may"
"Pass the forty cause my mothers not lookin'"
