[Sample: Newt from Aliens (1986)]
We better get back, cause it'll be dark soon
And they mostly come at night, mostly

[Verse 1: Snuff]
Uh, tonight's the night
Media 101 meets Louis Logic, nod your head to this

Yo, yo, no doubt we pushing out jewels like gold bonds
Feel the force of my tools, my best advice: stand aside
Tension is high when mischief night be my passion
Causing disturbance, with no excuses for my action

I'm on a bender from the last time we did this
And if I keep it up I'll be on everybody's shit list
My damage done from sunset 'til sunrise
Then I grab a forty to clean sleep out my eyes

But realize, I explain the terms loosely
Then carry my share of weight for Logic and LuceLeif
Nothing but a troubled misfit who's double-fisting
By the time we're done, all of y'all [up/are on the sand?]

[Chorus: Louis Logic]
This is mischief night
We down to drink a fifth tonight
Up in the bar, and start picking fights
'Cause when it's all said and done
It's always spliffs to light
So let 'em front, this is better than the shit you write

Boy, this is mischief night
We down to drink a fifth tonight
Up in the bar, and start picking fights
'Cause when it's all said and done
It's always spliffs to light
So let 'em front, this is better than the shit you write

[Verse 2: LuceLeif]
With Logic on the squad, way too much to handle
Appetite to battle mics, leave the stage in shambles
When I flip shit, I'm [?] equipped with verbal ammo
Making kids scramble, every word is like an arrow

When I flip rhymes, and this time, you the target
[Keeping iced scrillas?] in line like supermarkets
You can't step to us, we the smartest, the truest artists
Should've known better, but you're probably too retarded

To figure out the best routes [is with your mouth?]
No doubt, [cause it'll/the set'll?] stay on top like Guinness stout
Got the missile out, leaving your dome busted
Some peeps hate the dark but us, yo, we love it

[Chorus: Louis Logic] (x2)

[Verse 3: Louis Logic]
God bless my sixth sense to invent
A means to spend my sixpence
On nudie flicks and pitch tents

I'm too hard on my lungs
But still get my fumar on drunk
'Til they resemble two charred chunks
And [leave you?] all bugged, two-star chumps
Running the rat race, if you want lumps

There's a fat chance you can get a fat face
Keep your dirty mitts off my beer cans, cigarettes and ashtrays
That way fair is fair, and I'm prepared
To spare you from a foot lost in your derriere

We're the seedier version of the media
I love to tell the truth but lying's easier
Feed the beat anemia, I'm a professional charlatan
Arguing in favor of alcohol and Parliaments

My only armaments for fighting off sobriety
This is mischief night, the law doesn't apply to me

[Chorus: Louis Logic] (x2)

[Outro: Louis Logic]
Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh uh, yo
This is Louis Logic, your co-host
With my man LuceLeif
My man Snuff, Media 101
You know what I mean?
This is mischief night
Leaving flaming bags of shit on your front porch
And break your windows, and the whole nine
And the whole nine
