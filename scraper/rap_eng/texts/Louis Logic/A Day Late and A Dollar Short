I fell asleep with the lights on last night
A dream helped me see my wrongs under black light
I let my self esteem splash like cum on the walls
And fled the scene from another sad crash site
I probably shoulda gave more effort
To make more records than stray dog sessions
What came first the tour date or erection?
One more place checked off for your collection

Pats on the back, stud
Rockstar cool crashed out on the mat in the bathtub
Like you got harpooned
Gettin' fat on the rap love, drugs, Pabst and the bad blood
Sad but true, you pissed in your pants
This was your chance to give to your fans
A little more than the dick in your pants
Bet you wish that your parents didn't see the whole charade
They watched you throw away the dough you made at shows you played
You coulda been a rap star with his own parade
I never meant the first black car in the motorcade

I fell asleep with the lights on
And they shined on all of my wrongs that I never got to better into bygones
A little bit less all night and a little more effort into my songs
I coulda been around when I break on through
And that haunts me so I haunt you
I never dreamed I would die young
Lie to me and you choke my chain
If I didn't die, people wouldn't know my name

I never shoulda been so thick
Or played the tough guy schtick if the pen don't fit
By the time I learned to trust my gift and be brave
The beat changed on and the end closed in
Such is fate now that I love my skin
They dug my grave and I jumped right in

This is a mistake I'm not the next Nick Drake
If kids wait, I was gettin' close to my big break
Fans said if I'd just make one more great tape with J.J
I would have seen my first big payday
But I'm a day late, and a dollar short
Being away makes the fans just want it more
Whether you're a martyr or you were gone before greatness
You become a connoisseurs favorite
And I don't say it to express regret
For tardy payments and creditors I left with debt
How can I expect to rest
An artist anguished I haven't made my best just yet

I fell asleep with the lights on

I fell asleep with the lights on
And they shined on all of my wrongs that I never got to better into bygones
A little bit less all night and a little more effort into my songs
I coulda been around when I break on through
And that haunts me so I haunt you
I never dreamed I would die young
Lie to me and you choke my chain
If I didn't die, people wouldn't know my name

I fell asleep with the lights on
And they shined on all of my wrongs that I never got to better into bygones
A little bit less all night and a little more effort into my songs
I coulda been around when I break on through
And that haunts me so I haunt you
I never dreamed I would die young
Lie to me and you choke my chain
If I didn't die, people wouldn't know my name

I fell asleep with the lights on
I never dreamed I would die young

I fell asleep with the lights on
I never dreamed I would die young
