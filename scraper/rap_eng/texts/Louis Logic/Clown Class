[Verse One] [Celph Titled]
Celph Titled the Crocodile Hunter
I keep it gator
The monster in your closet that you've always been afraid of
The type to come through and not say "Peace" when I leave
Choke your crew out in army jackets and leave 'em fatigued
And we scoop hood rats with mouse traps
Give you the gas face and douse that
You survivin'? I doubt that
Robbin' your grandma for her mortgage loan
I'm tryin' to figure out how to strangle you with a cordless phone
My force is known to leave cops in plain clothes
Layin' stiff on the floor with red stains on their clothes
And if the Feds catch me
I'mma go wild
Tote a rocket launcher to the court room and blow trial
My style's Bumpy, attitude stay grumpy
And I don't fuck around dunny
I got so much ice up in my crib, and nowhere to rest my head
The only time I tuck my jewels is when I put 'em to bed
Put your tracks against mine
That's a disturbing gamble
I'll piss on your beat machine and give you a urine sample
And while you writin' rhymes tryin' to come up with shit
I'll come up on your bitch and leave my cum up on her upper lip

[Hook] [Louis Logic]
In the school of hard knocks we're at the top of our classes
Shit, the bullies even kiss our asses
Whether or not our report card passes
Class clowns say we're the real smart asses
We run shit
And punch kids in their punk tummies
Front dummy but you're on the run from me
Majik's got detention, Lou's got suspension
And Celph got expelled for snatchin' niggas lunch money

[Verse Two] [Majik Most]
Majik Most motherfuckers, yeah back in effect
Fuckin' your head up like a John Larroquette hairnet
Bullet's whistlin'
Rippin' through your neck and your chest
Fuck Kevlar
Rock a Mexican festival vest
You need a testicle check
You're a man with breasts
Bustin' out your dress, I'll make your bird chest fly west
Never the less, your style's fake
So bust it
I'll pistol whip you
With a Civil War Musket
Sayin' that's your girl but she shows me love
Said Titanic was a movie about my penis in a bathtub
I hate fake thugs, always fuckin' up the clubs
I'll beat you with a coffee cup, now you've been mugged
You need to be unplugged and whipped with a cord
Ripped and in torn I'm always flippin' this song
Russian fur coats, I'm a star with this
I'll brush you off like a conceited paleontologist
Get your head chopped off and burnt to a crisp
Till it's a leather tote bag and you'll be saaaaadddd
I'm bad news like I'm a paperboy with an Uzi
With a cancerous tumor oozing (Ooooohhhh)
You're cruisin' for a brusin' when you're drivin' to my show
With a pink convertible Pinto, lettin' your hair blow
Catch me down in Mexico, sexin' your ho
I'll stab you with a sword from the Antique Road Show

[Hook] [Louis Logic]
In the school of hard knocks we're at the top of our classes
Shit, the bullies even kiss our asses
Whether or not our report card passes
Class clowns say we're the real smart asses
We run shit
And punch kids in their punk tummies
Front dummy but you're on the run from me
Majik's got detention, Lou's got suspension
And Celph got expelled for snatchin' niggas lunch money

[Verse Three] [Louis Logic]
Yo, I'll come to your apartment with a gun under a parka
Full of blank side
Use the other day to pull a bank heist
And say, "Hi"
By wavin' the barrel
Right in your face
And make you shit inside your Old Navy apparel
I never claimed to be the friendliest kid
But I'll teach you what an enemy is
And beat you with the shit end of the stick
My own people's will tell you that I can be a dick
And they know first hand
I've treated some of them to a fist
When motherfuckers famished
I grab the oven hand mitt
And stuff his damn lips with a lovely knuckle sandwich
I'll leave your muzzle bandaged like a dog with a lampshade
The double standard is some gauze and some band aids
So all that braggin' when you catch a case, forget it ace
You stupid motherfucker, you're not tougher for gettin' AIDS
Get it straight
Your D-Day been diggin' for years
We got wax too, but ours isn't from ears motherfucker
