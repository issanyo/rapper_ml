[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
Welcome to the Lou show for all you new folks
This is the story of the boy who fell into a loophole
I delved in as a pupil, hell bent on a truthful
Mission as a musician for self improvement twofold
I cooked a plan to never sell consumers fool's gold
While others took the standard and held it to a new low
Seldom given kudos for launching from the comfort zone
Compelled to pick a new road, taunted by the chums I'd known
You get what you sew, a poor fit from how much I'd grown
I guess I never thought that I'd end up alone
I would have loved a home playing bigger better stages
Born to beat the drum my own way and I can never change it

[Hook]
I forgot more investment of the heart
Than a less brave man would impart
Everybody loves a winner
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm

I forgot more investment of the heart
Than a less brave man would impart
Everybody loves a winner
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm

[Verse 2: Louis Logic]
Good evening, babes and gents, how'd you find me
By the trail of weeping ladyfriends I let down behind me?
Barely even making rent I set out to find peace
And let my less courageous friends frown on my dreams
I had to take a step out the rhyme scene
How do people stay content with less ground than I've seen?
My pop said to get on track
So I looked in the mirror then I placed my bet on black
I'd rather have 'em say I'm gay or wrecked on crack
Than predictable when I'm on stage or pressed on wax
I don't regret the past or my selected path
I take risks cause I respect the craft and you can bet on that

[Hook]
I forgot more investment of the heart
Than a less brave man would impart
Everybody loves a winner
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm

I forgot more investment of the heart
Than a less brave man would impart
Everybody loves a winner
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm



[Outro]
Everybody loves a winner
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm

Everybody loves a winner
(the rush, the odds, the stakes, the cards)
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm
(the breaks, the charge, the take, the loss)

Everybody loves a winner
(the rush, the odds, the stakes, the cards)
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm
(the breaks, the charge, the take, the loss)

Everybody loves a winner
(the rush, the odds, the stakes, the cards)
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm
(the breaks, the charge, the take, the loss)

Everybody loves a winner
(the rush, the odds, the stakes, the cards)
Throw it all down and bet the fucking farm
(the breaks, the charge, the take, the loss)

The rush, the odds, the stakes, the cards
The breaks, the charge, the take, the loss

The rush, the odds, the stakes, the cards
The breaks, the charge, the take, the loss

The rush, the odds, the stakes, the cards
The breaks, the charge, the take, the loss
