[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
I came close to giving up rap
But would've missed getting my mitts
On the same folks who broke it and kicking some ass
[Over] the feeling, dishing out justice
Like a lawman whipping out muskets as if it's the past

This is a [gasp/gas], when I slip in and crash your birthday bash
And leave the men and women aghast
At first, they dash for the door
But of course when the [arbiter? pours forth?]
They wind up kissing my ignorant ass

I act like I don't know any better
But the truth is I'm both morally ruthless and a go-getter
Which more or less means I won't let em, can't slip by me
[To make the fans sick nightly? with my show efforts]

I don't let up, I don't give and I don't bargain
And don't mind admitting I'm so fed up with most artists
And won't pardon none of your indiscretion, I'm so hardened
Like an erection in your ladyfolk's gardens, I'm statuesque
A rabid pest with a six [packed?] and a six-pack of Beck's
At his best going crazy at his desk
I went over the cuckoo's nest already
Now I'm going batshit next
Let me catch my breath, then let me catch you
Trying to match the mess I make of a track
And I'll laugh to death
And I ain't trying to say that you're wack
I'd rather let you say you're the best, claim a new record
And wait for the second you're taking it back

[Chorus: Mdusu & Louis Logic]
We just don't play unless we're playing for keeps
A cutthroat way of relaying a speech
Plus folks say we've got a way with the beats
Starving artists who came here to eat

We get respect, check. We get the love: Yep
Are we among the best? Yes
Who the women hug? Us
There's not escaping [the way to compete?]
And no mistaking we're playing for keeps

[Verse 2: Mdusu]
So how you know where the [truth] is proper?
Simple: Deuce is on it with Louis Logic
This is skill and you don't got it, so move it Gromit
Flow's so fierce, I leave lyrics tattooed on foreheads

Plays every sound system, our street games a wrap
They keep skating back to replay the track
You weak fakes are wack, we'll leave your trains of thought
Derailed and smashed from BK to [Taz? Thames?]

I'm clever with the scripts while you petty little kids
Couldn't spit [smoke?] if you had hash resin on your lips
We're the kings of kicking sense and you know what they say
Those that can do, and those that can't [widget?] heads on the internet

Just jealous haters demonstrating why they've never made shit
You pussies couldn't flow if you were fucking menstruating
Yeah, I said it baby, and you know it's true
Even with a pair of dice on snake eyes, you couldn't roll a deuce

[This?] the overdue, international collab
[?] take fifty caliber raps and take kiddies back to the lab
And if there's any fly shit that you have, you get it from us
So you best give them packages back

The simple plan of attack: rap better on better beats
[With fat mittens to chase that?] cheddar from west to east
And I'm out, but I'll leave you geeks with one truth
[My boys Juan and Ethan? hate? the ?]

[Chorus]
