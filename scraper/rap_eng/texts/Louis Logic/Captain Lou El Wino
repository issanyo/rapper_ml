(Move)
Don't get accustomed to the seat you've been resting in
Get up on your feet and receive the New Testament
(move)
For those who need a new medicine
J.J. Brown's cooking up the fresh beats and Lou's lecturing

[Verse 1]
I'm your misguided leader, nice to meet ya
Like you need to a sick high-school teacher
The type you'd see under a stall on his tippy-toes
Women know it's him by his nice new sneakers
The scourge of the restroom, birthed from a test-tube
A pervert to the rescue that purposefully gets nude
To let you get a closer peek at what you can kiss
The set of two rosy cheeks on which to pucker your lips (It's)
The radical rascal who has to harass you
The substitute sits him in the back of the classroom
In the dunce cap pointed lid
Some cats feel they were made to rap but I was born conjoined to it
I have connections, moistened lips to my erections
Cause I enjoy a kiss in my private section
So any ladies interested in diving lessons
Join the list back stage, I'm the guy undressing

[Chorus]
Pass the booze to Captain Lou
I'm not asking you, it's something that you have to do
So let's crack a brew then act a fool
Then crash until we wake up in the afternoon bent
We're out to lose when the room get a knock from doing [?]
Any lack of movement does not belong
So when J drops the horns, they rock along
And anyone going after us may not preform

[Scratching]
So check it out ya'll
'Ill kid, ready to wreck mics pronto"
"Who will be the captain of this ship"
"The listeners choice is Logic"

[Verse 2]
I got a song for every mood on the spectrum
But Louis' best ones are like a boot in the rectum
My music reflects some of the lewdest suggestions
So they naked with the records to the room where they pressed them
Who would contest him in an open forum
He got more chicks and licks than a drunken Mormon
Nobody comes before him, not when it comes to pouring
Something warm in his guts until he's drunk and dormant
I'm one performance from a room in a prison
So tell your sons and daughters that the youth shouldn't listen
When they say my music screws up your system
They mean it ruins your wisdom
Not the one that plays the tune when you listen
Who got a more skewed view and ambition
He's only wishing beautiful women assume the position
It's a real sad comment on the human condition
When you made screwin' and licks into the newest religion

[Chorus]
Pass the booze to Captain Lou
I'm not asking you, it's something that you have to do
So let's crack a brew then act a fool
Then crash until we wake up in the afternoon bent
We're out to lose when the room get a knock from doing [?]
Any lack of movement does not belong
So when J drops the horns, they rock along
And anyone going after us may not preform

[Scratching]
"They doing it once more"
"It's now, peep my mic technique"
"The captain of the ships, I make em walk the plank"
Louis Logic, J.J. Brown

[Verse 3]
Somebody stop me or at least lock your doors
Police got the force searching street blocks and forest
To knock me, unlock me with the key, convict stored
I'm so stuck in a hot seat my jean bottoms scorched
Do not endorse the king of rotten sports
Who got impure thoughts about the women on the courts
He's a long shot by the scouting crop reports
And got dropped because he kept spraying his jockey shorts
So pass the booze to Captain Lou
I'm not asking you, I'm staggering through then snatching two
Cause whenever I feel like getting mad at you
I put a smack into your ego till it's black and blue
I'm acting rude on a beat like I own it
With an attitude like I'm the chief I know this
Half of you just wanna be like the dopest
It won't happen dude, put that in your peace pipe and smoke it
