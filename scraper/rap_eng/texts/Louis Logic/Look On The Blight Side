You will run out of time. You will be cut short
Before you've really found your prime. You still need much more
Down the line you're only building up toward
The dust storm, chillin' at your window cill and front door
You could get outta bed, but what for?
Sittin' on the couch instead scratching your nuts raw?
You're runnin' outta meds for your lovelorn heart
But they won't accept your card at the drugstore
And what's more, the pills don't help
And of course they won't prescribe enough to kill oneself
You found the one store in NY whose pharmacist is runnin' an honest biz
Except he gives you bills from hell
And somehow you're still compelled to press on
You think that even bad luck runs out, well you're dead wrong
You havin' fun now? Just wait till global warming makes us vampires
Who can't come out the house till after sundown

Don't get up, it's just your life
Get your hopes up and it cuts you down to size
Plan for the worst and hope you're less surprised
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies

I came across a thumbtack when I stepped on it
Jumped back and put my foot flat in cat excrement
Well isn't that excellent?
I think I'll have a scribble at my will and last testament
I'm not a pessimist, I bad luck a lot
I'm a rapper, and my dad was a cop
I got a lousy career, so I doused it in beer to drown it
I bet you that does the job
How do you steer a ship you know's gonna sink?
You don't. You let it slip right over the brink
Let's pretend the world is still flat, go for a drink
Spill glass after glass and let the boat skip the rink
If it stinks, yep, that bird did hit you
And it's not good luck, holmes, that shirt did fit you
Not to burst your tissue, but your therapist'll never fix your first big issue

Don't get up, it's just your life
Get your hopes up and it cuts you down to size
Plan for the worst and hope you're less surprised
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies

Don't get up, it's just your life
Get your hopes up and it cuts you down to size
Plan for the worst and hope you're less surprised
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies

The world is filthy. Your girlfriend will cheat
It kills me that you pay so much for stuff the sky spills free
Brrr, it's chilly for an ugly guy on trial
When you've got the kinda smile that the judge'll find guilty
Hmm... another fine? Bill me
The check is in route, but I expect it to bounce
If those creditors that never give up get in this house
It won't be for my checking account. I bet they try and kill me
You find it silly, well I find it inconvenient
That the very guy who built me's sense of timing isn't lenient
Why'd the devil bother hiring the demons?
Stop the fire! The cost has gotten higher with each season
God's a writer, and I'm a character employed to be hurt
It's not required, but he's actually enjoying the work
Spoiler alertâ€¦ the story's gonna end with him burying the boy in the dirt


Don't get up, it's just your life
Get your hopes up and it cuts you down to size
Plan for the worst and hope you're less surprised
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies

Don't get up, it's just your life
Get your hopes up and it cuts you down to size
Plan for the worst and hope you're less surprised
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies

Plan for the worst and hope you're less surprised
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies

Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies
Nobody gets it right, and everybody dies
