[Intro]
Ah, yeah, yeah
This is Louis Logic
That nigga you don't see
Cuz he got kicked out of class (The Odd Couple)
And I brought my other knucklehead with me
My man J.J. Brown
On some bully shit
Bringin heat on the beats
Stuffin nerdy niggas in lockers

[Verse 1]
Give me a beat and listen to me
Niggas'll see I'm like the oilman cause I deliver your heat
I didn't say you were gay, it's just that you're sweet
And catch vibes on the westside of christopher street
It's no wonder you wish you were me
I ain't some type of bitch, who when he takes a piss sits on the seat
That's why all your chickens agree they rather kick it with me
Cuz I suprise em every now and then with mystery meat (boh)
Who's the clever kid who use his leverage as a rapstar to get into a
Coochies second lips
Lou's new collections is smooth and effortless
Like 2 screwing, sweaty chicks with lubed apendages
Whoever just is boos and nemesis
Had rather move their settlement away in to a new development
Cuz I'm not too intelligent to stoop to your level
And you're so low down I'm shooting hoops wit the devil

[Hook]
In the school of hard knocks
We're at the top of our classes
Shit the bullies even kiss our asses
Whether or not my report card passes
Class-clowns will tell you were the real smart-asses
We run shit and punch kids
In their plump tummies, somebody is always on the run from me
The abott's got detention, jay's on suspension
And myself, I got expelled for snatching niggas lunch money

[Verse 2]
Yo, I got sick inch for scotch about a fifth a shot
Just as hot, as the burning in your sisters crouch
Which is not why I never snick a snatch
I rather flip the latch on the cabinet to you pops liquor stash
Jay Love hit the hash like a coffee-shop spatula
My fangs puncture a keg like a malt and hops dracula
That's way I always sleep in the daylight, cause I creep in the late night
Leaving victims leaking like drain pipes
People saying it ain't right
But I can't help that I'm so damn selfish
I got my hands on a female fans pelvis like I'm some bad Elvis
Who's from a parallel universe
Giratin his hips to the dick carousel through the skirts
You know a man you think is rude at first
Give me some room to work
And allow me to introduce the nerd to the dirt
Cuz Lou's the worst type of jerk to dealing with
He'll bruise you first physically then hurt your feelings bitch

[Hook]
In the school of hard knocks
We're at the top of our classes
Shit the bullies even kiss our asses
Whether or not, my report card passes
Class-clowns will tell you were the real smart-asses
We run shit and punch kids
In their plump tummies somebody is always on the run from me
The abott got detention, Jay's on suspension
And myself, I got expelled for snatching niggas lunch money

[Verse 3]
I'm like Merlin in a sherlin when I sip a beer
Or a wizard in winter gear who makes a guiness dissapear
Quicker than a chicks brazier during foreplay
Or drugdealers when the pigs are here to storm your hallway
Performing all day with Jay and the abott
Makin the magic that has addicts celebrating their habits
I've got a cult following, of so many young adults swallowing
So many jameson flasks that it give em adult tolerance
I'm major in classes, on savorin asses
With greater than average curves like antique vases and glasses
And on the day the give me a masters
I traded it faster than you can say vodka for a case of some ??
Some say that a rapper is worth as much as he drinks
Fuck what he thinks that's why I fill myself with suds like a sink
And to my reason ain't gon' get stock on the blink
But that's just one of them things
To give me something to discuss with my shrink

[Hook]
In the school of hard knocks
We're at the top of our classes
Shit the bullies even kiss our asses
Wether or not, my report card passes
Class-clowns will tell you were the real smart-asses
We run shit and punch kids
In their plump tummies, somebody is always on the run from me
Now The abott got detention, jay's on suspension
And myself, I got expelled for snatching niggas lunch money

[Verse 4]
So who's that guy in the dunce cap sitting in the back of class?
And when the teacher walks by he's smacking her ass
Cutting in the school storeline snatching your cash
Pushing the smart kids ass in the trash
Motherfucker I'm the bully
And I'm coming 'round the corner
I warn ya and now I'm rainen punches down on ya
Y'all better head for the office
Tell them to get your mummy to come and get you
Because your tummy is nauseous
