[SCRATCHING]
From the wrong side of the track

[LOUIS LOGIC, VERSE 1]
I'm lookin at a chance to change my stars today
Across the platform but that sure seems far away
You're on the brooklyn bound side, lookin' down
I live in Queens, and in between a car just came
So I could like, give you a sign with my mind, or give a cough
That's corny, but I don't want to find our signals crossed
Or leave it up to chance you just get aboard the next train and jet
And give me more next day regret
So lets take a step to let this be the day we met
Incase destiny and fate forget
I got a heavenly engagement set
And I've been tryin to be an angel but Ive yet to meet my angelette
I'd make a bet with myself, tell 'em to seize the day
Maybe pressure would help, theres seldom an easy way
If ever I felt that I would need to pray
Its safe for me to say it'd be today
So now its like

[LOUIS LOGIC, Hook (SUNG)]
I just can't shake the feeling that theres something about you
And I don't want to leave here without you in my life
It just doesn't seem right
No matter how hopelessly I wish that you would notice me, you don't
Some guys make this look so easy
But thats just not me

[Hook (RAPPED)]
I would've loved to try to cross the tracks if I had courage
And fortune would've brought me back

[LOUIS LOGIC, VERSE 2]
Now is there something I'm supposed to do
That would bring me close to you and end my single loner blues
Cause you could think my messy hair and vintage clothes are cute
Or when you stare back, you could think I'm homeless too
I'm so confused about which road to choose
Take the stairway over to your side, I shout an ode to you
From afar, I probably sound like any dude in a bar
And if I transfered I'd create a chance for you to depart
Is it usually hard to do what your hearts tellin' you?
I would've moved from the start if I knew what the smart fellas do
This ain't the brand of love Hallmark cards sell to you;
Seldom true, whimsy for the not-so-well-to-do
So help me through all the the self doubt, and cowardice
Walkin' in lead welded shoes- held down and powerless
To tell the truth I don't know how I'll come out of this
But if I don't take myself to you, you're gone, and thats how it is

[LOUIS LOGIC, Hook (SUNG)]
I just can't shake the feeling that theres something about you
And I don't want to leave here without you in my life
It just doesn't seem right
No matter how hopelessly I wish that you would notice me, you don't
Some guys make this look so easy
But thats just not me

[Hook (RAPPED)]
I would've loved to try to cross the tracks if I had courage

[LOUIS LOGIC, VERSE 3]
With all these gaps that seperate us, will we meet
Or will this be another +Beat Street+, and I'm ? ? ?
I can't let the anguish over a trek this dangerous
Or whether fate is with me tonight, decide were left as strangers
Who would accept the shamless coward who never tried
Starin at a better life on legs and just let it slide
Am I just petrified she won't say yes?
If I measured my reluctance would my hope weigh less?
Whether I miss my shift, miss my train, or whether or not
It's the same, I still sit in vain, left at the dock
Whatever the cops do, if they catch me or not
I'll measure the cost in knowing that I let her slip off
So its ready or not, now or never, across +The Great Divide+
I lept to the bottom and made for my ladies side
Well if this is to be the day I died
And judgement visits me, I can truely say I tried
