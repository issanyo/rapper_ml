Check it one
Check it two
Check it three, four, five and...
And a one-un-un un two-ooh-ooh-ooh, three-ee-ee-ee
Meta-four, five, six, seven, eight
Watch those woofers levitate
Set the bass, nine and ten
(Heal up rewind!) Play that line again
Watch those woofers levitate
Now find a friend and start chimin' in
To the sound of the song when the vinyl spins
We goin' back to the
We goin' back to the
We goin' back to the first line again
And a one and a two and a three and a meta, meta-four
Get up y'all
Five and six, find a chick
Grind her till y'all gettin' off
Seven, eight, nine and ten
Now relax with an ice cold Heineken
We goin' back to the
We goin' back to the...
We goin' back, back, way back, all the way back to the grill
There's no more reason to spill
It's worked for the season to build
