[Louis Logic and FBLSQ singing]
Leave that Crazy Horse alone {*3X*}

[Chief Chinchilla]
But it be callin me man! {*horse neighing*} "HELLO!"

[Louis Logic and FBLSQ singing]
Check it
One day I went to the sto'
To get me an ice cold forty-oh
I hit the cooler and had a choice
Olde English or Crazy Horse {*neighing*}
I never drank that Horse befo'
I paid my dough and I was out the do'
I drank that Horse and saw a skirt
With a real fat ass and tried to flirt
We went to her place drunk as hell
And I lost my judgment and sense of smell
I went in raw and I'm sad to say
The next day I pissed out a gamma ray, shit

{*Chief's urination sound*}

[Chief Chinchilla]
AHH! OHH~! Fuck, fuckin bitch, SHIT!!
OHHHHH SHIT! Fuck... ooooh FUCK
AHHHHH! Ooooh, fuck, BITCH!

[Louis Logic and FBLSQ singing]
And the moral of the song
Is leave that Crazy Horse alone {*neighing*}
Drink a V8 nigga... stupid ass

[Chief Chinchilla]
You shoulda had a V8 but you had to be bold didn't you?
