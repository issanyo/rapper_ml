[Intro: Louis Logic]
Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, yo
I'm getting real tired of childish ass niggas
Judging a book by its cover
Think a pretty motherfucker like me
Won't get foulmouthed and grimy on a nigga
You know what I mean, yo?

[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
I'm willing and able, to start spilling a fable
But first quench my thirst to keep my syllables stable
I spent the rent on drinking and now they killing my cable
In love with lady liq', still I'm unfaithful

At times I need a face full of breasts
At times I make hateful threats and practice distasteful sex
But my thirst for spitting rhymes is two times
My unquenchable thirst for snatching a purse that isn't mine

My first bitin' line of coke
Was the dope I spit in this rhyme I wrote
And quoted in my liner notes
My warped mind will find a joke in eulogies

And though hell hurts, I'm so well versed in tomfoolery
That I have to practice it, the backwards activist
Who manages to hold one of the highest batting averages
We'll run up in your studio with scattered savages
Trample your sampler, and leave your DAT in bandages

[Chorus: Louis Logic]
(Eminem: I used to be a loud mouth, remember me)
Til I fouled out and graduated to a human outhouse
Ejected from the rap game for cursing the crowd out
Foul-mouthed and I (I used to be a loudmouth)

[Verse 2]
My ex-chick called me sexist when I called her a bitch
I was drunk though, excuse me if I faltered a bit
Your punk flow wouldn't get you through one show
Cause what you reap I'll un-sow
Launching beer bottles from the front row

A mad vandal, pillaging cribs with panhandles
I'll burn your offices and have your promo ads canceled
Push back your release date
Beating street teams in each state
For their free tapes, and escape with a clean slate

I'm Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Suspicion
Obnoxious devil throwing peace signs
When I'm guilty like Richard M. Nixon
A sickness affliction, vicious condition
That causes me to cook in the bathroom and shit in the kitchen

I fit the description of sick, twisted and strange
A kid that's deranged, lobotomized and missing a brain
Sodomized with a liquor bottle and few cool brews
A silly cuckoo with a few screws loose

[Chorus] (x2)

[Verse 3]
I practice peer pressure and promote unsafe sex
On my tour of beer lectures, with one day left
I'm one stray head who corrupts the youth, fuck the truth
I plug drugs as a substitute

I'm a teacher in your district, leading you to mischief
Feeding you logistics that's featured on my diskettes
I need to be enlisted in clinics, for exhibiting sickness
And eating cats til their clitoris twitches

Bleeding raps and living in stitches and wounds
The deepest that I get is when my dick's in the womb
I put my fist to buffoons, and on the rare occasion
When I'm drunk and dazed, I put my lips to balloons

Spaced out like I live on the moon, with Andy Kaufman
Do me and Latka sip vodka? The answer's often
And I'm not just standing sportsman, I hunt emcees
I'm unfriendly, spitting til my tongue's empty

[Chorus] (x2)

[Sample: ?]
Now you listen to me, mister
God dit not put me on this earth to be awakened
To foul-mouthed suggestions from a foul-mouthed
Hooligan like of you

[Scratches: ?]
