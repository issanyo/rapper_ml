[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
Yo
When the lights go out in a psycho's house
It's cause I don't wanna be seen slicin the white ho's blouse
Down the back before I inspect the skin
And slice two diamonds sections in another bitch's precious flesh again
Police dream of arresting him, Buffalo Bill
Agent Starling even shot him but there's some you don't kill
Not with man-made guns and knives, cause once he dies
You turn your back on him and he comes alive for one more try
Run and hide if you must
But I'm in the shrubs outside of ya house pushing ya bedroom window up
So when you burst through the front door tonight
I'll be the crazy jerk who's in pursuit screaming 'RUN FOR YA LIFE'
You can pump up your Nikes and Reeboks
And hike your knee socks and run like you're Steve Austin
I'll catch you, no getaways from Jason the Leatherface
The guy who keeps marching like he's sleepwalking

[Verse 2: Louis Logic]
Don't look for Lou if you know whats good for you
Cos wouldn't you make a nice addition to my woman-suit
Infact I'll put a new blade on my chainsaw
Sharper than a chipped crooked tooth to cut your arms and legs off
Hells bells, I got me twelve shells
That are all well swelled up with jezebel pelts
And I'm set to sell a line of clothing
Of the finest woven bits of human flesh that I have chosen from the hives I've stolen
Looks like I captured you just in time
To skin you and add you to next month's spring line
Am I a monster or an entrepreneur? (YOU DECIDE)
Is it any worse if I kill you or sponsor your suicide?
Thats not a question you should hope that you'll be asking
You'll be dead, now put the fucking lotion in the basket
Or else it gets the hose again
Trapped in a cell at the bottom of my well with the wetness closing in

[Hook](2x)

[Verse 3: Louis Logic]
When the transformation's complete, stay in your seat
I'm about to make a retreat, straight to the street
Cause it's alot of secret agents, police and feds
Thats gonna be upset they missed the chance to see me dead
So you can laugh at the fact that I'm dressed as a ho
You won't be laughing, when my knife is pressed to your throat
Forget what you know about Lou's records
I don't give a flying fuck who's better
I'm tryna trap a new heffer
And use the skin to make a costume
That looks like your pop dukes and sneak in your mom's room
I got you, when you least expect it
So you can save your feeble efforts to beef with records
Seek an exit, while I chase you through the living room
With a spoon to sneak a section of your skin-tissue
Cause I'm not another rapper who looks evil
I'm the livin proof, that bad things happen to good people
