[Louis Logic: Verse 1]


We rub a couple young cats who make rap, intent on new things
Till we pulled ourselves up by our Timbo boot strings
Now introducing, two unrelated kinfolk who sing, and rap like its a family crew thing
J's been producing, tracks so real they're more packed with feeling than a menstrual mood swing
Lou brings to the table, sprinkles a fable, and raw raps for meals on instrumentals you drink
While you blink your eyes, we mingled by, single-file, and put our music in the aisles
And put the mom and pop shop kids in smiles, with our infantile humor and our vintage style
Folks in denial, they changed their tune, but not half as much as JJ and Lou
How can something already made great improve, we never came late to school, but may break the rules
I took the hate that fueled my first CD, and made a tray for tools I use to improve diversity
So many MCs play the fool perfectly, and prefer to be untrained in school purposely
Learn from me, take control of your true means, a vocalist who dreams, can open a new scene
Louis and J didn't just turn over a new leaf, this music we made is growing a few trees

[Conversation Interlude]

"Whats on the menu for today J?"
[JJ Brown]
"How about grade A music from a group in its heyday."
[Louis Logic]
"JJ, Louis, and Dan D, are using these plant seeds
To grow fresh music the fans need."
[JJ Brown]
"Is there a chance we find the beat? Never that
Better rhymes and beats mean what, we make better tracks"
[Louis Logic]
"We let the stats do the chit-chat
Made 13 straight great so you would never have to skip tracks."

[Louis Logic: Verse 2]

Is this the start of something beautiful?
Or have I missed the mark and we are just having fun as usual?
Probably a bit of both, I'm not into written notes, hitting notes, or spitting flows that's just as musical
Whats the funeral for, as if every tune thats recorded, is scored in a room at a morgue
You would have thought there hasn't been a suitable song, or a dude who performed well since 92 or before
But its two in the morning and i'm still awake, doing some yawning with my head on a song before the pillowcase
How many groups that conform will it take, to fill your crate up with the dead weight until it breaks
Rappers been running stealing plates for 20 years, children playing villain games in their older brother's gear
How someone wearing a silly clown suit from the laundry, ever became cool is beyond me
And whats more we got used to believing, that 2 of 15 hits constitutes an achievement
Nobody lets one rapper do the emceeing, you get crammed with so many guests there's no room to breathe in
But its only the best J and I are feeding 'em, cause most of you left hot out, for mild and medium
That's why we're teaching them, to shine the tedium, and put a higher premium, on fine ingredients
