[Intro: Louis Logic]
Yo, check it out, this is Louis Logic
My man Celph Titled on the boards
J.J. Brown on the scratches
Fuck all of y'all actors, know what I mean? Check it out
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
What I spit is slick like, porn flick chicks and Vaseline
Going down south like Big Mike
Cause when it comes to pushing weight
My wax is like crack to fiends
You have to light by crafting pipes out of the DAT machine
Niggas afraid to play with me, like Magic's team
Cause circle start catching purple hearts like Vietnam marines
They hate me but still buy, like niggas and Koreans
It's a dirty business but my hands are clean
How many worthy critics on this green earth diss Lou's flow?
Kids you know would suck dick for a Louis Logic T-shirt
So it's gotta be worth spending the loot
On something 170 proof before I step in the booth
So pissed, I'll never recoup, and if you ever get dissed
It's me and family and friends in cahoots
So send in the troops like Schwarzkopf, we neutering niggas
Cutting your balls off so you'll never produce
I'll put your head in a noose, not that I chill with the klan
But I'm an extremely militant man
So down for the cause I'd spill on your fam'
And just know, before I beat you
That I would cheat like Hilary's man

[Chorus]
My squad is like vagrants
We wander the streets and pavement
And try to stay bent, disguised as secret agents
Motherfuckers is trying to find out the plans to our mission
And positioning of our secret hideout

[Samples]
{"Freeze!"}
{"Down on your knees"}
{"I never run when I'm in trouble"}
{"My enemies freeze"}
{"Secret"} {"Agent"}
{"Brothers in the place"}
{"Don't fight"}

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' edgy, abducting MCs in the back of a trunk
Slappin you punks
'Til you taste more blood than Dracula's tongue
So place no bets, my effects is long range
You're short changed, trying to come with it, like payphone sex
I'm feeling Waco, Tex, half loco and half postal
From weeks after weeks of weak take-home checks
And my work ethic is uninspired, yeah I'm admired
As a talented tongue for hire
But I'm one big liar, under fire with a sick sense of humor
I don't eat pussy, I'm grew tired of the sick scent of tuna
I'm just waiting to invent a rumor that you're a pervert
Sweet as sherbet, and prove it for sure that words hurt
Hide your face in a paper bag, I humiliate MCs
To the degree they'd have to take the stage in drag
It's not too late to add, I'll diss you in your favorite mag
Erase your chart position as the latest ad
I'm out altering documents
To say that all fraudulent occupants
Of this industry are reported as communist spies
I'm spitting ominous lies like a compulsive
That hover over your dead career, hungry vultures

[Chorus]

[Samples]

[Outro]
Aw, yo, this is Louis Logical, you know what I'm saying?
I've been tellin niggas, you know what I'm saying?
Head's is hungry like cats that sleep in boxes and shit
Motherfuckers need to pay the toll
Before they cross the bridge, you know what I'm saying?
You'll get mistreated like foster kids, word is bond
Yo, and we out, and we out, and we out, and we out
