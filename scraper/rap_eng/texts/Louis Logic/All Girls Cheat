[Intro]
What's the difference between you and your lady
Aside from the fact that you don't and she do want a baby
You got another thing coming if you sit around and think husbands and wives are different when it comes to their drives
Cause every good man needs an ego boost
About as much as women need those shoes y'all
That's why a guy never believes
That she might ever have cheated
But it's still something we both do, cause..

[Verse 1]
Confucius say that when a dude's away his beauty plays
That's something that's still true today
But there's no telling with whom she lays
Cause while a bros helping himself to some
She's busy in the room he stays
But somehow you behave as if it's normalcy
Who needs waves when you relationships on stormy seas
Weather you're headed for the beach or the rocks
It's an easier lot then trying to get the cheating to stop
And men are totally clueless, believe it or not
We think our genders supposed to be ruthless
Cause we lead with our crotch
Boy, a woman can teach you a lot
If you had the strength to adopt
Her natural killer instinct when she shops (but you don't)
Most men think that they got the only faithful one
That doesn't just make you wrong, it also makes you dumb
I hate to dump on your wonderful chemistry
But you ain't the one and only lay she wants
Cause weather she's in love with celebrities
Gets no sex or stuck in the 70's
Re-loving them discotheques
There is no test to insure, or measurement for
Trust and fidelity that says they'll endure
That's why...

[Chorus]
All girls cheat
(It's a lousy break)
Even the good ones
(Weather it's wedding vows or dates)
You can bet she's as crafty as you
(She can have the man of the house replaced)
But a mans got ladies like hes gotta try to sell you his rules
(I mean he's doing it too)
He'll tell you "Do as I said baby, not as I do"
He just doesn't think its right for you

[Verse 2]
To cheat or not to cheat? That is the question
You can preach monogamy and practice deception
But when a pall says your gal friends
Can match your defects then
You get mad with your best friend at the suggestion
Which is extra foul, you'd wanna do it for him
He ain't trying to stress you out, he's cluing you in
You suppress your doubts so long as you can pretend
She never messed around and you knew where she's been
Some dudes will invent fiction from this
When there's chicks among us
Who get around more that distance runners
That's the hubris of men that lets them twist the numbers
Of a girl so new, in the end he thinks he's Chris Columbus
Well, it's no wonder sisters diss the brothers
We don't want ladies
We're just babies who miss their mothers
And piss the covers when we think our chicks had others
You call yourself a grown man?
But won't stand and risk the justice
Get with the program
Cause chicks have lives outside their own man
But bros can't admit that, right?
You probably think this whole jams a big fat lie
But I should know man, I've been that guy from both sides

[Chorus]
All girls cheat
(It's a lousy break)
Even the good ones
(Weather it's wedding vows or dates)
You can bet she's as crafty as you
(She can have the man of the house replaced)
But a mans got ladies like hes gotta try to sell you his rules
(I mean he's doing it too)
He'll tell you "Do as I said baby, not as I do"
He just doesn't think its right for you

[Outro]
(Audio of Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise from Eyes Wide Shut)

Alice Harford: Millions of years of evolution, right? Right?
Men have to stick it in every place they can, but for women... women it is just about security and commitment and whatever the fuck else!

Dr. Bill Harford: It was a little oversimplified, but yes, something like that

Alice Harford: If you men only knew...
