I have a confession to make
I love my bitches

[Verse 1]
Strange thats what hunt for every time i leave my front door
Some poor slut that i fucked once but never once more
Strange if your a chick i'd yet to see undress for me and press a peach in my sex machine just for once and let me be
Strange if its my first chance to get inside a bird's pants
Strange thats what you call when you're a chick i haven't fucked before
Strange i need a change in women when the stick the box one a each chick on a drunk mc's dick like a shish-kabob
You miss a lot with the ball and the chain
Calling your name in the miffted[?] twats all feel the same
You like a wife more than a dame for self pleasing
But since varieties the spice of life I'm well seasoned
I can't help needing at least twelve evenings
Out of two weeks to creep with every jezebel breathing
For health reasons I should stop sleeping around like narcoleptics
But I'm always looking for my next piece like art collectors
I'm part shady and participative
Giving every chick and sharp lady better dick than a smart detective
Its a sad fact not untrue but hard accepted
I slip off after one use like a contraceptive

[Chorus]
Strange thats what hunt for every time i leave my front door
Strange if your a chick i'd yet to see undress for me
Strange if its my first chance to get inside a bird's pants
Strange thats what you call when you're a chick i haven't fucked before

[Verse 2]
I need new fresh chocha
Just about as much as hebrews stress kosher
I get closer ever time i get some
To make this a sad world
With no strings left but underaged chicks and fat girls
What a tragedy that would be
If every time i had a piece it was just my last pussy
Shit, it don't have to be untouched just new to me
Not so much beautiful as beautifully groomed and cleaned
I know it's kind of sexist of me truthfully
But i get a chubby even over chicks with a pregnant tummy
You can picture porn stars getting lectures from me
On having sex with honeys that you'll never seen again for money
Cause when the precious undies slip to the floor
I got a loss like teddy bundy for a stick in the slots
So when I slip 'em the sword the get sad as hell
Cause once i hit it before I'm picturing more
A fresh mademoiselles
That should tell you of a mans nature
But lets just say he wants to know more hoes than landscapers
Don't gash yourself that super sucker can't save ya
From captain backslap and drunken underpants raider

Well thats a sweet thought but i had it once so i don't need more
I had to try not permanently add it to my diet
Well to be honest i didn't asked for it and I don't want it
Bitch keep it cause i already know you're keeping secrets

[Chorus]
Strange thats what hunt for every time i leave my front door
Strange if your a chick i'd yet to see undress for me
Strange if its my first chance to get inside a bird's pants
Strange thats what you call when you're a chick i haven't fucked before
