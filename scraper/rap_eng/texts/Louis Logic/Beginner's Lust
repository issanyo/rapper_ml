This is one for the freshman...

[Verse 1]
Sexy bitch..
So I know you're not accustomed to having sex with an open guy
But don't be shy just cause mom's said you should close them thighs
You see, most men lie about their intentions
Like they don't spend time just looking out for an entrance
But I'm different Ms. cause I prefer to be honest
And I'm down to be friends if we can work in some bondage
With her as a hostage, and the bird I'm packing
I give a new meaning to the word hijacking
I'll be your Captain if you'll be my Tennille
Lay a napkin in your lap and then eat like a meal
If it's true she like sushi I'll feed her my eel
Or give her back hand deliverance if she wanna squeal
They say a great teacher appeals with fun lessons
Well mine may lead you to feel like undressing
And in one session, I'm guaranteed to reveal
That under every young huns dress a freak is concealed

[Chorus]
[Conway Twitty]
And I can feel your body tremble
As you wonder what this moment holds in store (Ladyyyyy)
And as I put my arms around you
I can tell you've never been this far before
[Louis Logic]
Girl don't look at me like I'm just a big sinner
I'm giving lessons on lust for beginners

[Verse 2]
So even though this is our first night together
Something tells me you like it better in spikes and leather
Or who knows, you might get wetter if you're tightly tethered
To the head board with the sleeves of your nicest sweater
It's twice the pleasure to invite a guest for S&M
Get some friends together and try suggesting sex with them
But that depends on weather you like it or just catch offense
Cause you've met some femmes I'd die to end up pressed against
So let's extend this from the bed where I poked ya
I'll mount you on the counter next to the toaster
Or I could get you bent over a nice elegant sofa
While I'm driving Dick home like the Vice President's Chauffeur
I bet you've never been closer to the slut in you
Than me stuffed into your reproductive tube
So please just renew complete trust in Lou
And I'll teach stuff to you a porn queen would guts to do

[Chorus]
[Conway Twitty]
And I can feel your body tremble
As you wonder what this moment holds in store (Ladyyyyy)
And as I put my arms around you
I can tell you've never been this far before
[Louis Logic]
Come on Girl don't look at me like I'm just a big sinner
I'm giving lessons on lust for beginners

[Verse 3]
I could write one whole rhyme on why your bum's so fine
And how I'd love to give you loving where the sun don't shine
Your buns won't mind if you stuff em with beef frank
The jumbo kind that pumps up in your sweet shank
Not that you need length, don't downplay runts
You won't ever get yours if your pal ain't hung
I've shown many a wallflower how they cum
Giving them the Mao Tse-tung until my mouths made numb
Now play dumb for Lou, and stay comfortable
I'll slip a stiff one in the place you make number 2
Your other lovers and whatever they've done to you
May come to view as just another lay under used
Cause once you loose all of your childish fear
We'll excuse your Underoos and your stylish gear
Then I'm jumping you, Dukes Of Hazard style and steer
The Hershey Highway, gearing through your miles of rear

[Chorus]
[Conway Twitty]
And I can feel your body tremble
As you wonder what this moment holds in store (Ladyyyyy)
And as I put my arms around you
I can tell you've never been this far before
[Louis Logic]
Oh Lord don't look at me like I'm just a big sinner
I'm giving lessons on lust for beginners
