I'm not gonna cry
Again when they're asking me why
I was barely here the past 7 years
Now I hide from deafening cheers
I'm breaking my promise
So long

I fought the good fight
For your love night after night
And when I arrived
The love that I built changed you to Mr. Hyde
Then you twisted a knife in my future wife
And it killed my love for song
Where'd I go wrong?

So I'm leaving again
Again, againâ€¦

So long
