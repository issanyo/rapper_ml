[Intro]
She loves me, she loves me not
And I don't want to spend my life struggling in that ugly spot
Being that guy who gets hugged a lot
When she just forgot the whole idea of giving us a shot
Or is it my fault we're splitting again?
With all this high talk of living as friends
Like it isn't pretend
We're just against the true physics of man
I can't get with her again
If someone else has then this is the end

[Verse 1]
We must be stuck on stupid
Or drunk on the love song music
Waiting on an unarmed cupid
Like these fairy tales are love long tunes
Could get us one more usage
Out of something that was done for useless
But the truth is we both know it's over
And we been through this enough to get our own show on Oprah
We been from closer than two old folks on sofas
To the distance between big limousine moguls and chauffeurs
Now I'm supposed to try to date other chicks
And you won't say nothing if we're crushing or they touch my stick?
I don't believe it
Even though I know you mean it
That if you see me with another sweety you won't be heated
You probably think I'm so conceited
Assuming you freak if no one's cheated
But I guess that's only human to me
Who wouldn't be a little jealous when it's natural?
I couldn't stop you from chilling with the fellas
But I hope I never catch you

[Hook]
Even after what we been through
You're always on my mind
And I don't care
Cause love is hard to find
Even after what we been through
You're always on my mind
Cause I don't care
We're giving it one more try

[Verse 2]
This is our fifth second chance at our nesting plans
I guess we can't get a glance at the day of our wedding dance
It's like a soap opera with less romance and ugly bloom
Or honeymooning in Paris, Texas instead of France
But let a man connect with friends for boy time
Like that helps you remember when you knew how to enjoy mine
I couldn't be more wrong if I wrote three more songs about it
Now I can't believe you're gone
But you'll come back to me
Cause love is refractory
Resistant though insignificant others our mad at me
And others would have to be
As dumb as an amputee
To choose being chewed like the gum under the classroom seats
Why do we lie to one another so actively?
Your mother and dad could see we struggle unhappily
And that could be why I need a fast retreat
Running this rapidly as if your big brother was after me

[Hook]
Even after what we been through
You're always on my mind
And I don't care
Cause love is hard to find
Even after what we been through
You're always on my mind
Cause I don't care
We're giving it one more try

[Verse 3]
Why is it every time we're on the outs
You want me to sleep on the couch
And now you telling me to leave my own house?
Give me a break Miss, what are you shitting me?
You wanted a kid with me?
I don't think that I'll be needing a spouse
You can take my keys and I'll bounce
Cancel both our Visa accounts
Divide the savings into equal amounts
And you can stop all of your sneaking around
Like I don't see you in town with my replacement cause you keep looking down
All this deceit puts a frown on your face
Cause you just keep finding my curls laying around since I moved out of our place
So how do you face it?
When you're surrounded by traces
And reminders of the times we talked about an engagement
My advice to you is take our pictures down from the frame
And change your number if you like this dude
Because if one thing in life is true
It's that love is such a high
It's no wonder why the price is too
I gotta rant, girl

[Hook]
Even after what we been through
You're always on my mind
And I don't care
Cause love is hard to find
Even after what we been through
You're always on my mind
Cause I don't care
We're giving it one more try

[Outro]
I thought I had romance, no chance til I met you
You're the best thing that's happened, the light of my life
Now that's romance for ya
