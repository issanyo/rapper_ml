I'm on the boot when I step up in this bitch
Purple lean in my cup
That's that muddy on my lips
Said she wanna leave with Peezy
Only if she want the dick
Looked up at me
Is it room for my chick (you know I got it)
I put ya hoe on the road
I don't think she coming home
She do things she wasn't doing
Send her back home in a Uber
I just might fuck on her friend
I just might give her a Xan
I just might take her to Follies
And give her a molly and spend me a grand
Ooouuuuuu
(You know I'm not)
That pussy shoot
I hit that spot
(I make her oouuu)
She just might cum on my face
We might just might fuck in the place
I hit it and hit it
I hit it and quit it
Her nigga got problems

She ready to go to the room
I think she in love with the crew

Fiyah fiyah fiyah fiyah
She opened her thighs
She rolled back her eyes
I think she in love with that dick on the side
Go down on that dick
That's my whodie

That fire stick on me I'm holdin

She bought me a fit
