[Hook]
I swear that I ain’t ever felt this way before
But I love it when you drop down to the floor
You killing it from head to toe
Shawty do it like a pro
You a stallion, you a stallion
You a stallion, you a stallion
Shawty do it like a pro, you a stallion
You a stallion, you a stallion

[Verse 1]
Shawty you a stallion, damn you bad
I swear you make me want to throw that cash
And if it’s worth it I’mma throw my last
Shawty you could ride it like a cab
Show me what you got, I’m too cool
And [?] brand new, but that ass looking brand new
I just want to paint a perfect picture, like a coworker you can bet I’m working with you
I can turn a nun into a stripper, and that’s whats up

[Hook]
I swear that I ain’t ever felt this way before
But I love it when you drop down to the floor
You killing it from head to toe
Shawty do it like a pro
You a stallion, you a stallion
You a stallion, you a stallion
Shawty do it like a pro, you a stallion
You a stallion, you a stallion

[Verse 2]
I swear lil shawty look just like a model
I swear shawty got brain like a scholar
She swallow like no tomorrow, I’mma throw her some dollars
But don’t know if I’mma call her, I’mma break her off proper
Shawty you’s a stallion, well let em be your Hercules
Drop it to the floor, and put it in reverse for me
Shawty looking petite, I swear that you a freak
Go head and put it in repeat, let a nigga see

[Hook]
I swear that I ain’t ever felt this way before
But I love it when you drop down to the floor
You killing it from head to toe
Shawty do it like a pro
You a stallion, you a stallion
You a stallion, you a stallion
Shawty do it like a pro, you a stallion
You a stallion, you a stallion
