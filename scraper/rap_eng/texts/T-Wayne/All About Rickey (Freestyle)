[Verse 1]
When it comes to these niggas I don’t really fuck with em
When it comes to these hoes I don’t really trust bitches
Old ass rappers, washed up, no dishes
I ain’t interested if you ain’t talking no business
You dig me, bitch my music bangs like Quickies
The rap game need me like Bobby needed Whitney
Nigga you’s a mark, nigga you’s a hickey
Black and white diamonds same color as TV shows in the 50s
I’mma go hard till I’m 50, these niggas tryna get me
Old bathroom ass rappers mad cause they flo' shitty
I ain’t tryna run the city, nigga I ain’t Diddy
I’m Rickey, I’mma make the world fuck with me
And your girl fuck with me, she know the name
Broken Xbox nigga, you ain’t got the game
I’m the rap LeBron James, I got my own lane
I was swerving in the whip cause she was giving brain
I just hope they get the picture, I ain’t rocking with you
You ain’t got no flow like a dried out river
I’m a fly ass nigga, I’m in that H-Town
The way you saving hoes, you should keep a cape round
Super hero ass nigga, I don’t want your girl
But she all on my zipper
I ain’t talking bout the dolphin when I say she a flipper
My wallet thick like the bible, you think I had scriptures
I’m from the ave where the boys walk around with them pumps
I ain’t talking bout the toilet when I say they’ll dump
My wallet’s bigger than a whole family of the [?]
I need proactive for my music cause I swear it bumps
I’m from the city of the land of the trill where it’s hard to find a deal
And every girl’s stripping cause they’re tryna pay their bills and
Mamas steady crying cause their kids getting killed
When they go to the club, get hit with the steel
