And that’s no iPhone included, I love the way you do it
Girl I love the way we cooling, plus you dripping like a smoothie
You can hit me on my line, just call
Ain’t talking bout the retina when I say I ball
You know you with it and I’m with it baby
Ain’t tripping on these niggas cause I know they hate me
And they girls want to date me

Gassed up like propane, bitch I got that flame
