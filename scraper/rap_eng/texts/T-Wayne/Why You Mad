[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track
You turn it up
You turn the beat up a lil bit
Beat Monster

[Chorus]
Oh that's your girlfriend?
Why you mad?
I used to pull up on that hoe but that was bad
I heard you used to have the juice but that was past tense
And nowadays you ain't nothin' but a has been
And why you mad lil bih, why you mad
Why you mad lil bih, why you mad
Probably 'cause your man's outchea doin' bad
That why you mad lil bih, that why you mad

[Verse 1]
She want it poppin' tho, I got a chipotle
I pull up at the drop then hit her on her break
She heard my name around, she know I'm state to state
2 bad hoes kissin' face to face
I still hit her, she ain't even have a butt
And I don't want your bih, I swear that hoe a slut
I'm ridin' down a city on a boulevard
I was pullin' up before I had a car
I was juggin' out the front and out the back
Servin' dog food, a bunch of scooby snacks
I like the quaterback, you know I got the sack
If it's a drop then how we still pourin' that

[Chorus]
Oh that's your girlfriend?
Why you mad?
I used to pull up on that hoe but that was bad
I heard you used to have the juice but that was past tense
And nowadays you ain't nothin' but a has been
And why you mad lil bih, why you mad
Why you mad lil bih, why you mad
Probably 'cause your man's outchea doin' bad
That why you mad lil bih, that why you mad

[Verse 2]
Why you mad lil bih, why you mad
I ain't seen you, I was drivin' way too fast
I'll still slide on you later for that ass
'Cause right now I'm only focused on that cash
She hit my line but I was focused on a cheque
I ain't reply, but she know I rep the text
Shoutout my location but she still know where I'm at
I'm at the trap, i make that bih do jumping jacks
I called a hundred plays like front to front to front
I would say back to back but that's just what you want
I'm in the foreign thinkin' the roof was in the trunk
Fuck around and kick 'em out like Donald Trump

[Chorus]
Oh that's your girlfriend?
Why you mad?
I used to pull up on that hoe but that was bad
I heard you used to have the juice but that was past tense
And nowadays you ain't nothin' but a has been
And why you mad lil bih, why you mad
Why you mad lil bih, why you mad
Probably 'cause your man's outchea doin' bad
That why you mad lil bih, that why you mad
