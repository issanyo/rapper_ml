[Hook]
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way

[Verse 1]
Had to get out the mud
Used to have dreams about wearing designer outfits in the club
Cause I ain’t never had none’
I was calculating my funds, wasn’t worrying bout competition
Wasn’t giving them no run, my completion no one
Everybody got opinions, but everybody ain’t been winning
They say if you want it bad enough you should just go get it
And I been with the same team I been with since the beginning
And ain’t no ho in my blood, ain’t no ho in they blood
We been going so strong that all you do is give up
And we done fell down so many times all we do is get up
And I ain’t making it rain on nobody, they should tip us

[Hook]
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way

[Verse 2]
They told me stop what I was doing cause the kids was listening
But it’s crazy cause the kids been living the way I’m living
My partner had a story but ain’t nobody want to listen
So he killed himself, now everybody paying attention
They say that they don’t show no love until you dead
Till my partner put that thing to his head
And now they want to show him love
Now my partner gone, but they should’ve showed him love when he was home
When he was all alone, it ain’t no ho in my blood
I ain’t searching for love, it ain’t no hoes off in that club
I don’t need nobody, they gone play me for a scrub
Sipping on a little alcohol cause I need me a little buzz
I ain’t even gone stunt, it ain’t no hoes off in my section
I ain’t need no bitch that gone be acting like she pregnant
I don’t want to wake up to the lil bitch, I might regret it
That bitch got to pay me, I’ma need a little bit of lettuce
I’ma tell how I tell it

[Hook]
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain’t no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
