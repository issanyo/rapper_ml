[Verse]
Okay i pull up in that foreign got me feelin' like I'm James Brown
I be gettin' brain Jimmy Newtron
I'm all about my green no croutons
If I did it once, then I can do it two times
I'm in the lab and I'm going out the head, uh
I killed this shit man I left the beat dead
I don't give a fuck 'bout what those hatters said cause
Ricky Wayne about his bread, I go fed
I be [?] I'm runnin through the city
I don't want that bitch if she ain't showing titties
Man tell them haters they can never get me
I need a bathroom man they flow is shitty
I wreckin I'm a kill it every time for my mind
I can never stop even with a stop sign
I be on my grind man my flow is out of line
Ricky Wayne, Dr. J, I'm the best of all time

Need some Photoshop, man this shit is gettin' graphic
I'm just tryna map it, shit is getting tragic
I don't want that girl if she ain't better nuff for a pageant
Rickey Wayne Gonzales I can say that shit in Spanish
Every time I come around I make the room panic
