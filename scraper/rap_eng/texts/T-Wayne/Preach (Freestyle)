[Intro]
Yeah
It's Rickey
I don't neck Hollywood, but I've been to Hollywood though


[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
If you ain't getting to the money don't approach me
Man they bout to make me go back to the old me
I've been it to this ever since 03
Young in the game but they treat me like an 0G
I might just pull up with your shit, but you gon’ tell somebody
She gotta have a nice have and have some body
I'm sippin Hennessy I don't even sip Bacardi
Go tell the promoter add 10 for the after-party
And I ain't even being cocky I'm just being real
I’m running up the sack, my money’s on a treadmill
I had to keep it moving, I can’t ever stay still
All these other rappers going in circles, no ferris wheel
I been focused on my grind, tryna get it together
And lately they been tryna stop me, but it’s whatever
Doin’ what I got to do so I can get the cheddar
I like my bread with some chips and some mozzarella
These rappers fake like Ms. Cleo
My wallet big like the head on that nigga Ne-Yo
I'm the type to pull up in the club with a tuxedo
I like my girls with more curves than a bag of Fritos
Listen to me
I’ma have to preach like Dolph said
I'm swimmin in your chick like a dolphin
I'm ballin' on these hoes like I'm golfin
I only speak money so my wallet do the talkin
If you came from where I’m from then you know I’m from the bottom
I don’t feel sorry ‘bout your problems cause we all got ‘em
Now everybody tryna figure out how I got poppin’
But only god knows, and they can’t figure how to stop him
That’s Rickey


[Outro:]
Yeah
Abilene how it do
H Town what's the deal
Karen-ton what up
D Town what's up
You know I'm sayin
DP I see you fool
AC I see you fool
You know, it is
[?]
Yo Ali, what it do
ACT what's the guild, baby
Yeah
