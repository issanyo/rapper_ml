[Hook]
Girl I know you really want to ride with me
You know that I ain’t tripping, got to be low key
It ain’t nobody’s business, it’s between you and me
They ain’t got to know girl, just be low key
Low key, low key
It ain’t nobody’s business, it’s between you and me
Low key, low key
They ain’t got to know girl, just be low key

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
Low key, you know me
If you really bout it you gone have to show me
They was hating but you know they so weak
Said you got a man but he don’t come before me
Baby what you got, I know what you looking for
Love and affection plus more
Just hit me on my line and I’ll be right at your door
Ain’t no competition, baby you know you a perfect score
You know what I been searching for
And I been feeling the way that you down for me
I was on the road, you stayed around for me
Don’t worry if they ever judging you because you perfect to me
It ain’t nobody’s business so we got to be low key
You dig?

[Verse 2: Lil JP]
Girl I know you really want to ride with JP
From that field where we don’t play no G A M Es
I know you got a nigga but you know I’m tryna keep
I heard you was a freak, yeah you know I’m tryna beat
You ride for a nigga, die for a nigga
His and hers, get fly with a nigga
You know I’m a player with the trial little nigga
You don’t need smoke, get high with a nigga
When it’s time to run would you run with a nigga?
When it come to drama would you kill for a nigga?
Hold that work, hold the pills for a nigga?
Get pulled over, catch a case for a nigga?
Looking for a rider, would you ride with me?
Hop up in the coupe, take a ride with me
If she got her own, she ain’t got to ride with me
Hit all of them tricks when she ride that dick

Girl I know you really want to ride with me

Low key, low key
It ain’t nobody’s business, it’s between you and me
Low key, low key
They ain’t got to know girl, just be low key
