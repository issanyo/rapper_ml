[Intro]
Yeah, ummmm
Ain't got time, ain't got time
Ain't got no more

[Hook: Billard]
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody all in their feelin's, I'm trying to get paid
Ain't got no time to waste
I'm just tryna move mom away out the way
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody claimin' 100 but these niggas fake
Ain't got no time to waste
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody all in their feelin's, I'm trying to get paid
Ain't got no time to waste
I'm just tryna move mom away out the way
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody claimin' 100 but these niggas fake
Ain't got no time to waste

[Bridge]
Go and pour me up, pour me up, yeah-yeah
Another double cup just ain't enough
Cause in my eyes, just the way I see it
This music shit got all you niggas trippin'
Mama's hands up like "God forgive him"

[Verse 1]
Check me out, now I'm state-to-state
Born blessed, say I'm great today
I can't be stopped and niggas can't compete
Think about it, you really need the king
Don't disrespect the man with the key
I don't need nobody else but me
I gotta do what's really best for me
I gotta do what's really best for me

[Bridge]
Go and pour me up, pour me up, yeah-yeah
Another double cup just ain't enough
Cause in my eyes, just the way I see it
This music shit got all you niggas trippin'
Mama's hands up like "God forgive him"

[Hook: Billard]
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody all in their feelin's, I'm trying to get paid
Ain't got no time to waste
I'm just tryna move mom away out the way
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody claimin' 100 but these niggas fake
Ain't got no time to waste
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody all in their feelin's, I'm trying to get paid
Ain't got no time to waste
I'm just tryna move mom away out the way
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody claimin' 100 but these niggas fake
Ain't got no time to waste

[Verse 2: T-Wayne]
I pull up in a foreign, you say I've been workin' for it
These other rappers borin', I be ballin' like I'm scorin'
Straight up out the streets, how I'm tryna get a piece
They tried to kick me out cause I was violatin' my lease
But I will work it up my grind
Can't really worry about too much shine
I ain't worried about your bitch
I swear I ain't got no time
Had the bottom of the dime, I'mma get it
I swear that all I need is change and I'mma flip it
Say they ain't playin' around so I can't stay around
AIn't none of my team been switchin' up
You know they stayin' down
You know my partnas and my partna's partnas, yes
I'mma break the game off, had to do it proper
Had to do it proper

[Hook: Billard]
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody all in their feelin's, I'm trying to get paid
Ain't got no time to waste
I'm just tryna move mom away out the way
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody claimin' 100 but these niggas fake
Ain't got no time to waste
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody all in their feelin's, I'm trying to get paid
Ain't got no time to waste
I'm just tryna move mom away out the way
Ain't got no time to waste
Everybody claimin' 100 but these niggas fake
Ain't got no time to waste
