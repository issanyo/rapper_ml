[Hook: T-Wayne]
My ex hit me on my line
But I don’t give a damn about her
My old friends didn’t see the grind
So I’ma just do it without ‘em
We runnin’ commas
Commas, commas, commas, commas
We runnin’ commas
Commas, commas, commas, commas
We runnin’ commas
Commas, commas, commas, commas
We runnin’ commas
Commas, commas, commas, commas

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
We got them commas, I put that on mama
I ain’t been sleeping, I don’t need pajamas
Cause I been working, tryna see a dollar
I’m dressed in all black, Batman on Robin
I’m with my people and you know we cool
She want me now but didn’t want me in school
That’s just what happens when you on the move
I only hit her when I’m in the mood
My people ain’t trip, my mama ain’t trip
My brother ain’t trip, my sister ain’t trip
Young [?] ain’t trip, Young [?] ain’t trip
We really ain’t tripping, cause you know that we gettin’ it

Commas, commas, commas, commas
We runnin’ commas
Commas, commas, commas, commas

Commas, commas, commas, commas

[Verse 2: T-Wayne]
From the bottom to the top I’ma get it if you with it
Man I’m tryna open up my new business
They telling lies to the blogs, they got everybody listening
Man I swear she lying, I got too many bitches
My mama hit me on my phone, family members crying
But don’t you worry ‘bout it cause I’m fine
Man it ain’t right how they tried to ruin my life
But I ain’t trippin’ though ‘cause god got me right
Ok I’m doing better than ever
On tour, rack schools lookin’ brand new
Got types of cheddar
I been known to move
I been on the road in all types of weather
I been living my dream for the rest of my life so I’m gon’ get cash forever
They can say what they want to say
Too many dudes out her acting real
When they know they never been out in the field
Yeah, you can say what you want to say
I sold a million copies off a mixtape
Who is Rickey Wayne? 2!
