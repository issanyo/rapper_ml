[Verse 1]
Pull up in a foreign whip, I be with a foreign bitch
Need some extra tissues, swear that I been on some more shit
Need an extra toilet, I’m shitting on these rappers
I’m sonning these niggas therefore you are not a bastard
You know where I’m from, where them folks go dumb
Even in the night time my chains shine bright as the sun
You know I’m real as they come, I ain’t got to force it
Couple of years ago I was in the Camry, swerving like it was a foreign
You could holler at my bitch but won’t get chosen
Cause her standards are higher than a pilot that was smoking
I’m Long John Silver, I’m the king when it come to stroking
She so wet I fuck around and thought I found her in the ocean
[?] under my roof, sipping on my deuce
I’m like a walking movie, I’m the black Tom Cruise
I’m the black Justin Bieber, I got jungle fever
Don’t let your girl come to my show cause you gone have to leave her
They praying for my downfall and they scared
But I will never fall like a nigga with ten legs
Hopped off of that Masi, swerve like Ricky Bobby
The way I’m kicking flavor you would think I was in karate
Kicking shit with vanilla trill
I got more answers than Dr Phil
If she got that ass I’mma cop a feel
I’m T-Wayne, I got a heart of steel
My team ride like a car on wheels
And you flipping sides, you a cartwheel
Ass nigga, fuck how you feel
Diving in that pussy like a motherfucking [?] seal
I don’t take you serious, homie you ain’t real
I’m just tryna get a mil and a fucking meal
If you want to battle me then you got to have some skill
Who is Rickey Wayne?
