That’s the same thing
Look, Cool!

[Hook]
Got Giuseppe and Margiela, that’s the same thing
One foreign, one yellow, that’s the same thing
With the beat or acapella, that’s the same thing
In the house or with the teller, that’s the same thing
That’s the same thing, yeah that’s the same thing
That’s the same thing, yeah that’s the same thing
Got Giuseppe and Margiela, that’s the same thing
I’m with a foreign and a yellow, that’s the same thing

[Verse 1]
Lebron James, Michael Jordan, that’s the same thing
Making movies and recording, that’s the same thing
White girl and a foreign, that’s the same thing
I’m in my city or I’m touring, that’s the same thing
All black Lamborghini like I’m Bruce Wayne
I said the Lamborghini but I want that Mulsanne
Bitch I’m blowing up, they think I’m Hussain
I’m riding ‘round and getting it like I’m 2 Chainz
Lennox Mall or Galleria, that’s the same thing
The Ferrari or the Kia, that’s the same thing
One bullshit, one rachet, that’s the same thing
Got two bad bitches with the same name

[Verse 2]
Free all of my niggas in the chain gang
Went gold and went platinum on the same day
Want a verse, I want a Rolex, that’s the same pay
I walked through in two shows on the same day
Margiela fellow, bitch look just like Cinderella
I could kill the beat or I could do it acapella
She could be a foreign, she could even be a yellow
Had a champagne shower, need an umbrella
V Live, King of Diamonds, that’s the same thing
VVS, black and yellow, that’s the same chain
Blue strips, big faces, that’s the same thing
Man my car is too big for the same lane
