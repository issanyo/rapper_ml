Don’t ever let em play you
They will never get the best of me
Especially when success is in my recipe
Don’t ever let em play you
And they always gone hate
You’ll see me at the top big homie, just wait
You know that I would never let em play me
Never let em play me
Never let em play me, ever ever play me
Never let em play me, never ever play me
Never let em play me, never ever let em play me

[Verse 1]
I know a couple of people that mistook me for a fool
Tried to get me to do some things that I normally wouldn’t do
You know I’m dedicated, stop acting like you ain’t knew
And my team been here since day one, I ain’t never had to choose
I just feel like I can’t lose, and that’s right baby
Me and my team headed up to the top, put that on my life baby
[?] what you saying, you think that I’m paying, you tried to play me
Like I ain’t know, you must think that I’m crazy
I’m from the bottom, put in so much work, but they can’t see it
They ain’t worried bout my family, they worried bout competing
I’m tryna live out my dreams and you steady sleeping
You steady sleeping out your dreams, you’ll never see it

[Verse 2]
Let me talk to em, cause they don’t know what I done did
All they know is I been partying, but look, I been on my shit, hey
Me and my team done came up from nothing
My nigga movie done came up from nothing
My nigga Chedda done came up from nothing
And all I said, my nigga Fred, he done came up from nothing
So when you see us playing with that check, we worked for it
And if you come to me with that disrespect
Then you might just get hurt for it
I’m playing, but I’m saying, they can’t tell me nothing
They wouldn’t know when I was hustling
Homie I was way out in the cold, 15 degrees, giving out CDs
And it touched my soul, running to these kids want to be like me
