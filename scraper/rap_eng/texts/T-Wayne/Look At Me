[Hook][x2]
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Ain’t no flex, piece to chess, see the check
Look at me, look at me, look at me

[Verse 1 – T-Wayne]
I was on P Street, they was looking
I was in the Chi-town, they booking
I was on 45, I was in the D
I was at your girl’s house, I ain’t get no sleep
Looking, looking, they looking, they looking
Got Fred in the lab, cooking
I was in the A-Town, I was in the H
Shut your whole website down, drop a mixtape
They don’t know who? They don’t know what?
I ain’t chasing your girlfriend, I was getting them bucks
I’ll flex in a tux, I’ll flex on the moon
What you I ain’t dropped yet, man it’s still coming soon

[Hook][x2]
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Ain’t no flex, piece to chess, see the check
Look at me, look at me, look at me

[Verse 2 – Chedda Da Connect]
I just got a play, they looking
I just love Cali, they booking
Say she want to play with me, and she want to stay with me
I kicked her out the back, I don’t leave the ho to lay with me
Put me in the game coach, put me in the game
Hundred yard running on the field, put me in the game
I just shut the mall down, went shopping with my crew
I just want that full action, bought a thousand pairs of shoes
And I’m headed to Hawaii nigga, finna look at blue water nigga
Get high with cannabis, I’m flexing, I’m sorry nigga
Ooh, I just flew back in a Rari
If I took your bitch, I’m sorry

[Hook][x2]
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Ain’t no flex, piece to chess, see the check
Look at me, look at me, look at me

[Verse 3 – DJ Chose]
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Look at the way that we grown
Look at the way that we shining
Now look at the way that we on
Look at the flick of the wrist
Befriended money, mike a whole brick
Nigga but my hands are clean
Nigga brought me back 15
I’m in Danco with the M’s
All in LA at the supper
All of them [?] and them flexing
All in NY at the Rutgers
Just got off tour with Bun B
Nigga we doing them things
Hoes come in the room then they get kicked out
Word to my nigga Young [?]
I’m all out in Brussels with the killers
Small time niggas die, you ain’t got to feel us
Niggas riding around with the burner on the four wheelers
Ain’t no nigga gone tell me they for realer
And that’s DJ Chose, nigga that’s DJ Chose
Don’t come around, come to my left [?]
Nigga we done fucked them hoes

[Hook][x2]
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Ain’t no flex, piece to chess, see the check
Look at me, look at me, look at me
