[Verse 1]
Blowing up like they thought I would, young nigga doing good
Back in high school I ran a 4 3
Swear that I been at it ever since 14
I was 15 when I started sipping lean
Got my first pack shipped when I turned 16
They ain’t never believe, they was hating on me
Now I swear everybody want to be on my team
I ain’t never sold drugs but I swear that I will
If that’s the only way that I can pay my bills
All I need is a foreign and a house on the hills
I ain’t tryna get a deal, I’m just tryna see a mill
Whatchu mean I ain’t been working, homie you ain’t worth it
I ain’t gotta explain, I’m getting money for certain
And if I’m on the track, swear to god that I’mma murk it
I need a bad bitch but she got to be perfect
Yeah I rap without a purpose I been on mine
Hustled up a few dollars just to hit the lunch line
Swear I would [?] nothing if I go back in time
I was in the hallways, I ain’t never had a dime
But I was just rapping, they thought that I was trapping
Tried to copy my flow but you know that they was lacking
Your girl calls me baby but ain’t never had contractions
I was all in a magnum, I was making it happen
And that was 09
Homie I been at it before your time
Every since 15, I was in the hall passing out CDs
With my nigga Ali, we was STCs
I ain’t never sleep but I always had a dream
Make my pockets have green like lean and cuisine
Killing every word, killing every verb
Nigga been connected to the streets, nigga I’m the curb
And I ain’t got to brag, been at it a long time
Been headed to the top, there’s just been a long line
But you know I’m on the way
