[Intro: Chad Tepper]
K. Taylor on that beat

[Verse 1: Chad Tepper]
Diamonds flooded, got my name all in my chain
You still bust it, now I'm flyin' private planes
Tell your man he better stay up out my lane
I'm with the squad, Team 10, yeah, that's a gang
All of my diamonds be lit
Lookin' the flick of the wrist
I got you runnin' my fist
She fell in love with my drip
I'm with your girl and she lit
Life 50, sellin' a pin
Yeah, I'mma walk with my leg
I spent a drip on a whip

[Chorus: Chad Tepper]
Let's get lit, let's get lit, it's the weekend
Take it in, burn it quick, it's the weekend
Tryna sleep in
Let's get lit, let's get lit, it's the weekend (It's the weekend)
Let's get lit, let's get lit, it's the weekend
Take it in, burn it quick, it's the weekend
Tryna sleep in
Let's get lit, let's get lit, it's the weekend (It's the weekend)

[Verse 2: T-Wayne]
Now got too much diamonds
My Benny hunnids
Rollin' up the dungeon
I swear I'm doin' numbers
All this water on my wrist drippin', I need a plumber
I'm 'bout to kill the summer (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I put the ice on my wrist
I put some ice on my bitch
Me and Chad droppin' hits
We're just young and we rich
Diamond forever
I want the designer all better
I put some Gucci in my sweater
I got my better
I'm ridin' in four leather
This shot, I'm winnin' the letter (ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus: Chad Tepper]
Let's get lit, let's get lit, it's the weekend
Take it in, burn it quick, it's the weekend
Tryna sleep in
Let's get lit, let's get lit, it's the weekend (It's the weekend)
Let's get lit, let's get lit, it's the weekend
Take it in, burn it quick, it's the weekend
Tryna sleep in
Let's get lit, let's get lit, it's the weekend (It's the weekend)
