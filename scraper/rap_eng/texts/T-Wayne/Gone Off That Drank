[Hook]
Ok I’m gone off of that drank, gone off of that lean
Ridin round on threes, riding round my team
Ok I’m gone off of that drank, gone off of that lean
Ridin round on threes, riding round my team
Ok I’m gone off of that drank, gone off of that drank
Gone off of that drank, yeah gone off of that drank
Gone off of that drank, gone off of that lean
Riding round on threes, riding round with my team

[Verse 1]
Ok I’m gone off of that drink, riding round with my team
With a bad bitch you never seen, I’m swagging out green
Money tall [?] I mean, money taller than Shaq
I don’t think y’all want to go to war cause we strapped like Iraq
Drugs fill my [?], I’m killer like [?]
We winning in the [?], better move her out urgently
I’m flexing on em like Hercules, I been doing big ever since school
Mama told me to keep going and doing what I meant to
I’m going off of my mental
I’m feeling fly like a high five
They can’t see me, even if they was looking at me
They cock-eyed
I’m coming down like H-Town
Triple D, Atlanta
I’m fly, like Santa
I’m making moves, I need the camera

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I been doing what I’m ‘posed to, these other rappers is old news
You don’t believe me, like TV I got to show you
I’m going off of that pro-tools, you can tell I’m a pro fool
These other rappers like a dried up orange, you know they got no juice
You can tell that I’m stylin, got your girlfriend smilin
I could get it wet, like the outside of an island
I ain’t really been trying, I been out here grinding
Lately I been swerving on em and I ain’t got no license
[?] B what it do? I swear that’s my dude
When I’m off in my city, I’m chunking up that deuce
I’m letting off that rule, got these haters hurting
I’m on the beach and I’m surfing
I’m getting money for certain
Baby girl, I’m the man [?] a long stop J
Why don’t you come play around my way
Don’t believe what your people gone say
Baby girl, I’m the man, I be rocking these shows
From Texas to Japan, got people shaking my hand

[Hook]

[Outro]
If I sip this four
Sometimes I'm sipping, right on the right right
I hope you're responsible
That dress you in, right now is right right
Yeah, sometimes I'm right right
If I pour this four, yeah
