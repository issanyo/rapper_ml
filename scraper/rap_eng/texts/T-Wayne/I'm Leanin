[Hook: T-Wayne]
Drink all day, drink all night
I want this forever, I want this for life
Give me two cups with a lot of ice
I want this forever, I want this for life
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning, I’m leaning

[Verse 1: Young Pooh]
Grab my cellphone, hit [?] up
He said he’d pour some pints up in the double cup
That’s that muddy trouble, got me feeling lazy
The real definition of a ball baby
I drunk up my old drink, damn I need more pints
Fuck what the world think, they can’t tell me nothing
I’m sipping on slow-mo, grinding, get more dough
I’m bout to do more shows, I’m on that paper chasing man
Now we got the whole world tryna lean
I’m drinking on promethazine
I got to put it down for my own team
H-Town, turn up!

[Hook: T-Wayne]
Drink all day, drink all night
I want this forever, I want this for life
Give me two cups with a lot of ice
I want this forever, I want this for life
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning, I’m leaning

[Verse 2: T-Wayne]
Drink all day, drink all night
Even though I’m clean I’m sipping dirty sprite
I want this forever, I want this for life
Naw that ain’t my girl but she could get the pipe
I’m leaning with HP, look at my AP
Diamonds look tasty, they can’t tell me nothing
All these hoes tryna play me, no girl you can’t have my baby
I got too much sauce, let me [?] at your gravy
2 double cups got me screwed up
And I don’t know what to do
Got a couple sprites in a cooler
Turn up!

[Hook: T-Wayne]
Drink all day, drink all night
I want this forever, I want this for life
Give me two cups with a lot of ice
I want this forever, I want this for life
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning
I’m leaning, I’m leaning, I’m leaning
