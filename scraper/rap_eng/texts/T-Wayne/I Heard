[Intro: T-Wayne]
You know
It's just certain days that we don't do
You know what i'm sayin'

And word around town is "Cool"
You know it
Im'ma just tell you what i heard
What you hear ?

[Hook: T-Wayne]
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
That you ain't getting money, that you, what i heard
I heard that you've been acting funny, that's you, what i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard
That you ain't been [?], that's you what i heard
I heard that lately you've been flexin', that's you, what i heard

[Verse: T-Wayne]
Word around town, you a stunk
Word around town you [?]
Hit her with that sac, mega-fall
I'm just a young ass nigga undercover
Lately you've been flexin' like a champ
Hold up, you ain't got no [?], you a pimp
I heard that you fell in love with her daddy
Bookin' info on IG you ain't nobody
Word around town you ain't [?] doing big
Got four baby mamas got twenty-seven kids
[?] you ain't nearly on you chick
[?]

[Hook: T-Wayne]
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard

That you ain't getting money, that you, what i heard
I heard that you've been acting funny, that's you, what i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard, i heard
I heard
That you ain't been [?], that's you what i heard
I heard that lately you've been flexin', that's you, what i heard

[Outro : T-Wayne]
Word around town you've been flexin'

Put a wig and sac call her as a [?]
