[Intro: Trippie Redd]

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
It's okay, my gang okay
Making money baby, yeah it's okay
I count my racks, it is okay
Told my mama, baby yeah we gon' be okay
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Hold up, it's okay, okay
I'm getting money with my fucking gang, it's okay, okay
Countin' racks with T-fuckin'-Wayne, it's okay, okay
It's oh, okay, okay
It's oh, okay, okay
Dreams of that brand new foreign, ayy
I want a new Ferrari and I want a Porsche
Dreams of that yellow badge with that black horse
Y'all don't know the half, I'm ballin' and I still ball full court
Pulling up in a Phantom, pulling up in a spaceship
Pulling up to the mansion, yeah the crib look like Atlantis
Chasing the check, I know cardio
Your girl be welling like a water bro
Ever since a nigga started doing money know I'm never ever goin' broke
Yeah yeah, it's still the same gang
I ain't never changed, 14 hundred been the gang, yeah
Ayy, with this fame it bring pain
Still getting money, diamonds dancing in the rain, woah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
It's okay, my gang okay
Making money baby, yeah it's okay
I count my racks, it is okay
Told my mama, baby yeah we gon' be okay
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2: T-Wayne]
Young nigga came straight up out the slums
Young jugg god, I got what you want
I finessed your bitch 'cause I got what you want
In a foreign whip, the chopper's in the front
Jugg in Atlanta, be flexin'
I got your bitch, she naked
I got your bitch and we sexin'
I ain't gon' get the bitch pregnant
But you gon' hate the way I left her
I got all foreign bitches, I put on for a minute
Ran it up like I'm Emmitt, I just dropped a bag in Lennox
So fuck it I'm gettin' it

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
It's okay, my gang okay
Making money baby, yeah it's okay
I count my racks, it is okay
Told my mama, baby yeah we gon' be okay
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
