[Hook]
I done spent some bands on a bad one
I done ran a sack up in Niemanns
I done won some, I done lost some
If you talking millions I done seen it
I done spent some bands on a bad one
I done ran a sack up in Niemanns
I done won some, I done lost some
If you talking millions I done seen it

[Verse 1]
I done had some Ferragamo on my shoe
I done had a bad one with [?]
I done took my whole team to the top
So I’ma fuck around and change hip-hop
Have you ever hustled for a couple bucks?
Have you ever balled on em in the clutch?
Have you ever wanted to quit but didn’t give up?
Have you ever hopped out a Porsche truck?

[Hook]
I done spent some bands on a bad one
I done ran a sack up in Niemanns
I done won some, I done lost some
If you talking millions I done seen it
I done spent some bands on a bad one
I done ran a sack up in Niemanns
I done won some, I done lost some
If you talking millions I done seen it

[Verse 2]
I done been broke but that was long ago
I done lost some homies due to packs of gold
I done heard my mama crying on the phone
I done lost a homie, they ain’t coming home
Have you ever stressed cause you ain’t have a dime
Had to put food in your mouth, doing petty crimes
Dancing at the club and they judge you
But you ain’t really give a fuck, it’s what you have to do

[Hook]
I done spent some bands on a bad one
I done ran a sack up in Niemanns
I done won some, I done lost some
If you talking millions I done seen it
I done spent some bands on a bad one
I done ran a sack up in Niemanns
I done won some, I done lost some
If you talking millions I done seen it
