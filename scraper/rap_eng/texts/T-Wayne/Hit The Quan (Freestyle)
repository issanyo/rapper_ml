[Intro: T-Wayne]
Yeah
Don't forget Who is Rickey Wayne Part 2, aye
Y'all moving, how you doing folks
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm the type of dude to get reckless, uh
Abillin Texas still rapping, uh
Always had to stay with the protection
Cause my pocket so damn big, it looks pregnant
You can tell I'm the king when i walk through
I said my pocket so big, they had to get induced
If you want to battle me, then there is no use
I'm like a sippy cup, I've got the juice
No cuisine, but I'm going of the lean
Like some Newly [?], yeah my name got a ring
I'm in love with my money, man we've got a fling
Even though i don't sleep, I'm living out my dreams
I'm just saying, who do it like Rickey Wayne, nobody
I don't want your girl, cause she ain't got nobody
If you hating on me, please get out the way
Like the magic school bus, you could catch me out of space
I'm ma fool with it
Got everybody looking at me wrong
I'm calling shots like bullets on a cellphone
Been around the world and not a thing change
Got em still saying who is Rickey Wayne
Got em like
Who they want, Rickey Wayne
Rickey Wayne (x4)
She don't want it if it ain't Rickey Wayne (x2)
Let me talk to her
Rickey Wayne (x4)
She don't want it if it ain't Rickey Wayne (x2)
