[Hook]
Pockets full of them bands cause I be killing it
Playing around with them bags cause I be killing it
I don’t think they understand cause I be killing it
I take your girl cause I be killing it
Pockets full of them bands cause I be killing it
Playing around with them bags cause I be killing it
I don’t think they understand cause I be killing it
I take your girl cause I be killing it

[Verse 1]
Word around I’m the man cause I be killing it
Boys don’t understand, they too illiterate
Trying to do it like me but I’m too different
Used to be on my ass but now I’m getting it
How the hell you gon' stunt when I don’t fall
All up in your city at the mall
Blowing up my phone, I don't answer calls
I got these hoes pissed, go to the stall
They know that I kill it, I’m the coldest
All these other rappers bogus, I don’t even got to show it
When I pull up to the club, cameltoe truck tow me
Hit your girlfriend with that okeydokey

[Hook]
Pockets full of them bands cause I be killing it
Playing around with them bags cause I be killing it
I don’t think they understand cause I be killing it
I take your girl cause I be killing it
Pockets full of them bands cause I be killing it
Playing around with them bags cause I be killing it
I don’t think they understand cause I be killing it
I take your girl cause I be killing it

[Verse 2]
I been going in ever since I started
Need a straitjacket, my flow too retarded
I be going dumb even though I’m the smartest
Picasso couldn’t paint a better picture, I’m an artist
I be with them bands, like I’m at school
Like a broken radio, these fuckers out of tune
Even in the sauna I be feeling cool
Got your baby mama tryna join the crew
I be flexing and finessing, I’m a stunner
Pull up in that Porsche Panamera like it was a Honda
I be coming through the city on For’s like an iguana
I be killing everything, you can put that on my mama
And I’m cooling, back then I was fooling
And I remember back when I was cooling
I’m with the team making movies
And we moving

[Hook]
Pockets full of them bands cause I be killing it
Playing around with them bags cause I be killing it
I don’t think they understand cause I be killing it
I take your girl cause I be killing it
Pockets full of them bands cause I be killing it
Playing around with them bags cause I be killing it
I don’t think they understand cause I be killing it
I take your girl cause I be killing it
