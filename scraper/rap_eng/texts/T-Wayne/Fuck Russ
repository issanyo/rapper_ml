[Intro]
Cam Taylor on that beat
Yeah, foreign, foreign, foreign

[Verse 1]
I told 'em, fuck Russ
You ainâ€™t shit
You a bitch
Diamond wrist, peep the drip
Water whip, Plain Jane, new Mulsanne
Shorty wanna give me brain, cuz the fame (yea, yea)
I'm coming live and direct
I got you niggas upset
Hoping out the private jet, got your bitch wet
Snake on my belt, lookin like a new pet
Cut my ex off, need a new thang
Copped a new chain and a pinky ring
Southwest airline, that's a plain jane
I just dropped a bag and the Blue Flame

[Chorus]
I want the new Ferrari
I want the Plain Jane
I want the presidential Rollie
She want the whole gang (gang, gang)
She a little freak she'll bust it
Diamonds real cold like Russia
Told lil bitch don't touch it
Young, rich, came up from nothing
I want the new Ferrari
I want the Plain Jane
I want the presidential Rollie
She want the whole gang (gang, gang)
She a little freak she'll bust it
Diamonds real cold like Russia
Told lil bitch don't touch it
Young, rich, came up from nothing

[Verse 2]
I'm hoppin off of a jet
I'm on a run for a check
I gotta flex
I put your bitch in a vette
Runnin up plays like I'm Brett
I got her wet
I got my gun like a sketch
Keep that bitch I ain't impressed
Don't give a damn bout my ex
Fuck on her friend and I jet
I want Patek Phillipe
I got my choppa on me
I fuck around in the suite
I be feelin like skreets, bitch I be geeked
Light up the sweet in a suite
I be ridin' a foreign
You know the engine be roarin'
I'm outta space like the orbit
The whip gotta horsey
You would think it was Ralph Lauren
I'm on the track like Jeff Gordon, yea

[Chorus]
I want the new Ferrari
I want the Plain Jane
I want the presidential Rollie
She want the whole gang (gang, gang)
She a little freak she'll bust it
Diamonds real cold like Russia
Told lil bitch don't touch it
Young, rich, came up from nothing
I want the new Ferrari
I want the Plain Jane
I want the presidential Rollie
She want the whole gang (gang, gang)
She a little freak she'll bust it
Diamonds real cold like Russia
Told lil bitch don't touch it
Young, rich, came up from nothing
