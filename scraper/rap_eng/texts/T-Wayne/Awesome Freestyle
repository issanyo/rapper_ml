[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
Cool
I got a bitch in the back
And a bitch in the front
Sittin' on the best period like the time of the month
They be shoppin' at [?]
And they be dancin' with bodies
No train tracks, but they ride the dick like a train
I just hit the galleria with them boys
I done ran up the sack catch the store
And bitch I'm well connected like a cord
You can bet I'm clean like chores
I won't but then she I go [?] my jealous
Diamonds clearer then the slippers of Cinderella
I headed to the bank I'm''bout to meet with the teller
I got this shit on lock, i got the key to the cellar
I'm dressed in all black i got em thinkin' i'm Reshish
The niggas broken, i feel like they really in need of maintenance
My money tops and i don't really want to do much explaining
If i hear that she gon' need at it to her I'm going out the same game
I'm have a same game foreign all night long
We smoke off in a wait room
Cause you know they got that scrum
Yeah, you know, you know
Flippin' and sippin' on lean
Mr Codeine
[?]dancin' Micheal Jackson, where is Billy Jeans
Baby my pocket is on creatine
[?] let me rub [?]
[?] like out the ria
Chipotle me a Mexican, Mamacita
She call me pappy every time i see her
They be rippin' it right out the gate
They poppin' like 50 in case
Let me grab my surfboard
Cause your bitch wetter than a title wave
Even though I'm on fire
Baby I'm just cooling
Even at high school i [?] foreign exchange student
Everything's foreign
You other rappers boring
Baby she been ever snoring
But low key I've been touring
