[Hook]
I been leaning too much, I been sipping too much
I just been doing too much, you ain’t been doing enough
I been partying like every day, I ain’t been sleeping too much
I just been leaning too much, I just been drinking too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much (I been leaning too much)
Too much (I been sipping too much)
Too much (I been drinking too much)
Too much (I been flipping too much)

[Verse 1]
I been leaning too much
Sipping, codeine-ing too much
She said that she was in love
But she didn’t mean it too much
Pull up Giuseppe Zanotti or Maison Margiela, I seen it too much
Designer fetish, got ‘em tryna copy but I swear that they thinking too much
Took a trip overseas, now I’m speaking Japanese
Got two foreign twins, and I swear they’re Siamese
And they flexing, drunk sexin’, it ain’t nothing in between
Smooth like Michael Jackson
Bad bitch, Billy Jean
New cover, me and Fredonem
Goin’ in, we two brothers
I done took your girlfriend
I’m sorry that you need a new lover
This ain’t nothing new to me
I’m the real MVP
I be flexing on a hater
Old school Mr. T


[Hook]
I been leaning too much, I been sipping too much
I just been doing too much, you ain’t been doing enough
I been partying like every day, I ain’t been sleeping too much
I just been leaning too much, I just been drinking too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much (I been leaning too much)
Too much (I been sipping too much)
Too much (I been drinking too much)
Too much (I been flipping too much)

[Verse 2]
I been on a plane, I been flying too much
Niggas is lying too much
My niggas is dying too much
Hop out the ‘Rari, oops I’m sorry
If I was just stunting too much
I’m getting money too much
And you ain’t been working too much
Ferragamo on me, look like I’m handcuffing jeans
Said she was feeling me, but I swear they could [?] me
I been going hard since the 50s
Been down with the same committee
You can’t find me in a different city
I don’t want her, I just want a quickie
Pull up and I’m stunting
Got a pocket full of money
Baby girl I’m cool
Even when it’s sunny
I be going so dummy
I guess that I’m doing too much
I ain’t never heard your name
I guess you ain’t doing enough

[Hook]
I been leaning too much, I been sipping too much
I just been doing too much, you ain’t been doing enough
I been partying like every day, I ain’t been sleeping too much
I just been leaning too much, I just been drinking too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much (I been leaning too much)
Too much (I been sipping too much)
Too much (I been drinking too much)
Too much (I been flipping too much)
