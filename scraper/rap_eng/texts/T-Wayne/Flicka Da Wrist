[Intro: Chedda Da Connect]
Look at the flicka da wrist

[Hook: Chedda Da Connect]
Catchin' plays, catchin' plays
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist

[Verse 1: Chedda Da Connect]
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Some niggas in my sleep tried to capture me
Some bitches in my section tryna fuck for free
Catch a play on these niggas, touchdown
I'm my own quarterback, put my team on
Luxury, that's all I see
Look at the flicka da wrist, got 'em on me
I don't see niggas, I don't see niggas
California loud, got me lit, nigga
I'm the shit, nigga, take your bitch, nigga
You better duck, fool, or you'll get hit, nigga

[Hook: Chedda Da Connect]
Catchin' plays, catchin' plays
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist

[Verse 2: T-Wayne]
I woke up feelin' like I was on a plane
I woke up with a bad bitch outer space
I hopped up out the bed, money on my mind
Louis V, Ferragamo at the same time
Have you ever had two bitches in your car?
Runnin' plays on these niggas like a point guard
I was only 15 when I called a play
I was up at Lenox Mall, I was in the A
Tell the waiter bring the bread this away
I was with your bitch eatin' crab cakes
Catchin' plays, Super Bowl game
LeBron James, that's NBA

[Hook: Chedda Da Connect]
Catchin' plays, catchin' plays
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
