[Hook: Drizzy Adams]
Don’t say that you love me
When you don’t girl
I was down for you
I would ride for you
Don’t say that you love me
Fucking with a nigga on the side
You know you wasn’t down for the ride
Know you wasn’t down for the guys, so
Don’t play with me
Don’t play with me, no
Don’t play with me
Don’t play with me, no
Do you love me or nah?
Do you miss me or nah?
Do you feel me or nah?
Don’t play with me

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
Every time my phone ring I get anxious
Baby got me thinking
I just hope she ain’t playing
All the time that we was laying
I been thinking bout you
Can you be my boo
You made my dreams come true
Baby girl I’m in love with you
We can get the [?] house rocking
We can get it popping
Even at [?] seven in the morning
That you need it, we ain’t stopping
Do love me or nah?
Do you trust me or nah?
Would you fuck me or nah?
Girl I’m gon’ break you off

[Hook: Drizzy Adams]
Don’t say that you love me
When you don’t girl
I was down for you
I would ride for you
Don’t say that you love me
Fucking with a nigga on the side
You know you wasn’t down for the ride
Know you wasn’t down for the guys, so
Don’t play with me
Don’t play with me, no
Don’t play with me
Don’t play with me, no
Do you love me or nah?
Do you miss me or nah?
Do you feel me or nah?
Don’t play with me

[Verse 2: Drizzy Adams]
Don’t say that you love me
I know it ain’t real
I know that shit fake
Please get the fuck out my face
Girl I been working all day
I ain’t got time for that
No wasting time on you girl
You tell me you love me
Like I ain’t never had nobody love me
You told me you never
Put nobody else in life above me
Found out that that was a lie

[Hook: Drizzy Adams]
Don’t say that you love me
When you don’t girl
I was down for you
I would ride for you
Don’t say that you love me
Fucking with a nigga on the side
You know you wasn’t down for the ride
Know you wasn’t down for the guys, so
Don’t play with me
Don’t play with me, no
Don’t play with me
Don’t play with me, no
Do you love me or nah?
Do you miss me or nah?
Do you feel me or nah?
Don’t play with me
