[Intro]
Twinkle twinkle like a star
Twinkle twinkle like a star
Twinkle twinkle like a star
Bad little bad little bitch

[Chorus: Chedda Da Connect]
I just met a bitch named Lala
She said she wanna go bye bye
Bitch I’m eating steaks, no ribeye
Cut these niggas off like wifi
Yeah I’m in the sky getting hizz-y
Drop a couple bands, getting flizz-y
Put that bitch to sleep like a lullaby
Twinkle like a star, I’m a G5
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Girl you badder than bih
Girl you badder than bih
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star

[Verse 1: Chedda Da Connect]
Twinkle twinkle little star
She hit the whip in my car
Sipping drink, no bar
Bitch don’t know who we are
All I do is get money
All I do is stack it up
She bent her ass right over
Then she started to back it up
Ain’t nothing between us, riding with me
Supermodel in my city
I don’t fuck with every ho
Some of these bitches too shitty
Eat steaks, no ribeye
Cut the switch on a nigga like wifi
Go and tell your bitch bye bye
She put the dick in her ah-ah
And why you wanna hate on me
Cause I’m balling like Steph Curry
Pussy soft like ice cream
Call a bitch McFlurry
You can hate on me if you want
Tell them bitches jump on it
I originated this style
You know these niggas gone clone it

[Chorus: Chedda Da Connect]
I just met a bitch named Lala
She said she wanna go bye bye
Bitch I’m eating steaks, no ribeye
Cut these niggas off like wifi
Yeah I’m in the sky getting hizz-y
Drop a couple bands, getting flizz-y
Put that bitch to sleep like a lullaby
Twinkle like a star, I’m a G5
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Girl you badder than bih
Girl you badder than bih
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star

[Verse 2: T-Wayne]
I just pull up at the bar, hopped out the foreign car
I should be in outer space, cause I be with all the stars
Rickey Wayne campaign, catch me on the yacht like skipper
Tell your girlfriend I don’t want her, cause she ain’t wetter than a river
I know bitches is conceited, telling them niggas beat it
Lately I been geeking, they been calling me Steven
Pull up in the Lamb like [?] people
My bitch she back in movies, call her Queen Latifah
She got hot head like she got a fever
Dash eat more wood than a fucking beaver
Pull up in a foreign car, they ain’t never gone stop it
Twinkle twinkle little star, I’m flyer than a hundred rockets
I just hopped off the plane, had to take a trip to Spain
If they ever ask you the name, tell em Rickey Wayne, Rickey Wayne

[Chorus: Chedda Da Connect]
I just met a bitch named Lala
She said she wanna go bye bye
Bitch I’m eating steaks, no ribeye
Cut these niggas off like wifi
Yeah I’m in the sky getting hizz-y
Drop a couple bands, getting flizz-y
Put that bitch to sleep like a lullaby
Twinkle like a star, I’m a G5
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Girl you badder than bih
Girl you badder than bih
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star

[Verse 3: Rizzoo Rizzoo]
Hey girl it’s nice to meet you, picture perfect, Mona Lisa
Heard she independent and a nigga you don’t need it
Stand your shit and you conceited, telling broke niggas beat it
Fuck a dime, you a quarter, you a motherfucking starter
You a baby mama, that what makes you go harder
Heard you used to fuck with Sean Carter
But I’m Rizzoo Rizzoo cutting up
Mister let me squeeze your fucking butt
Lala [?], let me fucking cut
I’m a motherfucking slayer
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
See you shining, that’s the bomb
Invite you over to my section
No more drinking at the bar
Drive me crazy like a motherfucking car

[Chorus: Chedda Da Connect]
I just met a bitch named Lala
She said she wanna go bye bye
Bitch I’m eating steaks, no ribeye
Cut these niggas off like wifi
Yeah I’m in the sky getting hizz-y
Drop a couple bands, getting flizz-y
Put that bitch to sleep like a lullaby
Twinkle like a star, I’m a G5
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
Girl you badder than bih
Girl you badder than bih
Twinkle twinkle little star
Twinkle twinkle little star
