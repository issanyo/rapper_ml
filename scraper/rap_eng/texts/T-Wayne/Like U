Girl you know you bad, girl you know you cool
Never met a girl like you, never met a girl like you

Girl you the best in the city
Girl you the best in the town
Haters can’t ever stunt on you

So wet you’ll make a nigga drown
You stay in vegas but you vacate in Atlanta
You a country girl straight from Alabama

Don’t you play ‘round with her, she’ll match [?]

Girl you know you fine, so I’ma make you mine
I got a brand new watch, it’s the perfect time

You gettin’ it on your own
All times you on a mission

Cause I know that she [?]
She strike my line soon as I get in town
