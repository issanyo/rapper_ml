[Verse 1]
I got goose in my cup now
Out in Hollywood gettin' bucks now
And you know I'm poin up now
NFL catchin' plays when I touchdown
I just pulled up with a foreign in Atlanta
Black and white phantom look just like a panda
Drippin' sauce on these niggas, no manners
Money stack like Tony Montana

[Verse 2]
Damn!
Jukin' and finessin' on the block again, wooh
Hot boxin' the whip I need some oxygen, wooh
She told me come on over, 'cause she got a friend, wooh
So I hopped off in the Benz and told her drop a pin
I just put a molly in my soda (soda)
I'm about to black out like my rover (rover)
Homie got some lean up in a cold cup (cold cup)
We just do the most, we give no fucks (no fucks)
Yo bitch said that she love me, well I love me too (love me too)
We pull up on the lot in a Bentley coupe
I'm sippin' on some lean with some orange juice
We just do the most we give no fucks, damn
(damn, damn, damn)

[Outro]
Straight up!
