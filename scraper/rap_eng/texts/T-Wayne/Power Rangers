Okay, the whip a mint color, Power Ranger
I'm wit' my people kickin' shit like Power Ranger
I'm wit' a foreign named Kim, Power Ranger
And all my diamonds multi-colored, Power Ranger
I be flexin' on 'em like the Power Ranger
Everybody know me like the Power Ranger
All my diamonds multi-colored, Power Ranger
Aye, aye, Power Ranger

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
I be flexin', I be ballin', no gym
I'm wit' a foreign and you know her name Kim
I be ballin', I be ballin', no rim
I keep it real, they pretend
I'm on the side and I'm lookin' like a rockstar
I be stuntin' on 'em like I'm in a cop car
Every time I drop a tape, you know I drop hard
And my flow smokin', like a new cigar
I'm just stuntin' on these haters, I'm in different colors
Got two bad bitches and they with each other
Now I'm so damn fly and you don't even hover
I'm out in public lookin' sharper than a box cutter
I tell 'em say what's on they mind cause I'mma say what's on mine
I woulda freestyle battled you but I ain't got the time
You woulda sold out but, homie, you ain't got the grind
Huh, they out of line

[Verse 2: Chedda Da Connect]
I be sippin' on that green, Power Ranger
And these niggas know they better bring the danger
I be sippin' on that purple, Power Ranger
Got me goin' to the sky, I done came up
And it feels so good to be an angel
I know you got your wings on me, never gave up
And I'm switchin' up the colors, Power Ranger
And I'm feeling Mighty Morphin, Power Ranger
You better go get the change, don't be late, nah
Cause I'm feeling bright, lucid, fuck the game up
I don't got a little time and my change up
Now I'm feeling very special, Power Ranger!
She say she wanna ride wit' me, Power Ranger
So I let her try the blue, Power Ranger
You know I'm stickin' wit' my team, Power Rangers
You know I'm livin' out my dream, Power Ranger, oh!
