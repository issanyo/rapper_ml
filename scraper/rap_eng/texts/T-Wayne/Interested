[Hook: T-Wayne]
I’m not interested, stop calling my phone
I’m not interested, please leave me alone
I’m not interested, boy you better gone
Cause I’m not interested in what you got going on
I’m not interested in saving your girl
I’m not interested, I’m in a new world
I’m not interested, stop calling my phone
I’m not interested, please leave me alone

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
I’m not interested, you ain’t talking business
I’m in Tahiti, get freaky, multiple women
Talking bout you balling, talking bout you get it
Homie you ain’t balling on the line of scrimmage
They talking Ferragamo, Louis V, and different prices
They gone ride with me even with a suspended license
They talking bout the flow, they said I got the tightest
They tried to steal it, they recite it, I don’t even write it
I got that right away, any time of day
And I’ma get it, I’ma make sure that she tied away
Hope that relate to the paper, I got all white neighbors
Ferragamo alligator, I’m not no conservator

[Hook: T-Wayne]
I’m not interested, stop calling my phone
I’m not interested, please leave me alone
I’m not interested, boy you better gone
Cause I’m not interested in what you got going on
I’m not interested in saving your girl
I’m not interested, I’m in a new world
I’m not interested, stop calling my phone
I’m not interested, please leave me alone

[Verse 2: Chedda Da Connect]
Please leave me alone, stop calling my phone
I’m not interested, I’m getting this dough
All of these bitches on me at the same time
All these niggas on my line at the same time
I’m not interested, you a [?] first
I’m not interested just because you want a verse
Shout out to my team, finna put em on
Shout to my mama, this my favorite song
Girl I love the way you walk, yeah I do
Girl I love the way you talk, yeah I do
Tell them niggas, you not interested
You get money, ain’t not time for stretching

[Hook: T-Wayne]
I’m not interested, stop calling my phone
I’m not interested, please leave me alone
I’m not interested, boy you better gone
Cause I’m not interested in what you got going on
I’m not interested in saving your girl
I’m not interested, I’m in a new world
I’m not interested, stop calling my phone
I’m not interested, please leave me alone
