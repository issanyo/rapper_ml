[Intro: T-Wayne]
I just started from the bottom
Thought I was never gon’ win
Had to get it on my own
I ain’t never had a friend
All these other rappers actors
Man I swear that they pretend
Man I’m in the game forever
It ain’t ever gon’ end

[Hook: T-Wayne]
I just flexed on a swoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just slid back the roof, and I’m still goin’ in
Money stacked to the roof, but I’m still goin’ in
I be ballin’, no hoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just flexed on a swoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just slid back the roof, and I’m still goin’ in
Money stacked to the roof, but I’m still goin’ in
I be ballin’, no hoop, and I’m still goin’ in

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
What you mean Rickey Wayne ain’t working?
I been goin’ in full service
Swimming in the money, sea surfing
Don’t worry bout me, I’m perfect
Every time I come around they lurking
So I’m stunting on these haters on purpose
I’m plugged in with no service
Give me that beat, I’ll murk it
They praying on my downfall, why they hating on me?
I ain’t even did a [?], but I’ma be all I can be
Flexed up, I’m killing
My family good, lord willing
Bitch I done made me hot but I’m chilling
Whip so big I could swerve on a building
It was yesterday, I was sliding on ‘em like an Escapade
When they hear my name they say I’m extra paid
I’m too fly, that’s an extra plane
I like my women classy, not extra plain
I pull up, I’m flexing on ‘em like a superhero
That T-Wayne, my flow cool, that’s ground zero

[Hook: T-Wayne]
I just flexed on a swoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just slid back the roof, and I’m still goin’ in
Money stacked to the roof, but I’m still goin’ in
I be ballin’, no hoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just flexed on a swoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just slid back the roof, and I’m still goin’ in
Money stacked to the roof, but I’m still goin’ in
I be ballin’, no hoop, and I’m still goin’ in

[Verse 2: Chedda Da Connect]
I just sold half a mill
Yeah I’m still goin’ in
I just signed this deal
But I’m still goin’ in
Trap booming every day
Yeah we still goin’ in
Better ask your bitch
Yeah we still get ‘em in
I just flexed on the swoop
I just balled, no hoop
20 karats on my chain
Give a fuck about you
Lose some [?] long
Had to get in my zone
I’ma roll up one
And tell them hoes go home
And tell them bitches stay in your league
Get the fuck out of mine
I don’t give a damn what you’re doing
Baby girl I’m fine
I’ma stay goin’ in
Forever ever get it
Feel the middle finger up
Fuck nigga I ain’t finished

[Hook: T-Wayne]
I just flexed on a swoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just slid back the roof, and I’m still goin’ in
Money stacked to the roof, but I’m still goin’ in
I be ballin’, no hoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just flexed on a swoop, and I’m still goin’ in
I just slid back the roof, and I’m still goin’ in
Money stacked to the roof, but I’m still goin’ in
I be ballin’, no hoop, and I’m still goin’ in
