[Hook – Chedda Da Connect]
I just had a dream my niggas on top
I just had a dream he tried to take me out
I just caught a play across the world nigga
I just felt two pretty girls nigga
Catching plays on these niggas, catching plays on these niggas
Catching plays on these niggas, catching plays on these niggas
Catching plays on these niggas, catching plays on these niggas
Catching plays on these niggas, catching plays on these niggas

[Verse 1 – Chedda Da Connect]
I just caught a [?] fire play fuck nigga
Back yourself in a corner nigga
This race over, I just won it nigga
Ain’t a competition, come and get it nigga
Catching plays on these niggas, catching plays on these bitches
Hoes lined up on me, I’m just shipping that [?]
I’m just blowing that midget, car be jimmy the cricket
Bitches just staring at a nigga, cause they know we winning
Ho in Miami tryna fuck with me, bitches in my house tried to stay with me
I just caught a play in LA nigga, shoutout to my company and my bank niggas

[Verse 2 – T-Wayne]
I just caught a play, just last week
After I hit her sent her home in a taxi
I was swerving on em, you was in the backseat
Bitch I’m flexing in some Ferragamo khakis
You ain’t got to do em like that
Why you had to do em like that?
I don’t even want that girl
She [?] true like that
I just came through, caught a play
Trapping through my phone bitch, some new feng shui
Took a trip to Miami, I guess I been MIA
They be looking at my wrist, bitches say that I’m the shit
Me and Chedda making hits
Just got back from China, got some Ferragamo chopsticks
Straight up!
