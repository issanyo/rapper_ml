[Hook: T-Wayne]
Band it, band it, band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
All of this guop, I'mma band it
Soon as it drop, I'mma band it
I want that guop like a bandit
Band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
All of this guop, I'mma band it
Soon as it drop, I'mma band it
I want that guop like a bandit
Band it, band it

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
Soon as it drop, I'mma band it
All these lames can't stand it
Got a freestyle Grammy, got a foreign in Miami
[?] look like candy, bitch look like Brandy
I don't want ya girl, but I left her wet like Sandy
Pull up all white, got 'em thinkin' that I'm Mandy
They was takin' me for granted, now I'm flyin' no landing
Run it up, run it up, trap [?] in my pocket
I done took off to the moon, Ferragamo on a rocket

[Hook: T-Wayne]
Band it, band it, band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
All of this guop, I'mma band it
Soon as it drop, I'mma band it
I want that guop like a bandit
Band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
All of this guop, I'mma band it
Soon as it drop, I'mma band it
I want that guop like a bandit
Band it, band it

[Verse 2: Chedda Da Connect]
All this guop, I'mma band it
Call a Uber, I just landed
Hatin' hoes can't stand it, fuck niggas can't stand it
Yeah, we talkin' 'bout them hundreds
Yeah you know I'm gon' band it
Put it all in my closet, stack it up then I band it
Band it, band it, tell her, band it
[?], band it
Triple D, band it
HB, band it
T-Wayne, band it
Sergio, band it
Angelo, band it
My lil' young B, say she tryna band it
She ain't never seen how many racks in these panties
Just like [?], we takin' off
Yes we run the game, shut your mouth

[Hook: T-Wayne]
Band it, band it, band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
All of this guop, I'mma band it
Soon as it drop, I'mma band it
I want that guop like a bandit
Band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
Band it, band it, band it, band it
All of this guop, I'mma band it
Soon as it drop, I'mma band it
I want that guop like a bandit
