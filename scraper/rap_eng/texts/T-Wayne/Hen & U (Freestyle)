[Verse 1]
I got what you want, I got what you need
Me and you could catch a plane, to a place you never seen
You know I ride with you, I want to sip on you
Girl you could sip on me, you the baddest in your motherfucking crew
I don’t care how many men you been with, or your occupation
I ain’t worried bout what them other girls say
Cause I know that they just hating
Girl I need you in my life, [?] sky
Me and you could soar high, girl you my ride or die
Girl I need you in my life, like a fish and a shark need water
Fuck them other niggas, man I need to go harder
Girl I know what you done been through
And I don’t need an explanation
I hope you know I really dig you
And I love your conversation
And I love that you don’t ask me for nothing
You can get it on your own if you wanted to
Could be in a room full of babies
And the only one I ever want is you
And I don’t care who don’t like you
Cause I know that I like you
Whatever you want to do I’mma ride for you
And I know that you’ll ride for me too
We could do it to my mixtape
And every single song
As soon as it come on
We gon get it on
