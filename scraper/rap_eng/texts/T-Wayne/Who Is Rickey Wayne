Black Panamera, pull up like vroom
Take off to the moon, it’s a brand new pick up
I’ma pull up on ‘em just like stick up
I ain’t used to have nothing on me and I still ‘member
Mama steady working so I’m riding with my partner
I did so [?] man I should’ve won an Oscar
So much designer, man I should’ve had sponsors
Got paper like a bookbag, should’ve had a locker
Mama used to tell me that the game was too dangerous
But I started getting [?] when I started getting famous
All these other rappers like a broke hanger, they ain’t hanging
I done been in every city, every state, I name it
Just because you got money, it don’t make you real
I started getting money ‘fore the record deals
Blue face hundreds, I was flexing all summer
If I wanted, could’ve bought a house on the hills
I can play chess on my new Burberry
Had them haters take shots, no Stephen Curry
Hey, we got the bench out
You know we got the fans out
Rickey Wayne ‘bout to send ‘em home early
I look like [?] now
Put ‘em on payroll, I’m the boss now
All these other rappers tryna battle
I’m just tryna feed my family
Running through a check, what you talkin’ ‘bout
I’m a young P. Diddy, I be runnin’ through the city
All these haters tryna get me, money just as tall as Nipsey
I been running through the lean town with my whole committee
I don’t want her if she shitty, all my girls be picky
All my girls be pretty for the most part
I ain’t flexing in a foreign if it won’t start
Pull up to the function, I just push start
I don’t believe in wearing fake designer, better look hard
They been tryna catch me sleep but I ain’t been sleepin’
Gettin’ money like I’m pimping, got four or five bitches
I been running through these hoes like my nickname Emmitt
I just put it in the bank but it take a day to pend it
Man it turn around, my neck be hanging like [?]
Gucci swim trunks on so I’m going swimming
Duh duh duh duh, flexing like I’m Superman
But you can bet that I ain’t saving none of these women
Picking up paychecks, Fell in love with safe sex
I done rocked shows, I done made it off the internet
I done made it off a champagne shipment, champagne spillin’
I done got my whole shirt wet
It’s winter time, that’s a Louis V turtleneck
I’m kicking shit like my nickname David Beck
Them boys still claiming Rickey, I ain’t made it yet
I told ‘em hold on, I’m show ‘em in a sec
Who is Rickey Wayne
