[Intro]
Yeah, straight up, cool

[Verse]
I don't want your girl because I know she basic
My bitch bad like Buffy so you know she slayin'
Wanna join my team? You need a application
I swear we full of bench warmers cause we ain't playin'
Hopped out of the coup√©, I hit the alley hoop
All my girls be wetter than a bowl of soop
I feel sorry if you messin' with my crew
Ball is life, they'll shoot
They was hatin' on me just the other day
See me flexin', had to look the other way
Said I wouldn't make it, now look at they face
Serve boy, they had to catch the wave
They sayin', "Who is Ricky Wayne?", they thought that I [?]
My girl so bad she look like she was Instagram famous
Tell the promoter I ain't comin' through if they ain't payin'
They speakin' sign language, what you sayin'?
Back then they used to diss me
Now they wanna come hug and kiss me
Callin' my phone sayin' that they miss me
But I ain't tryna talk, I just want a quickie
I'm goin' in but I don't think they ready
My name ain't Wap but I'm 'bout my Fetty
Pull up, all black Chevy
Like [?] shit gettin' heavy
I never tell a lie to my own partner
I made myself a budget, I'm my own sponsor
They said that Ricky Wayne turned into a monster
My money green like Ninja Turtles, cowabunga
