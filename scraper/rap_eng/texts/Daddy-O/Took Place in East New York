[ Human Mix Machine Wise ]
My name is Wise Supreme and I don't eat pork
I reside in Chilltown but came from East New York
From a time of bein broke to a life of luxury
Stay in the house or you won't see much of me
But when I'm out I go to Brooklyn just to chill and max
And from my head to my toes I wear all black
No, I'm not a criminal, playin with my digital
Lay back in my chair while collectin my residuals
Cash that I made during winter, summer, fall, spring
But gettin dissed by a foe is just a small thing
Rememberin the time I was goin to a talent show
I saw my ex-partner who's now a foe, you know
Anyway, the brother said hi, cool
This took place in Jefferson High School
I was here to observe all the talented acts
He was there to try to battle, here's the facts
Was sittin in my seat, the host grabs a mic
"Stet's Human Mix Machine versus Essence tonight"
I said, "What? Who set this up?"
The crowd started goin crazy as they start to erupt
Between every act of people doin their show
Essence got on the mic and said, "Wise, let's go"
I didn't wanna battle, why waste my time?
He got on stage, kicked beats while his MC started rhymin
But the timin stunk like the beats he was kickin, see?
Then his MC started dissin me
I said nah, I just about had it
Time for me to wax his ass, goddamn it
Then stood up and walked down the aisle, and
You could feel the crowd's presence as they start buck-wildin
Then hit the stage and grabbed the mic
And said, "Who's in the house tonight?"
People started screamin "Pink House, Brownsville" with total excitement
"Tilden, East New York", he got hyped, man
I started with the 'Go Stetsa' roll, ended off
With 'Faye', said peace and broke north
He was still on stage, at the moment bein outraged
Due to the fact he lacked and got outstaged
The self-proclaimed King of Beats was hurt
He played me like a high piano and the boy got burnt
