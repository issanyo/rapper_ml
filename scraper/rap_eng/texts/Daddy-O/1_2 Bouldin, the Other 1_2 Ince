[ Daddy-O of Stetsasonic ]
Yo Bret, Sean, Muggs
Let's rock this one for the East

(Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na)

[ Bret E.B. ]
Grandmixer Muggs, Bret E. and Sean E.B
Your city needs your voice most definitely
To keep the party pumpin like the heart of a tiger
Grandmixer is the earth, Sean the air, Bret the fire
Combination of the elements, we're universal
Because we're gettin paid sayin we're commercial
But accept the fact that we're a household appliance
Muggs adds the scratch, we drop the science
Think that I'm lyin? Listen to it in your room
You'll notice that it's pumpin with a definite boom
And let me tell ya, I'm sure to convince
Because it's one half Bouldin y'all, and the other half Ince

[ Sean E.B. ]
Whip MC's, don't try to criticize
Step to me yo, and I will victimize
Showin no sympathy, you know what I will be
Behold my lyrics yo, and now you pray to me
In astonishment, you come and compliment
Back to the drawing board yo, cause you're irrelevant
Write a rhyme, you're tryin to catch me
Climbin the barriers of conquer MC
So you make it and return to find
I'm still a step ahead so hit the back of the line
If we meet again it will be our last bout
Strike one, strike two, third strike you're out
Your posse roll up, I won't even clinch
Cause I'm one half Bouldin and the other half Ince

[ Bret E.B. ]
Charles Earnest Bouldin, Sandra [middle name] Ince
Produced two rhyme creators who been rockin ever since
Birth and you know from the time we were born
To expect success the minds were strong
Raised on Linden, building one, 570
As you already know appartment 7A
For all you scroungy suckers whose minds are dense
My father's last name Bouldin, my mother's maiden name Ince

[ Bret E.B. ]
Last name Bouldin and my first name's Bret
Dont' walk on me boy, cause you pose no threat
To Bret E.B. speakin words of a prophet
Peace is my answer, violence we should stop it
Took a trip to Mexicali, threw on my sombrero
Kickin it in a '68 Camarro
Red and Convertible, cause that's my style
Got a girl in every seat, I'm feelin kinda wild
Always talkin knowledge with a touch of intellect
And every time you hear the voice the name you shall respect
So yo, and let me tell you just how I live
I gets you in the mood, make you all festive
Walk on me boy, nothin to it but to do it
Had to think about it? Yo, then pursue it
I am the engine and you are the kaboost
And if you were a snneak I'd be a mongoose
Cause I am the king, Sean is the prince
And it's one half Bouldin y'all, and the other half Ince
