[Hook: Method Man, The Notorious B.I.G.]
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it

[Trife]
I thought I told you
Never to trust, nobody but us
Now the gats must bust
Malicious black viper venomous
There's gonna be a lotta white chalk and brains on the sidewalk
I know you hear me
Nigga talk

[Larceny]
Nigga I'm weak-in, can't move my mouth to speak-in
They caught me creepin'
Deep in the hood peepin'
Larce was sneakin' they took me off my feet-in
But fucked up because my heart's still beatin'
I can't sleep, thinkin' how I'mma creep
Burners to squeeze but can't get up to help my enemies

[Trife]
Psychopath, when the days of wrath
Resolve the conflict, I'mma lick who did it
And who da fuck was wit it
Till they dead covered blood red
Pumpin' lead till them bastards ain't got no head
The raw deal, bad era switched to terror
You could pray all day but still gone die anyway

[Hook: Method Man, The Notorious B.I.G.]
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it

[Larceny]
When I come, I'm comin' right
Fuck tip toein' in the night
I tear'em up in broad daylight
Snakes too crudoo for you
Nigga catch deja vu
When I'm aimin' my gat at you

[Trife]
It's time ta make it happen
Fuck the yappin'
I'mma, step the fuck up and start clappin'
Double action
Two fo' fo', we robbers for satisfaction
Clickin' off reaction

[Larceny]
All those robberies we breezed
Backed down DTs
Feelin' the murder disease
Thou shall die when I catch you
And lick you in your eye
Nigga, nice try

[Trife]
Our whole life, and thinkin'
Centered in drugs
Twin mack loaded slugs and buckin' at them other thugs
Engraved, with the mark of the beast
The shots I released increased aimin' for dey head piece

[Hook: Method Man, The Notorious B.I.G.]
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it

[Larceny, Trife]
Murder's the death penalty
Don't need nobody
Helpin' me but the other half of snake and me
Us two combined, shots ta lick
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique
Now who goes the road against it

[Trife]
Niggas got drama
I'mma kill his {baby} first
And then his {momma}
Ain't no time for bitchin'
Callin' police and snitchin'
You live by the gun, you die by the gun
Don't do this killin' shit for real, why do the shit for fun?
Try ta murder my blood, can't let it slide
Family pride committin' grisly homicide
Blunted, lame niggas get hunted
Autopsy shows he felt the black rhinos
Fuckin' witta pro
I hit, I don't miss
Niggas spit clips disappear in the mist, check it
I showed you rugged put you fools in dirt
Tryin' ta put in work
But only gettin' ya fuckin' self hurt

[Hook: Method Man, The Notorious B.I.G.]
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
Stay seein' bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
