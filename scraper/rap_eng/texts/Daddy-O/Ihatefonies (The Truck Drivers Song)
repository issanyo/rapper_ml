[Daddy-O]
Messin around, diggin in my crates
Lookin for some roughneck beats and breaks
Stumbled pon some SHNCECK they show on The Box
And I got kinda hot cause I like it, NOT!!
Finger flick the remote, over to BET
And it looks like the same videos to me
Daddy Rich, Daddy Snow, Daddy Kane, Mac Daddy
Daddy Mac, Daddy Wack, Daddy I.U., DAMN!
I'm gettin tired of all this Daddy SHLECK
DAMN! Put the beat back on
Messin around, diggin in my crates
I own a big CD collect but I support the vinyl plate
Break some in half, I throw the weak in the trash
I'm always keepin it real, when I dip into my rhyme stash
COPY, somebody say COPY
Make like a Puerto Rican and I'ma punch you in your eye, PAPI
