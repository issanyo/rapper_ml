[Daddy-O & MC Delite alternating verses and rhyming together]
The ways of the world may vary and change
But the ways of the STET still remains the same
Like I remember when the band first made this mark
Prince Paul was playing music in the park
Evil Z was cuttin records for the Funky Boys Band
And me and [?] we were the best of friends
Five percenters play with leelo give the turban a try
And Wise was kickin beats [?] High

[Hook]
And the band played on
We got busy
And formed the world's first hip hop band in the land
We took time and planned it out
Here's the pay off
Beats that are Stetsa-sized
And a positive role to play
Can you believe your eyes?

So you ask what the jam is all about
The bassline's ready, the rap seems steady
The LP is fly and so far it's so good
I bet against the grain, but let me explain
To Whom It May Concern is a jam for our fans
In the US, UK, Austraila, Japan
Brooklyn, L.I., and every other area
People feel eager to catch the STET fever
It's something new for a change on the radio
Gen-A-Me-Me-Me braggadocio
Learn a little bit about our past
How long we been around and while we get down
Tell the parents to listen to the children
And tell the children (what?) you're still children
And make the world want to laugh and learn
To whom it may concern
Peace
