[Intro: Milk Dee]
Check it out!

[Verse 1: Milk Dee]
MC am I, people call me Milk
When I'm bustin up a party I feel no guilt
Gizmo's cuttin, up for thee
Suckers that's, down with nei-
-ther one of us, that's how I feel
To be down you must appeal
To the Two, we're rated R
We're gifted, and we're going far
Down the road, to the bank
While I'm here I'd like to thank
Mom and dad, they knew the time
Gizmo's scratching, Milk Dee's rhyming

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
Milk is chillin, Giz is chillin
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
Since you understood, would you

[Verse 2: Milk Dee]
Stop scheming, and looking hard
I got a great big bodyguard
So step up if you wanna get hurt
Milk Dee's gonna pull the skirt
I get money, money I got
Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot
That's how it is, you can ask Giz
I stole your girl while you were in prison
Jailed for MC assault
You was jealous it's all your fault

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
Milk is chillin, Giz is chillin
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
And since you understood, would you

[Verse 3: Milk Dee]
Clap your hands, your hands you clap
If your girl's out of place it's your girl I slap
And if you're dumb, you'll ask why
I am from Bed, Do-or-Die
The Audio Two, the Two's Audio
I got a brother and his name's Gizmo

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
Milk is chillin, Gizmo's chillin
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
And since you understood, would you

[Verse 4: Milk Dee]
Bite a rhyme, if you dare
I get the papers so I don't care
My contributions to this jam
Is confusing, because I am
Milk Dee stated all the way
The super easy midas MC okay
Yes I'm down, down by law
I get the girlies out on the floor
G is D, down is G
Two the at the top is where he'll be
The at is us, call us the aud
Girls come in you won't be bored

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
Milk is chillin', Gizmo's chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
And since you understood, would you

[Outro: Milk Dee]
Do a dance, dance the Two
If, you can dance it's easy to do
This dance is on and on and on
Dance until your breath is gone!
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
