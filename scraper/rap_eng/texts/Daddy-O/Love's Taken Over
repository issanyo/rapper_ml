[Verse 1]
Honey, I know
That you didn't know
That loving me could be like this
But you're not alone
My mind was blown
I could not resist

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I find myself
Taken over by the feeling
And I know within my heart
It's too late to say goodbye now
There's a place in me
That belongs to you, baby
So relax and be mine

[Chorus]
Now that love's taken over me
What will I do now?
Now that love's taken over you
Baby, I'll show you
How it feels to live in ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Now that love's taken over

[Verse 2]
Too bad for you
You can't free yourself from me
Don't bother to
You'll have to stay here forever

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you find yourself
Taken over by the feeling
And you know within your heart
It's too late to say goodbye, now
There's a place in you that belongs to me, baby
So relax and be mine

Honey, I can't feel sorry for you
You've got me loving you so much
I just can't let go
You should've known one day
That love was gonna catch up to you
And now you know

[Chorus]
Now that love's taken over me
What will I do now?
Now that love's taken over you
Baby, I'll show you
How it feels to live in ecstasy, in ecstasy, ecstasy
Now that love's taken over
Now that love's taken over

[Bridge]
Flying high in the friendly skies
Feels so good
Sometimes it makes me cry
This love's got to be here for always
I can't give you up
I won't give you up, no way

[Chorus]
Now that love's taken over you
What will you do now?
Now that love's taken over you
Baby, I'll show you
How it feels to live in ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Now that love's taken over
Baby, love's taken over
Now that love's taken over you
What will you do now?
Now that love's taken over you
Baby, I'll show you
How it feels to live in ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Now that love's taken over
Now that love's taken over
Now that love's taken over
