[Daddy-O]
I'm comin with the bomb, so watch me begin to explode
And unload - like the Grand Funk Railroad
Non-stop, like a Vette with a soft top
It's ninety-three and I'm comin for my props
And what better way than to bounce?
So you can get paid by the pound; and more for the funkin ounce
It's the Brooklyn sway
And as I let the music play I wouldn't have it any other way
And if it sounds like somethin you heard before
It's all the more reason to get on the dance floor
And rock with the play by play I announce
Of the Brooklyn Bounce

Chorus: {samples}

"This is the way.."	"Brooklyn Bounce!"
[vocoder] Brooklyn Bounce
[Daddy-O] C'mon!  This is the way, "Brooklyn Bounce!"
[vocoder] Brooklyn Bowwwouuunce
"This is the way.."	"Brooklyn Bounce!"
[vocoder] Brooklyn Bounce!
[Daddy-O] C'mon!  This is the way, "Brooklyn Bounce!"
[vocoder] Brooklyn Bowwwouuuouuunce

[Daddy-O]
I confess, to bein strung out on the funk
Steamin up my trunk like a tank full of skunk
Blowin down doors like a big bad wolf
And like a magician says POOF!
You see me dissapearin deep in the bush
Crushin all cave-men; without an Operation PUSH
But with the skills that the people call mad fat
As I stalk like a saber-tooth cat
With the sway, that makes you say
"Hey - Daddy-O's out of school today"
And yeah I'm comin out to play
With them hydrogen bombs and shit
Ignitin MC's like the World Trade got hit
And if it sounds like somethin you heard before
It's all the more reason to get on the dance floor
And rock with the play by play I announce
Of the Brooklyn Bounce

Chorus + minor variations

[Daddy-O]
And I remember fightin fair with your fists in a fight
But now I got a mac-one-one in the case with my mic
Cause it's best to be safe than sorry kid
Forget the funeral, I'll take the murder bid
And make beats from inside like Slick Rick
Might even do a duet, now that's some other shit
But I gotta keep bouncin, that's my style
So the Brooklyn crew can get buckwild
And start treadin the party and lookin for vic's
We see a lot of 'em - so who is gonna be my pick?
Tight red dress, or will I make it tight black
Have I seen you before - I say with no slack
And if it sounds like somethin she heard before
It's all the more reason to get on the dance floor
And rock with the play by play I announce
Of the Brooklyn Bounce
