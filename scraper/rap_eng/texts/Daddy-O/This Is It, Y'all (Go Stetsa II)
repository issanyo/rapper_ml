Playin record after record every night and day

[ Fruitkwan ]
Rhythm - blues - that's cool
Old school rap, Jack

You can make us or break us

[ Delite ]

So much soul, I think your woofers might blow
Back again to show ya, fly just like I told ya
Foes are crushed by the Stet rhyme roller

In Ohi-in Ohio I met a guy named Ben
He bragged to all the friends about the Stetsa trend
By dishin out matches we gave him at the hotel
Got caught by the cops because he sold em for wholesale
[ Delite ]
[Name] from Virginia gave this display
That 'Stetsasonic' to this day is still hard to say
But when we rapped and rolled, shook her out her shoes
She was certified down with the Stetsaloo
[ Daddy-O ]
Now out in Oakland, California there's a guy named Dan
Wears a big top hat and he drives a van
When we were in his town he treated us kind
So we got him backstage before showtime
[ Fruitkwan ]
We-we-we-we rotate fans like reduced stocks
Based on sucess we're produced to rock
[ Delite ]
So for-so for you our fans
[ Daddy-O ]

A who-a whole posse from Cleveland had this to say
Arguments for the Stet to go all the way
They took a poll for the final say
That the record 'Faye' was number one to play
[ Daddy-O ]
In-in L.A. they got gangs called the Bloods and Crips
One gang waitin for the next to flip
But in L.A. we do it right
Cause our fans are Bloods and Crips alike
[ Fruitkwan ]
In-in Washington there's the White House
Before a Stet concert it gets quiet as a mouse
5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1
Lights out, Stet's out, damn, listen to the scream and the shout
[ Delite ]
We roll like tanks all the way to the bank
From the streets of Brooklyn to the streets of Burbank
[ Daddy-O ]
So-so for you our fans
[ Fruitkwan ]
Go-go for what you know
[ Delite ]
Fee-feel the life of the flow

Ah nah, nah, nah

Always, man
Always
[ Daddy-O ]
It ain't even no stadium in Brooklyn
[ Delite ]
Yo, we can make stadiums
(Go Brooklyn)
Everywhere is Brooklyn
Everywhere
You can go to any college
You can go to any city
All you have to do is 'where you from?'
They'll tell you
Brooklyn!
[ Daddy-O ]
Yeah
But yo, D
It's only one thing about Brooklyn though
[ Delite ]
