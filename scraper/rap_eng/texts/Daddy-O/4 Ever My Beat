[Intro]
My beat forever
4 Ever My Beat, 4 Ever My Beat (echoes)
4-4-4-4-4 Ever My...

[Daddy-O]
4 Ever My Beat, this beat is mine forever
The tembo is slow and the rhymes are clever
Me trade this beat? No, I will never, huh
It gets funky at switch of a lever
Some beats are great, this beat is greater
And some are straight, this one is straighter
So get on the floor and forget ya stance
And cruise to the beat that makes you dance

[Delite]
4 Ever My Beat, orchestrated as a treble I rate
Havin' all that it takes, make no mistake
Now we're the band wit the clan that rock every fan
Hit the hoop, after school, fuck, hide the mail
So get down, come on and bust a move
Delite, Daddy-o and Fru' are out to rule
As you some the fun, who are second to none
So let's meet you, the beat of the drum
4 Ever My Beat-a

[Chorus]
4 Ever My
My-My-My-My-My-My beat forever
4-4-4-4 Ever My ("beat" scratched up)
My-My-My-My-My-My beat forever
4-4-4-4 Ever My
My-My-My-My-My-My beat forever

[Frukwan]
4 Ever My Beat, kinda fittin' this beat won't happen
Not even overnight cuz we be slappin' the beat
Like a freak, for the rest of the week
And if you front on stage, baby doll, we make sure it cease
That you boogie to the sounds of the drums
Stimulated by the sound of my voice, yea ya ready to cum
Dum-du-dum, and all that crap
Bring on any rhyme biter, got a T-Boy rap

[Daddy-O]
4 Ever My Beat, if allowed, I'd play it all year
And if the front was cold, I'd play my beat in the rear
And if the back had a crack, I use my beat like glue
And in the can light beef, I use my beat as stu
My beat is a gem, next to God and the Earth
And all the earthly treasures couldn't measure it's worth
My beats are Lamborghini, being turned as a car
And I eat it like a Ritz eat crackers, ya'll
My beat

[Chorus]
4 Ever My...
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat
My beat forever
4 Ever My....

[Delite]
4 Ever My Beat, for the record, the jam you selected
That when we projected, erect it, perfected
All the way live, yes we in full drive
No jive when I abide, we have a ride
Wit a Stet on the set, us you won't forget
We're leavin' our marks, but cashin' T-Boy checks
So reflect on the text, check out what's next
And groove to the sound, that you is next

[Frukwan]
4 Ever My Beat, this fashion, beat got glitter
The bottom of the ninth, it's the home-run hitter
Never standin' still, it's the up and go getter
Huh, you think I'm frontin' then try to get rid of this
Beat, we'll demolish in a single day
Strike faster than a magazine, ace/duece tray
My beat is a death defying feat
And every mom crack the shell, it's so hard to repeat
My beat-a

[Chorus]
4 Ever My...
My-My-My-My-My beat forever
4 Ever My...
My-My-My-My-My beat forever
My-My-My-My-My beat forever

[Daddy-O]
4 Ever My Beat, when it slides up and down the scale
You would think my beats are graduate from Harvard or Yale
Strappin' other beats five on his way to the top
Havin' radio stations tune 'em up on the charts
Rockin' tum-tums, snares and timbalee's too
Playin' wit Batman, Snuffy and Winnie the Pooh
I do, I catch flu, as my beats boogaluh
And I never saw my beat drop a beat on the crew

[Delite]
My beat for ever, wit this I stand
As a maker of history, across the land
All though it's true that I'm a babe in the music, then
It's a fact on the wax I do cedrin
My beats cut rhyme, makin' you unwind
Prince Paul is droppin' needles, we right on time
Wit not a trace of discrace, cuz his slick, waste
And the bass orchestra all in ya face

[Frukwan]
4 Ever My Beat, sharp fimilatin', hot like fire
In blood 'cated, for my peeps desire
And provide expand to my very last breath
For that, which is a matter of life and death
Camouflage this beat and the'll never get learned
Simmer dark from the beats you've heared
Blow in other state, when our rhyme regulates
It's yellow I oppose, so congragulate, 4 Ever My Beat-a

[Outro]
4 Ever My...
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat
My beat forever
4 Ever My...
Beat, beat
My beat forever
4 Ever My...
