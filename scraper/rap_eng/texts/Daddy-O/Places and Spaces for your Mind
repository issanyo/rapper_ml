If you're from these areas OK - Lewisham, Brixton, Battersea, Wandsworth, Brockley - you know it. Where else? Clapham Common, Clapham South, Tottenham. If you're from Clarence Avenue, you know you're hype

We're doing this one for Schooly D

[Verse 1]
Places and spaces I've been
The roads and loads that I've seen
And all the people I've met
Much too much to forget
So here's a tale to get into
About the roads that we've been through
So listen up let me do my thing
And remember if it ain't got swing
It just won't cut it, so listen to me
When I say this song's got a hidden key
About the whos whats whys wheres or whens
Of the places and spaces I've been

[Verse 2]
Raised and born south side of London
Never making trouble, just having fun
Me and D made a pact, put our minds to rap
Turned words to cash cos we got it like that
See, we grew up together, it's a family thing
Some families dance, other families sing
But this family talked about what we write
One other thing: we don't fight
In school we chase the boys home
Of course the boys wouldn't leave us alone
Wanted to carry our books and be our ho's
But when the boys tried to get too close
We said nay and told them to step off
And a little after that we told them to get lost
Cos at that time boys could only be friends
In the places and spaces I've been

[Verse 3]
I remember one night we were doing a show
When this other rap group (You mean..?) (Yeah, you know)
Tried to cause a little friction, robbing us wrong
Started yelling and shouting during one of our songs
It was a nasty move, sort of got out of hand
Cos this kind of move was contrary to plans
The Cooks had a result to our favourite sport
Adjusted our mikes and we went off
The crew that were shouting - we pointed them out
Made an example by taking them out
And it was a prime example then
Of the place and spaces I've been

[Verse 4]
Now I've been Catford, been to Battersea
Amsterdam and Harlem, Milan in Italy
Cross checked the Bronx, New York, the US
All over London, south to west
But in all my travels near and far
We remained the same, stayed up to par
No ego-tripping cos that's a sin
In the places and spaces I've been
