[Chorus: Slick Rick, Kleptomaniac]
You didn't know? Go steal and rob!
You didn't know? Go steal and rob!
You didn't know? Go steal and rob!
You didn't know? Go steal and rob!
Crime fucking pays, motherfucker, fuck a job

[Verse 1: Kleptomaniac]
Peace to all the real niggas getting loot
Robbing banks, sticking stores, money bags exploding true
Niggas who do mad phone scams, the nigga in the street
Wants to leave a beast for the freak Armani man
Dosed they pockets with swindlers, relentless
Got sent the hoes down back, me beating niggas senseless
Nothing's pretense, bitch, it's real like a Dairy seal
Myself, I like to steal
Klep gotta do what Klep gotta do, so do you
American systems don't work, don't let them fool you
So control your number, hold, and lock your weed date
I set records straight, get the papes, get the papes
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
Closer to these babies in these sanitation jobs
So don't let them gas you up, let opportuns pass you up
Make the Arab gas and take their pants like cash
I get ridiculous with this kid sticking shit
Leaving no evidence, so dusting for fingerprints
It's irrelevant, don't get caught, and what you do
That's how you stack loot, see Lex coupes
And double grill Q's

[Chorus: Slick Rick, Kleptomaniac]
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob

[Verse 2: Kleptomaniac]
So hold that fake chain over the flame
Tell 'em "people of color won't change"
Knowing it's a trick to trick they fucking brain
That's how we do things in Crookyln
The realm where fists don't swing
All you hear is click bang, click bang
On those who perpetrate
With boots like tapes, certain scams I can't relate
Now their pocket waits my pocket-weight
Klept the great, it gets through thick skulls
That was your best? Have a fistful
Cris', Chris, and pistols
This, type of music is the perfect setting
For setting shit off in elevators
Check it, dates, well let's rock
Sauce her neck and, pocket-book checking
Break out a cup with your henchmen
Start to hit those digestions
Yo, you can't rap style on rap's Pharaoh
A lyrical rotisserie when I drop my mad flow
So show bones, like Academy Award skills
Like you know, who's that rap pro?
Step to Klept, you get toast
You didn't know?

[Chorus: Slick Rick, Kleptomaniac]
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
Crime fucking pays, motherfucker, fuck a job
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob

[Verse 3: Kleptomaniac]
A magnum fox, VCR box, packing rocks
Hundred in counterfeits, get broke down in weed-spots
Don't the scheming stop your dreaming, hops?
G'ing ass niggas giving D's headbutts and skeet knocks
I run through stores like I don't give a fuck
'cause them ups better duck, security guards is getting snuck
Buck, I'm stabbing wannabe heroes in the gut
I don't give a fuck I'm laughing in their camera for the full duck
Grabbing my nuts...

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
... I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smoking skunk and mad Phillies
Beating down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery is a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm burying ya bastards
Biggie Smalls ain't softening
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offering
Leave the fucker coughin'gup blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears
Comfort the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whipping my ride, counting my ones, thinking I'm richest
It's, just the way players play, all day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbing niggas since Run and them was singing 'Here We Go'
Snatchin' ropes at the Roxie homeboy, you didn't know?

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Ayo Klept man, you gotta chill with that robbing shit man
Word to mother man, that shit ain't gon' do nothing but bring death
Word to mother, man
I'mma take care of your baby and your mother
