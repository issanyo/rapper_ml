Hit em again

(Here's a little story that must be told)

[ Sean E.B. ]
Police maybe, punks never
Our rhymes are slammin and we won't ever
Become intimidated by the gossip stated
Instead we'll strive and let it motivate us
Cause we are brothers, don't try to diss
The 3 will get evil and then commit
Assault with deadly lyrics and make you admit
7A3 - we ain't havin it
When you recover you'll try to contend
But the 3 will be waitin and we'll hit you again

[ Bret E.B. ]
Intellectual seekers, seekin intellect
So if you're stalkin you better come correct
And guaranteed that when I give you a taste
It's like I buck you in your head and your grill out your face
So when they come to your funeral the casket's closed
The secrets that you keep are never exposed
Cause you thought you was a champ but you're just another vic
Said we were stupid but you're not that slick
Heard we're in the house, got your posse and hurried
Looked into my eyes - and then you scurried
Out the door because you have no heart
I see you seen the future and it tears you apart
Once you was a enemy but now you're a friend
Because you don't want the 3 to hit em again

[ Sean E.B. ]
Once upon a time when I first started rhymin
I used to wonder when I would start climbin
The charts, lookin away from the common problem
I lacked patience, and virtues, I had none
So I had to learn as time went on
About the trips I might be sent on
And by trips I don't mean a vacation
The first law of nature is self-preservation
So my motto is to hit em again
You wanna know why? Well, my friend
In the end the truth is you may not win
And if you don't win you can hit em again

[ Bret E.B. ]
Because of what I am and how I stand
You tend to fear my kind of man
Collectin knowledge from the mother Earth
And seekin out the prophecies since the date of birth
Brothers and sisters, believe in your dreams
Because without em you're a falcon with just one wing
Always lookin over mountains to see the sky
When you could look down as in the clouds you fly
Look at the child and all I feel is sorrow
It's hard today, and then tomorrow..
See, life is a game and anybody can win
And if at first you don't succeed, well then you hit em again
