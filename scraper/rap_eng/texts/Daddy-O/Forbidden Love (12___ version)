How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how can it be
How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how can it be, how

When I look into the mirror I see someone
Who's life will never be the same again
'Cause they say that what we found forbidden love, love
And the question we are up against

How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how can it be
How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how can it be

I've got to make that girl mine
I've been waiting all my life for someone just like you
We both know the feeling's fine
Oh, but society says that it should never, never be

How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how can it be
How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how can it be

Is reason ruling passion
When the power of attraction
Tempt us with satisfaction
Oh, it's just a natural reaction

This ain't no game we're playing
Regardless of what they're saying
Something inside is calling
So let them keep on talking

How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how can it be
How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how can it be

If it's love, girl, how could it be forbidden
The way I feel just can't remain hidden
Folks may talk but I don't care
'Cause wherever you are, girl, I wanna be there

Nothing comes close to the way you smile
And girl, your touch just drives me wild
You're everything I dream of
How could it be forbidden if it's love

How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how

Passion, pain, it's all the same
'Cause when it comes to you
This love is not a game for fame
'Cause my claim is loving you
And I'll break my back just to be true

We were put here for a special reason
And you're the pot that's cooking and I'm the seasoning
You're everything I dream of
How could it be forbidden if it's love

How can it be forbidden if it's love
How can it be, how

Loving you, girl, is marvelous
And when you're around my knees get nervous
For you, I need a word that describes
And the word I use is bonafide

From the first time ever I saw your face
In my heart, I created a special space
You're everything I dream of
How could it be forbidden if it's love

How can it be forbidden if it's love
How, how

If it's love, girl, how could it be forbidden
The way I feel just can't remain hidden
Folks may talk but I don't care
'Cause wherever you are, girl, I wanna be there

Nothing comes close to the way you smile
And girl, your touch just drives me wild
You're everything I dream of
How could it be forbidden if it's love
