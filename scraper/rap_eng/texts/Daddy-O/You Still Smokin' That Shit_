In a corner the ebony dad
The one prince called Paul
DBC and the Y supreme
And the Stet Stet drummer Bobby
The rhyme orator, no one greater
Stetioneered by the console Canadian with soul
This is a story yet untold
But when this shit unfolds
Oh well

Daddy-O i wasn't born with no silver spoon
I was  a girl like Brooke in the Blue Lagoon
I just wanted to be
What I could at the time
So I devoted my time to writing real good rhymes
Got challenged once, had a terrible fight
My opponents family wore black the next night
Put a fear in emcees the way I talk
And I'm a bad mother fucker from East New York

(Yo Daddy-O, guess who I seen the other day?)
Who you seen
(I seen Yadin)
You seen Yadin?
(Yah)
Yo what you have to say to him man?
(I said man, you still smoking that shit?)
