[Intro]
Kill the heart

[Verse 1]
Pull up it’s the weekend
Bout to dive off the deep in
She ain’t for love she ain’t for cuff she just for benjamin
In love with the money money hungry money feen money junky
She climbed up the pole she clawed her way to the money
She shaped like a pimp all this ice call me Gretsky
My whole team put up a force guess you could say that we’re Wealthy
Just playing the hate that dealt me
Father forgive us for living we just want to be wealthy
Put up in the droppy my old man just drop dead
I don’t do Obey I’m too fresh for crab legs
This salt I got too much season too many flavors
If God fake who can be against you I can’t see my haters
I’m just rolling my papers
Getting high off the vapor
Money talk like a scraper
Catching looks in my scraper

[Hook]
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy

[Verse 2]
Day dreaming about a mil
Got me touching my ribs
It is what it is
I’m a stack it up little by little
Two chins at the chance
Reaching all that’s at stake
Get it my way get paid
F*ck you when it’s our mistake
Said f*ck it took chickens
Won’t be bring the herd
Ain’t stopping this paper
Give her dad that’s my word
No pork on my fork
Then I went ham on the yams
Had a gate to bake it’s your man
Whip it up fast as I can
Then I had a couple of grams
Did my first ten
Bought a million rubber bands
Fill em up that’s the plan
I used to serve my pops
He was my number one customer
Lord forgive me for my sin
And no bribe was the hustle

[Hook]
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
We just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
Father forgive us we just want to be wealthy
