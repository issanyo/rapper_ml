[ Daddy-O ]
I buy my clothes at the Gap, I really know how to rap
I like root beer on tap and I'm a shorty strapped
And like Run once said I'm proud to be black
And if I sat on a bus, it wouldn't be in the back
And I reside in the East and all the Gods say peace
And every since I started rappin I've been Ebony Chief
And if I took the Pepsi Challenge, I'd choose Dr. Brown
Yo Wise, let me hear that Stet Troop sound

[ Daddy-O ]
Some people call me Kareem, at work they call me Glen
I was on tour last year, this year I'll do it again
And though I'm not a politician I know all my rights
I had a fight with a cop just last night
Address my girl 'my dear', been shootin guns for years
And I never been a sucker givin in to my peers
The Stet says a rhyme, I'm always on time
Wait a minute - let me think of my next line
Ehm - Ehm
Ehm - Okay
I eat at BBQ, meat-eatin days are through
I like it in Lake Charles, I like miami too
When I was in San Diego had to visit the zoo
And I don't like used cars, so I'mma buy one new
I'm readin Stephen King, Joan Collins ain't my thing
Whenever I got beef, I give [Name] a ring
I cool with Walter and Lumumba in an Aero Star
Yo Wise, a little bit of that human guitar

[ Daddy-O]
Thank you
And in karate class love when it's time to spar
I tape the daytime soaps on a VCR
I drink low-fat milk to give my tummy a rest
I use Dial in the shower cause I don't like Zest
I eat my ice creams slow, call Puerto-Ricans bro
And when I had a yoyo, I had the one that glowed
I used to make go-karts, now rappin is my art
Scott La Rock still lives inside my heart

[ Delite ]
Now I'm a lover of hats, I make money in stracks
Love to watch The Box, music video tracks
Always stayed in school, my mother raised no fool
And if I broke any rules, then my pops got rude
Call me MC Delite a/k/a Shaheed
Here to teach and lead by my rhymin spree
Make the crowd yell 'ho' when I go solo
Yo Wise, give me a taste of what you gave Daddy-O

[ Delite ]
I love to cool and relax with a girl that's real
She will chill at my place and I will cook the meal
I've been so many places and saw many faces
One city I remember was the city of Vegas
Other night never quits, prostitution's legit
And the crowd only cheered at the end of a skit
Oh, one other fact, I lost 300 smack
But soon I got the bets and I won it all back

[ Fruitkwan ]
All my sneakers are gold, on the mic I'm bold
Don't play me like I'm a kid, I'm 24 years old
I like to fly in a plane, call a woman a dame
Like the Empire State it's recognition I gain
Stet Troop and a beat, the world of Stet is complete
A lotta records are weak, but this one is unique
Like a Welch's grape, crushin suckers we hate
Yo Wise, come in on time, but not too late

[ Fruitkwan ]
On weekdays I build, the weekends I chill
And the closer you listen, you detect the skill
Then you think in your head about the lyric I said
You kick beats in the bed, I be creatin instead
People boogie in crowds, we can boogie alone
Though the music is loud you're in a 3D zone
Stet appearance react like a deck that's stacked
And like Radio Shack we're all over the damn map

We like cordless mics, we ride ninja bikes
We don't sing heavy metal and we don't wear spikes
We're classified as a fam, we operate six man
And if you call us a group, you get a body slam
Fruitkwan tailors clothes, Delite waxes foes
And we both rock house with Daddy-O
Paul's on the Technics, Wise kicks the beats
And DBC is on the keys with the drum machine
