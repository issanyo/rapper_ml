[Force MDs]
We're not the New Edition
We're not Levert or Guy
Straight from New York City
Here to tell you why
We are the mighty Force MDs
And we came to get paid
So all you fly ladies don't be afraid
With Stevie D and Mercury
TC and Trisco
With Stesasonic on the microphone
We were dancing
Dancin through the night
And romancing
With the Force up on the mic
MCs rocking, MCs shocking
And the fly girl seems to say
They spend money on their honeys
Just to come and hear us play
Gettin' laid, and in a fade
Is what the Force is all about
We will dine with you, drink wine with you
But never eat you out

[Daddy-O]
F-O-R-C-E-MDs
And if you please sucker MCs (tell 'em Daddy)
Step to the front, it's put up or shut up
Nine times out of ten you get paid up
Mad as hell, I see you wanna throw your hands up
But you know what? I think your time's up
And if you think about steppin' this way
Yo, fellas take it away
