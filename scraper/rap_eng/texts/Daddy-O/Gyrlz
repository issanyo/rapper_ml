[ Delite ]
Hey when it comes to girls I'm a instant junkie
For the short and petite and the tall and the chunky
The kind of girls that keep me swimmin in passion
Who broke the mold when it comes to satisfaction
Cause anytime's girl-watching time
Girl-watching time my time to unwind
Gotta find me a corner
And set my sight for the real eye-stormers
The fly short dresses, real tight jeans
Sweet personality with gold earrings
Girls are just like diamonds and pearls
And oh yeah, I like the girls
Kick it

(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls..)

[ Daddy-O ]
I'm talkin 'bout the woman
The sweetest that the Lord could make
Perfectly put, not one mistake
Delicately delicious, beyond compare
A man who don't like girls, I think he's outta there
I like the girls, the girls are sweet
25 hours, 8 days a week
Rubbin my back from a tired day
Gettin down with the Daddy with no delay
Makes me feel real sassy and I'm impressed
Her lips on my lips, my girl knows best
And when it comes down to fulfill my world
Yo Delite, I like the girls
Kick it

(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)

Scopin out a figure, curves beyond the mega
(It's Jimmy!) cold loaded up the trigger
Girls who are huggable, girls who are kissable
They're like Sally, so irresistible
Don't get me wrong, I'm not your mister sleazy
But man, damn, I love to get freaky
Like when she wanna tongue up my back
Oh yeah, I like it like that
Let me make this clear, she gotta really care
That good humor with a whole lot of flair
Cause when it comes to fulfillin my world
Yo bust it, I like the girls
Sing

(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)
(Girls, girls, girls
I like the girls)

Love the things they know
Love the things they show
Got to be where they go
Pretty girls, the sunshine in their hair
The perfume that they wear
Girls are everywhere) --] Moments & Whatnauts
