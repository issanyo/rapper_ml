[Daddy-O]
Ah ah I've been waitin and playin the backseat
Watchin MC's buy rhymes from the swap meet
Now should another year go by of the worst
Or do you wanna dibble what the Daddy does first?
Now if I was blue I'd be the size of an ocean
Keepin it calm, with minimal commotion
Kinda sorta like the way my rhymes gotta flow
Cause without that flow I wouldn't be Daddy-O
So go tell a friend, just who's on your dial
And if takes a minute, then I'll stay a while
Instead of shootin the gift, I'm bombin with my presents
With the knack to make a torture pleasant
Back to the bass root corn foundation
As the funky beat comin 'cross yo' station
Need to be alarmed?  Then call the Red Alert
But if nobody moves, nobody gets hurt

Chorus: Daddy-O

Now nobody move (nobody get hurt)
Nobody move (nobody get hurt)
C'mon, nobody move (nobody get hurt)
Tell me what you came to see? (Daddy-O doin work!)

[Daddy-O]
Check it, folks are consumed by the error
Who's got the best video, props on stage?  Whatever
I choose the Fellowship Shop
Cause when I go to rhyme for mine I get props
And most can't cut it cause they think like a dog
Somebody says, "Fetch!" and you're jumpin like a frog
You should stop runnin, you're forfeitin the race
And even if you ran you would be in last place
You gotta be tasty, just enough season
Wanna be a rapper?  You gotta have a reason
Wanna know mine?  I make a punk wanna shiver
And my flow is like the Euphrates river
Hello hello, wake-up wake-up
Time to put the rhyme caffeine in yo' cup
Is it true that poppa got a brand new bag?
I'm comin with my troops, so raise the flag
Allies are welcome, foes get crushed
Mainly cause they talk too god damn much
About gettin the skins, and raisin the skirts
But if nobody moves, nobody gets hurt

Chorus + minor variations (repeat 2X)

[Daddy-O]
I'm +Flowin in File+ with a bag full of goodies
Twenty-five deep out in Brooklyn with the hoodies
Solo creep?  Not unless I have to
So until that time, I guess my crew's gonna mop you
You see the Ed man made up the track
Mike Ajou, Peace and A.C.'s got my back
Daoud and Richard take care of engineerin
'Fore I forget, Richy Hustle does the steerin
My brother Kedar, keeps the crew in line so
That we can have a good strong and healthy cashflow
Some say whatever's clever, I say whatever works
And if nobody moevs, nobody gets hurt

Chorus + minor variations (repeat 2X)

[Daddy-O] Yeah!
