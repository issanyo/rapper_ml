[Daddy-O]
I was riding down the turnpike (PIKE) and I got stopped
By a Jersey State Trooper type cop (COP)
Proceeded to pull over (OVER) showed him my credentials
Cause searchin my car just wasn't subsequential
He took the route like most cops do (DO)
Harassin a black man like Little Boy Blue (BLUE)
But I kept cool (COOL) cause I got style (STYLE)
And because I knew, that in a little while
I'd be parlayin in New York where the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
Callin Cali, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Detroit, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Philly, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!

Bein a bold black Brownsville Brooklyn boy (BOY)
I rip rap records like the Real McCoy (COY)
When you say you wreck shop I say that's all? (ALL)
Cause I shun the ho-hum and mash the mall (MALL)
And no need to take time to stake me out (ME OUT)
Cause I'll beat your pee out and take the clout (CLOUT)
My crew's that thick like the GangStarr DWYCK (DWYCK)
And we don't need a strike to put you out (YOU OUT)
Cause whether in Cleveland the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
Or in Atlanta, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
Or Chicago, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Miami, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!

Check it walkin a beat, or drivin around (ROUND)
When you're in the hood you hear the same old sound (SOUND)
Old school beats meetin new school rhymes (RHYMES)
And styles, evolutin all the time (TIME)
And no-no, a badge can't move the crowd (CROWD)
And neither can a nightstick, that ain't slick (SLICK)
But Ed makes beats like a bulletproof vest (VEST)
Give it to me, and I'll do the rest (AND I'LL DO THE REST)
Cause in North Carolina the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Milwaukee, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
In Minneapolis, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Flint, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Fresno, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Houston, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Newark, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
In St. Louie, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Louisville, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
And in Saginaw, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
In Lake Charles, the niggas go BUC BUC BUK!
All down in D.C., niggas gettin BUC BUC BUK!
And in Oakland, the niggas get BUC BUC BUK!
In East New York, the niggas get BUC BUC BOOM!

[Dumb Cops]
You'd think that we'd learn from the Rodney King verdict
	Yeah niggers
