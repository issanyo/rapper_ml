Mi say everywhere mi go dem call me Daddy
And mi close friends call me Baby Sammy
Mi goal in life is to get me Grammy
Mi like go Palm Beach and Miami
Say when mi was a youth mi have to stay with granny
And when mi out of hand she whipped mi fanny
Now some like it dry, I like it wet
And some of them like it anyway they can get
I'm the Odad that you can't forget
I'm the Odad that you can't forget
With di mic in mi hand, mi crew by mi side
Let's take a ride, I'll be your guide
Words start flowin like a lyrical tide
Girls start movin dem big backsides
Mi lay down mi law and you will abide
And if you're drunk, then you will be tried
Me pon di stand, mi can't be denied
Mi a-fi Ebony Chief, me a-fi bonafide
Now some like it dry it, I like it wet it
And some of dem like it anyway dem can get it
I'm the Odad that you can't forget
I'm the Odad that you can't forget
Say when mi at home always get mi wish
Mi wife cook a dish of planters and fish
Mi listen to di sound of di compact disc
And when mi have a stain wash it out with whisk
Mi voice a-fi clean, mi mic a-fi crisp
Mi motherland is what I miss
Dem youth round mi way mi always diss
Cause knuckleheads always get me pissed
Now some like it dry, I like it wet
And some of dem like it anyway dem can get
I'm the Odad that you can't forget
I'm the Odad that you can't forget

O to y-double d-a-D
Yes it's me dem call Ebony
[Name] mi long to see
And I'm down with S-t-e-t
Mi brethren, the R.O.D
Don't forget the DBC
Fruitkwan and the Mix Machine
And Prince Paul, him cut real clean
Mi Daddy-O and him a rhymin fiend
And I'm here pon di scene
Him doesn't like gamblin and go ramblin
Him a-fi toured from Miami to Camden
And in a New York town dem be jammin
And when him rhyme to the beat him be slammin

Bo! Bo!
