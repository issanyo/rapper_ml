[Chorus: All]
We gonna rock to express, our methods to the catch
The pitcher at hand here, but we too best
You see the mark is a charge, the rappers are ours
So rock from ya lumber, we came here to rock!

[All]
Right about this time!

[Frukwan]
We make ya shake and shiver
The devastatin' rhymes we can deliver
And ya sucka M.C.'s, to us ya a minus
We dominate the charts cuz we are the world finest
Kings, who sat and heard Doug E. Fresh
And ya convicted to jail, now here's ya lesson
Stetsasonic, a name you will never forget

[Daddy-O]
But if you can't say it all!!!

[All]
Just Say Stet!

[Daddy-O]
Never were we meant to be ordinary
The way we rap is unique and legendary
Explicitally mapped, Stetsa, terrific
Permit as a group or should I be specific
Delite, Daddy-O and the D.B.C
Frukwan, and Paul and the Mix Machine
And I won't fret, if you take it as a threat
But if you can't say it all!!!

[All]
Just Say Stet!

"Funky" - scratched up

[Delite]
Now when I come wit it, wit style it prolific
No friction to our diction, strictly scientific
Before we leave, ya ladies will be pleased
I will shock the house, before I enter at breeze
Cuz Stetsa means loud, and Sonic means sound
And this is the name that's gonna be around
So let the name reflect and get it correct

[Daddy-O]
But if you can't say it all!!!

[All]
Just Say Stet!

(scratches)

[Delite]
Procision on the mix is the kid named Prince
The one beat king by the cut, he a vicks

[Frukwan]
And slicker than slick, fresher than fresh
Mix Machine Wise is sure to bless

[Daddy-O]
And we're the M.C.'s, that hail from the East

[all]
Wit the Stetsa-fly, rhyme, masterpiece
So it's straight to the floor, get ya butts off the wall
And rock wit Wise, and the one Prince Paul

(Wise beatboxing and Prince Paul scratching)

[Daddy-O] (all)
And if you find Stetsasonic (hard to pronounce)
Learn how to say it (and fix yo mouth)
Cuz that's superstars (we earn respect)
And go into our head (we won't let)
Why don't you pay to get in (you won't be upset)
And if it don't come (we won't fret)
Stetsasonic a name you will never forget
But if you can't stay it all (Just Say Stet!)
