[Intro]
Uh, FMG
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you a Cartel story
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas
'Bout this cartel
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas
I'm just tryna make a way (Yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way

[Chorus]
I'm never lookin' back, I get 20 thousand a show (Yeah)
I can't take a nap until it's time to go (No)
I've been very patient, I got it under control (Yeah)
I done lost my life, I've been livin' life on the road (Yeah)
Jumped up out the van and ran straight to the stage (Yeah)
I'ma let my man open up for me every day (Yeah)
I know y'all don't know 'em, but they tryna make a way (Yeah)
They get them a man and then listen to what they say (Listen to 'em, yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (My niggas)
I'm just tryna make a way for my childrens (My children)
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (Yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way for my childrens (Yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (My niggas)
I'm just tryna make a way for my childrens (My children)
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (Yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way for my childrens (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (For my niggas)
I'm just tryna make 'em wait for my nigga (For my nigga)
Got me in the pack with the killers (With them killers)
I be in the hood with the dealers (With the dealers)
You better not play with my niggas (My niggas)
I might just pull up and catch a case for my niggas (For my niggas)
Father told me, "I'm on the way, young nigga" (I'm on the way)
And "make sure the team straight, young nigga" (I will)
Yeah, we gon' do what we have to do
Workin' so hard like we really gotta point a tool
Gettin' to the money, but that shit ain't nothin' new
Drop-top Lamb', catch me hangin' out the damn roof
You know them niggas be hatin'
You know them niggas be hatin'
We just tryna make a way in
'Cause these other niggas be fakin'

[Verse 2]
Ate with the killers, broke bread with the dealers
Touched winter with my brothers, my nigga gon' kill ya
Ain't pressed for no rap, my heart in the trap
I was worth millions before I could rap
Real niggas ain't real no more
I don't know how to feel no more
Why the fuck you ain't real no more?
Switched up, want to see you grow
I love my brothers and they love me back
This shit forever, my nigga, and that's facts
Had a dream Ralo lead the Muslims
I was still gettin' it in through customs
Dream switched up, I lead the Christians
Who prayed that we feast, we need no more division
Woke up, then we hit the stage
Chain-snatchin' make the front page

[Chorus]
I'm never lookin' back, I get 20 thousand a show (Yeah)
I can't take a nap until it's time to go (No)
I've been very patient, I got it under control (Yeah)
I done lost my life, I've been livin' life on the road (Yeah)
Jumped up out the van and ran straight to the stage (Yeah)
I'ma let my man open up for me every day (Yeah)
I know y'all don't know 'em, but they tryna make a way (Yeah)
They get them a man and then listen to what they say (Listen to 'em, yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (My niggas)
I'm just tryna make a way for my childrens (My children)
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (Yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way for my childrens (Yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (My niggas)
I'm just tryna make a way for my childrens (My children)
I'm just tryna make a way for my niggas (Yeah)
I'm just tryna make a way for my childrens (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
I've been losin' shit to just hustlin' every day (Yeah)
Tryna run it up and just make sure my family straight (Yeah, yeah)
I've been deep in the dirt, it's like I'm diggin' a grave
May the Lord forgive me, I ain't know no other way
You either predator or prey, and I've been prayin' five times a day
I've been sinnin' for the money, need repentance, I'm God-fearin'
Hope I don't catch another sentence
'Cause I ain't tryna be a disappointment to my children (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I remember long nights, it was hard work (Hard work)
Trappin' hard, turn the soft work to hard work (Hard work)
Break down dimes bigger than a Starburst (Starburst)
I'm paintin' pictures with my past, John Doe, Van Gogh, this is artwork (Artwork)
And we just need an escape (Yeah)
Under so much pressure, they expected us to break (Yeah, yeah)
Had to learn patience 'cause I was tired of waitin'
Couldn't nobody save us, had to learn to wear a cape (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
