[Chorus]
Spent these racks on the Wraith
Put these racks in the safe
Bitch you know I got a kick
Bitch you know I got a play 'cause I'm trappin' for real
I'm trappin' for real, I'm trappin' for real, I'm trappin' for real, yeah
Spend these racks on the Wraith
Bitch you know I got a play

[Verse 1]
Twenty-eight grams in the trap, know a nigga flipping
Know that hammer on go, know they ain't slipping
Few bloods in my circles and some niggas cripping
Know a nigga got Scottie and a nigga pimpin'
Somebody else will drop it down 'cause a nigga tippin'
Why these niggas standing 'round, 'cause they ain't tipping
They know what I know, that hammer on go
I'm trapping for sure, I'm trapping for sure

[Chorus]
Spent these racks on the Wraith
Put these racks in the safe
Bitch you know I got a kick
Bitch you know I got a play 'cause I'm trappin' for real
I'm trappin' for real, I'm trappin' for real, I'm trappin' for real, yeah
Spend these racks on the Wraith
Bitch you know I got a play

[Verse 2]
Whips getting deported
Trump saying they foreigns
We ain't countin' up money
Everything else boring
Mansion on the hill
I'm naming it Lauryn
I'm counting my pockets
I ain't worried 'bout yours
Been on your field, ran up a check
How can you check him?
Touchdown dance moves, Odell Beckham
Big debate about the bricks, should I protect 'em?
When them shooters on your ass, who gon' protect you?

[Chorus]
Spent these racks on the Wraith
Put these racks in the safe
Bitch you know I got a kick
Bitch you know I got a play 'cause I'm trappin' for real
I'm trappin' for real, I'm trappin' for real, I'm trappin' for real, yeah
Spend these racks on the Wraith
Bitch you know I got a play
