Always counting hundreds
Bitch you know my trap jumping
Everybody catching plays
Everybody toting Ks
Always counting hundreds
Bitch you know my trap jumping
Everybody catching plays
Everybody toting Ks
Trap jumping

[Verse 1]
Bout to [?]
So much money on me, my teacher said detention
Did I forget to mention
Run your bands up, everybody let’s get it
You ride the benches
I’m chasing M’s, you chasing them pennies
Racks in the skinnies, trap jumping like Penny
Hardaway, might turn the soft to some hard today
Hit the shoe box and go bar today
I might just switch up the ‘Rar today
I might just take the whip on me
Bitches they like it, still foamy
Inomek please put the kick on it
Bitch you know I am the big homie
Racks hanging out, PeeWee Longway
Blowing gas out the strong way
You know it’s gon’ be a good day
Ca$h Out posted in the hood today
Pistol round me, oh you want to play?
They pulling up here like andale
Bullets go straight through your car today
I’m not acting like a star today
I might just go see some hard today

[Verse 2]
Put the bricks on the dresser
Whip one up and the J’s be the tester
You seeing my vision
I ain’t letting up, I’m staying consistent
Plug he consistent
Summer time, oh yes he’s dropping the ticket
Strapped in my britches, that’s right
Fuck slipping
Whip it up like Hibachi
Splitting the bricks, I call it karate
I’m throwing the potty
Trap [?], let you know that I got it
I see paparazzi
I got to be fresh, I know the feds watching
I’m tooled up, I’m schooled up
The chopper is chopping
The gas out, ain’t no speakers on
You know I want it in the [?] zone
I know you hear me through your speakers though
I know you see me in the trap spots
You heard I was in the crack pots
Everybody run a sack up
Everybody throw your flags up
