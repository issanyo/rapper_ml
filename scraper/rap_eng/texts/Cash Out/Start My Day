[Hook]

I wake up, count my clip
Start my day, get that money
Trying to make it out, but I'm counting up these hundreds
Surrounded by these thugs and drugs, up in the jungle
Playing by the rules, lil nigga, you better not fumble
And I ain't really playing, lil nigga, I want them commas
Take care of the fam, I gotta take care of momma
Pulling out the sticks on whoever want the drama
Stay down in the [?] and had a hell of a summer

[Verse 1]

What you know, bout the struggle, bout the grind
Break down lines, these niggas lying, I ain't lying
Put in time, in that bowl
Two trials, I never fold, G code
Lunch line, lunch line, french fries
I was told don't do the crime if you can't do the time
But all these niggas do the crime and they can't do the time
When it's [?], you know that's straight facts
I dropped a six in that bowl and brought an eight back
It's still hitting like glass, you know that straight crack
Like MJ, 45, I got that comeback
And when I get in your ho, you know she come back

[Hook]

I wake up, count my clip
Start my day, get that money
Trying to make it out, but I'm counting up these hundreds
Surrounded by these thugs and drugs, up in the jungle
Playing by the rules, lil nigga, you better not fumble
And I ain't really playing, lil nigga, I want them commas
Take care of the fam, I gotta take care of momma
Pulling out the sticks on whoever want the drama
Stay down in the [?] and had a hell of a summer

[Verse 2]

Listen here, I paint it clear
All I wanted was the meals, and that's for real
You either want it or you don't, take a pick
Roll with me and take a risk, let's get rich
Ain't nothing wrong with that shining, ice your wrist
Don't forget about the grinding, nigga, make it flip
Make it flip, make it flip, extra clips
Ain't got time for that talking, let it rip
Drop a nine piece, pull up on dime piece
She a fine freak, yeah, she a fine freak
He know I'm in the streets, he ain't get it from me
He know I'm in the streets, he ain't get it from me

[Hook]

I wake up, count my clip
Start my day, get that money
Trying to make it out, but I'm counting up these hundreds
Surrounded by these thugs and drugs, up in the jungle
Playing by the rules, lil nigga, you better not fumble
And I ain't really playing, lil nigga, I want them commas
Take care of the fam, I gotta take care of momma
Pulling out the sticks on whoever want the drama
Stay down in the [?] and had a hell of a summer
