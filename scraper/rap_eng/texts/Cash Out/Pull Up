[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Pull up in something you can't afford
Can't even pronounce the whip just know it make a lot of noise
Big car here seat two and come with a lot of doors
They say I broke the thermostat, bitch, I'm hot in Florida
The bitch I got a quarter, gorgeous, fine motherfocker
I pull up like Russel Westbrook, waste no time, motherfucker
Like a diaper, I pull up, I know snipers who shoot up
I know bitches who boot up, [?] not the money between us
I say I ride for my niggas, if they won't ride then we pull up
I got my eyes on you niggas, surveillance see when you pull up
Diarrhea, I'm shitting, might wanna grab you a pull up
Work like exercise, all I know is pull up

[Hook: Ca$h Out]
Yeah, they know the valet park me when I pull up
These bitches ain't gotta talk, they know to pull up
If a nigga play, you know we 'bout to pull up
And I been getting money since I was in pull ups
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
These bitches ain't gotta talk, they know to pull up
And I've been thinking 'bout this money since I was in pull ups
