[Intro:]
Hey
Gotta Keep It Real
I don't do the same thing
Gotta Keep It real
Gotta couple shootouts
Gotta Keep it real
Ain't gonna lie am f*cked up
Gotta keep it real
Had to open up the bank rolls
Bank and Seal
Gotta Keep it real [x5]

[Verse 1:]
My baby momma always talking shit
I can't lie i love a thug bitch
I jump out the port born ready
All the trapping nigga I will war already
For the trap houses in the neighborhood
Flat screen, thought we was living good
Serretta the emerald stripe
Pull up to your house at the red light
I know triggers, ain't no amateur
Im thinking of ways I can handle ya
Nigga should be dead right now
Cause i'm getting they bread right now
Trap House closed up
All these niggas turn in fear right now
I know that nigga never been a thug
I know that nigga’s a lip
I know they gon’ snitch
I know they gon’ fall
Sending green dots to niggas that never bought me a mil
They be like god damn
Cash out, you keep it so real

[Chorus:]
I hear the trap’s at the trap house
Gotta Keep It real
Had a couple shootouts
Gotta Keep it real
Ain't gonna lie am f*cked up
Gotta keep it real
Had to open up the bank rolls
Bank and Seal
Gotta Keep it real [x5]
My baby momma always talking shit
I can't lie i love a thug bitch

[Verse 2:]
Keep it real with the real f*ck the fake
We know they gon’ hate
Where i’m from is a jungle
Either hustle or take
Niggas don't respect your money
In my section, yeah we taking money
Serve and cut your boy done
Motherf*cker yelling sick of run
And i miss my nigga
And i been with my nigga
But im here for a reason
Im still breathing
I'm forever sly
Im still breathing
Without a care in the world
And god blessed me with a son, ima give him the world
And thats real, with or without the deal
I get my hands dirty in that field
So ima heal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I'm 18 with a  soccer momma
Bad, bunkin the beat with pills
Nigga gotta do what he gotta do
I'm thuggin with you Mr. Steel
Hands bloody, i hit that spot around the block
So ima heal, the way a nigga move so G-code
My old holes still in me, copperfield
Oh no, no mansion , no copperfield
Still in the streets shooting, he for real
These niggas drop, getting my team hot
I ain't smelling that
They say the nigga who war will be screaming the loudest
You is Aliyah hoe
I could be back at the
They so ready to go
Told them i push for real
Told them i'm married and you mother f*ckers say nothin
I almost got killed
Should i guess ima kill myself
Im rolling the dice, lifes a gamble for real
Picture me running from any nigga
This unreal, like nigga be real

[Chorus:]
My baby momma always talking shit
I can't lie i love a thug bitch
Gotta Keep It Real
