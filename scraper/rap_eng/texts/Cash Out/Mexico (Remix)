[Intro: Ca$h Out]
I want to go to Mexico
I want to go to Mexico
Boss up

[Hook: Ca$h Out]
I want to go to Mexico
I heard they got 'em for the low
She wonder why my wrist, it glow
Because I came from Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico (x3)
I heard they got 'em for the low

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
I know that they cheaper, they driving a Jeep
I'm up in the kitchen, I'm whipping a pigeon
I heard amigo got it for the low low
I wanna go to Mexico
I go to Africa to get my diamonds
I go to L.A. just to change the climate
I go to Miami, they dig my ho
But for the blow I wanna go to Mexico
I know that they snitching, I know that they snitch
I'm up in they kitchen
These bitches, they lovin' the way that I kick it
Big bankroll on me you can't fold
Shooters on four corners, that mean they better go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
No furniture inside the stash house
Too much work'll make you pass out
And I'm going back to Mexico
Know I love the game, I can't let it go
I get it in Memphis, I ship it to Cali
It come from the valley, I'm stopping in Dallas
My house is white and my car is white
My family good, our bills paid, we alright, I'm hustlin'
Yeah, and I'm going back to Mexico
Prices hella high, I'm tryna keep 'em low, low
And I know people who know people
In Mexico, so I get my blow cheaper

[Hook]

[Outro: Ca$h Out]
I wanna go to Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico
