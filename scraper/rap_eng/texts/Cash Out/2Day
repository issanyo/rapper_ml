[Hook]
My niggas, we getting chips (frito lays)
My bitches, they bring me flowers (a bouquet)
The sun is out, this how I’m feeling (hot today)
Had the whip yesterday (straight drop today)
Feel alive (today)
This girl (today)
[?] club (today)
At the mall (today)
My niggas, we getting chips (frito lays)
My bitches, they bring me flowers (a bouquet)

[Verse 1]
I ain’t getting nothing but some sacks (a [?])
[?] 30 and we’re strapped (that’s an A with a K)
Stop playing, throw it back
Bring extortion to the rap
Yeah, I miss Givenchy with my little one
Miss Ferrari with Ferragamo, [?] pull up on Pablo
This drum K with my nachos
Your boss baby, come and [?]
Killing all your soldiers, then coming for the head hancho
Car came with a camera
Room came with a camera
[?] came with a [?]
Make you do the MC Hammer
Gucci pajamas, I’d power up like Goku
All in China speaking different languages
Eating me some tofu

My niggas, we getting chips (frito lays)

The sun is out, this how I’m feeling (hot today)

[Verse 2]
I really just want the money
My house it came with a [?]
These niggas be saving girls
Banana clip for all you monkeys
Yup, [?] when I’m doing stick ups
When I’m in the room they got hiccups
I pull up, pull off, do pick ups
You know I’m picking that check up
Head shots, what you wear your vest for
And I put my life on the line
But I still holler baby [?]
Smooth with my talking, cool with my walking
Even if it’s rogue I got to double park it
Killing all these beats, you can say I’m heartless
Baby I’m Aladdin, you should bring my carpet
