[Hook – Ca$h Out]
Come in, shut the door
Trap rolling, cooking blow
Trap a deuce, trap a four
Trap rolling, close the door
Choppers in this bitch, blow in this bitch
Close the door, lean in this bitch, gas in this bitch
Close the door, molly in this bitch, cash in this bitch
Close the door, close the door
Close the door

[Verse 1 – Ca$h Out]
Come on in and close the door
I’m a real stay down [?] soldier ho
You can ask all the Js that I sold the blow
Straight cocaine with a little soda four
It smell so loud when I whip it out the pack
It made me a number whipping foreign out the ‘lac
My hand on my strap cause I know they’re tryna plot
And I’mma stay down till a young nigga rot
And if you can’t plan then you bound to get shot
And if you can’t plan then you bound to get shot
Snitch niggas singing like they just got
Snitch niggas singing like they just got
Hell motherfucking naw you can’t come in my spot
Hell motherfucking naw you can’t come in my spot
So close the door
Nigga getting mad cause I sold his ho, just like I sold the blow
The plug made me mad when he sold the boat, goddamn how I’mma get the blow
Get the boat off the motherfucking border nigga
In the pot I’m whipping up butter nigga
Now your whole fucking block in trouble nigga
Straight pure shit, straight out the border niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Ca$h Out]
Salute to my shooter I know that I see you
Off in my kitchen, I’m cooking up chickens
The blow and the gas, foreign bitches they shaking they ass
Know that they booty, you know that they turnt
Mafia shit, who got that trap
You niggas is tripping, you think that I’m slipping
I keep the extendo
Placing these orders, I’m beating the dough
Like Ike did Tina, I gotta get extras
So call me professor, I pull up compressor
Jump out with bottles, I’m smelling like money
Diamonds in my Rolex, you know they impressed
After that I hit your girl and made her cum fast
BLR, bases is loaded, you know that we bad
Niggas get mad about bitches you know that we passed
Whipping the coupe with the blow and the ho and you know we gone pass
Speaking to you with the trashy lil nigga so come in and close my trap door
The plug a migo, I get the motherfucking thing straight off the banana boat
Fishscale blow, the odor gone smell so nigga close my trap door
