[Intro]
Let's get it, nigga, let's get it
If you bout this money, let's get it
Boss up

[Chorus]
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
Bitches, they stare at my pants and be like "Boy, what's in them britches?"
Keep red bottoms on the bottom my shoe, they like how we kick it
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told 'em niggas "Let's get it"
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told 'em niggas "Let's get it"

[Verse 1]
I'm in a boat, yeah, I’m in a boat, yeah, I'm in a boat
I'm cooking up blow, I'm cooking up blow, I'm cooking up blow
A half a brick for my body before I come to your show
A half of brick or better before you come to my door
Let's get it, she know I'm a D-boy
China Connect, Bruce Leroy
My Forgis, my Forgis, put the baby on her face
Fucking her bush, this be the closed casket
Go get me a coffin, let's get it, let's get it, let’s get it
These bitches, they cook naked, showing they ass and titties
And I know that she with it
And before I said something, she said "Let's get it"

[Chorus]
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
Bitches, they stare at my pants and be like "Boy, what's in them britches?"
Keep red bottoms on the bottom my shoe, they like how we kick it
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told 'em niggas "Let's get it"
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told 'em niggas "Let's get it"

[Verse 2]
The cameras are rolling, my diamonds are flashing, we making a movie
They're makin' my Austin and I got the powers, the bitches are groovin'
Keep that on the low-low, yeah, I got the mojo from moving the coco
I'm sipping on iced tea, my couch is a mink and I'm watching some Oprah
Let's get it, I'm stacking a poop and I'm taking a shit
I'm paying in full and I'm feeling like Mitch
Matching Rollie, matching Benzes
Player pad with your favorite actress in it
Pass that, heh, fettuccine
Heh heh, some of that shrimp linguine, hah
Now you go in, pinky
I'm tryna take over the world, hold up my Pinky

[Chorus]
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
Bitches, they stare at my pants and be like "Boy, what's in them britches?"
Keep red bottoms on the bottom my shoe, they like how we kick it
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told 'em niggas "Let's get it"
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told 'em niggas "Let's get it"
