[Intro]
I want to go to Mexico
I want to go to Mexico
Boss up

[Hook]
I want to go to Mexico
I heard they got 'em for the low
She wonder why my wrist, it glow
Because I came from Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico (x3)
I heard they got 'em for the low

[Verse 1]
I know that they cheaper, they driving a Jeep
I'm up in the kitchen, I'm whipping a pigeon
I heard amigo got it for the low low
I wanna go to Mexico
I go to Africa to get my diamonds
I go to L.A. just to change the climate
I go to Miami, they dig my ho
But for the blow I wanna go to Mexico
I know that they snitching, I know that they snitch
I'm up in they kitchen
These bitches, they lovin' the way that I kick it
Big bankroll on me you can't fold
Shooters on four corners, that mean they better go

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Stop talking the blow, you ain't been in them kitchens
Like Nikes on check cause I got a witness
We take 'em to waist, we turn 'em to fifties
No re-rock
Boy, I got soldiers, no Reeboks
Push that young back, a 3-5
We come from Amsterdam in a foreign baby
Yeah, I'm in a Lamb
With a grip on it, wanna let you know
Gotta take a trip to Mexico
And make that shit right back
No center, I got a sack
Green Bay, yeah, I got the pack
I flip it, go get my racks
Then re-up and reload
And what's on my wishlist is Mexico

[Hook]

[Outro]
I wanna go to Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico
I wanna go to Mexico
