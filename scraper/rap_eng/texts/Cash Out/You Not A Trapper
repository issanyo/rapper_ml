[Intro:]
Briggs this shit finna kill these niggas

[Verse 1:]
Look on your wrist with a armband nigga
Checkers talking bout robbing the spot
Gotta come flip em flip em
Extra grams wht I left in the pot
Ful it to customs
Pussy niggas all in paperwork
So how could I fuck with you
Laid in bushes with the chopper
Just to put the pressure on you
Little nigga on the block with big pussy so test me lil nigga
You can tell the way I'm talking I played in the kitchen
Rap trappin ass nigga how do you whip it

[Chorus:]
I used to play with the chickens
I used t play with the motherfucking chickens
Step in the kitchen and whip it
I step in the kitchen the water I whip it
The police be round at the ghost
The police be running I bet I see flip em
I'm grabbing and flashing the four
I grab it and flash it cause your nigga ain't going back no more
You're not a trapper hey you're not a trapper
You're not a trapper hey you're not a trapper
You're not a trapper hey now that you're in trouble
Hey you're not a trapper
Hey, I used to play in the kitchens
I'm grabbing and flashing the four
Flip em, flip em, flip em

[Verse 2:]
If you was a trapper I am no rapper
I keep them safe [?] or locker
Both of them acting, you is no actor
Me and Cash Out just cash out on the actor
Inform like a priest, it was lime green
Now I try my motherfucking best not to try out the celine
Remember them days I tried dashing the levin
I coulda turn a fucking seven to a fourteen
You say that you trapping but I know you lacking
Tremor when the feds bring your body to a fraction
You should be the  dope then I think the bitch knows
Then on top of the stove and beat the pot like embos
You is no trapper so stop all the flexing
I keep the pipes like I am a Texan
Can't trap a to rapper just like Vatos
Remix it step on the dough with my toes

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Briggs this shit finna kill these niggas
