[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Smoke so much purp that I just might go colorblind
Dick so long, you can land a plane on it, I'm just being honest
Picking your bitch like a guitar for later (yeah what's up?)
She ringing me cause she know I'ma only pick up for the pay up
Get that pussy wet, my lifestyle aquatic
My bad bitch, she exotic, she is a
Native, Egyptian, American, she's every woman, she's swearing it
I told her, I need my reefer
Fuck me, suck me and rub my tummy
Can't believe that she keep our little secret for so long

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
She said, "All I'm ever good for is sex and money"
Di-dick and money
I said "All I wanna give to you girl, is this dick and money
This dick and money"
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings

[Verse 2: Ca$h Out]
We fuck on the yacht and drink champagne just to sober up the sex
I suck on her neck, I pull up in vet
He the rookie, I'm the vet
Got no disrespect, but I swear you guys gon' learn today
Same nigga and I'm gettin' paid, you feelin' some type of way
Girl I can explain to you, something is changing you
So why is you into me? Something bout TMZ
Starting to make sense
She say that she feelin' it, she reach for the ceilin'
I ain't got no feelings, drop top on the ceilin'

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
She said, "All I'm ever good for is sex and money"
Di-dick and money
I said "All I wanna give to you girl, is this dick and money
This dick and money"
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings

[Verse 3: Travi$ Scott]
Drank so much codeine, drinking 'til I'm colorblind
She gon' do the coke until she can't see the line
I re-ed up on my reefer
Xanax got me sleeper
Leaner by the liter
I drown in my bitch, she aquarius
All this codeine got me nodding off
Yo bitch at the crib, nodding off
All these pills got me nodding off
I'ma get turnt 'til my knob is off
Give her my love, nigga not at all, nod it off you know

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
She said, "All I'm ever good for is sex and money"
Di-dick and money
I said "All I wanna give to you girl, is this dick and money
This dick and money"
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings, no feelings

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
She said, "All I'm ever good for is sex and money"
Di-dick and money
I said "All I wanna give to you girl, is this dick and money
This dick and money"
This dick and money, this dick and money
