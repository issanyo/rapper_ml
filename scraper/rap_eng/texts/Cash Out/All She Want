"Durk...she neva seen no money man"
"You ain't neva seen no real money, baby"

[Hook] (Cash Out)
All she want is a nigga with some money (she want that money man)
All she want is a nigga with some money (she love niggas with money)
Well you got the right one baby cuz I'm stacked (you got the right one baby)
And you think you seen some money, you ain't seen nothing (you ain't seen some real money baby)
She like boy why you talkin to me? (talkin to me)
Cuz I ain't gotta talk, my money talkin for me (talkin for me)
All she want is a nigga with some money (she like that money man)
All she want is a nigga with some money and you can't knock her for that

Don't miss a beat or you ashed out
Rollie on me like twenty thou
Turned down for what? You can't hear me now
Dees on me got the brighten on me
My car too, I'm Bentley'd down
Used to flex with a box Chevy and now I flex with a Bentley now
Good hoes, they love me
Them classy hoes, they love me too
They say they on my squad
And now you see what that money do
Got bricks all in my garage
That trap house doin numbers too
Shittin on these haters
My watching taking a number 2
Real money that's old money
That rap money is just a flip
Mismatchin designer, I go hard on that Ester shit
Yo man, he want love and affection
With me, love out the question
Let's get it

No frontin, just pumpin
And we throw it in the air, we ball baby
Diamonds in my fish tank
Money in bout six banks
Walk around with my nose tooted up like my shit don't stank
Eatin over here, it's a movie, they stressed out, please don't blank
Cuz you might miss something

[Verse 3] (Lil Durk)
These bitches will fuck for fame
These bitches will fuck for names
These bitches be fuckin lame
These broke niggas, that's a fuckin shame
Walk in the club doin thirty thousand
Young nigga move, young niggas wildin
Red or green ders, my chain Italian
Money machine cuz I don't like to count it
Ride around with Keisha, with a bitch named Keisha
All these hoes they need us, all these hoes they eaters
Bad bitch doing threesomes
Ball shit throw meters
Talk about millions, OTF in the building
Paid in full, check
Checker bag, check
Bad bitch, check
I'm just a young nigga with a check
Turn up!
