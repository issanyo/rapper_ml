[Chorus]
I feel like Pablo Escobar, fishscale in my car
Fishscale in my Rollie, your trap, it ain't rollin'
I just met the plug, we got all the drugs
We show all the love, I feel like the plug
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
I feel like Pablo Escobar, fishscale in my car
Fishscale in my Rollie, your trap, it ain't rollin'

[Verse 1]
Narcos, narcos, Pablo, Pablo
I call my man for the low low
We 'bout to drop that snow dough
I never talk to the po-po
Always ran from the po-po
Strap on the seat, trap every week, y'all niggas weak
We in the streets, a couple of safes, that's a couple of Pateks
Call up the freaks, I'm havin' a feast, goddamn I'm a beast
Make the trap beat, just like the beat
Just like the beat, ooh
Trap, trap, I'm gettin' money, you niggas funny
Actin' real monkey, choppers for monkeys
Don't touch that load, don't come for that dough
With that bullshit, nigga better get low
I'm sendin' straight hits, feelin' like Pablo

[Chorus]
I feel like Pablo Escobar, fishscale in my car
Fishscale in my Rollie, your trap, it ain't rollin'
I just met the plug, we got all the drugs
We show all the love, I feel like the plug
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
I feel like Pablo Escobar, fishscale in my car
Fishscale in my Rollie, your trap, it ain't rollin'

[Verse 2]
Ask me how I'm feelin', I'm tryna make some millions
Stack it to the ceilin', Pablo, Pablo
Come and ride with me, go'n and take that risk
This a clean trip, Pablo, Pablo, ayy
Usin' the iPhone, only for the calculator
Got the trap phones goin' up like elevators
I know they watchin'
I know they lookin', I pose for haters
My pockets cheddar, I let 'em know I'm gettin' paper
Run the trap like Que
But I flip them grams and got that paper
Went and copped like eight
But I ain't Kobe B, I ain't play for them Lakers
Know I'm trappin' them numbers
What the fuck out talkin' 'bout, I ain't got no favors
Better be 'bout M's
When you sittin' down and you talkin' by the table

[Chorus]
I feel like Pablo Escobar, fishscale in my car
Fishscale in my Rollie, your trap, it ain't rollin'
I just met the plug, we got all the drugs
We show all the love, I feel like the plug
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
I feel like Pablo Escobar, fishscale in my car
Fishscale in my Rollie, your trap, it ain't rollin'
