I knew when I first saw you I just wanted to touch you
And hold you
And there's an incredible excitement about you
Something very powerful
Yeah, I got this good feeling about you when I first saw you
So where do we go from here?
We go all the way to the top if your'e not afraid
Things gon' be alright, I'm gon' be everything to you
Gonna be your father, I'm gonna be your friend
Gonna be your lover, but you gotta believe in me
You gotta believe everything I tell you to do is for the best

Here's a toast to what we're heading to
