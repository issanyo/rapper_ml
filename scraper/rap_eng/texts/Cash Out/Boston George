[Chorus:]
Run up a cheque flex up flex up on a hater
Get in the kitchen whip up whip up mashed potatoes
Keep the noise down boy you know we got nosy neighbours
Boston George in this bitch in a house full of paper [x3]
Flex up flex up flex up on a hater
In the kitchen whippin brickies call it mashed potatoes

[Verse 1:]
In the kitchen tryna whip that shit till it turn ten
Intragram sound pull up in the lawn God damn hater watching me
Sheesh! roll up a fat leaf don't call nor text me
The best way is to meet me nigga greet me [it coming up over]
Over the water the code name is Fiji
My diamond so water making the salt turn into hard rock
Oh! trap house be the partner
Bottom number 2 low hear the police
I don't want your offer when you in the trap shit nigga
You gotta be smarter, understand me [?] you risk it [?]
Late what 1852 think the customer was [?]
One TV got the cables one TV got the cameras
Doorman got the hammer flerk the door can't go back this llamas

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Right now it be that trap shit
Hit the gag get the brick shit nigga this the unwrapped shit
Learn how to work a wrist it'll put you on the map quick
Yeah, trap homie Nard & B, Metro Boomin call the plug go up on tuesday
From the pirax to the project, checked
From the projects to a mansion, checked
Money easy but you gotta earn, respect
Been ridin to the money till your [?]
Come in in the morning
Automatic pistol nigga this the trap manual
Splitting bricks down the middle now they got a camel toe
Ricky get out the kitchen while I water whippin you just wanna listen
I heard you niggas whisper I played you from a distance
Trap up

[Chorus]
