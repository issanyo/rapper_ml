[Intro: Ca$h Out]
Stop hatin' and get you a bankroll
You'll feel better
I just want a bankroll, BR man

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
Boy, hang with double Gs, everything is Gucci
We be at the table eating lots of sushi
She a gangsta bitch, she stuff it in her coochie
Boy, I hang with winners and you keep on losin'
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
Boy, hang with double Gs, everything is Gucci
We be at the table eating lots of sushi

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
A hundred dollar place, thousand dollar shoes
Fifty thousand for my jewels, "ooh, he so cool"
These bitches wanna touch me, these bitches wanna fuck me
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll, that's all of my discussion
A hundred new rollies, I'm pimpin' like Goldie
She workin', she workin', she workin'
She twerkin', she twerkin', she twerkin'
I'm lurkin', I'm lurkin', I'm lurkin', I'm looking for the bankroll
Lookin' at my clock like "When the bank close?"
I love them blue hundas, she lookin' at my pockets like
"Brrr, lovin' them drogas", them bands baby
God damn, look at all of that in them pants baby
Bankroll, bankroll, hey, I'm the man baby

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
Boy, hang with double Gs, everything is Gucci
We be at the table eating lots of sushi
She a gangsta bitch, she stuff it in her coochie
Boy, I hang with winners and you keep on losin'
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
Boy, hang with double Gs, everything is Gucci
We be at the table eating lots of sushi

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
Got a bankroll in all four pockets
I'ma get me a bankroll as soon as door lockin'
Bankroll sloppy, nigga, fallin' out of pockets
All these motherfuckers hungry, not a fuckin' tube stocking
So many fuckin' bankrolls, coulda bought a Robin
So many fuckin' bankrolls, time to count a thousand
Twenty grand, five sittin', two to mow the ground wit'
Babies on a motherfucker, no seven thousand
Bankroll, long head, gone in a Audi
Nigga seen the powder, powder on the ceiling
Powder on the ceiling, all these bitch niggas tellin'
Pussy nigga tellin' tryna make me a fuckin' felon
Big bankrolls, all the hoes, I'm flexin'
Keep bankrolls on me, no second guessin'
Cashin' out, bankroll, nigga wanna bet it
Carry zone-a niggas, we VVS-in' - 357, don't try 211
Fuck around, you gon' meet the fuckin' decon and the reverend
Reverend and the decon, leave a nigga leakin'
I ain't talkin' to you broke hoes cause the money speakin'
Ca$h Out leavin' for the cash up in the evening
Drop a Cleveland, in traffic weekend
Got it on me right now cause the trap beamin'
Bankroll, pussy ass nigga, we eatin', gone

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
Boy, hang with double Gs, everything is Gucci
We be at the table eating lots of sushi
She a gangsta bitch, she stuff it in her coochie
Boy, I hang with winners and you keep on losin'
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
I just want a bankroll
Boy, hang with double Gs, everything is Gucci
We be at the table eating lots of sushi
