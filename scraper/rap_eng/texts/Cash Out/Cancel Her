[Hook: Ca$h Out]
And we gettin' to money, don't know if he know
These niggas hidin' they bitches cause I'm a [?]
I walk around in my pocket a half a kilo
And if that bitch out of pocket then I'mma
Cancel that bitch like Nino (x6)
And we gettin' to money, don't know if he know

[Verse 1: King Ray]
Switch a bitch like I switch a outfit
I need to refine if she don't fit
Don't cook but she suck good dick
I like her [?]
Sex so good that she hate me
Cut her ass off like K Camp
Ridin' off summer with the back camp
Cancel that bitch like Nino
Got plug with some A-1 primo
Right now, no way finito
She got a mouth full of meat, no burrito
[?] ego
Been since here spittin' illegal
I took your chick that's a repo
I payed that for no Rico
Put designer all on my body
Took your gal in my lobby
Geeked up molly had her running around the lobby
[?]
Pull up on got me lookin' foreign
[?]
Straight to the top is where I'm goin'

[Hook: Ca$h Out]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Cancel that bitch, dismantle that bitch

Cut that bitch off
Cut that bitch off

[Hook: Ca$h Out]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Cancel that bitch like Nino, treat the rap game like a Carter
Get more chips than casino’s, I want my cut just like a barber
I'm in San Tropez with a ten, she goin' up shorty on ten
She fell in love with my Hublot, diamonds a girl’s best friend
Now wanna hook her up with my friend
Lil mama don't catch no feelings
My car just like Lil Wayne, that bitch ain't got no ceilings
And bitch I got no feelings, tryna be the first rap nigga with a trillion
I got racks and I got plenty cash, but my homeboys still out dealin'
Real to the streets yean a hundred don't just speak
Real niggas get paid stack the stick don't crest
I chase this cake but ain't shit sweet
Gettin' money til it ain't nothing left
And you would too get it while you can being broke ain't good for your health
