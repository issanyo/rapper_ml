[Chorus:]
I've been broke since letting you know
Now everywhere we go we put on a show
Done came a long way from from swinging them blows
Just letting you know, just letting you know
Stuffing, rushing X in my shoes
Running from the police breaking the rules
And this ain't a fluke
I'm just letting you know, just letting you know

[Verse 1:]
I used to post up on the corner
Singing blowing good marijuana
Play with me and you is a goner
Am just letting you know, just letting you know
Hop out the pussy then hop in the kitchen
You talking bout money then lets be specific
And yea i'm so with it
I'm just letting you know
Break down is a perfect spot for ratchets
Now a nigga cash out at versace
Rich kinda fucked up from cooking up blow
Just letting you know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I'ma turn up for my people
Everywhere we go is a sequel
Im from the streets you should know, the streets you should know
Used to run away from the police
Rob a nigga with a slow creek
If you want drama gotta show me
Thats right
Don't know why these niggas think im playin with em
Choppers and them pistols man i'm staying with them
Ain't tryng to go that route so we gon turn it up tonight
Yo cash out bring em bags out, we gon turn it up tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
What you know about the pot on the stove
We had no heat had to sleep in the cold
When i'm on one knee gotta pray for the father
Then hope someâ€™ make it up and get me out the struggle
Hard times and emotion got me spit do or die
Put the beam on the cakes i ain't scared to pie
And all i ever wanted was to be a ghetto superstar
I done see my niggas take a loss and get better now
And if they letting young niggas had trust
Let them know ATL tryna buy them a car
I want my all my niggas to make it
If we don't we forever taken
And this lying shit what made NBA most valuable players
Feel like Kobe and bitch i got a shot
Put a the tate on the nine so i shoot no sign
And all these niggas out here be trapped
But me and my niggas still get no spot
Gotta make it for the nigas on the block
And gotta make it for the niggas down the road

[Chorus]
