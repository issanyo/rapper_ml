[Intro]
(yeah)
(whats your name)
(yeah)
(well they call me tion)

[Chorus]
Girl the way you dancing
Got me feeling like swayze
Let me kiss you in french
Then i can make you go crazy
Singing with my tongue like
Ooh la la la, la la la
Ooh la la la
(singing with my tongue like)
Ooh la la la, la la la
Ooh la la la

[Verse 1]
If you put it on me do it like you mean it
Singing melodies i can tell I've got you feenin'
Brighten up your skills
Hitting all the notes
I can have you saying words you don't even know the meaning
I know what you want me to do (take a chance girl)
Though we ain't got nothing to loose (let me get the last dance girl)

[Bridge]
She likes to take it low cause she started from the bottom
Watch me take her for a bottom (bottom)
30 whole minutes got her biting on my collar
Ima take and leave every girl you can follow

[Chorus]
Girl the way you dancing
Got me feeling like swasey
Let me kiss you in french
Then i can make you go crazy
Singing with my tongue like
Ooh la la la, la la la
Ooh la la la
(singing with my tongue like)
Ooh la la la, la la la
Ooh la la la

[Verse 2]
Oh girl i want it in the worst way
Yeah cake cake just like its your birthday
Put me in a trance like you've never seen a rotate
Watch her do her dance she gone drop it like an earthquake
The DJ is playing our song (come a bit closer girl)
Its late but we ain't going home (the party ain't over girl)

[Bridge]
She likes to take it low cause she started from the bottom
Watch me take her for a bottom
30 whole minutes got her biting on my collar
Ima take and leave every girl you can follow

[Chorus]
Girl the way you dancing
Got me feeling like swayze (got me feeling like swayze)
Let me kiss you in french
Then I can make you go crazy
Singing with my tongue like
Ooh la la la, la la la

(singing with my tongue like)
Ooh la la la, la la la
Ooh la la la

[Verse 3]
She said her neck, her back

Red bottom for the heel clique
She lives in the hills and she pays her own bills ooh

Conversation smooth smooth operator
You taste like candy, i want it now and later
Start in the car and in the elevator
The hoes ain't loyal I got hella paper
With the tongue yeah i got the taste eh

I dance in the pussy i call that booty sway

[Chorus]
Girl the way you dancing
Got me feeling like swasey (swasey)
Let me kiss you in french
Then i can make you go crazy
Singing with my tongue like
