Ain't nobody can't even fuck with me with money on the phone
Everybody wanna fuck with me when money overflowin'
I ain't never had love in my whole damn life
Money is my motivation, nigga, motherfuck a wife

When my time gon' come? Every night I ask God
But I ain't gon' stop, nigga nah, not now
I am not a pussy nigga, I will not back down
