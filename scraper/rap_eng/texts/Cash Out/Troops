[Chorus:]
Random cup random shows she gon choose
We got guns we got guns we troops
Blessed love real niggas gotta fold with me
You just hating cause your bitch just fucked with me
Tell me how you feeling tell me how you feeling
Feeling like a boss
Tell me how you feeling tell me how you feeling
Feeling like a boss
[Repeat]

[Verse 1:]
Tell me how you feeling all these girls throwing pussy at me
Nigga wanna pop a Willie [pop a willie]
Baby girl get so wet like i'm watching free Willie
If you staying close to ma watch nigga you gon free with me
These niggas talking money probly never seen fifty
I'm geeked up trippy middle finger in the air hold up
Hold em for all snitches
Hundred thousand on the Vegas table make these bad bitches catch a cab
Cashing out [?] reckless cheques coming in do the math
I'm the shark nigga you the crab
You just playing I been in the trap I will talk never fold
I will talk always keep a strap counting money in jacuzzi
Bullets coming fas uzi she so wet so ohh we
Tell me how u feel

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Hop hop hop outington feeling like a million bucks baby
I'm out of it on a molly and a naked lady
Real nigga roster we looking for bricks in the trap like a blocker
No A&D ointment we tat his ass up with the chopper
Whip the cake Annie Mae I need another place to stay
Don't play me like a singer game I let them hot hollows hop away
I kill them when i'm stepping out fresh as a plastic couch
Look at how he grit his teeth he got molly mouth
Look at that boy feet foot cock James Brown
Tell me how you feel, shit I feel like Jordan
I be getting top in the top of the morning
Handicap rich retarded army
I came up on the block selling rock just to [?]
That's why I keep the Monkey Knots on me
How you feel dog I feel like 4 fans
How you feel dog like a made man
Tell me how you feeling
Fuck that Woop feel like 2 beans

[Chorus]
