[Chorus:]
The way the trap house rolling, I need a grammy
The way the trap house rolling, I need a grammy
No suite and tie, could be in [?], the green gats
The way the trap house rolling, I need a grammy
The way the trap house rolling

[Verse 1:]
I’m a nigga round table suites
Cooking up yeah we got truce
Straight salute, pistol on him know he gon shoot
New coop, Money ain’t nothing yo bitch ain’t nothing
I cook her the blow you know I ain’t bluffing
[Ha ha ] I’m taking your hoe and you know I ain’t cuffing
And if it ain’t gonna be then fuck your discussion
Get the bricks, split the bricks Banana split
Don’t trip, empty the whole clip
At yo lip, at yo hip and back to the trap house
The real [?] I need me a grammy
I bet I won’t miss out on the block lurking for customers
I bet I won’t miss out, in and out in and out
Get him in get him out, I need me a grammy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
What y’all know bout spot living slang yo sacks extra straps and a bag hidden
Hold hoes on the couch smoking  dice game going on in the back kitchen
Real short them i’m back tripping lights off we out fishing
Explored in the expedition bossing up for the best position
Suited and booted hotter than [?] I was recruited
[?] is booming 	bringing rose on them nice
I am the coolest long way from them ramen noodles
Wrong move will get your noodle ramen
Going hard all on that gram my IG got the coolest comments
Head bust for that shot vowed guy hands and I out styled him
Same clothes for three days
This can only go three ways
I win I win I win losing ain’t optional
I’m either gonna end up on the mother fucking Forbes
Or I’m sending somebody to the hospital

[Chorus]
