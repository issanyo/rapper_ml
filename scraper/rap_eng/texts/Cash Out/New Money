[Hook: Ca$h Out]

We grindin' out here, tryna get that new money
I'm doin' my thang, get you money
Feedin' all my niggas, that's that crew money

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]

A nigga cashed out, no I'm back again
Fuck a bitch, tell the ho run, get all your friends (Yeah!)
Nine times outta ten, I'm finna leave wit' a ten
Scooped up a chick named Nina, there's a Nina on my waist
No time to waste, never settle in with a good bitch
See me rolling in the 'Rari, niggas know I'm hood rich
Fiends limpin' up, gotta chop up a few bricks
She she me bust out the Maserati, no she wanna kick it like Karate
Party with the molly, now these niggas passin' out
I'm on they radar, now I'm smashin' out
All these niggas said I was done after Cashin' Out
Bags full'a scrilla, before I got the deal I got a milli
I ain't gotta say nothing, guarantee your girl leave with me
On one and I'm leanin, that's my country grammar, call me Nelly
Floyd Mayweather, front row seats
I'm feelin' like LeBron, don't make me bust this heat

[Hook: Ca$h Out]

We grindin' out here, tryna get that new money
I'm doin' my thang, get you money
Feedin' all my niggas, that's that crew money

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

Never let my net worth sit, born hustlers fiendin' fot that new money
Absolute power in a nigga horizion, comin' for the the Maloof money
You accidental murderers, a collective of tourists
Pay dues, my sniper'll put an end to your nuisance
Only time I been round C.O.'s was in the pen
Straight out the projects, thank the Lord for the pen
MasterMind my next project, niggas got one eye open
Fuck the fame, stress got my paranoid
These six figure syllables, fingerprints on a hundred mil'
A nigga's life the only unpaid debt, all my Miami niggas know how that feel
Coacine over the blue flame, better keep my eyes peeled
5 lP's drooped, still fuckin' with crime because crime pays
Ricky Ross, the Teflon Don, I'll never change my ways
Tical blunts, hoes get John Blazed
Living thanks to Reagan, no love for bitch niggas
Seein' my ambitions in front of my eyes, your clique cliche, all lies

[Hook: Ca$h Out]

We grindin' out here, tryna get that new money
I'm doin' my thang, get you money
Feedin' all my niggas, that's that crew money

[Outro: Ca$h Out]

Bad bitches, that's who I'm with
Sunroof, all the hoes love that shit
What a nigga gon' cop next?
Killin' all the competition, Ca$h winnin' every contest
