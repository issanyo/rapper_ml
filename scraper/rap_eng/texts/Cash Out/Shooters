[Intro: Ca$h Out]
Yo, man
Them niggas goofy, man
Let them know what a real killer is, nigga

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
My shooters are shooters, your niggas is goofy
Your shooters ain't shooters, them niggas is groupies
Catch me in the spot with choppers and counters
If you is a shooter, then this is your anthem
We're shooting shit, we're shooting shit up
We're shooting shit up, we're shooting shit up
My shooters are shooters, your niggas is goofy
Your shooters ain't shooters, them niggas is groupies

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
I done been shot at, I done shot at niggas
Still allowed to how pull the trigger
Gotta get you before you get me
MC Hammer, touch that nigga
Pussy niggas, they be pillow talking
While I'm in a pirate boat
Shooters ain't got no Instagram
Nigga, keep that on the low
Waiting on that phone call
Bullets rain on all y'all
Connected with the big dogs
Y'all niggas small dogs
Niggas know I'm super cool
In the trap house, eating wings and seafood
A lot of snakes in this game
You pussy niggas should've played by the rules
Last show money, spent it on pistols
Could've bought a missle
Give his ass the whole magazine
Nigga, pick an issue
All my killers, yeah, they so official
With a referree shirt
A lot of niggas playing with my money
Put his face on the shirt

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
My shooters are shooters, your niggas is goofy
Your shooters ain't shooters, them niggas is groupies
Catch me in the spot with choppers and counters
If you is a shooter, then this is your anthem
We're shooting shit, we're shooting shit up
We're shooting shit up, we're shooting shit up
My shooters are shooters, your niggas is goofy
Your shooters ain't shooters, them niggas is groupies

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Fuck a shooter, I'm a shooter myself
Mike Larry, Bad Boy, Will Smith
I swim with the sharks like I'm Michael Phelps
I keep the Glock 40 tightening up my belt
Me and Ca$h Out, we just cashed out on the shelf
Call the ambulance, he gon' need some help
Pull up in the Bentley, shooting through the roof
Pull up in the hood, recruiting the shooters
Hundred thousand spent on Uzis and Rugers
Big dog? Nigga, you is a coochie
I might switch it up and jump in the poochie
Instagram with your bitch in the Jacuzzi
Savage life, Webbie, Badazz Lil Boosie
Feeling like Doughboy, packed with [?]
The hood ain't talking 'bout no movie
Me and Diego done blowed the movie
Austin Powers, my shooters get groovy
Funny monkey niggas really amuse me
I got a plug in Cuba, really exclusive
I feel like Tom Cruise when they come on a cruise ship
Young nigga from Candler Road pull up in suit shit
Got MONY POWR RSPT, give a fuck who you is
Or where you from or what you claim
I trap Obama, you're like Saddam Hussein

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
My shooters are shooters, your niggas is goofy
Your shooters ain't shooters, them niggas is groupies
Catch me in the spot with choppers and counters
If you is a shooter, then this is your anthem
We're shooting shit, we're shooting shit up
We're shooting shit up, we're shooting shit up
My shooters are shooters, your niggas is goofy
Your shooters ain't shooters, them niggas is groupies

[Verse 3: Diego Dose]
Dropped some rubber bands off on your head
MPR pull up on you like Taliban
33 shots in Balmain pants
Larry Bird, hit your ass from long range
I'ma buss it, no discussion, hopping out the bucket
Aiming at your bucket hat
Ándale, ándale, bombs over Baghdad
Put your hood under attack
Thirty Smith & Wessons, choppers and Uzis
Squad full of shooters, they dying to use them
All in your residence, leaving no evidence
DMX, get on that Belly shit
We just some gangsta with felonies
How you a shooter, ain't killing shit?
New Designer, new artillery
Deuce deuce pocket rocker, Emmitt Smith

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
My shooters are shooters, your niggas is goofy
Your shooters ain't shooters, them niggas is groupies
Catch me in the spot with choppers and counters
If you is a shooter, then this is your anthem
We're shooting shit, we're shooting shit up
We're shooting shit up, we're shooting shit up
My shooters are shooters, your niggas is goofy
Your shooters ain't shooters, them niggas is groupies
