Blue hunnid (x5), we ball. (Eh) (Eh)

[Verse 1:]
I just came from overseas
Got on my plane, picked up them keys
You know that i'm ridin' wit shootas
You better not play, they will do ya
Pack and seal, pack and seal
Rapper, big rapper deal
Now give me my money, I love them blue hunnids
She comin' over here, I heard she a cumma
Bitch you need to come see my bed
My pants got the drummas
Boy you know yo bitch a fan, I could tell by ya comments
I get to my commas, I ride wit my llama

Yo bitch be bringin' me roses, while i'm drinkin' Belaire Ros√®
I'm a nigga drinkin' toasted, but you know we stayin' focused
