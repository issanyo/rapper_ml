[Chorus]
Shawty know my favorite position
[?] like to fuck in the kitchen
Lookin' at a young nigga I was cookin' and whippin'
When I turned it into rap, she said im a magician
Yeah she like the dopeboy
Yeah she like the dopeboy
Yeah she like the dopeboy
Yeah she like the dopeboy


[Verse 1: Cashout]

I love to play with them bricks
I love to play with them titties
She's [?]
Yeah I got the grits
36(x3) Tell me have you ever cooked the brick
Orange white and blue i got the Knicks
Couple months later I got the bricks
She just wanna dope boy
Gas slanging out my pocket oh boy
She knows in my clique we let em go boy
And she like a dope boy let it go boy
Wrap lookin good yeah I know
Still got a plug Pablo
Whats my favorite weather? The snow
Whats my favorite movie? Blow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]

Baby love a dope boy
I be water whippin' on the stove boy
I let my trap queen bring the movies in
Zoovier, im the Zoovy man
I keep alot of bands in my pocket
Robin Jeans wanna take off
23's on like im Mike
Im balling like the playoffs
She said she love a dope boy
Dope mans off a 22nd
Black beamer drop 17
Pull up boy then all flexin
She say she love a dope boy
Know that imma go boy gotta get the dough now baby
Money doesn't play now, run up where you stay now, gotta hit the safe now baby

[Chorus]
