[Hook 1: Akon]
Money to blow so I'm ridin 'round with that Nina (ride 'round with that Nina)
With a Hollywood ho with lips like Angelina (lips like Angelina)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya? (how can I meet ya?)
G flyer then sky how high, oh I can see her (oh I can see her)
Got an island on my wrist, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
Got an island on my neck, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya?
G flyer then sky how high, oh I can see her

[Akon:]
I got t-pain around my wrist, Gaga around my neck
Got o' money so long, I ain't movin' cash in them checks
I keep wide 3's on my feet, still ridin' 'round with that heat
Foreign cars in my garage, all these bad bitches I beat
Oops! Is that your girl? She said her name was Nina
Oops! Ridin' 'round, gettin' head from a girl named Nina
Oops! I'm sorry, but I'm on my Ike and Tina (Ike and Tina)
I'm African so you know I got hyenas
I cashed out on my whips, I cashed out from my check
Though I ? TV again, got that stations all in my bed
Got a indoor court, outdoor court
Indoor pool, outdoor pool
I ain't lyin', nigga tell it's true
Ask Ray he done be there too

[Verse 2 Cash Out]
Ok, I drop the top, hop in
Hoes they coming by flocks in
Birds they coming by flocks in
Pass them birds like Stockton
Play with my money I'm popping
No acting, but it's a movie
Got Spinz on the beat so we ain't losing
Don't act like your ho ain't choosin
I done blowed up, yeah I'm the bomb
Riding round blowing on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms
Top floor suite chilling at the Palms
We want the whole loaf leave y'all the crumbs
Til then I'm running my check up
And it's fuck a Bugatti I'm calling my jet up

[Hook]
Cool
36 O's ho riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me they say hi can I meet you
She fly high, high in the sky, ho I can't see you
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out
36 O's so I'm riding round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me they say hi can I meet you

[Verse 3 Cash Out]
It's big pimping over here... Church
Time to cop the Maybach already had the vert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumping out the kitchen
And I'm on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and gon' and watch me
And you can skate on my ice just like you playing hockey
And in the booth I beat the beat up, call me Rocky
Yeah I'm cocky
