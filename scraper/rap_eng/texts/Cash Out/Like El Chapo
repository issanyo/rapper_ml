(Hook)
I got vato's break it down like El Chapo
I might go to Mexico like El Chapo
I be off the kush smell like El Chapo
They be trying to catch me like El Chapo
El Chapo x 6

(Verse)
My vatos dancing with army hammer like MC hammer
Cruisin' in their black and white ghost yeah
That’s Danny Phantom
I’m smoking like chimney, I'm feeling like santa
My girl she’s so bad, I swear they cannot stand up
Your girl she’s so thirsty, remind me your camo
She catching feelings
Don’t express em like panda
Migo gettin’ rich like I’m landing
Flyin' to Turkey
Talking by goble, goble goble
And my vato got the birds singing  just like a high note
Gettin’ head, sleeping hallow
Getting money that a model
Head Honcho like i'm pancho
If you go to Mexico better watch out for the Narcos
I ain’t fucking with you clowns, fuck around McDonalds
Do you get serve every day just like McDonalds
Foreign bitch, think she Brazilian, This one is really in
Private island, Gilligan
Gotta give a try, know im trying to stack a trillion
Southside where my city in and fuck all your opinion
________(?)
Plus i brought the Henny in, my vato brought the pelicans
The Nike foamposites, you know I brought the pennies in
Hit the condo, I call it The condominium
Running from police in my Timberlands

(Hook)

(Verse)
Can’t you hear a nigga hush, then you gotta get a verse
Kap G hit a nigga up say he gotta get a verse on the G shit
Pearl cocaine in this bitch so we might as well start selling remix
All these damn hunnids in here so you know i had to find this shoe box
Boy you can’t fool me with that blow
But you know that we the real rock
(I’mma dope boy nigga)
Hunnids on rubber bands
I’m spinning the blow up
I’m putting to fuck it and I’m making it blow up
Jump, though jump though, call it The Jump man
Dough man, got the pump call him the pump man
Boy you must be tripping, get that shit out the trunk man
Vacum to the mug, nigga you be the tail man
Boy you know that OG can’t come throw the mil man
Keep it real player, yeah I'm tippin the mail man
Keep switching numbers, cuz these niggas will tell man
And been playing with the words so I dont need a scare man
Stack roll fold cuz you might need a bail man
Started with a pound and now they call me the bail man
Dog time, I’m in the bowl, try to make the old big jump
But it came that straight glass shit
So you know the trap drops

(Hook)
