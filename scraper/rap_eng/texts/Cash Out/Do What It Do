[Intro:]
You know what
Ima make it do what it do baby
Thanks for love it
Never gonna be a nigga
I [?] in the kitchen nigga
I'm in the kitchen

[Chorus:]
Hey I make it do what it do
Hey I make it do what it do
Get ridin got with that chop
Can't tell me nothing
Hey I make it do what it do in the kitchen
I'm water whippin I got the chicken
Hey I make it do what it do
Hey she make it do what it do
Hey I make it do what it do
I get mine, ridin with the chopper
Can't tell me nothing

[Verse 1:]
Hold up nigga this ain't no swag rap, this that trap rap
Ridin round with the chopper get kidnapped
100LBs in the duffle come fuck with us
Stack ma chips up ruffles you know what's up
Flat screens in the bando for lil elmo
In the kitchen whippin up a fricki
Rolie on ma wrist it [?[ cost a ticket
Bitches lick it right before I stick it
Niggas try to hate but try to kick it
Nigga can't get with it
Gunning with that pack unless you vacuum seal it
They way I spit that trap shit hood niggas gon feel it
Put it in ma face man you know I'm gon deal it
Enomic on the beat and you know I'm gon kill it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
They cooking shit I love it
Put that soda with the work I make it bubbly
I just left the courthouse beat a gun case
Had to hit ma nigga up from that old base
Ram that sack up trap up then I wrap up
Nigga mad cause I had her you can have her
But she fucking with a real nigga
Took that steel nigga I was in the kitchen [scerp, scerp]
Water whipping on top the trap shit you gotta believe me
Ran up a cheque man this shit wasn't easy
Few bumps in the road latches in the boat niggas fold
New phone every three day that's the new code

[Chorus]
