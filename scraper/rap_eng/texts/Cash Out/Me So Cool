[Intro]

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
Aye!
Thirty-six O's wrapped up
Vacuum seal them brickies.(I wrap the bricks up)
Play wit' money, deal with consequences
We gone kill lil' Ricky
Half a brick worth of cash man
Came wit' all my britches (Got bricks in that car)
Her last nigga was a lame man
Gotta mold my bitches (I mold my bitches up)
I-I ride with extensions (I ride with the clip)
I smoke on extensions (I smoke on the long way)
I don't ride the benches (I don't ride the wood)
I'm up in the trenches (I'm up in the skrr skrr skrrr)

On or off the court, (on or off the court)

Nothing's free-man, (nothing's free man)
But it's Morgans in my coupe (you see her)
Go enormous when I swoop (enormous when I swoop)
Gas it 'til it poot (Skrrrtttt!)

Fuck it! Gone fill the block wit' the pressure
Eighty thou on a compressor
Nigga try, I apply pressure
And my daddy had white chicks for under seventeen like a Chester (He was workin' & workin')
He whip it and whip it
Then smash on the block like a pedal (Now he servin', he servin')
J's at the door like "He finished yet?"
