[Chorus:]
Where ya trap at nigga where ya trap at
Where ya trap at where ya where ya trap at
Where ya trap at nigga where ya trap at
An I just left the trap house full of Ammo
Bricks all on the table I’m whippin the brick up
Ay Where ya trap at nigga where ya trap at
Where ya trap at nigga where ya trap at

[Verse 1:]
I ain’t go lie I started from 4 grams but I whip the full weight
Trading in the full weight plus I don’t make cold case
And what’s the use of shooting if it ain’t the face
And if a trap pull up you know we gonna race
You sleeping on back out tryna get this pack out
Tired of the corner gotta get a trap house
And all ma trap niggas they gotta feel this
They say the way that I talk man i’m gon be serious
Money stacked up real good tell myself it’s about time
You better put that sack up for dry time
Don’t get it twisted nigga i’m about mine
And don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time
Where ya trap at nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Back in the days couldn’t watch no grammys
I was having grammies from ma mami
Nigga talking bout riding you know we handling
Shoot out with other niggas understand me
Man you could picture my life this ain’t a movie
Man I just bad bitches in them Jacuzzis
I remember hard days looking for razor blades
Everybody want glass screaming 88
Man a nigga had it hard with a baby face
A youngin still gunning
Dope dealers got my back so who’s fronting
Talking bout what you sold to rappers in a boat

[Chorus]
