[Verse 1]
I don't like wasting my time
I know i'm young but i can do better with mine
Cuz i just want it to make sense fo me, don't have me giving all of me
When you know
You ain't tryin to do the right thing (ooohhh)
Cuz i just wanted to be for you (for you) (ooohhhh)
But you just wasn't for me, baby (ooohhh)
And you gave me every good reason in the world (ooohhhoo), to leave you alone

[Chorus]
Such a shady girl (shady girl)
Used to love everything about you till you change my world (change my world)
Thought i had a dime, you would have lost your mind your a crazy girl (crazy girl)
Don't expect much
Gotta respect my crazy girl (crazy girl)
Shady girl

[Verse 2]
See i can't keep asking you why
Seems to me that you've just made up your mind
Hopefully one day you see that life ain't just fun and games and maybe
Gotta try to love some, love somebody else (ooohhh)
I just try to be for you (ooohhh)
But you just wasn't for me (babe) (ooohhh)
I just try to be there for you (ooohhh)
But you left me so cold

[Chorus]
Such a shady girl (shady girl)
Used to love everything about you till you changed my world (my world)
Thought i had a dime, you would have lost your mind your a crazy girl (crazy girl)
Don't expect much
Gotta respect my crazy girl (crazy girl)
Shady girl

(Somebody let me know)

[Bridge]
Someone tell me
Tell me why we (why we)
Always fighting (always fighting)
And disrespecting (disrespecting)
Thought i knew you (thought i knew you)
Now i see you (now i see)
For all that your worth
Your a shady shady girl

[Chorus x2]
(lets go) Such a shady girl (thats right)
Used to love everything about you till you change my world (un hun)
Thought i had a dime, you would have lost your mind your a crazy girl
Don't expect much
Gotta respect my crazy girl
Shady girl
