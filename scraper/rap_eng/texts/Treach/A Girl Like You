[Intro: Treach & Aaliyah]
I'm looking for a girl like you
Well here I go

[Verse 1: Treach]
Now, now, now, who's the baby bobbing
Dipping, dodging, crying, sobbing
Looking to be mobbing cause it's just clocking and robbing
Oh hi now, welcome to my town
The illy I town, you got kids lifting eyebrows
Everytime you fly down, so lie down
Full maxing, seeing you laughing
With passion happening
Every action has a reaction
In fact you got my mackin' cracking
I heard your lackin' satisfaction from your other half
And honey you're packing from the back
And the captain makes it happen
Pardon what's the matter
He gots you shattered
Or that's your man that's scattered
That backward bastard
You fine thang thang
Look at me good and when that game ain't true
You make me wanna go, ooh (wooh)
Like tang clan man
Known for my slang bang
Donâ€™t be alarmed when my fangs hang
My love like bang bang, then I maintain
I need a diva like Aaliyah
Plush like a cleaner, 850 Beemer
Hot to let me bake her like Anita

[Hook: Aaliyah & Treach]
I'm looking for a girl like you
Well here I go
I hope, I hope to me you won't lie too
Well tell me more, I'm looking for a guy like you
Yeah you know me, I hope, hope
I hope you feel it in your knees
Oh yes indeed
I'm looking for a girl like you
Well here I go
I hope, I hope to me you won't lie too
Well tell me more, I'm looking for a guy like you
Yeah you know me, I hope, hope
I hope you feel it in your knees
Oh yes indeed

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
When I first saw you
That's when I knew, I really knew
I wanted to get close to you
I'm watching, clocking you
I just spend my days, wondering when I will see your face
Boy, I just wanna see your face and hear you say

[Hook: Aaliyah & Treach]
I'm looking for a girl like you
Well here I go
I hope, I hope to me you won't lie too
Well tell me more, I'm looking for a guy like you
Yeah you know me, I hope, hope
I hope you feel it in your knees
Oh yes indeed
I'm looking for a girl like you
Well here I go
I hope, I hope to me you won't lie too
Well tell me more, I'm looking for a guy like you
Yeah you know me, I hope, hope
I hope you feel it in your knees
Oh yes indeed

[Bridge 1: Aaliyah]
Dada dah dah
Dada dah, dada dah dah
Uhnda dah
Dada dah dah
Dada dah, dada dah dah
Uhnda dah

[Verse 3: Aaliyah & Treach]
It would not be too hard
If you want my heart, just say you love me
I'm loving every inch
No one in the world could tear us a part
I'll be your lady
Well can I have a pinch?
So what you say
What do I say?
Baby, tell me what's your name
Treach, you wanna play?
Play it'll be okay
Guaranteed A-ok
Let me take you to my home

[Hook: Aaliyah & Treach]
I'm looking for a girl like you
Well here I go
I hope, I hope to me you won't lie too
Well tell me more, I'm looking for a guy like you
Yeah you know me, I hope, hope
I hope you feel it in your knees
Oh yes indeed
I'm looking for a girl like you
Well here I go
I hope, I hope to me you won't lie too
Well tell me more, I'm looking for a guy like you
Yeah you know me, I hope, hope
I hope you feel it in your knees
Oh yes indeed

[Bridge 2: Aaliyah & Treach]
Oh baby I could touch ya
Dada dah dah
You kiss me right
Dada dah
Be your lover undercover, get a woman wet
Dada dah, I wanna get to know a little more about you

[Pre-Hook: Aaliyah & Treach]
And then you smile
And then what follows?
Our love is pouring down
Like there ain't no tomorrow
Baby can we talk
My heart ain't hollow
About us
Melts in my mouth but that ain't all though
And then you smile
And then what follows?
Our love is pouring down
Like there ain't no tomorrow
Baby can we talk
My heart ain't hollow
About us
Melts in my mouth but that ain't all though
