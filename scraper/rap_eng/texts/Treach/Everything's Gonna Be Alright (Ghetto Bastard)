[Skit]
Doctor: Nurse Johnson, is the mother still in the recovery room?
Nurse: Yes, Dr. Blair
Doctor: OK, I'll go to the waiting room and inform the father it's a boy
Nurse: I'm afraid there is no father, sir
Doctor: Another ghetto bastard, huh?
Nurse: I'm afraid so
Doctor: Well, put him with the rest of the born losers
Nurse: All right doctor, a shame isn't it?
Doctor: Not a shame, a problem

[Intro]
Smooth it out
This is a story about the drifter
Who waited for the worst, cause the best lived 'cross town
Who never planned on having so didn't
Why me, huh

[Hook]
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

[Verse 1: Treach]
Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, motherfuck the fag
Well anyway, I did pick ups, lift and click-ups
Too many stick-ups, cause niggas had the trigger hiccups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip with just a clip, who wanna hit
They got 'em quick, I had to eat, this money's good as spent
A 'do in braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the lead to any telling crackhead
I'd still'a been broke, so a lot of good it woulda did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none
Why did I have to live a life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played I was a sad one
And always wanted to live like this or that one

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Treach]
A ghetto bastard, born next to the projects
Living in the slums with bums, I said, "now why, Treach"
"Do it have to be like this"
Momma said I'm priceless
So I am all worthless, starved, and it's just what being nice gets
Sometimes I wish I could afford a pistol then, though
To stop the hell, I would've ended things a while ago
I ain't have jack but a black hat and knapsack
War scars, stolen cars, and a blackjack
Drop that, and now you want me to rap and give?
Say something positive?
Well positive ain't where I live
I live right around the corner from West Hell
Two blocks from South Shit and once in a jail cell
The sun never shone on my side of the street, see
And only once or twice a week I would speak
I walked alone, my state of mind was home sweet home
I couldn't keep a girl, they wanted kids with cars and chrome
Some life, if you ain't wear gold your style was old
And you got more juice and dough for every bottle sold
Hell no, I say there's gotta be a better way
But hey, never gamble in a game that you can't play
I'm slowin' and flowin' and going in on and knowing not now
How will I do it, how will I make it
I won't, that's how
Why me, huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Treach]
My third year into adulthood, and still a knucklehead
I'm better off dead huh, that's what my neighbor said
I don't do jack but fighting, lightin' up the streets at night
Playing hide-and-seek with a machete sexing Freddy's wife
Some say I'm rolling on, nothing but a dog now
I answer that with a "fuck you" and a bow-wow
Cause I done been through more shit within the last week
Than a fly flowing in doo-doo on the concrete
I been a deadbeat, dead to the world and dead wrong
Since I was born that's my life, oh you don't know this song
So don't say jack, and please don't say you understand
All that man-to-man talk can walk, damn
If you ain't live it, you couldn't feel it, so kill it skillet
And all that talk about it won't help it out, now will it?
In Illtown, pure luck got stuck-up, props got shot
Don't worry got hit by a flurry, and his punk-ass dropped
But I'm the one who has been labeled as an outcast
They teach in schools, I'm the misfit y'all will outlast
But that's cool with the fool, smack 'em backwards
That's what you get for fucking with a ghetto bastard

[Outro]
If you ain't ever been to the ghetto
Don't ever come to the ghetto
Cause you wouldn't understand the ghetto
And stay the fuck out of the ghetto
Why me (alright)
