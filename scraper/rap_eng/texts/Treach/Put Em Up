[Verse:]
I saw this guy 6 foot 3, talking on his cellie, looking at me, I liked his vibe, the magnul
Eyes, (oh yea, mmm mmm) across the room, the way he moved, looking all hot in them timbaland boots
I liked the things, the things he do, (oh yea, mmm mmm)

[Hook:]
You know it's time for dancing, tonight if you wanna take a chance and, my single ladies need some
Attention, I wanna see the fellas make a move, throw it up, give it up don't stop

[Chorus:]
(put em up) if you got money in the bank and your own credit cards and a drop to sit in
(let me see you put em up) if you got a clip on your cash when you go to the club and you get in 4 free
Then (let me see you put em up, put em up 4 me) if you makin money with class and you win a booket
And you know how to treat em (let me see you put em up) maybe we can go away ride in my escalade
Until that saturday

[Verse 2:]

Communication, and I really like the way your thoughts shine, (oh why, oh why)
