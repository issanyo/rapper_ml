[Intro: Quran]
Aftermath...

[Verse 1: Tariq]
Peep the weak, greet the beast with cheap sticks & feet sweeps
I hated gas, but I freak, cause I got beef with white sheets
I'm leaving school styles lumpy, plus I won't break the humpty dumpty but I keep the hoochie coochies coming
I hear a honeycomb hideout, slide's out
So honies you can come where all the hair hides out
I pray for the chump that bumps me or plays me like a punk
So jump, jump if you want me

[Bridge: Treach]
It's another number one, Da funky Youngstas
It's another number one, Da funky Youngstas
It's another number one, Da funky Youngstas
Cause we go flip, flap, flip, flap, fast or slow

[Verse 2: Taji]
In front me, jump me like that
Ain't funky was for a fact
Pick the stick, I'm the camel with four backs
But you can't break the back,it's a strong cow
Plus I bet you didn't know that yo, we drinking milk now

[Verse 3: Quran]
Walk the walk, talk the talk, chalk I stalk
Like a hawk, when I break your whole walk, when your foot gets caught

[Verse 4: Taji]
Cause we ain't rip the bull shot
Hit you with the full shot
Booyakas heard when we pull props

[Verse 5: Quran]
Who's hot, bring what's hip-hop, I say
Ain't no flowing ho-hooray
Cause we can get done

[Verse 6: Taji]
Here's another from Da Youngstas
The mother number funky substance
Straight from illy Philly funkstas

[Hook: Da Youngstas]
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop

[Verse 7: Tarik]
On a deal with it
Only if you want the rough, the whole funk
The stuff, with the trunk if you can't freak the funky front
But don't fake the moves, shake the moves
Cause if ain't paid your dues, then my neighbor crew'll spray your crew

[Verse 8: Quran]
And I ain't even saving you
I be a part of the slaughter that makes it harder for your squad to move
Now what the hell you trying to prove
You bore me, till my styles'll have your DJ dancing for me
Glory, halleluah
My style'll do ya
And we run through ya like we ain't knew ya

[Verse 9: Taji]
Da Youngsta will pump ya
Funkin & dump in your dreads, the styles of lead from the headhunter
8, 12 and 20 bars, I'm fully on the money pile
Mic styles charge cause I pull their card
And we can kick the flow for the young bros
The short bros, home bros, that's looking for the old gold
A lotta rhymes, I never mind, that was kind
It was cool, but now they sound fool, so I say never mind
You'll always stay a style behind my rhyme
And you're getting dropped
When the crewz pops to the hip hop

[Hook: Da Youngstas]
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
