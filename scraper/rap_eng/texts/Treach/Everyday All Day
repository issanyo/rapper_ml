[Verse 1: Treach]
This is somethin that I call a flow
Not many if any, except for Vinnie, can say they know
In fact, the track is that is something that I rarely show
Because my tongue is actually fast but then again it's slow
See yo (Throw it bro)
You say "Jiggaboo", a name pertained for niggas who WHO
Who hear that name and place a trigger to the figure who
It blew through and if ya try ta rip, I throw a bigger blue shoe to you
And if you take the shoe, a nigga dagger will do, ooh
Treach is the best of the rest but if they try to diss it
We'll just say, "Nigga, take a whiff, we'll see who want to be Naughty or nicest"
Like Isis, I'm priceless, plug the mic to it
Come with the D with the I with the S to the S's, see who's hypest
Test the test the Treach to Treach address the address:
How I'll bless and blow any conflicts
While they try to clone my style, it's just nonsense
"M-my ni-ni-nigga m-m-mackin" is all you get out of it
Any and all should fall, many is small should call
Naughty By Nature the greater of all y'all
Show hope, show no hope and can't cope, so no way
This is how we play everyday all day

[Verse 2: Treach]
Havin a rather cadaver gather matters is drastically
Never say never whenever whether we come on after thee
Kay and the Gee the producer, me is loose off the claps ya see
That keeps you boogie'n happily
Voice ya opinion, it's the rhythm I'm lendin
The message I'm sendin from London to Linden
Girls are given a chance to get ya all pampered
Leaving more cramps in your pants then a bellydancer
God is good and if ya would, you should just
Play to the way I see em, play all day is what He'll bless
I'm leavin em evil and seein em bein a torture with dull props
I won't give up til you had 'nough of these skull shots
Now let the hard floor break your fall, darlin'
Cos on the strength, the Naughty Nature ain't waltzin
When we dance we come full-thrust, the bum rush
Knockin and poppin em up inside, they rockin dawn til dusk
I ain't the type to get sooped or psyched
I feel I'm better than ever before but as a rapper I'm just alright
Showin time is for clocks not hip-hoppers
Pop pop ya try to shine I make your heart work proper
And that's comin from the drifter and if ya
R-U-N ya L-I-P, you will B-E G-O-N-E
So let the just gettin' by songs, be by-gones
Nevertheless it's definitely hits and hits are what we strive on
We feel this way every single day all day
So make way

[Verse 3: Treach]
Wuz up to all you MC cub scouts
Grub scouts gettin rubbed out
I'll bet'cha kept ya album froze til this came out
Gettin' ideas to use, a half of snare or two
Snatchin and maxin a rap that I'm castin, how dare you!
How the hell can you yell what someone else said?
I must got, "I wanna loan what I own" on my forehead! Huh
But I doubt that, and now ya wanna back out
Your career had more ins and outs than a crack house
I'm mackin 'n rackin 'n cappin the acts and I wax em wit-wit a smack
Ya scare me as much as Mcgruff with a whiffle bat
And that's simply elementary, Watson.
So pack ya track and do 5-flat in your Datsun.
Now let my canine backtrack the copy-cat
Your night life is up. So, what you happy you got a soundtrack?
Well, so will seven thousand other rappers, groovy
The cuts ya made for that movie ain't soothe me
Who said that Treach can't work when he don't curse?
I'm nasty, ask me, naughty and nappy but happy
I'm all that and never go out the small way
You need a lift? We go this way everyday all day

[Verse 4: Treach]
Your little tape got more blank spots than a tank-top, think, stop
You oughta store it all, fast-forward 'fore I ring props
You sorry sideshow, immature rhyme ho
Come rock a lil somethin, no we're all outta time so
From Chilltown JC to Brooklyn with A-D
I'm rippin things daily, no if, ands, or maybes
The F-L and the A-V the O-R B-A-by,
Chris, the Jungle Brothers, Tribe Called Quest, yeah they be
Down with Sha-K-I-M, him, a man that's swifter than
Then the ruler, Lord Ramsey, comes handy on the road again
Mark the 45, kizz-nils, fills the reels
With the real chill, not the run-of-the-mill deals
Get poopoo dooie, producer Louie Louie
Throw a dance track to me to me
So that sometimes they do me
I can't forget the De La the Soul and Native Tongue, patrol
A strong "What up?" to the brothers from the Nature, yo!
We got the catchy Apache, the rocking Lakim
The never sloppy Latee, don't even try to outrhyme them
The stable not cocky, Lord Alibaski and Chill Rob G
There's trouble day with Double J, there's no probs, see
We also got the speaker Latifah, the Queen of the Flavor
And nuthin weaker behind is Swatch & Kika
The Digital Under-the-Underground, rocks with Shock and 2Pac
With Money B, Humpty and Jimmy, the master of the chops
And on the tip with several brothers, we must gets
It's Tahid, Akeem, Cracker C and Cee Justice
Plus it's the voice behind the Flavor Unit, on time or early
It's our girlie, head of the headquarters, Shirley
And we'll put last but not least, Camille
I feel you learned the way we come this deep everyday all day

[Outro: Treach]
Y'know what I'm sayin?
We got the newest member of the Flavor Unit, Def Jef, in effect
We got the producer of this track, Kay-Gee
We got my girl Nikki D in the house
My man, engineer all star Dave
My man on the sax, Andy
We got another engineer, Angie, and assistant Todd
We got Anj-Du, G-Quick
We got the whole entire 18th Street Posse: Rasheem, Mook Daddy
Skee Steve Hammer, Howie Cru-Ru, M-Dee, Tak Diesel, Na-Na
We got my girl Aphrodite and her posse in the house: Cherokee, Topin, and
Lisa
And we outta here like last year
Cos we come this deep everyday all day
PEACE!
