[Intro: Michael ad-libs]
Aahh...
Hoo...
Aahh...
Hoo..hee...
Aahh...
Hoo..

[Verse 1]
[Michael Jackson]
Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Life is disgustin'
So what does it mean, damnit
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit
Hee…ahh…hoo hoo

[Janet Jackson]
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael & Janet]
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

[Verse 2]
[Michael + (Janet)]
Tired of your tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (The story your way)
It's causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damnit

[Janet]
Keep changin' the rules
While you're playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
Schemin', baby
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
Oh Father, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael & Janet]
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop fuckin' with me
Make me wanna scream

[Interlude: Janet:]
Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice

[Rap: Treach]
Now who’s deceivin’ ya to believe in a
Monotonous fever mainstream mumble the media made up
Keeping a shadow on people, the slaves of the day
Deceived and believed that we’re equal to rights
Peep and getting even
And even when breathing, we can’t inhale freedom
Save the playa haters for later, it’s demons I’m weaving
We’re needing a scheme, it’s making me feel like screaming

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael & Janet]
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop fuckin’ with me
Just stop fuckin’ with me
Stop fuckin’ with me
Make me wanna scream

Stop fuckin' with me
Just stop fuckin’ with me
Stop fuckin’ with me
Make me wanna scream
Stop fuckin' with me
Just stop fuckin' with me
Just stop fuckin’ with me
Make me wanna scream

Stop fuckin' with me
Just stop fuckin’ with me
Stop fuckin’ with me
Make me wanna scream
Stop fuckin' with me
Just stop fuckin' with me
Stop fuckin’ with me
Make me wanna scream
(Stop your pressure)
