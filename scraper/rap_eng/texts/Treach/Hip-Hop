[Verse 1]
I came from drop tops and old school Chevy's
Dope boys rollin' through, shittin' on ya heavy
Fifteens in the trunk, beatin' down your block
Only 4 years old when Biggie got shot
I remember playin' on the block, hangin' on the block
Young niggas slangin' on the block, gettin' off them rocks
Now we livin' better now, Coogi sweater now
Weather still gettin' colder, we could change the weather now, but I

[Pre-Hook]
Came up in criminal days
Livin' these criminal ways, what can I say?
Huggin' the block every day
Grindin' and making a way
At night I pray for better days
That it don't be the same tomorrow
Now I celebrate my sorrows with this bottle
And say

[Hook]
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)

[Verse 2]
Everyday ain’t good but everyday ain’t bad
Mama always said, "Show thanks for what you have
Boy, never forget to realize you're blessed
This cold world can rot you if you let it"
Now I'm outchea tryna get it, really outchea tryna get it
Always knew that I would make it, maybe it was so prophetic
'Cause I came up from the bottom and the humblest beginnings
From the youngest nigga grindin' to the youngest nigga winnin'

[Pre-Hook]
Still I came up in criminal days
Livin' these criminal ways, what can I say?
Huggin' the block every day
Grindin' and making a way
At night I pray for better days
That it don't be the same tomorrow
Now I celebrate my sorrows with this bottle
And say

[Hook]
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change

[Verse 3]
'Fore you die, you make your mark and reach new levels
Want the bread, want the diamonds and the bezels
And if it's bitches that you want, have several
Just gotta know, lotta shit's temporary
It won't last, no, no, it won't last, no
One minute it's all here, next thing you know it's all gone
That's why I been on my grizzy outchea
Long as I grind, better days are near

[Pre-Hook]
Came up in criminal days
Livin' these criminal ways, what can I say?

Grindin' and making a way
At night I pray for better days

And say
