Intro (Bunny Wailer)
Hear this Three monkeys sitting under a coconut tree (really?)
Discussing things as they are said to be
Said one to the others, now listen you two
There’s a strange rumor that can’t be true
They say man was descended from our noble race
But the very idea is a big disgrace
No monkey ever deserted his wife
Or her baby, to ruin their lives
Yeah The monkeys drift is mine (that’s right)

Chorus (Damian Marley)
Well educated fools they have ruined di world
And start make it hard for both di boys and di girls
Dem steal all di Africans diamonds and pearls
And start bank it up inna federal reserves
And then Rasta fuck it up and insight riot
Warn dem fi cool and we did warn dem fi quiet
Now dem hear the kick drum di snare and di hi hat
Load up dem belly with some copper shot diet

Verse (Damian Marley)
Imagine after so much chanting and prayers
But a revolutionary situation requires
Mi fi come tear off unno face wid pliers
Surround dem ends wid all some burning tires
Round up dem friends and put dem pon trials
Until dem send di reparation dollars
Warning to all di political scholars political thieves and political liars
Political cocaine and gun suppliers
Di whole a dem a go down inna flames and fires
Well unno better fly out like some frequent fliers
Bound to feel the wrath of di real Bongonyahs
Hey don't fuck yourself next time you read out di budget
Di government case, ah poor people a judge it
Dem bring di guns but di youths dem ah bust it
Bun dem skeletons weh lock up inna closet
Wipe out dem species and all dem inhabits
With a warm series of pain and havoc
Nah clean no feces fi money prefer grab it
Dem mek mi resort to violence di race get lead up
Somebody nah live up
Somebody goin dead up BLOW!!
Whole ah di garment dem red up BLOW!!
Car and apartment get bled up
Didn't you get ample warning say poor people fed up
And still every morning
Dem try hold dem head up
Emperor Selassie calling
Youths dem fi dread up
Babylon is fallen
Gun nozzle bend up
Releasing di whole of di youth dem weh pen up
(Chorus)

Verse (Bounty Killer)
Check it now
Junior Gong a junior bong
Done beat up Babylon and Vatican
Mi nuh come here fi praise up no pagan
Mi nuh come here fi big up no batty man
See dem a come, move, throw Satan
Forgot all about di ? weapon
Tell 'em say that dem lead ?
Poor people across the world this is a special dedication
???Check di starifacation, Yo
(Chorus)
(Damian Marley)
Well educated fools
Educated demons
And educated goons
Educated mules
Educated fools
Educated demons
And educated goons
Verse (Bounty Killer)
???
All dem shady people dem nasty and sour
This is war last time me as block lower
Cause I represent black power
Well, Almighty God inna da statue a tower
Long time me go some more dey come to devour
???
Power and show A trick dem with dem rice and flour, ya know
Me respect Rasta-Fearians
Me respect church goer
Dem fi no say poor people
On a boat can’t no row a
Fire a flame me bring fi ya ya drug for ya
And anyone a go a dem fi know ya

Verse(Treach)
Well I heard that man came from sands and other molecules
Way before bodies and barbecues
With a good side a bad side and still argue too
Before schemin and thievin and dreamin of gleamin and feenin
Even before Adam and Eve and even
Before it was about being the nicest or whose diamonds that are priceless
B.C. around Tutankhamun and Isis
On the continent of Africa
Pass out and tribes to create a character
Sold us shit on earth was magical
Then the strangers came from the boat with the ropes
Chains that felt strange, they called it the slave game
The game changed
They had shackled like assholes
The Bloodclot
So nowadays the way we prevent it is a thugs Glock
Seen them rape and kill our children and women
The villain the bill gonna sort the black man how to kill men
Let’s keep it real man
You can’t harm me or scar me
Respect for me History’s priority with the Marleys
