[Verse 1: Treach]
Hey, you could smoke a spliff on a cliff
But there's still no mountain high enough, or wide enough to touch
The naughty nappy nasty nigga the nasty trashy ho happy pappy
That's happy to be nappy
Me and Vin rock when spots hit flocks
And groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I'm rollin' my hair-do don't
Win I will I got wantin' competition ain't dope
Beat ya break ya broke ya smoke ya take ya
Send you to your little group on mute, sooner or later
He wanna flip, tell em full semi half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty naughty hi bye greater than nature while I
Shin slam the flim flim and then jam
You can run but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are

[Hook x2]
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

[Verse 2: Treach, Vinnie]
Here we go yo
Hit a nigga, kill a nigga, we'll come back
See a sucker, stretch a sucker, guard your naps
Cussin' wasn't nothin' til a black man rapped
See a forty, suck a forty, guess who's back

You're chillin' with a titty feelin' villian
Steppin' to the puny puddy punks catchin' fillings
I hit so many guts, call me gutter, I'm the bread and butter
Punk motherfucker I'll cut up, workin' from the gut up
Brand new steady, heavy as a Chevy
Ready for the piddy peddy, I'm Friddie Freddie
Place your bet on a vet, the three man threat
What you see is what you get

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Treach]
Comin' round the corner with my uptown bunch
I bet your bottom dollar that you're bottom buck chumps
Give it up, it's a juice thing, I'm steppin' for the rep and
Wreckin' all the rest and, weapon testin' on who's steppin'
Ain't no bluff for the niggy nuff, for the rugged ruff stuff
Nigga if you're tough, knuckle up
I'll cut your ass like class, then blast you by the trash
After I laugh then I'll dash
You can't handle the scandal of an uptown vandal
Shootin' up your toes, makin' sandals
Somebody told me that you owe me, but can't nobody hold me
I do my dirt all by my lonely

[Hook x2]
