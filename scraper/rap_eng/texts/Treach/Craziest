Verse 1: Treach

My thoughts are thundering, tumbling
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling to mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not with Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary as I roll reality through galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of weed
With a chain representing penitentiaries
From Roman town to Bordentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
Lifers, Rikers to Folsom
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening too slow
I'm abrupting construction a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin behind an obstruction or turning something of nothing from
Poor shit to more shit as I rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking to hump Ms. Junk in the Trunk, pump pump me up

Chorus:

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest
Utah niggas are the craziest

Verse 2: Vin Rock

My lyrics be laced with 40 ounces of funk and stuff
You get rushed, you get bust, you call yourself callin my bluff, enough's enough - I'm puttin it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questioning
My skills. Niggas I been rockin since lee twillz
And we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test but only stress is what you'll find thinking
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme Shrinkin
The sleepin MC I eat like good 'n' plenty
Lyrically spankin ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
Young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
They begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lest a man should ever challenge the clan
With thirteen years experience of rippin mics put in our hands

Chorus:

Detroit niggas are the craziest
Miami niggas are the craziest
Little Rock niggas are the craziest
Oak Town niggas are the craziest

Verse 3: Treach

I got barbarians to bogard me in
At a club that barred me when
A broad got thrown like barbarnigan born again, thrown aboard
A brim is broke to the back I brawl and band from brains ta balls
Da boots word ta-burr-bam-boo break the loot
Blowing up brain cells BOOM like Beirut
Assume the same suit, fuck that fly shit wit the flavor ca shi
Gives last name ain't Suzuki but still my sidekick
Whip that hide quick if ya slide quick, blood clot ya Blood clique
You ain't rolling if our tape ain't what ya ride wit
Niggas snipe shit so I'm on a knife tip
Like the youngsters 'bout ta take you on some hip-hop ride shit
If you ain't jumpin then don't pump it
I'm hittin Jermaine in Atlanta cos he owe me loot for that jump shit
Fuck astronauts I rock it
And from now on if you bite my style when I see you, I'm in your pockets

Chorus:

Cleveland niggas are the craziest
Virginia niggas are the craziest
Kentucky niggas are the craziest
St. Louis niggas are the craziest
Atlanta niggas are the craziest
Maryland niggas are the craziest
San Diego niggas are the craziest
Seattle niggas are the craziest
Boston niggas are the craziest
Illtown niggas are the craziest
Zoo Crew niggas are the craziest
Jersey City niggas are the craziest
All my Newark niggas are the craziest
