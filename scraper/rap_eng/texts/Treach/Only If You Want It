[Hook: Treach]
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Can I get an eye open up
Eazy locin' up, Smokin' up
Much dust like a nut what
Give it up for the real stuff
Shut the what up
Back that shit up, what?
Hustler from the hood ho
Hopping in my trunk
The finishing touches
Would show what rough is
Coming in bunches
Could serve like lunches
Hold ya horses here's where the source is
Not very tall but never took a short kid
With a clip to claw
Wouldn't draw Mcgraw
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw
A naughty shorty, sporty with a forty
A lordy taking tours, just to plan a orgy
A nasty critter, any ho hitter
Hated my babysitter cause she wouldn't let me hit her
Now get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Here's something from the ding dong cause
I really care how long ya been strong grown
Here comes permastoned cone
Couldn't hang with the king of the records
But I call for a yes y'all toots
My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush
I push a record through a heifer like a woody wooder
And if I left then that means that I should've booger
Here's a new track, for all the new jacks
I'm kicking it the hardest so gimme my shoes back
So I limp when I step it's the pimp
And I rep so make a right and get left quick
So try to play strong and long gone
The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong
Get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eazy-E, Treach]
[Treach:] Ooooooh a new jack! a new jack!
[Eazy-E:] Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat
Back back smack, here comes a witty black
Enemies go hide I'm bout to show why
Eazy's peeling caps cause my gats in the low ride
Bang when the gat speaks, two in the back seat
My homie rides shotgun waiting to spot one
Duz is a fool who don't run, duck, dive and slide to a ride
I'm shudder shaking the place when I start hey
So don't butter me, Eazy-E but a park hey
The only thing the flow needs now to be fly is a feather
I see the smiling faces in wilding places
Ya know me better, hard rotty kid
Killed Cali kid, now ya know it boy
Left up in the alley dead
Now get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it
