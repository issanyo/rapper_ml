There's a party around the corner
You can go if you wanna
Stop on by, it's gonna be live
It's on tonight, it's on tonight

1 - It's summertime and you're feeling right
Have you heard there's a house party tonight
You're gonna groove to the treasure light
Everything's going to be alright
Ladies short skirts with your weaves in
Dance a little slow trying to tease them
Players showing out for no reason
Cause it's a party, come on

[Lil' Man]:
Ladies looking so sexy
It's already moving to 'Face and Jon B
"They Don't Know" about this here, party
It's so hot but you don't mind
Cause you're having such a good time
Up the block, around the corner
Apartment 3A, on the 3rd Storee

Repeat 1

Ladies and fellas put your hands together, come on
Everybody put your hands together
3rd Storee sing yeah put your hands together, come on

[Treach]:
Yo, yo, what?
I wanna hear you burn, burn, burn, burn
Shake it, shake it party night in the pj's
Women in the denim, no food, drinks and dj
Party for the dinner v-say
Slippin' money on the tummy with a honey pushing replay
On the 3rd Storee in your city
Nineteen Naughty Nine, commit flows, will make y'all feel me, really
The average dummy taking territory with 3rd Storee, all glory
You know my little Naughty shortys
