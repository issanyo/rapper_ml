[Intro: Singer]
Even though we love you
You know we don't have that much time
To really, really, really fuck with you
Oh even though we love you
You know we don't have that much time
To really, really, really fuck with you
Fuck with you

[Verse 1: Fam & Diesel]
I be cuttin' the fuck up and down, side to side, all around
All the time, often now with a raw sound
Who's the man, damn, fam can jam
Rush, rumble, ram, slam and kickin' tall cans
Stop the presses, hold up, stop the damn presses
I'm next up to flex, mic checks to address this
Feeling, feeling, I got a feelin
Adrenaline, got me trembling, I got the style
Can't hold it back 'cause I'm too damn wild
Oh hell no, a rugged road rebel flow
Hell yeah you know, same brother, scarface
Braided afro, outlaw, Rottin' Razkal
Guess who? The hooligan you hate to see
Yesterday was in your face but now I'm in your TV
The same nigga from da bricks fighting clicks for kicks
I don't care, I really don't give a damn
Smack yo' up and pass you to my swingin fam
Poof, now be gone, OK
'Cause this is how we play every rottin' single holiday

[Chorus: Fam and Diesel
A-yo, here we go, here we go
Yes, yes y'all, here we go, here we go
A-yo, here we go, here we go
Yes, yes y'all, here we go, here we go

[Verse 2: Fam & Diesel]
A-yo, a-yo, is it so, is it so?
Please tell me no, oh no, no, oh no, no
You claim to be schizophrenic but practically panic
When me and my clique roll tight and thick like the titanic
They should have it banned, ghetto pass revoked, stands branded
My choke, you couldn't manage, the yolk do too much damage
Pop goes the Diesel, no, never that
Don't try and dirty-mac, you rodent, you river rat
Raps counterreact, they counterattack
You're a tat for tat that's wack, enemies like that, black
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Giving props to KRS-One for stayin true to the ghetto streets]

[Chorus: Fam and Diesel
A-yo, here we go, here we go
Yes, yes y'all, here we go, here we go
A-yo, here we go, here we go
Yes, yes y'all, here we go, here we go

[Verse 3: Fam & Diesel]
Here I come with nothing ever so harder
Niggas in every hood welcome my style back like Carter
Huh, two times for the hoes, may I exposed to those
My mack daddy ride flows
Flow on then, nigga, hey, don't let me stop ya
Get in my way and I'll stop, drop and mop ya
Like that, ooooh, what ya gonna do now?
Niggas running and ducking, there's a riot goin down
But ain't nothing new to my clique or my town
I tell you I'm good with these klickow-klickow
You have run an over turn when my lyrics start to burn
Like the chronic in the blunt and you can't front on the skunk
That's kickin in like jail toes who knows what the fuck goes on
You're tryin play me, you're dead wrong
For all you silly slippin slouches, I be flippin on ya
Pop the lip, I have my fist steady stickin on ya
I mean, man, I'm like amazing and you know ain't no fazing
This Double I bunch been ripping and raging

[Chorus x2: Fam and Diesel]
A-yo, here we go, here we go
Yes, yes y'all, here we go, here we go
A-yo, here we go, here we go
Yes, yes y'all, here we go, here we go

[Outro: Fam]
