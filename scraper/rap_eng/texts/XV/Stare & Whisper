"They just stare and whisper wherever I go
They just stare and whisper, now everyone knows"
They just "stare and whisper"
Police is watching, the streets is talking
"Now everyone knows"

[Verse One]:
That I'm a rapper, dude, that's what they notice first
And that my rapping crew makes situations worse
So I can I give my view on how you give us views?
Like we just rap, hoop, talk loud and barbecue
Man, they don't hear the dude, they all skip the message
You perplexed with my complexion, man, get to stepping
And they don't know that I'm close to a deal
They get a counterfeit marker on my $5 bill
I wear my hat the the side, roll with a couple of thugs
Bump my shit in the ride, turn it all the way up
Call a cutie a honey, call a hoochie a ho
Middle fingers to the cops, yeah, you already know
I wear a do-rag to lay down my waves, but somehow
They turn that around to I'm in a gang
Instead of staring, just try to wave and say, 'Hi'

And still you'll be feeling the ghost within ya
And I'll be damned if I let some label choose my look
You can't describe me through the pictures in you're rapping books
You can't allow the money stacking in my platinum jeans
Allow you to think that you know me in the magazines
Just allow the scene and the songs I bring
X out the thoughts you brought and describe to the V
Don't allow my status being king of the city
Take your perception quickly
Cause I'm a gentleman like Mr. Bentley
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered with talk
And like, "How can I get on?" I just hear it too often
So when I say I'm busy, guess I'm being unfair
I bet I'll make my way to Heaven with all of these Stans
