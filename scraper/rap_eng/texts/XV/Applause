(Chorus)
I like the way that she walk
Somebody giving her a round of applause
If you heard how she talk it will make you wanna get in her draws
If you could see what I saw, she like nothing i’ve ever seen before
I can’t find a single flaw somebody give that girl a round of applause

(verse 1, XV)
Wish I had more hands like Goro or More so
I could emplore that ass face chest and torso
She got a rich body make em say poor soul
‘cause if you go in than its gonna be fin like dorsal
My friend told me just whip out the Porsche low
Reality tv ride it’s all for show
Said she never cheated but gave me the door codes
And if you go down I advise you bring a snorkel
Girls get wet around me like fiji
I say I’m XV and they never believe me
I’m the prez but my PR make it look easy
Modern day marvel. but they know me in DC
My body scream excuse me
Buttercup skin, I be calling her reeses
And the stomach like BG's
We down on the floor
She even made a square give a round of applause

(Chorus)

(Verse 2, 4ize)
So I can I get an encore
If she a very freaky girl I let her meet my mom for
‘cause baby fly like a condor
‘cause european chicks French kisses on my body bonjour
And the skin is a soft more but I’m a fresh man
We’re tryin’ to make a junior
I’ll stay with her till I am a Senior citizen
Her legs wiggling in the middle of my maneuver
Yes, She got junk in the trunk she break it down like a step brothers top bunk
With my own head doctor on call
I gotta make it clap like Busta, Spliff and Sean Paul
For real y’all, she like the best chick ever
So go on show your love and put your hands together
A standing O 4ize at a show in the front row steady yelling out BRAVO!

(Chorus)

(Verse 3, Ashton Travis)
Ok Ok I clap it up
She my opportunity I can’t pass it up
And if she got friend that want to bend
We can hit the back seat of the benz and lap it up
I’m actin up I want a score at home
I got the wood bat up
I ain’t the dog but she like me cuz im tatted up
And I give it to her till she say she had enough
I want to crash in that ass, no hit and run
And her mama look good that’s where she get it from
I want to get it done, I know her face fine
But I just want that lip and tongue
Damn, that girl got that thighs
And legs like Tuesday at Popeyes
But instead I want breasts ‘cause I like D's
So she pointed at her chest and said, "like these?"
I said I’m quite pleased hit the lights please

(Chorus)
