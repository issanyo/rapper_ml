[Intro]
You know? I think that everybody...well maybe not everybody
But somebody should feel me on this one, anybody that's just been told no
Nah, you can't do that, you know? This is my struggle though, look...

[Verse 1: XV]
Gunning for the top, pistol never aimed down
Coming for my spot like Cruella de Vil’s gown
Remember? I said I’d run the town in December
When I was knocking Definition out while I entered
I looked in the mirror and said wow
That lost complex boy from Kansas has been found
Amazing Grace I became this way
Hope I can save this game from what it’s becoming right now
Ain’t gon’ point fingers, just turn your radio loud
And you’ll see why saying that I’m a rapper don’t make me proud
But this game’s like high school and I ain’t in the crowd
So all I’m trying to say now…

[Hook]
Please don’t shoot me down ‘cause I’m flying, I’m flying, I’m higher, yeah
Please don’t shoot me down, I'm like on Squaria with this one man, ‘cause I’m flying, I’m higher, look...

[Verse 2: XV]
He said Flyboy, how can I join your club?
I told him members only homie, back on up
He said I’m sorry Mister Hoffer but my rap’s so tough
I’m only fifteen years old but I have so much
Material inside my eerie dome so while I eat my Cheerios
I memorize so many flows to rap at lunch while I’m at school
And Everything Is Cool is your best stuff and the Square In The Circle
I hope that blows up, I said thanks, he said wait, maybe I’m not done
I’ve been waiting all of my life to run into you son
But I been handing all my CD’s to people who won’t listen to
And it just so happens that I have only one
So I’m gonna give this to you, I hope you like my sound
But not as much as I hope that I don’t see this on the ground
Just put this in your CD player, you don’t have to play it loud
Just check it out and…

[Hook 2]
Please don’t shoot me down, yeah, ‘cause I’m flying
I’m flying and I’ve done it before, I’m higher, please don’t make me do it no more
Please don’t shoot me down ‘cause I’m flying, watch me soar
I’m higher, where the fuck is my guitar? Now roar
Please don’t shoot me down ‘cause I’m flying, I’m flying, I’m higher
