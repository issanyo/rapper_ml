[Verse One: Sam Scott]
Now I came at the party, so where the girls at?
Tall little cutie when I stepped in, bring her back
I've been watching you
Monkey see is what monkey do, so follow me baby
Both hands in the sky
It's a stick up
Oh sweetheart don't you move

Oh the way you move
You're untouchable
From the cross the room, I knew I needed you
You're a dancin' fool
Don't stop just drop it boo
From across the room I knew I needed you

[Hook]
Everybody in the front if you ain't doing nothing say oh oh
Everyone in the back put your hands up and let me hear you oh oh
If you ain't doing nothing and you want a little something say aaaah
Everybody jump and shake the ground in the club say oh oh

[Verse Two: XV]
Focus focus, everybody focus
Vizzy and Sam Scott in the spot take notice
Need more bottle tell the model that's a Hostess
Made a lot of bread this year we should toast this
Left with a profit/prophet like we kidnap Moses
If X don't owe it, I tic tac toe it, and throw it
For people that I get that doe with
The culprit
Of makin' these ladies act bogus
I ask her where she from, my dreams
Told her, "You the twinkle in my eyes" Visine
She knows there's no Others up in the building like Nicole Kidman
No kidding, just, Me, Myself & Irene
She love pizza and Tower of Piza up in a cup, that's lean
That makes her do a lot of freaky things
So we was on the floor with her hands in my jeans
The crowd going crazy let me paint the scene

[Hook]

She's amazing the way she's on the flo' with me, all night
And I can't stop alright yeah
I've been waiting for you
Monkey see is what monkey do, so follow me baby
We're gonna take it low
I gotta keep you down
Gotta lift up
Now don't you move

Oh the way you move
You're untouchable
From the cross the room, I knew I needed you
You're a dancin' fool
Don't stop just drop it boo
From across the room I knew I needed you

[Hook]
