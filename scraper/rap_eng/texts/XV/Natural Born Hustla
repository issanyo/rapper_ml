[Chorus] [Akon]:
I'm a natural born hustla
See I ain't gotta tell you my dude you can see it
If one's a customer, and with a simple conversation I make you believe it
That I'm gon' give it
That you can depend (uh huh)
A pocket full of hundred stacks my friend (uh huh)
An O.G., no need to pretend (uh huh)
Erase you by the stroke of my pen now

[Verse One] [XV]:
Look here
See I'm a Hustler like Larry Flint
You niggas is Playboys, I hop in a cherry whip
Call it my play toy, they say it don't make sense
Why don't it make noise?
Silencer on the muffler, fucker I'm a (hustla)
Rarely be seen
So justice makes justice on why I'm the king
The boss, the veto, the president
Niggas can't veto, it's evident you niggas can't be no (hustla)
Cause you would never see no bread
I don't care if it's communion or it's on your head
Went from bottom to the top like it's tailor made
Even the haters, I made 'em pay

[Chorus] [Akon]:
I'm a natural born hustla
See I ain't gotta tell you my dude you can see it
If one's a customer, and with a simple conversation I make you believe it
That I'm gon' give it
That you can depend (uh huh)
A pocket full of hundred stacks my friend (uh huh)
An O.G., no need to pretend (uh huh)
Erase you by the stroke of my pen now

[Verse Two]:
See the day I Play, you can call me Moby
And I don't wear chains, don't call me Toby
Don't clown if I ain't your homie
Cause I will roll up like poly
Only, Hoffa made it cool for these fools to get fresh
Still in my right state of mind, I went left
While hip hop was on it's way to instant death
CPR through CD-R, I give it breath
No biting, dope flow, ghost writing, boat loads of beats
Mixtapes on the streets get a check
XV, no hyphen, check me
Go type in Royalty Recordz on the net

[Chorus] [Akon]:
I'm a natural born hustla
See I ain't gotta tell you my dude you can see it
If one's a customer, and with a simple conversation I make you believe it
That I'm gon' give it
That you can depend (uh huh)
A pocket full of hundred stacks my friend (uh huh)
An O.G., no need to pretend (uh huh)
Erase you by the stroke of my pen now
