[Intro]
Yeah (3x)
Let's do something for the hometown Richie
Unh, watch us

[Hook]
We stop the unstoppable
Break the unbreakable
Shock the unshockable
Watch us baby
We beat the unbeatable
Reach the unreachable
Do the impossible
We shockers baby

[Verse 1]
Rap villain, I'm feeling like Max Dillon
Electrifying the game, I'm giving back that feeling
In fact, I'm feeling fantastic as bats to build it
Sit back, you ain't at bat, you was wack the last inning
They told me to bring it back home, so this is out the Wrangler field
Chasing a dream, they said that we can't fulfill
Damn we gets no respect Rodney Dangerfield
But come around these streets and they'll see the pain is real
Planting seeds to the game, just breaking herb down
Took a little break and watch these fake niggas burn out
Expanding my brain and the thangs that I learn 'bout
Proud how them L7 niggas done put the word out
How I'm the shit and never put a turd out
Northside turn out, Eastside nerd out
Bad bitches show your titties, they'll get blurred out
This is the city that everybody's heard 'bout

[Hook]
