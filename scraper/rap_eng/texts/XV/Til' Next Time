[Verse One]:
Yeah, it was all Clear
I see the end like Ted Turner
And though they try to hate my flows rarer than red burgers
Downing all the lying of signing and said mergers
Still working with Seven, ain't no 11 to 7 workers
I never really got an introduction
Because the main discussion
Is various comparisons to other niggas busting
Forget my rhyme schemes, what that line means
Fuck it cause the fans are gonna love it
Yeah
I don't have a donor sticker on my license
But I still give y'all my heart when I'm writing
Telling all y'all about my life in the Underworld
And I ain't never battled no vampires of lycans
So what's it like then?
It's kinda like when
The Olympians went to battle with the Titans
Uh huh, we all fighting like we might win
Knowing we can't take any of it when the time ends

[Chorus]:
Planets, moons, star
Earth, Jupiter, Mars
Knows, clothes, cars
It's who you are

[Verse Two]:
So the end has came
Not the end of days, more like the end of rain
Clouds at night
All complex forms of matter that block the sight
A clear view of what's wrong and what's right
But I found, yeah I found my sound...tonight
So I have no fear what you might hear the next time I write
My voice no longer shakes
Though my beats may rattle or pound of what have you
I still have the hunger in my sound like the march of 300 Spartans going into battle
My fears I have came to face
My moves I have laid in place
I once was blind and now I see why I am amazing grace
So til next time

[Chorus]:
Planets, moons, star
Earth, Jupiter, Mars
Knows, clothes, cars
It's who you are
