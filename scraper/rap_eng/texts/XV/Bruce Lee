[Verse One: XV]
Ladies got a passion for button mashing
They always tappin' X
Grab your shoes and pack your shit
Then I hit the LAX
Yes I swear that they call me Fresh Prince of the KS
Cause I fill up/Phillip Banks and throw chickens out like Jazzy Jeff
Used to pushup on hoes back when I didn't have no chest
Now I do pullups on those cause they know I got a rep
Yep
So keep in mind when I leave this rhyme
I'm Jackie Chan on mine, no CGI effects
Killin' shit on wax
Mr. Miyagi the flow yo
Ain't no need to practice but I'm all about my doe Joe/dojo
You copy what I Cop, I call you niggas Robo
You shop in South Houston and I shop out in Soho
So go and get your own style jockin' me, that's homo
How can you get money in skinny jeans?
I don't need no nerd glasses, motherfucker I can see
Hopefully, you can too cause no one do it like V
Look

[Hook: XV] {x2}
Y'all better know who he with
Yep, I'm on my Bruce Lee shit
Can I kick it (yep!)
Well can I kick it (yep!)
Can I kick it (yep!)
So let me kick it (yep!)

[Verse Two: Erik Flowchild]
I'm like...hiyah
Let me take you higher
Lyrically, the black belt, yours is lookin' whiter
You are not a writer
Matter of fact you're stuck
I'm a little Lamborghini, see I open doors up
Yep
You never heard of
The child of the flow who's unlimited with words
And mister with her last night
Heard she wasn't ? she gave me that ass twice
Make the synonym for murderer
So assassinate me bitch
Like I'm little Lil' Wayne
But your sorry little brain will never comprehend
Whenever I'm on the AM
I see, I see
You just want an icey wrist
But you ain't in the mix with these rappers
You ain't in the mix? How the hell you get a master
This? You bastards
Sit, let the pen stay
Yeah, I'm Canadian but you ain't got no sense

[Hook]
