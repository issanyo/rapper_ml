[Hook]:
Your girl wanna lose her mind
She wanna get on the floor and grind
She wanna get inside my ride and lose her mind

[Verse One]:
Your girl went out with her girlfriends
They all pulled up in pearl Benz
I told her, "Get with me.", must have been Wizard 3
Cause I made her disappear like Merlin
She bought a couple drinks and a lime to chase it
The ring finger on her left hand was naked
So I figured that was my chance to go get my dance
And show shawty where I can take this
Shazzam playing You And All Of Your Spender
She wanna spend time all you do is spender her
She said she was about to try your new agenda
I told her, "You just need a new agenda."
"Are all nerds as good as you?"
"Yes
Cause nerds do everything they do, the best."
She said she wanna increase her IQ
So we went to my room and I gave the test

[Hook]:
Your girl wanna lose her mind
She wanna get on the floor and grind
She wanna get inside my ride and lose her mind
"Lose it. Lose it. Mind. (Huh?)"
Your girl wanna lose her mind
She wanna get on the floor and grind
She wanna get inside my ride and lose her mind
"Lose it. Lose it. Mind. (Huh?)"

Your girl wanna lose her mind
She wanna get on the floor and grind
She wanna get inside my ride
It's a loser number, loser, so I made her lose her mind

[Verse Two]:
She lose her mind but go back to you though
The difference like Harvard to a ju co
Too easy and class is quicker
When I stay hard and my books is thicker
Yes
I'm that nigga
You wish that she would blame it on that liquor
She ain't even care that I don't hit waist
Cause I might be a square but she like my shape
Watch her tied down like Anne in King Kong
She gonna bounce back like the ball in Ping Pong
My doorbell ding dongs, she says no words
Don't callback cause she moving forwards
"Are all nerds as good as you?"
"Yes
Cause nerds do everything they do, the best."
She said she wanna increase her IQ
So we went to my room and I gave the test

[Sample from Revenge Of The Nerds]:
Are all nerds as good as you?
Yes

[Verse Three]:
You text in the booth like, "Where you at?"
She ain't with you so why you ask?
She tired of your ass and wanna move on
And it just so happens I rented a U-Haul
The phone goes silent whenever you call
And she start wilding whenever you gone
She turned off by whatever you on
You got cut out and used like a coupon
On another note we on another boat
Took another trip to a whole 'nother coast
Got the S500, that I always wanted
With the built in Atari 2600
Ask you boy
I was in the whip playing Asteroid
Couldn't beat level 6 I was past annoyed
She wanted to flip and give me face like Pastor Troy
