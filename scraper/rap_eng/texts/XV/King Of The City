[Sample from Mambo Italiano]
"A girl went back to Napoli
Because she missed the scenery
The native dances and the charming songs
But wait a minute, something's wrong
Hey, mambo! Mambo italiano
Hey, mambo! Mambo italiano
Go, go, go you mixed up sicialiano
All you calabraise-a do the mambo like a crazy"

[Verse One]:
Hey y'all oh
The king of the city
Yeah, you can't catch up with me
You better get busy
Track after track they hear the name like,"Who is he?"
Been dropping since '02 and you still seem to miss me
2005 must have missed me
Cause I'm hopping on this Mambo track attacking like a grizzly
Back on 'em, mack on 'em, all black on 'em
Gotham City, Vizzy, I let the bats swarm 'em
Still talking slick but I warned him
I'm the best
Hail Mary's to the chest
Yes, we will mourn him
If you got a beef, well I'm on him
Black on him like a Raider
The most well known dude in the city next to Rader
Dennis, that is
I'm a Menace in this
I finished the gear
They claim that he ending careers
Tell me how you ending careers
When yours hasn't even started yet
That problem is solved, bet

[Hook]: {x2}
"Hey Mambo!"
The king of the city and you can't catch up with me
Once you see me I'm gone so
(go go go go)
All the ladies singing
"All you calabraise-a do the mambo like a crazy"

[Verse Two]:
I'm the Dub's rapping Moses
Add the closest
The King of the city like Cove is
Without the dope sales, none of my coke is
The realist on this flow shit
But let me take a second to get so braggadocios
Ask around, listen to the songs, I'm a poet
Mixed with a little Cris' and Dom and some Moet
They all wanted mo' X, Vizzy with the chilly flows
Still when I speak on a beat it's halitosis
Everybody want it if I opened up they noses
Once they took a sniff, immediate over dosage
You'll know it when you hear it
It's a classic or I'm near it
I did it to the death and now I'm fearless
Hear this
A rapper with a backpack on
And a gat that's drawn
A social conscious, add that on
That equals a complex mind that makes up Don
I'll let you other rappers make up songs
You on your own

[Hook]: {x2}
"Hey Mambo!"
The king of the city and you can't catch up with me
Once you see me I'm gone so
(go go go go)
All the ladies singing
"All you calabraise-a do the mambo like a crazy"

[Verse Three]:
Everybody ask, "Who gon' do it first?
Who gon' put it on the map?"
Everywhere I go, Wichita is gon' be on my back
Dub K, Deuce One
New York cats will tell ya
Who took that Air Capital rhythm to Australia?
Right hand over the chest, I won't fail ya
And I'm gonna bring the trophy home, I won't mail ya
Every rapper want to eat Vizzy for their lunch
But I promise that y'all won't beat Vizzy to the punch
State the facts
If you say my name it's a wrap
And I only said that, cause it's all just a trap
I'mma watch your lips flap, put my name in your raps
While I run the track like track meets
Build up plaques like bad teeth
Ask, "Who brought the Dub in the building?"
And I don't care if I'm hurting your feelings
I show love
To y'all out there doing your thing
But I rep Royalty Records so I gotta be king
Ya heard?

[Hook]: {x2}
"Hey Mambo!"
The king of the city and you can't catch up with me
Once you see me I'm gone so
(go go go go)
All the ladies singing
"All you calabraise-a do the mambo like a crazy"
