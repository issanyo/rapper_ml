[Hook](2x)
I ain't gonna follow
Ye ain't gotta worry
Y'all can't see me
Contacts blurry
Killin these niggas, Conrad Murray
Yeah I'm Killin' these niggas, Conrad Murray

[Verse 1: J-Doe]
Alright I'm killin' these niggas
Yeah, I'm killin' these niggas
I wonder why the label gave the deal to these niggas
To keep it real I ain't feelin' these niggas
If it's five hundred degrees, wouldn't chill with these niggas
Hey, house paid, full care paid off
Work for myself, I can't get laid off
Got a wrist full of hate and a neck full of jealousy
Mind full of genius shit, so what the fuck you tellin' me?

[Hook](2x)

[Verse 2: XV]
So many bars man I'm guilty to I'm filthy
Blowin' color purple, got me spitting like Celie
How these niggas got dealies, I be lookin' like really?
Jacket so thriller, jeans worth a billie
Shouts to the composer, man this idea is silly
Tryin' to be a legend but these goofy niggas kill me
Put an end to these niggas, who gave pens to these niggas?
You doodoo, man I'm voodoo, put a pin in these niggas

[Hook]
