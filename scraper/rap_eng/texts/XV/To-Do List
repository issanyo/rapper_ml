[Verse One]:
My long list of errands includes this girl Erin
That I used to take baths with when we were day caring
And I often say
"Only reason for a million dollars is to do chicks" like Lawrence on Office Space
Big house off the lake
Know my name like Cheers, then get Album Of The Year, very clear
Weird, but I think that I deserve it
Rihanna on my list, but no fighting in my whip we make it to the Grammy's perfect
I've touched the moon's surface so when you talk about fly
I just roll my eyes and say, "You don't know the purpose."
Fly Boy Club, we the ribbon and the curtains
That's the opening and closing, it gets weirder in the verses
So please pay attention
Did I mention I'm a whore for
X-Box achievements trying to raise my gamer's core
I'll be cool with 50,000 and then I'm down to tour
Drop like 13 albums and then I'll just be bored
But once I'm done getting my floss on
I'm going to vacate to the place they shoot Lost on
Retire as a top 5 rhymer when you think I'm done
Then I'm going to find love on VH1

[Hook] [XV]:
So grab a pen, grab some paper
Make a list, and tell them haters
This is what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
And now I know it...ooooh
So grab a pen, grab some paper
Make a list, and tell them haters
This is what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
And now I know it...ooooh

[Verse Two] [TiRon]:
I got a long list of priorities like Laura please
Can you order me a porter house in the house
That overlooks the city with a chick that looks saditty
Cause she's prettier than Minnie
Minnie Mouse and I'm her Micky
And we tripping
Venice, Sicily, sipping on V notes
C-Notes by the layer shit, true fucking player shit
Plus I promise myself before I die
I will fly like my momma said I could, so can I do so?
New clothes, new hoes, benji's, Bentleys
My friends drinking Nouveau and puffing on Pluto
Wait, why should I even worry if you give me kudos?
Those that knew flat top T know what it be
And those that don't just didn't get it
But I'm sending this post card signed sealed delivered
Still pray for 'em when I drop to my knees
And I even send a helicopter for 'em when I visit
Let's get it
