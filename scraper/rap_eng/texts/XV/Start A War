[Verse 1: Colin Munroe]
Hey little miss creature, nice to meet you
Shall we start a war?
Light it up and let my world collide with yours
Hey little miss creature, the perfect match you'd make
On paper it's so wrong, but it's so right, it must be fate
Never gonna take it back, never gonna let you down
A war like this could turn the world around

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
This time no need for missiles to start a war
No one's loved like this before
No need for missiles, I'm sure
This love is enough to start a war
To start a war, to start a war, to start a war

[Verse 2: XV]
Ay, she said baby, let's make love, I said nah, let's make war
Then I started playing in her bush
But she screwed me out my seat, so I guess I'm Gore
Ha and all that I ask that
If I take you home tonight, I'm planting that flag
â€˜Cause you done made peace with my heart
But the whole world feeling there's bombs over Baghdad
N-n-n-n-now let's get oil rich
Enough to make all your ex boyfriends sick
And even though you wind me up
And I march to the beat of your heart, don't toy with this
And I just had to find a way to let you know
That if this blows, off the world we go

[Hook]

[Bridge: Colin Munroe and XV]
Never gonna let you go, never gonna let you down
Never gonna lose a war, never gonna turn around
Never gonna let you go, never gonna let you down
Never gonna lose a war, never gonna turn around

[Hook 2: Colin Munroe]
This time no need for missiles to start a war
No one's loved like this before
No need for missiles, I'm sure
This love is enough to start a war
To start a war, to start a war, to start a war
To start a war, to start a war, to start a war
