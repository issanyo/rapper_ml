[Intro]:
Awe man. Had to do it to 'em again. You know who did the track. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...7! Let's rock!

[Verse One]:
That's the countdown, I'mma say it loud
Hoff back, I don't play around, stay around
See the prince take the crown as I just made my town
Sound like something major
Am I sounding like a hater? (Nah)
I don't need to play ya
Look, you on the bench, I'm a player
Jersey on, I sweat on the paper
I got this on lock like a C.O
So don't end up near that box like a P.O
See bro
Allow me to welcome you
This is just wax to the flame when I melt the booth
Homie I just tell the truth
You learn how to pass fast when you win a belt a few
I'mma get the last laugh don't think cause you sell a few
I won't put a couple in your skeletal
Leave you unsalable
Put it in your head like Selsun Blue
I ain't just asking, I'm telling you
Don't think it sounds real to me if it don't even sound real to you

[Hook]:
I got this on lock at the top of my game
Got everybody in the city just screaming my name
It goes X to the
V to the
X to the
V to the
I got this on lock at the top of my game
Got everybody in the world just screaming my name
It goes X to the
V to the
X to the
V to the

[Verse Two]:
It only get better, man you know the two letters
Say "X"
You know the rest
Spit it fast like I reload the tech
Don't stick out your breast cause I'll repo your chest
Seven let 'em know yo, who flow like X? (Nobody)
I don't got to stand in line, they know who's next
I don't got to take a number, I did this every summer
But after four years everybody kind of wonders
What to do from here, that's the end of their career
And this is just my jump start
So everybody wants to beef cause I'm me
But see, that's the fun part
Bring it one y'all to son all and rub all
Cause I don't got time to play around so I duck y'all
Bug off, I hate being arrogant see
Apparently y'all hate it too
So I do this just to bug y'all
I'd rather do a song with some meaning
But I'm just feeling me man
This is my year dawg, I mean it

[Hook]:
I got this on lock at the top of my game
Got everybody in the city just screaming my name
It's goes X to the
V to the
X to the
V to the
I got this on lock at the top of my game
Got everybody in the world just screaming my name
It goes X to the
V to the
X to the
V to the
