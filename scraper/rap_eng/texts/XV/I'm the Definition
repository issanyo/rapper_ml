I'm me, bad culo
Young call for chulu
Got niggas looking for me, holla at me, Bruno
Least no body to nose
Gotta say kudos
Outer space niggas like Pharrell and Chad Hugo
They say I'm too shallow, though a nigga barely swim
These chubby niggas talking but there chance is very slim
Everybody wanna do it big like him
You ain't drop a mixtape, you gave it to your friends that
Gave it to they friends and they nodding in the back
I don't care if it's a Benz wherever you play it, it's whack
If it don't got the Royalty on it, niggas don't play it
Download the hole thing, cats don't even save it
Save it
The whole anthem, shit, dog, I made it
Where I'm from, bumps in any trunk from here to Cambridge
Ain't it
Funny how these chicks start behaving
When they see the Royalty crown chain swanging
36DD, got 'em coming out (Whoo!)
Walk on the scene, Cling got 'em running out (Yeah!)
Mall close down every time I come around
Ladies only in the halter tops, tummies out cause
I'm the definition, definition (X4)
