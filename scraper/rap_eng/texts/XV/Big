[Intro]
I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear

Alright Richie, we got two more
Two more sixteens and we out of here
Unh, Unh-Unh
Shout out to that nigga Cole
Yeah, Dreamville
What up [Ebb?]
I mean y'all niggas over there bragging like Jay
Me, I guess I wanna be big
I guess I wanna be big
Not even Biggie either, like the movie
You know what I mean?
Like the house with all the toys in it and shit

[Verse 1]
Tom Hanks birthday need Tom Hanks crib
Tell Big, "smoking blunts with Tom Hanks kid"
How I do, do it big, that is all I did
All my life, every night, Playboy I live
Got a freak up in my sheets and she at home alone and
She drop her jaws and grab her cheeks like she Macaulay Culkin
I put it deep, she probably think it's in her abdomen
A little me inside your stomach that's a bad omen (hehe)
I give two coins for bitches that's on my groin
I pay'em that much attention and then I gotta get going
I'm 'bout to build an empire, my numerals is growing
No time for bad bitches, living in the moment
Get the heat, Al Pacino, Dinero
Y'all the other guys, Wahlberg and Ferrell
Born sinner, opposite of a winner
Five-seven and I can't get thinner
Guess a nigga just wanna be big


[Outro]
I guess I wanna be big
(Born sinner, the opposite of a winner)
I guess I wanna be big
(Born sinner, the opposite of a winner)
I guess I wanna be big, big
(Born sinner, the opposite of a winner)
I guess I wanna be big nigga
(Born sinner, the opposite of a winner)
