[Intro: Jet 2]
You know I just wanna give a special thanks to
Everybody that listens to my shit
'Cause uh
'Cause you know I don't feel worthy enough for y'all ears
But y'all are always kind enough to lend me those so, uh
Yeah
You know, that's XV on the hook by the way, shout out to XV
This is originally his song
But I'mma just, you know take this time to introduce myself to those listeners that are just tuning in
My name is Jet 2 and it's nice to meet you
So here's a little bit of my story, you feel me, enjoy

[Chorus: XV]
I'm up in the sky
High up in the air
I be lookin' down
All I see are squares
All I see are sqaures
The city's never there
When you're up in the clouds
All you see are squares

[Verse 1: Jet 2]
Not many options to choose from
Either rap or loser
Forfeited a bachelor degree so I dropped out of school 'cause
I felt I just knew too much
Never studied after class
It's always go record, so I didn't really do much
I never cared for tutors
I didn't read, but still managed
To have a mouthpiece as powerful as tubas
That's deep
Flow as sweet as nougat
Too short for quarterback, and way too little for hooper
Who's your influence, I tell 'em that it's Kazuya
Jin, Lei Wulong, and a little bit of Kuma
Stuck on Tekken Tag, I'm a video game fanatic
Ladies would've thought I was stupid if it wasn't for that Madden
Had a dream as a gamer
Grew out of that Final Fantasy
To wake up to reality
Currently chasing Jasmine
To figure I'm such an unworthy suitor like Aladdin
With a carpet made of magic
I'm flying without practice, nigga

[Chorus: XV]
I'm up in the sky
High up in the air
I be lookin' down
All I see are squares
All I see are sqaures
The city's never there
When you're up in the clouds
All you see are squares
