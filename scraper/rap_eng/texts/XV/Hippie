[Hook]
I'm riding through the city with no worries (no worries)
That thang is on my hippie, it's no worries (no worries)
I'm walking in that biddie with no worries (no worries)
Got that piece like a hippie, it's no worries (no worries)

[Verse 1]
I'm riding 'round my town in a slow speed motion
Ain't had a license in years, the police know it
Heater under my seat, it ain't even cold and
I see the new me in the mirror and the old me showin'
In my rear view and I hear you haters don't be knownin'
'Til I came through with the window down and rollie showin'
L7 fam, so we four deep rollin'
Known for making them Squares dance like we Do-Si-Doin'
We don't worry though, what that drama 'bout
I let my Kobe show, then the mamba's out
You just a baby boy, Melvin on yo couch
Kicked out yo baby crib, you at your mama's house
So what you talking 'bout?
You ain't mixing with powder
You wake and bakin' with flower
You playing Drake in the shower
We want ours
We've had enough like Hot.97 or Rush Hour
And now I want Power
