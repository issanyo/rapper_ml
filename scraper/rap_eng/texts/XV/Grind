[Chorus](2x)
So you wanna ball?
I wanna ball, I wanna ball
So you wanna shine
I wanna shine, I wanna shine
Then you better get up and grind
Then you better get up and grind
Then you better get up and grind
Nigga stop wasting all of your time

[Verse 1]
One summer I woke up
And rolled in class and my ass went and got my diploma, huh
Niggas can’t grind in a coma
My therapy was my aroma and my aroma’s probably doja
And niggas want a shot in a they hood so bad
They just eat Skittles and sip Arizona
I told’em “hold up!”
I got me a plan that’ll help everyone of us blow up, huh
And niggas don’t even gotta grow up
I did all of this at fifteen
When I would move E like I had a big screen
Niggas wish fiends could never get clean
Tryna be millionaires at sixteen
Ten couple years later
Wasn’t locked behind bars, I got behind bars on paper
And told my mom “see you later”
Not much changed, still got haters
Xbox gamer, been had paper
Living so civilian, treat me like the mayor
Majors pushing out pussies like labor
But I go too raw
Too real for your news reel, but you blogs
Acting like they boob jobs ain’t too hard
I know they looking like Ru Paul
But that’s more men like Utah
Who try rapping, I’m fly trapping
I’m Sky Captain, that’s Jude Law

[Chorus](2x)

[Verse 2]
You only get one chance
One shot, but would you stop if you’re gun jammed
Shit if I had that in only one hand
But I got the .22 in my shoe
And I got a hawk tucked in my pants
Call that a backup for my plans
And if you don’t back up, that go BLAM
Just to write raps, I rob tracks like Butch Cass and Sundance
You only making your son dance
You Indie, that Sundance
Pitching underhand
Bitch move when you spit dude
They try to see if we Siamese, like I give a fuck what they hip to
I’m a square dude that don’t get rules or religion
I pay dues and spend it
And I make you go ignant, go ignant
Don’t sing it unless you mean it
And don’t scream it ‘til you live it
Guess who seen it on a Zenith
And dreamed that, we go get it

[Chorus]
