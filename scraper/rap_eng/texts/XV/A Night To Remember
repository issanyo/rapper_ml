[Sample of Linda Lewis 'Fathoms Deep']:
The moon was in Neptune
I just didn't see you come
Smile down on me

[Verse One]:
We pulled up in a limo that is tinted
Leaving Benzes that is rented
What we doing when we leave, please be specific
See she done had a G on his knee making wishes
So if she gonna have me at the plate, I'mma going to hit it
But she just came for dancing and I don't mind romancing
She took me to the floor and said, "Boy, watch where your hands is!"
The DJ sped it up and then he slowed it down
That's when I set it up, "Said, is your parents in town?"
What?
That's when I set it up, "Said, is your parents in town?"

[Hook]:
My imagination seems to run away with me
When thinking of the day, drunk and gone
Drunk and gone

Now take a drink
And let's get gone
Now baby you're just coming to my arms
Shawty ain't this your song?
They see us when we enter
They all taking pictures
Let's get right in the center
This a night to remember

[Verse Two]:
Now we loosen the ties on our Tuxes and we unbutton our buttons
Shawty's heels is off, we 'bout to get in something
Maybe an after party, we walking and get it jumping
Now really would like to cut, but probably just end up cuddling
We get back to the suite room and she got a sweet tooth
She pulled out the ice cream, "Baby let me feed you
Let's go up to thee roof."
I like how that sound
We higher than the clouds and we ain't coming down
(What'd you say?)
We higher than the clouds and we ain't coming down

[Hook]:
My imagination seems to run away with me
When thinking of the day, drunk and gone
Drunk and gone
(Ayo shawty can I have this dance?)

The moon was in Neptune
I just didn't see you come
Smile down on me

My imagination seems to run away with me
When thinking of the day, drunk and gone
Drunk and gone
Now take a drink
And let's get gone

[Talkbox]
A night to remember
But I just can't see you go
A night to remember
But I just can't see you go
A night to remember
But I just can't see you go
A night to remember
Ohhhhh
