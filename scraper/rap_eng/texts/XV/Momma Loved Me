[Sample Chorus]:
"Momma loved me
Pop left me
Grandma dressed me
Plus she fed me" - Jay-Z 'Blueprint (Momma Loves Me)'

[Verse]:
And nobody could tell me different
My momma knew that I'd be special when she felt me kicking
Who knew I'd put her through the things that I put her through
When she saw me in that green J.D.F. jumpsuit
I said, "When I get home I'ma do right by you
I'll never leave, I'll never stray, I'ma stay right by you
I'ma make every dream in your life come true
By making, every dream in my life come true
When Kanye's mom died, the first thing I did was call you
I was in New York, just wanted to say that 'I love you.'"
I'm in love with two women
(Who?)
The one that birthed me
And the one that birthed her
Know that you gotta hurt me, hurt them, hurt we
Before you touch a leaf on my family tree
See everything seems so peaceful to the naked eye
And I try to hold back all this anger inside
When I smile in the faces of the same niggas that made you cry
Sometimes I wanna, nah I won't say that ma
When I Dream, sometimes I cry when I play that song
Cause after that, man I ain't had a dream in so long
And I miss...
