"When you first come in the game they try to play
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you" - Jay-Z 'Encore'

[Verse One]:
Ed Hardy hat low
So they don't see me when I come in the back do'
Because of San Greesy they used to be assholes
Now they kiss assholes
I'm saying they ain't even used to let me pass Go
Reply to my Myspace notes they say "No"
Oh
Is this how the biz go?
Mister Cee said Biggie could spit and he could spit
And he was saying this before he even had a hit
The streets bring Hoffa up
DJs call him up
I don't think they hear me Sev, please turn my volume up
Let my headphones bang
Niggas said my home ain't
Hot right now, maybe I should move to the A
Bump that, I'mma stay
Right here in Kansas mayne
Go to New York and teach them all about the Kansas slang
Cause when they hear Vizzy's name on the radio playing
A&Rs lose they jobs, DJs stop playing
Now they asking me for tracks
Suddenly I'm not paying
Now I know what Hov's saying
Look at all these hoes waving

[Verse Two]:
Now before Complex, I was at the Riverfest
Every year, this year, I ain't dealing with the mess
Everywhere I go, all the sudden hoes say "X"
They don't call me Don no more, ask me if I ?
Back then I would go on dates then drop them off
Now I be on so much, I don't take the condom off
Maybe I don't flow the same
Maybe they just know the name
Maybe they just held it in
Now they probably wanna bang
Damn
Told her that my song just dropped
Walked in the crib and her thong just dropped
Kicked her ass out and her jaw just dropped
Like, "How you gon' do that?"
"What you forgot?"
I could see that you wack when I told you were hot
Now you working at Dealers getting carts out the lot
And then they got buzzing and they don't remember that
Then I don't remember you, or you, or you

[XV talking]:
Naw baby, I really don't remember you. What's your name again?
