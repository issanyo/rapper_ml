[Verse One:]

Now see when I be on the scene with a watch
Fresh out the box everybody just stop and watch
As it's ticking
Y'all pop tags while I pop ribbons
Come through tags and I'll pop chickens
Swallow down and then I kick 'em
Out my house and keep it pimpin'
Coming almost 34 inches (word?)
Got 'em off a semi truck
You gotta do it big when you live like us
Big chains, big whips
Big broads, big ummm...
Won't go that far
But when I come through you know that car
With the new-new you know that all
MTV said

[Hook:]

All these foolish things make me who I am
Cause my watches chains and rings, I'm the coolest man
Man I gotta be cooler than their cooling fan
Cause all these foolish things make me who I am
All these foolish things
All these foolish things
All these foolish things
All these foolish things
Stop

[Verse Two:]

Beautiful mind, beautiful inside
So I gotta show her my beautiful outside
Where's the outline, turn on the TV
What does BAPE mean?
Don't matter cause I've seen Weezy
Jay-Z, Pharell, and Kan-Yeezy
Wear it so I gotta get me
One up at JC Penny
Then I gotta get some fresh ice
From a hip hop jewelry website
I'm atheist but a cross would look tight
Cause BET said it looks right, right?

[Hook]

[Verse Three:]
Now I gotta get some Cris
So I can pour it all on this tight-ass chick
Shake it around and do my dance
With this gold bottle in my hand
I've seen Cribs, that's how they live
Fly ass cars, fly ass chicks
Golden lines, riding big
I guess that's all hip hop is
