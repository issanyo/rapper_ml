My niggas roll with they gun on 'em
Stacks keep the funds on 'em
Heat on they waist like the whole damn sun's on him
I ain't a gangster, I ain't busting a heater
I strip niggas make 'em need they body cuffed to the heater
Say my name, homie, I'ma listen, don't play no games
I'ma get 'em, don't blame it on friendly competition
The weaker they are the more they talk
They keeping it raw, the speakers is off
We going to march
War it is, I'm bored with this
Writing for noting, these niggas ain't fighting for nothing
They ain't throwing no punches, they should just give it up
I'm the insignia for getting bucks
You should be the logo for homos
Shit's in the stores, watch it go slow
While mine's speed out on the street route
If this is real beef, watch your knees out
Trying to through a peace sign like peace out
Tell 'em all to be out
