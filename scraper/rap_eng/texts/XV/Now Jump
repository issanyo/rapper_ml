[Verse One]
Higher than the clouds I'm the one that their nose is turned up to
Standing on the third turn buckle
Flier than Jimmy Snooker now watch as I'm fiend to cook up
My rhyme is like 50 hookers, something to burn up to
It's fucking with my brain, the same lane these words come up through
It's dark even when the sun's up duke
I'm living in a city that Jimmy and Diddy never come up to
It's sad like a dad that don't want you
So I'm just stuck here, left here sitting
Watching a bunch of unrecognizable niggas on TV, getting recognition
Got in my ride, revved up the ignition
Now I'm 'bout to fly, like to fall out the sky, V without the ending
I know it's pessimistic, trust me
Deals is falling out the sky and everybody's lucky, but me
It seems like I'm on a trampoline
Everyone's reaching the trees for the green but I'm doing the jumping

[Hook]:
You sitting on a ledge, got fear in your head, but you hear what they said
Time's up
And your dreams inpatient, never mind them hating, everybody else waiting
Now jump (now jump) {x8}

[Verse Two]:
It's easy for someone to yell "Jump" when their mouth run
And they at ground level waiting for the outcome
I guess that's the difference between niggas who get outdone
And those that do it in for the gold like they found something
I doubt none cause your dreams is what it'll cost you
Making some fun money in a boring office
And even though I'm looking forward to those Jordan offers
To get the Jordan wins, gotta take the Jordan loses
And my cards is the one's God hand me
No back up, you looking at my plan B
I used to get F's trying to be a damn G
Now a leap of faith is really all that it lands me
No regrets when I hear that crowd chanting
Then I found ? in Hamptons like a damn king
Now I achieved something that I believed in
I hope my mom knows she's the reason

[Hook]:
You sitting on a ledge, got fear in your head, but you hear what they said
Time's up
And your dreams inpatient, never mind them hating, everybody else waiting
Now jump (now jump) {x8}

[Verse Three]:
Still sharp as steel so it makes a nigga tougher
And still, I gotta sing for my supper
Eight years, what is still left to uncover?
Except the bones of this young brother
Let me break it down
I was thirteen, bumping Big's second album
Mom saw me slipping, wait, told her I'mma make her proud
Grew up in the hood, had a good plan to make it out
Committed to the lyrics like a nigga took a sacred vow
And that's that
Clap, clap take a bow
And everybody's saying you they favorite now
But my peers turn to dickheads when they get a deal
And I pray I never change but they hoping that I will
So every time I can't replay they say that how a nigga feel
And I never answer phones, I've been that way since I was lil
So my managers get mad and my fans get unattached
And my eyes finally open when those cameras go flash
And I'd have a lot of cash if it wasn't for this rap shit
Do the math, I'm hustling backwards
But I take the good with the bad
So your lows are my highs
And I know I'm gonna fly, so I'm closing my eyes
And I'm jumping, reaching for something I know is too high
But I still grab at it, have at it, it's mine
I'll be fine once there's nothing else to prove
I guess there's nothing left to do
Now jump

[Hook]:
You're sitting on a ledge, got fear in your head, but you hear what they said
Time's up
And your dreams inpatient, never mind them hating, everybody else waiting
Now jump (now jump) {x8}
