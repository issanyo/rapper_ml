[Hook]
Man I want new
Not the shit everybody do
Not the bitch everybody knew
Tell me something new
Not the story everybody knew
I knew nobody wanted new
Man tell me what's new
Not the shit everybody do
Not the bitch everybody knew
Tell me something new
Not the story everybody knew
I knew nobody wanted new
Man tell me what's new

[Verse 1]
That shit, everybody copped
Them kicks, everybody rocked, everybody got
That bitch, everybody popped
That chicks everybody's stop
I guess that's new
New sayings everybody say
New songs everybody sang
Everybody Wayne
Kush now everybody strain
Told y'all everything would change

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That game, everybody win
That lane, everybody in
You gon' wait a min'
Nowadays everyone pretend
Only thing new is your friends
Singing in the club, every song comprehend
Throwing hella dubs that I don't gotta spend
But I just got some new bills
Got into a new deal
Got into some new wheels
Looking for a spin
So tell me what's new
What's everybody looking at?
Looking ass niggas all looking for the puddycat
Looking ass bitches all love it so they looking back
Booking info in your bio, where you booking at?
That's new
Can I see a blue moon in the star light?
A star who ain't doomed by the bright lights
I'm tryna do something for the new year
And I think I see a few here

[Hook]
