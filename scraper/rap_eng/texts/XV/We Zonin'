[XV - Intro]
You know what it is Vizzy Zone
Heres what I need y'all to do

[Hook]
Go close your eyes put your hands in the sky
And if anybody ask why
Tell em we zonin’, zonin’, zonin’
Nigga we zonin’. zonin’, zonin’
Yes sir why you got your hand by your side
Teacher try to say we couldn’t fly
Tell em we zonin’, zonin’, zonin’
Ready we zonin’. zonin’, zonin’

[XV - Verse 1]
Came in the game like an arcade change machine
So you know it’s gonna make sense (cents)
Rock tee’s like shiva
Leave 8 prints
Walk out the booth petrol see 8 prints
I’m a beast uncaged, leave me untamed
Then you rapping about gun gangs is getting mundane
Get out your one lane and hit the runway
So empower nigga soaking up the suns way
Ay, got a pretty young thing
Who wanna get drunk and do a couple dumb things
Baby girl wet walking out of club rain
And if your girl wanna come I ain't gonna complain
Lets zone, meadowlands baby we taking the jets home
Tell your man baby I’m going with X home
Ice cold now lets roll like an ice roll
Lets go…

[Hook 2]
Go close your eyes put your hands in the sky
And if anybody ask why
Tell em we zonin’, zonin’, zonin’
Nigga we zonin’. zonin’, zonin’
Yes sir why you got your hand by your side
Teacher try to say we couldn’t fly
Tell em we zonin’, zonin’, zonin’
Baby we zonin’. zonin’, zonin

[XV - Verse 2]
Quit weaving success we are on a fast track
Hope you niggas took your last nap
Came with a flow so ill they took up the (?)
‘fore I got up in your ear like I’m on the (?) tracks
Abs, any x yeah, Shy little dude, quiet as baby steps
Still stay strapped like a summer lady's dress
Cuz I came from the hood and all of that crazyiness
Birds wanna chill, I tell em go and make a nest
I’m still getting right, haters can make a left
And I be getting stares like a nigga making steps
Making instrumental tapes instead of me taking tests
Never the laziest I just play the bat like a cornrow
Up in niggas comments til the store close
With a broad rose (?)
Give that boy a hand, call him Goro

[Hook 2]

[XV - Verse 3]
Back when I used to have to read rainbows
And niggas still used to rock Master P tank though
Then I came in the game that had to be saved
The X in the box, master chief Halo
I just know I deserve the dream
As much as the queen deserve a king
As much a nigga doing dirt
Cause of a ring around the collar
And the nigga thats snitching deserves a sling
I mean from the deuce one zone like a two three
Home is a new sleeve
And I come through the air like a phone booth and blue teeth
Dropping feelings from my fingers like a new ring
Lets zone, we are so ready
Even the ones that went slow like Eddie
Buckle up for the ride put your hands in the sky
Cross all your tees and just close your eyes

[Hook 2]
