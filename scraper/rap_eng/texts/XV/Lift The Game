[Verse 1: XV]
Yeah, curtain close, throw your rose
The night is early, let's make a toast
The sales figures bring smiles to well wishers
Bring frowns to frail niggas, the town is there with ya
The city say remember when radio ain't give Vizzy play?
Now they read the shit I say like I was Earnest Hemingway
Funny how the square that could never really fit it
Got so many people riding, I don't know if they'll all fit in
They tell me move to New York like it's so fatal
Keep your plane ticket, I brought tow cables
I'm so able to prove 'em wrong motherfucker
Cause the kid from Smallville going show all how I'm gonna go and…

[Hook]
Lift this game up and bring it back to where I fucking live
I'mma lift this game up and bring it back to where I fucking live
Cause I'mma be the one that put us on motherfucker
Now get out the park and bring this shit home motherfucker
We on yeah, tell my city we on-we on

[Verse 2: XV]
So I'm banging on a trashcan, drumming on a street light
'Bout time I left here, everything don't seem right
Rocket packs are fully charged, the moon and stars that would be ours
Home is where you find your heart and at this point, I'm up on Mars
Look where we were raised, look what mom was paid
Look at what they gave us and look at what we made
So when it comes to grind, you can't tell me a fucking thing
When I've been making my whole city wait for the day that Imma…

[Verse 3: XV]
No acceptance speeches, I don't really need it
Cause I've never been accepted by the people who seek it
We try to make history with hopes we get to see
The faces of the ones we knew in school that used to teach it
Goodbye to nine-to-fives, hello 24/7's
In your first 15 minutes, you can not waste a second
I came to make my presence, I'm a real rapper
The story of your life, to me it’s just a little chapter
This for the masses who cut classes
Not to sit on their asses but do our homework so we pass it
Kids go to school through more seasons than M*A*S*H did
We just wanna get there, pick the road that's the fastest
We shoot rockets, plug sockets with foreign objects
Go this-a-way and don't participate in trend and topics
It seems like being outside us was our only choice
So I make sure I stay gold, Ponyboy
Trying to be world stars, they push their views on us
But we try to stay away from being what you want us
The streets get hotter than a June Summer
But don't tell me I should move nigga ‘cause Imma-cause Imma…
