[Verse One] [XV]:
Look
I'm a phone without minutes
Who would have called it
That I would manipulate the game like Saw did?
Ice box, Vizzy, I am so cold
And 'bout to shake up the world like a snow globe
My flow is no toes all you know is no fair
The boys are making issue that I came out of nowhere
But Hollywood is my destination, I am so Square
I swear nothing can hurt me, this hero is so clear
Jeah
Over exaggeration but I
Feel like I haven't worked a 9-5 since '95
This has been a dream all of my life
Pushing a broom through MCI trying to memorize my rhymes
Spitting heat like I did that with Fire Flowers
And I came from the dirt, don't I deserve some shine?
Told y'all What I Got, no Sublime
So I'm waiting on the I'm next hip hop line
They told me

[Hook]:
One sec
Please hold
You are important to us...we know
But not yet
Please hold
We'll tell you when you can go, go
One sec
Please hold
You are important to us...we know
But not yet
Please hold
We'll tell you when you can go, go

[Verse Two]:
Name unlisted, nobody listens
Back of the line, everybody else dissing
Guess I'll go home where I'll roam in my role, playing two player video games all alone
Sad ain't it?
Nah
Cause I was born with this Identity, call me Matt Damon
Wheel Of Fortune playing, tell 'em pick a vowel
Cause I'm the dude you gotta owe when I put on my town
They told me grow up Peter Pan, now look
Everybody 'bout to be knowing the hooks
Took it long for them all to figure out what it took
Never underachiever, always overlooked
In it for eight years and the shit is insane
Call you, don't call us, ain't even give 'em my name
Even Solid couldn't pick my brain
Paid my dues and got nothing back
Some shit don't change but ummmm

[Hook]
One sec
Please hold
You are important to us...we know
But not yet
Please hold
We'll tell you when you can go, go

[Verse Three] [El Prez]:
I went from the call center to the center of the calls
Now everybody wanna lick the sweat from my balls
Went from boos to applause, now curtain calls
Now all these sharks biting in the water, Jaws
Everybody wanna be I, y'all
Get crossed out like the eyes that cause
Draws, y'alls, niggas better recognize
And see that I'm good at raising lah, lah, lah, lah
Where all the haters gonna spit blah, blah, blah, blah
On how they ball but couldn't Converse they Grandma ma ma
I was catching an oop from 'em
Get off my Larry Johnson
You Rebels ain't Running
Ish
I'm top gunning
It's
El Prez and Mr. XV and pause
But these niggas too nuts like testes
Y'all, wait a minute
Just get used to it
Hold on and listen to this elevator music
