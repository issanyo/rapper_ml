[Hook: XV]

My shit bang man I'm on my third eviction (2x)
I'll be on the block if you wanna listen (2x)
My shit bang man I'm on my third eviction (2x)
I'll be on the block if you wanna listen
I'll be on the block block block

[Verse 1: XV]

I let my family down, no cap and gown
My momma kicked me out, ain't crack a smile
I said I'm rappin' now, ain't no backin' down
Just moved a couple packs, my bags was out
My homie asked me, "whats gone happen now?"
Said, "let's get a mic and we"ll just ride it out"
Burnin' loud shit is bangin' turn it loud
Neighbors saying "turn it down" but we can't
And we just turnin' up, and we just turnin' up
And we keep gettin' older but we far from growin' up
They said we couldn't fly now those wings have opened up
L7's in the sky you look up and know it's us
And we keep turnin' up and we keep turnin' up
And we keep gettin' hotter but we far from burnin' up
They said the sky's the limit but we know it ain't enough
You see that L7 then you better know it's us
L7 turn it up

[Verse 2: XV]

Landlord trippin' and the rent due
I've been hustlin' beats just to get through
Late nights niggas try to hit you
You don't know the things that I've been through
Neighborhood watchin' through they windows
My woes outside blowin' endo
Politicin', strategizing [?]
We walkin' to the door saw this pink note, damn
Third eviction
Another one?
Still Banging
Third eviction

[Verse 3: XV]

Bangin' on the trash can, drummin' on the street light
Block sound like Afghan, tell me how you sleep nights
When you tuck yo youngin' in
And kiss him and tell him sleep tight
Knowin' that them bullets flyin' by his bedroom each night
So he turns his speakers up
Teachers ain't teachin' us
Cops out here beatin' us
No tellin' when this lease is up
Until yo debt is deep enough or pockets even up
Keep you down long enough you never bring it up
I was on the web like Spider-Man first edition
Labels saw a square but never the Squarian vision
I've been in worse conditions, than my current position
And I'm still bangin', after my third eviction
