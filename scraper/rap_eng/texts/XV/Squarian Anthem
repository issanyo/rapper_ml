[Intro]
Square nigga, I made the rules
They sold me don'ts and I paid the dues
Never been no bookworm, I got bad grades in school
I did some juvi time, for having a fader do
But I never let this shit make me cause I ain't no fool
I'm super deep, you baby pool
You at my show but you ain't gon' move?
Well fuck your circle, y'all way too cool

[Hook: XV]
We just want to ball
Plaques up on our wall
Get it then we gone
We dont mess with y'all
Who be hating when you talk
Waiting for my fall
See you in the hall
We don't mess with ya'll
Fuck your circle (hey hey)
We don't mess with ya'll
Fuck your circle (hey hey)
We don't mess with ya'll
Fuck your circle (hey hey)
We don't mess with ya'll
We don't mess with ya'll
We don't mess with ya'll

[Verse 1: XV]
You got plugs but no spark, flood the streets no ark
Acting like you on top of the building, I got your feeling like Joe Clark
The kid next from the midwest with a pimp chest, cold heart
I don't play in married, I play Mario Kart
I Oscar T, I'm 3-1-6, I'm 21st, I'm Grove Park
I'm Spike Lee meets Shock G, meets Rauschenberg, meets Mozart
I see your circle and throw darts, I'm so sharp like Tone Stark
In a suit in front of a flow chart, you root beer, all bark
Wings fall like pillow fights, a Polo card', need Den10 on flights
At the same pace of a John Woo flick, tell my niggas kick back, let the don do this
I'mma kill the game no blood on the scene just a glove in my jeans and a Bronco whip
Poetry like a bongo hit and the bong I rip help the song I spit
L7 we fly the jet with no idea how high we get
My father left but brother's right so now you know how fly we get
Love, life, and loyalty and living long like legends
Thats all that I be reppin', that's that L7 nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sez Batters]
Tell me who's better with the ball motherfucker if it ain't me
Cause they breeze past, over heads arms up
Catch me in my zone like a Saint's t
Thats T plus E
Just means that I ate their circles
The square don't care man I ain't no urkel
Swear thats truth from all the tattoo
They red, the heat blue from beating up the beats 'til he made them purple
Picasso hot flow, Im on top though
Might break at the chicks like Roscoe
But couldn't prepare to move the 'caine like Lotso
Where your buzz bitch?
These bars who does this?
Got some 3-16s they love this but these birds want a peace no dove shit
I'm above this, game on (game on)
Think it's fun in the sun but I've been on the run ever since a nigga came home
Back at it again with a pad in a pen going in like I came home
You see what I did there? On top but I've been here
L7's are we in here?
Thought so, we blew up like cop clothes
Never been a bad boy on cops though
Put Seagal in the mall, I'll cop those
My kicks sick, we shaking the game, no hit stick
They broke the game, we fixed it
Cause we Squarians, and we live this

[Hook]
