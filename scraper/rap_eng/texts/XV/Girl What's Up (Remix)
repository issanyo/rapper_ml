Cause I can be your friend 'til the end

Girl give me this last dance
So we soul escapin' babe
Don't wanna float away
Cause we got the light
You be the ball and I'ma be the chain gang
Booty (round and round and round)
You got no where to go babe

Illuminate and create a new thang

Let em paparazzi this you and me thang
But we can't do a thing til I know your name

[Chorus: Usher]

[Verse 4: XV]
Welllll
My name's X Vizzy but the chicky's call me X
And if your girl friend met me now you probably call her "Ex"
Show me the bus cause MTV said I was next
Generally 'bout my meals, yeah I still get the checks
So I fly to Tokyo, 12 hours on the jet
With a fresh Japanese chick that I just met
Bow gracefully just to show my respect
Then said, {Japanese}

[Outro: Usher]
What's your name?
{Japanese}
What's your name?
{Japanese}
I wanna know who you are and make you a star
Girl, I'm giving you everything cause my love is yours
