[Verse 1]
I've done it all from trap to EDM
In third person, I don't wanna see him
So I'm rehearsing' some new verses over BM's (right)
My A&R thought the stars was I'm seeking (nah)
My city saw my situation like damn
There was no lyin' in his bars about the MGM
Peekin' through these Vegas windows in the P.M
Bright lights is all I'm seeing
And it's hard to see the stars so I guess that was one reason
Trying to reach'em, as they kept it all from me
Question whether you want me, for my message or money
They thought they changed off but they thought wrong
Fucking way off, the pay-off is I ain't gone
I put that fucking J on, then I take my J's off
My shorty roll a J up, I turn on the Jay Hawks
Red up, blued up (whaddup), head up, shoed up (whaddup)
Suit up, head down, they can't really do much (uh-huh)
That was all underground so I tried to Square stuff
But then niggas wanna talk down so I had to Square up
That's how a lost child found himself in JDF
Looking at my mom, hoping I can live with regrets
I heard

[Hook](2x)
This is the number one rule for your set to stay alive
Don't be something that you'll live to regret
On the rise to the top, many fly, don't forget to stay alive
Don't be something that you'll live to regret

[Verse 2]
I do this for my brother lock down, who has to walk 'round
Cell blocks, hearing 'bout how I'm putting on for the town
Prison garments tarnish how honest my nigga is
Can't see his soul in the hopes of being with his kid
But I'm observant, so I stream it like a current
Through my verses, that I word it
For my nephew that ain't heard it
When he's old enough to hear it
Find a speaker, put him near it
Let him know it was never an intentional disappearance
I know that he would trade it all
If regrets could be pawned
I promise we would be fucking on
Or would I trade all these nights that I'm tipsy
And don't remember a thing for some days that are empty?
Or would I exchange my work for some fun
Or my girl for some girls that will work for some ones?
Gone in my thoughts at the table, I just lost my bet
Guess I'm learning how to live with regrets
