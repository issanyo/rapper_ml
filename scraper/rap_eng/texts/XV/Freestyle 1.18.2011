[Verse One: Sez Batters]
I'm in love with that green like a racket
That's tennis, do you get it? Better practice
While y'all niggas sleeping on that money like a mattress
I'm living out my dreams, sticking the green like a cactus
If money rules the world I want my pockets like an atlas
Couldn't even get to my level boy if you mapped it
Howie knows, I'm the real deal, get a Vlasic
Cause even in the end, I'mma ball, ask a basket
I got this
I'm at a different height B
I can make it reign/rain like May's weather/Mayweather
So these lames wanna fight me
Fans think I left, but I was getting right B
To find a nigga like me I promise that's unlikely
I might be
Planted in the house, I guess I'm homegrown
I am in the realest state/real estate
Feeling like a home show
Breezing through these women but I'm getting super dome though
I'm trying to be rich boy, what you think I'm in my zone fo'/Zone 4?
Hatin' while I'm skatin', better know I got a cold flow
Watch what you say, things might get wild
So watch your tone loc/Tone Loc
I am never slipping, I've been in it for a minute
If you didn't know by now boy, I get it, get it, get it
So stay up in your lane
I'm about my game
Domo arigato is all you gotta say
My shoe game's Toronto, all about them J's
I'm a king like a bronco, this is where I reign
Batters in the sky
Yeah, I got my name up
Bighead nigga, don't socialize with you lame fucks
They was hating on me in the game before I came up
Didn't want a picture/pitcher, now they want a change up
I'm beating the beast, you've seen 'em
Relax, I'm kicking my feet up
I'm hotter than 20 fevers
A marching band couldn't beat him
No frontin' but I'm the leader
Winning by several meters
I'm kicking, I'm ripping, I'm kicking more bars than [?]
2000
I'm wowzing
You couldn't be above I/eye, homie you're only browsing
Got the game on lock/Lox the way that I'm always stylin'
Ladies screaming for me now they hoarse/horse just like a stallion
Call me Robert Townsend

[Verse Two: XV]
Look
Now you're in the presence of a winner
Not a rude house guest, I'm as pleasant as I entered
Autographing your ticket just so you remember me
And stay in my city, I'm as epic as a center
Chip on my shoulder and a hunch on my back
Sounds like Uncle Fester made it home for dinner
Grey Pouponing niggas
Pardon me fam
Sonning/sunning them
Leave 'em with a Pauly D tan
Life handing me lemons I made some money off it
Songs started leaking like a fucking running faucet
I took advice from my homeboy Marcus
When shit get rocky, get high and bungee off it
Geronimo
Finally made it, even if my come up was kinda slow
For the people that rolled, 40 Days, 40 Nights
I'm bringing 'em all home on this Squarian flight
Teacher said I used to be so mean
But read those magazines and I'm apparently nice
With the shit that I write/right
Outdid my wrongs
Scared to die but more scared to outlive my songs
So I
Dream on aeroplanes bumping Aerosmith
Cheating death and stealing life
Eddie Guerrero shit
So you know I gotta spit that habanero shit
Till I'm in the same place that the Pharaohs went
Vizzy
