[Verse 1: Erin Christine]
This morning, everything was quiet, staring at the ceiling
I knew I had been lying cause I let my ego keep me away
First you kept it to yourself, we both couldn't admit it
But you make my heart melt so eventually, we did it

[Hook]
When you tell me how you feel, I don't know how to take it
I don't know how to take it, I don't know how to take it
When I tell you this is real, it makes me feel naked
It makes me feel naked, it makes me feel naked

[Verse 2: Erin Christine]
Just last night, I wanted to call you, let the flame ignite
But some how all I could do was paint the picture in my mind
First you kept it to yourself, we both couldn't admit it
But you make my heart melt so eventually, we did it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
I hope I'm not just love drunk and I hope I'm not saying too much
But just for me to say this to your face, I was waiting two months
And if we break fast, I won't make it through lunch
But it was hard for me to hold off when you the thick type like the bold font
And dressing well, why would I want your clothes off?
And if you try stocks, don't ever buy into the girl talk
Monopolize the game and buy a boardwalk, I just hear about
How you never could, never would and never have
And how your man bounce like a check that wouldn't cash
But if you be my Harvey Dent, that's my better half
One day, I'll put you in a ring like Everlast

[Bridge: Erin Christine]
Now I know that I've been lying to myself
Underneath that's how I felt, now can you handle it?
Boy, can you get with it? I'm gonna need some help
If there's really no one else so tell me you're loving it

[Hook 2X]
