"Hey!
Been trying to meet you"

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]

Pay attention to me like ADD cost
Make believe is crazy to a boss but I pay to be free
Take it easy this rap game is Adebisi
Like twig and dinosaurs I would rather be me
Told the kids in Harlem I'm on a track with XV
They all said "Blowout? Let's see."
I said "Chill Harlem world I'mma rep it right
Have 'em writing for the rest of the night"
You guessed it right
The crystal ball, the magic 8 ball
Farrakhan X on the track with Adolf
Graduation cap is way off
Listen y'all call me the wicked witch of Witchita
Piss me off then you getting tossed in the pot... Stoffer
Nothing comes closer to home it's closer
You turn mics on my woody it's over
Could be sick dosages of looking in and over my shoulder
XV, you're mister two letters my Jansport is digital
A different hue never mind let's not go that far
Up to space taking kodaks of stars

[Hook] XV

I was just about to come out of my room
I was gonna turn off my X-Box too
I was gonna step out the whip in a fresh outfit
And then I went and thought about you
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind

[Verse 2: XV]

Chuckie said his song must of touched me like Andy
Child's play, video games coming in handy
XV seems like I've been 15 for 10 years
I guess there's more to my name no mandy
And if that is not family at my doorbell
You're not in my box like both mail (?)
Nevermind like the album on which Kurt whaled
Peer pressure I'm about to give usual winners their first L
I'm here now never needed a break shit i need to break out city of the state
Hey but my xbox gets me like "please don't quit me, even gave you red rings and you still went to fix me"
Came and scored 49k let's hit 50
And i got an album to make, no biggie
Plus a mixtape dropping and i got em all iffy
Can't blame em cause they all know Vizzy and

[Hook] XV

I was just about to come out of my room
I was gonna turn off my X-Box too
I was gonna step out the whip in a fresh outfit
And then I went and thought about you
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind

[Bridge] XV

I was like "ima be gone so long i forget what my home look like"
I was like "ima sit in traffic just blasting my music while i chill in my ride"
I was Like "ima see the girl of my dreams and this time I'mma say hi"
I was Like this close to, supposed to, thinking i might, nevermind
