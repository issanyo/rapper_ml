[Intro] [XV talking]:
Run it. I don't care. I know I might get a few people angry with this one...or confused. But that's what art is right? Expression. So I'm going to express myself. Hahaha. I don't got no snaps in me but...look

[Verse One]:
Came in the game, you know damn well
I had this game all in control like a handheld
Remote control, hope that soul comes back in a hurry
But James Brown and Isaac Hayes passing got me worried
Kids don't know an MC from a McFlurry
And rappers started dancing like You gotta serve me
I know it's all funny, they just kids
But come on and ride the train in my day, came and just went
Isn't it Ironic
I listened to Alanis Morissette before The Chronic
And that's just being honest
Wasn't from the 'burbs, just a nerd reading comics
With a bunch of girlfriends but they all were platonic
Maybe I don't got it
But I ain't giving in
This is my opinion and nobody can knock it
And I ain't on no Ice-T shit, what hip hop is
I'm just trying to make people stand up like comics

[Hook]:
Shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
All I see these niggas doing is a shuck and jive
They just shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
It don't matter anymore if you can't fucking rhyme
Long as you shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
All I see these niggas doing is a shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
Stand the fuck up nigga and have some fucking pride

[Verse Two]:
So if you nigga start a movement like Gena 6
To be on Myspace showing off ridiculous
Flow A, B, C like controllers on Genesis
That's when I know it's more than just me being envious
Baby powder niggas spitting that is not crack
You fools on youtube like that's not Smack
And I ain't trying to confuse or do backpack rap
Fuck that I'm trying to bring the Rap Pack back
You ain't soulful fool
You got as much soul as the soul/sole on the shoes of a homeless dude
And I understand
There's fans out in the stands throwing up their hands so it must be in demand
So you think you can rap, then come and test me
Nah, you need to be on so you think you can dance
Here's some shoe polish nigga, paint on your face
I ain't trying to judge, I'm just stating my case
While y'all...

[Hook]:
Shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
All I see these niggas doing is a shuck and jive
They just shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
It don't matter anymore if you can't fucking rhyme
Long as you shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
All I see these niggas doing is a shuck and jive
They just shuck and jive
Shuck and jive
Stand the fuck up nigga and have some fucking pride

[Outro] [XV talking]:
Yeah. And that's just interpretation of the situation. You see, hip hop is an art form right? It's a way of expression. But there's a difference from expressing yourself...in dancing...and somebody who told you to act like a god damn fool. You see, you think everybody laughing with you.and having a good time with you. But they laughing at you! Look at you! Hahaha. I'm just speaking the truth man. Yeah
