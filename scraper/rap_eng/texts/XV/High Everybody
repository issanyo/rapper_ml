[Intro]
High, high, high, high
High, high, (Hello muthafucka) high, high

So I'm a need hands (high)
Ladies (Hi)
Fellas (Hi)
Tell Everybody "Hi"
Everybody high
High, high, high, high
Everybody high
High, high, high, high

[Verse 1]
I'm a tell everybody "hi," everybody hello
Is everybody high, is everybody mellow
I dance with the devil, fell asleep with an angel
She woke up horny and then we played Halo, Master Chiefin'
Pass the reefer to people that's believin'
Drop tees for these events, now we getting even
Put Vizzy in the dictionary, the kids need meaning
While they was gettin' sleep in, I was living, dreaming
They tried to pop like a quiz, trying to test me
As I carved my name on the lid of my desk
Just another kid from the mid to the west
With a heart full of passion, pumping big in his chest
Yes, keep it controlled on ten of my toes
Give'em a show as colorful as Vincent Van Gogh
Let'em inhale, like the evils open the door
Heaven sent with the flow
I just thought you should know

[Hook]
Cause I started from the bottom
So they know where I'ma go
When I get to the top I know
I'll tell everybody "hi"
"Til everybody hi

So I'm a need hands (high)
Ladies (Hi)
Fellas (Hi)
Tell Everybody "Hi"
Everybody high
High, high, high, high
Everybody high
High, high, high, high
(Hello)

[Verse 2]
Where you been Vizzy? Your Tumblr feed is tumbleweeds
It's Spring time, that's when I turn to bumble bee
That means I'm buzzin' and my city shocker yellow
Girl's who think they landing Donovan but I'm no soccer fellow
Say "hello." To the whole world when I was nobody
Doing shows pulling hoes that was so snotty
Out in Memphis, getting faded like I'm Yo Gotti
Never parking, I belong in drive like old floppy
No copy sold, but never been no copy
Got beams and I never met no Scotty
Your ho tell you she was in that hotel lobby
And sloppy-toppy in the droppy is her real hobby
Just a few bars for rappers that might feel cocky
Thinking they can pop me, but they'll never stop me
Try to block my goals but I still got'em
Ball 'til I fall like it's Autumn

[Hook]
