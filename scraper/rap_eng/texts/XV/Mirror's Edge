It feels like I’m running on walls and I don’t wanna touch the ground
And if they say that I’m lost, then I don’t wanna be found
It feels like I’m running on walls and I don’t wanna touch the ground
And if they say that I’m lost, then I don’t wanna be found
I’m on the mirror’s edge

[Verse 1: XV]
Look, my life is unbelievable, even though, sometimes I wanna leave and go
And find a job, I’m so odd, still I got an even flow
Quiet kid, keep it low, mouth is closed, wanna scream his soul
Till I’m in the place where the reapers go, I’m running on walls and leaping poles
My eyes are closed and all I know is I just don’t ever-ever-ever wanna ever fall down
Never-never-never will I touch that ground
I feel so high when girls say hi and I can’t hear ‘em all
The crowd is loud, the flash is massive balling all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
I was never like the rest of ‘em, shit, I didn’t even mess with ‘em
They all came part of the roster, I came in a flying saucer
Them dudes be like who is he? Them girls be like that’s Vizzy
My line is always open but I still get so busy, now dig me
Sometimes I ask how I have got in here
Life wasn’t always sunny but I found time to shear, yeah
Even though this height is lovely, I know gravity got a crush on me
But until that time I’ll be fine ‘cause…

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
What goes up must come down
That’s the laws of physics, so I won’t stick around
Remind them clowns of that, I just hope ya’ll got my back
When I stage dive from days sky, I brought a rocket pack
So I fly from the winter to the summer, come up find how I do
My career springs ‘cause I’m hot and you fall trying to get cool, get it?
Gon and ask how I did it, flying through the sky with it
One day, we’ll all fall difference between me and ya’ll is I’ll admit it
