[Cassie]:
I'm addicted to you

[Verse One]
"I'm addicted"
That's what she said about my raps
Looking deep in my eyes over that IChat
Long distance girlfriend? I don't wife that
I just snapshot, Skype that
Turn off the lights like vision camera is action
You paparazzi famous so you used to flashing
So tell your friends to leave the room and don't come back in
I got enough trouble for you to get your ass in
Telling you what to do and I am not asking
Making you take off your shoes in such a fashion
Is she a model? Yes
Like Sasha Fierce? No
She exposing her breasts, her nipples pierced though
I told her, "Take off your top and do it real slow"
I give her credit like she acting in a film role
I'm taking stills of her standing still, still clothed
And by clothed I mean robed, spread eagle and expose like yoooo

[Hook]:
I'm addicted to you
Your my addition

[Verse Two]:
This here is dedicated to celebs, pics on Perez
Don't get mad shit, let's celebrate it
My girl Robin was sobbing I told her "drop it"
Don't worry about these R&B niggas, baby I got 'em
Good Girl Gone Bad
So she ain't got no problem taking pics of her ass
And make sure that you palm it
Damn
Another nipple ring?
That must be the new in thing
Vizzy keep girls screaming, the new N'SYNC
No homo like dudes in pink
Cassie baby you cool, but Rihanna finer
Said she would have done full body but couldn't find the time of
So she used a mirror, panties on looking decent
So wet the pictures just started leaking
Ha, oh
And shouts to Mike Wax
And all the camera phones and girls who like that
Cause

[Hook]:
I'm addicted to you
Your my addition
