[Hook]:
If mixtapes should die before this tape
I'm giving extended life with every copy I make
Go and say, "Fuck the R.I.A.A."
Go and say, "Fuck the R.I.A.A."If mixtapes should die before this tape
I'm giving extended life with every copy I make
Go and say, "Fuck the R.I.A.A."
Go and say, "Fuck the R.I.A.A."
Mixtapes just died this morning and they dead
They dead

[Verse One]:
Yeah, they wanted mad exclusive
Coming in giant stadium, parking lot
Summer Jams, three miles of smiles covering every isle
New tapes, Clue tape, freestyles
Spitting rhymes giving 'em lines to talk about
Hitting 'em with something before the album come out
Hitting 'em with something before the album come out
Hitting 'em with something before the album come out
Mix tracks, diss raps
Industry instrumentals flip back, we hint at
Upcoming beefs, announcing it like a dispatch
1-2, 1-2, I don't like you so get back
XV, the mixtape hero
4,500, pressed by Nero
80's babies, who's in your top five?
Is it Clue, Whoo-Kid, Kay Slay or Big Mike?

Mixtapes just died this morning and they dead
They dead

[Verse Two]:
I address my beef on 'em, speak on 'em
Dates for my album release on 'em, yeah
Never a fan of the radio
I was bumping Mick Boogie, Gangstagrillz, G-Unit Radio
Mood Muzik, waiting on another one
Mixtapes are dead so I don't expect another one
Running in studios, seizing CDs
Like DJ Drama had W.M.D.'s
To take down hip hop this is just one piece
Then they wonder why we say, "Fuck Tha Police."
I never really endorsed the saying Stop Snitchin'
Until it made DJ's stop mixing
If they don't make a profit then it's nonsense
But this is where your favorite rapper got started
If mixtapes died then I'm gonna try to give it CPR through this CD-R

{Crowd chanting "Justo"}

[Verse Three]:
Everybody chanting his name, this is why I came
To the conclusion, things ain't the same
It started from pausing tapes to what it is today
A target of the R.I.A.A
Without the backing of radio, is how I came
So I can't really deal with it just being slain
When we got Tru-Life, Lloyd Banks and Wayne
Royalty City, Dipset and Game
I was thinking of a way I could just get even
So I spit this rhyme cause I keep believing
In the tapes that have shaped hip hop like Play Doh
This is my philosophy like Plato
Everybody chanting along
Turning up the song
As my Ed Hardy turns to a Halo
I inhale and exhale with one breath
And return to the skies as an angel
