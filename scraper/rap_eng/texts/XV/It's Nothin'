[Verse]:
What you wanna be?
All out rapper? Part time gangsta?
Half way crooks? Full time wankstas?
I ain't calling out nobody, get your paper
As long as you ain't fucking with mine, I'll see you later
I don't be in Taboo
I don't be at Club Visions
I don't be at Flashbacks, I guess I don't fit in
Everybody changed once high school ended
Some went to college, I got on a plane with a vision
I'm sorry I don't party, I roll a little different
Got money off the truth while y'all screaming "Stop snitching."
I don't say "Stop snitching." I handle it like a soldier
Witness don't show up...
I shrug my shoulders
I was hustling before it was cool to do
Sold blue to the kids at school
Sold red Crayons, convinced the kids in my class it was blue
So this is nothing to me, I just breeze right through
