[Sample] {Florance And The Machine 'Cosmic Love'}
A falling star
Is out from your heart and landed in my arm
I scream aloud as it tore through them
And now it's left me blind

[Verse One] [Sikai]:
Came into the game, nigga no consignment
Lookin' like a villain from a hooptie with the bad alignment
Now tell me how it feel, is it murder mami?
Killin' all them hoes, I don't fuck with each and everybody
All of my endeavors whenever you niggas see me
I be killin' every record I'm reppin' for me and T. Armani
Nobody better if competition was sure to find me
That would be the day that I'd so erratically caught a body
I
Never sing
You dare to dream?
Confidence is the feelin', that's what lookin' in the mirror mean
I
Will never go
But you never know
Overlook the realest but you feel it on your radio
So for the moment we on it, I only owe it to myself
Pain killin' only niggas that help
I'm on my next level shit, sit one with X Vizzle baby
I'm a king and I shine bright
Touch you through the lime light
Like

[Hook]:
A falling star
Is out from your heart and landed in my arm
I scream aloud as it tore through them
And now it's left me blind

[Verse Two] [XV]:
And somehow
We keep goin' higher
Butterfly wings now she feelin' like Mariah
Higher than the highest parts of the Himalayas
Surfin' on the cloud, high fivin' the messiah
Baby mama
Steady losin' her mind but I can count on her
I calculate it while haters act like they challengers
With no soul leadin' close to my caliber
They better leave son Alone like the McCallisters
I
Wasn't so hood, just hung with wrong niggas like Rosewood
All bad, no good
And I
Had hope of reachin' peaks, mountains dude
But my dreams couldn't do what coke could
Damn
Even my teachers said I'm funny
Be realistic, I said, "No ma'am." Al Bundy
Huh, now I'm plunging in a bed full of honeys
It ain't too late to come up for air but since I'm fallin' guess I'm...

[Hook]:
A falling star
Is out from your heart and landed in my arm
I scream aloud as it tore through them
And now it's left me blind

[Verse Three] [Sikai]:
Church
I'm with the team like I might've made it
Although I don't condone friendly fire isn't tolerated
It's never pretty that these sniffers fuckin' nose all
Macaulay coke head, what you left him Home Alone for?
Now that's an overdose
Everybody that's over hopin' that I will fall the hell off
Lookin' like you were dead wrong
Severed at the neck, you buggin', I take your head off
Up early for the money, a gun and bowl of Kelloggs
I
Am not ashamed
You know the name
You mess it up, in control and you got no one to blame
I
Am so legit
But you counterfeit
They buggin' out cause I'm poppin' off, oh man image if
You owned the night, you lyin', sayin' I ain't got a gift
Put it on the line when I'm rhymin', I'll take a higher risk
You got no game where you from and you couldn't buy a bitch
Your boys are runnin', I'm comin' so who you dyin' with?
I admit

[Hook]:
A falling star
Is out from your heart and landed in my arm
I scream aloud as it tore through them
And now it's left me blind
