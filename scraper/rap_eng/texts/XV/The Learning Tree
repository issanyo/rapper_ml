[Intro]
Nobody say the sixteens can't be deep, right?

[Hook](2x)
Burning tree under the learning tree
Watching the words come to me

[Verse 1]
I heard words is often in black and white
But if I have learned anything in life is that ain't right
And I might have the mind of a child
And the eyes of a blind man all in my style
Thinking they ain't judged me by my skin
Before the green backpack and smile
Damn, cause I was raised black and proud
I, too sing "America", sang that shit loud
Didn't see colors of ignorance until my own crowd
Was down with bangin' a crew since '98 and who
Ever making the kick, we come through
And rob the place, then outlines get traced
Black bodies and white chalk and none of it was for hate
Just green means more than anything these days
Infa-beams will gleam when people scheme
To bring down anything with wings
Crash it into a building and think about what it means
Cause ignorance is bliss and everything ain't what it seems
