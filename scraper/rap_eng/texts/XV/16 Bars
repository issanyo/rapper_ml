[Intro: Sez Batters]
Yeah, Sez Batters I'm zoning
Yeah, Yeah They wanna know what I do with a sixteen!
Yeah Unh

[Verse One]
What these niggas do in a song, I do in a sixteen
Sez Batters I'm the baddest with the mixing
I mix a ill track with some mean lyrics
Now the bars got'em feeling like teen spirit
I'm show'em love then it's one serve
They saying I ain't back, they got some nerve
I'm sort of automatic with the rapping
I blew myself up Doctor Manhattan
Ladies love the way I lay it down smooth all satin
If you wanna roam/Rome gotta know the language stack Latin
Now she in the zone, I'm playing all-Madden
The game is in the genes/jeans never waste it by sagging
Heart made of stone and the soul of Excalibur
Granted my opponents I don't dodge no challengers
Never number two but my shit clean
And ain't nothing sweet but the sixteen
