There, there, baby
It's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up
There, there, baby
It'S just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up

[Verse 1: XV]
Three women raised me
Famous Footwear paid me not enough to blow up
But showed up cause I ain't fuckin' lazy
And teachers thought I was dumb or crazy or both
With hopes of being a Nas or Jay-Z
I slumped, in my chair and my grades, my head wasn't raised
Being fly was priority to the lowest
I would stand on my desk just to see the world
In a different way, the dead society of a poet
Homie I'm focused, but there's somethin that a dude can't prove
I mean fam, I was damn near invisible at school
So I banged for a minute cause all my niggas was crippin'
Just me and my two of my dudes, Blue Man Grouop
Had dreams of doing things they say that you can't do
Cause everything ain't black and white, 'less you chew bamboo
So I was after big bills like a toucan do
All the while my mom askin' why I'm truant at school
She said

There, there, baby
It's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up
There, there, baby

[Verse 2: XV]
Uh, so why ain't I go to college
My mommas ultimatum made me say that I know I got it
My niggas said V's buggin'
Stay on your computer software, debugging
But we holding hardware cause we thuggin'
Now they in the trap-house with some guns that they done borrowed
And all this snow, I call it Infant Sorrow
With plans to reach the end even if I had to start slow
Sold CDs in the mall, making dough like Sbarro
Then I left the hood, like fuck it don't need the cargo
They banking I don't do well, and I don't mean Fargo
But even when you leave, somehow it still try to follow
Baby brother took a charge harder than LeBron and Rondo
Trying to keep his head up while his eyes are in the Bible
Cause they say a mind that's idle is a devil's toy aisle
My nephew looking at me cause his daddy is his idol
I looked at him, told him sit down, this information is vital, look

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Living my life like I'm living right
In the midst of a fire pit, the gang-banging and violence
Is the sweetest song and I roam with the heart of a violin
Don't violate my patience I'm waiting, to kill a man
As I stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
If I gotta eat, I steel like a metal piece
I'm screamin' out fuck the police
I'm dealing my cards with Jokers on em
You can disown him or stone him
I'm throwing them rocks back, with the fury of bullets
You couldn't live your life for the moment
When I'm foamin' at the mouth
And my sharpest of teeth showin'
I'm in the back of a black Buick finna black out
Like February, ain't that's how Blacks do it, right?
I cut off my ears before I hear your advice and vice versa
I'm screaming for help, as loud as I can but that's not working
I'm working them corners like blueprints
Then caught an L on my first offense
The judge threw the book at me and said this
