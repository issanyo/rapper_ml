[Intro: XV]
You see I cop a zip on Monday
Ain't scared to spend that money
Am through with it by Sunday
So you know I gotta load up that bowl
I love smoking that bowl, oh

[Hook: XV]
You see I cop a zip on Monday
Ain't scared to spend that money
Am through with it by Sunday
So you know I gotta load up that bowl
I love smoking that bowl, oh
I smoke joints Tuesday through Friday
Friday that's my high day
So Saturday through Sunday
Running low I gotta load up that bowl
I love smoking that bowl, oh

[Verse 1: XV]
I said I love loading that bowl
I love smoking that bowl
I love waking up love baking up blaze it up and get gone
I love when my girl smoke cause she can break up and have me one rolled
But I be running late and my stash be running low
So I give that bitch a name cause that's my name when I feel low
My wifey call it my high, but I just call it my zone
My moms call it illegal, my niggas call it cologne
See I can share it with others, but fuck that I hit it alone
And I get it when I need it just to get well
And I don't got time for a quick L
Cause I'm dealing with these demons cause I smoke with my fans
And I'm damned cause I let 'em all inhale
And I be too blunt for them new blunts
And I used to roll joints with my old joints
Who wanna see my but it's like E.T. without the ending that's no point
Think about that

[Verse 2: Freddy High]
Gotta love a nice J
Nice and tightly rolled
My niggas fuck with them Ls, but something 'bout that bowl
Time to load one up even if you have one rolled
The hotel can smell that zip but can't nobody tell me no
So Vegas here we go, the whole team fo' sho'
It's fight day the rhino L7 they should know
Now we enjoying life, while she enjoying that bowl
And her energy is kin to me and her ass is out of control
Fuck a dutch pack it up in a bowl real tight inhale smoke then let one go
Now we up in the sky plane view still high came through like I been here before
Just let me know in a way we go to a place that no one could go
Cause my flow still go inhale exhale anytime you smoking that bowl

[Verse 3: Sez Batters]
You know I love that bowl
Waking up to that bowl
Old general in my cereal
My bowl is next to my bowl
My lady sees my bowl and he say KFB and she know
I never love no tricks, unless they in my bowl
My niggas pitch that smack, I don't fuck with that though
Got Frosted Flakes and they grape pour 'em in and get gone
My girl brings my kicks down they cool greys if you know
Put 'em on my feet those loose bitches is cold
You know I love my Wheaties cause my neck is on
Lucky Charms on my wrist and my crunch is cinnamon toast
Candy Chex is so sweet, then puffing on the cocoa
Honey grab me a gram, and load it up in my bowl!
