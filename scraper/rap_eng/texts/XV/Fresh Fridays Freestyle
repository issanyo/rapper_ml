[XV]
I turned on the TV and saw Tyler eat a roach and make it
Then blow up overnight like girls I graduate with
I’m saluting young niggas with a dream
‘Cause it wasn’t all that easy when I was turning fifteen
See, back then, it was noodles in a cup and toast
Now celebrations at the Louvre, grab a cup and toast
A couple dudes misconstrued with my deals like they wanna chill, right?
‘Cause they don’t know what it feel like when dreams start to blend with your real life
Got angels on my side like Seal’s wife, Heidi
Illuminati want my mind, soul and body ‘cause these tracks get killed like Wild E Roddy
And I come from a block where I seen a dude get shot
While they rolled by like they had a Dai Lee
‘Cause I was a square with G’s in my circle
‘Cause I always kept it real on the street like a trolley
So what the chances is that this Kansas kid from a city where Barry Sanders lived
Could get a deal and start this thing called the Squarians?
Have them putting L7’s in the air again, arrogant
‘Cause modesty ain’t a policy, I’m accepting apologies from anyone who caught a Z
It’s kind of unfair to even call this dreams ‘cause real life, this is everything I thought it’d be
