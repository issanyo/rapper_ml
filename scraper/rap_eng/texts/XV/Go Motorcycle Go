[Mac Lethal talking]:
No officer. Everything is fine. I'm just going to beat your wife dead. Beat your wife dead

[Verse One] [Mac Lethal]:
Angel, Angel of Hell, Satan as well it's like
You can see the smoke screen beaming through the metal pipes
Spiked jacket better hide your wife and kids
Cause if I find 'em you're gonna have to hide your wife and kids, get away now
Gotta get that engine revving, cops are coming cause they see the patches on my jacket
Pull the rachets on them...faggots
I take 'em all apart and blow 'em like Mazucker
This is it, in the art of fucking motorcycle (madness)
Murder sail through the sky
On a chopper with the blood shot eyes
I'm immortal, no I must not, DIE DIE DIE DIE!
Kill a hooker, smoke a little crank into my lung
Got a chopper, got some shit to rob a bank inside my gun
Inside my chopper, my daddy never told my sister, "Smile Chelsey."
But I'mma give her Chelsey smile till your life is healthy
Roadside demon, Highway heathen
Kill a meth addict trucker every weekend
BAM!

[Hook] [Mac Lethal]:
So here, here we go, fuck it here we go like
Go motorcycle go, go motorcycle go
So here, here we go, fuck it here we go like
Go motorcycle go, go motorcycle go (what we got Mac?)
I got the psycho/cycle flow
Got the, got the psycho/cycle flow
I got the psycho/cycle flow
Got the, got the psycho/cycle flow
I got the psycho/cycle flow
Got the, got the psycho/cycle flow
I got the psycho/cycle flow
Got the, got the psycho/cycle flow

[Verse Two] [XV]:
In the midst of rappers wearing gymnast's jeans
I took a turn for the worst put a patch upon my sleeve
Throw a jacket on my bitch, and I'm back onto the scene
Like you tell, like a rabbits ass on my batch of keys
He's
Rhyming while he's defying lions, lambs, and rap gods
Rapping over A Milli, doing wheelies on back bars
Hello, my motos blowing smoke into the sky
No roof, so I can shoot up in the air and fly
I shed light on the hood like helicopters
Change the type on everything you type on the teleprompter
I'm the dude that they threw into
Middle school lockers
Came back riding through the halls on a metal chopper
Johnny Blaze, fire coming from my wheels
Come into the darkness, eat 'em up like Kryll
Lady in a red dress, Devil's on my heels
Ghost rider, rhymer find out I can not be killed

[Hook] [XV]:
So here here we go, fuck it here we go like
Go motorcycle go, go motorcycle go
So here here we go, fuck it here we go like
Go motorcycle go, go motorcycle go (what we got Mac?)
I got the psycho/cycle flow
Got the, got the psycho/cycle flow
I got the psycho/cycle flow
Got the, got the psycho/cycle flow
I got the psycho/cycle flow
Got the, got the psycho/cycle flow
I got the psycho/cycle flow
Got the, got the psycho/cycle flow
