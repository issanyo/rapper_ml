Sweet Sixteens man
That's all I got is Sweet Sixteens

[Verse 1]
Bait, bait, bait fool, let me put my city on
Bait, bait, bait fool, let me put my niggas on
L7's in LA, Squarians in Chi-town
This here is for all y'all
This here is for my town
Before I signed my deal, I kept them niggas eye's peeled
Now I fill they iTunes with highlights from my reel
That's bait
No cosigns and no looks
Just good lines and cold hooks
That got me signed and I took that
(Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait)
Well, thank you for the wait
Now it's time to scrape the plate
Like I ain't ate since '08
I see you date her, I bait her
Flow HAM as Donald Draper
Red gloves full of praises
For they handshakes full of favors
My shotty with the shotty, hit ya body it'll burn
I just tell Scotty 2 Hotty hit the worm
Cause you just look like
(Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait)
I got hooks, I got lines
Got'em hooked cause of the rhymes
Got that
(Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait)
I got the real, got the lime
Got your girl on my line
For that
(Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait)
