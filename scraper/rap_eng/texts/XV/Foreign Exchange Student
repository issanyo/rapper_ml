[Intro]
Yeah!
We on Squaria!
Hahahaha, yeah!

[Verse 1]
What planet did you come from?
With your nails, makeup, and hair done
At my show, hands up to the sun
Ask her what she’s doing when it’s done
So we gon' kick it, have a little fun
Play me in Street Fighter 4 and won
Chun Li kicks, hair in a bun
Marvelous sweats, All-Star Chucks
What you smoke? what you drink?
Green Ty-Ku? What you think?
Bra all black, panties pink
I’mma see that by the end of the week
We take it slow, I'll take you home
Your moms don't trip, cause, shit, you grown
She said "You gon' let me sleep alone?"
I said nah, she said, "Come on"

[Hook]
I don’t know just where you came from
I need you now
If you leave me for the stars
That's something something I'd never allow

[Interlude]
Oh, she cold
Yeah see, I knew she wasn’t from here
That’s why I call her Foreign Exchange Student
Cause she’s like fresh as fuck
Louboutins, Alexander Wang and all that
But at the same time, she plays Marvel vs Capcom 3
Listens to The Pixies religiously
And had like a 16 killstreak on Black Ops! Haha!

[Verse 2]
I don’t know your circle, circle
But you like this square right here
I know your ex hurt you, hurt you
But don’t be scared, be scared
I'll take you high, so high, up in the air, the air
George Clooney cool and I don’t Bugs, that’s Looney Tunes
You come backstage, my crew is cool
Mass Effect 2 and watch kung-fu
Grabbing these snacks like Scooby Doo
Smoke 'til your eyes like Lucy Liu
She knows I ball cause she asks for shots
Hit a triple double when I pass the Ciroc
If love is blind then I’m Matt Murdock
You ain’t going home, well I’m glad you not

[Outro]
To all the ladies
Or should I say, Squarian women out there that this applies to
I wish I could send you some beautiful flowers
Or a teddybear or something, but I can’t
So I’m gonna have Awesome Sound play the synth solo
Just for you baby, just for you, check it out
Is that vintage? Preferably
Swag, swag, swag, swag
