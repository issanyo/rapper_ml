[Verse 1]
Unh, the music up, the crew deep
Please pour me another cup of that blue drink
Fresh from a boutique, buying some new sneaks
Getting paper like trees in the fall, loose leaf
I never thought I rap in the end like Kool G
Now I got these girls packing up in my room G
I knew her, she knew me, it was ultramagnetic, yeah, Kool Keith
Success in how I'm dressing but I never blue cheese
Save for a couple blank tapes and new tees
From Tornado Alley, so you know we blew trees
Different school with my dudes, bring your girl and two friends
(Unh) And my mom gone
So I'm in the basement playing her my songs
Like "This shit crazy. Tell me that I'm wrong."
I swore I remember this day when I'm on
I said

[Hook](2x)
Listen to my new shit
Bring the stereo closer
We making noise in that basement
Tell your friends to come over

[Verse 2]
Unh, and we high like our first joint
Hold up, hit rewind on that first joint (play it back)
Playin' ball in the yard, I'm the worst point
But I'm the man in that NBA Jam
Give me a hand, let's bring down the big screen
For that Golden-Eye multiplayer game, split screen
She brought a controller over
Now we both up on the sofa, closer
Than Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall (unh)
Don't forget about me when your gone (unh)
I swear I must've played every song (song)
That I ever made (made), dang she like to ball (unh)
Put her favorite one on a CD before she leave
And a room full of all of our peeps, it's you and me
And the music is loud and we ain't tuning it down
You wanna see it, well we doing it now

[Hook](2x)

[Verse 3]
Unh, unh, and who'd believed
You was close to greatness like Christmas Eve
Take it to the max, no Zach, no Screech
Never do it little, do little Mr. Grieves
Is in camo shorts and white tees
Mickey D number twos and ice teas
How many in the basement I've seen
Come up for air, scared of pipe dreams
But I'm road raging, my drive mean
Prepared for whatever's ahead like high beams
Even though it might seem
Soon as I graduated, everything I read
Went away like Visine
The one's who grew up (up), the music went down (went down)
I throw the two up (two up), say "See you around." (waddup)
I know what you want, I know what you 'bout
But for now turn the music up loud
Cause we bout to be

[Hook](2x)
