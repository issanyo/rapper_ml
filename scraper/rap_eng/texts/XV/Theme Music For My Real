[Hook: Gerald Walker]
So this is theme music for my real niggas (real niggas)
This is theme music for my hustlers
The ones who grind hard cause they ain't tryin' to deal with it (deal with it)
Who only main concern is tryin' to double up
So keep doin' what you gotta do
What you gotta do
What you gotta do
Just keep doin' what you gotta do
What you gotta do
Is slow it down for you

[Verse: XV]
I wake up in the morn
How can I say my blessings when my seat belt wasn't on?
The car was flipped in seconds and we ended up on the lawn
A scratch is all I'm blessed with, funny how a thought is born
Then all it raises questions
Ask for answers from your mom
But she just quotes the pastor
When you ?? like Cappas you can't relate to those chapters
They say X never matters
And you can check the alpha-
-Bet that a W is the only thing that I'm after
Hope no relationship chatter and all our pockets get fatter
Trying to balance it out is like playing on a ladder
Got to a point where I was thinkin' nothin' really mattered
Hittin' parties in a T/tea, that boy Mad as the Hatter
So many doubted when I said that I'mma make it rappin'
Cause what makes you happy ain't always gon' make it happen
And when you facin' odds that you never thought of havin'
Just keep goin' and turn this up over them thoughts you havin'

[Hook]
