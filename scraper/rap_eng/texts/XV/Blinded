[Hook] [XV]:
Now I see those flashing lights
They sparkle in my eyes
So all I do is try (try)
To find my way inside cause I'm blinded by the lights
(Lights, lights, lights)
Cause I'm blinded by the lights
(Lights, lights, lights)

[Verse One] [XV]:
Look
I'm waiting outside of the club looking dumb cause I'm stuck in this line
I swear to Christ, thank God for McDonalds
Cause the Dollar Menu saved my life a couple of times
I'm the One Eyed King in the Land Of The Blind
Trying to break through the door like a fan of the Shining
Didn't know how to act on the job scene
So I sold beats, just like a side thing
Everybody been sleeping on me so long you would think they would realize my dream
I be on the road like Sonic but as soon as I hit a block they wanna take my rings
I never saw beauty in the lights
But today I just might cause they look so blinding
I just hope I stay clear like a medic chest kit
So I brought my Visine

[Hook] [XV]:
Now I see those flashing lights
They sparkle in my eyes
So all I do is try (try)
To find my way inside cause I'm blinded by the lights
(Lights, lights, lights)
Cause I'm blinded by the lights
(Lights, lights, lights)

[Verse Two] [XV]:
Went from Smallville to Metropolis
I was blinded by the lights so I never looked at college
They said, "Don't go into the light." (why?)
Cause when you do you go into the life
And you ain't ready, even 'Ye went crazy
When people don't even know me and they say they hate me
And ever since they talked about girls degraded
The video/girl rate has slightly downgraded
I sho' would do the girl with a very nice shape
And an alright face and they'll say he'll take it
Cause they can get steak no matter how it taste
Just the fact that you don't really wanna waste it
So I can't say that I don't wanna make it
Can't go back to selling weight out the Day Inn
Trying to get rid of all those memories like the Haitian
And now I know my destination

[Hook] [XV]:
Now I see those flashing lights
They sparkle in my eyes
So all I do is try (try)
To find my way inside cause I'm blinded by the lights
(Lights, lights, lights)
Cause I'm blinded by the lights
(Lights, lights, lights)

[Verse Three] [Harlem's Cash]:
Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles
I'm blind to it all
Viagra, up for so long
Niagara, hope I don't fall
Looking back, they all said I was too small
Now look who's surprised I started to ball
Nah
Not like Chris Paul
More like I just pissed all Cristal
Shitted out the fruits of my labor
Flash the wrist shit, look like a light saber
Chewbacca, chinchilla for all the Lalas
Dark shades on
Darth Vader
Fought with white dudes with green paper
Who probably wouldn't want me as a neighbor
But if it suits me I'll get tailored
With a Style so Sheek make 'em think Jada
Wasn't easy, had to think BASA
Put myself to use and no not waste a
Talent I was given
Now I'm so driven, I chauffeured but I'm still back in ?
