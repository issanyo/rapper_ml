[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I been here long before
I’ll be here long after you’re bored
Goodbye, I’m moving on
Goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye
The best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye
The best is yet to come

[Verse 1: XV]
Look here, who appear
Me oh my, well-well
Story of the Kansas boy
Everybody tell tales
I’m so vocal, could have worked at T-Mobile
Cause I got so many bars
I could probably sell cells
My city follow me cause I will never fail whale
Word is bond man
I could probably bail jails
I am back in black, Hells Bells
Team full of winners, nigga we can’t even spell L’s
I came to entertain and I am doing damn well
Y’all phoning in
Alexander Graham Bell
Hang it up like twelve nails
Ff you can’t tell
This is that wrapping up orchestra music, farewell

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
I know it all comes to an end
That’s something I can’t deny
So I ain’t even gonna try to lie
But I can put on in the end and the outcome’s a lion
So I just live my life like the outcome is dying
And it is but I can’t count my days like a Mayan
And my home is like my own little island
Try to go outside and search to find my own little Zion
But I don’t really like what I am finding
To make sense of why I’m still trying
I guess it’s called grinding
Hunting for the stars
You can call me Orion
Well I ain’t trying to sell what everybody else is buying
I just find comfort in the fact that I’m arriving
To the conclusion of who wins when you went through every hoop
They threw at you like you hula-hooping and this is all I wanted
Go to Kansas and tell them I have done it, I love it because

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
How is he who he is
All I know is these is trying times
And dying rhymes bring the life like de-fibs
Holy moley gee whiz, school of hard knocks
I’m sitting where the Dean is
You wonder my feet is
I came to exercise the game like a Wii Fit
Tell everybody wave till the whole stage is seasick
We are the champions
Now tell me where my queen is
Life versus living but I visit where my dreams is

[Hook]
