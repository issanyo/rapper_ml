[Intro] [XV Talking]:
I dedicate this song to all the allures in the world. What is your high? You say you don't smoke, you say you don't drink. So what you do? What is it in your life you can't live without? Everybody has a high man. Whether it be crack cocaine or M&Ms. Or just as simple as always going to gym you know? Look, we all get high. Some of us get high off life. What did Jamie Foxx say? You better blow that shit out! Haha. Real talk

[Verse One]:
Ain't nothing worse than a high you probably don't recognize
Til you see through your eyes that it fix ya
So the ambitions of a rider and pressure of your peers
Mixed with irrational fear makes elixirs
For the Boyz N The Hood that want to get the doe boy
Don't follow Trey, they wanna play, Ricky & Doughboy
No choice but to play in the game
Wheel Of Fortune and fame when Charlie O'Donnell calls your name
Aim
And then shoot
No questions asked, a dead man learns a lesson fast
When you looking for a light and he finds his blessing passed
Went from 17 to age 29 fast
The need to succeed in the lead is my gas
Pedal to the medal with the treble on blast
As
I take a puff of success
And blow out stress tapping haters in a tray of ash

[Hook]:
So sell your blow
Smoke your 'dro
Carry a fo' fo', if it gets you by
Cause whether it's crack
Or whether it's rap
Or just making stacks, we all get high
So sleep with her, or sleep with him
Or sleep with them, if it gets you by
Cause whether it's pleasure or whether it's pain
It all feels the same when you get high

[Verse Two]:
Now needing that she don't need him
But she thinking that he treat her right
Her addiction big, you would swear that she need a pipe
She know that he gon' get at every female in sight
And if she confront him he coming across her windpipe
But that's a high
That pass her by
And like all drugs, the toke come in the long run
So until she kick the habit or wait until the call come
She feed her high off the players and ballers
On the other screen, things ain't what they seem
The drug dealer on the block is really the fiend
While fiends be fixing they need
The pusher man on the street is steady mixing greed
With the passion of cash and
Pistol whip mashing, ho's eye lashing
High profile, mall fashion
Constant action, gun clapping
So stay on your toes like Michael Jackson

[Hook]:
So cop that Benzo
Or get that enzo
Or buy them rims though, if it gets you by
Cause whether it pain, or just knowing names
It's part of the game, we all get high
So make yo' rhymes, don't waste no time
Brag all 'bout crime, if it gets you by
Cause whether it's me or whether it's you
The same is true we all get high
Sell your blow
Smoke your 'dro
Carry a fo' fo', if it gets you by
Cause whether it's crack
Or whether it's rap
Or just making stacks, we all get high
So sleep with her, or sleep with him
Or sleep with them, if it gets you by
Cause whether it's pleasure or whether it's pain
It all feels the same when you get high
So cop that Benzo
Or get that enzo
Buy them rims though, if it gets you by
Cause whether it pain, or just knowing names
It's part of the game, we all get high
So make yo' rhymes, don't waste no time
Brag all 'bout crime, if it gets you by
Cause whether it's me or whether it's you
The same is true we all get high
