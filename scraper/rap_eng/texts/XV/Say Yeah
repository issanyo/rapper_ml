And my grind don't stop
Fighting on my way to the top
Let me hear you say yeah [2x]
I prove'em wrong when they doubt me
Let me hear you say yeah [2x]

[XV]
Wowzers Penny! now he is Vizzy
The sandlot kid went from Smalls to Benny
They was on the fence about me from the beginning
Good, cause that's where I'm aiming every inning
Nigga, I am a winner and I don't mean the season
It could be too mean it's cause my flow so freezing
Heavyweight when I weigh in like Kennan
Yeah, the square gets cheddar like cheeses
Tell J I got'em fam, XV's the monogram
And they know that I'm the man
Like they saw the sonogram, Damn
These niggas ain't seeing me, Hollow Man
Thumbs up, green light, 10-4 roger man
How dare I stunt, buying what I want
Know you lace your Ipod with with everything that I touch
Uhn, so go ahead and play dumb cause they gon' say yeah
But I'm a say duh, because...

The yellow nigga from the background
Bout to show face
Def Jam in the 90's, bout to showcase
A little what I do
I'm with a lot I'm through
Haters eveywhere
Yeah they try to belittle what I do
It's no time for them pastry ass niggas
I brought Head & Shoulders for them flaky ass niggas
Michael J. Fox for them shaky ass niggas
Lie Obie, I gotta leave them shady ass niggas
But I stood alone, I got leave the hood alone
Flashbacks thinking of bitches I could've boned
Diss tracks all of them shots I could've thrown
And like Joe I'm mad about the growth I could've shown
But the foot has shown and my buzz looking strong
All cause a nigga rep Jersey to the bone
Chillin' now I'm with the realtor, tryna look for homes
It happen so fast and God, couldn't of known
