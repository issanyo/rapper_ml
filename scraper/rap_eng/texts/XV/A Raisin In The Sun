[Verse One]:
Look
What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up and go away like leaves and herbs?
His mother says the meanest words
"Why you trying to write a script nigga?
You know you'll never leave this curb."
When your own mother's nothing to you
You got nothing to lose
And it's sad that she's a customer too
Why you dealing what you dealing with is something to prove
To a lot cause this block ain't a comfortable view
But he sits there in his chair with nothing to do
With an idle mind going idol wild out in his room
He had a pretty good plan he was trying to pursue
Save the dough for a camera in a box with his shoes
His mom came in his room for his stash found the dough
Took it took the corner make her ass overdose
Now where should he go?
The ending always feels like the beginning of the road
But I know

[Hook]
I'mma keep going cause I think that I'm the one
And I'mma be more than just a raisin in the sun
I know, I know, I know, I know
Yeah I know, I know, I know, I know

[Verse Two]:
On an uncomfortable couch in a meeting room
Waiting for an A&R that I should be seeing soon
The assistant starts to lead me to him
I swear dude was who storm? I was already seeing through him
I won't say the exact label that I was up in
I'll just say that they are no longer running
Bumping, Complex, Boy From Kansas thumping
He ain't paying attention, adrenaline is jumping
Bringing up artists to me that I think are nothing
Nodding his head, eyes red, I think this nigga's fronting
All of my pride is sunken all of my swag is gone
He acting like I'm nothing, he ain't feeling the songs
At that point I could leave it alone
I should be packing my bags, I should be headed back home
That's when you think about the choice that you making
And I said, "This is one voice you ain't taking."
The raisin

[Hook](x2)
