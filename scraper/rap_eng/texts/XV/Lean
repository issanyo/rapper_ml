[Verse One]:
Check my axles and my wheels
Know my challenges and ills, like a battle up a hill
Young
Hoffa is the real deal, rapping Holyfield cause they biting me for real
Some
Of y'all really need to chill on the rhyming
You kneel before me like Diamond
And just do as I say like Simon
Chill
Now everybody is riding
Yeah, and don't park it right
While I blow smoke out of my exhausted pipes
Power window lowered on the butterfly doors
Driving by, drive-bys in a drive by car
Floored
Cause I stay grounded even more than a kid caught with porn
Come along for the ride
Or
I'm on a Gulfstream 4 with gold winged doors
Watch a nigga get fly and

[Hook]:
Lean!
Back in your ride with your gat on your side, turn the track really high and
Lean!
Back in the cut, what's that in your cup? You ain't even gotta ask that
Lean!
Change the cut like you should be in the club with your hoodie and your team on the wall just
Lean!
Like you know you all that, just tell all them haters that they can fall back or make 'em
Lean!

[Verse Two]:
You'll never see the day that I decide to fail
Nigga, I make it all move like timing belts
Even though I like to roll by myself
I got a chick that'll ride like Wild Bill
Yeah
That's my Texas B
And she Screw like Texas Tea, but she move
To Tennessee
Like the Oilers and since I don't want ma to tell, I don't toy with her
Hopped in my Hot Wheel and just sped off
She in the back of my car, telling me to spoil her/spoiler
Please
I don't hand these Gs
I'm cool, no antifreeze
Yerdigg?
Yeah
Against all odds
I never ever thought that I'd get so far
So even when the wheels fall off
We gonna turn this motherfucker into a Flintstones car and

[Hook]:
Lean!
Back in your ride with your gat on your side, turn the track really high and
Lean!
Back in the cut, what's that in your cup? You ain't even gotta ask that
Lean!
Change the cut like you should be in the club with your hoodie and your team on the wall just
Lean!
Like you know you all that, just tell all them haters that they can fall back or make 'em
Lean!
