[Verse One: Sez Batters]
Bald nigga, raw nigga, black version of Walt White
Two words, one name, my chain Bruce Wayne, that dark knight
Bad chicks I roll with, whack shit, I don’t spit
She do the same while giving brains, I bag her up like Saks Fifth
Bird talk, swallow theses, you mad at her ‘cause she follow me
Your bars hard, ain’t hard to read, I said mad at her ‘cause she follow me
New windows, she macked up, you number two like back up
He handcuff, Roseanne tough, when you stand up, we crack up, haha

[Hook]
A fuck nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like
A snitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like
A bitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like
Sneak disser, that’s that shit I don’t like

[Verse Two: XV]
Love, life, loyalty is what I said, right?
And living like legends until we dead, right?
Bitches hoping they can catch me at a red light
Hopping out of something you ain’t see before like dead might
But this game makes niggas with dreams end they life
I thought about it once, I thought about it twice
But I found passion in that pit rise in the darkest night
Shout out to Angelakos, that’s my nigga Mike
I hate hearing these new nobodies who just knew somebody
I hate what these new broads be doing to they bodies
Vegas hotel lobby, her titties hard as rock
Her ass already drunk, it’s had too many shots
I hate when niggas hype shit up just to see it flop
I hate that black pornstars don’t get any props
Shout out Nyomi Banxxx, shout out Mone Divine
Shout out to Roxy Reynolds, I hope Skin Diamond shine
Shout out Kristina Rose, she said I’m out my mind
Won’t see me on no set but it’s my fucking time, fine

[Hook 2]
A fuck nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like
A snitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like
A bitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like
Sneak disser, that’s that shit I don’t like
Don’t like, like, don’t like, like
A snitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like

[Verse Three: Freddy High]
Fuck niggas, Square Gang, light one, let’s airplane
We kill shit that’s fair game, address niggas, Vera Wang
Change lanes with a red dame, ass shots like Sara Jay
She suck trey the long way and her tits look just like Tory Lane’s
I’m turnt up, yeah, we repping squares and that’s for life
We don’t give a fuck if you don’t like, long nights, pop bottles
We live life, that’s our motto, this rap shit don’t work out for me
I could still go back to my old life

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bruce Meanz]
We’re watching TV, yea my thrones, right? (right)
And blazing up big fat sacks of that northern lights
Amped up in these A&R’s I don’t like
Fake gossipin, twat snitchin
That bullshit – that’s your life
Fresh grooves and break trance
Hate those who hate Asians
My favorite fighter’s not Asian
Hard work, dedication
Who the bloody team? We run the scene
I’m Hale Branson, don’t fuck with me
Your wife’s here to get drunk with
She brought friends, we accompany
This means I’m the ghost 1
Who’da thought when I grow up
These OG’s woulda cosign
I’m stuck now and that’s toaster
That all night, on sight
You’re still talkin that trap trap
Bad news on my snap back
Watch out when you flash that
It’s cheap cheap that we bumpin
These trunks rattle all night
Hard hitters, crank that shit we all like

[Hook]
