I'm the O-10 ambassador, bad bitch capturer
Hand cuffs trapping her, I come in unfasten her
Fly Boys Airlines, 1500 passengers
Haters stay pissed then, I'mma bring the catheters
They same girls that want me now, I was up in class with her
Back then they Punk'd me
I came back and Ashtoned her
I'mma hit the lot and drop everything I got
And the headline will read, The Aston Martin Massacre
I stay away from just buying expensive things
Cause I would rather get no looks if that meant you were listening
I would rather set sail with you therefore the christening
That boy nice
Cold as the ice in my Lipton Tea
I put my heart into this shit and you get it free like donors
I'm 'bout my team like owners
I plant the seed like stoners
So for those of us that stood out like sweatpants and boners
I like to present you with the Fly Boy diploma
Came to Vizzy Zone after a 30 Minute Layover
Celebration time, two day hangover
That's the life when your night take your days over
Then wack niggas took the game over
I'mma break the chain like Red Rover
Until them lames curl up like hair rollers
And lay my name down like headstoners
We never been hand holders
My city rests on my damn shoulders
They wait for me to start up the jet motor
Vizzy, Vizzy, Vizzy, Fly Boy of the city
Ask the lady that raised me she'll say "My baby get busy"
Out the park like McGuire, but animated as Lizzy
These niggas is Quagmire acting g-g-g-g-giddy
You bout your dead presidents, you must be talking 50s
I'm about the founding fathers like Diddy about my Benjis
Until the tank is empty and I come up out my shell and meet Mindy
I'm doing pretty well at where they sent me like...

[Hook]:
Now tell me how you love it
Y'all can have your spot as long as my name is right above it
We on
Cause they know it's the obese
Now I'm gonna make that middle west blow up like the middle east
Alright
Will some bitties show some titties in this B.I.?
Kansas in the building, got my city on my Levis
And my jacket is Obey
Will I stop soon?
I say no way
