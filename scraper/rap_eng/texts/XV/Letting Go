[Verse 1: Bing Cypher]
This is my own battle
U heard (herd) it just like cattle
So lemme just dive deeper
Explain what it all amounts to
They told me Im no good I'd never see any wealth
Even my friends said go and find something else
But instead of just giving up I decided to go harder
Said I'm a go farther
Told my mother and my father
Said that I'm gonna make it knowin they gonna thank me
I know it's a cold world; glad that I brought my blanket
Bout to shake the earth Like a quake no Haiti
Bout to show the world why radios don't play me
The kids spitting loud tearin holes in the universe
We too fly (tufli) here Im just sitting on a cumulus
My names in the sky
Right across the clouds
Maybe you could see it but your heads in the ground
Go pound sand if you can't understand
I'm not the type of cat that'll compromise my plans
So as the road get Longer
And the difficulty rises
My eye is on the prize you can see it through my iris
Each level to the castle 16 bit scenario
Old school Getting stronger spitting fire like Mario
Just throw me a star I'm invincible to losers
Runnin through my comptetion koopas and the goombas
Call me super bing Aka the Cypher
My flow would make u think that I was rappin back in diapers
Renaissance movement call me Donatello
My whole team consisting of the davinci type fellows
Reshaping what you hearing ignorance has had enough
Don't you dare take my mic it's like takin Picasso brush
I'm tryna paint a picture and make the world see
What happens when a lyricist finally breaks free
Infecting all the masses with force so call me Anakin
Cypher sky walking on the beat you can't handle him

[Verse 2: XV]
They tag me on they Facebook, I guess I wanna be it
The minute that you ain’t shook, you’ll achieve it
I got a problem sometimes I just over think it
If I’m eight foot I still stand up on my tippy toes to see it
It must be a mountain I’m trying to reach it
And all the niggas that keep on doubting can eat shit
Pray, love they try not to hate us
Cause that just revolves like a nickle plate snubs
So ah
You can’t deal with it, put it to the head nigga
After the Juice don’t you end up on the ledge nigga
I stand by every rhyme I’ve ever said nigga
They spit that “nah dawg” I spit that “yeah nigga"
So excuse me if I act like a dick
But I promise I will fuck this game up quick if I got bigger
I kick that shit like Fila, and spit that shit, no filler
I’ll borrow all the hands in the air and still won’t feel ya
