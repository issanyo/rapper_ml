[Hook: XV & Bruce Meanz]
When they think you in the cut
Just get your paper up cause it's
Mo money, mo options
Mo money, mo options
I know they trying to plot
But how they gonna stop when it's
Mo money, mo options
Mo money, mo options
They scheming on the low
But little to they knows
And if you got a problem
I got a way to solve'em
Mo money, mo options
Mo money, mo options

[Verse 1: XV]
Unh
XV, AKA Hoffa Sandiego (right)
I've been on the low, conserving energy like mako (right)
Look at my reflection, at the beast, it's game, maybe
It's like I see a mirror as my city plays angry
[?] temper, cold as temperatures in the winter
If you venture through my center have a pass to enter
But there is no, place like where I live though
The states and capitols, so I fly accidental
And I told'em I would do this time to prove it to them man
I'm doing what I can with what I have and where I am
It's moving hella fast, I can not tell you where I'll land
And I can't say where I'm going but I'll tell you where I am
I'm on my shit, I'm on my grind
I'm on your bitch, I'm on her mind
She's on my dick, you on your ass
You on your last, I'm in my prime
I'm in the streets, I'm in the jungle
You on the tweets, you on the Vines
And if I see a couple problems rise
No worries, we'll be fine

[Hook: XV & Bruce Meanz]

[Verse 2: Bruce Meanz]
Yeah
My income is incoming, I been hustling
Been there, ladies I'm here, my aim is sincere
Think clear and I think cloudy, this shit 'round me
Big Cali, the kush, the hash is from Maui
Take challenge and risks, came out of slick alleys
Watch movies but in my life is where the big finale
Race like rallies, my heart to get dollars
I grab the pen, they thought I went to college
Make this out to be another one
Bruce Meanz and XV on, doing what other's want
They fucked up when they gave space to tape
'Bout to flood y'all with game in an amazing way
Yes yes's, it's more yes's, more options
More product for more fans, more profit
Pulp popular culture they trying to vulture
Sez is Samuel L. Jackson, I'm John Travolta
