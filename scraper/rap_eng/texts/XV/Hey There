[Verse One]:
This one right here is dedicated to the dedicated
The ones who thought they'd never make it, never made it
Homie, I sat and waited for my chance
I'd be damned if my number don't come up
The game needs a make over, I'mma get it done up
The days far from over nigga, I'mma bring the sun up
That would be the heaters
For the niggas that don't understand the metaphor through speakers
I can squeeze space through the tweeters
Either
The microphone controller, hip hop healer
Bentley wheel peeler, till the day they don't feel ya
The Daywalker out killing all the dream killers
You the liner filler nigga? I'm a scene stealer
I got a mean build up, but my fan base been sealed up
Don't touch that man's plate, he'll kill ya
I've worked hard for it all, waiting for my pay off
So now I'm saying "Hey y'all
I'm here."

[Hook]:
Hey there
Could you help me please?
Could you spare some change for the world
For the world to see?
Hey there
Could you help me please?
Could you spare some change for the world
For the world to see?

[Verse Two]:
I'm feeling like
Record labels don't get the picture
They ain't scared to experiment, cause they cloning niggas
I did it all from club songs to snapping fingers
To backpack rapping to clapping niggas
What the world wanted to see was the real XV
Put on my white boy tee and gave them the real me
The person I only let my girlfriend see
It took her ass a couple years, the world get it for free
Hip hop elevates not staying in one place
So tell me what's the case with this beef with the south
Everybody's overrated and few artists are hungry
And that's why I think this whole shit's in a drought
Though I hate to get on songs and just boast and brag
But in the past the most I had was my mouth
So I used that to lie about things I had
Until my friends came over and saw my house
True story

[Hook]:

[Verse Three]:
Tell me what Dre needs to see
Or L.A. Reid and Jay-Z
To give a chance to little ole' me
The boy from Kansas on 21st Street
Hop get Mike Caren to holler at me
Hoff holler at Diddy
But I'mma look that contract over a few times cause that nigga is shifty
Darius Jones come holler where I stay
You gave Chingy a chance, I'm one state away
They say
I'd be dope on G.O.O.D. Music
Probably cause the way I make such good music
I could probably bring another Grammy to the Family
Plus I make my own videos, that's upping up the ante
Signed or unsigned, every time I'mma spit it
I ain't asking for a handout, I'm asking for a visit
Complex is a classic, don't believe it till you hear it
And if you think not, you a critic

[Hook]:

[Pharrell]:
Hey there mister, give me some cash
I'm high as hell and I'm ready to blast
I'm just one hit away from being passed out
You don't even ask out
Hey there mister, give me some cash
I'm high as hell and I'm ready to blast
I'm just one hit away from being passed out
You don't even ask out
