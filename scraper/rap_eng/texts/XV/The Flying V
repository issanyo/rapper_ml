[Verse 1: XV]
Welcome to the Vizzy Zone, glad you came across ‘em
Out to get them plaques so I’m never ever flossing
What’s your girl’s name? I just pray you say it’s awesome
‘Cause ‘fore the night is over, you’ll say that I’m fucking awesome
I am not one of Martin’s friends, but that boy cold
Ball like Tommy when I walk into a sto'
Ball like Sonic when that hedgehog tuck and roll
And all I wanted was what I was fucking owed
I don’t need no damn chorus, just bring your camcorders
The flow is unobtainium and Vizzy’s Pandora
Uh, I don’t trap but I am Venus Fly
And I be eating raps alive in my little shop of horrors
In my prime, I’m Optimus, I’m a Transformer
Stepped up in the game to hang my green Jansport up
Everybody searching with the hopes of finding me
‘Cause I am in my zone, I call this one the Flying V and I am back
Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone going gone

[Verse 2: XV]
Vacate the zone as the game makes it known
You won’t stay here for long, I stand behind my bars like Mayday Malone
So you can bank on me like savings and loans when I’m making my songs
King of the city, yeah they made me a throne
So everybody hating, better save up they stones
I try to show my life in every rhyme I lay on
Dying to my shine like Sierra Leone
Cool it down, I’m burning up, in the lab like Sherman Klump
Now I get that buddy love, boy you never heard of such?
Come through with some dutches, I ain’t talking ‘bout that Fergie stuff
And burn it up, baby, we can kick it like the Derby Cup
I’m playing Hide-And-Seek on the mountain’s highest peak
Even making noises in the places that the lions sleep
Everybody searching with the hopes of finding me
But I am in my zone, I call this one the Flying V and I am back
Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone going gone

[Verse 3: XV]
My name is Vizzy, I’m the answer, open up the lanterns
Now they see I got the game closed like hampers
I never S.A.T, if you test me, I will stand up
Man, I been this way since I was walking in a pamper
Catch me in Atlanta, talking to a dancer
But I don’t make it rain dear, you can talk to Prancer
Now she wanna go to the back, I’m like why not?
As long as I put a hat on my nuts like Planters
Ha, and all the suddenly, they up on me
‘Cause I be eating beats like Doug Funny be
Money be hanging out my LRG dungarees
You wondering how I got my buzz, well you know how them honeys be
Freshmen, I ain’t one of them, ten of them make one of me
Going from point A to B, I just hope y’all come to see
Everybody searching with the hopes of finding me
But I am in my zone, I call this one the Flying V and I am back
Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone going gone
