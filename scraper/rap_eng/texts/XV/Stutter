(talking)
Haha, yeah, uhuh
You know sometimes when I'm talking to you I wanna tell you all the things I wanna do
And I just s-start st-stuttering
And I don't know what to say
But come here
L-lemme talk to you

[Hook]
Tell me t-tell me w-what you wanna hear
C-cause I c-cause I c-cause I c-cause I am right here
I ? cause I'm never scared
Tell me t-tell me just what you wanna hear

I love the way your body look hen you just siting in place
Like you just can't wait until I put my dick in your waist
Your ravishing body got me just s-sitting amazed
Lift up your legs, you dick pleasing while you sit on my face
Take the initiative to do things you can never just say
You get up and run away, but boo I'm don for the chase
Don't be afraid, baby girl, because we are how we're made
I can tell you wanna experiment, girl I'm your aid
I tasted you ?, so girly it's time for the trade
I got you all the way on it while I'm tugging your braids
You find a chair hat can rock and I'll take you away
Fit so much dick inside you it'll take you a day
To get it out you
Baby girl, the night is all about you
You can even bring that friend that be around you
Cause it ain't nothing to feel like stuffing when I'm working around you
You making sounds and doing things that turn me on and arousing
While I'm spanking your ass, you demand me to ?
Standing arousal, biting your lip like you just bout to tattle
Now let me crown you
Eyes closed while I'm ? you
Joy like a lost child and I just came and found you
Now come here
