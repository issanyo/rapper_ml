[XV talking]:
Ayo Esso! We got next!

[Verse One] [XV]:
Don't you agree?
That's it's pretty effin' cool to even know about me
I thought that it was cool to say "pretty effin' cool"
What about you?
Don't you agree?
Hahaha
Nah, don't you agree?
Hip hop ain't dead unfortunately
I respect Kanye West and Souljahboy get's props
But even if it's hip hop some shit's not hot
Haha
Don't you agree?
Obama winning an election is a sight to be seen
But I just think that day is really far
And America is gonna see how racist they are
Nah, don't you agree?
Maybe not but it's cool your ears is open to me
Cause I'mma speak for as long as y'all is scoping for me
And I think that's awhile
Now

[Hook]
Don't you agree?
There's a new day coming
Better get up, get out and get something
Vizzy in the house
Esso in the house
Boy what you talking 'bout?
The dopest niggas out
Homie, don't you agree?

[Verse Two] [XV]:
Man, you gotta agree
Aye, I knew who I would be now you gotta just see
Most of the time, I try to stay modest but geesh
I kinda got swag, don't you agree?
Ha
I'm playing but you probably agree
Cause I came into the game like a stain on a tee
Standing out, mixtapes handing out
Got the blogs buzzing cousin, this was all planning out
It's panning out, don't you agree?
And I'm from a city they don't even know about G
Esso's flow is more than Super Soda to me
So they don't know what to expect when they heard about me
They boy from KS, making hoes say, "Yes"
But only when I flow in a treat
The next kept secret, told the blogs, "Don't peep it
Leak it like a project ceiling, nigga."

[Hook]
Don't you agree?
There's a new day coming
Better get up, get out and get something
Vizzy in the house
Esso in the house
Boy what you talking 'bout?
The dopest niggas out
Homie, don't you agree?

[Verse Three] [Esso]:
Aye, what it do XV
Mr. Bourgeois Z
Money back guarantee so bet the house on me
Name on the marque so let me brush the debris
Over the shoulders of the tee custom cut for me
Aye man these niggas can't touch me, call 'em amputees
Got this shit on super lock like a skeleton key
Flow's so control B niggas control C
It's all good, hope they stack up for lawyer's fees
Copywrite infringers, better yet pretenders
They all posers, sheeps in wolf's clothing
See, I do what I do cause that's me
They syndicate that like O.T.B
I guess that would make me Will the Fresh Prince
Just four letters difference, you catch drift?
I'm way past where you hope you agree
Cause I'm pretty unique vocally and focused indeed

[Hook]
Don't you agree?
There's a new day coming
Better get up, get out and get something
Vizzy in the house
Esso in the house
Boy what you talking 'bout?
The dopest niggas out
Homie, don't you agree?
