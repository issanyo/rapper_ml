[Verse 1]
I swore that I'd stop
Trying to figure out what's wrong with Hip-Hop
After Soulja Boy dropped
And everybody thought there was a diss to Mims
Hell oh well, cause what the hell happened to him
I worked years on a record
And rappers all of a sudden started comin' droppin' songs they come up with in a second
The radio plays it till' the public done had enough of it and needs somethin even dumber to replace it
The quota hip-hop emcees are just as sad
Metros' dressin' retro its just a fad
Kanye might not be gay but y'all dressed like fags
Tryin to be him and express, but man poppin' some tags
I hate the fact that I sound just as mad
As an abusive dad who's kids bedroom is trashed
And I admit for a sec I was on the fence
Cause that padded room got hot so I had to vent
I miss the days where a rapper had to have some cents
Before they even saw a dolla', imagine it
I don't mean rappers that rap about laba-rynths
And apartheid, and all kinds of bad-ass shit
What happened to freestylin' in the park till' it's dark
Painting pictures from finish to start,like its an art
Now all I see on 106th and park is dumb dances and rappers that'd I'd rather hear bark
"Ya bitch ya!Publablalalapla ya bitch ya I'm paylalala"
That's all I hear when these mo'fuckas' rhyme and can't believe y'all got this mo'fucka' signed

[Verse 2]
Here we go everyone's a rapper like hand me flows
When you know you wanna get a spin on the merry-go
I don't care if you were 12 years old and priest saw your rear-view
Even he wouldn't feel you
People tell me fuck it X, you can get a deal too
Just make one of them songs to make em all hear you
Then drop an album showcasing the real you
And thats what all these new young rappers that get deals do
Niggas don't even spit that raw anymore
They don't know a break from a Kit Kat bar
They don't know the difference between a classic and a hoopty
And half they lives is out of a Martin Scorsese movie
And fans shake they head in agreement with what I said
When they ringtone is probably snap ya' finga', shake ya' leg
We got to put an end to the bullshit, indebted
I said it
And every single word, yep', I meant it
Does it take a T-Pain feature for y'all to get it?
Download my mp3 and not a snippet
Make all my concerts free to get a ticket
And you can quote me on all of these lyrics...
And now you hear it

[Verse 3]
So what's eating Gilbert Grape?
The fact that I'm filled with hate
That makes a nigga feel this way
Or maybe cause I gotta deal with hate,from niggas I don't know
I could get killed today
See I went against the wind and I'm into Tornado Alley
So that's kinda tough when you in this state
So while everybody was trappin' and bustin they macs
I was opening the window, like William Gates
My album Complex did amazing things for my city
Alienated me from all the cats that ain't worked with me
I charge four-sixteen and niggas like who is he
But hustlers know time is money, and I gets busy
So when niggas try to diss me I just laugh it out
Cause I don't think they even know what they mad about
Like local cats become rappers and of course they wanna' battle
So I'm the default nigga they rap about
Oh my, I got bigger things to do
So I don't got time to sit and hate on yo mans
No lie, my money tight like a Jew
So why would I concentrate on yo' camp
I came from the bottom to the top without a hand
Without Craig and the Power 93 band
Told em' mamma's gone and they said I'd never be one
Payback's a bitch so I just want a refund
Shooting for the stars while bars just wanna see one, and need one
And have a baby bob on the cute one
Sometimes I ask myself, what's the reasons?
That I wanna be part of this game with what its become
Thats the question that I dance around to
And maybe on my album I'll have an answer for you
But till' then I'll just keep dancing and snappin', smilin' and rappin'
And just wait and see what happens
