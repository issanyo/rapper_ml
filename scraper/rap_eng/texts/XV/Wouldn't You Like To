Hate it or love it, I'm the definition of it, nigga

Wouldn't you like to ride
? on your side
People down to ride
No matter what, we live
Keep it real
You ain't doing that shit you talk
The Sopranos is ass
You ain't caught no charge
You confuse yourself when you rap like you truth
You's a dyke
A bitch trying to act like a dude
I ain't never took a snap from a dude without sending one back
Half of my haters used to send me tracks
Like "will you do a verse on my shitty ass song"
Then a couple months later "I don't like him at all"
Y'all make no sense
No case, no prints
Niggas get they face in my car, I'll raise up the tints
Cops say I can't drive four 90 percents
Fuck 'em, threw 'em my demo
Got ? singing ?
It don't take rocket scientists to smell that I'm the shit
Sniff for the aroma if you ain't convinced
Pure crack, nigga
