I know you gon' love me
Cause my joints bang all throughout the town
I know you gon' love me
Cause I'mma prove to y'all how I got my crown
I know you gon' love me
I'm dropping classic albums every year from now
I know you gon' love me
I know you liked ? and my Overture shit
But Complex coming, 'bout to make the world sick
I know you 'gon love me

[Verse]
Young nigga every rapper want trouble with
I'm bigger than my city, but I really try to humble it
I got hands, I ain't the man you wanna rumble with
The ball was in your court, but you bullshitters fumbled it
Say my name, it don't matter if you mumble it
I'll have niggas at your door on the double, kick!
Crack sales, yeah homie, I used to fuck with it
Weed, X, coke, yeah I used to hustle it
That's why my stash box looks so lovely, shit
I took them dollars, invested it, and doubled it
That's that hustle shit, niggas get they dough and ride
Cause hood dreams rarely involve a 9 to 5
Everybody a gangster, wanna die with pride
I'd rather live and get this money, man, fuck 'em, right?
Right
But let's get this money, right
Pour it on the table, chop it up, homie, I love them like
