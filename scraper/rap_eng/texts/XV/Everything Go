[Intro]
Yeah, everything go
Ya know, everything go
Bring lights, bring backpacks
Bring bills, bring blunts
Garcia Y Vegas only

[Verse 1]
Welcome to generation X in the middle of the west
Have your death orchestrated when you fiddle with the best
Came to give you more, won't give you any less
Make'em wrong when I write, then I hit them with the left
Bars! Lyrics in the pen
Dumb niggas gotta hear that shit again
Y'all is pions and I'm the king pissin' in the wind
Keep your face up in the books and make sure your bitch ain't my friend (unh)
Square niggas can't let your circle fit in (unh)
Sittin' on Twitter, getting on every trend, huh?
Tell you what's hot and you retweet to all your friends
Nigga stop, you robots probably got metal for limbs
I puff the herb and fuck with nerds but keep it fuckin' G though
Then bust a swerve and fuck with herb at Roscoe's up on Pico
The other half of Neo, that means I'm fucking G yo
Green lights and green backpacks, everything go

[Outro]
Yeah, everything go
All go everything
Green lights, green backpacks, green bills
