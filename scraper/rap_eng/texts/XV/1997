[Verse One]:
The year was 1997 I was 12 or 11
Time is ticking, I feel different while I'm wishing I was 7
My first time I thought of death and
I know I'm only 12
But my home girl died of a tumor just a little sooner so you can never tell
I'm two years away from high school
And everyone still think I'm not cool
Twelve months away from my teen years
And I wanna run away and leave here
I still play Frogger and Tetris
Collect Batman toys and wrestlers
Play Final Fantasy with my best friend
I don't want '97 to end
But I

[Hook]:
And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

[Verse Two]:
The year was 1997 I was 12 or 11
Time is ticking, I feel different while I'm wishing I was 7
Back when only bullys had to act hard
And we played Mortal Kombat in my backyard
On the hill threw cherry bombs at cars
Jump over the fence and run from the attack dog
And we laughed hard
Didn't ask mom
Turn the 'Lac on
With the back gone
That was our sign
That our ride, was 'bout to take us all swimming at that park
But we all see the girl we in love with
And daydream the day we get one kiss
Hit the diving board and do one flip
This the time that I will never forget
And I

[Hook]:
And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

[Verse Three]:
The year was 1997 I was 12 or 11
Time is ticking, I feel different while I'm wishing I was 7
My life is steady wasting
All my friends already changing
While I wanna play my video games on my brand new PlayStation
On Saturday's I'm up at noon
Missed all my favorite cartoons
Your friends, no longer call you
And everything is harmful
So we, just made a dug out
Where all of us just hung out
It's called the Flyboy Club House
Where we chill and just go bug out
Cause we

[Hook]:
And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around
