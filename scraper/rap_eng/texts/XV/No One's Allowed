[Verse One] [QuESt]:
No doubt
Can I bond with a million and one things coming out of my mouth?
Seems like everything's going down south
Can I imagine things a little better?
6'2" nigga that's lacking in attitude
The full force is lining this latitude
He's really nice, he's all about what he's gonna do
Never be in groove what can I do
To pursue something they thought that I would never do?
John Travolta, guess just Be Cool
Cause any ignorant gesture will mess up
My career before it even much starts
Shall I depart from this sickening ? to advance causing broads and not live hard
Cause everybody on the television screen is living the dream and showing it off for the scene
Too crazy, nigga the game shady
4080, Q-Tip persuade me
Never be long but I stay strong like Akon in the ghetto with bundles of Napalm

[Verse Two] [XV]:
From a place that you never seen
Eyes wide but I lied if I said that I never dream
In a league of my own, ain't on any team
Kansas boy didn't fit in with the ? scene
But they knew I was coming like a senor beam
You got the ground, watch your head for the guillotine
Huh, and I'm me on everything
So I'm out front with my music like caroling
And I swear I will never leave
I'm about to make the rap game unawaring
Behind the scenes they trying to make me 2Pac
Change my voice and my clothes like a new job
We all wear masks like relationships
Phantom Of The Opera, I remove it and it made them sick
And bitches spread for the bread like Mayo Whip
And I persuade ? rappers just to make a hit
In a room full of 'dro I don't take a hit
Labels don't smell what I'm cooking, they don't make a cent/sent
And I mean what I say I meant
I deserve my spot like I paid the rent

[Verse Three] [QuESt]:
Light, camera, action on the set
I bet the beat dance is rented
Yet I still Google eye the prize
And recognize the ice and yearn for the security that it comes with
Confidence, prominence, adulation, it don't make sense
The sins of the human I'm an alien
Apparel narrows down the arrows pointing down

[XV]:
But I never wanna hit the ground
Had Cloverfield flow when I hit the town
In the sense of my senses were alienated
Let the XV be alienated
Stand strong, cause maybe I made it
Easy for people who believe me and waited
For a change like Obama campaigning
Popping video games in instead of champagne and
My right mind, I'm left field, Jason Bate
Tip the scales for the real, nigga wait/weight
Don't make a move in the game they play
Lose all your pieces and in the end they gonna say...
