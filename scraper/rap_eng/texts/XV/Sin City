[Intro: Freddy High]
Yea,uh!

[Verse 1: Freddy High]
That game plan, my plane land, I check in, my suitcase, I unzip
We back in Vegas, they gotta pay us, its a celebration in [?] the hoes hit
We hit the pool fo' we hit the strip
Rehab, we drink and sip
Bad girls who like bad girls, but I'm chillin' though when they touchin' shit
Hit the tables, I roll the dice
6 and 8's, hop it twice
L7, I'm livin' life
And not one of us is gonna sleep tonight
When that limo come
All black, we hella drunk
They smell the fun
Still pick us up
Our spot, pop a bottle
Waitress, a fine model
She pour us up
It's hella girls and they strippin'
That 'trone i'on know my limit
I swear we built it from the ground up
And she wanna know my business
See this is a lil vacation
For my niggas hardwork and dedication
Look at all these doors we makin
Plus I found this situation
Up in SIN CITY!

[Verse 2: XV]
Drinkin' and don't chase it
Hit the stages fo' yo wages
Close yo eyes and go to places
You just make it yo oasis
You put yo mmm in they faces
Take they bread, leave no traces
Run yo fingers through your lacewig
Look in yo eyes and they so fake it, ain't it(look)
You say this ain't you and I fuckin believe it
You gotta get through all the niggas who see it
As a piece of ass or some cash when they visa(visit)[?]
You need you a dude who don't drink and smoke reefa
Love to stay home and believin' in Jesus
Them be the ones on the low (cheetahs)[?]
Wish it was me but I can't be that eitha
And she wish I could
But since I can't just live in the moment
Come to the winer[?] and see you preformin'
Makin it rain see how crazy they goin
Go to the back and put on that Trojan
The DJ throw on Frank Ocean, she goin
You alone and she know that the owner don't [?]
These girls out here getting chosen
Hopin' they meet dudes
That'll sweep 'em of they feet
And use dollas as a broom
I assume
What I consumed
Got me floatin like a parade
Got me goin dora space
While she show me just what it takes
To make it in...

[Verse 3: XV]
Uh
Ain't it ironic I came up with Squares and then they try to mock it
They sayin the same punchline over and over why don't they just stop it
Them circles, them squares, those squares in yo circle, I got it, I got it!
But nobody told you a circle is the first thing that looks like a target, but me
We rock green like I play for the sonics
And seattle plays in some chronic
Makin a tonic
To mix wit an egg into omelets
To put this whole game in my pocket
After I cough I lift off like a rocket
Go to the stars and then play with a comet
Shorty say "Vizzy you changing the topic"
Oh I forgot it you makin a profit
What can I say I can't hate if I want it
This is yo way and I can't try to knock it
You out here makin connections
But I can't tell if she is the socket
Shorty you got it
Yes, Shorty you got it
These niggas ain't nothing but objects
They fill up they wallet with paper for hope
You come for a fix and walk out here broke
Sin City
