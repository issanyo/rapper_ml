[Chorus]
I’m walking out my room, my rocket pack is charged
I might be leaving soon, Destination Mars
I know you hate to see the fact that I’m so far
But you know where’ I’ll be, Destination Mars

[Verse 1]
The aftermath of when the levee break
When you got flow like you live on Erie Lake
Mind flooded with thoughts, make a nigga meditate
Better yet I’ll vacate like my name is Chevy Chase
Escape the dark side, find a rebel base
Got in a little trouble, turn up the heavy bass
After first place in this human race without losing place
Taking aim, killing the game, this my Coup de Grace
My destiny’s heavy, but I can’t make my future wait
The stars align and maybe in time we’ll conjugate
And I can go up outer space, soaring through the sky and fly without a cape
All I see are squares but can’t go backwards like a pawn
Tell my mom that I’m gone, I love her like no other
I’ll be somewhere in the stars above her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I woke up in the morning from a dream of success
Traded in my job later for some bling on my neck
Ask why we need chains cause ain’t nothing free
And my momma need change while she chase her degree
She finally caught it, yeah, but look what it cost her
Her son running the streets and some nasty divorces
Still I’m hella proud and you settled down
Momma had drive like you pushed the gas pedal down
It’s like a dream when you pack up all your things
And those bike pegs feel like a Pegasus with its wings
No attempts to try to flee the Northside
My vision is HD, wanna see the world wide
And once I saw that, I was off that
Looking at the stars and everything beyond that
So what you call that?
You wonder how far we’ll go
Winning though is all we know

[Chorus]
