[Intro]
Yeah, everything around me
Chicka, everything around me
Unh

[Verse 1]
I got out and feel like I'm not human
Rocking not human, Nas try to watch through him
All this confusion, I found no conclusion
How love make unions but paper can bring ruins
I feel more alive as a ghost (Unh)
I hear the lies as they toast (Unh)
Parasites as a host
Got a broad from the coast
Taking flights to my shows
Heel clicking, still stripping
I ain't slipping cause that ass I be still gripping
Small talk in the car, is this bitch tripping
This a rental, you a rental, what's the big difference?
A new set of illusions that can hide the real
Them pills make you delusional behind the wheel
Post some pictures that she try to reveal
Bet you more beautiful behind everything you try to conceal
The dolla bill

[Outro](2x)
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Backpacks scream back "all this green around me"
Bad bitches, good weed, full screens, surround me
All my team around me, dolla, dolla bill y'all
