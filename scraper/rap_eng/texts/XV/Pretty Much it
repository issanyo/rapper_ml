[Intro][XV talking]:
Yeah. Yeah, I don't think I'm going out tonight. No, I don't think I'm going out ever in 2008

[Verse One]
Jeah
Switch up, so I pick up the phone
Bling on the other end telling me to ease up
King of the city, I'll never leave the throne
Nigga, put it on my caesar, ya get it?
Even all over, tell 'em TJ did it
Fine chickick on my arm, they like, "He ain't hit it."
And I'mma be honest dawg, I probably didn't
But tell Bossip I did, and let him just print it
Video games and that's pretty much is it
Do a couple shows in a couple new cities
Get a couple numbers from a couple new pretties
Come home, no problem, that's how I do business
Fitted fitted tight like a gymnast
Seen 'round town about as much as the Olympics
XV or 15, tell me which is it
It's XV baby and that's pretty much is it!

[Hook]:
Play games and read comics and that's pretty much it
Watch porn, checks blogs and that's pretty much it
I'll record a few songs but that's pretty much it
(That's pretty much it?)
Yeah that's pretty much it
I mean I kill a few shows but that's pretty much it
Been all over the globe but that's pretty much it
I be at my place writing blogs on Myspace telling cats in outer space
But that's pretty much it

[Verse Two]:
Nah, that ain't it, I'mma still do my thang
Cause I'm about to pop like my ears on a plane
So hang on like you on a pier or a train
Thangs ain't the same, I got tears for the game
I guess it's a battlefield so I'mma get mine
The cast even wanna know when I'mma get signed
But till then I'mma drink my drink with a lime
Wink at a dime, that probably think that she fine
But that's it cause I don't speak to the haters
Real talk, I'm doing y'all peeps a favor
Cause if I come out I'mma leave with a caper
I want my cut, this is always week's paper
Make your bed, y'all slept on me
That's ahead, I'm set homie
Cause the new albums done and it's kinda the shit
So I'mma drop a tour and chill and that's pretty much it
