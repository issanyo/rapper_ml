Intro (JMIC) ::

Its been a mission just getting people to listen, but now when they see JMIC, no hesitation in clicking. I'm dedicated and drivin to making it in the business, you haters are gonna witness me get a million people to just "Let My Tape Rock"

First Verse (JMIC) ::

I remember when the blogs wouldn't post my song
Sat on my computer emailing all day long
And every once in a while I would get a response
Now they hollerin at me wanting to know whats going on, ya know!
Fuckin with Vizzy and Fresh
Shout out to Ben, I give you respect dog you did what you said
And to me thats the key
Whats up XV?
I be glad to work with you G
But enough about that shit
Lemmie get to the rappin
Director, action!
Turn the HD cameras on as well as all the microphones
Record and capture it all cause we gon put on quite a show
I'm feeling funny dazin in and out of my writing zone
You can call me crazy, but I feel like I'm alone
Reject looking for some respect
I been running tracks since class had recess
Let my tape rock dog dont hit eject you need to just
"Let My Tape Rock"

Second Verse (XV) ::

While lookin in the sky
I seen it with my eyes
I know my dreams will be the prize
If I can reach that shit in time
Wake up, and smell the roses
Haters pluggin they noses
Cause they want you to take your dosage, come down from where we going
We chosen for the moment
No leasin we is ownin
The reason I rock from my links down to my trojans
And the shoes I put my toes in
I walked them shits like moses
Part of the reason I parted ways with niggas I roll with
Offices that I sat in talkin to Vanessa Satten
Not understanding this rap shit is way more than just my passion
My grinds like cross colors, nigga. Old Fashion
So I rise from the bottom like a phoenix in the ashes
I show my heart in this like PDA
Trying to do first week numbers higher than my GPA
Talked about around my town more than BTK
The wonder win so count me in like a CPA, and let my tape rock

Third Verse (JMIC) ::

This feels so extraordinary
Wish I could describe it to you
Ima try to rhyme it to you
Get a little bit of that fire voodoo
Roll it up take a puff
And witness the magic
Take a fuckin zip and turn it into some ashes
Just like beats, take um, turn um into classics
My flow is so flipped around you hear it through your glasses
What the fuck?
What is up with this kid who spits this shit so different?
Than everybody else so everybody else is interested
100,000 listenin and counting y'all are witness
To JMIC predicting this climb to the top
Cl-climb to the top
And yep you can bet that my grind never stops
My grind never stops
Like the time on your watch
And time is valuable surrounded by some diamonds and rocks
That are shinin and blindin yours eyes from the clock
Which reminds the alive that they're dyin' like Pac, and Notorious!
