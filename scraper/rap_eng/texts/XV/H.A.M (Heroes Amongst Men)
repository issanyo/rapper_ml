[Verse 1: XV]
Well, here's ya favorite Martian
Bill Bixby, I'm lane switching and wheel twisting
Rubber burning, paper rolling, why y'all kill switching?
All about my capital, hold it down, shift keys
Miss me, let’s see, I'm Dr Evil, I'd done ball forever
Take it easy ‘cause these niggas will draw on whatever
And rest in Peace to Aaron Hobson and the nigga ain’t violent
But I carry options ‘cause these niggas be wilding
Believe me bro, cold ass flow is three below
And I got it made without a cleaning ho
No freestyle but this joint is a freebie yo
I dead mic's, no CB4, I'm dead nice
You meanies Joe, where do all the heroes go?
The g-est thing about you is your email bro
CC me with dough that you will forward and I reply with the details yo
But everything else is just considered spam
Throw it in the can when I land ‘cause a nigga going ham

[Hook]
Heroes amongst men, hand me any mic
But have your army manned ‘cause you know I go ham
Heroes amongst men, hand me any mic
But have your army manned ‘cause you know I go ham
Heroes amongst men, high as a mountain while I'm flying by the fans
Going ham, heroes amongst men, yeah, that’s what I am

[Verse 2: XV]
Skinny denim jeans and a fitted low, brim action
All white vans, you would think that I'm kidnapping
Lyrics cut deeper than my blades in my hands wrapping
Call that flow Hugh Jackman back when I was boom bapping
Shawty came to say is you moving ’cause you packing?
What we need to go ham? A handy cam, a few napkins
Don’t go slower than dancing to a ballad
Up in chains like Alice, getting dressed up by a stylist
And Mr. Chows giving my order, the whores who doubt it
Like I heard you blowing up, Vizzy tell me all about it
Well I got a Caesar, hit a thousand islands and blue cheese
Can you please at least put some dressing on my salad?
Confess and someone tell Clark Kent I'm ‘bout to steal his frames
Flash Gordon shoes and Professor X's plane
Dare Devil sunglasses, Spider-Man first week is what I'm trying to do
When I hit the streets ‘cause my album go ham

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
Yeah, Year of the Squarian, zeroes that's prepared to win
Heroes we keep burying, burn up the charts, this is Nero on the violin
Betting on X is like seeing the whole card deck before buying in
So get your money up, the new cat that be running rap was like a runner up
Guess directions fucked him up, I'm four words that make you
Bring the track backwards on my tape and repped him in
So heavy that no other sideways so 316′s up but I be 619′ing
Come off the top then grab the pen and the crowd is wilding
I make them stand from the floor to the stands
No matter where I am, I promise fam, I'mma go ham

[Hook]
