You play it, you say it, you know what you hearing, I'm hot
I ain't conceited I just look in the mirror a lot
You got a honey that you getting to pop
I can show you how to give her the cock
Follow me, man, the flow super ugly
I don't consider it cheating
I consider it your girl being lucky
Niggas shot shots so I walk with a limp
That lead me to pulling hoes so I talk like a pimp
Bathroom hoes wanna swirl a nigga down
Hoping that they catch me out when my girly ain't around
Bling tried to tll me "man, tone it a little down
Have respect for your lady"
But I'm running 'round town
Trying to find a lucky lady that'll hop in the car and
Say that she'll menage
Fiending for the penis, she screaming out for Hoffa
Said it make her feel good, we all had a monster ball
