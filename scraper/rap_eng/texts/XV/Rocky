[Intro]
Today we're here with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa. The reason we're standing in this refrigerated box is that Mr.Balboa has an unusual method of training. In a moment he's gonna demonstrate for the viewing audience at home

[Hook]
It's too late to turn back now, back now, back now
I put the whole city on my back now, back now, back now
Man, I feel like Rocky, my wrist all rocky
My chain all rocky cause I came up rocky
I feel like Rocky like who gon' stop me?
My wrist all rocky, my chain all rocky
Cause I came up rocky

[Verse 1]
Underground dig me, a minor in this rapping
Might've changed the majors, but I never changed my passion
Where's that backpacking is what everybody's asking
Heard some diss tracks in, but that's just a distraction
My trees hydroponic and my mails electronic
I'm in heaven in pussy, I'm inhaling some chronic
On the Dell playing Sonic, on the Mac writing raps
Out in LA in May with my back in the back
Fuck all these struggling cats that lack the nuts I pack
Magazines asking if I'm a nerd and I say something like that
I'm just a kid who ain't fit in with all these circular cats
But I be lying saying I ain't try turning it crap
Turned in my cap and gown, how'd I ever turn into that?
You never know, I never shown when I was hurting like that
So instead I laid in the bed and thoughts just turned into raps
Fiends turned in advance then I taught myself that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Vizzy, come with me, I can show you my city
Where success is a heel, but it's not my Achilles
Got people mouthing the words like I'm Milli Vanilli
Heard my life was kind of rocky like I came out of Philly
But they won't box me in
Looking for an exit when they try to lock me in
I broke the locks again, now my mind's got a freak, the blinds gotta see
The fights that I put up with was more than Apollo Creed
Damn, it did stick me, my corner had no Mickey
No Disney, just babies I push in knickers
It was rhymes over dimes, in my mind I was defying
And my grandma told me stories that helped me see I could triumph
Like Daniel with the lions or David and Goliath
Or cancer out of Kansas who made his way to Zion
And let these songs be the psalms of my background
[?] moving forward cause I told 'em

[Hook]
