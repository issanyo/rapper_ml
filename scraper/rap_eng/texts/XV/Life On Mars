[Hook]
I don't want to be with anybody at all
I don't want to be seen with anybody at all
The world is much too big for me to handle alone
But I don't want no friends, I want to stay on my own

[Verse One]:
Yeah
Please let me sleep
I don't want to go nowhere today
There ain't nobody out there I want to meet
Inside of my mind is where I want to stay
I'm no nomad, take pleasure travelling in my own path
When spaceships become available, I'm just saying that's something I won't have
The first one with it always knows it won't last
A girl told me, it was a job to date me
Due to the fact that it's hard to make me
Go out to all these peculiar places and see all these unfamiliar faces
Take me to places I purposely ain't been
Don't want to stay so I say I can't sit
My name's on the guest list but I ain't there
No one in my circle that's inside my square

[Hook] (XV):
The planet's turning but I can't stand still
The clock is ticking but I can't stop time
And all I want is to be by myself
Do you think that's a crime?
I don't want to be with anybody at all
(I don't ever want to leave at all, while I'm living my life on Mars)
I don't want to be seen with anybody at all
(In a room filled with plastic stars, I like living my life on Mars)
The world is much too big for me to handle alone
(I can't find the keys to my car, so I live my life on Mars)
But I don't want no friends, I want to stay on my own
(If I leave I don't ever go far, I like living my life on Mars)

[Verse Two]:
Open up the windows to a glove through a TV
Explore the windows of my soul through a CD
The remote control acts like a Genie
Controlling the scene that I feel like seeing
Fears of the universe and the world in it
Scared of the Earth and all the girls in it
All the pain that lives and all the hurt in it
All the languages and all the words in it
Don't pick up my phone and I won't call you
R.I.P. Shane that's why I'm Hoffa
Must have been here before cause I want out
If these walls could talk I'd tear them all out
My publicist says I gotta go on the scene
So the fans and magazines know who I be
But me I'm home like my jerseys all white
So you know that I'm home for the team

[Hook] (XV):
The planet's turning but I can't stand still
The clock is ticking but I can't stop time
And all I want is to be by myself
Do you think that's a crime?
I don't want to be with anybody at all
(I don't ever want to leave at all, while I'm living my life on Mars)
I don't want to be seen with anybody at all
(In a room filled with plastic stars, I like living my life on Mars)
The world is much too big for me to handle alone
(I can't find the keys to my car, so I live my life on Mars)
But I don't want no friends, I want to stay on my own
(If I leave I don't ever go far, I like living my life on Mars)

[Verse Three]:
My Nana said, "Y'all make a good couple."
Mama said, "Go get in some trouble."
Seven said, "Let's tour up through Europe
I know a few ladies out there that love you."
But I just stay in my place and play MySpace
And talk to all the people I want to
But in time you find that time is just flying and it's passing by right in front of you
And all those dreams you seen ain't coming true
The person you wanna be ain't become you
Winter starts to feel like spring and spring start to feel like fall and you lost in summer too
I wanna find a Real Girl like Lars
I'm still looking for the keys to my car
But I'm not sure if I'm that far
That I could leave behind life on Mars

[Hook] (XV):
The planet's turning but I can't stand still
The clock is ticking but I can't stop time
And all I want is to be by myself
Do you think that's a crime?
I don't want to be with anybody at all
(I don't ever want to leave at all, while I'm living my life on Mars)
I don't want to be seen with anybody at all
(In a room filled with plastic stars, I like living my life on Mars)
The world is much too big for me to handle alone
(I can't find the keys to my car, so I live my life on Mars)
But I don't want no friends, I want to stay on my own
(If I leave I don't ever go far, I like living my life on Mars)
