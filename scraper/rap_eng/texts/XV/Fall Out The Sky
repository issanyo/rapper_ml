[Verse 1: XV]
I know I’m the shit, tell ’em they gonna say it
I know I can spit, tell ‘em they gonna spray it
I be sitting, writing piff and the metaphor’s thick
I’m like that line is hella dope, ain't it?
And two minutes after that, I’m looking back at the rap
Telling Pat that I won’t play it even when I know I one-take it
I’m Neo trying to jump in the matrix, won’t make it
Wish you could see it through my eyelids
When I’m playing my shit, everybody silent
I don’t even wanna nod, the yes man’s love it but fuck it, that’s they job
And then I’m walking out the mall and I’m almost at the door
And that’s when I hear Hoff, I knew that was you, please sign my arm
Square in the Circle’s all I bump in my car, that’s when it gets hard
To not feel like a star when they know who you are, I stay modest
And honestly, I’m appalled that I’ve gotten this far on the shit that I’m on

[Hook]
I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky
And then I fall right out the sky, I know sometimes I feel so high
And then I fall right out the sky and then I fall right out the sky

[Verse 2: XV]
She say I’m cute, she say I’m cool
To all of her friends, I make my move
I’m feeling like I’m that dude, don’t gotta spit game
I’m already that smooth, I leave my pessimism in the stands
As soon as I shoot, my conscious yell boo
As soon as I walk up to talk all of my stuff, I honestly can’t move
That’s my insecurity like a mall cop
But I’m trying to leave with something like a car lot
Pick one, pick two but they all hot and I’m trying to get you up to my spot
She know my name, she trying to play it off
I seen that ring, she trying to take it off
And I wanna approach but my thoughts ain’t helping me flow

[Hook 2]
I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky
And then I fall right out the sky, I know sometimes I feel so high
And then I fall right out the sky and then I fall right out the sky
I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky
And then I fall right out the sky

[Verse 3: XV]
I know they telling me how I’m mad dope
Star Wars XV, I’m the last hope but I hear them keys
And I just say, "please don’t end on a bad note"
And that’s probably why I tip-toe, champagne, say toast
And then I sip slow, trying to get they attention and then I get no’s
And then I get known just to make them stop and go
This is all I got, no trust fund so don’t shoot me as I fly, duck hunt
Everything I expect, I accept and every dude that I pay, I collect
And everything that I say I'mma get, I'mma get
Take a twit pic and floss on my ex, yeah for a minute, I was high
Then I saw her new guy and I fell out my jet

[Hook 2]
