[Verse One] [XV]:
I tell 'em what it is and everything it won't be
Everything I did, motherfuckers just won't see
Cause what I don't write, I was 'round my whole life
Rolled with the snow white
Before I even had a beard like Dopey
Where the Crips? Where the Bloods, Where the Folks be?
Stayed in the crib but I never played potch
In my room mostly, I was rapping
And if this ain't poetry then why am I snapping?
Felt lost with the shit I've been on
Got a cough for that nigga syndrome
But I refuse to let the views people live on
Allow 'em to describe me by my skin tone
Never got picked for no team but got picked on
Ballers shooting bricks
Hustlers putting freaks on
And I'm just in a house full of dreams to depend on
But they can't blow it down when they found it's a brick home
Okay
