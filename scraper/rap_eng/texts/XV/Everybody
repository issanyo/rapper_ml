[Kanye West Intro]:
I just got off the plane Chicago. It's your boy Kanye West on the beat

[Chorus]:
Everybody said that I wouldn't blow
Everybody said that I couldn't flow
Everybody said that and then they said this and
Good thing I never ever listen
Everybody said that I wouldn't blow
Everybody said that I couldn't flow
Everybody said that and then they said this and
Good thing I never ever listen

[Verse One]:
On the school bus I used to write mad hooks
Walked around lunch carrying a rap book
Hoes ain't care
Niggas gave me mad looks
Cause they know that my flow had they ass shook
Graduated, broke up with my team
They was after a wish, I was after a dream
And I ain't even look back at the loss of friends
Cause I live by success is the best revenge
It's like, once you leave high school what can you do?
Get a job or just go to school
But this dude
I made a business and love it
So if you ask if I got a job, hell I'm the owner of it
Uh huh

[Chorus]:
Everybody said that I wouldn't blow
Everybody said that I couldn't flow
Everybody said that and then they said this and
Good thing I never ever listen
Everybody said that I wouldn't blow
Everybody said that I couldn't flow
Everybody said that and then they said this and
Good thing I never ever listen

[Verse Two]:
I went from acting like a pen was a mic
To making three thou in the morning spending it all in a night
Give your dog a light, he gotta see what I'm doing here
Taking cats out the game like music chairs
Back in the day chicks only used to stare
Cause I had something on me, or, I ain't do my hair
And now they stare like, "That there's X."
Make bets on who's gonna be my boo next
Yep
This is something in the making
Something that we taking, a new elevation
And if we with me then throw up your crown
But if you hated in the past, keep throwing it down

[Chorus]:
Everybody said that I wouldn't blow
Everybody said that I couldn't flow
Everybody said that and then they said this and
Good thing I never ever listen
Everybody said that I wouldn't blow
Everybody said that I couldn't flow
Everybody said that and then they said this and
Good thing I never ever listen

[Verse Three]:
You kill a dream we build a dream
They ain't wanna sign me so I built a team
Now every label wanna find me
I used to not have a video
Till me and Bling formed a team like Eddie and Arsenio
Oh Lord have mercy
If grandma could see me now, she'd would probably try to beat me down
Running round, picking girls out the crowd
Acting an ass, screaming curse words loud

To my teachers who laughed at my dream
Now look
To my principle who expelled me
Now look
To the system that said I be back
Locked up or on the streets selling crack
Now look
Throw your hands in the sky

[Chorus]:
Everybody said that I wouldn't blow
Everybody said that I couldn't flow
Everybody said that and then they said this and
Good thing I never ever listen
Everybody said that I wouldn't blow
Everybody said that I couldn't flow
Everybody said that and then they said this and
Good thing I never ever listen
