[Verse 1]
Spill out my guts and fill the stick with Indo
Vibin' over instrumentals as I find my mental
Minimizers like the windows to my eyelids
My pain sits on the seal to heal, chill, enjoy the tempo
Fans getting so annoyed the world doesn't know the boy
From the home of Superman not the Soulja Boy
The coldest boy with red in his eyes
And he's on top of the roof cause he said he could fly
I know it sounds like the highest, how met his demise
But it wasn't, it was the ones that try to scream out "don't try"
But before I let these doubters be accessories to murder
I rise from the ground and X to the V emerges
No plans for Russian, I'm in the Bat cave planning something
Even Rosa parked it so she could stand for something
This world empty as a Soda Can my hand is crushing
It's just a never ending story when you stand for nothing

[Outro]
The sky ain't a limit it's just another illusion
We can get through it all if we just keep on moving (3x)

The sky ain't a limit it's just another illusion
We can get through it all if we
Can have what we want be what we want
