[Hook]:
I got all kind of logos in my closet, come and see
Nike Airs in ice cream match my first draft tees
I got all kind of logos in my closet, come and see
Like Lacoste shirts with my Evisu jeans
I got all kind of logos in my closet, come and see
Bathing Apes and Akademiks with the baps on my feet
I got all kind of logos in my closet, come and see
Avirex and LRG, you ain't fly like me

[Verse One]:
Man I'm fresh to death you should check my posts
Check the tag that be on my clothes
Expensive bags when I head back home
Don't know the size, don't try shit on
How about this X, yeah that look good
I like that there, I knew you would
Rhinos and alligators, on my shirt in different flavors
Man who says, "Some people can't feed themselves."
While my mind closed like, "I need that belt."
But when you worked hard and you wanna look good
Sometimes you gotta go out and treat yourself
See I used to couldn't buy those shoes
So when I hit the mall man I gotta buy two
I walk into the store, they know about dude
And I even playing man, come into my room

[Verse Two]:
You see my L.O.G.O.s is just so F.A.B.O
And I don't wear none of them clothes that you can find the store
I got this girl named Awzan
She's ship it straight from Japan
I wear it up to the mall and niggas be like "Dizzzamn!"
Chicks be checking me out while they is out with they man
And they boyfriend tap me like, "Yo where'd you get that my man?"
I tell 'em "Youcantaffordit.com so get up off it
But if you bring your girl I'll let you check out my closet."
