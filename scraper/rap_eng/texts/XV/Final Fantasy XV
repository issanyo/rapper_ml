[Verse 1]
As I hop on my bike
Imagine these Vizzy, you imagine these Vizzy ass nights
Tryin to save the world and get the girl
Im like cloud strife
Shinra HQ, the industry hates you
So fight, for your right
And maybe not tonight
But someday, one day they all gonna believe
That everything they said that Ill achieve
It didn't come fast like highway speed
So I Tokyo drift to a place in my dreams
Tryin to get paid, money longer than Sephiroth's blade
But everything is never what it seems
But I stay with hope, came here till I leave
The future of you final fantasy me
Ya diiig

[Hook]
Lookin like a star, its who I wanna be
How can I complain, my life kinda sweet
This place that I go, I never wanna leave
The future of you final fantasy me
My life bright like Tokyo scene
My life bright like Tokyo scene
So I stay awake no holdin on dreams
Where we bout to go, I hope that you see
The future of you final fantasy me (x2)

[Verse 2]
Maybe Aeris was right
The promised land is near and I gotta get there by the night
Can't miss my flight
Tell me have you ever left everything with the hopes of being right
Well I might
Shine bright as halos and my flow bring energy like Mako
When I stay fresh like a day old
See what Ive become, and thats when the hate shows
What try and take it outside like play clothes
Small time niggas just mad caus they ain't grow
No win nigga, thats why you ain't blow
Never think they dont see what you can't show
I never once asked for what I ain't owe
So anyone ever say Im juiced up
No way Jose Canseco

[Hook]
