[Verse 1 - Los]
I used to wheelie the bike, dribble the ball
Now I'm balling when I travel - no dribble at all
I used to run suicides impressing my coach
Now I fly like I quit the team, I ain't messing with coach
I watched Michael Jordan take flight, Hammer do the type writer
My 1st freestyles came as a bike rider
Cause I used to spin the handle bars 'round
And that's quite a spin cause I handle bars now
I used to play hide and go seek on the roof
Now the roof play hide and go seek in my coupe
Uh, I used to clean off my sneakers with my tooth brush
Now my shoe game floss a little too much
But I'm exactly what my hood need
I been macking since Ewing had good knees
Geez, say hello to the problem
Cause now I'm watching Melo at the Garden
I'm thinking that...

[Hook]
Life got colder
Had a chip on my shoulder
But I got a lil older
And the world don't owe ya
Not for no bluffing when they ask me how I did it
I tell 'em that I push it to the limit
Nigga I gotta
Get Get Get it
Get Get Get it
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Get it [2x]
If you came up poor in the hood like me
And just wanted to know what the good life be
Watching all the hustlers in the big body cars
Wrist full of ice, living life like a star
Nigga you gotta
Get Get Get it
Get Get Get it
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Get it [2x]

[Verse 2 - XV]
Blessing this game and it still ain't saved
They say Johnson is Magic: labels still don't AID
Killing these blood suckers but I still ain't Blade
But I'm still going off like my bills ain't paid
But my dues are, whose bars in the game like Pooch Hall
Me and Seven co-op like a coupe with only two doors
Get it? That's a coup, motherfucker
These bitches see no roof and go woof to a nigga
I used to watch Star Wars and act like Darth Vader
Now these princesses swallow up my light saber
I used to just play Donkey Kong Country
Now I go bananas all over the damn country
Came out of Kansas, they say we a little country
So I'mma blow us up till we our own little country
Been this way since King Kong was just a baby monkey
When haters was jive turkeys and cool was just funky
1985, we're watching Voltron and MacGyver
Put together the pieces to set the city on fire
Not for no bluffing when they ask me how I did it
I tell 'em That I push it to the limit
Nigga I gotta

[Verse 3 - Los]
They like, oh shit the crown ain't safe, Los snapping
You took the words right out my mouth like closed caption
Cause no passion matching mine
And there no one will mash it up with the mastermind
Huh??
How you passing me, I'll leave ya
I don't know no limits like Master P with amnesia
I used to watch Rambo with the ammo in the shotgun
Then I watched Randal when he scrambled in the shotgun
I still play freeze tag with my main crew
I mean I don't but my watch and my chain do
I'm talking Rice and Montana
Now promoters wan' know what's my price in Montana
I say I'm from the Murder where they cook it on the burner
And they whip it in the pot, before they put it on the corner
Nigga welcome to the spot, wanna know what I'mma learn ya?
First rule: mind ya business if the shit just don't concern ya
