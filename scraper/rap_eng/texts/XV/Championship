Vizzy, Alright...alright
Layover!

[XV]
X to V, pedigree
They're my dogs let'em eat
Who brought them? tell'em me
Them my A's, let'em be
Brought the world let'em see
Brought some girls give'em D-
I-C-K-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P
Seven, Woody, Omen here, Yup, Vizzy Zone is near, Yup
You should throw a beer like Stone Cold is here
That chick a stunner and I want her so I show her clear
Crystal, pistols outside my window kept me in doors like...
Stay inside making rhymes, playing restless Golden Eye
Multi-playing, taking lives, now my life ain't it fine
Now my wife ain't she fine, thicker than a sneaker shop
Where niggas gotta wait in line
Kid with the backpack green is the color I'm...
Tic-Tac-Toe ho, ya'll niggas is number signs
My name next to X's, make them X's see them O's
From my necklace to my toes, I am just as I'm supposed, Oh
Full moon howling coming, Cool dude now they love it
Step inside the booth
You can probably here my growling stomach
Belt around my waist aye! what can you tell me
The pedigree is left of me, Hunter Hearst Helmsly

[Talking]
We just having fun, Layover

[XV]
This is me at an all time high
Like a clock that flies
In the opposite of never-ever buy
Unheard-of like loch ness rhymes
Or a pot that shines
Rainbows full of gold at the end of these lines
I'm right flow make a left
I'm cold as naked breast
V is the maker of the D-Generation X
Me? Yeah they say he next, Word
Yeah they say he that
I can't give the game a rest
But I'll try and take a breathe, (Breathes)
Mushroom Kingdom, fighting Bowser
Jumping Bullets, fire flowers
Princess in the higher tower
Watch me go and get her
Louis V bag with Luigi in the back
That's my green backpack fam
You ain't fucking with us
So shell up like a Koopa Troopa
Every rhyme I spit is suit'ta
Hit them in the head like Goombas
Flatten them like Phillips
Cause yall niggas is screw ups
And I'm a sharp shooter
Bret Hart yes yall its the championship nigga

I'm a champion, shorty I'm champion
I've been around the world
Now I'm on my victory lap again
I'm a champion, homie I'm a champion
Your girl is bout to leave and she ain't never coming back again
Tell'em what she told me [8x]

Yeah Vizzy Zone, we almost there
Yeah! Layover!
