[Intro] [XV talking]:
I've been talking about Complex all this time, I wanna go back and talk about the making of it

[Verse One]:
Cooped up for five days, feel like this is the one
Complex kinda feel like my son
I started back in 2005 with a couple songs
And fans started feeling what I was on so I kept doing
Kept writing along
I just felt the flow around me
Complex cause I felt that niggas ain't need to know about me
So I kept a shell around me
Showed them what they wanted to see
But in the end it just wasn't me
See the person on the street wasn't the person on the beat
And it took awhile for both of 'em to meet
I was trying to push Energy as a definite single
And Seven said, "That just ain't how I see you."
Cause when he heard the real Hoff he told me it feels forced
I cancelled the video shoot and peeled off
Of course I ain't give up on the album I just started from scratch
So I hooked up with Seven man we just was a match
Couldn't reach M1 and Reena couldn't come
Dream Killers is my shit so we had to get it done
Booked the best lab in the midwest
The kid was stressed
Cause I had to make sure my shit was the best
Two days before we went in M1 gave the call
Did two songs on the album, unbelievable y'all
Bling gave a crazy verse on the album it was magic
Now we out to make it a classic

[Chorus]:
It Feels Like The First Time I said X To The V
I Give You Everything I have until You Got Me
Dream Killers couldn't stop me so this Songs For You
Stare & Whisper all you want while I ride on Cruise
Well Hello, what's your name?
Mine's X to the Vizzy
I'm from the Other Side Of Town but I'm the King Of The City
I'm still that Boy From Kansas but When I Dream
My grandma tells me that I'm the next best thing
It Feels Like The First Time I said X To The V
I Give You Everything I have until You Got Me
Dream Killers couldn't stop me so this Songs For You
Stare & Whisper all you want while I ride on Cruise
Well Hello, what's your name>
Mine's X to the Vizzy
I'm from the Other Side Of Town but I'm the King Of The City
I'm still that Boy From Kansas but When I Dream
My grandma tells me that I'm the next best thing
