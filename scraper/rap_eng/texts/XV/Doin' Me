[Hook: XV]
I've been on the top for a minute
So no wonder why it's cool
I'm the dude that they hatin' on
And I ain't going to stop, till the day that I drop
So you haters might be waiting long
So tell me what they gonna do with me (do with me)
When I am that dude you can be (you could be)
But homie you can't, and haters just won't
Let me continue doin' me

[Verse 1: JC Flow]
I'm so sick, I'm so ill, go ahead and call yo' mamma
I flow like H2O from Mexico, Tijuana
My style breaks ground, smoke y'all like marijuana
I've been carvin' out the amazon, starvin' like piranhas
People askin' questions, but I ain't that Dalai Lama
Although my rhymes do make ya' mind, feel like Nirvana
People love to hate me, they call me a Prima donna
I could make love and hate mate, and make a saint out of Madonna
I'm just doin' me, yeah, Neo, Da Vinci, I got my own niche
That's why I'm Michelangelo, and ya'll producing that Kitsch
Try to cop my style, but I've been hittin' this switch, I am the matrix (yeah)
I'm turn these rhymes into dimes, ya'll be spitting quotes
Y'all websites hella' fast, but mine makes widget's choke
If hustle was a program, I might as well have wrote it
I'm pushing out upgrades like Microsoft blood doped it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: JC Flow]
Haters hate, stick together like Twix
But I be turnin' up the heat, they melted in my fist
The industry needed a man who can deliver this fix
Like High Def needed Blu-ray and DVDs needed Netflix
Open up gates like Stephen Kings "The Mist"
Lettin' monsters out who ain't nothing but straight pissed
A major league of white teeth I'm rippin' out ya limbs
Swing like Griffey, hittin' you with the soggy ends
I keep doin' me, ya'll keep being haters
I keep pushin' you back, but I flip it like I'm mater
I can summon the force, my flows be Darth Vader
My rhymes so organic, they greener than Ralph Nader
Y'all jams, they ain't half bad
But I've been taken care of all, this rap creative math
I'm working out a way to add up my fans so fast
(Check it) y'all know the proff is in session
