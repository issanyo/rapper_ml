[Hook]
I like my beat loud, I like my bass up
Windows tinted so them haters can't see
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
I turn on Xbox, I pour some drink up
Invite some honeys to the place where I be
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha

[Verse 1: XV]
I turn my beat up, kick my feet up with a diva by the speakers
Never change for the streets, nah, I don't pay the meters
And I don't got it made, but don't that boy clean up
Flyer than Mario feathers and Jermey Scott Adidas
And yo girl, yeah yo girl, she ain't trying to see you
Yawning cause all your Mac is tired like Reba
Fire up the sativa
Never liked jocks, so I be hidin' in the bleachers with a fine cheerleader
Down under with a square, I sponge her
You Kobe number 8, she no longer wants your number
Bummer dude
Been this way since I wore Thundercat underroo's
Banging like a hummer with 22-inch suberwoofs
I'm a number 2, ketchup only apple pie kind of guy
Never been like one of you, only been like one XV
In a room with a bunch of yous, in case they wonder what I love to do

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
I mean, I'm in Hollywood acting bad like Nicholas Cage
Face off for the sub, that shit gonna bang
If she underage mang we send 'em away
Cause I ain't trying to get screened In a cinema way
Now you feeling awesome, Vizzy good come from the city's hood
Deuce one to get out of the slums, I did pretty good
I would keep my dreams in my head but they don't fit me good
Trying to take the world for Bobby like Whitney could
Xbox gamerscore achiever, live show killer
Squarian believer, I'm a fresh T popping, fly ass nigga
Bass low and let it blast nigga cause

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
I'm like Jimmy Neutron meets Huey Newton
Rolls Royce whipping, Grey Poupon
The square on top of his green like croutons
Kansas boy trying to blow up the planes, no shoe bomb
Who's Don, well they call him Vizzy
Or Prince Akeem, I keep a semi with me
Haters envy they just keep killin' me like Kenny
But they girl try to hit me like, "What you like Vizzy?"
