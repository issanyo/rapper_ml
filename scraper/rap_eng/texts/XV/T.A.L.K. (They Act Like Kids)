[Verse 1]
The Kid with the Green Backpack
Told the kid with the Velcro shoes he likes someone in class
And he told the girl with the African medallion
Built like a stallion she had a nice ass
The girl with the African medallion
Went and started pouting and ran out of class real fast
The kid with the Velcro shoes
Never knew who he told that to, was abused by her dad
The kid with the Velcro shoes
Wasn't cool in the eyes of the school cause his family was broke
And when he talk to girls he don't mean to sound rude
He just always listen to the words of Tone Loc
He was tryna do the wild thing urgent
But everybody heard he was a virgin
And that got past to every person
They act like kids so the rumors will hurt em

See everybody knows 'round the globe cause they all gon' talk
They all gon' talk
And everything she say he gon' say cause they all gon' talk, they all gon' talk
And you know if he knows and she knows
That everybody's gonna go talk, they gon' talk, they gon' talk

[Verse 2]
The Kid with the Green Backpack
Told the kid with the Star Wars shirt about all of his plans
He wanna be a big rapper but before that
First he wanna ask her to the dance
The Kid with the Star Wars shirt
Has a deal with a jerk that likes to solve things with his hands
'Til the jerk met a bigger jerk that will put him in a hearse
After he finds out what he tucks in his pants
The Kid with the Letter Jacket
Asked the kid with the Leather Jacket about the girl in the Mini
The kid with the leather jacket
Told the kid in the letter jacket that she give it up a plenty
And that kid heard that shit from another kid
Who said she gave head like a hippie
Little did many ever know that the girl in the Mini
Kept it slow, wouldn't give it up to any

[Verse 3]
The Kid with the Pink Fanny pack be trippin'
Now everybody wonder why he so different
Some say some heard in some way that sons gay and he don't like women
So every guy stays away from him in gym
Don't change around him when we go swimmin'
The Kid with the Blisters told me he has five sisters
And he don't really even know the difference
The kid with the Bomber Jacket and the pager
Infatuated with the makin' of the paper
Defined by the sag in his pants and the rings on his hands
Labeled as bad news by his neighbors
But one day he wanna be famous
Deals with the stereotypes of a gangster
He doesn't have a brush to alter how he's painted
They act like kids and that never ever changes
