Hate it or love it, I'm the definition of it

Hate the cost to be the boss
I don't gotta prove it
Forget trying to floss
Nigga, I just gotta do it
Your mixtapes is all talk
You just gotta move it
Niggas come to me with dreams and I tell 'em to pursue it
King of the city
This ain't cocky, this a movement
So tell me there's a problem with that
We can solve it like that
Snap of a finger
I'm happy that you lingered around
Just so you cats can go a finger me out
Tell the cops I'm the one who threw a brick in your house
If I did it, hell, I did it
Take the case and admit it
Ain't a gangster ain't a banger
Just a Christian with a vision
So tell me there's a problem with that
Nigga, John Hoffa is back
In the city, just got back from NY
Me and Sez, B took over Harvard just to get fly
Am I
So braggadocios. just absorbed with myself
When all those rappers needed beats I would lend 'em my help
Pay them no mind
Cause I'm gonna fend for myself
In the end, when my fake friends turn from the wealth
I saw them heads get bigger around the same time
I saw Feds taking pictures just cause I rhyme
They want me in the box like C Murder and Sean
Cause I bring the hood a message without bringing up Nas
And I'm
What you'd call the future of rap
Martin Luther
Shroud over my shoulder and it's far from being over, nigga
