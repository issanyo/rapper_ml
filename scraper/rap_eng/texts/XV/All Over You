[Intro: CrushBoys]
Baby I can't wait to be all over you

[Hook: CrushBoys & XV]
Baby we had a time (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
We pressed rewind (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
For tonight (Unh, unh)
Though I said it's over for myself [?]
Baby I can't wait to be all over you
(I.can't.wait.To.Be.All.Over.You.)
Though I said it's over for myself

[Verse 1: XV]
Look, I felt like this would all work
Break up, hang up, make you call first
That's my job, so when you off work
I take off like skrrr and you take off skirt
Kenan & Kel, they say "you all that"
The type to hang up with just a call back
So give the rest room, you just can't stall that
Her ex bring up (what?), summer tell him fall back
Lay back in my ride and puff lye
And don't about your ass or front side
Then you hit me like "baby come by"
I be on it in a flash, cause that's that jump drive
And I can't wait to scream out "fuck you!"
'Til you can't wait to scream back "fuck me!"
Mr., Mrs. Smith, she wished we could be
But she digging up the past, Angelina Jolie

[Verse 2: XV]
High heels and high standards (unh)
Always saying "hi" to the camera (unh)
And I try to say "bye, I can't stand ya"
But then you ride 'til no is not an answer
Riding like Winona through good times like Willona
Even if I'm still on the corner like [?]
You got me, I got you, you know this is not new
We've been this way since we came together in high school
She going "Where the fuck have you been? I seen your twitter."
I'm like "who the fuck is this new friend? Is he your nigga?"
(Then I) then I tried to pretend that I didn't kiss her
Get her to reconsider and witness the bigger picture
She replying "like I'm all over you
But my eyes is looking all over you"
And then them hands is going all over you
Then I said "What about your man?"
She said "It's all over, you?"
