[Intro: Lorenzo Asher]
You know it's a brave new world we're living out. We're keeping it surreal, and not so real
No, you can't be that brave and be alive. Can I?

[Bridge: Lorenzo Asher]
Or, is it bad that I'm fatally allergic
To bee stings but would jump in a hive for this person?
That's brave
I can't be that brave
Can I?
That's brave

[Verse One: Lorenzo Asher]
And victory loves preparation
Rush greatness, now she late but that's brave
She can't be that brave
Oh my
That's brave
But that's great
So fly, so fly

So I become a recluse
In this darkness of a home, afraid of becoming a slave
To the youth and their ways
(To their ways)
Now that's brave
(Now that's brave)
Maybe too bathe
So I do
It's late
I take two
To stay awake as I contemplate a fortune, a fortune, a fortune
Or misfortune, a blow torch and
Well, that's brave (that's real brave)
Why, that was all that I have saved
I say I can't be that brave
Goodbye
How are you?
You, you, you
The important, that feel unimportant
Two little orphans, try to escape now that's brave (that's brave)
So brave (so brave)
You can fly, I can too
I can too

[Verse Two: Lorenzo Asher]:
How ironic us all to meet on this plane
So little in common, yet we are all the same
Addicted to the high, we'll die needle in vain
Like Jesus's name at a Mexican hospital or a hospice in Spain
Hostile take over, I must side with Bane
Why must I feel pain or feel plain when it rains
While kings go unscathed?
Priests go unclothed in front of the child's play
Story goes untold, explaining the run away
For she who was laid with social worker, Miss Tay
The two orphan boys had vanished for she was late
I, in love with her, stung by bees on the way
Heading to the diocese pretending to want to get saved
Never did we imagine that growing out with a bang
Meant going out in an explosion, explosives taking our name
For that very day, terrorist hijacked the train
So, I jumped into that bee hive but in this case with these three guys
With detonators and hand guns and planes
Bang
I take three shots to each side
But that distraction means time
In the meantime
So the passengers kill all three with rage
Saved
Now that's brave
Brave
Brave!
Brave

[Bridge: Lorenzo Asher]
Or, is it bad that I'm fatally allergic
To bee stings but would jump in a hive for this person?
That's brave
I can't be that brave
Can I?
That's brave

[Verse Three: XV]
We're taking shots to ignore the pain
It's Novocain and everything you overcame shows you brave
Look what it has became of our heroes
Fiddle while Rome burns like Neo
So I try to find a way on the page to say this hasn't been in vain
And my dude who been in chains
Waiting for me to reign just to say "That boy from Kansas is Brave"
Brave
Is that what they say?
Dang
I came from a broken home, cold hallways with an open stove
Christian belief, cause Heaven's where everybody hope they go
But I'll be totally gone, going along
Smoking my bong, knowing they wrong
My auntie got cancer, I wrote her a song, to show her she's strong
Life's long if you make it, watch how you take it
God gave us a canvas, don't paint it
The color of ignorance, persuaded by worldly interests
Can fill it with hatred
If there's a promised land
I hope that we make it based on of braveness
Be brave
Brave new world
