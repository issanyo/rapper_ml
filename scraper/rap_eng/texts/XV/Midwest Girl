[Intro: XV]
Haha. Dedicated to the girls. Well, not all the girls. Haha

[Hook: XV]
See I've been to New York and I've been to L.A
But ain't nothing like a midwest girl, you know that
I've been up north and I've been down south
But ain't nothing like a midwest girl
See see
I've been to New York and I've been to L.A
But ain't nothing like a midwest girl, you know that
I've been up north and I've been down south
But ain't nothing like a midwest girl

[Verse 1: XV]
Give a chick my number she gonna call all night
Till she get into the sheets like the bars I write
I've been wanting this shit all my life
But now that it has happened
I'm like, "It's all alright"
But what I really like is a chick that ain't in tights
Sweatpants, tees and Nikes, plays X-Box all night
Likes to chill out, don't be out acting foolish
Midwest girls are the coolest
I fool with
Girls from all over from Kansas to Minnesota
Some girls call it pop, some girls call is soda
Either way, if you fit the midwest quota
I'mma get her to try to swallow like Jonah
"Oh yuck" she said
"Oh shucks, I meant
That in a good way. I joke, I kid."
Sexy ass midwest legs and them heels
When you gon' let me Meet them Parents, I've been still/Ben Still

[Hook: XV]

[Verse 2: Bayno]
See, see, see
She's fed well, beans and cornbread
Hair straight down with her bangs on her forehead
A stallion, like she walk on four legs
And homegirls a tornado in the bed
Find her in the Lou, shopping at the galleria
Those heels got her on her toes like a ballerina
Ha, and she be at the bar scene weekly
A party in the dress, handle business in a three piece
Big bright smile, pretty white teeth
? hot blue, denim fitted white tee
Cinnamon skin, compliments of Prada
Ya, ya gotta thank God for her momma
And I gotta give props to her dad
For buying her that big ass bed for us to smash
Midwest girls be the richest girls
So if you got game you can share that cash
