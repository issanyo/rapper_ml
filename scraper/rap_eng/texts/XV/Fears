[XV]:
They get Chrono Metro Phobia when they realize it's my time
I'm sonning these niggas like Edward in the sun, watch how I shine
Twilight
Full Eclipse for real
That's how I grind
It might have been too complex
I'm just direct like these is hot lines
If it's not mine
Then you better eject your USB driver is no longer detected
They say I'm a dick but I'm killing this shit
So fuck all of that, I'm fully erected
So fuck the world with no glove
Cause no glove means no love
Went to Cleveland to get B. Sims
Now I'm riding around bumping Bone-Thugs
With a couple hoes cruising to get to get the night popping
Standing next to males man/Mailman, you like John Stockton
A few college girls on spring break from John Hopkins
We stayed out until the sun came up like Bill Compton
Pill popping and lean sipping
In Houston that dream tipping
Just me and my dawg/dog like Pete Griffin
Up on your tippy toes afraid to reach the top
I know we high and it's a lot
So all I ask is if you coming
Give me everything you got
