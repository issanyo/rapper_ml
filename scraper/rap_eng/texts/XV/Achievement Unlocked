[Verse 1:]
Xbox sound and they found them a beast
I was grounded in sound like I wouldn't be unleashed
I told Seven make me like 45 beats
And all it takes so much like 45 leaks
Babble on, you back on Babylon on your feet
I'm high in the sky that's why I can't be reached
The KKK ain't go through this many sheets. Yeesh!
Please leave a message at the beep
Achievement unlocked, gamerscore peaked
They're waiting for the drop like a song 'bout to leak
And I just dropped eighty new songs in a streak
Tell Wayne I can't be beat
Went from a zero to hero like Hiro on heroes
King of the world, Leonardo DiCaprio
You can see where my buzz 'bout to be
Just about as big as Texas sized bumblebees now

[Hook:]
Tell your family tell your friends
This my mosh pit please jump in
Cause we all the champions
DJ play that song again
This the theme song at the end
When the losers finally win
I paid my dues I reached the top
The achievement is unlocked
The achievement is unlocked

[Verse 2:]
My addiction is pulp fiction
The fact is sometimes I'm just missing
My freestyles sound like super good written
So I be out of the booth good riddance
Some niggas don't care who's listenin'
They stealing food from a bear who's fishin'
So I got a brand new mission
So I stopped rapping became a musician
A guitar hero like Hiro on heroes
Bringing y'all heat, Robert De Niro
A few sleepless nights and then it was Cheadle
Just to touch up my ego, yer-digg

[Hook:]
