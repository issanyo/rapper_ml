[XV]
Kinda like
Tryin' to talk money with niggas that ain't paid
Like dudes who preach freedom but ain't slaves
I'm tryin' to make
The decision of my life
Got me feelin' like
Lebron James on the phone with Dwyane Wade
Sometimes I can't take these bloggers with fake names
Instant messages make them think they can take AIM
And they say "disappear" like Dave Blaine
Before your world come crashing harder than freight trains
Niggas stay makin' claims that they the brains behind the operation
But I promise they ain't crane
Say thangs, make 'em pray that I stay sane
Or will I change my face up goin' down in Jay's lane
And don't wanna see what I become when I am done
And you are gone into the fog and I must face the rising sun
You can't design it from the floor to the ceiling
If you ain't gonna live in the building
But I'm just chillin'
