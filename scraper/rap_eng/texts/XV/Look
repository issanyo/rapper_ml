[Intro]
Look, look nigga, look
Look, look nigga, look
Nigga look, look, look, look

[Verse 1]
Nigga look
Niggas see me out and about
With a crowd, gather 'round
That's a guy from my town

Nigga look
He be on that new shit
Haters ain't gon' do shit
But copy the blueprints

Go ahead and look
I ain't on Instagram lookin' at some pictures man
I ain't got the time, let them other niggas look
Waiting at the bus stop, gotta be butt shots
Damn there's only one thot

Damn nigga look
Cats put they hand on the book
On the stand, hella shook
See they man and they can't even look

I don't give the time to the rhymes
With them lies
Bumping Plies as I ride to my side

Nigga Look
You ain't gonna Last King
When them niggas blasting
Put the two O's to that shit

Nigga Look
Yeah, you took an L, okay
For you come this way
Better check both ways

Nigga Look
When my nigga left that night
Said he had to chef that white
Let that nigga cook

Yeah you got ass in the pants
But you got mad at a glance
Let that nigga look

But you know the shit look fly
Thinkin' as a nigga walk by
"Bet that nigga look"

And you damn right I will
But you better know I'm still
That nigga, look

[Hook]
All I know is there should be no reason
All I know is there should be no reason
All I, all I know is there should be
All I know
All I, all I know is there should be no reason
All I know, you know it, and you know it
Look at what, reason
