[Hook]:
I'm up in the sky
High up in the air
I be looking down
All I see are Squares
All I see are Squares
The city's never there
When you're up in the clouds
All you see are Squares
Why?
I'm up in the sky
High up in the air
I be looking down
All I see are Squares
All I see are Squares
The city's never there
When you're up in the clouds
All you see are Squares

[Verse One]:
A nigga used to be
Down in bikini bottom
My dreams of reaching the stardom
Was slimmer than a small project towns gossip column
Cold as the heart of Gollum
My momma told me, "Don't swear unless you say it's solemn"
I got 'em
Going crazy over these flows I'm jotting
Hoes is jocking, want me deeper than a row of Spartans
But I rock a Trojan condom
I know the flow is rotten
I keep my fans spoiled
And keep on dropping hotness
You would think my hands boil
I done make my queen royal
I done keep my team loyal
Until my whole fam rules like O'Doyle
A teacher told me my options where jail or cold soil
And I'll be damned if that man's plans don't foil
The L7 weeny, never on the team that's winning
When we did they said we're cheating cause we all had Game Genies
They don't believe me man
It seems I'm dreaming
It's a world they ain't used to seeing
Meaning...

[Hook]:
I'm up in the sky
High up in the air
I be looking down
All I see are Squares
All I see are Squares
The city's never there
When you're up in the clouds
All you see are Squares
Why?
I'm up in the sky
High up in the air
I be looking down
All I see are Squares
All I see are Squares
The city's never there
When you're up in the clouds
All you see are Squares

[Verse Two]:
Ain't it funny how
They jog with they jaws
I call it running mouths
They told me, "Come back down"
But I love the clouds
I think I'm ready for the world
Let me love you down
They used to call us "Squares"
Look how it comes around
Like propellers, tell the teller I need change
No Obama, a couple commas make mommies go insane
And it's strange
I'm just a boy from a home on the range
Now they opening lanes so my plane can fly in rain
Ain't it shame
I went from being so lame
To saying that I'm your maine
You lying/lion, where's your mane?
That's pussycat, looking back
Now I'm all up in your brain
Like an MRI, but I've been up in your eyes like a retina vein
Back in the game, set the stage like prop hands
I never slack, these other cats are cop pants
Big plans when my plane lands
Until then I'm Souljah Boy dance
Super...Man

I'm up in the sky

I'm up in the sky
High up in the air
