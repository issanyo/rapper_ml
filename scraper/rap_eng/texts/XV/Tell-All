[HOOK]
See I could tell you how to hustle
(I could never tell it all)
I could tell you how to ball
(I could never tell it all)
I could tell you 'bout the struggle
(I could never tell it all)
Cause I done been through it all
(I could never tell it all)
I could tell you 'bout the rise
(I could never tell it all)
I could tell you 'bout the fall
(I could never tell it all)
I could tell you everything
(I could never tell it all)
But I could never tell it all
(I could never tell it all)
No, I could never tell it all

[Verse 1]
A hero is born, July 9, '85
Fifteen years later, had my mind on the grind
Came out of Kansas but I made my own lane
Now I'm cruising down this thang on the my 35
Feel like it hasn't been hard in this life of mine
My rap sheets look neat without a life of crime
Mom can't find the phone, pops can't find the time
Sometimes I got through the nights just by writing rhymes
I finalize this new script that I got in mind
And shorty got a son that wasn't mine
Now I gotta shine on my own, rise on my own
In the dark, had to find a light on my own
The aftermath of when the levee break
Mind flooded with thoughts make a nigga meditate
Instead I vacate like I'm Chevy Chase
Get bread and cake, come back and show'em how to bake

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Never broke down for dollars, I hardly change at all
Still fucking with porn stars, bet I'll name'em all
Still in the club, feelin' titties up like a training bra
Still waiting on Halle Berry to make the call
I've seen it all as I ball, it was crystal clear
That my fortune would tell which friends will disappear
And start bouncing like the checks on counting
Thinkin' you reach your peak cause they ain't seen a tall mountain
When it comes to flowin', I chose to become a poet
Intrigued by my senses, indulged in the moment
Y'all bitches trying to show up soon as the show end
Them hoes been thrown into everybody, hope you know it
I bet that bitch could write a tell all book
The announcement alone have you rappers all shook
And I can't wait to read my chapter cause I bet that's G
Never love'em, face fuck'em, and that's just me (haha)
