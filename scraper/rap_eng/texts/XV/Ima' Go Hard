[Hook - XV]
They know I go hard
And nobody's telling me different
I'm getting in how I'm living
And if you don't see the vision
Go home
Cause I'm riding like four tires
Down to your wires
Until I retire
Ima' go hard
Go hard (x3)
Or I'ma go home
Go home (x3)

[Verse 1 - JC Flow]
Yes sir
Listen
Check it out
No sir, no man
It's not a bird to a plane
It's the JC Flow
Sweeping down on this game
Y'all didn't even know this
'till I wrote this man
I came it to bring it raw
So I coast this, man
Never gonna quit this
Until I get this throne
Breathing life into this game
Through my microphone
Emcee's keeping the game warm
Like a sweater
I been turning up the temperature
Mojave Desert
Breaking teeth with my tracks
Call me Mr. Gobstopper
Trynn'a hold me back
But I am a chart topper
So go hard or go home
Skating fast for this gold
I pull out on to whip my foes [????]

[Bridge - JC Flow]
Bright lights, bright lights
In my city
You can find me living
VIP, so
Watch me pop these charts
Like a bottle of the bubbly
I'm that JC Flow

[Hook]
