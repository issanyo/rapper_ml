[Intro]
Swaggy

[Hook: XV]
Said she want to roll, what you trying to do?
Said you want to win, what you got to lose
L7 squares, we're them kind of dudes
So turn it up, you got it dude

(x2)
You got it dude
You got it dude
Turn it up
You got it dude

[Verse 1: Freddy High, XV, Sez Batters]
[FH]
Square gang, Mötley Crüe
These bitches want to roll around the world, amazing race like Boppers do
[XV]
Smoking Mary with Kate and Ashley, cause it ain't nasty if it's not in twos
So in two bars, I'm too cold, with two broads in a two door
[SB]
Batters up, tatted up, body like a chulo
Mad at us, status up, my dogs be on Pluto
Roof low, no top dude, them hoes fall when I drive through
I'm back up so I got two
[XV]
If I got two
[SB]
Then you got two
[FH]
Well let me get one
My niggas going in, let me get some
[XV]
I just want to win for the end come
Til dollars come in our income
Til we hit the lot' like pick One
[SB]
That's mine
[FH]
And fuck your circles a tag line
[XV]
Put it in the air like the bat sign
[SB]
Twos up, at sign

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddy High, Sez Batters, XV]
[XV]
I remember when they didn't use to pay me much
[FH]
And now we're squares everywhere like the Brady Bunch
If we step up in the spot, I'll bet your lady bug
[XV]
Your girl's backstage with us
[SB]
We got you singing, bruh
[FH]
Bringing back my lady cause
You got it, dude

[Hook]
