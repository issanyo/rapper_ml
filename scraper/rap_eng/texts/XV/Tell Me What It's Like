[Hook] [XV]:
So I heard you getting out there, finally getting shine
Your CD coming out, yeah?!
Tell me what it's like
Tell me what it's like
Tell me what it's like
I seen you on that TV, that article was nice
Red carpets, white parties
Tell me what it's like
What it's like nigga?!
Tell me what it's like

[Verse One] [XV]:
Well oh well, I promise to tell no tales
This game ain't what it's cracked up to be, LOL
Seinfeld
Is canned laughter to this rapper
Even fans be bugging (how?)
Like Stan spelled backwards
Watching my back like a man ran backwards
Never hit the trees, stay away from them trappers
Can't go out to parties
People who know me make people who don't know me uncomfy
And that ain't fun for nobody
I keep my circle tight like a virgin
Cause certain niggas I let in come out to be spy niggas working
And that's why I ain't got no friends
Picture a nigga trying to separate me from my paper like recycling bins
And I ain't signing, I'm making music I wanna make
And ladies is just frosting on the doe like funnel cakes
Sometimes I wanna break
Like Crazy Legs
But it's cool cause it was a long road to make it here

[Hook] [XV]:
So I heard you getting out there, finally getting shine
Your CD is coming out, yeah?!
Tell me what it's like
Tell me what it's like
Tell me what it's like
I seen you on that TV, that article was nice
Red carpets, white parties
Tell me what it's like
What it's like nigga?!
Tell me what it's like

[Verse Two] [D. Black]:
It's like pulling teeth with a knife and a string
The joys of success is only possible after acknowledging pain
Couldn't numb it with an ice pack, in search of the right track
Picked up with affliction, I'm admitting it was like crack
Had me on this mission with an addict
It's sitting at the MPC
Putting that loop on that Dramatics shit
Penning some traumatic shit
Illest shit I ever wrote
Link with illmind now I'm under the telescope
Khrysis said I'm "hella dope", deserving of 5 mics
Did a song with Skyzoo, now I'm on these blog sites
Dopeboyz, Nahright, OnSmash and DX
I'm a song away from penning my way out the BX
Manic saying, "We next"
He heard me on Prove Something
Albums can't get right
Now I can't do wrong
Flow is getting too strong
I am far from ave-y
I'm Stunting Like My Daddy
I'm in the booth with XV
