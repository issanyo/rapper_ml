[Verse One: Celeb Forever]
Prada luggage at the airport
All black Mazaratis when I land, nine cars already
I'm working on my tenth key
My watch shine turning niggas into Slick Rick, never let a bitch pimp me
Man, these hoes dying to get screwed nigga, Pimp C
But rest in peace Chad Butler and Aaliyah going 90 in an Aston
See you when I see you
Man, I met a girl yesterday, couldn't really keep up
Asked her who conditioned her
She said it was Tresemme
Asked her what her name was, she said it was Desiree
Put that Yeezy album in, she said she don't mess with 'Ye
I almost kicked her out but instead turned it up
Then I took her to the house, 15 minutes after lunch
What if we happen to kiss?
What if we happen to touch?
And we couldn't slow it down until enough had been enough
So she put back on her clothes acting like she in a rush
Said she not over her past and they just had broken up
Man I never get offended when they get back with they exes
Cause they need someone to Hold 'Em and I never been to Texas
Man
But my homie Boobie from out there
And he told me all women ain't the same
Probably cause he got Keisha, and it was nice to meet ya
But women, they tell the coldest lies, freezer
I just don't believe ya

[Verse Two: Donnis]
Show me what you here fo', show me what you here fo'
Take it all off, TSA, this the airport
Show that T&A, while I put it in the air ho
Ho...ho
I'mma make it rain dear/reindeer
Drop the mixtape and got signed in the same year
I relate to Vizzy baby, we got all the same things
Vizzy, Celeb Forever I just figured I'd make shit clear
The county nigga counting cash in some cashmere
My buzz light years/Buzz Lightyear ahead of y'all niggas
I heard Toy Stories told and seen them toys repoed
R.I.P. to C, all that liquor we poured?!
Trips to the coast but believe that we cold
Don't let the cars, girls, and boat shoes fool you
A slap to the face will have you feeling like a new you
Makeover if you will, if I make off with the mil
I'mma do the Madoff for the bill for real

[Verse Three: XV]
It always go, "I don't know your name, boy what song you sang?"
Call it cool, call it fame, I'll call you bluff and call it lame
I don't fuck with all the games, save that for the playoffs
Funny how my balls and chains got 'em going Adolf
Crazy
Then they take a glance and see how I do them tramps
Then focus on my mans, concentrating on my camp
Begging for the high life, even they man want my life
Guess I'm shining on son/sun, Edward on Twilight
High heels, high standards, high fashion, high price
Just to roll out with a nigga like the hot dice
Have her hitting high notes like all night
Kill that pussy, I don't give a fuck if it got nine lives
Then she around her friends and want to play pretend
Like, "What happened to your mans?
Oh yeah girl, we seen you."
And you be like, "We cool."
Man, I know I'm back at school, but I'm speaking for your crew
When we say we don't believe you
I don't believe you
