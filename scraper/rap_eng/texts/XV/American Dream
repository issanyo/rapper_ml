[Intro:]

It's early fall, there's a cloud in the New York skyline
Innocence, drags across a yellow line

[Verse One:]

Fresh off the boat
With a dream of stepping in a couple connections in murder and coke
Came dirty in the game like he never heard of soap
An underworld that he wanted to be over
Capone of his city with a committee to help him reach the throne
With a friendly friend to hold him down 'til he's all alone
Straight from the ghetto he thought he would never leave there
On the way up he looked down and said, "I don't want to be there"
In the end, he lost plenty of friends, including himself
He looked into the mirror, couldn't tell who he is
Looking at himself with blind eyes, the white lines did it
In the diction that didn't kick in, until he found that prison
That's still outside of jail but it's hell when you're living
With demons sending you see you soon cards, you're tripping
Not "b"s it was the "d"s that caught him in the sting
As his eyes finally opened he sees the American dream

[Hook:]

These are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America

[Verse Two]

Fresh off the block
With a dream of stepping in a couple connections in heroin and Glocks
And books said he was Captain Hook, he hated clocks
Hated thoughts of catching up, to the ticking of the tock
Had niggas working with the same vision on the block
One day they all say, man, Im'ma take his spot
So, always looking over his shoulder he knew it all could be over
In the instants of a click and then a shot
Cops will find his crimes more than organized
Figure this nigga can't be mafioso, he's lyin'
Sat down with duchess and luck he's up in his prime
Such a rise to the top, it was all so sublime
And it came; fast money, felt it in his abdomen
Tried to make fast money, like dealing rat again
Just to flash on the screen, like Nasdaq screens
With a triple beam to achieve the American dream

[Hook]
