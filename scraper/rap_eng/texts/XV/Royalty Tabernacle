[Verse One]:
Welcome to the church
Royalty tabernacle
I ain't here to floss, I ain't here to battle
I ain't here to talk, I ain't here to babble
I dabble in a couple words and start playing Scrabble
Roll out the G way, the D-U-B way
Talk is cheap so I spit out millions like it's easy
So if my teeth ever fall out, put 'em on Ebay
I bet you dudes will see pay in three days
Welcome to the church
Royalty tabernacle
Ladies up front, let me get a good look at you
You and you, please come and see me after
You go meet with my deacon Batters
A couple candy girls, with some Laffy Taffys
I see you looking at me
You wasn't looking past me
Don't think cause I run the church, I don't do the nasty
(What boy you nasty)
I know
Welcome to the church
Royalty tabernacle
Aye, what I say nigga? I don't wanna battle
Niggas expect me to always want to tussle
Matter of fact nigga, I don't even thumb wrestle
I don't box, I won't let one thumb touch you
I'll call the ushers up, let a couple guns bust you
Gon' hit your flock if I give the order even
Bring the bacon home if I include it in my order
You need to stop rapping my man
I seen better acting and rapping in the movie Kazaam
Damn
While my album dropping ruins your plans
And saying I ain't making dates with banging chicks who is fans
You never shook the hand of a man who said, "Thanks
I got all your mixtapes since they were tapes."
Aye, I'm the dude to make dudes hate you on your own label
Blackball you on your own pool table
Nigga welcome to the...
