[Hook] {x2}:
I'm in love, it's a beautiful day
I'm in love, it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weatherman say
It's a beautiful, it's a beautiful day

[Verse One] [XV]:
What a beautiful day in the middle west to blow like the Middle East
Feeling like I'm really blessed, I'm living to say the least
Running off a little rest, let me just go say my peace
Missed my first class, but still got time for breakfast at Micky Ds
And I'm fully dressed, fresh to death with no decease
Pants is pressed and I am pressed to make these people notice me
How you gonna look over me?
How them girls cold shoulder me?
Want me when that money start raking up like October leaves
And during lunch my momma want me to fill out applications
Instead I took my single up to the radio station
They never played, but I said, "Hey, it ain't a thang
That ain't surprising to me."
Like the black guy that dies in a scary movie
So let this new me, make them people who never knew me
Pick up they phone, give me a ring like they married to me
And let this day go with no drama
Cause racism is still alive but so is Obama
That's why

[Hook] {x2}:
I'm in love, it's a beautiful day
I'm in love, it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weatherman say
It's a beautiful, it's a beautiful day

[Verse Two] [Jabee]:
Can it be you make beautiful kids
Suitable, to the root of what beautiful is
Beautiful is everything beautiful does
A beautiful Crip bang on a beautiful Blood
(B-L double O-D)
O-D that's overdose
Too much for the sober folks
Love XV so close to home
Destruction zone
Come and eat in Rome, destruction holmes
So where they at?
Beautiful place in the middle of the map
Facts looks beautiful don't it?
Botox and a boob job on it
Tonto and the crew jump on it
If she fine and thick I'm Omen
Haha, had to laugh at that
D-O-A my assassin rap
Find the beauty in my madness jack
What Nino said when I pass the snap
Packing a mac in the back of the Ac
You can thank Big Pun for that
Beautiful, beautiful days, days like these
Nicely, nice weed
So beautiful, beautiful can't take you from me
They say, "God don't like ugly"
Ain't fond of beautiful either
TV with the beautiful people
Looking at that TV like, they ain't that beautiful either

[Hook] {x2}:
I'm in love, it's a beautiful day
I'm in love, it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weatherman say
It's a beautiful, it's a beautiful day

[Verse Three] [XV]:
What a beautiful day in the middle west to blow like the Middle East
When I tried to stand out the teachers told me "Take a seat"
Now I'm on my desk to speak to all my peers
They're saying, "Who's the new kid?" I've been there for years
The graduation cap they're scared to wear
Show and tell are you prepared to share?
Name your dream or chase your dream, truth or dare
Now I'm standing on this roof that I used to fear
That's past tense, class is in, now who is here?

[Jabee]:
Cheers
But nobody knows my name
Told them, "Call me Jabee" I'm just trying to make some change
Put my hood on when I do it
A loser sick of losing
Treadmill and still moving
My father taught me game and these girls just help me use it
I ain't out to be the man
Just out to make some music, and a living when I do it
Till God call me home for good where I stay
Tell my momma, don't cry it's a beautiful, beautiful day

[Hook] {x2}:
I'm in love, it's a beautiful day
I'm in love, it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weatherman say
It's a beautiful, it's a beautiful day
