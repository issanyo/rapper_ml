"Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis" - Eminem 'Low, Down, Dirty'

[Verse One]:
I got a split personality I dare you to challenge me
I put four in two of your boys batteries
Go ahead, blast at me
Knowing you got plates man, like Damon Waynes
Stop being fake man
If you got a girl then I'm snatching her
Your daddy giving doe to my mother
Your little sister lost a D to my brothers
They double teamed her like bumper to bumper
Hear your moms got down me your girl and me under the covers
I got a split personality so when I get cream I get my techo marines
Split right down the beam
And dawg I rock the illest garments, down to the jeans
Logos go right down the seam, you like what you see?
But don't ask me where I got it when I be on the scene
They probably only made one and I got it alright
Cause they know it fits hot I'll buy it double the price
Polo by Ben Sherman, checkered up looking nice
Right

[Hook]:
I'm complex you can't explain how my life is
"My split personality is having an identity crisis"
This is me, I can't explain why I'm like this
"My split personality is having an identity crisis"
I'm complex you can't explain how my life is
"Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis"
This is me, I can't explain why I'm like this
"My split personality is having an identity crisis"

[Verse Two]:
Let's switch it up
"Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis"
I spit it for my black people, fist in the air
Please take what you can get while you here
Cause they don't want us they scared
We solidify materialism, vision impaired
With Cadillac's and Nike Airs
When will our reparations come?
When we stand and give the hood a repair
Unless you all think it looks good in despair
Cocaine dominating our people, it don't mesh too well
That reflected the message we gave through record sales
I'm here to tip the scale
In favor to our labor
Don't blame it on your neighbor
We blame it on the mayor
We don't got a Fred Douglas on the cover of Jet
We got 50 on the cover of Jet
B.E.T. wanna see us prosper though (How?)
That's probably why they air Uncut
Right before a damn gospel show
Man I gots to know
When it's all gon' change
Fuck that, maybe I'm just the same
My personalities change
"Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis"

[Verse Three]:
Look dawg I will shoot 'em up
Gun 'em down, fuck 'em up
Put you in the whip, nigga buckle up
Fuck 'em dunn
If it ain't Gucci I don't rock it
If it ain't new I don't cop it
And if it ain't the crew I don't knock it
Wide in the cockpit
Go through the projects
Where cats is more smooshed than a mosh pit
If I got it on me, I'mma cock it
No homo, go dolo
Do you like Tony did Manolo
Cause my flow's so
Smooth
I just groove through a promo
And hoes know, if they don't go low
I'm saying, "No no."
To the nana
Dolce Gabbana
It's useless to me
Material things seem stupid to me
Look
This is a wake up call
I gotta wake up y'all
I spit heat that's hot enough to cook a steak up on
Grimey street, pretty boy, straight up conscious
Split personalities, I guess I'm Complex
"Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis"
