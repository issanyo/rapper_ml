[Verse 1: XV]
Wanna touch a million dollars, does it feel priceless?
Check the pulse of all the music, does it feel lifeless?
Thanks Pharrell for this shining brightness, we need it like this
Errything that boy touch is gold, he the real Midas
Some people quote the Bible, just to feel righteous
Some people quote my music, just to feel like it
I saw myself in the mirror today and recognized it
Less over thinking and more doing, I think I'll try it
Took a year off it but never in the darkness
My son was coming up, I took the time to see the process
The Dub gettin' dubs, ain't the year for losses
I'm happy to be honest, but that's just me being modest
I hear do you still you got it and are you still rapping?
Never do they ask me if I'm happy
Bring the hook in
I hear do you still you got it?
And are you still rapping?
But never do they ask you, I said never do they ask you...

[Hook: Pharrell]
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
