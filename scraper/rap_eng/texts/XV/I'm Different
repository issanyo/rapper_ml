[Verse One] [Bizniz Kid]:
Some of you rappers act like you don't know what rhyming is
Copy cats a lot of these niggas are really Simon Says
Guy like me?
Come up with all kind of shit
That's what happen when you mix music with marijuana bitch
And we zoning
In the studio from the night til the morning
When you on your grind they say, they say that they, can't stand you
Cause we in the lab making some tracks they can't do
And if you're grinding slow, you need to pick it up
You got a boring flow? You gotta switch it up
They love me dawg, cause every track I'm different brah
I'm laughing at these lames they didn't even listen for
And you can tell them 'bout me, yeah they know the truth
When you go hard, yep yep they notice you
Yeah they notice who, who?
Me
And that's just how it's gon' be

[Hook] [Bizniz Kid]:
Have you seen a guy like me?
Nope
The fact that I'm different what makes me dope
And everybody said they love my flow
Now you can hear it through your stereo
Have you seen a guy like me?
Nope
The fact that I'm different what makes me dope
And everybody said they love my flow
Now you can hear it through your stereo

[Verse Two] [XV]:
They say that boy from Kansas City so fly
No wonder they wave hi every time I roll by
In a world full of hella haters and jealous neighbors
I walked on the Dark Side Of The Moon bumping Pink Floyd and wearing Vaders
While growing up I had dreams of going up
Like Vizzy Lifting Drink Sodas, Willy Wonka elevators
About my business like listed up in the Yellow Pages
It's the beginning you can tell it's beta
Ain't no omega, but that's my queue
They hurt the game, turn this whole thang black and blue
These niggas is pawns, so tell me why they acting new
Get some brain, act a fool
Get a chain, pack a tool
Tell me, is that rap to you?
They call up Vizzy like, "Please rocket pack us dude."
The ground's so sound and the clouds so out of view
I got the keys and degrees for the altitude
Fly Boy Club they like, "Vizzy can we count on you?"
Well of course

[Hook] [Bizniz Kid]:
Have you seen a guy like me?
Nope
The fact that I'm different what makes me dope
And everybody said they love my flow
Now you can hear it through your stereo
Have you seen a guy like me?
Nope
The fact that I'm different what makes me dope
And everybody said they love my flow
Now you can hear it through your stereo
