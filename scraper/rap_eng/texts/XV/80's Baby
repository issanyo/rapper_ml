[Intro] [XV talking]:
Alright, you know, nowadays everybody be talking about being an 80s baby. But nobody really understands what an 80s baby is. You know, what it represents. What we were born into. You see, I feel like I represent the 80s without wearing the big dookie rope gold chains, you know? I'ma show y'all how. Take y'all back with me if y'all don't mind

[Verse One]:
Look
80's baby
Millennium teen
Yo MTV Raps on the TV screen
My nigga Kareem was like Radio Raheem
Blast his boom box on Do The Right Thing
Logos in our hair, I had the swoosh from Nike
Had a crush on Salt-N-Pepa, I was only like 3
Couldn't afford a Gameboy, my momma got me Linx
And I played Space Invaders till the screen went green
Grew up on Arlene, my crew was called the Aces
We had the sickest cycles and we killed rivals and racists
I had a hoop so we balled all night
I couldn't shoot, I had a shot like Bill Cartwright
But that wasn't important
Had a box of jersey's and everybody fight over who gets to be Jordan
Had a crush on Chili after CrazySexyCool
And that Red Light Special had me digging on you, yeah
80's baby
Millennium teen
Chicago Bulls was everybody's favorite team
Getting a Super Nintendo was a thing in your dreams
I was the first one on the block with it, felt like a king
Ha, fitting right?
Momma had trouble with bills, but you 12, you don't know what living's like
Living life?
I was fine trying to chill
In an open field filled with grass with a kite
Trying to catch lightening bugs in the night
Argue with your best friend and it ends in a fight
The next day, everything's alright
They knocking at your door saying, "Wanna ride bikes?"
Haha
Damn I miss them times
And I miss them rhymes
It all changed though in '99
You know we all grew up
