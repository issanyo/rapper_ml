[Hook]
It feels like I’m running on walls and I don’t wanna touch the ground
And if they say that I’m lost, then I don’t wanna be found
It feels like I’m running on walls and I don’t wanna touch the ground
And if they say that I’m lost, then I don’t wanna be found
I’m on the mirror’s edge

[Verse 1: XV]
Look, my life is unbelievable even though sometimes I wanna leave and go
And find a job, I’m so odd, still I got an even flow
Quiet kid, keep it low, mouth is closed, wanna scream his soul
Till I’m in the place where the reapers go, I’m running on walls and leaping poles
My eyes are closed and all I know is I just don’t ever-ever-ever wanna ever fall down
Never-never-never will I touch that ground
I feel so high when girls say hi and I can’t hear ‘em all
The crowd is loud, the flash is massive balling all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
I was living like the rest of ‘em, shit, I didn’t even mess with ‘em
They all came part of the roster, I came in a flying saucer
Them dudes be like who is he? Them girls be like that’s Vizzy
My line is always open but I still get so busy, now dig me
Sometimes I ask how I have got in here
Life wasn’t always sunny but I found time to shear, yeah
Even though this height is lovely, I know gravity got a crush on me
But until that time I’ll be fine ‘cause…

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Looking out the window at another city's lights
Trying to make it home on another lonely flight
Because I'm running-running trying to find my way
But there's nothing-nothing-nothing I can say to find you on these days

[Hook 2: XV & Mike Posner]
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch to the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
I'm on the mirror’s edge, I’m on the mirror’s edge
I'm on the mirror’s edge, I'm on the mirror’s edge
