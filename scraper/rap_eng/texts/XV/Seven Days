[Hook]:
When God made you
He had a lot to do
When God made you
He had a lot to do

[Verse One]:
The magnetism that I get when I look in your eyes
I see the good Lord must have took out some time
Seven days to be precise, He nicely took out a week
And likeness of Himself, but somehow he got a freak
Named you on the second day
Parted you from the sea
You float above the water, you fly as ever can be
The chemistry we see from the moon and the stars
I be
So close to you but far
From close
He made some verses, sing you a song
They whistle as the tree leaves bristle along
Walk around naked, Spanks will make you put on a thong
But I want you pure, back then you felt it was wrong
Let's be fruitful too boo and let me lie in you
He divided light from dark but I can multiply with you
They say He did very good, I say that He did great
Usually it takes nine months but for you it was seven...days

[Hook]:
When God made you
He had a lot to do
When God made you
He had a lot to do
