      [Hook]
We up in the hotel so it’s going down boo
And I gotta bounce to but you want a round 2
So I turn the lights back off and we’re right back on
And I forgot I gotta fly back home ’cause now I’m saying
Where I’d put my passport? Where I’d put my passport?
Where I’d put my passport? Where I’d put my passport?
Where I’d put my passport? Where I’d put my passport?

[Verse 1: XV]
You climb on my cockpit, you at the front of my plane
I watch your clothes take off as soon as I open the lane
We in Nirvana, in the sauna, treat me like Kurt Cobain
And I’m in love like Courtney when you blow out my brains
Sex pistol, watch me load up and aim
I watch you cock that thing back and I just hope that it bang
The way I bite, I bet you like, have you growing your fangs
And now I can’t get home and you are only to blame

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
My number on that hotel P card, it was Spring B-R-E-A-K
In D.R where we are, I go up, she go down, I go down, she go up
See-saw, reverse cowgirl like yee-haw, gone and take my tee off
Take your tee off and I hit it like I teed off
In your thighs, I give you Chinese eyes then I knock your chi off
You know I gotta be off ‘cause my plane leave soon
And now a nigga can’t leave the room ‘cause…

[Hook 2X]

[Outro]
We up in the hotel so it’s going down boo
And I gotta bounce to where you went around to
So I turn the lights back off and we’re right back on
And I forgot I gotta fly back home
