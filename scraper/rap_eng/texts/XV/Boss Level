[Intro]
Yeah, this shit sound like video game music
Like the Boss Level
Well, that's where we should take it
Haha, yeah!

Boss Level, Boss Level, Boss Level

[Bridge]
Yeah, It's that King Bowser flow

[Verse 1: XV]
Uh, creeping up on that boss level, tell me what that cost for you?
Jewelry all made in China, no wonder them diamonds is all yellow
I be out in NY hitting that lala like I'm Carmelo
You know they trying to lock the rappers, don't fuck around and let the dogs smell you
Used to ball like EA, now I'm on that 2K
Thirsty bitches like "Who they?", that's fly boy club, baby hooray
And all my niggas get foolay, talking shit to me, you could get souffled
So just kick back like Liu Kang before a nigga pop at your toupee
And I don't ever fuck with the two-face, you can leave that up to Bruce Wayne
Run this town, and I run this block, and I run this street, give me two lanes
Come alive at night, give me two fangs, ray bans, entree, and a few chains
And I'm sorry girl, I done had a few drinks, Man, I couldn't tell you who came
See, I used to wanna rub the stump on Apollo, now I'm bout to run the fuckin' Apollo
I don't even mean that joint up in Harlem, I'm talking about space shuttles up in the cosmos
Where we at? Someone better call and tell 'em

[Hook]
Boss Level, Boss Level, Boss Level x2
Creepin' up on that Boss Level, Boss Level, Boss Level x2

[Bridge]
Yeah, Bowser flow
Sephiroth swag
Haha, we came too far to turn around now

[Verse 2: XV]
Got more checks than I got more numbers
Got more bread then I got more wonder
Broads in my hand model chicks like summer
And are high maintenance like top floor plumbers
And I keep mad rubbers
AMEX card yea I keep that from her
Cause all in all they know I ball and so they call just to see that jumper
One night stand at the United Center
Then I got to stop at the TD bank
Cause I turned to mall in the Madison Square
This flow right here don't see no breaks
Running back throw, ? in flows, he's wanted at shows
I'm fucking mad hoes, you give me that pussy like Thudercat hoes, oh!
I shoot for the moon like witches on brooms
Niggas is wondering when Vizzy gon' boom
I tell you the key now nigga stay tuned
Why is you gassed? Niggas is fumes
Look at yo ass, you niggas is doomed
See this is trash, I pick up a broom
I'm up in the room with bitches on shrooms
LA mornings and Vegas nights
Toga parties, the Pagan life
All I know is this ain't just Sprite
But she said, "Drink. It'll change your life."
Now I'm...wondering where we are, tell 'em

[Hook]
