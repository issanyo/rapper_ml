[Verse One]:
I'm standing mighty high like a rising escalator
They swore it was a hoax when they saw me in the paper
Smiling to haters, middle finger waved up
Birthday party caked up, none of this is made up
Gonna ride to the top in Willy Wonka's elevator
Where we ain't only pressing up
This is full court pressure and I bet ya we ain't letting up
Hit a slot machine if you wanna press your luck
I pull up
On any cat like a cab
Take all that he has then pull off like a scab
Yeah, and you better make it fast
Have Keith Sweat-ing bullets if I'm gon' make it last
I leave very little
It's done so well that I'll get you well done
No pink in the middle
Turn around and say, "Gee, I'm in a pickle."
Throw a rock in the water, see the whole sea ripple nigga

[Hook]:
Go hard or go home
I'm shooting for the top
I'm aiming for the throne
And I ain't gonna stop till I get what I want
So make that beat knock cause I'm getting in my zone
They say, "X"
Go hard or go home
I'm shooting for the top
I'm aiming for the throne
And I ain't gonna stop till I get what I want
So make that beat knock cause I'm getting in my zone
They say, "X"

[Verse Two]:
Complex
I am who I am in my records
Niggas call me 'Zeus' how I breeze through the weather
I ain't never ask for favors nigga, I got mine
On my own, I ain't trying to earn the throne through a dude's paper
Pick up the newspaper
May 10th, '03
They say the city gon' shine cause of little ole' me
That brought the haters to my feet in the next week
Three years later, that's when Complex leaked
You finally get the chance to hear X speak
About the streets and the life that effects me
Open up the door, you got mail
If I do not sell, I'll drink five Molotov cocktails
I rock well now I feel somebody watching me
I yield to the real but ain't nobody stopping me
This ain't checkers this is Jenga
If you topping me, we can all fall down
Round of Monopoly

[Hook]:
Go hard or go home
I'm shooting for the top
I'm aiming for the throne
And I ain't gonna stop till I get what I want
So make that beat knock cause I'm getting in my zone
They say, "X"
Go hard or go home
I'm shooting for the top
I'm aiming for the throne
And I ain't gonna stop till I get what I want
So make that beat knock cause I'm getting in my zone
They say, "X"

[Verse Three]:
This is that Royalty City shit, excuse me for cussing
This verse feels Slavic, excuse me for Russian/rushing
Hahaha, check my play on words
Beat always think I cheat cause I played on words
Hip hop may be dead and rap might have killed it
I was written in the will though to come back and rebuild it
Paraplegics feel it, down to their toes and
I'mma shed the realness, down on my foes
Now they know why them hoes say my name 'round 'em
Come to the Dub, hear the words that's exchanged 'bout him
The best thing that happen to Wichita is a three album
Two letter, 21 year old who don't lose battles
Who don't scrap, got gats that'll spew at 'em
Blood clots ooze out 'em, nothing you can do 'bout 'em
I got a 40 cal now
With straight bullets, if I pull it, it'll knock 40 cows down
Nigga now

[Hook]:
Go hard or go home
I'm shooting for the top
I'm aiming for the throne
And I ain't gonna stop till I get what I want
So make that beat knock cause I'm getting in my zone
They say, "X"
Go hard or go home
I'm shooting for the top
I'm aiming for the throne
And I ain't gonna stop till I get what I want
So make that beat knock cause I'm getting in my zone
They say, "X"
