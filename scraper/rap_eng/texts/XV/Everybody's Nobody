[Verse 1: XV]
Day to day I stay awake, writing just to please the crowd
Yelling through a megaphone that doesn't make a sound
The homies say enjoy the ride, take your time, be proud
‘Cause once you make it to the top, the only place to go is down
I see my life in versions from the person in the stands
So when I’m higher than the ceiling, I’m still down wit my fans
Home is where the heart is so I never have to search
But now that everybody’s fly, nobody’s down to earth
And everybody twitters and everybody blogs
But nobody saying shit, they just copy-paste it all
That’s how one person’s opinion becomes everybody’s thoughts
When the blind leads the blind then everyone gets lost
Rappers think they the big cheese, ain’t even made a single
That’s why when I go out, I don’t ever stay to mingle
And that’s just rule of thumb and I got four more fingers
But I just need one to tell these divas what I’m thinking
I tell you what my name is, but that don’t really matter
All that really matters is that I’m one dope ass rapper
And if you enjoy my chatter, then listen to these songs
And I'mma keep it short so ya'll can sing along

[Hook]
Everybody’s nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
You can go far away and you can go far away
Everybody’s nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
You can go far away and you can go far away

[Verse 2: XV]
It's funny when a girl starts to want me
Simultaneously when I end up in a magazine
She probably tells a friend about how she know me
All the suddenly she on me then I hear the phone ring
Bitches jump on a reality show to be a star
Kissing a dude they wouldn't talk to at a bar
And the public fall victim to the ratings
What am I saying? I got a few of ‘em on DVR
I think the world just got crazy more
I’m trying to figure out what Paris Hilton’s famous for
I know that MTV felt bad for what they did to Britney Spears
So they had the VMA's and gave her every award
DJ Booth nominated that’s a great look
Lost to a song with Lil' Wayne that ain't have a hook
It's all good, it just overthrows my message
We always throwing money and then came a recession
I tell you what my name is but that don’t really matter
All that really matters is that I’m one dope ass rapper
And if you enjoy my chatter, then listen to these songs
And I'mma keep it short so ya'll can sing along

[Hook 2x]
