[Sample of Billy Joel's song "Moving Out"]:
"That's what you have in mind
Then that's what you're all about
Good luck moving up cause I'm moving out"

[Chorus]:
Three flights of stairs
Two escalators
One elevator
I'm coming up
Yeah, I'm coming up
Yeah, I'm coming up
Yeah, I'm coming up
Yeah, I'm coming up
Three flights of stairs
Two escalators
One elevator
We coming up
Yeah, we coming up
Yeah, we coming up
Yeah, we coming up
Yeah, we coming up

[Verse]:
Fresh off the phone
Special delivery
Fresh to the bone
Best flow delivery
Next to "the now" for a while I was finna be
Done with the game till I hopped off the train
And jogged my memory
Hey
Remember me?
Cool like a winter in December G
And I breeze through
Plenty of obstacles
And once I ease through
I found a pot of gold
Of course the haters said I wasn't real
So I'm back in effect like LucasFilm on the set
Who is them?
Oh, you don't the set?
Bling and Sez Batters
Them boys is next
Yep, in Willy Wonkas elevator where we ain't only pressing up
This is full court pressure
And if you heard this line before
Then that means we ain't catching up
We coming up, look

[Chorus]:
Three flights of stairs
Two escalators
One elevator
I'm coming up
Yeah, I'm coming up
Yeah, I'm coming up
Yeah, I'm coming up
Yeah, I'm coming up
Three flights of stairs
Two escalators
One elevator
We coming up
Yeah, we coming up
Yeah, we coming up
Yeah, we coming up
Yeah, we coming up
