[Verse 1: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Feeling better than competing for a wager
Broadway bow, Grey blazer
Homie think that he a player but he couldn't get the ends if he paid her
But that's on the other hand
We some fly little nuckas
Once I feel your body ain't even trying to cuff ya
Coolin'
Quit acting shy like summers
It's a live night, spend it with some live life hustlers
The flippers over there they love to hate
But we don't even give them the time of day
The whole team got bottles of bubbly
So what the fuck we look like with another case?
They'll never get to this point I know what it's like
So go on player
I'll hit you up when I need advice
On not successing at life, or looking mean at me where there's a bunch of divas. Yo go grab a girl and beat it iight?

[Hook: Dyme-A-Duzin]
It's about time
I've waited too long, from the bottom I've climbed
In the mirror I see
Everlasting life
Boy I got to be right
To feel like I'm what's up
I live without fear
Let your gift shine cause it's yours not theirs
In the mirror I see
Boy I got to be right
To feel like I'm what's up

[Verse 2: XV]
Yeah, this feeling here feel like a million years
Life stole some friends, I am still in tears
But I found myself, rather than drown myself
Inside this Hennessy bottle that I can't down myself
So I send shots to my niggas like I'm missing them
Throw some dimes at 'em like a well that's what I'm wishing them
Had a homie who told me that the future don't mean shit to him
He said being in the present was such a gift to him
As kids we run tired, fascinated by gunfire
Praying that we make it home safe, we had no umpire
So we conspire to live long as our legends
Labels put their offering like a reverend
Hit a home run and pass the plate like collections
Isn't it ironic you inhale every moment it feel like Heaven
Damn, look at that for a second
Ironic if you inhale every moment it feel like Heaven
Wow

[Verse 3: Denzil Porter]
Still at the post where I was posted as a kid/ posted up pouring poison for my boys who used to live/ they said im suppossed to be posted on posters im supposed to do it big/ so im sticking to the mission like a post it on a fridge/
What you doing it for?
That's what you do when you poor
Anytime things get shaky, drinks will balance the floor
In the club going ape with these women and broads
Curiosity killed the cat it ain't kill Curious George
What you curious for?
Can't you see that I'm on it?
Hungry and ready to rumble can't you see I'mma stomach
And I can't handle my liquor, can't you see I'mma vomit?
If I can't handle my niggas better start running and running
They coming for something
Not fronting or nothing
I be in ?, we be the fliest
You could be what's up, but we the highest
We in the building like staircases and elevators
With hella haters that elevate us to better places
