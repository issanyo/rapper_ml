[Verse 1]
I'm sorry mama, I gotta be on my way
And can't just say the exact day I'm gonna be coming back home
Sometimes it's funny when people have all this money
They don't need a thing but they always seem to be wanna left alone (Get it? Alone? Haha)

Open the door, let's explore, not the world but the coolniverse
With all the pretty girls that I'll never get to meet
She said "I'll keep your room the same"
I said that I'll never change
Then I packed up all my things
Now I'm headed out to sea

[Hook]
So get used to
3 by 5's and postcards
3 by 5's and postcards
3 by 5's and postcards
Because I'm going away

So get used to
3 by 5's and postcards
3 by 5's and postcards
3 by 5's and postcards
I think I'll send one today

[Verse 2]
Now I'm flying through the space vapors on a plane made of paper
Mama said my imagination would get me far
So dealing with the inner circle of haters
I took a nap on the el-el-elevator and now I'm heading towards the stars

I never ever imagined that all of this would have happened
With me rapping so I'm sorry for being gone for so long
I thought that all the bullshit would just stop
If my music would just pop
And I make it to the top
Well I guess I was wrong

[Hook x2]
