[Verse 1]
I don't need time, I'm down for a quickie with her
Throw a peace sign, leave her like a hippie sticker
As I recline, sipping on this liquor with her
Smoking something high as the socks on a hipster nigga
I got and drop dimes like Sprint on niggas
Your camera phone's on but I look at the bigger picture
My life’s a movie, you casted for your role
Get your ass up out that robe and don’t ask where this gon’ go
I tell her

[Hook: XV (Miguel)]
(I don’t wanna be loved, I don’t wanna be loved, I don’t wanna be loved)
I just want a preview
Keep your thong on, and them heels on your feet too
If you can get with that, baby I need you
(I don’t wanna be loved, I don’t wanna be loved)
Just coming attractions, put on your napkin
Lights, camera, action
I got your body coming and you’re so attractive

[Verse 2]
Don’t show me everything, not even a nipple
She said I can get a taste, I just wanna nibble
Need an inhaler, this is the trailer to a porno
My hands is all over, I swear she thinking I’m Goro
You try out every outfit and every position too
Let me smash in every room like a demolition crew
Let me tell you what I want, let me tell you what I’ll do
My hand around your throat, pulling the freak out of you
And she was like

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ever since I met you press my shirt to impress you
And it was loco, the way that I go postal to address you
I mean, look how long it took for me to get you
I mean, tell me how the fuck could I forget you
When everybody stare at your all red hair
And I love how you look when you smoke like flares
I believe you after love but I swear you ain’t Cher
‘Cuz your girl wanted to join but you said you won’t share
She said, “Boy you a square, but I love to be around it”
I be in the air but distances never cloudy
It’s on when you land, I don’t care how that sounded
So we stayed in the room all day like we were grounded
Shooting for the moon like evil witches on brooms
In the shower getting the groom and telling ‘em give me room
Like restroom, leg room, head room
Sex in every single room except for the bedroom damn

[Hook: Miguel]
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just wanna quickie
No bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies
If you can get with that, mami come get with me
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just wanna quick fix up in your mix miss
Send me you wishlist, I have you addicted
So mami come hit this
