[Intro] [XV Talking]:
You see, people say I got that-that straight jacket flow, you know? (Why's that?) Cause they say my flow is so crazy, niggas feel the need to straight jack it. So I change it up on 'em

[Verse]:
Any beat I hop on, I'mma ribbit, I mean rip it
Flow like periods, send your sense and I'mma wear it
If I fit it and
Any song I get on they gon' spite it
I mean spit it
Like my lisp is bad, suffering suckatash, cats can't with it
Yeah I said it cause I meant it
And they knowing the deal
And I ain't never been fishing but I'll throw you the reel
And I'm the king, kiss the ring and you know you should kneel
Armstrong, I'm gone on the moon I'm that ill
Still we'll run through any pasture with dope kick upon my feet
Still will go through any rapper like a fat kid running to eat
I mean, who would ever think that the square in the circle would set
Fire to mic's/Mikes like a Pepsi commercial
It's like the hare and the turtle, niggas be thinking they winning
Well I was knocking on the door, I guess I'll kick in the hinges
I ain't smiling I'm grinning
Like The Grinch on Christmas
And my flow's so amazing y'all think I should be admitted
