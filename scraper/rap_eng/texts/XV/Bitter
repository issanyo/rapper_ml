[Verse One]:
I can't lie man I'm bitter
Sitting in a room with tears with a river
I came in forgetting I was here to deliver
These thoughts so I write this here like a picture
Looking insecure at myself, "What's wrong with you nigga?
You can't write. Where's the songs little nigga
You thinking you hard, your balls ain't with ya
The city don't like ya. They all is against ya
Can't find yourself, can't rhyme like yourself."
I wanna hang it up but my mind's on the shelf
If I didn't have this flow then what would I be?
Me?
Nah
You got it backwards like hearing 2Pac on the record saying "Suge shot me."
And I would not be
Myself if I changed so why would you think that would ever be arranged
I felt pain, so your words hurt me
Came back fighting like Tyson no mercy
Bite his ear off not trying to hear Hoff
I ain't gon' lie, I still feel like that nigga
But I'm still human so I'm still that bitter
Who wants to hear that they ain't liked
By somebody they ain't met in they whole life
Play this song back and they gon' say I'm right
Next time they throw the bait, I ain't gon' bite

[XV talking]:
And I'm good. I'm good on that one. Let me say a few words though. The whole inspiration behind that freestyle right there...was...from a review. It stems from a review on hiphopdx I got on my album. And it was a pretty bashing review if you go check it out. I mean, it misquoted me. It talked- not only did it bash my music but it bashed me as a person. And I ain't gon' lie I was bitter and hurt at the review. I mean, I felt like they acted like I didn't show emotion in my music so...I figured I'd give them an emotion freestyle. Haha. I mean, I'm all good now. Cause I, I felt like dude was a hater but...critics are critics right Clark Kent? Yeah, I guess the next time they throw the bait I just ain't gon' bite. Right? Haha. The next thing they gon' say is, "That nigga XV laugh too much." Haha
