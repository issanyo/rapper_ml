[Intro]
You right
I am crazy
But you know what else?
I don't give a fuck

[Hook]
There is one thing you might not know
There is one thing you might not know
There is one thing you might not know
I stopped giving a fuck a long time ago

[Verse 1]
I stopped giving a fuck a long time ago
You got me, stop me, ask me what you gotta know
Two fucks is what I wasn't ever tryna show
So how you got me talking 'bout this shit? I don't know
I stand by you, never leaving my throne
I'm staying here, like playing musical chairs in straight silence
Stage divin' all over in every state wylin'
From NY's High Line to Hollywood and Holland
Dying's always here, so time is all i fear
That's the limit on getting out all of my ideas
What you thought of me used to be all I'd ever hear
But now I'm 'bout to blow now, so all I do is plug my ears

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I stopped giving a fuck a long time ago
To the top I'm tryna go, but you can't buy my soul
I don't need your chains and whips, and I don't need your dope
I'm just here to boost these kids up like even flows
Even though I was raised a kid what everybody thinks
Smile for awhile, tell everybody thanks
They told me slow down, tone up, don't act your race
They told be hold up, you grown now, go act your age
That's why I made 15 my motherfuckin' name
So nobody could say I ever fuckin' changed
Cuz' that was the age, now I finally know
That I stopped giving a fuck a long time ago

[Hook]

[Outro]
I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck about myself
Look, I ain't shit
I ain't never gon be shit
And you less of a man than me
So as soon as I figure you ain't gon be shit, *pow*
So be it
