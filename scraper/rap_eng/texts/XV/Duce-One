[Verse]:
You always hear me shouting it out
Now you 'bout to find out
What it all is about
Let me break down the route
I was the ONE that saw it all through my window view
Saw some flashy niggas stunting, said, "I want that too/TWO."
Shane was in his Jeep, THREE cats outside
Came up to me, I stayed G, gave all FOUR of them FIVES
They asked if they could use my go for a couple of ticks
I said, "Sure. My mom don't come home till SIX."
Intermission real quick
Shouts out to SEVEN
This is him on the beat just in case you need reference
EIGHT bars in
The same week I found out what an EIGHT ball is
Stayed in the streets
Got robbed one time didn't have my NINE
I wasn't build for the game, Shane told me TEN times
Had a good connect in Augusta G
Would take the drive just to get it for ELEVEN a key
So please excuse the smell of dirty laundry being aired
Bring me TWELVE bars back I'll start the verse from there

[XV talking]:
Yo, I don't think y'all know what's going on. Play that shit back for 'em. Make sure y'all paying attention

You always hear me shouting it out
Now you 'bout to find out
What it all is about
Let me break down the route

Now if you came here and hit up THIRTEENTH Street
When I was FOURTEEN you see me on the block every week
At FIFTEEN I went from Hoffa to XV
Announce the name to the world on The Legacy
The first time the city heard the boy's hot SIXTEENS
But back then, I tried to sound just like Jay-Z
Swore my last song for Shane was in 2003
Pick up The Answer, I believe it's track SEVENTEEN
EIGHTEEN mixtapes later, I'm known to the public
As The Definition of it, nigga hate it or love it
Wrote NINETEEN songs on the Greyhound buses
Started on Complex cause I know they want it
Since I know they wanted more then what I gave to them
Flows outside of drug dealing and 20 inch rims
Check the block that grew me and the age I was
When I made a classic album, deuce to the one
That's 21 nigga
