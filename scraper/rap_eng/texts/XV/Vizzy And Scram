[Verse]:
They call me V.I. double Z Y
I don't know why, I guess I be so fly
Top down on the Se-bring Chrysler
With a chick jocking to be Mrs. Johnson
I pass her to the team like Stockton
I've been, on the road baby, this is cruise control lady
Meme you can't stop me so move it on baby
I know I'm kind of shady, but that's the way I play see
The definition of a baller, that's where you can place me
In the Webster's Dictionary or thesaurus next to Jay-Z
Trucker low, but fuck it though
Rob is the mic on?
Niggas want beef I gave them Tyson
And I don't mean Bedford or Mike
Step to the mic
And Say My Name like Destiny
These niggas can't mess with me
Forward niggas my recipe
Local beef I don't mess see
I'm barely in the city prick
That's why you don't see me with
My chick and townies
I'm out east with Bling and shit
Saving that Ben cash
Riding in rented Jag's
Is he the man? Serious? I am, Vizzy and Scram
We run the land from L.A. to Japan
Damn
