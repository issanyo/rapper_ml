[Sample]: {X2}
I know you'll say one thing
I know you'll say one thing
And then do something else
And then do something else

[XV Talking]:
Niggas is mad. They like, "You said that was coming out on the 12th. You said it was dropping on the 12th." Hahaha

[Verse One]:
Vizzy's homecoming
Vizzy Zone coming
That was like what? Two weeks ago something?
The Twitters started Tweeting
Blogs started searching
Ill Will, DMing, I do that shit on purpose
Rappers act like rabbits, I refuse to be the tortoise
I'm a turtle in a half shell, kicking it like Norris
Bullheaded, you would think I was a Taurus
The Kid With The Green Backpack is still in storage
Lay your verse, I'm all for it, but let me tell you "one thing"
You need it done tomorrow, I will fail you
I say I'll hold you down then tomorrow I can't help you
I deserve a no window room in Bellevue
Tell boo that I ain't ever gonna leave her
Next thing she know I'm quickly putting on my sneakers
I try to stay away from saying things that I will stand up
Like comedians and even when I have an honest answer somehow...

[Hook]:
I know you'll say one thing (I know I do)
I know you'll say one thing (Ain't trying to)
And then do something else (I'm sorry)
And then do something else (Sorry)
I know you'll say one thing (I know I do)
I know you'll say one thing (Ain't trying to)
And then do something else (Uh huh)
And then do something else (yeah)

[Verse Two]:
I say the album dropping, it ain't even done
I say I'm trying to fuck but I ain't getting none
I'm good at getting girls, bad at keeping one
I say I dick her down and she ain't even cum
What do they even want? They telling me to kill it
When I kill it they conceal it, resurrect it and rebuild it
I'm saying I'm a hero when I'm playing like the villain
I open up my mouth but I never show a feeling
I hit the mall and say I'm only going to buy "one thing"
When I know that I'm not even going to try
Hate on all these rappers that be balling, acting fly
When I blew a check at Strokers throwing money in the sky
I
Tell them chicks that wouldn't give X an chance
But you would never get a second glance
So tell me why I'm turning around
Looking at this girl that used to turn me down
About to ask her for a dance
It's crazy fam
