[Verse 1: XV]

Tell 'em all Wichita is the base
Knock it out the park and bring it all back to home plate
Winner chicken dinner and I'm eating off my own plate
Ambition and [?] I'm mixing up my own drink
Working in dreams going live like the first one on the scene
Ever since I have bursted through the seams of my pops jeans
They never seen the forest for the trees
Buzzin' for these honeys, never saw what they could be/bee
Droppin' Funk Flex rhymes in those lunchroom crowds
Super Mario flow leaving mushrooms clouds like blah
Dropped out and picked up an art
Dodgin' shells stayin' in, playin' Mario Kart
They thought the kid with the green
Was the best meme jokin'
It caught on fire jumped on the next thing smokin'
They shot us out the sky and it left the team broken
Deuce told me, "we just gotta keep pushin' like steamrollin'"

[Hook: XV, Freddy High]

Tell 'em all Wichita is the home base
Knock it out the park, and bring it all back to home plate
Tryna take my spot [?] you in for a long way
Goin' for the top, AstroNots what they gon' say?
I said
Wichita, Kansas is the home state
Knock it out the park, and bring it all back to home plate
This is our year, y'all in for some long days
Comin' for that spot, AstroNots what they gon say?
Now let's take this higher to a new plateau (4x)
Go

[Verse 2: Freddy High]

Wichita, Kansas is my home state
Knock it out the park, and bring it all back to home plate
This is our year, y'all in for some long days
Comin' for that spot, AstroNots what they gon' say?
That's that L7 y'all trailin' niggas the wrong way
This that Freddy and Vizzy you feel me this what they gon' play
10 years that's a long stay
My pops said, "[?] keep spittin' that crack to bring 'em back
And they gon' pay"
A foundation's what you call [?]
And a team that's gon' stay
Hard work is the price that you gon' pay
"Success is much better when you take the long way"
Is what a don say
Kill shit... and know your time tickin'
So when that bomb go, know that they gon' feel shit
I'm on a mission fuck permission
They say this shit is earned and never given
And fuckin'

[Hook]
