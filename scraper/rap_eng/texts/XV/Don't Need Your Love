I'm on my way back home
Ready to hit that zone
? in Seattle doing his album alone
Young Neesh been gone but she hold that throne
Blade wrapping up college, gotta pay back loans
Cream still locked up we ain't talked on the phone
If you hear this locked down please play that phone
Let them know I'm getting paper and my mind ain't change
I'm still deuce one nigga and my grind is the same
Remember them young niggas? yeah, they lied to me, man
They weren't on the same side with me, man (nope)
But I moved up larger and the crew's more stronger now
Niggas know the name and my range a lot longer
I'm out in Ohio doing shows with Ice
Sending postcards like if you were here tonight
Ice told me the realest shit I'd imagine you'd say
It ain't how much you did, shawty, it's how much you can take

I don't need your love. I don't want it. I don't need it
I don't need your love 'cause the game don't change
