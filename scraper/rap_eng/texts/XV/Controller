(Verse 1)
I rented a new game today
Wanted to see if you wanted to come over and play
Normally don't be around my way
But, if you havin' it bad you know where I stay
But, it's a first person shooter and I know your style
And I ain't seen you on Live in awhile
I still got that Mario you let me borrow though
Well I need my Donkey Kong Country back like now
And my Sega broke down so I can't play Sonic
Been kind of lonely in my house to be honest
I had a copy of linens that I can't find
And I play Mass Effect like five damn times
So, if you wanna get on Halo 3
Call me back you know where I`ll be
Wear those Miss Pac-man shorts that I like
Hope that I`ll see you tonight

(Hook)
Will you come over?
And bring your controller
We'll chill on the sofa
And maybe get closer
But baby come over
And bring your controller
We'll chill on the sofa
And maybe get closer
But baby come over

(Verse 2)
If we wake up next to each other tomorrow
And you steal my heart like Grand Theft Auto
My Golden Knight game, I never let you play
You know what I might let you borrow
Just the sight of you will make a brother press pause on Street Fighter 2
We interlink like a PSP before we go do our laundry at two
We never crash like Bandicoot
Except when you get mad when you get your ass handed to you
And I swear that you is the next best thing
With how busy I get on wrestling
See I never wanna turn you off
And I never wanna put you down
And I would never ever trade you in
You're like my favorite video game, like damn!

(Hook)

(Bridge)
I got the soda, yup, I got the sofa, bap, bring your controller
And maybe something to crash in, yeah
I got the soda, yup, I got the sofa, just, bring your controller
Will you be my girlfriend?
I got the soda, yup, I got the sofa, just, bring your controller
And put your game face on you know it's sexy
I got the soda, yup, I got the sofa, just, bring your controller
And let me play with youuuu

(Hook)

(XV Talking)

(Bridge with ad-libs)
Would you kiss me if I do the Scorpion Finisher right?
I told you I could, and I would
