[Blue Foundation]
I won’t soothe your pain
I won’t ease your strain
I got nothing for you
I got nothing for you
I got nothing for you to gain

[Verse One]
Look
The street's talkin' and often I gave the conversation
Cause in this game you can fly a deal with complications
All I wanted was gold chains and whips but even that I couldn't get like Emancipation and Proclamation
From my bedroom window makin' observations
Watchin' niggas who turn they corner into they occupation
Soon as I had thoughts of joining the operation
That's right when the streets started sayin'

[Hook]
"I won’t soothe your pain
I won’t ease your strain
I got nothing for you"
You know I got nothin' for you
You, you know I got nothin' for you
You, you know I got nothin' for you
But we want it anyways cause we got nothin' to lose

[Verse Two]
But who cares when you stay gettin' new pairs
Of white and baby blue Airs, you stunt around your crew wearing
Got girls who never used to notice you staring
Hung at Mom and Pop shops cause we ain't have two parents
School to some dudes was just a dumb bell
Young, well niggas movin' weight like dumbbells
We'd be compelled to run sells like no one cares
Cause our wishes and our prayers be goin' straight to the voice-mail
Since a kid I knew I would do it big
Bumpin' Sky's The Limit thinkin' I'mma do it B.I.G
Shit, in 7th grade, I was doin' trig
Hangin' with my nigs who do nothin' but pulling trigs
Started smokin' cigs and cigs led to the weed
And weed led to the drank and drank led to the E
Pills, I started poppin' to stop from goin' insane
While I'm holdin' up this flame I'm hearin' it say

[Hook]

[Bridge]
One time for the momma on the grind
Two times for the nigga on his job
Three times for the kid with a dream
One day he gon' make it to the top

[Verse Three]
Throwin' it in the air, like I don't care, I ain't trippin'
Dollars got me ass grabbin' but I swear I'm penny pinching
I know it's a given I'm givin' because I'm sippin'
For that money she get low so she can get her titties lifted
Shawty's name was Diamond, we was never not together
Unless she was in the air like Roc-A-Fella
She let me beat it, when I wouldn't she went accapella
Even though I know she was only after my mozzarella
Mess up relationships and jobs that would make her sick
Knowin' millions take a bit, to get, wasn't makin' sense
She know them dollars I throw ain't gon' make her rich
Or happy, but it makes her wish

[Hook]
