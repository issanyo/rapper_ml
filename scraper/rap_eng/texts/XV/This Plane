[Verse One]:
I be hating when all my niggas afraid to fly and I fear to tell 'em
Can't get in this ride unless you tap in your cerebellum
Chicks are my only vice and I ain't talking Sarah Palin
So I be in the sky, waving hi like I'm para sailing
Hate on me like Christ you better be prepared to nail him
That cross is hard to bear, so my necklace, don't never wear 'em
The rap game, I'm doing very well in
Yelling, I be up in Porsches like my name was Ellen
No fairy telling, I'm selling
Dreams to a user share stream
Till these flairs seen, helicopter in that square ring
Make success breed, the same life that air bring
Niggas dropping garbage I can hardly keep my ears clean
Window seat but up this high I can't hear a thing
Windows to my soul even cloudy from the weed breath
Orchestrating the money, we call it string cheese
So I give my girl whatever she needs
Please don't mistake this for balling
I often, praise material things I can't bring into my coffin
Got niggas locked up doing bids like auctions
So I just want to hear people talking
I'm here/hear for it
On the go like I O'Hare airported
No luggage, do you know where my green Jansport is?
These niggas is balling backwards like Grant Horace
I'm in sky, call me Square Jordan
Yet, I'm the X-Man, your ex-man get's teleported
To the next land, no Freshman can take these courses
I'm a big star, expand orbit
She said, "Look what I can do."
I told her, "Save the next dance for it."
In the fall hours I would show my star power like Guitar Hero
When I stroll in the spot with Rosario
And a model chick, all Creole
And an Auzzie ho, that's my palm tree yo
A nigga ill, but I feel super awesome though
You racing for some honeys, get your Barkley on
I'm racing for the money, get my Ricky Bobby on
You fuck around and gon' get your car repoed
So, Vizzy is the name, windy with the game
Get in any lane, with a pretty dame
Chiddy Chiddy Bang
Props they give me, wallet empty
Not a penny to my name
And they just keep on missing Vizzy's plane

[Hook]:
Don't know what they hatin for, I'm just getting my paper
Well maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave but I need to
It's such a shame (shame)
They gon' miss this plane (plane)
They gon' miss this plane (plane)
They gon' miss this plane (plane)
They gon' miss this Plane (plane)
I tried to believe you, I don't wanna leave but I need to
