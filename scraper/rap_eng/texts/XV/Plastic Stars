[Verse 1]
One day I'll leave my life on Mars
And reach for the plastic stars
Drive a lavish car, and eat caviar
And walk boulevards with a crappy dog
Imagine y'all, the square finally gets in the circle
Guess it just takes time
Like trying to describe to a man that is blind
What it's like to see purple
All the rappers say they ahead
So I guess I'm the turtle
Plastic stars on my wall about as hard as I try
Coming close to touching the sky, no lie
Now the only thing for certain in life is that we die
But my momma said, "Boy, you know that you could fly
And you don't got time to wait for stars to align
You gotta get on your grind, and see what you can find"
So I left what I liked to pursue what I love
The square in the air joined the fly boy club

[Hook]
We all want plastic stars, the biggest house and fastest cars
American Express and Mastercard, a bunch of friends and the baddest broads
See we all want plastic stars
The biggest house and fastest cars
American Express and Mastercard
A bunch of friends and the baddest broads
Plastic Stars
Plastic Stars
Plastic Stars
Plastic Stars
Plastic Stars
Plastic Stars
Plastic Stars
Plastic Stars
Plastic Stars

[Verse 2]
We reach for the plastic stars
We read the blogs about plastic stars
Pray for their downfall until they're all past or gone
Divorced and sad that the magic's gone
We mad they rich but happiness has been gone so long
That they only crack a smile when the camera's on
Your manager is your mom and sometimes you think
That a dream's a lot better when it's just a dream
No need to adjust your screen to get the picture
When people lose they frame, just to get a picture
But when you lose that fame, it all goes with ya
Gold diggers tie the knot, just to lynch ya
Nose in the air but ain't never seen the sky
G4 jets but you never seem to fly
Until the day that they don't know your name and think you died
Your life flashes before your eyes, and now you see...

[Hook]
