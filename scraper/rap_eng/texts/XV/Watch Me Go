They say "Vizzy we just wanna so you go in
Just go in!”
Well
Now watch me go
I Will, Thank you

[Verse 1]
On your mark, get ready, set
Always right I never left
Exhales, exiting hell, thank God for every breath
Shaking the devil wearing a cherry dress
Staying sincere as Nas on his belly shit

(Yes, now watch me go)
Can we get higher, probably, it’s not a thing
Nigga’s still talking ’bout dollars, Obama just wanted change
Decided you want that fire that go straight to your vein
Or do you want that Waka Flocka Flame?

(Now watch me go)
No one dissin’, I’m fine with co-existing
My lines is so intensive, my grind’s like toting pistons
From outta these bars, I shine like Sonny Liston
Now are you listening? Good

(Then Watch me go)
I’m so a Christian, but niggas at home is dissin’
Feeling drunk off of power, I’m bringing back prohibition
Niggas is loading pistols, to bring it to where I’m living
I promised y’all I would win it

(Now watch me go)
Showing it off, knowing I’m raw, oh my voice throwin’ you off?
Well how about I shout it from the same cliff I’m throwin you off?
Ahh, you on my balls, you should hold em, I’ll cough

(Now watch me go)
Still a D list, but at least on the list
Of emcee’s you cannot compete with, got a buzz
Now all a sudden, these honey’s that I could never be with
All hopping on XV dick

(Now watch me go)
You get shelved while movers is moving dressers
To my new house, where my old one? psh, I gave them my successor
And them girls wanna come through so I’m deciding who’s better
Cause they hard to deal with like playing cards glued together
(Watch me go)
With the flow and it’s always getting better
Call me Guinness book murderer, I’m killing every record
Ya’ll got half-assed class, you just a semester,
Spend yo' whole day chasing birds, call yo ass Sylvester

(Watch me go)
The elephant in the room gave me thick skin
Horton heard a "Who," and the labels just pitched in
Who woulda thought, that the way that I clinch pens
Would have me falling in love with the green with a Grinch grin

(Now watch me go)
‘O11 dropping blow up records
Tour bussin’ with bars he's moving
Smoking with J. Crow and captain
Had so many L’s thought we was going 0-11
Now I gotta do a show in a second

(Hold up, now watch me go)
Reaching the final level, my body glow
First it was my hands, then it was my soul
A lot of people loved it, but those that don’t know how a Kansas boy flow

(oh, watch me go)
Yeh, yeh, watch me go
Now watch me go!
