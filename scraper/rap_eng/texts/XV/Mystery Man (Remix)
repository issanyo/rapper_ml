[Verse One] [Jupiter One]:
Pieces of a tree
Carried out to sea
Is tucked under my arm
?
Woke up in a daze
Followed by a blaze
Golden afternoon
Picked up my spoon
Put it to my lips
Chewed like a blaze
Cuts through my cheek
?

[Hook] [Jupiter One]:
A little bit closer
Try a bit deeper
Look under the sink
Cause there I am
Filled with plaster
The same fucking bastard
Mystery man

[Verse Two] [Jupiter One]:
So can we guess my color?
More fairest than others
That old golden hue
Could you guess blue?
Cool like sheets of sand
Wrinkled like my hand
You found it in the sky
Watching us when we die

[Hook] [Jupiter One]:
A little bit closer
Try a bit deeper
Look under the sink
Cause there I am
Filled with plaster
The same fucking bastard
Mystery man

[Verse Three] [Jupiter One]:
Why the gloomy face?
Was it a disgrace?
Cause I was only joking
Your debts they all were fake
Consider them repaid
Ohh la la now
Your stories are sold
They can be untold
I solved

[XV]:
Who am I? I am who
Up in Whoville
Living on a snowflake, you know they swallowed the blue pill
No control to have control, they lied
So here we go down the rabbit hole, tell them "Goodbye"
And say "Hello" to the guy you probably never say hi to
Senior year of high school was more like goodbye school
Never turning back like a bike with no brakes
Hopped on my 3 speed with E.T. and went straight for outer space
But I like to say "thanks"
To all of the dames
Who did not give a name to go with my face
Then I look into the mirror
Reflection start to change
Said, "Hello" it said, "Hi"
Now look what I've became

[Hook] [Jupiter One]:
A little bit closer
Try a bit deeper
Look under the sink
Cause there I am
Filled with plaster
The same fucking bastard
Mystery man

A little bit closer
Try a bit deeper
Look under the sink
Cause there I am
Filled with plaster
The same fucking bastard
Mystery man
