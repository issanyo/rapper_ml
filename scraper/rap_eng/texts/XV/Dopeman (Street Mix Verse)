[Sample Hook]:
"Dopeman please can I have another hit" - N.W.A. 'Dopeman'

[XV]:
Got sick of niggas asking, I jumped up and got my acid
To the booth, no pen and pad except the walls that's in this room
At 14 I was slanging at 15 I got my name and
Pushed my albums like it's dope so there's no intentions on changing
Five knocks on the door was the arrangement
Sorry, I retract that statement until my nigga's arrainment
It was hard for me to slang it
Kareem told me to weigh it
And I cut it like Jason's vacation in that Crystal Lake Inn
Oooh
Did I kill 'em with that?
Final Fantasy potents couldn't heal 'em from that
So ain't nobody stopping it
Enjoy, sit back, start watching it
Colder than a polar bear and we just polar opposites
You mean, I'm nice yo
Loosey, tight flow
Full meal, rice bowl
I'm ill, night cold
Hype Will, Spike Jonze
All State, Geicko
Scarface, Esco, Dopeman, let's go
