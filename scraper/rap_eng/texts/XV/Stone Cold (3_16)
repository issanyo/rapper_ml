[Intro]
Yeah, Stone Cold
Three one six
Vizzy!

[Verse 1]
See I rep that city I'm from, uh
Pay the crib, price tag, in cash, now your bitch wan' come, uh
Swallow two dime bags, thinkin' I don't throw up the dub
Now watch as the stock go up
Old bitches on my cock, so what?
Said she got the bomb, so I fuck 'til that girl blow up in the
Three sixteen
I rep that three sixteen
That's where I start so I pour my heart into my three sixteens
Cause I know that I got 'em watchin' when I'm droppin'
Quiet those sheep, Anthony Hopkins
Now we blow checks and them girls want texts
Can I roll X? Yes they watchin'
That ain't new, it's just new ones boppin'
I been a mac, them niggas window shoppin'
Uh, we call it internet browsin'
Blew up my scene cause I hate bein' doubted
Give me my space cause I hate bein' crowded
The boy so square cause I hate bein' rounded
And we came out of section eight housin'
The VIP section loungin' out in the

[Hook]
Three sixteen
I rep that three sixteen
That's where I starts so I put my heart into my three sixteens
And I rep that three sixteen
I rep that three sixteen
Yeah that's my home, I'm so stone cold, I'm just so three sixteen
Can I get a hell yeah? Uh-huh, "Hell yeah!"
Can I get a hell yeah? Uh-huh, "Hell yeah!"
And I rep that three sixteen
I rep that three sixteen
Yeah that's my home, I'm so stone cold, I'm just so three sixteen

[Verse 3]
Name a thing that we can't do
MTV and Shaheem Reid came through
The city I've been in can see that I'm winnin'
And made the decision that I can't lose
Cause I was unheard, my shit still slap like Yung Berg
And the town where we give those officers space
But they still get mugged like Lumberg
Oh, is that absurd? You thought we was all just some nerds
Man you must be out your rabbit ass mind
If you think we don't keep them thumpers
Would've thought niggas been learned
Comin' out the city where the wind turn
Where our OGs haven't told me if you hold heat you might get burned
So I kept one inside my dresser
Cause you never know if one might test ya
Under the right pressure them killas squeeze
And thought you sneezed, God bless ya
God bless us, killed the game now damn you
I didn't have to shout where I'm from
But I still tote like I wear boots
Ladies gettin' their hair cute, L7s in the air too
Now I'm just multiplying myself, call that a square root
This here's a square's roots, chains, whips, and bars
Man I came here from Oz and my aim is the stars, in the

[Hook]

[Break x2]
I'm-I'm-I'm rollin', I'm-I'm rollin'
Shocker yellow, black, and golden
Where the 'Lacs look like they stolen
On the highway they patrollin'
And that kid with that green backpack
Writing raps be fuckin' flowin'
I say now they fuckin' know it
Now you fuckin' know it
