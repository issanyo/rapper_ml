[Intro: Kanye West]:
Didn't you know I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules
Cause I just heard some real bad news

[Verse 1: XV]
Yeah, the 11 Freshman speaks out
Everybody waiting for the list to leak out
I came off the benches, aiming for the fences
I was close to home and they said "He's out"
Sean asked, "Did XXL reach out?"
And that question hit me over the head like Steve Stoute
The game ain't a trap it's barely a weed house
But I'll be damned if my plans reroute
In '09 I lived what I always dreamed 'bout
The X-Man blew, yeah Beast out
A couple manager's later, a few new haters
And I think I got it made, hey, clean house
Big Sean asked, J. Cole knew
Nipsey Hussle wondered, Wiz did too
The flood gates opened on the first thing smoking
And I'm just hoping that I fucking get through
Down the Rabbit Hole we go when they pay me what I'm owed
The day it comes, I feel I'll never know
My fans get discouraged like, "Will he ever blow?"
So I'm heard about through word of mouth and everyday it grows
But this shit is like relationships and everywhere it shows
Cause my girl is getting jealous after shows
Where everybody loves me, just like we hoped
But the screams so far, we don't seem so close
Now think about that and let it soak
While I sit and think about raps that I wrote
For Everybody's Nobody
Damn, so dope man
Manager dropped the ball, hope he don't drop the soap
And if you wanna touch base, nigga talk to Pete Wentz
Kid with a dream
Where is he went?
I'm seasoned for a Lost episode fourteen
Looking right and left like it don't make sense
Sandlot kids, everybody's Benny
Am I the only one who found it cool to be Squints?
Catch my metaphors and say "ooh" like Prince
But miss it and your shallow ass thinks I'm dense
Arguing on Twitter with a nigga who just got tight
For some reason he thinking I owe him my life
It ain't cause I'm from Wichita and on Nahright?
It's because I'm from Wichita and in they eyesight
The face of the city, I can't help being
Reaching out to old friends for my well being
And I'd hate for them to think that I'd change
When we hit them all a halfway ball like Belding
And I saw y'all's eyes
Everything is different and I don't know why
Get it to the point closer where I don't try
How's relationships sink if the water runs dry
I think the bank full is a tank full
So when that day's close, I'll be thankful
Kids that ain't cool found a voice to sing through
And that's more than a reason why I can't lose
Dynasty album track 14
But the fear that they won't is the worst thing
How it never happen is a big fucking riddle
Now my circle nice and small like A cup nipples
Wouldn't get a shot like I can't touch pistols
Now I'm turning, this the Blueprints for a missile
Fuck You, Him, Her, Tom, Dick and Crystal
Sob
That feeling is so blissful
All I saying is when they gonna pay it is past due
One of the hardest working of all of these rap dudes
And if it ain't me then you better ask who
And when they say a name say, "I got some bad news."
