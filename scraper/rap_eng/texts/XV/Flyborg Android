[Verse One:]
You are now tuned in, who him that dude from outer-space
Get a look, move close, zoom in, make sure you get my whole face, thanks
Flow like this belongs in a bank
Inside man, I get out without a trace
Like freehand, watching He-Man episodes on a crashing plane, dang
Never heard of me well you can't be blamed
Born on a leash now I can't be tamed
My car gone wild like girls gone wild I dropped the top and they all went insane
And I don't even like to flash like a camera outdoors
What for if they know my name?
X-Vizzy in the Subcon Twizzy
And it all makes sense cause I'm all about change
I'm a

[Hook:]

[Verse Two:]
We are now, losers who win I be all over Myspace and Facebook
Come view, Youtube in, make sure you check all of the plays, thanks
Flow like this belongs in a vault with a case in a safe in a safe so it's safe
Like home plate, watching cold case episodes on a chair going out to space
Never heard of me well what a waste
Born in a state that I can't be placed
The boy got style make the girls all smile say the dude XV is the latest craze
And I don't even like to flash like a camera outdoors
What for if they know my name?
X-Vizzy in the Subcon Twizzy
And it all makes sense cause I'm all about change
I'm a

[Verse Three:]
Spaceship stickers on my locker, man I'm a fucking dreamer
Your girlfriend likes my shoes, so now I gotta sneak her
Into my room, underseas like the creature
From the lagoon, so here's the number to my beeper
If you call and I don't hit you don't call it quits too soon
I never get good signal when my distance by the moon
Cause I'm a flyborg android, just sent here to take you higher
She be like, "damn boy, you just got me so so tired"
Squarian fanboys say "your flow is oh so fire"
So all I ask is that you please turn up your amplifier
Please turn up your amplifier
Please turn up your amplifier
Please turn up your amplifier
Please turn up your amplifier
