(Girl)
If you like that, I can throw it back
Tell me what you want, daddy, I can throw it back
If you like that, I can throw it back
However you want it, daddy, I can throw it back

(XV)
Yeah, I like that, baby, throw it back
Tell me what you want, baby, I ain't holding back
If I like that, will you throw it back
Anything you need, baby, I can give you that

[Verse 1]
What's the deal, baby, tell me what you wanna do
You wanna ride on me, I can put that thing up on you
I can have your legs up till you scream from ?
I came here to please and I ain't in no hurry

And if you want a nigga to beat it up I can do that
Turn over girl you ain't ready I liked it from the back
Do your thing to you reach your climax
I know I did my thing by the scratches on my back

Nah, let me slow it down, just give you a little bit
You know who to call when you really need you a fix
Ain't no other nigga gonna hit it like I hit
Got plenty stunnas so I got that all night dick

Fuck that, back to beast mode, let's go
I feel you tighten up so I know you 'bout to blow
We in the bed o there's no where you can go
I'm doing my thing, hell no, I ain't about to go slow

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What up, ma? What it is? How you doing?
You see the look in my eyes and can tell I'm not screwing
You look nice and fine so there's room for pursuing
Let's go back to my hotel so we can diggy-diggy-do it

Lil' mama you a freak and you can work something
Let's go back to my suite so I can hurt something
I ain't no average prick when I hit the sheets
I'm too deep, all inside you, I can feel what you think

Girl, I love hittin' it from the back
Pull this, slap that, yeah, baby, you like that
You put it on your lil' ass until you crack your back
Put your face under your pillow, stop running and fight back

Eat it up, beat it up, baby I'm working your cat
69 is just fine, long as you giving it back
?, there you go, jerk it, slurp it just like that
Skeet skeet. There you go. Don't spit, girl, swallow that

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She love the flow, wanna be in my show
Show a nigga gold digger how she be on my dough
Eery nigga with a dolla holla she in the do'
So I pull her to the side, told her this on the low

Mami, tell me how you want it, I can give you some mo'
I ain't fronting, telling you nothing, let's leave in the Rove
I said Rove, she thought Hov and now she leading me home
Now we on the highway, she let me skeet in her throat

Nah, baby, I'mma leave it alone
Got rolled when I saw baby that she in a thong
I got hard when I saw that she was leading me on
To the bedroom once I step my feet in the do'

It was on, she was ripping my clothes off my back
Kissing my chest and lick me from the tip to my sack
She Liked the way I pulled her hair when she rolled on my lap
Hold that ass, I'mma give it a smack. That's when she told me
