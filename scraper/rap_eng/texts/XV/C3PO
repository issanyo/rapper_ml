[Intro: XV] (x2)
Yes my watch is gold
And my chain is gold
And my condom's gold
I'm C3PO

[Hook: XV]
I come to my city lookin' like (C-C3PO)
My gold chain shinin' in the night (C-C3PO)
Got a gold bottle sittin' on some ice (C-C3PO)
I'm like
"Welcome to Solid Gold"

[Verse One: XV]
Got bars of gold so my cars gold
My rims gold, credit card's gold
My bottle's gold, my model's gold
My watch is golden my condom's gold
My fish is gold
So much gold I shit gold
My grill is gold
No duh my chain gold
My backpack green but I paint it gold
I'm C3PO
With these trees I wrote
Don't pass no blunts to my bro
He gotta see his PO
All these gold bottles on deck
And gold chain on my neck
Got these models up on dick but I keep that ass around like Shrek
In case I ever need to be reminded
500 chains that'll leave you blinded
300 niggas in gold that I roll with
I'm Leonidas meets King Midas
Girl you don't gotta be so coy
Love it when they call me "freakazoid"
Now a nigga got on all these medals
He feel like he about to freak a droid
Cause I love gold
"Goooold"
"Black gold"

[Hook: XV]

[Verse Two: XV]
Got pounds of gold so my crown is gold
My sound is gold, I'll drown in gold
Got golden spoons, got golden forks
No golden hair, you a golden lord?
My shades got a gold rim
My jay's got a gold trim
My fitted got a gold brim
And my bitch work out at Gold's Gym
She want the gold drink with the gold flakes
You get wild and go ape
Been killin' shit for awhile now
My mixtapes is on Cold Case
Playin' Goldeneye with the gold gun
PP7 with a gold drum
Reload weapons at .4 seconds on an X-Box console I go dumb
I heard he likes 'em trashy
Oh yeah you ain't been heard
You be my V-Nasty
I can be your n-word
Don't ride in no taxi
I get drunk and then Swerve
That is word to Big Bird
You big nerd
Go and tell 'em I love gold
"$50,000 Solid Gold Twinkie case"

[Hook: XV]

[Verse Three: XV]
My teeth gold (swag)
My ring gold (swag)
Gold diggers dig me cause they think that my thing gold (swag)
My 360 gold
My Atari gold
Gold chains for my Entourage
I got that Ari Gold
Iâ€™m diabolical
Only one eye like a monocle
Saw the guns fly and I got low
In the hood that's what you gotta know
Commercials airing on TNT so they see I gotta blow
And if you ever seein' me
Bitch you know I got on gold

[Hook: XV]
