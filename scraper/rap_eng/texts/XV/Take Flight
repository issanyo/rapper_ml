[Verse] [XV]:
They say they don't like me
I say you don't have to
Take 'em out they misery
Fuck it I'll be glad to
Haters play they part on next time I ain't gon' cast you

Pants raised, hands raised, Green Backpack too
Coach kept benchin' me
Hoes kept dissin' me
So I was just gone at home playing Centipede
Fly Boys Club yeah, I know you fuckin' with us
If you ain't then will you take your girl and go and get up
Cause if she stay then she gon' see the place we cook them hits up
She say, "Isn't that AB?" I say, "No baby that's dinner."
Spring, summer, fall I was a loser now a winner/winter
Play PG now I got my eyes on the center
On a 10 D's human, cheer my name and you will end up
V.I. double Z.Y. and she will see why when I'm in her like...
