[Verse One]:
When it's top 5 of '09, come get me
I've never been gassed, been riding off empty
I don't know where humble rappers even went B
And I've never been jealous it just isn't in V/envy
So when I spit a rhyme they be like, "You insane"
Cause I just speak my mind which means I use my brain
A nigga be rapping for like two days
And drop a mixtape like me and you are the same
But don't let me be the blame or try to destroy dreams
Keep your glasses on four eyes, cause I am foreseen
Speaking in vain, won't even let God intervene
Real life and a dream, I am in between
"Fuck you, pay me" is how I'm finna be
Cause my blood run as cold as Mr. Freeze
I just believe it's watching too much TV
Recite the lyrics and now they wanna be me
Welcome to Mario World, I tell 'em "pipe down"
Stay outta my mound, you ain't taking my crown
If you the future, and he's the past
Neither one of y'all should be rapping right now
And right now is like me verses me
And this tape is like all my last verses free
Cause I dropped 80 songs
Thanks to those who listened
Fuck those who didn't
They want an intermission, this is it
This is it

[Verse Two]:
I still bring the streets fire
So I hold down the block (like what?)
Like the back button on Street Fighter
They should retire the rap version of retire
Cause niggas thinking they fly, but I see wires
These liars better respect me
I slowly fizz to the top pouring my Pepsi
Created Fly Boy Club and now they want a membership
I played dumb till Shang Tsung said "Finish it"
So thank God for video games
Cause these lines would never be rhymed while I was doing sentences
So to my niggas that's been gone with no flight back
I apologize for times that I ain't write back
Only 23 years and you should know
I started early, I never heard the rooster crow
You know the alarm stop before the alarm clock was even set
Ha, so how is you gon' blow?
They know I'm here to get it popping like Leo out of the sewers
Jordan hand, bandanna looking bluish
Back Pack, where's my shell's at, yep it's Green
For those that's sleeping, just let them dream
Cause this is it
