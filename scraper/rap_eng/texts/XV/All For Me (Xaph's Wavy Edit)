Bank bank banking is off shore (banking banking is off shore)
(Now Now) Now I ask for dutches (now I now I ask for dutches thinking)
Never been a virgin (never never been a virgin 'cause)
Doing something different, I’m getting top in convertibles
And I don’t spend a thing (I don't I don't spend a thing)
(I be in the cut I be I be in the cut)
