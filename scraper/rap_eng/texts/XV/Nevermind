[Verse 1: XV]
I could never find my car keys and I have never pulled a map out
And the closest that I get to the outside world is my desktop background
But I done got all dressed up since I stepped out and impressed ya
It’s sad when ya homeboys text ya saying
If you come, we won’t ask ya till next month
What a loner, owner of my sofa
Controller of my life with my remote controller
Outta this world, how am I solar?
Message in a bottle, lemme finish my soda
Calls coming through but my phone ignores it
The world's outside, won't you go and explore it?
You're what them girls came for? Go for it, one-two-three, now forfeit

[Hook]
I was just about to come out of my room
I was gonna turn off my X-Box too
I was gonna step out the whip in a fresh outfit
And then I went and thought about you
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind

[Verse 2: XV]
Why be saying never mind?
Walking it with girls that is never mine
She finding me side-eyeing
I mean she hella fine and I be like I holler at another time
What a loser, abuser of my computer
Open up the windows through windows and watch it boot up
Playing Tekken Six as long as I get Kazuya
Damn, I swear I used to seem much cooler
Used to step out fresh to the party world
Wasn't into her but she was such a Barbie girl and all she wanna do is go out
I wanna stay in and she gonna show out
Roll with an entourage like my name was Ari
Don bounce around like pong in Atari
It’s funny how they use to have parties and call me
Coat checks turn to rain checks, I'm sorry

[Hook 2]
I was just about to come out of my room
I was gonna turn off my X-Box too
I was gonna step out the whip in a fresh outfit
And then I went and thought about you
Never mind (17x)

[Bridge: XV]
I was like I'ma be gone so long, I forget what my home look like
I was like I'ma sit in traffic, just blasting my music while I chill in my ride
I was like I'ma see the girl of my dreams and this time, I'ma say hi
I was like this close to supposed to thinking I might, huh?

[Hook 3]
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind
