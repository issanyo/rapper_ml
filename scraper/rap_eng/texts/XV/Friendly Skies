Uh yeah uh huh
Vizzy Zone
Look
I say it's my time every time I see a clock
And now I think I finally found a watch that ticks to my tock
From the Mid trying to get to the top
On the Northside of the wicked witch of the block
Why so reluctant to give me my props?
Show these haters yellow lights I just wish they would stop
Highway to heaven have I missed all the stops?
Hellbound bound growing horns on my knot (?)
Yeah
I'm just making sure that I got
One life to live, one night to give to the woman of my world
Cause I'm touring a lot
So we set up an web cam up at every stop
Uh I chose this life as a early teen
But I can't open up my eyes and ignore the dream
It seems we getting less leaders and more machines
As I fling down a dark corridor with Coraline
Keep 'em in tune
There is more to see
They hoping that I bloom, like a florist's dreams
I keep popping up on blogs with the fear that
I won't cross your mind if I don't come across your screen
Show a smile every time I am on the scene
I just want the plaques I don't floss a thing
I seen kids laughing back up on my old block
Wonder where that joy has went as I globe trot
And I ain't got the time to be playing hot potato with record labels
Cause the music I make won't
Stop
And they see when he rhymes everybody give me fives
Like a change for a twenty
Or a bum when he tries
I sigh
Waving goodbye mean world
Hello friendly skies

And I'm Vizzy
And this the layover
