[Verse 1]
Mustard on the beat, got mustard on my shirt (unh)
Ashes at my feet, smoking something from the Earth (yah)
Coming for the cake and I’m fucking up desert (yerdigg)
And bring me a Serena if a girl is gonna serve
Word, I’m saying you would not believe
How hoes think you hot dog if you got the cheese
And if you got the G’s, they would drop the knees
Bitches give up the buns just for poppy seed (Ah!)
After 2014, won’t see yellow the same
I don’t think I’ll eat Jello the same
And I took a break just to level the game
You need angels on the field when the devil is playing, I'm sayin'
And Awesome been missing from my calling log (brr-brr)
Feel like we been missing those king of dialogues
As I’m in the booth writing this monologue (monologue)
With mustard all over it like Chicago dogs
Poppin’ off, rocket launch, 2015
Astronaut dreams, The Kid with the Green
Dropping bombs, Comic Con, on the big screen
Big dreams, then X leaves on an X-Wing
It’s that year and they telling me to own it (own it)
And I’m a do it without any mustard on it (nothing on it)
They must heard that I don’t ever let up
So if I never catch up, I just relish in the moment boy
I just relish in the moment
I just relish in the moment, relish in the moment

[Bridge](2x)
Poppin’ off, rocket launch, 2015
Astronaut dreams, The Kid with the Green
Dropping bombs, Comic Con, on the big screen
Big dreams, then X leaves on an X-Wing

[Verse 2]
The Midwest, KS City, I am from (I am from)
We don’t have much but I got it done (nope)
They said the homie wasn’t violent son (got it done)
So they hit him in his back as he tried to run
Two shots, life in the boondocks
Where you wish it was as simple as a cartoon plot
But it’s not
And this is where I'm writing right now (right now)
Square in the Circle again, trying to find my style (right now)
Where Michael is Brown, cops still shot him right down
Left him lying around, how can I define my sound?
Defining hope when people suffering in the street
And all we got is Mustard on the beat ho!
It’s like a foot fetish
You know it’s something about the defeat
That gets me jumping out my seat just to fuck up how you think
Like Daze & Hype Will was always on the screen (remember?)
Or 2013, Mike Will made everything (remember?)
That’s how the game is and now everything changes (right?)
Too vain running through veins and dames is dangerous (right?)
Trying to take trips with niggas who’s famous
Just to get a quick flick but bitch you ain’t shit
I’ll take a waitress who makes tips
Brought some weed, picked up a fee, then ate chips (right?)
Play video games with on some foreign exchange shit (ya know?)
Next day, the same thing just so she can pay rent
I’ve been waiting hibernating in a Bat Cave
You been hating, probably dating off a bat page
I just beat it, then I leave it in a fast past
Tears streaming down an Emoji sad face
The rat race I was running in, usually coming in the last place
Would never could fucking win
But I’m that nigga, I’m that nigga
Going fucking in till the fucking end
