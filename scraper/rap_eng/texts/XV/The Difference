Catch me in your city top down looking mellow
In the S-Class R Kelly piss color yellow
Niggas mad barely even wanna wave "hello"
My honey's Bill Cosby booty looking like jello
Chamber ? I change up my rap figures
I'm a 2-liter of gas
Hold a flame to that nigga
Funk Flex ain't heard a blast like that nigga
By the way, tell Flex I am that nigga
I'm so deuce unaffiliated still I'm thinking "shame"
You my nigga to the grave
I'mma keep ?
Royalty city studios nigga blazing
Ain't this a bitch I got rich and kept the ?
With slugs spraying every way and direction
These niggas ain't hard all the time
They erections
These mixtapes is something that I have fun making
Throw me the beat, bleak, and I'mma one take it
Let's
