[Verse One]:
Nah, I was never the type that all the fly ass honey's liked
My clothes and kicks weren't always tight
And they would always tell me like
"You ain't cool enough."
(Ain't cool enough?)
Ain't cool enough
I guess a brother must have gone to school too much
(School too much?)
School too much
Uber geek
Green backpack on I had my songs on compact cassette tapes
And played them for girls I like and I would love to date
But they weren't good enough
(Weren't good enough?)
Weren't good enough
I guess back then I wasn't hood enough
(Wasn't hood enough?)
Nah, I wasn't hood and I wasn't tough
Things started changing when my closet rearranged
And I'm balling starting hanging with the ballers and the gangstas
Niggas asked who was I?
(Who was I)
Who was I
Then ladies started saying, "That dude was fly."
(Who was fly?)
That dude is fly
Yeah, uber fly

[Hook]:
See all I ask is we we get past
All that that has passed
And in in our past
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)

[Verse Two]:
Uh, wow, now
I'm that dude, took 14 years for me to find that cool
Then I met you and you liked my moves
And I told you that I liked you too
So we did the thing
(Did what thing?)
You know that thing
And I watch a lot of porn so I did my thing
(You did your thing?)
I did my thing
(Well at least I think)
Cause all a sudden girls were coming by the flocks
And they are telling me I'm hot
I start feeling myself a lot
Then I broke up with you
(I broke up with you)
I'm an asshole dude
I guess I got a lot of growing up to do
(I know it's true)
That's up to you
I know it proof

[Hook]:
See all I ask is we we get past
All that that has passed
And in in our past
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
See all I ask is we we get past
All that that has passed
And in in our past
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
Please forget me
(Please forget me)
