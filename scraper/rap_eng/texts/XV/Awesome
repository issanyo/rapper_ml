[Refrain]
Cause I feel so awesome
How you feel
Awesome, I guess that's awesome
Shawty you fine and your body is awesome
Wanna roll
Awesome, well let's go, awesome
Hands in the sky like

[Verse 1]
I'm A-W-E, some call me awesome
You don't wanna miss it like a very special blossom
Gator on my shirt, what did it Lacoste him
Jesus Christ I'm good please don't cross him
How rude, Stephanie Tanner
You don't gotta watch me but please watch your manners
And the girls I be meeting be Planters, nuts
Saying I should lay down green on a ring like lantern
I been on it for a while, trying to get my spot
Had a lukewarm buzz back when Luke was hot
I been bumping Pink Floyd, all I wanted was my recording label deal
Trying to escape like Cuba Gooding with the flow
First CD out, sold at Sam Goody
Sold out shows, girls trying to get a glitz
Good Will Hunting, got up out of the hood
Now he's coming to America cause that boy good
Now tell me what got two thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes
Two thumbs up, you gon point 'em at this guy
Al Hedison couldn't be this fly so ask how I feel and you know I reply

[Refrain]
Like I feel so awesome
How you feel
Awesome, I guess that's awesome
Shawty you fine and your body is awesome
Wanna roll
Awesome, well let's go, awesome
Hands in the sky like

[Verse 2]
I'm awesome every time I lay it down
I think that I kill em, play possum
Death proof ride with Rosario Dawson
Tell em open wide when they see how I'm flossing, ching
Cooler than a peppermint
Wayne's World excellent
Party on Garth, shwing
Work ethic harder than a Mexican
That's why I can walk up into any restaurant and close the whole thing
See even G couldn't F with it
Semi colon dash parenthesis, text messaging
That's a side smiley face cause I'mma make the best of it
I assume you should make room for the elephant
Boom, where I come from is irrelevant
‘Cause my glory is all that I revel in
Plus I'm hotter than the pasta that the devil sent
And y'all can just deal with the rest of it
Now tell me what got two thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes
Two thumbs up, you gon point em at this guy
Al Hedison couldn't be this fly so ask how I feel and you know I reply…
