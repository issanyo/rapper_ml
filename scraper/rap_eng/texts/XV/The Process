[Intro] [XV Talking]:
What up Detroit? Jay, Dilla. Uh huh. What up Illa J? You know I figure I'd let people in on my one two process, you know. On how I do my one two thang. Yes sir. Oh shit, I was supposed to come in two bars ago. Hold on

[Verse]:
Yeah
Close the Internet browser
Allow us to boom on the track like Bowser
Typing like computer nerd, Doogie Howser
Do you like my futuristic flow, Mr. Powers?
Howard the Duck
I've been here for hours, the fuck?
I gotta finish one more track for the cut
Neighbors banging on my wall, they say I keep them up
Not knowing what I'm doing is what keeps me keeping up
Not knowing what I'm proving is that if I keep this up
That I will possibly be moving by The Jefferson's on up
So I keep on keeping on
Curtis Mayfield sampled long
Chop it up and top it up with some deadly kicks and drums
Um
Yeah, let's render it
Down to a wave file
Put a quick 16 on it
Upload it to Myspace
See what all my guys think
If you come through my space, this is what they probably doing

[Hook]:
EQ a bass so it got a little bit of knock
And turn my vocals down a bit, make sure they ain't too hot
Add a few effects and then we'll make the beat drop
This is the process
We rendering and sending it to all the local spots
All the DJs and the homies on the block
Get a buzz, make 'em wait for the album to drop
This is the process
