[Intro: XV]
Yeah
You know what it is
Vizzy Tone, uh

[Verse 1: XV]
Okay I guess I’m back on my shit again
Baby girl the one and I just hope that she listenin’
I ain’t givin’ lines, ain’t nothin’ assemblin’
And even when I try to act like I’m a gentleman, I’m givin’ in
Tryna get her wet like she a gremlin
But I be outta state so we cope like citizen
We writin’ notes like we ten again
But she cold like December wind
And she keep buyin’ wrong size jeans
Cause she know I like skin when she keep tryna fit ‘em in
And I hope that you know what this hotel clerk know
When we get this room, we gon’ get it in
Soon as we punch in, they gonna kick us out
She a quiet girl, but her friends is loud
They know what Vizzy ‘bout, cause she ain’t talkin’ bout
A comedian when she be braggin’, sayin’, “And he dick me down”
And ain’t I used to just sit around?
I’mma own this square she don’t get around
I hope that head game good enough to fit a crown
We goin’ blow for blow and baby ain’t gon’ win a round
She love that leg up, throat choke, pin her down
Keep my head up on that rowboat ‘til I drown
Cause I would never get up out it
Especially if you in my favorite outfit

[Hook: XV, B.o.B., Bruno Mars]
I know I ain’t the first one but I’mma be the last one
Cause them other dudes got nothin’ on me
I ain’t gotta ask ya, you come out that bathtub
And you know exactly what I really wanna see
Nothin’ on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you, babe, n-nothing on you)
Nothin’ on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you, babe, n-nothing on you)
I know I ain’t the first one but I’mma be the last one
Cause them other dudes got nothin’ on me
I ain’t gotta ask ya, you come out that bathtub
And you know exactly what I really wanna see
Nothin’ on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you, babe, n-nothing on you)
Nothin’ on you, baby, yeah (N-n-n-nothing on you, babe, n-nothing on you)

[Outro: XV]
Yeah
Now she gon’ ask, X, why ain’t you lay a second verse?
And I’mma be like, baby we ‘bout to lay a second verse
Hahahaha, yeah!
