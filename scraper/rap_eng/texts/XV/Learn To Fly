[Hook: Betty Trouble]
I learn to fly, so you
You run to find the gun
To shoot me down
Before I get too high
I learn to fly, so you
You run to find a gun
To shoot me down
Before I get too high

[Verse 1: XV]
See, I grew up on that Northside
Where the ballers don't play courtside
They wear colors
And ride for they brothers
Throw up they C's up and B's up and courts high
And I touched my first 45
When Jordan was wearing that 45
And I couldn't ball, I was like 4'5"
So I stayed inside writing up more rhymes
Well of course I
Had problems with thugs
Who told me that I couldn't get any love
In the city I'm from
Don't know why
I stay here, never said bye
Dad said no, Mom said try
Shorty said who? Now says hi
Teacher sighs
Said what you gonna do
When you leave school
And I said I...

[Verse 2: XV]
More fire, more fire
As I get higher and higher
My bars get tighter than Rikers
When I get behind mics like I'm Myers
And they on my bandwagon, call it Radio Flyer
But if you rolling
Come on then
I hope you saving your tires
Don't buy my CD
Just to see me
Before the day I expire
I am here Permanente
I swear my name could be Kaiser
No fat lady's gonna sing
Skinny chicks in my choir
And life's a bitch
But I swear that bitch couldn't be finer
I asked my momma, where we go from here?
No clue till we die
So living like this our last is the move for the night
Called me a nerd in high school, now my school is so high
I'm flying first class, like my homeroom's in the sky
And I...

[Verse 3]
Knew that I could, when they told me I can't
Said I was good, I told them I'm great
Funny my hood, they told me I changed
And I said yea, only the game
Now I am here
Throwing up squares
Ls and 7s all up in the air
They asking me, Vizzy you really prepared?
I say hell yea, where's my chair?
Keep your throne, leave my wings
I am grown, off something
That got me flyer and feeling super, I am Mario 3
This is when no one knew who I would be
Back then, when no one would ever believe
Now they see, cause now I'm fly
With my dreams, in front of they eyes
Look...
