[Intro]
One Gang (3x)
Yeah, that's the thing about L7
We all come together, you know what I'm sayin'?
We gotta come together man
Look

[Verse 1]
I be dropout, B-I raised me
I ten wipe-out, seat-belts ain't save me
Clock in, clock out, seen time wasting
But I ain't into waiting in jail for crime to pay me
So I walked into record labels, they trying to play me
Walked into radio stations, they talking crazy
I would show out at a show, they wouldn't pay me
So why my shit got dark cause it all shady
I'm getting grey lungs talking shit and pissing whiskey
Long nights, praying my days don't end quickly
By my BM, that BMW six-fifty
I got the key to transform that bitch like Witwicky
And the John Q's, that dude is a Square
They buy son, that's the boss until Akuma appears
Suddenly they out their seat like musical chairs
Ain't gotta ask who's the leader they saluted me there

[Hook]
I hang with Crips but I only play one gang
I hang with Bloods but I only play one gang
I hang with G's but I only play one gang
We all one gang, all after one thang
Make money, money, take money, money (3x)
We all one gang, all after one thang


[Outro]
(Love life, loyalty, living long like legends) (8x)
Yeah shouts to the Squarian team
Shout to all the L7 out there representing
I don't care what side of town you on
Perry Ellis, Lee Anthony
Andrew Wiggins, Jerami Grant
I say Awesome
I don't care who you reppin'
Love life, loyalty, living long like legends
