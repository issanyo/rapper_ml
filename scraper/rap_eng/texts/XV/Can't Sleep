[Hook: XV]
(I can’t sleep) Cause I’m living my life
I ain’t living it right so every single night (I can’t sleep)
Every single night (I can’t sleep)
(I can’t sleep) Cause I’m living my life
I ain’t living it right so every single night (I can’t sleep)
Yes, every single night (I can’t sleep)

[Verse One: XV]
Throwing up L7 in your squarian picture
Identify us, you recognize, we just better than niggas
They put brackets in my jacket when they was lettering niggas
They’ll put forks in your road when the streets preparing for dinner
But if you rep it, then step in and let em in with us
And we’ve been running home, team of veteran hitters
Instagram all these bitches who come with us just to kick it
Roll our blunts and get lifted
Have sex, play X Box and live it
No wonder I don’t slumber while of y'all pretend to be
Even though I’m buzzin' like I’m outside with a pizza G
Literally, they picking Digiorno over delivery
But long as we all making some dough, it don’t mean shit to me
But you ain’t making some change, it don’t make sense to me
And easy way being the squarian you’re meant to be
And when I catch that red eye you say bye with red eyes
Cause when you tryin' to make history you don’t get to sleep

[Hook: XV]

[Verse Two: Freddie High]
My head up in them clouds, yeah I’m so far gone
We smoking loud, we deeper, that’s that headstone
Never dreaming when convenient, I mean it
My team is full of winners and I swear we all believed it
That square shit that we on, black code is my zone
Every song that I kill stamp the fact that we on
Fuck niggas and they circles, you tell em life goes on
Cause I’ve been gone and I’m still home and honestly I birthed you
Other niggas on that bullshit
Fuck that, we don’t give them passes
My flow – full clip
Cock back and light up they asses
I said cock back and light up they asses
Reload, we here, just in case y'all wanna test those masses
Next year, Degrassi, high life with my posse
We roll L, shot side geek
'Cause we in deep like Lochte
We want the crown, now stop me
I see clones that’s not me
Y'all bring it on, my team is strong
And I can always say that they got me

[Outro]
I can’t sleep cause I’m far away from you
I can’t sleep, I can’t sleep
I can’t sleep cause I’m far away from you
I can’t sleep, I can’t sleep
I can’t sleep cause I’m far away from you
I can’t sleep, I can’t sleep
I can’t sleep cause I’m far away from you
I can’t sleep, I can’t sleep
