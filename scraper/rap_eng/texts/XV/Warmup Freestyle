Heard they been waitin', so this here is pre-game
Jogging suit is still on, sub-con t-mane
I swore I get the girls and they thought that I was deranged
Now I'm like the King, run through Queens like the E-train
First she makes the "Oh" face then she give me pea brain
Her man was comin' home late, then she heard his keys rang
All my fans is funny, they be hungry like some fiends mane
I treat em like they blind to my rhymes cause they need cane
My buzz like Mr. Bean's watch, digital
But all my fans is literal
And all of them is center row
Watchin' visuals
Of Vizzy go spit all these syllables
Fightin' sentinels while yo bitch is eyein' my genitals
Wooow, the only ten I see is Bo Derrick
So I rose from the Bull, no Derrick,
I can go e-very quarter I don't promise, I swear it
And ya'll niggas still need subs like Jared
Owwww and now I'm thinkin' that Im on one
Finish what I started for that reasons why I don't run
My pride is a virgin, I won't give that bitch to no one
Ask anybody I been doin' this since '01
Holdin' down my team and I lead em like I'm Sho-gun
All my niggas eatin' passin' plates like a home-run
Vizzy on yo ass now that is what you don't want
Got it in my jeans, so you know this thing is sewn up
Pullin' up stuntin', grow up
Im in the whip makin' cop patrol much, donuts
So what, on time fuck XXL I wanna be on TIME
Ain't on RapRadar but my UAV is online
Get head and tell, oh well, I flip a coin, fine
Vizzy's on, what is he on? I call this cloud 9
Uh child's play this is easy shit
Fix ya girl's mouth and then you cuff her on some
Weezy shit
Beefin', and I don't work shit out cause that
Don't keep me fit
And I don't pour my heart out, cause that don't keep me rich, get it?
Over ya head look up and see the shit
I stopped worryin' about whose next and started bein' it
The informant for rap nerds, who raps words
Ever since my Kris-Kross colored pants were backwards
I did it for the Glory like Denzel at first
Then I turned to Benjamin Button, such a Inglorious Bastard
I'm heard of, from China to Europe
Every summer, I turn up, like turnips
My glory, my honor, my courage
Niggas wanna ride but they ain't bring they stirrups
I put this thing in gear, now they primal fear it
Im so near it they can smell it, (*sniff*) teenage spirit
They tryin to cut me hair, but this ain't "Mommie Dearest"
They tellin' me don't do it, I tell em I can't hear it
Most ya'll average I'm lucky to be the weirdest
And this is just a sample and ya'll don't need a clearance

Vizzy Zone!!!
