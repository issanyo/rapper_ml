Look
I swore I wouldn't say shit
But diss a nigga blatant
Came here from Squaria and then they bought spaceships
Face it, niggas couldn't see me with lasik
I'm Keanu in the Matrix, you in The Replacements
Niggas outline me but nobody can trace it
Cause I ain't nobody but a kid who wore braces
With a comic book collection in grandma's basement
It's only because of her that I'm still trying to make it
Every single night I think, "Damn, where the day went?"
Am I meant for this state or here to make a statement?
A homebody so being nobody is flagrant
On my NES just wishing to save greatness
This talent can't be wasted watching other niggas do it
Super hero songs, how the fuck ain't I included?
Cause I done worked to hard to see these fuckers act stupid
Rappers who rap, saying they don't listen to rap music
It took four years to escape Wichita's grasp
Me and Lil' Wayne's song helped me get on blogs fast
Finally in the race but I let all of y'all pass
Let the mags get you gassed, lit a match and watch you crash
Ha, I slowly drive by and just laugh
You Forth Of July hype, it be over in a flash
I don't expect shit that I didn't work my fucking ass off to get
That's why I gotta blast off with this
Checking my Myspace, subject line says, "Vizzy
Know you get this all the time, but I hope that you read me."
So I read it
You know what it says?
"I rap and I'm the best, check my page and you'll believe it."
That's when I seen it all
Flashback to '03, me and Bling handing out mixtapes at the mall
That's when I noticed that I've gotten really far
They didn't believe in me so how can't I believe in y'all?
Now I'm on a level, dudes on labels on my songs
Fans write back like, "I didn't think you would respond."
Nah
I ain't high, the ground is what I'm on
And where I plan to stay and plan to lay when I'm gone
Leave my pain on the stage everyday that I perform
And pray for a parade in the state that I put on
I stay strong though they sending mixed messages
Cause when the movie ends, I'm always discredited
But I chill, no sedative
I'm an acquired taste like fetishes
I tell 'em "hush" while I huff and I puff
Till I blow down the door or you could just let us in
But they won't cause that's too easy
But the hard road will make you strong though, believe me
I just felt a blow of wind on my back
In a soundproof booth, I hope my grandma is back
I need you here
Now more than ever
Career is in a jigsaw, can't put it together
Like the Molemen who never got 'em completed
Cause they didn't have the time or started losing the pieces
So before I lose my mind I try to get right with Jesus
My mom is so religious sometimes I just don't believe it
Cause I will pray for money, for gas then church had ended
And I would see the ministry drive away in Benzes
The pictures different if you looking through the lenses
Of a dude who's probably been bit more than a dentist
I could go on Z
You can see the list is endless
But I'mma stop here yo, I'm finished
