[Intro]
"The Awesome Sound"

[Verse 1: XV]
I just watched Wrestlemania 15
Remembered where I got my name from
And then I saw my grandma in my dreams
She so don't forget where you came from
So I woke up and called my madre
I'm in the South Padre
3000 miles away like Andre
Working on my album everybody wants a copy
But that's the problem everybody wants a copy!
I'm on the edge
It's been months since I've edge in my head
I'm in the stew soon as I roll out of bed
Text my girl "wish I could hold ya"
So I'm on her mind she wake up like rollers
My dick's like Folgers
People thinking I've changed in ways I can't explain
Outside of this Rocafella analysis in my brain
Cause I'm breaking up a Philly, smoking J's with my dame
While I'm trying to rock the nation and take control of the game
But Hey!
All the while I'm just disguising my fears
And falling behind my peers
And losing all of my years
They use to call me a "square"
But now everyone's weird
Old niggas dying they beards
Gay rappers wifing their beards
This is my everyday life
Cause I live this shit every day and night
They die for the fame
But I live for the game
So you only live once
Is what I could never say
This remains as my

[Hook]
This is my everyday life
Living like every days mine
Whether it's wrong or right
See I'm just trying to take my time
Cause I'm living an everyday life
And living like everyday's mine
Whether it's wrong or right
See I'm just trying to take my time
Living an everyday life

That's all I do
Yeah

[Verse 2: XV]
I'm on the edge
Been months since I edged in my head
I'm in the stu' soon as I roll out of bed
All out of Kush gotta roll up some Reg
On the phone with my little bro
Saying "Hold up your head"
And take it day by day and when you pray
Thank God it ain't life that they took away
So be thankful you open your eyes
Then he ask about the music
And I want to say I'm quitting
While sitting on a classic
Like a box spring mattress
I guess music turn trap
So I found mysef trapped
Wrote a script called "Cage"
Just to find my way back
Now that's a double entendre for putting bars on the page
You keep your eye's on the gravel you'll just be eyeing your grave
This is my everyday life
Cause I live this shit every day and night
See they die for the fame
But I live for the game
So you only live once
Is what I could never say
I can't change

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
Do I run or do I chase it
Will it come if I embrace it
Everyday life
Cause I live everyday like
I don't want an everyday life
And I will spend everyday and night
Trying to find, find (echo)

[Verse 3: XV]
Uhuh! Yeah!
Everyday I decide and find a way to say everything on my mind
Learn everything I could find and always remain fly
I'm Wikipedia and Expedia at the same damn time
You got i's better dot'em where I'm headed
Or you'll be like drunk texting your X's
You know your gonna regret it
Right now they asking who X is?
But soon they will not forget it
I'm living long as a legend
Enjoying every second
