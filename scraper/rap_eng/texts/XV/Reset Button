[Verse One: XV]
I could have been that guy, that'll drive, 5 hours out to TX
Just to get some work, ain't no telling where I'm gonna be next
Out there doing dirt, now my momma need a Kleenex
Could have been me, I hit the reset
Still, the meals from a deal leave me appealed
Out for Will Smith money that I can leave in my will
My nigga Kareem in jail, I hope he get his appeals
That's a reset button for real
And I'm still
Seeing the glass half full, they notice it
Eviction notices, soon as I put my two week notice in
My boss working like, "I hope that you blow up then"
If not I hit the reset button...go again
Scared of your goals, cause what if you don't achieve it
So college is where you go, but one day you got to leave it
The Grim Reapers feeling, one day, you're going to meet it
So just live everyday like that day you're going to see it
Me and this dude I knew well
Skipping school, trying to be cool
Two losers so we're rolling up two l's
Never got on board to our dreams going into full sail
So you know what to do well

[Hook]
Just hit the reset button
Hit the reset button
Just hit the reset button
Hit the reset button

[Verse Two: Talib Kweli]
My rhymes make you pay attention like you're Ritalin
There's a thin line between a savage and a gentleman
I never tire, hit the road like a Michelin
And if I stop, then I begin again
Making a profit because I'm cutting out the middleman
I'm giving him a ticket because he's loitering and littering
He got the game messed up
All twisted and contorted, so it's more important who you consider fam
I used to want a deal
But now I want my freedom
These industry motherfuckers, I don't fucking need 'em
Matter of fact, they need me
The problem with their business model deeper than the scratches on your CD
I see these rappers still sleeping, I call them Ambien
Consider me a beast, the epitome of a champion
This the World Series
I'm Mr. October
I hit the reset button and I start over

[Hook]:
Just hit the reset button
Hit the reset button
Just hit the reset button
Hit the reset button

[Verse Three: XV]
Ex-girl tripping
Next girl wishing that she could do everything that my ex-girl didn't
My next girl trying to tell my next ex something
They both got that reset button
The first taste of fame
I splurged on a chain, like a 1,000 DVDs and a car in my name
A bunch of friends, a bunch of haters, it all is the same
Once I watch it all go...never saw when it came
Dang
But I don't wanna get into that
Thinking back to my crew when I first started spitting raps
Drugs put us up and real stuff, I wish it didn't black
Reset and let me get it back
My son growing up
Seeing him calling me daddy
Through all the opposition I can still look at him proudly
And tell him all the things I wouldn't be without him
Brought those sunny days out me when they swore it would be cloudy
Can't wait to tell him stories about, me and his mother
And how I'd only reset to get his twin brother
What would he have to like? I wonder
But live's good, I never want another
And never hit the reset button

[Hook]:
Just hit the reset button
Hit the reset button
Just hit the reset button
Hit the reset button
