[Intro]
Unh, yeah
Unh, yeah
Yeah (2x)

[Verse 1]
Wake up
Surrounding by crumbled pages
Scrolling down Tumblr pages
For something human, it's called inspiration
I call it "purpose", you call it "work," but I call it worthless
Some niggas work like their calling is to call on the nurses
Leave your verse inside a funeral home, I never left
You second guess what I would do for the throne
I was sixteen, I get cheese to craft me a home
I packed up a loan, one bedroom and my microphone
As I hoped to make a living off the beats
My grandma fell asleep and even she lost here pulse
My goal became never say, there can't be a better place
'Til you get there, make this a heaven state
Let us pray, wake up, meditate, break up
Medicate, bake up, levitate
All I need is head and space
My city reminds me I'm not anything godly
Just a mix of complexity like I'm Biggie and Gandhi
And I'll be tight as the pants on Will.I.Am
I'm everything I feel I am
If I'm not, until I am
Or wait to the day I feel I am
Get ready for the real I am
