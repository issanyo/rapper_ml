Close the world out, get your brain noting
Break the weed out, now we chain smoking
They be sleeping on us and they never noticed
They been waiting on us and they never noticed

[Bridge]
Never noticed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They never noticed
They never noticed

[Verse 1]
Look, stop and watch me, it's just all timing
I might arrive in a car flying, with your broad I am
Wine and dining, drinking, driving, I'm buying this bar
I need some shallow hoes to drown out all of my thoughts
Smoke more so I lost endurance
I got medical cards and I ain't even fucking got insurance
Greet the botanist
Cardiologist said "why do you pour your heart in this
And still haven't gotten rich?"
Momma say the same thing, but she ain't really an optimist
Still remain competent at dropping shit
Been at it for years, studied by archaeologists
Cause the L7 language dynamic as dinosaurs
We might hit the same blogs, but we ain't on the same page
Ten years strong, still looking the same age
Nigga, I ain't hard to see me my hand raised
And wave like "Hey, I love the whole campaign, hey"

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 2]
The movement started simple like rights wasn't civil, right?
Had us feeling low to the floor, hit Olympic heights
Made Jack be nimble on his kindle when I get on mics
But anyone with a WiFi signal got a give alright
Caught a break, but I still stay driven
Tried gearing up the album with a bad transmission
So fans started waiting when they had transcriptions
Now they graduated mad cause they still ain't listen
I couldn't hit the shelves with the label misguided
The riot dies out if the crowd goes silent
ODona Bin Laden, I have not been sited
Except on Melrose rocking, shouts to that nigga Childish
But it's confusing cause I'm tweeting in confusion
Listening to Yeezus and reading about evolution
They need to know who distributing revolution
I think I found a solution, my nigga, let's start the movement
L7
