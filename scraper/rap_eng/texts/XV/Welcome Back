[Verse One]:
I played the back all my life like the lines at lunch
Till the kids at school heard my lines at lunch
Then I moved up front like the spider's trunk
If I was then what I'm now, shit I might have jumped
Like a broker on the roof and his stocks just slumped
Look out below when that flow comes up
Call me The Good Son
Y'all rappers play Russell if you want
But watch me Rev. Run this year
Catch me standing on stages, I stage the amazing
Rise to the occasion like standing ovations
Rounds of applause and I'm clapping at you all
That ever doubted Hoff, aka Ferris Bueller
The days I'm off is when I drain my thoughts
So I don't ever overflow
And as long as my train of thought is on track with the raps
Then I'm the little engine that thought he could flow
Oh!

[Hook]:
If you got Complex and waited for new shit from your boy X, welcome back
If you thought hip hop was dead till December 19th
Then I can tell y'all welcome back
If you said that boy XV put Kansas on the map
Then I gotta say welcome back
And if you knew or just ain't new
My name's XV, good evening for you
Welcome back

[Verse Two]:
Niggas putting my name in their raps
I could have them fucked up, yeah have they ass clapped
But I just ease off, let 'em rap
Cause that's all they really wanna do, correct?
To make matters worse, I'm seeing all these CB4s
And I put rappers first like a CD out the CD store
So what to blame a label for
For putting bullshit out or causing it to happen like a matador
I ain't mad at all
I ain't mad at you
I ain't mad at y'all
Nah
You condoms, I rip y'all wrappers/rappers
So can it, like sitcom laughter
Nigga, your flow played hide-go-seek
I climb Mt. Everest, you can't see my peak
Then I answer the phone like I answer the streets
365, 24-7 days a week
Nigga

[Hook]:
If you been on Myspace and you seen my face
Then I gotta say welcome back
And if you couldn't wait, for this mixtape
Then all I can say to you is welcome back
If you pointed at The Source mags saying I'm the next nigga
Then I must say welcome back
And if you knew or just ain't new
My name's XV, good evening to you
Welcome back
