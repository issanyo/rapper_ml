What's that sound?
The Awesome Sound
I know, I know
You see this life and you thinkin' like
That must be cray... and it is though

[Verse 1: XV]
That must be cray
All these shows you must be pay
Got your song on 2K12 and that Jesus piece of 24k
What's that mean?
I must be saved from these hating ass niggas who must be lame
These prerolled we must be throwed so Austin hoes say oh behave
Nigga my life must be great
I'm doing marketing plans for EA
It'd all pan out cause it's all plan out
And never had a handout no relay's
Ever since I saw my nigga get his BA out in VA
Shit's cray cause he used to keep white in the hood
Like 3k's but I see you doing good out east man...

(Hook]
Woke up feeling amazing, last night seem so hazy
Don't know where my life gon take me
Damn, that must be crazy (x3)
Don't know where the night gon take me
Damn, that must be crazy
