[Verse]:
I got my drink and my two step
Armadale Vodka and a pocket with a few chips
Went on tour for dollars, no mileage, took a few trips
Niggas be hating but they stay constipated
(Why?)
They ain't gon' do shit
Haters looking pissed off
See where that gets y'all
I'll take your dime like a Sprint call
Ha, they hate on I
But I'm like Clark Kent
I'll finally just admit, "Okay, I'm fly."
I'm like do-re-me cause I don't say lies
Say whatever name you want just don't say mine
Throw sticks throw, stones homes, I just won't die
I'm like Scarface after eight cocaine lines
New album on the way, really blow this time
Wonder if the good Lord trying to show me signs
Like, Mel Gibson
Got a Passion to be more like Cal Ripkin
This The Definition
Boy I'm a star so your broad stay wishing
But after I hit, I bail/Bale like Christian
Send your girl back and you can tell I'm hitting
Cause she comes in whistling "Boy From Kansas."
Crack rock to jump shot, I'll take my chances
Said no to the Heat like the boy Steve Francis
Raps a marathon and I swear I ran it
Shooting for the stars, look where I landed
And I keep it clean like a washing machine
I'm just trying to change the tired up way that it seems
With everything to Gain, I put my All in it
My Hammer & Arm in it till my Era is seen
