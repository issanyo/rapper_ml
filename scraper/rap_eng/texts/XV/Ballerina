[Intro:]

Dance for me...someone said
Emily...shakes her head
Lovely, gracefully, a ballerina...

[Verse One: Sez Batters]
Shorty looking right, she deserves some pay
DJ on the mic says approaching to the stage
They call her Sunshine, she cooler than the shade
She about to clean up tonight, mami got it made
All about the green, they should have called her Jade
She's drop dead gorgeous, she deserves a grave
Putting in that work like a slave
Got me 'bout to spend a G. Like she took the "we" up out of "weg"
When she get done, she approaches them niggas
Using them lines to get up, felt like I tried to pick up
Insane with that game, like Pain I'm in love with a stripper
And now she getting Flo Lo grabbing up on my zippers
Moving that ass in slow-mo, shaking like a snow globe
She gotta be from DC, look at how she go-go
Up on my pole girl got me hotter than a stove go
In her high heels, but she always on her toes though
So I told her...

[Hook: XV]
She just put it down
Every other city, every other town
Headed to the clouds, toes on the ground
That's my ballerina, she ain't coming down
Cause she just wanna dance
She just wanna dance
She just wanna dance
She just wanna dance
Yeah that girl is my

[Verse Two: GLC]
Drugs, best thing in the club
Every time I'm 'round her man I swear I feel a buzz
Gone off them buds, I forgot where I was
Man she dancing on them girls, and I'm promise that's a plus
The way she work that ass, she's so bona fide
They way she work them thighs makes a hustla' wanna try
Pour another glass, another drink on my behalf
I feel so inspired, work that ass while I ?
All up on my mind, I imagine that it's mine
Girl I hope you recognize and impress my ? drive
The feeling is alive, nothing fucking up the vibe
My eyes on the prize, I'm about to drop that bag
Bought another couple stacks, got a little bit to ?
Know when mama snap, so she twerkin' what she got
Must have, flicking, she offers no resistance
Baby bear witness this is pimping in existence
Persistence, convenient, macking my demeanor
Feeling like I just met my sexy ballerina

[Hook]

[Verse Three: XV]
I don't know if she love it, I don't know if she don't
Her dreams are never public, she keeps that in her soul
Money is in her pocket, her heart is never broke
She letting down her hair, she hanging up her coat
She drunk driving, take a drink and hit the pole
She loves "I"s and "O"s buy a vowel and take her home
I tried to get her head right, she ain't down with doing that
She ain't never met life, I showed her where Snoopie at
When you in that, black on black Lexus though
Flicking on your camera phone
Twitpic, shooting yourself, like Plaxico
Spring break in Mexico, used to work as Texico
Now she gas niggas with the thought that they can take her home
Take your money call you honey then she say she gone
Text me say she coming through, hope you ain't been waiting long
She walks in humming her favorite song, that's my ballerina, nobody even knows
