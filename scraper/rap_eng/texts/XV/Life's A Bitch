Life’s a bitch and then you die (Unh)
Life’s a bitch and then you die (Unh)

[Verse 1: Freddy High]
Just know my mind frame focus
Cause muhfucka we done all seen hopeless
Fuck what they saying from the top to the lowest
Had me praying they would all just notice
The way I’m killing shit and work got me stressing
I roll a tree, hit the track, teach a lesson
Now that’s a fee, muhfucka give it up
That’s too many times we never took enough
That’s why I’m here and I’m tired of the disrespect
A misconception if you ever seen Freddy rest
Life’s a bitch and you ain’t really tryna make a bet
I guarantee I’m the vision that you dudes see
So anytime you see them, just know it’s me
If I die on the song then you know it’s He
Barry Sanders, so you niggas can’t hold my cleats
Made for it, spit it just so they know it
Love, life, loyalty, ya’ll should know the speech
Going for it
Fourth and long and you know I’m going strong
Can’t fit my shoes, L7, we don’t know defeat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bruce Meanz]
Yeah, I ain’t ballin’ but I’m all in
An angel that has fallen
I chose to pick the brain as my garden
Let me down though, fuck it, using my instincts
Be active, finding my way to get these Benjamins
We at it again, most of these rappers can’t win
Can’t bang, don’t know what they be saying
Explain to me please, how to make it in the industry
Do I gotta get in by making enemies
Diss records with no effort, I spit reckless
Be easy, I’m cool until I feel restless
Skill add up, while zoning I crack up
Back at it, soon as I leave, I’m back addict
You stack calling, you not knowing the platform
I’m on stage where they cheer for me and [Mad Dog?]
I moved in like heroin
[?], no headphones, I don’t know when I’m a get home
I set tones with a dark touch
My heart rate jumpin’ it’s packed in like holiday shopping
Slangin’ if I gotta, life is a horror film
That’s why I’m puffing and watching, homie pass the L

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sez Batters]
Look, life’s a bitch and then you die
Before I die, I wanna take that bitch out for a ride
Had to take a break but I know she love to drive
Find the road to riches cause it isn’t only God
Getting’ money with my honey, this is living
Made it all off of the flow, take off the ceiling
Pursuit of happiness with me and her just chillin’
Brought some tree, told her light that J then, if you willin’
We trying to reach another height
So after Earth, we gon’ search for another life
Puffin’ the lye, that I’m fly, got a brother right
So if I die, I’m a ride for a hundred nights
Nigga!

[Verse 4: XV]
I got to sleep with a dream, wake up blessed
L on the table in case I wake up stressed
Charlie Duke, cause every breath I take escapes death
To get to the elevators, they make you take steps
But my shoes is Payless, Jordans on reserve
Couldn’t ball like guitar kids, so I would just observe
No wonder this opportunist nerd sit on the curb
Trying to get the piece out this bitch that I deserve
And now that life that I have earned
[Now that right I have preserved?]
And the nights I was conserved
On the mic I found the words
Life’s a bitch and more bit
So I dig in the dirt, roll up some earth and put that shit in orbit, then record it
My favorite pastime to pass time but as I’m quitting
Bitch you kiddin’,  spittin’ writtens until I flat line
Quit no, thick hoes might’ve gave me a thin pulse
But now I got the impulse to use my money as insults
Fuck your circle and your tempo
I’m a fresh breath of air out the mouth, call me X, but I think I’m Mentos
El Dorado '53 and I think I’ll get vogues
Life’s a bitch and then you then but L7 lives on
