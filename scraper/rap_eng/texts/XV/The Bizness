This right here is called the definition (X2)

What's the business, nigga?
Royalty familiar, let's get it, nigga
It's motivation for your spirit, nigga
I'm from Wizard of Oz, but I feel this, nigga
Got a brain, got a heart, and I'm rolling with a dog
Mean bite, loud bark, sound off
Come out like a groundhog
How y'all take what I love
This is my art
Bullshit with rap if you want
And talk critic till I clearly put your back to the front
Act and get jumped
Nigga, this ain't gang bang music
This is you talk and we bite
Maintain to this
The same chain you using to get a couple duffies to the same chain you losing
Nigga, give it up
And I don't even buy that ice
I rob niggas who buy it like you and sell it back, double the price
You mad haha
Shit, bump it, I'm nice
Put it all on my life
Repping the Dub for life
That's right
