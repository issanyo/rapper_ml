[Verse 1:]
Small town, big dreams
And a young boy at the age of fifteen
Had a premonition that his city would get seen
Now I’m winning, get Sheen in the city of
The home of our hero
Heroin stay back, this is dope on a needle
Do it for the people, with an anchorman ego
Sex panther cologne in a speedo
Coming live from
Everyday I have to
Its kamikaze blowing up cities you can’t come back to
Through all of their don’ts I paid mad dues
I want the world to feel me like a masseuse
Take her to Kansas, I ran shit
No ringtones, no dances
Just real music coming out, the fucking amp'ses
Painted ya’ll a picture on this Just Blaze canvas of

[Hook]
Small town, big dreams
And a young boy at the age of fifteen
Had a premonition his city would get seen
Big dreams, big dreams in
Big dreams
Small town, big dreams
And a young boy at the age of fifteen
Had a premonition that his city would get seen
Big dreams, big dreams in

[Verse 2:]
I’m in the crib dropping shit, no baby diaper
Posted on twitter, show the niggas that them ain’t nicer
Given for free, but when I sell it better pay the piper
You want bars, well this page is Rikers
Take y'all to
Where my home is, I roll with
The coldest, so know this
I won’t stop, so notice
I go in, show out
Venue, closin
The dub is gon' blow out
Tell me who is gonna hit up
I’m cool not being you
Whether you ran to my music, or just walk to my tunes
Hope you feel it in your sole, like a rock in your shoe
Middle finger to motherfuckers who thought I should move, away from
As I instruct this, get the memo
Kill instrumentals, as I’m instructed
Time to tell them about the kid from Kansas niggas can’t fuck with
And I'mma show the world what the dub is, in the city of

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
In the city, in the city, in the city of Wichita
In the city, in the city of, in the city of
In the city, in the city, in the city of Wichita
In the city, in the city of, in the city of

[Just Blaze:]
Oh yeah, it ain’t over motherfuckers

[Bridge:]

[Verse 3:]
Where I grew up, yeah where I grew up
Read rhymes that blew up, at bedtime they shoot up
Rival blocks, throwin that one and duece up
Met Set, we hooped up
Thats where I first got stoned, looking for Medusa
And, music was my calling where
I tried get to get rich bitch, Donnell Rawlings
I'm a Heights High startin', Northeast brawling
Southeast walking, in a towne east mallin'
Due from
When I was at school, with that green backpack on my back fool
Thats who, had a dream my city would be seen
Passed the cliche, Wizard of Oz movie scenes
They don’t know yo
Ain’t from KC, but next to it like JoJo
And if you wanna see I'll kindly send some photos
No yellow brick road though
Just hit the concrete in the cotton and I’m home bro
