[Verse One] [MGMT]:
This is a call of arms to live and love and sleep together
We could flood the streets with love or light or heat whatever
Lock your parents out, cut a rug, twist and shout
Wave your hands
Make it rain
The stars will rise again

[Chorus] [MGMT]:
The youth is starting to change
Are you starting to change?
Are you?
Together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together

[Verse Two] [XV]:
Is it weird that I'm aging with years
But I'm saying the things that I'm seeing is clear?
Got two younger brothers and neither is kids
And that statement stated is aching me big
Maybe it's true, maybe we are to blame
For kids at they homecoming, making it rain
Ain't it a shame at the same time they say
"Obama for Prez" just says things have changed
While kids are exposed to wrong people to follow
They all want they role, they all want to be models
We all in the dark, can't even see our shadows
The search is so deep but still we think shallow
The war is still on and we losing the battle
As I see our generation turn to adults
So I plan to step up to lead the youth next
So everyone's prepped for Generation X

[Verse Two] [MGMT]:
In a couple of years
Tides have turned from boo's to cheers
And in spite of the weather
We could learn to make it together

[Chorus]
The youth is starting to change
Are you starting to change?
Are you?
Together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together
