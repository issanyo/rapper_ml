[Verse 1: XV]
Step up now, tell me what your life like
Is it worth something? What’s the price like?
When I was still sleeping with the nightlight
You was out there living in the nightlife
Like you ain’t have a kid in your hindsight
I was coloring dad with my Lite-Brite
Just hoping you were looking for a clock
And one day, you’ll stop when you finally find time
It felt weird talking to my mom and I know she sees you in my eyes
And she gon’ get mad if I try to ask:
Do you know if my dad gonna stop by?
That play that you never saw, that ball that I never caught
All those years that we both have lost, man I hope you enjoy that all

[Hook]
I hope you bought the moon, I hope you reach the stars
I hope you found the things that you already lost
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you got to see everything you dreamed
I hope you saw the things that you ain’t see in me
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you live it, hope you get it, hope you got it
I hope you find it, hope you see it, hope you watch it
I hope you want it, hope you like it, hope you love it
I hope you achieve it, hope you reach it, hope you touch it

[Verse 2: XV]
Blue skies, white setting, big rings, nice wedding
New guy, you can walk into Heaven
Mom is a teacher, dad is a reverend
The best high heels you can step in
Closet so big, you can even fit a bed in
Middle school sweetheart, high school legend
Hotel suites so high, yellow ledges
No cable, dinner by the table
Dozens of roses whenever he’s able
Love so deep, it’s fatal, is this the kind of thing that you wait for?
Well I hope you are patient baby, wants and needs, it’ll make you crazy
Wants and needs, it’ll make you crazy, wants and needs, it’ll make you crazy

[Hook]
