[Verse One]:
Everybody wonder what beat I'm gon' touch next
I hit 'em with the twist like Usual Suspects
Watch how they mugs fall
When I come off
Youngin straighten your wall before you see success
Haters I see much less like when my eyes squinted
Said, "Hoff find your flow."
I dove right in it
Splash
Like Tom Hanks on that ass
Every rhyme intertwine and collide like crash
And y'all gave it up like Puff Puff The Magic Dragon
Pass
And the price is way too high
For me to even try to rhyme like I'm so...gassed
There
We back in here like a chiropractic chair
Any ball wanna brawl watch me rhyme 'em out of here
The deal coming soon
This just a trailer, you feel it in the air when I step in the room
Wrap it up like a bailor
Smooth Pimp C, get a circle out a square
Revenge Of The Nerds watch 'em lose to the wimps
I am Plant Of The Apes feuding with chimps
Ha, y'all niggas can't move but an inch
And I don't need a Boost when I Sprint
It's over y'all, I'm mobile, your cord in the wall
I'm Jordan buying Jordans, when I'm bored I fall
Y'all
Don't know the label expenses
Having a G4 have you soar to the mall
Nah
You're just a call away from having your brains all on the wall
But I won't be the man to pop
So watch
As I unravel the knots/Nottz

[Verse Two]:
I take time on my lines but a crook on the hooks
I'm a beast on the beats, rearrange how it looks
Look
I'm a beast on the beats, change the S and the T
While I beat on the beat's speed, please take precautions
I feed off the beef
Think I was an orphan how I feed off the streets
Got's a crook in there like a Shepherd's staff
I'm like my neck is bad
Nigga, I could go right back to the streets G
Cause it will be
Exactly where I left it last
And I ain't forgot y'all that said I'm trash
Get your mind right I'm spine tight
Yeah I'm back
Niggas cry, "I can't get X on tracks."
I make you bounce
If your checks don't cash
The Dub mad like I'm gonna give 'em away
Nah, I'm just trying to give 'em a way
What you take me for like a slave given away
Speak my speech with emphasis when I spit it today
I spill out gospel
Every time I lay a verse down
Like the twelve apostles
And please bury my fossils on the block
Where it all started from the top
Wait until Clarity drops
To see me unravel the knots/Nottz
