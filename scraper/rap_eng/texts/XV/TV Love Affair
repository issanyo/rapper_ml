[Verse 1: XV]
So I'm
Watching T.G.I.F. shows and thinkin bout
The love of my life I lost while on this couch
I just felt tremendous about my girl
That I took from this boy that wanted to meet the world
Topanga, Oh My Topanga
Can I make ya top fall down like janga, I'm playin
Mr. Feeny took my letter I was trynna tell ya
That I don't mess with this girl from Saved By The Bell
Um, Lisa oh my, my Lisa
Always been fresh since the first day I seen ya
Admittedly I cheated In Malibu with Stacy but I'll leave her
If you could come back boo I need ya

[Hook]
Nothing really matters, I don't really care
Why'd nobody tell me, I'm gonna be here
That I'm gonna be here
It's A matter of extreme importance
My first TV love affair

[Verse 2: XV]
So I don't get the big deal on why you gotta fuss
About me watching the television too much
I told you we don't talk no more you don't trust
You said you dated twins I said I'd never discuss but
Tamara, oh I mean Tia
Rodger used To cockblock every time I seen ya
Then they moved to college and I ain't heard from neither
Then I moved on to this chick
That I used to call Six
Man I loved Six
Blossom introduced us she talked hella quick
Things was good until The Parkers got into our shit
And nothings been the same ever ince

[Hook]
