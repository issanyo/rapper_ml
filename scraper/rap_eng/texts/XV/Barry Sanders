[Hook:]
Cause I'm running
Feet to the ground
I've been running
They know that my time was coming
Even when I'm away, know I'm running
Back to you

[Verse 1: XV]
I meet the track like a track meet
Trapping bring traction, so actually I should have cleats
At sixteen I'm rapping, so back then I just had beats
Till I met [Bounce?], who believed and now I have heat
At North High, north side representative
Who said I had a zone just like Barry Sanders did
And I roam by the home, Barry Sanders lived
Waiting to be grown, knowing I'm a be where he is
Well, well, now as I run 'round
The city, I'm flying, I'm riding with my gun now
Got signed and I'm flying higher, don't wanna come down
I wanna touchdown but I can't just now

[Hook:]

[Hook 2:]
Cause I'm running back
Back to you
I keep running back
Back to you (yeah)
Cause I'm running back
Back to you (Unhuh)
Running back (I'm like Barry Sanders)
I keep running back (I feel like Barry Sanders)
I Keep running back (I'm just like Barry Sanders)

[Verse 2: XV]
I'm like Barry Sanders and all, from Land of the Oz
A Cancer's that's small but handled the ball
While I manage my flaws, above all
I'm always running back to all my pursuits
To have my home town getting found by label recruits
Then reboot my high school crushes I used to think cute
Volume so high that the haters gotta be mute
Then I see you, goddamn my old flame
I took you to soul plane at North Rock fourteen
Can't 'member your whole name, 'member that house party?
I thought we did soul train and later we got naughty
Then she asked if I was coming back
Said I'm from the home of Barry Sanders
You know I'm always running back

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: XV]
Lookin' out a hotel window, missing my kin folk
Back at home in Kansas where everything was so simple
My addiction felt like H, it just tripled
And I'm just trying to play in a game full of whistles
It's like me being a Square is going to always bring issues
Like a crisis to let the cube in so I brought missiles
Let y'all get a glimpse of my calendar that I flip through
And you won't understand how I make the music I give you
Home is where the heart is, no wonder I feel heartless
City full of lights, trying to find where the stars is
Maps tell exactly where a star lives, I find myself
Looking around for a town I find a farm in
Feels like a three-by-five from '95
In front of my grandma's house by the van my momma drived
Try to move from my love of Rap
But I'm from the home of Barry Sanders
No wonder I keep on running back

[Hook]
