[Sample]:
First I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so I'm back

[Verse One]:
Play the trumpets bring the champagne flutes in
Real niggas salute him
Haters we just mute them
My crew tied up like 20 to 20 in loose ends
This the day we play where them dudes who usually lose win
When
They thought that I was using codes
I said, "I am not a con. Just been learning from the pros."
Y'all was chasing chickens, I was working on my flows
Now I set this bitch on fire
Y'all searching for the hose
Oh
This that shit that Vizzy on
Call this one the Vizzy Zone
Sing-a-long like Disney songs
Cue the strings, getting my Eleanor Rigby on
I left and came back, right for those that did me wrong
Sean John long gone, man I'm out of here
Standing out like a fucking Zebra in a crowd of deer
Put it down like 6:30
Known in any town I'm near
All I know is that I hear the sound of cheers loud and clear

[Hook]:
I know it's been a minute but I'm finally home
Yeah I'm finally home, we home, we on
And I ain't closed to finished, man I'm back in my zone
Yeah, I'm back in my zone, my zone
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it

[Verse Two]:
From Squaria to Vizzy Zone, now I'm back in class where
The Green Backpack and the desk my ass is sitting on is like the throne
Trying to be the star your broad is wishing on
End up in the Stockings like Pippi Long
Keep it on
Dropping classics
Rap sheet long as Pippen's arms
Captain told me, you keep making witty songs to get busy on
And we'll fill the wall with plaques
From I.C.T. to the 'Lacs
That's L.A.X., niggas yell they next and fail they test
They sell their soul for mailed out checks
Oh yes I am
Yoda told me, "Next I am"
Flier than that Jedi man
And I always kept my fam intact
Don't try to act like I ??? rocks in y'all
I don't ever copycat, 10-4 do you copy dawg?
Celebration drinks, toast it up and say "Mazel Tov"
Throwing back cocktails, this one is a molotov
Pen game wicked, you thought I was voodoo dolling y'all
All in all
I think this for all of y'all
And so I'm back

[Hook]:
I know it's been a minute but I'm finally home
Yeah I'm finally home, we home, we home
And I ain't closed to finished, man I'm back in my zone
Yeah, I'm back in my zone, my zone, my zone
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it
You know it
