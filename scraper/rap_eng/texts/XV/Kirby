[Verse One] [XV]:
Sick with the pen game
Vizzy's the nickname
X to the V is the game of tag and hit me on that vid game
Niggas talking down on me?!
Man, that's insane
Specially when they know I'm fly, like lil' islane
Ain't shit changed, but a lil' bit mayne
Getting money out the ass, you would think I shit change
Even with cotton mouth, I can still spit game
Freestyle?
He wild
What you think this is mayne?
Go and ask, M.I
T.S.E.B.E.H.T.M.I
Sorry bro, I was just reading from the mirror like
Robin Thicke's wizzid
But if you spell it backwards you'll see, I got it rizzight
In the hood I get pounds, in the 'burbs I get hi-fives
All over the world I'm connected like wi-fi
In Europe it's pounds, in Hawaii it's mai-tai's
All I need to know is how to say, "Is this in my size?"

[Hook] {x2}:
I'm chilling and playing Kirby
I'm chilling and playing Kirby
I'm chilling and playing Kirby
Just drinking out of my Slurpy
Just drinking out of my Slurpy
Drink drinking out of my Slurpy
Just drinking out of my Slurpy
Looking down at your Earthlings

[Verse Two] [FKi]:
You heard what I said
Your career is dead
Like Rodham as I'm getting Riverside head
I'm the man of the year
And I'm popping in here
I'm the man you should fear
Ain't no stopping me, yeeeah
They everywhere, like Izza Kizza
I only get sicker, call me the rap Hitler
Wack rappers, we differ
And Kan Yeezy want the nieces
That leave 88 with the dime pieces
My style off the wall and your shit is in sequence
I believe in Jesus
On tracks I'm a (demon)
Like I'm doing handstands my kicks are never creasing
Enjoying my Slurpy with a vulnerable Belizian
Bowman, Bowman, yeah nigga Bowman
German engineering, steering whips I'm never stalling
I'll forward you the automatic messages, stop calling
I'm zoo-zoo-zoo-Zoolander
That's all then

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [FKi]:
Homie, I'm headed for the tip top
Just watch
Me lock, this be-bop
I pop, you stop
See I prevail when I forsale
I'm one of one
I stock, Reeboks
Nah brah
Supras, yes sir
And yeah my flow is awesome
They want a verse it cost 'em
?????? cause the law coming
Whoop whoop
Be cool
Open that
Swallow that
Hide the weed
I'm drunk, can't see
Help me, here's the keys
See, see I do's this bitch
Rap is my pleasure
You'se a Joker, kill yourself, so jump off that Ledger
Heat is all I speak
I practice what I preach
Shawty you thirsty? Fuck a Slurpy, you can slurp on me
I speed these regular raps on the regular tracks
So none of y'all is when I'm killing you fags
That already understand unless I'm bumping the packs and that's wack
Leave it to the track house DAT
I don't think they heard me though
Freeze brain now my words is slow
It's FKi, Zoolander, Vizzy and Iggy, I'm trizzy yo!

[Hook]
