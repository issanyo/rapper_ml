(High Volume)
I wear my hat as my crown
Cause I'm the man of my town
Turn this joint up loud (louder)
Turn this joint up loud (louder)
So I can do it for the Northside (my town, my town)
Do it for the Southside (my town, my town)
Do it for the Eastside (my town, my town)
Do I can do it for the Westside (my town, my town)
Do it for the Northside (my town, my town)
Do it for the Southside (my town, my town)
Do it for the Eastside (my town, my town)
Do I can do it for the Westside (my town, my town)

[Verse 1]
I'm like Kobe of my town, Obi of my town
The one like Kenobi if you know me in my town
I get noticed in my town, so it's photos when I'm 'round
All through the hood, not Hollywood but I'm Hogan of my town
Coldest from my town (unh), focus of my town (unh)
See me hoes, C3PO, all this gold around my crown
I'm royalty of my town, so every night we 'round
Your best ho, with XO, she took a shot of my crown
Swerve around my town, burning herb around my town
Enthusiastic for the Curb, I'm Larry David of my town
There's bad chicks in my town and ratchets in my town
There's filters on them thirst traps but she getting tapped in my town
You sweat her in my town, you like Flanders in my town
If I fuck with that, they'll be running back, Barry Sanders of my town
Final Four, got'em going HAM around my town
But these sweet sixteens show I'm the man around my town
I'm a need

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look, look (4x)
I'm loved in my town, hated in my town
Never been played on them stations in my town
Face it, they still proud cause I made it in my town
When I'm on the mic, I know I'm like a situation in my town
No behaving in my town, they be blazin' in them crowds
Shell cases on the ground, regular day up in my town
They tellin' in my town, so they baling in my town
So I roll around with that piece like Mandela in my town
Been underground for a while now, Bruce Campbell of my town
Jay-Z to Rudy Love got a sample of my town
Come try to change my town, get your money's worth in my town
I'm Jesus of my town, that's Shuttlesworth for my town (swish)
Far from Emerald City, locations I'm going, these niggas ain't getting
Hardly saw the beginning but now that they see us, they see that we winning
No plans on seeking the ending, we sitting here putting it down
Repping my section, turn it up loud
Throw up my hood, up to the clouds
All for my town

[Hook]
