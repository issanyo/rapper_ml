[Intro]
I'm talking drop top, shorty wanna roll
And show everybody who don't know
Man I do it the most
Hands high every row from the front to the back of the show
Man I do it the most

[Verse 1]
I get going when I go in
Got bad bitches on my groin, oh
You and that girl go out, so
Why she bout to go in to that whip
That I be rollin' while video game controlling
She posted up like she posing my Lyndsey but no Lohan
And my flow is Grey's Anatomy for slow one's, I body it
I'm on my Konami shit, one inch punch karate kicks
See my way like lobbyists or Gotti's kids
In all honestness I'm quiet as a mouse with my modestness
So ketchup like a condiment
You don't know my accomplishments
Taking over villages
Burning down cottages
Selling out venues and panty raiding at colleges
Playing Raiden on Mortal Kombat ain't even shocking as this
Vizzy here, busy yeah, we raising our toasts
Up in that bread, like raisins in toast
They know I'm cut so when I'm balling I'm playing it close
Last but not least cuz I'm saying the most

[Hook]
I'm talking drop top, shorty wanna roll
And show everybody who don't know
Man I do it the most
Hands high every row from the front to the back of the show
Man I do it the most
Most amazing
Most entertaining
Most awesome
(Man I do it the most)
Most innovative
And most niggas hate it
But most see why I made it
It's cuz I do the most

[Verse 2]
Kill it when I'm in the building every time you come to shows
See them girls, they kinda cool, ask 'em if they down to roll
When we hitting the hotel is all they really wanna know
Cuz she's going down on X soon as she go up in smoke
Tell my home I am o-o-on
And I am ba-ba-back for all them cats that fronted on
I am taking hits of life (inhales) puff it long
On that train that Puffy on
Bonjour Paris I am ?
We're in the club trapped in that bottle like a genie
Felt like I hit the lotto all these models on my weenie
She said that her man was kinda like Pee Wee
And that's why all the squares in the circle wanna be me

Chorus

[Bridge]
If you shine like I shine then put your hands high and say
"Man I do it the most!"
If you grind like I grind then put your hands high and say
"Man I do it the most!"
If you fly like I'm fly then put your hands high and say
"Man I do it the most!"
If you got it like I got it then you probably over ?
And if they forgot letters, remind 'em

Chorus
