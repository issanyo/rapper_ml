[Hook: XV]
They try to say that I won't make it to the top
And now look
They try to say that I won't ever get my spot
And now look
They try to hate while they all wait for me to drop
And now look
I just think that y'all should stop
Now look

[Verse 1: XV]
See, I'm dope like Ves Saint Laurent, cause you ain't gotta say why
My home team was hating so my ear is all I play by
Music keeps me down to Earth, but I still hope my fame rise
Cause no one wants to be next to a black man unless you J5
See I'm trying to be Jay tall, you cool being Ye high
I take it to the max like a student that goes to Bayside
Get counterfeit markers, all these niggas giving me fake fives
That want to put a dot on my head, like lower-case i's
The game is crazy cause I know in that they try
To have a nigga looking dumb, promoting like St Ives
I ride till the wheels fall off, you ride till the tank's dry
And I know success is like a stopwatch, it takes time

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
I'm just like that's all you, on you
I ain't tripping, stacking chips in Palms Room
With a latin chick to put my calls through
Play some X-Box, read some comics, honest, that's all hoff do
But haters still want beef knowing I'm sick, raw food
And my ex girl texted me saying I saw you
Found out that I got another partner like Saw II
They done seen how I developed from that dark room
And sharks came out that water like you caught 'em with a harpoon
They dropped the ball too, now Vizzy got it
I'm a clock tower, I got my city watching
So little time, so many options
That girl is fine, but I know she plotting
Got bullied by the jocks and now I stop as they broads jocking
That front row filled with all they girls you know that's karma knocking
Freeze frame, picture it
Check your '03 yearbook, they predicted it
