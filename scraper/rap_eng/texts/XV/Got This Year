[Hook]
I got this year, I got this year nigga I got this year (x6)
Every year I’mma do my thing
But this my year to pursue my dreams
So I got this
Fuck they circle and fuck they hoes (x8)

[Verse 1: Sez Batters]
We got this, I’m killing shit in my rock smith
And I took this way, we hit the stage and drop off bombs like rasta
We straight up like our posture
We rock shit, ask Sasha
Throw stones at the throne, I’mma throw a bag of bones cuz I eat emcees so proper
We mobbing out like lobsters
And wear Squarian on our shirt
Then we rock em out, then pass em out
Til they put em up like dirt
Yea, the summer love don’t last
But money was always my first
I’m a lost hand for the car crash
Thank God my phantoms, it hurts

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie High]
I’m boss tip when I cause shit
And no stripe shirt when I ball bitch
And that’s raw shit when I spit flames
Now bitches think big chains
But I kill shit for that pound cake
Money talk and that sound great
And I’ve been there and I done that
And everything you want, that sound fake
No snap back, a few tattoos
I snap back my shit cashews
I kill shit, get ass
That’s every track that I cash through
Kings run this game so you pawns, that’s your last move
I asked you it’s clear
We stay reppin that square

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
You always scared of admitting, that gas don’t pay for a kitchen
And droppin whack ass albums that we should get paid to listen
The biggest name is a chain, the biggest clique is a whip
But I’mma bring back the lines, call that shit Mason Dixon
Make the L7 model and now that model's my mission
My mama back on food stamps, only brought back my vision
Predators blowin up my cell, I could’ve broke out of prison
But when it’s finally finished I’ll say we finally did it

[Hook]
