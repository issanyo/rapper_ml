[Intro]
Shout out to everybody pursuing they dream too
Much love to everybody in March Madness
My cousin MooMoo, I see you
Reppin' Syracuse
Peter Schwartz is loving that
Shout out to agency group
Yeah!
And my Taylor Gang niggas
Big Jerm, Motor Mane, Sledro, Big Lonnie what up

[Hook](2x)
It was dreams we never dreamed
Faces when never seen
Places we never been
Faces we never seen
Places we never been

[Verse 1]
I've seen niggas coming down, seen'em even going up
Bitches start going down, niggas start showing up
Saying they was their when the shoulders wasn't cold enough
When you was just no one to bluff
Now they got the coldest crush
Colder than fo' below
And I don't mean to step on any frozen toes
But I'd kill every show that I done open fo'
How you think I'm back stage fuckin' all of Posner's hoes
I Chiddy Bang her out of open toes
Who you know with plans to be global?
I'll be damned if I'm local
Watch the square in the circle become the man in the oval
Office out in Burbank got my lawyer all on the mobile
Making million dollar proposals all off my vocals
See I ain't never been hopeful, I just been patient and noble
To everybody I fuck with, so if I know me, I know you
Sometimes I'm so anti-social, I don't know where I go to
But I know where I'm headed, think it's time that I show you

[Outro]
