[Verse One: XV]
My mom said when I was young I can grow up to be anything I wanna...be
Think I age like Benjamin Button so I'm old at the age of twenty...um three
Got my head into comic books cause I've seen everything I wanna see
Met every girl that I probably wanna meet
Besides they all think I just wanna lay...D
Ha
I save the world, got the girl then I took back the video game
Yep, I had a girlfriend who broke up with her girlfriend and that there we call an ex-change
Get it?
Then I wonder what I'm supposed to do next
But when I do more, I feel useless
So be more than just my last bar and be my last cause before I blast off

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I got some time from saving the world to go and drink coffee
Trading life for some sugar and cream
Waiting on line, working the time, dying to sleep
Maybe I am missing something
I can know shit, you can know shit
It's all at our fingertips
Do we know how to think about it?
We took a torch from failing hands and lost it somewhere
Between the microwaves and minivans

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
And this is not a rebel's song
The last of those have come and gone
And this is not a rebel's yell
Just a whisper to a special girl
You told me to write a song for you
Well I wrote this song for you
So maybe, so maybe (be, be, be, be, be)
So maybe you can be my last cause
So maybe, so maybe (be, be, be, be, be)
So maybe you can be my last cause
So maybe (last cause)
So maybe (be)

[Verse Two: Colin Munroe]
Drowning myself in my despair, enjoying the guilty
But even that doesn't set me free
I've been a bum, I saw a film that put me at ease
I guess
But still I feel I should be fighting
Maybe I'll find another ? to saving the day
Then I'll wake up feeling the same
Give me a war, give me a scar, give me a name
Let me jump out of a plane

[Hook: Colin Munroe]

[Verse Three] [XV]:
My idol was Billy Idol
Please excuse my Rebel Yell
"Write me a song" she told me, all that she showed me allowed me to go and tell
Superman Returns I ain't going to fail
Or fall for any other girl in this world at all
I smashed through barriers, saved Squaria, so maybe you could be my last cause

[Hook: Colin Munroe]

[Outro: Colin Munroe]
We are young, dumb, sitting on top of the world
We are young, dumb, sitting on top of the world
