[Intro: Jazmine Sullivan]
No one wants to be invisible
Everyone just wants to be seen
I know our fame is so irresistible
Cause we all need a reason to be
So I gotta be Famous
I need to be somebody

[Verse 1: XV]
Who is Vizzy just a nigga from the middle (Ungh)
Like Malcom I guess an X fit him (Ungh)
I know the feeling when feelings starting feeling lost
But it's funny how these bars help a nigga free his thoughts
And I just hope the same niggas that help me get on
Be at the airport to see a nigga off
And everybody don't think I live in the Dub, why?
Cause I don't hit the club so I doesn't tee me off
I'm in the green
Trying to tell Warner I'll keep them in the black
Long as I'm spitting raps
Praying that they listen every time I send em tracks
You be last on this train, you'll be sitting on the tracks
Nobody backing, it's like I made my own spine
My first apartment was my one and only co-sign
?
And my momma knew what I gotta be

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
I gotta be Famous
(I know just what I gotta be, now the whole world just gotta see)
I need to be somebody

[Verse 2: XV
Look, In every song I'm on now I'm speaking for more than me
Crazy no body was there to open up the door for me
Somehow I got in like I was invited cordially
On a plane looking over the ocean, I know there's more to see
I entered 2011 with no more beef
I don't need nobody that's gonna hope I lose
Shouts to Rob at XXL helping restore the peace
Now it's finally time for me to show and improve
And every year there's a brand new hot nigga
Have that, cause that's something I am not nigga
Cause I done seen how they come and they go
And I've been building the Squarian army on the low
I got fans that say I've been down since 2004
When yo ass was probably enrolled
I was handing out blank CD's I pressed on my own
Cause all I've ever known was

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sez Batters]
Where I'm at is like if X hit the reset
I know that I'm sick, They can't take it
They don't want to know it like an HIV test
But I can feel the magic in my wrist
Now I'm on, hit the lights
Hear my wrongs, when I write
I'm giving stones through every thing I recite
Now my words is heating up with a stove for a mic
I plan to do it major, you can see a star in me
This MC's fly, so the future wasn't hard to see
About to kill the game, so pardon me
I'm better, but don't take it to the heart like arteries
Just know I'm on like noon
It's a blizzard when I walk in a room
Cause the flow clean, no need for mop or a broom
For that fact I know soon... Batters
