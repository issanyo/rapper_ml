[Intro]
XtotheV on IG, make sure you follow me
Fucking phone keep blowing up with Instagram
I can't read my lyrics

[Hook]
Instagrammin' pictures, Instagrammin' pictures
All I see are niggas and they Instagrammin' pictures
Instagrammin' pictures, Instagrammin' pictures
All I see are bitches and they Instagrammin' picture


[Verse 1]
Unh
Welcome home Boosie, shouts to Young Savage
I'm working so my brother comes home to a palace
I got king in my veins, drink in my chalice
Heavy metal in my chains, neck feeling like Alice
So many bars man I'm guilty till I'm filthy
Blowin' color purple got me spittin' like I'm Celie
Show a G love like Mike Jack in the city
Cause my jacket so thriller, my jeans worth a Billie
I"m spittin' through the wire, connect it like Google Fiber
Demand is met by suppliers, I'm setting up through the buyers
They ain't better rappers, but never seen better liars
I'm on fire (huh), wilder than Gene with a Pryor
The fixture to get richer than prior and take it higher
Mic killer like a Myers or Murray 'til I retire (huh)
I'll never tire, through good years get wealthy
I pictured it myself, IE. a selfie

[Outro]
Shout out to Sez Batters too
BARbarians in the building
You know my nigga Nick
He always be saying "no worries, no worries"
{laughs} yeah, unh!
