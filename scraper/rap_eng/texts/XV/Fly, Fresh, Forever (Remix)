[Hook: Henok Achido]

I'm tryna make a killing
Not really a kill a person
Just kill 'em with these verses
And get that money money
X2

[Verse One: XV]

Fly fresh forever ever clever fella rap
He's sick, make a PETA chick put leather on a back
Cats barely make the cut, I come and sever the track
No arms but I'm the bomb, ask the girls that I rack
She'll tell you that I slayed her no Zack, Screech!
I came up in the building with a green backpack
I done been had 'em waiting, no games playing
I'm just saying I done have the game buzzing like Operation
And now I got my face out, and look at what they facin'
I came from the depths of Hell like the 9th Jason
Violate me and your crew will get managed
By a 23 year old cold square dude from Kansas

[Hook]
