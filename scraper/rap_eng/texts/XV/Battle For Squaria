[Intro]
All Squarians! This is the last call for planet evacuation
Please report to the Octagon 15 Loading Bay for debriefing
Before the final ships sets out on escape route 1.7
Please report to the Octagon 15 Grand Hall
For your sign route schedule
All Squarians must comply for full planet evacuation

[Bridge]
A hero is born (3x)
They called him XV (3x)

[Verse 1: XV]
Now I came up to this planet like blaow
Uber-cool geek, with some pumas on my feet like wow
There's a war going on and we don't know who we fighting yet
Flyborg helmet and an L7 fighter jet
Shooting through the skies correct
Whoever tries to stop the set
The Coolinverse is here
And it's clear we ain't dying yet
The Hero or the Square?
But yeah, you can call him X
And I ain't going nowhere, check

[Bridge 2]
I fight for what I love (2x)
I fight for change (2x)
I fight for Squaria (2x)
I fight for the Hip Hop Galaxy (2x)
They will not stop me (3x)

[Verse 2:]
Going in circles in the Doper System
No squares allowed
The general said "go and get'em"
So we get strapped just to fight the famous stars
Nike Air Force fields, surrounded all of their guards
We can't get even, but we're against all odds
Sending all the women and children off in Ipods
Now watch, as only time would tell
We clean are dinner forks off
Tonight we dine in hell
And you'll see

[Interlude]
Hahahahahaha
You will change
You will become one of us

Anything that gets in my way
(love, Hip Hop, Squaria's way)
Must be destroyed (3x)

[Verse 3:]
(You'll never stop me, I'm way too cocky and cool
I'm what all the kids want to be in school, school)
Until I beat you into submission
Defeat you and send you trippin'
And then they'll watch you lose, lose
(No sir, we taking this over, so become
One of us will get doomed, doomed)
I pulled out my sword
Then I jumped on my board
Screamed out "Flyborgs!"
Then boom boom

You'll never save it, I'll take you all with me

[Countdown]

[Outro 2x]
