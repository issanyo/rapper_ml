[Intro]
Yeah, it's all about you
One time
Is it all about you or is it all about you? (2x)
I...Fuck it (Unh)

[Verse 1]
See I gotta be this blunt (Unh)
Cause that's all that these chicks want
Hoff's never mixed up
Never diamond studded a wrist up
And get brunch, I hit three times an skipped lunch
You get once
Schoolboy gave me a little advice
"If you fucked her once, you can fuck her twice"
He forgot to tell me that these bitches fuck for hype
So get fucking paid and you can fuck all night
That's the recipe
Hope this tape don't make you think less of me
I said that to my baby girl especially
She said don't ever let the game get the best of me
So I've been holding back the album until they mess with me
Cause soon as I drop it they gon' Freshman me
Unless it mean a million dollar check to me, no sleep
Save the rest for you cause it's all about me
