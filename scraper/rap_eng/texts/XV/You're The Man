[Verse One]:
The plan was to knock me out the top of the game
Like, Tetris but the bottom remains
So I, exit the same way that I came
Repping, KS, niggas saying my name
X to the, V to the
Put that grimy hand away dawg I see through ya
Hear a lot of niggas talking, don't see doers
But in the end we all win, I don't see losers
So I don't label mates like postage
Only had dreams of seeing across the ocean
Hearing crowds screaming my name like "Oh shit."
This is how it goes when you know you work for it
Looking for my spot in this music business
But I can't call it like I don't have minutes
Niggas said they balling, I just started dribbling
Putting out Records like Guinness, I witnessed
People lose they mind in this business
And I was subpoenaed to testify
Saw the whole rap game through an extra eye
Saw the pain saw the niggas that was left to die
Like the people in the pictures of The Hall Of Fame
They all had to hang it up mayne
But 'til my time

[Hook]:
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man

[Verse Two]:
While I
Drop lines like a bad connection
I hope you get my message
Cause I'mma leave one like Mccallister's son on Home Alone, you guessed it
I'm home
Welcome mat, gets the dirt on my feet off
Welcome back, here's the word on the street Hoff
They all saying we need something to feed off
We gotta know what's going on with XV dawg
Mixed reviews of Complex got me teed off
Ignorant writers saying I'm from KC, nah
I ain't absorbed in myself, but I felt
Hip hop was lacking more of yourself
And they all jumped on my case
Complex has my voice, my thoughts, my face
So I invited all y'all to my place
You saw my block, Glocks on my waist
Gravity couldn't hold son down
So I left my dunce cap at home on this round
For those we told me dumb down
Blasphemy, I'm Charlie in the Chocolate Factory
I got to let off gas to come down
Hahah
And look at me now

[Hook]:
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
