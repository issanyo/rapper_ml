[Verse 1: XV]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Where niggas will big you up for a feature
When they all know they ain't fuck with you when you was a nobody
Before you blown, the cold shoulders they shown are hugs now that you know
Down the rabbit hole we go
Where hoes you know will call you out the blue
Asking how are you and telling you that you are to come over when you are open
Knowing last time they saw you not a single word was spoken
But down the rabbit hole we go
Where everyone got an opinion and you sit there and listen
They looking in your eyes but do not see your vision
They say they got your interest but who are you fucking kidding?
Down the rabbit hole we go
When they start to know who X is, I get emails from my exes
And my mom is feeling jaded ‘cause I can’t reply to texts
Don't know if I'm home or doing a show in Texas
Down the rabbit hole we go
Where failure is not an option ‘cause everybody is watching
I don't wanna be the topic of barber shop niggas talking
The vultures doing circles ‘cause the square got ‘em hawking now

[Hook]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Yeah, down the rabbit hole we go, uh

[Verse 2: XV]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Hold on to your seat cause it's gon be a bumpy road
Where your girlfriend wanna sleep and you just gotta up and go
The fast life got you addicted to something slow
Down the rabbit hole we go
Where everybody’s plotting and ain't no way to stop 'em
Your homeboys come around and you tell ‘em that you got 'em
Afraid of them thinking you just grew up and just forgot 'em
Down the rabbit hole we go
You like her and she like you but nothing ever grows
Cause she’s afraid of being another name that's in your phone
It’s sad when you're a choice and she would rather choose alone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Get used to your pictures, you know they'll always get ya
Especially when they jump off and a club chooses to kiss ya
Then they tag you on the Facebook
Now your girlfriend think you dissed her
Down the rabbit hole we go
You got time to sit and think when you in that window seat
Praying for your downfall soon as you reach your peak
So my eyes wide open, I don't even try to blink
Down the rabbit hole we go
You just hope the end is near soon, your life is like a clear room
Every hand shake and friendship is a career move
You feel yourself getting further from people that's near you
Down the rabbit hole we go
Take a pill to make you sleep, take a pill to make you go
Take a pill to make her freaky, take a pill to make you grow
Here’s a pill to hide the real and here’s a pill to make it known

[Hook 2]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Yeah, down the rabbit hole we go
Uh, down the rabbit hole we go
