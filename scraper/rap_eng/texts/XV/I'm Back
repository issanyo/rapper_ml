[Verse]
Back on steady living, niggas keep waiting for Complex
So I had to make another Definition
You know I kept writing
You know I kept on spitting
Sometimes freestyles, sometimes never written
Catch me at the mall girls say I look great
With the grape colored 'bopaye', "Hoe that's bape"
Out in Japan, this right here is a Bathing Ape
And it don't come out the cage till 2008
Y'all must be joking, Peter Pans fly, nigga Hoffa man is floating
See the G5 and I bet I'll get her open
Her and her four friends
All in the telly, you blowing the celly open
You kissing girls who swallow me down
You should follow me 'round, see all the towns I put my dick in
I don't care if it's been a year or a week
She try going for the lips I still aiming for her cheek
Haha
I'm just playing on the beat
Got a mainstream flow still I'm aiming for the street
From the streets to the station
Airways blazing
Give me five years I'm after the corporation
Niggas starting rumors about a label in the making
Get Down Or Lay Down is my niggas in the making
And everything is kinda shaping
Out for '06 to be the year that we make it
