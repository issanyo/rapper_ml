[Intro]
Cooler than your average bear with me
You know I got to the studio and I asked the beat if I was dope
You know what it said to me
What it say
Hahaha, yeah
Uh huh, so I heard you don't know my name

[Verse 1]
My name is Vizzy Vizzy Vizzy Vizzy, X to the V
And I am really really really really feelin' my steeze
What's the dilly silly willy
Is you up on these things
Cause I'm told I can't fold like the cuff on my jeans
They told me never, ever, ever give up on your dream
I tell 'em never, ever, ever will I do such a thing
I have high expectations, so the sky's where I'm facin'
Even broads that I'm datin', gotta succeed
You see I kinda kinda kinda never fit in the scene
The crowds thats in won't let me in
So I'm out of they ring
Not the hipsters, not the gangsters
Not the skaters, not the ballas
I'm an agoraphobic gamer
MySpace, a blogger
But I'm comin' comin' comin' comin'
Out for the night
And I'm up to somethin' somethin' somethin' somethin' flyer than rights
Brothers, colors as bright
Is that who I think it is
Tell the kids that they right

[Refrain]
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
They gonna, know my name
They gonna, know my name
What is it
Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Just call me. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Just call me. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Just call me. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V

[Verse 2]
Check it, check it, check it, check it, check me out
Put on my record, record, record, everytime I'm out
Everybody shout, if you know who I be
My name. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen here
I been gettin', gettin', gettin', gettin' this all year
Is it X five or 15? Check my description
I was gettin' creamy, like my krispy
Lil mama, mama, mama, come get wit me
Cause I'ma, I'ma, I'mma star make a wish when you see
And I'm the kid with the green
Backpack on my back, haters keep causing scenes
I'm tryna say it's a wrap
Now am I showing, showing, showing off
Cause I'm fly like going, going, going, going, gone
I'm just predicting the future
When all these hoes start sayin', oh what a super

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
My name's Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
I'm like the Jigga, Pac and Biggie of the city I keep
Who would think that the nerd at school
Would be a trendsetter and make a bunch of words sound cool
Absurd yet true, that you're that fool
That couldn't get a kick out of a circus mule
I don't need no hammer to make me hurt this tool
And I ain't Bruce Banner but I make green look cool
Read your manual
It's all automatic
I step up in the spot and drop like roger rabbit
It gets lonely at the top, I guess I'm an attic
Get it
I'm an attic in this haunted house of rappers
Down the hole with the rabbit like Alice
I wonder if the land where I land's got a palace
Cause I wasn't playin' when I was sayin'
I'm the king of the city
And my name is XV, but you can call me Vizzy

[Refrain]
