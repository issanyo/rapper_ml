[Intro] [XV talking]:
Vizzy! Nipsy Hussle just came through here so it's only right I do this
What up Johnny Shipes. Look

[Verse One]:
Uh
I'm from a planet full of Squarians
Landed here was raised by a bunch of barbarians
So I looked the code so my mode started varying
Flow is underground cause the bars that I was burying
Now I reach the surface
Here comes Ms. Jones
Waiting till she knows that I ain't into Marrying/Marion
Haha
But the track I still kill
Run the field but no steroid pills, ill
After my deal I'll travel to those peaks
Sitting in my throne feet lounging in your seat
So cool, L.A. weather is so sweet
With no crew, I'm too shallow to roll deep
That's why I only buy rides with two seats
Catch the X-Man in all blue, I'm like Beast
But I ain't banging like a Tweeter
When niggas still follow me like Twitter
With all things considered
Will you forfeit?
Vizzy whipping Porsche's
9-11 Turbo
No there's no horses
Call that my World Trade Center whip
Bitch, ain't it gorgeous?
X to the Vizzy, hot as ticky-ticky torches
No assembling of who Storm is
Normal dude but I put the "norm" in enormous
Still
Look at how they grill, hand me my Foreman
Flooring a Bugatti can't describe how I be soaring
Haha
Hot as the Human Torch
But even bum niggas sleeping, I'm a human porch
Say them other dudes is crack
But me, I'm Urkel
Cause I spit the lines that'll make you snort
That's dope
My raps bringing Inauguration Days
That's hope
I'm the penny y'all can't change
And that's broke
On that note, I'm seeing C's
You one letter behind cause you wouldn't B-elieve
My man Mike said, "Vizzy you mean."
So mean I make these kids play nice
Rewind the song back, um, let's say twice
I bet them A&R sharks will bite like Great Whites
There ain't a left field beat I can't slay right
There ain't a straight chick that I probably can't sway bi
Tell them niggas learn they vowels cause they can't say I
O/owe you/U a damn thing, I did this all on mine
Fine
Spit it damn proper
Hotter than some damn lava
I'm still the symbol of rap, like a band robber
I came with the heat and received no love
Until I flamed through the streets no Blood
All cause/cuz
I would bare it all on a track no hugs
I'm the answer to it all Slumdog got a buzz
I'm in your ear, long as I'm here I'm gonna stay
Giving y'all the heat with all the beats that I'm gonna flame
X to the V now you know the name
Vizzy!
