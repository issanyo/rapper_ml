[Hook: Nickelus F]
Look how I came around
Ain't nothing you can tell me
I had them hunger pains
Deep down in my belly
But see how I came up
I came up loud too hear my celly
Now they hate, they know I'm representing so they tell me
Young nigga shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on

[Verse 1: XV]
I'm in that 0-10, no one can see me cause it's just so tint
Fans trying to wave and they can't, that' insulting
All from a hair brain scheme like Zohan
Dig how this 15 year old kid has this whole plan
Say, "Don't take advantage" and I say, "I won't man"
Cause a high card can still end you up Lindsey Lohan
Damn
And because everybody doubted
When I finally made it I felt I had to shout it
Loudly
Got old girls looking on Facebook
Found me
Labels stopped sleeping on a nigga
Soundly
The way I run the track, why wouldn't these grey's hound me?
Models popping bottles saying, "Vizzy, pour this down me."
Ain't a bad kid but my mom said, "Stay grounded"
Now I miss that room I used to write in when I'm grounded
She looking for my red cape, hopefully she found it
So I can fly up out this bottle that I've looked down in

[Hook: Nickelus F]
Look how I came around
Ain't nothing you can tell me
I had them hunger pains
Deep down in my belly
But see how I came up
I came up loud too hear my celly
Now they hate, they know I'm representing so they tell me
Young nigga shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
