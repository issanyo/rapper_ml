[Hook]
I'm talkin' 'bout hoop dreams, hoop dreams
My nigga had hoop dreams, hoop dreams
Some niggas ball, some niggas shoot
When you from where I'm from, everybody wanna hoop
I'm talkin' 'bout

[Verse 1]
Dwayne Wayne to Dwyane Wade, fire on him
So hatin' niggas that ain't paid put fire on him
But he was USA Jordan, nine on him
The old heads he used to hoop with even tried to warn him
Not everbody gets those dreams
Even Ewing didn't get no ring
We see the beamers drive by and some guys won't get those keys and I
But we pray to Jesus Shuttlesworth we hit 'em threes
The dudes in his crew would move keys fast
But he passed like Steve Nash
'Til the day that he need cash
Then he has to start to say
Move dimes easy or make pennies the harder way
Like get a job today
He says that's too boring
I'm too broke to pay attention
I'm getting what I'm affording
And girls watch from the floor and recognize him from scoring
And rims on twenty-threes, now he's the new Jordan
With his

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Carry heat like Alonzo, a nine like you Rondo
Then you hit the block, Dikembe Mutombo
Flew to the top fast, now you gotta drive slow
Yao Ming out in Houston with yo eyes low
You shooting for racks on racks
Got dreams to be Kareem, then match the stats
I'm talking Bill Russell rings, back to back
No Toronto, but some niggas just rap to rap
Cause everybody can't ball and that's a fact
But I came with the Magic, Shaq attack
My OG told me, victory's so sweet
But not everything, that's a Phil Jackson chat
I'm talkin' Bulls verse Jazz, I captured that
Cause I take all of the glory these Caps could cap
Uh, my dudes ball, still out there shooting
Funny thing is none of them were hooping
But they had

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Because the streets is a short stop:
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
