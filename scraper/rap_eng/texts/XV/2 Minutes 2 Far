[Verse One] [XV]:
Sometimes it just gets too much
When your Ipod is the only thing you Touch
Telling my mom "Nah, I can not do lunch"
It's sad but it's true when you live like such
I don't wanna say that my life sucks
Cause I could wake up and sleep what ever time I want
But I don't sleep
Cause I heard about a cousin
And at this point I don't wanna have that discussion
So I'm living high on a plane zipping by
Sitting back when I was dissing people and they silly lives
I can go back to when I wasn't getting by
Had the whole McDonalds menu memorized
I remember I
Was a little guy
Getting pushed around, now they wanna be friends of mine
Sometimes I go on vaca in my mind
There's a place I can go away anytime

[Hook] [Zoot Woman]:
Cause it's a holiday home
Two minutes too far away
What can you tell the other one?
Dirty fiction can you call my name?

[Verse Two] [XV]:
See, I've had enough Thundercat hoes, now where's my lioness?
Like Cheetara she keeping up with my flyness
Don't smoke weed but they call me, "Your highness"
Non-fast niggas wanna roll like tires
They like, "Your car should be the fliest"
Why's that?
It ain't like I drive it
I don't know, that's just how I react
Mom think I'm an agoraphobia insomniac
Haha
Big words, I should've went to Pratt
Working on my first album, I never went to class
I tell ya
I should have been a bank teller
How I got money sitting on my ass
Cause then the music started picking up awfully fast
And if I wanna have a future I can't let that pass
Girls say I look like Buddy Holly
Prolly, but all the commotion make me wanna just crash

[Hook] [Zoot Woman]:

[Verse Three] [XV]:
Trying to be able to get a stable full of horses
Ferrari's, Mustang's and Porsche's
Red carpet model chick looks so gorgeous
Make sure we get it as a portrait
Flick
Gotta get a pic cause I never go out
Only roll with a clique/click when I'm using my mouse
Cause I'm always in the stu
Shut the booth for a room filled with video games or a Play.Net zoom
Soon
I'mma get me a house
Inside of my mind I can tune it all out
Haha
A little place I can go to
When I don't wanna be so vocal
Assembly required but no Pro-Tools
And taking it higher only got me hopeful
So when the home inside of my dome is local
Don't think I went loco
