[Intro: Al Green]
Lookin' out my window, sun shinin' bright
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
I've got good music on my radio
How did your love songs play from those doors?

[Verse 1: XV]
This hotel's sweetest suite but you don't know about it
I might even be petty and bring your ho around it
Like my first name, Tom, but this Don
Still known for making my space on the planet I'm on
I take all of my dogs and give'em a roof
Then get to the top and do'em like Bishop in Juice
Don't go and get it confused, them niggas'll do it to you
Ask AZ, Rich, and Po, that shit is the truth
People have critical roles of putting kings on the throne
In general, I felt like I was Caesar in Rome
They said "Vizzy rep your city, go and make this place known"
And I delivered like the mailman, Karl Malone
Now, welcome, welcome home on that brick of yellow roads
Get your tele-telephone, go and tell'em that I'm on
Smelling like success and it gels with my cologne
But I wish that you was here to inhale it on your own

[Hook: XV](2x)
Praying I don't want to go and hoping Death hears
Gotta feeling my prayers is falling on death ears
Poppin' bottles everyday until I get there
Pouring liquor for niggas, I wish was still here

[Bridge: Al Green]
I've got to stop, get myself together
Cause all I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here
I just wish you were here with me
Yeah!

[Verse 2: XV]
Where do I start in this art, that's got so dark
For I embark for these charts, let me depart
From my heart and do these old niggas so harsh
But that's just the half of my war path
Kill'em now, cry later, I rhyme greater
L7 creator, you became a fucking traitor
You never threw that sign up
Wait hold that, let me go back, just try to remind ya
There's no Kodaks, you can show that fucker
Flow Heaven sent, so why so devilish?
In this dark room, gettin' images off of negatives
Vibes off of rhymes, all of this anger inside
Cage in like a lion, I'm a danger outside
But I'm maintaining my pride, so I look wild for that
So I'm the one shooting in shock cause they don't hear those laughs
Always the one giving his heart, that'll never get back
New crib, they don't know where the kid at
I wish that you was here

[Hook](2x)
