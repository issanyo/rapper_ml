[Verse]:
Everybody follow me, hollowly, thoroughly see
And check my kick game out like Greensboro police
I'm standing on a stack of dollars when I walk on my feet
People driving, riding by are doing circles to see
Yes those are dunks on my feet
And they are purple and green
Don't take them Jordan XQ's out unless an emergency
And as we turn to the right, you see those babs in that light?
Those are the type you need a pocket translator to buy
And haters hate that I'm fly
They like Lex Luther
The prices hit 'em in the head like King Koopa
But when I walk in my shoes, think I was Mario 2
Cause when they see him they say, "Dang mayne. That's Super."
Flyboy Vizzy
On to be a rap ruler
But now it's hard to blow like Bazooka
Joe
I can't call it man
So check, like a pair of Forces man
Puba A Lifes, Jordan Mars' black list
Where's your pen and paper at?
I'm giving y'all classics
Unless you don't wanna be fly like John Madden
Then we'll continue with the tour
Make sure y'all fasten
In
