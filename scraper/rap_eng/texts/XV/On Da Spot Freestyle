[Verse 1: XV]
Why wouldn't we? Why wouldn't we?
Light it up and let it burn
Usher in the new regime
Ten thousands hands was up
That's the stuff you should've seen
If you hustled half as much
I am what you could've been
Never played with keys, only piano
They pussies on your team, Tony Soprano
Homie, I'm cool and only one fan on
You trying to turn on the AC like Jessica Spano
You get it spit on like camels
Spat on, that's plural, I just go through portals
And combat with the mortals, and you can't come
Liu Kang flow, where that flame from
Search the world for competition feeling like I'm Shang Tsung
Nothing changed but the games in my selection
And ladies in my section who came for my erection
And of all'em is bad, off the wall in my villa
Nine joints, they all singled, must be Thriller
Her man look like Ben Stiller, so you know I been stole her
Once we come through that the the door
Take your dame, no noter
And cutting off them lights like some jankey ass promoters man
I'm up in this game like Duke Nukem
Facebook friends, refuse'em
Trying to be my friend, I facebook refuse them
I took them hah's and don't do's, turn them hadukens
My's moms losing her mind, but I count on her like calculators
Whiles haters acting like they challengers
With no soul even close to my calibur/caliber
Better leave son alone like the McCallisters
Never was so hood
Hung with wrong niggas like Rosewood
All bad, we up to no good
While niggas had hopes of reaching the peaks that mountains do
But his dreams couldn't do what coke could
Even my teachers found me funny
"Be realistic", I said "no ma'am" Al Bundy
Now I'm frontin' with a bed full of hunnies
And ain't to late to do what you want, so if you coming
This the Squarian movement, what the fuck you do with
Anything you give me? It's the muthafucking music
X to the V, invasion and I do this
