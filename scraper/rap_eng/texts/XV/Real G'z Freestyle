Move over, it's hard for no niggas don't know me
?, you know me
The hustler of the hood got the whole city smoking
Best unsigned producer, niggas think Vizzy joking
24 hours on the block, is he open
I'm sticking ? up to break miss piggy open
Clicky clank piggy-bank jack pot open up
Can't hear the ? all my whips are banging ?
Hit the block had the heads turning in to coconuts
Dawn's here, lawn chair, niggas get to folding up
On the time, on the grind, please get out your Folger's cups
One hit and quit it, nigga, tell someone to hold 'em up
Niggas wanna get street, I give 'em the flow
Niggas wanna get heat, I'mma give 'em the stove
Niggas wanna bust a rhyme, I'mma give 'em some mo'
Hells kid you when I'm spitting, I can live for the flow
