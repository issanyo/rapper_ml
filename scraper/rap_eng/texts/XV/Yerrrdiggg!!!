[Sample from Digable Planet's 'Cool Like Dat]
"We be to rap what key be to lock"

[Intro] [XV talking]:
Let's take 'em on back real quick. Yeah, no bullshit, I had a crush on ole' girl from this group. Ladybug Mecca. Then I saw her in that Snoop video?! Ooooh! Holla at me baby. Let's do it. See, I want y'all to stop calling me King Of The City. Now, I want y'all to call me Key Of The City. Yerrrdiggg? I'm about to unlock the game for us yo. Hate it or love it it's the definition of it

[Verse One]:
See we be to rap what key be to lock
Or more like streets be to blocks
He seems like he'd be so hot
But he dropped and we all seen he seemed to flop
Like flip
Can't get fresh unless your V's next to X, can't cop what I cop
He's Next
Like R.L
Who's next to blow? I'll let y'all tell
Our favorite rappers is getting old
And those that think will blow, come out and do not sell
They lucky to be even going gold
With they million ring tones, but they next album gets shelved
Watch material
Cats ain't original
Even niggas trying to get fresh starting to get stale
I don't gotta eat pasta to spit shells
I'm sick, I'll probably never get well

[Chorus]:
Yerrrdiggg?!
Like that?
Tell the people that Hoffa man is back
Yerrrdiggg?!
Like that?
Tell the people that Hoffa man is back
Yerrrdiggg?!
Like that?
Tell the people that Hoffa man is back
Yerrrdiggg?!
Like that?
Tell the people that Hoffa man is back

[Verse Two]:
See we be to rap what key be to lock
Or more like keys be to pots
That's crack, definition of it
Meth do the cover and we send it on the block
Out in NY after Complex dropped
Atlantic said, "It's cool."
Warner Brothers said, "It's hot."
TVT said, "Nah man. That shit don't knock."
Then I looked at they roster to see who they got
Oh, I forgot
Plus they wanted Mims, so that's all I really had to know about them
Kept writing dropped more, then toured, got bored
Took a break, in a week back to the drawing board
And everybody has something to say
Spit hard or just go away
I ain't wrestling with you niggas anyway
So ? yourself and have a nice day

[Chorus]:
Yerrrdiggg?!
Like that?
Tell the people that Hoffa man is back
Yerrrdiggg?!
Like that?
Tell the people that Hoffa man is back
Yerrrdiggg?!
Like that?
Tell the people that Hoffa man is back
Yerrrdiggg?!
Like that?
Tell the people that Hoffa man is back
