[Intro] [XV Talking]:
Haha. I played this for Seven, he was like, "Man, that sounds like some Sesame Street reading hour shit." And I was like, "Yeah...it kinda does."

[Verse One]:
If God said this
"I'ma take away your greatest gift."
What would you ask to exchange it with?
It's easy for me cause if he took away the rapping
I would like to draw, all that I imagine
I wish that I could just pick up a pencil and draw
But I can't
Fuck, I can barely stencil at all
I would graffiti X to the Vizzy all over walls
Put my gamer tag on trains that pass by city hall
I would draw the colors I see when I sing my favorite song
By my favorite artist
Man, I would be your favorite artist if I drew
If I knew
How to make this green turn to blue
Or how to make this scene turn into
The dreams that I see when I think of a view
Of a room with a grey gradient hue
Or maybe I could do
Comic books with heroes that look like you
Squares that look like me
Damn that would be cool

Wouldn't it?

[Hook]:
I'd probably put the mic down
If I could draw
This song would have a painting right now
If I could draw
Sometimes I wish that I could find out
If I could draw
And then I wouldn't have to rhyme 'bout
If I could draw
I'd probably put the mic down
If I could draw
This song would have a painting right now
If I could draw
Sometimes I wish that I could find out
If I could draw
And then I wouldn't have to rhyme 'bout
If I could draw

[Verse Two]:
If I could draw man, I'd probably be romantic
Have girls posing while I draw 'em like Titanic
Design my own city at the bottom of thee Atlantic
That's big Vizzy
Hahaha
I played a lot of SimCity
I would draw the next Sin City
I would draw fat versions of all my school crushes that just dissed me
I would draw an ugly girl pretty
To show her what I see
Inside, she'd find it so witty
Hip hop ain't died, but it's like it's so empty
And that's why I think the sky sent me
I would draw a perfect world and a perfect girl that just digs me
If that was the one gift God gives me
But He didn't
I was made for spitting these lyrics while I'm still living
I'm XV but Donovan is who I'm always given
So I can stay spitting this rhyme and just wishing
Or I can fill these lines up in my composition
To show my vision
Damn

[Hook]:
I'd probably put the mic down
If I could draw
This song would have a painting right now
If I could draw
Sometimes I wish that I could find out
If I could draw
And then I wouldn't have to rhyme 'bout
If I could draw
I'd probably put the mic down
If I could draw
This song would have a painting right now
If I could draw
Sometimes I wish that I could find out
If I could draw
And then I wouldn't have to rhyme 'bout
If I could draw
