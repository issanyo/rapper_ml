[Verse- JMIC]

Whats up Gudda Gudda?
How the fucks it going?
Whats up XV?
I hear the money's flowing
I Got the burbs on lock
Me and a couple homies
Chillin with some bad bitches
And yeah we're puffin smokin
I'm not fuckin joking
I pledge to keep it real
Motherfuck the phonies wit a sharp ass piece of steal
I'm out here ducking police
About that cheese for real
And I ain't gonna stop until I see at least a mil
Gonna get um wit a little bit of
I dont even know what to call it
But this shit be fuckin bouncin like I wrote in hydrolics
Is it me or could be that I've been smoking the cronic?
IDK but my flow will leave the microphone polished
W-w-w-whip it then wash it
This little white kid is moppin
Every rapper hes on a track with its exciting to watch it
So get to writing and blogging
Homie this might happen often
Put your money up now before the prices skyrocket

[Hook- Gudda Gudda]

Okay the money in my levis
Stack my paper tree high
I been doin this shit as a youngin, knee high
You gon need your glasses or your contacts just to see I
Everytime you see me my I eyes squitin cause I be high
I Get it!

[Verse- XV]

I go in
I swag out
Ball with all bags out
I dealed but then I cashed out
Pour up then I pass out
Niggas think they flashy
Till I know they flash out
Pockets fat but I do a show and get paid flat out
Now ain't that an amazin idea?
Behind the wheel like feris with some girls in the rear
My nigga JMIC ridin shot gun
With a couple hot ones
In the back seat and they blowin each other shot guns
Honey wants a ring
So she gettin in the Audi
Oh my are we high or is the sky just cloudy?
I stretch out on the couch
Like I'm in counsling
Then watch her hit the pole like a nigga is josting
Dark hoarse, white night
Dim niggas ain't bright lights
Killin this shit from hindsight
Light up the pen like light bright
All of my niggas is ballin my nigga
And all of my bitches are dime type
Look at life like all of this is mine right?
I'm like..

[Verse- JMIC]

You have not see nothing yet
I'm warming up let me fucking stretch
Not even playing yet, I'm not even playing yet
Bout to run a warm up lap and probably won't break a sweat
While I'm jogging
You should be blogging
Telling all these other rappers JMIC is a problem
Get it through your noggin
I have reached another level chillin on a rpstrum
Man this shit is awesome
One right move and I'm off the bench ballin
If rap is a game I'm certainly playing offense
The song is a track and my competition stallin
I'm switchin into second gear, Take a shot of everclear
Then cut off my competitors
I was revin my engine but you mothafuckas never hear
You all must have severed ears
But if you been following my I know you see progression here
As you will every year from now until forever dear
And ima continue to do what I do
Until all of the cheddars here
