[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Fast lane, looking bad thang with them brains
From the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I’m high as God
Why is it Lord that I can’t seem to slow the whip down?
The same boy standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don’t follow rules
Carter blues, nigga hold up, y’all still don’t got a clue
Yeah, all the cool niggas from high school that still ain’t doing shit
‘Member when y’all used to fuck niggas till they blue and shit?
Now your ass broke as a joke and them niggas doing it
Funny how the tables turned and life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy ‘less he need a dollar from his baby mama
And y’all still don’t wear a condom, is you stupid nigga?
Falling in love with these hoes, is you Cupid nigga?
You better learn ‘fore you burn boy, see me stay on top of my game, David Stern boy
Did this dirt like worms, now my mom was more concerned with the future
Y’all niggas stuck in neutral, this a city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya, I’m here to get ya higher baby so this here the booster
I’m tryna be the king, this that Martin Luther
Shit is crucial, now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ‘Ville, still pourin' liquor ‘fore my niggas killed

[Verse 2: XV]
Look, it’s too bad that he’s too good
Never giving up but it’s sad that you would
My crew like a couple of clansmen, too hood
And when it came to putting on Kansas, who would?
Vizzy, no trying, couple figures on and I’m sitting on Bryants
Game started buzzing so I’m sitting on hydrants
Nah Joe, I’m highjack, you can call me a Somali pirate
All black wallet, inside Irish, mean it’s all green
Yeah, I’m mean with this fly shit, they buzzing like bees in a high nest
Girls getting on they knees for your highness
And I’m running these streets, no bright vest
Stick to the paper, damn, I’m a fly catch
I’m tryna live more, die less and if you tryna get yours, holla X, XV
You should OD off of this rhyme ‘cause I’mma change minds like cold feet
In store for a meal, groceries but they be like “We don’t normally come out at night mostly”
Go and get your rosaries ‘cause I’m about kill this, no halo like Sony
And if your girl a little horse like a pony, ahem, well of course, start pointing
Fly Boy Club, well of course I’m soaring, always gonna
Always be in the air like Jordan
And they always gonna stare, just ignore ‘em
Now you with the X man, I’mma call you Storm
I’m touring her, under that hood and um it’s foreign up under that hood and um
I feel like a dude this cool should feel so I guess I feel good and um XV, J.Cole, we in

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Busting, I'm going off, sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me, these hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club, you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God but to me, she found Satan
She only getting hotter, what's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said “That's cool nigga but can you buy the Benz?”
She playing niggas like a violin, I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day’s found, this is my playground

[Verse 4: XV]
Look, I’mma spit it from the top of the dome, don’t normally do this
But I’m feeling real cool, I am ruthless, like Eazy-E was, I am toothless
Like that one fiend was, I am killing shit like I never do this
I never do this but I’m gonna spit it straight from the top oh
And I know niggas done heard about Kansas but I’m about to do this motherfucker
I done ran shit since ‘02 and I was like oh and y’all niggas don’t know
I’m about to prove man what everything that I’m doing is about to do a movement
X to the V, who you booing? Look, I don’t even do this normally but I’mma do this
Accordingly, cordially, I am dope, yes dude
I have never wrote this shit down in my head
I have spoke shit you that never ever said
‘Cause I’m dope, y’all niggas dead, fresh, chill nigga, I am gonna get this
X to the V, y’all niggas witness, I’m about to throw ‘em back, ruler this
Y’all niggas doing this, y’all niggas know that I’m moving shit
And if you don’t know it right now, google it, I’m about to be on every blog
Doing shit, I’m about to do this shit like E told me do, look, look, I don’t know

[Verse 5: J.Cole]
What do I gotta do to prove to you I’m not the dude for you to just try to fool with?
Niggas ain’t got a clue bitch, niggas wanna bullshit
Don’t know that my crew thicker than these cute bitches, we normally knocking boots with
Too slick to grip, my nigga should stop that
That verse was so old that I done forgot that
But now I come off the top with the hot raps
Niggas know you better stop that
Coming through, got the Glock cocked back
Nigga I ain’t even got one
Nigga, I’m aiming at your face with the shotgun
Lyrically, spiritually
Niggas tryna mirror me but I’m vampire and I’m so damn higher than the average nigga
Can you get witcha ya? I just signed with Jigga, nigga how high you figure?
Damn, I’m slipping up on my words but my verbs so sick that I never slip
Niggas know uh-uh, please save me XV

[Verse 6: XV]
They be like Vizzy on some other shit, on his MCDs ‘cause they loving it
Pockets fat like the Klumps in it, my flow is something sick, no asking
Proactive couldn’t stop bumping it, nowadays I be on some other shit
Ladies think I’m gone kinda like my upper lip, wrong
Like a broken condom, pause, ‘cause Hoff go raw
It’s something you really shouldn’t be fucking with
Came through whipping, paint still dripping
They say like Sheneneh, oh no you didn’t
Know that one saying when your palm start itching?
Well mine do some much, I had to start to wear mittens
And you think that I’m kidding, if I don’t slow down
They gon’ think that I’m driven, if I don’t go down, she gon’ think I hate fishing
Chill for a minute and I was like listen, Vizzy, gettin’, gettin’, gettin’
Y’all motherfuckers know I’m about to spit it straight up off the top of the dome again
How this nigga doing that? He be going in, I don’t even know shit
I be just blowing shit, I don’t even smoke and shit, how you know this?
By enrolling it, I don’t even know I got a backpack on
If you see me, take a flick of me and you niggas gonna blow the shit
‘Cause you were pointing at me like he gonna blow and shit
And them niggas be knowing it, if I be doing this shit all around the world and shit
All around the globe with it, man y’all niggas spit it in, I just get it in
Flow out here and manager from Switzerland, nigga from Kansas
And y’all niggas whipping it, how you motherfuckers doing it?
