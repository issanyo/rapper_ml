[Intro] [Seven talking]:
1, 2, 3, 4 oh! I'm not even going to say it. For real there wasn't enough time right there. It's XV and Seven. You know X, he's the rapper. I'm the DJ. For real like, I'm not a DJ though I can't DJ. You know like, he's the cool one. I'm the nerd. Basement nerd. Make all these beats. Let's go, X

[Verse One]:
Sitting in the booth, don't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Instead I stole a Nas line
So I'm focused, I write whatever comes to my mind aiight?
Never forced to go and hustle
Never really struggle
And momma did what she could
It was just the allure of the life
Drug deals, shaved dice, thug ills, late night
Up in the hood
Although I had dreams that I never told the team
Cause I knew it was something they never understood
I wanted to rap so I did it in the back
But I never let 'em hear cause I wasn't that good
At times I just wanted to get away
From all that I chase
Grab a pen and just drift away
Say things that I couldn't say
Stayed in the clouds
I'll have frequent flier miles by the time I come down
Now

[Verse Two]:
Momma used to say I had A.D.D
So I learned J.D.F. before my A.B.C.s
I was no dummy but I fooled around like a clown
With that added you see my absence from that cap and that gown
Now
I'm 'bout to be
Feeling like Charlie and The Chocolate Factory
I don't wanna come down
If it's the gene's that I get from my pops
That dreams I'll probably seem that I'm headed for the clouds
Do I give off, the fact I drift off, before I lift off?
Cause if it was all in my reach with one blink I would miss y'all
Rolled with niggas who kept them loaded automatics
Tucked in their khakis, no baddies, smoked fatties and used to Crip Walk
Placed a mansion picture on the ceiling of my room
That I will be building soon if this album really gets far
And if nah, then I'm headed for the clouds
Dreaming till I choose to come down
Now
