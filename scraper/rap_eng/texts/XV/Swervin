Chorus
Rubber burning, burning I been drinking all night now I'm swervin', swervin'
Damn her body's bad and it's curving, curving Trying to take her home but I'm swervin', swervin' (Drink got me swervin')
Rubber burning, burning I been drinking all night now I'm swervin', swervin'
Damn her body bad and it's curving, curving Trying to take her home but I'm swervin', swervin' (Drink got me swervin')

Verse 1
What a life of ours, nights are scarred but where's the pain go?
Prolly in the same glass that this fucking drink go
Now I'm on the road, trying to find out where the lanes go
I dont even know, I-I-I-I dont even know
And I dont really smoke but this was just one of those days yo
Pop in my favorite CD and let that whole shit play through
Now I'm thinking this the type of shit that I should drink to
Pour me up some mo, P-P-Pour me up some mo

Chorus x2

Verse 2:
How did I get here I swear this shit dont even seem right
Swervin lanes and hit the left I can't even see right
Tell me wheres the street lights, wait is that a green light?
I dont even know, I-I-I- dont even know
The night was filled with life, but my glass was always empty
Bunch of ladies on me, all my niggas with me
Making more toast than a 3am at a Denny's
Pour me up some mo, P-P-Pour me up some mo
Bottles lifted we drinking so much it's like the bottoms endless
Rubberbands with dollars in it, fat wallets with condoms in it
Nothing but money and time and fine women who wanna spend it
I just hope you ready if you coming with us
Cause I'm...

Chorus x2

Verse 3:
Im just cruising down an open road on a night in Houston
Shorty riding titties popping out like-like the eye of Houston
Got me swerving lanes, al-alcohol is not influenced
Maybe so but the 5-0 still gotta prove it
Til then I turn up that music-music do not touch my tuner
Sometimes pop it up but I'm soaring like some fucking bruises
Black Eyed Peas, no Fergie, and Im rolling deep as Xerxes
Don't get worried when you observing me swervin

Chorus x 2
