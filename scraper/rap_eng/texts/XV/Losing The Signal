[Verse One] [XV]:
Picked up the phone and I dialed the request line
"DJ, can I hear my favorite song one last time?"
I gotta hear John Mayer's "Bigger than My Body" cause
I'm probably leaving after this one song
Tell Mommy that I'm gone
Got things I gotta fulfill
She wants me to go to college, I promise her that I will
As I hop onto my bike prepared to ride the streets alone
Don't know what I'm out to find, you need me then text my phone
But you know that I'm gone

[Hook] [Jupiter One]:
Gone
In my mind, I have to leave the world behind
Either way, I'll see you all another day
And the reason is I'm losing the signal, oh no
And what I wonder is, are you losing my signal?

[Verse Two] [Jupiter One]:
You can find a star with it
We're riding with the wind at a mile a minute
Taking off for all being all we can be
Sailing on the sea in a picture fantasy
Do you see me?
I'm a symbol for the kind and the carefree
I'm riding on the wind there, pushing all my limbs where
Being close to God is my only sin

[XV]:
On my bike pedalin'
Arms stretched out so I can feel the wind
I always find something I can meddle in
Because an idle mind only lets the devil in
So many closed minds to get jailed up in
So many broke kites I would mail to friends
It was a dream on a TV screen
That MTV would sell to you
I guess I wanted to end it when they all said I was a loser
Though I wish to avow my past, I'm looking forward to the future
My neighbors saw the movers, asked me where I planned to go
Then I pointed at the stars and said I haven't really chose
But I know that I gotta leave the comfort of my home
Only way I'll turn this old recliner into a new throne
As I hop onto my bike prepared to ride the streets alone
Don't know what I'm out to find, you need me then text my phone
Cause I'm gone

[Hook] [Jupiter One]:
Gone
In my mind, I have to leave the world behind
Either way, I'll see you all another day
And the reason is I'm losing the signal, oh no
And what I wonder is, are you losing my signal?

[Verse Three] [XV]:
Nostalgic thoughts I have of Legos and Eggos
And the moment I rolled with friends my mom said was ghetto
They were all in a gang, I figured I'd do the same
See, I grew up in the zoo, they knew I couldn't be tamed
See, my pops, he was a cheatah, so the chickens he was eyeing
Moms went apeshit when she couldn't bear with his lying/lion
I kept trying and trying calling but no one was home
So I went out on the streets, I'll call when I reach a phone
Because I'm gone

[Hook] [Jupiter One]:
Gone
In my mind, I have to leave the world behind
Either way, I'll see you all another day
And the reason is I'm losing the signal, oh no
And what I wonder is, are you losing my signal?
