[Intro: DJ Enuff & XV]
XV, DJ Enuff (Swiff D)
We up in here!
Kansas, Wichita, New York
Let's do it

Never enough, no, it's never enough
Never enough, no, it's never enough
Never enough

[Verse 1: XV]
I've had enough of the game, I've had enough of the fame
Had enough of the fake shit, enough of the lames
Not enough of the love but enough of the pain
Cause it's never enough, no, it's never enough

I've had enough of these snakes, I've had enough of these smiles
Had enough of these tapes, I've had enough freestyles
Had enough of these dates, had enough being wild
But it's never enough, no, it's never enough

Never enough of the dro, never enough of a drank
But had enough of the hoes, don't give a fuck what they think
Gettin' Will Smith O's, enough to fill up a bank
But it's never enough, no, it's never enough

I had enough of the tweets, had enough of the vines
Had enough of the people just sayin' stuff on they mind
I've had enough of the hustle, had enough of the grind
But it's never enough, no, it's never enough

There year was not '97, more like July '09
Was heating up for a second, after I gave Cole lines
Had enough of my mind and then Enuff helped me shine
To show it's never enough, yeah, it's never enough

Then I couldn't get enough of hearing "Can't Get Enough"
And my label had that face like when you can't get it up
So I gave them Zero Heroes, end up banging my stuff
But it's never enough, no, it's never enough

Had enough push backs, I've had enough countdowns
Enough of the waiting, can't 2015 be now?
They think I got enough fans that's ready and down
But it's never enough, no, it's never enough

I've had enough of the work, never enough free time
Enough to drive me berserk, enough to go out my mind
But you support me enough to put my life in my rhymes
That's why it's never enough, no, it's never enough
Let's go

[Outro: DJ Enuff & XV]
Yo, this DJ Enuff
XV, the next big thing
In Hip Hop

Cause it's never enough, no, it's never enough
