[Verse One]:
Well
It's X to the V my alias is Midas
Nah, call me Titus or Leonidas
Ha, I don't write this, I recite this
Straight from the head, no pen, no Sidekick
And I don't gotta be no psychic
To know that I'm gonna stay around like a ficus
Flow about as cold as a Russian sniper
With nothing to lose like a life at Rikers
24-7-366 be clear
I grind so hard I leap over the Leap Year
Hold the phones I can tell 'em all to show
Cause XV's here
Y'all hear?

[Verse Two]:
Y'all know that I drop countless heat
So why the hell y'all still counting sheep?
These other rappers bore and I'm sound asleep
Where the hell's your energy? Y'all sound asleep
You bore me in your verses, I'm sleeping on a beat
I'm snoring on the chorus like I'm awaiting a T
You couldn't get a buzz if I made you a beat
Couldn't come after X if I made you a Z
HiphopDX said Complex was weak
And I got my game that very same week
Volume 2 dropped that very same month
And I closed the mouths of those very same punks
Rappers ain't snacks they everyday lunch
Even though they biting I tell 'em they suck
Try to bring me down and I tell you what's up
Drag me on the ground like Snuffleupagus trunk
Pick 'em up, let that man shine
Cause I'm the bomb like a lawn full of land mines
You know what time it is? That's a damn lie
(Why?)
Cause I travel on Japan time
