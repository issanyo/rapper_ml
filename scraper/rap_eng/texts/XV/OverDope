[Intro]
(Overdope)
Yeah (overdope, overdope)
Overdope (overdope, overdope)
Dope (overdope, overdope, overdope)

[Hook](2x)
Overcome all the obstacles, override all the codes
Go overdrive on the road and overtime on the flow
They'll overdose on the dope
Overdose on the dope
I bet they'll overdose on the dope

[Verse 1]
Who ordered these bottles man? Who ordered these shots?
And who told all these models we was them niggas to watch?
Heard the label was stressin', asking about my direction
I raised my middle finger up and point it right at the top
Hollywood chick in the ride off of the scripts that I jot
But the hips and the thighs only thicken the plot
I know niggas whisper a lot and send me a shot
Be in the club giving me props and sending me shots
Nights I wake up to hoes I barely know at all
Aphrodisiacs after shows leave them hoes in awe
Some body's don't show a flaw, aww, what a work of art?
With the brain of a pigeon and a serpent's heart, unh
Everything I say, I know you quote
Live a life that a person who writes wish he wrote
I'm over being the underdog, that's over bro
Cause if they wrote what I wrote, they probably overdope

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Overdope, you have this much juice, you overflow
You spit this much truth it's overblown
But I was overhead 'til my overhead started to overgrow
Dispose of the older heads, kings get overthrown
Oversleeping on the L7 overlord
Backpack over the shoulder, same color as Yoda's sword
I watch friendships sink when it goes overboard
And underworlds take over when cats is over bored
And over do it, to show and prove it, they over lines
My younger brother doing ten, that nigga overtime
Should've been overprotected
Too busy trying to heat myself up, they still overdressing
Damn! Unh
Everything I say, I know you quote
Live a life that a person who writes wish he wrote
Being the underdog, that's over bro
Cause if they wrote what I wrote, you probably overdope

[Hook]
