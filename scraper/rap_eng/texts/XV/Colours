[Verse One] [XV]:
See I rock teal, pink and purple
If you blink you'll think I'm Urkel
She said, "I'll tell you my number."
Now the square is in her circle
Black and white from front to back
Looks like Spy Vs Spy on Mad
Fuck them D's that's the past
Throw Some colors on that ass

[Calvin Harris]:
Now I don't care what you dress like
Or what you wear
But please make sure baby
You've got some colours in there
Now it's all very well stepping out in black and white
But you're no girlfriend of mine
If you're doing that right

[Hook]:
[XV]:
So what you tell her Cal?
[Calvin Harris]:
Get some colours on
[XV]:
So what you tell her Cal?
[Calvin Harris]:
Get some colours on

[Verse Two] [XV]:
See I don't care if it's retro or sexual
As long as it's green, pink or yellow, I'm set bro
She had a Fuchsia thong on her waist with the strap showing
With light pink mac on
Them the girls that attract on me
Be like Martin, girl what's up?!
Got that spandex on her butt
Undershirt under a long sleeve tee that is just all cut up
On my grizzily in doing me
Accordingly
Cordially, I hope she's more like M.I.A. then Kimora Lee
No disrespect, that's all I need

[Hook]:
[Calvin Harris]:
Get some colours on

[XV]:
That's what I told her

[Calvin Harris]:
Get some colours on
