[XV talking]:
Yeah, this is me man
This is just me
I'm just a boy from Kansas
Been all around the world
Seen different things, you know
But this is me

[Verse One]:
I don't drink or smoke, I do my thing
I just do my songs, make my beats
I just roll with my dogs, keep my peace
But if y'all want beef I keep my peice
I don't club too much I stay at home
I like to cruise a lot, don't answer the phone
I got my girl wifed up don't need no more
I might not live too long I see the globe
I'm humble and cool ask my dudes
Like Sez and Bling, Ace and Dubes
Or Stringer and Block, 7 and Bounce
Or haters that know me around the town
I'm king of the city I made that crown
So if you want one we can battle it out
I have a lot to say so I stay with the pen
You can break it down in the end

[Hook]:
I'm just a boy from Kansas
No matter where you go don't forget where you come from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
When the heart is in your home you know that's where you from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
You went all around the globe but you know that's where you from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
You're still that boy from Kansas just tell 'em where you're from

[Verse Two]:
I like oldies and rap, Benzes and 'Lacs
I got homies who work, homies who trap
I done did both won't never go back
I love spitting giving you my picture through tracks
I'm a city boy from the ICT
Don't confuse it with the country homie come and see
We the middle of the map figure cause I rap like
East coast west coast bring it all back
I like Air Force 1s, Bapes is cool
I like Chuck Taylors or some skater shoes
You like this dude seem hella confused
Nah homie that's just how I do
You never knew
I'm complex
I went to black and white schools
Took a little from the bad, took a little from the good
Took white people had brought it back to the hood
I'm sorry if I'm misunderstood

[Hook]:
I'm just a boy from Kansas
No matter where you go don't forget where you come from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
When the heart is in your home you know that's where you from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
You went all around the globe but you know that's where you from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
You're still that boy from Kansas just tell 'em where you're from

[Verse Three]:
You can catch me on the block with my crew
If I'm not posted I'll be driving on through
Chucking the deuces up with Crips and Bloods
Folks, whoever homie I show everyone love
Holla if you see me on your block if you see me on the grind
Just throw the boy a sign holla at me man
If I'm rolling through your city and you see the boy busy
As long as I look fly take a flick mayne
I don't do much fam
I don't skate but I dress like a skater that's just who I am
I still rep for my D-Boys moving grams
And all white like the Klu Klux Klan
We rock whatever's hot it come through the middle
I'mma make the game take a break for the middle
If I was to die how would you describe me
This here is X to the V
I'm just a boy from Kansas

[Hook]:
No matter where you go don't forget where you come from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
When the heart is in your home you know that's where you from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
You went all around the globe but you know that's where you from
I'm just a boy from Kansas
You're still that boy from Kansas just tell 'em where you're from
