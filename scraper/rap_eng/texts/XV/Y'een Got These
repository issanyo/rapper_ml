[Intro] [XV talking]:
Yeah, what up Green Lantern? It's my turn. If you got your kick game up you need to turn this up just a few more notches please. Yerrrdigg

[Hook]:
Go ahead show 'em what you got
(What you got)
Top shelf kicks fresh out the box
(Out the box)
They already old by the time they really drop
So point down and tell them haters why you're really hot
And say
Y'een got these
Y'een got these
Y'een got these
Nah you don't, nah you don't
Y'een got these
Y'een got these
Y'een got these
Nah you don't, nah you don't

[Verse One]:
I'm like...pssst
The Fresh Prince shake on 'em
(Fly?)
Yes the fresh kicks bapes on 'em
Y'all gon' try to get 'em 'fore the dates on 'em
A-1 Vince's you ain't tripping, that's a face on 'em
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on the patent leather, same afro and chucks
Catch me in Alife Court Victory pumps
And kicks so mean you want to tattle on us
Us get your kick game up like hacky sack
I come back to the city, niggas mad he's back
Gon' 'head look down, they don't hurt to stare
I call these the Halle Berrys, they the perfect pair

[Hook]:
Go ahead show 'em what you got

So point down and tell them haters why you're really hot
And say
Y'een got these
Y'een got these
Y'een got these
Nah you don't, nah you don't
