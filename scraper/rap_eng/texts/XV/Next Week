I keep sending her signs like she has deaf ears
She the one in my life, I wanna spend the rest with
I wanna tell her how I feel and I can't stress it enough
This is tough, I keep getting blocks like Tetris
I'm drawn to her outline like Etch-A-Sketch's
A book I read said to approach her in 3 seconds
I'm 3,600 and counting 'bout to say, "forget it."
But I can't let it
Look where my head is

[Sample Hook] (XV):
Oh babe
I said I tell you all the things I feel (and Tuesday passing)
Wednesday, when you walked by, my whole world (and I don't even say nothing)
(And Thursday come up)
Thursday I say I'm gonna tell you I feel (I don't do nothing)
And the final week, come Friday I just say (do you know what I end up saying?)
(I just told her)
I'm never gonna quit get you baby
(Cause if I can't get you today, I'll holler next week)
Never gonna quit you baby
(I'll tell you everything on Monday if you just let me)
Never gonna quit you baby
(They say patience is a virtue, it won't hurt you to see, so)
Never gonna quit you baby

[Verse Two]:
Next week
Say I'll holler next week
Next week I'll say I'll holler next week
It's getting old writing this scroll like next sheet
Next pencil, next line
Next rhyme, next beat
Next week I'm telling her everything
Put my heart in
I got a good hand
So bump it, I'm just gonna put my all in
Now I'm beating on my chest like Tarzan
I need a plain Jane
And she don't wear no make up (why?)
She is a maid
She Vista I'm XP, I need an upgrade
I know this love thang
It is a tough game
But I will play it All Night Long like Lionel
I'll send a message in bottles
I'll sing a song on a vinyl
See I just wanna touch her like the stuff on Apollo
I see that
Arch from afar, yeah, just like McDonalds
I'm thinking, I should write her a letter, tell her all I can say
Cause all I can say, at the end of the day is

[Sample Hook] (XV):
I'm never gonna quit you baby
(Cause if I can't tell you today, I'll holler next week)
Never gonna quit you baby
(I'll tell you everything on Monday if you just let me)
Never gonna quit you baby
(They say patience is a virtue, it won't hurt you to see, so)
Never gonna quit you baby
