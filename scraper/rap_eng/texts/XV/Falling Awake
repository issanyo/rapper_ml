[Verse One: XV]
Didn’t go to college, my mama gave me the saddest look
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle backpack with a rabbit foot
Never wanna grow up, still fighting with Captain Hook
Everyone confessing with questions about the path I took
I laid down and never woke up it seems
Never opened my eyes, I just opened my dreams
Then I opened the curtain, but I closed out the scene
Of my son with a dad and my girl with a ring
‘Cause now I’m up on stage and I hear all the screams
And the girls backstage are down to do anything
So sometimes I slip off like shoes without strings
And that OJ’s love train is losing its steam
My son wants to stay up, my girl wants to lay up
My mom wants to talk, my agent wants his pay cut
A dream becomes a nightmare, my buzz takes a light-year
And all the while right there, my girl’s telling me to wake up
If that’s the real life then all of this is fake
The dream that you’re living is too much for me to take
It all becomes real in that bed that I made
So every time I lay down, I fall awake

[Hook]
And it’s not what it seems
I don’t wanna sleep if you’re not in my dreams, I fall awake
I wake up dreaming, I fall awake
I make believe what they believe I make
Success is close but far away so I wake up dreaming, I fall awake
And it’s not what it seems
I don’t wanna sleep if you’re not in my dreams, I fall awake

[Verse 2: XV]
I used to dream about my grandmother daily
And then my dreams is real life but I ain’t seen her lately
Comic stores open and I wait for her to take me
I can scream at the top of my lungs like Mr. Spacely
I writing, fighting these tears for fears
Fighting the hears and cheers like in the battles between titans
And I just want a quiet place to Brighton
My crippled reality has un-tightened and my dream world is heightened
‘Cause that’s the only place where my love once stayed
Not in the ground, decay, the love don’t fade
It all becomes real in that bed that I made
So every time I lay down, I fall awake

[Hook]
