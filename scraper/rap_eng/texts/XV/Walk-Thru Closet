[Verse]:
So I change flows like Mr. Roger's change clothes
Same socks, same shirts, infinite, yeah, same soul
The next room is kinda bright so put your shades on
And please make a right where those decade highs lay on
Now please be silent
This is where I zone G
Throw on my Oakley's, you can't see my eyelids
Threw out my Ed Hardys though all that was my shit
Once everybody started I thought it was garbage
So I said, "Forget it." Threw on the New Era fitted
Titled cap and peeled it back, top of the dome is where I sit it
The wallet chains was wicked till everybody else bit it
These niggas act like it's trendish to follow what other trends is
Look at these John Varvatos my vato, these are expensive
So I see everything different through some richer lenses
Okay, make sure nobody is missing
Onto the Stussy room and Kramer Flyboy macking Academiks
Listen
