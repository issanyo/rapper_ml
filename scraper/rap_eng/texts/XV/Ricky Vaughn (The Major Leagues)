[Verse One] [XV]:
This what y'all been waiting fo', waiting fo'
Bumping Gnarles Barkley, Who's Gonna Save My Soul?
Top 5 Newest Artist, nigga take a vote
Without E ? and Dudds, you can't make 'em blow
And I can't save your flow
I'm in the sky so high I can step on our Jesus Christ savior's toes
I play a major role on almost any song
And that list is pretty long
So here's another hit, Ricky Vaughn

[Chorus] [XV]:
The major leagues baby
Yeah, yeah, the major leagues baby
Uh huh, the major leagues baby

[Verse Two] [XV]:
Duuuuude
Fresh off the plane manye
I know they saying
"When's the album coming out fam?"
You know they waiting
Dr. Dre make 'em wait cause he know they patients
Best Rapper Alive? I heard that's taken
Most Creative Individual? Well that there's vacant
Well let me take it
And make them face facts
That I'm a Warrior taking over like Ajax
Drop the ball and they gon' pick me up like play jacks
Weezying through the scene when they seen how I make tracks
See how I make stacks?
Shopping in a city where I don't even pay tax
And bring my state back
A souvenir
You appear to bring that hate back
I thought that got old like a couple of days back
Kid dropped the shit, XV's on Ex-Lax
What does X lack?
I'm glad that you asked
Cause I never really hustled but I got my cash
And I never had muscle so I kept my straps
And y'all gangsta rappers keep on lying out your ass
Cause yo' future's so wack they bringing up your past
Excuse me, I just like to laugh
Life of the don
Lights keep glowing
Come and see my show when they turn Get Fresh on
Now everybody turn up they arms
Uh huh
And here's another hit Ricky Vaughn

[Chorus] [Fresh Daily]:
We outta here baby
Yo XV we so outta here baby
And it's me, Mr. F dot Daily

[Verse Three] [Fresh Daily]:
Yo, I got the flow of the century
Swag of the millennium
The cat's out the bag
I got chips like Pentium
Major league player though
Don't hate on me, A to Z your favorite MC say I'm dope
Asshole like I'm Larry David
I never graduated
You just mad and hating
Congratulate him before you trapped in the batting cages
And I'm Barry Bonds
I mean, I'm Ricky Vaughn
I mean I'm Casey Jones
In case you ain't listening, it's very basic homes
I'm the bat man/Batman, minus the cape and gloves
I'm Hot Boy like Lil' Wayne minus me taking drugs
Pardon myself, I'm never faking thug but you can take a slug
You saying stuff about the team then you can lay in blood
B-b-b-black Nikes with Louis Vuitton
Zoom in the Coupe and the roof is gone
It's me XV and the dude with his Supras on
A.O.K. the crew I'm on
Everyone else is
Well...you know where these dudes is going
Nowhere and oh yeah I'm putting it out there
This is our year
You jock our gear
And we don't shop here
We don't spend gwap here
They just send us boxes of hot wears
And we do not care
Cause we stay top tier like sky boxes
Or hi tops of Nike Airs
Homie, I'm right here

[Chorus] [XV]:
The major leagues baby
Yeah, yeah, the major leagues baby
Uh huh, the major leagues baby
