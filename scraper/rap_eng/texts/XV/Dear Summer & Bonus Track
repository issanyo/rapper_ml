(Dear Summer)
When you come up, I come in
It's like a revolving door with this music biz
I seen you love, I'm seeing you hate, I'm seeing you love him again
But I'm happy you that let me come and be your friend
Cause last year your man had the streets on fire
But you cheated with a dude who did through the wire
The only man you had that I loved retired
And this year you had some dude who won a fuck ?
But I swear at the same time you fucked with this man
Summer, maybe you the reason them cats ain't friends
Cause 50 had you locked in '03, fucked his friends in '04
But Summer, that ain't the shit that I go for
You need to calm down and show me you love me
Cause whenever you come 'round shit gets ugly
Niggas be shooting cause they don't know what to do with you
And I can't move on, I'm just so used to you
And all these little cats be hawking down you
Matter fact, Usher's Confession was talking about you
I seen you show him love, him man Lil' John
How can you do this, you supposed to be my baby's mom
Bullshit catching up, hip-hop mad at us
Everybody love you, Fat Joe's trying to snatch you up
Hov had Nas scared even to holla back at you
Every seven years Dre come around and fuck with ya
The past tow, the Dirty South had you getting crunk and stuff
I'm kinda mad at that, I'm kinda jealous
But overwhelmed at the fact that I want you as well as every nigga that raps
Except for maybe Eminem, he got to win a lot
He even promised he could drop weak shit and never flop
You showed Nelly mad love, I knew that was great
Cause that means you're starting to spread you heart my way
If you can just give me the time of the day
And half the whole world after X-to the-V
I promise I will never leave you or let you stray every single day
But don't have me waiting for long, ma, c'mon
I'm taking three minutes out to write you a song
You can reply back, besides that, to see where your mind's at
I know you drop niggas, I mean, see where Ja's at?
But I don't work extra hard just to get your heart
There's no sleeping if you let me keep it
I swear there won't be no lying or cheating
I'll open up my soul, Summer, tell you all my secrets
Just give me your time
I know the last letter you received had you crying and you ain't never lie
I see you kinda stingy I can tell by how you did Bleak
Look at his first week
I mean, damn
How you gonna do bleak like that

As I head home and call it a day, I hope you think about the things that I say
It's a cruel, cruel world, ma, I know that now
But I'm the only one that will truly hold you down
Every single year I will come around, I did that 4 times and I'm still unsigned
Legacy in '02, The Answer in '03, Overture in '04
I ain't saying no more

They just ?
Police is watching, the streets is talking
They just ?

That I'm a rapper, dude, that's what they notice first
And that my rapping crew makes situations worse
So I can I give my view on how you give us cues
Like we just rap, hoop, talk loud and barbecue
Niggas don't hear the dude, they all skip the message
Too complex with my complexion, man, get to stepping
And they don't know that I'm close to a deal, think it's a counterfeit marker on my $5 bill
I wear my hat the the side, roll with a couple of thugs
Bump my shit in my ride, turn it all the way up
Call a cutie a honey, call a hoochie a ho
Middle fingers to the cops, yeah, you already know
I wear a do-rag to lay down my waves, but somehow they turn that around to I'm in a gang
Instead of staring, just try to wave and say 'hi'
And keep moving, cause I'mma do me and stay fly
They just

[Hook]

Rappers are ? killers, we got the vultures with us
We tell the world that we cold killers and drug dealers
I'm so ill and realer than most
Killing the flow, and still you keep feeling the ghost spilling you
I'll be damned if I let a nigga choose my look
You can't describe me through the pictures in you're rapping books
You can't allow the money stacking in my platinum jeans
Allow you to think that you know me in the magazines
Just allow the scene and the songs I bring
X out the thoughts you brought and describe me to the V
Don't allow my status being king of the city take your perception quickly
Cause I'm a gentleman like Mr. Bentley
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered with talk
"And, like, how can I get on," I just hear it too often
So when I say I'm busy, guess I'm pleading the fifth
I bet I'll make my way to Heaven with all of these fears

[Hook]
