[Intro]
All we have is now...(2x)

[Hook 1]
As logic stands, you couldn't meet a man who's from the future
But you and me were never meant to be part of the future

[Verse 1]
See, I had good cause when I lifted off
Just wanted to go up and see the stars
Just wanted this robe off to see your bra
Strap yourself in we can't get off
Now I've fallen down and I've fallen far
Amongst the same stars that I've wished upon
Spaceship, spaceship take me home
Now I'm hearing alarms
Here comes the storm

[Hook 2]
We're no gonna make it...(We're not gonna make it) (3x)
Now...

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2]
I know
They said this world was never ready for you
Your girl was never ready to move
You tell her you weren't ready to prove
Now it's you verse the world are you ready to lose?
It's you or them are you ready to choose?
I'm fighting with myself already the blues
I get out and I ready the fuel
And turned on the radio and that's when I knew

[Hook 2]

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
Its funny how bad you want something til you get it
Save a bunch of pennies just to turn around and spend it
You never know its ending until its ending
Credits start rolling and your name ain't in it
The fat lady starts pulling out her lyrics
You don't want her to sing it, so you don't want to hear it
The shoe fits perfect but you don't wanna wear it
You rather just lie in the form of appearance
And you won't make it!
Get reported to the deck
And I face it
Like a body with no neck
Those are words that I probably won't forget
When I return to Earth to see your faces after this
Everybody's drowning cause they can't sale
Stayed on my own two dog I ain't fell
But this world ain't for me I could tell
So I'm gone, Farewell

[Hook 3]
You and me were never meant to be part of the future (5x)

[Outro]
All we have is now...(2x)
