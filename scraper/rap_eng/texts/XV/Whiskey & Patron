[XV]
Vizzy ride a Seven beat like it got handlebars
Had to learn to handle liquor just to handle bars
In New York hoppin' in and out of yellow cars
Cause the kid turn styles without a metro card
Back when Dom' was young without a buck
Doin' Saki bombs with moms I like to fuck
Skin tone mixed like the drank in my cup
Take sour with the skunk you could taste through the blunt
Niggas fake from the jump when they in the studio
You take a shot at Dom' (Don) better be Julio
I be M.I.A. with M.I.L.A. Kunis though
Drinkin' Jim Beam, girl tryin' to get a movie role
Oooh been shootin' for stars like paparazzi
Commas comin' in I never went in kamakazi
I might've went ghost and Seven might've went Tommy
If you niggas can't find me I'm probably with a dime piece
Drinkin'-
