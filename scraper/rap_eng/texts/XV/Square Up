Vizzy!
Sez Batters, Freddy High, The Awesome Sound
L7

[Verse 1: XV]
What is this? Squarian City?
Freddy pairin' with Vizzy
Sez the barbarian
Twistin' the tops off, the fizz is lifting
Americans staying idol
Squarians getting busy
On point, who the fuck is they kidding?
Richie, no one, they fibbing, leave them with no tongue
I took this shit back to '01
They O and one now I'm on one
I'm [?] until my souls done
Death come I'm still 'gon rep it
My heart behind these bars, I'm cardiac arrested
Your stomach can't elect it
So I brought the burners
So these fake niggas can't take the fall for murder
Niggas used to beef, now they just drive thru burgers
I guess it's great when you make what your IQ earned ya
Now they just an observer, sitting back watching em' king us
Simba come back and you stop hearing those laughs from hyenas
Said we getting the crown, and they never believed us
They were shooting it down but as soon as you see us we told you

[Hook]
Square up
Pretty girls you might wanna put your hair up
L7's you might wanna put your hands up
They circle don't put it down so the squares up
Tell 'em square up
Niggas square up
Square up
Tell 'em square up
They circle don't put it down so the squares up

[Verse 2: Freddy High]
From now on nigga, the game is shut down
L7's next to blow
More square friends over the circles full of fake friends
They all fit in, I stand out, because I ain't them
My vision pan out
I just wanna say I let 'em know
L7 coming up, I love to see y'all repping though
That model love life but gotta live it every second though
Still kill tracks and I never like stretching though
We next to blow and always going long enough to let 'em know
That niggas still biting my style with no fundamentals
Last year I was tryna find words to them instrumentals
Sez told me finish breakfast y'all continental
And now my team is on top and going monumental
Yea, stadium status, now welcome to my venue
Insight to my mind to show y'all what I'm into
I can't relate to you niggas, that ain't what I'm kin to
And other then a bad bitch tell me what I've been through
So square up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sez Batters]
Bars hot, take'em inhale
This is lyrically hell in a cell
Boy I'm 'bout my paper, man I'm 'bout my mail
Got these showboats floating, thinking that they can sail
Leaving cross bones, I cross zones
No matter, call me Batters
Zoning in my box you won't catch the line that run across homes
Hit 'em with combinations don't play it safe
But still when they hitting you feel a touch of base
This is not The Carter this is Sparta
We playing around the world, you playing horse, go grab some water
No bullshit, don't need no goggles
See I spit by the bottles
Open bars to the roof, hangover sure to follow
Lyrics pounding like a hash tag
Bars over bullshit, they desert them like Baghdad
So through verses I'm providing hearses and gas masks
Won't let 'em breathe they flow will need some gas fast
My circle dense so tell 'em

[Hook]
