[Sample]
Through these eyes
I can see loneliness heading my way
The light of love has gone out
Now your shadow's gone away
You took away the sound
The touch, the smell, my sight
To see your smile

[XV]
Rappers better back up
Try and do some movies get your act up
Kill the twin towers rise of the hole
N-O it's back up
Nigga tell me you don't love me
If you don't love me don't hug me
I'm a squeeze
This ain't just sick it's a disease
And I'm off it
And blink caught it
And Sez caught it
You ain't sick you just coughing
That's temporary flu
I'm hotter than the summer
You just January cool, nigga
Complex the hottest album, turn your speaker on
Hotter than the summer with the oven and the heater on
I got them black on white Adidas on
JMJ on 'em, the old school ? on 'em
I'll hear these hoes talking better through the shade at 'em
I got my swag back, I might not even wave at 'em
I ain't break handcuffs, I'll let your man do it
She like to tape up the finish line, I ran through it
I'm from the deuce one you can find me all through it
Head high even if I'm riding in a Buick
My guy fuck apartments stash the heat and all use it
The wood-grain on my wheel got diamonds all through it
99% tints, you won't can't see him
Mr. Blueprint but you just can't be him
You might know my hustle but you just can't beat him
Don't try to follow him, lead him to a mausoleum
I'm in new shoes but I put my old feet in
Re-up time, pal, I put the whole G in
Niggas don't like a man they looking like beefing
Tricky eyes hate a man, they looking like ?
He is so Kansas but he is speaking so East Coast
Sound like it, let's go heat him
I dare you to try me with the heater, Pistol Pete
When I'm squeezing, kill niggas without even speaking nothing
