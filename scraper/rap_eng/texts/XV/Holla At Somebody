Holla at somebody real
Holla at somebody real
Before they holla at you
And you see them in the club popping collars at you
Holla at somebody real
Holla at somebody real
Before they holla at you
And the next thing you know they throwing dollars at you

[Verse One] [Consequence]:
Baby, I'm in denial or I feel entitled
To the truth like when Chloe yelled "Bible"
Too many times I let these side hoes
Leave me burning like Michael by the pyro
Or the chick in Diddy's hot tub
And that'll get you locked up
Duh
Because the chick on my arm is a ticking time bomb
So the dick in my charm, it don't fit in my palm
Plus that last trip to the Palms
Made her sold them tickets to her moms
???????
Cause they don't know a "sira" or an "ire" in the Koran
So she wonder what's allowed in her RAM
While I'm singing George Michael in Wham
Wake me up before you go-go before you go-go
And trick off of Ray Bans
And her next tan, with some clear water and some fresh sand
The next man would've reneged on the deal
But luckily for her she got somebody's that's real

[Hook]:
Holla at somebody real
Holla at somebody real
Before they holla at you
And you see them in the club popping collars at you
Holla at somebody real
Holla at somebody real
Before they holla at you
And the next thing you know they throwing dollars at you

[Verse Two] [XV]:
She used to seeing her dude as much as Hollow Man
And he just jet on his son with no hologram
I got a great record with girls that be modeling
And you ain't even touching that nigga, that's that Serato fam
She seen me on the TV more than need be
Trying to see the World, I'm already Mr. Feeny
Next door to your girl, bell ringing
Shit, I would never see them double D's in 3D
So how could you, put an X next to X like Malcolm do?
Told her, "Let me love you like Mario. Fuck Bowser boo."
She said, "Your name is 15 so can I count on you?"
"Pppst. More than once baby. Whenever you want lady."
You can feel me or just IPod Touch play me
That nigga fucking crazy, so you should fuck me crazy
She said, "Great idea."
She'd been looking for the real and it stays right here
I'm like

[Hook]:
Holla at somebody real
Holla at somebody real
Before they holla at you
And you see them in the club popping collars at you
Holla at somebody real
Holla at somebody real
Before they holla at you
And the next thing you know they throwing dollars at you
