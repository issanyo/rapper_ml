[Verse One]:
Windows down
Just cruise
Open the paper take a look at the news
The industry's shaken up
Jay & Dame breaking up
Shyne locked up and Jam Master Jay shot up
I thank the Lord when I wake cause I got up
Though I'm suiting up for a wake for my partner
When everything's bad, good news sounds sad
And I still gotta deal with the problems that I had
Best friends beefing with me, girl friend ain't speaking to me
Rap got these fake cats trying to put their heaters to me
Trying to find my way out, they trap me in
Cats try to flex even when I'm at the gym
Sometimes it seems like the only thing to do
When I can't express all my feeling in the booth
I turn on a CD, Aaliyah's Care For You
Jay Dee's Volume 2 or Lil' Jon's Crunk Juice
Speakerboxxx/The Love Below or TP2
Get Rich Or Die Tryin' sounds good in the Coupe
Portishead, Fiona Apple, man whatever fits you
And before you know it man, the world's on mute

[Hook]:
Sometimes I just wanna cruise
From the things that I go through
I just wanna cruise
Turn off the two way on your phone dude
I just wanna cruise
Get away from the Pro Tools
I just wanna cruise
Cause this life is just so cruel
Sometimes I just wanna cruise
From the things that I go through
I just wanna cruise
Turn off the two way on your phone dude
I just wanna cruise
Get away from the Pro Tools
I just wanna cruise
Cause this life is just so cruel

[Verse Two]:
Windows down
Just cruise
Open the paper take a look at the news
The Dirty South waking up
Fif and Game breaking up
Mac Dre murdered and the industry's shaken up
Hip Hop Police drive around and pursue
And the niggas with they chains that they see on the tube
That they see on the wall
Of their children's room
It just has them appalled
That we do what we do
They would love to see a nigga back in whips and chains
Rather than a black man buying whips and chains
Fly to Dallas for a week, in front row watch Game
They claim they want us off the streets, still they complain
Sometimes it seems like the only thing to do
When I can't express all my feelings in the booth
I turn on a CD
Blueprint 2
Or Blueprint 1
Whatever fits you
It's Dark And Hell Is Hot or Coldplay's Parachutes
Juelz Santana's From Me To You
Or Things Fall Apart, my favorite joint from The Roots
Music helps me get away from the troops

[Hook]

[Verse Three]:
O.D.B. passing
J-Dilla just left us
Proof got shot in the head, it's all messed up
My home girl burned up, it scares me to think
When we die nobody knows where we gon' turn up
I think about life for the living, driven
Determined to make it for my children
If and, when I do, I'll be drifting
In this dirt we call Earth got me tripping
And I don't even smoke but I think like a cheefa
Instead view the world through the eyes of the cheeba
Think of
Otis Redding singing through Emmett Till's pain
Or Jimi Hendrix guitar played by Kurt Cobain
It's like music is my melody, fix to cocaine
Once you feel the kick kick, straight to your brain
Sometimes the world can drive a brother insane
So when I wanna get away from the game
I just wanna cruise

[Hook]
