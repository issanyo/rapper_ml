The money to cars and the whips (yeah, we got that)
The honeys to broads and the chicks (yeah, we got that)
Sitting on 26 inch (yeah, we got that)
Don't get it twisted nigga, I'm the definition, nigga

[Verse]
I hold it down for the town that you found me in
These niggas looking like damn where your mouth be spent
It's been in the same the castle hat the count be in
If it's royalty affiliated count me in
Three broads on the telly all night and shit
Tie your hair back, baby, fight over the dick
What you working with?
Mommy burp the dick
We at the dining room table, keep serving it
Man, my words so slick and my grammar so loud
But I'm constantly told that I'm repping my town
The haters in my city can't hold a nigga down 'cause I
Look in the clouds and my grandma so proud
Cause I'm doing my thing they selling a nigga out
And everything I say motherfuckers talk about
At the barbershop niggas say ?
Chicks ain't never wanna talk act like they know me now
Wow
