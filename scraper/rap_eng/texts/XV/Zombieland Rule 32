[Intro: Irv Da Phenom]
See I gotta let the truth out
Life will never be perfect
So all we gotta do now
Is find a way to make it worth it
In a world full of zombies
You are all that I need
You are all that I need

[Verse 1: XV]
Unh, don't fall for 'em, ice cold
With my heart on froze and my glass on chill
Just a portion of life is a fortune
Cause some niggas didn't spend that wheel
Unless they had some Vanna white they could sell
Probably weighed more than Vanna White on a scale
You know as much as you can when you don't know enough
The hard part is growing old without growing up
Gotta kush-filled bowl ready, loaded up
And a couple bad hoes tryin to roll with us
Who show off their body off like its a canvas
Just to be apart of the student body on the campus
Me and the devil have had a couple of dances
Highway crashes, bad romances
Girls taking interests like cash advances
Don't live for the glances, baby take your chances

[Hook: Irv Da Phenom x2]
If this gets old, its nothing new
Come hit this smoke, come sip this juice
Just live your life, that's what we do
Enjoy these things: Rule 32

[Verse 2: XV]
I said hey, what's your name?
She replied "Wichita"
Damn, we on Squaria now, how'd you get this far?
Well, I'm the Kid With the Green Backpack
I live life, and write raps, but I'm black
So they try to say I couldn't live my dream like Martin
Cause they know I'm from the middle like Malcolm
Look at this thing we started
Every circle wanna square nigga round 'em
You ain't in X's box? Go on, get ya Wii on
Told you I never was the one you should sleep on
Now you want the curb like Larry and Leon
Cause you ain't bout the life that the L7s be on
We on

[Hook x3]
