My notebook has 4000 stories
Now my crib has 4000 stories
I don't brag but I do it for the glory and I guess that's the moral of the story
Well okay

[Verse 1: Yonas]
These days I sound a little cynical
For all the days I had holes in my clothes, I had to pin up those
Had dream girls, had to pin up those
Then I stopped carin', now I'm bangin' centerfolds
Damn, I worked a 9 to 5 and a 10 to 4
Back then I never had to force the pen to flow
Just the intricate dreams of a madman
Don Draper, whiskey bottle in the trash can
Damn, tried to market out a fast plan
Do I sell drugs or run a tax scam?
Aw fuck it I just rap man
And make my life story all about tryin' to unmask the masked man
Yeah, this is poetry in motion
This is seven hours nigga, this is the purest of devotion
I'ma make a statement make sure you niggas quote it
Don't ever get the notion that I'll ever stop tellin' my story

[Bridge]
You've got a story to tell
4000 stories in you
You've got a story to tell

[Verse 2: Yonas]
Yo, is it seven or eight albums?
I don't know, they all great albums
Not to toot my own horn but I was born to make albums
When I listen to them I throw away albums
Damn, let's take it back to the park for 'em
Let me take a second and break it apart for 'em
This is Michael Jordan crossin' Brian Russell at the line
And posin' for the picture just to show off the art for 'em
Yeah, I told you I'm the man
Since day one it's been me and my fans
Hopped the spaceship, took a chance
And we good where ever we land
Word to the Six God, it's 'God's Plan'
Ready for the lift off, I'm just sayin'
I'ma make statements, make sure you niggas quote it
Don't ever get the notion that I'll ever stop tellin' my story

[Verse 3: XV]
Vizzy
I used to wake up, catch the bus at 6:20
Shane been up, still tryin' to get money
14 years old already gettin' honeys
What is funny I was runnin' away from anyone who loved me
Jumpin' over fences goin' inches in the trenches
Bouncin' out the house, bustin' doors off the hinges
Little did I know that my flow had [?]
Stop bingin' of them shows, nigga go out and get it now
Befo' MTV did dramas
This girl named Rebecca was the first teen mama
That I knew and she blew through the trauma
I hope she get to tell her story cause I know that she got one
Or two, cause I know I got a few
Checkin' on the items on the list I gotta do
When you come from the middle and you come up a little
Start ballin', don't let 'em tell you, "Shut up and dribble."
I'ma scribble my story
