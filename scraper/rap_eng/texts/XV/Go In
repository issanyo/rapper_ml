[Verse One]:
Back on my shit so hard
Niggas say, "Pause" while I say, "Start"
Cause I play video games so much I think I have an X-Box heart
Driving my hog, while I rip this apart
I'm a Bad Robot, tell them niggas get Lost
Got the game on lock down, Rick Ross
Soon as I got on, they all shut off
They created minds that they never used at all
Aww, put me to the test like Saw
Y'all all Dead Silent, playing with dolls
Dark shades cause
But I got a whip that'll make your broad, chase my car
It flies in the air
Put the key in, switch gears and it estimates when we take off
Back from the land, call The Land Of The Lost
Where the dinosaurs roam, the bones are my yard
Willy Wonka'd on my imagination
I'm just trying to hang, no lacerations
Stand out, it was all planned out, like the Kennedy assassinations
Dudes got deals, congratulations
But your followings not real like Pastor Mase's
I waited all my life to get niggas attention
DJ Khaled please tell these niggas to Listennn
Playing my Coleco I got a Vision
Closed mouths don't get fed so I just started spitting
Maybe now they'll know who I is then
Kid With The Green Back Pack on a mission
What's in the bag?
Most people thought it was dynamite
Cause I'm gonna blow
So they were kinda right
They tried to bet that the loser won't win
But every time I come out they know I'mma go in
Start

[XV talking]:
I think y'all got it fucked up. See, a drought came along and everybody was like, "We'll just take whatever they give us." What happened to integrity? What happened to passion in this shit? See when I go...I go in!

[Hook]:
They telling me to go in
Go in, go in, go in, go in, go in, go in
They telling me to go in
Go in, go in, go in, go in, go in, go in
Don't stop
Go in
Don't stop
Go in
Don't stop
Go in
Don't stop
Go in
Don't stop
Go in
Don't stop
Go in
Don't stop
Go in
Don't stop
Go in
Don't stop
Go in
