[Verse 1]
Living different lately
I been living different lately
Shit been different
Just as lately, I been living lately
Lately, lately, lately
Lately, lately, lately
The streets fucked up
Who you telling shit done got so crazy
Don't give no fucks
I been riding with my hammer lately
Free my boys
They gon’ be up out that slammer later
Later, later, later
And they gon’ bust, if I say bust

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing but some animals, animals (wooo)
Lately I been living like I know something
And all your life all you knew was let me hold something
Something, something, something, something (wooo)
Bullets fly, hide your kids, hide your fam
Who's snitching?
Mind your business, your business, your business
Keep quiet (wooo)
Money, money, money; who am I becoming, baby?
Them hundred fifties, we go shopping
We don't stash the twenties, twenties
That's twenty, that's twenty, that's twenty

[Verse 3]
I’m the hardest in this shit, I’m just being honest
See back then the problem was I was being too humble
Humble, humble, humble ayy
It's my turn and I'm dyin' to go
I’m living like I want, living like I want, aye
Ran me up a check now I'm living like you don't
These shoes, yeah, are Chanel, my tee’s Saint Laurent
You know you get money when your tees more than 500
Look at me, they can’t stop
It's me Lil' Loaf, project kid
Still will shoot the dice for some hundereds
Better yet, shoot a thousand (shoot a rack)
Don’t know why these niggas doubt me
I come from public housing, cocaine and violence
Violence, violence, violence
Violence, violence, violence

[Verse 4]
I got rid off niggas, now it ain't no pussies 'round
Walking 'round like I'm bulletproof, (I'm somebody's hero)
Bustin' guns (buck, buck)
That's your goons, that's your goons (buck, buck)
Get down, nigga (buck, buck)
Lay it down, nigga (buck, buck)
I been, I been, I been, I been cooking with no cookbook
I swear I'm on they ass
You know I got these bitches shook up
Shook up, shook up, shook up
Shook up, shook up, shook up
I got 'em shaking in they boots
Headshots, no roof
