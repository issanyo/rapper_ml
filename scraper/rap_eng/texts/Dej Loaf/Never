Never say, never say what you can't do
Never let nobody tell you what you can't do
Yay, I say yay
Say yeaaaah
Don't let nobody tell you that it ain't you
Chase your dreams, my baby
Don't let anybody stop your dreamin'
No matter how hard it's seemin'
Keep grindin', I know you got a reason
Don't be scared to express yourself
Go and tell all your daughters you ain't leavin'
Tell 'em that you're here to stay
Me and all my niggas, we gon' make it
Fuck anybody who hate it
Game face on but we ain't playin'
Aye we just gettin' to the money, the money
Aye we just gettin' to the money, money
Aye we just gettin' to the money, money
Aye we just gettin' to the money, money

Me and all my niggas, we gon' make it
Me and all my niggas, we gon' make it
Me and all my niggas, we gon' make it
Aye cause gettin' to the money, money
Aye we just gettin' to the money, the money
