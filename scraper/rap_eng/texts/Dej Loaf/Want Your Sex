[Intro: Jacquees + Dej Loaf]
(Nash B chilling)
So-so lonely, got me sending emojis
And I'm so-so horny, got me feeling emotional
I got your text, I swear it came out of nowhere
Sending me pictures while you find your underwear

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
I want your sex, I'ma ride it let you do the rest
I'ma pull up on it, push up on it
He want me to sit up on it

[Verse 1: Jacquees + Dej Loaf]
These lips, those lips, I want you to kiss all on 'em
You're a wild boy, you want me to spit all on it
Walking with a limp, walking like he got 150 on me
He know what that means
Got it all in my jeans
And we can make babies baby, I got good genes
She want me to take my time
Ask for her parents fine
Whos is it girl, is it mine?
You be screamin' ''Quees'' every time
Hit you from the back like I miss you
You ain't know what we feeling

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
I want your sex, I'ma ride it let you do the rest
I'ma pull up on it, push up on it
He want me to sit up on it
These lips, those lips, I want you to kiss all on 'em

[Verse 2: Jacquees + Dej Loaf]
Girl I used my hands, I broke it down from head to toe
You got that ecstasy and I just need a dose
Come closer baby, turn up baby
I wanna go up, it's all in your stomach while I'm feeling you up
He got my legs up, I got his head up
I need a king, not no lil boy, I told him man up
He know I got the juice, I'm like Nantucket
I know my place, I ain't worried about any woman
He pulled out his dick and I looked to the side
What a surprise
Licking his lips, God damn he's so fine
I say whose is it? It's mine

[Bridge: Jacquees]
Since it's yours to give me
Don't you run, stay with me
Dej tell me what you want

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
I want your sex, I'ma ride it let you do the rest
I'ma pull up on it, push up on it
He want me to sit up on it
These lips, those lips, I want you to kiss all on 'em

[Outro: Jacquees]
You gon' ride, you gon' ride that
Another one
Aye, D'usse
