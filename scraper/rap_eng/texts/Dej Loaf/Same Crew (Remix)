[Verse 1 – Ray Jr]
Shout out to my dog Roland, that’s the OG
Know I got the streets on lock like a door key
My nigga Big Tony saying get back on that streets shit
Junior that new wave, got these niggas seasick
Started out on Haiti, made it out of EK
Now they bump my shit in Houston like Lil Kiki
Dolph said he had to send his bitch to law school
Five bitches in the Benz, that’s a carpool
Real nigga, screaming keep doing your thing, homie
City screaming Bron go and get that ring, homie
Brand new Rolls, had to whip that bitch with two hands
Free dope boy, bitch I need them freak bands
Ay, your baby mama is a cheater, nigga
I gave her cheese for that pussy like a pizza, nigga
Her code sixty-nine on my beeper, nigga
I’m with twin, that’s my motherfucking squeezer, nigga
And we the

[Verse 2 – Young Dolph]
50 pints, 100 bitches, 20 pistols
Smokin' out a different pound with the same niggas
Rap money, trap money, that's the same scrilla
I had to cut that nigga off, man, cause I ain't feel him
Don’t give a fuck, fuck that nigga and everybody with him
All I talk about is the streets because I’m really in 'em
A half a milli worth of kill, I wrap 'em up and send 'em
I hit the trap and get rid of 'em with my same niggas
Different bitch, same clique, naw I don’t switch
30 round extended clip, naw I don’t miss
Got a thick red bitch, go to Ole Miss
60K on my wrist, I just took a shit
And I’m with the

[Verse 3 – Troy Ave]
Different city but I’m with the same niggas
I don’t ball, jewelry got the same glitter
I just came to do me, you just seem bitter
And my life is a movie you ain’t seeing, nigga
Look at my watch, that’s 30 thousand
Look at my drop, that’s a fucking stallion
Perelli on the wheels, heavy on the chills
Link up in the field, major without a deal
BSB records, we the fucking streets
Young Troy Ave, I’m a fucking beast
Now I wave the flag for the fucking East
I used to use glass when I’m busting keys

[Verse 4 – MGK]
Check me out, hold up, wait a minute
Your bitch gone in 60 seconds
Smoking on some kill, still living
Bitch I’m throwing Ls and I’m still winning
Switch the flow up, they pay me to show up
Keep the same crew but I always switch the ho up
Same drink, got the dark with the cola
Bitches come in twos to the boat like Noah
God damn it, Kells in the spot, don’t panic
And that boy got more brothers than Janet
And they be wildin' out, no Nick Cannon
Get drunk, have a baby, don’t plan it
Still standing with the
