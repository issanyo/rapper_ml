[Verse 1]
And my old friends couldn't keep up
I'm not throwin' no shots, but I'mma show you my guns
I'mma take my chances, I ain't bitin' my tongue
I'mma screamin' to the top of my lungs
If you ain't chasin' your dreams, what the fuck are you doin'?
Tell me, how is that fun? Tell me, what keeps you goin’?
I just wanna know, fuck it, I'mma move on
In Detroit, cold as ever, why the fuck is it snowin'?
That's my city, don't shorty think you cool with that gun
You a son of bitch, you ain't tougher than none
I can never be a benchwarmer
Niggas want beef, fuck it, I'll be George Foreman
Diamonds dancing, gettin' better at performin'
I be working on my vocals all night, all morning
No snorin', I want it, I warned you, I earned it
Back when they were crackin' jokes and I ain’t think shit was funny

[Chorus]
Old friends that turned into strangers
Ex-lovers mad that I’m famous
They see the picture I painted
I've been going through changes
I prayed to God and I made it
Nobody did me no favors
I’m sorry if you can’t take it
I've been going through changes

[Verse 2]
Ever since I was young, knew I was the one
Dazed in new wave, I'm just soaking it in
Funny how they said that they want it back then
Once I got it, lotta shit started disappearin'
How you carry yourself, how you speak within
Anything negative just ain't part of my plan
God chose me and I'll be Goddamned
If I let another soul try to wheel me in
If it was meant to be, you would be right here
New phone, who dis? Ain't heard from you in years
And they could never call me selfish
Gave chances after chances
Mama knows best, mama said they all jealous
And I ain't gon' lie, that shit is scary when the people that you love
Don't wanna see you flaunt, don't wanna see you eat
They wanna take your porridge
They wanna see you different, they wanna see you normal
I just want my bro free, "Freeman" like Morgan
I'm blessed and I struggle, you don't know my story
Yeah, and shit, soon I'll be married
Hope to see you and your children at my wedding, my baby

[Chorus]
Old friends that turned into strangers
Ex-lovers mad that I’m famous
They see the picture I painted
I've been going through changes
I prayed to God and I made it
Nobody did me no favors
I’m sorry if you can’t take it
I've been going through changes

[Outro]
I've been going through changes
I've been going through changes
