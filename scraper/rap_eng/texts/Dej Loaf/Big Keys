[Intro]
Rock got slaps

[Chorus]
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed

[Verse 1]
I got it poppin', now I want the streets
I lay up with you, you gon’ top me for a week (What's up?)
If I'm in my zone then let me be
I smell like gas, fuck it, let it reek
I see you in your bag, your Fendi, it ain’t cheap
I heard them niggas talkin', they ain't say that shit to me
Sleep walkin' in the crib, got a condo to be free
I pull up in that wagon, baby, put away your Jeep (Yeah)
You remind me of my daddy, that nigga was cheap
I remind me of myself, ain't nobody built like me (No)
When your homeboy died, I ain't feel no sympathy
I drop no fear, niggas say I got too deep

[Chorus]
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed

[Verse 2]
I dropped out of school, I ain't get me no degree (College)
If you think a bitch better, I'ma have to disagree
30k for the watch and it’s plain as it can be
Ridin’ with my top down, cruisin' PT (Woah)
I fuck with myself so I’m bangin' me
Ain't a nigga really fucked me since I was in my teens
Okay, I'm lyin’, maybe one, two or three
Bitch, you got bodies, open up, lemme see
Any nigga think they hard, you know I gotta peep
If you think my guys are soft, try 'em out and watch 'em squeeze
Gon' fuck it up sis, we gon' fuck it up and leave
I was fuckin' with some broads and I was fuckin' up my cheese (Yeah)
You wouldn't believe

[Chorus]
Major cars, big keys
(I told God, "Please, if this shit ain't meant for me")
Push to start, high speed
("I'd rather be out in Waikiki")
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
Major cars, big keys, push to start, high speed
