[Intro]

[Hook: Lil Ant]
Riding them foreign cars
We Winnin'
Spending them bands at the mall
We Winnin'
Hundred Thousand Dollars
We Winnin'
Spend that in the mall
We Winnin'

We Winnin'
We Winnin'
Talk about money then we got plenty
Plenty, We Winnin'
Get them bands and blow them at the mall

[Verse 1: VVench]
VVench!
My flow game luxurious
Your trap game hilarious
My girls be living glamorous
While your girls just be curious
Of our life, cause We Winnin'
Ant and I, We Winnin'
She does the team We Winnin'
On this lean I'm sippin'
Flying on a carpet, ain't talking Aladdin
Me and my boys be bout it
I'm on top of the world, Why you still on cheap ass carpet?
Racks conjured like magic
Like Timmy Turner we savage
This trap life be tragic
Hypebeasts y'all lackin'
Last night we hurtin'
Tonight finna be turnin'
Fuck the opps! We Winnin'
Me and my team We Winnin'
At the mall We Winnin'
Shopping Spree
In the trap I'm running
See that boy he gunning
.45 hit your body now you crawling

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Ant]
I was born to be a winner
I was born to be a winner
Sprinting to the money just like a sprinter
You niggas starving, I'm eating at dinner
Balling so hard like I robbed the fucking bank
Just like Mayweather, All I do is win
Hit the mall and get them bands and blow them like the wind
Chilling with my Puerto Rican Bitch
I asked her do she loved me
She said she don't love me
She in love with Ben Franklins
So broke ass nigga can't afford her (can't afford her)
Me and VVench in them foreign cars
Drop the top
And these haters mad cause we up on top

[Hook]
