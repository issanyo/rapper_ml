[Intro]
Zaytoven
Look at the boys getting off (yeah!)
Look at them girls getting off (yeah!)
None of my niggas is starving
None of my bitches is starving
Cause I'm a big ole boss

[Verse]
I was thinking about it
I was dreaming about it
Had to wake up and find a way
Get a job, nah
Get a bag, it's a hundred ways to get paid
Yeah, ooh
It's a hundred ways to get paid
Yeah hundred ways to get paid
It's a hundred ways to get paid

[Pre-Chorus]
Get rich lemme scratch that off my bucket list (done did that!)
Take a nigga bitch lemme scratch that off my bucket list (I already did that!)
Get rich Saks fifth, we fuck it up
Hell nah, we ain't on no budget
I done made it out, Self-made
And ain't none of these niggas rap niggas touching me (I done did that!)

[Chorus]
Yeah cause I'm a big ole boss (yeah!)
I'm a big ole boss (yeah, get rich!)
Came back from a big ole loss, from a big ole loss (god damn god damn!)
I'm a big ole boss, I'm a big ole boss (getting rich)
Came back from a big ole loss, from a big ole loss
Getting rich woah

[Verse 2]
I'm a big big boss
Me in all the conversations
That's big big talk
No limit to this life I live
It ain't my fault

She don't need no niggers
And my boys that 're still on the block
Running up a bag, nigga I see you
And we're still 'round 'round with the heaters
[?]
Nigga you ain't no felon
[?]
'cause it's a hundred ways to get paid
I don't care how you do it niggers

[Pre-Chorus]
Get rich lemme scratch that off my bucket
Take a nigga bitch lemme scratch that off my bucket list
Get rich Saks fifth, we fuck it up
Hell nah, we ain't on no budget
I done made it out, Self-made
And ain't none of these niggas rap niggas touching me

[Chorus]
Yeah cause I'm a big ole boss

Came back from a big ole loss, from a big ole loss
I'm a big ole boss, I'm a big ole boss
Came back from a big ole loss, from a big ole loss
Getting rich woah

[Verse 3]
Big big dread

If you're feeling your [?] she's coming with us [?]
Look me in my eyes, tell me you love me

[Pre-Chorus]
Get rich lemme scratch that off my bucket
