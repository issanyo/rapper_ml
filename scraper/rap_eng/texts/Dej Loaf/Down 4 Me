[Intro]
Verbal rhyming nigga
Chop chop hoe

[Verse1]
Bitch I bitch I feel like Dragon Ball Z
Battle with the Gods
About the fuck the planet up like
Tessi up from Macki eye
My seven miles got stripes
Like a pair of Adidas straight
This mansion shit you fathom
Before you can have a car hahh
Nigga im a monster
Pussy popper ask your baby mother
Pussy popper ask your baby mother
30 nigga beat you  like you called on contra
Hear this bitch a pistol bullets like a chopper
Call me when you're home alone
And I will come and cock yah
Show stopper that jeep with no top
Big papa he elevate he eating lobster
You possy full of pussy shrimp and busters
Damn Jev why you do them like that
What the fuck you got to go and do them like that
Am tired of fakers flipping fiction nigga that’s a fact
She suck me fuck me do my dish that’s all i ever ask for
I ain't fucking with a chick unless she down on me
If I get locked up she really sticking around for me
I put that on my mamma she’s a lady down for me
So bust that pussy open and drop it down for me

[Verse2]
Hey why wouldn't I be down for i wouldn't hold this strap
Unless you let off a couple rounds kill sheet with a blindfold
You feed them lies I feed them pussy by the mouthful
Real nigga hold you down you supposed to drown with it
But no love tell me yes I say no no rocking furs and leathers for me
Yes these shit get so cold so i just
Play my part I just use to break these niggas heart
I’m still a bitch start me up that’s pussy start
My granny told me to use them for what they got you
You got a pussy you gotta pop pop
Why these shit don’t ever stop this shit won’t ever end
Hey it’s just me and him we don’t really got no friends
What’s up J

[Chorus]
If you ain’t fucking with a chick she let you down for me
If I get locked up she really sticking around for me
I put that on my mamma she’s a lady down for me
So bust that pussy open and drop it down for me
