[Intro]
From Detroit's west side

[Hook: Jacquees]
Met her in the club
All the ballers showing love
Can you party with a thug
I'm just trying to show you love
VIP we got it packed
This is where the party at
You're the one I wanna know
So tell me how it's supposed to go

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
He said meet me in Miami
Ever been on a jet girl don't you panic
Get used to the whips and the mansions
He ain't know I was this thick
T-Shirt, Panties
We hit the club together we tip the dancers
Might grab a couple if they really attractive
Or I can keep it classy I can get romantic
It's all up to you
What you wanna do

[Pre-Hook: Jacquees]
I used to love em, leave em
Girl it's something about you
Think I'ma keep you
Pull up in the Wagon I put the Jeep up
Girl we living lavish so kick your feet up

[Hook: Jacquees]
Met her in the club
All the ballers showing love
Can you party with a thug
I'm just trying to show you love
VIP we got it packed
This is where the party at
You're the one I wanna know
So tell me how it's supposed to go

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
Let's take a trip to the other side
Tell me if you're thinking otherwise
You're a boss I wanna treat you
I know you tired of all the leeches
Girl I'm in love with all your features
And I will love you til your knees weak
It could be simple but it ain't easy
I know you know what's up
It's all on us

[Pre-Hook: Dej Loaf]
I used to love em, leave em
Boy it's something bout you
Think I'ma keep you
I pull up in the Wagon I put the Jeep up
Boy we living lavish kick your feet up

[Bridge: Dej Loaf]
All I wanna do
Is get away with you
You had me at hello, what's up
What we gonna do when we leave this club?

[Hook: Jacquees]
Met her in the club
All the ballers showing love
Can you party with a thug
I'm just trying to show you love
VIP we got it packed
This is where the party at
You're the one I wanna know
So tell me how it's supposed to go

[Outro: DeJ Loaf]
(DeJ & Jacquees)
(Yeah, ohh yeah)
