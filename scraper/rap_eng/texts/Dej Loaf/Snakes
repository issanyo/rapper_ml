[Intro]
Yo, fear what you don't know
I know why you mad

[Verse 1]
I’ve learned, you gotta be smarter than them niggas
Out work your opponents, do shit independent
If you ain't where you wanna be, why the fuck are you chillin'?
Keep putting your life in danger, who gon’ take care of them children?
Who gon’ watch them babies? Kill a nigga like whoops-e-daisy
Nigga Slim Shady made it
From Detroit, the place that made me
I done made money
But I never let the money make me
I be fly as fuck, I wear nothin' basic
These are Cartiers, I can't see 'em Raybands
I got the vision of a winner and it's ching-ching-cing
Every time I come around your city, bling-bling
You been a pussy since the sandbox
Kitty litter, kitty litter, pussy nigga, pussy nigga
Yeah, get 'em, get 'em
Run up on 'em, make him feel it, feel it
Yeah you be talkin' like you really with it
Always talkin' bout gettin' rid of niggas
Always talkin' bout killin' niggas wassup
Get advice for a chicken dinner
Nigga that's a 20 piece, straight tenders
Go ahead taste, put your fingers in it
Finger lickin'

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna speak my mind
Uh, (?)
Y'all don't understand what it takes
To keep this shit flowin', we gon' win regardless

[Verse 2]
Snakes, they ain't too far, they in your face
The closest ones ain't who they say
Envy, jealousy, hate
Gotta get 'em out the way
Before it's too late
And these bitches are too fake
Gemini yeah two-faced
I got two words, fuck you
Fuck you
Oh-na-na-na-na
I take care of my mama
You (?)
Then you gotta go
Oh-ya-ya-ya-ya
Killers at your head, yeah
Whole eggs for breakfast, no cereal
