My Life

[Verse]
Look I was raised on the north end for a couple years
They say my mama lost it, so my grandma took us in
It was me my two brothers and my older cousins kids
We ain't really had no food so they hit the store and steal
Ayo I'm for real, starving if you want [?]
And I was always shy, so I ain't never had no friends
My brother he was ten, running errands for them ends
Like take this here go give it to my mans
But, Ayo I don't even know
He was doing what he was told and that's how it had to go
He was doing what he was told and thats how it had to go
When my mama came through, she would come and she would go
We would cry our eyes out and get a whipping for it though
My grandma sold Y-B, and she did it for the dough
And I ain't want to go to bed cause there'd be mice all on my floor
Mama bring us clothes and we we're happy little souls
Like, this yours, that yours go head and try it on
My Grandma always kept a couple hoes
I thought they were her friends, turns it out it was some more
She had a thing for women, my brother was kinda feminine
Ain't trying to sound down, just some shit I be rememberin'
East side Detroit, dirty glove Michigan
I'm just telling my story and I hope yall can picture it
(why)
Aye cause this how I came up, situations made me tough
Made me realize what was what
What the fuck I was a kid, I ain't really know much
All I wanted was my mama my daddy and packed lunch
But, instead I got whippings and took em like I was tough
It wasn't much, I was a solider
Knew we'd be with moms again
Cause we had to move east when they took Grandma to the pin
I was prayin', but I knew we'd see her once again
She got a couple years but that was time for us to spend
Time with my Mom, time for us to bond
Mom, I'm your daughter and I really like to rhyme
I want to shine like you, I want to grind like you
I want a house with a view, and a nice sized pool
What it do, I met my best friend when we moved
She was cool, a year younger
We went to the same school
We played pool, played ball with the boys
I was cute, but I hated when they call me tomboy
(why)
I guess it was insecurities
Skinny little girl couldn't wait to reach puberty
I waited long enough, seventeen I lost my purity
Found someone I love, my love he was feelin' me
But life goes on, I'm too strong like seriously
They killed my little cousin, I ain't gon lie it was killin' me
My Grandma died peacefully, and she ain't seemed sick to me
Week later they found lil Greg in an alley, He
Just graduated man that shit fucked up the family
Tragedy they run in threes
I got a job to get my little brother off them streets
Them shits weak, I got asthma I can barely breathe
I got in college with a 15 on my ACT
Trying to tell me I couldn't read, fuck outta here (please..please)
Look, but in class I would fall asleep
Writing rhymes through the lectures
I got to make it, I'm so desperate
(why)
I just am, ya know?
