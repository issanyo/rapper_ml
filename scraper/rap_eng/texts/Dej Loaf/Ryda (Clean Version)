My ambitionz of a rida-da-da

Put her in a YSL and that Prada-da-da

Keep the pistol on the side-da-da

In the Lamborghini smokin on that la-la-la

She got her hair in the wind, eyebrows on fleek

'15 Bonnie & Clyde, Nicki and Meek

I gave her keys to the condo, keys to the Jeep

Say "You jigglin, baby", gave her the whole damn fleet

I always ride for you baby, and when shit get hard

You know I parade on the side of you, baby

Yeah, I met him in a dope gang, he had no name

Back when you could get a half or a whole thang

Back when we all ever needed was the cocaine

Bricks in the 600 why they call me Raw Game

40 in the Sti dash fuck around and be road kill

With the top down feelin like

My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)

My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)

My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

My ambitionz of a rida

No whip now we in the Ray Roll Range

Keep it gangsta pricy, one of them cold things

Wit ya, noooo, I ain't mad at ya

Get out of line, probably throw a couple jabs at em

Hit Rodeo, probably throw a couple bags at ya

In my 2Pac voice - I ain't mad at ya

Take the wheel, see if you can drive while I eat it

My fitted flew off, but I dont need it, tell me what I need

You need a bitch that's gonna blast, spend cash with ya

Same time fuck good, drop ass for you

Yeah, I ride it like rah-rah-rah-rah

Eat the pussy like la-la-laaaa

Why you gotta tell a nigga buinnes

Fine nigga Friday, you know a nigga live this

Hit you with the helicopter tongue

Then fuck you til the helicopter come

One look and I got her

In corners in my Impala

(My ambitionz of a rida)

Slidin down that pole for a dollar, nada

Tell that girl Holla

(My ambitionz of a rida)

I done brought the Thug Life out her

Got her stuffin bircks in that Prada

(My ambitionz of a rida)

And she love when I'm inside her

And can't nobody divide us
