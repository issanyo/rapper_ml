Oh na na, oh na na, oh na na
Say
Oh na na na

[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
I had a dream I was so rich
I woke up I was so rich
I grind for it niggas notice
Were was y'all when we had eviction notices
When, when I was broke they still noticed me
Wishing all my teachers could see the older me
Because now I'm living how I'm supposed to be
Always been the fliest bitch low key
Beef with my niggas let them blow thee
But they'll tote heat if any body touch me
Know some niggas touching number of touch screens
Off-White, Raf Simons for spring
I'm a dog who the fuck gon' dog me
Tell a nigga ''get lost don't call me''
You belong with them basic bitches not me

[Interlude: with ad libs]

[Verse: 2]
I'm way past rapping about my feature price
I leveled up, what you think it coast?
All wolves around me no sheep involved
Different cloth, yeah only when the mink involved
They young and they itching for a reason dog
Catch a pussy at the light put your blinkers on
I was up, I was feeling like I needed more
I had to cherish what I had before I sent it gone
Sitting thinking like damn how can I double this
How can I make it trip' how can I flood my wrist
Bubble coat, butter Timbs
In Detroit that's the type shit we hustle in
Play your cards right or get your hand pulled
Lil' Loaf but she a hand full, and she's hands on

[Interlude: with ad libs]

[Verse: 3]
Mink dragging she's spazzing
I ain't never been flat, can't never let nothing slide or pass me
Stop comparing 'cause this shit just different
Please stop gazzing
These bitches before I attack them, came from the bottom
Some days I can not phantom
Wen't from the 'jects to a mansion
Took every L came back a champion
