[Intro]
You left me time
Oooh, ohhh
This from me to you
Oooh, ohhh
Look

[Verse 1]
I really think that you're hot
Let me see what you got (let me see it, let me see it)
How could we make this make sense? (how? how?)
Without looking really crazy
(I ain't trying to look like no fool, you know)
You got a family of your own
And you know my situation
I wouldn't say it if I ain't mean it (wouldn't say, wouldn't say)
Baby, you're so beautiful to me (you're so beautiful to me)
And I wonder what it's like (I wonder, I wonder)
I want to take a risk and see
And I think you feel the same
How you be starin' at me (how you be starin' at me)
(I always catch you looking at me every time, I saw you)
I make love to you all in my head
Why does this feel like some love affair?
I know what I want when I see it
So Imma go, but what I know so be it
I ain't trynna cause no drama
But I can't help how I feel

[Hook]
Butterflies in my stomach
Every time that I see you
Oooh, ohhh
Oooh, ohhh
Every time that I see you

[Verse 2]
Meet me in the lobby (can you meet me downstairs in the lobby, I knock on your door)
In your gym clothes
So nobody knows
I said "can't nobody stop us" (can't nobody stop us)
Not, I stand my ground ten toes (I hold it down for you)
The way you make me feel
Do that thing with your nose (okay, why you keep doing that?)
Baby, look I can show you better than
I can tell you, I want you, I want you, want you
And Imma get you, naw
I ain't trynna cause no drama
But I can't help how I feel

[Hook]
Butterflies in my stomach (butterflies in my stomach)
Every time that I see you
Oooh, ohhh
Oooh, ohhh
Every time that I see you
