[Intro]
Yeah, baby what's the deal, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby what's the deal, yeah, tell me what it hit for
Ride through the trenches, five thousand dollar trench coat
Lowkey, still lookin' like a lick though
Keep staring at me, know I had to get the info
Tell bro chill, said why, he a bitch bro
Got a lot of bags, lot of money gotta get bro
We can't miss bro, we can't miss bro
We gon' ball, let them niggas play bench bro
Why would I stop now, I done came this far
Crew full of pussies, why y'all niggas ridin' dick for?
Numbers don't lie, your bitch a zero
Her ass and her titties fake, what other shit tipped you?
Prayin' on my downfall, I don't miss meals
Made it out the city, I know niggas pissed still
Yeah, I know niggas pissed still
I know niggas pissed still

[Chorus]
We still carry pistols
Cut a few niggas off
Signed a couple new deals
They don't know how it feels
To pay all your mama's bills
Put her in a bigger crib
Why these niggas tryna steal my skills?

[Verse 2]
I thank God, I'm in my right mind now
Money in the stash, put them hundreds on time-out
I'm verified, ain't no suckers on my timeline
Tweet about me, at my name next time
Niggas lame, niggas bitches, niggas tampons
Get a nigga gone, go and get my nails done
Big screen, Scarface, eating salmon
They think I gained some money, shit, I'm at my grandmas
She taught me everything I know
She taught me that all y'all niggas some hoes
She taught me that everything is a go
She taught me don't talk, just blow
I'ma grind and get me some more
I'ma grind and get me some more
They know we got it out the mud
They know we got it out the mud

[Chorus]
We still carry pistols
Cut a few niggas off
Signed a couple new deals
They don't know how it feels
To pay all your mama's bills
Put her in a bigger crib
Why these niggas tryna steal my skills?
