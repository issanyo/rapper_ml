[Verse 1]
Bitch please
Get rolled on, ten speed bike like
You done rolled 100 dicks, bite life
Good night night, you all hype hype
No wife type, I’m on these bitches’ heads like highlights
Fuck your bundles
Let’s talk numbers, let’s talk stats
Why you mumblin’, what’s that?
I ain’t with the tit for tat
I ain’t angry at nobody
I’ll run 100 laps around you pussy motherfuckers
Turn ya'll nigga to a chef
He be like, “What you want for supper?”
I be like a side of this, a side of that, a side of money
Chamomile tea, some lemons, some honey
Slice of that pie
I don’t even eat pie but bake that motherfucker
DeJ a beast, boy
Y’all thought it was over, she gon’ keep going
I’m from the east side, not east point

Pull up in your hood, keep blowing
