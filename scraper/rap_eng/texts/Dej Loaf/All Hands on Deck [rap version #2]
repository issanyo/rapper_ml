[Hook: Tinashe]
All hands on deck
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Wasted heart
When you left me, you left me with no choice
I'm looking for a boy to fill this empty void
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh
Wasted hard
You took the last bit of love I've ever had
You took a good girl and you turned me oh so bad
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh

[Hook]
All hands on deck
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that
All hands on deck
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Wasted hard
Done here's to death do us apart
I watch you fold like a house of cards
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone
One by one, I watch you fall down, watch you fall like dominoes
Take no prisoners, search and destroy
Baby look at what you've done
One by one, I watch 'em go down, watch 'em fall like dominoes
Watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down

[Hook]
All hands on deck
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
I say all hands on deck
Bend it over, beat it up, put your hands on that
If you play your cards right, I can deal with that
I'm a queen, you a king, now let's build with that
Speeding off in the game, ain't nothing the same
I got older and I realized the game, why would I stay the same
Fucking right I changed and you're the one to blame
You're the one who broke me down yeah our love was insane
Whoa, I pull off with my new ones
Girl mad, when I see her she don't do nothing
I ain't looking for beef, I'm looking for freaks
I got so weak in the knees, SWV
I tell that nigga, I tell that nigga, like its nothing to me
You looking for me, I'm over here in VIP, like
Who want to drink, all the drinks on me
Put your hands in the air if you fucking with me

[Verse 4: Tinashe]
And you know that I tried
Really gave my all
Everything that we built
Hey, baby you let it fall, you let it fall
And now you want me
Hey, want me back now
And I think that's so funny
Cause baby I'm long gone, I'm long gone now

[Hook]
All hands on deck
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that

All hands on deck
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that
