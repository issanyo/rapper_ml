[Verse 1: Game]
I'm from the home of the malt liquor, talk slicker
Where guns spark quicker, on fraud niggas
Them niggas better walk with you, take the long way home
My finger itchin' and this barrel so loooong
Like Pinocchio's nose my list of foes grows
Casket closed, air tight like Mystikal's cornrows
Expose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas
Never said shit when they seen me, get your toe tag nigga
The Compton lyricist, you niggas can't get with this
Used to tap Dre on the shoulder like, "Nigga come hear this shit"
He thinkin' he slick and shit, nigga sweeter than licorice
Los Angeles god, we mob like Infamous
Ain't from Queensbridge or Brooklyn but we done shook ones
Bullets, I done took some, crack, I done cook some
Don't you stand there and look dumb
Ain't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come lives, I done took some

[Hook: Sha Sha]
When I look around I hear something tell me
That I’m the type of nigga you could be down for
And I be hearing niggas say they gon’ kill me
And be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on
But I came to let you know I keep that heat for real

[Verse 2: Game]
I kicks in doors when your rap bars is Iggy
I pull up floors and take them charges with me
Aventador as I explore the city
Phillipe's with my henchmen, nigga, word to Jimmy
You could be swimmin’ in the Hudson, it’s nothin’
Think I’m bluffin’? Guns cocked, say somethin’
Ain’t too many real niggas in this here rap shit
The industry soft when Plies getting slammed and shit
I feel like Mayweather in May weather
Whoop the white nigga ass, it might pay better
Got my Timbs on the gas in this grey sweater
Tag Coogi, I bet you’d be more cautious if you knew me
Your girl tryna do me, hoochie, groupie
She tryna catch up on a Gucci, baby, no, I’m out like Karrueche
Gave me that BJ so I slid in that Pizookie
And that’s why I’m the dookie
You fuck me, I’m fucking your bitch, stupid

[Hook: Sha Sha]
When I look around I hear something tell me
That I’m the type of nigga you could be down for
And I be hearing niggas say they gon’ kill me
And be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on
But I came to let you know I keep that heat for real

[Outro: DeJ Loaf & Game]
Dej holla at these niggas for me
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
(Pull up on a nigga like, "uh")
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
(Pull up on a nigga like, "uh")
