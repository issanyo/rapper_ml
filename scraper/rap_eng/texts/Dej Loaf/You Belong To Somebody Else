[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
Can we get a room
And we ain't gotta tell nobody
It's just me, and it's just you
And what we do in here is private
Cut your phone off
Make sure the door is locked
It's midnight gotta leave out by 4 o'clock
Sneaking and freaking it's Friday the weekend
I'm just getting started I don't wanna leave you
I tell you I love you, you know that I mean it
You beating it up and I'm bobbing and weaving
We fucking all night to the morning and evening
Gotta lay pipe until we get even

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
I'm in and out loving your moans
Hands on your waist I do the most
Giving you time girl I done did that
You say my name when I'm hitting it
I never let the past come back
Dej you know you got that come back

[Hook: Dej Loaf & Jacquees]
I know you really, really want it
But you belong to somebody else
Both, wanna be together
But we can't act on it
Cause you belong to somebody else

To somebody else
But you belong to somebody else
Yeah I know
How bad we both want it
Fuck our logic seize the moment

[Interlude: Jacquees & (Dej Loaf)]

(I am outta the country)
Man, quit lying man where you at?

(Nah, I'm just kidding, I'm in Atlanta)
Well I'm bout to come pick you up
I know I ain't seen you in a minute
Yo my bad for that last situation
And I ain't never mean for none of that to go down like that
I know you still think I'm fucking with this girl and that girl
But nah I ain't doing none of that
Won't put you in a bad situation know it
And Dej you already know how you make me feel
So I'm finna come
(Hmph... Right now?)
Yeah right now
(Alright pull up)
Alright bet

[Hook X2: Dej Loaf & Jacquees]
I know you really, really want it
But you belong to somebody else
Both, wanna be together
But we can't act on it
Cause you belong to somebody else

To somebody else
But you belong to somebody else
Yeah I know
How bad we both want it
Fuck our logic seize the moment
