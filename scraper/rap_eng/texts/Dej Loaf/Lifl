Yeah, yeah
C-C-Clayton William

[Verse 1: Jonn Hart]
Girl take it easy (easy)
Don't make this hard, I got you hooked from the start
That shit just caught you off guard
You don't believe it (you don't believe it)
I thought you know, straight from the door to the floor
This how it's always gon' go
I told you slow down baby (slow down baby)
But you didn't wanna slow down baby (you didn't wanna slow down baby)
Now you wanna buss down daily (buss down daily)
Now you say you wanna have my baby, you so crazy
Stuck in your feelings and I'm gone
Always be hitting my phone
Give you the dick now I'm wrong
Now you don't wanna leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus: Jonn Hart]
I make it hard to breathe, when I'm dipping on that body
She on top of me, you gon' feel it for the moment
Got you beggin' me, now you scratchin' on your body
Just one time with me, yeah

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
I'ma make you love it for life
I'ma make you love it (love it)
I'ma make you love it, girl
I'ma make you love it (woah)

I'ma make you love it for life
I'ma make you love it (love it)
I'ma make you love it, girl
I'ma make you love it (woah)
I'ma make you love it for life

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
Oh na na na na na na
How would you feel making me your lover
One night is all it takes
I'd be glad to be the one to tell you pause your breaks, yeah
If it gets too outta hand
Body to body [?]
Cheek to cheek, you need a freak
I plead the fifth, we in the streets
He's a beast I need a key to lock it down
Please belive I need it now, you're a tease don't be
Lick between, suck on these, she's bomb like TNT
We can sex, we can weed, top smoking like cheminee
Bitin' on me, baby kiss on me
Let's fuck for life, eternity
Return my love, don't dip on me

[Pre-Chorus: Jonn Hart]
I make it hard to breathe, when I'm dipping on that body
She on top of me, you gon' feel it for the moment
Got you beggin' me, now you scratchin' on your body
Just one time with me, yeah

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
I'ma make you love it for life
I'ma make you love it (love it)
I'ma make you love it, girl
I'ma make you love it (woah)

I'ma make you love it for life
I'ma make you love it (love it)
I'ma make you love it, girl
I'ma make you love it (woah)
I'ma make you love it for life

[Bridge: DeJ Loaf & Jonn Hart]
I be on the scene with a flashlight
I be looking for you with a beam and the spotlight
I be having dreams think I seen you in my past life
I'm really into you I ain't do it for no brag rights
I be [?] like I did last night
I be tripping now when I really wanna act right
I be on the script and you don't need no re-writes

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
I'ma make you love it (love it)
I'ma make you love it, girl
I'ma make you love it (woah)
I'ma make you love it for life

I'ma make you love it (love it)
I'ma make you love it, girl
I'ma make you love it (woah)
I'ma make you love it for life


[Outro: DeJ Loaf & Jonn Hart]
Oh na na na na na na
I'ma make you love it
Oh na na na na na na
I'ma make you love it, girl
Oh na na na na na na
I'ma make you love it
Oh na na na na na na

Woah, woah, oh
