[Verse 1]
All my niggas throw them 4s up
This ain't a game, watch all my niggas load up
I don't smoke, but baby roll up
Henny cups on all that ice, bitch I'm froze up
All these lames keep talkin' like they know us
Fake rappers, we'll pull you off your tour bus
I don't wanna do no songs or do no features with 'em
I ain't no groupie, I don't wanna take no pictures either
I'm glad I bossed up all my old hoes
Comment on my pictures like they're happy for me, no sir
And your main bitch ain't fuckin' with me
Tell a nigga like boss up, come get this money with me
Dej Loaf, bitch I'm self made
IBGM, come get signed, bitch I'm self paid
I said I made myself a boss
Money in the mattress, we got bricks all in the loft

[Hook]
They say they love my swag, damn that girl be swaggin'
Why would she be spazzin'? Actin' like an asshole
I don't know, I don't know
Somebody, I don't, I don't know
Say they love my swag, damn that girl be swaggin'
Why would she be spazzin'? Actin' like an asshole
I don't know, I don't know
Somebody, I don't, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Get you gone for a dub before I take a loss
Free my niggas, they touch down, yo we takin' off
I can't believe they took my daddy from me
20 years, I just went and got him tatted on me
Catch them pussies, we gon' spazz all on 'em
I ain't forgivin' 'em, they fucked up my family, homie
Bow, to the head
Lord forgive me, let us bow our heads
I'm just lookin' in the sky line
It's after labor day, she still got on all white
Watch them haters, they be lookin' out their side eye
All black, we in them coupes, it's a drive by
You only lie when you fear, that's why I don't lie
Cause at the end of the day we all gotta die
Someway, somehow
That's why I laugh, and I smile

[Bridge]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
