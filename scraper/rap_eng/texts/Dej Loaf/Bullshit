[Intro]
Y'all niggas on bullshit
All y'all put out is bullshit
My niggas be on full tilt
Standin' on the couches, on bullshit (Woah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Y'all niggas be on bullshit (Yeah)
All y'all put out is bullshit (Bullshit)
My niggas be on full tilt
Standing on the couches, on bullshit (Yeah)
Your bitch, she bullshit (Facts)
And that jewelry is bullshit
Got so much ice on my arm, I'm catchin' bruises
All these niggas bitin' my sound, I ain't stupid (Woah)
Don't be alarmed, car don't come with alarm
It come with lil' Uzi (Woah)
Been a couple years since I fell in love
I'm just tryna dodge Cupid (Woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bentley couple, lose the roof
I had it up to here, I'm 'bout to raise the roof
These bitches takin' shots, they 'bout to make me shoot
You gotta pick a side, you better not make me choose (Woah)

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas on bullshit
All y'all put out is bullshit
My niggas be on full tilt
Standin' on the couches, on bullshit (Woah, woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
I can't be in bitches' face, I can't be fakin' no smiles
I can't wrapped up in no label, I done figured it out
'Cause they wouldn't give a fuck if I died tomorrow
I put my music on my back and on my unborn child
God told me, he said "DeJ, start speakin' your mind
If you the best, say you the best then put some proof behind it
You a queen, you shoulda been in Wakanda
Any bitch want steam, tell 'em we gon' iron her" (Press 'em)
I'm borin', I don't party none
But when I do, I step out and I Tom my Ford
I Off my White, Dior my bitch, adore yours
I don't got no friends, I don't need four doors

[Pre-Chorus]
Bentley couple, lose the roof
I had it up to here, I'm 'bout to raise the roof
These bitches takin' shots, they 'bout to make me shoot (From Detroit's west side)
You gotta pick a side, you better not make me choose (Woah)

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas on bullshit
All y'all put out is bullshit
My niggas be on full tilt
Standin' on the couches, on bullshit (Woah, woah, woah, woah)

[Outro]
Woah
From Detroit's west side
