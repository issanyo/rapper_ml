[Intro]
I be done killed me a nigga trying to take something away that I worked hard for
This is what I grind for

[Hook]
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?

[Verse 1]
N-n-n-n-no, how can I sell my soul?
The devil be near, but I’m far too strong
I know my right from wrong, I know what’s going on
Them niggas they want us to fail
But we cannot, we just gotta prevail
We got it
Bad bitch karma, in a red dress
I’m really from Detroit, what the fuck you expect?
Keep what you stole, reap what you sow
Word on the street niggas got sent home
Don’t dial my phone, I’m booked
Free lil bro, he booked
Fake ass niggas been faking too long
We see ho niggas, they shook
Watch ‘bout 50, bitch look
That’s cuz right there, he a crook
We ain’t tryna act tough, we just tryna get paid
See with y’all, see it’s all about the look
We can go song for song, whatever you want
Dome for dome
Knock knock, pop up at your home
Don’t touch the kids or the wife, just get that chump
But if the bitch get smart, hell, give her the pump

[Hook]
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?

[Verse 2]
Don’t let this life fool you
Don’t let this shit get you
Don’t let this life fool you
Don’t let this shit get you
You can tell that she got a lot of pain in her
Tryna hide it but she on her third hangover
This week, ain’t shit sweet, game over
See she ain’t really want the fame, it just came with it
We ain’t have AC, had fans in the window
Now I ride through your city, wave at fans out the window
From the city where the chopper gave you ten in window
In the summertime hit, and your mans ain’t with you like damn
Like damn, where my nigga go?
Too many funerals over these hoes
Can’t fall victim, had to get up and go
Change had to come or somebody had to go
They’ll do any little thing for that paper
I done seen it, I done chased it
I done got it, and I’ll be damned if they take it

[Hook]
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to die for it?

[Outro]
To die for it
To die for it
To die for it
To die for it
