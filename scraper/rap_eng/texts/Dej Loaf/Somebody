[Verse 1]
Is he fucking or not?
I said you opened the block
He be throwing up diamonds like he fuck with The Rock
I be throwin'  all these signs
Do you get it or not?
I heard he has a little bitch, I ain't trippin' on that
Tonight, I don't really want any strings attached
He a fly ass nigga, got wings attached
I seen what he do, plus he seen me rap
Winked his eye, meet me in the back
Hopped in the Jag, now we on the dash
Told him to slow down, he diminuted fast
Pulled up to the crib, I'll give him my ass
Telling me he been wanting me since we was in class
He got a real big deal and a tongue to match
I got some shit up my sleeve that will make a mess
Open up the door, we let the music blast
Round one ain't over let's make it last

[Hook]
Tonight, I wanna love somebody
Tonight, I wanna love your body
Tonight, I want somebody to feel this love
Tonight, I wanna love somebody
Tonight, I wanna love your body
Are you that somebody to feel this love?
Tonight, I wanna love somebody
Tonight, I'm wanna love your body
Are you that somebody to feel this love?
Feel this (Lllooooovvvveee owwwovve)
Are you that somebody to feel this love?
Feel this  (Lllooooovvvveee owwwovve)

[Verse 2]
Feel this love, I gotchu open now
I can see it's 'bout to go, go down
You think we done?, I'm thinking one more round
Lay your ass down, let me put my bag down
Don't look me in my eyes, cause that's that shit I like
The shit so good, make me wanna have a baby by him
He had a crazy body, I think I'm crazy 'bout him
Just for tonight, I wanna hold him tight like it's my money

[Hook]

Ohhhwahhooo
