[Verse]
Go Grizz, when I say go
Hey, hey-ey
I've been on my hustle
It ain't too many people I look up to
I've been grinding, I've been grinding
I've been grinding, I've been grinding
I've been grinding
Look, I've been on my grind all week
I ain't been getting no sleep
But that shit don't matter to me
My momma said "it should matter to me"
She said "your health is everything"
Right Momma look, momma I've been road running
I just signed a few deals and the shows coming
I can't let my fans down, I gotta run it up
I can't let a bitch catch me, fuck a runner up
I said "lets turn the summer up"
All these other girls quiet, word to my mother
Man I put that on the Bible
All this gossip gossip people talking, man they got me fucked up
They want to see me down, broke back on my luck
I don't trust nobody rather do it on my own
Get them squares out yo circle, leave them pussy boys alone
Leave them pussy boys alone
Niggas with hidden agendas, I hope you offended
Cut the middle man out, I need all of my inches
Cause niggas don't have passion, they just in it to fit in
I'm really in this shit to finish, niggas goofy they grinning too much
Get the fuck out my business
A lot of these niggas, they was raised like hoes
You ain't gotta be a killer to get my respect, pussy nigga
Ay just play yo role, you boys shaped like hoes
Y'all hate like hoes, we move different ain't like those
We ain't gon' fold fold, we ain't gon' lose fall
We ain't gon' fail, we ain't gon snitch
We ain't gon tell, nigga
(Why would we do that, huh? You gotta ask yourself)
Look, I done been broke before I ain't going back (naw)
Lil bro just came home he said "he ain't going back"
So I gotta protect him, I feel like I've been neglected
Ready for change but don't wanna work in no register
So, just imagine all that pressure on me
Man, this shit is chess not checkers homie
Can't get to you, we'll probably get your homie
Don't get stuck in living in the moment
I was raised by real niggas no Jabronis
Said I was raised by real niggas no jeroni
I'm a living legend nigga Kony Kony
Ridin' with the woo, got my Kony Tony
Tony, Toni Braxton, or Anita Baker
Left wrist skating, diamonds dancing like Jamaica
I keep a couple niggas, but ain't got a lot of patience
If I want it, Imma take it, ain't trynna sound like no rapist
I be in the D, bake potatoes all like papers
I know why niggas mad cause I never need they favors
And I still rock the with bucks, I ain't never had a trainer
Miami beach trippin' got the doors off the wranglers
Times get hard, old friends call you stranger
But I ain't even change, I just bossed up and made it
You should be happy, you should want to do the same shit
A boss is way more than just giving out a paycheck
No music, couple old friends turnin' the bases
I'm getting closer to God, I'm getting back to the basics
I've been had the vision since That's So Raven
And I never needed to said things, I knew I was greater
If I stayed the same, they would've love it
Performing in my room to performing out in public
It's 2k15, niggas score getting buckets bucket
Let them pussies have it, make it feel it in they stomach, nigga
(We gon' make them feel it every single time, every time. I mean why not?)
(It feel like, I've been waiting my fucking life for this)
I've been on my grind all week (I ain't going back)
I ain't been getting no sleep
But that shit don't matter to me
(I'm trynna fuckin' win man)
