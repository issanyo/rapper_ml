[Verse 1]
Money train, money bags, I get money fast
Money came, if the money go I wonder who gon’ last
I hit the money dance, these my money pants
Got 30 Gs in these
40 in my bag, I don’t like to walk with cash
I change your life, come spend the night
I ain’t gon’ ask you twice
I asked you once
You with her? Ok wrap it up
I’m in the cut, I’m cutting up
Let’s go get brunch
He like my eyes, so he hate it when I wear my buffs
I’m looking good
Hater bitches gonna pucker up
Kiss my ass
Pressure’s on, the pressure’s up
I'm on the move, I’d be a fool to let ‘em catch up
Fuck next up, I’m blessed up
I got heart, that’s chest up
I’m a don, see
I got snakes all on my head, Don see
Niggas say they want their bread, well let’s meet
Get it in blood, get it from cuz

[Hook]
I can’t let ‘em stop me, I can’t let ‘em hold me back now
I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down
I got to keep going and going, keep going
I got to keep going and going, keep going

[Hook]
I can’t let ‘em stop me, I can’t let ‘em hold me back now
I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down
I got to keep going and going, keep going
I got to keep going and going, keep going

[Verse 2]
Washed up, mama’s boy
Nigga pick them suds
Take the trash out, you a little ass boy
They was making jokes like, “She a little ass boy”
But they niggas in my DMs and I’m starting to get annoyed
I hate liars pussy nigga, tell the whole story
How much for a feature, I don’t know, ask Joy
Niggas play victim, my niggas play with toys
Catch them niggas slippin’, have them shook, all noid
Don’t say that it ain’t worth it, some shit that you gotta avoid
But my grandma she a G so it’s a must I keep it going
Expose you to the world, niggas lamer than I thought
I knew I was gon’ shine, I felt that in that drought
I knew who I was at six years old
Looking in the mirror like I can’t die poor
I gotta go
Beams everywhere, narcs kick in our doors
They say death come in three
I’m like so do these hoes, hold up

[Hook]
I can’t let ‘em stop me, I can’t let ‘em hold me back now
I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down
I got to keep going and going, keep going
I got to keep going and going, keep going

[Hook]
I can’t let ‘em stop me, I can’t let ‘em hold me back now
I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down
I got to keep going and going, keep going
I got to keep going and going, keep going

[Hook]
I can’t let ‘em stop me, I can’t let ‘em hold me back now
I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down
I got to keep going and going, keep going
I got to keep going and going, keep going

[Hook]
I can’t let ‘em stop me, I can’t let ‘em hold me back now
I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down
I got to keep going and going, keep going
I got to keep going and going, keep going
