[Verse]
I seen you first, you was looking at the way I move, yea yea
I made that move, I couldn't resist, i'm no fool, yea yea
I knew what I was doing, I had my eyes on you all night
Caught you by yourself, you've been with your crew all night
Leave your girl, we've been creeping at the beach around 2 all night
When she calls you and pick up, (hello) cause I dont do all of that
Feels so wrong, I wonder why do fools fall in love
Can't help myself, I'm drunk, I done had three shots of that
They dreaming, going back to Cali, with the rooftop missing
I know you see me, looking like a million dollars, I said oh get back to me
Baby where you at? Looking for me, I've been looking for you actually
But on a [?], I don't care, long as you asking me

[Bridge]
Why do fools fall in love
Why do fools fall in love
Why do foo-oo-ools fall in love
Why do foo-oo-ools fall in love

[Chorus](x11)
Yodale-hee-hoo, Yodale, Yodale-Hee-Hoo, yea yea
Yodale-hee-hoo...
