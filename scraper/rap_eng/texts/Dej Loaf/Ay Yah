[Intro]
Money Money

[Hook]x3
Money Money Money Money Money
I'm steady trying to get it like, like, like
Ay Yah, Ay Yah, Ay Yah, Ay Yah
Ay Yah, Ay Yah, Ay Yah

[Verse]
It's like cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money its like Dollar Dollar Bill, Yall
Loafers, everythings kosher Kazelle Frank shotty
Dreams getting closer, I'm a soldier
Never been a bragger or a boaster
But lately I've burning a lot of bread, no toaster
Focus, yeah I left that bullshit alone
Bitches wasn't real so I stopped answering the phone
Getting right with God, cause real talk I'm a God
I was dead broke and it was all because of pride
I'm alive money on my mind, for my team I'mma ride
I ain't worried bout the drive, it's time to go get it and grind
Put them people to the side, wait and let them see you shine
They gon' hate but that's life, you live it and take flights
Doing shows every night, thanking god for the life
I earn my stripes, I'm a boss, started cutting people off
Talking shit and drinking Voss, don't ask me what it cost
Real talk, this that shit you play in your loft
We trying take it so far you rolling get in the car
They rolling it in the car, no smoking but keep a jar
I never thought small, I loved everything large
Started coming up head blue like mars
I started coming up stay humble couldn't fumble
These niggas talk cash, but all I hear is mumble
So I ain't really trying hear it, I'm really trying to bubble like

[Hook]x2

[Outro]
Cash rules everything around me
Cream get the money its like Dollar Dollar Bill, Yall
And if you steady trying to get it like
Let me hear you say
Ay Yah, Ay Yah, Ay Yah, Ay Yah
Ay Yah, Ay Yah, Ay Yah
