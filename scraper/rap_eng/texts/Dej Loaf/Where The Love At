[Intro]
I ain't seen no love
I ain't heard no love
Where the Love at
Tell me Where The Love at
Where The Love at.. tell me where the love at
Where the Love at?

[Hook]x2
Where the Love At
How you love that?
Where the kisses and the hugs at
Nigga we don't want that, say fuck that
Leave a nigga in a blood bath
All you niggas suspect, we don't trust that
All yall bums get the fuck back, before I push your skull back

[Verse 1]
Where my thugs at
Burn a nigga like a sun tan
Make a nigga just run fast, make him do the fun dance
No rush make him come fast, On-demand like Comcast
I'm finna blow that's a bomb threat
Your team weaker than the bobcats
Lil DeJ from the projects, getting money with my con rads
Keep it 100 or keep to yourself
IBGM on the front of my shirt
Niggas want deals but don't put in the work
Disrespect me and get put on a shirt
Cause I know some shooters that put in the work
Half-Court shots, be fucking berserk
Shooting and scoring, weapon and touring
City to city my fan base is growing
Got on all white, with the [?]
Looking like a million views on YouTube
I know this that shit that you ain't used to
But if you fucking with me then get used to it
This how it gotta be, ball on the opposite
All yall weak rappers fuck up the economy
Won't do no features cause niggas is bleachers
I'm just on my papers, fuck all my old teachers

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2]
IBGM that's the sact claim
That ain't no game, thats a Lifestyle
These niggas walking around with these big balls
But still living all the classic ass lifestyles
Ain't wanna see me do it, but I did it
Can't pay me for a verse I'm offended
Comparing me to who? I'm the sickest
From the style, from the smile, to the lyrics
Sell Sole, yeah bitch shit serious
Only key to real bitches in the tenants
Every time we show up, yall absent
Off the henny but I ain't no Alchy
And I don't give a fuck cause I be healthy
In the strip club throwing up Jacksons
Don't hang around Latoyas or Janets
I'm the hardest rap bitch on the planet

[Hook]x2
