[Hook] [x2]
Did it on my own, didn’t need nobody
Came up on my own, didn’t need nobody
Got it out the mud, didn’t need nobody
One thing about me, nigga, I don’t owe nobody

[Verse 1]
They say who the realest? I don’t hear nobody
Watch how you’re speaking on me, get hit with this shotty
I got some shooters in the back, they’re off them mollies
And I ain’t tryna act tough, I’m really bout it
I don’t want that boy, I’d rather have his daddy
One thing about me, ain’t none of these niggas had me
I’m consistent with this shit, I make my own flips
I write my own flows, I whip my own shit
Boss slave, got levels, Ballys on the pedal
Switching lanes, blowing kisses at you fucking devils
Grinding hard for this shit, niggas know me better
Don’t be a bitter nigga, go and get your shit together

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tell all these niggas if they want this money
They gon’ have to take it from me
Working hard, paper on me like a mummy
Thumbing through that cheque, got me feeling like a junkie
Said, “they gon’ love me ‘fore it’s over with”
They gon’ love me ‘fore it’s over with
These bitches hoping that I’m gonna quit
But I ain’t stopping till it’s over with
Love life live, my niggas doing biz
I’m just out here tryna get it, that’s the way it is
Feeling like a boss, so I employ my friends
Real niggas ball together, fuck fake friends
