[Chorus x2]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body

[Verse 1]
Bro Kome get your girl I swear she borin
Said you a lame she said you snorin
Blowing up my phone all night and mornin
Just pass her to the team so we scorin

Niggas act up and get a buck fifty
Pump out, have your mans like run Ricky
Fully Auto or the Semi
Squeeze shit till the klip empty

I can't trust some bitches these bitches krazy
Smoking on that loud yeah it got me Hazy
Riding thru a block where some niggas hate me
All about my paper so that shit don't faze me

Why You bitches chattin like yall don't know me
Kome from '65 yeah that's where my home be
I'm from Shiesty Side where they took the Homie
I started off with nothin came up by my lonely

These thotties really love me yea they all on me
But I Kant wife a ho throw her to the homies
YNE my squad I swear I love my Brodie's
Fuck them fu bang niggas man they all phony

I'm only 14 and I'm stackin chicken
All my shit legit I don't play the kitchen
Pyrex on the stove and they water whippin
Rapping or the block this was my decision

Ride or Die chick that'll drill with me
Catch us in all black then we ridin filthy
On a paper hunt since my pockets empty
Imma keep on grinding till these niggas kill me
