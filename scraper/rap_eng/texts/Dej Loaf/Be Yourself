[Verse 1: Oba Rowland]
Big ass smile on your bitch ass
Chevy crown on your bitch ass
Coming down on your bitch ass
Run my town, your bitch ass
7 Mile and your bitch ass
Living on your bitch ass
Kill a boy and your bitch ass
You ain't [?] and your bitch ass
Middle class and your bitch ass
Mom and Dad and your bitch ass
Taught right from wrong and your bitch ass
Taught how to love with your bitch ass
9-5 and your bitch ass
Still selling dimes and your bitch ass
Foster child and your bitch ass
This my life and your bitch ass, nigga

[Hook: DeJ Loaf]
Why would want to be like them
Let go and just free yourself
Real niggas don't need no help
I love it when you be yourself

[Post- Hook: DeJ Loaf (Oba Rowland)]
Be Yourself (Love it when you be yourself)
Be Yourself
Be Yourself (I love it when you be yourself)
Be Yourself (Love it when you be yourself)
Be Yourself

[Verse 2: Oba Rowland]
Never cheated on your bitch ass
Bet you heated with your bitch ass
Your boyfriend weak and his bitch ass
Bought my CD with your bitch ass
Can't run from me and your bitch ass
No Degree on your bitch ass
My shit don't stink, it smell like potpourri on your bitch ass
Fuck what yall think, I'm off that ocean breeze and your bitch ass
You stuck in place, can't get close to me with your bitch ass
Never tuck my chain, cause I'm sucka free on your bitch ass
Hoes love my name, you don't even know what it means with your bitch ass, nigga
