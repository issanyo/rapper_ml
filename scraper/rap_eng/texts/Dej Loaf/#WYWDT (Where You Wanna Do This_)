[Hook: Guordan Banks]
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?

We can do it in the shower
Bend you over on the counter
We can move it to the sofa
Baby when you coming over?
She got me like ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?

[Verse 1: Guordan Banks]
I slipped her my number
I'm hoping that she call me back
There's something about her
Think I had a heart attack
Whole night long I think she touch me
Saying that she want to sex me
Baby girl tonight, come dress me
Put it on me, make me say

[Hook: Guordan Banks]
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?

We can do it in the shower
Bend you over on the counter
We can move it to the sofa
Baby when you coming over?
She got me like ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
Baby scream my name, ease the pain
This shit gon' make me leave my man
I was plotting for a while now, god damn
Can't explain how it feel with you inside though
Meet me after the club
We can leave and make love
In the whip, got both legs up
You ain't never had no pussy like this

[Hook: Guordan Banks]
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?

We can do it in the shower
Bend you over on the counter
We can move it to the sofa
Baby when you coming over?
She got me like ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?

[Bridge: DeJ Loaf]
Scream my name, scream my name
Scream my name, take my name
Scream my name, scream my name
Scream my name, take my name

[Hook: Guordan Banks]
We can do it in the shower
Bend you over on the counter
We can move it to the sofa
Baby when you coming over?
She got me like ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
Ooh, where you wanna do this?
And where you wanna do this at?
