[Intro]
Now get 'er done
Off the top
Yeah, yeah
Ayo [?] why you killing these niggas man

[Verse 1]
Bad bitch
I say center fold
I ain't got to toke guns
That's why my niggas for
And they gon' pop a nigga dead in the street
Got no asses when the feds takin' pics
Nigga tripping, money dead on my list
My niggas tripping, that's a bed, that's your bitch
Pussy shaking, gettin' head in the crib
That's how I live, money thousand on my chit
Got college tuition on me, I'm school
Nas and Belly nigga, that's my move
Tommy buns, house so white
Making players, why Keesha want to fight?
Calling shots, got me feeling all right
Keep pushing, yeah the pussy tight
You can't get it when you see em' watch it bite
She ain't your friend, she fucked your man twice

[Hook 1]
That bitch ain't nothing but a hoe
That bitch ain't nothing but a hoe
I said that bitch ain't nothing but a hoe
That bitch ain't nothing but a hoe

[Verse 2]
That bitch ain't nothing but a hoe
Your nigga ain't nothing but a scrub
Anybody I had, I made them fall in love (with me)
Niggas making threats
Why worry 'bout it?
Who's going to do something would've done it
I ain't worry 'bout it
I'm the realest in this shit
I'm for sure about it
Nigga try me, I hope you got insurance 'bout it
I got on all this silk
Bitch, I'm body, body
Oh, Like I'm here, baby [?]
I'm from Detroit, I swear this is my sport
They wonder how I got it
I ain't really have a choice

[Interlude]
I was broke
It wasn't no joke

[Verse 3]
She got me crying, she got me stressed
I had to get fear off my chest
My Grandma wasn't a hoe
Same [?] got a rep
I walked around the game
Like boy I fucked the ref
Chopper boy I miss you
Rest in peace Dext

[Hook 2]
Swear these niggas hoes (I swear to god)
Swear this niggas hoes (I swear to god)
I said I swear to God these niggas hoes
All they do is run their mouth

[Verse 4]
What the fuck I look like?
Ashanti, "Foolish?"
Get money, save money
I ain't Jewish
I might be off the henny
But Cam got the tooly
Are you stupid?
Pow bitch, move it
(Get the fuck out the way)
