[Verse 1: Oba Rowland]
Ever since I was a young nigga
I always knew I'd be the one nigga
These hoes choose who they want nigga
But come through and they love a nigga
West side, where I'm from nigga
Holding down my side of town
Niggas talk slick when I'm not around
When I come back it's not a sound
Cause they know
I've been through it all to get these Franklins
Cause money make these hoes change up their behavior
I just bought some dough and called my savior
Still ain't even catching all my favors
I feel good, yeah I feel like I made it
My bitch is double cup and I don't mean she drinking
Nigga I'm so thankful, these niggas ain't us
And a young nigga got his bank up

[Hook: Oba Rowland (DeJ Loaf)]x2
Gone pop that pussy for a real nigga (real nigga)
Gone tell your friends you found a trill nigga (you found one)
You found a real nigga (found one)
You found a trill nigga (you found one)

[Verse 2: Oba Rowland]
Why can't I stop looking at your body
Girl I hope that you don't hurt nobody
Trapping all day, almost caught a body
Where my girls decide they love to party
I got all my day ones right beside me
Balling with no jobs, I roll with tommies
In the VIP where you can find me
It's so hard to stay lowkey from cameras
Tryna hide the hammer in my pants nigga
Hoping TMZ dont catch the wrong angle, cause its obvious I'm the man, nigga
I guess being me, ain't that hard as it must seem, yes niggas might think
Look at my drink, sipping Ice tea, girl [?] go, from the white tee
Girl you can grab you drink, I'mma grab that ass
Then back to the sweets so I can tap that ass
Pop that ass like Michael Jackson
This is thug love, I'm not romancing
I'm a kinda of a bud from a different fabric
I fuck once, I turn you nasty
Anything I touch, turns to a classic
You ain't found one until you had me

[Hook: Oba Rowland (DeJ Loaf)]x3
