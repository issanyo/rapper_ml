[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
Never, never been a lightweight
Bitch, I always been a heavyweight
Don't never call me Mayweather
I promise I can do it better
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know what it is
Soon as you pull up, sex is what it is
Don't you ask no questions
This could be a blessing, yeah
Two shots got me feeling myself
No telling what I'd do with my hands
Specially if they play my jam, might end up between you legs
I might just take you with me
Yeah, you know I'm a freak, yeah
