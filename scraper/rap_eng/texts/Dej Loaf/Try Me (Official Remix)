[Intro: Jeezy]
My Eastside niggas, my [?] niggas, my PA niggas
Got shooters on the Westside and the Southwest
Ask 'em what the target is, they say it's yo' chest nigga

[Hook: DeJ Loaf] (x2)
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'mma get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin' with nobody
Fuck around and I'mma catch a body

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'mma have this muhfucka singin' like a hostage
If I ever took two slugs to the body
Just promise me you'll put some Avion in my IV
What you know about that broad day in the morning?
Nigga come and split ya melon, nigga, while you yawnin'
Make a pretzel out ya auntie house just to get yo' cuz' nigga
Got mine off the stove, I ain't fuckin' wit' no oven nigga
I was raised in the field, I ain't got no chill
Still ridin' wit' that *click* like I ain't got no deal
I'm in love with the coco, [?]
See this why I told my wrist, these bitches watch it like it's porno
From where they finger fuck that F&H just like it's a freaky bitch
12 watchin' surveillance tape just like it's a freaky flick
Where we at, they count they money, now Tommy in the club
Told my nigga "Grab them choppers nigga don't forget ya glove"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
Tommys, macks and choppers bring that bitch up out him
Shoes cost a fortune, so watch where you walking
While she be gettin' fly, bitch I do this often
We be cuttin' up in traffic but we often dolphins
Leave a nigga swimmin', have yo' funeral in that ocean
They say "DeJ got the juice", yeah I got that potion, whoa
And I keep that nine on me so play crazy, it's fine with me
Choppers scream, you go down on me, whoh
I'll get her on my song, I was just like "free Remy"
All these bitches throwin' shots, come get you some free Henny, eh
Whoa, where she find that? She ain't signed yet
She ain't competing with these hoes, it ain't no contest

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Just let a nigga try me, bet I'll be
Wit' a school bus full of muhfuckas ridin'
Wit' extended magazines on 'em right beside me
Fully automatic cami but it ain't gon' hide me
But I promise I'll be damned I let a nigga rob me
I'd die myself to see y'all dead, I'm a kamikaze
But I'm stylin' and retarded, get ya car hit, yeah
Gon' let a broad get ya and ya bodyguard hit
Yeah, cause won't be nothin' to talk about
No use in calling all these people askin' how to squash it now
Aye, you violate, we demonstrate
Nigga Hustle Gang over everything
I ain't like them niggas anyway
Aye, they bankroll is my dinner plate
See a fuck nigga on the interstate
I'll fire his ass up then get away
And full circle, yeah my patience may be tarnished
But my chopper and my G-code, they stay polished
So just let a nigga

[Hook]
