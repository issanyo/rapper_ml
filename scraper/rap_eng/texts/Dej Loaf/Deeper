[Intro: Jacquees]
I gotta see what's up (I gotta see)
See what's up (I gotta see)

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Girl I got a question what it's gonna be?
Do you think there's a chance for you and me?
Heard a lot of people say you into me
I can't lie I'm drunk just off your chemistry
Pick me up on a bad day
Showing love to the family
Keeping up with your fan page
You know love ain't no bad thang
I know it's some girls that's gonna feel this
But that's alright Imma take my shot
And I bet I won't miss
That's somethin I want
Stop where you at don't do somethin I won't
Your friends and my niggas they go crazy
Say I got you fucked up, I'm in love with Ms. Lady
You know I been feeling you lately

[Hook: Jacquees]
You're about yours, that's somethin I know
We need time to be alone
Music loud, blowing speakers
Feel our love gettin deeper
And deeper and deeper
I'm tryna go deeper
Girl let me go deeper
I wanna go deeper, yeah
She want me to go deeper, yeah
We gonna go deeper, yeah
Don't care what them people say

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
You hit my phone I got your message
I'm not tryna curve ya I see your effort
If we take our time this will be special
Why you gotta be so extra? (and aggressive)
Im feelin you too, it's just too much pressure
Don't you-Don't you-Don't you let up
It's gonna make sense in a minute
Ain't been in love in a minute
Imma let the rumors go, let em finish
Sometimes what you're looking for is right up in your face
Don't go chasin waterfalls
God put me in your space and Imma believer
I should stop runnin, no more teasin
Cause you gave me more than 25 reasons

[Hook: Jacquees & Dej Loaf]
You're about yours, that's somethin I know
We need time to be alone
Music loud, blowing speakers
Feel our love gettin deeper
And deeper and deeper
I'm tryna go deeper
Girl let me go deeper
I wanna go deeper, yeah
She want me to go deeper, yeah
We gonna go deeper, yeah
Don't care what them people say
