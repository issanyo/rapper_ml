[Verse]
Man, these shoes cost me a couple thousand
And I still stay at home with my mama
All white, bitch I’m out here like Osama
If they want me they gon’ have to come and find me
Park the whip, got a ticket on my tint
Got a temper out this world
Please don’t stunt on me, I’ll flip
I’m the shit, got you pissed
Bout it, bout it, feel the silk
And these [?] white as fuck
Vitamin D, yeah, they milk
You lookin’ like the help, I look like I can help
I look like I can cook, all white just like a chef
These niggas want to be rich but I’d rather have the wealth
Cause rich don’t last forever, I can’t live no check to check
So I invest, make it stretch, all these groupies at my neck
You a rat, now you trapped, get your goofy ass back
Send a text’ll get you whacked if you ever disrespect
Hold your thought, eat this TEC
Do more, talk less
