[Intro: Jesse Boykins III]
Packed the gun but left all of the bullets
You lost your aim so don't you dare pull it
I'll help you find your way
You know you want to stay
Like yesterday
And today
Come close, come close, come close

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody
Can please your body
The way that I please you
Nobody can do what I do to ya
I stay true to ya
Your body
Like nobody

[Verse 1: Jesse Boykins III]
You've been on a mission, ya
Making rash decisions, oh
I can't be replaced love
Don't give her away love
I'm far out in space come here
I know you is the missin' piece
I know you are apart of me
This ain't no he say, she say
Your body's oh so friendly
For you to (?)
Your passion's see through
And I know you
Know I know what to do
Know just what to do
So when desire calls
It's up to you, it's up to you

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody
Can please your body
The way that I please you
Nobody can do what I do to ya
I stay true to ya
Your body
Like nobody

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
Can't nobody do my body like you do it
And nobody can do your body like I do it
What I do to ya (can't nobody do it)
I stay true to ya
Can't nobody do your body like me
So good, (so good), make you feel so good
So good, good
(Good yeah)
So good
I can't help myself
So good

[Outro]
Can't nobody do your body like I do
So good
