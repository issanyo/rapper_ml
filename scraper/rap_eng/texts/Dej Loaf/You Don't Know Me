[Intro]
I'm from down by the way
I'm from down by the way
I'm from down by the way
I'm down by the way
Down by the way

[Verse 1]
I'm from down by the way
Where the too much sun is great
I'm from, down by the river
That's Jefferson, free my niggas
I'm from Mack Avenue
From the concrete, who knew that I would grew
Bro, what you gross?
You still doin' the same shit or gettin' dough?
Whoa, I can't help myself
I always wanted better for myself
And I never wanted niggas in my business
Cause niggas pussy and they gossip like women
I ain't got  time, for pictures
I hate interviews they ask the same questions
Sometimes I close my eyes, and just be thinkin'
Dej you good, you ain't got no competition
You in your own lane you got everything they missing
That's why they bitter, don't even trip, them niggas tripping
They tryin' to throw you off your square so pay attention
This game shady you done did a song with Em, shit
I never started anything I can't finish
And people ain't who i thought they was
For free or a small, small ticket
No juice I'll get the drop from cuz
What they want from us?
I been waitin' for my spark back
Just last year I was workin' in a hardhat
I know I got a hard head, I know I got a soft ass
I'm tougher than these pussy niggas, gone with your soft ass
They sayin' I ain't got bars, how? I drink Hen, I go hard
I be hopping bar to bar, switching whips car to car
Iv'e been breakin' niggas heart, I ain't tryin' to brag about it
You a dog, ok cool just don't be mad about it
I just had a heart to heart, with my heart I'm hurt about it
Streets is watching, and they talking, and I know you heard about it
Sell what? I can make, I can make a bargain offer
He a target, we'll catch the pussy while he target shopping
I smile, I laugh, I cry, I'm human
Bein' broke wasn't funny I ain't never find humor in it
Fuck love, I'm just trying to dodge that cupid nigga
I ain't tryin' hard, I can't help I look cute to niggas
I'm the truth to niggas, I don't force it, I embrace it, I enforce it
Don't fold, crispy always kept my forces
When you a boss you have choices, fuck voices
And opinions, get loaded, nigga keep winning
I ain't grinning, I ain't smirking, do it if it's worth it
All these Brenda's having babies Pac, they ain't listen
Yeah, it's the same difference, I ain't to proud of it
So, I beg to differ
Keep a bucket on my head like I'm going fishing
I'm going up, this shit crazy I'm on a tour with Nicki
To win in this shit you gotta be consistent
You can't let 'em [?] dog, you doberman pinscher
Let's be real, listen
You don't love me so don't say it, might get real offended
Fuck the law, fuck the legislation
I've been havin' dreams lately got me feelin' like I'm in a maze
Man this shit's amazing, you different relocated
I just don't give a fuck taking things into consideration
No intermissions for you misery, you bitches crazy
Man, I swear you bitches crazy
Counting bagels at my kitchen table
I need some horses out back now that I'm stable
Whoa, I'm so awake, I'm so awake
Too far ahead should've been born in the eighties
