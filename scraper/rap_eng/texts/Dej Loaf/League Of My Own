[Bridge: Samantha J]
I'm in league of my own
League of my own
So give me back what you borrowed
That style there is not yours
I'm in a league of my own
League of my own
So please do not follow
Keep all that under control

[Chorus: Samantha J]
Mi make dem say ohhh whoa
Mi make dem say ohhh whoa
Mi make dem say
I got my own league if you do too sing with me
Mi make dem say ohhh whoa
Mi make dem say ohhh whoa
I make dem say, "she out my league"
So all they could do is just watch me

[Verse 1: Samantha J]
I'm out with my gals, you already know how we role
All we do is have fun everywhere that we go
One minute they love you, they love you, then they wanna get rid of you
Tryin' be on your team, tell 'em that they
Can't sit with you
Cuz I can see right through that ohhhhh
Uh ohhhh

I drive the boys wild
I bring all the fly girls out
It's my party, I know all about
Being the only one that stick out
Cho!
You aguh hear it here from my mouth
Because you can't figure me out

[Bridge: Samantha J]
I'm in league of my own
League of my own
So give me back what you borrowed
That style there is not yours
I'm in a league of my own
League of my own
So please do not follow
Keep all that under control

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
In a league of my own
You probably think it's easy, but it's hard to get on
Pull up with the top down like, damn (like damn!)
Why you trippin' girl? I don't want your man
Lipstick and liner
Loafers reclinin'
Why they be hatin'? They faces be sour
First base like it's baseball, baby
Couple 8 bars in my 8 ball jacket
Who gone stop me? Ain't nobody gonna stop me
Trend setter, man I know that they gonn' jock me
But that's okay, I got a style for every stylist
You probably salty cuz you know that you can't have me!

[Verse 3: Samantha J]
I take the party everywhere I go
Never too far from the dance floor
They go crazy when I walk through the door
All eyes are on me

I don't go nowhere alone
Always bringing my friends along
You can tell by the way I act
I'm in a league of my own

[Bridge: Samantha J]
I'm in league of my own
League of my own
So give me back what you borrowed
That style there is not yours
I'm in a league of my own
League of my own
So please do not follow
Keep all that under control

[Chorus: Samantha J]
Mi make dem say ohhh whoa
Mi make dem say ohhh whoa
Mi make dem say
I got my own league if you do too sing with me
Mi make dem say ohhh whoa
Mi make dem say ohhh whoa
I make dem say, "she out my league"
So all they could do is just watch me
