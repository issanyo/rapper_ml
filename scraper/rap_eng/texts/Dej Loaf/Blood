[Intro: Birdman]
Yep, top floor what I'm sayin' (guns up)
Blood line run deep, boy, what's up Dej? Stunna Man
Brackin' in the bity, boolin' with some bitches
Straight bleedin', gettin' our ones up
Straight 'bout this B game, big money poppin' over here
G5 - BRRRAT! BRRRAT! BRRRAT! Rich Gang!

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
It ain't no ho in my blood, born and raised in them slums
Took my daddy away when I was 4
Why would I give a fuck about y'all?
Ain't no ho in my blood, been thorough since day 1
Lost a couple people, ever since then I've been numb
Ain't no ho in my blood, Sell Sole gon' flood
If I don't make it off of this again fuck this shit, I'm done
Cause ain't no ho in my blood, no hoes in my circle
Loyalty over love, I'll kill a bitch on purpose
Cause ain't no ho in my blood, everybody 100
All I know is flip it back, we don't do no frontin'
We don't do no runnin', it ain't in my DNA
Blood thicker than water, but my money thicker than that

[Bridge: Dej Loaf]
They are some hoes, hoes, let's talk about these hoes
Sellin' all that pussy yet you ain't go no prose
Bitch you slow, slow, slow
Bitch you slow, slow, slow
And you's a ho, ho, let's talk about these hoes
Moochin' off your niggas, you can't stand up on your own
Boy you's a ho, ho, ho
Boy you's a ho, ho, ho

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
No ho in my blood, always been a boss
Always had style, no matter what it cost
Other bitches, they was fuckin', I was all about the money
I was in the 7th grade, shootin' dice for the money
Tryna hit this other 9-5, writin' rhymes by the nightlight
Tryna get us up out the hood
So I could have all my people lookin' and livin' good

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir

[Interlude: Young Thug]
I mean, it's not 1%, nigga
Not even half of 1%, bitch

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Hey Loaf, I'm just boolin' nigga on block
No police, if I like that shit I cop
No Rollie but you can watch
Me, put this feature back in the pot
Grindin' like a skater, nigga
I get fresh and go straight to the mall and bait a nigga
You want beef? I can cater nigga
I'm not a ho or pussy, so she ride that dick like a Speed Racer, nigga
Started from the bottom, came straight to the top
No dad but if he play, he get popped
You ain't real, squad, so you can't come to the block
I wanna see blood but I ain't come with a mop
I'ma pop his top, proceed to the top
Let these bullets work on a nigga's body like a doctor

[Bridge: Young Thug]
It ain't no ho in my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood
I swear ain't no ho inside my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir

[Outro: Birdman & Young Thug]
Real recognize real
Money, power and action over here, boy
King Slime - BRRRAT! Big money poppin'
I'm far from a ho nigga, as a matter of fact
I'm one of the biggest Bloods in fuckin' America, you know, flippin'!
Any nigga, any mothafucka wanna get in the way of this shit
Nigga, try to stop this shit from goin' to the top and we flip 'em
We gon' show 'em we not hoes, Dej Loaf what up?
