[Chorus: Dej Loaf x2]
Let a nigga try me, try me
Imma get his whole mawfuckin family
And I ain't playin' wit nobody
Fuck around and Imma catch a body

[Verse 1: Lor Chris]
I got the juice now
I feel like Bishop
Same cruddy lor nigga from Stricker
A lot of niggas do but I never switch up
Blowin' dutchy after dutchy till I get stiff bruh
Sendin' threats at me but somehow I never get touched
Don't think you superman my nigga you can get bust
Like my ciroc on ice noo I don't do cups
Still drinkin' out the bottle like a nigga 6 months
40 on deck if a nigga try Chris
Play wit my dough or cheese Imma catch a body
Ready for whatever boy I dare you try me
Real bad boy Diddy need to sign me
Don't listen to these rappers they just talkin non-sense
Rappin about shit they never accomplished
Lor Chris undarated, I'm just bein' honest
She know the campaign, swear your bitch on it
These niggas swear they hot, swear I didn't know this
Run up in his crib leave 'em on the sofa
My niggas got coke, I ain't talkin' soda
And we got dem babies I ain't talkin' strollas
I keep my friends close, enemies closer
Everybody cruddy so I keep the toaster
Out of all of dese niggas she say I'm the dopest
Knock it out the park like Sammy Sosa

[Hook: Lor Chris]
Let a nigga try me, try me
Headshot, I don't see his body
I want a nigga try me, try me
Fuck around have 'em at Wylie's

[Chorus: Dej Loaf x2]
Let a nigga try me, try me
Imma get his whole mawfuckin family
And I ain't playin' wit nobody
Fuck around and Imma catch a body
