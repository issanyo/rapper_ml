Chillin' on the beach in MIA, drinkin' Henessy
You don't drink Hennessy, I know that you feelin' me

My Miami love, I'm packin' up
Headed to you baby, come and show me love
Show, don't tell, don't tell nobody
I got a show tonight, then want to feel your body
Show, don't tell, don't tell nobody
I got a show tonight, then want to feel your body
Body to body, cheek to cheek
Somethin' 'bout you baby got me feelin' weak
How I don't want to lose you when I don't even have you yet
Early morning flight, I'm so uh where my panties, yup

I like the simple things, but I don't like that average shit, naw
