[Intro]
I just wanna know if it's real
If it's real

[Hook: Nef The Pharoah]
I'm always telling her lies
And steady making her cry
She say 'I just wanna know if what we have is real'
It's real, it's real, it's real
She always is on my case
She hanging up in my face
She say 'I just wanna know if what we have is real'
It's real, it's real, it's real

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
I know I cheated, I'm a dog, babe
I know I make your life hard, baby
But you my nigga and I love you baby
My down ass nigga and I love you baby
Yes, I fight if you fighting, I hold you at night
Steady do me dirty but it was not right
My nigga and I love you babe
My down ass nigga and I love you baby
And you be out with other niggas
But I treat 'em like they bitches
Trust me, they are not important, you the only one
But you my nigga and I love you baby
My down ass nigga and I love you baby

[Hook: Nef The Pharoah]
I'm always telling her lies
And steady making her cry
She say 'I just wanna know if what we have is real'
It's real, it's real, it's real
She always is on my case
She hanging up in my face
She say 'I just wanna know if what we have is real'
It's real, it's real, it's real

[Verse 2: Nef The Pharoah]
I know we fight and have our arguments
Girl, you are irreplaceable just know that shit
But you my nigga and I love you baby (love you too)
My down ass nigga and I love you baby
Never hurts sometimes to realise that you were all the good in life
But you my nigga and I love you baby
My down ass nigga and I love you baby
And I be out with other women but I treat 'em like they bitches
Trust me, they are not important, you the only one I need
But you my nigga and I love you baby
My down ass nigga and I love you baby

[Hook: Nef The Pharoah]
I'm always telling her lies
And steady making her cry
She say 'I just wanna know if what we have is real'
It's real, it's real, it's real
She always is on my case
She hanging up in my face
She say 'I just wanna know if what we have is real'
It's real, it's real, it's real

[Bridge]
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know

[Hook: Nef The Pharoah]
I'm always telling her lies
And steady making her cry
She say 'I just wanna know if what we have is real'
It's real, it's real, it's real
She always is on my case
She hanging up in my face
She say 'I just wanna know if what we have is real'
It's real, it's real, it's real
