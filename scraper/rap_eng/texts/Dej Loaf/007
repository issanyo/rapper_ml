[Intro: Jacquees]
Lost at sea nigga
Can’t see nothing but the water

[Hook: Jacquees]
Ay we ain’t playin’ ‘bout this side
You owe me money, better hide
Too many niggas, they done tried
Too many niggas, they done died
I took the pistol and I ride
Got pretty bitches getting high
007, I’m golden
And I brought my set to the Nolia

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Nigga know what I’m doing
Bad hoes I’m pursuing
Bitch I might sit like a Bruin
Bitch we icy, fuck a Bruin
Hit that pussy from the back
I’m Chipper Jones with a bat
Ran off on the plug
And we ain’t ever coming back
See me and Tunechi got a stack
See me and Stunner got a stack
See being broke is like an ex
And I ain’t never going back
My jewelry shine like a plaque
You tuck your chain, you a bitch
Load the chopper, yelling free the ‘Woper
Know we Gucci ‘cause I’m from the six

[Bridge: Jacquees]
Notice how I hustle the whole play
They been tryna block us all day
We ain’t finna let ‘em stop us
So I’m still on the block with my cousins

[Hook: Jacquees]
Ay we ain’t playin’ ‘bout this side
You owe me money, better hide
Too many niggas, they done tried
Too many niggas, they done died
I took the pistol and I ride
Got pretty bitches getting high
007, I’m golden
And I brought my set to the Nolia

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
I said woah woah, yeah yeah
Chopper gon’ hit you from both sides
Niggas be thinking shit sweet ‘til we pop up
Kids close your eyes
Make sure before you come for me
Bitch close your thighs
Hoes can’t control theyselves
It’s a must they die
You don’t even want to know what’s in the trunk
That ain’t the trunk, bitch that’s the trunk
I been the shit since I was on sippy cups
You ain’t got balls, pull your zipper up
That’s a hundred right there, cool fifty tucked
Try to touch anything, we go cocoa puffs
Yeah, crack your coconut
Pussy

[Bridge: Jacquees and Dej Loaf]
Notice how I hustle the whole play
They been tryna block us all day
We ain’t finna let ‘em stop us
So I’m still on the block with my cousins

[Hook: Jacquees]
Ay we ain’t playin’ ‘bout this side
You owe me money, better hide
Too many niggas, they done tried
Too many niggas, they done died
I took the pistol and I ride
Got pretty bitches getting high
007, I’m golden
And I brought my set to the Nolia
