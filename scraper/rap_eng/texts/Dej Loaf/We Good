[Verse 1]
They say, "Dej why you ain't drop yet?
Where your new shit? Who you down with?
What's Sell Sole mean?", It mean I'm out here
Pay me a check or I can't show up to your soundcheck
All these goofy ass rappers on that clown shit
On your fifth mixtape and ain't nobody heard shit
Maybe you boys should slow it down
I think smart, my shit comin', it's goin' down
Can't beat us, you niggas better join us now
Best believe I got these rappers disappointed now
All these bitches turnt up, I'm finna turn 'em down
Tell 'em that I'm back and I still got my fuckin' crown
We don't rap beef, we really clap heat
Put the tip to your lips, that's a black and mild
Fuck these hipsters and their fuckin' style
I'd rather wear my own shit, fuck a hand-me-down
And fuck all of these fake lean sippers
Above dreams, these niggas ain't seen different
They played the wrong roles, now my scene different
I'm a dog with this shit and these fleas itchin'
Used to do shit for free, now the fee is different
Cause I done came up, now I need interest
I said fuck tryna please, nigga
I'm like please, nigga, shout out to my team, nigga

[Hook]
I said we good over here
I said we good over here, I swear, I swear, I swear
I said we good over here
I said we good over here, I swear, I swear, I swear

[Verse 2]
I'm just tryna stack these ten bars
Where the fuck these labels at? They shoulda been called
I be goin' off the handle
Nigga think he hard, I'ma tell him pull his pants down
I'm on hold with Interscope
Let me click over for Def Jam
If they ain't talkin' a couple mil'
Then they can just forget it, fam
Cause I be spittin' crack, make a rap bitch snort a line
In the studio, you ain't got a hit, you wastin' time
Most of these rappers fake, they was lame before they made a song
I've been the shit, and that's word to my fuckin' mom
New scarf on my head, niggas thinkin' I'm a Crip
And my Blood got on blood, we on some gangsta shit
Born to get money and I'm too legit to quit
No handouts, nigga, I'ma get it how I live

[Hook]
