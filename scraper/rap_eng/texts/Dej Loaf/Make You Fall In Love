[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
I can make you fall in love with this ooh, ooh
You wouldn't know what to do
You licking me like la la la la la la la la
You tie me up with a blindfold
Hittin' me in my blind spot
Like skrrrt (whoa!), skrrrt (whoa!), skrrrt (whoa, whoa, whoa!)
I just feel like my pussy better
Than all them bitches you been with
Take his ass on a field trip
You know me I like to build with it
He gon' feel the difference
I'ma take the pain, I'ma bust down, no prescription
You and me could be you and me
But together shit that's your decision

[Pre-Hook: Dej Loaf]
Cool where I'm at (I'm chilling)
Why you teasing me, why you doing all that

Baby, you got me drunk as hell (whoa)

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
I hope you're ready for what I'm about to do
Let me slide inside you
Put your legs right beside your head
I wanna hit it in your favorite position
You moan while I'm licking
Your pussy girl you're soaking wet (so wet)
I just think you're better than
All them bitches that's battling
We fuck for us, no settling
Take a break, then I'm back again
I wanna take my time
Cause your body is the mission
You and me could be you and me
But together shit that's your decision

Girl, I tat your name on my hand
