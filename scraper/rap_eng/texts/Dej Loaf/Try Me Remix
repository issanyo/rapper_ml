[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me, I'mma get his whole mothafucking family
And I ain't playing with nobody
Fuck around and I'mma catch a body
(x2)

[Verse 1: Miles]
Ay, let a bitch try me, try me, I'mma kill his whole mothafucking family
Dealt with snakes like Medusa, my face is concrete
Pull away them Porsche rims, yeah they super shiny
Growing up with troubled worries but cute and tiny
Dad had thoughts of suicide said "god crucify me"
Then I look up and ask mommy, where will I be
She said "Miles you'll be fine you'll be right beside me"
Your bitch came to my crib to ask bitch will you wife me
Started talkin and she stop me said get inside me
Fuck her like Satan when she ride me, make her eyes bleed
Fuck on the yacht, I'm the captain Sidney Crosby
I got panorama vision like a wide screen
My future bright got more light than a high beam
I always got more green than a lemon icy
Cops could catch with a pound wouldn't penalize me
Smell the henny when I speak wouldn't breathalyze me
They say look into his eyes, it's the devil I see
I'm gonna hide you haters seek try to come and find me
It's the whole entire world and their facin my team
We gon merk who try to hurt us make a fuckin crime scene
We gon blow you like a hurricane, Irene
We put the dye up in the sky and we make it lime green
Got your bitch with 3 years on me yeah she nine-teen
She such like a straw for high c she a dime piece
The shit I'm sellin got good hygiene bud that I breathe
Addicts text me quick and timely saying "I need"
I'm always riding in the Hood and they call me Rodney

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me, I'mma get his whole mothafucking family
And I ain't playing with nobody
Fuck around and I'mma catch a body

[Verse 2 Miles]
Walking strapped my 40 itch more than poison ivy
Man I could go on for 9 weeks with this rhyme scheme
I'm court side draped in orange Nike call me Spike Lee
Commentate the Knicks nightly just like Mike Breen
My flow is cold as Alaska could freeze the white sheep
I might seem like I'm a rap god, and I might be
Got my flow up in the stu and we getting fiesty
My mixtape is on the way this is just a light breeze

(Hook)
Let a nigga try me, try me, I'mma get his whole mothafucking family
And I ain't playing with nobody
Fuck around and I'mma catch a body
(x2)

[Verse 3]
Bitch I step up to the plate and do great when the bases loaded
Find my way out when it counts you complain that the maze is broken
Try to fly unrecognized it's a shame only fame is chosen
When it comes to writing lyrics bitch I'm the world's greatest poet
Now I'm on my shit did all my research while the game was loading
I got bitches in my crib and they showing me naked posing
Ate the pussy shit was bomb when I finished my face exploded
This the best try remix in the world that phrase is quoted
SQUADDD
