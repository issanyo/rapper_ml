[Intro]
Mommy I'm A, I said Mommy I'm a princess
Mommy I'm A, I said Mommy I'm a princess

[Verse]
Mommy I'm A Princess, and I want that new swing set
I want some things I ain't seen yet
Can you get it? Mama Please Mama please, yes
You the best
Daddy ain't around but you still keep me fresh
Thanks to you ma, I'mma kill em all free dress
Kill em with silence, cause I'm so
Mommy I'm A Princess
I want a pool in my backyard
But when you're living in the projects its too hard
I got you mom, I don't mind doing chores
And when I'm done can you please paint my nails the same color as yours
Mommy I'm A Princess
Which means your the Queen, you my two borthers are all that I need
Yo, can I get a horse for my sweet-sixteen
If I don't get this Porsche, boy sports, I'mma scream
Mommy can you bring us some, Mickey Ds
I'll taken a number ten, no onions, no cheese (no pickles)
You know what I mean
Yeah I'm older now and I'm living my dream
Mommy I'm A Princess
Yeah you used to change my pamper, right?
Well tell me how it feels to live the pampered life
Yeah, you deserve the best
I did it all right so you can get whats left
You can get what ever, you dont have to shop for less
I'm talking no more drama and no more stress
Listen up Ma
I want to thank you for all that you did
Put em up high for my mommy raising three kids
Waking up on saturday going to get them jordans
Just to make me happy when you really couldn't afford em
It makes sense now cause im your only daughter
Feels so good to replace all those hundreds for them qaurters
That you gave me

[Outro]
Mommy I'm A, I said Mommy I'm a princess
Mommy I'm A, I said Mommy I'm a princess
Mommy Im A princess
A Princess, A Princess
A Princess, A Princess
Mommy I'm A Princess
A Princess, A Princess
A Princess, A Princess
