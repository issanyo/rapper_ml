[Hook: Ca$h]
Every little thing that you do
I fantasize about you
The freaky things that you do
You got a lot of freak in you baby
Every little thing that we do
Should be between me in you
I bet your man never knew
You got a lot of freak in you yeah-yeah

[Verse 1: Ca$h]
What your man never knew you had that freak in you
And when I take you home you got that freak in you
And when I take you home I bring that freak out of you
And when I lay you down you don't wanna move
And when I come around you don't think about dudes
What your man don't know won't hurt him
I'ma call your phone at 7:30
I'ma pick you up in a hurry
Pull up skrt-skrt-skrt

[Pre-Hook: Ca$h]
Every little thing that we do
Nobody even got a clue
The way I'm freaking all on you
I bring that freak out of you, yeah-yeah

[Hook: Ca$h]
Every little thing that you do
I fantasize about you
The freaky things that you do
You got a lot of freak in you baby
Every little thing that we do
Should be between me in you
I bet your man never knew
You got a lot of freak in you yeah-yeah

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels
I tell them freaks
Like a thief in the night make 'em scream
He know I'm cold (?)
Put your hands up and I peep your prick through your sweats
I can't stop looking at it baby
Take this mask off and I'm climbing up in your bed
Fuck 'em so good his whole body is turning red
It's only one person he wanna go again
He whisper to me "give it to me, give it to me"
It's so big but every little thing that you do

[Hook: Ca$h]
Every little thing that you do
I fantasize about you
The freaky things that you do
You got a lot of freak in you baby
Every little thing that we do
Should be between me in you
I bet your man never knew
You got a lot of freak in you yeah-yeah

[Bridge: Ca$h]
I bet your man never knew that you had that freaky side
You had that freaky side
I bet your man never knew I'm going deep inside you
I'm going deep inside you
I bet your man never knew that you riding in that passenger seat
And how I fuck you good in the back seat
You try your best just to keep it lowkey
I bet your man never knew that you had that freaky side
You had that freaky side
I bet your man never knew I'm going deep inside you
And that's why

[Hook: Ca$h]
Every little thing that you do
I fantasize about you
The freaky things that you do
You got a lot of freak in you baby
Every little thing that we do
Should be between me in you
I bet your man never knew
You got a lot of freak in you yeah-yeah

[Outro: Dej Loaf]
You got a lot of freak in you
You got a lot of freak in you
You got a lot of freak in you
