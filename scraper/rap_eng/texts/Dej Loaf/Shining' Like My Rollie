[Hook: Tracy T]
Girl, you're shining like my Rollie
Better act like you know me
I can take you round the gloab
Places you ain't been before
You just be ready when I go
I might come get you in a Roles
Just to get you out them clothes
And you ain't worryed bout them hoes

[Verse 1: Tracy T]
I just might pull up in a Bens
Just to switch and hit her friend
I sware this shit will never end
I'm just tryna get it in
Ain't no brown in them jeans
I got the chopper on the scene
I pull a Keesha on a fiend
I don't play, I play for keeps
I like them ? and them ? baby
I got them Cubans and them ? baby
I through  them diamonds on that ? baby
Cause I got money like a bank, baby
We on tracks just like a train, baby
Can't put the picture in the frame, baby
You just be ready when I go
And this a yacht, this ain't a boat

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
He hold the 30, you know I just might be Keesha
I ash on a bitch, but I ain't smokin no Riefer
I got my own bag, I just fuck, I don't need him
He had a long day, I fuck him and please him
Take me on trips, I'm used to that shit
Your girl, where she at, I ain't with that groupie shit
I be in my plain, how much money I done spent
Money cake cake ?
My boys will snatch your chain, just to come up on a lick
But Imma let you slide, cause I ain't no set up bitch
Open shots, let's set up this
Blatter closesd, chest and shit
Through the phone, let me check my messages
We be coolin in Miami
How you get me out my panties
I be goin off the Henni
He beat it up just like the ?
