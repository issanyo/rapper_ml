[Chorus]

Ask about me, they gon' say I keep it solid
Ain’t cross nobody (Yeah) for no paper
I went around it

[Verse 1]
Who fuckin’ with me (Yeah)
I don’t really see nobody (Nobody)
I told ’em try me
Have them bitches nervous 'bout me
And your big homie know that I’m the problem
I try to get rid of niggas so that I can blossom
‘Cause it’s gon take more than a dozen roses (Mmhmm)
If your business gets slow
And your friends turn foe
Loyalty is everything, I only love my bros
And I never beg for features from these rap niggas (Nah, nah)
I’m proud to say I ain’t fucked a rap nigga (Wow)
Yeah, they all cap with it
Me, I been sittin' back chillin' (Chillin')
Soaking up the game, inhaling
27, I want children, Dej, don’t let this rap shit kill you

[Chorus]
Who gon’ stop us? (Yeah)
We be mobbin’
With my dawgs (Yeah)
Them niggas don’t play about me ('Bout me)
Ask about me, they gon' say i keep it solid
Ain’t cross nobody (Yeah) for no paper
I went around it
Who gon’ stop us? (Ayy)
We be mobbin’
With my dawgs (Dawgs)
Them niggas don’t play about me ('Bout me)
Ask about me, they gon' say i keep it solid
Ain’t cross nobody (Yeah) for no paper
I went around it

[Verse 2]
Started texting, now she send me nudes for breakfast
Like how I spit it, I’ll invite you to my session
Location, these bitches ain’t got address (No way)
So some shit, i’m just not addressing
And all my niggas ain’t rich yet but they progressing
I was down to my last, now I’m all invested
Thankful for the L's (L's)
Thankful for the lessons
Had to turn them into wins, now I want revenge (Now I want revenge)
It ain’t a weapon that can make me feel protected
But we keep heaters for all aggression (All aggression)

[Chorus]
Who gon’ stop us? (Yeah)
We be mobbin’ (Mobbin')
With my dawgs (Yeah)
Them niggas don’t play about me ('Bout me)
Ask about me, they gon' say I keep it solid
Ain’t cross nobody (Yeah) for no paper
I went around it (Ooh yeah)
Who gon’ stop us? (Ayy)
We be mobbin’
With my dawgs (Dawgs)
Them niggas don’t play about me ('Bout me)
Ask about me, they gon' say I keep it solid
I didn't cross nobody (Yeah) for no paper
I went around it
Who gon’ stop us?

With my dawgs
Them niggas don’t play about me
Ask about me, they gon' say I keep it solid
Ain’t cross nobody for no paper
I went around it (Ooh yeah)
