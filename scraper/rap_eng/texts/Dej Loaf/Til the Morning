[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It's a party on the weekend, know you been working hard all day
Now it's time to turn up, yeah I know you feel the same
Baby you just wanna go out, just to do little dancing
It's a shame you brought yo man with you, know you feeling kinda antsy

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown]
Let me show I got everything paid for
If he got a problem I got way more
She fucking with a boss, I make a name for
And I'mma give her everything she came for

[Hook: Chris Brown]
'Til the morning
I'mma do my thing, girl I ain't lying we gon' do this

'Til the morning
Gon' and tell your friends that I don't get tired

Oh yeah babe, oh yeah babe, we gon' do it 'til the morning

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
Party, party, party
Pass me a cup, I'll take a shot to the air like yaddy yaddy yeah yeah yeah
He wanna take me home, put me in the bed and feel my body, body, body
But you gotta come better cause I got my own bread
I got thousands, thousands, thousands piling (yeah, yeah)
Why you asking all these questions? Niggas gotta be the feds
Said I'm single but I ain't lonely
Want you, then I have you nigga slowly but surely
It's midnight, got a flight in the morning
Dance floor, baby I like how you performing
And I want you, one night only this is torture
Seen it through the jeans yeah dick so enormous
Yo, and I just want a portion
Of it, let me have it baby, go ahead and show me

[Hook: Chris Brown]

Oh yeah babe, oh yeah babe, we gon' do it 'til the morning

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Party, party and put your glass in the air
If you in love make a toast, take your clothes off, put yo ass in the air
This is the party, party and I know you don't really do this all the time
Got your body on mine and your man over there looking mad as hell

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown]
Everything paid for
