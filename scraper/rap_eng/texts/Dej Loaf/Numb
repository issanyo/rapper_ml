[Intro]
I just wanna be numb to you
Look what you've done to me, look what I've done to you
I, I don't wanna feel no more
I don't wanna feel no more

[Hook]
I don't wanna feel no more
Gotta let me heart heal some more
I don't wanna be frill no more
I just wanna be numb to you
Look what you've done to me, look what I've done to you
Look what I've done to you
Look what you've done to me, look what I've done to you
I just wanna be numb to you

[Verse 1]
Causin' all this commotion
When we both know we're not supposed to be together
Started off with good conversation
How we end up sleepin' together?
I can't change what we did
I can't change the first time that we kissed
And then we kissed again, then we kissed again
Then it turned into relationship, damn
How did this happen?
Whole two years, I done dodged hella traffic
I was in too deep, I was losin' hella focus
I was broke down bad, I ain't really have nothin'
You was right there with me, found another side of me
Any time I need a lift, you would rise to me
Funny how things change
You ain't even have the guts to say bye to me
I don't wanna feel you no more
I'm so numb, I'm so numb, numb, numb
Shit, I'm done tryna figure you out
Remember, we used to freak on the couch when all our friends left the house
I don't trust nobody
Probably went over your head
I've been holdin' it in, I've been wantin' to say it
Let me say it again, I don't trust nobody
Nobody

[Verse 2]
Look at me now, I done moved up, and you gone
We was holdin' on to somethin' that was never gon' happen
I was holdin' on to you cause I was scared of what happened
We was fuckin' and laughin', you was hittin' it backwards
We would fuck with that passion, I couldn't even imagine
Us not together
But I guess shit happens

[Interlude]
Can't change how I feel
Can't change how I feel
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened

[Verse 3]
You had bitches callin' and textin'
Givin' me the runaround like it's fuckin' gymnastics
One time for all them bitches you messed with
Hope the best cause I'm happy you flexed 'em
Changed my dreams, God steady sendin' me blessings
Fuck relationships, I got my mind on my cheddar
Out of sight, out of mind, got a flight at 11
I'ma do a show in Houston and go back to New Orleans
I said, "How are you doin'?"
Might have called once or twice, askin', "Who are you screwin'?"
That was just me, in my feelings
Just thinkin' 'bout the times you held my face in the pillow
Full of tears, full of tears to that thing in the middle
Now that we're done, I'm just seein' you different
Now when I see you, I'm just greetin' you different
Two years, I can't believe we're finished
I can't believe it
I'm long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
Look at me now

[Hook]
I don't wanna feel no more
Gotta let me heart heal some more
I don't wanna be frill no more
I just wanna be numb to you
Look what you've done to me, look what I've done to you
Look what I've done to you
Look what you've done to me, look what I've done to you
I don't wanna feel no more
Gotta let me heart heal some more
I don't wanna be frill no more
I just wanna be numb to you
Look what you've done to me, look what I've done to you
Look what I've done to you
