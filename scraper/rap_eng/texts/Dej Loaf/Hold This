[Hook: Jacquees & (Dej Loaf)]
(He hand it to me like hold this)
I put it in motion
Just pull ya panties to the side
You being bad girl turn around

[Refrain: Jacquees & (Dej Loaf)]
I just need somebody on the side of me
I feel like that you just got some shit you tryna hide from me
Them other niggas telling lies but girl they not Jacquees
I got a million different ways
To make you say my name
Tell me if you feel the same
(Yeah I feel the same)

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
It hurts so good but I'm focused
I got him wondering, I got him open
Three cups I got him swimming, got him stroking
And can't another bitch compete
Cuz I got you weak in the knees
Look, I ain't tryna hear none of them lies you're telling me
How to be a player niggas think they Bill Bellamy
Tell me what's your fantasy and we can do that
They gon' be looking at us crazy
Like where the fuck they do that
Cuz I knew what you wanted from the start
This shit ain't easy yeah I might just steal your heart

[Hook: Jacquees & (Dej Loaf)]
(He hand it to me like hold this)
I put it in motion
Just pull ya panties to the side
You being bad girl turn around

[Refrain: Jacquees]
I just need somebody on the side of me
I feel like that you just got some shit you tryna hide from me
Them other niggas telling lies but girl they not Jacquees
I got a million different ways
To make you say my name
Tell me if you feel the same
