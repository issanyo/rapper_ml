[Verse 1]
Look who's got talent, played the violin
Good with his hands, he wanna get hired in
Mini-men, mini-men
Listening to 50 Cent, Get Rich or Die Tryin’
My niggas told me I was legend, I'm a pioneer
I was goin' through some shit, I had to disappear
I can make a gangsta cry real tears
Yeah, that’s real shit
Separate my 20s and my tens
I'ma give the ones and fives to the kids
Mmm, mister ice cream man
I feel like mister ice cream man
I got the world in my hands, bitch
It's Yellow World 'til the end
He ran off with some bands
I bet that boy won't do that shit again

[Chorus]
Ain't no hate in my blood, ain't no ho in my chest
All my niggas was good last time that I checked
Ain't no hate in my blood, ain’t no ho in my chest
All my niggas was good last time that I checked
Ain’t no hate in my blood, ain't no ho in my chest
All my niggas was good last time that I checked
Ain’t no hate in my blood, ain't no ho in my chest
All my niggas was good last time that I checked

[Verse 2]
Played my cards right, came out better deals
These bitches thought I left, but I came back to kill
I was listening to B.I.G., Ready to Die, for real
Yeah, Ready to Die, for real
Rhyme sicker than your average (Average)
These bitches know, nigga ask your favorite rapper (Ask that bitch)
They want heat, this a classic
All your shit waste management
I'm sorry I don't got no big butt to pose (Oh, no)
But I know some places that your man will go (Yes, he will)
Nah, he ain’t gon' tell me, "No" (Nope)
Always keep it real, shit, that's my approach
Yeah, betted on my self, put on my own Loaf
Shit different now, we gamblin' on marble floors
Young leprechauns, we ain't gon' stop, we want the pot of gold
Hard work pays off, I got a lot to show

[Chorus]
Ain't no hate in my blood, ain't no ho in my chest
All my niggas was good last time that I checked
Ain't no hate in my blood, ain't no ho in my chest
All my niggas was good last time that I checked
Ain't no hate in my blood, ain't no ho in my chest
All my niggas was good last time that I checked
Ain't no hate in my blood, ain't no ho in my chest
All my niggas was good last time that I checked

[Outro]
Rhyme sicker than your average
Rhyme sicker than your average
