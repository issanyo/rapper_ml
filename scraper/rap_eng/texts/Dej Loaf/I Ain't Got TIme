[Hook: Dej Loaf] x4
I ain't got time cause I run these streets
My money too long, why you hatin' on me?
I be on my grind and I run these streets
So it's about time that I flood these streets

[Verse 1: Young Klep]
Spent about a band on my Louis evidence
Cause it's evident a nigga gettin' hella rich
All that Instagram shit'll get your melon split
Slide through, drop a hundred, let the candy drip
I'm on some Kevin Gates shit, I don't get tipsy
On the floor late night tryna get mine
Stay down and come up, ain't got no new friends
Now I'm racked up, Forgiatos on a new Benz
Weed loud, I can show you what the pack do
If you a nerd, I can show you what the MAC do
I bring it back like I'm Mannie Fresh and Lil Wayne
Copped the old school with this candy on some gold thangs

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Young Klep]
Broke niggas talkin', I call it EBT
Government funded niggas that can't fuck with me
I'm in that 600, on some Forgiato
Strap tucked, sippin' syrup out a baby bottle
You call yourself a boss but I don't understand
Your circle lookin' bummy, why you ain't front your men?
You niggas dead wrong, my whole team on
Back and forth, catchin' plays like it's ping pong
I let my nuts hang cause I done took some losses
Game strong cause I done hung around too many bosses
I ain't forgot my nigga [?], he put me on
Now it's thousand dollar plays, juugin' on the iPhone

[Hook] x2
