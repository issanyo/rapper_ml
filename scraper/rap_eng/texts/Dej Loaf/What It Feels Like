[Chorus: Tish Hyman]
100 thousand cash, I can show you what it feels like
Birkin bag, I can show you what it feels like
200 on the dash, I can show you what it feels like
That's a real ass 'cause I know what it feels like
Weeks in Dubai, I can show you what it feels like
Thousand dollar meals, I can show you what it feels like
Trapping on the grind, I can show you what it feels like
Tell you that I'm on and that's what it feels like

[Verse 1: Tish Hyman]
I'm from New York City so you know you better come, right
Tourin' overseas, no sleep 'til sunrise
If that was your girl, then she wasn't last night
Don't be mad at me, nigga, that's your life
Said she love my jewels, wanna know what it feel like
You got too many rules and she lookin' for the free life
Drop top Rolls, she tryna catch a breeze like
She know I got the gold, she tryna catch a breeze like

[Chorus: Tish Hyman]
100 thousand cash, I can show you what it feels like
Birkin bag, I can show you what it feels like
200 on the dash, I can show you what it feels like
That's a real ass 'cause I know what it feels like
Weeks in Dubai, I can show you what it feels like
Thousand dollar meals, I can show you what it feels like
Trapping on the grind, I can show you what it feels like
Tell you that I'm on and that's what it feels like

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
She know what it feels like
She know Dolla lay the pipe (aw yeah)
Baby got a past (so what?)
She got miles on that ass
Shawty been in mansions
Shawty been in foreigns
I just follow shawty
She told me you're borin'
Hotel, hotel suite (hotel, hotel, hotel)
I'ma do the Louis supreme
Shoppin' 'til we fall out (fall out)
We just fuck after we fall out, ooh yeah

[Chorus: Tish Hyman]
100 thousand cash, I can show you what it feels like
Birkin bag, I can show you what it feels like
200 on the dash, I can show you what it feels like
That's a real ass 'cause I know what it feels like
Weeks in Dubai, I can show you what it feels like
Thousand dollar meals, I can show you what it feels like
Trapping on the grind, I can show you what it feels like
Tell you that I'm on and that's what it feels like

[Verse 3: DeJ Loaf]
Chanel bags, Givenchy
The back of the woods, watch you lean on me
Your nigga be purp'ed out
I ain't talkin' 'bout I no weed

Bust down, twin Rollies
Bust ya down, try to rob me
Whoa
Passport, get you stamped
Have you ever flown on a jet?
Baby, let me take you there
Pick a place, we go there
Eeny meeny minie moe
We spend it all 'cause there's plenty more

[Chorus: Tish Hyman]
100 thousand cash, I can show you what it feels like
Birkin bag, I can show you what it feels like
200 on the dash, I can show you what it feels like
That's a real ass 'cause I know what it feels like
Weeks in Dubai, I can show you what it feels like
Thousand dollar meals, I can show you what it feels like
Trapping on the grind, I can show you what it feels like
Tell you that I'm on and that's what it feels like
