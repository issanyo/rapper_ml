[Hook: Lil Durk]
She tellin' me she want me, want me, want me, want me, want me
You call me then I'm on it, on it, on it, on it, on it
She say [?] don't be so phony, phony, phony, phony, phony
Put that pussy over that money, money, money, money, money
I know she got that good, good, good, good, good, good
With me she know she good, good, good, good, good, good
Put a ring on it if I could, could, could, could, could, could
I just want my name on it, I just want my name on it
I just want my name on it

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I don't wanna a basic bitch, I don't care where she is
Asking for anything, I don't let her wait for shit
Talk as little as a pump, I give a fuck just to get over her
Hoes in the past, can't get over them
Fuck her once, I'm Kanye and Kim
I put my tongue, I'ma swirl in it
Time of the month came opposite of early
You ever see the bitch
Lay her down, eat her shit
Turn her over, beat her shit
Put my name on her, I'ma pray on it
She say she gon' ride for me
Take a case and die for me
Bonnie and Clyde and ride for me
And I know that she love me

[Hook: Lil Durk]
She tellin' me she want me, want me, want me, want me, want me
You call me then I'm on it, on it, on it, on it, on it
She say [?] don't be so phony, phony, phony, phony, phony
Put that pussy over that money, money, money, money, money
I know she got that good, good, good, good, good, good
With me she know she good, good, good, good, good, good
Put a ring on it if I could, could, could, could, could, could
I just want my name on it, I just want my name on it
I just want my name on it

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
I'ma put my name on him, that's that D-E-J
Stop playin' with that bitch, I ain't with them games
Girl pussy, yeah I put it all over your face
69, yeah, that's how we make
We off that lean I got this nigga wide awake
All these fifties, all these hundreds, I'ma give away
How you got a family, and I don't feel ashamed
You know what you was doin', you know we felt the same
You know we felt the same
You know we felt the same
I got that good good
I said I got that good good

[Hook: Lil Durk]
She tellin' me she want me, want me, want me, want me, want me
You call me then I'm on it, on it, on it, on it, on it
She say [?] don't be so phony, phony, phony, phony, phony
Put that pussy over that money, money, money, money, money
I know she got that good, good, good, good, good, good
With me she know she good, good, good, good, good, good
Put a ring on it if I could, could, could, could, could, could
I just want my name on it, I just want my name on it
I just want my name on it

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Cause I know you got that good good, but you know you're such a bad bitch
I can't help myself but look when, you make that ass backflip
I smack that, on some next shit, got a nigga fiending on some crack shit
In a bikini in Pacsun, you too good, you must practice
All of the moves, hittin' a nigga with combos up in the condo
To tell you the truth, the pussy so good, feel like I ain't wearin' a condom
Scratch your head down, after tonight, you're gonna have to hit the salona
I swear every time you feel like a virgin again, you must be Madonna
Feel like a sauna, we done got the hot box goin'
Shawty such a freak she don't never keep her socks on
Buck naked, said that body so amazin'
Keep a secret like a mason, how you move it like you make it

[Hook: Lil Durk]
She tellin' me she want me, want me, want me, want me, want me
You call me then I'm on it, on it, on it, on it, on it
She say [?] don't be so phony, phony, phony, phony, phony
Put that pussy over that money, money, money, money, money
I know she got that good, good, good, good, good, good
With me she know she good, good, good, good, good, good
Put a ring on it if I could, could, could, could, could, could
I just want my name on it, I just want my name on it
I just want my name on it
