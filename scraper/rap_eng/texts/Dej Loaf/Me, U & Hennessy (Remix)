[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
Can we stay home tonight?
Try somethin' new tonight?
This drink got me feelin' right
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin' and spinnin' me
My head keep on spinnin'
My legs keep on shakin', but my head keep on spinnin'
I'm out of my mind, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin'
I throw it back and you catch my driftin'
You shiftin' inside, you got me screamin'
You got me yellin' out your name, ooh, I need you
You kiss on my thighs and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I'm lovin' this ride, smooth like a Beamer
Smooth like that Henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I'm not goin' to lie, you got me speechless
Got sixty-nine, more than twenty-five reasons

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Me, Hennessy and you, me, Hennessy and you
Me, Hennessy and you, me, Hennessy and you
You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy and you, aye
Aye, this what happens when we drinkin'
Me, Hennessy and you, me, Hennessy and you

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Me, Hennessy and you, me, Hennessy and you
Me, Hennessy and you, me, Hennessy and you
You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say, my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy and you, aye
Aye, this what happens when we drinkin'
Me, Hennessy and you, me, Hennessy and you

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Really love the bitch cause she be stayin' in her place
That's my mind wonderin'
Forgive me, that's my mind wonderin'
When she shove shaved pussy in my face, yellin' 'Gates'
It be mind-bogglin' when me and Dej Loaf sixty-nine
Wonder why you be hard to describe
She don't mind garglin'
When she breakin' down the weed and roll the sticky broccoli
Yo me llam√≥ Luca Brasi, bae, that's what they call me
You know, whenever it get gangsta, baby, you can call me
MAC-11 gonna ring and everybody fallin'
Disappear without a trace and we been missin' all week
Galleria out in Houston, now we back to ballin'
Run all I got from any prospect, can you handle this?
Tell me, when I hit you from behind, you feel it in your spine?
Rubbin' my tats while in the shower, bae, you got a thug
Balenciaga-rockin', makin' Luca Brasi love

[Outro: Dej Loaf]
You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say, my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy and you, aye
Aye, this what happens when we drinkin'
Me, Hennessy and you, me, Hennessy and you
