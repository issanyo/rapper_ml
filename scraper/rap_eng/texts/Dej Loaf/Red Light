I might fuck you at the red light, like it's bed time
Power of the p, got this nigga with his head right, yeah

He can sing, but I wonder what his sex like
Ooh, He got my, he got my legs high
Slide my panties over, get on top and I just exercise
Rewind, pause don't play
Pull over and park, we been at it all day

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees & DeJ Loaf]
So wassup with that wassup
What you got in your cup?

If you don't drink that's no fun
You know where we come from
I can use some more love
Won't you give it up to no one
Even though you ain't my only

I'm starting to think that you into me
Cup full of rum and Hennessy
Ooh girl, I'm into your energy
I'm tryna see where you come from
I'm tryna make you the one, one
That pussy so good, when I go in, I swear that I go numb, numb
I want you to get on top of me
Talk that nigga when you toppin' me
Some in this liquor, but I'm feelin' all right
Ride down 20, take 285
I got tints on my window, so they won't see when you ride

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees & DeJ Loaf]
So wassup with that wassup (wassup)

Give it up to no one (no one)
Even though you ain't my only
