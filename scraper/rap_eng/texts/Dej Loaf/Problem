[Intro Dej Loaf & GT]
I'm in the studio I'll call you back
Uh, Uh
Let's get it talk to 'em
Dej Loaf, wassup Oba
Aye, Woah, Woah, Woah

[Verse 1 Dej Loaf]
I know what the problem is
I'll find out where yo momma live and buy the crib
I don't got no kids, I'm seedless
Baby you thirsty, you teethin'
My brother, he come home, in another week
I been gettin' money, I ain't been gettin' no sleep
I been a G, my grandma told me that talk is cheap
So don't talk to me pussy, open up yo mouth you gotta talk to this pussy
I be gone off that Henn, might just off me a pussy
So wet, I make them gargle this pussy
Free my granddad and all my cousins
Tell all of my niggas, that I love 'em
Momma no more strugglin'
We about to shit, on all these bitches and they daughters
I'm talkin' Big B's and Rarri's
I'm in the Impala with Oba watchin' Martin
Am I friendly? No, not hardly
Niggas talkin' crazy don't know shit about me

[Verse 2 GT]
One time for the brick man
Two times for the lean man
Got me sittin' like a bike on a kick stand
Everybody keep dough round me
Everybody love Dej Loaf round me
Down in LA with a freak
She say she that I'm lucky she don't fuck for free
I told her she stuck up, I say shut the fuck up
So sit back relax and roll up a tree
My, my young nigga 16
Ridin' round with beams, chewin' on beans
Send beans OT I ain't gotta leave
Do everything just to get that cheese
You ain't know a nigga was a drug dealer
You ain't the rap nigga, was a trap nigga
Hustle hard you a come around stacks nigga
Got everything you need, pull back nigga
All of the dealer I know
Keep bright Ice, fast whips, off Snow
Know a couple niggas that wealthy off blow
Talk lowkey you'ont even gotta know
Aye, I know niggas that never fuck with the scams they only know grams
You niggas on the gram don't know the half
Why come back? You can get it while you can

[Oba Rowland]
Lil Newbie and Cuzzo Henry
Shit got me stressin'
By the time they get out, the world might look like The Jetson
I'm so 100, somebody remind me my name is not Benjamin [x3]
I'm so 100, remind what the fuck a 50 is
