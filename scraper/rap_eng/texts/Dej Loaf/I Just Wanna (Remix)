[Intro: DeJ Loaf..]
If I let you hit
You gotta promise me you ain't gonna fall in love
Already, already
Already
Make you fall heavy

[Verse 1: Elijah Blake]
You know wassup, pour another cup
Let that liquor hold your sentence, why you gotta talk so much?
Not tryna fuss, but I'm in a rush
See you movin' them lips but not on this so you ain't saying much
Tried to be polite, but you ain't acting right
Sit yo pretty ass on this bed, make a v-shape with your legs
That's it, that's it

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), with you
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), I do
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up

[Verse 2: Elijah Blake]
I admit it, I admit it
When I said I came to kick it
Girl I was lyin' (lyin')
I got so damn carried away
There's nothin' left that I can say
I want you now, I need you now
I gotta hit that shit somehow, somehow
I gotta hit that shit somehow, right now

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), with you
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), I do
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
It's been a long week and I need it
Just got rid of him, I'm single
I feel good about this evening
Let's hit the strip and throw singles
You done blew 10,000 that easy
Might as well bring the bitch home with us
Oh shit that sounds like a threesome
Must be the Henny talking, I'm trippin'
Whippin, we dippin, back to the crib with me
I hope you got Jimmy shit, don't get offended
The windows is tinted, the liquor in my system
I'm really a shooter, I bust like a semi
I know I'm fucking up my liver and kidneys
I know this shit's wild
Shots of that brown
I'm out of my mind

[Chorus: Elijah Blake & Dej Loaf]
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), with you
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), I do
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
