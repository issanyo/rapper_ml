[Verse 1: Sevyn Streeter]
Remember when we first met?
When we used to slow dance
I was with you, I was on that
We ain't know nothing 'bout romance
I met you back in high school when we was in high school
Talking 'bout the homecoming
I let you in my home, "Come in"
You all mine and I'm all yours, that's what we here for
Let's 2 Step, baby, on the living room floor
Let's 1-2-touch, need one more touch
What a waterfall (What a waterfall)
You can pin me up like I'm a portrait on a wall
I make the Winter time shine, feel like the Bahamas
I got your name stored, special ringtone when you call
Don't nothing change but the seasons
Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
If I throw it back just like a old school
Can you take it back just like a old school track?
If I throw it back just like a old school
Can you take it back just like a old school track?

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Want 100% of your 12 play
Confessions, you're gettin' in my way
Can you stand the rain like Bobby?
Who gon' Keith Sweat you? Nobody
From the window to the wall
I'mma ying-yang your body
Make my hips hop and hooray
By nature, we gettin' naughty
Want 100% of your 12 play
Confessions, you're gettin' in my way
Can you stand the rain like Bobby?
Who gon' Keith Sweat you? Nobody
From the window to the wall
I'mma ying-yang your body
Make my hips hop and hooray
By nature, we gettin' naughty

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
What I'm gon' do, girl, I want to
What I'm onto
Michael Jack off the wall, yeah, I had to beat it
Got my hands on your heart like the Pledge of 'Legiance
What we do, you don't gotta say
Real talk, no conversation
Simon says, baby touch your ankles
Got your body at a 90 degree
You got that old school type of thing
Throw it back to the '90s
Don't make it out the driveway
Baby, turn me on, you got the right of way
Don't need no GPS, baby, let me get it, I'mma find a way
Know that, that sundress, sunshine any time of day
Sevyn, run that back, yeah, I'm thinkin' it's time to play

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
If I throw it back just like a old school
Can you take it back just like a old school track?
If I throw it back just like a old school
Can you take it back just like a old school track?

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Want 100% of your 12 play
Confessions, you're gettin' in my way
Can you stand the rain like Bobby?
Who gon' Keith Sweat you? Nobody
From the window to the wall
I'mma ying-yang your body
Make my hips hop and hooray
By nature, we gettin' naughty

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
I won't tell if you won't tell 'em
Sit right there, kick off your Margielaâ€™s
Caught up in the rap shit, yeah, that's my favorite
Can't nobody tell me shit about Anita Baker
Want you to hit it back a few, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh
We gon' freak it all night, baby, take off your robe
Face rides, yeah, what up your nose
Ah, Dej ain't nothin' like your hoes
25, but I got a old soul
I be off the gin and juice, I'm feeling you, yeah, I'm into you
All of that shit you do, I'm into you
Homie, lover, friend, like the old days
Yeah, homie, lover, friend, like the old days
Used to stand in line for the new J's
Now we older listenin' to the O'Jay's, yeah
I used to be your girl, I used to be your world, yeah
And I know it's been years, but

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
If I throw it back just like a old school
Can you take it back just like a old school track?
If I throw it back just like a old school
Can you take it back just like a old school track?

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Want 100% of your 12 play
Confessions, you're gettin' in my way
Can you stand the rain like Bobby?
Who gon' Keith Sweat you? Nobody
From the window to the wall
I'mma ying-yang your body
Make my hips hop and hooray
By nature, we gettin' naughty
Want 100% of your 12 play
Confessions, you're gettin' in my way
Can you stand the rain like Bobby?
Who gon' Keith Sweat you? Nobody
From the window to the wall
I'mma ying-yang your body
Make my hips hop and hooray
By nature, we gettin' naughty
