[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
This for the girls that don't need no makeup when they wake up
For the ones who rockin' lace fronts, you know, I ain't gon' say nothin
Hashtag and you're single, you fresh off the break-up
For the introverts, no, we don't gotta say much

[Pre-Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
If you feel free then you should lift your hands
Real love, less friends
So many things in this world I don't understand
I won't judge who you love, or your brown skin

[Chorus: Leon Bridges, with DeJ Loaf]
People gettin' liberated
Get up on your feet if you got the feeling
Hey, get up on your feet
People gettin' liberated
Get up on your feet if you got the feeling
Get up on your feet
People gettin' liberated

[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
Fight back for so long, baby, break on outta your chains
You don't have to aim to please, or be a certain way
Don't aspire to be what you see in the magazines
There's only one you, and one me

[Pre-Chorus: Dej Loaf & Leon Bridges]
If you feel free then you should lift your hands
Wanna shake it, baby (shake it, baby) like I know you can
So many things in this world I don't understand
I won't judge who you love, or your brown skin

[Chorus: Leon Bridges, with DeJ Loaf]
People gettin' liberated
Get up on your feet if you got the feeling
Hey, get up on your feet
Say, people gettin' liberated
Get up on your feet if you got the feeling
Hey, get up on your feet
People gettin' liberated

[Bridge: DeJ Loaf]
When I was young, I was told, "What you reap is what you sow"
Life ain't always sunny, don't get caught up in the glow
And I don't know it all but I see as I grow
Can't take the pain away 'cause it's in my soul

[Pre-Chorus: DeJ Loaf & Leon Bridges]
If you feel free then you should lift your hands
Wanna shake it, baby (wanna shake it, baby) like I know you can
So many things in this world I don't understand
I won't judge who you love, or your brown skin

[Chorus: Leon Bridges, with DeJ Loaf & DeJ Loaf]
People gettin' liberated
Hey, get up on your feet if you got the feeling
You got the feeling
You can be free
Get up on your feet
Say, people gettin' liberated
(Dahhh, dah dah, dah dah, dah dah)
(Dahhh, dah dah, dah dah, dah dah)
Get up on your feet if you got the feeling
(Dahhh, dah dah, dah dah, dah dah)
(Dahhh, dah dah, dah dah, dah dah)
You ain't gotta worry no more
Get up on your feet
