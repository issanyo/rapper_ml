Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
These drinks got me feeling right
I'm touching your legs and thighs
You, me and Patrón, girl we gon' get it on
You Drinking So Fast Now I Gotchu In My Zone
The Bed Gon Be Breaking
Yo Legs Keep On Shaking, But The Bed Keep On Breaking
Im Out Of My Mind
Lets Keep On Drinking
I Gotchu Yelling Out My Name Dej You Need Me
I Wanna Love You From The Front So I Can Feel You Breathing
And Since You Bad I Beat Yo Back, Girl I Give You A Beating
Pulling On Yo Hair , Now You Telling Me How Much You Need Me
Put You On The Floor, Open Yo Legs and Then I Start To Eat It
Im Kissing All On Yo Thighs Got Yo Body Feigning
You Spilling Everything That What Happens When We Drinking
Lets lay down ,Imma Get It From The Side
Ooh Girl , You Run Chills Down My Spine
When We Finish With That We Gon Do It Again
Jacquees Gon Be In It Until The Morning

Me, Patrón and you
Me, Patrón and you
Me, Patrón and you
Me, Patrón and you

You, me, & Patron, girl, we gon get it on
The bed gon be breaking
