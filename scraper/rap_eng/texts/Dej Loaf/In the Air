[Intro]
So we got stopped at the airport on the way back from South Africa. And we home and they stop us, they wanna go through our bags. He was going through my purse and he see my money and he's like "how much is this?". And I'm like "I don't know how much is this sir, I just grabbed it from the crib I don't know". that's why we need a jet, man it's crazy

[Verse 1]
We don't wave right
I don't wanna hear these new niggas, put on some Mary J Blige
This for my niggas on them train rides
This for my niggas selling canine
For the ones who only made it to the graveyard
I'm right here chilling by your graveside
By your headstone
That nigga know he dead wrong
If we don't catch you then we gon' get your mans gone
Chanel gloves when my hands cold
Stop playing with me, I’m tryna make plans, hoe
Can't trust these pussies cause they sneaky
Say I'm untouchable but niggas can't reach me
Out of this world, way out your region
Get away, baby, meet me in Waikiki

[Hook]
But I got some people I can't let down
The music good and you killing when you dressed down
Look at all these bitches having meltdowns
Don't pretend like we're cool when I come around
Something tells me that they don't like me
Something tells me I shoulda worn my Nikes
How did I get snaked by the bitch beside me?
Something told me that the bitch was sheisty

[Verse 2]
Couple phone calls, no charge, shit priceless
No cast, no (?), somebody getting wired
Be quiet
Somebody getting wired
Gotta keep couple Omar Littles
Turn your head blue, Marge Simpson
Knots like Bantu, nigga turn your head (?)
Dej you be chilling, feeling can't stand you
Of course they can't
Bitches mad cause I ain't forcing it
I'm enforcing shit
This yellow world, we turn all the boys to men
Girls to women, it's more to it
How you see it? I see us on some corporate shit
You niggas can't block my blessings
Aim shots, I'ma buy my vests
It ain't no ho in my blood, it ain't in my vessels
Came back on the niggas, we was down like 7
That's buckets
All hustle, no luck
Elevator going up
I was halfway there, they was hoping I was stuck
I see envy in they eyes, Power 105.1
It ain't about being tough but you can scram if you soft
Chucking deuces at you pussys, niggas ain't lifting a thumb
I done seen niggas go from a loaf to crumb
I done seen bitches go from a boss to a bum
I survived the rain in the storm
I'ma start a family and teach it all to my sons
Tell ‘em how I came up, tell 'em I’m a monster

[Outro]
I'm a beast
And I can't tell you how many niggas I killed
How many bullets I dodged, how much money I earned
But I can tell you that I won't stop now
Can't let my people down, no
This ain't no easy road, this ain't no easy life
Before you wish for it, you should think twice
I said think twice, Loaf
