[Intro]
Funny niggas, man I swear these niggas tickle me, yeah
Rock got slaps

[Verse 1]
DeJ, you a dog, finally off of your leash
They say give a dog a bone, but I'm a fuckin' beast
Which means I need a fuckin' feast
Watch your mouth or get punched in your fuckin' teeth
If I cut you off, you prolly was a fuckin' leech
Bloodsuckers, rather fuck with my blood brothers
I like 'em 30 plus, ooh, ooh, I'm a mothafucka
I don't like violence, but I want the title
If smoke come with that, then I gotta draw fire
They say, "DeJ, where you been? Turn it up, why you hidin'?"
They buried me alive, I had to climb out my coffin
Countin' me out, hopin' that I retire
Fendi, my feet, mix it with Givenchy
She want you, she want me, she see diamonds and rings
It's Yellow World, baby, nah, nah, this ain't neon
I got some family that died that I still ain't grieve on
And I don't know how I'm survivin', but I gotta keep on
This all white Off-White got me feelin' reborn
If they don't get that nigga gone, I'ma need a refund
So many secrets that I know, I would never speak on

[Pre-Chorus]
Lot of niggas, they be prayin', they prayin' on me
Lord protect me from my friends and my enemies
Still ain't chasin' shit, drop ice in my Hennessy
Tell them bitches stand down, no fear in me
Told the Lord take it out, take it out of me
Take me out my shell, I wanna spread my wings
Told my niggas, "Let's eat, yeah, it's dinnertime"
Yellow World, it's the mothafuckin' enterprise

[Chorus]
Like go, DeJ, go
Yeah, I said go, DeJ, go
Go, DeJ, go
I said go, DeJ, go
Go, DeJ, go
I said, I said, go, DeJ, go
Go, DeJ, go
Let them bitches know, let them bitches know

[Verse 2]
Switchin' lanes in that mothafuckin' Bentley now
Lost my friends, so I am not friendly now
Somethin' 'bout it, I just cannot beef around
Don't see how y'all do it, y'all bitches crazy now
I mind my business, I get my paper, dawg
How can y'all not mention me when it's rap involved?
Your favorite rapper's rapper, your favorite rapper's cappin'
I know you don't like me, you see me, don't dap me
Don't tweet me, don't at me, don't Instagram chat me
Don't Snapchat that pussy 'cause everyone's had it
I see it, I grab it, I want it, I wear it
A fan of myself, I just might start cheerin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Lot of niggas, they be prayin', they prayin' on me
Lord protect me from my friends and my enemies
Still ain't chasin' shit, drop ice in my Hennessy
Tell them bitches stand down, no fear in me
Told the Lord take it out, take it out of me
Take me out my shell, I wanna spread my wings
Told my niggas, "Let's eat, yeah, it's dinnertime"
Yellow World, it's the mothafuckin' enterprise

[Chorus]
Like go, DeJ, go
Yeah, I said go, DeJ, go
Go, DeJ, go
I said go, DeJ, go
Go, DeJ, go
I said, I said, go, DeJ, go
Go, DeJ, go
Let them bitches know, let them bitches know

[Outro]
They can't fuck with you, go, DeJ, go
They can't fuck with you, go, DeJ, go
Go, DeJ, go
No way, no way, no sir
Go, DeJ, go
Go, DeJ, go
