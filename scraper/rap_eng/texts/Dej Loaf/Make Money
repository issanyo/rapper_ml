Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money

[Verse 1]
I think I seen this on the TV show
Bitch you ain’t heard of me before
Been there, done that, that’s my old ho
I was feeling like you need to know
Niggas tryna sneak diss
F&N, pussy peep this
It’s a flood, pussy leaking
Cleanup on aisle 3 shit
Charge it to the game, no defense
In the game, tryna stay away from bleachers
I just got to stay away from leeches
Cause I got a good heart, heart decent
Brown skin, short hair, come and get this
Low down dirty shame, call me peaches
One after another, that’s a sequence
I ain’t really really into all that beefing
All these nigga rats for that cheese shit
Snitching, telling everything they seen shit
Bout that action, I might pop up on his seam quick
Come through and shoot shoot, leave the scene quick
Yo

[Hook]
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money

[Verse 2]
Baby I can’t dance, I can’t bust no moves
But my diamonds they be dancing and might bust a move
Let a nigga try me, we gon’ bust a move
They hit the block, being high like [Chris Tucker] do
Chillin’, watching crush [groove]
[Oba] fat boy, what’s up dude?
We might pull up in a truck or two
You can’t get in, we don’t fuck with you
Lazy ass niggas don’t make no moves
Ain't check us at the door, we got in with the tools
One shot boom, two shoots ooh
I don’t know shit, I’m like who shot who?
Margiela’s, Chanel, I’m giving ‘em hell
This shit should be a crime
I bet I make bail
Hold up, wait, fuck 12
I only pop champagne just to pour it in the air, yeah

[Hook]
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money

[Verse 3]
In my Rolls, read the newspaper
8 ball, left pocket on the pool table
Stash the money in the pool table
Walk in, I need ones and a booth table
All these hoes love money, I’m [convinced] baby
I love money too, I’m a boss baby
I been going nuts getting off lately
Out of your league, I need that money like the golf player
Me and you together, heart to heart baby
I’m just joking, just a thought baby
You ain’t got no job, boy you Tommy
All these fake ass mobs, y’all not Italian
Used to hit the candy lady and get Laffy Taffys
Back when they was singing “Girl shake that Laffy Taffy”
Niggas don’t come direct, niggas try be petty
I ain’t lying, I got 100 in my fanny packy

[Hook]
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
Make money money, make money money
Take money money, take money money
