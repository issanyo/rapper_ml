(Spoken Intro)
[WOMAN]
Look at her butt! That is so gross! It's so big and huge and fat! Plump and giant! Flabby and humongous! I mean, she has got a weight problem! She must be one of those rapper's girlfriends!

(Verse 1)
[TRAIL MIX-A-LOT]
I like big girls and I cannot lie
Even when they're big and wide
Swoopin,' swaggin' and cheesy
You know that meat is greasy
Scoopin' up chips and hot wings
Eatin' cookies and ice cream
Rubbin' on burgers and fries
Feedin' those big ol' thighs
Oh baby, I wanna get wit ya
'Cause your pants don't fit ya
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that gut, you got me "Me So Horny"
Ooh, too much pork skins
Your butt can't fit in my Benz
It's smelly jelly
Feed that big ol' belly
I see her huffin'
Chokin' on milk and muffins
With butt and gut
She's shaped like a Nissan truck
All them magazines
Say you always gotta be lean
You wanna put a big girl in a real good mood?
She's gotta have some food
So fellas (yeah!) fellas (yeah!), you really like your woman stacked?
(Hell yeah!)
Then feed her, please her, feed her some Cracker Jacks
Baby's got snacks

(Hook)
L.A. face with a big ol' ass

(Verse 1)
Till the break of dawn
Baby got food on
There's really not much to say
Neck's so thick
She could eat a brick
If it's made by Frito-Lay
She's down and round
You want a buffet throwdown?
She's suckin' and lickin'
'Cause she's eatin' up chicken
So ladies (yeah!) ladies (yeah!) do you really wanna go to Shakey's?
(Hell yeah!)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even Hitler's gotta shout
Baby's got snacks

(Hook)
L.A. face with a big ol' ass

(Verse 3)
So your girlfriend eats a salad
Lookin' like bones, you've had it
Head shaped like a Lincoln
So skinny, you can see what she's thinkin'
So take it from Trail Mix-a-Lot, you want a girlfriend you can dig?
Then give her hug, 'cause there's more to love, ain't nothin' wrong with bein' big

(Outro)
Baby's got snacks
Yeah, baby, butt's so big, when she backs up, sounds like "Beep, beep, beep!"
