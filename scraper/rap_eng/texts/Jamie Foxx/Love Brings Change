Now, maybe the world doesn't see you
And maybe they don't understand
Just 'cause you don't see the footprints
Don't mean that they're not in the sand

I know you're surrounded by strangers
It feels so alone in your heart
But when everyone stands in the darkness
No one can tell them apart

Now everyone has their own stories
And nobody's end's quite the same
I love for the days in the sunshine
Up over the nights in the rain

But love brings change, oh, yes it does
(Love brings change, change)
Love brings change
(Love brings change, change)
Oh, love brings change when you need it
(Love, love, love brings change)

When you look eye to eye with an angel
Don't mean that it's always the end
Sometimes it's the start of a new blessing
That comes in the form of a friend

Now we all live in fear of when that day will come
When memories are all we can hold
The fire that burns is a natural love
And it keeps us both warm when it's cold

Now all I wanna do is see ya laugh again
And see that same joy in your eyes
I know that you're trying to just keep on smiling
And everything passes with time

'Cause love brings change
(Love brings change, change)
Oh, love brings change
(Love brings change, change)
It is a fact, ay, ay, ay
(Love, love )
Love brings change, love brings change

Be still, wait on it
On the blessings, girl
In the morning time, yeah
Be still, wait on it
Change is gonna come, oh oh
