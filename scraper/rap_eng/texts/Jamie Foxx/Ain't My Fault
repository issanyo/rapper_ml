[Intro]
Pop the champagne and let it rain all over the world
Me and my girl about to do the twirl on the dance floor

[Verse 1]
Who told you to walk up to me with them Louboutin's so high?
Baddest bitch I've seen in my life, 'bout to make your boyfriend cry, make him cry baby
Lord knows, when you were sitting in front of your mirror at home
You knew that you were 'bout to get yours, why the hell you put that black dress on? It's so cold

[Hook]
It ain't my fault, just blame it on the dress that you bought
I blame it on the way that you walked in the club and stole my heart
It ain't my, ain't my fault
It ain't my, ain't my fault

[Verse 2]
You know you're wrong baby, but why would you bring him along then sneak and meet me in the bathroom stall?
Slide 'em to the side, don't take 'em all the way off
Lord knows, when you were sitting in front of your mirror at home
You knew that you were 'bout to get yours, why the hell you put that black dress on? It's so cold

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It ain't my fault, you know you wrong, it ain't my fault
You knew that dress was the baddest, as soon as you put it on
It ain't my fault, you know you wrong, it ain't my fault
If homie don't know he's leaving here alone, it's ain't my

[Hook]
