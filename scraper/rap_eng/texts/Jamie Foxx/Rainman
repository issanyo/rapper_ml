[Intro]
Rainman, rainman, rainman, rainman
Ca-call me ca-call me rainman, rainman

[Verse 1]
There's no need for me to lay out my clothes
When she's not around there's nowhere to go
Make no attempts getting up out of this bed
I wanna open my eyes but I just close the curtains instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Her thunderstorms shuts my lights off oooohhhhh
I got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow, cause right now I just can't catch a break

[Chorus]
Everyday it rains
When she ain't laying right here I can feel the coolness in the air I know my chances ain't fair
Everyday it rains
Would it be just my window seal sound reaches my ear go then It reappears
Everyday it rains
My heart starts drowning my vision gets cloudy the flood Moves around me
Everyday it rains
No sign of the light as the time goes by 40 days and 40 nights

[Verse 2]
Just when I thought I've gotten rid of you
I turn my face to your pillow that's soaked in your perfume
The waters raging, no life vest, and I can't swim through, through no
My heart, and my mind, and my soul it's lost somewhere in this deep blue

[Pre-Chorus]
Her thunderstorms shut my lights off oooohhhh
I got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow cause right now I just can't get a break

[Chorus]
Everyday it rains
When she ain't laying right here I can feel the coolness in the air I know my chances ain't fair
Everyday it rains
Would it be just my window seal sound reaches my ear go then It reappears
Everyday it rains
My heart starts drowning my vision gets cloudy the flood Moves around me
Everyday it rains
No sign of the light as the time goes by 40 days and 40 nights

[Outro]
Baby cut my lights (cut my lights)
Back on (back on baby)
Take me out your storm (Take me out your storm)
Baby cut my lights (cut my lights)
Back on (back on baby)
Release me (release me)
Release me from the sea
Ohhhhh uhh ohhhh rainman, rainman, rainman
