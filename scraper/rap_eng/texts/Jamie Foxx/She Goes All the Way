[Verse 1]
No limits, no lines are drawn
The whole world disappears when
We're alone
That thin white cotton dress is
Blowin' in the wind
She takes my hand and the dance begins

[Chorus]
With every move she makes
I'm deeper than I've been
Holding on and letting go
She just keeps giving in
Taking me higher and further
There she goes again giving more than
She takes
Because it's more than love she makes
She goes all the way

[Verse 2]
No questions, no talking at all
Only the sound of our hearts as the fall
No matter what I need, her answer's
Always yes
I only have to dream and she does the
Rest

[Chorus][X2]

[Outro]
Ooo, ooo, ooo
My baby goes all the way, the way
She goes all the way
My baby goes all the way
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
