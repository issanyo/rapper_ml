[Intro: Pitbull]
Let's, Mr.Worldwide take over, MK, The
Jim Johnson, Globe, let's take over the globe

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Where do we go from here?
World, tell me please
Where do we go from here?
I want the world to tell me please

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Pitbull]
Where do we go from here?
Somebody please let me know
Where do we go from here?
I want the whole world to show
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
And I don't wanna do it alone, I want the world to dance

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
How you gon' tell me the sky's the limit
When there's footprints on the moon?
I don't need a TV show to dance with the stars
Not me I'm good
Half of the world don't like me
Half of the world wanna be me
But believe it or not
That pretty little thing they call Earth needs me
I'm here to show the world
What it is to make something from nothing
Yeah fo sho
I'm here to show the world
What it is to do good business
How to blew what I blow
I'm here to show the world that money don't buy happiness, believe me I know
But just one thing, once I've showed the world
I just wanna know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
As the suns rotates and Pit gets bigger
The more countries in the world I hit em all
Armando Bond, double 0-305, aka. Mr.Worldwide
Don't be silly, I've had it on lock and that's fo sho
I've already changed my city
Now I'm on my way to change the globe
I'm tryna inspire the world to show 'em what it is
When you hustle and you work hard
Show 'em what it is to put your life on the line
For the love of the grind
Life is a rhyme with no reason
And that's the reason that I rhyme
But once I show the globe
I just wanna know

[Pre-Chrous & Chorus]
