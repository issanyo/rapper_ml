Well its been 5 years
Can't hold back my tears
Cause I'm just so happy I'm marrying an angel today oooo
As I take your hand
I pledge to be your man
I vow to love to hold to cherish
And never disrespect the love we share
I'll be honest I can not lie
There'll be real good days
There'll be some bad times
I'll be standing right be side you my sweet baby
With the love of mine
And you take this ring
And i place it on your sweet and lovely hand
We will show our kids
They will tell their kids
What mom and daddy did
On the day I married my angel
I love you my angel
