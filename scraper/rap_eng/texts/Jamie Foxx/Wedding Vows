Well it's been 5 years, can't hold back my tears
Cause I'm just so happy I'm marrying an angel today
Oh. As I take your hand, I'll pledge to be your man
I vow to love, to hold, to cherish and never disrespect
The love we share

I'll be honest, I cannot lie, there'll be real good days
There'll be some bad times. I'll be standing right beside you
My sweet baby with my love of mine

And you take this ring, and I'll place it on your sweet and loving hand
We will show our kids, they will tell their kids what mom and daddy did
On the day I'm marrying my angel. I love you my angel
