[Verse 1]
Girl you're my delight, 100% no feeling
Damn I gotta thank my plug, your love equals drug, and I got it bad now
Girl, did I mention, I'm different when you're missing
Find myself on rainy days, only you could save the day, girl I need your help now

[Pre-Hook]
All I know is that when I'm with you
One kiss, one kiss, one kiss, woo, and I'm gone than a mo'fucker
Your lips, your lips, your lips, woo, got me stormed than a mo'fucker
'Bout to take it to the head now, I, baby

[Hook]
I think I need another dose, I feel like I'm coming down
Girl you know your love is dope, I'm feining and I need it now
I think I need another dose, I feel like I'm coming down
Girl you know your love is dope, I need it and I need it now

[Verse 2]
Imagine waking up and you gotta have it
I'm talking morning, night and noon
Imagine feeling like an addict
Just one hit from you

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge]
We had an agreement, girl you know I need it, tryna end have your love
Girl you got me so high, baby that ain't no lie, don't think I ever, every get enough
We had an agreement, girl you know I need it, tryna end have your love
Girl you got me so high, baby that ain't no lie, don't think I ever, every get enough

[Hook]

[Outro]
Feeling like I'm coming down, I'm coming down, yeah
