Tell me have you heard the story
That took place not long ago
Bout an angel up in heaven
They say she up and ran away from home

Word is she had unfinished business
So back on earth she had to flee
Well you know I'm so elated
Because she's laying right here next to me

And when God woke up that morning
And he called out her name
And when she did not answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the same
[Background Vocal:] Heaven will never be the same [2x]

Always dreamed that it would happen
I just didn't know exactly where
All my life I'd been waiting for something amazing
Said it took a while but now I know
So tell me can I get a witness
If you believe in miracles
And the proof I have is living
And my life will never ever be
And your life don't to be the...

At times it seems we take for granted
How precious life can be
Just hold on and I'm sure you'll understand it
Bringing into this world
A precious boy or a girl...And when God woke up that morning
Said where has my little angel gone
And when she didn't an...answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the....same
Yeah....Yeah
