Let me take my time with this one
My baby

Verse 1:
I don't know why the sun shines so brightly when I’m with you
I can’t explain the joy you bring my heart
Every moment I
I spend with you
But at times I’m not for sure on just exactly how you feel
I need an indication to show that love’s for real

Chorus:
Light a candle in the window if you care for me
Burn an everlasting light to prove your love
And if you believe for eternity that we’ll never be apart
Light a candle in the window
Just a sign to show that you’re in love

Verse 2:
Deep in my heart there a grows a love so special, a love deep
While I’m not for sure I should but it feel so good
To have your body right
Right next to me
And I’m not afraid of the choice I’ve made
I made up in my mind
You and me forever until the end of time

Chorus:
Light a candle in the window if you care for me
Burn an everlasting light to prove your love

Bridge:
And I’m not of afraid of the choice I’ve made
I made up in my mind
Light a candle in the window
Light a candle in the window
Just a sign so show that you’re in love
Shine a light down on me
Shine a light down on me
Shine on
Shine on
Light a candle in the window for my love
Light a candle in the window for my love
