[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
I’m feeling good, I’m having fun
This is the best night of my life
Girl can I be real?
I just wanna feel on your booty, that''s not a big deal
Shawty you drinkin on that Martini
I wanna see you in a bikini
Or better yet a thong, baby what’s wrong?
Tryna tell you girl its the purpose of this song
Ooh, I want you closer
You look like a model of a poster
I wanna get ya to the car, to the crib, up the stairs, to the bed
In the morning you’ll be cooking us set
Oooh baby, I love the smell of your perfume
And if we were kids I’d be breaking curfew
To stay up with you

[Pre-Hook: Jamie Foxx]
You gon need a scarf, wrap your head cause it’s gon get wild
If we keep lovin’ like this, we might make a child
A daughter, a son, whichever one
Girl your second to none

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I’m feeling good, I’m having fun
This is the best night of my life
With off that Patron and both of us gone
Girl this could be the best night of my life
You could been anywhere in the world
But you’re right here with me girl
And if we go home and make love
This could be the best night of your life

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
So girl let me ask you a question while we’re sipping bud
Are you going home with me after the club?
Thats a yes or a no, I’m just letting ya know
Where this night can go
And girl I’m hoping you see things my way
Cause I just want your love to stay
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, night, night, night

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I could be your bartender, tell me what you’re sippin’ on
Girl, I’m not a travel agent so what you trippin’ on
You say I think I could make it happen cause I’m famous
Nah, I’m just tryna get it cracking cause we faded
Get you to my crib, spend some time alone
Barely over 21, that mean you kinda grown
Ummm, and I’m tat, tat, tatted up
Come on to that bread, I’mma stack it up
Where you going? Baby girl back it up

[Pre-Hook: Jamie Foxx]
You gon need a scarf, wrap your head cause it’s gon get wild
If we keep lovin’ like this, we might make a child
A daughter, a son, whichever one
Girl your second to none

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I’m feeling good, I’m having fun
This is the best night of my life
We off the Patron and both of us grown
Girl this could be the best night of my life
You could been anywhere in the World
But you’re right here with me girl
And if we go home and make love
Girl this could be the best night of your life
