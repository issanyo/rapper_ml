[Chorus x2]
Baby if we leave the club
Won't be nothing but good lovin'
Cause I got a warm bed
I got a warm bed

[Verse 1]
Damn, it's hot, floor is locked
Can't believe all that ass that you got
Talking slick girl might get you got
If you do that again then I'ma have to arrest you
You telling me don't stop
You must not understand why they call me Foxx
For how long I can stay in the box
I all ready know how I plan to possess you

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss you right below your navel then rub you with oil
Bite on your ear
Till you stand up make you turn around and touch your toes
The next thing girl, you already know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Better yet, enough of the talking
Cause the Patron says it's time to get it popping
Bartender swipe the black card I'm walking
Cause she wants to do something like the girls in the films do
She wants to see if the Oscar was the fluke or is the nigga really proper
Guaranteed I can tell I got one
That is waiting for the camera to start rolling so she can let you

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]
