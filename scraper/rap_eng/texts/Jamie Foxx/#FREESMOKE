[Intro]
Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
It's over
Cut me up, Big E

[Hook]
We want all the smoke, I'm with all the smoke
I'm with all the smoke, We with all the smoke
We want all the smoke, We want all the smoke
I'm with all the smoke
Here I come beatin' down yo block with that ratchet
Follow him to the studio and let him have it
And I'm hoppin' out the Bentley, Bent with automatic
Choppa aim right at his head, let these nigga have it
Make these nigga vanish, Tie em up, throw em in the car, mini van (Pussy)
I see how you comin'
29 we ain't never go for nothin'

[Verse]
We want all the smoke, Boy yo dead partner get smoke
We lookin' for boat, We lookin' for boat
I just hope that you pussy niggas stay afloat
AK with the scope, Uzi gotta scope
Shoot that lil' nigga right dead in the throat
He can not speak, never spoke
The nigga is sad, he broke
Then Dior mad, he broke
Movin' around with the ice on my throat
Nigga try reach for my throat (50 racks)
Put it right on his dome (Kickback)
On that muh fucker strong
Then I heard that y'all jumped my bro
Let's get it, lets go
All my niggas with the shit and y'all nigga know
I'ma pull up with the stick, get hit with the pole
I'ma pull up on yo bitch I'ma give em off
I go give her through, Stupid lil' bit no I won't sell you a soul
Swear that these nigga gone jack it, no coat
Hit em with my .45 in the coupe
These nigga get cold, I got the dope in the boat
I fucked your mama now she wan' get it low

[Hook]
We want all the smoke, I'm with all the smoke
I'm with all the smoke, We with all the smoke
We want all the smoke, We want all the smoke
I'm with all the smoke
Here I come beatin' down yo block with that ratchet
Follow him to the studio and let him have it
And I'm hoppin' out the Bentley Bent with automatic
Choppa aim right at his head let these nigga have it
Make these nigga vanish
Tie em up, throw em in the car, mini van (Pussy)
I see how you comin'
29 we ain't never go for nothin'
