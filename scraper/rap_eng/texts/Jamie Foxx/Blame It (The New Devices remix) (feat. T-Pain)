Blame it on the Goose
Got you feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Hey, she says she usually don't
But I know that she front
'Cause shorty know what she want
But she don't want to seem like she's easy
I hear you sayin' what you won't do
But you know we probably gon' do
What you been fiendin' deep insi-i-i-ide
Don't let it out-out now

Girl, what you drinkin'?
Go on, let it sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinkin' we can see what we could be if we press fast-forward
Just one more round and you're down; I know it
Fill another cup up
Feelin' on your ass what
You don't even care now
I was unaware
How fine you was before my buzz set in
My buzz set in

Blame it on the Goose
Got you feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the Blue Tap
Got you feelin' dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Oopsy! She spilled some drink on me
And now I'm knowin' she tipsy
She put her body on me and she keeps starin' me right in my eyes
No tellin' what I'm gon' do
Baby, I would rather show you
What you been missin' in your li-i-i-ife
When I get insi-i-i-ide

Girl, what you drinkin'?
Go on, let it sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinkin' we can see what we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round if your down I'll pour it
Fill another cup up
Feelin' on your ass what
You don't even care now
I was unaware
How fine you was before my buzz set in
(My buzz set in)

Blame it on the Goose
Got you feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'tron

T-Pain. "...Alcohol"
Girl, I know you feel good just like you look
Couple more shots you open up like a book
I ain't trippin'
('Cause I'm a read ya)
Shorty, I ain't trippin'
I just wanna please ya
I'm a take shot up Nuvo
Shorty, then you know it's goin' down we can go and kick it like judo
You know what I mean
Shorty got drunk, I thought it all was a dream
So I made her say "Ah ah ah"
Now she got her hands on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride (All wet in my ride)
All over my ride (All over my ride)
She look me dead in the eye (Eye, eye)
Then my pants got bigger
She already knew what to figure
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like "Fuck that nigga!"

Blame it on the Goose

Blame it on the 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Now to the ballers poppin' bottles with they Henny in they cups
Screamin' "Money ain't a thing!"
If it ain't blow it up it's in the sky
And hold your drinks up high
Now to the independent bottles who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model when them broke fellas holla
Tell them "Bye"
And hold your drinks up high! Alright

You can blame it on the Goose
Got you feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
