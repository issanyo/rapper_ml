This is just the start of your story
If you got guts you get glory
Anyone can make it even you
In New York City

And now's the time you gota stand tough
Cause if you work hard you can rise up
Anyone can make it even you
In New York City

Look at me I'm just blood pumpin
You and me are two hearts thumpin
We are two souls giving the same feed

So take it all, the city's yours, it's worth fighting for, it's all yours
So take it all, the city's yours, it's worth fighting for, it's all mine
It's all yours
In New York City
In New York City
In New York City

So put your gloves start trainin
You gotta get wet when it's rainin
If you got heart you can make it too
In New York City

You see what I see look harder
You know we're the same when we start off
Four walks two heads one heart paired

So take it all, the city's yours, ask it for more, when you arrange a tour
So take it all, the city's yours, it's worth fighting for, it's all mine
It's all yours
In New York City
In New York City

So take it all
So take it all
The city's yours
The city's mine
It's worth fighting for
It's worth fighting for
It's all mine
It's all mine

So take it all
So take it all
The city's yours
The city's mine
It's worth fighting for
It's worth fighting for
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all yours
