[T.I.]
With the king uncaged
As seen on the stage
Sharp as a blade
Set to blow with no grenade
Kaboom you sucker nigga
Pussy like a wound
When the boys uncutting
The syringe next to 'em
And you've never seen
A goon so groomed
Fly as a balloon
Higher than the moon
Cartoon ass nigga
Step aside make room
Care to hear the realist shit
I ever wrote stay tuned
Fresh out of prison curfew lifted
Hit the roads like puuiinnn
See these niggas ain't changed
Still sweet as perfume
Flows hot like June
But I'm cool as Janurary though
Foxx who the King?, yeah shawty
(Dey already know)
I hit ya town like
"What it do, what it is homes?"
Direct me to something
I can spend a couple mil on
Still on point
No drink, no joint
Nigga lying say I'm
Working with the pigs oink, oink
Play the game how it go
Never told on nobody
Nigga wanna think I did
Cuz you fin' to prolly
And my nigga KT
Thug Cap and Shotty
Who the machine gun man
Fully automatic shawty?

[Soulja Boy]
Yep that's me, yep (ay)
