Star maker
First, unwrap my body like I'm your birthday gift
And like a birthday wish, tell me what you need and I got you girl
Let me perform for you, (for you) get it warm for you (make it hot)
And your always welcome to another round of me and you

Let your inhibitions go, go, (let it go)
I'm gonna make your makeup run, run, (let it run)
I'm gonna sweat your body out, make your body yell, you might think of backin' down
And as the mattress springs squeak- squeak, (holla baby) oooh I can feel your heart beat-beat (beat)
Going to make this night feel like weeks when your wrapped up in my sheets
Baby open up wide for me

And put your touch with my kiss, your skin with my sweat
A slow jam with my stroke, get this love inside of your heart and rejoice
Let your love re-, ooh let your body re-joice
Ooh let your body rejoice

When your ready for round two, let these lips of mine annoint you
How could i ever dissappoint you, oh look at you, oh look at you
Leave your footprints on the wall, take that pillow off your face
I got to see the passion in your face when i'm in your sacred place right before you explode

Let your inhibitions go, go (too dirty)
I'm gonna make your make up run, run , (get naughty baby)

Let the smell of my sweat and cologne, turn you on baby
And as the mattress springs squeak-sqeak, the way i feel your heart beat- beat
Gonna make these nights feel like weeks when I sex you in these sheets
Baby open up wide for me

Put your-your touch(your touch) with my kiss (my kiss), your skin( my lips) with my sweat (make it wet)
A slow jam (slow jam) with my stroke, put this love inside of your heart and rejoice
Let your love, re-, oooh let your body rejoice
Oh let your body, rejoice
Rejoice

Like we just reached the finish line (rejoice) to climax at the same time (rejoice)
Like you just jumped the broom (rejoice) like it's our honeymoon (rejoice)
You and I should rejoice (rejoice) like it's your birthday baby (rejoice)
Put your love (all your love) in my heart, (rejoice)baby

Put your touch with my kiss, your skin with my sweat
A slow jam with my stroke, put this love inside of your heart and rejoice
Let your love, re-, oooh let your body rejoice
Oh let your body rejoice

Repeat
