You are my favorite girl
I was your favorite guy
And somehow I thought that we'd always be down (down)
We went through crazy times
Inside this crazy mind
Somehow I thought that you would always be around
Somehow we changed up, we flamed up
And every day you're fighting with me
(baby, baby, baby)
And then it came up, I asked did you love me
Who knew that would be the last time we speak

[Chorus]
All I could say is why (why, why)
What did I do? What did I say? I didn't see this coming
All I can say is
Why why, why why why why why why why why
For the last two months I was
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye

[Verse]
Behind your lovely eyes
Couldn't see those lovely thighs
That couldn't break her in over a course of time
You could unbreak this glass heart
By just saying we're not apart
By how can I go on knowing my love is blind?
So many makes ups, So many break ups
I never thought I'd see u leave, (you leave, you leave)
I'ma put it to rest; because all I want is the best for you
You still haven't told me how I hurt so I deserve the answer to

[Chorus]
Why (why, why)
What did I do? What did I say? I didn't see this coming
All I can say is
Why why, why why why why why why
For the last two months I was
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye

[Verse]
All baby how, can you leave me like this
Through all the smiles, and all the cries
The love we had I thought was divide
No why, could u do me like this
I guess love question lesson would have learned to say
There are no real answers to

[Chorus]
Why (why, why) ohhhhhhhhhh
What did I do? What did I say? I didn't see this coming
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
Why why, ahhh baby why
For the last two months I was
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Baby whyyy, shawty why
You are my favorite girl
I was your favorite guy
And somehow I thought that we'd always be down (down)
