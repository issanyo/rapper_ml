They call me The Past, my son is Future
I taught the boy everything
Check me out

I got Verizon, I got Verizon
See me on the street
You walk up to me with AT&T, we fight!
You need a provider, cause when you start dialing
You runnin' outside, you stand in the street and scream
Like, "I got Verizon!"

You got to have Verizon
You get Verizon, your whole world is connected
That's what I'm sayin'
It ain't about, "can you hear me now?"
It's about, "can you see me now?"
