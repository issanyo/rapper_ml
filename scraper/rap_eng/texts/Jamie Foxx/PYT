[Verse 1]
I can make you feel it if you ain't ready
Cause with love, ain't somethin' that you get to choose
But when it hits you, oh you know you can't help it
It's something like the situation with you

[Hook]
I want to love you (PYT)
Pretty young thing
Your heart's been everywhere (PYT)
But I'll take you there
I want to love you (PYT)
Pretty young thing
Your heart's been everywhere (PYT)
But I'll take you there

[Bridge]
Baby I, girl I got a Jones for you
I can't lie
Baby I, feel it in my bones for you
I just can't get right

[Verse 2]
I know the questions on your mind been kind of heavy
But if you ask me, girl, I swear to tell the truth
Your friends say I'll hurt you cause they're jealous
They hate to see you doing better than they do

[Hook]
I want to love you (PYT)
Pretty young thing
Your heart's been everywhere (PYT)
But I'll take you there
I want to love you (PYT)
Pretty young thing
Your heart's been everywhere (PYT)
But I'll take you there

[Bridge]
Baby I, girl I got a Jones for you
I can't lie
Baby I, feel it in my bones for you
I just can't get right
Baby I, girl I got a Jones for you
I can't lie
Baby I, feel it in my bones for you
I just can't get right
