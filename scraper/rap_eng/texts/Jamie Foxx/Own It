[Intro: Adina Howard]
T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and my panties on
(I've been waiting for you)
T-shirt and my panties
Got my T-shirt and my panties on

[Verse 1]
I put the na-na in naughty
Begging for it, got you on your knees
Didn’t make it to the bedroom, we can do it there too
Whatever's your fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ready and waiting
’Cause who could love like me? Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Know when your body talk about how your body need my body
Won't be no games when you get home

[Chorus]
I know you're on your way
To get caught up in the way
We turnin' night into mornin'
I keep you up, keep it goin'
Make you feel a way
Yeah, I'm gon' have my way
So tell me I get it, I own it
(Own it, own it, own it)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I’ma let you play with this
Play that shit, stay in it, uh, uh
Just tell me you want it
And I know you love the taste of it
Take a whole damn plate of it
Baby, save that shit
(Own it, own it, own it)

[Verse 2]
You make me feel the burnin’ desires (Ooh, ho-hoo)
'Cause you ignite the fire in me
You always give into temptation, need it on the daily
I can be the fix you crave
Say my name

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m ready and waiting
'Cause who could love like me? Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Know when your body talk about how your body need my body
Won't be no games when you get home

[Chorus]
I know you're on your way
To get caught up in the way
We turnin’ night into mornin'
I keep you up, keep it goin'
Make you feel a way
Yeah, I'm gon' have my way
So tell me I get it, I own it
(Own it, own it, own it)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma let you play with this
Play that shit, stay in it, uh, uh
Just tell me you want it
And I know you love the taste of it
Take a whole damn plate of it
Baby, save that shit
(Own it, own it, own it)

[Bridge]
You won't ever tell me no, no, no, no, no
You're addicted, yeah, I know (I know)
Don't tap out, just go, go, go, go, go
I know you got more, more, more

[Chorus]
I know you're on your way
To get caught up in the way
We turnin' night into mornin' (Mornin')
I keep you up, keep it goin' (Goin')
Make you feel a way (Ooh)
Yeah, I'm gon' have my way
So tell me I get it, I own it
(Own it, own it, own it)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah (I own it)

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma let you play with this (Hey)
Play that shit, stay in it, uh, uh
Just tell me you want it (Want it)
And I know you love the taste of it (I know)
Take a whole damn plate of it
Baby, save that shit
(Own it, own it, own it)
Oh

To be honest I thought you knew. Maybe I lied. Maybe I wanna come through. Who am I? Oh, you'll find out soon. Maybe zones don't apply. Maybe "friends" is old news
