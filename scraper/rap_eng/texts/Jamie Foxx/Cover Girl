Yeah, yeah
It's the easy, queasy, beautiful, beautiful
Yeah, y'all know me
It's the queen bee, queasy, breezy, beautiful

Cover girl, a cover girl
I want a cover girl, a cover girl
One that goes and gets it, she won't wait for it
She can't fake, but she gets paid for it

Cover girl, a cover girl
I want a cover girl, a cover girl
One that goes and gets it, she won't wait for it
She can't fake, but she gets paid for it

Don't want an everyday girl
In my fantasy world
Gonna win, I won't lose
She gettin' money like ooh

She got cool like that
She got the rules like that
If she sees it and it fits
It ain't nothin' for her to get

This goes out to all my girls
Who got their own cash, uh-huh
'Cause you may need it for fun

This goes out to all my girls
Who buy everything that they own
I need you to be mine

Cover girl, a cover girl
I want a cover girl, a cover girl
One that goes and gets it, she won't wait for it
She can't fake, but she gets paid for it

Cover girl, a cover girl
I want a cover girl, a cover girl
One that goes and gets it, she won't wait for it
She can't fake, but she gets paid for it

My girl has got to be the boss
It's nothing for shorty to pay the cost
Game's so sick
Got it done, win a hit

She just works so hard
Cookin' with a black credit card
Baby girl's flying first class
Got the body, fat lips, fat ass

This goes out to all my girls
Who got their own cash, uh-huh
'Cause you may need it for fun

This goes out to all my girls
Who buy everything that they own
I need you to be mine

Cover girl, a cover girl
I want a cover girl, a cover girl
One that goes and gets it, she won't wait for it
She can't fake, but she gets paid for it

Cover girl, a cover girl
I want a cover girl, a cover girl
One that goes and gets it, she won't wait for it
She can't fake, but she gets paid for it

In the pretty face, you can't replace her
She gets her own on her own like a captain
That's the type of girl that I want by my side
That's the type of girl that I want in my life

In the pretty face, you can't replace her
She gets her own on her own like a captain
That's the type of girl that I want by my side
That's the type of girl that I want in my life

This is the face of this sexy gangsta rap
And right after that, I was the face for MAC
Cover Girl cut the check, I'll be the face for that
I'm the first lady, just face the fact

Queen bee, baby, your front page lady
All them other, put them back on page 80
Ask Jamie, your girl get unpredictable
Not your typical, Kim's so irresistible

Strut down 5th Ave like I'm on the runway
I collect more checks than an usher on Sunday
Honey girl take you to a whole 'nother world
Easy, greasy, beautiful, beautiful

Cover girl, a cover girl
I want a cover girl, a cover girl
One that goes and gets it, she won't wait for it
She can't fake, but she gets paid for it

Cover girl, a cover girl
I want a cover girl, a cover girl
One that goes and gets it, she won't wait for it
She can't fake, but she gets paid for it
