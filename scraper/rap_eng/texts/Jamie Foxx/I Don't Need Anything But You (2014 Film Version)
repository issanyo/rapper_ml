Together at last!
Together for ever!
We're tying a knot,
They never can sever!

I don't need sunshine now,
To turn my skies at blue

I don't need anything but you!

You've wrapped me around
That cute little finger.
You've made life a song
You've made me the singer!

And what's the bathtub tune
You always "Bu-Bu-Boo?"

Bu-Bu-Bu
Anything but you

Yesterday was plain awful

You can say that again

Yesterday was plain awful

But that's

Not now

That's then

I'm poor as a mouse,

I'm richer than Midas.

But nothing on earth
Could ever divide us!
And if tomorrow, I
'm an apple seller, too
I don't need anything but you!

Annie Annie Annie
Everything's humming now
Annie Annie
Good times are coming now
Since you came our way
It's Christmas,
Christmas everyday
We dismiss
Bad times, sad times
Now they're all yesterday news
Since Annie
Kicked out
The blues

Annie Annie Annie
Look what you've done for us
Annie Annie Annie
Turned on the sun for us

Have they sent the cheese?

Yes and ice camemberts and bries

Annie Annie
You filled our life with a song

They're two of a kind
The happiest pair now
Like Fred and Adelle, they're floating
On air now
And what's the title of the dream

I don't need anything

Anything

Anything
I don't need anything
But you
