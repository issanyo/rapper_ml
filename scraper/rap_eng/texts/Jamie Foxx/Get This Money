[Verse 1]
Shorty trust me when I say
You're looking John Blaze
In your lingerie
And shorty, I like the way you play
And move about on stage
I won't be mad at you
For swingin' it my way

[Hook]
I've got my money on you
Big faces spankin' brand new
While I'm here, this is what you need to do
Come and get this money
If you don't want everyone to see
Just how naughty you can really be
We can ease off to the V.I.P
Come and get this money

[Verse 2]
Not too many, wear it quite as well
You take care of yourself
It ain't hard to tell
And not too many can go into a split
From standing to a sit
I ain't mad at you, not one bit

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
I got more than 5 on it
(Dance for me, dance for me)
I see you got your eyes on it
(Dance for me, dance for me)
So act like you know
Are you trying to get this dough, or what?

[Hook x2]
