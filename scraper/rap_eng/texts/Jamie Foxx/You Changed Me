[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
Don't talk to me, I think
Don't talk to me, I'm serious, baby
Oh, oh, you don't even know
Oh baby, think it over, now it's starting to show

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Chris Brown]
Oh baby, ain't no sense in fronting when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind, it's me and you, baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down, right now
'Cause you changed me, baby
'Cause you changed me, baby
'Cause you changed me, baby
'Cause you changed me, baby
Yeah, you changed me, baby

[Post-Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Chris Brown]
Said I'd never settled down
I'm with you, girl, look at me now
'Cause you changed me, baby
I be player for life, you switched that up in one night, oh baby
Ain't no sense in fronting when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind, it's me and you (baby, I love you)
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down, right now

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
You put it on me, baby, not just the physical
You mentally stimulate me, I'm really in love, that's crazy
Girl, you can't even save me
You got me thinking 'bout us having us some babies, everything about love got me like
Baby, come home and put it on me tonight
I want it right now, girl, I can't even lie
Fuck them other girls, they ain't you
You're the only one I need and that's the truth

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Oh baby, ain't no sense in fronting when you know I got a thing for you (ooh)
Ain't no other girls in mind, it's me and you, baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down, right now
'Cause you changed me, baby
Been searching for the answers, babe, 'cause you changed me, baby
Never met a girl that made my life this good as you, 'cause you changed me, baby
Oh, don't want just someone in, you wanna have my kids, you wanna see me winning
Girl, it ain't just me, tell 'em how you feel, Breezy

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You know what I'm missing, fiending for your kisses
All night on my phone, when you talk, I listen
Sexing all in the kitchen, breaking all of these dishes
Your crib or my bed, it don't make a difference
I'm licking on your body, girl, I'm feeling on your booty, now you really wanna do the nasty
Girl, I love it when you get on your knees, you make me disappear like magic
Girl, you don't even know
All the bitches I let go, haha, for you

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Chris Brown]
Ain't no sense in fronting when you know I got a thing for you, baby
Ain't no other girls in mind, it's me and you, baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down, oh, babe, right now
'Cause you changed me, baby
All the things I used to be, I ain't no more, 'cause you changed me, baby (who we were, who we were)
Shawty, you're the changing I've been hoping for, 'cause you changed me, baby (ooh)
Aw yeah, you changed me, baby

[Post-Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Chris Brown]
Said I'd never settled down (oh)
I'm with you, girl, look at me now 'cause you changed me, baby (look at me now, somebody)
I be your player for life, you switched that up in one night, oh baby (yeah)
Ain't no sense in fronting when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind, it's me and you, baby, I love you (ha)
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down (never, ever wanna settle down 'til the day that you came around)
'Cause you changed me, baby

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
Huh, you know I've been all over the world, man
I had really gave up on this shit, you know
Finally met a girl that do for me though
It's crazy, it's like a dream, I think I got me one
