(Intro)
Repeat after me
Baby forgive me for my trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
For all we say and lead me not into temptation
But deliver us from
The doghouse

(Verse 1)
Like a fool I played this game of love
Not to win it I'm just in its
You see my girl was out of town for about a week
That’s what I thought
Well I was wrong
Well temptation came knocking at my door
I accepted I regret it
Cause I knew it was the end I must pay for all my sins
How can it be can't believe that my girl walked in on me
Cause I was cold

(Chorus)
Baby I know (Baby I'm sorry)
That I’m all exposed (Yes I am)
She caught me with my shorts down
Now I can't get back
All of the good love
All the good lovin' I had
Taught me not to fool around

No matter what I do
You're always untrue
Why do you fool around?

(Verse 2)
It was cool oh so smooth I got so rude in the back of my room
Sheets nice and soft, will that get you off?
Well I knew that it was wrong but like a fool I carried on
Gave into sin
Then my girlie girl walked in
And i was cold

(Chorus)
Baby I know
That I'm all exposed (I'm all exposed)
Caught me with my shorts down (Girl what shall I do)
Now I can't get back
All the good lovin' I had

Taught me not to fool around
I can’t deny
(I can’t deny)
Thou shall not lie
(Thou shall not lie)
Caught me with my shorts down
What can I do?
(What can i do)
To make it up to you?
(To make it up to you?)
Taught me not to fool around

(Rap: The Poetess)
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
I ain't the one to be played so don’t be runnin' the games
It was silly of me to think that you would never cheat
I wasn't gone a week you couldn't wait to hit the sheets
Caught you with your shorts down you and I were later
You didn’t have to lie, hoe, you should have been straight up
I can take it cause I'm that woman
And now your all assed out cause you ain't got jack comin'
I must admit you had me fooled for a minute though
You had me it open it wasn't cool that was critical
Now get to steppin' with your flowers and your candy
It's over just in case you didn't understand me
Now here's the keys to your new crib (Doghouse)
Now think about the things that you did (Doghouse)
You're livin' foul and you're goin' out doggie style
That's why you're livin' in the doghouse now

(Verse 3)
Well I know the deeds one day will catch up with me
Whenever that day comes I'll have to deal with it
Well I know it might sound strange but I'll never change
Well girl I'm just the dog that likes to chase the cat

After all the things that I have done for you
I'm disgusted, it's you I trusted
Soon you'll realize that I was good for you
You'll regret it, so don't forget it

(Hook)
There's no doubt
(There's no doubt)
That I'm all assed out
(Can't you see that)
You caught me with my shorts down
What am I gonna do?
Come big or small
(Come big or small)
I gotta lock them drawers
(I gotta lock them drawers)
Teach me not to fool around
Go on baby you need to understand me

What can I do?
I'm all exposed?
I didn't think, I didn't think you'd find me out
I can't get back that sweet, sweet love
That sweet, sweet love
Come on baby
I guess I have to pay for all my sins today
After all
