(Intro: T.I.)
Say Foxx? (Yeah... eah... eah...)
I had-I had a chick man-
(Yeah... eah... eah...)
She went and did me real
Wrong, I mean (Yeah... eah... eah...)
I did the same thing to her but-
She ain´t have no right to do
Me like that though dawg, for
Real (Yeah... eah... eah...)

(Verse 1: Jamie Foxx)
You, been seeing him, and I know
And I was with her, and you knew about it
But I was too bli-I-ind to see it baby
And you was out here doing
The same thing as me
I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
Has he been in our, car?
And did you let him, drive?
Cause she's been by the house
She's been in the car
I´ve even let her push the
Porsche around a couple times
Ohh, we were so the same
I don´t know why I can´t see it baby
And it ain´t a point to feeling blue
You´re just like me and I´m just like you

(Chorus: Jamie Foxx)
You´re just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bud
Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me
She don´t know how to act
On the floor back in the back
Man I can´t be mad dapslyrics
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me...

(Verse 2: Jamie Foxx)
Now it ain´t so easy for me
To be imagining what you been doing baby
So I don´t even have to ask (No)
Cause you ain´t the only one
That keeping secrets baby
So really, no sense in me playing "bye"
And I, can´t stay up though
Cause I did you wrong
And I was on some kush
When I let that *** up in our home
She's out from us just like me
And she played the game
Like one of my homies
Ohh, we were so the same
I don´t know why I can see you baby
And it ain´t a point to feeling blue
You´re just like me and I´m just like you

(Chorus: Jamie Foxx)
You´re just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bud
Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me
She don´t know how to act
On the floor back in the back
Man I can´t be mad
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
(Getting money, having fun, man she)
Just like me-e-ee-e-e (In the club
Throwing ones, man she)
Just like me-e-ee-e-e (24's on the Range)
Just like me... (Go on shawty do your thang)

(Bridge: T.I.) Hey!
Shawty who you fooling?
You know I´m way too cool for you
To run that game when we play me
Trying to do me like I be doing you
Say you heard I was screwing her
Just like I hear he doing you
Why you worry about me doing me
I see you doing you
I can make her better though
You gon let him ruin you
Just for the record
Know, I wouldn't have her
Unless I could have the two of you
I know why he pursuing you
That booty do be moving boo
Late night, straight pipe
That ain´t nothing new to you
Wait a minute
Can´t tell me

Wanna tell me
Something tell me this
If I woulda never woulda hit that chick
Would you even ever know that dude existed? Naw
Got me twisted
Yo ass goodbye I´ve kissed it
Now you all on his ***
Shawty look at this ***

(Chorus: Jamie Foxx)
Just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bud
Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me (You know
I was wrong shawty)
She don´t know how to act
On the floor back in the back
Man I can´t be mad
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
(You dealing with a man with
An ego, you know?)
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me...
