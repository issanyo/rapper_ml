Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, baby you are
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, beautiful
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, you make me wanna, gorgeous
Spend this money gorgeous, all on you

[Verse 1]
Shorty you make the world go round
When I get you, girl, I'ma hold you down
Can't no other man do you like I do
Nothing on this earth compares to me loving you
Gucci bags, Louie bags
If you want it girl then that's what you have
No amount of money in this world is too much
Thanking cupid for introducing the two of us
This must a match made in heaven
Feels like dice when I roll a seven
Girl, I'm so so lucky I found you, found you, found you
God's missing an angel cause you're right here
Beautiful skin and body and some nice hair
Girl don't you ever walk out my life, life

[Hook 1x 2]
Girl you are gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, baby you are Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, beautiful
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, you make me wanna, gorgeous
Spend this money gorgeous, all on you

[Verse 2]
If I had the world in my hands
I would give it all up just to be your man
In the summertime, we'll build the castle in the sand
And the winter time we make us a snowman
Baby let's do something romantic
Make love under the moonlight and planets
And the stars how they shine, but not nearly as bright as you and I
God's missing an angel cause you're right here
Beautiful skin and body and some nice hair
Girl don't you ever walk out of my life, my life

[Hook]
Girl you are gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, baby you are Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, beautiful
