[Spoken Jamie:]
Yo you sleep
Naw I just um, I think I want some more
Yea I know we just got through
But its just so good, I just caint help it thoâ€™
Its something about your body
Naw it ain't all I think about
Well to be honest, oh

[Verse:]
Im startin' to believe
Something's wrong wit me
Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute
I'm thinkin' 'bout it
I can be at my job, in my car, up in church
And when I try to pray it off, it won't work
It seems that I caint get enough of

[Chorus:]
(Sex) All the time
(Sex) On my mind
(Sex) Everywhere I go
(Sex) I'm tryna let you know
(Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love
S-E-X ohhheee
(Sex) Can make you crazy
(Sex) Can make a baby
(Sex) All night long
(Sex) It's the perfect song
(Sex) Stronger than any drug even love
S-E-X oh

[Verse:]
Its getting to the point where I (where I)
I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs
Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)
I ain't proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me
And I caint help it, caint shack it
(You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me

[Chorus 1X]

[Hook:]
Some call it bad, some call it good
Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood
I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh

Some like it slow, some like it fast
It don't mater the tempo long as it lasts
I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh

[Chorus until end]
