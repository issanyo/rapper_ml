INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT

INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
Moguy signs as a witness. Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her freedom papers.

Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.

All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration. For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred dollars- for twelve thousand.

Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else. The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz around pouring coffee for the white people. Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of rhubarb pie with him.

CALVIN CANDIE (TO SCHULTZ): Rhubarb pie? Schultz looks at the pie and the man.

DR.SCHULTZ: No.

CALVIN CANDIE: Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya?

DR. SCHULTZ: Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan. And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.

Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he examines he papers.

CALVIN CANDIE: Dumas...?

Dr.SCHULZ: Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers.” I figured you must be an admirer. You named your slave after that novel's lead character. If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I wonder what he would of made of it?

CALVIN CANDIE: You doubt he'd approve?

DR.SCHULTZ: Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best.

CALVIN CANDIE: Soft hearted Frenchy?

DR.SCHULTZ: Alexander Dumas is black.

Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, looks to his two companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says:

DR.SCHULTZ: We got it, let's go. (TO CANDIE) Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say, auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is “till I see you again”, and since I never wish to see you again, to you sir, I say: goodbye.

Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit. When Calvin says to the German's back:

CALVIN CANDIE: One more moment, Doc!

Dr.SCHULTZ: What?

CALVIN CANDIE: It's a custom here in the South, once a business deal is concluded, for the two parties to shake hands. It implies good faith.

Dr.SCHULTZ: I'm not from the South.

He turns to leave.

CALVIN CANDIE: You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid I must insist.

This turns Schultz around.

DR.SCHULTZ: Insist what...? That I shake your hand before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.

Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

CALVIN CANDIE: You know what I think you are?

DR.SCHULTZ: What you think I am? No I don't.

CALVIN CANDLE: I think you are a bad loser.

DR.SCHULTZ: And I think you're an abysmal winner.

CALVIN CANDLE: Never the less, here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done till the two parties have shook hands. Even after all this paper signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.

DR.SCHULTZ: If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars...? I don't think so.

Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.

Dr.SCHULTZ: Let's go.

CALVIN CANDIE: Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here before this German shakes my hand. Cut 'er down.

Schultz looks to Django...
then to Candle...
and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks:

Dr.SCHULTZ: You really want me to shake your hand?

Django gets it.

CALVIN CANDIE: I insist.

Dr. Schultz smiles.

Dr.SCHULTZ: Well, if you insist.

Django goes to stop him...
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand....
Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

POP!

He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.

Candie has a look of SHOCK as blood explodes from his heart, and he falls to the floor. Everybody is stunned.Schultz looks to Django. Django looks back.

DR.SCHULTZ (TO DJANGO): I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

Dr. Schultz is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.

The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

FADE TO BLACK
