(Jamie Talking:)
I know you see me lookin' at you
And I know he know you lookin' at me
Well....damn

D.J. won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this love song
She's lookin' at me kinda hard, I can tell that things ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to Beat a beat, beat it, beat it

I can see how you want it baby
Wish your man was here with you baby
I can see curiosity
Gotcha wanna try me
Homeboy can't please
On this wall in the open baby
You wouldn't care if the crowd was watchin' baby
You want it
I know it
Gotta notion to pull your ass up out of here

DJ won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this love song
She's lookin' at me kinda hard, I can tell that things ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to Beat a beat, beat it, beat it. (x2)

Baby, I got things that I wanna say
Won't you meet me in the bathroom?
We can pull a freaky episode, I got my Beretta if the nigga come through
Baby, I know he ain't treatin' you right Baby, look at your bad ass

Twista
Tell me why he did you wrong
Need to get up with the Twista I been sippin' on Patron
Stroke it when I hold them legs up
He can take you out to dinner and look like a playa
I'm a give it to you good up in the elevator
He be actin' all soft when he get in them draws
I'm a break you off and fuck you up against the wall
Finna move up in that slot cause I'm somethin' he not
And he don't know what he got, I'm in the drop top
To get the twat, I got a knot, no more runnin' from the cops
Now I'm rollin' with Foxx because the block's hot
But I'm always a G, cuz I come from the streets and I got heat for whoever thinkin' they want some
No more fuckin' with them lames, now you rollin' with a thug, so tell that nigga to...
(Jamie:) Beat it, beat it
