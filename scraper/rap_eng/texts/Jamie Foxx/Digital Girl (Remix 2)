[The Dream]
I wanna see what's under there baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[The Dream]
Baby, not a day goes by, whoa
Without you on my mind, whoa
Donna Karan underwear
Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about
Baby, I wanna see what's under there
It's easy, look lemme explain
Oh baby, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach third base
And when I get home I'ma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date
Ye, the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty-three year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress White, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby you up, question mark
And she respond, YES-S-S-I-R

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, uh no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no
