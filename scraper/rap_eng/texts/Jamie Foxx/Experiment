I feel like I want to love you
In a different way
Oh, baby, baby...

Imagine if you will...experiment (science!)
Experiment, experiment

Baby, we're all alone
Nobody around to know
Think of all the things that we can do
Or maybe we could try on something new
'cause girl, we don't need permission
To try out a new position
Just to plant the seed
Of ecstacy
Is all we need
And we can both be free

To do the things we've never done before
Baby, close your eyes and let's explore
Baby, let's experiment...(experiment)
We don't have to do the same old thing
Open up your mind and we can twang
Baby, let's experiment...
Come on, come on, come on

Don't be afraid, baby
Girl, you won't be misled
What don't you see you can, could
'cause girl it's like duh
You can take it to the head, baby
My eyes have seen the glory of your precious love
Have you ever wondered how it'd feel

To do the things we've never done before
Baby, close your eyes and let's explore
Baby, let's experiment...(experiment)
We don't have to do the same old thing
Girl, to tell the truth, it's quite mundane
Baby, let's experiment...
Then you will see just what I mean!

Hold me close, girl, 'cause I've been waiting too long
Me, myself, I like it better with the lights on
Let's get blazed through a drink or two
To get you in the mood
I think it's cool, yeah
You know exactly what I need, babe
Sugar, didn't think you'd do this
Girl it's so good
I wish that you would
Experiment with me, baby
Experiment with my love
Come on, come on, baby
Oh, baby, won't you please experiment with me tonight
Experiment with my love tonight
