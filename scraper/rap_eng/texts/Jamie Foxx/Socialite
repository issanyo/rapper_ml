[Verse 1]
She something like a big deal
Tight, fit dress, five inch heels
That red on them sexy lips
She steal hard and hide the evidence

[Pre-Hook]
She a socialite, she into having fun
Perfect body type, she a one on one
She could talk that shit, she could back it up
She don't play no games, if you acting up

[Hook]
She keep that money in her purse, you know what she got it for
She get up and work, she paid her own college funds
City full of rich niggas, she ain't gotta count on none
I'm in love with your brain, where you get that body from?
I don't know how she get it but she got it
I don't know how she get it but she got it
I don't know how she get it but she got it
I don't know how she get it but she got it
I don't know how she get it but she got it
Got everything from the brain to the body
Girl do your thing, they don't get it what you got it
I don't know how she get it but she got it

[Verse 2]
Something like a superstar
Everywhere you go, they know who you are
She put on that Agent Provocateur
Now I understand what you bought it for

[Pre-Hook 2]
She look like my wife, everything I want
Perfect body type, she a one on one
She could talk that shit, she could back it up
She don't play no games, if you acting up

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It's you in the crowd, I'm watching you dance
I'm watching you dance, I love how you work it
If I'm allowed, let me use my hands
Let me use my hands, your energy's perfect
