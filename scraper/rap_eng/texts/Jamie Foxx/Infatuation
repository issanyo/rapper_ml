Oh oh my baby oh

(Verse1)
I have waited for so long to hear you say
I wanna spend my whole life with you (yes i do)
Well i dont mean to fuss dont mean to push
I know your all alone
But theres just one thing i have to know

(Chorus)
Is it just infatuation?
Or is it real love? (real love?)
Is it just infatuation?
Well why dont you take me girl
And drive me in your life?

(Verse2)
I can't explain it
What you do to me
I get so excited when you call my name
Im not ashamed (ah ah)
Ashamed to let the whole world see
Oh girl just what you do to me
Well im like a child thats lost his way
So won't you help me?

(Chorus x2)
Is it just infatuation?
Or is it real love?(real love?)
Is it just infatuation?
(i need to know right now my darlin please)
Why dont you take me girl
And drown me in your love?
Come on baby i need to know right now
Tell what you think of about me baby?
Tell me what you think about me girl?
Oh oh oh i need to know right now
Come on come on my baby
