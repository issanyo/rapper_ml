Oooh oooooh ooohohohhhooo (oh oh oh oh)
Oooh oooooh ooohohohhhooo (oh oh oh oh)

There's so much shit I wanna do, to you (you you you you)
First you gotta step into this room (room room room)
Look into my eyes
Imma look right into yours
Cut the lights off
But don't you close the door
Tonight I'm gonna make my hallways back or you

I pull my shirt off
Pull your jeans down
Oh baby take your time
Now turn around
As our bodies catch the mirror
Let me grind into the song
Imma do you all night long

And now we go slow, slow, slow (you you you)
And now we go slow, slow, slow
Those other guys don't get it like I get it
Cause I'm with it, I get it
And they just wanna hit it
But I hear you, I pay attention
Not finished till you're finished

You're gonna get yours, imma get mine (imma get mine, imma get mine)
And imma take my time (time)
And wine my baby slow

Show me you like that slow
Sh-sh-sh-show me you like that slow
Sh-sh-sh-show me you like that slow, slow, slow, slow slow
Show me you like that slow
Sh-sh-sh-show me you like that slow
Sh-sh-sh-show me you like that slow, slow slow slow slow

Baby imma do you till you lose your mind
Baby you're so oeh oeh oeh oeh oeh so freakin' fine
Ehey, imma do your body like a rollercoaster
So hold on tight lay on my shoulder
And slowly but surely imma break that body like a cake
You're gonna sweat these sheets out
Imma mess your hair up
And imma wild out on ya like I don't give a fuck
Until it's three o'clock, four o'clock, five o'clock six
And I gotta take my time with you
Cause your shit is the shit

And now we go slow, slow, slow (you you you)
And now we go slow, slow, slow
Those other guys don't get it like I get it
Cause I'm with it, I get it
And they just wanna hit it
But I hear you, I pay attention
Not finished till you're finished

Youre gonna get yours, imma get mine (imma get mine, imma get mine)
And imma take my time (time)
And wine my baby slow

Show me you like that slow
Sh-sh-sh-show me you like that slow
Sh-sh-sh-show me you like that slow, slow slow slow slow
Show me you like that slow
Sh-sh-sh-show me you like that slow
Sh-sh-sh-show me you like that slow, slow slow slow slow

Oh
That's it here we go
Put my love in the air
If the curtains are open I don't care, let 'em stare
Out the room, on the wall, every step on the staircase
Baby let me make your day
