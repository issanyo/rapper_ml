I might be black but I ain't no widow
I've just been shadows in the dark
He may be yours, but he ain't my hero
I embrace this malice in my heart
I've been patiently waiting, but I'm angry now
You promised the lightning in the sky
I was told they would worship me, yell and scream my name
But they turned their backs on me and lied
So now I'm chasing spiders
