Wasn't really thinking, wasn't looking, wasn't searching for an answer
In the moonlight
When I saw your face
Saw you looking at me, saw you peaking out from under moon beams
Through the palm trees
Swaying in the breeze
I know I'm feeling so much more than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do
Don't know how it happened, don't know why, but you don't really need a reason
When the stars shine
Just to fall in love

Made to love each other, made to be together for a life time
In the sunshine
Flying in the sky
I know I'm feeling so much more than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do
Now I know love is real
So when sky high, as the angels dry
Letting you and I, fly love
