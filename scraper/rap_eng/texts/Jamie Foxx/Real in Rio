All the birds of a feather
Do what they love most of all
We are the best at rhythm and laughter
That's why we love carnival

Possibly we can sing too
Sun and beaches, they coo
Dance to the music, passion and love
Show us the best you can do

Everyone here is on fire
Get up and join in the fun
Dance with a stranger, romance and danger
Magic could happen for real in Rio

All by itself, you can't see it coming
You can't find it anywhere else
It's real in Rio, know something else
You can feel it happen, you can feel it all by yourself

All the birds of a feather
Do what they love most of all
Moon and the stars, sun and guitars
That's why we love carnival

Loving our life in the jungle
Everything's wild and free
Never alone 'cause this is our home
Magic can happen for real in Rio

All by itself, you can't see it coming
You can't find it anywhere else

I'm the Capoeira kinga, kinga, kinga, kinga, kinga
Birds like me 'cause I'm a hot winga
There's your hot winga

Here everybody loves samba, I like the samba
Rhythm you feel in your heart, I'm the samba master
Beauty and love, what more could you want?
Everything can be for real in Rio

Here's something else
You just feel it happening
You won't find it anywhere else
