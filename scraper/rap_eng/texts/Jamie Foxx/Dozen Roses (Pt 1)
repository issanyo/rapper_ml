[Intro]
Hey, mm

[Verse]
When you coming over?
I hope you on your way (what you wanna talk about?)
I bought a dozen roses, yeah
Been waiting here all day (yeah, you fucked up)
I really wanna see you (you know how it feels)
Tell me that you're near (I don't think you know)
I wanna pull you closer, yeah
And whisper in your ear (I gave you my heart)
I bought a dozen roses
I bought a dozen roses, yeah (why'd you have to do me like that?)
I bought a dozen roses (you can't do me like that, you just can't do me like that)
I bought a dozen roses
I bought a dozen roses (no I don't think you do understand)
