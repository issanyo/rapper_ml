[Intro]
Steppin' to the bad side
Gonna take a mean ride
The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Both: Stepping to the bad side today

[Hook]
Steppin' to the bad side, ooh, ooh, ooh
Gonna take a mean ride, ooh, ooh, ooh

The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Steppin' to the bad side today

[Verse 1]
I tell ya now, it's got to end
No more trusting them, my friend
We're gonna change our style, change our tone
Look for songs we sing our own

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got you all the breaks you need
In just two years, we'll be in the lead
Just sit back, it's plain to see
Open your eyes and trust in me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I was a man who tried to be good
I was always misunderstood
Halfway there, they told me
You got to get down and show your dangerous ?

[Hook]

[Dreamettes](x2)
Steppin' to the bad side, steppin' to the bad side

[Interlude]
Singing their big new hit, here's James Thunder Early and the Dreamettes, singing their #1 hit, "Stepping to the Bad Side"

[Bridge x4: Dreamettes]
Stepping to the bad side, stepping to the bad side

[James Thunder Early]
I had to step into the bad side
I had to take myself a mean ride
You know the smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay

[J.T. Early & Dreamettes]
Steppin to the bad side(Dreamettes: Today)

[James Thunder Early]
Man just stole my woman from me
Took her down to Tennessee
She was the best girl I ever knew
If it wasn't for him, she'd still be true
I've always been a good man, it's been said
Dammit, that man, I wish you were dead
Men like him make good men mad
Starting today I'm gonna be bad

[Hook]
