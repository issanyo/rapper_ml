[Intro: Effie (C.C. spoken)]
What about what I need?
(Curtis says it's the best thing for the group)
What about what's best for me?
(He feels the Dreams can cross over)
What about how I feel?
(But when we're famous, I'll write great things for ya. Effie, do it for me)
What about me? What about me?

[Verse 1: C. C.]
It's more than you. It is more than me
No matter what we are, we are a family
This dream is for all of us
This one can be real
And you can't stop us now
Because of how you feel

[Verse 2: C.C.]
It's more than you. It is more than me
Whatever dreams we have, they're for the family
We're not alone anymore, now there are others there
And that dream's big enough
For all of us to share

So don't think you're going
You're not going anywhere
You're staying and taking your share
And if you get afraid again, I'll be there

[Hook: C. C., Deena, Lorrell, & Curtis]
We are a family, like a giant tree
Branching out toward the sky
We are a family, we are so much more
Than just you and I
We are a family like a giant tree

[Bridge: C. C.]
Growing stronger, growing wiser

[Outro. C. C., Deena, Lorrell, & Curtis]
We are growing free
We need you
We are a family
