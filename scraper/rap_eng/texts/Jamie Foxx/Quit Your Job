Shawty, quit yo' job
He make you work too hard
Baby, quit yo' job
Qu-qu-quit yo' 9-5
Baby, you need to quit yo' job
Yo' man make you work too hard
Qu-qu-quit yo' job
Qu-qu-quit yo' 9-5
Oh shit
I never seen a girl like this, mhmm
She roll around, goin' up and down
Just to drop and scrub the ground
Oh shit
I just want a lil bit
Back it up on my jeans, put it all on me
There's no place I'd rather be
Than here with you
*****************
But girl, you stole my heart
The way you whip it in
Way you dip it in
I feel like a kid in the park
Can you do this in bed
Then get up and fix me some eggs
And if you can't call yo' man like a 9-5
Then tell him you quit
And you gon' be with me
We could watch some foreign films
Then romance
And if he still wanna pull yo' pants
Tell the nigga you quit
And you gon' be with me
Baby, you're my girl and you're my dream
And you're the finest thing I've ever seen
Oh baby, shit
I never had a girl like this
She fix me pancakes
She know how to bake
Got me lickin' out her plate
Oh shit
No girl never put it down like this
Call yo' man and tell him you sorry
You can drive any car
Except the Ferrarri
Oh baby, baby

Oh baby, shit
I wanna be the one that's by yo' side
I wanna be that nigga that says "Goodnight"
Oh, tell the nigga you quit
And you gon' be with me
We could watch some foreign films
Then romance
And if he still wanna pull yo' pants
Tell the nigga you quit
And you gon' be with me
Baby, you're my girl and you're my dream
