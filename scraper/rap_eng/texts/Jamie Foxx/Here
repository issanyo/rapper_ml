[Verse 1: Asaiah Ziv]
Lately I been wonderin' where the time went
Happiness is freedom, gotta buy that
Lately I been losin' hella friends
But I know you stayin' with me to the end, I could tell
Hard to write these verses with these thoughts on my mind
I'm sorry I'm not perfect, I'll get better with time
Don't need to keep on searchin' when I know that you mine
You remind me of the sun, the way I'm watchin' you shine
Hit the crib, play a little Sade
Tell me all your views and how your mind play
Breathin' all these swishers got my mind swayed
And you been on my brain, probably all day, all day
Brighten up the skies when the clouds gray
I been tryna find my self, came a long way
I been tryna free my soul, hard to stay awake
They said we couldn't find love at a young age
All I know is...

[Hook: SPZRKT]
I can feel your heart and it's warm as the summer
Remember I was cold as the tundra
I don't wanna live life without you
So tell me are you gonna be here with me?
Friends will come and go, but there's one thing that I know
I need you here with me
Even if I'm down I'll make it if you're around for me

[Verse 2: Asaiah Ziv]
Keep your secrets secret
She told me she was down for the ride
Keep your eye open and your soul free
I'm just tryna pick your mind, we should spend more time
Slow jams on the late night
We can roll if you down
I can show you 'round here, cause I be around here
They know me around here, that's on the real
She live in LA
Got a show in the Bay so she came for the day
She drove all the way
Play all my songs everyday, that's her fave
I swear that she keep me afloat
She keep me in line all the time like a coach
I'm keepin' her close
She told me a house ain't a home

[Hook: SPZRKT]
I can feel your heart and it's warm as the summer
Remember I was cold as the tundra
I don't wanna live life without you
So tell me are you gonna be here with me?
Friends will come and go, but there's one thing that I know
I need you here with me
Even if I'm down I'll make it if you're around for me

[Outro]
Some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita would definitely set this party off right
She said she wants some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton would definitely start this party off right
