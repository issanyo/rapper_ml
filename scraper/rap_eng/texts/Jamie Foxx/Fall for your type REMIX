Tell me why I always fall for your type

CrookTheKidd
I see you walking girl please tell me what your name is
I heard about your past, but trusting rumors can be dangerous
Girl dont play if you love me than just let me know
Lets go to school pen and paper girl check yes or no, yeah uhh
Or maybe if you prefer we can talk about your life and how you dream to see the world
I take you there if you agree to let me in your heart
Ill love you down forever girl will never fall apart
Dont worry bout your man girl he ain't gotta know
But soon your gunna have to tell that man that he has gotta go
Loving you is hard work but girl im ready
Cause being single fun but im just trynna hold it steady
Thats why ima take a chance with these feelings now, falling for your type
I feel alota times before, this time I hope its right
Dont let me down love me down hold me tight dont let go
Sex is cool love is great but for now lets take is slow
