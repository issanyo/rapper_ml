[Intro:]
You know what, I'm ma make it do what it do baby
I'm ma make it do what it do baby

[Verse 1:]
Now baby I just want to take U're freak'n clothes off
Kiss U're body while I take U're frak'n clothes off
Leave'dem heals on while I take U're clothes off
Leave'dem lights on, let me see u go off

[Chorus:]
Oo Oo, baby that's my body call'n ya name
Oo Oo, and baby that's ya body do'n the same
So act right, don't show me, back it up, now put it on me
Act right, don't show me, back it up, now put it on me
Now what u wanna do, wanna get high, wanna get fired up
What u wanna do, u wanna get sexed, u wanna get tied up
Get yo rodeo wired up, baby girl lift dem thighs up
I think u betta wise up, Cuz I'm about to rise up--repeat

[Verse 2:]
Now baby holla at me tell me what u miss'n
I can put in work from every position
From the kitchen table, 2 the bedroom floor

[Chorus:]
Oo Oo, baby that's my body call'n ya name
Oo Oo, and baby that's ya body do'n the same
So act right, don't show me, back it up, now put it on me
Act right, don't show me, back it up, now put it on me
Now what u wanna do, wanna get high, wanna get fired up
What u wanna do, u wanna get sexed, u wanna get tied up
Get yo rodeo wired up, baby girl lift dem thighs up
I think u betta wise up, Cuz I'm about to rise up--repeat

[Bridge:]
U're body, U're body's sho nuff singing baby
Show me how u use it girl, we gon pop some champagne
Listen to some music
Once we get our clothes off, wrap U're legs around my shoulders
And it's gon be just how I told ya
Baby I'm gon work you over
Now what u wanna do, wanna get high, wanna get fired up
What u wanna do, u wanna get sexed, u wanna get tied up
Get yo rodeo wired up, baby girl lift dem thighs up
I think u betta wise up, Cuz I'm about to rise up--repeat
Do what it do 2'night [repeat]
