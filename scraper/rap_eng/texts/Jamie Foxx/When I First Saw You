[Verse]
When I first saw you
I said "O My", I said "O My"
That's a dream
That's my dream
I needed a dream
When it all seemed to go bad
Then I found you
And I have had the most beautiful dreams any mans ever had

[Verse 2]
When I first saw you
I said "O My", "O My"
That's my dream
That's my dream
I needed a dream

To make me strong
You were the only reason I had to go on

[Chorus]
You were my dream
All the things I never knew
You were my dream
Who could believe they could ever come true
And who would believe
The world would believe
And my dreams too

[Verse 3]
When I first saw you
I said "O My", "O My"
That's my dream

[Fade Out]
