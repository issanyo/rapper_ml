This will be
A night that can't go wrong
You and me
We're loving all night long

Kissing and hugging, and touching and loving
And nothing is better than tonight together
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

This will be
A night that won't go wrong
You and me
Another shot of 'Tron

This will be
Is he recording this?

This will be
Another night, no
You and me
We're loving all night long

Kissing and hugging, and touching and loving
And nothing is better than tonight together
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

This will be
A night that won't go wrong
You and me
Another shot of 'Tron

This will be
Of maybe you'll go home with me, yeah

This will be
Women up in my ride
You and me
Look baby, we'll stay by

This could be
Another wild, wild night with me, Jenny, yeah

This could be
A night that won't go wrong
You and me
We're loving all night long

Kissing and hugging, and touching and loving
And nothing is better than tonight together

Stop it, stop it, son
