There are things that mean alot to me
(Precious)
Some are more important than others
But theres nothing more precious than my baby
(Precious)

It looks like the sun is gone
Here I sit all night long
Thinkin bout my baby shes on my mind
Well all of my friends stop by
But I just can't deny, I rather chill with my lady tonight
Because our lovin is strong and shes got it goin on
She swept me off my feet
Shes so unique..
And she'll come with me
Shes got my back in every way
And so im not afriad to stop and say, ooohh

It is much to long
Since I had a love this strong
I can't resist the temptations of life
And I must confess to you..
Your type of love is new
When Im with you everything is alright
Because your lovin' is bold, and it'll keep me from the cold
What I need is your love
Your precious love
And she'll come with me
Shes got my back in every way
So Im not afraid to stop and say ooohh
