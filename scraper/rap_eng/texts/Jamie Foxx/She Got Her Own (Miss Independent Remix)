[Intro]
Remix

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, she said leave mine alone
There ain't nothin that's more sexy
Than a girl that want, but don't need me
Young independent, yes she work hard
But you can't tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow 'em down, 'cause she ain't got time
To be complainin, shorty gon' shine
She don't expect nothin from no guy
She plays aggressive but she's still shy
But you'll never know her softer side, by lookin' in her eyes
Knowin' she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my wealth
Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin for her throne

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
I love her 'cause she got her own (ooh)
She got her own (oohhh)
I love her 'cause she got her own (ooh.....ooh)
She got her own (oohhh)
I love it when she say (ooh) it's cool I got it (ooh)
I got it (ooh), I got it (ooh)
I love it when she say (ooh) it's cool I got it (ooh)
I got it (ooh), I got it (ooh)

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Don't make me laugh boo, never did that bad to
Make you even have to, but even if I had to
Ask my better half to, you'd be more than glad to
When I do that math boo, you always try to add two
I need someone who ride for me (yes), not someone who ride for free (yes)
She said boy I don't just ride, she'll pull up beside of me
I had to ask her what she doin in that caddy
She said 'cause you my baby, I be stuntin like my daddy
And there's not many catch my eye
We both wearin Gucci, she match my fly
And that's why I supposed to keep her closer
Right by the side, toaster in the holster
And now she with 'loso (uh), 'case you didn't know so (uh)
You can save your money dog, shorty gettin dough so
What she care what his cost, you can call her Miss Boss
I got it backwards, criss cross, shorty got her own

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Ne-Yo]
I love her 'cause she got her own (ooh)
