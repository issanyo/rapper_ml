[Talking: Jamie Foxx]
I know he see me looking at you
And I know he know you looking at me
Well...damn

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
DJ, won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freaking love song
She's looking at me kinda hard, I can tell that things
Ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to beat it, beat it
Beat, beat it, beat it

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
I can see how you want it baby
Wish your man wasn't here with you baby
I can see, curiosity
Gotcha wanna try me, homeboy can't please you
On this wall in the open baby
You wouldn't care if the crowd was watchin' baby
You want it (you want it), I know it (I know it). Gotta notion to pull your
Ass up outta here

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
DJ, won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freaking love song
She's looking at me kinda hard, I can tell that things
Ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to beat it, beat it
Beat, beat it, beat it
DJ, won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freaking love song
She's looking at me kinda hard, I can tell that things
Ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to beat it, beat it
Beat, beat it, beat it

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Baby, I got things that I wanna say
Won't you meet me in the bathroom
We can pull a freaky episode, I got my Beretta
If the nigga come through
Baby, I know he ain't treating you right
Lady, look at your bad ass
Turn around (ooh), turn around (ooh)
Damn, you fine (ooh)

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
DJ, won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freaking love song
She's looking at me kinda hard, I can tell that things
Ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to beat it, beat it
Beat, beat it, beat it
DJ, won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freaking love song
She's looking at me kinda hard, I can tell that things
Ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to beat it, beat it
Beat, beat it, beat it

[Verse 3: Twista]
Tell me why he did you wrong
Need to get up with the Twista I been sippin' on Patron
Stroke it when I hold them legs up
He can take you out to dinner and look like a player
Ima give it to you good up in the elevator
He be actin' all soft when he get in them draws
Ima break you off and fuck you up against the wall
Finna move up in that slot cause I'm something he not
And he don't know what he got, I'm in the drop top
To get the twat I got a knot, no more running from the cops
Now I'm rolling with Foxx because the block's hot
But I'm always a G, cause I come from the streets and I got heat
For whoever thinking they want some no more fucking with them lames
Now you rolling with a thug, so tell that nigga to beat it, beat it

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
DJ, won't you play this girl a love song (DJ please)
She really needs to hear this freaking love song (Play this song for me)
She's looking at me kinda hard, I can tell that things
Ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to beat it, beat it
Beat, beat it, beat it
DJ, won't you play this girl a love song (DJ please)
She really needs to hear this freaking love song (Play this girl a song for me)
She's looking at me kinda hard, I can tell that things (That's what I need)
Ain't right on the home front (That's what she needs)
What she really needs is a G like me to beat it, beat it
Beat, beat it, beat it


[Outro]
DJ, play this girl a song
Turned her out, damn that clown, ain't been down
DJ, play this girl a song
