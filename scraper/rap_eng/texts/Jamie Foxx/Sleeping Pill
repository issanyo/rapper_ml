[Intro:]
You ok?
Yeah, what up?
You went out
I went out where?
You were asleep

[Verse 1:]
Damn
I've must of fallen asleep
All that I remember, girl
Is turning you over

I'm having flashbacks of your feet
On my chest
Around my waist
And over my shoulder
That thing was stronger than Patron

Got me higher than some weed
Hit me harder than some E
I guess I took the most of
Whatever you gave me
And it's all I need from you

[Chorus:]
When I'm on the inside
(Bottom of the ocean)
Girl, it feels like
(Swimming in slow motion)
I just took a sleeping pill

Girl, you got that sleeping pill
Had me in a coma all night
(Bottom of the ocean)
So gone that I couldn't gotten robbed
(Swimming in slow motion)

Girl, you got the sleeping pill
Ooh, you got that sleeping pill

[Verse 2:]
Damn
You must be playing for keeps
Sex's so good my toes are numb
And I can't feel my fingers

Girl, what you do with your love
Got your body singing harmony
But shorty
You ain't no singer

You should know that
A part of me to share with you
Never wants to wake up
Made a connection with your love inception

[Chorus:]
When I'm on inside
(Bottom of the ocean)
Girl, it feels like
(Swimming in slow motion)
I just took a sleeping pill

Oh, you got that sleeping pill
Had me in a coma all night
(Bottom of the ocean)
So gone that I couldn't gotten robbed
(Swimming in slow motion)

Ooh, you got the sleeping pill
Girl, you got that sleeping pill

[Bridge:]
Kinda love I'm feeling in
I lost control
Next thing I know
Body wouldn't go
Least I remember

Was closing my eyes
Kissing your lips
And went down to your thighs and then
After tonight
You changed my life

Don't be surprised
TV on Oprah
Broke down to my knees
Promoting my book about what you did to me

[Chorus:]
When I'm on inside
(Bottom of the ocean)
Girl it feels like
(Swimming in slow motion)
I just took a sleeping pill

Girl, you got that sleeping pill
Had me in a coma all night
(Bottom of the ocean)
So gone that I couldn't gotten robbed
(Swimming in slow motion)

Ooh, you got the sleeping pill
Girl, you got that sleeping pill
Kinda love I'm feeling in

When the morning inside
(Bottom of the ocean)
Girl, it feels like
(Bottom of the ocean)
I just took a sleeping pill

Oh, you got that sleeping pill
Had me in a coma all night
So gone I couldn't gotten robbed

Ooh, you got the sleeping pill
Girl, you got that sleeping pill
Kinda love I'm feeling in

Oh, oh
