[Verse 1]
By the time you get this letter
I might be doin' better
It's kinda hard trying to survive
In all this crazy weather
Everybody wants my number
Everybody's callin' my name
But in the midst of all of this
I can still hear you say

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Son, walk upright and straighten your tie
You don't want one of them good jobs to pass you by
Don't act no fool, I'm watching you
And now that you're gone
It still feels like you do, I wish

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish u were here
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here

[Verse 2]
Now all of these people ask me
"Is it lonely at the top?"
Or do I find comfort
In all the things I got
Well, these cars keep me movin'
These planes keep me high
A million dollar home
But I'm barely gettin' by cause

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I miss our talks
One thing you used to say (used to say)
When things got hard (Hard on me)
Get down on your knees and pray
And then those walks (then those walks)
Its just the simple things
We still do all of this
But only in my dreams, I wish

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
But sometimes I wonder why
Why can't you still be here wit me?
Wish God would've waited a couple more years for you to see
I'm tryna stay strong, barely holdin' on
I know I'll see you again
But for right now, rest in peace

And when I get to heaven
First thing they'll say to me
Tell me have you seen Estelle, Marie, Talley
Find out where you are, run into your arms
Wrap your wings around me
And whisper in my ear, "Well done"

[Chorus]
