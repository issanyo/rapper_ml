[Phone dialing & rings:]

[Adina:]
Hello?

[Jamie Foxx:]
Yo, what's up?
This is Jamie
What you doing?

[Adina:]
I was just thinking about you

[Jamie Foxx:]
Yeah, I was thinking about you too
I just got one question to ask you though?

[Adina:]
What's that?

[Jamie Foxx:]
What do you have on right now?

[Chorus:]
T-shirt & my panties on
T-shirt & my panties on
T-shirt & my panties on
T-shirt & my panties
Got my t-shirt & my panties on

Picture this
I'm in my bed
Body's hot
Soaking wet
Thinking bout the things I like to do
(I like to do)
I'm open wide
When it comes to freaking you
(Freaking you)

Imagine me
(Imagine me)
Wet as can be
Between my legs
You tasting me (tasting me), boy

When you get here
You know my love will overflow
And you ain't got to worry bout my clothes
Cause I got my

[Chorus x2]
T-shirt & my panties on
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt & my panties on
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt & my panties on
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt & my panites
Got my T-shirt & my panties on

T-shirt & my panties on
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt & my panties on
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt & my panties on
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt & my panites
Got my T-shirt & my panties on

Don't be surprised
When you come inside
Saddle up and be prepared to ride
Up and down
Back and forth

Can you feel me, baby?
Why don't you just take your time
Tonight you're mine
Gonna turn around
Hit it from behind

Boy, now that you're here
You know my love will overflow
And you ain't got to worry 'bout my clothes
Cause I got my

T-shirt & my panties on
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt & my panties on
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt & my panties on
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt & my panties
Got my T-shirt & my panties on

T-shirt & my panties on
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt & my panties on
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt & my panties on
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt & my panties
Got my T-shirt & my panties on

T-shirt & my panties on
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt & my panties on
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt & my panties on
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt & my panties
Got my T-shirt & my panties on

Don't you know
I'm feeling kinda sexy
Now that we are all alone, baby
Can we do the nasty in the privacy of our own home?

Baby, come a little closer
I unplugged all the telephones
Because tonight is special
I got my T-shirt and panties on

(T-shirt)
I'm Waiting for you
(Panties)
(I'm)
Waiting for you)

(T-shirt)
(I'm)
Waiting for you)
(Panties)
(I'm)
Waiting for you

T-shirt & my panties on
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt & my panties on
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt & my panties on
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt & my panties
Got my T-shirt & my panties on
