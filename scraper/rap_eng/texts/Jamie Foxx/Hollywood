[Verse 1]
After all the love and passion girl, I gave it to you, babe
After all the pain I've endured girl, while I was with you, babe
Since that we're over babe, I could see your halo slipping babe
And it's all my fault, you were in it for my lifestyle, no more denying now

[Hook]
She said said she wanna be alone, so I left her in Hollywood
She wanna be amongst the stars, so I left her in Hollywood
I left my heart in Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Paparazzi flashing, you blinded by the lights, hey baby
Our love was empty, there's nowhere inside, should I search and find it girl?
I can see our chapter ending babe, I can see your halo slipping babe
And it's all my fault, you were in it for my lifestyle, no more denying now

[Hook]
She said said she wanna be alone, so I left her in Hollywood
She wanna be amongst the stars, so I left her in Hollywood
I left my heart in Hollywood

[Bridge]
I can't believe that it's all over, oh
You left my heart so hurt babe, nothing for me to save
But goodbye, goodbye to a lie babe, no
Oh, goodbye to a lie girl

[Hook]
She said said she wanna be alone, so I left her in Hollywood
She wanna be amongst the stars, so I left her in Hollywood
I left my heart in Hollywood

[Outro]
Said she want to be alone, so I left her in Hollywood, oh
She wanna be amongst the stars, so I left her in Hollywood, oh
I left that ass in Hollywood
