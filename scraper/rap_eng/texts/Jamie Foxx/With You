[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
(Girl I got to get...)
Have you ever been to Spain in the slow lane
Holdin your name, play 'n' bet it like no pain, no gain
Let me show you wot your body is made for
Everything is on me it's all paid for
Bubble up, get in trouble up, and raise your level up (come on, come on)
Put your heart in, I beg your pardon
I fly away my seat regarding
(Girl I got to get...)

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I been thinking for the longest time
All your blowing trees are on there wind
Why you act like I can't be the only one for you, yeah
(Girl I got to get...)
And every time I try to walk away
You put that ass on me and made me stay
Girl I'm feeling so deceived
You got me feeling so confused, oooh
I got to get with you
(Girl I got to get...)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Lay up and spend cheese, Malibu breeze
Pop bottles on the regular
I toast the good smoke, meet your kin folks
And try to get next to ya
Good bye the lime light, head down south
And get ya mind right
Sex so good you can't believe it
Later on we can have some kids, that's what it is, Whoa

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
I'm not a player but I'm still a man
There's just some things you gotta understand
Girl you know I ride for you
But sometimes you just put me through
Sooo much, when I wanna get with you
(Girl I got to get...)
And I know that if you get your way (if you get your way)
You'll have me fiendin' for ya every day
Your smile, your kiss, your love, that exists for me, oooh
When I wanna get with you
(Girl I got to get...)

[Hook]

(Now let The Game begin!)

[Verse 4: The Game]
Next to you, your lexus coupe
My four door bentley, that Dre just sent me
Millionaire boys club, and my wrist freeze
Me and jacob got an understandin', I don't spend cheese
And I don't see no rock on ya hand
So my question to you is, where's ya man?
She said he been doing movies lately
And Game you got a baby face
Then she split like Tracy
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
Let 'em runaway, Watch 'em come back like Ma$e and
She an ATL freak, she get A town stomped
But she never been fucked on the beach
In silk Channel sheets, and it feel good baby
She looked back at me and said "you so craaazy"
After that she played me
I asked her whose pussy is this? And she screamed out "Jamie's"

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]

And now that I have put it all out on the line
Close the deal and wave the hands of time
Your king, my queen, a wedding ring, for you
Girl I wanna be with you
(Girl I got to get...)

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Snoop Dogg)]

Any time any place - can I be with you
Don't ya know, there's some things - I, just wanna be with you
Girl I'm still you man, Girl I'm still your man
(sex so good you can't believe it
Later on we can have some kids, that's what it is, Whoa)
Can I be with you?

[Hook + Chorus]

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]

Any time any place
Don't ya know, there's some things (hey)
Girl I'm still you man, Girl I'm still your man
