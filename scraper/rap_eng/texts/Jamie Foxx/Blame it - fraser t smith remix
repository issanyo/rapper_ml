Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

She said, she usually don't
But I know that she front
'Cause shawty know what she wan't
She don't wanna to seem like she's easy

I ain't saying what you won't do
But you know what we're probably gon' do
What you been feenin' deep inside

Let it out now, girl what you drinkin', gon' let it sink in
Here for a weekend, thinkin', we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down I'd know it

Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt what
You don't even care now, I was unaware
How fine you was before
My buzz set in, my buzz set in

Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Ooh see, she spilled some drink on me
And now I'm knowin' she tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keeps staring me right in my eyes

No tellin' what I'm gon' do
Baby, I would rather show you
What you been missin' in your life
When I get inside

Girl, what you drinkin'? Don't let it sink in
Here for the weekend, thinkin', we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round if your down, I'm fallin'

Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt what
You don't even care now, I was unaware
How fine you was before
My buzz set in, my buzz set in

Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

T-Pain
Girl, I know you feel good
Just like you look, couple more shots
You open up like a book, I ain't trippin 'cause I'ma read ya
Shawty, I ain't trippin', I jus' wanna please ya

I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty, then you know
It's going down, we can go kick it like Judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say I, I

Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride
All over my ride

She look me dead in the eye
Then my pants got bigga
She already knew what to figga
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck dat nigga"

Blame it on the juice, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on a blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Now to the ballas poppin' bottles
With they henny in they cups screamin'
Money ain't a thing, if it ain't throwin' it up in the sky
Hold your drinks up high

And to my independent ballas
Who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model
When them broke fellas holla, tell 'em, bye
Hold your drinks up high

You can blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
