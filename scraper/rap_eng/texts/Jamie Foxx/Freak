Yeah, feel real good

Cameras on the ceiling
Cameras on the corners of my bed
I barely know you but I'm feeling
Like you really did something to my head

It's close to midnight
And I just want to be up in your hair
And I'll be alright
Long as I feel your body right there
It seems so crystal clear, I know that

Everybody's somebody's freak
Say it again, say it again
Everybody's somebody's freak
The question is, whose are you?

Well, can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?

Don't need no television
I'll just watch your body going down
I'll touch you with precision
Go crazy when you make those sounds

Feels like a wet dream
This time, baby, you can be the star
A freaky sex dream
Visualize, make sure you play your part
And when I get nice and hard, turn the lights on

Everybody's somebody's freak
Say it again, say it again
Everybody's somebody's freak
The question is, whose are you?

Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?

Vases, chandeliers, glass of wine, can of beer
Alcohol can't end the fear, here's the wheel, can you steer?
Don't need tickets in the Lear, you perform I would share
You can scream, no one hears, feed your face, no one cares

The floor appears to be yours
Go 'head, pop the champagne
Just like we're on a world tour
Sex would be a campaign

'Cause everybody's somebody's freak
Say it again, say it again
Everybody's somebody's freak
The question is, whose are you?

Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?

I think that's enough
Yeah, turn the lights on
