Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on Patron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a...

Ay she say she usually don't
But I know that she front
Shawty know what she want
But she don't wanna seem like she easy
I ain't saying what you won't do
But you know we probably gonna do
What you've been feeling deep inside
Don't lie now

Girl what you drinking?
Gonna let sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking
We can
See what we can be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down I know it
Fill another cup up
Feeling on yo butt what?
You don't even care now
I was unaware how fine you were before my buzz set in, my buzz set in

Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on Patron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henney
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a...

Oh see
She spilled some drink on me
And now I'm knowing she's tipsy
She puts her body on me
And she keep staring me right in my eyes
No telling what I'm gonna do
Baby I would rather show you
What you been missing in your life when I get inside

And now I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Baby I would rather show you
Now I'm really ???
Now this party's really started
Blame it on the alcohol

Girl I know you feel good
Dancing like you look
Couple more shots you open up like a book
I ain't tripping (cause I'm a read ya)
Shawty I ain't tripping (I just want to please ya)
You can take a shot of nuvo, you know
It's going down can we kick it like judo (judo)
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk thought it all was a dream
So I made her say ahh, ahh ahh
Now she got her hand on my leg
And my seats all wet in my ride (all wet in my ride)
All over my ride (all over my ride)
She look me dead in the eye, eye eye
Then my pants got bigger
She already knew what the figure
Had her looking her boyfriend like

Now to tha ballas popping bottles
With their Henney in their cups
Screaming money ain't a thang
If it ain't throw it up in the skyyy (sky)
Hold your drinks up highhhh (high)
And to my independent mamas
Who can buy their own bottles
If you looking like a model
When them broke fellas holla
Tell them byeee (bye)
Hold your drinks up highhhh (high)

Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on Patron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henney
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol
