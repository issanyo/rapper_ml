[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Booty like, to the bass like go
Known to pop champagne when the girls dance slow
Shawty in my ear like "Aw let's go"
Got a king-size bed, that I know for sure

[Hook]
She keep on grabbing me, like we all alone
She keep on telling me, what you waiting for?
She wanna fuck right now, right now, now, right
She wanna fuck right now, right now, now, right

[Verse 2]
Oh, shawty just slow down
I'm hitting 21s all night, lucked out
Bottles of the best, got money to burn
I tell her make it rain, ass baby look at her moan, yeah
Sliding my hand up your thigh babe
Paying nothing but attention
While I'm making you moan
Tell you and your girls to come on

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And it's safe to assume babe, yeah
You'll get the grand tour of my room, oh
The way you dance in that dress, I'm kinda impressed
And I like the way you letting me know that you ready to go

[Hook x2]
She wanna fuck right now, right now, now, right
She wanna fuck right now, right now, now, right
She wanna fuck right now, right now, now, right
She wanna fuck right now, right now, now, right
