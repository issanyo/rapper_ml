[Verse 1]
I start by saying tell me something good, show me something great
What you doing early, what you doing late?
Do you think that you could put me in your plans?
If you invite me over girl, I'll bring the drinks
Today I'm gon' be free so girl it's up to you
And you already know the things I like to do
I ain't really with the beating 'round the bush
You already know, so let's go, baby

[Hook]
Tell me how to get there, send me on your address
Tell me how to get there, already be on your address
Started with a text message, ended with sex, yes it's true, I wanna be on you
Started with a text message, ended with sex, yes it's true, I wanna be on you

[Verse 2]
LOL smiley face, the emoji with the tongue out
Now I'm kissing you, touching you, freaking you over at your house
Cause girl we started on the phone now we face to face
Started a little slow now pick up the pace
Everything I told you I was gonna do
I did it well except we didn't get the drinks
Your body, I want it until the morning, baby
I came by for you, I'm a love alcoholic

[Hook]

[Bridge]
LOL smiley face, the emoji with the tongue out
Now I'm kissing you, touching you, freaking you over at your house

[Hook]
Started with a text message, ended with sex, yes it's true, I wanna be on you
Started with a text message, ended with sex, yes it's true, I wanna be on you
