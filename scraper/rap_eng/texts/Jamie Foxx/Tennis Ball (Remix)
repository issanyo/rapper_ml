[Hook]
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be yours
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your
Tennis ball, tennis ball (Harmony!)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be yours (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your (Oh, Serena, Serena)
Tennis ball, tennis ball, tennis ball

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Baby, for a year, I longed to be your man
I can be your tennis ball
You can pop me out of a can
Play court, grass court
Girl, it don't mix grass
Tuck me, baby, right, right next to your ass, babe

[Hook]
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be yours
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
But I heard some news
I hope this just ain't right
Somebody dropped a dime
Said you was seeing somebody white
What the flip-joein is going on?
What the flip-joein is going on?
What the flip-joein is going on?

Stop, wait a minute
Stop, stop, stop

[Hook]
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be yours
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
Cos if I was your ball
If I was your ball, girl, there is no doubt
If I was your ball I would never net out of bounds
Drop shot, top spin, US Open, Wimbledon
I was your tennis ball, you wouldn't be that merchant, ah

[Hook]
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be yours
(Everybody sing it with me)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your
(I just wanna be, I just wanna be)
Tennis ball, tennis ball (Stop)

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
Don't you know you look so fine?
Whoever you're seeing
His tennis racket ain't big as mine
See this racket, can you handle it?
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be yours
(Can you handle it? Can you handle it)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your
Tennis Ball, Tennis Ball

[Break: Jamie Foxx]
You know what I want you to do?
I want you to hit me one time
Hit me
Ah, that felt good (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hit me two time (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Damn it, hit me three times (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hit me four times (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You know what? Hit me infinity
Oh, yeah, alright, come on
Oh, ooh, baby, ten-
