Last night me and my dawgs were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups n downs had me in a twist
Started dancing wit this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember

'Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was layin' next to me
Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed and got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Everything that I remember

'Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza
I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

Extravaganza
Extravaganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes it was the things that I remember

And I remember bein' at the bar tryin' to ask what that hypno hit fo'
Knowin' I can't afford to get mo'
Here's a broke nigga tricked by 1 buy one and six flo'
Or or leave the club now do like I did come back when you get dough
A fishstick...now we messin' wit lobster
We messin' wit Grammies we messin' wit Oscars
We messin' wit that dranky drank
Plus you puffin' on the...
In the mornin' you gon' draw a blank
The hotel say you was ours
My girl wasn't on shit I picked the wrong one
'Stead he talkin' 'bout I like them other girls
Well tonight I'm tryin' to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Meet your mother girl
You know they love it when you love em when they tell they friends girl

I had one too many drinks (I had one too many (You know they gon' blame it on the drinks))
And ended up at the embassy (you know the excuse is to do exactly what you want)
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee (J.Foxx, Kanye to the...)
It was a one night extravaganza (And the winners are)
I had one too many drinks (thats BSP baby, we got black star power in the room right now)
And ended up at the embassy (easy, easy, be very easy)
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee (calm down please)
It was a one night extravaganza (I ain't see the periods)
I had one too many drinks
