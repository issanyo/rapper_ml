I smoke millions of spliffs and it's got me coughing
Yeah I'm ill when I spit but that's not important
You need to chill with the lip and stop the talking
Cuz I'm still in this bitch like a botched abortion
A sublime writer, I shine brighter when it gets dark
Embrace the reaper, the pace keeper in a death march
Get it right, tryna breathe a breath of life into this dead art
So let's start, before I lose my head like Ned Stark
How yo stupid ass gonna know when I get smart
You're some gassed up pieces of shit, bunch of wet farts
Ill fuck your bitch leave her pussy with stretch marks
Then make her blow me in the morning, now that's what I call a head start
The best part you making threats claimin you spraying tecs
And breaking necks like you're fucking hard, trust me god I ain't impressed
Y'all got gay Tourette's cuz everything you say is about as straight as the Greek monks who invented anal sex
Save your breath, my dirty mouth is rated X
So you can be certain, even my clean version would make a mess
This game about as truthful as the blame on Dave Koresh
But when I get there it's a breath of fresh air like Nasonex
Cuz every minute mental midgets will misdirect ya
That's why y'all are lost falling off like the limbs of lepers
Y'all got it twisted this isn't a business venture
It's about being the illest ever, proving no one did it better
So fuck your ice like a kid sick of the winter weather
I find a simple pleasure in the middle finger gesture
I've been a jester, but if I'm gonna disrespect ya
Got a windchester that'll open up your chest like a hidden treasure
I know the ramifications that violence brings
But I'm here to fight the tyrant king, and trust me homie I will swing
Ain't happy with this game so you'll never see me smiling
Cuz I got reservations like natives at a Buffalo Wild Wings
Cuz everyday there's a different trend
So I came quicker than minutemen and spit a gem so this shit will end
In each bar I rep DR like I'm Dominican
So every verse I got some rabid rabbits screaming finish them
I drop crews, fuck your diamonds I got jewels
Here to stop your pop trend, when I drop gems like Bob Yule
I will not lose, it was preordained by God's rules
So come try it, battles are one sided like Fox News
Charge in to the scuffle and leave with scarred knuckles
You give a bad name to the art like Art Garfunkel
You clowns think you hard til I let out a hard chuckle
Rose out of the charred rubble to put a hole through your large bubble
I knock son out with a slo-mo slap
And have him passing out quicker than some promo wax
Fucking up the game when heads say them homo raps
So I'm untamed like El Da Sensei's solo tracks
And I came to slap ya, leave you with facial fractures
I don't care if you an A-list actor or a famous rapper
Full of liquor pull the trigger after I aim it at ya
Then climb Jacob's ladder straight out of a snake's cadaver
My birth certificate was inscripted with ancient data
Yours was inscripted with bitch shit, insignificant aimless chatter
Shatter the foundation then shake the rafters
Leave you slain in a great disaster if that's the kind of fame you're after
Made to smash ya, don't matter if you show us love
You homo thugs sound like a bad over dub a culture club
I'ma shut it down cuz whenever I open up
I dispense writtens that are verbal renditions of Noah's flood
Overlord I never retreat when I go to war
I would swing a broken sword at these hopeful frauds vocal cords
You'll get run thru quicker than a local whore
I own my Honda, so when I run you over it's on my own accord
I like my rum red, I used to be a blunt head
Now heads call me blunt cuz I say the stuff that is unsaid
You making hollow points like you wrote your joints with gun lead
Believe it or not they sleeping at the top like a bunk bed
Fucking legendary, screamed into your face til my lungs bled
These fakes are unnecessary like the remake of Judge Dredd
Ain't tryna pass the rock to me, they don't want to see the love spread
Cuz they know us small timers will dunk it on their head like Spud Webb
With the desire of Dr. King's speech writer
Teach in each cypher a plan to reach higher before I retire
I've had enough of these liars
Didn't master the craft and your flashing a pan like a grease fire
We're dealing with children so give them a gold star
These fucking lames are underage why you think they got no bars
Tooting they own horn like the sounding of the chauffeur
But y'all should know it ain't that hard to blow when you blow hard
You a hoe god, so what you got a show car
But you about two years removed from cruising in a go-kar who are y'all joking, get your jaw broken with a crowbar
Have you speaking through the wire like Kanye quoting Omar
Fuck raising the bar, I'll bench press your leader
The best yet so when I catch wreck you can expect the heater
I'll stick it in a hoe's ass and death threat a beaver
So they say I got no class like an excess teacher
But don't try to school me I'm a fast learner
Y'all some actors surrounded by more garbage rappers than a trash worker
Going after my masters like Nat Turner with a black burner
Kill a priest while he's preaching and then call that shit mass murder
Hip-Hop is socially disordered like Asperger's
You little teras can bite, whatever I write will crash servers
You behind your computer thinking that I can't hurt ya
Cuz you hang with clowns who think they got beef, you the Hamburglar
I'll turn you imposters into red sauce
Now you dead ironically the embodiment of how to dead walk
My off of the top would take the top of your head off
My freestyles defy logic so they became a topic on TED Talks
We should be headlining doing 30 shows in a month
We the godfather instead they got us opening up
Y'all must be smoking some dust
We like the intentions of a date rape sedative, we doper than fuck
Yeah, I'm on one like the first of the year
Working to clear this Earth's surface of these purposeless queers
I'm confirming your fears, the Mayans weren't wrong
They just miscalculated when this verse would appear
Hear to murk your illest verse with only a minutes work
You little dicks are introverts, we'd see your pussy if I lift your skirt
And I'm the illest thing that ever hit this earth
I make the most interesting man in the world carry my bitch's purse
I'm swinging first and then I'm stomping intruders
Somebody let the monster in, you ain't stopping him junior
Hip-Hop is toppling, you should have got me in sooner
Cuz lacking common sense is now Common like Lonnie Lynn Jr
I will not be in rumors, I don't need your fake props
You rookies a bunch of pure pussies like some shaved twat
Blinded bitches defying physics tryna occupy the same spot
So I'ma bury every one of y'all in the same grave plot

"First take a big step back and literally FUCK YOUR OWN FACE!! I will rain down in a Godly fucking firestorm upon you! You're gonna have to call the fucking United Nations and get a fucking binding resolution to keep me from fucking destroying you. I'm talking scorched earth, motherfucker! I will massacre you. I will fuck you up!!"
