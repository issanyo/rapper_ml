I wanna party, I wanna samba
I wanna party, I wanna samba
I wanna party and live my life
I wanna party and fly
I'ma fly, fly just like a bird
(But you are a bird)
Oh yeah, you're right
So let me fly just like a rocket then
Fly so high
Where I need to come down for oxygen
'Cause once we start it
Baby, ain't no, ain't no stoppin' then
'Cause I just want to live my life and party
All I want is to be free and rock my body
I been around the world that I want to live my life
In Rio 'cause in Rio, 'cause in Rio, I realize
I wanna party, I wanna samba
I wanna party and fly
I'm that samba, samba
Master, master, master, master, master
Who shouts out?
From a ghetto blaster, blaster, blaster, blaster, blaster
You dance fast
But I dance faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
You're too slow
You need to catch up, you can dance and dance but
I wanna party, I wanna samba
I wanna party, I wanna samba
I wanna party and live my life
I wanna party and fly, oh whoa
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
