We never thought
You now the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is starting
You can throw on your boots and hit the city lights
Cause all this music in the air
You like to love it everywhere
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
We need the evening action
A glass of wine, a little late romance
It changes the action
See the people of the world, coming out today
Cause all this music in the air
You like to love it everywhere
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
Just give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
So come on out tonight
And it will be your
Cause we're on the run to Paradise
And if we'll be alone
If we could be lovers
Cause I see that star that I'm looking at
Don't you know we can fly?
Baby, tonight
Just give me, just give me tonight!
Just give me, give me tonight!
Just give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
So come on out tonight
And it will be your
Cause we're on the run to Paradise
And if we'll be alone
If we could be lovers
Cause I see that star that I'm looking at
Don't you know we can fly?
And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening
Taking us that high
Never mind the weather
Cause we'll be dancing on the streets
Till the morning light
Cause all this music in the air
You like to love it everywhere
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
So give me the night!
Just give me, give me tonight!
