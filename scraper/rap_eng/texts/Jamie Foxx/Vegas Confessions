[Verse 1]
All that she want, to see the bright lights in Vegas
Smoke 'til she's painless, she asked and I gave it
How can I deny? So I passed her a light
She's trapped in her mind, until she opened her eyes, eyes and recognise a real nigga
She was a drug, I'm rolling her up
Catching a buzz, off of her love
So many options, shawty got me sprung, body hot Bunsen
Girl make me go numb

[Hook]
Baby your body leaves me all hungover
Take my breath away, not a word or a verb
What happens here stays here
Out in Vegas yes

[Verse 2]
All that she want, was to make love in Paris
Take her right back to Vegas, and go half on a baby
How can I deny? So I passed her a light
She's trapped in her mind, until she opened her eyes, eyes and recognise a real nigga
Out where to start, drive the fancy cars, live the fast life, name in bright lights, name in bright lights
Take a gamble, what do you want? Something particular
Sip of Ciroc making you hot, shaking the atmosphere, yeah
Big as a dance floor, let her know my flow, oh she wants the bright lights

[Hook]

[Bridge]
All that she want, to see the bright lights in Vegas
Smoke 'til she's painless, she asked and I gave it
How can I deny? So I passed her a light
She's trapped in her mind, until she opened her eyes, eyes and recognise a real nigga
