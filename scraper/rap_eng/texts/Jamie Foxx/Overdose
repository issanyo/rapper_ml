They said I had it bad
Addicted to what we had
Heart rate's slow, fading fast
Vitals low might not last
Strapped down while sirens ring
Holding on, trying to breathe
Not like this, I can't leave
Look what you've done to me

I've overdose overdose overdose on you
They said I've overdose overdose overdose on you
'Cause I want you close. Need you the most
Without you, I'm just through
So I've overdose overdose overdose on you

Rushing me, switching lanes
IV's going through my veins
Blood tests say no cocaine
They don't know you're the blame
Cause you're deep inside of me
So this is goodbye to me
But for you, I'll die happily
One more hit, I'll be free

'Cause I've overdose overdose overdose on you
They said I've overdose overdose overdose on you
'Cause I want you close. Need you the most
Without you, I'm just through
So I've overdose overdose overdose on you

'Cause I know that you would kill me
'Cause I'm sweatin, tweakin, feenin
Never been so high
But damn I love this feeling
Cause I'm achin, breakin, shakin
Will I make it through the night?
And now my body's cold
I'm losing, cause I was abusing it. Oh no
Can't nobody help, I did it to myself
And that's why I'll do it again and again

I've overdose overdose overdose on you
They said I've overdose overdose overdose on you
'Cause I want you close. Need you the most
Without you, I'm just through
'Cause I've overdose overdose overdose on you
