[Verse 1]
Walked up in the spot like what
Gettin’ love from the ladies and the thugs
I’m just tryna get this party off
So this be a night to remember
Ladies lookin’ so damn fly
About ten of them caught my eyes
I might show them the time if their lives
Cause its a special party tonight

[Chorus]
Everybody in my party is VIP
We gon' sip champagne for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
Lettin’ people in
Cause everybody in my party is VIP
We gon' shot patron for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
Come on to VIP

[Verse 2]
Niggas ain’t been givin’ no mugs
Their just tyrna get their cups filled up
With that juice that makes ya wanna [?]
Cause the mood is alright in here
Ladies ain’t been trippin’ at all
She’s been promising them draws gone fall
I might love you right in front of all ya'll
Cause its all my party, I can do what I want to

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everybody’s with me
Halle Berry, Jada and Mary J. Blidge, Vivica
And Latifah, Oprah tonight
All my homies with me

Denzel, Samuel tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
