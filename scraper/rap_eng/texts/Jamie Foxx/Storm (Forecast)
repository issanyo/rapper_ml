[Verse 1]
Got nothing but my t-shirt and boxers on
Waiting for you to get home
Its been sunny outside all day baby
I can't wait for it to storm
Wanna feel your raindrops fallin' down all on me
That thunder from down under surrounding me
Coming down hard pounding me

[Chorus]
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come

[Verse 2]
Lights out like a power outage
Cause of the lighting in your bedspring showers
I can feel the mist everytime we kissed
Just didn't know a downpour like this
There's a flash flood warning
Till we wake up in the morning
There'll be puddles in the bed
The weatherman said
Girl the rain is coming

[Chorus]
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come

[Bridge]
Girl the weatherman said...
Its cloudy skies, right there between your thighs
I'm pluckin' for scattered showers, for about an hour
Rain on me tonight
Now let me love you (love you and soon I wanna kiss you)
And girl let me kiss you, (all over you) let me
Sex youuu, (I just want you to) rain on meeee, yeah

[Chorus]
Girl, Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
