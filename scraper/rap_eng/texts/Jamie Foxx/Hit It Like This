Come on, yeah, uh, yeah, come on, yeah

Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma

Shorty on my lap getting all into it
Knock back shots so we all getting stupid
And I don't dance, so the drinks must of loosened me up
Must of loosened me up

Wall working is what she doing
Make all the chicks feel so damn useless
Yet the DJ's spinning but the whole time she's screaming off
That this her a song

And I'll spend just about anything, I won't lie, to get you home
And don't be scared, just give it here girl I promise

Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma

Now we're back stage with Patron-like fluid
Time to get it in and try to outspin with the music
Borderline out her skirt, so I'm ready to
First we start the touching, then we start the kissing

Girl I'ma give you what you're missing
Put it on repeat all night long, tell the DJ
That this her a song

And I'll spend just about anything, I won't lie, to get you home
And don't be scared, just give it here girl I promise

Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her

Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
(So many things I wanna do)
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her

Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma
