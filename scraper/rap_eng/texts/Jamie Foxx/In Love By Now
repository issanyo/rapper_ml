[Hook]
I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now
It's been so long for me, I don't know how, by now
Been drowning in the sea of broken vows, by now
But I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now

[Bridge]
I've been chasing my dream, now I'm chasing you
Running hard but my legs feel weak
I done played every part, I done played a fool
Write the movie, I'll be your lead

[Verse 1]
Cause I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now
Well girl you stole my heart now take a bow, by now
In love by now
Well I'm supposed to walk you down the aisle, by now
Change your name and make your parents smile, by now
Leave the Church, make plans to celebrate, by now
A big old house and babies on the way, by now

[Bridge]
I've been chasing my dream, now I'm chasing you
Running hard but my legs feel weak
I done played every part, I done played a fool
Write the movie, I'll be your lead

[Verse 2]
Well I'm supposed to be in love today, by now
Go through my phone and throw 'em all away, by now
In love by now
Without your love, I want what they say when they write my stories
Without your touch, I'll never know how it feels to fly
Drown in my emotions, now it's all on me
Eyes are finally open to love I couldn't see
Can't wait 'til I can say bless the day you landed in my arms

[Outro]
I'm supposed to be in love by now
I'm supposed to be in love by now
In love by now
