Verse1:
So many sleepless days and sleepless nights
I spend alone
Wondering if I'll make it
Make it on my own
Without someone to hold me
With that holding power
If not for a lifetime at least for an hour
But this machine that clicks inside my head
All so cold
I'm hanging by a string
Never let it go

Chorus:
How my heartbreaks
How the tears roll
It's you I'm thinking of
But don't let the sun come down on our love
Love ooh

Verse2:
Sometimes I think I'm falling
And no one is concerned
I'm headed down that pathway
The point of no return
Now if I had your love
Your sweetness always

Always to guide me safely through
I'm absolutely lost
When I'm without you

Chorus:
How my heartbreaks
How the tears roll
It's you I'm thinking of
But don't let the sun come down on our love
Love ooh

Bridge:
So many sleepless days and sleepless nights
You know I spend alone
Alone
Girl I'm left with no one
No one to call my own
But this machine that clicks inside my head
All ooh so cold out here
I'm hanging by a string
Never letting go
How my worlds turned around
Almost to the ground
It's you I'm thinking of
But don't let the sun come down on our love
Oooh
