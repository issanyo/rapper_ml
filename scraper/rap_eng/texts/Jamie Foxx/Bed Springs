(Jamie Foxx)
Climb on up on my bed
On gone grab between your legs
Turn you over
Love you down
Yea we be making freaky sounds all night
Yea heres my pillow
When you need it
Just in case you get to screamin
Well don't wake the neighbors
I just moved in
Yeah they just might be listening
When we work the bed springs

(chorus)
Bed springs up and down back
And and forth baby
Work the bed springs
I got what your feeling for
Can you work the bedsprings
Up and down side to side
Baby work the bed springs
Yeaah
(Jamie Foxx)
I'm goin to take it nice and slow (nice and slow)
For my bed to the floor
I hold you gently in my arms
Yea cuz girl i know your love is warm
Ohhh feeling tribin for you all over me
From the bed room to the kitchen table
I'm able (girl)
Anything you do I'm willin
I don't let you baby it ain't

(chorus)
And your body lyin next to mine
I can fill your side up and fown my spine
Like the way i kiss
Kiss you on your lips work the bed springs!

(chorus)
