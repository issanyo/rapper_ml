You know what, I'm ma make it do what it do baby

[Verse I:]
Now baby I just wanna take U're freak'n clothes off
Kiss U're body while I take U're freak'n clothes off
Leave'dem heals on while I take U're clothes off
Leave'dem lights on, let me see U go off

[Chorus:]

So act right, don't show me, back it up, now put it on me, act right, don't show me, back it up, now put

Get yo rodeo wired up, baby girl lift dem thighs up

Cuz I'm about 2 rise up
Now what U wanna do, U wanna get high

Get yo rodeo wired up, baby girl lift dem thighs up

Cuz I'm about 2 rise up

[Verse II:]
Now baby holla at me tell me what U miss'n
I can put in work from every position
From the kitchen table, to the bedroom floor

[Chorus:]
Oo Oo, baby that's my body call'n ya name
Oo Oo, and baby that's ya body do'n the same
So act right, don't show me, back it up, put it on me, act right, don't show me, back it up, put it on me

Now what U wanna do, U wanna get high

What U wanna do, U wanna get sexxed

Now what U wanna do, U wanna get high

[Bridge:]
U're body, U're body's sho nuff singing baby
Show me how U use it girl
We gon pop some champagne
Listen to some music
And once we get our clothes off
Wrap U're legs around my shoulders
And it's gon be just like I told ya
Baby I'm gon work you over

What U wanna do, U wanna get high
U wanna get fired up
What U wanna do, U wanna get sexxed
U wanna get tied up
Get yo rodeo wired up, baby girl lift dem thighs up
I think U betta wise up
Cuz I'm about to rise up
What U wanna do, U wanna get high
U wanna get fired up
What U wanna do, U wanna get sexxed
U wanna get tied up
Get yo rodeo wired up, baby girl lift dem thighs up
I think U betta wise up
Cuz I'm about to rise up
