[Justin Timberlake:]
I'm wakin, up in the morning
Hustling to the stage and fuckin performin'
Bustlin' through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothing misses I must've been scorin'
Speaking of the Misses I'm watchin' 'em pour in
Just like a drink that I'm enjoying
I don't mean bottles - you're welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin' - Feeling like Jordan

Oh-oh
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
Oh-oh
You ain't heard, I'm the shit
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut, but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on, but guess what?

[Chorus:]
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[Jamie Foxx:]
I'm steppin', out in the evening
People in there screaming, you gotta be cheating
But I'm so breezy, I make this look easy
No faking I'm seizing, you gotta believe it
I went from TV's, to screens, to DVDs
To CDs, to MP3s, overseas - I got
No time, the talkin' is boring
Just look at me soarin' - Feeling like Jordan

Oh-oh
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
Oh-oh
You ain't heard, I'm the shit
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut, but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on, but guess what?

[Chorus:] I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[T.I.:]
That's right
You see the - Porsche Panamera got 'em in hysteria
The turbo super fast, and that Mclaren even scarier
Hemme turnin' corners, burnin' rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once i pop clutch and hit the throttle
ReI'm recession-proof
I don't run to money - money run to me
In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugattis, Maseratis, new Ferraris - I got one of each
My future bright, tight
Like the bitch I got in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die at the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best - no Auto-Tune
Been in the lead, so you seen can't follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as an old Cadillac

[Chorus:]
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner
