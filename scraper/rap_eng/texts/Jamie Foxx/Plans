[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
Can't wait to get my hands on you, hands on you
Come and put it down on me
Come and put it down on me, on me
Come and put it down on me
Come and put it down on me

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Girl I just want to tell you that you're beautiful
You probably hear that everyday like it's the usual
Keep saying I'm too young, cougar flow
Not a man of many words, but no excuses though
I used to see you on the two
I ain't game goofy baby I know all the rules
When my name pop up all in your notifications
With that eggplant emoji, know I'm trying to say something
We don't gotta waste time, we can Facetime
You can teach me with your waist line, I know you ain't shy
Yeah I heard it through the grape vine, you a great time
When I shoot my shot I make mine, top it baseline
You know

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
Can't wait to get my hands on you, hands on you
Come and put it down on me
Come and put it down on me, on me
Come and put it down on me
Come and put it down on me

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
You know you're worth it
In my eyes you're perfect
One thing is for sure
Two things are certain
And this thing is true
And it's all about you

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
Can't wait to get my hands on you, hands on you
Come and put it down on me
Come and put it down on me, on me
Come and put it down on me
Come and put it down on me

[Verse 2: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Now that I got up in that room, I'm trying to find a bae
You being Hollywood, I'm from the city by the bay
I hop up on that hour flight, and I ain't come to play
I be at the W, you should come and stay
I've been making plans come and look at my planner
I can spoil you with gifts, come and sit with Santa
I love the way you slay, call me secret admirer
I can be your Urkel, always had a thing for Myra
You've been bad for a while, girl I know you're tired
Set the bar high, get a low life inspire
I'm the type to stay until the whip lose the tires
Say you got plans, girl you preaching to the choir
You know

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
I've been making plans for you, plans for you
Can't wait to get my hands on you, hands on you
Come and put it down on me
Come and put it down on me, on me
Come and put it down on me
Come and put it down on me
