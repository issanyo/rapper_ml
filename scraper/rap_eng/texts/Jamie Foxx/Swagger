Paroles de la chanson Swagger :
(feat. Rick Ross)

[Rick Ross:]
Ricky Ross, Jamie Foxx
It's deeper than rap baby

[Rick Ross:]
Biggest name in the biz say she lookin at I
No one way
Two step I'm fly
Play the Commodores
Commutin' on Concords
When you're talkin' D boys
You're talkin' 'bout one boy
Me, boy
Louis Vt [? ]boys
Like playin' T-ball
Playin' with these boys
Grand slam, my swag
I score high price tags

[Jamie Foxx:]
I know this beat is smooth
You think I don't see you [x2]

I seen ya lookin at me when I walked in
Whisperin somethin to your friends
He's a playa, uh uh uh, he's a playa
Studyin me from my head to my feet
Lil' mama I can tell you wanna creep
With a playa
Come get with a playa
So I dedicate this song to you
And if you in da club right now
And see somebody like that next to you
Jus' tell 'em

Ain't no way, no how
You got mo' swagga than me
So get your swag up, swag (swag up) (go home)
So get your swag up, swag (swag up) (go home)
[x2]

I know this beat is smooth
But still I don't see you [x2]

You've been mean muggin' me all night
It looks like you and your boys wanna fight
Quit hatin, and start participatin
You try to bump into me when I walk by
But I'm the wrong damn one for you to try
Dawg, quit hatin, and start congratulatin
So I dedicate this song to you
And if you in da club right now
And see somebody like that next to you
Jus' tell 'em

Ain't no way, no how
You got mo' swagga than me
So get your swag up, swag (swag up) (go home)
So get your swag up, swag (swag up) (go home)
[x2]

I got swag for days
Swag for days
I got swag for days
Swag for days (ohhhh)

[Rick Ross: (ad lib)]
I feel like new money
Might smell like a few hundred
You lookin at it, get it
Cause when you want it I want it (uh huh)
Yeah they lookin at me funny
Baby I'm used to it
Give me they undivided
I school 'em like new students
Plane tickets for the women
Import 'em so we can kick it
Might take ya home and lick it
And blame it all on the liquor
Swag getting checked
Levi denim
Very inexpensive
It's about who's in 'em
10 Millionaire, these shades for the glare
Cause a cold front when I wave in the air
Shorty you good
Should move with a G
Crib so big every room is a suite

[Jamie Foxx:]
Ain't no way, no how
You got mo' swagga than me
So get your swag up (swag up) (go home)
So get your swag up (swag up) (go home)
[x2]
