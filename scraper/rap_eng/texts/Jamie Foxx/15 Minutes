Excuse but I was wondering when
You were gonna speak ?cause I saw you lookin
Back to the wall talking to all your friends
Thinking out loud did he see me again
Let me find out, you ain?t gettin that lovin like you should
Let me find out, they ain't puttin it down, like you know I would
Girl I know what is what you?re looking for
Girl I know what is just you need
And you?re tired of all that foolishness
Girl you need fucking wit me
Come and find out, whats the reason why they be runnin they mouth
Come and find out, what?s all the hoopla what?s all the buzzin about
?cause baby, you can get it, you can get it
Tell me just say the world and I'm gonna give it
I?m no wasting your time, running my mouth sellin lines, just sayin whats on my mind

[Chorus]
If you give me 15 minutes I?ll make you feel like a woman tonight
All I need is 15 minutes to take you on the ride of your life
Baby, all I need is 15 minutes anymore than that would kill the vibe
?cause I bet you after 15 minutes, you need another 15 another 15 minutes of love

[verse]
Is about to get crazy, about to go down
Seems like you're ready for the first round
Hope you can handle what I give out
This ain't a scandal you stick around, its time now
Baby hold on to me don?t let go
Don?t act shy now, promise you will be back begging for more
I'm throwin that d as i'm doin my thang
You?re looking back like I?m crazy derange
Told you to deal told you this ain?t a game

You screamin out like you?re going insane
Oooh, finally getting what you deserve
You can breathe now givin you all of me that?s my word
Cuz baby you can get it, you can get it
Tell me just say the word and I'm gonna kill it
I?m not wasting your time, runnin my mouth sellin lines
Just sayin whats on my mind

[Chorus]
If you give me 15 minutes I?ll make you feel like a woman tonight
All I need is 15 minutes to take you on the ride of your life
Baby, all I need is 15 minutes anymore than that will kill the vibe
?cause I bet you after 15 minutes, you need another 15 another 15 minutes of love

[verse]
Time to re-up time for my second wind
Time to go in, that was just the beginnin
Baby by now you should already know
Knew what it was when you walked thru the door
Girl Lets? keep this goin all night
I promise it will be all right

[Chorus:]
If you give me 15 minutes I?ll make you feel like a woman tonight
All I need is 15 minutes to take you on the ride of your life
Baby, all I need is 15 minutes anymore than that will kill the vibe
?cause I bet you after 15 minutes, you need another 15 another 15 minutes of love

[Outro]
Do you want another 15 minutes [it dont take long when you know what your doing]
