Shorty like a precious jewel
I'll take care of you
You can put your heart right in my hands
Oh
Baby, you're like the rarest flower
I'll make sure you bloom

Baby
Just imagine if I was your man
Oh, baby
I pray to you
Breakfast in the bed
And every night I'd sing to you
No matter what it is
Before you sleep

I'll have you saying
Ooh
How did he know just what to do?
Like a radio
I'm tuned into your soul

Oooh, oh
If
If it was up to me
You know I'd fill you up with love
And make it flow like water

Stars at the sky
I'll place 'em in your eye
Oooh
Since I was a young player talking to the ladies
I just know

It's just my intuition
(I know what you like)
(Shorty, how you like it?)
I know if it possess you
I know what you feel
You can't even fight it

It's just my intuition
I know your every wish
Shorty, let me in your life
And watch me put it down
