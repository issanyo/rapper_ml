[Intro:]
(Wait a minute! Right about now!)
Jamie Foxx in this bitch
(Wait a minute)
[2 Chainz]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
The party ain't a party 'til you see me in the party
Pull up in a Maserati, it's the same color coffee
Leave there, hit the lobby, ride her like a Kawasaki
Got her sippin' on the sake, tryna pull it out the socket, uh
Pull her hair like it's tug-o-war
''Do not disturb'' sign on the door
Need to record, so I got a camcorder
I'm playing Pandora, might break her aorta

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Fresh kicks, fresh cut, bout to roll out
Pull up on the scene, pull the Roll' out
Shawty in the nipple print shirt
Is she happy to see me or is it cold out?
I got chicks in my section
I got drinks in my section
So much diamonds in my necklace
I think I'm gonna need protection

[Pre-Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Gone 'head girl, twerk it all on me
I need it for you to work it all on me
We ain't leavin' 'til the sun come up, baby
Came to do this here all night long

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party
If I leave 'em in the club, I take it straight back to the lobby
Now shawty with the booty dancin' like she wanna do me
Turn around is she bad? Damn right, I let her do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
If you bad, turn around girl, let me see you do it

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
Girl you look sexy with your clothes on
You even look better with nothin' on
And we don't ever turn down, we stays turned up
Ain't that what we here for
VIP wherever we at, tomorrow night we might relapse
So back that ass up like Juvi' cause you already know I need that

[Pre-Hook]
Gone 'head girl, twerk it all on me
I need it for you to work it all on me
We ain't leavin' 'til the sun come up, baby
Came to do this here all night long

[Hook]
Party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party
If I leave 'em in the club, I take it straight back to the lobby
Now shawty with the booty dancin' like she wanna do me
Turn around is she bad? Damn right, I let her do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
If you bad, turn around girl, let me see you do it

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
I keep her straight like a band too
I keep it straight like 12:30
I fuck over your girl hair do
If it's curly I straighten it, if it's straightened, I leave it curly
You look good standin' next to me
There ain't enough room, we need to get a suite
And if my momma had another child
Then she would've had an extra G
Fuck that, flip that, that soul
She need a pole by the stove
She cookin' eggs and she twerkin'
You might just think I'm perverted
But she ain't got on no clothes, Hootie Hoo
Exit the club to the Trump
And her back is so fat you can see from the front
And I walk in, this bitch smellin' like joints

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
I don't wanna hold your hand
Girl tonight I got other plans
I just want to see you throw it back
Back on me and let me see if I can catch all of that

[Hook]
Party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party
If I leave 'em in the club, I take it straight back to the lobby
Now shawty with the booty dancin' like she wanna do me
Turn around is she bad? Damn right, I let her do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
If you bad, turn around girl, let me see you do it

[Outro:]
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
