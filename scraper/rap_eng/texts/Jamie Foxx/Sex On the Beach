Have you ever been to South Beach, tipsy with your bottles to the sky, sky, sky
There's a widows puertoricans precious gal's got that look up on her eye
Well what you drinkin'? I'm drinkin' champagne
Well I was thinkin. What, what's your campaign?
Champagne make me tipsy, patron make me sick, attitude and vodka does the trick

Somebody pour me a sex on the beach, (that's how I like it) sex on the beach, (i wanna have) sex on the beach, (your body drive me crazy) sex on the beach, (I wanna rock)

Have you ever been to Paris with a model workin on your French?
And you let her know your ballin' and the coldest players comin off the bench
Well what you smokin'? I smoke that good shit
Across the ocean, but I'm on that hood shit
Champagne make me tipsy, patron make me sick, attitude and vodka does the trick

Somebody pour me a sex on the beach, (that's how I like it) sex on the beach, (I wanna have) sex on the beach, (your body drive me crazy) sex on the beach, (I wanna rock)

If your drinking like I'm drinking put your hands in the air
If your drinking like I'm drinking put your hands in the air
If your smoking like I'm smoking put your hands in the air
If your smoking like I'm smoking put your hands in the air
If your humping like I'm humping put your hands in the air
If your humping like I'm humping put your hands in the air
If your drinking like I'm drinking put your hands in the air
If your drinking like I'm drinking put your hands in the air

Sex on the beach, (that's how I like it) sex on the beach, (I wanna have) sex on the beach, (your body drive me crazy) sex on the beach, (I wanna rock)
