Can't believe another day goes by. Without your love, you know I can't survive. Silly me I thought I'd play it cool. But in the end I end up playing the fool. No I regret my decisions because I'm in love with you. You had come into my life and made my dreams come true. For you I'll do (Yes I will)...

(If you love me)...The time I've spent with you has been so nice. (Like you say you do)...Girl you're my angel, you're my paradise. (Won't you show me)...I need your love, girl don't you understand? (What I mean to you)... Baby the sight of you was promised me one day. Because I'm in love with you. You have come into my life and made my dreams come true. For you I'll do (My darlin')...

(I'll make the green)...grass grow in December. (grass grow..)(I'll make the...) April rain turn to snow. I'll climb the highest mountain and search the valley low. Wherever you are, that's where I'll go

(If you love me)...I need your love girl, I don't mind the change. (Like you say you do)...I'm holding on girl, I'm prepared to wait. (Then won't you show me)...For your sweet love I'll swim the deepest seas. (What I mean to you)...Just to show you what you mean to me. The sight of you was promised me one day. (Cause' I'm in love without a doubt)...Cause' I'm in love with you. (My heart's gone, can't live without)...You have come into my life and made my dreams come true. For you I'll do...

(I'll make the green)...grass grow in December.(grass grow)( I'll make the..) April rain turn into snow. I'll climb the highest mountain and search the valley low. Wherever you are, that's where I'll go

(If you need me)...Girl, if you need me...(Like I needed you)...Baby, won't you let me see...(Then whisper softly)...Bring it down...(Hear me)...(While I'm pleasing you)...Let me hear you, please baby let me hear you...(If you need me)...Fade Out
