This ones dedicated to, well you'll know if it's you
Or you, or you....

She ain't got no money in the bank
She was in Topshop ripping off the tags
She was caught on camera in TK-Maxx
Swapping them labels, stuffing clothes in bags
Look, I ain't saying she's a thief but she left Harrods escorted by Police
And ain't saying she ain't got a J-Lo be but them Jimmy Choo's cost an arm and a knee
They can't even be anything less than half of a G
I see her dine out try all the kobe beef then she was like 'I'll just have a salad'
And she'll be drinking apple juice in a champagne glass, standard
She said, 'I ain't got no manors' and she'll be in the nightclubs every night asking for me
She was raving with an empty Chrystal bottle
Bragging how her car don't start with a key
She's no young angel, so unfaithful
Every year she's on a different MOBO table
And she's a groupie she don't own no label
And she'll be knocking back your rose soon like she paid too
