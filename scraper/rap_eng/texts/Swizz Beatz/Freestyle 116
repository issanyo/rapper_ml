[Verse]

Check the way I move I never was a dirty dancer
Born in July but there’s no chemo for this type of cancer
Me and my wifey toxic for each other at times
I’m also toxic with rhymes
I get the fire working like the 4th of July it’s lit
These kids running the waves a bunch of Johnny Tsunamis
I’m more like Tom on toonami control the program
Back when elders only responded to yes and no mamm
Back when flexing was only done by the rock and Conan
Outdated references
Back when you would only judge by evidence
On if he was a pest and not a pessimist
Exterminate these niggas gotta dead their bogus rhetoric
I’m tryna break the chains but you chilling on the settlement
Groundbreaking on the sediment
I think about the OJ case and how he fell from grace but now this country tells me they don’t prejudge by race and that they learned from mistakes but now this orange juice in the face niggas is president

Tryna keep my focus together It’s like the internet’s designed
To take your mind
Off what’s important
Gotta keep a stack and weed louder than distortion
Don’t care about the fame I crack the cookie for my fortune
As they blow it out of proportion
It’s situational
Fellatio
With minorities get screwed in every ratio
Niggas priorities consist of stunting on enemies
A bitch with lock jaw and a tall glass of Hennessy
I felt like I was ahead of the curve
For every penny I earn
I’ll go and purchase some nerve
Then build my hunger off of every customer that you serve
I thought my music was the wave but every sound that you heard
Had you pressing play on nonsense that’s never been as hard as my music
I gotta wear protective gear when I do it
And niggas come with corny lines like you’ll never have this flow less you fluid
Ight I gotta admit that was hard
From battle scars
To short out every single plug because I never been the type to charge
And keep a buffet cause I never was the type to starve
They never recognize your face unless you make it
No one saved me a spot but it’s cool I rather take it
The acoustics are loud and my families proud
So people cheer my name it’s like I’m part of the crowd
I guess I finally see the reason why these women wanna do me
I’ll keep chanting my name while you echo it back to me

Say it again they over here screaming my name I tell em say it again
Say it again she over here screaming my name I tell her say it again
Niggas talk that tough shit they only say it with pens
