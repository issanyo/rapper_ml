[Swizz Beatz]
(mmm, mmmm)
See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff Ryders is a family
Ruff Ryders... Ruff Ryders... Ruff Ryders
Lets go... Swizz Beatz

[DMX]
This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit
Hittin wit the hardest Shit, cuz before we started shit
With kids I knew my fuckin' friends all turned against me
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this
He got my back I got his, schemin on mad niggas
Dats how we do bidz
It's about time to start another, robbin spree
Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump
When I was up North in
Sing-Sing I was sendin niggas home in a coffin
Livin like a orphan, you bad nigga?
I'll be back (let's) see if you'll be still here
You know my style I'll put yo fucking man, in a wheelchair
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
Thats how I left him G, scared to death of me
Niggas cannot run
Hit wit the hot one
From the shotgun
Casket close, wonder how he got done

[Eve]
Yo yo, E-V-E
My dogz believe in me
Petty thugz hide yo cake, never teasin me
I show love to, all my bitches hustlin one'z, tussle wit thieves
Makin moves, second to none, I locked it, uh
Made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit
Da blond hair bandit, you got gunz, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
Cuz I don't wear sunblock
Ask Drag if the fire is hot (Flame on, baby)
Shit pop shellz, fall three feet, roll over and stop
We warn niggas that we coming then we total the block
We scorn niggas like their mothers then we wet up their socks
Red dye, escaping on the red eye, to sea shore
Then hide out and buy out bars till we see fall
In this game, we beat y'all
You got money? Keep yours
For eyes be tearin' tryin to i-
Dentify the features!

[JadaKiss]
And you can come see me if you tryin to get some grams tonight
Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin a flight
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning wit dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of em givin me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me and get wit me
But still end up being mad cuz I charge fifty
And as for you sucka, you can keep those rapz
And screw your awardz, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shit but some things I never forget
Like if you spend three your guaranteed to make back six
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stash, took the governor off
Even the cats that be hatin still be lovin the dogs
Cause they know that the double R's comin for war
Wha

[Styles]
If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
Cuz when I start bustin the guns , you hidin the kids
And the P is still ridin with clips, survivin wit bricks
We beefin on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin dope or robbin the blocks
Starvin or not, carvin the cheek, palmin the Glock
I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice,this shit is my life
Catch me wit a 45, hot pair of Nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or give me your face
Give me a shank It's Holiday ugh
The hoopties in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggas wanna ride tomorrow when they prob'ly die today
Cause the P'll hollow the guns
Holla at sons (Sheek: I feel you nigga)
And when they go to holla back
They be swallowin' one

[Sheek]
(uh, uh, uh)
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggas and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggas that took yo leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon bust
Cause they crazy, but crazy niggas bleed like us
See I'm one shot thru the heart like Cupid
Y'all niggas might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
Its 99, I'm killings you women and kids
Fuck Scarface! Watch me, I'm more action to see
Than them motherfuckers that yall see on T.V
And fuck what you heard this how sheek get down
Comes to guns? Shit im rhyming wit one on me now
You never know what clown goin walk into the studio
Talking shit and its gonna be more than the amps that blow
I pour gas on your skin and watch your shit detatch
With a book of matches now thats when you have met your match
And the worst thing for you is to have a gun when im thirsty
I turn niggas more holy man, than Eddie Murphy
And I deal with more bricks than that city do in jersey
Yall got call cops niggas, I got autops niggas, that'll bust you and slide
And some ol 6-drop niggas
Revolver Pop niggas, Eezox niggas
Get knocked, say I smoke detox niggas
Drug program, hit the streetz and cop 56 mo gramz
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' wit the fam
And that's word!

[Drag-On]
(come on, come on, come on,)
Boy, whats the difference between fire and water?
You'd rather drown or die of torture, cause your skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo bitch a perm wit that
Keep shellz in the envelopes cuz I'll mail out bullets
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, bout a extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you
You gon do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp you gon' be crunchier than chips
Wit mah hand all up in da bag munchin on tha shit
Bit by bit clip by clip and every block by block
Is brick on brick I got knots on knots
Cause I got things that'll pop yo top
And double R spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin up, (un)less they in the wheelchair
Sittin up or spittin up, either way I don't give a fuck
