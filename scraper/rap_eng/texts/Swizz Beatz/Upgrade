[Intro]
Yessir, Three
Ha, I love this shit
So let me talk my shit, uh-huh
(Coughing)
Okay I'm good
Yeah

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I know you see the guap 'cause gettin' money is what we on
Riding drop top in the winter with the heat on
Bad yellow bitch keep my passenger seat warm
Leg hangin' out the window, you ain't got these on
Bitch, holla – It is Lil Weezy
They cannot see me, they are like Stevie
I am bearing a ton like Levy
I circle your house like B.B
Colder than the heebie-jeebies, never give freebies
Seventy-five thousand for these fees
Shit, I can get a hundred thousand up in these jeans
Big stacks, my pockets on Creatine
Young Money, Dipset, nigga, we a team
If you don't like it, nigga, fuck you, no Vaseline
(Errr!) I peel off in the Lamborghin'
Like a tangerine
Got the engine straight shaking like a tambourine
Like a bitch with some lips like Angelin–a Jolie
Holy, God flow
I go where no other guy go
Fuck you, ho, I'm so 5-0–
4, I hope every snitch die slow
Hip-Hop, that's my ho, I know
She know I like it wet, don't want no dry ho
Alright, bitch, I am the boy, no decoy
And I will straight up destroy any boy, or man
And I prefer money than bitches, or just reefer
We are Young Money, bitch, and I am the leader
He are: Curren$y, Mack Maine, and D-Raw
And I just signed a chick named Nicki Minaj
And me, I'm still spittin' like a retard
And these niggas' soft, they should be rappin' in leotards
Nigga, we in charge, Baby put me in charge
And I'm just murderin' niggas, free of charge
Ya dig? Just holla back, I see ya sarge
I'm so motherfuckin' high I can eat a star
Yeah, let me upgrade ya
You may not be a model, but I can front page ya
You know I'm nasty, excuse my behavior
Let me just taste ya, we can fuck later
Sittin' in the coupe, lookin' like a racer
Top peeled back like the skin of a potato
Seat way back, listenin' to Anita Baker
Ridin' by myself, smokin' weed by the acre
Hollygrove gator, ain't nobody greater
Leave you with some bullet holes the size of craters
You ain't heard the latest, Weezy F. the greatest
Battle anybody, nigga, fuck over your favorite
It's a new game, and I'm the coach like Avery
Leave it to the flow, we gettin' dough like the bakery
I don't really want to, but these niggas makin' me
Put a motherfucker on ice, like the Maple Leaves
That's a hockey team, and I ain't on no hockey team
But I'm a champion, where's the fuckin' Rocky theme
Damn, Rest In Peace Apollo Creed
I'm a monster, every day is Halloween
A lot of syrup, lot of pills, and a lot of weed
And I keep my pockets green like a pod of peas
And if you hatin' baby, you can get a side of deez
Deez nuts in your mouth, and can you swallow please?
Yeah, I'm so hot I freeze
Big balls, and they jangle like a lot of keys
Even deaf bitches say "Hi" to me
She tell a blind bitch and she say "I gotta see"
Young Carter, darlin'
Understand, I am Michael Jordan ballin'
Yes, I'm a dog, I'm a Hoya, homie
I'm a boss, your man's just an employer, mami

[Outro]
Let me upgrade you
Let me upgrade you
Upgrade you
Weezy
