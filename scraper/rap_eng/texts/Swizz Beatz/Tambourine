You gotta shake your ass!

E-V-E come through in the Maserati
Doin it big like I live in the Taj Mahal
Talk shit and I don't get into blazay blah

She look good always, without a doubt
Ask for her, is she back or caking out?

They be watching while we wiggle around
Look at them drooling, they ain't used to this sound

Get low, get low, then pick up, pick up
Get your hands in the air, it's a stick-up stick-up
Shake your tambourines, moving quicker, quicker

To the beat like a pro, know you love that
She can shake it to the floor, gotta love that
Get ya ass on the dance floor
