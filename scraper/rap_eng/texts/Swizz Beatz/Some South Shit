[Intro: Ludacris]
Hell yeah, A-town, LUDA
Ahh, whoo!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
She said she was a stripper but she wanted to rhyme
And if I gave her a deal she make her legs stretch back to her spine
I told her hit the treadmill, 'til she run out of time
And in the eve no doubt, she was blowin my mind
I'm from the A-town, put 'em through a GA course
Cause "it's all in the game" like EA Sports
From scams and money grams, there's unions that wanna wire me
"You think you know but really don't" - put it in your "Diary"
I'm quick to knock 'em out, they comin in three spurts
I do like Spielberg and see that yo' +DreamWorks+
My weed is all lavender, my drink is blue
My gat'll, +Poke-a-Man+, it's the Pikachu
Luda give 'em new perm, now they hair is wet
And they don't wanna get on top, cause they scared of heights
So if you Wonderwoman BITCH I'm the Wondermack pro
So shut up and gimme that Thundercat HOOOO

[Chorus 2X: Icepick Jay]
When you fuckin with Ryders, in the "R" we trust
If you make a false move then these things gon' bust
And when it comes to these bitches, you know how it goes
We don't trust these hooooes

[Fiend]
She said she won't, take it off unless there's money involved
I told y'all hold the stack and give hundred a call
I referred to when you pissy drunk, blunted and all
Tellin me she humpin harder than y'aaaall
Got got - three niggas just diggin these balls
And all three really won't see y'all
Outside, in the burgandy Bird
Ruff Rydin puffin the herb, discussin the curb
She said she from B.K
And I did it "my way, all day" like B.K., no more need say
So Fiend playa, you know I'm busy countin some cash
Then bouncin up on some ass
Better yet, think I'm on some extendable hash
You really wanna fall in ya glass
She chose me, pimp nigga like we chose to be rich
Double-R then stole ya bitch

[Chorus]

[Yung Wun]
Hah, I say you better move now for a week in Montana
Then slick 'em without drinks for I drink in Colorado
This chick yesterday said she leavin tomorrow
I'm tryin to fuck her mouth tonight cause she leavin tomorrow
The only thing she act stupid's bout my lady at home
Lie to my lady at home, got my baby at home
Man, I was on some shit like 'Kiss, is we "Fuckin' or What?"
If you don't wanna get a room, we can fuck in the truck
We can cut to a bitch, but don't piss me off
You don't mean that to me shorty, I'll piss in your mouth
I'm a violent - boy, whylin boy
Playa hater close your legs, I want no lip girl

[Chorus]
