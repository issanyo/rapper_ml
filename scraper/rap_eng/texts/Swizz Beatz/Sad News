See the story from Houston
From a little boy that was goin to the store
For his mother for some groceries at store
He had his hoodie on, yea

Mistaken identity for robbery and theft
Man they took that last boy breath

The police not guilty, the police not guilty
Even was the wrong ID police still fuckin not guilty

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Shot down for the dope and the dollar sign
I often sit and wonder could this world be mine, nah
I be lying if I said I ain't heard em
When they told me I was just a nigga
Nothing but a burden to society
They call the Ku Klux to quiet me
Wonder why I'm stuck in here reacting to it violently
They hating on me silently, my skin my sin
That when black men hear stories around my window
Staring out the back seat of my maybach benz though
Like that shit matter, while my homies and my kin folks suffer
Playin jealous hard motherfuckers, wishin they could be you
Envious, see through
I ain't scared of the boogey-man, fuck em
If Trump want war I give to him, gon buck em
America with three K's
Freedom got a shotgun
For all the homies shot down by white boys
And not one convicted
Of wrong doing, is it justice we pursuing
Freedom of death, beat em to death, fuck em
I will awake the sleeping giants, with one last word
One last nerve, me and you are not equal
It's not about the flag, change the people

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Little boy got shot down today

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
Yea we gotta liven things up
Pray for all the lost ones, lost in the battle
Lost in the battle, all the parents thats lost in the battle
And the fight they can't battle
Ban all the bad judges, ban all the bad judges
That's not giving justice
Ban all the judges that's not giving justice
