[Intro]
One dollar, two dollars, three dollars, four dollars, five dollars, six dollars, seven dollars, eight dollars
This shit is crazy man
I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do out here, man
I'm broke, I'm twisted
Can't buy no equipment or nothing
Niggas is being killed out here
Everything is going wrong, man
My mother is broke, the father is broke
What the hell am I pose' to do?
This ghetto is killing me, but I'ma make it happen
Gotta work, man
(Oh my god, they killed this guy, my man!)
Something gotta work, man
I'm only six years old, man
Can't get no worse than this
You have to run the streets and hustle, man
(These people are crazy, there's a shooting over here)
Make it happen from the self
Can't depend on no boy
Cause I represent ghetto, this is mine
I represent ghetto
I represent ghetto
I represent ghetto
I represent ghetto
I represent ghetto
I represent ghetto
