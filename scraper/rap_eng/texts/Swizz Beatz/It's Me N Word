I'll be chilling in a taxi, listening to Blackstreet
Louis V iPod holder, I'm flashy
Styles nothing fancy, guerrilla like Banksy
Run rings round these tracks like athletes
Freeze!
It's me niggas!
Big with the bars, i'm like Swiss with the cars
Make niggas do a Van Gough when niggas hear ours
Straight cut their ear off cause they can't get a deal off
One mix tape, one show knock the gears off
Tryna eat a meal off the game you know fully
I smell, I smell, I smell, pussy!
I was doing this over beats by Nookie
And this years still my year, take that to the bookies!
Oh shit, what's happened? He's back like gammon
I'm Lewis Hamilton on the track, no McClaren
Straight Van Damme 'em, fucking back hand 'em
Over crowds piece, still getting back handers
Deep like have 'em, find 'em like Prodigy
I left my label, no body's dropping me
I heard the tape too, sounds like quantum leap
Back in times, err they might as well copy me
Do shit properly, the yout dem are copping me
There's a few on the level but they're still bottom three
Straight up relegate a nigga
I'll develop your flow, I'm the renovator nigga
You be up, up and away like an elevator nigga
But my money ain't straight yo yeah I'll take your bimmer
Yeah I sense inherited, they leave you a squiller
Then I'll be chilling in your Ibiza villa
Like, peace!
It's me bitches!
