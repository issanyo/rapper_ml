[Busta Rhymes]

[Hook: Swizz Beatz (Busta Rhymes)]

I said wait...Stop the party
(I don't even gotta change my verse for this)
I don't wanna hurt nobody but!

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Shit! That's what it's comin' to!
Tell me how you want it boo!
Fuck a line nigga see me skippin' right in front of you!
Check! Trust me you don't really want it duke
Open club security and pull my niggas off of you!
Why try stop it see we primetime comin' through!
Shut it down disrespectful bitch that's what we love to do!
Check the method how I shread it there ain't nothin' new!
Actin' like the club through!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz] (Busta Rhymes) {T.I}
I said wait...Stop the party (T.I. Where you at?)
I don't wanna hurt nobody but!
{They wanna be down with the King!}

[Verse Two: T.I.]
We pull up to the club, park, hoppin' out, bouncin'
Walkin' in the door, DJ just made an announcement
King in the building, women screamin', shoutin'
Remy bottles in the hand, standin' on the couches
Me, I don't smoke, but my niggas blowin' ounces
It's hot in here, she sweatin', see her nipples through her blouse and
How can (what?!) -- I not be the hottest shit?
I'm killin' parties, body shit, hey wait a minute, stop it, Swizz

[Interlude: Swizz Beatz] (Busta Rhymes) {Cam'Ron}
I said wait!
(Aw shucks man! When the last time you heard somebody say aw shucks man?)
(Oh God what we 'bout to do here?!) {Killa!} (Where you at playboy?)
I said wait...Stop the party
I don't wanna hurt nobody but!

[Verse Three: Cam'Ron]
Uh, I'm a cyclone bull, dry-stones y'all
Want face time? Get the iPhone four
Be patient, more beef waitin'
King James the game, number one free agent
I been winnin', you been losin'
Dipset back, got the UN movin'
Movin' chips, Frito-Lay
You folks, yessir, I'm the east coast Dre

[Interlude: Swizz Beatz] (Busta Rhymes)
I said wait! (Aiyyo Ghost where you at nigga?!)
I said wait...Stop the party
I don't wanna hurt nobody but!

[Verse Four: Ghostface]
Yo! I know a couple of real killers that's Catholic
White boys that speed blacks cleanin' they ratchets
In the bloodline Osiris, I'm the only Muslim in the pool
They know I put that work in like a pirate
Jails you slap the ox in the green jello
Carvin' your face is like the sound of a sweet demo
Swiss knives intimidate Roscoe
Blood drippin' over my crisp Nike's
The streets the TECs spit like tobasco
Never sip the blue shit or pink Rose'
That's more for like pretty women, you so lame
So if you wanna get physical
Staten Island goons is in the cut
Tony Starks play the front like my genitials

[Interlude: Swizz Beatz] (Busta Rhymes) {DMX}
I said wait!
(And y'all thought I was makin' a movie already huh?)
(Welcome home dog! Aw shucks man!)
I said wait...Stop the party
{Grrrrrrrrrrrrr! Woo!}
I don't wanna hurt nobody but!
{Arf! Arf!}

[Verse Five: DMX]
I went away for a minute, it's like I'm back from the dead (Yea!)
Relapse on you niggas, and crack some heads (Aight!)
Lemme see - my plate's empty, yours is full
You suck, real talk, c'mon with the bull!
Guns clap like applause (Yea!), tap tap on the doors (Yea!)
You gon' be like, "What's that?!," all you gon' hear is Blap! thru the walls (Yea!)
I rep for the town that said 'Fuck Pataki! (Aight!)
Niggas from Clinton, Comstock and Coxsackie
