[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
And now with the following collection of the swizzy sounds...

[Refrain: Gwen Stefani]
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Chorus 1: Gwen Stefani]
Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me, now I want
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
All the stars I was reachin' for, you had in the palm of your hand
And if for just once I would let the padlock on the door be open
Well, damn it, just get on over here
This better be the best thing I ever felt
My days, they better be sunny
It better be nothing but all that I want

[Chorus 2: Gwen Stefani]
Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me, now I want
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
I'm the raddest queen of them all
I could have anyone, so what I want?
Perfect, get it right, never wrong
So you gonna step it up, or you gonna be gone?
(Not like the rest) not this
(Nothing is typical) ain't nothing is typical
(This is not a test) no test
(This is a for sure) it's all gotta be for sure

[Chorus 2: Gwen Stefani]
Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me, now I want
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Verse 3: (Swizz Beatz) & Gwen Stefani]
(Yo Gwen, whatcha make 'em do?)
Well, I'd train him like a Marine Corps
Boot camp, make him like a superhero (Yes ma'am)
That always better be his response
Or I don't give a dog a bone up
Attention! Show me your skeletons, let's not play games
We can be closer than sharing last names (Gimme my award)
The award is a purple heart, it could be yours
If you earn that medal, yeah, you could be my boy

[Interlude: Gwen Stefani]
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh

[Chorus 3: Gwen Stefani]
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Refrain: Gwen Stefani]
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
