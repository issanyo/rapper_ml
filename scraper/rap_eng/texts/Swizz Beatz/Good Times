[Intro: Tiny Boost]
DJ Play special (I get high, I get high, I get high)
PYG (I get high, I get high)

It's nothing, leave it how we play it (I get high on your memory, high on your memory, high on your memory)

[Chorus: Tiny Boost]
(I get high, high, high) Every day
(I get high, high, high) Every night
(I get high, high, high) All the time
(I get high, high, high) Every day
(I get high, high, high) Every night
(I get high, high, high) All the time
(I get high, high, high, high, high) Get high all day

[Verse 1: Tiny Boost, Shockz]
I get high 'cause I love the zone
I love it like when, enemies die when I bust my chrome
Yo Play is a big hit
That nigga's gonna run it on the roads like we just copped the creme piff (Piff)
Niggas saying that we smoke too much (Nah)
Bun that, crush the [?] start billing, no roach it up
You know the taste when I bun the filly (Filly)
And when it comes to rolling up, niggas can't fuck with T (React)
Some days I ain't puffed up shit
So when it gets real, I ain't really on that puff puff deal (Nah)
I keep it Pecky when I'm blowing them O's (Pecknarm)
So niggas try it when I'm buzzed you can get your whole head domned

[Chorus: Tiny Boost]
(I get high, high, high) Every day
(I get high, high, high) Every night
(I get high, high, high) All the time
(I get high, high, high) Every day
(I get high, high, high) Every night
(I get high, high, high) All the time
(I get high, high, high, high, high) Every night

[Verse 2: Shockz]
Shockz (Shockz)
Got the piff and the flipping scales (SI, SI, SI)
Copped me a blue skin Riz and copped me a chip as well
Fuck about my flipping health
They're like, Shockz calm down you know you got sickle cell
Crumbling that potent shit (potent)
Hand that shit over, make a nigga roll that quick (roll that)
I ain't messing with no roachless spliff,  'cause I don't want a situation where it's stuck up in my throat and shit
Now I got me a piff green
This is a puff puff give situation so make sure your lips clean
But you gotta go, buy me the Riz
'Cause the shopkeeper going on about I'm only 16 (haha)

[Chorus: Tiny Boost, Shockz]
(I get high, high, high) Every day
(I get high, high, high) Every night
(I get high, high, high) All the time
(I get high, high, high) Every day
(I get high, high, high) Every night
(I get high, high, high) All the time
Nah, oi Viz tell these guys I'm 16 (I get high, high, high, high, high) Every night
