[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and Gentlemen
I'm here to tell you that this is a brand new sound
This will change your lives
All you gotta do is turn your shit up
All you gotta do is turn your shit up
It's what you want
It's what you need
It's what you get
It's what you like
It's the Dirty Money

[Verse 1: Grace Jones]
Could've been your everything
Could've been your shooting star
Could've been your backbone
But now I'm too far away
You wouldn't be there alone
My love wouldn't be at home
We wouldn't be staring out the window
Guessing which way the wind blows

[Hook: Grace Jones]
You would be here loving me, holding me
Treating me better than before
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
You're just so damn selfish, nervous and jealous
You would be here loving me, yeah you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Yeah, come on, oh, who was your number one?
Who had niggas at the alter wearing fuchsia gators and cummerbunds
Got my hand on my gun
As I'm sittin', drinkin' and thinkin' I love you, you should've had my son
Got me losin' my mind
All alone in my room, starin' at your picture like I'm doin' time
I know lovin' me's hard
But the further you are, I wait got me closer to God

[Verse 3: Grace Jones]
Sex could've been greater
If I was the only one, wouldn't be your mistress?
But now I'm too far to play (too far to play)
Now you take the blame alone
Love wouldn't be free to roam
We would be prisoners of the sheets, baby I'll your capture

[Hook]
You would be here loving me, holding me
Treating me better than before
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
You're just so damn selfish, nervous and jealous
You would be here loving me, yeah you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would

[Bridge: Grace Jones]
All I wanted was your lovin'
You keep tellin' me, you wouldn't be happy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You wouldn't let me ruin my heart

[Outro: Grace Jones]
Honey, this is, oh, so good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
You would be loving me, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
