(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Now ever since I could remember I been poppin my collar
Poppin poppin my collar, Poppin poppin my collar
Ever since I could remember I been working this hoes
And they betta put my money in my hand

(DJ Paul)
Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery
Alot of dudes swear they play man they some fackery
Let me catch a girl up out some work in mah site
And believe I'm gon be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryin to get paid however money is made
Alot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model fa real

(Juicy J)
Well you know me by the Juice man hangin out with Big Keith
Standin on tha porch, drinkin liquor, drunk, smokin weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet
Thats why I stay in a girl ear to keep that pussy wet
So I could get paid and relax in the shade
And say fuck a nine to five cuz a nigga tired of slavin
It's never easy for a playa in tha hood on tha come up
If I meet a gal with three kids or more she get done up

(Chorus)
(Crunchy Black)
She's just another hoe that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well go on head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper something in her ear if I could
I got some hoes out there bringin ya boy back some good
That ghetty green you know what I mean that bitch is understood
Ain't havin to shout at no motherfuckin slut
You know I'm actin bitch make cut a fuckin rug
You better get out there and get my money in the woods
I'ma hit cha in ya head and leave ya ass with a plug
You know I gotta have, gotta get my money what
These hoes out here be fucking for a muthafucking dub, FREAK BITCH!

(Chorus)
