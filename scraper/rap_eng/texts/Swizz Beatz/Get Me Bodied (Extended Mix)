[Verse 1]
Mission one; I'ma put this on
When he see me in the dress, I'ma get me some (Hey)
Mission two; gotta make that call
Tell him get the bottles poppin' when they play my song (Hey)
Mission three; got my three best friends
Like we do it all the time, we gon' do it again (Hey)
Mission four; got the vintage Rolls
Drop a couple hundreds tell him "Leave it at the door"

[Chorus]
I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (Hey)
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance
Wanna be myself tonight, get me bodied

[Verse 2]
Mission five; skip to the front of the line
Let me fix my hair up 'fore I go inside (Hey)
Mission six; gotta check these chicks
'Cause you know they gon' block when I take these flicks (Hey)
Mission seven; gotta make my rounds
Givin' eyes to the guys, now I think I found him (Hey)
Mission eight; now we conversate
And we can skip small talk, let's get right to the chase (Hey)

[Chorus]
I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You should see my body
I gotta know enough to know if you can get me bodied
I'm kinda tight, I'm feelin' right, enough to see somebody
I wanna let it off tonight
Wanna dance, wanna party
Wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Won't you sing my body
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance
Wanna be myself tonight, me bodied

[Verse 3]
Baby, all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worries, oh
We can dance all night
Get me bodied
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body's touching my body
All I need is to let it be
Ain't no worry, no
Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
Don't stop, just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
With your body touching my body
Get somebody
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, let me work on you

[Chorus]
I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (Hey)
