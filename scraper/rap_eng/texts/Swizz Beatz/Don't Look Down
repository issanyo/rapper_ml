[Intro]
Woo! You know that thing, that love thing
Make me wanna say, "Oh, look down"
Oh, oh...

[Verse 1]
It breaks my heart up every time
That I think about what you told me that night
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No way I can escape what's in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, that's the way love goes
Ooh, it takes you up, it takes you down
Got you going all around
Oh, that's the way our love goes
Open up your mind now don't be blind
I know baby you'll be fine

[Chorus]
There is no limit to how high we can go
If we don't look down
Don't live in the limits
Let's go higher and higher
Don't look down

[Verse 2]
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Baby, nothing's broken as it seems
Gotta find a way to let it flow (oh oh)
I know that there's a higher place to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, that's the way love goes
Baby, if it's real, then here's the biz
Gotta accept it how it is
Oh, that's the way our love goes
Open up your mind now don't be blind
I know baby you'll be fine

[Chorus]
There is no limit to how high we can go
If we don't look down
Don't live in the limits
Let's go higher and higher
Don't look down

[Bridge]
Oh, see we cannot let go
And there's no looking down
When you walk on the tightrope
Gotta keep your eyes on the highest rise of love
You don't have to worry
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Just keep your eyes above
1, 2, 3, sing

[Chorus]
There is no limit to how high we can go
If we don't look down
(There's no limits looking up)
Don't live in the limits
Let's go higher and higher
Don't look down
(Don't look down, don't look down, baby)
There is no limit to how high we can go
If we don't look down
(You've got to keep your head up)
Don't live in the limits
Let's go higher and higher
I'm telling you don't look down
