I'm in the hood bouncin, sprayin like a fountain
Money like a mountain, tell me why ya poutin?

It's like bump bump bump bump bump, you know the block is bumpin
Fiends on the corner, man you know the block is bumpin
Speakers in your trunk, shit thumpin
They playin my song, people is jumpin
Now, we got a little block party y'all
It ain't nothin but Henny and Bacardi y'all
Sittin on the stoop, on the milk crate
How you livin life? Fuck it, say great (great!)
Y'all came from nothin into somethin
Why these niggas hatin? Why these niggas frontin?
We just ridin with our tops down
Niggas actin crazy, somebody got shot now

(Chorus:)
Ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I'm just gettin my hood on

(Verse 3:)
This chick said "Swizz, I wanna ride in ya Viper!"
I said "Hell naw, don't you know that's a Spyker?"
Number 2, out of only 20 in the world
You sit in my seat, ch-ch-change your world
I'm fresh to death, like a million bucks
Threw on my Louis hat, put my fuckin Guc' chucks
Stepped out the Bender, bitch said "Oh no!"
I said "Easy chick, you know I gotta go"

(Chorus:)
Ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I'm just gettin my hood on
I'm just, I'm just doin my thing
I'm just, I'm just do doin my thing
Heey (yep), hey (yep)
Heey (yep), hey
I said I'm ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I'm just gettin my hood on

Wherever you are, shine!
