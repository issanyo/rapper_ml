[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Goddamnit
Let this shit knock

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I done turned Havana to Atlanta
Guayabera shirts and bandanas
Every time you think they got me I switch the plan up
Bulletproof this, radio scanners
Ballin' 'til they ban us
You gettin' too much bread, they try to jam you
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents
Politicians never did shit for me
Except lie to me, distort history
Wanna give me jail time and a fine
Fine, let me commit a real crime
I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets
Hear the freedom in my speech
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free
Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb
I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt
Obama said "chill, you gonna get me impeached"
But you don't need this shit anyway
Chill with me on the beach

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Y'all gon' learn today

[Verse 2: Common]
Common Sense
My man went to Cuba
Caught in a political triangle, Bermuda
The same way they said she was the shooter
Assata Shakur, they tried to execute her
I went to Cuba to see her
We should free her, like we should Mumia
Can’t a nigga rap and make movies
Y’all see that Fox News tried to do me
They say I’m too black like it’s lights out
Might not get invited back to the White House
Still with the Obamas, I ride
I meet the president on the Southside
March the streets, parade for peace
Shorties keep shooting, they need a release
Trying to eat in the belly of the beast
I call her LeBron, they carrying the heat
Y’all gon’ learn today
Like you’re listening to Malcolm and MLK
Media saying shit that ain’t there
But we fall down and get back up, Kevin Ware
It’s so political, I don’t trust figures
When it comes to revolution, this is us nigga

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Y'all gon' learn today

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Ya'll almost want to start a revolution
You know whenever I'm threatened, I start shooting (BANG!)
Catch a body, head to Houston
I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans
This communist talk is so confusing
When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using
Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music
You're an idiot, baby, you should become a student
Oh, you gonna learn today
Where the fuck have you been
The world's under new management
The new role model, fuck this Zoolander shit

[Hook]
