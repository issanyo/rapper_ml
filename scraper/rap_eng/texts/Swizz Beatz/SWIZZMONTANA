[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Woo, oh, damn
Hands in the air
I set it up
Oh, let it work
Fire, fire

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Wait, I see a whole lot of frontin'
A whole bunch of talkin', doin' a whole bunch of nothin'
Get 'em, trance, oh
Wait, I see a whole lot of frontin'
A whole bunch of talkin', doin' a whole bunch of nothin'
Get 'em, I let it work, non-stop
I let it work, non-stop
Everybody talkin' 'bout they want this money
But when you get that money, everybody actin' funny
Fuck 'em, I let it work, non-stop
I let it work, non-stop
Rest in peace to B.I.G
P.A.C. from LA to NYC
We get it

[Post-Chorus: French Montana]
New York, New York, smokin' that la-la-la
Crept up in the place with that ra-ta-ta
Cali, Cali, smokin' that la-la-la
Snuck up in the place with that ra-ta-ta

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Hee-hee-hee-hee-how, hee-hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-how
I just wish my nigga Chinx was here to see me now
Ask about them ladies, got my number on redial
See me on your TV, on my wrist is VV down
Gotta say my name when you come to the city now
Couldn't afford no Fiji water, we in Fiji now
Pardon me, ah, ah, block still a part of me
South Bronx, mic check, one, two, it started me
Marc Buchanan to Marc Cuban, nigga
From cameras to cannons, all shootin', nigga

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Wait, I see a whole lot of frontin'
A whole bunch of talkin', doin' a whole bunch of nothin'
Get 'em, trance, oh
Wait, I see a whole lot of frontin'
A whole bunch of talkin', doin' a whole bunch of nothin'
Get 'em, I let it work, non-stop
I let it work, non-stop
Everybody talkin' 'bout they want this money
But when you get that money, everybody actin' funny
Fuck 'em, I let it work, non-stop
I let it work, non-stop
Rest in peace to B.I.G
P.A.C. from LA to NYC
We get it

[Post-Chorus: French Montana]
New York, New York, smokin' that la-la-la
Crept up in the place with that ra-ta-ta
Cali, Cali, smokin' that la-la-la
Snuck up in the place with that ra-ta-ta (Hands in the air)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Bridge is over, bridge is over
Block full of timberwolves
In the kitchen, help my man with soda
Before Snoop kicked the building over
Had the dot 6 Rover, way before you heard of Hova
Piguets flow, respect though, my neck glow
Frankie Beverly, Maze, before I let go
This type of money get you right off of murder one
On the yacht, frame CÃŽROC when the verdict come
Frank Thomas, Franck Mueler, Frank Lucas
Franks to jewelers, movies, Jews with Kufis

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Wait, I see a whole lot of frontin'
A whole bunch of talkin', doin' a whole bunch of nothin'
Get 'em, trance, oh
Wait, I see a whole lot of frontin'
A whole bunch of talkin', doin' a whole bunch of nothin'
Get 'em, I let it work, non-stop
I let it work, non-stop
Everybody talkin' 'bout they want this money
But when you get that money, everybody actin' funny
Fuck 'em, I let it work, non-stop
I let it work, non-stop
I let it work, non-stop
