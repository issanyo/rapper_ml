[Intro] It's showtime!

[Hook]
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walkin round actin all stank
Now she at the party lookin at me
Hopin she could get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl
She got her hand open like I'm finna pay that girl

[Verse 1]
Now... what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be ballers? Shot-callers? Brawlers?
Give me your number I bet she 'gon call ya
Come on dog she want you to spoil her

Anything is good ccause it's better than she had
She sittin at the bar and she's lookin so sad

[Verse 3]
It's started out soft and warm
Don't get excited I've been invited to the quiet storm
And, now it's out of hand cause she told me she hate me
And then she said what the hell I done lately
First she said all she need is love and affection
Let me be your angel, and I'll be your protection
Took her out bought her all kinds of things
But it wasn't enough, so this the song I sing cause she broke

[Hook]
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walkin round actin all stank
Now she at the party lookin at me
Hopin she could get saved by me

I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl
She got her hand open like I'm finna pay that girl
