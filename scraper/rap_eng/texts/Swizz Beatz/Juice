[Chorus]
Ayy, when it's real, only money change
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much drip, too much clout
Too much sauce
Haan, ayy

[Verse 1]
I be foolin’ with my hooligans that rule [?]
Big rocks, spaceship, superstars (star)
Actin' like they want smoke, we got hookah bars (bars)
Actin' like he movin’ pills, couldn't hoop at all (all)
Standin' on sofas, diamonds like chandeliers ('lier)
And she on X like Trisha from the Cavaliers ('lier)
Slaughter victims, water whippin', they tat a tear (tear)
Fuck the system, ice be drippin', I'm debonair
I told ’em from the door, I’m good with the dope (dope)
They was talkin' fast (fast), I was beggin’ slow (slow)
Niggas made it rain (rain), Montana made it snow (snow)
I'm talkin' wooden grain (grain), on my Pimp C flow, haan

[Chorus]
Ayy, when it's real, only money change
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much drip, too much clout
Too much sauce
Haan, ayy

[Verse 2]
From the block to the mils, man what the fuck they thought?
Got a big money scheme, we ain’t ever gettin' caught (caught)
Right behind me is a slammer and the big boy Phantom (Phantom)
With that d-boy grammar, get my dope from Atlanta
Talkin' Cuba Cabana, stay low from the scammers (scammers)
Stay schemin' for real, stay low from the scanners
Rock with me, get some money asap (haan)
Went ghost twice, that's a Maybach (skrrt, skrrt)
Kimbo Slice, wanna [?] slap (haan)
She don't let me fuck her friends, man I hate that (haan)
I'll never let her go (no), I'll never let her go (no)
You love your baby mama (what), you'll never let her go (Montana!)

[Chorus]
Ayy, when it's real, only money change
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much drip, too much clout
Too much sauce
Haan, ayy

[Outro]
Juice, sauce
Juice, sauce
Juice, sauce
Juice, sauce
When it's real, only money change
