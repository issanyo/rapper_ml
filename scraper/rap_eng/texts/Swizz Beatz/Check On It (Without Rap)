Ohh boy, you looking like you like what you see

Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

[Verse 1]
If you got it, flaunt it, boy, I know you want it
While I turn around, you watch me check up on it
Oohhh you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin', you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin', I might let you have it
You think that I'm teasin', but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you
