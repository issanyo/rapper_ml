[Swizz Beatz]
Chillin' in my Beemer, listenin' to "Ether"
Bumpin through ya speakers, know I got the heaters
Rockin' dont stop, I get the rockin' don't stop
I'm bangin' 'em beats, you know I like that hip hop, stop

FREEZE
You know who it is... it's me, bitches!

Smoke good, eat good, drink good, fuck good
Come into the club stuntin li-ike you should
My shit on fire I dont need no gasolina
I'm comin through your block with the deuce 2 seater
Ring the alarm, man, call me the sand man
When I drop beats, im the one man band man
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the money, dolla dolla bills ya'll (fuck em)

FREEZE
You know who it is...it's me bitches!

Vida loco, flyin' through popo
See me in that 4 door, that Bentley esporta
Benz all lethal, my rims so lethal
You front, I'mma I'ma shoot that ass like a free throw
Sniffin that yayo, trying to be Sosa
Trying to act tough when that's some black chocha
I ain't gotta shoot ya, I could just choke ya
You trying to make dollar, I could just show ya

FREEZE
You know who it is... it's me, bitches!
Chillin' in my Beamer, listenin' to "Ether"
Bumpin' through ya speakers, know I got the heaters
Rockin' don't stop, I get the rockin' don't stop
I'm bangin' 'em beats, you know I like that hip hop, stop

FREEZE
You know who it is... it's me, bitches!
