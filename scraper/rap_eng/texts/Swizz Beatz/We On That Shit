[Eve]
Aiiyight now getcha gunz
Ain't no stoppin' me
Need the whole cash bundle fo' me an' mah bitches' shoppin' spree
The robbery, damn ya smart, and you guessed right
Asking all those questions gonna set you up frightened
Wet 'em all, pretend I'm Jada, let 'em set it off
Cartier, Rolley, time frozen get 'em all
Dingling medallions, all that glistens is mine
And all that bitchin' that you doin' got'cha kissin' this nine
Y'all niggas, worse than bitches, tears in yo' eyes
I ain't got no sympathy so if you scared, nigga cry
On yo' knees, face in chest, lips shut
Fuck the mask, we robbin' y'all in lipstick and wigs, what?
Yeah we brawl, but you took me out and let me see it all
Braggin' 'bout the shit you got and now I get it all
Matter of fact, take yo' clothes off, I like it when they bare
Everything from iceberg to silk Dolce underwear, come on

[Chorus- P. Killer Tracks]
Hey yo check that nigga cause we on that shit
Get out your ride fool cause we on that shit
Hid your stash box cause we on that shit
Run that ice cause we on that shit
Keep a loaded clip cause we on that shit
Ryde or die nigga cause we on that shit
We out to get it all cause we on that shit
And Eve don't play cause she takes no shit

[Eve]
Uh, yo, yo, yo
I shoot backin' out, P max 'em out
Only way I don't get shit is if you stash the house
Professional bitches, destined for riches and precious jewels
Distracted by the size of mah ass, had you fooled
I ain't gettin' nada, forget that
Just sit back and watch me take everything even yo' drough sack
Yeah mah bitch can roll it, smoking while we pack
Expensive paintin's on yo' wall, gimme dat
Ain't no slackin', time ain't a factor
I'mma get it all
Used to ball wit ya niggas, now I'm makin' you crawl
Across the flo', ego crushed and I don't give a fuck
Small change to the range, heard what I said, give it up
I know it ain't right, but me and mah bitches gotta eat
Tonight and every night from now on, get it right
Why, why ask why? I'm simply livin'
And I get what I want by simply takin' or you simply givin'

[Chorus- P. Killer Tracks]
Hey yo check that nigga cause we on that shit
Get out your ride fool cause we on that shit
Hid your stash box cause we on that shit
Run that ice cause we on that shit
Keep a loaded clip cause we on that shit
Ryde or die nigga cause we on that shit
We out to get it all cause we on that shit
And Eve don't play cause she takes no shit

[Eve]
Y'all niggas faggottish
Cops spot me got me runnin' out mah kicks
I got ice pieces on mah neck and wrist
Screechin' in the streets from the five series to a ditch
I'm fast, he'd have to waste it and I ain't scared to blast
Duckin', jumpin' ova shit, bet this bitch could last
Ready for war, act like I ain't done this shit before
Practice on me next week, I'll be wantin' more
Best believe you ain't gon' live to see tomorrow
My dogs already warned yo' mother, she'll be full of sorrow
Bustin' through the do', somebody's house, kids screamin'
I ain't gonna front somehow I wish that I was sleepin', dreamin'
Too late it's done now, all you hear is gun soundz
Cock back, POP! POP! POP! and I'm like what now
Ghetto bird on me, weavin' through the trees
Last fence I hopped over, fell and landed on mah knees
Barrels at mah temple, fuck it I'mma make it simple

[Chorus- P. Killer Tracks]
Hey yo check that nigga cause we on that shit
Get out your ride fool cause we on that shit
Hid your stash box cause we on that shit
Run that ice cause we on that shit
Keep a loaded clip cause we on that shit
Ryde or die nigga cause we on that shit
We out to get it all cause we on that shit
And Eve don't play cause she takes no shit
