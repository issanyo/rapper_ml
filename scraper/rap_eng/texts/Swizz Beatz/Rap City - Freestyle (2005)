[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2
We got Cassidy the problem in the buildin'
We brought Cassidy the problem in the buildin'
Y'all 'bout to have a little problem in the buildin'
Y'all 'bout to have a little problem in the buildin'
The hustler make his way up in the buildin'
The hustler make his way up in the buildin'

[Verse: Cassidy & Swizz Beatz]
Yeah
Narcotics, you want it, come get it I got it for cheap
Most of the money that I got man I got in the streets
I'm hot as a beach, I'm a beast when I hop on the beats
Poppin' your teeth will get you rocked when I'm poppin' the piece
Man my dogs off the chain, we poppin' the leash
The four pop like pork chops when it drop in the grease
I ate french fries in France, went shopping in Greece (Get 'em)
And I could spend like ten grand just coppin' some sneaks (Get 'em)
If you thought that I was hot, start watching for 'Ney (Get 'em)
You don't want no parts of me man or the Larsiny fam (Get 'em)
The boy fly, the doors rise when I'm parkin' the lam (Get 'em)
And the whores I hypnotize with the sparkler hand (Get 'em)
I'm a baller y'all, Audemars with the sparklin' band (Get 'em)
Plush minks, five thousand for my cuff links (Get 'em)
You must think that it's nice and sweet
'Til the chrome split your dome to the light skin meat
Coward (woooo, wooooo)
