[Intro]
Grit your teeth
DMX
Ruff Ryders

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
La familia
If it ain't about the dog, we ain't feelin' ya
A lot of rappers been soft for a long time
'Bout to put the hoodie on dog all times
They said pain is back
I said, naw, Bain is back
The Dark Knight blitzing with the hoodie on
Listen, I'll come through your block
Make all your niggas really missing
(Where they at?)
Where they at now?
You want that real shit, don't 'cha?
You want that street shit, don't 'cha?

[Verse 1: DMX]
Man, cats nowadays be spittin' that fuck shit
Bird ass niggas spittin' that duck shit
I'm from the old school and that there we don't fuck with
Been locked down on lockdown so you suck a dick
Four ways to get in when you fit in: floor, chair
Before you climb the ladder try to find the stairs
Just the go-getters, flow spitters
That roll with us are gorillas
Cold killers that blow triggers
You got niggas, but my niggas know your niggas
And what my niggas know 'bout your niggas, they ho niggas
Oh no niggas, and I call 'em "oh no niggas" 'cause the last thing them bitches said was, "oh no" nigga
You're about to go, nigga
And the last thing your people heard was
"Amen from the past and release the birds"
We gonna' end it with the word, may God rest his soul
And though it looks like he's sleeping, to the touch he's cold

The Dark Knight blitzing with the hoodie on
Listen, I'll come through your block
Make all your niggas really missing
Where they at now?
You want that real shit, don't 'cha?
You want that street shit, don't 'cha?

[Verse 2: DMX]
Gimme the second chance, so respect the stance
You plan to go reckless and you make reckless plans
So, respect that we can dance
Bitch ass nigga
Motherfuck you and your man, we can do it with the hands
Fuck I need a gun for?
I done fucked a lot of bitches already
So when it come to pussy you just one more
Hit 'em with the 'what for'
That's when you know a nigga's a bitch and he's still gonna' get the hand, but you like, "What for?"
Really? You want more?
I come through with the click, click boom - click, click, boom
Put it through your front door
Brains on the wall like paint
'cause I don't need to know what it is as long as I know what it ain't
Ain't a fuckin' thing fake about me
The devil spent so much time ruining my life
What would the snake do without me?
Keep running your fucking mouth and see what happens to niggas that keep running they fucking mouth
They get knocked the fuck out, nigga

You want that street shit, don't cha'?

[Outro: DMX (talking)]
Real niggas recognize real niggas man
A real nigga ain't gonna go through the trouble of trying a real nigga
Cuz he know a real nigga will get down just like he get down
And he don't want that headache
He'd rather push up on a soft ass nigga
He spot a bitch nigga from a mile away
And carry 'em just like, know what I mean?
