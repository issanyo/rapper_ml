[Hook: Swizz Beatz & ScHoolboy Q]
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy
Na-na-na na-na na-na

[Verse: KUZGUN]
I'm living paradise as a walking paradox
Sell the devil's lettuce as I pray to God
The poster boy for greed and recklessness
But greed and recklessness gets you G's and hella checks
God don't see the hell in men
Smile as I wave while I hope to see the evil in hell with them
Nancy Reagan's Frankenstein
Since the days it was just 16's, Detroit Lions, '08-'09

[Verse : Gamemast15r]
Put the chrome plate to you're dome mind
I elevate to higher planes with my .45
It didn't matter who you were, fuck you're co-sign
Cause every illegal action we do is cause you're a gold mine
I pray that the lord forgive me
I'll never forgive myself, my future is up shit's creek
I'll go out shooting, got the pistol in the dresser droor
Dreams of chasing dollars that'll always be less, nevermore

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
They say I was a wanted man, a wanted man
Runnin' with my gun in hand, gun in hand
They don't wanna see the wanted man, the wanted man
Comin' through with the gun in hand, the gun in hand
Damn
Lord have mercy
