Are you ready?
It's your girl Estelle
This album's for my people
Gonna be a struggle
But ya know what
Fuck it
We're gonna have fun tonight
You feel me?

Oh this is my song
I'm just like you
I gotta fight to stay strong
Just cause it clears
It don't mean that it's over
I'm a shine
While my lights on

I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on

When the lights go down
What you know about me?
What you know
Is what I choose to let you see
But I'm from London
Call me the Big Ben
I grew up in west
Specifically West Kendall
Now let me slow it down
A little bit so you can feel me
Cause where I'm from there
Wasn't xxxx to do
No not really
Who'da thought
That it would happen
This London chick start rappin
Now American boys are chattin
All about me with my wicked accent
And yes I stays on my grind
You go get yours I'll get mine
Don't worry bout it
I'm fine
Cause I'm a shine
Say it

Oh this is my song
I'm just like you
I gotta fight to stay strong
Just cause it clears
It don't mean that it's over
I'm a shine
While my lights on

I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on
Ya don't know
What my hate is baby
9 kids in the yard
It was kinda crazy
Still
No kids thus far myself
I'm scared of the pain
I might not do well as a mom
Still the work gets done
Yes I worry bout bills
But a change gonna come
I wanna play rapper
Rock the bells
But I only gotta stack
For the little estelza
You don't wanna know
Bout them days that go
I got pain overload
You don't wanna know
About the things I know
I just can't take no more
Most of the time
Though I gotta stay on
I gotta stay real
I gotta stay strong
You know I'm heavy
Cause I roll with gem
So I'm gonna be fresh
When the lights come on
Come on

Oh this is my song
I'm just like you
I gotta fight to stay strong
Just cause it clears
It don't mean that it's over
I'm a shine
While my lights on

I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on

Everybodys watching tonight
It's my time
While the lights on
Everything I wanted is mine
Imam shine

Oh this is my song
I'm just like you
I gotta fight to stay strong
Just cause it clears
It don't mean that it's over
I'm a shine
While my lights on

I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on

I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
I'm a shine
While my lights on
