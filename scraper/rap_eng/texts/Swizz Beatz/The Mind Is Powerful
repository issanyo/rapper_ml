[Intro: Fats Gonder]
So now ladies and gentlemen this is star time
Are you ready for star time?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Life of the rich and gorgeous
Someone gonna be forging it
I told my dad I would have been aborted
If I wasn't the one that put the cord in
Pulling up in something looking foreign
Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit
Now I get the order
Thumbing thumbing through my wallet
Automatic toilet, now that's the shit
Popping off with the orbit, I got ya bitch
Let it go

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God damn
Don't you play no

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let me fix my neck, chain on
Let me fix the check, games on
Let me thump a thump game on
And ain't nobody playing with him no
Summertime rain with him no
They all layin' with him now
So I got the Marvin Williams with him now
No one wanna pray with him no
Want it done bathe in it now
Wanna get a raise with him now
Something down in nah-ney with em now
Like we always
Talk to me like we always
The illuminati
Dirt Bike or a Kawasaki
Bottle up on a new party

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God dammit
Don't you play with you

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Oh you been
Something I can you bitch
Only one and they don't forget
[?] we bout to get
Yeah I walk
Pop sampling
Hold on
Fall out all about
What y'all about

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God dammit
Don't you play with you

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
With your praying hands
For you lil' niggas I'm way advanced
And I don't write rhymes, I write tattoos
And when I die they build statues
You niggas ain't got the cashews
From the city where cash rules
Till they run up on a bad mood
Bitch that's a bad move
Bitch get out the way
Someone gonna get out today
And I know I was gone for a minute
But need to get out today
Now let us get this money
Sell it for [?] if I want to

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God dammit
Don't you play with you

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Don't play boy
Someone [?] what you made boy
Hoppin in the mansion
Waking around with a robe on
I could have started play boy
Cause I married a playmate
[?]
When you stay eight
And they rate
[?]
I kinda want the nudes
Something for when I'm in that mood
Woo
