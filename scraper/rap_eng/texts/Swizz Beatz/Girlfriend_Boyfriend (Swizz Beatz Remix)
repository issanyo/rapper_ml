Hello, can I can see you tonight?

[Teddy]
Naw, my girlfriend loves me
I know she does

Whoa, ha ha
Oh you provide the mil
So I shut up my grill
Don't speak on none of that shit that I hear
You ain't dealing with no silly chick
Who keep it hush-hush
Cause you give me shit, yeah uh-huh
If I ever catch you with a trick chick
Call a seamstress, tell her to pick up your dick
I make no threats, I make promise boo
And for the record I do love you, ha

[Blackstreet]
Girlfriend, it's like that
Hang up on a nigga when he calls you back
I knew she was a gold digga
I knew she like jiggy niggas
But I'm not tryin' to kick it with her
Girlfriend, on the phone
She call me all day on her telephone
Blowing up my beeper cause she's ready to bone
Played me close, won't leave me alone

1 - [Blackstreet]
Girlfriend, if we made love tonight
Will it ever be alright
Whisper in your ear, kiss your lips
Massage you back and rub your hips

Boyfriend, if we made love tonight
Will it ever be alright
Whisper in your ear, count your chips
Out of town trips when I push the six

Boyfriend, boyfriend
It's the peanut butter
Come and get you supper
I wanna be the only one in your life
Hot piece, I gotta be your wife
Forget about the girlfriend on the phone
Calling all day on the telephone
Blowing up your beeper cause she's ready to bone
Played you close, won't leave you alone

Repeat 1

[Sauce Money]
You want a playa in the crib
On lock down
Slow your roll, you just got down
See you don't know the half
I'm too hot now
Sauce Money, I can't stop now
Time to clock now
Throw the stack up
Burn the block down
Fools get clapped up
Meet me in Chi, Cal
I know you act up
Heard a Rockwiler
Let me show you, back up

You need to listen nigga when I speak
Don't be fooled
Cause I'm mad and I bought ten this week
I ain't puttin' up with you and them freaks
Keep trickin' with them bitches when you know their mouths bleed
If fool got wrecked it's straight to me
I'm your girl's, your chance, girls dying to meet
Ain't no chick breathin', saying nothin' to me
You better cut that shit out
Before you cry 1-2-3

Repeat 1 (2x)
