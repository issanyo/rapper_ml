[Intro: Sheek Louch]
Ugh
You know we had to do this right
Hugh Hugh
You know we had to do this right
Hugh Hugh
It just wouldn't be right

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo I'mma b-boy standin in my b-boy stance
Glock on my hip as big as the dick in my pants
You don't want nothing with Sheek you soft as fuck
I leave a single shotgun shell on top of your truck
Wit a horseshoe to let you know you pressin' ya luck
You don't want nuttin wit kiss, nuttin wit styles
You don't wanna end up food for the crocadiles
I'd take the gun off ya waste and smack ya
And turn around and point it at ya mink and give you one
I'm the reason why ya peeps not in ICU
Cause believe me when you ain't watchin I see you
From the Hamptons to the place where you like to eat
I put somethin in them yams you keep thinkin is sweet
I'm in the bushes all night calm wit' the Tommy
Waitin for you to skinny dip wit' that mommy
While she waitin' for the night, I'm waitin' for her flight

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo if you should die tonight
It's cause I said peel his cap
We on Ruffryders now
How real is that
It's the kiss of death everybody know J- face
Us gettin off similar to OJ's case
Just better rhymes and better beats involved
Less politics more of the streets involved
Things always go smooth when the heats involved
Sign today or get beat tommorow
First one talkin that family shit
And get a lotta doe and don't give the family shit
I don't care how many ? you wrote
I just wanna see how you gonna dance when your neck get broke
If yall do fall down I'mma scoop the ?
No shiny suits
Everybody boots and jeans
The industry is one thing being real is another
That means i'll steal your mother

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Yo if you let the P call it I don't feel yo ass
I wish duke was still alive and they killed yo ass
You can keep an industry but don't you come to the hood
I got a thousand niggas like me and they feel like Suge
If you think I'm beefin' for nothin' then rob me dog
I'm from the hood
And I ain't been robbed before
Tell you screw all the paper work
You can lie in dirt
Walk through the valley nigga tell me if the iron hurt
Ruffryder now cause that's where the bombs at
And I tell niggas fuck that car jack
Take the roley out the air put the don back
Can't wear shiney suits on combat
Guess I got personal beef
You worse then a thief
Probably be your man that'll work you to sleep
We goin put the guns down and we ain't bringin a crew
You got friends that hate yo ass more than we do nigga

[Bridge: L.O.X]
We don't give a fuck about ya
We don't give a fuck about ya
We don't give a fuck about ya
We gonna be alright with out ya

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now
No we ain't
Wit dem
No more cause we ruffrydin
Get it out ya head now
LOX is back now
Show a little love now
Pump it in the club now
