Joey time, report to the dancefloor

Hey this is the bounce where we talkin about
Make the babys go HEY , and the mammies go OOW
Everybody know it when they step on the spot
You hear the ... at least your favorite wigger gonna DROP [9x]

Hey this is the bounce where we talkin about
Make the babys go HEY , and the mammies go OOW
Everybody know it when the stutterin start
You hear the ... at least another nigga gonna DROP [9x]

More Money , more problems

More hits then 'em all flick we move
More pits that mr Cool ain't sweet cool
