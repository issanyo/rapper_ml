[Intro: Kidrasil]
(Heartbeat from flat to normal on a hospital monitor)
I’m alive

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Verse 1: Kidrasil]
How everybody gon’ phase me when I live in the cut?
Goin’ hard on my dreams, Imma jump to the top
Almost gave up but nah, I just got up from the dirt
Old me’s in a trash bin so face a new flavor
Mad mighty, turned the foggy mind into the sunny
Shed tears when my eyes capture the shotty
Just gimme your heart, I can feed it some love
Lemme be the one who protect you against the slug
I’m finna win, I think it’s enough to spin
No matter that still rock the same old jeans
Won’t let my dream sleep on the triple beam
Gonna be the only leader who lead my own ship
C’mon

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Kidrasil]
Party people say, party people say
(Stand up)
Ay it’s a new day
(On your feet)
It’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
(A new beginning)
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Verse 2: Kidrasil]
Real hustle start when you decide to walk
The phonies won’t stop, do you feel me or not?
Get bullied and punked on my block and shit
But this time I jump with my consciousness
In my daddy’s eyes I’m just a green kiddo
Who ain’t supposed to give his ears to the news from the ghetto
Who’s supposed to focus on the same road he was
Who’s not brave enough to build his own life
To the friends, I mean the people that I would die for them
I been changed and won’t give up by the shit that ya sayin’
Guess what, I made it that’s why ya so jealous
My time is so precious, get away fellas

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Kidrasil]
Party people say, party people say
(Stand up)
Ay it’s a new day
(On your feet)
It’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
(A new beginning)
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Interlude: Kidrasil]
Today is the day to make some changes in your life
Stop overthinking, get up on your feet, start doing
And don’t be afraid of failure
You can’t learn how to walk unless the bloody wounds appear on your knees
You are the only one who can save you from the cell you trapped in

[Verse3: Kidrasil]
Truth hurts but it depends on what you deserve
You choose what to serve and the destinies occur
Only live once, do your best, murk it, Listen!
What if when we die they ask how the fuck was Heaven
Success ain’t got any color, block or white
Fail is part of the game that setting your way bright
Richness and bitches ain’t my point for gettin’ a mic
Peace rise in your eyes worth fightin’ to die
If the opportunities don’t knock build a door
Don’t wait to be comprehended, it’s a joke
So keep goin’, don’t stop and take me for granted
You are the one that has to save this planet

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Kidrasil]
Party people say, party people say
(Stand up)
Ay it’s a new day
(On your feet)
It’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
(A new beginning)
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye
