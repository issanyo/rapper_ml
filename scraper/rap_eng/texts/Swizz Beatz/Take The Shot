Ladies and gentlemen

Oh yeah, ooh, oh yeah

With a lot of rooms, sittin on a hill
(It dont matter) that I got cars
In my garage sittin on a lot of rims
(It dont matter) that everywhere I go
Girls be screamin my name
Material things come and go

(That I) wanna make it right
(That I) need you in my life
Im down by two points
And a three can win the game
Watcha' gon' do girl (girl you got the ball)
Make a move girl (you got my heart)
Take the shot c'mon take the shot

And win the game girl (girl you got the ball)

A playa wants some love

But i dont do one night stands no more (no more)
