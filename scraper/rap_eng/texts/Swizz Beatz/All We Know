(Intro: Ray J)
They see me throw the bazzle up
The haters better level up!
And no one will never get enough
Cause getting money is all I know!

(Hook: Ray J)
Said I'm living my life
A hundred miles an hour
Can't get no rider!
I'mma take you a lil higher (higher)
Cause this is all we know!
Can't lie about my lifestyle
Punk through the women I like while
You can catch me on the way
Get money in different ways
Cause this is all we know!

(Verse 1: Ace Hood)
This all I know, so go get it every morning
Show that chick a hundred K, I bet I get a hundred
Have her cooking breakfast in some baggy sip the garments
And a nigga flyer than a plane I'll be balling!
Yeah, fuck with the rich nigga
Swimming in some money, honey, spend some cash with 'em
Grind force, Aston Martin, leather the dash in 'em
Blowing cash fast, all ass to the denim, huh!
Still balling, way Chris Parlin
Trust fonds, half a million dollars for my daughter
Cool top chop, yeah, you know I was a borrower
Bad bitches to the crib sipping on the 

(Hook: Ray J)
Said I'm living my life

Cause this is all we know!

(Verse 2: Fat Joe)
Glove  black car living
All the success, finesse, car, women
Uh, that only mean more bitches
Motherfuckers, you can't stop my riches!
I've been doing this since birth
Only nigga to take a million in the
Making worst, I got niggas all in their feelings
Rackets all and my niggas still run the building!
Bad night worth ten mil
Chinchilla to the eco of my pimp cribs
We're the fresh pimp teams on
It's undenied boo I've been done!

(Hook: Ray J)
Said I'm living my life
A hundred miles an hour
Can't get no rider!
I'mma take you a lil higher (higher)
Cause this is all we know!

(Verse 3: Swizz Beatz)
Hey, woke up from a jet nap
Fifteen hours off the tour match
Wheels up to wheels down in Hong Kong
Seen my wife, see the rich and nearly I get on
See my top see them nearly gone
Got 'em all get one on the thirty D, my shit is on
I'm in the art market, looking for some good deals
I mean the good, still I buy that shit for real!
One point five in the living room
Another two point five in the hallway (no frame on it)
Talk that life, I get it all day!
In school you'll get it in the hallway all day!

(Hook: Ray J)
Said I'm living my life
A hundred miles an hour
Can't get no rider!
I'mma take you a lil higher (higher)
Cause this is all we know!
Can't lie about my lifestyle
Punk through the women I like while
You can catch me on the way
Get money in different ways
Cause this is all we know!

(Verse 4: Bow Wow)
Yeah! All I know is money, you can go and ask to tell 'em
Watch what she tell you, wine in the cellar
Couple bad bitches, turn to twenty six
That's just the life that I be living!
Tell Hov he ain't the only one
Moving through the city in that sixty-two Maybach
Queen looking pretty, kid
That young boy out here, fucking all the clubs up
Do it for the bitches, why do you think they love us?
Big money when I sleep, but don't sleep on me
See, I was going through the club, before I had ID!
Shut down town, shut down green house
We're the motherfuckers boys, you better read about!
What it is, nigga!

(Hook: Ray J)
Said I'm living my life
