[Intro: Diesel]
Get fresh baby this is your song
Put your good shoes and your lipstick on, this what you need
Get fresh, baby this your song
You said you wanna freak, I'mma give you what you want, this what you want

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Whole lotta of sex, whole lotta of liquor
Whole lotta of chicks, not a lot of niggas
Now at my party, it's all about the bitches
Sexy model missus, ass like delicious
See my main chick, she got that good shit
Head game vicious, so I call her sick
Girl you better be careful, bragging on the dick
Now your friends wanna sample
Fuck a sixty nine, it's six nine six
I be the nine, both of y'all the six
You go both ways, well get a load of this
Beat it so hard now she gotta take a piss
Then you, then you can't even walk in the morning
Go to work yawning, pussy still leaking like a faucet
Damn, now ya girlfriends on it
Ain't no fun if you don't share with the homies

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz
I'mma have you telling all the business about the way that I be giving you the business
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Then my jeans come down, the skirt's coming up
Phone to the side, she feel it in her guts
Ass in the air, fucking up your weave
Pulling on your hair, baby, let me hear you scream
This swipe game mean, I make a bitch cry
I lick you from your lips to your tits, to your thighs
Throw you on your side I'm working out the kinks
You sweating out the sheets, girl you fucking with a freak
She told you I am a beast, she ain't never lied
I could groom both of y'all at the same time
Taking that pussy, bitch this is mine
Throw that shit back, put an arch in ya spine
I never waste time, but I ain't in a rush
Hit it like a champ, I beat the pussy up
He give ya love taps, I feed the pussy up
Got her telling all her friends, she came to a stud

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz
I'mma have you telling all the business about the way that I be giving you the business
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I see 'em with their hands up, and I'm making sure I don't leave no ladies out
I need a dirty dancer, cause baby I can guarantee I'mma turn you out
So all my sexy girls say ah, all my sexy girls say ah
Girl go nasty yeah, me have to tell ya them girl all love me
And I put work in 'til you can't take it
You screaming and we're bucking naked
Pull your hair girl, I'll kiss you girl until you drop
And you got it ya telling everybody all about it and now I'm freaking

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz
I'mma have you telling all the business about the way that I be giving you the business
I make you run and tell your friends, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz, how freaky I'm iz
