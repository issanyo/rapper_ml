[Intro: N. O. Are. E.] (*Swizz Beatz*)
Ah, yeeah... Yeeah nigga! (*yeeah nigga!*)
(*Rap something to talk about*)
Swizz Beatz nigga (*what's up?*) (Swizz Beatz nigga!)
And are. Are. Motherfuckers (motherfuckers)
(*They gone bow down, bow down, bow down*)
This is the continuation
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: N. O. Are. E.]
A yo I'm hot nigga and you should smell my breath
Don't it smell like all I got is cavities left
I hit the left lane nigga, cruise with the crews
And fuck y'all haters - I refuse to lose
You can't stop me, God cause I roll too hard
No license, just a dumb P. B. A. Card
You know N. O. Are. E., my shotgun will tear your chest up
Leave your vest stuffed, face looking like ketchup
So what's this out here, and the projects near, near?
I pop Cris, but I'm good with a beer
Me and Swizz get sound like world war
Tanks falling over, big bombs that roar
And helicopters is dropping on Faulk and Crenshaw
Shit is bigger than how they see it
If I die, then so be it
Until then, I O. D. It, them hoes see it
Motherfucking hoes see it

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, N. O. Are. E.]
[Swizz Beatz] Yo!, y'all niggas want to play around, you gone lay around
[Swizz Beatz] Shots gone spray around, we gone stay around
[N. O. Are. E.] N. O. Are. E
[Swizz Beatz] What the fuck y'all say y'all?!
[N. O. Are. E.] N. O. Are. E
[Swizz Beatz] Like my guns won't spray y'all!
[N. O. Are. E.] N. O. Are. E
[Swizz Beatz] What the fuck y'all say y'all?!
[N. O. Are. E.] N. O. Are. E., yo it's N. O. Are. E., N. O. Are. E

[Verse 2: N. O. Are. E.]
A yo I "switch blade" niggas
Bitch-made niggas
The Lord called on me, knowing my whole story
I holler back like, "please Lord, just come for me"
Niggas analyze this, yo watch my wr
