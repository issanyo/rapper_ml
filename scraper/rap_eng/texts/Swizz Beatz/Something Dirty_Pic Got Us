[Intro: Swizz Beatz & Styles P]
Let's go, Swime
Oh, y’all thought you wasn't gonna get that Kendrick and that L.O.X. smoke, huh? (Yeah)
Y'all thought you wasn’t gonna get that LOX and Kendrick smoke?
That Styles P, that Jada, that Kendrick (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, y'all think it's games being played around here, huh?
Well, they not (Woo)
Lighters in the air

[Verse 1: Jadakiss, Styles P & Swizz Beatz]
The damage that we do is severe
The reinvention of the fresh, brand new every year
Them bullets hit him in his blood and flesh flew in the air
We put that work on commercial, we flew in the Lear
I lift the bar and the weights, then I'm doin' the stairs
They say the Lord only knows what I do to my peers
Tryna smoke, sell juice and pursue my career
So I keep a tight circle, I don't move with the squares
Rock a rugby like Puba, put two in the air
If you ain't qualified to kill, you should move to the rear
I'm from Yonkers, had to learn to conquer my fears
In the foreign, had to learn to conquer the gears
It’s the kick drum, yeah, it’s attached to the snare
I turn the Gat to the back, then I'm crackin’ veneers
You niggas stagnated, on the block, trappin' for wears
I'm in a mansion upstate, out back with the deers
(Talk to 'em, Kendrick)
Nigga, nigga

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Swizz Beatz]
Everybody, back up (Back up, back up, back up)
Man down (Man down, man down, man down)
Back the fuck up
Don’t play with me, I'll do you somethin' dirty
You talk to me crazy, I'll do you somethin' dirty
How I feel lately, I'll do you somethin' dirty (I'll do you somethin' dirty)
I'll wake up the neighbors, comin' through bright and early, woah
(That's where it's at)

[Verse 2: Styles P, Jadakiss & Swizz Beatz]
Cartel ties and dope bars
Life is a movie and death is the co-star
Mechanics to the game
Band of trail, foreigns the lane
If they heard that the driver is gettin' coke off
We be in the part of the party that get roped off
Mingle with the plug and the judge and knock 'em both off
Questions that we askin' ourselves, havin' a smoke-off
Spendin' money that's unaccounted for
If you scared to party with gangstas what you around us for?
We do what we want, my nigga, we get around the law
Yeah, it's bubble whips and square links
LOX get respect, nigga, 'cause fear stinks
A chair at the table, it's the commission, a rare thing
The beat come on, it's us, nigga, you hear the kings
We still smell money in here, Frank
Rap's like the dice game, nigga, we 'bout the clear bank (Let's go)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Swizz Beatz]
Everybody, back up (Back up, back up, back up)
Man down (Man down, man down, man down)
Back the fuck up
Don't play with me, I'll do you somethin' dirty
You talk to me crazy, I'll do you somethin' dirty
How I feel lately, I'll do you somethin' dirty (I'll do you somethin' dirty)
I'll wake up the neighbors, comin' through bright and early, woah

[Outro: Styles P & Swizz Beatz]
This is a LOX, Swizz product
If it's ice up in Heaven, we know Pic got us
It's love up there, we know Pic got us
LOX, my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
Double R, my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
D-Block, my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
Ask Swizz, he'll tell you we keep a clique 'bout us
Goddammit!
