[Verse 1]
There's no other way
That I would want someone to hold me, show me like you
Falling in a daze
So many ways, I'm in amazement thinking about you
No one took the time
To hold my mind, and be the kind that I could talk to
This is the type of day
That I must say, I've been looking forward to

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels

[Chorus]
Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
Waiting for your love

[Refrain]
Come on now!
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap
Come on now!
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap
Come on now!

[Verse 2]
Talking on the phone
When I'm alone, I'm in the zone
And tempted to touch you
Nothing ever fades
The way you take time for me
It makes me want you
Call it what you want
'Cause I'm so dumb
It may be wrong, but baby I'm your fool
I can verify that you're my type
The things we try that others just won't do

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fears
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels

[Chorus]
Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love

[Refrain]
Come on now!
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap
Come on now!
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap
Come on now!

[Outro]
Come on now!
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Come on now!
