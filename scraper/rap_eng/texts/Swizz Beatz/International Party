[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Showtime, Rah, Lets Go, Ahh, Lets Go, Ahh, Ok Lets Go, Ahh

[Verse 1: Swizz Beatz]
Loose in the game and I'mma rasta
Fake you Impostor
Seems like a cranberry and vodka
My attack is crazy, I gotcha
Came through with photos
My man came back with 4 more
You crazy you want war
We about to kick down ya damn door
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me clear!
You don’t really want no problems over here!
We can do everybody oh clear
Yeah, freeze!
Music please, I’m back, back, back on my foot
Came back, man, I’m back with a full clip
Better sush, I get it rush
You seen the floors is plush
Big money is us!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz & Alicia Keys]
I don’t really care
Who’s in here
I’mma run this place
And this is my year
I don’t really care
Who’s in here
I’mma run this planet
This is my year
It’s an international party
International party

[Verse 2: Swizz Beatz]
Lets Go, Here we go now, Lets Go now
Everybody, everybody, everybody hit the floor now
You want some now, wassup now, Tell the DJ turn it up now
Threw me out back with a finley shirt
When it comes to fashion I put in work
I jumped off the plane man and I went bezerk
Tryna keep up boy, that probably hurts
Im loco loco, Everybody says im crazy, crazy
Who that there? Woah thats my baby
Work ya back, make you look crazy
