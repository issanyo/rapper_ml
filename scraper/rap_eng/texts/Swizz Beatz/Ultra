Rock my ultra ways
Producing lumps of Ace, getting ultra blazed
Celebrating surviving where the vultures prey
With a couple uber models in my ultra bay, ay
My clique realer, we get fresher
Balmain jackets, Rick Owens leathers
My chick hotter, skip Prada, Balenciaga
My fame's a monster, ladies go Gaga
From MC ultra ultra
From the mighty ROC Nation La Costra Nostra, uh
Way gangster, our guns is legal, so
We don't even care if you run to them people, ooo
Same lawyer got Diddy off
Did the case, same way I got rid of y'all
Uh, fuck the D.A., the mayor know me
The big guy in D.C. got a favor for me

Ughh, at white parties with white bitches
Fly haircuts, and dyke bitches
Last train to Paris, first stop is Harrods
You don't need no baggage
Uh, I go ultra hard
There's no max on the matte black ultra card
No limit keep spending go ultra hard
Me and Hov two yachts playing bumper cars
Uh, throw the money in the ocean like fuck it
Ughh, throw the linen on and the right bucket ughh
Ughh, I'm on that fly nigga shit
Last thing they shoulda did is let a nigga get rich
You know I'm gonna go too far
All these diamonds in my damn chain, oh my God
