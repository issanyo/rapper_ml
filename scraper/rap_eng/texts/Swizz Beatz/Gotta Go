I gotta go I gotta hit the road
I been up in traffic it's moving kinda slow
But girl ain't no rush you know I missed your
Touch that big booty butt I hope this shit not lust I think I gotta crush  she leave me stuck like Chuck aye
I know my baby Its not money that she want
She want the flowers the candles by the shower
She be close like shadows and standing like a ****
I be high as towers I'm smoking on them flowers "gas"
Baby girl you the one that got the power girl you loyal
You deserve bout every diamond she don't want bands
Because she get it with her dollars
"Yeah and she so loyal man that's that's why I fucks with her she all these other hoes beat she makes me wanna put them the side"

Trey Thugg "Verse"

I let you know that I love you baby but I gotta go
My music popping this lable they want me on the road
Gotta do these shows to pay these bill to let you know it's real
When I was broke down you stayed down with me it's time we heal
Now we on vacations now my bad baecations now everything is paid for I like Gucci she like vlone she was made for me back in the days
I told you we gone make it just work with me now you rock these shows with me I showed you a different life you make just the perfect wife I'm in my life mode now I watched my life go down and now we life goals now tell them to shine those crowns baby girl we made for this and now we get paid for this
