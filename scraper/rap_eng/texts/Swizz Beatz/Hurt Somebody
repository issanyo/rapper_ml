[Hook]
This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle, oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I’ve been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody


[Verse 1]
My momma need a crib, son needs some Jordans
This some bullshit, cause I can’t afford them
Pairs listening, and the band recording
Trying to dodge the pen, hoping I survive the morning
Shit is getting hot, man I’m talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Dancing with no top, trying to skip my fork and
Wanna own the block then you gotta put your work in
Because

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You got the biggest gun, I hope it’s for protection
How you never run, you just count your blessings
Beating down the drum, find me the connection
To get up off the slum, that’s my only investment
Throw you to the ground, book you for possession
Now it’s going down, now I teach them a lesson
Crooked as a clown, wishing I could arrest him
Guess they run the town, from the streets to the correction
So

[Hook]

[Bridge]

No way to dice that
Toss it against the wall
The way you like that
That’s what you’re doing dog
Gambling? What you like? Street gambling
Gambling? What you like? Street gambling
Gambling? What you like? Street gambling

[Hook]
