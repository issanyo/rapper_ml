[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Came in the door
Checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for
Is staring in my face, ooh
They played our song
We hit the floor
He held me strong
And we danced the night away

[Chorus]
I can see the way that he is making me feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying, "ooh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh"
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
If makes you go left, right, up, down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say, "ooh, oh, oh, oh", say, "ooh, oh, oh, oh"

[Verse 2]
It's been a long long time
Since I fell, fell
Love has found my way, oh, oh, oh
I've been looking (looking)
I've been searching (searching)
For the man to touch this place, oh, ooh, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Canâ€™t deny the way that he's making feel
This way about his love
I've been searching for something like this
I'm saying, "ooh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh"
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say, "oooh, oh, oh, oh", say, "ooh, oh, oh, oh"
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say, "oooh, oh, oh, oh", say, "ooh, oh, oh, oh"

[Verse 3]
If you feel good
If you're feeling good
Put one hand in the air, say, "yeah"
If you feel good
If you're feeling good
It's 'cause love is in the air
Love is in the air

[Chorus]
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "oh oh oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say, "ooh, oh, oh, oh", say, "ooh, oh, oh, oh"
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say, "ooh, oh, oh, oh", say, "ooh, oh, oh, oh"

[Outro]
My baby...
Ooh
C'mon and say...
C'mon and say...
"Ooh"
C'mon and say...
"Ooh, baby"
