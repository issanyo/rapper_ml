[Verse 1]
When the wind is blowing in your face
Sometimes in life you don't see straight
Pray to Him and He will show
When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you say
Stand strong and you will grow

[Chorus]
Oooh Wait till you see my smile
Oooh Wait till they see your smile

[Verse 2]
Don't they love to see you down?
Kick you while you're on the ground
Don't let emotions show
People always speculate
Don't let it get in your way
They say things they don't know

[Chorus]
Oooh Wait till you see my smile
Oooh Wait till they see your smile

[Bridge]
Hey
So you're doing better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need 'em much
'Cause you're stronger and you're better
And you're ready for whatever (Sing)

[Chorus]
Oooh Wait till you see my smile
Oooh Wait till they see your smile

[Outro]
Oooh Wait till you see my smile
Oooh Wait till they see your smile
