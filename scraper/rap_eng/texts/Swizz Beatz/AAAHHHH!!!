[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, yeah
Woo! Yeah, woo! Yeah, woo! Yeah
Look

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Niggas want me to busta rhymes, so ironic
It's Busta Rhymes, so iconic
Niggas can't fuck wit the kid, you know the logic
Bounce dookie should move, 'fore we make it a topic
I'm shitting on niggas to where I need a colonic
Or when I'm showing up and only collecting the profit
Sha, sha, sha, que sera is how I picks it up
Making niggas put holes in the wall is how I rip shit up
'Tron, a lil yak and some kush is how I mix it up
I love the way she gets down on her knees and how she licks it up
The way a nigga give you the shit and how he thinks it up
Look, pardon me, yeah look, peep how I lift shit up

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Woo! Yeah, yeah
I just dropped a big bag
On a brand new
AAAHHHH!!!
Yeah I just pulled up to the club
With the top all gone, new
AAAHHHH!!!
Woo! Went shopping for four days, four days
Riding with the, riding with the
AAAHHHH!!!
Right! I don't really give a
AAAHHHH!!!
Now let the beat drop
Clap on, now we gon' clap on
Clap off, clap on, yeah we gon' clap on
Nigga talking all crazy, strap all on
Tell my homies clap off from the clap, Let's get it!

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Clap off, clap on, bitch see we back on
Wall in the west wing, hang all my plaques on
I be blacking in this bitch 'til the whole track gone, King Kong
Got 'em bouncing off the walls, ping pong
Rolls Royce Wraith seats, I'm resting my back on
Bottles of 1942, getting my drank on
Funny how my mommy say she love my new rap song
How a nigga keep it fresh, Balmain slacks on
Now that's wrong, she ripping off her new black thong
Now she bugging, shorty, can't believe the dick that long
Collapse on the couch inside of my mansion
Wish y'all niggas could've really seen my reaction

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Woo! Yeah, yeah
I just dropped a big bag
On a brand new
AAAHHHH!!!
Yeah I just pulled up to the club
With the top all gone, new
AAAHHHH!!!
Woo! Went shopping for four days, four days
Riding with the, riding with the
AAAHHHH!!!
Right! I don't really give a
AAAHHHH!!!
Now let the beat drop
Clap on, now we gon' clap on
Clap off, clap on, yeah we gon' clap on
Nigga talking all crazy, strap all on
Tell homies clap off from the clap
