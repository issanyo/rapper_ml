[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Preacher told me don't set trip on a Sunday
Knowin' damn well that devil gettin' played Monday

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q + Swizz Beatz]
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy

[Verse: ScHoolboy Q]
Na-na-na na-na na-na
Never, ever
Ever, ever get caught tellin' on my niggas
I'm a gangbanger, deadbeat father and drug dealer
When the money and fame gone, tell me who stayin' with you
Runnin' from God's creations
Shakin' these broken hands and meetin' with blank faces
Snake eyes keepin' my back achin'
Dirty habits of rappin' and bein' savage
Still hangin' with niggas that can't do nothin' but cause damage
Guess I'm bein' a real nigga like I'm 'posed to be
But bein' real never once bought the groceries and
Top told me, "Keep rappin', you'll make it hopefully"
And hope was all that I needed, dreamin' myself to work
Cus workin' to fail was better than bullet holes in my shirt
The demons hate when you make it and stay alive
They'd rather see me down under than see me fly
Lord have mercy!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Lord have mercy
Please, Heaven's mercy
Lord have mercy
Please, Heaven's mercy

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
They say I was a wanted man, a wanted man
Runnin' with my gun in hand, gun in hand
They don't wanna see the wanted man, the wanted man
Comin' through with the gun in hand, the gun in hand, damn
Lord have mercy
