[Verse 1]
There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

[Verse 2]
Every step makes me think that I'm closer
But somehow I just never arrived
When our hope disappears, please protect me from my tears
I need you right by my side

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, hallelujah
Woah, woah, hallelujah
All the places I've been
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

[Outro]
Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in
