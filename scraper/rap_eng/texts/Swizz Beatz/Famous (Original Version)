[Intro: Rihanna + (Kanye West)]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
(Swizz told me let the beat rock)

[Verse 1: Kanye West + (Swizz Beatz)]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (God damn)
Yeah we still hood famous

[Hook: Rihanna + (Swizz Beatz)]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
(Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!)
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Good God
Midwest coast back nigga
And don't say nigga unless of course you black nigga
Free country they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all they white daughters drinking Hennessy
I'ma go to Sal's, put some niggas on a wall
I might go to Oz take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano so involved
I know
King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had 2 polos
We the kids they keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They askin' bout the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff

[Bridge: Sister Nancy + (Swizz Beatz)]
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
'ey what a bam bam
(How you feeling right now? Let me see your lighters in the air)
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
Bam bam eh
Bam bam, bam bam
(Let me see your middle finger in the air)
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
(Let me see you act up in this motherfucker)

Bam bam dilla, bam bam
(How you feelin', how you feelin, how you feelin' in this mother fucker, god damn)
Bam bam
(One thing you can't do is stop us now)
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
(You can't stop the thing now)
'ey what a bam bam
(Man it's way too late, it's way too late, it's way too late you can't fuck with us)
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam

Bam bam dilla, bam bam
(I wanna see everybody hands in the air like this)
'ey what a bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam

[Outro: Nina Simone]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
