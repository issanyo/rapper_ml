[Intro]
I fasted for 30 days. No question of where was home. Darkness followed me. I shepherd on. I can't unsee the things that'll make you run, but fear no man. The real recognize how I stand strong. With the hood in my heart and hip hop on my sleeve and 25 soldiers multiplied, always strapped, we march on. I flip the script and flip the switch on my midbrain, manifesting this prescription quick. Epileptic overdose, head-banging lyrical fitâ€”we vibrate on. No man, monster, or attack can attempt contact. This wildfire in your veins cannot be tamed. No spitting in tongues with your back on the ground, shaking. This is your awakening. It's time to show you the side effects. From Tottenham, to the Bronx, and beyond. All this shit is poison
