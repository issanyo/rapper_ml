Like a match to a flame...

[Verse 1]
She's just a girl and she's
Hot like a flame, she's on fire
On fire, baby, on fire, oh, oh yeah
She's filled with catastrophe
She lives in a world that's on fire
On fire, baby, on fire, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, she's got her feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, oh, she's got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down
(Never)

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
I'm a girl, and I'm on fire
Like a match to a flame
Like a match to a flame
She's a match to a flame
Yeah, I'm a flame

[Verse 2]
She looks like a girl, but she, yeah
She's really just a flame
You can try but you'll never, you'll never forget her
On fire, on fire, baby, on fire, oh, oh yeah
She so bright, she'll burn your eyes
Better look the other way
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest
On fire, on fire baby, on fire, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, oh, we got our head in the clouds
And we're not backing down
(Never)

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
I'm a girl and I'm on fire
Like a match to a flame
She's a girl in a flame
I'm a match to a flame

[Bridge]
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
I'm a girl and I'm on fire

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said I'm a girl, and I'm on fire (Match to a flame)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm a girl and I'm on fire (Like a match to a flame)

Yeah, haha, yeah, you know I am
You know what you see
It's like a match to a flame
