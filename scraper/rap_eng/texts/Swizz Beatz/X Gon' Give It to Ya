[Intro]
Yeah (uh), yeah, yeah (uh) (Grrrr)
Yeah, don't get it twisted
This rap shit is mine, motherfucker!
It's not a fucking game
Fuck what you heard!
It’s what you hearin' (it’s what you hearin')
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)

[Verse 1]
X gon' give it to ya
Fuck waiting for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop pop of stainless steel
Go hard, getting busy wit it
But I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right, and I'll do it again, 'cause I am right so I gots to win
Break bread with the enemy, but no matter how many cats I break bread with I'll break who you sendin' me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothing
But your life saved, bitch, and that's on a light day
I'm getting down, down like a nigga said "Freeze!"
But won't be the one ending up on his knees
Bitch please, if the only thing you cats did
Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker!

[Hook ]
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

[Hook ]
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

[Verse 2]
Ain't never gave nothing to me
But every time I turn around
Cats got they hands out wanting something from me
I ain't got it, so you can't get it
Let's leave it at that 'cause I ain't with it
Hit it with full strength
I'm a jail nigga, so I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever, nigga, fuck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
Only nigga that you know who can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for 19 years
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears
I put in work, and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is
They don't know who we be
Looking, but they don't know who they see, nigga

[Hook]
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

[Verse 3]
Ay yo, where my niggas at?! I know I got them down in the game, give 'em love and they give it back
Talk too much for too long (What?!)
Don't give up, you're too strong (What?!)
Dub to the wild wild hunneds (Yeah!)
Shout out to niggas that done it (Come on!)
And it ain't even about the dough
It's about getting down for what you stand for, yo – for real!

[Hook]
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
