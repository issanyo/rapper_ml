It's me bitches
Show time
Chillin' in my beamer, listenin' to [Incomprehensible]
Bumpin' through ya speakers, know I got the heaters
Rockin' don't stop, I get the rockin', don't stop
I'm bangin' 'em beats, you know I like that hip hop, stop
Freeze, you know who it is, it's me, bitches
Smoke good, eat good, drink good, fuck good
Come into the club stuntin' like ike you should
My shit on fire, I don't need no gasolina
I'm comin' through ya block wit the deuce two seater
Ring the alarm, man, call me the sand man
When I drop beats, I'm the one man band, man
Cash rules everythin' around me cream
Get the money, dollar, dollar bills, y'all fuck 'em
Freeze, you know who it is? It's me, bitches
Vita loco, flyin' through popo
See me in that four door, that Bentley the sports car
Benz all lethal, my rims so lethal
You front, I'mma, I'mma shoot that ass like a free throw
Sniffin that ya yo, tryna be Sosa
Tryna act tough when that's some black chocha
I ain't gotta shoot ya, I could just choke ya
Ya tryna make money, I wish I could just show ya
Freeze, you know who it is? It's me, bitches
Chillin' in my beamer, listenin' to [Incomprehensible]
Bumpin' through ya speakers, know I got the heaters
Rockin' don't stop, I get the rockin', don't stop
I'm bangin' 'em beats, you know I like that hip hop, stop
Freeze, you know who it is? It's me, bitches
Smoke good, eat good, drink good, fuck good
Come into the club stuntin' like ike you should
My shit on fire, I don't need no gasolina
I'm comin' through ya block wit the deuce two seater
Ring the alarm, man, call me the sand man
When I drop beats, I'm the one man band, man
Cash rules everything around me cream
Get the money, dollar, dollar bills, y'all fuck 'em
Freeze, you know who it is? It's me, bitches
