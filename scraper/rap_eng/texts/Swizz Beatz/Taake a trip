[Swizz Beatz] Start up the engine

[Bridge]
We rollin' in the six fo
And all your hearin' is
All your hearin' is, all your hearin' is

Flyin in the G-Fo'
And all your hearin' is
All your hearin' is, all your hearin' is

Let Me Take You Awaaayy (Mashonda)

[Hook]
Can we take a trip
Baby I don't mind
There we go, as long as your all mine
We can drive or walk
Baby we can fly
As long as you take me away
I'll be makin' you say

[Verse 1]
I'm flying in the G-Fo'
And when I land you should be standing there with the keys in your hand
Then we ridin in the six Fo'
You my chick so
All them other chicks I was with, can call it quits yo
You the chick Im with yo
And I don't like to kiss
But Everytime we kiss, I can't let your lips go
I love you like my Pistol
With you I stay safe, so you can stay straight
We gon have to vacate
And go take a trip yo
Go and relax, you can shop when you land, you don't even need to pack
I ain't letting this go
I'm holding on it for life
Tomorow night, Boo we boarding a flight
Aight

[Hook]
Can we take a trip
Baby I don't mind
There we go, as long as your all mine

I'll be makin' you say

OoOo My, OoOo My
Baby don't stop, daddy you'll be making me say
Ah ah OoOo Ah
La, La, La, La, La, La, La

[Verse 2]
I'm sailing on Swizz yacht
You know I get gwap
I can spend about house money just on a wrist watch
So you know my chick hot
And got a nice face
But she got a tight waist
She in tip-top
Shape
But still thick like Grits-top
Without effort, she break records like a Disk Jock
Shawty 'bout to get got
Cause she hard as nails
She that broad, it ain't hard to tell
Well me and shawty lip lock
Then I took her to bed
And before she fell to sleep, I said
Girl I love you more than Hip-Hop
You a woman, a wife
I think I finally met a woman I like
Right

[Hook]
Can we take a trip
Baby I don't mind
There we go, as long as your all mine
We can drive or walk
Baby we can fly
As long as you take me away
I'll be makin' you say

OoOo My, OoOo My
Baby don't stop, daddy you'll be making me say
Ah Ah, OoOo Ah
La, La, La, La, La, La, La

[Verse 3]
The ball Cas' serious
Are you hearing this
Are you hearing this
Are you hearing this
She'd be delirious of the experience
Cause' I'm a straight thug that know how to make love
If she ain't on her period
Then I'm getting it done
I gotta let her feel the tip of the tongue
Then ride out like a chariot
So even if I'm gone
She can't forget about the trip we was on
Come on'

[Hook]
Can we take a trip
Baby I don't mind
There we go, as long as your all mine
We can drive or walk
Baby we can fly
As long as you take me away
I'll be makin' you say

OoOo My, OoOo My
Baby don't stop, daddy you'll be making me say
Ah Ah, OoOo Ah
La, La, La, La, La, La, La

[Outro]
We rollin' in the six fo
And all your hearin' is
All your hearin' is, all your hearin' is

Flyin in the G-Fo'
And all your hearin' is
All your hearin' is, all your hearin' is
