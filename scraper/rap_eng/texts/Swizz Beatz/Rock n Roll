[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
We gonna party, all night
Let's go, alright
We gonna rock and roll
Who wanna rock and roll
Party, all night
Let's go, alright
We gonna rock and roll
Who wanna rock and roll

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm in this bitch like I wanna rock right now
We so deep you motherfuckers might drown
I'm fly tonight call me a night owl
I'm high as stars blue skies and white clouds
Talking about let's go crazy, let's go ladies, they all follow soon
...tell it, yeah it's a movie, watch the trailer if it don't float out both, pop the sailor
Party all night, party all night, a whole bunch of bitches this is a dog fight
Be getting in the cream, you know off-white
A whole lot of smoke, I need fog lights
Young Money baby you can't hold me
You can't book me so you can't fold me
Lose your mind, out of control, I now pronounce you rock and roll, yeah

[Hook]
