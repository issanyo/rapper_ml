[Intro]
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah

[Chorus]
I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you gotta let it go
Just to make it possible
Sometimes you gotta do it
Be willing to lose it
Freedom has no price, you know
Thinking how we gonna make it now
How we gonna feed the babies now
We gon' make it through it
God gon' see to it
Just get up and do it now

[Chorus]
I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again

[Post-Chorus]
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up

[Verse 2]
See, I learned the hard way
Now I'm doing it in my way
'Cause life is too short to fall in New York
Can't get up and get away
So I gotta let it all go
Start back from zero
'Cause I give it up, I don't give a fuck
'Cause love is my hero

[Chorus] (x2)
I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again

[Post-Chorus]
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up
