[Verse 2:Sincereluvdagod]
Feel like im in Havana with Hov smoking a stoge listening to coldplay/ dancing walking on the beach with my soul mate/ box braids floppy beach hat/ spilling sun tan lotion but really she dont need that/ i travel the world like a sovereign/ rumor has it illuminati gave me a pardon/ thats hog wash they just gossiping/ actually im the opposite of the baphomet/ now even that sounds blasphemous/ im just teaching student enrollment but the class is dismissed/ supreme math---thats universal/(peace) heard your boy just did another deal with universal/ better tell em he need to find Sin/ sign him you know the people gonna rewind him/(slow down) and ya'll gone learn today/ chillin' on the beach no sun burn for me/
