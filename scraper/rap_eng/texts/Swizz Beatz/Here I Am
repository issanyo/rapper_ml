[Verse 1]
Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear sometimes it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'mma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percocets
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

[Hook 1]
I am who I am, uh!
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
I am who I am, uh!

[Verse 2]
I swear to God man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold till death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease

[Hook 2]
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
Here I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
