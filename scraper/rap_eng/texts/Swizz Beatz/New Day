Oh, oh, AK!
New day
Oh, oh, AK!
Ow!

[Hook]
Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
While it's gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
Aye, aye, aye, aye aye

It's your right to feel however you want to
There's no limitation, no
If you love your life, let me see your hands up one time
We'll celebrate mine, cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night, one time
Everybody say, "Aye aye oh" (Oh)

There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say

[Hook]

See the look in my eyes, can't you see I'm ready, aye
Come along let's get it
If you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
All night and all day
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life left to live it up
One life left to live it up

There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say

[Hook]

I saw the world
It's now or never at all
I'm gonna give it my all, oh
Let the water rise and fall, oh
I'm gonna give it my all

[Hook]

Celebrate and say
Celebrate and say
Celebrate and say
