Yeah

Okay it's Oh Eight
Young Wayne just back on the scene
With the green
And a cup full of lean
Ba-ling symbolizes the bottom
We at the top
And Pimp-C dead last year was a shock
And my flow is so tip top notch
Cause' I'm on my raps like a Hip-Hop cop
Why oh why
My oh my
Ms. Mary J
I am so obliged
For you to involve Weezy Baby!
I told my mom and she went crazy
She said "son thats a good look for ya"
And she wanted me to let you know that
She would cook for ya
But back to the subject
Something you could dance to
Cause Swizzy is a bad dude
And Weezy is a can do
And we are crack, smack
That never wack
Like I never had a caddy
I would never lack
And I would never lie
I would never say never
When I ever say never
Say never cause' I never gave up
Whatever
It's whatever
I be with bad guys and good fellas'
Yeah
You're jealous
And we're not dot com
E-Mail us
Yeah I did a joint wit Mary J Blige my nigga

[Mary J Blige]
Let it go......
Can't let this thing called love get away from you
Feel free right now, going do what you want to do
Can't let nobody take it away, from you, from me, from we
No time for moping around, are you kidding?
And no time for negative vibes, cause I'm winning
It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
No stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my mind right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just.....

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine

Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
Keep your head up high
In yourself, believe in you, believe in me
Having a really good time, I'm not complaining
And I'm a still wear a smile if it raining
I got to enjoy myself regardless
I appreciate life, I'm so glad I got mine
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me

When I'm walking past the mirror
Ain't worried about you and what you gonna do
I'm a lady so I must stay classy
Got to keep it hot, keep it together
If I want to get better
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just.....
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
You see I won't change my life, my life's just fine

I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
(I ain't gone let nobody bring me down, no, no, no)
No matter what nobody has to say
(No way, no way, no way)
I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
No matter what nobody has to say

Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
It's a really good thing to say
That I won't change my life, my life's just fine

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
You see I won't change my life, my life's just fine

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
No stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my mind right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just.....

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine
