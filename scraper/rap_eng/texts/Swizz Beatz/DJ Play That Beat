It's the type of songs that the DJs play
Estelle in the party rocking rocking all day
Swizzy on the beats you know the boy don't play
One hand in the air for the for the UK
Hey!

[Hook:]
[Estelle:]
DJ play the beat, DJ DJ play the beat
DJ DJ play the beat, [repeat]

[Verse 1:]
[Estelle:]
I said hey do I remember you
We've been tryna holla since the first day I meet you, you do
DJ tryna play some sh*t to do it in the row, way not to meant to hurt on fact
I see them come I see them go
I've seen their chains and the collars that they dope on, oh
See I got it times two
Spend a couple years ain't new around

[Chorus: repeat]
[Estelle: (Swizz:)]
You wanna rock, (Hey!)
Bet yo girl is so hard she's a rock, (Oh!)
Excuse my rocking, I wanna rock, (Hey!)
You know I'll rock you, you like jack to my style
(What you say!)
Aaaooouh!

[Verse 2:]
[Estelle: (Swizz:)]
I said trust who's stalling from the beats
Came out from the dope where also were my ass is slapped
Girl that's what swagger is
But everybody is saying is.....on me
(Hands in the air!)
On fact, something you can never buy
Even if he says her stacks is greater than mine
I said I will not try no sew
Spend a couple years what you talking bout
(Ladies and gentlemen!)

[Chorus: repeat]
[Breakdown:]
[Estelle: (Swizz:)]
He said yoouu, you can call me back girl, (You can call me back girl)
He said yoouu, you can call me back girl, (Yes you may)
I said it's true boo, I can tutor you
Take you to my home school
Show you what this girl can dooo
I don't take no mess
You need to come and see me when you get some hair in your chest
