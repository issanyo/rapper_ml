[Famous Intro: Rihanna + Kanye West]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

[Verse]
If SoundCloud died, a lot of rappers would ghost
In 2015, they thought my rapping was toast
In 2016 I started rocking the boat
In 2017 I'm giving these niggas smoke
*Cough, cough* (Dope)
I'm an animal, fuck it, no I'm a cannibal
Fuckin a bitch thick as the glasses on Buress Hannibal
That's probably just as thick as my wallet after a college show
Give my BBC to the A student in honor roll, like
(what's that?)
I don know, I'm just tryna get outta here
They try just copy my inner-, under- and outerwear
Remember I would call up the number asking is
Alice here?
They would be like, this ain't no Alice nigga
My names Amir
A man's biggest fear
But now I'm pushing past my peers up this ladder
Looking down in was makes me scared
I don't never look there
They love me and they hate me
Got they feelings so mixed that their heart got good hair
Put me on the throne, I promise I'll give it good care
The best new nigga, can't none of these rappers compare
They might be a little bit more popular now
But as soon as I pop, they pop charting go down
Fuck it
When I pop, they Papa Doc backing 'em out
Aim 32 bars at their head, parting their crown
Pick the pieces up and weld it together sit my ass down
Then release then flow, how many new rappers will drown?
(pause)
All of em
Killing every odd that comes
Most these niggas cornballs
I'mma have to harvest em
I might have to (brrp, brrp), I can't even think of nothing
Winning it this light over my head like I'm thinking something
Bars hit yo ear, face looking like it stink or something
Pulling out even with a condom if I think I'm coming
I don't trust no hoe, said it twenty one-four
TRIBE be the click, HOLY be the logo
Been wore Supreme since my first video, ho
So it's only right when you see me out in Soho
I know I'm from the land where they jump you at a gogo, but
Why this niggas jumping on my stick no pogo
Pause no homo
Put me in the ring and we can brawl go toe toe
Used to steal clothes for the malls up Moco
Now my last check read five, oh, oh oh
All from my vocals
So fuck a list, my fans know that I'm the best
And they growing by the minute from the time that I invest
Speaking of invest, Jewish niggas organize my check
Telling me relax every time a brother wanna flex
What next?
I just speak my peace, keep my peace
Cubans with Jesus piece, with my peeps
Rest In Peace B.I.G, know that he
Never gonna die
