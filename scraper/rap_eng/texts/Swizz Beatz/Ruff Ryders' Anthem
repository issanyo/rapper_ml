[Intro]
Something new

[Chorus]
Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it; you want it, come and get it
Took it, then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we're goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some mo' niggas that's runnin' with yo' niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle, just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight, then you haven't met the apes

[Chorus]
Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 2]
Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby; mind your business, lady!
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
Ayo, I'ma slave till my home is a grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors, and now they wanna rape us

[Chorus]
Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 3]
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? BOOM! Not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor, wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that .44
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make the move, got a point to prove
Gotta make them groove, got 'em all like, "Ooh!"
So to the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

[Chorus]
Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Outro]
Talk is cheap, motherfucker!
