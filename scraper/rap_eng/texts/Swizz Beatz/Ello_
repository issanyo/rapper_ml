[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello
I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say

[Verse 1]
Uh
Hello, can you hear me now?
'Cause they fear me now, it's paramount
When [?], they just copyish, they like Perry Smile
Hello? I'm like Basquiat
When it comes to blocks, used to just paint the pots
Hello, can you hear me now?
Need me you near me now, don't tear me down
When I said I fell in love, you would swear me down
But you gotten to the point where you don't share me now
Had to take a deeper look, it's lookin' scary now
Playin' cat and mouse like Tom and Jerry now
Hello? Can you feel the vibe?
They tryna kill the wave but we still alive
'Cause she say she really, really long, I just say [?]
Lemme take 'em to church, don't forget the choir
Hello? Lemme get that back
They like damn, you ain't gotta kill their ish like that
But somebody said bad, we gon put right back
They ain't never ever, ever heard no drip like that

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello
I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say

[Verse 2]
Hello? L-O-L
All I wanna do is ball like I'm Sam [?]
Got lovin' in the air, can't stand the smell
You a angel on Earth, how I feel when you fell
Hello? VE
Back to back to back blunts, that's a three piece
Baby girl got more guys than a three piece
I'ma shoot a Steph Curry with the release
Like hello, they say we're goin' back
On that dodo rap, the vibes and highs are back
Words are facts, made it out the trenches, still runnin' the trap
When I hit one time, she be runnin' it back
Like hold up, body like that, brain gotta be hype
Booty like that, frame gotta be tight
Pull up in the light so I know what she like
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If lovin' me is wrong, you don't gotta be right
Ass so rude, you don't try to be nice
Let them catch feelings while the real catch flights
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If lovin' me is wrong, you don't gotta be right
Ass so rude, you don't try to be nice
Let them catch feelings while you tryna take flights
Like hello

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello
I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello, are you down?
If I'm talkin' to myself, I say hello
