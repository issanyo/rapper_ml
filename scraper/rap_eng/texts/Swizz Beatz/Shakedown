(Intro: Swizz Beatz)
Cuban, stop playing with these niggas man, monster
I told these clown niggas, you know what it is
BX, stand the f*ck up, yall niggas better pull yall razors out
Have yall security wear yall vests, whatever, whatever
Its a shakedown, anything can get laid down in the way (New York City)
Get run over with trucks and all that, f*ck em, ladies and gentlemen
They dont want no problems (3x)

(Verse One - Cuban Link)
Yo its the Bronx most wanted, word to Pun, its the best that ever done it
Better run it, or Ima pump a hundred in your stomach, never running
Coming, Im gunning for the love of money
Rough, rugged and raw, fourth down, suggest you punt it
So Im on it like Tony Montana, slip on the banana
Clip and cock the hammer to split open your bandana
Living the life of glamour with a mansion in Havana
Cameras and scanners cause Im not trying to see the slammer
I plan to make more pesos than Tony did with the yeyo
Yall phoney pendejos, will get K-Oed, so I suggest that you lay low
Cause Ima rock your cradle for that payroll
Put the hot potato in the Glock, and burn out your lucky charms out to playdough
Fatal blows, aint no saving you from rocking that halo
Aint no f*cking with us, its like drugs, you say no
Laying it down, either ride a wave and then drown
Misbehave and get found in the grave underground, shake em down

(Chorus)
Throw your hands in the air, this is a shakedown
CLK up in here, Im about to blaze rounds
And we aint going nowhere, we gon break ground
Took what I can take now, Im here to shut the place down
Yeah we taking it there, and youll get laid down
Haters better beware, nobody safe now,*
We got em running they scared, about to breakdown
No way youll escape now, nigga its a shakedown

(Verse Two - Cuban Link)
Im on the road to the riches, focused on digits, no more hoping on wishes,*
Never mix business and pleasure, the code is dough over bitches
Hands so vicious, know Ima Blow like the motion picture
Loading the clips up, f*ck love, my slugs gon getcha
Stuck to the scripture, hustled up from nothing to richer
Me and my niggas apply the pressure like boa constrictors
We not gon switch up, bubbling like coats in the winter
They still in the sentra, rolling with the coke in the fender
Its all an adventure, remember no retreat, no surrender
You wanna enter my center, you gotta paga mi renta
Puro Cubano del ochenta, all I need is a banger,*
To give you a muerte lenta like Emilio Ravenga,*
And Ill be gone till November, got plans to bank mills
I cant stand still, gotta expand and branch bills
Thats the grand thrill, keep my hands on the steel
Never ran, never will, real recognize real

(Chorus)
Throw your hands in the air, this is a shakedown
CLK up in here, Im about to blaze rounds
And we aint going nowhere, we gon break ground
Took what I can take now, Im here to shut the place down
Yeah we taking it there, and youll get laid down
Haters better beware, nobody safe now,*
We got em running they scared, about to breakdown
No way youll escape now, nigga its a shakedown

(Verse Three - Cuban Link)
Yo its the Spanish casanova living lavish, 24 Karat,*
Toke a f*cking marriage, in Paris*
We talking parrots on my shoulders, hold up,*
They mad all over cause Cuban is taking over
I thought I told ya Im doper than Coke without the baking soda
Drunk or sober, jump out the rover, fold you with a crowbar,*
Throw a rope around your neck and do what Sosa did to Omar
So far, my repertoire get respect in no parts
Like Joan of Arc in Quitona Park brawling till dark,*
Its Cuban Link from the start, till I come across God
No holds barred, most niggas got balls but no heart
Oh god, like Humphrey, smoking cigars living comfy
Only in America, you gotta love this country
Im hungry, I want the bag of money from the chump,*
Act funny if you want and be that dummy in the trunk
Who wanna run with the Don Dada, nigga come holla
From the Bronx where they gun down punks for one dollar

(Chorus)
Throw your hands in the air, this is a shakedown
CLK up in here, Im about to blaze rounds
And we aint going nowhere, we gon break ground
Took what I can take now, Im here to shut the place down
Yeah we taking it there, and youll get laid down
Haters better beware, nobody safe now
We got em running they scared, about to breakdown
No way youll escape now, nigga its a shakedown
Its a Shakedown...and youll get laid down...nobody safe now
About to break down, no way youll escape now, nigga its a Shakedown

(Outro - Cuban Link & *Swizz Beatz*)
Nobody safe up in this motherf*cker, word up
Too many years of blood, sweat and tears
We bout to claim ours, you know how we do it
Clk my nigga, word up, Swizz you know how the f*ck we get down baby
South boogie down all around New York, this how we do it for real, you heard
We about to pop it off, no more games being played, (talk to em 6x)
Its for real (Cuban stop playing with these niggas)
Swizz Beatz, oh no they dont want no problems (they dont want no problems)
Yeah (7x) CLK yeah (I had to pull out the Ol School drums)
