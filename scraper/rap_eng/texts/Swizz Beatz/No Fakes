Woke up in the morning feeling livid
Looked at you and things are feeling different
You said you gon' be back in like a minute
You want some games, but I ain't playing in your scrimmage, nah

You on the same shit I predicted
Snow wet on the ground I caught you slipping
Talking shit, but you said you was kidding
I heard it from a friend that you was lying for the image

I am mortified in this gotta be dismissed
Borderline crazy with a shorter time, listen
I know that you gotta be supporting my business
Just to get a little tiny  piece of my riches, yeah

Everytime I'm pouring my vision
You just gotta be the one recording my misschief, damn
I think it's time to keep you at a distance
Can't take it, but you always on the diss shit

Little bit of sneaking or suspicion
That you only try to give me criticism
So that I can stop believing in myself, yeah
I'm setting fire to the bridges

No way, no way man I don't
Make no mistakes when I go
No fakes, no fakes around me
I don't want you to stay, just leave
(2X)

No way, no way
No fakes, no fakes
(4X)

Waste time and you waste time on the month
You won't even take the time just to prove the trust
Learnt I should just give it in and give it up
I found that you never really gave a fuck, nah

You the type to train to be a hypebeast
Learned that I'm a target, I'm like why me
See through like it's raining in a white T
And you know being better isn't likely

Nobody's perfect, but that's the greatest thing
Sore throat, but I'ma always find a way to sing
Lifejacket on, still you find a way to sink
This life got me contemplating plain strains

Fake love around me got me afraid to blink
I'm digging in a hole without a way out
When I see you only happy for another drink
Every conversation got your face down

Every emotion has start to fade now
A little devotion will go a long way
But you don't even know I got you figured out
A long road and you moving a the wrong pace

No way, no way man I don't
Make no mistakes when I go
No fakes, no fakes around me
I don't want you to stay just leave
(2X)

No way, no way
No fakes, no fakes
(4X)
