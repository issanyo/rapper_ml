I don't promise but I got good numbers
Tote 2 thunder, sat that lumber
Got that guacamole holy moly you don't know me
See me clean as I wanna be, what these niggas wanna be
Shots so bright I can't see niggas standing right in front of me
These niggas don't want none of me, this rapping shit is fun to me
What I look like beefing wit you nigga yousa son to me
Move weight out to Georgia get it cross the water
Rive that shit to New York coming all the way from Florida
Dope boy trap nigga that's what they call em
Summer time balla when I buy the mall up

[Hook 1 + 2]

[Verse 2]
Might have seen me getting gas at the Citgo and he sit the six low
Riding right beside a 45 and what its hitting fo
Shawty ain't bullshitin folk he'll be out be here hitting folks
Stick around and try to tell polices what he did it fo
Ain't nuttin he ain't did before other niggas getting so
Blurred wit the pussy and bet some even getting so
Long he ain't funny he got that long money
Naw money you niggas barely got hit the mall money
I'm the perfect example of how to hit the ground running
From the trap to busting up how the underground stunting
So you still see me down at the underground stunting
Ima Westside Bankhead nigga it ain't nothing

[Hook 1 + 2]

[Verse 3]
I was raised off Easy, 'Cube, Ice T, 8Ball, MJG, 'Face, Pimp C
Ima king just believe me, try me when you see me
And niggas start busting like they start busting pushups push a
Button shot calling niggas not balling
Just doing a lotta loud mouthing and not dogging
I got the shit locked from Atlanta to New Orleans
Virginia Mississippi Kentucky I run all dat
You niggas better fall back, boy grab a ball bat
Take it to ya skull, dats gone be the end of all dat
Insist on having problems, bet dis revolver will solve dat
Hit em in the temple then I leave em where they fall at

[Hook 1 + 2]
