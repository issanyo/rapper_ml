[Intro: DMX]
Uhhhh, uhhhh
Let's do it, we're startin'
Uh, come on, boogie boogie, uh, uh
Let's do it, let's do it, DMX, come on

[Verse 1: DMX]
I been playin' bitches all my life, from that ho to my wife
You think I give a fuck, like you don't know I'm livin' trife
Strife and struggle, bitches with pussy on the juggle
Little shorty named Tamika from 25th who can smuggle
Cheese to that Columbian Connection, from that cross-the-water section
Baby nine-seventeen, try for protection
Injection of that shit I'm kickin', got you stickin' niggas you got love for
Bring 'em up, touch 'em with the buzz saw
Bitches slingin' rocks, swingin' Glocks
Bringin' knocks, holdin' down the fort even when it's steamin' hot
Money's being got but honeys actin' shady
So I hit it with 5 between the 380's, can't fox a 300 Mercedes
Time like this bring out the savage and shit
Bitches ain't keepin' it real, so I'm damagin' shit
I'm on that scavenger shit, and I'm hungry
Fox with the Dog, it's about to get ugly (for real)

[Hook: DMX & Foxy Brown]
Ya bitches suck a dick
Ya niggas eat a clit
Yeah, you think you fuckin' slick?
Ya niggas ain't shit
Ya bitches suck a dick
Ya niggas want this bitch
You think you fuckin' slick?

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown]
Nigga fuck you, eat a fat boy, do' I stacked on pussy
Platinum and lace, ain't no smile on my face
Shit, burn up by the waist, fuck him right to the safe
And tell him, crack the bitch before I blast his bitch
Ya know Na Na come through, dime-chicks, iced up
Minked out, rolly 6, light grey chrome 6
Go to ask, wanna fuck? Then throw the cash right
'Aye bitch needs some dick in they life
Make 'em cop you with rock or just copy some rocks
Take it all from his dumb-ass, slide on his bum-ass
I want some shit and I'm hungry, Dog with the Fox
It's about to get ugly

[Hook: DMX & Foxy Brown]
Ya bitches suck a dick
Ya niggas eat a clit
Yeah, you think you fuckin' slick?
Ya niggas ain't shit
Ya bitches suck a dick
Ya niggas want this bitch
You think you fuckin' slick?
