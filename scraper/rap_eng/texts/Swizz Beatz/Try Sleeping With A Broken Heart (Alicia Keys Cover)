[Verse 1]
Mhmmm
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way

[Post-Chorus]
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

[Verse 2]
Lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Feel me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, baby, you know that I'll always be in love
With you, right 'til the end

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way

Nah nah nah
Oh nah

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way
