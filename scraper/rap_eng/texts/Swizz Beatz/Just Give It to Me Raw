[Verse 1]
Straight bang up your head shit with
Phenomenal swing like the ass on a black chick
Fat dick to all of y'all niggas with whack clicks
Hoping they whip paper like a classic, low budget black flick
Last victim that I caught was fucking my last chick
She hit me off, nearly made me bust through my plastic
Took the loot that she had stashed in her panty elastic
She got from out my denim, little venom was fast, kid
Try to swindle a nigga by giving me putang
A new thang, chick wanted to fuck me to Wu-Tang
Thug chicks started criticizing my new slang
Started hitting the pussy the song from the wusang
Watch these rap niggas get all inside your guts man
My nuts hang, shorty stay abusing the love thang
Gotta camouflage my stash and loot like I'm Bruce Wayne
After my money gotta kick the bitch up like Liu Kang

[Chorus]
Ayo
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what we asking for
Oh yeah
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what we asking for
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Okay

[Verse 2]
Shorty took me on a ride like a cyclone
In my zone, strutting with an ass and a fly tone
Hold shorty like how I be holding my microphone
We thug romancing to the jazzy sound of a xylophone
Ass backwards I'ma stick you more than a cactus
Lay my thug willy actress across the mattress
Knock it off the earth axis and broken glasses
Continue when she make me bust blackberry molasses
Pussy made me feel like I was drugged up on morphine
My movie screen ass stacking more than we've all seen
Yo, chick 'bout to make me wile on her real hard
A real fraud, fuck I ever fucked with this ill broad
Chick still after my loot, she like, "What, son?"
Don't act dumb scheming on a robbery outcome
Come out from wherever you are and be outdone
Acting like you about something, and you ain't about none
Come on son! Thought the chicken head was a little rude
The wrong move making me whip it out like live dude
Fuck that trick tried to get at my hard-earned stack
Too many times, gotta put my foot in her ass crack
June for all of my niggas you know shit is all real
A chicken head to fuck your mans and cut him a side deal
Of all your prized possessions if you let her get yours
Bitch we keep it raunchy, everything will remain raw

[Chorus]
Ayo
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what you asking for
Oh yes
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what you asking for
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Okay
