[Intro]
You know, right now I miss someone that I love
Or fell in love with
I don't wanna cry or nothing but
I'mma just get straight to the story
I'm a 29 year old addict

[Verse 1]
What would you know?
What would you do?
If you had no control over what you pursue?
You talk yourself, tell yourself, baby
"I'm better than this"
All that I'm fighting
I don't wanna resist

[Chorus]
And so it persists
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss
An illusion of bliss
And so it persists
Like a bottomless kiss
An iIllusion of bliss
An iIllusion of bliss

[Verse 2]
Hey, I live in prison of blood and flesh
An easy way out is this high, I confess
So watcha lookin' at
What do you wanna say
You can't save me, baby
I don't wanna it no way

[Chorus]
And so it persists
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss
An illusion of bliss
And so it persists
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss

[Bridge]
See my life?
Ain't no easy road
I don't know which way to go
Won't somebody see me when I can't see myself
Won't somebody listen before I need help
I'm sick of being judged
I'm sick of being sick
Tell me where's the love
I'm tired of being tricked
Sick of being high, sick of being low
Sick of all the lies
Putting on a show
And so it persists

[Chorus]
And so it persists
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss
An illusion of bliss

[Outro]
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
