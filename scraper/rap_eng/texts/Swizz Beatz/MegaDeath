[Hook: Swizz Beats & Remy Ma]
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
No hating ass niggas gon take my shit
No hating ass niggas gon take my shit
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
No hating ass bitches gon take my shit
No hating ass bitches gon take my shit

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Riding through New York with no motherfucking tints again
Hip hop police done got him on the list again
There them niggas go, black hoodies and them chimps again
If the homie miss you once, he ain’t gon miss again
Oriental diamonds on the link, like Michigan
Old money tall, hit the club, buying Cris again
Playing like the bulls, played the fool like Rich and them
Broke, got rich, got poor, got rich again
Now we the hottest, ducking the blue Impala
Nah, wear no Prada, links, you see no collar
Took cold pennies and I turned em to a dollar
Told Frank I was loyal, he called me Montana

[Hook: Swizz Beats & Remy Ma]
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
No hating ass niggas gon take my shit
No hating ass niggas gon take my shit
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
No hating ass bitches gon take my shit
No hating ass bitches gon take my shit

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Yo, R E M Y, stay fresh, been fly
Fully automatic, all these other bitches semi
You’ll pop like soda, ho I pop like July
This bitch is the fake truth, when the fuck y’all gon realize
I’m the uno, single one that own you
You the same old thing, I cop and clone you
Boost, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, phone you
You’re not my friend, my kin, my bitch, my homie, no
I don’t know you, I don’t owe you shit
Like 2000 in the mall, bitch I blow you quick
See actually, I practically raised you bitches
I got a wallet in my pocket with your baby pictures

[Hook: Swizz Beats & Remy Ma]
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
No hating ass niggas gon take my shit
No hating ass niggas gon take my shit
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
No hating ass bitches gon take my shit
No hating ass bitches gon take my shit

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Soon as I step out my whip
Niggas start asking questions about my fit
If it ain’t about no paper, it’s not bout shit
Welcome home Remy Ma, had to shout my bitch
Never catch me in the trap house without my bricks
Never catch me in a gun fight without my sticks
Met a couple of your dogs, killed like Mike Vicks
Five heartbeats, yeah nigga, nights like this
Leave some bad honeys around, types I twist
Throw some extra money around for nights I miss
Might blow a little sour but I lights my piff
You a hater, have a party and invite my dick
What up?

[Hook: Swizz Beats & Remy Ma]
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
No hating ass niggas gon take my shit
No hating ass niggas gon take my shit
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
I’m about my shit, I’m about my clique
No hating ass bitches gon take my shit
No hating ass bitches gon take my shit
