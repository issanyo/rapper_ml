Let's go!

[Verse 1]
Look at what you do to me
Why you keep doin' it?
It's getting me gone

[Chorus:]
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?
I been tryin' to think of ways to tell ya no
Same time I been thinkin' I'd be crazy to let it go
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
You be talkin' somethin' good when you talkin' to me
I been trying to think of ways to tell ya no
Same time I'm thinkin' I'd be crazy to let ya go

[Verse 2]
Most just can run up on me
I meet them at the door
Me gettin' swept off my feet
That don't happen, no
Since you been comin' around
I been scramblin'
Steady switchin' up so much
My girls that know me
Got to let up
When we met up
You done got me in love
Couldn't say it
But the way it happened
Just let me know
The records I was spinnin'
I was missin' out
We ain't even traded kisses
But I'm feelin' so much fire in here

[Chorus]
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?
I been tryin' to think of ways to tell ya no
Same time I been thinkin' I'd be crazy to let it go
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
You be talkin' somethin' good when you talkin' to me
I been trying to think of ways to tell ya no
Same time I'm thinkin' I'd be crazy to let ya go
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?

[Verse 3]
Funny thing
I didn't wanna believe
Of a love that was free
If for a moment I could
So many disappointments
Had me feelin' somethin' like
I didn't have a reason I should
When we met up
You done got me in love
Couldn't say it
But the way it happened
Just let me know
The records I was spinnin'
I was missin' out
We ain't even traded kisses
But I'm feelin' so much fire in her

[Chorus]
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?
I been tryin' to think of ways to tell ya no
Same time I been thinkin' I'd be crazy to let it go
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
You be talkin' somethin' good when you talkin' to me
I been trying to think of ways to tell ya no
Same time I'm thinkin' I'd be crazy to let ya go
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?

[Bridge]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
What would you do?
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
What would you do?
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
What would you do?

[Chorus]
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?
I been tryin' to think of ways to tell ya no
Same time I been thinkin' I'd be crazy to let it go
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
You be talkin' somethin' good when you talkin' to me
I been trying to think of ways to tell ya no
Same time I'm thinkin' I'd be crazy to let ya go
Boy, the way you do me
Boy, the way you do me
Why you gotta be so good when you give it to me?
