[Intro]
You are now tuned into the one man band man
Swizzy!
You are now tuned into the one man band man
I mean, whichever you want me to do, man
I'ma open up a store, you know why?

[Hook]
I got that product man, I got that product man
I got that product man, you know I got that product man
Beats, hooks, loops, no samples
I got that product man, I serve it up
I got that product man, call me the product man
I sell it on the strip, something like narcotics man
I got that product man, I got that product man
Beats, hooks, loops, and samples

[Verse 1]
I don't need no introduction
Came in the game at sixteen years old
I had that product man
And all they wanted man
One man band man, I get it in
Man, I made em' stop drop
Then I made em' yell "Jigga"
Niggas who that Nigga?
Nigga what you figure?
I been on my grind all the time with that product man
It's that me, certified approved, man
