Put your hands up when they turn up the bass
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
(Hey, Oh, Hey)

[Verse 1]
Oh my, stay on the grind
Everything will be mine, including you mm
Got my eyes on the prize, wanna make you realize
My goal is the sky, it's what I do
Oh, I said that I would show
Everybody what they should already know
I grew up, stood up and now I’m ready to go
Ready set go
Ready to go
Ready set go
Ready to go go go
I'm ready to go go go

[Hook]
Put your hands up when they turn up the bass
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
(Hey, Oh, Hey)

[Verse 2]
Said I can't deny I get off at night
This world is all mine, but I'll share with you
I'll stay on the star and ride as far as I can and I'm never fall
Watch me soar
I said that I’m would show
Everybody, what they should already know
I grew up, I stood up, and now I'm ready 2 go
Ready, set, go
I'm ready to go
Ready, set, go
I'm ready to go go go
I'm ready to go go go

[Hook]
Put your hands up when they turn up the bass
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
(Hey, Hey, Oh, Hey, Hey)
