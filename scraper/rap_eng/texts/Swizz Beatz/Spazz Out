[Verse]

You better fall back
Nigga gone with all that
I'm a big dog, got no time for small cats
And I been known most of you guys is all rap
Hiding behind rhymes, disguised in all black
I'm in the endzone moving the chains winning the game
9 of 10 clones saying my name to get in the game
Wait a minute homes, first of all let it be known
I'm bout that business homes
So all that flexing and the lyin' you can kill it homes
You just a cub I'm a lion don't forget it homes
Listen I'm out your division homes
My name's written in stone on the throne that I'm sitting on
Long term like in Great Britian homes
Spitting strong, in a zone
On the microphone I'm sickest known
Everybody's ego I be pissin' on
Getting blown riding through the city on
Big Chrome sitting under something that you thought I couldn't fit on anyway
Let's say we cut to the chase and get straight to the knitty gritty homes
The way you bitch and moan like a broad you need titties on
And I'm straight don't get me wrong
Shawty I ain't into dudes
Talk about your music not about me in your interviews
Seem like every time I'm rapping I'm offending dudes
And I ain't even thought about you let alone mention

[Outro]
MLK, DJ Drama I just want these motherfuckers to know I don't need no goddamn mix-tape homes
Nigga I got 150 songs nigga
I got 150 songs on deck my nigga
I mean like on some real shit I'll give this shit to you if you want it
If you really, all you gotta say is Tip we miss you dog
Tip we wanna hear you dog
Then I'll goddamn throw some shit out there homes
But don't goddamn come comparing me to no goddamn nigga
Who done dropped 3 mix-tapes when I done dropped 7 albums nigga
I don't wanna hear this shit nigga!
Fuck you saying! Nigga my son got better songs than you nigga!
Aye dig on some real shit next time I hear another motherfucker
Comparing my album to a motherfucking mix-tape
I'm a walk up to you my nigga
And I'm a slap you with a stack of 50s
Think its a motherfucking game!!
Fuck a Mix-tape nigga!!!
