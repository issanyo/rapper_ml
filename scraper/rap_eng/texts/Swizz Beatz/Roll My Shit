[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Got niggas like, "Don't me and Spitta be rhymin' alike?"
Never, not on your life, you on thin ice
I'm at P.F. Chang's, I'm on shrimp fried rice
My name is my name, you know my name right
C-U-Double R-E-N-Dollar Sign-Y in the hell are we not signed
Your guess as good as mine, I gotta few offers
But you know how they do, they low ball ya
Izzle got a Impala
I'mma get one too cause I don't want to ask if I can borrow
His shit so I got my own
In front the club, block my car off with the cones
Don't let nobody get in my spot when I'm gone
I might come back around this bitch
Watch these hoes as they walk out
Tha'ts the only way to see what they really look like
Cause you can't trust the mother fuckin' club lights
I might, seek out something proper
Models twisted off Ciroc vodka
A fitted t-shirt, married to the Mob one
Kick game proper, super sky tops
Millionaire frames, tail blue aqua
Just my style, you can't ride in the Lotus
One question, baby can you roll this...

[Hook]
I need a bad bitch to roll my shit
I'm looking for a bad bitch to roll my shit
I can play the PlayStation while you roll my shit
Or I can write a rap while you roll my shit
I only let bad bitches roll my shit
I'm looking for a bad bitch to roll my shit

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
I'm in my '85 Chevrolet short bed
Bad as I want to, can't speed up
Cause the homegirl rolling the weed up
She roll 4 out a $50 bag of reefer
She called it the purple people eater
We got high started talking about threesomes
Told me about the time she was only fucking females
Broke it down into every single detail (Sheesh)
Babygirl save some of that for me
A day in the life of a New Orleans G
Don.t play with ya life in these New Orleans streets
I don.t start shit that.s why them girls love me
They know I'm chill, they know I'm real
Assassin with the gifts, Spitta dressed to kill
I will Pittsburgh steal your chick
But if she can't roll joints you can keep that bitch

[Hook]
I need a bad bitch to roll my shit
I'm looking for a bad bitch to roll my shit
I can play the PlayStation while you roll my shit
Or I can write a rap while you roll my shit
I only let bad bitches roll my shit
I'm looking for a bad bitch to roll my shit
