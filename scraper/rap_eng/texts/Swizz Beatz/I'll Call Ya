[Intro]
Hey, baby, I don't

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you
Body so sick, gotta get next to you
I've been waiting all night long to know your name
Everything about you girl I want
And you gotta know that
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you

[Verse 1]
Girl maybe we need to spend some time cause you got me gone, I'm so gone
And there will be no playing with your mind
Cause this here is more than before, this is real
I'm an 18 year old grown ass man tryna get in your life, let go of me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you
Body so sick, gotta get next to you
I've been waiting all night long to know your name
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you
Body so sick, gotta get next to you
I've been waiting all night long to know your name
Everything about you girl I want
And you gotta know that
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you

[Verse 2]
Most don't get all of that brain and the face is so flawless, she's such a beautiful girl
And every fantasy at night I dream about is all in you
If I try would you take me where you are?
That place that many won't ever get a chance to see
You've been so cold, maybe, if you let me
Your flame will be on again
Tell me what you want cause I won't sleep
I won't cheat, love me, it's all that you give

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you
Body so sick, gotta get next to you
I've been waiting all night long to know your name
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you
Body so sick, gotta get next to you
I've been waiting all night long to know your name

[Bridge]
I've been thinking 'bout the way
That I'm gon' take it down
Ain't no way that you would be in need
Cause you'd be all I'm thinking 'bout, ain't no way

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you
Body so sick, gotta get next to you
I've been waiting all night long to know your name
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script, later baby I'll call you
Body so sick, gotta get next to you
I've been waiting all night long to know your name

[Outro]
Know your name
To know your name
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script later baby I'll call you
Tell me what I gotta do
I mean
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script later baby I'll call you
