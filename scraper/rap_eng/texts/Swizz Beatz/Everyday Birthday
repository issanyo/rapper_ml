Watcha think you doing in here?  Girl, I got 100 bottles of that Rozay, hoes they always be in my ear
Girl, I got a problem solver, lean back and swallow

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
The party's in your glass, you fill it up until you hit the roof (woo, ah, woo, ah)
Now hit the dance floor that liquid courage always got you (woo, ah, woo, woo)
Now throw your hands up in the air, like I'm the life of the party party (woo, ah, woo, ah)
Like I'm the life of the party party, like I'm the life of the party party and just dance like a white girl (woo, ah, woo, ah)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda, ha!)

She dancing too but she killing that shit (yeah)
She acting like a white girl drunk
And she outta control but I'm feeling that bitch (woo)
Drop it like you owe it to me (owe it to me)
Give it to me like it's mine in the first place (in the first place)
Lady in the street, freak in the bed
Wild in the party, professional in the workplace (ow)
She independent and sexy I think I love her, man (I love her)
She keep it clean but get messy under the cover, man (dance like a white girl)
Dirty, yeah, you know it clap your ass
If you dirty and you know it, clap your ass
She know how to do it like she the one who taught the class
That thing so fat I need somewhere to sit my glass
It's got a whore-a-million uses and I get all the exclusives
And damn, that body so ruthless, now dance to what Swizz producing

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
