[Chorus]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

[Verse 1]
Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write with the light from the lamp on my night stand
With my pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand
Codeine in a Sprite can, ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne, and wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might
Cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan and I'm sure like white sand
That they'll be price paying before my flight land
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
Adore so I can't ignore what I want anymore
So I just go you can call me the goer
And oh, yeah, I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And uhm, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
And yeah, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore, page one

[Chorus]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

[Verse 2]
Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write you this letter, I hope everything's grand
I hope everyone's good, I hope everybody's praying
I hope, hold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit, Anne
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And everytime I look there's a problem with this man
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
Anne, I'm trying to stay up out them chicks' pants... but I just can't
But on another note, this ain't just another note
This is more than a rap, this is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
And I'm just hoping that you read this far, page two

[Chorus]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

[Verse 3]
Dear Anne, my number one fan
By now, you probably think that I'm portraying who I'm saying
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him but I am
And it's people like you that make me proud of what I am
Hey, you are the shit, damn, pardon the gram'
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
And shit, when my life is like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there, lions, horses and rams
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to begin
I just think of you then I'm rewarded again, Anne
With you is where my artistry can, Anne
So with you is where a part of me stands, Anne
I hope I see you in the stands, Anne
Because you know I understand, Anne
And I'm sorry about Stan
So I wrote this to say that I'm your number one fan

[Chorus]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
