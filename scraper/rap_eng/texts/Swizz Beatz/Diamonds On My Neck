[Hook: Biggie Smalls] x3
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
I'm smoking pounds of green, smoking pounds of green
Smoking pounds of green, smoking pounds of green

[Verse 1: Smitty]
Where them trees at? Where them ki's at?
Where my G's at? Where my-where my G's at?
So fresh though, n-nothing less though
All grey Impala, big dollas like cred tho
Where them E's at, where them P's at?
Said you need that, where my where my cheese at?
L-let's go, watch full of crystals
Hands on the model, with a bottle full of X-O
Got 2 or 3 dimes in the back-back
Got 2 or 3 rounds in the tech-tech
Bought 23's round on that S-S
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds-diamonds on my necklace

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Smitty]
Where them low ridas, where them poofs at?
Where my roof at, where my-where my roof at?
And yea I thought so, switched like I'm hot tho
Say you gettin money like me, but you not tho
Where them 4-5's, where them trey's at?
Where them K's, where my-where my K's at?
Just got those, just from the box tho
Red mark means enemies pay a lotto
And you can hear it in the back-back
The beat pounds like the sound of a mack-mack
Ay we ain't playin around nigga that's that
Diamonds on my neck, diamond-diamonds on my necklace

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Smitty]
I'mma tell you what that nigga told me
Mouth full of golds don't make you no G
Got beef wit em, now we gon see
If the gang wanna bang, I'mma play KG
What it's gon be?(be) Got an OZ (Z)
Drop down, top down, blowin AC
Live in the back, black tee crisp
Diamonds on my neck, diamond-diamonds on my necklace
