[Introduction: Swizz Beatz]
Woo, Swizzy, need y'all to take y'all rags out man
And let it swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing

[Hook : Swizz Beatz]
Alright (alright), okay (okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright (alright), okay (okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air

[Verse 1: T.I.]
New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag
Full of stacks, rubber bands, round big cash
Got a sick swag 'til the haters get mad, come on
We in the club, Holmes, getting our thug on
Bottles of Patron, if you're grown, get your buzz on
We brought the broads out and brought the cars out
I'm like the moon, I shine and bring the stars out
When it's dark out, get the squad out
We ball hard, sucker nigga, eat your heart out
I'm too advanced, super swag in my Louis pants
Balling on my Louis silk shirt, match my Louis rag

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Alright (alright), okay (okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright (alright), okay (okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I say, "Whoa kemosabe," big balling is my hobby
I'm bopping while I'm walking, rag falling out my pocket
If big money ain't the topic, homie, I ain't even talking
Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses
Catch me flossin at the mall, talking to a broad
She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball
Three pairs of shoes, four shirts, six rags
The chick said, 'Dag, that's more than my bag'
Shorty, I can show you how to spend this bread real fast
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast
Silk scarf's hanging out of my jeans
No, homie, I ain't thinking, I'm just doing my thing!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Alright (alright), okay (okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright (alright), okay (okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I took some time off, and now I'm back y'all
You're in the line at the club, I'm in the back, dog
And when this song's on, ballers peel stacks off
And make it rain on them broads, watch them stacks fall
Let it sag with your pants, get your swag just right
Ride Bankhead, flares flying out the Benz
Once a fool with it, we're gon' bring them out again

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Alright (alright), okay (okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright (alright), okay (okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
