[Verse 1]
Same old story back again
'She's not a lover, she's just a friend'
I'm sick and tired for you to blame on me
Now you think it's funny
Now you wanna spend your money on girls
But you forgot when you were down that I was around
Call my lover, hang up, call again
What in the world is happening?
Listen in, but don't yell at me
Isn't it ironic? All you wanna do is smoke chronic
Boy, you forgot when you were down who was around

[Chorus]
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore)

[Verse 2]
Memories don't live like people do
I'm sick for ever believing you
Wish you'd bring back the man I knew
Was good to me, oh, lord
Everytime you say you're coming
Boy, you disappoint me, honey
How well you forgot when you were down
And I was around

[Chorus]
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore (oh, no, no)
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore)
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore)

[Bridge]
One of these days, it's gonna happen to you
Missing a love like I'm missing you, babe, yeah, yeah
One of these days, when your dreams come true
That's the one that's gonna do it to you
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore, yeah, yeah)
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore (you anymore)
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore (miss you)
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
