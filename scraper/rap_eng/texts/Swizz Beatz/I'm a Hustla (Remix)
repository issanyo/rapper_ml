[Cassidy]
Check it, you can fear or respect it
I wanna thank Hov for clearing the record (aight)
If you don't like this song right here, then your ears infected
You need to get your hearing corrected
Stones clear in the necklace, I wear so much plat on my neck
It put bruises on the back of my neck, that's why cats is upset
But I told you I'mma shine when its time to
I put too much time in and I been rhymin since nine two
I knew "I'm a Hustla" was a hit
Cause everything I ever got I had to hustle to get
Ain't nobody give me nothing for free
But I'd probably be dead or in jail if it wasn't for T
Gettin booked is a bitch and catchin a slugs, scary
I need to feed my seed, thanks for the love Mary
But seein me without the grams on the grind
Is like seein' Wesley Snipes in the tanning salon

I'm... the Hustla (the Hustla...) (yeah)

[Hook x3]

[Cassidy trynna make dudes do a hustla dance]
Do that dance, do that dance
If you a hustla then do that dance
Yeah, let's go
Do that dance, do that dance
If you a hustla then do that dance
Yeah, let's go
Do that dance, do that dance
It ain't a bunch of frontin' in here (yeah)

[Mary J.]
Gotta hold my man down
We ain't playin around
Got his back at all
If you a hustla then do that dance
Yeah, let's go

[Mary J. and beat fades out]
