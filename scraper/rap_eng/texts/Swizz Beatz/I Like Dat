All my ladies in the place with the real hair

Hit the dance floor girl, do your freaky freaky dance
Take the dance floor girl, do your freaky freaky dance
Hey, ho, I like that

Hey, ho, I like that
Hey, ho, I like that

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
The way you do that dance in the club, yeah I like that
You belong on stage where the lights at
You belong on the runway, dressed like a model
I ain't talkin' where the planes take flight at
Girl, you make me wanna sing or somethin'
Take you home, tryna get you outta them jeans or somethin'
Your sex make your ass wanna fein for somethin'
Go straight, and you ain't never gon' need for nothin'
Do your freaky dance, girl we all up in the club
Touchin' on you, rubbin' on you, feelin' on your butt
Get a little, take a little, show a little love
I'm a big squirrel tryna get a big butt

[Hook: Swizz Beatz & Trey Songz]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ay what it is girl, we just howin' out
All that dough, I got you make me wanna throw it out
I don't even really care if you're a whore or not
Hey, hol' up shawty, don't be mad, I'm just jokin' now
Your waist is so small, ass pokin' out
There's somethin' in my pants, think you outta know about
I see the way you dance, how you drop it down
Ay, you know what I do to you when ain't nobody around
But just be cool, you know everybody watchin' now
You got a man, he a fool if he's not around
Ay here my number, you can hit me when he's not in town
When you need somethin', holla, you know I got it now
High yellow, light brown, pretty long hair
Just how I like, they see me starin', shawty I don't care
5 feet tall, maybe 4'10
Ay, how you stay so thick when you so thin?
Tight jean got that cameo cole showin'
G string make a nigga wanna go in
Came all by yourself, brought no friend
Well, what you hesitatin' for? Let's go
