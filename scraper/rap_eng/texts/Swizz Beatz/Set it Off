[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
Aiyyo, ridin with my burner, rollin with my earner
L.I.E. Expressway bangin that Uncle Murda
BULLET BULLET!!! I rep New York to the FULLEST FULLEST!!!
I got guns, don't think I won't PULL IT PULL IT!!!
Gat off safety, dudes won't face me
Both of them hoes like, Cagney & Lacey
And N.O.R.E. (YEP!!) I'm respected in the projects
Filled out my O.G. card, it's in the process
I used to get a pass, now I give a pass (Ha!)
And got a gun that go RAH!!!! like summer splash
Thug club music that you listen to late
Yep! That's that style that I helped create, tell 'em Swizz!

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
Aiyyo we got the Patron, Hennesey, Cranberry and Vodka
Mami down for takin on poppa
Opa locka, where I buy that
No heroin cocaine, no I never try that
I just fly pass, thinkin 'bout, gettin a bypass
Surgery, stomach and small ass
Bitches with small ass, go tell your managers
N.O.R.E.'s in the building with keys they call me janitors
Go hard, sort a feel like a slave
And even on the block when it rain like meter maids
Cause, I heard that Peter paid Paul from a jena maid
But if he didn't pay me, he would see the grave!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 3: J. Russ]
Swizzy! Let me jump on this track and get busy
N.O.R.E. man I got you let me roll up the splizzy
Good grippy, that's all I expect
Now I'm a set it off like I'm Ron Artest
Now who you with hey we the best! But this ain't Khaled
This your boy J. Russ from Palm Beach!
Let the boy set it off with them big choppers
And you can have it your weay like a fuckin whopper
Or matter of fact nigga pop a double sack
Two for twenty five you be rollin like a cadillac
It's for them big guns that have your ass jumpin back
It's time to set it off nigga where the money at?!
