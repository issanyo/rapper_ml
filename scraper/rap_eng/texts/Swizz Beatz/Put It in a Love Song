All that talk, and boy you better walk it
All that front and that's not how you do it
If you really need me like you say you need me

What you gonna do when somebody convinces
Me to believe that he can do it better
Send me gifts and showin me the romance
All this this and that, can you do better?
All I'm saying love is what I'm looking for
If you wanna keep me, baby gotta love me more
If you really want me, like you say you want me
If you really need me, baby better come and say

Say you love me, say you love me
Then put it in a love song

Say you love me, say you love me
Then put me in a love song
