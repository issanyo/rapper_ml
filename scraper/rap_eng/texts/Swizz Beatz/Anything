(Verse 1)
Where I'm at
You don't always know, this is you keepin' track
I won't ever trick out giving you the facts
There won't ever be any need to dispute
Whether or not I'm tellin' the truth
Cause I am

(Hook)
And I ain't got a thing to hide, no
Despite my reputation, yeah
Even though it's the world that I live in
You know that I'm with you

(Chorus)
So what you wanna know girl I'll reply
You'll get every detail I ain't gonna lie
As long as you can promise you'll do the same
Girl I will tell you everything, you can ask me anything

(Verse 2)
Who I'm with
Even if it happens to be some other chick
It's only business babe
So things don't need to trip
Baby you can come too
See it's whatever you like, you can choose, oh girl

(Hook)
Cause I ain't got a thing to hide, no
Despite my reputation, yeah
Even though it's the world that I live in
You know that I'm with you

(Chorus)
So what you wanna know girl I'll reply
You'll get every detail I ain't gonna lie
As long as you can promise you'll do the same
Girl I will tell you everything, you can ask me anything

(Swizz Beats)

Music please....
Let me clear my throat
Slippers and a robe, while we on that boat

Matchin APs, yea that sound dope
Came from Aspen
We ridin in the Aston
Martin baby
Wit' the Margella tux
Don't' worry about it, cause to me it's small bucks
Five minutes, I could have you superstar status
Ten minutes I could have you global status
Autobahn express
Don't worry bout nothing I got the rest
And that other dude is old now
Let the music touch your soul child

(Musiq)
Anything you need to be a little more comfortable
I'm wit' it
So keep the drama to yourself
Just quit it, yea
I'm way to grown to keep secrets
I'm way to grown
So I'll leave you alone

(Chorus)
So what you wanna know girl I'll reply
You'll get every detail I ain't gonna lie
As long as you can promise you'll do the same
Girl I will tell you everything, you can ask me anything

Take every piece of information
See you can have it all
I ain't gon' front
As long as you can promise you'll do the same
Girl I will tell you everything, you can ask me anything

(Swizz Beatz)
