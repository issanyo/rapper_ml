Intro:
Ughhh
Ayo
These niggas is crazy baby
They can't fuck wit da dog (ya know)
Yo Swizz
Swizz (my nigga)
Swizz, Swizz, Swizz
Another one? (Swizz)
Another one? (Another one?)
Are we being greedy??? (Uh, Swizz, Swizz)
Or what???
I don't think so
Uh

Come on baby like you don't know the streets is (uh)
Too bad they'll find yo body but in pieces (uh), cuz the beast is
On some real cruddy shit, about to split yo wig with some bloody shit
I ain't dropping nothing but that ugly shit (come on)
Bite yo head like I tried yo man, cause what u saying is nothing (uh huh)
Must really think I'm playing, but I'll be laying while you bluffing
Look out, they don't let that crook out I took out
Enough of yo family to have a fucking cookout (uh)
For one time we get together (uh) is it when everyone get hit together
Or when I'm in the tan just before they hit the leather
I'm a say it so I know how much strength is left
And curse all who will breathe in the stench of death (uh huh)
Though after the sixth day I'm buried, I will rise
And bomb the fluid in my veins and blood in my eyes (uh, uh)
And them guys that was laughing, don't even smile anymore
How many 4 pound rounds can yo ass indulge?
20 more of that raw strip to the flesh (what?!)
1000 pounds of pressure, shit that rip through the vest and pull yo chest open
So what the Ruff Ryder posed to do when you fronting?
Give u niggas what u wanting, mufucka...nothing!!
