[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
Get your motherfucking hands in the air!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
You can hate me, I don't care!

[Verse: R. Kelly]
All y'all wanna powl on me, make it hard for me to breathe
Throw sand in my eyes, make it hard for me to see
Out of breath, can't see, still hard to defeat
The history that I made, impossible to impeach
First round, spread rumors, point fingers, throw stones, judge me
Hate me, love me, hug me, curse me
Whatever, 'cause y'all fucking opinions don't feed me
I'm clever, enough to know that the industry needs me
Second round, I'm opposite of the demon that faces me
I've been through hell lived in the belly of the beast
I've confessed my sins but still didn't find peace, but
Like MJ in five, I will six-peat
Third round, I make music from the hood 'cause that's where I'm from
That's why the hood is always first to help me overcome
Fifth round, when I'm down, some of y'all cats act so strange
When I'm up, same cats wonder why I act so strange
Sixth round, Kells done changed, please you bitches is so lame
Something ain't your fault and y'all so quick to blame
That's why I got number one in the back of my Range
Y'all cats is foreplaying, I'm pregnant by the game
Seventh round, some would like to see balled and chained
But I'm a child of God so my destiny is all day
Eighth round, undisputed is the title I claim
'Bout to shoot the world up with this lyrical cocaine
Ninth round, the place is packed
The bell rings I'm about to bring the pain
Left jab, right hook, shutting down your brain
Tenth round, I could be surrounded by lions in the mist of the jungle
And still I'ma rumble your many rumble, eleventh round

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
Get your motherfucking hands in the air
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
You can hate me, I don't care
