If I ask the question who the best
And I don’t hear you the best
Then fuck you and whoever that you suggest
He kinda’ dope but I’m the G.O.A.T., screw the rest
My su depressed, waiting up-state calling his boo collect
It went from who the nicest with their fist to who can shoot the best
But when you hold the bisquit they even told ya business
Soon as I got showed the business, I was making gwop
Drove down the road to riches but I had to make a stop
Who tryna’ make it pop, cooking tryna’ make it lock
I’m tryna’ eat fast but I ain't [?]
And I ain't imitating Pac, doing impressions of Big
I’m the greatest alive but no disrespect to the dead
Of course my patience is short but my weapon is big
Disconnect this nigga neck from his head, for disrespecting the kid
Soon as the sun rise the gun rise
Wake up with the biscuit in ya mouth that’s called breakfast in bed
You can’t mess with the kid, niggas know I been nice as shit
Since BNO at the depo on some cypher shit
If life a bitch, how this a mans world then
Without ladies we can’t make babies in the world then
I got that white girl bringing that white girl in
So every night I sleep with my wife and my girlfriend
What ya’ll shocked bars hot as a [?]
My shit hard
Them niggas soft as a baby girls skin
You don’t even know where ya girl been
Phone calls, texting her about the direct message
Yeah phone off, yeah I’m getting blown off
Having sex with her, and the freak lying next to her
What you upset with her
I keep the Heckler, on my waist for safety
But I don’t keep the safety on it, that’s kinda’ crazy
I don’t live in the same hood where my mom raised me
Cause that ain't where I’m tryna’ raise my baby mom babies
Move on to bigger and better is what the boy do
Ya’ll niggas wish y'all could move, but y'all can’t afford to
Get to the chicken I sure do, seriously
But I could be making more yearly it’s a conspiracy
They be comparing me to niggas with the nicest flows
And be comparing you to niggas with the tightest clothes
Your flows hot no it’s sh not, wipe ya nose
You tryna’ blow with hand me down down bars, recycled flows, wow
Ya girl can blow she got mic control
She let the king pop and got that work like Michael nose, woah
I hate probation I don’t like parole
The time I did in CFCF had me stressed
We blessed, I’m free yes, that case was some BS
I’m innocent but had to sit cause didn’t say who did the shit
Some days your gonna eat, some days you gonna starve
But AR could of called my phone instead of doing a vlog
But that’s the past AB hit me and apologised
He was tired of going to jail, he was tryna’ monopolize
They say life full of nothing but blessings
I wish the whole OBH the best nothing but blessings
I’ma make another confession, last battle my bars was up
Dizaster had [?] bad reception
If it’s a white mans world
I got that white man and that white mans girl
Same fucking complexion
I’ma nice with the pen MC
A dude with nude pics of your chick in his DM MC
Yo MMG, I ain't tryna’ hate on your team
Cos Meek made Mills still out here chasing the dreams
So I basically mean, I’ma leave up to Meek to decide
The beef can die unless he keep it alive, Ah
The pool shark moving white balls here
In a truck sitting high like a lifeguard chair
Ya clothes tight like a lifeguard gear
I don’t like ya’ll queers, ya’ll should get somebody to wife ya’ll queers, yeah
What I spit could have you confused yo, but you know
Bread men get flipped when they lose dough, it’s cool yo
My new hoe pop bottles, pop bottles
.. Listen.. Listen
My new hoe bar tend and pop bottles
I don’t trust .. that mouth she got
A couple twirk vids that got her a lot of follows
But the gram make that damn chick think she a top model
A Spanish chick looking like Shakira
And the stones got a stone like Medusa looking in the mirror
The movies said I can’t wear my jewellery in the theatre
I gotta take my ice off before they cut the lights off
Sometime a nigga might floss cos I’m still a
I bald since back in the day like Gill cuts
A rapper nowadays that’s real tough
Real hard to find like a chick that strip with a real butt
Yup I’ma never give a fuck again
Cosmic this gonna be the best Come Up Show until I come up again
.. Yeah.. Yeah
I start shit that could make a dinosaur heart skip
[?], Tyrannosaurus, Jurassic Park shit
I took ya bitch off the bus, on some Rosa Parks shit
We on the yacht I’m making in rain on some Noah’s Ark shit
Chain on some glow in the dark shit
So I smashed ya hoe, that thot got a nice body
But the bitch plastic though
Run in ya crib, let the ratchet blow
Shoot ya and ya bitch, I don’t know if they make double bed caskets though
I did a lot of things in my life I can’t let the pastor know
I can’t see myself going broke but I wear glasses though

Yo, yo when you die you can’t buy ya life back
Lamar Odem tried to overdose to get his wife back
Yeah I iron fight fair, if you try to fight back
Take the knife, take ya life, and then take my knife back
Bars, 25 to life rap, a, you son facetime with me no skype app
Facts

First of all if I’m talking to a hoe, I’m busy what are these niggas talking to me for, yo
My body temperature is ultimately low
From the watch I just copped I got the forest and the snow
No I’m not a nature man
But my life a sky dive and I need a parachute to try to break the land
My pinky ring called break a hand, pebbles and the bezel all yellow
I think my watch a Lakers fan
When Puff had that show, Make The Band
I had cats in the trap moving packs tryna’ make a band
I’m more mature before I never gave a damn
Till I realised every hater could be made a fan
Somewhere in the world they probably hating man
But somewhere in the world a Muslim just ate a ham
You think you brave cause you blazed the can
It’s a man that’ll swim in a swamp and shake a Gator hand
Or stick his head in a Lion mouth
Your not the only one in the hood that’s pulling iron out
The same way that you shoot, niggas shoot too
Them niggas that shot at before, gon’ probably shoot you
When I was young my older heads said do you
A cat that spit like you do ain't gonna drive an Isuzu
And don’t do what them other dudes do
Look taking a different path will get you that different cash
And high school was something I ain't get to pass
Cause I was skipping class with [?] to get some ass
And saying these rap cats sick as Cass
Is like saying defensive linemen could miss a pass
I’m in my bag, I think I could outlive [?] and outrun that kid the flash
I’m joking, but I got super incredible bars, I bet whatever that I’m better than ya’ll
And I’m willing to bet anybody betting on ya’ll, but pay me
Before I go crazy and get weapons involved
I told my sons hit niggas if they messing with ya’ll
And if you hit em’ in they chin then they a definitely fall
You a gangster, you shouldn’t have respect for the law
But a gangster gotta die or pay his debt to the law
Them niggas with me better pay respect to em all
Or you’ll have plastic surgeon resetting your skull
I done popped all them thots that you had sex with before
If she bad and I ain't fucked, I ain't met her before
Do you know your alphabet, well I’m the letter before
H, a straight G, you can’t mess with the bul
Did I ever lose a battle, never before
I spit the best bars ever put together before
Saying that you heard a nigga spit it better before
Is like saying you seen a gown man pregnant before
BARS
Let’s get to it man
Philly stand up man
I know ya’ll jumped on other niggas backs, ya’ll thought a lot of other niggas had it
They even had me a little convinced I thought other niggas had it
But ya’ll can jump back on my back, ain't nobody messing with me
I don’t care what city they from, what state they from
How many time they been a jail
I don’t care who they girl is
How tight or how lose their clothes is
What colour they die their hair
I don’t care how many boxing footages they put up
I don’t care how many followers they got on the gram
Ya’ll know line for line, bar for bar I’m the best
And I’ma leave it like that
Philly stand up
Mayhem Music, ya’ll already know how I go man
Shout out to everybody that always had love for me, shout out to Cosmic Kev for holding me down man
Let’s get to it

Uh.. Listen..

They call me a asshole but I don’t give a shit
I murder beats my homies produced, I’m inconsiderate
Split ya head to the white meat, but I’m on some other shit
Sell work and yell in the church, I’m a hypocrite
You tryna’ get a brick and go hit the strip
Me I sell fish scale on a fishing trip eating fish and ribs
Na I mean, the fiends on some addictive shit
That’s a fact, wherever it’s at they gonna go and get that shit
I got guns so big I can barely lift the shit
Got a sick .. gotta stand when I try and spit the shit
You ever look a ratchet in the face
I don’t fuck with you little pussy’s that’s statutory rape
Wait, my bank account used to be extra small
But now my pockets fat no calories or cholesterol
I never have respect for ya’ll
You never know who gonna get smacked next time I’m standing next to ya’ll

Ahh.. Bars
