Time up Hold up Wait a minute now

Time up Hold up Wait a minute now
Gotta let u know how a playa feeling now
If u wanna leave, do what you gotta do
But we know that ain't what u wanna do

We got too much time and history
To let a mistake come in between
To let a mistake come in between
You and me
You and me

You want me to get down on my knees
Look i'm getting on my knees
You want me to beg, i'm beggin
Girl don't you, Girl don't you

(Chorus (Repeat 2x))
Don't Quit (on me)
Don't quit (on me)
Don't Quit (on me)

Keep Fussing (at me)
Keep Cussing (at me)
Keep Fighting (with me)
But don't quit on me girl

Don't Quit (on me)
Don't quit (on me)
Don't Quit (on me)

Don't give up (on me)
Don't give up (on me)
Not Ever
Don't Quit on me never

I know u mad at what i did
I know u sick with what i did
But it won't happen again i swear
You never ever shed a single tear
Let's make up so we can get it on
Cuz you cussing me out, it turns me on
You cussing me out, it turns me on
Turns me on
Turns me on (Ohhhhh)

You want me to get down on my knees
Look i'm getting on my knees
You want me to beg, i'm beggin
Girl don't you, Girl don't you

Don't Quit (on me)
Don't quit (on me)
Don't Quit (on me)

Keep Fussing (at me)
Keep Cussing (at me)
Keep Fighting (with me)
But don't quit on me girl

So let's make up
(Ba da dum da da da)
By making love
(ba da dum da da da)
All night
(Ba da dum da da da)

So let's make up
So let's get it together (By making love)
And make up under the covers
(All night)
U and me we forever

Girl don't you, Girl don't you
Don't Quit (on me)
Don't quit (on me)
Don't Quit (on me)

Keep Fussing (at me)
Keep Cussing (at me)
Keep Fighting (with me)
But don't quit on me girl

(Repeat till end)
