(J.D. talking)
J.E. y'all, uh, J.D. y'all, that's me
Swizz Beats, come on

(Chorus - Jagged Edge)	            (J.D. talking with chorus)
What is yours and mine		    Yeah, uh huh
Break this up, none of that stuff   This right here
What is yours and mine              Is a story about a nigga
Work too hard, way too much         wit a lot of paper
What is yours and mine              Ha, ha, and his girl
Whatever you won't, can't stop us   See, when you gotta lot man
What is yours and mine              It ain't shit if you can't share it
Me and you, what is yours and mine  You understand what I'm saying

(Verse 1 - Jermaine Dupri)
Listen, uh, I remember when we first hooked up you was only 17
Cut off shirts and jeans, was ya only way seen
What I had didn't matter, it was all about us
All day on the phone and the stuff we discussed
I used to come over when ya mom's was gon' (Oow)
We ain't know what we were doin' but we got our freak on
And one thing lead to another, I introduced you to my mother
Like, Ma, this my girl, that's when it started gettin' real
Feelings stared gettin' caught, gifts stared gettin' bought
And everybody knew the deal
We used to hang out, kiss, argue, and all that
Hang up the phone and call right back
I got to know you like the back of my hand
And, you got to show me hoe a girl love a man
And, we took a small thing to a new land
And when I say I love you, I wanted you to understand

[Chorus - Jagged Edge and (Jermaine Dupri)]
What is yours and mine (Uh huh, yo)
Break this up, none of that stuff (Listen to me baby)
What is yours and mine (Uh huh)
Work too hard, way too much (See, we worked too hard)
What is yours and mine (Yo, listen to me baby)
Whatever you won't, can't stop us (Yeah)
What is yours and mine (Yeah)
Me and you, what is yours and mine (Me and you)

(Verse 2 - Jermaine Dupri)
The older we got, everybody said y'all gon' change
But when 2-1 came, we was still in the game
92's new version of, Bonnie and Clyde
No matter what it was, we was side by side
You know the type you see gettin' in the photo booth
Matchin' shirts, flea market, photo shoots
Everything I saw cute, shit, you had to have it
What's a fly life if a nigga can't share it
Every new dollar made, I put it on you
Hit the Porsche dealership shit, nigga bought two
And when I went away, I got ya named tattooed
A yo, I try to put the big bling on ya hand
Cause uh, you show me how a girl love a man
And, we took a small thing to a new land
And when I say I love you, I wanted you to understand, it's real

[Chorus - Jagged Edge and (Jermaine Dupri)]
What is yours and mine (Yeah, uh huh)
Break this up, none of that stuff (Uh. listen to me baby)
What is yours and mine (Uh)
Work too hard, way too much (We worked too hard)
What is yours and mine (Listen to me baby)
Whatever you won't, can't stop us
What is yours and mine
Me and you, what is yours and mine

(J.D. talking with last two lines of chorus)
Yo all my niggas that understand what I'm saying
Look ya girl in the eyes and say

(Verse 3 - Jagged Edge)
Girl you so off the chain (Off the chain)
You took a playa straight out the game (Straight out the game)
Now I know what a good thing feel like (Feels good x4)
I know, I gotta have it in my life
Gotta playa messed up inside (Up inside)
Made a nigga just wanna do right (Do right)
Me and you is like Dre and Snoop Dogg (Dre and Snoop)
Long as we together we can have it all

(J.D. talking)
Ha, know what I'm talkin' bout
When you love her man, sing to her man
It ain't shit, man you know what I'm sayin', ball on

Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Now ride out
