[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so arrogant and bold
But she gone love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!

[Outro]
This is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and I won't let you go
This is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and I won't let you go
