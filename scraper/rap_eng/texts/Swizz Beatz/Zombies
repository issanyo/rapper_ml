[Intro: Nas]
Escobar Season returns
Let it burn

[Hook x2: Swizz Beatz & Nas]
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This the bath-salts song, motherfuckers act like Zombies when it come on
It's that cut-throat, cut-throat, kill shit
Coke, weed, dealer shit, this that real shit

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
It's the business, [?] a sponsor
Run up with your crew, cold as a monster
Yeah, they like me like that, every girl I see wanna be wifey like that
I'm the King of Zamunda, uh, King of the Summer
Come be my Kardashian, King of the Come Up, uh
To be loved, Shakespearean, experienced to be [??]
Jumping off boats, hopping off another cliff
Every six months, I think I need a new bucket list
Yeah, I think I might need a harem
I'm way too much, y'all can tell I'm a blessing
I'm feeling like a baron, all I need is a castle
Be my Halle Berry, all you need is a catsuit
All I need is Heaven, I don't want the hassle
God Bless the child that can hold his own... Act two

[Verse 2: Nas]
My instincts guide me through this Curtis Blow culture
Good angel, bad angel sittin' on both shoulders
Don't be trying to gas me, manipulate me
Tempt me, make me have no soul, so I had to [??]
Mr. Tunnel
Better tuck your chain in, it's a warning
Goons swarming

[Hook x2: Swizz Beatz & Nas]
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This the bath-salts song, motherfuckers act like Zombies when it come on
It's that cut-throat, cut-throat, kill shit
Coke, weed, dealer shit, this that real shit

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Loyalty is something that you can never get enough of
Life’s a bitch, but you can’t snuff her
I'ma think about it, shit is only getting rougher
So it's better niggas die than suffer

[Hook x2: Swizz Beatz & Nas]
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit
This the bath-salts song, motherfuckers act like Zombies when it come on
It's that cut-throat, cut-throat, kill shit
Coke, weed, dealer shit, this that real shit

[Verse 4: DMX]
Shit pop off, we don't blow it up 'til we blow it up
Cats better slow it up, y'all niggas know what's up
My niggas throw it up; we all know that
In fact, niggas missing the action, where are they at?
See, you niggas never really been ducked out
But got enough mouth to get snuffed out; roof the rough route
We don't play around here, nigga, we're grown
Start applying pressure, give the dog a bone
I'm taking half; it's just that simple
Or I can start popping niggas like pimples
I'ma let you call it, you ballin'
'Til you get hit with them hot things, now you're staggering and fallin'
