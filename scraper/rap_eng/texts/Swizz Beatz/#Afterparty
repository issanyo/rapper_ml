(Now this is where we party party
Recollect get naughty naughty)
-X4-

HOOK-After the party oh will you still want me oh
After the party oh will you still want me oh
After the party oh will you still want me oh
... After
After the party oh will you still want me oh
After the party oh will you still want me oh
After the party oh will you still want me oh
... After

VERSE1-After the party I wanna fade Now look what I've become I've renegade
Is this conscious lifestyle just my fate supercuts in my memory I conjugate


CHORUS-Don't remind me of the things that I did
I already reap what I sewn when I was a kid
Screenshots migrate from events I rid
Relying on love that I’ve hid…

VERSE2-You were the highlight from what I remember You sent me invites no matter what the weather
And so when it came time to gather up my stuff You were leaving out the front door with all of my love

CHORUS-Don't remind me of the things that I did
I already reap what I sewn when I was a kid
Screenshots migrate from events I rid
Relying on love that I’ve hid…

BRIDGE-(Now this is where we party party
Recollect get naughty naughty)
-X8-

VERSE3-I normally never regret a thing
But your silence after stings
Don’t you hear the telephone ring?
There’s nothing left to string

HOOK-After the party oh will you still want me oh
After the party oh will you still want me oh
After the party oh will you still want me oh
... After
After the party oh will you still want me oh
After the party oh will you still want me oh
After the party oh will you still want me oh
... After
