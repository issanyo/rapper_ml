[Interlude: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to roam

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, I'm tryna get that Oprah (x4)
Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah
Paper, paper, paper, paper
Hova, Hova, Hova, Hova

[Verse 1]
Lamborghinis, no Gallardos, ridin' round full throttle
Murcielagos, look at my lights, God damn they look like goggles
See, she look like a model, I travel far, mami
I'm in Dubai, Abu Dhabi with Bugattis, mama

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 2]
Red Enzo, A million bucks
Look at my seats boy, They sewn like a tux
Louie this and Gucci that, That's that s**t that's on my back
My paper this, my paper that, why you think they looking like that

[Interlude: Chris Martin]

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 3]
Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, iPhones, Microsoft
My paper is very long, your paper is very short
I am a big boss, boy, get lost
My new Basque yacht, Hov' know what that cost
