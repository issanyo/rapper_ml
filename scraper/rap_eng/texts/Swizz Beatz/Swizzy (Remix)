[Intro]
This the remix baby, yeah!
Ya already know what it is
Cause if you don't you just don't know nothin
Shit, period! Stupid

[Verse]
You know me, I just be chillin in the Phantom, listening to opera
Gun is my bodyguard, call it Kevin Costner
Prolly won't stop if I get to poppin them shots
You niggas is sweeter than a box of Red Hots
Ha, fuck around, see a flock of red dots
Smoke good, eat good, only fuck a bitch
If her throat good, feet good, just bought a Fleetwood
And I'mma put some D's on that bitch
Looking like I got a diamond disease on my wrist
Fresh, bunch of little G's on my kicks
I'mma dog, you're all a bunch of fleas on my dick
Young Money, Cash Money
And we gon' get the money, even if it kills y'all
And I'mma ride til the muthafuckin wheels off
George Gervin, I'mma get my chill on
I'm cold, yeah I get my Buffalo Bill on
Beating up your block, yeah I get my Emmett Till on
In the New Edition, yeah I get my Johnny Gill on
Keep a shotgun, yeah I get my Jayson Will on
Fuck it Swizz, I'm still goin
Black entertainment, yeah I get my Steven Hill on
Only to talk models, yeah I get my Seal on
Make that chick rock, get my Amil on
Two girls, let em get they pill on
Let em get they feel on, I get my Tip Drill on
Hey, now why you that ice grill on
I leave you lookin like you got a barbecue grill on
Yeah, we got money to the ceilin
Real nigga, I get my Keep It Real on
And they be lying on wax, like a earphone
Weezy Baby, the best from here on
Swizz, I'm in gear homes
They in trouble, we gon' bubble like beer foam
No homo, let em get they queer on
No commercial, I just take the Leer home
My girl, she get her Pam Grier on
She don't touch me, I got cashmere on
I ball, and you just Erick Dampier, dawg
I'm dirty, I get my Bill Laimbeer on
Weezy the Beast, Swizzy the Monster, and we're gone

[Outro]
I'm stuffed
