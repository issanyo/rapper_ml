Bombs over Baghdad
Tryna get something we never had
Let's start with a good dad
It's so real but it's so sad
And while we're burning this incense
We gonna pray for the innocent
Cause right now it don't make sense
Right now it don't make sense
Let's talk about Chi-town
Let's talk about Gaza
Let's talk about, let's talk about Israel
Cause right now it is real
Let's talk about, let's talk Nigeria
And the mass hysteria, yeah
Our souls are brought together
So that we can love each other, brother

[Verse 2]
No guns made in Harlem
But yet crime is a problem
He wanna shine, they wanna rob him
Single mother, where they come from
How we gonna save the nation
With no support for education
Cause right now it don't make sense
Right now it don't make sense
Let's talk about our part
My heart to your heart
Let's talk about, let's talk about living
Had enough of dying
Not what we all about
Let's do more giving, do more forgiving, yeah
Our souls are brought together
So that we could love each other, sister
