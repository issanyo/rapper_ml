[Chorus:]
Ya know ya boy did that

Came through a new roof
I had to drop the ceilin'

Made a lil paper

Drunk about it big about it

Damn rite my ghouns gon' shoot{yea}
Damn rite my chicks look cute{yea
Damn rite im in dat coop {yea}
Hold up, lets talk about it be about it man

[verse 1:]
Ya got a lil paper and you think you all front, but it all means nothin to me
I mean ya got a lil Benz and ya top come off, but its all small stuff to me

I get my paper in Vegas, i get my paper in AZ
Niggas on the radio, the DJ play me
Its SWIZZY, busy, gets busy baby
Cookin in the kitchen, man i got that gravy

[Chorus:]
Ya know ya boy did that
Ya know ya boy did that
Ya know ya boy did that
Ya know ya boy did that

Man im four-wheelin'
Dont care about ya feelin's
Came through a new roof
I had to drop the ceilin'

Made a lil paper
Its off of drug dealin{yea yea yea}
Ya know ya boy did that

[verse 2:]
Man down but no cannons found
Thats how shit go from where im 'round
Niggettes will get CRAZAY, or get ??
Talk tough and then kidnap your baby
Coole' man, dont be a foole' man
See my boys, they'll hit you wit dat toole' man
See you dropped out, you shoulda stayed in schoole' man
You's a dumb-dumb, dont get foole' man
Its sweet i gotta eat, i guess i gotta creep
I was livin wit my lil bitch for a week
The bitch kicked me out, im at my other bitches house
These bitches wanna walk and wanna fuck when im at they house i got my gat and my snub, and my rubber glove
Quick to bust nigga cuz they ain't no love
Ain't no handshakes, and no hugs
The city im from is nothin but thugs {talk to me, talk to me}

[Chorus;]
You know the boy did that
You know the boy did that
You know your boy did that
You know your boy did that

Man im four-wheelin'
Dont care about ya feelin's
Came through a new roof
I had to drop the ceilin'

Made a lil paper
Its off of drug dealin

[Verse 3:]
1999, i did that
Took the hard street ?? and i did that {yep}
It all started from a little corner drink i turned that thing into a million dollar steam
Yea, you know the boy did that
I bought my first car i didn't know where to live at
But i got a little smarter
Got my peep game up and worked a little harder {woo!}
Then i flipped the game and then i
Raised the bar and then i raised my name
And then i raised my price then i did that right
Now im 96 million, ain't that right?
(i did it man)

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]
Ya know ya boy did that
Ya know ya boy did that
Ya know ya boy did that
Ya know ya boy did that

Man im four-wheelin'
Dont care about ya feelin's
Came through a new roof
I had to drop the ceilin'

Made a lil paper
Its off of drug dealin
Ya know ya boy did that
