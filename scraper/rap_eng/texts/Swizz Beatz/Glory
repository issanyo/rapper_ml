[Intro: Cam'ron]
One, one two
Check me the fuck out
I'm here now
Haha
I'm here now
Haha
Ya'll should have never let me in the motherfuckin' game b
They fucked up lettin me in Un
They done did it to they self man
Let me tell ya'll what's goin' down

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo
Eh yo, you see him
Cam in the BM
Wit the Koreans
The G.M
Wit land in Korea
Take the leer jet flight
When?
Thursday night
Overseas
Yo, a fuck up is worth they life
Huh, ya'll niggas heard me right
What, for that persian white
I go to church of christ
Search a life
First to heist a nigga for they merchandise
My niggas ball for weight
Sprinkle ten grams of coke on their corn flakes
To make 'em frosted flakes
Oh, these jewels on my neck
You'll say the Lord I'm saved
My shit cost some cake
You think you can afford a date
But yo your men should know
That my crew, we intend to blow
Treat you cats like Martin Lawrence
And motherfuckin end your show
When I say no
What don't you understand the N or O
Like that nigga Jigga said
Yo, you either friend or foe
So respect my wish
I'm a perfectionist
And wit the gun
Is the only time a nigga plays catch or kiss
Check the list, how many necks I twist
Who expected this, Exodus
Blow over night, or even sex a bitch
But she catch feelings everytime I hit her off
On my dick so bad I need Cochran to get her off
Ask my nigga Digga
Or my other nigga Mr. Ross
I pray we get across
To make it that you get a cross
And casket suit, and I ain't wanna holler grade
But you live in the burbs'
Your business on the holidays

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
Yo, where my down south niggas at?
What, what
Yo, where my north side niggas at?
What, what
Yo, where my east side niggas at?
What, what
Yo, where my west side niggas at?
What, what
Yo, where my Cam'ron niggas at?
What, what
Yo, where my Harlem World niggas at?
What, what
Yo, where my N.O.R. niggas at?
What, what
Yo, where my down south niggas at?
What, what

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Check it
Eh, yo I just wanna walk wit ya'll
I don't wanna rhyme
I just need to talk wit ya'll
How you feel about me
Yo, I think I'm pretty hot
When I rhyme
Niggas grab they dick and diddy bop
And pull they skully down
And put their ice grill on
Like they don't trust a nigga
And walk around the club
Like they 'bout to crush a nigga
I get a nigga mad enough to where he snuff a nigga
Don't have to toast
Yo you fuck around and bust a nigga
You got to love a nigga
The way I crime what
Out west they fuckin throwin gang signs up
Wildin all night and don't care where they wind up
Next day same ice grill inside a lineup
Ya'll niggas times up
Don't mean to trouble you
I'll snatch your kids quicker than B.C.W
What you mad about? I see a lot of tightened jaws
I got a lot of hoes, but I'm really, really liking yours
Not to nag her, 'bout if I can bag her
It ain't if I can have her, it's how I'm gon' have her
I'm a lay her like a quarterback
On her back
On the mat
Found out that you wanna act
We ran through her
You want her back?
Come on wit that
You kiss a hoe
Yo when the bitch leaves
You fuck around and miss the hoe
Oh, I'm the type to twist the hoe then diss the hoe
Choke and threaten to kill her, like her last name's Carlesimo
Listen yo, trick the hoe and get her dough
That was Pryor like Richard, yo
Cause I done been around the world
See I met Puff and I know Mason
But still the best nation
Nigga is donation
So let me hold somethin
Yo, you can't change my livin'
This robbery's a holiday
Call it Thankforgivin'
Cause you a turkey
Talkin' bout you sell weight
Nigga you had soul mates, I had cell mates
But now I've been with the same three gunners
For the same three summers
And dice love me
They stay on the same three numbers

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
Yo where my down south niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my north side niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my east side niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my west side niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my Cam'ron niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my Harlem World niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my N.O.R. niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my down south niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my north side niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my west side niggas at?
What, what
Yo where my east side niggas at?
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what
