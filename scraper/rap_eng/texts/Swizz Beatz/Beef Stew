Just when they thought I was done for the summer
Came out the cupboard, show my ass like a plumber
I ain't Chinese, but you're worth two dolla'
Tee get the bleach, I'm a show my true ca-la
Tell a nigga holla in the peach Impala
Only if he give good brain like a scholar
A-la, a-la, a-la eyy!
Knock your top off like a holiday
Dang, little mama, I should be in your pot
Cause everywhere I go they saying Nicki you're hot
I catch more eyes than the letter with the dot
Super-size fries, my pies better be hot
She got it twisted like a cock-eyed bitch
That's why I be in Mr.Chows, you a Popeye's bitch
You the type to get some money, go spend it on some boots
Save just enough for some douche for your cooch'
It ain't about money, you ain't speakin' my lang'
Cuttin' any bitch off if she enter my lane
And it really ain't a thang, when I bang, I bang
And my goons swing by like orangutans
Fuck wrong with you? I am the Don-dada
I show you how to do it, like I'm your mo-mother
You can't beat me, so don't do-don't bother
You soft like butter,and no, I don't stutter
You Romeo and I'm Master P
That's why they mention me first, then you after me (Next!)
I'm the up and comin' that the streets talk about
The twenty-two slugga, make a bitch walk it out
(Now walk it out!)
Nicki get it poppin' like I came unannounced
Stay with a goon and my goon dumbin' out
So, first thing first, I'm the queen of the crew
I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew
Beef stew, beef stew, whatcha gonna do?
I could cook crack, or cook a mean beef stew
Beef stew, beef stew, whatcha gonna do?
I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew

[Outro]
I am the president, I am the president
Dirty Money
Queens, New York is in the motherfuckin' building, building, building
Building, building, building, building, building, haha
You gotta love me, mayne
Gravy what up? Get your fat ass in the booth, nigga
