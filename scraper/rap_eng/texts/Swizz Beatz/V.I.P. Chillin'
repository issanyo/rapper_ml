(Talking: Swizz Beatz)
6 in the mornin', nigga drink all the patron
Ho!

Where Harlem at?
Huh?

You gotta watch your drink in that thing
Get your cameras out
Time to shine
So I'm

(Chorus: Swizz Beatz)
V.I.P. Chillin', Chillin', Chillin'
Club Poppin', Chillin', Chillin', Chillin'
Fresh to Death, I'm Chillin', Chillin', Chillin'
Who drunk on the liquor though?
All Outside, I'm Chillin', Chillin', Chillin'
Music Crazy Chillin', Chillin', Chillin'
Mami Crazy Chillin', Chillin', Chillin'
Damn, who drunk on the liquor though?

(Verse 1: Dr. Dre)
Yes I am ready to take you higher
Then you ever been, got the medicine in the fire
We travel at light speed we be holding the mighters
Bottles on deck, models on dick
Fuck a shot glass, I'mma take you to the neck
I'mma motherfuckin alcoholic
Guzzle it to the last drop, I need all of it
You thinkin' I'mma call it quits?
Shit I'mma baller, bitch
See me in that hot thing, Probably think I got wings
Parkin' in front of the party watching her throw me her body
Nothing but bad bitches around my team
Nothing but black cards, inside my jeans
Expose where everything goes
She ready to dip low
Need that, Need that
Yeah, so basically the basis is whatever you call the shit nigga
We that, we that

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Dr. Dre)
Big chillin' in this motherfucker (whoo-oo)
That’s how I’m feelin' in this motherfucker (whoo-oo)
Kush blunts all up in the air, now everybody on the ceiling
In this motherfucker (What you’re looking for?)
I’m looking for a bad bitch
Somebody who can hop on top and work magic (whoo-oo)
Move some (whoo-oo)
Work some (whoo-oo)
She murdered it (whoo-oo)
The cops coming (whoo-oo)
I murdered it
A fly coming (whoo-oo)
In my direction, why you stressing? (whoo-oo)
It ain't nothin'
I hop up in that motherfucker, press a button
Top Peel off
I Peel off, stuntin'
Leave the function
Barely functioning
We consumption of something succulent (whoo)
She's all mine (Aah)
She know we fucking (Hey!)
My game just rewind
Ya we right back up and...

(Chorus)
