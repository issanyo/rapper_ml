[Hook: Mashonda (LL) *Swizz*]
(You just a) *Crazy Girl*
You just movin' around
And just shakin' around
And just runnin' around
And just playin' around
And just foolin' around
And just clowin' around
(You just a) *Crazy Girl*
You just movin' around
And just shakin' around
And just runnin' around
And just playin' around
And just foolin' around
And just clowin' around
You just a *Crazy Girl*

[Verse 1: LL Cool J (Mashonda)]
Ain't no particular color for a crazy girl
Usin' her ass to survive in a crazy world
Lacin' ya baby, givin' ya diamonds and the pearls (Ooh)
Sippin' the Belve makin' ya stomach wanna hurl (Ooh)
Spend chips tonight
Me and Swizz got a miss she gone strip tonight
What you hearin', what's your seein', what's you get tonight
Got an anaconda snake for them lips tonight
Baby hit the lights
That's why I can't explain the way I just keep on dropin' heat
Laughin' at competition because they can't compete
Tiger Woods grand slam, Micheal Jordan threepeat
The body I'm rockin' is harder than my beats

[Hook: Mashonda (LL) *Swizz*]
You just movin' around
And just shakin' around
And just runnin' around
And just playin' around
And just foolin' around
And just clowin' around
(You just a) *Crazy Girl*
You just movin' around
And just shakin' around
And just runnin' around
And just playin' around
And just foolin' around

*Ride out*

[Verse 2: LL Cool J (Mashonda)]
Hard to be humble when I be gunnin' from the back
My life is a movie, that's why I decided to act (Yeah)
Packin' this poetry in your ears like wax
Blowin' my celly, rollin' ya philly relax
I hit it and quit that's why they call me "Be Back"
Cuz I might be back, might not be back
Love 'em and leave 'em lyin', deceivin' and cheatin'
And when you catch 'em you peekin' and for the knowledge you're reachin'
A painful lesson you're teachin', a sugar daddy you're seekin'
You fall in love for the weekend, just like the Garden of Eden even
You better ask Swizz how it is we do this

[Both]
From the gutter to the top of the world look at my wrists

[Hook: Mashonda (LL) *Swizz*]
You just movin' around
And just shakin' around
And just runnin' around
And just playin' around
And just foolin' around
And just clowin' around
(You just a) *Crazy Girl*
You just movin' around
And just shakin' around
And just runnin' around
And just playin' around
And just foolin' around
And just clowin' around
You just a *Crazy Girl*
*Let's ride*

[Verse 3: LL Cool J (Mashonda)]
Make 'em cope the unorthodox
Cat's prayin' that I drop like a halter-top
Scatter the whole spot like I bust a shot
Half a mil in big bills baby rust a lot (Mmmmmmm)
Used to cuss a lot, when I crushed the box
The drop get more head than a barber shop
Even old people stop when L park on the block (Doodoodoodoo)
Pictures and autographs "WE LOVE YOU", thanks a lot
A grown ass man, got skills and what not
Anywhere I touch you girl, becomes a G-Spot

[Both]
Six months ago I was cold, now I'm hot
Six months ago you was platinum, now you flopped

[Hook: Mashonda (LL) *Swizz*]
You just movin' around
And just shakin' around
And just runnin' around
And just playin' around
And just foolin' around
And just clowin' around
(You just a) *Crazy Girl*
You just movin' around
And just shakin' around
And just runnin' around
And just playin' around
And just foolin' around
And just clowin' around
You just a *Crazy Girl*
