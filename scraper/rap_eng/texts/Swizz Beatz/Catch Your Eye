[Verse 1: Swizz Beatz]
Eating dinner with the billionaires
But truthfully, I ain't make it there
I'm climbing up a lot of stairs
It took a long time for me to make it here
And I ain't playing fair
My watch on tic, [?] shit
Turbo on gold, Lamborghini tho
The top all gone like presto (it's magic)
But they don't hear me though
Talk to the preacher (Amen)
I said talk to the preacher (Amen)
A long arm, yeah, reacher (can't touch me now)
I'm saying words I hope they reach ya (I hope you understand, me comprende?)
Genuine up in my features (Oh God)
Came back, no glitches  (Oh God)
Front row seats to all games
Then we throw it up like the ball games
(Game six) (talk to 'em, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Jussie Smollet]
When I saw you walking by
I knew I had to have you
And I'd die inside if you came on by
And you say hello (Goddamn)
Like water to your stride
But you never look in my direction
(But you never look in my direction)
But I swear it's true and know if you do
You ain't never be the same again

[Hook: Jussie Smollet]
If you let me catch your eye
I promise you won't be walking by from me (hell naw, hell naw)
If you let me catch your​ eye
I promise you won't be walking by from me
Talk to 'em

[Verse 3: Jussie Smollet & Melodie Ray]
I've begging, pleaded and cry
I've begging, pleading
I've begging, pleading and cry
Tried everything to make you
(Tried everything to make you)
See what everyone sees
That you just don't believe
Could be me
You gonna lose your way
(You gonna lose your way)

[Hook: Jussie Smollet]
If you let me catch your​ eye
I promise you won't be walking by from me (hell naw, hell naw)
If you let me catch your​ eye
I promise you won't be walking by from me
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh

[Outro: Jussie Smollett & Swizz Beatz]
When I saw you walking by
Tell you that we gone
It's too late, you can tell by my vibe
Cause I tell yo nigga that we gone
Tell ya that we gone
Curtains in the back
Man, we gone
Maybach on the city streets, we gone
If you let me, if you let me
A lot of empty seats on the plane in the morn
If you let me, if you let me
Up in the air gone
If you let me, if you let me
40,000 square feet in the crib
40,000 miles in the air, be gone
Gotta bring the soul back, control back
