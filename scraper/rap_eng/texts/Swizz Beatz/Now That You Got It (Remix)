[Intro]
And now with the following collection of the swizzy sounds...

[Refrain: Gwen Stefani]
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Chorus 1: Gwen Stefani]
Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me, now I want
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
All the stars I was reachin' for, you had in the palm of your hand
And if for just once I would let the padlock on the door be open
Well, damn it, just get on over here
This better be the best thing I ever felt
My days, they better be sunny
It better be nothing but all that I want

[Chorus 2: Gwen Stefani]
Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me, now I want
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Bum!
Gungo peas, feng shui and zen
Jump around Jr. Gong and Gwen
If you're happy and you love it, lemme see your hand then
If you really love your lover, sing it like an anthem
Man has set the standard and women has set the trend
Women has played hard to get, still man have to get them
So all of the proper loving, you have to give your girlfriend
From she with the naughty dreadlocks, she don't got no problem

[Chorus 2: Gwen Stefani]
Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me, now I want
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Verse 3: Gwen Stefani]
Well, I'd train him like a Marine Corps
Boot camp, make him like a superhero
That always better be his response
Or I don't give a dog a bone up
Attention! Show me your skeletons, let's not play games
We can be closer than sharing last names
The award is a purple heart, it could be yours
If you earn that medal, yeah, you could be my boy

[Interlude: Gwen Stefani]
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Chorus 3: Gwen Stefani]
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?

[Verse 4: Damian Marley]
Bum!
Gungo peas, feng shui and zen
Jump around Jr. Gong and Gwen
If you're happy and you love it, lemme see your hand then
If you really love your lover, sing it like an anthem
Man has set the standard and women has set the trend
Women has played hard to get, still man have to get them
So all of the proper loving, you have to give your girlfriend
From she with the naughty dreadlocks, she don't got no problem

[Chorus 1: Gwen Stefani]
Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me, now I want
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
If I'm really your baby, then share with me your secrets and all
Now that you got it, what you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' do about it?
