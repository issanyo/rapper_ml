Back with the Ackrite, wilding out from last night
Shining like a flash light
You know we in here and we hotter than a stove top
Never know we won’t flop
See me got them going now we throw in the chair
Watch how I shift up the pick-up with a stack on my mind
Till I pick a brick up, coke spilling in your spine
And I paralyse the hood with goodies, niggas know we winning
If you knowing how I’m knowing bring it back to the beginning

[Break: Swiss Beatz]
I said wait, stop the party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody but

And laughing like everything funny like

Rep your city and let em know everything is gritty like

We bout to blow again, nigga here we go again
Laundry bag heavy ready back to getting dough again
Boy listen we’re about to kill the flow and then
Mash on niggas till we force 'em to get low and them
Shit out proportion she be scorching from the opening
Carry out the office and you know how we be going in

Bang whatever city that you rep till it's over bitch

Who him, he’s a rat, to the hood he can never come back right
