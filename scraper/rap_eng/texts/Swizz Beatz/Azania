[Intro: Hugh Masekela]
"Dear brothers and sisters...
The people who support and buy our music are the poor of the African world
We have to include their sufferings in our recordings
Because we cannot keep on asking them to only romance and dance
The time has arrived for us to restore the best elements of our heritage back into our lives
To relearn and reteach our own languages and history to our people and the rest of humanity"

I'm a entrepreneur slash master (x2)
It's my time to shine
To blind ya, let me remind ya
It's my time to shine
To blind ya, let me remind ya

[Verse 1]
Let me remind you who I do this for
My nyaope homies at the corner stores
Getting less from addiction but always ask for more
Just for a taste of them living above what's going on
Cause they don't fit in the system that everyone belongs
They see you pull up in Germans when you be at the mall
See they have never been driven
So they just help you park
It's either that or they're pushing trolleys at grocery stores
They bring a different perspective of what is Push To Start
Let me remind you who I do this for
My brothers and sisters are struggling to get a job
They needed an education that they cannot afford
Ain't got no qualifications but got a lotta heart
Lost patience cause they been waiting from the start
They try to keep it together but always fall apart
I mean it's birds of the feather but do you fee the flock
How you think the ghetto got little dads and moms
Eish, let me remind you what I do this for
My people catching a train who'll never drive a Porsche
They never popping champagne they'd rather sip a quart
And then the very next day they're going straight to court
There's people going through pain that may be due to loss
And we just talk about gains like Planet Fitness does
Surely these rappers got brains
But do they got the heart
You can admire these kings, I choose to look at God

[Chorus: Sibongile Khumalo]
Khulula inqondo yakho (x2)
Qasula amakentanga
Ubuke ekuqcineni
Hlanz umoya wakho (x2)
Vuka uzimele
Vuka uzimele, uzimele

It's my time to shine
To blind ya, let me remind ya
It's my time to shine
To blind ya, let me remind ya

[Verse 2]
Let me remind you what I do this for
Pimping the system for a greater cause
Taking the knowledge I'm learning, and righting all my wrongs
I take the blessings I'm given and write them out to y'all
I guess I'm stealing from the rich and I'm giving to the poor
I've never been as successful at selling people songs
'Cause I was too busy stressing about me falling off
Guess you forget you're the best as soon as the game is lost
I thank the lord I recovered that little memory loss
So, let me remind you what I do this for
To get my mom a crib in Ballito Farm in Magalies for my papito
While making money with my little bro
So little sis don't need no other man to give it to
Getting shows all around the globe, getting known
Uploading posts from the greatest places ever known
My little son and daughter with me when I'm back at home
Before I zone with my my tall Xhosa yellow-bone
Do you remember what I do this for
You and yours cheering on saying you chewed them all
Do us all a favour show them what we truly are
That little star in Africa that can glow the world
Through these walls they installed, bulldoze 'em all
They say the devil is a liar, you show them God
There ain't no point to retire for being a platinum star
'Cause I am what they call a diamond in Azania

[Chorus: Sibongile Khumalo]
Khulula inqondo yakho (x2)
Qasula amakentanga
Ubuke ekuqcineni
Hlanz umoya wakho (x2)
Vuka uzimele
Vuka uzimele, uzimele

To blind ya, let me remind ya
It's my time to shine
To blind ya, let me remind ya
