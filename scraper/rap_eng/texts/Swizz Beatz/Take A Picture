Say cheese

Right now I need y'all to get your cameras out

Or young hustlers or a young entrepreneur look like
Or a young nigga on the grind look like
So I need y'all to get your cameras out, right now

Wake up in the mornin? and my chef cooked me breakfast
Then brush ma teeth, then I put on my necklace
Didn't think about what car to ride
Is it Phana or the, the Lamgocha?

I got got stuff for you haters, I make my paper you haters
When I see you in the street, I don't speak to you haters
So you never thought you'd see a young fly nigga ball
You see me on top, see me rollin?, see me fall

It's like a jungle sometimes, it make me wonder
How I keep from goin? under when I rock with ten summers
And I still get my numbers and I still stay humble
I got niggas like, ?Damn, dog, how he do that??

I'm on that music, big homie, I got my UNS, big homie
And he ain?t your nigga, so what can you do to me, big homie?
And I'm cool rite now, if I stop rite now
Oh, and I can raise 5 mill? a day rite now

I told ya I'm thinkin? of my master plan
'Cause ain't nuthin' but money inside my hand
I ain't talkin' 'bout a measly 100 grand
Talkin' 'bout big money, get that paper, man

Picture me rollin' in ma ?64, flyin' in my G5
Landin? in the sand, put my feet up in the sand
Grindin' all the time, makin' money while I can
It's a Kodak moment, take a picture while you can

Yes, you can, can, a can, can take a picture with your friend, friends
Even though I missed my flinger goin? to France, man
I gotta stop and show love to all my fans, man
They never pictured they'd see me

Or whatever you gonna do

And I'ma pose so you can get a snap, snap
Get a, get a snap, snap, get a, get a snap, snap
Get a, get a snap, snap, get a, get a snap, snap
