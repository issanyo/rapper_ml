[Verse 1: Tate Kobang]
I pray it's never full, never runneth over
They say karma coming back around a hundred over
So who gon' bring the heat, now that the summer's over
Me, I'm burying a hundred pistols like a hundred soldiers
I used to pray I'd get a job to make my mother proud
I said, "fuck it", I got a burner and a bunch of loud
My old crush ain't have no rap for a nigga
Now I'm up, she tryin' squirt
Who the fuck am I to turn her down?
I stuck a quarter and I flipped it
Took a classic and I ripped it
I ain't lucky, I'm just gifted
Are you listening?
I swear the trenches took my innocence
I fell in love with dividends
But this is just the beginning like Genesis
I know you feel me

[Chorus]
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me - PAM! PAM!
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me - PAM! PAM!
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me - PAM! PAM!
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me - PAM! PAM!
Re-ready for dem
Re-re-ready for dem - PAM! (yeah)
Re-ready for dem
Re-re-ready for dem - PAM! (yeah)
Ready for dem but dem no

[Verse 2: Tate Kobang]
I seen my first hundred thou and went bananas
Spent it all on Reebok Classics and new hammers
Backwoods, OG Kush, and a few [?]
Spent the rest on Texas Tea and blue Fantas
Swizz told me to kill 'em, that's too easy
I just watched 'em die slow, that's too easy
Ready for war or all kickin' doors with 44's
I need weed, gun packs and raw [?]
I done did a lot of dirt with no accomplice
How they plan on stoppin' a monster with no conscience
Designer clothes will have you switch up on your bros
And I done seen the way you niggas switch up over hoes
I know you feel me...damn

[Chorus]
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me - PAM! PAM!
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me - PAM! PAM!
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me - PAM! PAM!
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me - PAM! PAM!
Re-ready for dem
Re-re-ready for dem - PAM! (yeah)
Re-ready for dem
Re-re-ready for dem - PAM! (yeah)
Ready for dem but dem no

[Verse 3: Va$htie]
I thought you was ready, til' I seen your face
Look me in my face, stop staring at my waist
'Cause you not ready, ready, ready
I Ta-hoe's like Chevy, these models I bury
That's why they on the Gram
