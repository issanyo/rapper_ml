[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a drummer get some?

[Verse 1: The Game]
Boom, guess who stepped in the room?
Draped in black diamonds like a fucking Monsoon
Back from the dead but they never found my killer
So I jumped up out the grave like Michael Jackson in Thriller
Iller than most MCs 'cause I be killin' 'em
Most emcees turn into ghost emcees
Yeah, give a drummer some
If 32 Seville when that all black Hummer run
Face/Off, Nicolas Cage with a gauge
I’m famous for killing rappers, my style - grenade
Cook shit like Rae, the chef Raekwon
The beats are filet mignon without the A1
Who bark like a Pitbull, you? Bitch please
I ate your favorite rapper’s heart out with a 16
Didn’t hit the switch on something with big fiends
Make money with Ruff Ryders, homie, that's Swiss cheese

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a drummer get some?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Bang, guess who checked in the game
Smoke in the air like LeBron James
Running this shit like he Ron Dayne
Pull out my dick and just pee on flames
She on Wayne, but she ain’t what I be on
I’m beyond, I pee on you peons for eons
I’m in my prime like Deion, I’ma shine like neon
I’m a Lion like Leon
But I’m ’bout to go off, 'cause that is all I know of
I don’t have to show y’all, I’d rather show off
Yeah, Travis on the drums, Travis on the beat
Wayne got the smoke and Game got the heat
Weezy F, I’m a F’ing star
Get it? F and star
And it’s the rock you bastards
If I’m the rock star we'll rock you bastards

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a drummer get some?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
2Pac in Juice, Radames on the loose
10 chains 'round my neck, haters wish it was a noose
Long Maybach and I wish it was a coupe
Kush out the jar, car smellin’ like Joop
Quarter milli on the seat, yeah I know I’m a goof
Designer underwear she knows I’m the Gucc'
Got the wide body, I’m a fat mother fucker
In Swahili I’m screaming “stack motherfucker”
Ya homie won’t stop until I decide to
Until then I’m making rollies for the homies to ride to
Smokes on the folds, folks wanna know
Bitch I’m a boss, best foot's on the blow
Keep the hat pulled over, Big P on the front
Travis on the drums, big weed on the blunt
Being Savage where I’m from, girls menage from the jump
Don’t trap me like a punk, Travis handing me the pumps, so

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some?
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a– can a drummer get
Can a drummer get some?
