[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Hey I might not  really be your mother
That don't mean that I don't really love ya
And even though I married your father
That's not the only reason I'm here for ya

[Pre-Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think you're beautiful
I think you're perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I know it started with a little drama
I hate you had to read it in the paper
But everything's alright with me and ya Mama
Baby everybody here you know adores ya

[Pre-Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think it's beautiful
I think its perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Alicia Keys]
For love, for love
Are you this real my true love
Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily
I believe love could bring us closer than blood

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Both]
I remember having four step-moms at nine
Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly
Hit my sister's just for dinner cause the cookin' was bomb
Her mother's supper made me love her like she took me to prom (uh)
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
Flacko care, nobody else care
And shoutout to the step-sisters and step-brothers
And god-sisters, who eventually slept with us
Real love, but you do it right, alright
I'm here for you
That is alright, alright

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
That's just what you do (for love)
For love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's alright (for love)
Said it's alright!
I'll be here forever
