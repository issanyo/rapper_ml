[Chorus]
You don't even know how much I love you
You don't even know how I adore you
I bet it would astound you
If I told you now to
Just let all my love surround you
And everytime you call me I start shaking
And me not telling you bout my heart aching
I bet it would astound you
If I told you now that
I wanna let all my love surround you

[Verse 1]
If you knew what I thought about you
It's like the best thing I could find
Treat like honeydew, when I'm kissing you
I can't lie
And we're suppose to be just friends
Benefits with no commitments
But I find myself missing you more than I should be

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a picture of you
I keep it with me
You never knew that it was so deep
Sick over you
Ain't that the truth
And it ain't hard to tell

[Chorus]
You don't even know how much I love you
You don't even know how I adore you
I bet it would astound you
If I told you now to
Just let all my love surround you
And everytime you call me I start shaking
And me not telling you bout my heart aching
I bet it would astound you
If I told you now that
I wanna let all my love surround you

[Verse 2]
Can't believe you don't know about me
Even talk about you in my sleep
All my family knows, straight overdose
I'm you, you, you
Go in my room, and I shut the door
So I can think about your smile some more
Made you out to be the biggest thing to me
Locked up in life

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a picture of you
I keep it with me
You never knew that it was so deep
Sick over you
Ain't that the truth
And it ain't hard to tell

[Chorus]
You don't even know how much I love you
You don't even know how I adore you
I bet it would astound you
If I told you now to
Just let all my love surround you
And everytime you call me I start shaking
And me not telling you bout my heart aching
I bet it would astound you
If I told you now that
I wanna let all my love surround you

[Bridge]
I'm sitting here in your truck
Going crazy over your touch
And it gets to be to much
(On the daily, if I could keep you with me)
Just a little bit of your time
Wanna give you all of mine
I'm thinking maybe, baby, we should just, baby, we should just try it

[Chorus until Fade]
You don't even know how much I love you
You don't even know how I adore you
I bet it would astound you
If I told you now to
Just let all my love surround you
And everytime you call me I start shaking
And me not telling you bout my heart aching
I bet it would astound you
If I told you now that
I wanna let all my love surround you

[While singing in Chorus]
You don't even know it
I'm crazy, crazy over you
Baby, baby, yeah
You don't even know
