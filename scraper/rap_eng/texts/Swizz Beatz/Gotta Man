[Little Girl]
I got a boyfriend now *laughs*

[Eve]
C'mon, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo

[Hook x 2]
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him

[Verse 1]
This nigga lookin' like love, no doubt sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest and
Stay reminiscin' bout the rest and, and how they less than
Trying to come between what we share, can't compare
Could have been left, but when it's mine I never share
Fight to the death if need be to prove that
Wounds from your wars, other bitches couldn't soothe that
Broke from a bad back I'm holdin' you down
Doin' dirt with other bitches but them other fishes drown
Locked in, for however long I'm playin' it smart
Court dates in other cities there I'm playinâ€™ my part
Wifey, in ya life see forever be us
Passenger side of a Bentley or the number 2 bus
Tell the whole world, papi EVE don't want nobody else
With other niggas pick and choose but you, I'm keepin' for myself

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 2]
All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious, but the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It made a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, fucking keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you wit me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a mothafucka', uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 3]
I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
Did some dumb shit, see him in the party start to flip
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controlling the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowing my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, EVE the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time
