[Eve] (Drag-on)
Ugh (Come on, uh)
Uh-huh (Flame on, uh, come on, uh)
Uh-uh-uh-uh (Flame on, uh, come on, uh)
Yo, yo (uh, uh)

[Eve]
Let's talk about who I am
Blond bee, find me in the hood with my peoples
Love y'all, hate the rest of y'all that I can see through
Above that, I can't feel nothin' unless it's lethal
Testin' your moves, never that, make your position fetal, uh

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about Dog nigga, L-O-X, Eve, and me
Now that's the hottest thing in the streets
Our beats is Swizz
Cheesed up with holes in the shit
Double R roll thick
And ain't nothin' sweet but Drag-Eve tracks
Honey Roasted
Burn it 'til its been around now how the fuck that sound

[Eve]
Yo let's talk about
Platinum plaques, hangin' on my wall
See me decorated, she's the one
Heard 'em say it, see me celebrate it
I pop shit when it's necessary, not for nothin'
I use clips for them big beefs
See me bustin', plow!

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about bitches I fucked
I'm a dog so I can't stand no bitch that hounds
I far from a clown
If I'm not knocking them down, Drag's probably not around
So I'm not one to claim by either one of you dames
If y'all catch Drag with a mane, trust me
She got my last name
Here's the hook, uh

[Drag-on]
Now Drag-on will show ya niggas how we lock this shit
[Eve]
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we rock these hits
[Drag-on] (Eve)
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris

[Eve]
Let's talk about little dick niggas
Always talkin' bout what you got
Rather be finger-popped
Dick probably the size of a bough stuffed with rocks
Fuck the cop nigga, go shoot pool, pussy plot
You make me cum, I might flood the block, wet on my socks

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about guns niggas don't bust
Y'all need to see me if y'all wanna see shells pop out
I make niggas say watch out, when I got my Glock out
Niggas clock out, cause I run up in your watch house
Snatch up all your rocks out
Then throw your box out
Ya motherfuckers better watch out

[Eve]
Yo, let's talk about fake ass bitches
Lying on yourself, you ain't ready for the world mama
Beggin' every second money hungry, life drama
Get your own stacks
Why you think these niggas pussy hungry
Cause you actin' triflin'
Layin' up, takin' his money, uh

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about live or die
Fucking with I
Niggas will fry like stripped bacon
I leave them shakin'
Keep 'em sizzlin'
Fuckin' with them you might win
But they only got six shots with a barrel that spin
And us our clip is spinning
And hittin' all their men

[Eve]
I wanna talk about ryde or die
My dogs control confrontation
In any situation
Five niggas on your team
Five niggas you replacing
Five niggas used to gleam
Five niggas left with nathan
But their game that we took
And now they back to chase it

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about biting ass niggas
Let me see y'all niggas catch the flow
Go red-vest with the four-four blow
Ya niggas gonna hit the ground for sure
Nigga let me know if you want more
If he catch you with a pound to choke, you know
Nigga never die slow, till his eyes close
Then jump on the highway, I go
Man fuck the po-po, them niggas is moving slow mo, come on
Here's the hook, uh

[Drag-on]
