[Verse 1: Dirty Money]
You’re the love of my life
But you hurt my heart twice
Now I’m drunker than a muthafucker
Trying to find my way back to your heart you muthafucker
So I know, there’s a price, when your wrong
When your drunker than a motherfucker
Trying to find your way back to love you

[Pre-hook: Dirty Money]
Baby you know, just what to do
I know you know the truth
And we will never lose
Theres no me without no you

[Verse 2: Dirty Money]
So, you made, made me cry
Don’t you hurt, hurt my pride

Trying to fight my way back to your heart you motherfucker
See, you're aching my brain, in your arms I feel sane
Shit you know deep down, I will always love ya
Trying to find your way back to my heart you motherfucker

[Verse 3: Diddy]
(Yo turn me up, I’mma make sure she can hear me)
Yo, that love's gon get ya, muthafucker
Smoke weed, listening to Sade
I left my pain in Paris
Why can’t you see shit my way
You on that lonely highway
My car’s still on that driveway
Feels like I’m dying slowly
Feels like what more can I say
I made you face your fears
I think we could have made it
Thought I told you I love you
Maybe we should have waited
How could you ever doubt me
When I stood by you proudly
I would've gave my last breath
Now you can’t breathe without me

[Refrain 2: Dirty Money]
Oh when you're in the club baby
All you think about is your baby
Oh when you're in the club baby
All you think about is your baby
Baby I want you, I need you to need me, I need you
You want me, I want you to love me forever
Baby I want you, I need you to need me, I need you
You want me, I want you to love me forever

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
When-When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
Them haters can’t tell you nothing
Them haters can’t tell me nothing
Them haters can’t tell you nothing
No, no
