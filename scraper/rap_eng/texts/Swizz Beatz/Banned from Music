[Verse]
This for the stupid flow
Hopped off the porch now we do it hoe
I was makin music
But now my life a musical
I'm just gettin to it
The Clrd bandits ruthless
For all you rappers think y'all gonna blow, I diffuse it
I don't really annotate
Tryna grow a fan base
Hopped off live then I seen I had a fan-page
Damn
They really think I'm good and shit
I took my grandma car they really thought I couldn't whip
I was Riding to some Kendrick
Lookin for some trouble
Women keep talking and niggas wanna rumble
Gawwwd
She said I act fake and shit
I got a whole new script but now the pages ripped
But that's enough penning heartbreak
They crying over heartache
You swimming in that water, boy I live where the sharks lay
Feeling out of my mind, And out of this world
I dapped God up and gave the stars to my girl
Syke bitch, I ain't got one
Always ride shotgun
We love doing hood rat shit and having hot fun
Let the beat ride a bit I am not done
Used to kick 4 packs now I kick 4 songs
Where all the bitch niggas at I am not one
Where they sell hearts at I might go and cop one
Used to want a better "waih...wait a minute hold on"
Yo girl say she leaving you if you ain't putting Joe on
I been walking round in a deep thought
Everybody thinking they the shit I need to detox
I been on go since the instrumental beat drop
You look good on Snapchat? Just know that Ima screenshot
Trust me I ain't really scared of gettin caught
Yo MCM still living with his mom
This is all for the tape we gone wait till it drop
If we stop going hard then it's back to the slums
I know you being flaw cuz you wanna get some views, I ain't no SoundCloud rapper I'm on YouTube too
Shawty I ain't bout'a make a song bout you
JoeVille just a rapper, Clrd candles is the crew
Once I started doing music, me and her parted ways
Once you get your own plate, everybody want a taste
I hear she like me always and she like it all ways
It's JoeVille, I been tryna make a mill all day
