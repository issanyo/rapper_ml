[Chorus: Jayso]
Make u no ask me
It's all in a days work
I'm so classy
That is a great shirt
We on the roll!
We on the paper
We never fall
We always pray first
Lions and tigers and bears
We no dey fear
Pythons and vipers in here
We no dey fear
We on the roll!
We on the paper
We never fall
We always pray first

[Verse 1: Sarkodie]
You know we walk up in a room full of vultures
We no dey fear
You are now rocking with the bosses
Koso dee matɛm me ti me sofa so nom beer
Checki me CV na ma me how many losses
We no dey hear
Wan na ɛde ne ho bɛwɔ menfa no dane bag na men punchi
Who'll volunteer yh
I got money cedi, euro, cefa, dollars
Masa Don't u ever try me i got powers
Pull up. skrrrrr
It's all about the money showers
Nyɛ mo kasa pii ne bank involved
Ama titi hea ne daddy hours yh
Mano twe ne kɔn
Wo soban yɛ faker than a silicon
Wo rap no e looki nice but ase no bɔn
Mosi masɛ ne me buh u sell out for babylon
Dwene ho na fɔn
Trotro driver twa n'anum a mate si na part pɔn

Delivery style no yɛ extravagant
Ka me krom kasa me reppi the motherland

[Chorus: Jayso]
Make u no ask me
It's all in a days work
I'm so classy
That is a great shirt
We on the roll!
We on the paper
We never fall
We always pray first
Lions and tigers and bears
We no dey fear
Pythons and vipers in here
We no dey fear
We on the roll!
We on the paper
We never fall
We always pray first
