Sarkodie 'Take It Back' Lyrics
"Take It Back"

(A Telephone rings and got recieved)

Intro
I know you up there
I can feel you now
I know that you are afraid
You are afraid of us
Beat..
You are afraid of change
I dont Know the future
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end
I came here to tell you how it is going to begin

[Sarkodie]
