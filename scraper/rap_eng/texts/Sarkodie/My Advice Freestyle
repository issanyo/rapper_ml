[Intro]
Yh Uh Tea

[Verse 1]
Yah me on this beat ego cause you some damages
Last year I went through some challenges
Industry, whole lot of hate can’t we just
Love one another in happiness
Fuck it am flourishing
S3 mi wua Titi nkoa b3 di publishing
Industry future nu nlooki promising
When colleagues dey enjoy in name tarnishing
When your hype varnishing

Who gives a fuck about your chicken change property
If being poor be like me then father I beg you just bless me with poverty
I don’t want to snitch on my nigga
But fuck all the bragging and chill Cos honestly
Your whole bank account no fit buy you one tear-rubber Volk
But you claiming supremacy
Fuck outta here you be fool Bati

[Verse 2]
Am tryna leave a blue print
Am from Tema what the fuck did you think?
Mempe Kasa but am touching on a few things
Gyae allumi ni sh3 na kor sh3 Cub-links
Paul ah wa ba ntem ni fame nu fo fo nu
Akola wani ya kyere wani nton
W)di ya w) papa ah w) wre fi s3 w)b3 tu nu
W)n huu hwe kraa no sem pii na totoo nu

Brand no be strong enough
If you be strong keep quite you go soon comot
I stayed mute one year saf full support
You showed dick one day you go show buttocks
The last thing wey I want be attention
The whole of Africa ebi me wey dem dey mention
Mi gye mi ho di nti mu timi ma mi tension
Bra na mi nkyere mu branding ansa na ma k) pension
Me ma mu hypertension

[Verse 3]
The only reason I dey do this be sake of
I’m on a mission to push Ghana forward
I had to put career on hold so say this new artist go cash out some dollars
So if I see some distraction, I for address am cos nigga dey misuse him powers
Only if you all nigghas knew what I am doing
Me and my team are brainstorming for hours
Confidence is when you able to complement people without you feeling insecure
So if you feel say you ve got it, no need to downplay the next man
Wosro no na fior

[Verse 4]
Ultimate confidence
The brand be solidified that be why my love be pure
My dream is to bring all the artists together
Even though nigga get bag to secure
You came from the ghetto you made it am proud of it
I gave you a long rope
So just enjoy I was waiting for you to snap out of it
Mi nu mi nsro nipa bia but asem nti ma busua mu is full of savages
5 years in the game you are still scared oh God let me just say it how it is
Brother you take the piss

[Verse 5]
This no be beef just stay and listen
Me and you cool no crazy friction
But my frustration be say I dey try move Ghana forward but I’m still
Babysitting
New money, new car, new house so you can’t think far
Buh time is running out we for raise bar
Cos after sometime na wo fame koa
Nobody go get time for your bullshit
So you for see the way you dey approach it

Mempe wua sem a anka mi b3 ma wu notice
Eye wa gyimi kakra a stay focused
How many times na ma ka akyere wo phone so
S3 dea wu y3 nyinaa no dey need
Me te woase fame no me nim s3 abru wo so
Buh wo nni haw you get love on the street
Your soul is tormented cos you no dey hustle you be talented
Charlie Mercedes Benz no dey talk chaw still relevance unprecedented
This be the time we for take over

Up till now we no fit sell out the Madison Square but we fighting on
Range Rover
Y3 ni so b3 tete yen nah game over
Attention seeking is not bad buh too much of it is chronic disease
S3 anka social media trend na ma nipa y3 relevance anka obia en feature Mugeez
Sesea s3 mi wua, agro a ewor wu ani so yi who can I trust to control the kids
Until I die Nyankupon ma mi time na mi nchange industry yi daddy please
Enye saa Maestro no go rest in peace
