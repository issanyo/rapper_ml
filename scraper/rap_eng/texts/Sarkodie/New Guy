[Intro: Sarkodie]
That’s why I wake up every morning
I grind, stand up and sun down
Wake up knowing that people expect me to lead ‘em to a win
When times is tough they look at me for answers
Hoping I can lift ‘em off from their fears and progress
So I grind, Sunday to Monday
Cause they ain’t no role models
They ain’t no true leaders left
So it’s up to me to make sure the world knows that I’m that new guy
I’m that new inspiration

Ivy League.. SarkCess Music… Ace Hood.. uh

[Verse 1: Sarkodie]
I’m the new guy
I made it from the slums back in Africa where most of my niggas committed suicide
Every story got a two-side
T-shirt tryna make it to the suit and tie
You know a nigga gotta survive, it’s do or die
We gotta make it and it’s really up to you and I
Started from the bottom, nigga really did a lot
So tell me who am I?

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Yeah,The beast of the South, on my worstest behaviour, don’t make me angrier
Couple shots all in ya dome and that turn ya shit to a stadium
Dr. Martin Luther King gotta had a dream nigga
Twenty bitches in my bed naked counting cheese nigga
Black man in a fuckin’ beamer
Got a tipper toeing like a ballerina
Diamonds water water like aquafina
Serving bitches like the new subpoena
Only pieces on my cuban chain
Sell ya soul and get the birth of fame
Bought some waters with a broad damage in the stores, damn, not a thing change
Protesters is another lesson
Prison cells are getting too congested
Righteous living, fuck a suicide
New guys wearing suit and ties
Bossing up instead of talking nice
Shooting guys, prison time
Stacking money, build an enterprise
Be the one who niggas idolize
Counting money till my palms hurt
I remember they was way worse
Momma praying everyday at church
Being broke in every second hurts
Tryna shine boy you gotta grind, and just wait on time
That’s just how it works
Good in the hood with my street tithes
I can’t say the same for you new guys

[Hook]
That’s why I wake up every morning
I grind, stand up and sun down
Wake up knowing that people expect me to lead ‘em to a win
When times is tough they look at me for answers
Hoping I can lift ‘em off from their fears and progress
So I grind, Sunday to Monday
I’m that new guy

[Verse 3: Sarkodie & Ace Hood]
Ace… Lemme take you to Africa
My people they love you
I came here, you showed me some love and I promise to build you a statue, uh!
Ace Hood akwaaba
And Sark is a hell of a nation
M’asigne wo din wɔ Kumasi, m’apem so, nyɛ adeɛ a wobɛhia confirmation

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Uhh… Sark medaase
I’m the new Pac in the projects
Welcome Sarkodie, the United States where they selling narcotics
It’s a pleasure my nigga
Now let’s go and get the money bags
Haters hating, they will never last
Came too far and we ain’t looking back

[Hook:]
That’s why I wake up every morning
