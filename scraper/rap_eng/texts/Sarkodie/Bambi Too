[Intro: Maleek Berry]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, nah, nah

[Chorus]
Bambi, Bambi (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
My dear, I want you here (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near, for there's lions, beware (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 1]
Oh, Bambi, I won't lie
If I weren't in this spider web of mine
If grandfather never had seven wives
Then darling, you would be the love of my life
Oh, Bambi, it's my design
To run the jungle, I must be a lion
Or be a cheetah, but neither is fine
Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life

[Chorus]
Bambi, Bambi (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
My dear, I want you here (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near, for there's lions, beware (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 2: Maleek Berry]
One time
Ha, girl you know I'm tryna be the king of the jungle, oh, ohhh
And you the only one I'm tryna give my love to, you oh
And I ain't tryna prey on nobody else, but you, my dear
I know it's real hard, you tryna cover those scars, baby
Biah, biah, Bambi
Yuh know seh I no get plan B
And you the only one meant for me
That's why I wrote this song for my shorty, yeah, yeah
Don't be scared, my love
Of the tigers and bears, my love
Baby, I'm a lion, but I ain't lyin' when I say I got you, Bambi

[Chorus]
Bambi, Bambi (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
My dear, I want you here (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near, for there's lions, beware (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Bambi she made me cry (oh, yeah)
So hard I shed a tear (I cried)
Bambi she made me smile (oh, yeah)
She put my heart on chill (so cold)
As long as I'm here (I'm here)
You ain't got nothin' to fear (no)
To the world I'm a lion (I'm a lion, babe)
But to you, I'm sincere (I'm a Bambi yeah)
You got your life in the palm of your hands
You stick with the plans, just stick with your plans
If you got a knife in the palm of your hands
I'll let you cut my heart up, baby, I'm just sayin' (just say'in)
They can't take you from me, baby (no)
No one can take it from me, baby (no)
I can do all kinds of favors...

[Chorus]
Bambi, Bambi (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
My dear, I want you here (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near, for there's lions, beware (Ahh, Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 4: Sark [English Translation]]
You know I love you, girl
I know it's your wish that I give my love to only you
So I can treat you well
The G code is a brother, never kiss and tell
So ma, baby channel
What you really want is the ride or die love
No, nobody involved, just me and you up in the club
My baby, of course, you did deserve the love that you want
But I'm tryna keep real with you, it ain't my fault I want more
I ain't tryna push you away, just telling the truth
The way you walk, the way you talk, spaces in between your teeth
Don't you worry, it's a lot you gotta deal with
I don't wanna lie, but I know you will surely get yours
Bambi, don't come close, it's not safe
To you, the path I chose is not great
But me, my true love goals is more space
You know we, we do this all day
