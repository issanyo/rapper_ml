Verse [Sarkodie]

Tie3

The realest neqqers in the game
Of course i pay my dues

Way before music was introduced
97 i was hustling
Thinking what i could do
Me nantse nantse

3nu moa na me de discover me crew
Angelo(Angel) me ni nu na 3’starti wo street
Life tse s3 cush, Black na 3’passi me peace
On the real

Rap su nfasuo na me de tua me fees
First time aah me hit ti y3
Time aah me future Mugeez ‘Baby’
Me swag yena 100 Degrees

Industry ni mu 3den dodo
Ntse na 3yaa me wo ni grease
Ma me nka mafi me Nana REST IN PEACE
Tema boy aah ma b3 hit ti wo overseas
Man we made it

B3 bia y3 b3 du nu they can't debate it
S3 nia me rapi you believe im over ready
Me ny3 regular rap
You get me sophisticated
Never gon stop because
I’m Dedicated

Know alot of niqqers dey ? fake love
I feel the energy everytime i wake up
And i lot a couple of day ones
S3 sia me ya fufro
But what the f–k with day one (Haaa!)
3mbra na me deal with street life
Some low class niqqers be looking at me like
You ain't get shit but looking for cheap hype
But now we made it
Niqqers wanna smoke with peace pipe (Wow)

Whiles on the ?
Na sika fuo nba tu kuaye k) de summer
S3 sia ma hit ti me ny3 ready for your drama
I’m study making money for my Mama, Yea
Because when the money goes
Will the niggers stay

Nko)fu pii na 3ntu mi atweye for rainy days
Men i was really broke
But Now im getting paid
Me flow paa but me punch bia
But sometimes i wanna switch it up
But me ny3 quick enough

Why should i go commercial
When i can just stay the KING of rap
Dont wanna give it up
3to) da bia me ko town aah me ntsi me dwom wo club
I’m a human
But all the same the people show me love
Me dropi highest

Nkrofuo sie SARKODIE dey rush
Eno be rush, Ebe confidence
I’m ready for consequence
Maybe some days kuraa m3 dropi blues
But they dont depends on how i feel
This is for the real niqqers in the game
Is an option if you chence the money and the fame
Wo fan feeli woa

Forget obiaa na de wo lane
Cause the music industry go feel drive you in sane
Obia ne nu de3
Obia ne kuaye aah )b3 fa so
I know is kind of hard
But Menua you get to hustle
The easy way

The hardest way
Wa twen s3 hit p3 na wo hiaa
Nframa mu na wo si wo castle
Yia na new rappers ne bisa me
HOW I DID IT?
I was insecured
I was feeding off my critics
I was never signed
They can't relate to my lyrics
But na mewo gyide3

I can feel it in my spirit
Its been a longtime coming
All this tracks and the boy is still running
All that swag and the boy is still standing
But s3 mu ntia sia

But huayie na 3kyere mu rap?

Huayie na ebiea mu eni aah s3 sie mu ehu Whatsup?

S3 ye amb)me dze aah mu fa Mank3nin beto) me Jaw

You made me a Star
Nia way3 a’mame
Me kas3 me kaa
Men..All you niggers dey focus on the Glitz and the Glam
But munim attack Biba mesu anodwe fa aah (F–k it)
But the devil is a lie
Mu twi me saye but me my limit be the sky
And i go rain for this Kasahari till i die
Flipping all this money
Put some half a billion on the side

Shit is getting real
Silly rappers wanna make some dollar bill
Abutre3 3da makoma munu me seni Atta Mills
Cause Mehu konkonsa nkuaa mu 3kodi akyere Papa bills (Back stabbers)
But its all about the money wo nka sika sem aa
Wo voice tune kuraa y3 funny
Use to think, all i need that was a grammy
Until couple years a go when i lost my granny
Ever since i made it to the top
Niqqers want hate
I dont really give a f–k
Mu si mu eya Key but me nsu me change lock
