[Suli Breaks]
And they say there would come a king from amongst the people
Who will dine with them
Grind with them
Then'is toungue will speak the truth of the masses
He shall not walk on water
Buh his flow shall wash away the tides of their ignorance
And his words will make the pilgrimage to the hearts of the desperate
His lyrics will be written from the books of his revelations
And his verse's their daily bread
