You Ready?

[Verse 1]: Sarkodie
Man I'm stressed out
They talking about rappers and I'm left out

Conversations for my next House
Sesiaa Ghana who's the fucking best now?
Ugh
Of course it's me God Damn it!

Broke Niggas wey dey perch we on credit
Wey dey try to put me on freeze

Shit is really gonna be scary
I swear Down
I'm a king but I don't feel I gotta wear crown
Ugh
That was a clear sound
Mr D.J make you drop this fire on the air now
ɔmose Sarkodie ndrope punches
I can do it really but the point is
Wo rape na wo punche pii a
Joo you sound immature
You gotta spit from your heart, no be your jaw
Best emcees right from the top
Yeah them be best cause they write from the heart
B.I.G, JAY-Z to NAS

Fuck the bars
Till I pass out
Each and every year bia I go cash out
Verses a me save wɔ me iCloud

Dominating the game mona mobɔ nkuro

You diss me but you can't defend your own
Wohyia mea cool but you pretend on phone

Paid the cost to a boss
Counted all my losses
Accountants and An Office

If you got it You can Floss it

You make it and they hating
Celebrating, Unashamed
Pay attention all am saying is

You can think you can do
All the blades and the strings you can pull
Put the ring on the dude
Cause I ain't gonna move
Wanna bring yall to school
And show yall how to move in a room
Full of vultures
Strap the revolvers
Rap different cultures
