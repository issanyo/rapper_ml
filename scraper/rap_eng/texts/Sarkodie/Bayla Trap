[Verse 1:Paedae]
Paedae the problem,welcome to my residence
Barack Obama im your president
A hand of pair of Shoes can you step in them
Cus I’m trying to clean up my closet like Eminem
Or at least follow his legacy
But be shady,no slim no sniff coke
No but we still dope,refuse to be broke
Give this kids hope
Make them know to be on a low
If they wanna blow they can go
Where ever they wanna go
But never to forget were they are from
How life was tough when everything seen wrong
Now you won like Lebron
But remember you will be gone someday
And we will morn,from dust till its dawn
So be modest
With the others like we were born in August
Who Jah bless no man curse
Our aim was to come first
And surely surely we are no target

[Chorus 1: Mugeez]

Wo na wo hyɛɛɛ hɔ nu

Ha so now you rocking with the best
Droping easy like a hope they want to sex

Just me against the bombo microphone and no one else
Yes im too bless to be stress
Yes you know im killing it eno be smitan worse
Dem say me sicker than the cus me bring the next
Wey dem no go fit to cure the world thats what im yes
Still on the rule like Mugabe
Guse wan fit shop the run the mould within the army
From Africa through Jamaica to Miami
The alla dem girl dem mark Miami
If i dey vibe the ex wey i have a lie

The thing wey den dey hunt for we have it ina we track
The only reason dem dey bark
