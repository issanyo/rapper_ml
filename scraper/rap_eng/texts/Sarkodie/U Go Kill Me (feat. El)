Every since i get popullar
Everybody dey try to copy the formulla

So baby come around come and see me flow
Don't give me wahala do gada give me, give me blow

But ego catch some time
You nenes no fit kill me sef.EL baby

Allright listen
I was killing in the club with one of my mosimina

And everybody now say i be killing all these haters

And i go blow you for now you be like shongai time
The records i dey, they always get big
The dem dey analise my pounch lines, rhymes
I don't know, how many time i go pree
Say i dey get filling, i dey crush genevive
But when i give you bele dem dey put am for the news
Dem dey spoil the parode, and then life i a... hubansu
Dey see me boil all dey, my money stay fat and i boil alway
My niggers in the back and you that we flexing
Your style is a ., cus you suck all day
Ama take you to me bizza

Oh, aboki the master

We gown party, what are you talk enemies for
With eugen MC, so the penalty solve, Lord
She gown kill me, unless i shoose to die
He is the way, he is a mod, suicide
It's me in the crew, ah, im in the corner
Exuse my man, mr loose the camera
..., lets loose...
