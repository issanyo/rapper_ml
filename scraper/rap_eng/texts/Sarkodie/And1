And a nigga fena go legit
And I’m smoking loud in the Benzo
And I put them pounds in the rental
And I’m In your town for the thotties
And they know that I’m around sent the memo
And I got shooters on shooters
And I got Africans on computers
And we only came for the Mula
And we roll out like Luda
And I’m sitting sideways
And I’m bout to get paid
