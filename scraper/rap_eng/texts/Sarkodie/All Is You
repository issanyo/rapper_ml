[VERSE 1 : MUGEEZ]
No one knows what I'm feeling for you my bae
So many signs on the road my girl
but we just go follow one way
Lemme take you far away
Plenty things I want to say
All the fuss and fights and the doubts
you don dey have put them all behind
Already you won my
No be lie
I wish that they could see
They would know my love and happiness

[CHORUS : MUGEEZ]
All is you

You are always on my ma mind, in my heart
Forget obia
Because all is you
Baby girl all is you
You are always on my ma mind, in my heart
Forget obia

[VESRSE 3 : SARKODIE]
Love is a beautiful thing
Lookin at your beautiful skin

Ma sister, ma brother, ma baby

Promises over promises I no go fit lie
