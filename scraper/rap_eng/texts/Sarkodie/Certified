All clean up but we never fight

[Verse 1: Jayso]
They call me kwaku picasso representing the westside
If you wanna roll with me then let’s ride
If it ain’t productive then I let it slide
I am steady taking shots
You're taking selfies on your bedside
Still these critics ain’t giving me probs (no)
Wanna get ride of me you can stuck (bro)
They said I must be highing off for something
Some other assumptions
But tell them that is not so
At the door with the crew matador to the bull
If u can’t say it to my face then please don’t ask me
Or I might pull a stunt and police dont catch me so
Miss me with the tough talk or u gonna see who’s there before knock knock
Talk lock for your thumbs sucks am good with these bars word to bruce lee and its non chucks
Lately success is all I see
Every other month different caller ID
How I make this quick stevens to God my Gee
Quick heads give thanks to Almighty
Lately progress is all I see
Digital gansters Rip
Grateful for every single heart I reach
Nyaame ebi God almighty

[Verse 2; Sarkodie]
