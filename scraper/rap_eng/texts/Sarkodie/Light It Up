[Intro]
We gon turn it up!
Yeah

[Chorus: Jayso]
Calling my rap appalling
Telling me that I've fallen
Spirit's up in the morning
Postive that im all in
Can't get under my skin
Can't get sentimental my friend
I was having fun a week ago
Made this instrumental my ten
I don't raise expectations
Every stage every station
Everyday celebrating
Everyday celeb ratings
Bad business i don't like it
Bad wishes uninvited
Talk talk i don't buy it
We gon crank it up turn it up and then
Light it uuuuuup
We gon light it uuuup
Yeah yeah
We gon light it uuuup
Yeah yeah
We gon light it uuuup
Uuuuuuup

[Verse 1: Sarkodie]
You know I came prepared in all black
Wontumi tua me swag n all that
Midi mi vim na ɛnam so fall back
Wudwa wenum kɛkɛ its all rap
Some of the gangster shit that you say
Ma boys say dey go come where you stay
So make you no see me someway
You know ma nigga we do this all day
Obidi came in the game with no love
Cuz chale the game was so tough
I remember the pain and o lord
Monyɛ me level ma nigga so hold up
You can't really survive with no passion
Procrastination no action
Jayso was like my joe Jackson
From community nine to new mansion
Mini me Nyame nɛ nam nti minsro hu
Minkoa midin na ɛtɔɔ O2
Chale forgetti beef mihia pro tools
Asem tumi aa who do i go to
Mo pushi mi to the the wall me kyerɛ bossy
Sisia Ghana ha rap a lil faulty
Shatta wale hype ɔdi maa salty
Saa na mayɛ ma rappers bɛye forty
Still a you no sort me
Too much sauce
Obidi mewɔ too much sauce
Ɛdien na yɛnyemo asaana muehu sɛ miyɛ guy
Nndiɛ bisa two high boss
Mi lucky number niyɛ 254
Kasantwii wo bɛ shwɛ na two guys bore
Bo mɔdin na ma weni nkɔ the people around you
Now who would you die for

[Chorus: Jayso]
Calling my rap appalling
Telling me that I've fallen
Spirit's up in the morning
Postive that im all in
Can't get under my skin
Can't get sentimental my friend
I was having fun a week ago

I don't raise expectations
Every stage every station

We gon crank it up turn it up and then
Light it uuuuuup

[Verse 2: Big Narstie]
I come to shame it i come to earn it
Not make furnace
Sat in a captain's chair by merit
How can a lion be afraid of a ferret
How can a ferret out tooth for a lion
How wood ever toot to iron
How can you fail if don't stop trying
How can a mule owe toot to a titan
How do civilians deal with a tyrant
How come police do not understand violence
Chale I'm ontop of the valley
Akwasia na i saw making (inaudible) for the one and only
Its like coming to America
I'm so happy to be here
No why all this (inaudible)
Get me oh God
Titi bobo una
Getting left in the see like tsuna
Ah hurt ma brain like tumor
Im a Knight wey i never walk too much
Raging demons show me the (inaudible)
Caprisun all done
Brought more juice than a fuckn (inaudible)
Sandwich boy I'm a bloomer
Show these nigga i can (inaudible)
Fly through like rumer
Keep straight like ruler
He's king who's ruler
He's stuck who's tula
Get dough get mula
Get straff get dramen
Get lupa get pocket seem like fruya

[Chorus: Jayso]
Calling my rap appalling
Telling me that I've fallen
Spirit's up in the morning

Can't get under my skin
Can't get sentimental my friend
