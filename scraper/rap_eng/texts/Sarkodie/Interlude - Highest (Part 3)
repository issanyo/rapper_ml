[Suli Breaks]
In the land of the blind, the man with the one eye tends to see everything
So in the world of the voiceless, come like the man with the microphone will eventually be King
The heavy is the head that wears the crown
'Cause great men have always encountered opposition from medeocre minds
So forgive them
Forgive them for they know not what they do
