[Intro: DJ Lambo]
Ladies and Gentlemen
I go by the name DJ Lambo
We bouta get this party moving
I got a few of my brothers in the house sipping on that Millionaira Champagne
You know what I'm saying!!!
Ice, Sarkordie, M.I

[Bridge: M.I Abaga]
There's a lot of girls in here
But you're looking like you the one
Omoge just be sincere
You know you wanna have fun
Why don't you come kick it with a young black African millionaire
Come kick it with a young black African millionaire

Ok, look at you, now look at us
Talk true, who resemble boss?

[Verse1: Ice prince]
Yeah, boy me no think of that
Man been flirting with the women's
Love back to back
Been a long time we been schooling cats how to rap
I been about my bullets
Been getting loaded out the cataract
Yeah I rap the hardest shit
Yeah I do it back to back
Yeah I rap on aboki and I VIP after that
But what you gonna do me
My nigga that why I laugh at that
Like OMG cus boy them a talk a lot
Niggas gettin smokin, but we burnin fast back to back
Rappers calculating me, yeah I'm  adding my further math to that
Kill me or after that, who the bum or who the aftermath?
You can react to that and get seizure or a heart attack
I'm tired of the bullshit and all the crap
I ain't tryna prove a point that I can murder raps
If I controlling that, put your ass into another lap
Put your ass to sleep and show your girl that I was all of that!
Ok ok ok, I'm vexing. Shabi you no see say we don dey sweat since
Man demma shoot, man camouflage flexing
Say na dem dey badder, she na me kon say my neck slim
Its goons on the left goons on the right, goons in the club
Goons everywhere a broda man go
Girls on me cells, girls in me home, girls on me whatsapp
Make a badman a lay low
Everytime we roll we, we got 16 cars
Everytime we touchdown, we got 16 broads
Real niggas in the building girls itching for
And I swear, M.I I thought I had had 16 bars
(Theres alot of girls in here though)

[Bridge: M.I Abaga]
There's a lot of girls in here
But you're looking like you the one
Omoge just be sincere
You know you wanna have fun
Why don't you come kick it with a young black African millionaire
Come kick it with a young black African millionaire
Ok, look at you, now look at us
Talk true, who resemble boss?

[Verse2: Sarkordie:]
Me I got a million here, million there
Looking for some pretty young girl with some long hair
From the ghetto, me I don't care cus its not fair
To give it to a rich girl mehnnn, now who goes there?
Rocking on the prada, the Sark jeans, the Louis
I be the family guy with brains, yeah they call me stewie
Hop on the plane and straight to VIP if I wanna weewee
I just pull out my cock so all the cabin crew can see me
Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
I make enough money, my bank account is just ungrateful
Some people smelling poverty, men thats kinda painful
But you gotta kick ass to be a charlie's angel; Single
Dominoes, Cuban cigars
Mr Incredible the way you dropping your bars
Make me wanna switch it up from Jay to Kendrick Lamar
We the realest in the game, fuck who you are!
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money baaaags
I'mma be the best that you've ever had
Take you on the trips, you ain't coming back
Them niggas is silly they use the range (rain?) to rush my baby
But I be the millionaire, my taxi sef be new Mercedes
Every time I pull up in Lamborghini the like odinkwa save me
Them for pay me just to stop because the love is crazy
Show me love, baby show me love
Follow me girl you know whats up
Pocket full of money Cedi and the Naira
I'mma break it down for you raw like a cypher
What else?

[Bridge: M.I Abaga]
There's a lot of girls in here
But you're looking like you the one
Omoge just be sincere
You know you wanna have fun
Why don't you come kick it with a young black African millionaire
Come kick it with a young black African millionaire
Ok, look at you, now look at us

[Verse3: M.I Abaga]
Baby can I have your phone digits
So maybe you can come kick it, no dey form busy
You know that you and I together, we can run Gidi
I'm talkin didididi don dididi don diggy...
Whatever you're thinking you want baby come get it
I'm big homie like I'm Sean Diddy or maybe Sean Carter
I rhyme harder, explosive like I'm gun powder
I'm killing the beat, tell the producer to make the drums louder
They talking funny money,they making it rain - I'm making it tsunami man
You got it? I got the Juice like I'm Ndani
I'm on my grown-ish, they talking childish,they talking Barney
Them little boys they don't concern me
Now all the single ladies, now put your hands up
And even if you got a man, that dude is bankrupt, STAND UP!
Ladies, welcome to the millionaire fan club
I got em coming bra, I'm like a tank top
Cus she's a star homie, and if you like it then you shuda hustle hard for it
And get a job for it, and buy the car for it
And girls, if he don't really spend don't let him sample it simple!
That nigga in your face he like a pimple
Me I'm just there to make you smile, I'm like a dimple
I got the funds-I'm-meant-to, call it FUND-A-MEN-TAL
President,chilling out, KAS, I'm presidential
Got money in my pocket and I dominate the market
And I always stay on topic when I rock it; You got me acting me cocky
I reverse d Bentley into the spot so he doesn't see the Chairman written on the license when I park it

Even as a little kid lyricist, I was very sick
I didn't think that I will be very rich by the age of 26
By 28, the money great,I was getting accelerate, because of how I penetrate the industry eventually
Respirate the less debate, investigate the best to make this music till it generate
Some extra cake, I'm more like 50mil is just an estimate
And am just talking shows, my nigga your boy is ?
I told you rappers lie on Lekki bridge
I'm Carrie Bradshaw boy..I'm f**ing Big
Fresh boy balling with them J's out
You're like an exit sign,you're on the way out
Am feeling like I just began a new life
Most the shit I spit over your head my nigga; Boom Mic
Making more Millions than M.I is true right?
Story for the gods my nigga; Tales by Moonlight...

Outro:
Bottles on the floor, I ain't worry bout nothing and you know it
You move too fast like you ain't got class just slow it
So why you gotta act like, you ain't even know how to dance right
