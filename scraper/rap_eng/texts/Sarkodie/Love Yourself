[Verse 1: Sarkodie]
You want somebody else to love you
Wo pɛ sɛ obi complementi wo ansa na woa hu sɛ you’re beautiful
Ɛnyɛ possible without you
Tell yourself that you gotchu
As pretty as you are
Are you tryna tell me sɛ wo ngye woho ndi
Wonyɛ confident kraa sɛ wo yɛ star!
Ma baby girl then you are
Listen don’t be insecure
Love yourself
Please be sure make you no ask for help
Make nobody talk before you feel yourself
Cos beauty no be from the cars and wealth
Be proud of you cos your eyes are cute
Jealous girls na ɛma wo attitude
Self hate is gonna make it hard to choose
From the shoes to wear
But tie!

[Chorus: Moelogo]
Meyɛ obaa dɔmi

Don’t you worry what people gonna say
Madanfo dɔmi

Don’t you worry what people gonna say
Madanfo dɔmi

[Verse 2; Sarkodie]

But you doubt you
Insecurities only allows you to look down on yourself but its not true
Cos people that you think are beautiful those people just believe in themselves its all about you
So baby girl tell me how soon?
Are you gonna wipe your tears and just smile
Don’t follow trend just bring your own style
It ain't what you wear ma baby it’s just how confident you are
So sweedie just smile

Be proud of you cos your eyes are cute
Jealous girls na ɛma wo attitude
Self hate is gonna make it hard to choose
From the shoes to wear
But tie

[Chorus: Moelogo]
Meyɛ obaa dɔmi
Meyɛ bɛrma dɔmi
Don’t you worry what people gonna say
Madanfo dɔmi
Meyɛ obaa dɔmi
Meyɛ bɛɛma dɔmi
Don’t you worry what people gonna say
Madanfo dɔmi
