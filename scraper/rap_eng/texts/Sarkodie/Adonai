INTRO
Yeh! The people at the back make it one for me, go!
CASTRO
Everybody give your collection(x3)
God eee
Everybody give your collection(x3)
SARKODIE
Listen! Don't let people take you for a fool
All the shaking they are doing is because of you
He's your enemy leave him and let him steal
If they won't help you, get down and push
CHORUS
When you are involved everything goes well
King God what you said is what will happen
When you raise your hands mountains will break
So my friend don't lose God let your heart be at rest
Everybody sing hallelujah
(Hallelujah)(x2)
Make you sing ooo (oh yaah yahh)
I say help me sing ooo (oh yahh yahh)
SARKODIE VERSE 1
Ah! y'all thought I would fall down
I went and now I'm back
They said that I've been removed, I don't have anything
Now you are disgraced you thought I would become useless
When you see me your tummy burns
When you cast your eyes on me, you ask who's this?
It's God handiwork
Now you see me 2 2
The time they say I was a junky
You said it aswell, shame on you too
Now you've noticed I'm a baller...yonkey
Look at your face like money
If I check I can see that you are hungry
If you were well off would you still be wearing aboski?
I have not died meaning king God is alive
Me and you aren't the same, everybody has their world
When I was lying on a bench in Aflao
Nobody brought a handkerchief to wipe under my eyes
CHORUS
When you are involved everything goes well
King God what you said is what will happen
When you raise your hands mountains will break
So my friend don't lose God let your heart be at rest
Everybody sing hallelujah
(Hallelujah)(x2)
Make you sing ooo (oh yaah yahh)
I say help me sing ooo (oh yahh yahh)
SARKODIE
You didn't catch me 10 years ago
If I was going to die it would've been way back
You flopped, this be my payback
My enemies watch guard
I won't cuss you , I don't wanna disobey God
You wanted to put my into prison
For no particular reason
When you were thinking about me, I was having a meeting with TIGO
Listen to me well, I don't wanna repeat
God is the one protecting me so you can't do shit
Money isn't a problem that is my motto
Use your eyes to look at my skin and my swag
Don't get too hyped cause tomorrow there will be more happiness
CASTRO
You are the one that created the sky and the earth and everything in it
That's why we call you Adonai
The stuff you have done for me and my family has surprised me
So I won't lie
You are the one that created the sky and the earth and everything in it
That's why we call you Adonai
The stuff you have done for me and my family
The way you blessed my mother made me cry I say God ee
I don't know what I will do to thank you father eee
Baba God eee you have made me great and I am thankful father ee
Father God eee because of your grace I am still alive
Baba you be too much eee(x3)
Baba God eee(x3)
CHORUS
When you are involved everything goes well
King God what you said is what will happen
When you raise your hands mountains will break
So my friend don't lose God let your heart be at rest
Everybody sing hallelujah
(Hallelujah)(x2)
Make you sing ooo (oh yaah yahh)
I say help me sing ooo (oh yahh yahh)
