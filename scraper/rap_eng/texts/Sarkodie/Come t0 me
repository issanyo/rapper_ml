Verse 2 – Sarkodie
So passionate about my baby
Ah there goes my baby
She so lovely, drives the man crazy
What else? Drives the man crazy
She’s so cute and i love the way she
Makes me feel hot under the ac
She’s so funny like chelsea lately
Baby keep on doing it cos your love is tasty
You are so beautiful, baby don’t frown
One in a million girl, you deserve the crown
I go in first then I take another round
When i’m full, shit is going down
This is for you. Not for the disco
Let me take away to San Francisco
Do you want me? Or you want sisquo
Hold up let me show you the koko: d’banj
Chorus
Come to me baby
And i will show my world to you, honey
If you run to me my lady
