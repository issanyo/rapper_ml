Hope you got what you paid for
Hope you got what you paid for
I ain’t even gotta say more
Hope you got what you paid for
Hope you got what you paid for
Hope you got what you paid for
I know you got what you paid for

Everybody balling, everybody winning
Ain’t nobody poor no more, everybody spending
Nar'll we just caught in a world that we call pretending
Where pretend to be niggas been pretending from the beginning…
The men and women are sinning, in a minute, ?? this gets them to them infants
They morals becoming so inconsistent
Little boy with his wrist slit, little girl thinking stripping is a business
That’s cause her mother wasn’t against it
Everybody getting it, everybody trappin
Who the heck is listening if everybody rapping
Kinda knew this was destined to happen
Rappers no realer than wrestlers who acting
And the message is lacking
But once again Saigon bringing you the realest
If I ain’t the illest, then what you talkin' about Willis
Feel it, GSNT, just repeat after...matter of fact, after you

Hope you got what you paid for

How you supposed to be the wildest and you got a stylist?
Say that you really smoke but never puffing out the chalice
Only clips you probably fuck with is Pusha and Malice
I told you to cut the bullshit, now you full of the cow piss
How’s this, I’m like Money Mayweather in round 6
Bout to start turning it up out this bitch
I’m 2 Legit like Stanley Burrell
I’ma die doing what I love, I’m the rap Tammy Terrell
Told Puffy my nose stuffy, dog I can’t even smell
Cause I’m sick from doing this shit, it's finna land me in jail
Tell Baby I need 80, and if not, then I’ma go holler at Shady
One of these motherfuckers is gonna pay me
I'm crazy and in the best shape of my life
State a price make it nice
You can go on vacation twice
I’m telling you man, I’m worth every bit of that 80 million dollars

Hope you got what you paid for

Before my daughter, before they bottled the water
We was flipping the bricks, see …slide to the border
Come back with some shit bout the size of rock of Gibraltar
Paper pussy power, came in chronologically order
Coola got locked, product was getting shorter
We knew he do some time and then the cops would deport him
Fuck the feds would record him in the comfort in his own home
He would just slip up and talk business on his own phone
We was on the home grown, he was blowing the hydro
I think it was hydro, how the fuck should I know?
I was ducking the 5-O, trying to get the case gone
Went to Miami to see family
I wasn’t trying to stay long, just to pick up enough yay to lay on
We still had enough to get way long

Hope you got what you paid for
Hope you got what you paid for
I ain’t even gotta say more
Hope you got what you paid for
Hope you got what you paid for
Hope you got what you paid for
I know you got what you paid for
