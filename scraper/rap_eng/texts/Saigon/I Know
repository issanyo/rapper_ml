Saigon - “I Know”
[Emcee(s): Saigon]
[Producer(s): Sha Money XL]
[Sample (Melody): Nelson Ned - “Jurame”]

[Hook: Saigon]
I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
Life got much more to offer me
And I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
The system treats us unlawfully
And I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
That a new day is yet to
Come, and I know (And I know) that
I’ll be right here with the nation

[Verse 1: Saigon]
We live in a
Place where babies are born addicted to base
If you get arrested, you’re likely to get kicked in your face
A lot of bitches is sick with the “H.”  If you don’t want the
“I.V.,” think before you put your dick in her waist
It’s a disgrace.  There’s only one particular race
That got fucked ever since we got shipped to the States
Like being trapped in a pit full of snakes.  They’re calling the coke
Dandruff—the ghetto been infected with flakes
I listen to rap but wouldn’t let my kid listen to that
‘Cause if my kid listen to that, then it’s a wrap
Niggas replace wisdom with materialism
I use the rhythm to preach about imperialism
I get on it like Martin Luther King and do the damn thing
Far as snitching go, I’m like J-Lo—I can’t sing
But I’ll eat you like a planet wing.  Let’s pop
A cop and then pop some champagne, then listen
Hear you sing

[Hook: Saigon]
I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
Life got much more to offer me
And I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
The system treats us unlawfully
And I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
That a new day is yet to
Come, and I know (And I know) that
I’ll be right here with the nation

[Verse 2: Saigon]
They got
Drugs of all sorts coming through their airports
Only once every five years somebody get caught.  How many
Lives must heroin cut short?  How many black folk
Gotta grow up to smoke, shoot, sniff, or snort? (Damn...)
We’re no longer serving them dimes to maneuver through turbulent
Times, me and my niggas murdering rhymes, my life
Read like a verse in the psalms, so it’s in the Quran
Word, bond, y’all gon’ worship the ‘Gon.  Con-
-vict since a young age, face plastered on the front page
Picture me working for minimum wage.  I went in
A rage, packed the MAC-10 and the gauge.  In
The streets, I seen more action than Nicholas Cage
Buck one for my niggas locked for using a gun
Buck two, hit them niggas that bucked Rule—fuck you!
Buck three for Lucky, buck four for all my dawgs
Up north.  Let’s get this jump off jumped off

[Hook: Saigon]
I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
Life got much more to offer me
And I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
The system treats us unlawfully
And I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
That a new day is yet to
Come, and I know (And I know) that
I’ll be right here with the nation
