[Verse 1]
Martin Luther King had more than a dream
He was out for social change and that sort of a thing
Tried to lead us to freedom, but before it would ring
He got blown away
He seen the problem and thought that he had to answer prolly
And that's the reason Huey started the Panther party
Wasn't for Hoover he'd be alive today
Bang, he got blown away
That man Clarence Smith was like a father to many
Was for the love cause the brother wasn't offered a penny
He said the black man was God and it costed him plenty
Was at the time when wasn't no police officers friendly
He birthed the five percent nation, call him the true and living
And just for that you know they whooped him and threw him in prison
Wasn't for them then he'd be with us today
Bang, he got blown away
Marvin Gaye wrote a song called ''What's Going On?''
The label said no, but he convinced them to go along
He spoke of Vietnam and the shit that was going wrong
Trying to convince people that they need to keep holding on
He sang ''Mercy Mercy Me'', it felt like he was crying
He want to save the hood, they understood why he was trying
He took a stand and said what he had to say
Bang, he got blown away
2Pac Shakur was more than a rapper, more than an actor
It was more than awards he was after
He tried to teach young, black people a better way
He got blown away
Hey, we gotta give it to him, Abraham Lincoln was honest
He was a racist, but he did what he said when he promised
He freed slaves, of course he was gonna pay
He got blown away
John F. Kennedy fought for the people
A white president, that wanted to see all of us equal
At least that was what he said when running for office to be to
But then he won and started doing more for the people
Assassin hit him with a bullet that tore his cerebral
I know a lot of y'all thinking ''we wanna believe you''
Black people prayed for JFK
But bang, he got blown away
Same way, Gosh, I can't forget Peter Tosh
If Bob Marley was Jigga then Tosh would be Nas
Peter was Bob right hand man, one hand washed
All of these brothers wanted more than to just to be large
Killer on the guitar, but better up on the mic
Y'all remember the revolutionary shit that he would write?
Like "get up, stand up, stand up for your right"
Bang, he got blown away
You damn right

Martin Luther King had more than a dream
He was out for social change and that sort of a thing
Tried to lead us to freedom, but before it would ring
He got blown away
2Pac Shakur was more than a rapper, more than an actor
It was more than awards he was after
He tried to teach young, black people a better way
He got blown away
Then there was Saigon, I brought you the greatest story
I know they watching me, I know that they waiting for me
I just pray that y'all heed what I had to say
Before I get blown away
