[Hook]
Baby, I know that you lying, probably gon' deny it
I know that you scheming when you say you going home
You think you can hide it, he calls you up on private
If your not with him now then baby kiss me through the phone
Swear your all alone
Than kiss me thru the phone
Or I'm gon leave you all alone

[Verse One]:
I bet right now you think your so smooth (right?)
You be running round town with your old dude (right?)
I’m not gonna act like I can’t see
When you come back home you won’t find me
I'mma be up late with my old girl
Phone will be on silent

[Hook]

[Verse Two]:
Don't try to play like I don’t know you (right)
I already called up …
That's my go to
I’m not gonna act like I can’t see
When you get back home you won’t find me
I'mma be up late with my old girl
Yeah, you think you so slick
You make me so sick

[Hook]
