[Hook]
See the politician
See him kiss the baby

[Verse 1]
It's the end of the way of life as we know it
This is the last straw
George Bush bout to declare the last war
So tell everybody you love you still love em
And if you got kids then take time to hug em
I don't really think that y'all know what niggas is facing
We are near the end of a twisted civilization
This isn't a nation
Cut all the money for education
And build more prisons as a replacement
How is that they could win a war against terror and
In the ghetto we losing the war against heroin
Where all the thoro men?
The Martins, the Malcolms
The ones that'll lose they life to change the outcome

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If we don't get 40 acres, then I think that blacks
At least shouldn't have to fucking pay sales tax
Gotta give us something back
GMC should give every black man a damn brand new 'lac
And we should all give em back
Tell em "we don't want that! Y'all listening to too much rap!"
Fucka, our will is strong now, can't nothing touch it
And we don't give a fuck if you keep cutting the budget
Niggas gon thug it, life live to the fullest and love it
And keep it rugged til we kick the bucket
I can't vote, and that's something I don't regret
Cause for the poor folks they ain't did shit yet

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To the NYPD, the LAPD
Whatever the hell they call the police in DC
I don't care if you a sergeant, a narc or a DT
You could even be just a security guard with a CB
And no gat, but I'ma act like I ain't even know that
This kill a cop mentality stem from me being pro-black
Out the pen and I ain't fin to go back
Won't fake no jack, if jake snap a Kodak
Instead I'll be forced to pull, cock back, unload the whole gat
I'll die controlling the MAC, telling the po to "hold that"
Whether he white, black, Irish, Italian, or Polack
Body thin as a Somalian or fat as Joe Crack

[Hook]

Do we really know where the guns come from?
Do we really know where the drugs come?
How come it only effects us and not them?
How come Jesus Christ has still not come?
Why am I wrong if I kill a nigga that punched me
But it's right for you to blow up a whole country?
