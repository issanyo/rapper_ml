[Hook – Saigon]
Does the Lord hear a sinner’s prayer?
When I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there?
As I look at this crook in the mirror
With all this dirt on my hair
Does the Lord hear a sinner’s prayer?
This is a sinner's prayer
When I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there?
As I look at this crook in the mirror
With all this dirt on my hair
Does the Lord hear a sinner’s prayer?

[Verse 1 – Saigon]
If they wishin' to be dishonest
I think they got they mission accomplished
We still don't know the real definition of Congress
I love the Obamas—Barack and Michelle
But it's been five years, my block still hot as hell
Ain't nobody else gon' say it, I might as well
If you don't like the beat, well, then play this shit acapell'
Somethin' you need to hear—I'm like the new Makavell'
With a lot to tell, I can change the game by myself
But I said, "Fuck all that, I'm finna call Pap"
His phone dead, left him a message to call back
It's all black everything, everything all black
Even our mind frames—we taking it all back
You niggas say, “Brian, you delusional
You read too many books in the pen, and them muhfuckers confusin' you”
Fathe,r forgive me for not living so positively
My apologies, Lord, please, Father, forgive me

[Verse 2 – Papoose]
A sinner's prayer.  It's almost over—the end is near
Judgement Day.  Didn't rush to this moment, but did prepare
I couldn't see through the weed smoke—it's getting clear
Good eyes of 20/20 vision peer
Always take my wife's advice that she said in the prison chair
‘Cause the females are very observant and women stare
"You should fear nothin' but God.”  I didn't care
I said, “I'd rather die in courage than live in fear”
Lied on a stack of Bibles in court, but didn't swear
Both boots stand in a square of truth—I'm in a square
Told Rosa Parks that nigga seats are in the rear
Now the White House is the Black House, we livin' there
It's not like I had knowledge that I didn't share
Breathe life into the mentally dead, I give 'em air
Ride 'til the wheels fall off, a shirt the quitters wear
Jack it up and change that tire, we ride with a spare

[Hook – Saigon]
Does the Lord hear a sinner’s prayer?
When I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there?

Does the Lord hear a sinner’s prayer?
This is a sinner's prayer
When I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there?
As I look at this crook in the mirror
With all this dirt on my hair
Does the Lord hear a sinner’s prayer?

[Verse 3 – Omar Epps]
First off, here's a theory to quote
Tryna hide from the eyes of God is really a joke
No matter your area codes, just the various folks
Who wanna walk amongst the King, but they barely get close, and, uh
Masquerade with your blasphemous ways
Claim you masters of the universe but actually slaves
Those shenanigans will get you smacked in your face
Exposed like mannequins before they back on display—get it?
Instead of feeding people the truth
They propagandize everything you see on the news
Misleading the youth.  But they can't imprison your mind
You don't need 20/20 to see niggas is blind
[?] from the biblical time
Now is that subtracting or adding to your spiritual crimes?
You don't wanna listen?  Nigga, close your ears
When you get caught up, the system will divulge your fears
