[Verse 1: Saigon]
Them hundred ki's you said you flipped in the track (that's rap)
Max B fighting for that appeal (that's real)
That little bitch you letting dance on your lap (that's rap)
The fact she molested since she was lil' (that's real)
Hundred thousand dollar link on your neck (that's rap)
But when them niggas put that gat in your grill (that's real)
Coming through sitting clean in a 'Lac (that's rap)
When the bullets hitting your windshield (that's real)

[Hook]
There's a very big difference 'tween what's rap and what's real
When those worlds collide, that's when rappers get killed
Trappers, they go to jail, die without leaving a will
There's a very big difference 'tween what's rap and what's real
There's a very big difference 'tween what's rap and what's real

[Verse 2]
Making money while you taking a crap (that's rap)
Tru Life fighting for that appeal (that's real)
You in the club and you always strapped (that's rap)
Ask Shyne how that ten years feel (that's real)
You make it rain, you be throwing them stacks (that's rap)
And when your daughter choose to work in that field (that's real)
Niggas gassing you to ride with your strap (that's rap)
You should listen to who's telling you chill (that's real)

[Hook]
There's a very big difference 'tween what's rap and what's real
When those worlds collide, that's when rappers get grilled
Niggas out here got to steal for their next meal
There's a very big difference 'tween what's rap and what's real
There's a very big difference 'tween what's rap and what's real

[Verse 3]
Every night a different chick in the sack (that's rap)
And when the doctor got you taking them pills (that's real)
Balling hard, but don't be paying your tax (that's rap)
Uncle Sam says you owe him some mills (that's real)
Telling niggas you grew up in a shack (that's rap)
But really you lived in a house on the hills (that's real)
Said black music setting us back (that's rap)
But Hip-Hop is uplifting us still (that's real)

[Hook]
There's a very big difference tween what's rap and what's real
When those worlds collide, that's when rappers sit still
Lotta Niggas fronting they really fitting the bill
There's a very big difference 'tween what's rap and what's real
There's a very big difference 'tween what's rap and what's real
