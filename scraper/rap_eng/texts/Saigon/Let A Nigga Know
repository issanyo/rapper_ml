[Verse 1]
Let a nigga know
You wanna go to war, bop
You wanna hear the 44 pop (Let A Nigga Know)
You wanna see the gun that will make more than just your jaw drop
(Let A Nigga Know)
You wanna mess with the best
But do you want to save your mama some stress?
Nigga, if you really want to test
(Let A Nigga Know)
I'll come and chop you in half
My click is cuckoo for cocoa
They'll pop you and laugh (Let A Nigga Know)
Wanna do gun play?
Monday through Sunday
All 52 weeks of the year
Am I speaking clear? (Let A Nigga Know)
You feel my flow (Let A Nigga Know)
Even though I'm so political
Ain't another MC as gangsta as me, shit I should be signed to Death Row
Uh, oh, there go Saiyo
AK nine six at yo 5-0
Mind blow to your spinal
You only a thug on vinyl
You soft, I know
And yo so is your rhyme flow
I'm the only rapper to
Ever shoot up the club
Me and my man Shyne Po
I pop up in a hot car
You hop up in the cop car
Then start telling the cops
Who's selling the rocks
And who the niggas on the block are

[Hook x2]
I puts it down
I know they like the way my shit sounds
Banging from the hood out to the hick towns
Everything that I spit is hit bound, they on my shit now

[Verse 2]
Gotta get that money like Krayzie, Layzie and Bizzy Bone
Trying to take mine from me
What kind of crazy shit is you on?
Let a kid act funny, I'll lace him like when my kicks is on
We in the zone, nigga clips is thrown
We don't go to war with no sticks and stones, home
Wanna play Gin Rummy
Then shuffle the cards and deal 'em out
But if you get picked up then
Then we trust that you not going to squeal us out
I'm in the cut with a chick
With a bigger butt than Trina
And a better face than Jigga's slut
Nigga, I'm Saigon, you understand that?
I bang them firearms, you wanna wear that?
Cause if you was, now you not
You done fucked with the wrong one, now you shot
I'll even give it to a cop, motherfucker
You the chump, I'm not, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
I put's it down, man, man, what, let a nigga know
Who the best, let a nigga know
My name Saigon, man, see me in the streets
Don't look at me funny, just, let a nigga know
You don't want drama do you? (Let A Nigga Know)
