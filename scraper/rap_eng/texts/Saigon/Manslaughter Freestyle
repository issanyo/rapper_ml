[Verse 1: Saigon]
Hey, fool!  Get off my cloud
You don't know pal, my gun go BLAO!
Another brother confused and I'm so foul
Another mother will lose one mo' child
People said, "Josephine, your son's so wild
What could make him run so wild?
You better keep his ass out of the street or else he gon' go down
Run around here with guns like he the king of the whole town
Yesterday, he showed me a fo'-pound
Loaded clips, swearin' to God he won't waste no round"
My mom give 'em a fake smile and turn 'em away
She used to seein' her baby with the burner and HEY
And yo, before she let him get away, she stop him and say
You know what she say? (No, what did she say?)
She say, she say, "What do you say to a kid that'd take his life and give it away
And only live for the day?"
I was just talkin' to the lil' nigga today
And when he play with that thing, I make him put it away
She say, "What do you say to a kid who been in and out of court
Since his ass was like four feet short?"
I don't know what the fuck y'all thought
That lil' nigga is a gangsta.  Haha
And now my mom's tellin' me to listen
"Son, you can't afford another felony conviction
They got you labeled as a menace to this jurisdiction
They gon' try come get you and stick you in a prison
Son, I know you only a victim of the system
Giuliani hate your black skinâ€”you could even ask him
