[Intro]
Cause it’s cold
And I’m cold

It’s so cold in the streets
It’s so cold anywhere that you go
Somebody take me to another place
A place where it ain’t so cold

Cause it’s cold
And I’m cold

[Verse 1]
My mama with my grandmama now
I wonder what they saying when they looking down
Wonder if I made em proud
I made it this far, I wonder if that made em smile
I took something so wild and I made a mile
But now people taking my kindness for a weakness
Talking shit about me like I ain’t one of the deepest
Like I ain’t connected to them niggas with them sweepers
That’d be happy to introduce fools to the Grim Reaper
You think you know me cause you seen me on a website
Well did you know I’m in some drama almost every night?
I never said to be a fucking celebrity
So I don’t what people think give em the right to mess with me
Feeling like they testing me, getting ready to lose control
Mama would’ve said use music, it soothes the soul (I know)
I try to live my life on cruise control
But I feel the need to speed right now baby bro cause it’s cold

[Hook]
It’s so cold in the streets
It’s so cold anywhere that you go
Somebody take me to another place
A place where it ain’t so cold

Cause it’s cold
And I’m cold

[Verse 2]
My mama with my grandfather now
If Heaven got a ghetto they in that part of town
I wonder if it get cold up there in the clouds
Cause down here Jack Frost ain’t fucking around
Even in the summertime you can feel the windchill
Shots light up the night, niggas getting it in still
This is where we call home, shit is like a warzone
Try to dress warm, put your long john drawers on, homie it’s cold
And you gonna need more than some hot chocolate
Cause when it’s on somebody spitting them Glock rockets
Say you seen something, they aim for your eye sockets
This is our hustle and no you cannot knock it
Freezing out here, you would think that it was winter season I swear
Everywhere you could turn the Feds and the D’s is right there
Shit is like a freaking nightmare

[Hook]
It’s so cold in the streets
It’s so cold anywhere that you go
Somebody take me to another place
A place where it ain’t so cold

Cause it’s cold
And I’m cold

We’ll be gunning on the block busting off shots
To this deep on the block you got me locked down and it’s cold
Cold world, shit real
