[Hook]:
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Breathe through the years
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Breathe through the years
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you

[Verse One] [Saigon]:
The come to the ghetto to murder raid it
When they need to see what it is
That's makin' they fuckin' kids impersonate it
Me and my cousin were related
Till I heard that he snitched
Shit made me so sick I regurgitated
Sometimes I wonder why I used to lie to my mom
What was it that made me ride with a chrome the size of my arm?
I neglected Elijah Moham'
Said I'd rather die on my feet then live like a survivor from 'Nam
Sai to the gon
Front, pop pop and you're gone
Cause me and a frontin' ass nigga could not get along
When I drop June 1st, 12 o'clock in the morn'
That's the day that Flex will drop a fuckin' hydrogen bomb
And when I'm shittin' I ain't forgettin' brothers who been it
Even though the tie sorta died, the love for you didn't
What are you kidding?
I remember the talks about Squizard (what else?)
Niggas fuckin' with lizards
Goin' months without visits

[Hook]:
Breathe through the years
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Dead or alive
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Breathe through the years
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Dead or alive
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you

[Verse Two] [Saigon]:
And why is that in whatever case
Somebody died, they say that he in a better place
Even though when he was alive he never prayed
Cause he was too busy focusing on the cheddar chase
You think God just wiped all of his sins away?
You think the reverend's convincing all of his friends today?
You think they really believe though he was dealin' ki's
That he'd be up in Heaven with some of them ill MC's?
Please
You think if there really is a God
He'd agree with the man that did JoAnne Chesimard
Fuck nah
You listen to what I learn to tell
I got a prophecy, them crackers that framed Herman Bell gon' burn in Hell
Cause God don't like ugly
And it's a shame it's the brother that's the same color as me that's gon' mug me
What's even worse than that, I'm gon' plug him
Police put another body in the bag, zip it and say fuck 'em
They don't love 'em

[Hook]:
Breathe through the years
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Dead or alive
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Breathe through the years
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Dead or alive
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you

[Verse Three]:
I said the drama's pitiful
Little niggas is homicidal
Couple meals ago, shorty was eatin' through his umbilical
Now he feel he unkillable
Shit is all amazin'
The wrong altercation will leave his ass with a long abrasion
I try to make my life the focal through rhymes
These niggas do vocal booth crime
I shot niggas multiple time
You sold a few dimes
But when you rappin' you the crack king
I sold it to whites when you thought it was just a black thing
I'm filled with this realness
Rappers happen to lack it
I'm flabbergasted you got a platinum plaque for that wack shit
Sick of this ridiculousness
Any lyricist that claim he wicked as this
Will die with his dick in his fist
Get twist with just a flick of a wrist
What you gon' hide slick?
Fuck it Rick, got a flick and ya miss
We ain't gon' kill 'em just cripple the bitch
So it's torture when the nickle hit
I'm psychopathically sick as triple six
I won't miss bitch
Nah

[Hook]:
Breathe through the years
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Dead or alive
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Breathe through the years
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
Dead or alive
I don't know 'bout you, I don't know 'bout you
