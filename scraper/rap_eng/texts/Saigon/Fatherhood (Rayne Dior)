[Intro – Saigon]
It’s crazy ‘cause… When I look at you, it’s like… It’s like, it’s like… It’s like I’m looking at me…  It’s like I’m looking at me…  Saigitty

[Verse 1 – Saigon]
You got your father’s lips.  You got your father’s nose
You got your father’s eyes—a nice surprise, that’s the part that glows
Can’t wait to watch you grow—so much I can’t sit still
Can’t wait to teach you to fly a kite and ride a bike without them training wheels
You’ll see some things that’s real.  Life—it can be so cruel
But I’ll be right there every step of the way—yes, baby, I promise you
I’ll be the dad that mom wasn’t.  Gotta be responsible and I does it
In the hospital, the chord—I cut it.  The more I live it, the more I love it (What’s that?)
It’s fatherhood.  Do everything that a father should
Promise to raise you well from through K through 12, then you run off to college—good
And if you happen to come home from prom late (What?!?)
You know daddy gonna pick up your prom date
After he swear on his life he [?] get a kiss, I’mma hit him in his lip and I’m straight
You got your father’s cheeks.  You got your father’s feet
I know you got your father’s heart, so it’s the hardest beat
I wanted a boy, but you came.  But no pleasure measure the joy you bring
I wanted a boy, but you came.  But no pleasure measure the joy you bring, Rayne

[Chorus – Lokz]
Rain on me
There will be sunshine
Just rain on me
I’ll be there for you
Just rain on me
Wait for the sunrise
The rain’s gotta fall—I’ll be there through it all
The pain—I’ll be right by your side

[Verse 2 – Lokz]
Apologize.  I’m caught up in my ways
But I just gotta hustle babe—so you don’t have to
So many things that I’ve been tryna change
So I can be the man you look up to
You might not be aware
[?]
I’ll show you I care
When someone breaks your heart, I’ll be right there
If they try to hurt you, just remember: ain’t no man who deserve you

[Saigon]
I’mma be the only man you need, baby girl.  I promise…

[Chorus – Lokz]
Rain on me
There will be sunshine
Just rain on me
I’ll be there for you
Just rain on me
Wait for the sunrise
The rain’s gotta fall—I’ll be there through it all
The pain—I’ll be right by your side

[Verse 3 – Saigon]
Rayne Dior—you’re my savior
The second that you was born, I swore the tree shakes better than it did the day before
Let me slow this down.  I need for you to know this now
I’ll rap, rob, shake, bake—whatever it may take to hold us down
And it might sound cliché, but I’m loving you much more each day
Even though me and mother don’t click, if it benefits you, I’ll do whatever she say
That’s fatherhood.  You my proof that God is good
And when the day turn gray, I ain’t staying away—I’m just praying to God it would

[Chorus – Lokz]
Rain on me
There will be sunshine
Just rain on me
I’ll be there for you
Just rain on me
Wait for the sunrise
The rain’s gotta fall—I’ll be there through it all
The pain—I’ll be right by your side
