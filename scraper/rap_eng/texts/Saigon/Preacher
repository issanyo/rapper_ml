I'm seeing you man you doing your thing
I see the new shoes, suits and a ring
Since when are you into bling?
A reverend’s supposed to lead like Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King
You more like Pastor Offering
I'mma come down to your church, man
How much does it cost again?
God know a nigga struggling bad
He know a nigga probably need whatever he has
And you insist, I give you some 10 percent
When I can barely even pay my own rent
I got a old ’94 Pontiac
You ride around this bitch in a new 'lac
You should be hitting us with some bread
But instead you hitting us in the head
For 5s, 10s, 20s, 50s, 100s
Are you telling this is cause God want it?

You ain’t practicing what you preach man
Nah you extorting us on the weekend
Rob stealing and running a game
Getting filthy rich in god’s name
(Preacher)
You ain’t practicing what you preach man
Nah you extorting us on the weekend
Rob, stealing and running a game
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame

I’m seeing you man you doing it big
Both of your kids be coming to church jig
Wife rocking a five-thousand dollar wig
And she got a big rock on her hand
Did y'all run a scam?
Cause we was fucking dependent on section 8
But always had something to put in the collection plate
It was always so strange it was odd
To see my mama scratching up change to give it to God
I think we all knew nobody’s saying shit
You was using that to pay your car payments
We was motherfucking paying your mortgage
And we was living in the projects
You know we couldn’t afford it
But that’s how you was on it
You would come to church and talk it
But I doubt you would walk it
You probably come to America and Arsenio Hall it
Make me wanna just snatch you off of the pulpit

You ain’t practicing what you preach man
Nah you extorting us on the weekend
Rob stealing and running a game
Getting filthy rich in god’s name
(Preacher)
You ain’t practicing what you preach man
Nah you extorting us on the weekend
Rob, stealing and running a game
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame

That politician ain’t really a politician
He a (preacher)
We voted him in to be a leader
But he a (preacher)
Promises better living conditions
Soon as he gets the position, switches his disposition
It’s the (preacher)
It’s not only the guys in the church
But it’s the (preacher) got a lot of swish words
How the hell could we survive on this Earth
When ya’ll come flood the ghetto with guns, drugs and legalize bottles of erk and jerk
My cousin on Percocet
He gave out a murder threat
They caught him, shot up his legs and them fuckers ain’t working yet
Bloomberg banned cigarettes
Why he ain't banned letting police man beat on niggas yet
Ya’ll know that the shit I’m saying is true
Ignore it if it ain’t pertaining to you
But if the (preacher) don’t walk it like he talk it
Then dammit, doggone it, that nigga got some explaining to do

You ain’t practicing what you preach man
Nah you extorting us on the weekend
Rob stealing and running a game
Getting filthy rich in god’s name
(Preacher)
You ain’t practicing what you preach man
Nah you extorting us on the weekend
Rob, stealing and running a game
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame
