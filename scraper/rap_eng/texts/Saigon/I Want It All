[Hook]

I want it all
I want the cars and the fancy things
I want the life this success shit bring
I want the love and the power and respect, that’s the way it seems
I said I want it all
I said I want it all

[Verse 1]

I wanna ball like Lebron or Chris Paul
But what I want even more is to finally get in the door
I want the critics to give me the credit that I deserve
Wanna show em how vicious a nigga is with the verbs
Want the Burger King burger with the McDonald’s fries
Want the Marriott but wanna save money so it’s the Econo Lodge
I want people to see that I was popping way before Entourage, flow you cannot describe
I wanna know if my sister fucking, if she’s protected
I want that President Obama to get re-elected
I want the kind of rhyming I’m doing to be accepted
Since my rhyme was silent at times I’ll probably be rejected
I want longevity, I want Saigon to be strong as I’ll ever be
When I’m going on seventy
I want mom’s recipe, sweet potato pie was to die for
I want a reply y’all

[Hook]

I want it all
I want the cars and the fancy things
I want the life this success shit bring
I want the love and the power and respect, that’s the way it seems
I said I want it all
I said I want it all

[Verse 2]

I want the Beamer, Benz, and Bentley
Even though that I know they come with jealousy and envy
I want people to be honest even when it offends me
Unless they wanna wake up the violence that’s deep within me
I wanna thank everybody that want the dark to shine
I wanna earn the true dollar sign without doing blue-collar crime
I want you and you to learn how to rhyme
You can’t call yourself an MC if what you’re spewing is five and dime
I want the kids in the ghetto to go to school
By the multitude want them to know that flunking is so uncool
I wanna know who’s relating gangbanging with entertainment
Probably the same dude that’ll be the complainant
I want the paintings, y’all could buy up the jewelery
I want hip hop to stop providing this buffoonery
I want the opportunity, I promise on mamas I won’t stall
I’m telling you ?

[Hook]

I want it all
I want the cars and the fancy things
I want the life this success shit bring
I want the love and the power and respect, that’s the way it seems
I said I want it all
I said I want it all

[Verse 3]

I want to send a rest in peace to Mr. Mass Appeal
I wanna feel if Nicki Minaj ass is real
I wanna know if you dangerous or a daffodil
Like do you want this machete or want this Massengill
I wanna welcome myself back into rap
Y’all can clap or have an asthma attack
As a matter of fact I want everybody imagining that
I was the one out of the pack that ain’t going staggering back
I wanna welcome myself back into rap
Y’all can clap or have an asthma attack
As a matter of fact you think I came this far for me to motherfucking fall?
Hell nah

[Outro]

I said I want it all
