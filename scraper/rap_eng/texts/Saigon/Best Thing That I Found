[Hook: Corbett]
Another face, in the crowd
Fall from grace, I'm comin down
You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found
You lost your way, I lost my crown
I'm still here, feet on the ground
You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found, that I found

[Verse 1: Saigon]
Uhh, uh
I used to get these feelings and think of these crazy things
But when you shine your light on me it's like you gave me wings
I thought I was depressed, you showed me how much more I was blessed
I'm thankin you Lord, this I could confess
You know more than anybody all that I had to go through
I heard you when you said that's just somethin I had to show you
For me to get to know you like I know you
And when the Reaper tried to come to get me you came to save me, I owe you
Some call you Jesus as Father, some say you the holy ghost
I know you love me cause when things get ugly you hold me close
This is why I try to live the life of just righteousness
Feelin like the opposite, somethin you wouldn't like for us
Coulda easily got addicted and couldn't kick it
You told me to never try it, that's why I never did it
Heavenly Father never forget it
My life without you, I'd just rather not live it
I'm just

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, not ashamed of my pain, not ashamed of my struggle
I lost some battles but I'm still out here facin this trouble
Facin my trials cause they only make me stronger
Starvin in these streets will only elevate your hunger
Beat me down and laughed at me, tell me that this is foolishness
They can't take my hope away from me, nobody's movin it
Faith ain't what you make it, faith is all I got to make it
Tired of you forsakin, you naked left in the vacant
Forget them naysayers and haters and stay at it
Sometimes a dream broken is a dream worth havin
Passions passed in my pastor, can't rewind it and back up
Focus fixed on the future so tell my failures to back up
Get back up after you fall when yo' back is up on that wall
Ain't no backup that you control, just look back up at God and call
Uhh, sometimes the pain is the motivation of trust
And them scars are the evidence that the journey was rough
Yeah, none of it was in vain, re-adjusted the aim
Missed a couple of shots, still ain't out of the game

[Hook]

[Outro: Saigon]
Uhh..
And we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray
S to the A and my little brother Lecrae
DJ, Corbett, ha ha
We all got faith, in that man upstairs
Hallelujah, amen, thank you
