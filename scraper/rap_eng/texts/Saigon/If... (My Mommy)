[Intro]
I dedicate this song to that one special lady.  That lady who never, never turned her back on a nigga.  That one lady who no other woman could be—no matter what, man.  Let’s reflect for a moment, my real

[Hook]
If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me

[Verse 1]
I wrote about stickin' the mamis
Wrote about lickin' the tommy
It's time for me to write some shit for my mommy
My mother, and not only to tell her I love her
But to show her how the pen can cause her kid to grow up
I don't even be lying no more.  Ma, I'm honest
I'm not playing with guns no more neither, I promise
I'm not hanging with the donnas
He my dog and I love him but fuckin' with son is just too much drama
I wonder how it would be if you had the chance to raise me
Would I still not know how to romance a lady?
Is it ‘cause you made me a cancer baby
That I stay on some crab shit so nobody get the chance to portray me?
Whatever it is, yo, I ain't tryin' to let it go
I'm focused ma—I know what I'm headed for
And, oh, before I let you go
You might not knew it before, so I'm telling you now to let you know

[Hook]
If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me

For real.  Every day, ma.  All that I own.  Ya know?  You been good, ya know?  Even when you couldn’t be there, you was there.  You know what I mean.  You what’m saying?  You what’m saying?

[Verse 2]
I remember the everyday arguments
Part of it was fuckin' with my common sense
The other part of it gave me the confidence
To do what I was doing
Only if I knew what I was doing
When, what, and who was I pursuing
Being twelve years old, guzzlin' gold
Coming home drunk.  You crying while I stumble and fold
‘Member you had your son like a bum in the cold
‘Cause you was movin' my kicks and found jumbs in the sole?
But, man, I was a young man just runnin' the road
Tryin’ to make a little crumbs ‘cause wasn't none in my bowl
I hated to see you struggle for gold
When you really deserved ice, double the cold
That glow like your colorful soul
Mom, my love for you has wanted to grow
Last ten times stronger than any couple that's old
And, oh, before I let you go
You might not knew it before, so I'm telling you now to let you know

[Hook x2]
If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me

Everything.  All that I own.  Ya know?  Shit it real, man.  I put my life on the line, son.  This rap shit ain’t gassed up.  You know what’m saying?

[Verse 3]
Yo, I said they could never give enough cheddar to me
To talk about the lady that made me negatively
Even though eye to eye’s something we never could see
My mother's the one woman no other one ever could be
See?  She gon' be proud when I blow like Nagasaki
Don't ever regret lettin' them cell blocks adopt me
Jail was a blessin', mommy.  My nation stood by me
They got me in places regular faces can't find me
And Omega, my crimey (what he say?), told me I'm so ahead of my time
Even when they fast forward, niggas rewind me
I learned about Malcom, Marcus, and Kwame
About the white man—why he feed us spiced ham
Spam, and salami.  Lyrically they can't deny me
All I need is your love, your trust and just for you to stand by me
And, oh, yo before I let you go
You might not knew it before so I'm telling you now to let you know

[Hook]
If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me

Every day.  All that I own.  Ya know?  This song is for all the mothers in the world.  Everybody’s mother.  The deceased mothers.  Rest in peace, mothers

Yeah, that’s real shit, man.  Real talk, man.  I love you, ma.  Word up.  For everything, yo.  Let’s get back into some street shit
