There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now...
So I know we'll be alright

When niggas tell you don't hurt nobody they being funny
When they say its Saigon they mean its money
Ever since I was little bitches say he a dummy
Because one year I went to church and beat up the Easter bunny
Everyday I thank god with silent pray
So he can help me resolve some of my violent ways
I was locked up for four hundred holidays
I was in the peezee when I heard Easy E and Dr. Dre
Was in the pen for that bad boy death row thing
I was locked away when Dre was crowned west coast king
I'm the thug these rappers trying to be
Lyrically I'm a fuckin anomaly
You as much of a rapper as Sean John and me
Matter of fact you an actor like Sean Connery
I'm the nigga wit the rap sheet longer then your rap book
Hustlers got their chain snatched and they got their crack took

There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now...
So I know we'll be alright

Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin'
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'
New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with
Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
But we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, "never disrespect me"
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me

There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down
Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright
