[Intro]
Do you think music has a meaning?
Oh, yeah, definitely, it’s good to be more spiritual sooner than anything.  Pretty soon, I believe that we’re gonna have to rely on music to, uh, like, get some peace of mind, or satisfaction, direction, actually, more so than politics
Uh huh.  True shit

[Verse 1 – Saigon]
Stop rappin’ like a tough nigga
Start a label, now you actin’ like you Puff, nigga?
That’ll get you snuffed, nigga
I went from gangsta to good guy—you gotta love it
And if I had a heart, this would come from the bottom of it
Go ‘head talk shit on the blog, dog, I can snub it
But what’s gon’ happen is clappin’ when we collide in public
It's still conscious, but this time it’s hostile
This time I’m hittin’ these niggas with

[Hook – P. Jericho]
Street gospel
Listen in with these ears, breathe me in with these nostrils (breathe in)
I am an evangelist (teach), dream, I’ll be a realist (seek)
I speak the truth, preach to the streets
I’mma cut these words to the people I reach
You hit ‘em with a little bit of street gospel (The renegade’s renaissance)
I’ve got the street gospel (The renegade’s renaissance)
Do you want the street gospel? (Oh Lord, oh Lord)
Forgive me for the sins I’ve done
My cup runneth over with a little bit of street Gospel

[Verse 2 – Saigon]
Now that Chief Keef fly, they gon’ kiss him goodbye
But look how many people had to die
Last night in my dream, I seen Mr. Jimmy Iovine
All that I could do is ask him why (why?)
I said, “Jimmy, who you got speakin’ at these marketin’ meetins’?
Why do poor people the target they seeking?
When all they promotin’ is sex and violence and this office is creepin’
They got the things to keep your heart from beatin’ (pow!)
Tellin’ a kid that sellin’ drugs will make his life less hard
‘Cause he’s eatin’ like sayin' he can get through all it by cheatin’
This just not a reality.  Interscope’s thrivin’
‘Cause they givin’ us swimming pools of liquor to dive in
Gave us N.W.A., Game, the gangbanging lane
And now this lil’ nigga (bang bang)
He says, “Saigon, you got it wrong.  I’m just the guy that make it possible” (To what?)

[Hook – P. Jericho]
To hit ‘em with a little bit of street gospel (The renegade’s renaissance)
I’ve got the street gospel (The renegade’s renaissance)
Do you want the street gospel? (Oh Lord, oh Lord)
Forgive me for the sins I’ve done
My cup runneth over with a little bit of street Gospel

[Verse 3 – Saigon]
They said it was imperative for me to be negative
To make a name in the record biz and get the executives
To invest money in music that's infectin’ the kids
In this ghetto, they kids’ll never live, but mine are subjected to this?
Nah, I can’t see that happenin’
‘Specially with a nigga like me that’s rappin’
He who is not packin’ is he that's lackin’
I'm ready, if you ever wanna see that action
Gotta understand I’m not the kind of a man
Who allow a dude to be rude and take some food outta my hand
Got a devise a plan to show ‘em that I’mma stand
My ground.  Try and bring me down like tryna drown Aquaman
And I can’t see that happenin’
‘Specially with a nigga like me that’s clappin’
Saigon graduated from your puppet to apostle
I was born to hit my people with

[Hook – P. Jericho]
Street gospel
