[Intro: Davis Absolute]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Here we go
Here we go
Let's go

[Hook: Sean Simmonds]
If they guess where I'm at
Tell 'em, I'm right here
I stand beside a giant
There resides no fear
Oh no
I never ride
Solo
I hear the cry
Hold on
We gon' fly
Ay-yi yi yi
On cloud nine
We go so high
Can't bring us down, we so fly
Hold on
I know it won't
Be long
Until we see His face
It was well worth the wait
When we meet Him in the sky

[Verse 1: Saigon]
I'm deep as the crevasses on the ocean floor
But I can fly, see me walking through that open door
I'm no longer reminding them how I broke the law
Sold dope before and left a boy with a broken jaw
So much more I can focus on
I'm noticing hope is gone
Y'all beat us in the head with all these bogus songs
They ask if I really believe in God
Why would He let evil people eat while His people starve
I tell them, every question asked don't need to be solved
Like when they ask why I named myself after Vietnam
No need to be alarmed
I might not can't read a palm
But I can see the future as clear as tomorrow
I'm down surrounded by murder by the pound, death row
Row, row the boat further down the Nile
The Nile is the penal
They have a ni**a there until he senile
Yeah
Off-top like a real freestyle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Davis Absolute]
Until then I'm sitting here on Heaven's steps
If minutes is millenniums there's only seconds left
They chasin' a meal, eat a slug, before their second breath
If they make it to the table, find there's only seconds left
What you expect to get
Or recollect, from those who never represent
Heaven sent a teacher
If I'm speaking it's lesson then it's completed infinite evidence
Placed within a grace that is measureless
Measured by could never be meddled with
They say we gotta see it
Take a hike, never buy what they peddling
You can keep it
Plenty liars, slick with the penmanship
Put me in a Colosseum with the red letters then
Pray I stay strong, even if they bear arms
On your boy, call me the revenant
Son of the Father, servant staying true to his purpose, pray to Yahweh alone and find rest in His worship
I look to the thrown whenever I'm stressed and I'm worried
He leads me by the still waters, I'm never hurried

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Swift]
Until then, I'm here, life defining my position
Face forward what's this climb without opposition
Head in the clouds, but not enough a distraction here to supply what they lackin'
I'm plotting a plan of action
Before they start saying sold it all for the masses
Naw
Just had to deliver these doses in fractions
Let my brothers know they come from kings not n***as
And plot thicker than just having a thing for pulling triggers
Ain't saying nothing that they wasn't saying before
What you expect when they tellin' us not to aim to be more
As long as I'm breathing I'm staying my course
Even if it cost me my life from pointing them straight to the source
I tried to tell 'em that God is peace
That's not big enough
Do anything to be free, but still a prisoner
The chain is heavy, so is the burden
To inform, to be continued on Higher Learnin'

[Hook] (x2)
