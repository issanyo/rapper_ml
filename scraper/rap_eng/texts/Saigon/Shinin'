Chorus [Carlitta Durand]

Today's a good day, sun is shinin'
Windows down in the ride (shouts to The Sonix)
Today's gonna be the day, see me ridin'
I'm gonna live my life

Verse 1 [Reign Man]

Look, What a sunny day, I got a great feelin'
I woke up this mornin' feelin like 8 billion
Hopped in the shower, and then within a hour
I was sharper than a steak knife, blowin' on my sour
Call my brother H up, told his a**s wake up
Get dressed, let's hit the barber shop and get a shape-up
Party tonight, at least part of the night
Bob Marley to light, Ciroc on deck
Bacardi and ice, and a buildin' full of bad girls
That wanna get spanked, rather naughty and nice
For now we enjoyin' the weather
Back yard barbeque me and my boys'll get together
We stay away from beef, we avoid it whenever
Keep the peace but we keep a piece boy it's whatever
I'm just sayin' don't get outta line
It's a good day the sun is just beginnin' to shine

Chorus [Carlitta Durand]

Today's a good day, sun is shinin'
Windows down in the ride
Today's gonna be the day, see me ridin'
I'm gonna live my life

Verse 2 [Saigon]
I put some pep in the step and the black steel conceal weapons on my waist
Say my grace, smoke my buddha unlaced
Fatal walk the block and clockin' kings county I say
Forget the wild way
Today I'm peacable, f**k all the foul play
Laid it for schemin', bet, we'll come to an agreement
Let the kids sell they cracks, we just make 'em pay tax
But if they fake jacks, you know flavour neighbor they die
We gon' give it a try, so all in favour say I
Feel like a walk in the park, could broaden my horizons
Realise I'm st, I'm still survivin' I'm strivin'
Open since I woken, lots smokin', no jokin
Check some b***s,--------, not provoke in case they get they snot box broken
N**a you know how I live, it's only a once a year I buy a teddy bear for my ---
But today god, somethin's gotten into me
Tryna cease crime throwin' peace signs to my enemies (peace god)

Chorus [Carlitta Durand]

Today's a good day, sun is shinin'
Windows down in the ride
Today's gonna be the day, see me ridin'
I'm gonna live my life

Verse 3 [Reign Man]
The sun's still shinin', it's 3 o'clock
Ma homie just pulled up we 'bout to leave the block
Put bezerk on blast until the speakers pop
Headed to the next barbeque my brothers eat a lot
Lets go
Go the windows down on the ride
Today a good day so I'm down for the ride
See my homie scorp, he said he down for a drive
Hopped in, pulled out a dutch and said who down to get high?
So we sparks, then we park
Then we shot a couple hoops at the park
Sun is goin' down, it gettin' dark
My life is like a movie so I gotta play my part
Strollin' through my phone got women in abundance
Feelin' like a kid to see who I could have some fun with
Drama proof sucka free, that s**t I'm done with
Today a good day big shouts out to London

Chorus [Carlitta Durand]

Today's a good day, sun is shinin'
Windows down in the ride
Today's gonna be the day, see me ridin'
I'm gonna live my life
