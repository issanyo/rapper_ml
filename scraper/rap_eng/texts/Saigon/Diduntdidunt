[Intro – Saigon]
See, John was a diduntdidunt, know'm sayin’?  That’s the whole point.  My man John was a fuckin’ diduntdidunt.  Holla.  You know you got them diduntdidunt niggas in the hood, know'm sayin’?  Niggas who don't mean nothin’ to nobody and shit.  Fuckin’ mother don't even like him.  You know what I'm talkin’ ‘bout.  Shit like…

[Verse 1 – Saigon]
In junior high, I knew a kid named John
One day John started thinkin’ he could rhyme
He used to see me battle with niggas one at a time
He figured he’d test his skills against mine
He came up to me one day and said, "Hey
Niggas saying you mean, lord.  Spit sixteen, god"
I said, "No pa, I'm good"
He said, "Well, I'mma spit some shit then.  You know, rep for my hood
Check it: we ride drops, we pop mad shots
We even got 20-inch rims on the yacht"
I told him to stop
The nigga ain't listen—he kept goin'
So I punch duke in his mouth while he was flowin'
He got up off the ground and said, "Why'd you hit me?"
"You a diduntdidunt.  Here's a shot to the kidney"
The Mike Tyson of the rap shit
I even got a speech impediment—"You fuckin' lil' bastards"
(“That's my word, man.  Any fuckin’ rapper man
I'll eat his fuckin’ children, man.  Bring him to me, man”)

[Hook – Saigon]
You a diduntdidunt—rappin 'bout ya gun and ya blunt
A diduntdidunt—to you, it ain't nothin’ to front
You a diduntdidunt—a pussy that always talk about pussy when the pussy prolly ain't had none in a month
You a diduntdidunt.  Man, I done been where you from
A diduntdidunt—you ain't come up in the slum
You a diduntdidunt—act like you want beef
I'll knock out ya teeth and you'll be literally bumpin’ ya gums, son

[Verse 2 – Saigon]
See, see back in the day, I knew a kid named Ray
He was kind of sweet, so niggas thought he was gay
Every day, little Ray would come around the way
And try to shoot hoops, but dudes wouldn't let him play
I remember it was like the third week of May
Ray came through just like any other day
But on this particular day, he had somethin’ to say
Said if he couldn't play then niggas’ll have to pay
Now me being the man that I am
Threw the ball at him and told a nigga to scram
He reached into the pocket of the jacket he was wearin'
Pulled out a jammy no bigger than his hand
He said, "Fuck you Sai!" then popped one in the sky
Just started to cry like, "Somebody gon' die"
I'm like, "Bitch, give me this gun, you fuckin' punk" (Put it down Ray)
Ray you ain't a thug, you a diduntdidunt

[Hook – Saigon]
You a diduntdidunt—rappin 'bout ya gun and ya blunt
A diduntdidunt—to you, it ain't nothin’ to front
You a diduntdidunt—a pussy that always talk about pussy when the pussy prolly ain't had none in a month
You a diduntdidunt.  Man, I done been where you from
A diduntdidunt—you ain't come up in the slum
You a diduntdidunt—act like you want beef
I'll knock out ya teeth and you'll be literally bumpin’ ya gums, son

[Bridge – Saigon]
I've been all over the U.S. of A
Out west with Ronson, down south with Shey (hey!)
And one thing I see everywhere that I be (is what?)
Is a diduntdidunt
I've been on the bottom, been on the top
Been in the club and been on the block
The one thing I see everywhere that I be (is what?)
Is a diduntdidunt

[Verse 3 – Saigon]
So if you a punk, then say you a punk
Type of nigga that get knocked out and say you was drunk
I don't play that, niggas stay beefin’ on ADAT
See them in the street, like Pat—they don't say jack (Sajak)
My name is Saigon—I dare a rapper to say that
I ain't gon’ run in the booth and get payback
I'mma catch you while you eatin’ lunch
Catch you with a sucker-punch (like umph)
Take that, fuckin' diduntdidunt

[Hook – Saigon]
You a diduntdidunt—rappin 'bout ya gun and ya blunt
A diduntdidunt—to you, it ain't nothin’ to front
You a diduntdidunt—a pussy that always talk about pussy when the pussy prolly ain't had none in a month
You a diduntdidunt.  Man, I done been where you from
A diduntdidunt—you ain't come up in the slum
You a diduntdidunt—act like you want beef
I'll knock out ya teeth and you'll be literally bumpin’ ya gums, son

[Outro – Saigon]
Don’t get the "Diduntdidunt" stamped on your forehead.  Allido, we here.  Yeah.  Don’t be like John or Ray.  If you like John or Ray, stay the fuck out my way, ya heard?  Saigon.  Brratt!  Nigga.  2010, bitch!
