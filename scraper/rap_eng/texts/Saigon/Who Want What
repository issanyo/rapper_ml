[Intro: Ras Kass]
Now where is the love?
JR & PH7 (Sai, Free)
And of course, it's the Waterproof

[Verse 1: Freeway]
My flow cannot compare to niggas
I’m a big black thick strong-bearded nigga
With my chip strong, and my tip toeing
To the top, ayo, be careful, nigga
But I’m on point, yeah, I’m on point, I, I got no choice
I’m a hood guy in a Rolls Royce
You bless me, caress me, you test me, you force me to
Divorce me and force me to pop off
From the block where the cops get knocked off
North Philly, my spot dog
You raised me, matter of fact, you made me
These other rap niggas fugazi
Don’t trust you, fuck you, dog, just pay me
Young free cooler than the AC
Catch me chilling with a baby
Philly niggas don’t play dog, we don't hate y'all
So spray y'all with that 47, we PH7 and JR, yeah

[Hook]
I'm better than y'all
So tell me who want what dog
Ain’t nobody screwing with me no more

[Verse 2: Saigon]
Is that face to fact for your face get crap
I chase the yack 'till I fade the black
They got signs, free laces, trap
DJ know it, better play this bet
I came in the game with the aim to change it
Everybody else still doing the same shit
But I show you what the difference is
Sso we all know the significance
What I address in my sentences
Is a testament to my relentlessness
Ain’t no love, so I don’t want your hug
The handshakes is fake, dripping all over your mug
That’s the reasons I’m not going to club
Nigga act up, yeah, I’m throwing the slug
Two time felon, two crime villain
Who the fuck is you if you don't mind tellin'
I say yeah, like the nigga in the hood
Nigga want in front in the kid, but is too shook to
Look you son of a bitch, I cook you
Deep down in the ground where I put you
Hold down let me ride the beat
At least that’s what they say when they see me in the street
They say Sai thank you for getting ready to weep
And thank JR for flipping the beat
Brace yourself, they say "we love you"
Of course we do, of course we do
And guess what, we love you all too
They say "we love you"
Rewind us to the beginning again
Even if I lost it, I'm winning in the end

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
My shit flowing like the diarrhea, fly MC, I am he
Hit his eyeballs Siamese spend life in it’s entirety
Checking the beanstalk, You all end up what the giant be
One last big mother fucker, you don’t really want me to climb that tree
Let’s shoot weapons without snitching, and see who dies quietly
Drink like a Russian, arrogant as a French, been acting violently
Green wallabies be that avocado kashmir
Now all I need is the land and a ring and a master right up here
Something like a hip hop, underground superhero
Walk out the booth, DeNiro, here, I scoop the yearo
Airport currency exchanged for a profit on a dollar
And keep your girl on her knees, I’m an arthroscopic scholar
Holler, hijos de puta have them leaking out their salsa
Vulcans lead to verdict, murder, I flip the wordplay
Academic annihilation appreciating invitation
All star alliteration for your Oscar consideration

[Hook]
