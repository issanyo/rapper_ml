Sometimes in life you gotta let go of certain things man
Everybody got their vice, but you know what though

Hook:
All these drugs and all these hoes
I just don't need it no more
I gotta let it go, go, I gotta let it go
And I don't love you no more
This ain't home and we can't grow
I gotta let it go, go, I gotta let it go
I gotta let it go

For the third time Brian, you need to get it together
Either you let it go, or you gonna live with it forever
God grant em serenity, so that he could accept the
Things that he can't change, depression is gonna infect them
Forget that chick she wasn't worth it in the first place
You knew that scenario was worse than the worst case
Look how fast you got to first base
All the times that she lied to you think about that look on her face
Hmm I'm not a Dr.Phil but I can still describe a pill
For love sickness cause I know a lie could feel
I lost my mother, my daughter started fucking with water
I went from one ninety solid to a buck and a quarter
But I'm a recuperate in a hurry
Cause I can stress when I'm buried in the cemetery
And that could be hey, when you never know
Sometimes you just gotta say fuck it and let it go

Hook:
All these drugs and all these hoes
I just don't need it no more
I gotta let it go, go, I gotta let it go
And I don't love you no more
This ain't home and we can't grow
I gotta let it go, go, I gotta let it go
I gotta let it go
Go go go oh oh oh oh oh oh oh..
I gotta let it go, just let it go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I gotta let it go

I know it's easier said than done
But you gotta let her run
Go out there and find yourself a better one son
Even if she look good to your eyesight
None of it really matters if she ain't got her mind right
So what if the face is the dime
If the bitch is just chasing some shine
She basically wasting your time
Lil T from Maryland was on heroin
I said was cause he copped a bad bag now we'll see him never again
Pauly got addicted to medicine
Never ate right would take flight late night like Letterman
But whenever he came home mama would let em in
He tryin to beat up the drug but he keep letting them win
Ross said the devil's at the door if you let him in
It get worse than it ever been he gon fill your head with sin
But if you lock him out, life'll get better though
Sometimes you gotta say fuck it and just let it go

[Hook]

The song is for those with the scrambling habits
The gambling addicts, the fans and fanatics in the land of dramatics
This is a real song, it won't make the radio
But if you hear it then share it somebody you know
This is a real song it won't make the radio
That's why I had to say fuck it and just let it go
That's why I had to say fuck it and just let it go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I gotta let it go, just let it go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I gotta let it go
