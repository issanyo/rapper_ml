[Hook: Saigon] (x2)
What's really, really crack?  What's really, really dope?
What's really, really sad is we don't really have hope
What's really, really hood?  What's really, really there?
Sad shit about it, nobody really, really cares

[Verse 1: Saigon]
They opened up another Chinese place as if we needed one
Like we can't get a hold of Chin-Wong
He in the hood with the egg foo young.  Kennedy Fried
Stay open ‘til five.  Look, guys, open your eyes
We can't survive when people come in our neighborhood and ride
While we fall like the towers hours after Bin Laden's surprise
Knowledge is magnemetized—niggas gonna to cling to the truth
Which is every word that I sing in the booth
I gotta watch the shit I bring to the youth
Rap is affecting the hood—my little cuz Nate slinging is proof
I used to listen to Onyx and think I had bionics
Dre made me say, “Fuck my book.  Where the fuck is my chronic?”
The funny shit is it's a white man that always behind it
He turn a [noggin-hit?] relation into his economics
And it's a promise ‘til I'm dead and gone (What?)
When that revolution come, I'mma be good and ready to get it on (Get it on!)

[Hook: Saigon] (x2)
What's really, really crack?  What's really, really dope?
What's really, really sad is we don't really have hope
What's really, really hood?  What's really, really there?
Sad shit about it, nobody really, really cares

[Verse 2: stic.man]
A lot of [busters?] be claiming that they military-minded
But real is not an image—it's the substance behind it
Pulling out your pistol in your own neighborhood, stunting
Endangering the babies on the block—that ain't about nothing
The OGs say the gangs used to be about something
The street life had honor and code; now, we just fronting
Is it rap that got us acting like that?
Or the conditions we live in that got us cornered and packed?
Up in the prisons, politicians running ‘round with these rappers like mascots
So they can hijack the have-not vote in the ballot box
Now I'm anti to Bush agenda but I remember
It was Bill Clinton that took welfare.  Do you remember?
What's really hood with these MC wars?  Inflated egos
Acting like some gossiping hoes—that shit is weak, yo
I focus on stacking this paper, setting the power
‘Cause if we ain't controlling the hood, then it ain't ours

[Hook: Saigon] (x2)
What's really, really crack?  What's really, really dope?
What's really, really sad is we don't really have hope
What's really, really hood?  What's really, really there?
Sad shit about it, nobody really, really cares
