[Verse 1-Saigon]
You ever get the feelin
No matter what they do, no matter what they say
You know you'll make it, someday

You know the feelin when your back is up against the wall
People say they love you but you ain't convinced at all
Tell 'em they full of shit and they tell you you're insecure
Callin you immature, does that make sense to y'all?
You ever feel like it's you against the whole world?
Like everybody is schemin, even your own girl
Your homeboy seem to be countin your money
Tell him you ain't got it and he lookin at you funny
I'm feelin like I probably need to either leave the game alone
Or either be the G to bang the chrome and get his name known
How does the Saigon story end; how?
Know what they sayin for now?

[Hook: Joe Budden]
They'll say I'm a killaaaaa (uhh)
I feel I'm as high as I can be
And y'all ain't gon' fly as high as me
I can't be no realaaaaa
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down, down (nah!)
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down, me down (never!)
Y'all ain't gon' bring me dowwwwwn (no!)
I can't be no realaaaaa
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down, down

[Verse 1-Saigon]
I'm too high but it's not from a drug
It's not from a drink, it's not from a night at the club
It's not from a broad, it's not what I copped from the dealer
I would tell ya, but if I tell ya then I gotta kill ya
I been around a lil' while but I'm kinda scared
It's ill, like a vet that's still wet behind the ear
Some niggas look hard, but I don't feel a threat behind the stares
I'm lookin for vic's and they could be volunteers
I dare somebody jump out the window to try to stop me
I wait for niggas to shoot 'em like I was a paparazzi
Manly stack, system knockin the Maserati
I jump out the back and turn your block into Nagasaki
I shouldn't have to always make an issue with the pistol
Just to prove the kid is official, tissue to the gristle
How does the Saigon story end; how?
Know what they sayin for now?

[Hook]

[Interlude: Joe Budden (Saigon)]
Killaaaaa (I'm too high but it's not from a drug)
I feel I'm as high as I can be (I'm high on life, love)
And y'all ain't gon' fly as high as me (I'm from above)
I can't be no realaaaaa
Y'all ain't gon' bring me dowwwn
Y'all ain't gon' bring me dowwwn (no)
Y'all ain't gon' bring me dowwwwwn (the invincible Saigon!)
I can't be no realaaaaa (one, two, three, go!)
