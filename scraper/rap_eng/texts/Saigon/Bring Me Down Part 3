Yea, y'all know what the verdict is merciless verbalist
Spitting murderous verses with no preservatives
I’m glad I could be of some service to you suckers
Cause lately I’ve been born to murder you motherfuckers
In all respect I’m like a tyrannosaurus rex
The meanest one of them all that don't get along with the rest
But now that me and homie done put our differences to rest
Y'all bout to witness 2 of the sickest spitters in the flesh
On features I'm a hella of a guest why would you ever just settle for less
It's food for thought pace yourself my album had to delicatess
Leader of the now school I guess I'm the LONS
Your not at my level I'm hot as the devil
And yes niggas is hella impressed "I’m impressed"
I’m like aggravating a bull only thing could bring me down is gravitational pull
How does the Saigon story end Y'all'll find out soon as the chorus begins

[Hook]
They say I’m a killer, I feel I'm as high as I can be
And y'all ain't gon' die as high as me
I can't be no realer
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
I can't be no realer
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down

Wanna talk about how I gain is not measurable
I come from a place where the pain became pleasurable
Me and success is inseparable
I put it all on the table so it falling is inevitable
I won’t fold for you niggas
My rock bottom like a goal for you niggas
I gave em jewels, but it was more like coal to you niggas
So nah I ain’t the same as your man
Let’s talk when you get a link on that chain of command
You got a sideline view so what I’m doing don’t appear to be hard
You drag racing against the rear of the car
Pumping your breaks fish tailing make it difficult to hear these bars
Nigga your skin couldn’t bare these scars
Getting beside yourself, niggas thinking they the best
Digging your own grave playing Jenga with tourettes
Out-matched, out-classed there’s nathing you can teach me
In order to bring me down gotta be able to reach me

[Hook]
They say I’m a killer, I feel I'm as high as I can be
And y'all ain't gon' die as high as me
I can't be no realer
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
I can't be no realer
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down

(Nh, Neva!)
