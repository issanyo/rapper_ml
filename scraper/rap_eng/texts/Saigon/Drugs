How is it they can win a war against terror when
In the ghetto we losing a war against heroin
If you don't believe me look at some of those war veterans
Fought for this country and still can't afford medicine
President Nixon declared a war on drugs
In retrospect it was more like a war on us
The drug enforcement agents are given an occupation
Of making sure they inflating the prison population
Since 85% of it is Black and Hispanic
It's safe to say it might be a result of the crack epidemic isn't it
I think it is ____
And I can give examples of just how big that it is
Today it's easier to get blow than 40 years ago
If there's a war on drugs then were did it go
They found 2 terrorists all in a row
But can't find who's sneaking drugs past the border patrol
Do you expect me to believe this yo
I mean the masses might do but me .. no
You see some call it genocide, some call it hatred
I just call it something that everyone should relate with

Let's keep real
Sometimes the sun don't shine
Let's keep it real
Sometime a poem don't rhyme
Let's keep it real
Its like we living in a time we can't even make up our own mind
Let's keep it real
Unless a change gon come
Let's keep it real
It'll be the same ol song
Let's keep it real
If there's a war on drugs
We don't win til there ain't no more

With Rockefeller lost knocked a lot of fellas off
Trying to get a slice bread mozzarella sauce
I know none that won but hell that lost
That old drug came with a hell of a cost
You ever stop to think where is the source
Like where are they turning this cocoa leaf into something you can snort
How the hell is it coming to New York and every ghetto in America
Who's this letting this new war
I mean you would of think with all this counterintelligence
They'd be smarter in hiding this mountain of evidence
But they ain't got not even one intention of stopping it
Half of it is politics half is somebody profiting
The war on drugs is really the opposite
Should be called drugs on war
Because somebody getting they pockets hit
So that coke on my street and that weed on your street
Is only there cause they eat off it on wall street

[Hook]

I'm clearly a lyricist not a conspiracy theorist
I just need motherfuckers to hear this
I'm clearly a lyricist not a conspiracy theorist
I just need motherfuckers to hear this
Yes, see to go to war on something is to combat something
And yo I don't see no combat or fight on drugs against America

[Hook]
