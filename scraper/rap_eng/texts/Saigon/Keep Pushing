[Hook: Chamillionaire]
‘Cause I’ve been up and I’ve been down
And if it’s one thing that I’ve found
You gotta keep pushing baby
I swear it feels like we almost made it
We on the way up, yeah, don’t look down
‘Cause we so high off the ground
But you gotta keep pushing baby
To the top, yeah, we almost made it

[Verse 1: Saigon]
I relate more to struggle than to corks and the bubbles
Your pain’s never champagne when you always in trouble
I’m at the dealership but I’m selling these cars
It’s a result of collecting my second felony charge
Watching fellows get lost, spitting bullshit bars
It’s like a mirage—niggas only write for the broads
As far as I could recall, there was only one tar
One teacher, one king, one God, it seem all
Rookies, they don’t respect the sport
Like they totally forgot Kane's second thought—
They don’t seem to reflect no more
That’s why they coming out sounding so similar
It’s quite confusing for you remember the
Originator.  Boy, do I hate ‘em—fuck a perpetrator
Hater, record label slave trader
My story the recipe of a grown man
Had to go put my destiny in my own hands

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Saigon]
I ain’t emerged to tell you how I splurge on the birds
I don’t give 'emnothing but word and still hit the curves
Then swerve to another nerve—murder superb
They heard of Giddy like they heard of the word
33 and a third of what I spit—this verbally is absurd
Never 33 and a third.  It’s addictive as herb, you heard?
Come try and punk a nigga
I run you over, hit your head with the bumper sticker
It's gon' take a month to fix you
I'm being sincere when I say that you’ll be in intensive care
I don’t think you really wanna visit there
Flow water, words float like a motor boat
Been there and done it, dummy; I know the ropes—quote, unquote
Front on me, I go for broke.  Smoke with me, it’s tote for tote
Joke with me, I’m funny as Kevin Hart making Oprah jokes
Oops I told joke twice, but that’s aight
These motherfuckers know that I’m nice

[Hook]
