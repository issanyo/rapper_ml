[Verse 1]
Likkle Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
You better get in there and get that DOUGH
All over the world, god, it's kids that KNOW
You remember in South click we did that SHOW
Only had one mic but ripped that THOUGH
Only had one fight and flipped that MO
Lucky for him we didn't get gats THOUGH
Cuz word to my moms I woulda shit bagged BRO

Likkle Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
You ill when you rhyme simple as tic tac TOE
You know why I'm rhymin' as simple as tic tac TOE?
Cuz niggas is dumb and that's the shit that BLOW

Likkle Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
Half on the quart, yeah nigga that's WHOA

[Verse 2]
My team will come through; pop you in the head
Them sixteens shot you now you up again
You act like you can't get hit with hot lead
I pop you in your cornrows; pop 'em in the dreads
Even niggas with waves could get some of this
SEEN
Come again; got niggas in the State Pen; niggas in the fed
Got niggas only hatin' cuz I'm getting' bread
And now I got to chase them with the infrared
SEEN
Come again; somebody gon' leave this party dead
Some boy gon' get shot and knocked in the leg
I hit him with the head shot to rock him to bed
Trey pound popped him, shot him then I fled
SEEN
Come again
