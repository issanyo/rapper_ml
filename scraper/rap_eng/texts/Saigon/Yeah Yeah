OK Shu, what's up?
Yeah, yeah
Your boy Saigon I'm in here, yeah, yeah!
Y'all ready?

[Hook]
Y'all niggas want it, y'all niggas get it
Hospital bed, nigga get admitted
My niggas got it, y'all niggas want it
Put a knife in your shirt, hurt don't it!
Now, this the hottest beat of the year
Say yeah, yeah (yeah yeah) ready to start wilding in here
Say yeah, yeah (yeah yeah) rocking with Saigon this year
Say yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)

[Verse 1]
Why y'all wanna make me get back on my bulljive?
Even though I hang with the gang of those good guys
We don't fear no man, play like you Conan
I'mma have your whole fam saying their goodbyes
I might be the wrong one to try to intimidate
It's some shooting that's going on, I'ma participate
It's some looting that's going on, I'ma participate
Cause I'm tired of seeing the designs on the dinner plate!
Need some food on it, lasagna and a steak
So I'ma move on it, piranhas infiltrate
Your field like the Navy Seals
The real Shadyville, we the ones crazy real
That ain't just the way we feel
These are facts and you can even ask
Or you could check the hood credit scores, Streetquifax
Yeah, this is what I suggest
If you the truth, nigga, take a lie detector test
Yes

[Hook]
You niggas want it, you niggas get it
Hospital bed, nigga get admitted
My niggas got it, you niggas want it
Put a knife in your shirt, hurt don't it!
Now, this the hottest beat of the year
Say yeah, yeah (yeah yeah) ready to start wilding in here
Say yeah, yeah (yeah yeah) rocking with Saigon this year
Say yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm insightful, like I read ten Bibles
My wheel turn faster than the fucking spin cycle
And I ain't seen an encyclopedia since high school
That's around the time I start fucking with them rifles
Talking the assault kind, busting, disgusting
Just like a pork rind, you was a motherfucker that fought crime
Now they gave you a microphone and some talk time
You turned into a porcupine, you ain't never walked the line
Never walked the yard, you just talking hard
You go to hell, you said them rhymes and swore to God
You a fraud and a fraud in the presence of the law
To my dogs is starting to look like a smorgasbord
I don't idolize, I'm cooler than Charles In Charge
Smooth as a Ahmad Rashad, your music is yada ya
A lot of blah, banging drums and a hard guitar
Your content is nonsense, garbage

[Hook]
You niggas want it, you niggas get it
Hospital bed, nigga get admitted
My niggas got it, you niggas want it
Put a knife in your shirt, hurt don't it!
Now, this the hottest beat of the year
Say yeah, yeah (yeah yeah) ready to start wilding in here
Say yeah, yeah (yeah yeah) rocking with Saigon this year
Say yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
