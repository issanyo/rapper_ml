[Intro - Saigon]
Aye yo yo yo yo yo, there go that brother Bryonn Bain man
I heard he speak knowledge, talk to 'em

[Verse - Bryonn Bain]
I was reincarnated to be incarcerated
In this cage called flesh
Released on probation only through meditation
But meditation was a morse code
Waiting for man on the other side of the tracks
[?] with committing heresy against himself
And I was by myself in the womb
Like I was by myself in my tomb
I died free, cause I couldn't live life a slave
Now I'm back from the grave
In a rage to get mine, cause I be divine, say what?
Said I be divine, not just some ebonic line
Check my EKG sign, you'll see a circle not a line
Cause I transcend space and time
I transcend space, and send space
And set space back in time
