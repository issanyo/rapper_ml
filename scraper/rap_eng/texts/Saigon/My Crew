[Intro]
Ayo Statik we gon' switch it up on 'em man
We're talking about my crew on this one man


[1st Verse]
See my crew be doing it like this
Every nigga in the crew stay with a tight fist
Ready to bust you up side yo motherfucking head
If you ever act like you wanna fight bitch
Crew be doing it like this
Ooh let me see that thing you got on your right wrist
Yeah this is nice kid where'd you buy this, click
Slip that shit off in the process
See my crew be doing it like this
Up north in the yard swinging a icepick
Down south on the tour bangin a white chick
I ain't even dropped and they on my dick cause i'm that shit
And be doing it like this
Crack in the back of my balls in the crack of my walls
Can't let police go in my drawers
I got two felonies a nigga can't afford anymore
Naw

[Chorus: Sample]
"Am I getting through to you"

[Saigon during Chorus]
Am I getting through to you
You know how the crew do nigga
YEAH! Statik Selektah man
Saigon, come on (Am I)
Am I get through to you
Is this computable?
Check it
You wanna know about my crew?

[2nd Verse]
See my crew be doing it like this
Righteous megaman that's my sidekick for life bitch
And we tighter than vicegrips
So if you got beef with him then I flip
And be doing it like this
Up north in my cell stepping in my shit
Down south on the L selling that white shit
See my nigga TT and get that right call it a night shit
And start moving it like this
Start selling all my shit to the white kids
Give the crack to Mikey bet he likes it
Every since then son keep his pipe lit, shit
And be doing it like this and like that
We'll ruin this hype shit with tight rap
And start doing what we need to be doing
To get this rap shit back on the right track
Blah

[Chorus: Sample]

[Statik scratches] 2x
"I'm surrounded by criminals"
"Got with a sick type clique and went all out"
