[Verse 1]
Likkle Saigon what are you doing back here?
They said that you were supposed to retire last year
Tell em don't believe everything that you hear
2012 things finna get clear
Them talk like a batty boy, must be a queer
Go upside his head with the Heineken beer
I reinvent myself, why you think I'm still here?
Seen...me never care
It's getting so obvious you people can't hear
If so, my audience'll be up near there
The Shawns, the Marshalls, the boy Nasir
The little d boy still with the long hair
The light skinned kid they gave rookie of the year
Seen...me never care
Likkle Saigon, you're gonna kill your career
OJ da Juiceman, I tell him hell yeah
My cousins in the south dig that right there
They say, you and shorty did that right there
Don't play it up here, see if I care
Seen...me never care

Nah (me never care)
You think I give a fuck now nigga (me never care)
I just lost my mama man (me never care)
I ain't got nothing to lose man (me never care)
I blow your motherfucking head off nigga (me never care)
Fuck with me now nigga (me never care)
Say my name now bitch (me never care)
I'm on a rampage nigga, brrrrat

I could rap true blue, I could rap red
Cause I'm one of the few dudes that really popped lead
Free Tru Life, ya heard what I said
Nigga violate, we murder the guy dead
It's boom bye bye in a batty boy head
Seen...come again
Some niggas found guilty, some niggas plead
Why would you go to trial if you ain't got that bread?
Cause look at ya now, you're doing life in the fed
You won't be the last brown they turn to a egg
That's short for example, in case y'all wondering
Seen...come again
And fuck my pops, that motherfucker ain't shit
Same to the cops, y'all make too many arrests
The prisons is packed, and why y'all still make beds?
Y'all make them beds to lay the black man head

Motherfucker (come again)
It's the good guy gang (come again)
I told you man (come again)
Abandoned nation (come again)
Seen (come again)
We not going nowhere (come again)
(Come again)
We here nigga, drop that
Two thousand two hundred nigga
Sing to em
