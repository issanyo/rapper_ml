[Hook] x2
You never was a killa; you never bust a gun
You never held the spot down; was never on the run
You never lived my life; you dead in the wrong
Cause you never did none of the shit that you said in your song

[Verse 2]
With the strength of a hundred baboons
I'll beat your eyes black as a fuckin' raccoon's
Leave you covered with stab wounds
Dead in a public bathroom
You like to tighten your face and cuss when you spit
Know what I noticed? That tough shit is just when you spit
I couldn't picture you bustin' a clip
I could see you suckin' a dick or probably getting fucked with a stick
Drama with me, son, your baby mama will be
Found in the woods, hangin' by her thong from a tree
You spit my life and won an award
But you can't get my stripes cause you the type to run in a war
Slung jums in front of the store; done it before
Held guns, I'm talkin' at least a hundred or more
Should put a gun to your jaw, to one of your whores
Fuck under the covers; we all lovers under the floor

[Hook]

Word is bond, word is bond
Abandoned Nation, we up in this bitch, nahmean, 2k
Niggas is outta jail, niggas is coming for niggas heads nahmean
All these fake ass MCs advocating real niggas lives and shit
Like it's some sweet sheet, nahmean?
Shit is, shit is, shit is aggravating god, word up man
Big up my nigga Shyne son, word up, hold your head man
I'ma make sure niggas take care of you up north son

You never was a killa, you never bust a gun
You never held the spot down, was never on the run
So why you wanna live fucked up like us?
If they convict J and Puff, good luck on Rikers
