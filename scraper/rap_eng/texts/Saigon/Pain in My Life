[Intro: Saigon]
Pain in my life, yeah, check it

[Verse 1: Saigon]
Young Felicia was only four when she learned how to ride a bike
Now she fourteen ridin' every Tom, Dick, and Mike
I tell her, "That ain't nice, why you livin' so trife?"
She said please, "MYOB, homie, you don't know me"
It's so much pain in my life, her sister the same
Felicia claims she the one that hipped her to the game
She fucked Jermaine 'cause Jermaine had a shiny chain
Now when she pee on the potty, she feel a minor pain
And she noticin' her vagina changin' and not for the better
She see bumps and all kinds of things
The doctor suggested for her take a HIV test, she said, "Yes"
Now it's peace in which she waitin' to rest, she so stressed
So much pain in my life and so say the bum on the corner
When I ask him why he bummin' for quarters
Was it him, or was it government order, said he thirsty
I offered him water, but he said he want somethin' stronger
He said it's pain my life
And he need a lil somethin' to numb it
Somethin' that's gon' burn a hole in his stomach
First I said naw, but then after talkin' to him, it was clear
That his wife was his life and dope had murdered the woman
So much pain in my life, that bum used rum to keep his feelings numb
Felicia was out there killin' em
Her a fatherless daughter, him a daughterless father
She a nymphomaniac, he got his thoughts in the bottle
Would it help for them to walk with a Bible?
They both say, nah they find religion awkward as I do
I could holla, give a dollar but what more could I do?
Not much, they got fucked, it's what we call survival

[Hook: Trey Songz]
So much pain in my life, if there was pain up heaven
Wouldn't the rain leave bloodstains down here
'Cause down here, not much changed in the game
'Cause everybody wanna thug, man
So much pain in my life, if you knew the pain I sustained
Just from lettin' my gun bang, yeah
You would pump your breaks young man
You would jump in the other lane

[Vesre 2: Saigon]
So much pain in my life, I know how it feel
I been in jail where none of my niggas keepin' it real
No dough, no mail, it was, "Yo, go to hell"
Now they jell 'cause I'm hangin' out with Coco Chanel
And even though I got pain in my life, I keep it discreet
I got a deal, still sleep in the street
Y'all hustle to get the keys to a jeep 'til the judge
Throw the book at you fucker, tell you to read it and weep
So much pain in my life and let me not forget about Leonard
The preacher been feelin' on Leonard for a minute
Told him that if he told, his soul would be demented
And even if he made it to the gate, he wouldn't get in it
It's pain in my life, y'all niggas use pain for a gimmick
But Leonard pain got pushed to the limit
Found him layin' on a sofa one night, his throat sliced
With a suicide note and a knife, yo what he write?
So much pain in my life and he's no longer wantin' to live it
Breathin' is no longer important, forget it
What he didn't write is he was molested since he was five
And would rather die before he was forced to admit it
He said it's pain in my life, this pain niggas feel everyday
My middle finger wave hi to the critics
If y'all didn't get it, then what? Then maybe I should just stay away
Let my man Trey Songz and them hit it

[Hook: Trey Songz]
So much pain in my life, if there was pain up heaven
Wouldn't the rain leave bloodstains down here
'Cause down here, not much changed in the game
'Cause everybody wanna thug, man
So much pain in my life, if you knew the pain I sustained
Just from lettin' my gun bang, yeah
You would pump your breaks young man
You would jump in the other lane
So much pain in my life, if there was pain up heaven
Wouldn't the rain leave bloodstains down here
'Cause down here, not much changed in the game
'Cause everybody wanna thug, man
So much pain in my life, if you knew the pain I sustained
Just from lettin' my gun bang, yeah
You would pump your breaks young man
You would jump in the other lane
