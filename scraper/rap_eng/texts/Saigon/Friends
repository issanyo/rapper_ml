[Verse 1- Saigon]
Something like a buddy, didn’t really love me
You made my lifestyle ugly, man, you wasn’t my friend
I trusted and believed in you man, I ignored all the people who said:
“Watch out for your friends"
I used to try to watch for the cops but my pops said:
“Brian you should stop, you should watch for your friends”
I wish I would’ve listened to him, He said:
“Friends, sometimes they’ll try and make you sin”
You made me not only sin
You made my temper shorter than Napoleon
Would shoot whenever you told me when
Met you when I was only ten, now it’s only been
Two and a half years since I left you
And i'm lonely and uh
I ain't gon lie, sometimes when I’m alone
I want to pick up the phone like, what up, holmes
Instead, I go in the zone and spit poems in the microphone
Fucking with you is something to do, but I'd be calling Riker’s home
You insisted on making me sin
You ain’t love me, you was making pretend
You wasn’t my friend
My auntie, my uncle and them
They used to tell me again and again:
“Watch out for your friends”
My momma couldn’t never comprehend
Said, “You won’t even do it for me, but you’ll do it for your friends”
Wish I would have listened to them
They said: “Friends, sometimes they’ll try to make you sin”
You ain’t no friend of mine
You a waste of my time
