[Intro: Woman and Chamillionaire]
Cause each and every day that you stay away
Breaks my achin' heart in two
And it's causing to pray oh baby

Uhh, let me talk to my congregation
They tell me the money talk so let's get some communication
It took forever but you've been patient
The negative liars tryin' to hinder the reputation
Just know your troubles won't be forsaken
They tell me the money talks so just pay me with conversation
Everything has a price if you don't know what you'd pay for your life
Know what you pay for your life, you gonna learn tonight

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
This is where you learn how to win
The congregation is here, let the conversation begin (Amen)
Turn your scriptures to page ten
Cause loyalty is everything and flip floppin' should be a sin (Amen)
Pass the offer and play the game
If you supportin' the movement then prove it by what you spend
Everything has a price if you ain't learned anything in your life
Just do whatever you like, you gonna learn tonight

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Tell em you sippin' purple while smoking and getting faded
Lying ain't really lying the rappers is entertainment
When you get imitated that's when you know that you made it
Rappers go after women that every rapper done dated
Open the candy gates so she told me she Atheist
This vehicle heavenly I just hope that you make the list
There isn't a man alive that can say he created this
Keep going until your pockets and dropping cremated chips
Give me your dead prezzies I'mma roll with the dezzie
Eagle that's just so people who evil know I’m ready
Pretty women who schemin' and (???) me at the telly
That's easy as tryna take off a condom with a machete
My congregation is heavy, conversation is skill
Put money inside the plate that I'm offering til it spill
Blasphemy if you actually got gangsta after a deal
The book of Bernard Friedman say 'thou is not trill'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Saigon]
I've been knowing for attacking the preacher who doesn't practice what he preach
Slapping the rapper to keep inaccuracies in his speech
Say he packin' when he reach, it ain't for nothing but for the jack that calls his peeps, that only back him cause he’s sweet
Yappin bout a rap sheet, when he ain't' even got one
This nigga was an athlete, never touched a shot gun
Hurt cause he’s too fake, worst than the two fate
Tough when he be on TV, but in person’s a fruitcake
Our Father who art in heaven hollow be Thy name
That’s what he gonna scream if some hollows hit his frame
But he ain’t to blame he gonna be in a lot of pain
Difference between rappers and gangsta’s it’s not the same
Yet I vow my style is holier than thou
We good God gangbangers, we hold each other down
You, you a bitch, you can probably do a full split
So come off of the pulpit with that bullshit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Where do you go when you see the road in the forks split
Hope it's some soldiers you're walking into that door with
Lucky to people that always thought I would forfeit
Have me as twisted as disputed I open corpse with
Off course it’s the switching, off course it’s in my vision
Thought I would shooting blanks, but I pop a clip and now listen
Devils just keep on coming they masters of repetition
Try to kill off my spirit, no time for a exorcism
All of this Ammunition, time for a revelation
Always was trigger-happy, I never had hesitation
They ain't upon my level, me and them ain't adjacent
I'm the original and they just some interpolations
Livin' inside a world that we know is unfair
Rewind to the times when my mother told me that notice was there
Then she told me don’t just be ready, be over-prepared
And always keep God first, well you bout to owe 'm a prayer
You almost there

[Hook]
