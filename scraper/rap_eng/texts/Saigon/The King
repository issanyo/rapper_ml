[Hook]
Whose the king, whose the king
Huh?
Im the king, im the king
Yeah!

[Verse]
I been sick since that song c clip silly blew me off
Now hes steadily failing while i grow fast like mozeltoff
I point and scoff at you rapping maggots
Who giving bad criticism to give it, but make no smash hits
I battled the dragons, murdered the vexes
You are just preaching the bible to reverends
Claiming your teaching but lacking a reference
All of you leeches got heads that im Severing
7-11, 666 hundred of you are duplicates
Enter the minds of koo-koo kids
In grade 5 they called me kibbs
Now i rock Odysseus, oblivious, this rap game is my odyssey
I know im great, they mocking me
Man you gon break like honestly
Ill make you wait on stopping me but
Let me take a minute to sit here and address my views
Know i watch my own stuff like its the news
Man you must be high on crack, think you can fill my shoes?
Yo all these rappers wack, they play the game like noobs boi
