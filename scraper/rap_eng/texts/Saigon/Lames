Yea
Shout out to Scram Jones!!!
Clinton Sparks in the building
IT'S SMASH TIME!

[Verse 1]
It's nothin for me to roll wit twelve fire arms
The kid got more beef than Hillshire Farms
But I ain't gon turn my shit into sausage
I'm gonna turn my beef into some coffins
Flow so sick I'm nauseous
I ain't signed yet, cause labels makin me BS often
I don't care, it's all they losses, the price only gon go up
Nigga im gonna blow up, American Music Awards, yea I'm gon show up
When I win one of them, I'm gon throw up
Yup, right on whoever's in front of me
Came from the P, ain't nobody in this bitch that can front on me
Ain't nobody sonnin me, I'm under my own wing
A.B. nigga, yea I'm runnin' my own thing
Smile everytime the phone ring, cause I know it's money on the other end
Not my homie lover friend
Gotti bring the shovel in
I'm buryin' these niggas careers
To me it appears they all queer
They what we call pimps, we need more squares
Who wanna holla back? In fact I'm all ears

[Hook]
These lames (these lames)
They fuckin' up the game
(Niggas fuckin' up the game, said these lames fuckin' up the game)
It's a shame the way that things change
{Repeat}

[Verse 2]
Whatever you wanna know about Saigon
Go to what type of thug are you w.com
Been through the fire like Chaka Khan
Seen all of the stop signs but to me them jokers was just octagons
Couldn't tell me I was not the bomb
And the nigga couldn't fight but I was quick to cock a nine
Never quick to drop a dime
Even though niggas dropped dimes on me bout fifty-eleven times
Primetime, this is a fine time to rhyme
Im feelin like a million, word to my mom
Im glad all of yall niggas chasin' a dame
I'll DMX the game wit no sets to claim
No dog on my back wit jail bars on my arm
War scars on my heart from gettin' it on
Coxsackie nigga, they back me nigga
They feelin my tracks in Clinton max
I fuck around and go platinum off jail niggas alone
What up Nap-Nap how y'all love that?

[Hook]
