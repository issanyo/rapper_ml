So this how we putting it down, huh
Alright, alright

She more than a friend, less than a lover
Why do I always question if I’m destined to fuck her
She talk about her man, I don’t wanna hear it
I listen even know I really feel like interfering
She something like a sister, but sort of a sense
Half-Haitian like me, papa from Port-au-Prince
Lately the conversation be more intense
I look her deep in the eye when she speaks so she more convinced
That I’m really caring bout what I’m hearing
When in reality, I’m just staring
Cause lil mama bad you heard me
If I fuck her, I’ma do it dirty, nah, I don’t think you heard me
Me and mama got a lot of commonality
I don’t wanna introduce her to abnormality
And if we ever did it, then I’d fuck it up
So I guess I’m just gonna have to suck it up

We got a relafriendship
See Shawty hit the scene, do her thing
Nah, but I ain’t trip
I am in a realfriendship
Lot of time wanna pull her to the side
Nah, but I don’t slip
We got a relafriendship
Shit I knew her 5 years, we ain’t never even kiss on the lips
I’m in a relafriendship, it’s a relafriendship
A relafreindship, a relafriendship

She told me I could crush her, I introduced her to Usher
Jay Z, Beyonce, Blue Ivy and whata..
Michelle Obama, Janet Jackson and what’s her name
You know the dame who sang the song about the busters
Always making me laugh, with that fat old ass
I wanna smash, but I had to pass
Told you last paragraph, I don’t see nothing good coming out of that aftermath
I remain neutral, keep it a half to half
Cause we got a relafriendship
It’s something I breathe, you just embrace this shit
Being friendly with benefits’ a basic script
These here’s deeper, it’s a relafriendship
We could hold hands, but I won’t tickle your palms
Kick it with your old man or go and pick up your mom
Think the shit is da bomb, what we have is so great
Oh wait, start to think you my soul mate

I’m in a relafriendship, it’s a relafriendship
A relafreindship, a relafriendship

I be lying, if I ever said it never crossed my mind
I’ve been trying, consider what I’m feeling for you deep inside
But baby you the best, and our situation kinda making me depressed
Cause I’m curious of how your body looks without the dress
I hate to loose a friend over ass, it’s just sex (just sex)
But damn girl, I wonder what it’s like to be your man, girl
But I have to settle for, being friends
It’s just better in the end
To have you and to keep you than to love and hurt and leave you
(That's not feasible)
