[Intro]
"This shit is hot.  Who is it?"
"No clue"
"Sounds like Eminem to me"
"What you know about hip hop, Drama?"
"What are you crazy, bro?  I'm OG"
"OG?  The last hip hop CD you bought was the kid who played box set"
“So who is it, then?”
“I never heard it before”
“Yeah, me neither”
“Since when does E listen to rap music?”
“Saigon”

[Verse 1: Saigon]
Y’all can try to [bear up?] in the sagas a war survivor tell
You might as well.  I’m out of jail—shit is ‘bout to get hot as hell (“Fire it!  I double-dare you!”)
His last word before volunteering his chest for the 30-inch slug to tear through
No, I don’t confuse you.  I tell the whole truth unlike the news’ll do
Listen ‘cause shit is sort of unusual
Living Markie, man Mike living 422 and [?]
Shorty that talk a lot of shit but can’t fight
[He hit him and his many B with?] chilling like after smoking twenty-three nicks
Guzzling vodka with Hennessey mixed
Reminiscing of penitentiary tricks, enemy hits
Getting chased out the Bronx, fucking with some Trinity chicks
Somehow, the conversation switched to hip hop
All Mike was saying was some shit ‘bout how we miss Pac
And how all these rappers that’s out now is riding his cock
And if Makaveli was here, he would have this shit locked

[Hook: Saigon]
Anybody could get it—so watch what you say out your mouth
‘Cause you could catch it on the way out your house
Anybody could get it—nigga, you could be hugging your bed
And get hit with a slug in your head
Anybody could get it—white, black, old, young
The lead in this gun ain’t prejudice, son
Anybody could get it—so watch what you say and watch what you do
‘Cause, duke, it could happen to you too

[Verse 2: Saigon]
Now Markie was like, “You wiling, son.  [?] niggas [?] crazier
That’s like comparing Penny Hardaway to McGrady or
Nike Air to a Avia.  Regular soldier to them ones in Saudi Arabia
You got to be crazy, bruh
All that shit was cool then, but now is now
That ‘save the world’ shit been went out of style”
Wow.  That must’ve made Mike mad
‘Cause he had the look on his face like he was so ready to break bad
He said, “Aight.  Then tell me who can fuck with Saigon
Nobody—and that’s some shit I’m down to bet my life on
I got a cousin in the pen—daddy ain’t even met
[Corrode?] his label and they sent them commissary in sweats
Far as real, that’s as real as it gets
And that’s the reason he the rookie that collect more respect than the vets”
But Markie said, “Fuck Saigon!  That nigga suck too!”
Mike took it there and said, “Suck my dick!  Fuck you!”

[Hook: Saigon]
Anybody could get it—so watch what you say out your mouth
‘Cause you could catch it on the way out your house
Anybody could get it—nigga, you could be hugging your bed
And get hit with a slug in your head
Anybody could get it—white, black, old, young
The lead in this gun ain’t prejudice, son
Anybody could get it—so watch what you say and watch what you do
‘Cause, duke, it could happen to you too

[Verse 3: Saigon]
Now they in a fighting position.  Markie threw a right with precision
Hit his eye—he had to fight for his vision
He ran back to the crib to get a knife from the kitchen
Thought about gutting this nigga like them lifers in prison
Second thought, he didn’t like the decision
“Nigga tried to play me out.  ‘Bout to take away the life that he’s living”
Thought about the .38 near the dirty plate in the cabinet
Ran through the crib heated and proceeded to grabbing it
Came back out.  Markie was still on the bitch
Seen Mike coming towards him and he ain’t even flinch
Said, “Nigga, if you got a weapon, then you better use it
Don’t get little ass hurt ‘cause you loving Saigon music”
But he was prepared to.  Said, “I ain’t tryna hear you”
Pointed the gun at him.  Markie said, “Fire it.  I double-dare you
Double-dare you shoot me, mutha…  Nigga, I take your...”
(*Gunshots*)  Oh shit.  Hold it, nigga

[Hook: Saigon]
Anybody could get it—so watch what you say out your mouth
‘Cause you could catch it on the way out your house
Anybody could get it—nigga, you could be hugging your bed
And get hit with a slug in your head
Anybody could get it—white, black, old, young
The lead in this gun ain’t prejudice, son
Anybody could get it—so watch what you say and watch what you do
‘Cause, duke, it could happen to you too
