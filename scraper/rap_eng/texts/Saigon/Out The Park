[Verse One]
We seen Suge still thug in the game
2Pac shoot a cop, beat the rap now we lovin' his name
Seen Pun spit fat like his stomach
Him and Joe packin' a Mac in the back of the black 600
We crowned Rakim the king
Cause he was callin' us 'Gods' and 'Earths', then niggas came with the bling bling
It was a very sad thing
I seen an eight year old with cubic zirconia's in his ring
Callin' some little girls "bitches"
By the look on they faces, it made that little simple word sound vicious
I told shorty "apologize"
When he said "why?"
The little girl with the braids she had started to cry
I said, "When you grow up, what you gon' be?"
He said, "A Pimp like C"
What happened to Trapper John MD?
Y'all fuckin' with the wrong MC
I'm on a song with MJB cause none of y'all stronger than me

[Hook]
I love hip hop
Set out in the park
We used to do it out in the dark
Any place that said my name, it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as little Saigon
I love hip hop
Set out in the dark
We used to do it out in the park
Every place that said my name, it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as little Saigon

[Verse Two]
I said I did it again
Came with a new way to spit it again
And shit it again
Lyrically you can not compare a nigga to them
I was on another level since The Roc was a pebble
Back when the Aftermath was just an argument
Since Das EFX/Def squiggidy squashed shit
I was hot when you wasn't
I was hot when Slick Rock shot his cousin
Before the fake thuggin'
Back when niggas was still eatin' that other meat
Back when Kid N Play was kickin' each other feet
I was a snotty nosed kid runnin' the street
Just kickin' my little raps with my son on the beat
Like {beat boxing}
I used to rap with no track, just a couple of that
In the huh, something turned me into a thug
And to this day, I don't know what it was
