[Intro: Marsha Ambrosius]
I will change the game, one day
Change the game, one day

[Verse 1: Saigon]
I got signed to Atlantic Records, 2004
They predicted I do a million right outta the door
They said all I had to do was just follow the for-
-mula you does, and you gon' be popular boy
See, what they fail to realize is I rhyme for the cause
And got the same mind frame as Assata Shakur
Told me they needed a single, who should they call?
I said, "y'all should put me in the stu' with Trey Songz"
Now all along they thinkin' we do a song how we bang the girls
I said, "nah lil' nigga, we 'bout to change the world"
And when I turned it in, expecting a grin
They gave a nigga this look like, never again
And I looked back at them like never again
I love all of you motherfuckers but, just as some friends
I can't do music if it ain't got a message within
I guess y'all can leave that up to the rest of them men
I'm changing the game

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I day dream about money and fame
I will change the game
One day (it's just a silly game)
When everybody knows my name
I will change the game
One day (change the game, change the game)

[Verse 2: Saigon]
Okay so now I got the Bentley dropped
But on the left side of my chest is an empty spot
I can't lie, these little groupies they tempt me a lot
But for me to fall victim, I simply could not
Nah nah, I don't brag about the bottles I pop
A lot of y'all are runnin' around here with the models I mop
5 years ago when Entourage was shot to the top
Suprised she still skinny, shorty swallows a lot
Ha ha! and ever so often
Somebody comes around and delivers great songs without flossin'
Without talkin', bout shit that isn't important
Like makin' a fortune off of somebody snortin'
Or bein' the forces that causes someone to coffin [?]
This is all we doin' with hip-hop, we lost it
And we should be ashamed of ourselves
The only people we can blame is ourselves, (who else?)

[Hook]

[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosius]
I dare to dream, to be all I can be
For I am I
My imagination, I can do it all
I can do it all, do just what I want

[Verse 3: Saigon]
I got released from Atlantic Records, 2010
I swear to God, I felt like I's gettin' outta the pen
It started off real good, but how will it end
Will I make it to the top of the tower again?
Will I be on Hot 9 or Power again?
Or will the people just assume that I'm sour within
I told my story to 40,000 people
Now it's time for me to get equal, the sequel

[Hook]
