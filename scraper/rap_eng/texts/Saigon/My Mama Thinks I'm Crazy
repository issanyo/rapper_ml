[Intro – Saigon]
Uh, how real is, this? (uh-huh)
How real is... this? (Saigon)
Do it, do it

[Hook – Curbside Hustle and (Saigon)]
My mama thinks I'm crazy (my mama think I'm crazy)
My mama thinks I'm craaaaazy (you do)
My mama thinks I'm crazy (my mama think I'm crazy)
But she don't know a thiiiiiiing

[Verse 1 – Saigon]
Uh, uh, uh
Truth or dare.  Who should care?  Lucifer's near, proof is there
Either your gun is a souvenir, or you use it, yeah
When you use it, you face the music.  Prison—you lose it there
How could you compare?  Niggas is 20 and they losin’ hair
Mama said "Brian, I hate to say this shit, but I don't be lyin’
The way you livin’, I only picture you dyin’"
And though I'm defiant, I know the reason why she droppin’ the science
Know why that's what she implyin’—I know why she cryin’

[Hook – Curbside Hustle and (Saigon)]
My mama thinks I'm crazy (damn, my mama think I'm crazy)
My mama thinks I'm craaaaazy

[Verse 2 – Saigon]
Two to the one.  I get a gun, you get a gun and do it for fun
Mama not believin’ there's reasons niggas'll shoot at her son
She know I sell smoke but don't know that I'm movin’ a ton
Hard to find a job, yeah, at least not a lucrative one
One of your dude's nigga’s gettin’ money that's much younger than you
You catch hustle fever, your temperature's like 102
'Stead of goin’ to see the doc, you goin’ to see 'Pac
Pop was short for popular, gotta supply the B-rock
She wrote me when I was in C-block

[Hook – Curbside Hustle and (Saigon)]
My mama thinks I'm crazy (my mama think I'm crazy)
My mama thinks I'm crazy (uhh, my mama think I'm crazy)
My mama thinks I'm craaaaazy

[Verse 3 – Saigon]
My mama checkin’ in my bedroom but I ain't there
I left a note that said, "Life ain't fair" (life ain't fair)
I came back and seen a note that said, "I ain't care
Yeah, motherfucker, life ain't fair.  I let you live here"
The struggles of a single black woman raisin’ a man
That and poverty obviously go hand in hand
Damn!  My mama think I'm crazy
The funny thing she been thinkin’ this since I was a baby
Well if I'm crazy, then I'm prayin’ that father can save me
‘Cause my mama?  My mama?  MY MAMA?
Man, listen

[Hook – Curbside Hustle and (Saigon)]
My mama thinks I'm crazy (my mama think I'm crazy)
But she don't know a thiiiiiiing
My damn mama thinks I'm crazy, uh, uh-huh
(How real is, this?)
