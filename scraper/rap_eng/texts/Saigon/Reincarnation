[Verse: Bryonn Bain]
Definitions are for definers and not for the defined
Definitions are for definers and not for the divine
Definitions definitely ain't divine
You can't define anything divine with any definition you can find
What you can find is a long line of definers, a definitively [lost-in?] mind
Been tryin’ to define my black behind since before the beginning of, time
Since I sold Earth's solid gold and told her son to shine
Made the moon swoon with the swig of her own moonshine
She still can't walk a straight line anymore
She stumbles in circular motion, shaking even the ocean's floor
Back and forth and forth and back
She gets so dizzy, she sees black
She gets too dizzy—everything goes black
And once you go black you never go, back.  Word
Once you go black, word, you never go backward
You only go black-ward
And the blackest word I ever heard was WE
So I turned it upside-down and use it interchangeably with ME
