We talking about life (yeah)
Real life
We talking about
You know what it is
K-Salaam, Saigon
Check

[Verse 1]
Yo it's a very beautiful thing when you can bring truth to the light
Spit hardness, and still get the youth to unite
It ain't one rapper out now maneuvering right
Your ice is nice, but what you trying to do for the fight?
You gonna play pussy or play dog
I'ma make the DJ play songs for y'all that made it to the morgue
You gotta understand the situation we placed in
Malcolm got murdered, we never got his replacement
Kinda makes sense why niggas'll wet your face in
For something as stupid as chasing a reputation
Saigon, the gun man
I could bust a sawed off shotgun with one hand
Give you a quick suntan
Real recognize real
All I recognize when I look in your eyes is a guy that'll squeal
Son, I'm ill like the shit MacGuyver could build
Treat you and your troops like the hoop when I deposit the pill
Am I a man or a miracle?
Some don't understand this is lyrical
All they know is it's complex and the grammar is difficult
If you'd expand your peripheral
Take some of the jewels I'm here to give to you
You wouldn't be so miserable

[Bridge]
What you know about it?
What you think about it?
When you true about it, what you gonna do about it?
The shit they giving us is bad for the mind
You gonna see, it's just a matter of time (watch)

[Verse 2]
Believe it or not, I am Jesus of hip hop
Prophesizing how these niggas need to get they shit rocked
And these lil bitches should get tit shots
Think it's hot to rap about your little stinking ass twat
But bitch it is not
Be the same lady crying when your daughter get raped
Cause she fucked around and got influenced by Lil Kim tape
Only thirteen with Kim shape
The fake eyes, the face, only thing she was missing was breast inflates
Oops, I meant implants
Shorty even did the Lil Kim dance
Money chilled, stood in his stance
Shit, he had it all planned in advance
Just a little more Henny and she'll give him his chance to get in them pants
He a older cat, 29, and one of the lamer ones
But wasn't dumb enough not to know what game to run
He threw the Lil Kim tape on
Then he bet her a yard she wouldn't do whatever came on in the song
Shorty was like, "uh-uh, nigga you wrong
I hold my freak crown down, ain't a dick that's too long"
Freaked off as he flipped through the song
You can just sit and imagine what happened so I'mma just move on
Make a long story short, homes got caught
Statutory rape, shorty on a block with a quart
Still wishing she was popping the cork
And could maybe someday fuck her way to the top of New York
This crazy...
