[Intro: Saigon]
I do this shit for nigga, man, Omnipotent.  Yeah, for you man.  For all y’all niggas.  To every girl with their man in jail: they don’t know how hard it is, son.  Post that bail.  When you see that man, tell him:

[Hook 1: Saigon]
Sugar pie, honey bum you know that I love guns
I can't help myself
Can't keep that heat on the shelf
You knew I was a knucklehead
Ever since you met me
I tried to do good for you, boo
But them streets wouldn't let me
You wanted a relationship
You was willing to chase it
I know you seen the pack I kept the ninas packed
But you just couldn't face it
You mad they got me locked away
Tell me are you leavin'? Are you going away?
I put my trust in you to hold it down like Claire Huxtable
‘Cause I'm in love with you ...

[Chorus 2: Saigon]
I know all the shit that you did for me
But now that I’m locked, is you troopin’ the bid with me?
Are you willing to suffer for my stupidity?
Huh ma? Huh ma? Huh mama?
I know all that shit that you did for me
But now that I'm locked is you troopin' the bid with me?
Are you willing to suffer for my stupidity?
Huh ma? Huh ma? Huh mama?

[Verse 1: Saigon]
9-5 I crime drive, pockets swellin' with stacks
My girl said, “Keep sellin' them cracks, you gon' dwell in the max.”
I ignored her, knowin' she was only tellin' the facts
Either that or get my melon cracked when the shell interact
But fuck it ‘cause I done been to hell and back
I feel my C-cipher senses is well intact—I'm developed in that
If I can just find a slumlord to sell us a shack
I'll set up shop with this dumb broad, live elephant phat
Where the fellas is at?  Sit, spark a L and chit chat
On how we can sell Richter for fifty flat till they tell us it's whack
Then we drop the price to fourty-three like they feel that it oughta be
In all re-al, we still quadruple a quarter key
Unfortunately police caught me
The man I shot in the Camelot tellin' the jailers where they escorted me
And that’s a real-life situation.  9680549
Is you mine?

[Chorus 2: Saigon]
I know all the shit that you did for me
But now that I’m locked, is you troopin’ to bear it with me?
Are you willing to suffer for my stupidity?
Huh ma? Huh ma? Huh mama?
I know all that shit that you did for me
But now that I'm locked is you troopin' the bid with me?
Are you willing to suffer for my stupidity?
Huh ma? Huh ma? Huh mama?

[Chorus 1: Saigon]
Sugar pie, honey bum you know that I love guns
I can't help myself
Can't keep that heat on the shelf
You knew I was a knucklehead
Ever since you met me
I tried to do good for you, boo
But them streets wouldn't let me
You wanted a relationship
You was willing to chase it
I know you seen the pack I kept the ninas packed
But you just couldn't face it
You mad they got me locked away
Tell me are you leavin'? Are you going away?
I put my trust in you to hold it down like Claire Huxtable
‘Cause I'm in love with you ...

[Outro: Saigon]
I need you, girl.  Some serious shit, man.  Facing five to fifteen, son.  I got a violent crime, Imma get smacked at the board, man.  This shit is crazy.  Whatever you could do, a nigga gon’ appreciate it.  Know that, y’know what’m saying?  When I was out there, I was tryna hold it down for the both of us, y’know what’m saying?  So… I see a lot of niggas in here crying, y’know what’m saying?  I don’t wanna end up like one of these niggas.  What you gonna do, baby?  You gonna love me from here?  Yeah.  To everybody I know.
