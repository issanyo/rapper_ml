[Intro: Saigon]
I just wanna tell you
I mean this from the bottom of my heart, girl
Damn...

[Verse 1: Saigon]
Now you wanna merk love
After I drop the rock and cop the work glove
When manual labor was unheard of
Thought that we would spend all eternity forever together
But now you gone.  How could you move on?
I sit and reminisce as I'm poppin' off beer tops
Quarter for my memories of all the fallen tear drops
It'd be a lie if I told you I couldn't cry
You never said goodbye so why shouldn't I
Even before I fucked ya, I knew that I discovered my wife
Through prison and all the strife, you the love of my life
When I was caught up in the mix, you bought my baby sis and brother kicks
Trusted me even after you busted me with other chicks
By you departing, left my shit torn slim
I 'member flirting with your friends and you be flipping on them
In missionary position, I used to feed you my manhood
I even devoured you cause the power you was so damn good
Them sad songs had me poppin' off beer tops
Quarter for my memories of all the fallen tear drops
I think deep when I recollect on your mindstate
Lately, I contribute to the rising of the crime rate
And roam redâ€”all the sane thoughts in my dome dead
Was it something I said that made you aim at your own head
Continue sleeping.  I'm sorry I was wrong for cheating
I'm in your heart even though its no longer beating

[Outro: Saigon]
Man, that's some fucked up shit, girl
You could've warned me, girl
