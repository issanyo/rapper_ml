[Verse 1: Reks]
Hard body, my bars probably
Would off John , Bob Marley
Step poppy banging I was hardly
Higher than them handle bars
They was higher than the stars be
Now I handle bars, awesome gnarly
R' son of Marcus Garvey
Tongue move back to Africa
Sing Sing, Attica, pardon me
This the kind of beat that bring the this or that part of me
Pray for me attitude magnitude possibly
Katrina flood water, don't try to avoid us
Kidnap DJs, ducttape for dollars
Propaganda revolution gun cock your hammer
Lyrical gift for bitch ass bad santa
The grammar slam a nigga  sleep spit
Bitches on the street in thong song shit, Freaknik
Mardi Gras party hard
I'm laughing at ya'll, hardy har
Bar for bar body all of ya'll, frequent!

[Hook: Reks]
I'ma need participation here
Hands in the air can I get an aw yeah (aw yeah)
Sucka DJs let's get one thing clear
Hazardis and Reks yes this is our year (aw yeah)
B-boys and DJs (DJs)
MCs graffiti artists
Whenever we play (we play)
The revolution now in your ear

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
Haile Selassie lungs, Bob Marley bong
Marcus Garvey hardy get my black party on
Malcolm X tech, by any means
Still rep Queens, by any means
Martin Luther thoughts, smokin' Newports
Old English 40, fucking an English shorty
Elijah Muhammed heart, with his crown too
Farrakhan tongue, you hear my sounds through
Harriet Tubman feet, mind of Mandela
Shots rain nigga you gon' need an umbrella
Obama focus, Cashis Clay hands
Seen black eyes like Ray-bans
Che Guevara beard, vision of Chavez
And still run laps around A-rab heads
So let's connect throught that e-mail address
And keep the shit moving forward Haz never backwards

[Hook: Reks]
I'ma need participation here
Hands in the air can I get an aw yeah (aw yeah)
Sucka DJs let's get one thing clear
Hazardis and Reks yes this is our year (aw yeah)
B-boys and DJs (DJs)
MCs graffiti artists
Whenever we play (we play)
The revolution now in your ear

[Verse 3: Saigon]
Why is society bias? why a variety of liars?
They putting something in the water probably a virus
Why is Sai as bright as the eye of Osiris
But I'm overlooked cause I'm dropping science
Instead of vying for flyness
How we survive all the bloggers who try to rob us
And never give us our propers
Cause motherfuckers is knob slobbers
They like balls in they mouth
And I ain't talkin' bout Gobstoppers
Click boom, no shakalaka
And how can ya'll listen to yada yada
When I could concoct a provocative verse and merk it like a choppa
It's not the shit to be black no more
I think we need to be seein' some afros more
A rebel without a pause
A pause for the cause
It come to that revolution it's balls to the wall
Saigon legendary, so look bum
Let me get the fuck out of here 'fore the hook come

[Hook: Reks]
I'ma need participation here
Hands in the air can I get an aw yeah (aw yeah)
Sucka DJs let's get one thing clear
