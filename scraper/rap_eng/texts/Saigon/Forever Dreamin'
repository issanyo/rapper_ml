[Intro]
Yo
I remember Extra P told Q-Tip "don't say the year"
But I'ma say the year
The year is 2012
The reason I'ma say the year cause we lost somebody very special to me
Very special to hip hop
Chris Lighty
We love you forever man
C'mon

[Hook]
Oh, where I’m from it goes down everyday
Oh, but still I dream that there’s a better way
Lord, everybody got a problem, make a couple dollars
Gotta spend that on a bottle, yeah
Oh, so you can drown all your troubles away
Oh, or you can be what you destined to be
As long as I’m breathing, I’ma keep on living for the dream I believe in
Forever dreaming

[Verse 1]
Whether crack wars or rap tours, we walking them dogs
With the track jaws, attack frauds, get tossed in the morgue
When I blast off past forward, my criminal past falls
Last cat that him and my paths cross is bad off
Talking bad off, I mean really really bad off
Let’s just say next time you see him, you gon take your hat off
Look America, it's Saigon from the abandoned
I’m probably one of Harriet Tubman's great, great, great, great grand kids
What the fuck I care about John Paul or Sir Francis?
Ask who original man is, they dance us around the answers
If we a micro in the macro of crackers, the Earth's cancers
Is willing to go against nature and suffer the circumstances?
I got the intel, of a nigga that study stem cells
Shit'll get ugly in hell, it’s no way it can end well
Police got a nigga barred from my own hood
Sometimes I think I’m too smart for my own good

[Hook]
Oh, where I’m from it goes down everyday
Oh, but still I dream that there’s a better way
Lord, everybody got a problem, make a couple dollars
Gotta spend that on a bottle, yeah
Oh, so you can drown all your troubles away
Oh, or you can be what you destined to be
As long as I’m breathing, I’ma keep on living for the dream I believe in
Forever dreaming

[Verse 2]
I got a migraine, head throbbing, feeling pain
Present outlook on life, is that there’s nothing else to gain
The old timers scold the gold miners, see I suppose
He telling all he knows once the Wild Irish rose
Flows form in my brain, heavy verses, purgatory in vain
3 on the rock, 3 on parole, it’s insane
My workers is getting greedier and greedier
Caught my partner black in his back, now he suffer from paraplegia
Nothing getting easier, cousin playing the game of crime
I aim the 9, emphasizing, see my frame of mind?
Sniffing cocaine, I got a rhyme for every grain
Trying to maintain, simply trying to stay in my lane
See money comes, money goes, like a runny nose
When you blow it, it going to your honeys and foes
I never thought I could be happier in bummier clothes
Well lookie here, Joe, what do you know

[Hook]
Oh, where I’m from it goes down everyday
Oh, but still I dream that there’s a better way
Lord, everybody got a problem, make a couple dollars
Gotta spend that on a bottle, yeah
Oh, so you can drown all your troubles away
Oh, or you can be what you destined to be
As long as I’m breathing, I’ma keep on living for the dream I believe in
Forever dreaming

[Verse 3]
I got a daughter in California I hardly see
Even 3000 miles away she’s a part of me
For her I'll spill every bit of blood in my artery
I'll kill a nigga whether he thug or he R&B
And to Milan, I'm trying to strengthen the bond
With your mom, so even when she bugging, I keep calm
Even if I needed niggas to write for me
They couldn't cause they wouldn't believe in my life story

[Hook]
Oh, where I’m from it goes down everyday
Oh, but still I dream that there’s a better way
Lord, everybody got a problem, make a couple dollars
Gotta spend that on a bottle, yeah
Oh, so you can drown all your troubles away
Oh, or you can be what you destined to be
As long as I’m breathing, I’ma keep on living for the dream I believe in
Forever dreaming
