[Intro: Saigon]
You ever get the feeling..
No matter what they do...
No matter what they say..
You know you'll make it, someday..

[Verse 1: Saigon]
You know the feeling when your back is up against the wall?
People say they love you but you ain't convinced at all
Tell 'em they're full of shit and they tell you you're insecure
Callin you immature, does that make sense to ya'll?
You ever feel like it's you against the whole world?
Like everybody is schemin' even your own girl?
Your home boys seem to be countin your money
Tell 'em you ain't got it and they lookin at you funny
Feelin' like I probably need to either leave the game alone
Or either be the G to bang the chrome to get his name known
How does the Saigon story end? (How?)
Know what they saying for now?

[Refrain: Saigon]
They say I'm a Killer
I feel I'm as high as I can be
And ya'll ain't gonna die as high as me
I can't be no realer
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
I can't be no realer
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down

[Verse 2: Saigon]
I'm too high, but it's not from a drug
It's not from a drink, it's not from a night at the club
It's not from a broad, it's not what I copped from the dealer
I would tell ya, but if I tell ya, then I gotta kill ya
The Greatest Story is near, and now I'm kinda scared
It's ill, I'm like a vet that's still wet behind the ears
Some niggas look hard, but I don't feel the threat behind the stares
I'm lookin for vics' and they could be volunteers
I dare somebody (to) jump out the window and try to stop me
I wait for niggas and shoot em like I was a paparazzi
That Just Blaze'll knock in the Maserati
I'll jump out the back and turn your block into Nagasaki
I shouldn't have to always make an issue with the pistol
Just to prove the kid is official tissue to the gristle
How does the Saigon story end? (How?)
Know what they saying for now?

[Refrain: Saigon]
They say I'm a Killer
I feel I'm as high as I can be
And ya'll ain't gonna die as high as me
I can't be no realer
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
I can't be no realer
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down

They say I'm a Killer
I feel I'm as high as I can be
And ya'll ain't gonna die as high as me
I can't be no realer
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
I can't be no realer
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
Ya'll ain't gon bring me down
