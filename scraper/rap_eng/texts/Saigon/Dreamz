When I was a young boy, I had one toy...
And all I wanted was one more
That's something my mama couldn't afford, I was forced
To play with whatever I found when I got bored
I had dreams, of becoming the middleweight champ of the world
Not an old man that can't get a girl
Can't get a job, cause of my prior conviction
I'm a changed man but I fit the liar's description
So I dream, that one day my felony'll go away
But I know it's gon' be with a nigga till I'm old and grey
Move so I can show the way, (please) please listen to my words
No your life is not something you want to throw away
Don't make the mistakes I made, go to school get good grades
Don't worry about trying to get paid
Cause at the end of the day
The only thing real is whateverâ€™s still there
When the money go away, yeah

When I was just eighteen, I was in state greens
And Ron G was still a mixtape king
In there nobody rapped about they bling
What we did have in common though is we all shared the same dream
Of someday going back to the streets
To real studios with accurate beats
Instead of banging on the table with the checker piece
Dreams of popping bottles celebrating my record release
I had dreams, to meet Jay-Z say whattup to Nas
Fuck them other rappers, them niggas ain't motherfucking stars
As far as I'm concerned, Snoop nicer without the perm
Way before the pimp cup, before I got sent up
I had dreams, to do joints with Ja and Supreme
Used to root for Khalid El-Amin
Whoever thought five years later that Saigon would drop on the scene
They'd be calling me the next hottest thing, yup, bada bing

Only a few of y'all could really feel what I write
Niggas like Mike Tyson and Marion "Suge" Knight
Like Capone and Nore, they both know the story
They know how far a mufucka'll go for glory
Khadafi was in the L before he was well stocky
Before Intelligent Hoodlum, before the Foul Madhi
Black Rob still like Woah, cause the shit still played
Came a long way since the Fishkill days
U-God from the Wu squad, Nature, son been there
All together X done been in for like ten years
2Pac, you know we can forget about you, Pac
The media took the shit and blew the shit threw the roof top
It's a foul system, take weak minds and twist them
Have niggas gone so long, that niggas forget to miss them
It's fucked up but it's real
Shit, I hope they let Shyne home on appeal
