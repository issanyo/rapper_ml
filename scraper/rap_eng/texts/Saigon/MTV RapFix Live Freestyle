[Saigon]
I ain't worried about you rapping, pa -- your voice is just noisy-ness
Ain't worried about you clapping, pa -- your boys are just boisterous
I ain't really a rapper, nah
Far out of the cast at all
Faker jacking off
I'll clap at y'all, hop in back of an Acura black as tar
Swift as Marvelous Marvin Hag-a-ler
I'd be rich if I had a penny for every battle scar
You got a punk heart
I knew you was [pussy] from jump-start
S-A-I-gon, keep it funkier than a skunk fart
Blow the back of your face off the front part
I'm what they call a living contradiction
Why? Cause I'm dumb smart
Rappers ain't really a match for this
I guzzle a fifth of Matheson's
Then say the alphabet backwards afterwards
The day you see a dead (nigga) just hop out of his coffin
The day you see me beefing, I blow it out of proportion
This from New York to Boston, Dallas to Austin
If you married the streets, don't plan to file for divorce then
