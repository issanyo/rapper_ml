[Hook: Corbett & Saigon]

Don't let me be, just another one
I always told myself, I'll be here when it's done
I know they don't believe, but see we just begun
Momma I'm growin up, you gotta let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Hey
Momma I'm growin up, you gotta let me run

[Verse 1: Saigon]
I don't know but I gotta go, Gotta go slow, but I gotta go cause I gotta grow
The flow got a nigga fall but I gotta show that I got a lot mo' to go
I gotta blow
I won't take no, I don't think so
Hold on strong and no I won't let go
I'm almost there, I know I won't take long
I look in the rear and it's a long way home
Don't let me be, just another one
Momma I'm growin up, run that to your younger son
I'm the one when it's all said and done
Let it run to get a gun, the one that'll blow one
The one with the cold stare, niggas wanna go there
And oh yeah I don't fear no one
Right now Twista-like style
Quick to pipe down when usually I fight back
Now I'm lookin' like wow
I came to learn that my main concern's gripping the mic down
Wow, album number two, how comfortable, last one was for you
This one is for you and for frontin' niggas too
Comin' for you, now what you gonna do?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Saigon]
Run away with the moonlight
Third eye too bright for me to lose sight
And I'm only fuckin' with niggas that move right
Can't rock with a man pants too tight
You belong in the blue light district
This prick take "ho nigga" to new height
You in the strip club you might
See a nigga throwing bread, no food fight, right
Got a style like Ike
The beat is my bitch, I'm wild for the night
Soup's upside your head when I spit it
Another DV tell the Feds I did it
Get on TV with a Red Sox fitted
Bet I won't go near Bed-Stuy with it
You know I'm just kiddin, Earth is our turf
I'm the person to say that first in my verse
Don't let me be, just another one
Just a statistic when I'm havin so much fun
I'm in the boom-boom room with a poon-poon
Lips smellin like perfume, wanna resume soon
Put your money where your mouth is
Bet you find your honey where my house is

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Saigon]
I don't know what I'm runnin' from
I don't know where I'm runnin' to
Seems your dreams are not comin' true
What the fuck are you gonna do?
Stop it now? How dumb are you?
How many lumps you want, one or two?
Your future's right there in front of you
Whatever you do with it is up to you
Not for nothin' but who the fuck are you?
Lot of other people are fucked up too
You ain't the only one who luck's up, boo
Life's a bitch, but you could fuck her too
Like I said mami, it's up to you
We don't do L's. W's
I'm not comfortable with number two
But it's up to you, it's up to you

[Hook]
