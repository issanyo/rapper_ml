(Intro)
Yo, lets get it popping up in here yo
Yeah, there it go
Yeah, thats what I was lookin' for
Ayo, check it out son
Im'ma show these cats how we do it

(Verse 1)
Before we did raps, we did kidnaps
Murders, muggings
Cousin, what you know about thugging?
When y'all niggas be out clubbing
I be deep in discussion tryin'a convince my little cousin not to blood in
Keep love for the Pimps, Lucky he got another buck in
Damn shame his motherfuckin' baby mother cluckin'
She be out with some coward that ain't about shit
Rumors say she put out quick for not even an outfit
Nowadays everybody riding or dying
We own this game, stop tryin'a buy in
Frontin' like you pop iron, stop lyin'
I'm a nigga so ill I punch Math and then drop Science
Saigon, the man with the 2 brains and 3 hearts
Swift enough to build with retards
Rap epitome, academically street smart
That ain't even the deep part
Me and my men end every fight that we start
If I ain't one of the lot of you, the stacks is unstoppable
On as long as Macks poppable, Cracks is choppable
If its logical, I'll body you, beat the shit outta you
Go to your Wake and beat shit outta whoever says "Bye" to you
This is what I would do, and if you was me? you'd body you too
Cause you'd hate a bitch nigga like you
(Word to mother nigga, if you was me?
Nigga you'd fuckin' put 1 in your brain too nigga)

(Chorus)
If you be living for death and dont be giving an eff
Then hit a pig in the vest and say yes (yes!)
If you be puffing the cess and laying sunk in the S
Then punch a punk in the chest and say yes (yes!)
If you a gangsta, hustla, thugsta that bust slugs
Nigga that dont trust hugs, and dont fuck with the bustas
Hold a blunt in your right and raise your left
You blessed so you should just say yes (yes!)

(Verse 2)
Ayo they trapped me in this violent enviroment
Blocks so hot, they need to fire the cops and hire some Firemen
Thugs get forced to early retirement
If they blaze your head, you made your bed, nigga, now lie in it
Need to stop denying it, pressure? you ain't applying it
1 nigga get mercked, look at you on some cryin' shit
Yeah I cried when I see my little nigga get murdered
Not cause he died, but cause the shit looked like it hurted
And I'm a nigga that's observant
I seen the bullet when it first hit, his face when it first split
And still no longer than 20 minutes later
I'm on the same block, same Glock, with the same pen and paper
You analyze an innovator
S to the A to the I, show niggas what men are made of
Before you see me in The Source, you'll probably see me in the paper
For poppin' a cop or dockin' shots at a women raper

(Chorus)
If you be living for death and dont be giving an eff
Then hit a pig in the vest and say yes (yes!)
If you be puffing the cess and laying sunk in the S
Then punch a punk in the chest and say yes (yes!)
If you a gangsta, hustla, thugsta that bust slugs
Nigga that dont trust hugs, and dont fuck with the bustas
Hold a blunt in your right and raise your left
You blessed so you should just say yes (yes!)

(Verse 3)
Ayo, you knew I'm better than you
Front, get a few embedded in you
Just cause I ain't have nothing better to do
See what this Beretta will do?
Turn a perfectly functioning human being to a veg-et-a-ble
We wettin' you from your head to your shoe
Yo the only attention you gon' need now is medical dude
And if the shotty pops you, fuckin' coroners will body box you
Call the guy that I bought to Karate chop you
To hell with ya crew, you be spittin' that shit thats not true
My niggas have lived and died for this shit since Junior High School
Funny how rappers talk out they ass but ain't about shit
So I set 'em on fire and use gas to put it out with
They cowards, talking bout they 'bout it, but we doubt it
The rhyme won't make you a thug, nor do fatigue outfits
We box, nigga we plots tempers shorter than Ewoks
Lace the Reeboks, chase you three blocks then *Gunshot noises*
Unload 33 shots biaaaaaaatch

Little faggot, stupid motherfuckers in the game
Yo yo, I rep for real niggas son
You know what type of niggas I rep

(Chorus)
If you be living for death and dont be giving an eff
Then hit a pig in the vest and say yes (yes!)
If you be puffing the cess and laying sunk in the S
Then punch a punk in the chest and say yes (yes!)
If you a gangsta, hustla, thugsta that bust slugs
Nigga that dont trust hugs, and dont fuck with the bustas
Hold a blunt in your right and raise your left
You blessed so you should just say yes (yes!)

(Outro)
Word is bond son, I told y'all like 15 thousand years ago
That niggas was coming back for that shit
That real niggas was gonna re-emerge and take fake niggas off the map
And now that time is here baby, its 2K
