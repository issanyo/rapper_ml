[Verse 1: Missy Eliott]
Okay okay they call me Missy Miss, bad bitch
No one mad like the average
Don't you ever try to come for me

Scandalous, vandalous, M.I.A. they can't handle this
We on fire like candlestick
And get the crowd pumped up like asses
Money in my pocket and I bounce like hydraulic
And the beat be so retarded makes me kicking like karate
Roll, got that flow make that freaks wanna get down low
Get down low make em touch them toes
I got them flows ain't you worry foe
Gravity gravity dj's play the hit
Classical, epicness M.I.A. we too legit

My chain hits my chest when I'm bangin'-bangin'

F-f-f-f-face it, let's face it
If your paper, then I chase it
Got magazine? I'll grace it
If you got it, you can't place it
You could fill spacer, you're a car racer
You get it, then I could I'm a big buster
I got it, I got-got it
I got-got it on my bullet
So pull it, push my button
Damn it, push my button now
I got it, I got-got it
I got-got it on my bullet
So pull it, push my button
Damn it, push my button now
DNA, go trace it, story, I face it
The future authority, hear it go crazy
It's not about intelligence, don't get all confused
I'm a bad bitch, and I'm a big buster

[Hook: M.I.A.]
My chain hits my chest when I'm bangin'-bangin'
When I'm bangin'
My chain hits my chest when I'm bangin' on the radio
