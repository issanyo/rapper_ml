I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show, go
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom

Go, like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh, I'mma show you how to shake it
How the booty shake
Show you how to shake it
See the booty shake

See the booty shake
Like an earthquake
There is no escape
When I shake it in your face

Now don't you wanna tape
A booty shakin' on your tape?
So show it to your boys and
See the look on all they face

I move it to the left
Move it to the right
Double time, double time, all right
Show 'em what they like

Look at it, look at it
Slow motion, freeze
Stop for the camera
Paparazzi wanna see
Cheese

Hello, hey how you doin'?
I shake it like this
Now let me see if you can do it

Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop it on the one
Shake, shake, shake, shake
They faces all stunned

If you got it, got it, got it
Then move if kinda fast
If the boys all dance
While they tryna make a pass

Whistle while you work
Go 'head do your dirt
Even if you like to flirt

Lift up your skirts
Then turn 'em out
One leg girl
Go 'head shake it out

I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show, go
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom

Go, like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh, I'mma show you how to shake it
Show you how to shake it
Show you how to shake it

Now when I walk through the the door, door
Step aside, side
With thighs like fries we gonna size a supersize

Do milkshake go with that shake?
It sure do baby
Do milkshake go with that shake?
Uh huh

Now first you bend over
Put your hands on your hips
Then you make a stank face
Then go on and let it whip

Whip it like moms
Witcha witcha back then
Then catch your breaf and then start it up again

One minute, two minute, three minute stop
Erybody drop like their have from the cops
Ayyo, there will be no fights
Though got a club, we ain't turnin' on the lights

Sally got a big old donkey
Oh yeah
And Missy got a big old donkey
Oh yeah

And you got plenty more to show, go
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom

Go, like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh, I'mma show you how to shake it
How the booty shake
Show you how to shake it

See I was sitting in the lounge
With my tight skirt on
And like a 3-D movie
He was watchin' the thong

All up in my grill
So he asked could he tag it
Two-timing from an ish like maggots

He tryin' to spit the game
What he had to say
Has anybody ever told you you look like Beyonce?

OK lil' boy want to boost my esteem
I said you need a rehab
'Cause you look like a fiend

Don't want to start a scene
I ain't tryin' to be mean
And even if you spend your green
You ain't get in between

'Cause this here queen
Keep on looking for clean
And like a diamond ring bling
See who wants get the wet dream

I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show, go
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom

Go, like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh, I'mma show you how to shake it
How the booty shakin'
Show you how to shake it
Let you see the booty shakin'
