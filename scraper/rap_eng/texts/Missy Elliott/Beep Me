[Verse 1]
Why you playing on me?
Wasn't I good enough for you?
All those other boys you've been with
Can't do like I do, no, no
I gave you all my money
When you needed it all the time
And if you left me in the dark without any kind of sign


[Chorus]
Beep me 9-1-1 or call me on your cellphone
I'll call you back to see what you won't tell me
You don't wanna date, no ifs, ands or waits
It's over, baby
Beep me 9-1-1 or call me on your cellphone
I'll call you back to see what you won't tell me
You don't wanna date, no ifs, ands or waits
It's over, baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
Why you playin on me?
Can you tell me what I've done?
I thought you was the one
But you just hit and run
I gave up all the parties and the clubs
I put them aside
You left me in the dark without any kind of sign

[Chorus]
Beep me 9-1-1 or call me on your cellphone
I'll call you back to see what you won't tell me
You don't wanna date, no ifs, ands or waits
It's over, baby
Beep me 9-1-1 or call me on my cellphone
I'll call you back to see what you won't tell me
You don't wanna date, no ifs, ands or waits
It's over, baby

[Bridge]
All my friends say I can do better than you
(All my friends say that I can do better)
Maybe they was right 'cause now I'm feeling like a fool, oh
But I can't let you go without you taking some time
So tell me why you left me without a goddamn sign

[Chorus]
Beep me 9-1-1 or call me on your cellphone
I'll call you back to see what you won't tell me
You don't wanna date, no ifs, ands or waits
It's over, baby
Beep me 9-1-1 or call me on my cellphone
I'll call you back to see what you won't tell me
You don't wanna date, no ifs, ands or waits
It's over, baby

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, ooh
