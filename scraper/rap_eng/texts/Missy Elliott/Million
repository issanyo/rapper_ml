[Intro: Aaliyah]
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All...
Million, million

[Bridge: Tink]
Like a million, million, million, people told me
Not to trust in you
But there's a million, million, million, million reasons why
I fuck with you

[Verse 1: Tink]
Cause you touch my spirit, can you feel it, give me that
There's a passion for it, can't ignore it, give me that, love
Cause your love give me goosebumps
You're the right one when I need some, I call you
Real love never gives up on a Tuesday
If it does rain, you come through
Your love's like a big hug on a bad day
Just what I need in my life
You're one in a million
When I wake was the first thing on my mind

[Pre-Hook]
Your love's like my drug, I can't live without it
That's just what you do to me boy
For your love I'd proudly climb a mountain
Cause that's just what you do to me boy
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me

[Hook]
Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)
Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)
Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)
Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)

[Verse 2: Tink]
Your love's like a back rub when I back up
And you catch what I throw down
Your love's what I breathe from, I would go numb
If you left me here right now
Our love gets stronger when we break up
We'll be right back in no time
And our love's made of concrete when you rock me
I just feel so safe and

[Bridge]
Like a million, million, million, people told me
Not to trust in you
But there's a million, million, million, million reasons why
I fuck with you
I fuck with you, in love with you, I run with you, oh yeah
I fuck with you, in love with you, I run with you, oh yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Your love's like my drug, I can't live without it
That's just what you do to me boy
For your love I'd proudly climb a mountain
Cause that's just what you do to me boy
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me

[Hook]
Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)
Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)
Goes on and on and on

Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)

[Verse 3: Tink]
You give me a really good feelin'
You can make life worth livin'
You can be the piece i'm missin'
Love is a maze and we get through it when we just listen
You can be the voice I carry
You can be the man I marry
We can have this for a very
Long time, what's the wrong time
When the right time is a life time
You remember back when

[Bridge]
A million, million, million, people told me not
To trust in you
But there's a million, million, million, million reasons why
I fuck with you
