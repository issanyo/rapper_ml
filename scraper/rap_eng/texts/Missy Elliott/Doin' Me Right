He got plans understand he want some chil'ren
Cuz together we foreva so appealin

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]
My baby not a player
He's wit me everywhere
And when I'm feeling down
He tell me baby stay up
He always straight up
Whenever when we break up
He call to say I love you
Thats how we make up
Trips to Jacob, like a snowflake uh
Shine so bright to make the dead wake up
Great lover, hotter than a baker
Keep my face sweaty til there is no more make-up

[Chorus]
My man be doin me right girl (doin me right, doin me right oh)
He give me what I like girl (what I like, what I like oh)
We make love all night girl
My man be doin me right girl (doin me right, doin me right oh)

[Bridge]
Oh and it feels so good to be so in love
And to have someone right by your side, treating you right, and doin you right
Ooh He knows whats best for me and he'll do anything
To keep me happy
My man...

[Chorus]
My man be doin me right girl (doin me right, doin me right oh)
He give me what I like girl (what I like, what I like oh)
We make love all night girl
My man be doin me right girl (doin me right, doin me right oh)
