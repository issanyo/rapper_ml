[Intro - Missy Elliott]
Aye yo
It's too many producers Ha Ha
Is giving off these fraud beats, you know what i'm saying
Your worst mistake is to try duplicate anything that Timbaland make
So, you gone hear this beat one time and one time only
And I'm gone do a lil something on it

[Verse 1 - Missy Elliott]
Bitches
I never wanna hang with bitches
Since I turned Missy
Every bitch wanna meet me booty lickin
My ass they kissin
But I feel like they way to picky
I use to know a guy name Ricky
Oh really? Don't piss me off and
Son, better let ya'll know ya'll lucky
Cause if I come out buckin
The whole world better be duckin
Cause I roll with Puffy
No doubt, shit turned out get ugly
No matter what you still love me
Me whack, you buggin

[Chorus - Missy Elliott]
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
He got the beats
He got the beats that make me jump, jump, jump

He got the beats that make me rocky dodi dum
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
Pass da blunt on the left hand side

[Verse 2 - Missy Elliott]
