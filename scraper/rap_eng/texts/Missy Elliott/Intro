- Come on, get out the way!
- The light's green. Move!
- I hate these gangsta singers with their music loud. Ma'am! Ma'am, can you please turn your rap music down? You just woke my baby up. Dammit! O.K. I just called the cops

*baby crying*
*sirens*

- Don't you ever interrupt me when I'm listening to a Monica record. (Oh)

[Intro: Missy]
Yeah, straight out the slumming streets of A-T-L
I know you waited for her arrival
Through the hurricanes, torandoes, and thunderstorms
The climate has now changed
And the storm is now over
I repeat the storm is now over
Let us begin
Hey, yo, Monica turn the volume up!
