[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
My best friend say she sick of me cryin' on the phone
Tellin' how the men be doggin' me
My best friend say don't tell her nothin' bout me and you
'Cause she ain't showin' me no sympathy
My best friend say
If she was me, she'd have let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend say, my best friend say
I'll be there

[Chorus: Missy Elliott & Aaliyah]
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need, you can lean on me
Come on, I'll be there for you
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need, you can lean on me
Come on, I'll be there for you

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
My best friend say, I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, any time I like
My best friend say, don't let you ruin my life
Cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend say
If she was me she would let you go long, long time ago
My best friend say, my best friend say

[Chorus: Missy Elliott & Aaliyah]
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need, you can lean on me
Come on, I'll be there for you
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need, you can lean on me
Come on, I'll be there for you

[Bridge: Both, Aaliyah]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey hey, yeah
I'll be there, yeah

[Chorus: Missy Elliott & Aaliyah]
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need, you can lean on me
Come on, I'll be there for you
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need, you can lean on me
Come on, I'll be there for you
