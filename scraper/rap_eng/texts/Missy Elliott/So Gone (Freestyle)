So gone over me?
Guess we see this differently
How bout we put it on the table?
Make your doubt the centerpiece

You blow up on me, kill the peace
And threaten to leave
Who the hell, is this tyrant?
Thought I wanted a king

Hon
You did nothing wrong
Just accused me of fraud
How dare you think, I've been sneakin'
When I gave you my all

I just about, poured my soul in you
I never left you bruised
Every facet of my life improved
When you were in the room

Ask my homies what to do
To prove to you I've been true
I'm throwing rocks, at your window
Cuz I've nothing to lose

You wanted proof?
You're my muse
Ain't no ruse with what I'm saying
I just wanted you to know
You inspire me daily, baby

I, know I'm never home
But I'm working on myself
I'm providing for our future
Trynna win us some wealth

I see you're wholly independent
But I'm willing to help
You can trust I'm committed
Got eyes for nobody else

I don't show my affection?
Here's a song for my lover
We feel ourselves falling deeper
The more we long for each other

We belong for each other
I'm simply stating the truth
I'm just hoping that my tunes
'gon get you in the proper mood

Cuz I'm Mackin on your lips
One day we'll be raising kids
It don't matter what I'm making
Cuz with you I'm living rich

I know it's hard, but my eyes are on the prize
Looking forward to the day you ask me bout my ring size
You're the diamond in my life
When it's looking too bronze
Boy, you'll be taken care of
When you're dating John

Don't say your love's left
Your heart's right
Your head's wrong
Boy, you're always in my heart
So never tell me that you're gone
