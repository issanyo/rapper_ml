[Chorus]
Baby Holler...If you want me
Baby Holler...If you hear me
Baby Holler...If you want me
Baby Holler...If you need me

It ain't no thing just call my name
I'll be right there coz nuthin's changed
I'm still in love with you I'm sprung
You're my baby-boo
Girl I'm tellin you
Girl you drive my train you rule
I'm your pet tell me what to do
Girl I'm good in my heart I'm real
Girl you turn me on with your sex appeal

[Chorus]
(All you gotta do is scream and holler babe)
(C'mon and call me, I'll be right there, Yes I will)

I'll be there cuz I'm your man
Sure to give you all I am
Give you all I got to give
Girl I'm feelin' you hope you feel me too
Have no limits, What I do
Is strictly for just pleasing you
No need to doubt please have no fear
Girl I'm wanting you and I'll be right here

[Chorus]
(All you gotta do is scream out my name, yes you do)
(All I gotta do is see you and I'll come running
