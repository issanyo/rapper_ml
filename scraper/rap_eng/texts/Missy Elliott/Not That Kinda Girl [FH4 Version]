[Verse 1: Normani]
You pull up in the car, so what it's a Benz?
Telling me you got money to spend
You wanna spend it on me, baby, please
You show up in the club, so what? You got bottles
Tryna talk shit like I'm gonna follow
Really? Really?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lauren & (Normani)]
I don't even know you
I don't know you like that at all
(I don't even know you), no
If you keep on staring
Imma show you what it's like to fall
(I think we got a problem)

[Chorus: Lauren + Ally & All]
Why you looking like I'm that kinda girl?
Just cause I'm hot don't mean that I'm that girl
If you want me, don't treat me like I'm her
Don't get fucked up, I'm not that kinda girl

[Verse 2: Dinah]
Boy, I wanna like you
But it's better if you just don't speak
Yeah, tryna tell you, but you don't get it
You wanna touch it, you'll regret it, you'll see, try me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ally]
I know what you're thinking
Wanna find out what my body's for, baby
I don't think you're ready, baby
Show me you got something more
Show me that there, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Lauren + Ally & All]
Why you looking like I'm that kinda girl?
Just cause I'm hot don't mean that I'm that girl
If you want me, don't treat me like I'm her
Don't get fucked up, I'm not that kinda girl
Why you looking like I'm that kinda girl?
Just cause I'm hot don't mean that I'm that girl
If you want me, don't treat me like I'm her
Don't get fucked up, I'm not that kinda girl

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
See, I'm not the kinda girl you can freak on the first date
I'm straight, that's right, I'll make ya wait
I look good, look great
Want my cake while he all up in my face
Mhm, he tryna get a taste
What you think, I'm a thot? Forget that
Boy, you been around the block? I ain't with that
If you wanna smash, why you talk trash?
Boy, you got it bad, you gets no ass
Boys, de boys, dey love me
Tell 'em ain't no freak, don't try to wife me
Tell 'em they no find no girl no like me
Not the kinda girl give up mi panties

[Chorus: Lauren + Ally & Dinah & All]
Why you looking, (why you looking?), like I'm that kinda girl?
Just cause I'm hot don't mean that I'm that girl
(I know you want me, baby, baby)
If you want me, don't treat me like I'm her
Don't get fucked up, I'm not that kinda girl
Why you looking like I'm that kinda girl?
Just cause I'm hot don't mean that I'm that girl
If you want me, don't treat me like I'm her
Don't get fucked up, I'm not that kinda girl
