When the tower tumbled
We began anew
Had no time for warning
Only déjà vu

It comes flashing back
Then just fades to black
All gone

All the land rejoices
Now the coast is clear
No more silent voices
To whisper in your year

I am in my element
With a panoramic view
There's no inspiration like
A military coup

Children blowing kisses
Strangers to the truth
Carrying the wishes
Of a bygone youth

Bye-bye cabaret
Sci-fi agony
All gone

All the land rejoices
Now the coast is clear
No more silent voices
To whisper in your ear

I am in my element
With a panoramic view
There's no compensation like
A military coup

A mellow melody
Rolling endlessly
How long?
How long?
How long?
