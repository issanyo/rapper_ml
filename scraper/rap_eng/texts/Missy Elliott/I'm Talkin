[Verse 1]
Nigga, what's up? You think you tough
I'm fly shit, has a bitch, dope as fuck
Sho nuff I'm guaranteed, no diggities
Fight you like the fucking enemies
You would think there's fucking ten of me
When I'm sending these blows, blows
Hoes want to roll like hydro
Wanna suck Timbaland's bone like you Fido
I go, scoop Lil' Kim, me, she, her, them and him
Gets high in The Tunnel
They see my Lexus comin, they hear the bass rumblin
They come quick, they come quick Å¯ike a dick
I make myself sick, I'm so motherfuckin bad to the bone
Like my titties are full blown

[Hook]
My style of rappin (my style)
I'm su-su-such a good rapper (I'm su-su-such a good rapper)
I give you good and plenty (yeah, yeah)
My style's the bomb diggy (my style)
My style of rappin (yeah)
Su-su-such a good rapper (I'm such a good rapper)
I give you good and plenty (uhmmm, mmm)
My style's the bomb diggy (brrr)

[Verse 2]
I'm calling your cards like Sprint
Can't be me, can't see me, I'm low like Timb
Ladies and gents, dogs, cats and babies
Whoever bit my style I hope you croak from the rabies
Swayze, maybe I call your name, ain't that a fucking shame
I'm too high for that, I'm great like the dane
Mane on main if you decide to put your hands
On my fucking light, like the ciggarettes I light
You must burn, you better learn from the pro
Who rock shows after shows, when it rains it pours
I hurt like the cold souls, my style polishes like nails and toes
You know

[Hook]
My style of rappin (it's such a good...)
I'm su-su-such a good rapper (I'm such a good rapper)
I give you good and plenty (I give)
My style's the bomb diggy (you know my style)
My style of rappin (I'm such...)
I'm su-su-such a good rapper (I'm such a good rapper)
I give you good and plenty (yeah, yeah)
My style's the bomb diggy (uhmmm)

[Verse 3]
You beg to be put on like cats
Nigga know who I am
Now you want to sing and dance
You want to shake your stanky ass
Well I'm sorry Sam, God damn
You ain't family, you hounding me
Pounding me with the same old story, you bore me
Lordy have mercy on all these groupies
Sorry cutie, why you go and shake your bootie?
'Cause there's only one Lil' Kim
The triple beam, the misdemean, nigga queen
Whoomp, we Tag Team
So hot we melt like ice cream
Without the dick riding
Dreams of smoking a California blunt
I got the lyrics to make you feel it
What you want nigga?

I'm talking about my style
(I am the flyest then RZA now)
I'm talking about my style
(Let me tell you about Missy's style)

[Hook]
My style of rappin (oh my)
I'm su-su-such a good rapper (su-su-such a good rapper)
I give you good and plenty (yeah, yeah)
My style's the bomb diggy (you know my style)
My style of rappin (I'm such...)
I'm su-su-such a good rapper (I'm such a good...)
I give you good and plenty (...good, good)
My style's the bomb diggy
