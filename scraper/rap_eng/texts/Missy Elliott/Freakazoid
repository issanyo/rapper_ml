[Missy Elliott]
Yeah
New Blaque
Uh
Ah!

[Shamari]
Promise baby
You won't make me cry
'Cause I know you like to flirt boy
But I'm no chick on the side
I got high expectations
I gotta be your number one
You can't call up the club midnight
Thinkin' you gon' get you some, yeah

[Blaque & Missy]
'Cause I'm not your Freakazoid
Your late night chick
I know I may look fast
But I'm innocent
You used to chicks blowin' it in your face
That might be them
With me that's not the case
