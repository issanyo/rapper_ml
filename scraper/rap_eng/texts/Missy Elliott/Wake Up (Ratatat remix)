[Missy Elliott]

Eh yo Hov, tell em, hip hop betta wake up

[Jay-Z]

Yeah, turn the muhfuckin music up
Yeah, turn the muhfuckin music up

[Verse 1 Missy Elliott]
Motherfuckers betta wake up, stop sellin crack to the blacks
Hope you bought a spare for your flat
Can't accept me talkin real facts
Down the hill like jill and jack, i speak what yah weak mind lacks
Yah heard that
I'm creative to the fullest what you talkin bout Willis cause your talkin Never kill it
I hear but don't feel it thou ain't realest
Yah just sweet meat in the in the village
Yeah im a down diva done niva
Ya'll not xena heat'll sqeeze into a wife beater
Yep im a top leader
I got the Martin Luther King fever, ima feed yah what yah teacher need to preach yah
Its time to get seious
Black people all areas who gon' carry us it ain't time to bury us
Cause music be our first love, say i do lets cherish it

[Chorus]
If you dont gotta gun (its alright)
If yah makin legal money, (its alright)
If you gotta keep yah clothes on, (its alright)
You ain't gotta cellular phone, (its alright)
And yah wheels dont spin, (its alright)
And you gotta wear them jeans again, (its alright)
Yeah if you tried oh well, (its alright)
MC's stop the beef lets sell, (its alright)

[Verse 2 Missy Elliott]
Hip hop betta wake up, the bed to make up
Some of ya'll be faker than a drag in make-up
Got issues to take up before we break up
Like Electra let go miss Anita Baker
I love Jacobs, but jewelry won't fix my place up
Gotta stay up, studio nice to cake up
Now check my flava, rich folks is now my neighbors
I got cable, and checkout hot imade my paper
Hip hop don't stop be my lifesaver
Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers
And like a elevator dj on a cross fader
Black people wake up or see yah ass lata

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 Jay-Z (Missy Elliott)]
I need rims that dont listen and a boomin system
First piece of change i see im gon' get one
7 45 no license to drive
I ain't even gotta home i gots to live in my ride, fuck it
(Rewind)
I can hear myself but i can't feel myself
I wanna feel myself like Tweet
7 45 no license to drive
I ain't even gotta home i gots to live in my ride, fuck it
Couple of karats in my ear won't hurt
Need a nice chain layin on this thousand $ shirt
Evisujeans cover the rectum i kick game just like david beckham
Anybody in my way i wet them
Ima be this way until the cops come catch em
To detective sketch em on the sidewalk wit chalk New Yorks infections
Till i got taught a lesson
Couple niggas gone couple in correction
Hillary got ten todd got fifteen nigga even my kin
Got 5 years bringin 19 in, i just think i used to think like them
Now they gotta live through the pictures that i send em in the pen
Hope you dont start yah life where i end

WAKE UP [x15]

[Chorus]
