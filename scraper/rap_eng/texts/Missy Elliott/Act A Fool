[Verse 1]
We don't stop till we done with it, done with it
We gon' come and have fun with it, fun with it
Tonight we goin' ghetto, whaaat!
Get a drink-drink in our cups
Go ahead let me see that donkey
Watch me I'ma show my monkey
Say we gon' turn that party down, we gon' turn that party down
Let me see all the ladies with the real hair
Let me see all the ladies with the fake hair
It don't matter if you're short or taller
Hands up if you're looking for a baller
Hands up if you're looking for a baller
Show your number payboy gonna call her
Cause You got that, and we want that
Dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat

[Chorus]
Tonight we find that, act a fool
Give up while I'm all on you
Like when you touch all my body
Like when you touch all my body (yeah!)

Well this one for my fellas in the whips
Drop top sounds system in the whips
For when ya down go turn it up
Boom, boom, boom let it thump in the truck
We gon get drunk till we bend out the slums
See the girls moving they lump diddy lumps
Pop that, pop that, we gone rock that
Mr. DJ, could you bring the hook back

[Chorus]
Tonight we find that, act a fool
Give up while I'm all on you
Like when you touch all my body
Like when you touch all my body
Come and dance with me tonight

Pull over, my ass to fat
Your bitch wanna be like me, too bad

We gon turn that party down
We gon turn that party down. (let's go!)
Tonight we gon turn the party down
Ladies squat down, turn around
We gon show you how to do the duck walk
Walk that walk, gon' talk that talk
Dusk till dark we gon let the blunt spark
Let the blunt spark till dusk till dark
We gon, we gon, light it up
We gon, we gon, light it up. (yes!)

[Chorus]
Tonight we find that, act a fool
Give up while I'm all on you
Like when you touch all my body
Like when you touch all my body
Come and dance with me tonight
Promise I got what you like
Like when you touch all my body
Bu, bu, bu, bu, bu body
