He must know how to do it right!
Take me places that I like
He can taste the CHERRY POP
Talkin bout my CHERRY POP

Yes

Old school to this baby
Holla
Come on, come on

I need a man
Who know how to talk
And know exactly my spot
And to show me whos the boss

Keep me satisfied
Til my wound is dry

Yess
And show me some good love

He must know how to do it right!
Take me places that I like
He can taste the CHERRY POP
Talkin bout my CHERRY POP
Must know how to turn me on
If he dont them leave me alone
Gotta taste my CHERRY POP
Gotta taste my CHERRY POP

Can you hear (can you hear me)
(dont you baby, dont you baby)
Can (you give me)
Something I can feel

I need a man
Who can lay it down
Who can turn me all around
Let me lift up off the ground
Not a lazy man
For someone to knock you out
And show me whats about
Gon bounce up out this spot

He must know how to do it right!
Take me places that I like
He can taste the CHERRY POP
Talkin bout my CHERRY POP
Must know how to turn me on
If he dont them leave me alone
Gotta taste my CHERRY POP

Gotta taste my CHERRY POP

Give me something I can feel
