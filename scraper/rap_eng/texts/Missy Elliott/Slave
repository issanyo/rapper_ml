[Intro]
I’ll be your slave…
I’ll be your slave…
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me
See, Tony’s nasty

[Verse 1]
I wish that I could have you
‘Cause all I wanna do is what you want me to
And you can do just what you feel
You know the deal…just keep it real
I’ll keep my hands to myself
And baby you can do the rest
I’ll be just what you want
Just put your tongue on my chest
I’ll be your slave…

[Chorus]
I’ll be your slave
You can whip my body if I misbehave
Climb under my sheets
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me
See, I’m so nasty
I’ll be your slave
You can whip my body if I misbehave
Climb under my sheets
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me
See, Tony’s nasty

[Verse 2]
I don’t know what I’m thinking of
We can call it sex or just making love
Girl, all I wanna do is please you
I’ll never skeeze you or leave you
So let’s get in the mood
I won’t touch you if it bothers you
So tie my hands behind my back
And do what you feel ‘cause it’s like that

[Chorus]
I’ll be your slave
You can whip my body if I misbehave
Climb under my sheets
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me
See, I’m so nasty
I’ll be your slave
You can whip my body if I misbehave
Climb under my sheets
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me
See, Tony’s nasty

[Bridge: DeVante Swing]
Come share my love, don’t be afraid
I’ll be your slave
My body’s yours, my heart, my soul
You’re in control

[Chorus]
I’ll be your slave
You can whip my body if I misbehave
Climb under my sheets
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me
See, I’m so nasty
I’ll be your slave
You can whip my body if I misbehave
Climb under my sheets
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me
See, Tony’s nasty

I’ll be your slave
You can whip my body if I misbehave
Climb under my sheets
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me
See, I’m so nasty
I’ll be your slave
You can whip my body if I misbehave
Climb under my sheets
Let’s get sticky, it’s OK to punish me…

DeVante, say it now…
