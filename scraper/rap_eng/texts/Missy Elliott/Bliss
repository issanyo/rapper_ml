[Verse 1]
I think in rap convulsions confusions confuse the blackouts
Rebirth the birth of fusion, goku merging on the back routes
Combining simple sayings into something super liminal
At minimal, I'm maximum but minimize the miniscule
Serious as cereal that's been dripped on by the milky way
My color is my complex so I just do as the milky say
The galaxies an eye away, a universal tidal wave
That floods the blood…
Hold on run it back, run it back
I can flip it way better than that
Hustle, hustle
A standing hieroglyphic prolific pictures and potent power
Hours devour the towers but foulers can't sour ours
Showers of the scours raining on the rough and rigid
Frigid liquid trip the timid too many tiptoe and tip off the tenants
Intended intentions intently tumble tenses
Manifest in the senses, what I stress leave em senseless
So I caress em a sentence, so they can rest in repentance
I focus less about about pendants and pen the pen through the penance
And penetrate...the pupils of the purpose driven populated
An offer of prosperity but only you can populate it
Introduce the introduction with an absolute conclusion
Interrupt ya dead production hit ya dome with life contusions
They been washed and rinsed and drenched in problematic solutions
Probably pinched off pollution, penthouse pent up poots uhh
What an illusion, what do you lose when
When you been abused and you been diffused
These imminent views is inventing a memory many will Minnie and Mickey it back
Numb to to weather I climb through the climate declining I never do worry bout that
Plan the assignment assigning to sign up my signature seen through the signs I done past
Moving too fast, no time to fast I'm fastly approaching a meal that'll last
Stay with the task I've attached to hand as I'm handed a pen I just bleed on the pad
Paid the cost but I was never tryna be the boss
Word of mouth stay clean like all I ever do is floss
But really I just calculate a better way to calculate
Thinking bout my thinking and my thoughts and is they straight
And if they not...should I take my focus off the top
I was dreaming prime rib maybe better off with slops
I just chop like sticks right role, wrong flick
Going off, light switch, dim skull, no bic
I'm just a lowly architect to the higher blueprint
The plan is in effect, foundation's heaven sent
A holy house to hose me off
With whole amounts of holy sauce
It smothers me like stroganoff
And broken things get broken off
This violence like violins the wrong string pulled
Another sad song, another bad tune
Tensions tight as sassoon's in crowded bar saloons
These goons reminiscent of some bad behaving baboons
Cash rules, refuse to be a victim to the tyrant
So when powers at the top, I find a way to undermine it
Complex thinker thinking that I'm really simple minded
Simplex syntax sentences the sense of it rewinded
In as far as I can see, the world is meant for me
A symphony that's sent for me, the sender's centerpiece
In ascent from the ill intent, intend to centipede
With these legs I will proceed, supercede and take the lead
But take heed, they praise you for ya body give it beads
Now you gotta want for nothin but you gotta want ya needs
A hurricane of twisters blur my name behind these pictures
A picture of clearer pictures depicted from drinking liquor
Afflictors sent to vindict us, Invictus from out the trenches
You sent us to serve a sentence, but since this we've written riches
If you can princess Kitana's then soup ya potatoes
You bring the spice to Poblanos then you can surely serve fuego
They grip ya eggos til you leave em waffled
Full throttle for my falafel
Toggle the Picasso, colossal art that I often fossil
Follow what come out of they mouth you will get swallowed
(Talk) talk is for the birds they in ya ear like Aladdin’s Iago
Bird brains tend to think the same that’s word to Zazu
When you destined for greatness, snakes will Orochimaru
Cut ya link to Hyrule, cause you been blessed with high rule
Ya highly hated haters hate to have t0 hamper toadstool
Told true, everything I told you, think back recall the total
Reclaim ya mind and you can let ya soul loose
So loose I don't think this juice you'll ever contain
A broken truce because I promise what I'm thinking’s unchained
I’m off the hinges but you act like open doors bore you
Getting heavy with my steps I'm feeling just like Tohru
Ain't use to flying so I figured I'd spit what a hawk spews
Flooring opposers with confusing kicks a fist from Hak Foo
Oooooooh
But when I powered down is when I powered up
What I lost I done found, power bout to erupt
Combine the construct, with the road map
Now ya building is vicious and you got the road mapped
If you can hold that, you'll never hold back
Digging deeper never show em where ya hole's at
I wasn't told that, but got my toll back
So run with hustle you can ya focus on the whole track
