Yeah, Imma set it off
C'mon now
This that hot shit ya'll set it off
New Monica shit
C'mon

[Verse 1: Monica]
You remember when I was just a young one (c'mon)
And I was to afraid to quickly let you show me thangs

[Interlude: Missy]
Hol up, hol up
Big show DJ's
This joint so crazy
Put the needle back on the record
Let's do a double take

[Rap Section: DirtBag]
Now listen baby im a dirt bag
I don't know the different faces, I can't take it
But I got a jeep, so you lead and I'll follow
Lunch up in a diner, if ya act right we dine in the Bahamas
Now wow lil momma, im a gangsta
Anywhere ya wanna go imma take ya
Oh my god you caught my eyes like from 20 yards
You so damn fine
Listen I don't eat peaches but the way you look to night
I just might take a bite
Come closer, feel that
It's a woman and a man and a latex
Out the shower, hotel flowers on the bed
Choice of wine white or red
What more can I say
Monica, DirtBag, ATL MIA

[Verse 1: Monica]
You remember when I was just a young one
And I was to afraid to quickly let you show me thangs
Not sure if I was ready for some good love
And I'm 'bout to set it off
Can you please be gental? 'Cause I am the fragile kind
And even tho im ready for the move of my time
Now buckle up yo seat while I set it off

[Chorus: Monica]
Baby let me set it off (let me)
Do you mind it I get it off?
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call
If you wanna get it on
Set it off (come on now), set it off

[Verse 2: Monica]
I know you're anxious
But please let's make a compromise
I'm so energized, all in my neck, my back, my thighs
Make sure the lock is safe before I set it off

[Chorus: Monica]
Baby let me set it off
Do you mind it I get it off?
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call
If you wanna get it on
Set it off, set it off

[Bridge]
Now I'ma get it , you can tell them Mo Said it
And you betta not forget it, now don't sweat it
And we can really go at it, if you let it let's protect it
Now I bet it be good is you ready
But the jump of heavy, my style varies
The club down I shut it, how I do it
I set it in me

[Chorus: Monica]
Baby let me set it off
Do you mind it I get it off?
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call
If you wanna get it on
Set it off, set it off

(Missy)
Breakdown
Here we go
(Monica)
I will set it off
I will set it off
I'll set it off
I will set it off
I'll set it
I'll set it
