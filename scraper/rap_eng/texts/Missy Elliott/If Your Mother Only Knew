[Beatbox 1]
If your mother only knew
If your mother only knew
If your mother only knew
That you was tryin’ to get with me
If your mother only knew
If your mother only knew
She’d probably throw
You out her home
You’d probably be up
On apartments all alone
If your mother only knew

[Interlude]
This is the tricky part
The beat and the chorus at the same time

[Beatbox 2]
If your mother only knew… knew
If your mother only knew… knew
If your mother only knew… knew
If your mother only knew… knew

[Interlude]
Y’all don’t think I’m doin’ that shit?
Y’all don’t think I’m doin’ that shit?!
You think it's some other shit going on?
I'm gonna slow it down
I'm gonna slow it down a little bit
So y'all can hear the pronunciation
On everything I'm saying, check it out

[Beatbox 3]
If your mother only knew
If your mother only knew
If your mother only knew…
