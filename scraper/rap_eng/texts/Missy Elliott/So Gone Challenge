[Verse]
There was a boy and girl that was fourteen years old
She had a broken heart but a pure soul
Filled with gold
So, he told he he's gonna sweep her off the dusty road
Lifting her off her feet, he starts walking out of the door
Then goes to the store
Purchasing two rellos
To roll up gas like a chemistry herbivore
She's feeling mellow
Lays her on the bed, with open legs, but please be gentle
Because this explicit content isn't for the parental
But as he goes in deeper, he seduces her cerebral
Now her ex man looking like the ex hero
From heroes
So hiro, went back to the future to heal all her sorrows
Tomorrow
Cause yesterday ain't coming back
Even if we ask for a borrow
She says you make my body and soul feel so fuego
I said its only because of the sause from TheGuyOh
But just know, you ain't gonna meet another one that's like P.E.C.O
(Whoa.)
