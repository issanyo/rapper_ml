[Hook: Lamb]
I'mma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dining room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better

[Verse 1: Missy]
He say I'm hot, I'm so fuego
Pull up on him in my vehicle
He say I'm pretty, I'm pretty

Roll up on him in my Lambo
Jump out like skrrrt, yeah bro

[Bridge: Missy]

Pop potential in my room and zoom in the poom
He watching my body like he watching Scandal
But I'm just here, with my girls

[Hook: Lamb]

[Verse 3: Missy]
Brand new flow when I rap
DJ, bring that back
You ain't ever heard a track like that
Shit might slap, booty go clap
Roll up in the Benz
Looking like a ten, stack
When I rock, make it bop, in my car
And it bang-bang-bang like (tune-out noise) go blap-blap-blap

[Bridge 3: Missy]
Yeah he got bands in the Bando

Pop potential and zoom in the poom
