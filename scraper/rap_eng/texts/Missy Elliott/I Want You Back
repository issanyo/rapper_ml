[Verse 1: Mel B]
Boy, I'm sick of you
Who me? Yes me, yeah, you know I'm a fool, fool
I'm a fool for you
Cause I keep taking you back
As though I'm stupid like that
Yeah yeah, you know its true
But I can't say no and I never say no
I can't say no to you, because you treat me right
And that's why I want you back, uh

[Chorus: Mel B]
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn I think I want you back
Want you
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn I think I want you
Want you back

[Verse 2: Mel B]
Boy I'm tired of you
Running over me, telling me what to do
Now what have I done to you
To make your sex a lie
I thought I made you hot
Now don't make me act a fool
I know I talk mad junk
But I know what I want
What I truly want is you
And even though you're a man, true dat
I want you back, uh

[Chorus: Mel B]
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn I think I want you back
Want you
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn I think I want you
Want you back

[Bridge: Mel B]
You got me losing my mind, my mind
You can't keep breaking my heart
You got me drinking the liquor in the morning
Sitting all night at the bar

[Chorus: Mel B]
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn I think I want you back
Want you
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn I think I want you
Want you back

[Chorus: Mel B]
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn I think I want you back
Want you
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn I think I want you
Want you back
