I won't stay another minute
You and me boy now we're finished
Gave my love but now I want it back

You were the cause of so much sorrow
But you gon' be sad tomorrow
Gave my love but boy I want it back

Baby I am so over you
And it ain't take long to find somebody new
He's everything you wasn't but he's everything I wanted
And I know he'd never treat me like you do

It's funny when I think about the past
When I was so naive to think that things would last
But now that I can see that you were never good for me
And it's over so you can't get my luv back
Help somebody

Give me my luv back, luv back, my luv back, luv back
You think I'm staying but I won't
Just give me my luv back, luv back, my luv back, luv back
You think I love you but I don't
Help somebody

Baby I'm so over you
And it ain't take long to find somebody new
He's everything I wanted and he's everything you wasn't
And I know he'd never treat me like you do

It's funny when I think about the past
How I was so naive to think that things would last
But now that I can see that you were never good for me
It's over so you can't get my luv back
Help somebody

Give me my luv back, luv back, my luv back, luv back
You think I'm staying but I won't
Just give me my luv back, luv back, my luv back, luv back
You think I love you but I don't
Help somebody

You can't have another thing boy
What you say I heard and seen
I hope you had your fun 'cause I'm done
Gave my love but I want it back, I want it back, I want it back

And you had your chance but I'm over that
And boy you took too long
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Let's go!

Give me my luv back, luv back, my luv back, luv back
You think I'm staying but I won't
Just give me my luv back, luv back, my luv back, luv back
You think I love you but I don't
Help somebody

I won't stay another minute
You and me boy now we're finished
Gave my love but now I want it back

You were the cause of so much sorrow
But you gon' be sad tomorrow
Gave my love but boy I want it back
Help somebody
