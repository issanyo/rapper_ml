[Verse 1]
It’s a shame you ain’t wanted when you had it, hey
Gave my love and you took the shit for granted, hey
And it was me those nights that you didn’t come home
Crying to my momma, blowing up your phone
Just wait a little while, baby, you gon’ see
That this gon’ hurt you more than it hurt me

[Chorus]
One thing that I know for sure
Is you gon’ miss me when I go
And it’s gon’ hurt, babe
When you’re all alone
I guess it’s true what people say
You never know what you have until it’s gone

[Verse 2]
You can never say I didn’t try, hey
Gave my all but I couldn’t make you fight, hey
And it was me those nights that you didn’t come home
Crying to my momma, blowing up your phone
Just wait a little while, baby, you gon’ see
That this gon’ hurt you more than it hurt me

[Chorus]
One thing that I know for sure
Is you gon’ miss me when I go
And it’s gon’ hurt, babe
When you’re all alone
I guess it’s true what people say
You never know what you have, until it’s gone

[Bridge]
And I can’t say enough that it’s gon’ be me you’ll miss, no
And I can’t say enough that it ain’t gon’ get no better than this
I’m tryna make you realize
I cried and I cried so many times
But one thing I know, it’s gon’ hurt when you go
But one thing that I know babe

[Chorus]
One thing that I know for sure
Is you gon’ miss me when I go
And it’s gon’ hurt, babe
You’re all alone
I guess it’s true what people say
You never know
I guess it’s true what people say
You never know what you have until it’s gone
Gone, gone, I'm gone, I'm gone , I'm gone , I'm gone
