[Intro: Missy Elliott]
One, two, checka how we do, ha ha
One, two (ba-baby)
I'ma make it hot like fire... ka-boom!
I'ma make it hot like fire... ka-boom!

[Verse 1:]
You're hotter than a summer day in California
You got me melting like a sundae and I want ya
I know you've been waiting
You've been waiting a long time for me
But if you wait a little while longer
This is how it be

[Chorus:]
Oh it's gonna be, hot like fire
I'm gonna take you, take you higher
You can't resist
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

[Verse 2:]
You shouldn't rush it
Take our time
I'll let you know when I'm ready
If that's alright
I won't keep you, I won't keep you
I won't keep you holding on
But if you wait on me
I promise you it won't be long
Oh it's gonna be

[Chorus:]
Hot like fire (I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (You won't, no)
You can't resist (Oh no)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss
(I'm gonna make it)

[Chorus:]
Hot like fire (and I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (Don't you want me...)
You can't resist (No no no no no)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss
(Baby take your time)

[Bridge:]
Take your time, don't move too fast
(No no no)
Take your time
(There's no rushing me, no no no)
Take your time
(Whoa, take your time)
Take your time
(I'm gonna make it all good for you, baby)

[Chorus]
Hot like fire
(I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher
You can't resist
(When I taste your lips)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

[Outro: Timbaland]

C'mon, can you feel us? What?
C'mon, can you feel us?
