Ohhhhhhhh, ahhhhhh, yeah, mmmmmmmmmm

Verse One

Last night you didn't call me
I tossed and turned
I called you all night
I was concerned
I prayed in my bed
You was all right
I cried and I cried
I stayed up all night

Chorus

Why you have to leave me standing in the cold
Why'd you leave me, all alone
Why'd you leave me leave me leave me
Why you have to leave me standing in the cold
Why'd you leave me, all alone
Why'd you leave me leave me leave me

Verse Two

These days are hard times
For me
Cause I really miss you
I'm unhappy
Why won't you call me?
Where is your love now?
I can't forget
You're all I think of

Chorus

Why you have to leave me standing in the cold
Why'd you leave me, all alone
Why'd you leave me leave me leave me
Why you have to leave me standing in the cold
Why'd you leave me, all alone
Why'd you leave me leave me leave me
