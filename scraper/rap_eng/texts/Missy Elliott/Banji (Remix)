[Intro: Seyi Shay]
On your radar, on your radar
Watchin' me like I'm under your radar
America to Nigeria
If you want it, oh baby come get it
On your radar, on your radar
Watchin' me like I'm under your radar
America to Nigeria

[Verse]
I'm banji, I'm fancy
I'm so fine, I can't stand me (bam!)
You're just a nominee, baby, I'm a Grammy
I'm so hot, y'all better come fan me
Yo, chicks better listen, 'fore you think about dissin
I gotta crew of girls and we always on a mission (let's move!)
Booty come through the club poppin' and twistin'
We hittin' on the loose 'til the Jeffrey missin' (Jersey!)
Ow, call me a diva
If you got a girl, bet I can make him leave her
So bonita, body like a 2-lita
Me and my crew we'll slay and we'll lead ya (uh-huh)
Yes, up and down
Check me out, l-look up and down (oh!)
I run the war, I run this town
I ride in style, you ridin' greyhound
Uh, where did this chick come from?
Where did this, where did this bitch come from?
Actin' like she, she number one
Ow, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
Banji, banji, banji
Banji, banji, banji

[Verse: JayCube]
Listen
Your boy too banji
Know your boy steady run tings
Ooh, ooh champion, throwback
You know your boy steady winnin'
See
You can do like I can do
You can move like I can move
Put up your feet and touch the floor
Baby girl, gal come give me some more
Give me some more, aye
Put your hands up, in the air
Give me one time, do trick
Everyday we day celebrate
Everyday we day celebrate

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Ay, man, I'm so banji
Man, I'm so banji
B-A-N-J-I-I-I-I
(Where my banji babes at?)
Ay, man, I'm so banji
Man, I'm so banji
B-A-N-J-I-I-I
Ay, man, I'm so banji
Man, I'm so banji
B-A-N-J-I-I-I-I
(Where my banji girls at?)
Ay, man, I'm so banji
Man, I'm so

[Verse]
Get into the floor, get into this
Look at the face, it's just ovah-ness
Up in the booth is how I-I spit
Tell them haters pull up and sit
Ain't that the truth
Yep, I'm the bitch
We in the club, and we bumpin' to this (let's move!)
Banji babes, twistin' our wrists
The boys be on it when we twistin' our hips (break it down like)
Ow, look at that, look at that butt
Bugga boo, look at that mutt
Vodka tonic, toss it up
We not done, we can back that up
We not done, we can back that up
We not done, we can back that up
We not done, we can back that up
That up, that up
