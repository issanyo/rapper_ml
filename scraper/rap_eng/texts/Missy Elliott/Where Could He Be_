[Intro: Missy Elliot & Aaliyah]
I been around the world (Hey, yeah, hey)
And I still can't find my baby (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, ooo)
See I searched high and low (Ooo, mhmm)
And I still, still can't find my baby

[Verse 1: Aaliyah & Tweet]
I've been, I've been (ashamed)
It's a shame (shame, shame)
That I've searched the sky
High and low, still can't find my baby
Where could he? (where could he be?)
Where could he be? (where could he be?)
Let me walk the streets, through snow and sleet
Until I find my baby, baby

[Chorus: Tweet]
Been around the world and I-I-I
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say goodbye
Should I search this Earth 'til I die?
Or let it drive me craz-ay
Been around the world and I-I-I (Oh)

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
It's a crime (crime, crime)
When you take this poor heart of mine
Use it for a rug to walk on
Then you're gone (gone)
Been right out my life, the last time
I'm gonna find my baby, baby

[Chorus: Tweet & Aaliyah]
Been around the world and I-I-I (oh, I-I-I)
I can't find my baby (oooh)
Packed his clothes and didn't say goodbye
(He didn't say goodbye)
Should I search this Earth 'til I die?
(Until I die, die, die)
Or let it drive me craz-ay
Been around the world and I-I-I

[Bridge: Aaliyah, Tweet & Missy Elliot]
Why can't (why can't) you call me? (you call me)
Dial me (dial me)
Da-da-da da-da-da
Why can't (why can't) you call me? (you call me)
Dail me (dail me)
Yeah, yeah
I been around the world and I

[Chorus: Tweet & Aaliyah]
Been around the world and I-I-I
I can't find my baby (No, no, no)
Packed his clothes and didn't say goodbye
(He didn't say goodbye)
Should I search this Earth 'til I die?
(Until I die)
Or let it drive me craz-ay (woo-ooo)
Been around the world and I-I-I

Been around the world (been around, been around) and I-I-I
I can't find my baby (No, no)
Packed his clothes and didn't say goodbye
(He didn't say goodbye)
Should I search this Earth 'til I die?
(Until I die)
Or let it drive me crazy
Been around the world and I-I-I

[Outro: Tweet & Missy Elliot]
Might keep searchin' and searchin'
Oh, oh
Packed his clothes and didn't say goodbye
Should I search this Earth 'til I die?
