{Verse 1}:
Oh, give me just a minute, just a second
(I gotta get it off my chest)
Ain't no competition when you're in it
(Let you know that you're the best)
And if I never told you baby
(I really do appreciate it)
Keep on like you do and I'll always be true

{Pre-Chorus}:
Because no (no) no, no, no, (no one) ever made me feel
Like I could be dreaming cause you can't be real
(And it makes)
Makes me so happy
(Yes it makes)
Yes it makes me cry
And I know you're lookin' at me probably thinkin' why but

{Chorus}:
Oh, excuse me if me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
(One I've been hoping and waiting for)
Searched all around
(Searched all around)
There's nobody else (nobody else) in the world
Love me like you do

{Verse 2}:
I ain't never had another man that
(Give me what you give to me)
Got me in the kitchen fixin' dinner
(Make me wanna cook and clean)
And just to see smilin' at me
(Baby, you don't even have to ask me)
Don't care what the task be if it makes you happy

{Pre Chorus and Chorus}

Let me explain why I'm acting this why
You're all that I need
(So don't ever change)
Your, love, takes, me
(Higher)
Higher
(Higher)
Higher

{Ad-libbed Chorus 3x}
Oh, excuse me if me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
(One I've been hoping and waiting for)
Searched all around
(Searched all around)
There's nobody else (nobody else) in the world, world, world

Oh, excuse me if me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
(One I've been hoping and waiting for)
Searched all around
(Searched all around)
There's nobody, nobody, nobody baby (nobody else)

You gone have to excuse me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
(One I've been hoping and waiting for)
Searched all around
(Searched all around)
There's nobody else (nobody else) in the world, world, world
Baby nobody ever loved me like you do
And I'm so mighty, mighty glad about it baby
