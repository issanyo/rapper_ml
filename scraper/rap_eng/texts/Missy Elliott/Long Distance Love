It's so hard having a long distance love
It seems like
Well, it just seems like he's so far away
And when I call him and he doesn't answer
Well, it seems like the world won't turn
(Yeah, mmm)
I just wanna pick up the phone just to hear his voice
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I call him and let it ring and ring until he answers
Just to tell him how much I miss him
How much I can't stand being this far apart
(Ooh ooh, yeah)
But most of all, I wanna tell him
(Yeah yeah)
I can't picture being without him
(Yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yea)

Can't picture livin' my life without you man
Can't picture you not bein' around to hold my hand, yeah
Can't picture us sittin' on seperate sides of the land
I can't picture you bein' this far without me man, man
Can't picture you with no phone to call me babe
Can't picture you bein' five miles away, yeah
Can't picture goin' on another day
Even if it's just a phone call away

I tried long distance love, I called AT&T
I tried Bell Atlantic, Sprint
But none of them connects me to you
Yeah, ooh ooh, yeah

Can't picture you with another chick, boy I can't eat
Can't picture it in my mind, I can't sleep
Can't picture us never bein' more than two feet
Can't picture this love thing not meant to be, be
Can't picture you not drivin' in my neighborhood
Can't picture them hatin' on you cuz you too good, yeah
Can't picture me goin' on another day
Even though you're just a phone call away
