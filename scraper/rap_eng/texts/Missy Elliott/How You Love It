[Verse 1: Ester Dean] (x2)
How you doin'? How you get it in?
How you keep 'em comin'? Tell me how break 'em in
What's the secret? You keep 'em disciplined
Got them girls walkin' in the cold to get it in

[Pre-Hook: Ester Dean]
You the one I'm callin' up when I'm horny
If you got what they say, I want you to show me
Show me how you touch 'em, show me how you love 'em
How you love 'em, how you-how you love 'em

[Hook: Ester Dean]
How you love it, how you love it
How you love it, how you love it, how you love it, yeah
How you love it, how you love it
How you love it, how you love it, how you love it, yeah
Can you do it like this? Can you do it like that?
If you do it like this, then I do it right back
How you love it, how you love it
How you love it, how you love it, how you love it, yeah

[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
How you doi it? How you get it in?
Talkin' ain't gon' do it, I need more than gossipin'
Got you blushin', hit that, recommend me
A old school classic boy they followin' a trend

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
See me ride the whip, like a 6-4
Legs up in the air like a Lamborghini door
When I'm done with him, I take him back like a rental
Best that ever done you could check out my credential
Ester Dean and Miss Demean, we pop them things
Wanna know what I mean?
That means ching-a-ling, that mean green, that mean bling
Popped up on the scene with a gangster lean and a triple beam
And I'm fresh and clean like Irish Spring, How we Love It?, sing

[Hook]

[Outro: Ester Dean]
Can you do it like this? Can you do it like that?
If I do it like this, then I do it right back
How you love it, how you love it
How you love it, how you love it, how you love it, yeah
How you doin'? How you get it in?
How you keep 'em comin'? Tell me how break 'em in
