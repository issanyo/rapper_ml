[Verse 1: Kiesza]
You show me there's something more to us
Than the same old thing, no usual affair
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
Till you take me there, ooh babe

[Chorus: Kiesza]
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Boy you know you got that good shit, make me feel all mushy
When you touchin' on my tushie, Salt-N- Pepa, wanna push it
Make me wanna shoop, shoop, backseat of the coupe
I'ma show you what I do do,  when I'm singing in the booth
Take my top off like a roof, unf
Damn you be the mane, Jack Ü did this track, oh
Damn this shit gon' bang, be like before never
We just stepped up, we’re together
Got me hotter than a sweater when we freakin' under cover
My love forever ooh

[Chorus: Kiesza]
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Wait, wait, wait, wait
I'm so open, I'm callin' you, I'm the main chick, not the substitute
Not a cockatoo could do what I could do, ‘cause I roll up on you like Ma Dukes
Ain't it cute like whoop whoop, my nookies sweet like juicy fruits
Put your balls all in the hoop, and go on and on like Badu
Beautiful, that's handsome, bag of chips and then some
Remind me of my phantom, you totally fly like a mansion
Jack Ü, this track blow, like indo through the window
4-1-1 what's the info, I'm all in love with him yo

[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
You say I'm the shit, you say I look good
In every outfit, you say I look good
When I get up, you say I look good
Don't need no makeup, ooh

[Verse 1: Kiesza]
You show me there's something more to us
Than the same old thing, no usual affair
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
Till you take me there, ooh babe

[Chorus: Kiesza]
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love
