[Intro]
Someone needs to rap off, in, off the top
Yeah, yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
You're standing at the door
I'm falling to the floor
You look even better than you did before
I'm staring at my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been a while, but I couldn't forget you

[Pre-Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't wanna do

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

[Verse 2: Nelly Furtado]
We're sitting real close and I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand, but I lay back
'Cause you know this thing could spiral in the night
I've changed my mind, I'm ready for you this time

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't wanna do

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I'm looking for a guy like you who wan' get with me
So we can some kiss and you could be Brad Pitt
Uh huh, uh huh, yes sir
Got my tight jeans on, dancin' with my chest up
Do it like you wanna do it to me
Got my clothes so wet I can't breathe
Like a car throw them D's on me
And can rock to the beat, club close at three
I ain't tryna lead you on on
I'm tryna turn you ass out
C'mon get up on me baby
Like you bouncing on a couch
In the club the DJs rock this
This how we pop and drop it
T-t-turn it up!
Because I'm burning up!
(Let's go!)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you
