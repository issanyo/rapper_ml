[Intro]
Mmm
Wassup baby (yeah, I like that)
It's Jason
What's goin' on?

Come on
Come on, uh

We can make it out, boo
We can make it out, boo

Break it down
Check it

If you just stay close to me

(Chorus)
Stay with me
(that's right, baby) And you'll see that love is made for you
(love is made for you and me, baby)
And for me (know what I mean?)
Honestly (honestly)
I can't live without you, baby please
(check it out, y'all) Don't leave me

[Verse 1:]
What's so wrong with me?
Don't you long to be
In my arms, close to me (aw, baby)
Baby, can't you see
That this love was made
Made just for you and me
Baby, please stay

(Chorus)
Stay with me
And you'll see that love is made for you
And for me
Honestly
I can't live without you, baby please
Don't leave me

[Verse 2:]
Oh!
All I know
Is that I can not sleep at night
And I can't eat a bite (aw, baby)
It seems days and nights are oh so long
'Cause when you're gone
Everything is all wrong, baby

[Bridge]
It's not cool (and it's not cool)
When I'm at school
To hear the fellas talk about you, baby (baby)
'Cause if I wasn't there ('cause if I wasn't there)
(as if I didn't care)
(all I ask of you)
(is baby, won't you stay?)

(Chorus x2)
Stay with me (oh yeah, baby)
And you'll see that love is made for you
(listen to my heartbeat) And for me
(listen to my heartbeat) Honestly
I can't live without you, baby please
Don't leave

Stay with me
And you'll see that love is made for you
And for me
Honestly
I can't live without you, baby please
Don't leave me

Stay with me (oh!)

And for me

Honestly

(I'm down on my knees)
(I'm begging you, please) Don't leave me

(Chorus x2)
(baby stay) Stay with me
And you'll see that love is made for you
And for me
(oh no) Honestly
I can't live without you, baby please
Don't leave me

Stay with me
And you'll see that love is made for you
And for me
Honestly
I can't live without you, baby please
Don't leave me

Stay with me

And for me

Honestly

Don't leave me

Stay with me
