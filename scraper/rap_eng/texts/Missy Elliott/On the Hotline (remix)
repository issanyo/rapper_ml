To The Dimples In Ya Cheek To The Middle Of Yo G-String
Conversation Underneath The Sheets
You Know Me Red Bull Like A Energy I'mma Freak

[Spectacular:]
Baby Girl Say She Loves Phone Sex
Say The Sound Of My Deep Voice Make Her Wet
You Call Me 5 A.M. On The Dot
Now I'm Thinking Bout U With Panties No Top
Picture This U Say U Comin Over
Thirty Minutes Later U Was Parked In A Rover
Jumped Out The Car And I Met U At The Door
Three Seconds In The House And Ya Panties On The Floor
Kiss You In The Mouth Lay Ya Hands On My Cheeks
Straight Action On The Carpet Rug Burns On My Knees
Now You On The Phone Like 'Damn I Made A Mess'
Got My Hands In My Pants
Man I Love Phone Sex

[Hook & Chorus]
