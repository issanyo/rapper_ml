She's a freak and I'm a chief head banger with the top down low on the flow cause your so fresh (fresh!) like b-boys with vests like runners carve chests
Hehehehe

There's truth, I go, there's a rhyme, I will tell it, a story, I'll defend it
Missy come in and I landed! Hell where did she come from?
This international goddess sun so get your hands up like this hun
Until the party's just begun! So come over to my house and that's where this song's from a less for the laugh from west coast breeze Portuguese diva! And Missy's the woman who always be cooking, says something for Neltado who come dip her vibin' from DC to T.Dot and all around the world come giddy up giddy up back back up to my girl!
