[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Uh, uh, oh

[Verse: Beyoncé]
The day you pissed me off
I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin'
And I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me
If I needed a friend
He took me to his house
And then he invited me in
Then we sat on the couch
He put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin'
And then he grabbed my face
He kissed me like a guy could never kiss a girl before
So you know what happened
Baby, I need to say no more

[Chorus 1:]
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean
What you feel about that, baby?

[Chorus 2:]
I'm just guessing
That you're through with me
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that?

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Remember the time you wondered
Where your money went?
I called my friends and bought some clothes
And took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a Jeep
And we talked all the time
He asked me about my man
And you know that I had to lie
He thought I had no man
And I was chillin' by myself
Don't get mad, 'cause I feel sad
That's why I must confess
Too many times I wanted to
Let you know my dirt
But everytime you said you loved me
I knew it would hurt

[Chorus 1:]
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean
What you feel about that, baby?

[Chorus 2:]
I'm just guessing
That you're through with me
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that?

[Bridge:]
I was mad, what was I to do?
Never had it in mind to play on you
But look at all the hurt you put me through
I can't tell a lie so I'm tellin' the truth
I was mad, what was I to do?
Never had it in mind to play on you
But look at all the hurt you put me through
I can't tell a lie so I'm tellin' the truth
I was mad, what was I to do?
Never had it in mind to play on you
But look at all the hurt you put me through
I can't tell a lie so I'm tellin' the truth
I was mad, what was I to do?
Never had it in mind to play on you
But look at all the hurt you put me through
You know, you know

[Chorus 1:]
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean
What you feel about that, baby?

[Chorus 2:]
I'm just guessing
That you're through with me
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that?

[Spoken: Missy]
Confess
Come clean, boo
Yo, what you feel about that?
What you feel about-, uh
What you feel about that?
Confessing, baby
Misdemeanor, Destiny, uh uh

[Outro/Chorus 2:]
I'm just guessing
That you're through with me
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me?
