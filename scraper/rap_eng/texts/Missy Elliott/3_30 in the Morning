[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Tell me why you trippin', out on me, mm
Everytime I wanna hang out
You get mad at me
Why can't I do the things, that I like to do, mmm
Why can't you put your trust in me
Like I put my trust in you
Even if I'm...

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Even if I'm out 'til 3:30 in the morning
I won't talk to no one, I'ma tell 'em about my honey
Even if the guys try to tip me with their money
I'ma let 'em know I'm dedicated to my honey

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Why you wanna argue with me, all the time?
Even when I'm out with my girls
You be on my mind
Why can't you sit down
And understand
That no matter where I be, or where I am
I let them know that you're my man, you're my man

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Even if I'm out 'til 3:30 in the morning
I won't talk to no one, I'ma tell 'em about my honey
Even if the guys try to tip me with their money
I'ma let 'em know I'm dedicated to my honey

[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
No one but you
I'll be coming home to you
No one but you
Even if it's after two

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Even if I'm out 'til 3:30 in the morning
I won't talk to no one, I'ma tell 'em about my honey
Even if the guys try to tip me with their money
I'ma let 'em know I'm dedicated to my honey
