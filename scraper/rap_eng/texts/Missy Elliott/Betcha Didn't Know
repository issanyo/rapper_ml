Dr. Seuss
Dr. Seuss

[Chorus:]
Ooh
I got a crush on you
I betcha didn't know
Ooh, I got a crush on you

Yesterday at school
I saw you as you passed me by
And all your girls
They were calling you names
But I still think you're fly

[Verse 1]
Baby, I wanna do it like you
But it must be the things you do
'Cause I'm too young to fall in love

Yo, I can't get you off of my mind
I think about you all the time
Been keeping it a secret
But I've got a crush on you

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2:]
The way you spell your pretty name
Is so different from the rest
You know it's you that I want impress
Gonna get an A on my test and do my very best

[Repeat Verse 1:]

[Repeat Chorus 4x]

[Bridge:]
I thought about telling my mother
But I don't think she'd like that too much
So instead
I think I'll just write you a letter

[Missy Elliott:]
Top, top
On the shock
On the spot
Raven loves six
So here comes the doc

Well, lil' Raven
Come and get your shovel
And dig this
We top the Seuss kick

Never fell in love with Tamika
Through it was my teacher
Too much for me to lead up to
They used to tell me
You'll be Seuss when you're older

If you take the time and be patient
When you're all grown up
You can find love and take it

'Cause I'm cute
Leave the Seuss
I'm too old for you
But I can dig it for the crew

We can go cruising on my jet
We can play ninjas on three
Off for some popcorn and some ice cream
And I can be your little ice cream dreams

[Repeat Chorus:]
