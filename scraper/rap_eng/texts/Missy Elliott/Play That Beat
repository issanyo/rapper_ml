To the beat y'all, play that beat (5x)
(This is a Missy Elliott exclusive)

[1st Verse]
When you wanna go around the world (I'm ready)
And if you want me to fight your ex-girl for you (I'm ready 2x)
If you need me to cook you meals (I'm ready)
And if you want me to come and chill with you boy (Suga' I'm ready)

[Chorus]
You don't know how you got me
I've never been in so, but not me
I was always told not to be
Givin' up the [cat] easy

Something you do reminds me
Friends be tryin' to stop me
They can't believe you got me
Givin' up the [cat] easy

[2nd Verse]
When you need a backrub from working all day (I'm ready)
Uh when you need a chick to come over right away (I'm ready) (Like this)
When you need me to wash your clothes boy (I'm ready)
When you need me on the phone to curse out the hoes (Suga' I'm ready)

[Chorus]

Boy there ain't none quite like you
Ask me and I'll always do
Cuz' I got this thing for you
You know what a little [cat] can do
[Repeat]

[Chorus]

I'm ready when your baby momma trips
So just call me come in doin' backwards flips
My darling
Would you like me bust her lips
Cuz' I'm ready, show you I'm the realest chick
And I love you
I'll do what you want me to do
I said I love you
For you I'm more than a crew
I'm Mrs. Do-right
Can't go wrong with me
I said R-E-D-Y
Always on time
Uh, come on
