[Intro]
Girls, I'ma bout to hit me through some game
Here we go now

[Chorus]
If you wanna know the way I'll show ya
Gather round girls listen closer
Know about football, basketball too
Know all the players, know all the rules
If you gotta know the way I'll show ya
Pay attention, you need to know how to
Cook up a meal, learn a new move
The way to his heart is sports, sex and food, food, food
You need to know about it

[Verse 2]
There's a misconception ya'll
Girls you thinking too hard
You at the club shaking it all night
Wondering why you can't find Mr. right
Wrong, wrong wrong
Girl you are wrong, wrong, wrong
It's gotta be you don't know
All the places you can go
Going to the gym, you ain't gotta be slim
Just strut your stuff and you'll attract him

[Chorus]
If you wanna know the way I'll show ya
Gather round girls listen closer
Know about football, basketball too
Know all the players, know all the rules
If you gotta know the way I'll show ya
Pay attention, you need to know how to
Cook up a meal, learn a new move
The way to his heart is sports, sex and food, food, food
If you wanna keep him, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ain't no hair ever kept a man (nope)
Girl go on and switch all your plans, plans
Contrary to what you believe (what you believe girl)
The raps in your palm and tear them jeans
And that's true, true, true
Baby that's true, true, true
You ain't gotta take my word
But I promise you will get him if you do, do, do
Get him if you do, do, do

[Chorus]
If you wanna know the way I'll show ya
Gather round girls listen closer
Know about football, basketball too
Know all the players, know all the rules
If you wanna know the way I'll show ya
Pay attention, you need to know how to
Cook up a meal, learn a new move
The way to his heart is sports, sex and food, food, food

[Outro]
Now girls, I said all I can say
It's up to you
Know about football, basketball too
Know all the players, know all the rules
Cook up a meal, learn a new move
The way to his heart is sports
Listen close now
Know about football, basketball too
Know all the players know all the rules
Hook up a meal, learn a new move
The way to his heart is sports, sex and food, food, food
You need to know about it
Food, food, food
