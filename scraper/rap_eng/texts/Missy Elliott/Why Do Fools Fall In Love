[Gina]
Oooh, why
Oooh, why (x2)
Why do fools fall in love

[Mocha]
Uh yo, you wanna be the one I call on, right
You wanna be the one to tell me it's alright
Well yall cats is all alike
Let me say this here
This year
'Bout dismiss here
This clear
Won't drip tears
But you can kick the wrist wear
In fact, he gon leave if he don't kick his share
And you gonna get  (no) where at school
Who, I ain't there
What you do, is choose to, disappear

[Gina - Verse One]
My man, he has game
He gave me things
And he bought me years (ooh ooh)
He let me drive his wheels
And so I trusted him, I trusted him
All above
Why do fools fall in love

[Chorus]
Why, does the rain, fall from above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in lo-ve (tell me why)
(repeat x2)

[Gina - Verse Two]
My man, he turned me out
And that's no doubt
He got the keys to my heart
I wonder if he loves me
Well, then he told me so
He said that he won't let me go
But I still don't know
Why do fools fall in love

[Repeat Chorus]

[Gina - Bridge]
Love is a losing game (love is a game)
Love can't be full of shame
I know, I'ma fool you see
Because that fool was me, tell me why
Why (ooh)
Why (oooh)
Tell me why (somebody tell me why)
Why do fools fall in love

[Mocha]
You wanna be the one I call on, right
You wanna be the one to tell me it's alright
(repeat x10)
