Part 1: Smash Up The Place

[Intro: Missy Elliott]
This is a world premiere
New Sharaya shit baby, huh
Ahh, let's go

[Verse]
Riggity, row, bliggity, blaow
I [shoot] like a shotgun
My stiggity style is wiggity wild
I bows down to no one
I biggity bang, y'all biggity bank
I'm Hulk, like the Hogan
The biggity best, so yiggity yes
I bust em like a trojan
Wrist stay frozen, I get them iggity open
You triggity try me, you get your liggity legs broken
And don't I look pretty, don't mistake me for a joke and
I liggity light that ass up like a bliggity blunt, then smoke em

[Chorus (x2)]
Run to the floor, we smashin' up the place
Run to the floor cause we smashin' up the place
You don't really wanna come smilin' in my face
Nigga, you don't really wanna come smilin' in my face

[Verse]
My headphone's connected to my microphone
My microphone's connected to my headphone
My pretty silk skin, call me riggity red bone
And I riggity wrote my gossip, okay, hi-de-ho
Jiggity jab a dude, make me laugh my funny bone
I riggity rock, I riggity rock, I go be on my own
Look at me I'm hot, you just lukewarm
Y'all bitches take a seat upon the futon
Miggity microphone checker, in the club steppa
When I drop this, you gon' have to make a better record
Battle me, never, no way heifer
Bitch, push it like Salt-N-Pepa, whatever

[Chorus (Missy Elliott)]
Run to the floor, we smashin' up the place, (this is crazy people)
Run to the floor cause we smashin' up the place, (c'mon)
You don't really wanna come smilin' in my face
Nigga, you don't really wanna come smilin' in my face (WOOH)
Run to the floor, we smashin' up the place
Run to the floor, we smashin' up the place, (uh huh)
You don't really wanna come smilin' in my face
Nigga, you don't really wanna come smilin' in my face

(Switch the beat)

[Verse (Missy Elliott)]
Damn I look good, I'm a cutie
Chicks mad at me, cause they man wants some booty
I'm a Banji babe, I don't talk to no groupies
Damn my pants tight, they fit to my coochie
Yes it's me, double g, that's Gucci
Gold chain hangin' round my neck, that's dookie
Everything Louis from the bag, to the shoe-y
Muy bien, very good, that's boujie (let's go)
Let's go

[Chorus (x2)]
Run to the floor, we smashin' up the place
Run to the floor, we smashin' up the place
You don't really wanna come smilin' in my face
Nigga, you don't really wanna come smilin' in my face

[Outro: Missy Elliott]
I told y'all this shit was go'n be crazy
Uh huh

Part 2: Snatch Yo Wigs

[Intro: Bell Biv Devoe and [???]]
That girl, that girl is (repeat x8)

She movin' her waist, got turnt up when I step in the place
I came to party, you came to hate
If you came to hate, why you all in my face
That girl is one in a million, say my name when I step in the buildin'
Hands up, everybody turn up
Banji bands to the front, tear the club up

[Verse]
I'm the hottest bitch here cause I'm poison
Bartender you can keep on pourin'
Milkshake to the yard, bring the boys in
I'ma show you how to ride it just like a horseman
My flows be tight in the corset
Drop the beat and make ya nigga sing the chorus

[Chorus 1: Bell Biv Devoe]
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is
Girl I must
(Break it down)

[Verse]
I'm a hot chick here, I'm poison
Yeah them other chicks, they borin'
Milkshake to the yard, bring the boys in
I'ma show y'all how to ride the [dick] like a horseman
Big butt, nice tits
Fresh cut, I got the fresh kicks
And my blue hair go'n match the lipstick
This bitch right here is poisonous, it go

[Break]
Drop it low, take it to the ground
Drop it low, grab that girl, grab that hoe
Pop it fast, nigga pop it slow
Nigga, y'all don't know
Banji chick with the brand new trick, will do a split
See the new shit, whine my wrists and my hips
Do it like this, time to snatch yo wig, uh

[Chorus 2 (Missy Elliott or Bell Biv Devoe)]
(This the ladies anthem, uh)
Time to snatch yo wigs, oh

Time to snatch yo wigs
(That girl is)
(Snatch yo wigs) (repeat 3x)
Time to snatch yo wigs
(That girl is)

[Verse]
I'm the hottest bitch here cause I'm poison
Bartender you can keep on pourin'
Milkshake to the yard, bring the boys in
I'ma show you how to ride it just like a horseman
My flows be tight in the corset
Drop the beat and make ya nigga sing the chorus

[Chorus 1: Bell Biv Devoe]
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is
Girl I must
(Break it down)
