The world is so cold
Why did you leave me standing there?
Alone with my shadow
Looking for your presence but it's not there


The world is so cold
Why did you leave me standing there?
Alone with my shadow
Looking for your presence but it's not there


One thing's on my mind
The thought is having you
To have you next to me
Thats where you want to be, baby


You're a diamond, you're my world
Tell me where did you go, baby
How could you leave that night
And leave me all alone?
Already the world is so cold


The world is so cold
Why did you leave me standing there?
Alone with my shadow
Looking for your presence but it's not there


The world is so cold
Why did you leave me standing there?
Alone with my shadow
Looking for your presence but it's not there


I'm lost and all alone, no doubt I'm miserable
Got much good love to give
Alone's no way to live, baby
You made me feel so whole


And now I've broke apart
I can't believe you're gone, baby
It tore apart my heart
The world is so cold, baby


The world is so cold
Why did you leave me standing there?
Alone with my shadow
Looking for your presence but it's not there


The world is so cold
Why did you leave me standing there?
Alone with my shadow
Looking for your presence but it's not there


The world is so cold
Why did you leave me standing there?
Alone with my shadow
Looking for your presence but it's not there


The world is so cold
Why did you leave me standing there?
Alone with my shadow
Looking for your presence


The world is so cold
I miss you
The world is so cold
I love you
Baby, I don't understand why?
What I've ever done to you?
Yeah
Look down
Yeah
Yeah
