[Chorus]
If your man only knew how you're feeling
I'd see right through you, oh oh
If your man only knew that you still love me
I'd known you love me

[Verse 1]
I see you're still be wearing that necklace I'd gave you
With that hidden note, saying "forever yours"
I love you, fell in love in the summer
A kiss in the water, 2004, and never let you go

[Chorus]
If your man only knew how you're feeling
I'd see right through you, oh oh
If your man only knew that you still love me
I'd known you love me, oh yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
There is no endless summer, we knew all along
That, when the winter came, you had to go away, but
You were my first and, I was your first
And that never goes away, first cut the deepest, babe

[Chorus]
If your man only knew how you're feeling
I'd see right through you, oh oh
If your man only knew that you still love me
I'd known you love me, oh oh

[Bridge]
I saw you on the street today
With that guy you pretend to crave
Faked smiles and I wished you well
Picked up my heart then walked away again
And that never goes away, first cut the deepest, babe
I always feel the same, feel the same

[Outro]
I see you still be wearing that necklace I gave you
I know what it's saying
If your man only knew how you're feeling
I'd see right through you, oh oh
If your man only knew that you still love me
I'd known you love me, oh yeah
You still love me, I know you love me
