[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Ayo, Katy! Let’s hit them with the remix, baby
Aw, let’s go!

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
It’s a Friday, night now here we go
I ain’t no stripper, but I work the pole
Bartender can you pour some mo'?
And I’m so tipsy, coming out my clothes
Fly high high high, and I can’t see so I can’t drive
I party 'til I’m out my mind
I kiss on him but he don’t mind
Then I wake up in the morn
I got a guy in my bed, like, "Hello, good morn."
Don’t remember how I got him home
But Friday night it was nice and long

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh woah

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh woah

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again

[Interlude: Missy Elliott]
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
(Let’s do this shit like every weekend)
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
(Now pour my drink, 'til there ain’t nothing left)
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh woah

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again
