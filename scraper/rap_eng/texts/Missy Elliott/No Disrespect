Don't never disrespect me

And now you be working with some new shit
I'll be the mother of your baby
If you put me down I can handle it (Uh-huh)
Cause I'm not like those other ladies (Uh)
None of them hoes you be fucking with

I'm not your freak
I'm not your trick

High quality
I'm tired of you disrespecting me
