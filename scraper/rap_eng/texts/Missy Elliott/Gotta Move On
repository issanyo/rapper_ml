[Intro]
Holla, new Monica shit
Yes, oh baby, yep

[Verse 1]
I been feeling something (something)
You been treating me cold
You no longer wanna touch me
The love has turned cold
And I don't feel special
The feeling I need to feel
In my gut I'm feeling something
Another woman, keep it real (c'mon)

[Chorus]
I, I had to go move on (had to go move on)
'Cause you're not worthy of my love
And all we did was fight and fuss (fight and fuss)
And she would, she would call your phone
And you would act like I was wrong
For cursing you all night long

[Verse 2]
Now to you if zip means nada
So don't call, don't page, don't follow
And you can see me in the club, don't holla
And if you see me looking good, don't bother
I know you hate to see me with my baby father
On the level as me, dun dada
Your loss, but you gon' have to swallow
I do bad by myself, stop proper, stop proper

Now the last few months been different
'Cause you don't seem bad with time
You say you wanna stay with me
Did you go and change your mind?
You getting phone calls after midnight
It's not exceptable
It don't take a scientist for me to know
Another chick is on the low

[Chorus]
I,(I,I) I had to go move on (gotta move on)
'Cause you're not worthy (not worthy, not worthy)
Of my love and all we did was fight and fuss
And she would, (she would) she would call your phone
(She would call your phone)
And you would act like I was wrong
For cursing you all night long

[Bridge]
You're so unfair (so unfair)
If you cared (if you cared)
You wouldn't play games like this
With me, so unfair (so unfair)
If you cared (if you cared)
(You wouldn't do, oh)

[Chorus]
I, I had to go move on (gotta move, gotta move on)
'Cause you're not worthy of my love
And all we did was fight and fuss
(you're not, you're not, you're not, no, no)
And she would, (she would) she would call your phone
(Call your phone, baby)
And you would act like I was wrong
For cursing you all night long

[Outro]
I can't stand for you to lie (2006)
She is in your eyes
(new Monica, baby)
Oh (this is serious, man), oh
