[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
Ladies!
Now if your dude ain't acting right
You tell that dude (He got to go)
If that dude be claiming that he broke
You tell that dude (He got to go)
If he wants you to stay in the house everyday and night
Tell him (He got to go)
If he wants to run the streets, then you run the streets, too
And you tell him (He got to go)

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger & The Pussycat Dolls, (Missy Elliott)]
Baby, baby

And now you in the house thinking 'bout me
And now I do what you do to me
And now I love to see you, baby
