Damn homey, in high school you was the man homey
What happened to you, you was my tenderoni
Now the lies you spit is full of baloney
So there's no need to push up on me
You say my love is your one and only
And to your game you can't fool a phony
Pullin' out your wallet like your spending money
You's a gangsta...

Said you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
Said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
Go to the dealership but you never cop nothin'
Been hustlin' a long time

I don't believe in vendettas
I Just wanted somethin' better
Sippin' on Amoretta
Get no sex, I just met him
I don't want for his cheddar
Although chicks always sweat him
'Cause he sport Gucci sweaters
If he broke I'll just debt him
You lookin' good homey
But that don't mean you can put one on me
I remember what my mama told
Just cause say you love me can you support me?
You's a gangsta...

Said you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
Said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
Go to the dealership but you never cop nothin'
Been hustlin' a long time

Listen, baby
You ain't gotta fake hard to impress me
'Cause I done seen alot of so called gangstas
And let me tell you somethin', that don't impress me
You gotta do more than an average man
And from what I seen, I don't think ya can
You wanna be a gangsta, but ya just a wanksta, oh!

Said you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
Said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
Go to the dealership but you never cop nothin'
Been hustlin' a long time

Yeah...
