The party is ending at 2 am, so whatever you must do, do it now

Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here, (this is)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here (a Missy exclusive)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
See my money maker, do my money maker (crazy baby)
See my money maker, do my money maker (serious man)

(Reversed) (let's go)
M-I-S-E
Missy be a freak
Sex so good, I can freak you in my sleep
Ice on my sleeve, I can make a room freeze
Pockets more bigger than a stripper booty cheeks
Dudes don't speak when they look at my physique
French on my feet, cost about fifty
I don't swing from a pole, Missy swing from a tree
I'm Ahamed Ali, 'cause I can sting like a bee
Whatchu know about that
So cute and fat
Let him hit it once, and watch the dude come back
'Cause the back so stacked, it's like sittin' on a jack
Missy be a mack nigga, that's a true fact

Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Thirsty, baby, bring it over here
Thirsty, baby, bring it over here (whatchu know about that)
See my money maker, do my money maker
See my money maker, do my money maker

(Reversed)(I like this)
Big things pop, little things stop
If you talk a lot in your mouth you get socked
Miss don't flop, 'cause I'm a get the props (come on)
House on the water, Aston Martin in the lot
Look at my watch, cost a whole lot
So iced out, you can't see it tick-tock
Yeah I'm so hot, and I can't be topped
Artist drop down like Michael Jackson socks
Got the game locked, make your body rock

If Missy ain't on it, then ya song don't knock
You might get mopped like a floor
So don't walk
You don't need to spit, unless you live what you talk (let's go)

Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Thirsty, baby, bring it over here
Thirsty, baby, bring it over here (whatchu know about that)
See my money maker, do my money maker
See my money maker, do my money maker (serious mannn)

(Reversed)
Missy switch it up, do ya damn thang
Just like a chain, groupies wanna hang
Talk that slang, gon' head and let it bang
Make the hair stand like the hair on Don King
Boom, boom, shing
I shine like bling, bling
Call me a queen, mean chicks stay in ya lane
My flow so mean, if you know what I mean
So fresh and clean, you can call me Irish Spring
Whatchu know about that
Shit, talk like exlax, if ya game wack
Then you ain't sayin' jack
Just like that ya ass'll get axed
'Cause I got more hits than you can get out of a bat

Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here (crazy)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here (new Missy)
See my money maker, do my money maker
See my money maker, do my money maker

(Reversed)
This is serious man
Soft hook
Whatchu know about that
Whatchu know about that
Whatchu know about that
Now whatchu know about that
