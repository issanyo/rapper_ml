[Intro: Timbaland]
Uh
I'mma make it hot like fire
We gon' make it hot like fire
We gon' make it hot like fire
Baby girl, what

[Verse 1: Aaliyah (Timbaland)]
You're hotter than a summer day in California
You got me meltin' like a sundae, I want ya
I know you've been waitin'
You've been waitin' a long time for me
(I've been waitin', I've been waitin', I've been waitin', what)
But if you wait a little while longer, this is how it'll be
Oh, it's gonna be

[Hook: Aaliyah]
Hot like fire (I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (No you won't)
You can't resist (When we)
Kiss kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss
Oh

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
You shouldn't rush it, take our time
I'll let you know when I'm ready, if that's alright
Said I won't keep you, I won't keep you, I won't keep you holdin' on
But if you wait on me, I promise you it won't be long
Oh, it's gonna be

[Hook: Aaliyah]
Hot like fire (I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (Higher, you won't)
You can't resist (Oh no, we)
Kiss kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss
I'm gonna make it

Hot like fire (and I will take you, baby)
Take you higher (no you won't resist, oh no no no)
You can't resist (When we, oh no no no
Oh no)
Kiss kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss

[Bridge: Timbaland]
We gon' make it hot like fire
We gon' make it hot like fire, baby
We gon' make it hot, ha-hot, hot, hot
We gon' make it like fire, fire, fire
Uh-huh

[Hook: Aaliyah, (Timbaland)]
Hot like fire (Like fire baby)
Take you higher (Take me higher, uh uh huh)
You can't resist (I can't resist, check it check it out)
Kiss kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss (and kiss and kiss)

Hot like fire (Say hot baby)
Take you higher (Like that like that uh huh)
You can't resist (What, uh huh)
Kiss kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss


[Outro: Missy (Aaliyah)]
Hot like fire (Woo!)
I'mma make it hot like fire (Woo woo!)
I'mma make it hot like fire (Woo!)
I'mma make it hot like fire (Woo woo!)
I'mma make it hot like fire (Woo!)
I'mma make it hot like fire (Woo woo!)

(Kiss and kiss and kiss)
