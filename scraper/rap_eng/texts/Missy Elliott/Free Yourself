[Verse 1]
Baby, you don't pay me no mind
You act like you don't love me no more
Maybe you need space or some time
Your attitude is unpredictable
And I don't want to make you unhappy
If you're not happy
Then you're free to go on
Cause I don't want you staying around
If I make you so miserable

[Chorus]
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(Go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me
Then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(Go ahead to someone else)
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(Go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me
Then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(Go ahead to someone else)

[Refrain]
Time again and again
I tried I tried
(Baby, don't you know I tried)
But the love I had inside has died
(But the love I had inside)

[Verse 2]
Won't you be a man if it's over
And just admit that things ain't the same
Instead of making me think it's all good between us
Which one's the blame
I took a lot of too much to handle
Until I can't take this game no more
This love thing is full of scandal
So you're welcome to walk

[Chorus]
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(Go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me
Then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(Go ahead to someone else)
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(Go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me
Then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(Go ahead to someone else)

[Refrain]
Time again and again
I tried I tried
Time and time again I tried it over and over and over and over
But the love I had inside has died
(Baby, don't you...)

[Bridge]
I had to take it there
I had to take it there
Because I'm tired, oh yeah

[Chorus]
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(Go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me
Then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(Go ahead to someone else)
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(Go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me
Then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(Go ahead to someone else)
You play games if you don't want me
Don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Hey, go ahead and free yourself
(Go ahead and free yourself)

[Outro]
Baby if you don't want me
Don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
I'll be alright
Go ahead to someone else
(Go ahead to someone else)
Yeah, yeah
