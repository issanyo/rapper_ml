[Verse 1:]
Baby to the hip hip hop hop
Baby I won't stop
Tell me what's your sign
Is it compatible to mine?
I'm gonna hit you with the 1,2
Check-a 1,2, are we meant to be
Let me introduce you to my crew
I be sweatin' you
Sweatin' you like sweat
Can you feel my vibe
And are you feelin' it just yet?
Baby you be makin' my poor heart pound
Every time you...

[Chorus:]
Turn me all around
Hear my heart pound
You got it goin' on
That's why I sing this song
Turn me all around
Hear my heart pound
You got it goin' on
That's why I sing this song

[Verse 2:]
Check this
You be so fine
And I'm a witness
Hit me on my hip
Come and check me
I got what you want
I got what you need
And each time you be walkin' by
My poor heart pounds
On and on and on till the break of dawn sounds
So let me hear you say...
