Baby, baby, baby, baby I was thinking about you last night
The way you looked last night
You left me satisfied
It takes two to tango
Tell can you handle
Come on along, you know
You know you want s-more
You know
You want s-more
You know you want s-more
If you want s-more
Open up my door
You know you want s-more
You know you want s-more
If you want s-more
Open up my door I hear you knocking at my door
Let's me know you want more
Come and get it if you with it I'll touch you
How you like it Is it sensitive
Do you wanna give, give s-more
Open my door Baby, baby, baby
You were bragging on the phone
About the things you could do to me
When we're alone, baby, baby
You know what I got to give
Do you want it

Do you want it
Tell me if
You know you want s-more
You know you want s-more
If you want s-more
Open up my door
You know you want s-more
You know you want s-more
If you want s-more
Open up my door I hear you knocking at my door
Let's me know you want more
Come and get it if you with it I'll touch you
How you like it
Is it sensitive
Do you wanna give, give s-more
Open my door I hear you knocking at my door
Baby, knocking baby
Knocking baby, knocking baby
You know you knocking
And you want s-more
And I know you want s-more
You want s-more
You want s-more
Baby
