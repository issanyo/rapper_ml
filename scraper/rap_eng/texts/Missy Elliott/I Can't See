[Missy]
Ficky, ficky
Uhh uhh
Ficky, ficky
Uhh uhh
Ficky, uhh ficky, uhh uhh
Uhh Uhh
Ain't no you without me
And that's for real baby
And ain't no you without you
So what's the deal baby
And I got five little fellas trying to talk to me (say what)
But see my mind is on you so it don't matter to me

[Nicole - Verse One]
What you've been giving me
I like the way it feels
Won't trade it in for nothing
Please don't take your love away
Cause if you leave, I'd never be the same (be the same, same, same)
Oh no no no (1-2)
I may be young in age
But I know I'm in love
I don't care what they say
They don't know a thing about us (a thing about us, thing about us)
Cause you've got my back and I've got your trust
I'm not trying to see you without

[Hook]
I can't see me without you
I can't see no you without me
That's something
I can't conceive
Cause there's no me without you

[Missy]
Verse Two

[Nicole - Verse Two]
Girls tried to separate us
And make me lose my cool
Your best friend tried to play you
But I held it down for you
Thatt, just to show my love is true (is true)
The times came when I thought I couldn't
Live without your love
But I just couldn't shake you
Memories of you weren't enough
Now I know that I'm living for your touch
And I'm not trying to see without

[Repeat Hook]

[Missy]
Take me to the bridge

[Nicole - Bridge]
There's no me without you
There's no you without me
I can't see it
I can't feel it
I ain't even trying to hear it
(repeat x2)

[Nicole - Rap]
Travel the seas at a high speed
For your L-O-V-E
Dealing inequality
Exchanging car keys
B.S. freeze
On top of all situations
Relationships are long term
And plus I deal with patients
I try to fight this feeling
This really good feeling
I can't see
Sometimes I feel I'm illing
All we need to is intrigue in this love thing
You and me make the world thing
I can't see

[Repeat Hook x2]

I can't see
I can't see
Nobody but you and me (yo yo yo)
I can't see
I can't see (that's something I can't conceive)
(Cause there's no me without you)

Misdemeanor here

I can't see
I can't see (1-2)
Nobody but you me (no doubt)
That's something I can't conceive (say what)
