(Applause)

COME ON!

"Roar"

I used to bite my tongue
And hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat
And make a mess
So I sat quietly
Agreed politely

I guess that i forgot
I had a choice
I let you push me past
The breaking point

I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything

You held me down
But I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound (Hey!)
Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

CHORUS

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar (roar louder)
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna…
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!

"Dark Horse"

I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I’m capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

CHORUS

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for (you should know)
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse (like a dark horse)

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine (oh yeah!)
There’s no going back
There’s no going back
There’s no going back

"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Lenny Kravitz"

"I Kissed A Girl"

(Lenny Kravitz)

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion

(Katy Perry)

It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

(Lenny Kravitz and Katy Perry)

CHORUS

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it

(Katy Perry)

I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

"Teenage Dream"

You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

CHORUS

You make me
Feel like
I'm living a, teenage, dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops
When you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe
This, is, real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight, tonight

KATY: (Make some noise Super Bowl)

(crowd applause)

"California Gurls"

I know a place ( sing it!)

CROWD: (where the grass is really greener)

Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek
Oh, oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh,oh

CHORUS

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

(MISSY ELLIOT)

"Get Ur Freak On"

Missy be puttin' it down, I'm the hottest 'round
I told y'all,  y'all can't stop me now
Listen to me now, I'm lastin' twenty rounds
And if you want me  then come on, get me now
Is you with me now? Then biggie, biggie bounce
I know you dig the way I sw-sw-switch my style
Holla
People sing around
Now people gather 'round, now people jump around

[Hook]
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on

Is it worth it? Let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup (lets go Super Bowl)

If you got a big *elephant trumpet*, let me search ya
And find out how hard I gotta work ya
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup

"Lose Control" (solo)

(Music make you lose control)
I got a cute face, chubby waist
Thick legs, in shape
Rump shakin, both ways
Make you do a double take

Planet rocker, show stopper
Flow proper, head knocker
Beat scholar, tail dropper
Do my thang

(Just throw your hands in the air!)
(Just throw your hands in the air!)
(Just throw your hands in the air!)

Music make you lose control

"Fireworks"

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

PRE CHORUS

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

CHORUS

'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

CHORUS

'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

OUTRO

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Oh yeah yeah

Thank you and God Bless America!
