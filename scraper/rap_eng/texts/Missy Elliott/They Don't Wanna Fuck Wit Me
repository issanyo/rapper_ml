My car's the way that I flex
And people say I'm dope as fuck
They say I'm just too fly
I make em wanna get high
They want a piece of this pie
But I'm just too damn chill for them
No way I flip my shit
It feels like a good hit

Nigga, you can't get smokin in this hay
Nigga, what you got to say
Iza bah bah zah zay
Iza zah zah zah zay
