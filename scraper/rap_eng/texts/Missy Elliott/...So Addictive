[Missy - singing]
I know some of y'all sick of songs y'all be hearin on the radio-
Ohhhh (ohhh!)
So me and Timbaland gon' give that shit you never heard before
(shit you never heard before-ohhh)
It's like drinkin liquor or weed or X whatever does you the best
My beats, are so (sooooo) addic-hictive

[Tweet] C'mon get krunk with me
[Missy] See if you're ridin down the street
And you're bout to roll that shit up
[Tweet] You don't need drugs or weed
[Missy] Oh nah you ain't smokin that stank shit up in my car
Get your feet off my dashboard
[Tweet] C'mon get krunk with me
[Missy] Oh yeah you wanna get krunk though?
Well pop this CD in right here and take a hit of me

[singing] My album is so, addic-hictive

[Missy] My album is so addictive {*echoes}
