[Intro]
This love is so much better
Than anything I've ever ever had

[Verse 1]
There's not a better situation
That I'd rather be in
Sometimes we go through some shit
But you still my closest friend
And although we may fight boy
And wanna go insane
The love that i have for you
Still remains the same
If I'd a listen to my best friends
Who said that you wasn't my type
Then I would probably be just like them
Still searchin
Looking for mr. right
If I would listen to my family
Who said you not the one for me
Then I would probably be down and out
No doubt-lonely

[Chorus]
So you gotta
You gotta follow your heart when it speaks
So bump what your friends say, yea
Cause they might lead you the wrong way
You know when you're in love
So you gotta
You gotta follow your heart when it speaks
So bump what your friends say, yea
Cause they might lead you the wrong way
You know when you're in love

[Verse 2]
I'm glad I stayed very patient
Instead of chasing around
I coulda ended up on a dead end
But boy I'm on the right road now
It's not a accident, it's evident
That baby we were meant to be
The last relationship that I ever been in
My friends said it was good for me
If I'da listen to my best friends
They say that you weren't my type
I would probably be just like them
Still searchin
Looking for Mr. Right
If Ida listen to my family
Who said you that weren't the one for
I'd probably be down and out and still lonely

[Chorus]
You gotta follow your heart when it speaks
So bump what your friends say yea
Cause they might lead you the wrong way
You know when you're in Love
Can't miss this opportunity
To find someone so sweet
So I follow my gut baby
You're the only one for me
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are
You know when you're in love
You gotta follow your heart when it speaks
So bump what your friends say yea
Cause they might lead you the wrong way
You know when you're in Love
Can't miss this opportunity
To find someone so sweet
So I follow my gut baby
You're the only one for me
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are
You know when you're in love
