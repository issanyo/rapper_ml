[Intro]
Slim motherfuckin' Shady... alright!
Missy Elliott, Timbo, c'mon, yo!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends
Holding a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tecs at you
Until you see your fuckin' legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' out the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin' out the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a buildin'
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (Keep filmin'!)
Woke up to a hospital staff
Got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half
And suffocated your oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'm a get the East and West beefin' again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

[Interlude]
Ken Kaniff: Oh fuck, oh shit
Ken Kaniff: I got the hotel room ready
Ken Kaniff: What time are you getting off, work
(Ken Kaniff: Or shall I say) Eminem: Aight, yo, yo, yo one more time, yo
(Ken Kaniff: What time are you comin' home)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, yo, I'm only smilin' when I'm violent
Got on the plane wildin'
Told the pilot to fly me to Tylenol Island
Stewardess like, "You restless?"
"Nah, bitch, I'm restful, so hold this fuckin' jet still so I can eat these pretzels"
Forget school
The other kids are disrespectful
They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles
I can't take it
I'm tryin' to gain weight
So I eat steak
And swallow the whole plate
And weigh myself, naked
Put out albums
To teach kids family values
'Cause every mom and dad should allow you to pop valiums
And never hit someone unless you got a reason
And if there ain't a reason
Make one up, then start swingin'
