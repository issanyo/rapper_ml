I need to talk to y'all for one minute (ohh)
Have you ever been so mad with the one you love
And you said some things that you regret in the morning (ooh ooh)
But your pride still won't let you admit when you're wrong
But wrong (ohh) is wrong and you're more an adult when you can admit that
Ya feel me (ooh)

[Missy]
See baby last night I was pissed
Cold as ice on my wrist, freezer type
I was like pissed right
I said a few things that made his brain go ding
This chick sick that make 'em just wanna quit
Now don't give up on the good love
The backrubs in the bathtub, yeah I'm just a dirty slut
I'm just a spoiled teddy bug
Yeah I get petty, forgive me if I act too silly

Woman enough to say I'm sorry, ohh, I didn't mean to lie
