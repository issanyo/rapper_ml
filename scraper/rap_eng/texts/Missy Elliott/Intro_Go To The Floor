Yeah, what's the deal ya'll this Missy Elliott givin' ya'll
Magazine writer's, radio cats ,listers or plain old haters
A small piece of my album
Which is titled under construction under construction
Simply states that I'm a work in progress, I'm working on myself
You know uh, every since Aaliyah passed
I view life in a uh, more valuable way looking at hate
And anger gossip or just plain
Ol bullshit became ignorant to me
When you realize in a blink of a eye
You walking down a church aisle
And that was meant for weddings and happiness
And realize the same church aisle are used
To view a loved one for the last time
From the world trade families the left eye family big pun family
You know biggie family Pac family to the hip hop family
We all under construction
Trying to rebuild you know ourselves
Hip hop done gained respect from you
Know not even respect form but just like rock and roll
And it took us a lot of hard work to get here
So all that hatin' and animosity between folks you need to kill it
With a skillet you don't see Bill Gates and Donald trump
Arguing wit each other 'cuz both of them got paper
And the they got better shit to do get more paper
So all I'm sayin' is, let's take hip hop back to the rope follow me
Momma say, momma sah, momma can you do this?
Talkin' like you badest when you just know dat is
Every time I come out ya'll be like who dat is
Be like more like Ashanti and be unfoolish
You don't really want to break it wit me
You wear gata I sport the fendi
My Lamborghini against you Benzi
Dirty diamonds and your ring see mine like cling cling
Ding ding ding da ding ding ding ding
I used to get so high they call me Ming Lee
Spiked up my hair done like Don King
Haters keep on hatin' 'cause dem don't worry weed
Dem don't worry weed den me and Timothy
M I S E slimed out my body
Bang bang to the boogie ooh, wee
Playa keep on playin' watch me do my duty
Go to the floor, now tell me wat you want
Grab me a drink, now wat you gon'do
I'm here to shake shake my booty down down to the beat
Step on the chair and dance like who
Dance like the freaks, now wat you came to do
I came to shake shake my booty down like the party
I'm underated, glad I made it, idependent, orperated
I never hesitate haters keep me motivated
The beat is penetrated I'll timmy regulate it
And we layed it in the shade and drink a glass of lemonade
Damm, I'm faded ain't no other way to say it ain't that complicated
Ain't no other chicks gon' ever make me feel like invaded
I keep droppin' hits like water breakin' to centimeters and I'm dialatin'
Radio impatient ooh, come 1 check my translation
From my observation my fans is real patient
They don't wanna hear the laughs so stop fakin'
Greezy like bacon, keep my stomach achin'
If you wanna battle let there b no more delayin'
I hope you did some prayin' 'cause when I come swayin'
Pop shu pop, pop yea sometimes I flow sometimes quick
You was on the verge to kissin' ass so slick
I'd be on the verge or makin' hits after hits
This the kind of shit that tell yo momma don't forget
Go to the floor, now tell me wat you want
Grab me a drink, now wat you gon'do
I'm here to shake, shake my booty down down to the beat
Step on the chair and dance like who
Dance like the freaks, now wat you came to do
I came to shake shake my booty down like the party
Everybody, move your body now do it
Here's somethin' that's gonna make you move and goove
Hey DJ keep playin' that song all night on and on and on
