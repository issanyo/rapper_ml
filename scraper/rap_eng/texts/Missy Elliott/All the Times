Mmmmmmm (hmmmmmm)

Sincerely I can say
That we should have met before today
But I am (hmmmm) happy to have this chance (this chance yeah)
To beeee with you and I'm going to make the best of it

Gerald Levert:

This is more than joy for me
To feel like a family
And when we go our seperate ways
This feeling will always stay

Chorus

Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally found a chance to get together
Look at all the times we've seen each other
It feels so good to be together

(look at all the times we've had babe)
Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally found the chance to get together
(ohhh sing it Coko)

If you take a listen deeply, deeply
You can hear the pride in my voice yeah, ohhhhhhh
It's nothing hard to see that
I'm happy about the way we came to beeee, beeee

If I ever get the chance (ohhhhh)
Again I'll know that
We make sweet music
Togerther ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Chorus

Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally found a chance to get together
Look at all the times we've seen each other
It feels so good to be together
Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally found a chance to get together
Look at all the times we've seen each other
It feels so good to be together

Keith Sweat:

Tell me precious
We must have meant it
Escpecially when we're often apart
(We're always apart yeah)

I'm only thinking of me and you ohhhhhhhhh

Look at the times we've been together
Now I have finally got the chance to be, should be should be
Look at the times we've been apart
Though I have never had the chance to meet you

Chorus (till fade)

Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally found a chance to get together
Look at all the times we've seen each other
It feels so good to be together
