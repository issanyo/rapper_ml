Your fly, so now I know why your feelin' yourself Tweet
But how you do it?
Come on shorty you can tell me

[Verse 2: Tweet]
I'll tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance, from this body so buttery brown and tantalizing
You would have thought I needed help
From this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

[Hook: Tweet]
OOPS! there goes my shirt up over my head, oh my
OOPS! there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my
OOH! Some kinda touch caressin' my legs, oh my
OOH! I'm turnin' red, who could this be

[Verse 3: Tweet]
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallow my pride, let it ride
And partied, but this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lonnie B.]
Lonnie B. baby (yeah)
Let's go!
Yo, you feelin' freakin', beat me
You got a demand to meet me
At the Marriott on Brod
Or we can go up to D.C
I got some fellas, we can get freaky up in my T.P
You me and my, (?) consider that a three peace
I'll taste you every seven days
Have you shaken weekly
The other six, i'll just watch you
Damn I'm so freaky
Cut you like Kiki
Why you seem like you just tryin' to tease me!
Shorty take it easy!
(OOPS!) I didn't mean to scare you
Just gettin' coffee, can I take off my boxers? (OH MY!, Oh my)
(OOPS!) Can I lay besides you
And when you finish stick my stinger inside you (OH MY!, Oh my)
(OOPS!) But first, let me twist on that kitty
Fastest tough in the city (OH MY!, Oh my)
Handcuffed her, she knew what was next

(Tweet) So shock I had to catch my breath

(Tweet) I looked over to the left
(Missy) I was lookin' so good I couldn't reject myself
(Tweet) I looked over to the left
(Missy) I was feelin' so good I had to touch myself
(Tweet) I looked over to the left
(Missy) I was eyein' my thighs (?)
(Tweet) I looked over to the left
(Missy) Comin' out of my shirt and then my skirt came down
