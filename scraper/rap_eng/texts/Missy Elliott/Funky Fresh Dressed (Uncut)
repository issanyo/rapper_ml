Here's a little story that must be told
And it goes a little something like this
(This is a Misdemeanor Exclusive)
If your radio is experiencing any kind of difficulties
Turn the volume up
T-turn the volume up
T-turn the volume up
(This is Exclusive)

-1-
Its very necessary on the contrary
No you do not scare me is you drinkin Bloody Mary
Police you betta hurry before I have to bury
My attitude is bitchy cuz my period is heavy
I used to drive a Chevy put 20s on that Bevy
My nigga was the shit but then that stupid nigga left me
But now Im luvin Larry but Larry go wit Terri
And Terri is a freak but its his baby she will carry
The life you lives a fairy, cartoon like Tom & Jerry
My flow is legendary and ya style is temporary
But yo you need to worry like Jason it gets scary
The words that I spit dont fit in a category
I guess my vision blurry my speech is very slurry
Me without Tim is like Jamaicans wit no curry
I guess its necessary so hurry nigga hurry
Cuz when this album drop you wack MCs will all get burried

Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party

Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party

Ya style is very crumby thats why you have no money
You always looking bummy I dont care if you dont love me
Dont try to come in for me unless you are a dummy
Repeat you lose ya teeth and I would hate to call you gummy
Rainy or sunny battle no way honey
This is not a game of hide 'n' seek or culture rummy
Its bout to get so ugly
And Imma keep ya running
Hiding from me cuz you know you are weak
And you ain't sayin nothin I keep ya jumpin jumpin
In ya ???? im bumpin somethin in ya trunk and...
You can say im buggin cuz when I come I wasn't
Thats why yall be dicussin who I like and who Im fuckin

Miss Jade:
I had a lil homie named Paul Revere
Smoked blunt after blunt guzzle 40s of beer
Used to swear up and down every first of the year
He was gon quit smokin but he neva did
Watch ?yall husky? its about that time
Gettin ready for the club around quarter ta 9
Couple bottles of hypnotic in the back of the ride
Might spit like a girl but I hit like a guy
Me and Missy ballin up the Avenue
Funky fresh dressed to impress we mackin dues
Music biz only reason I ain't jackin fools
You know bullshit walkin stackin rules
Niggas keep drawin, the streets keep callin
Drink til im nice and uh uh uh on and...
Im bad luck yall mad cuz yall suck
Please do not try to fuck with this young buck
Please do not try to fuck with this young buck
