Bet you realize this time that when you see my friends sitting outside they were, there to help me pack my bags and tell me don't listen to you if you're beggin

Cause they know I'm coming straight back home to you, and they know I'm a constant fool for you – so I'm putting my things on a U-haul and I'm blockin out your number when you call

No conversation you can keep your words, cause 90% I done already heard, how long did you think that I would sit here for, I'm letting you know it's not exceptional

No conversation you can save the games, and anything you say I will remain the same. How long did you think that I would sit here for, destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

I can't believe you even tried to blame me, cause you're the one who changed I've been the same me

And I been by your side like a 2 way and like a pager with no clamp that's how you lose me

So my friends come to help me get over you – cause they're sick and tired of seeing what I'm going through

I put all of my things on a U-haul and I won't' accept at all whenever you call

No conversation you can keep your words, cause 90% I done already heard, how long did you think that I would sit here for, I'm letting you know it's not exceptional

No conversation you can save the games, and anything you say I will remain the same. How long did you think that I would sit here for, destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

I should have left your ass long time ago, I was too scared to be out on my own

You made me feel there was no other way

And I won't find love I would be lonely -- ??

You made me feel so damn low

Now take a look at what's happening, this is tragic like when Michael left the Jackson's, I told you you should be careful what you're askin'

You wished I would have left you with some quiet time, but now you got more time than anytime

I know you never thought that I could jet out, but I left before you could tell me get out

No conversation you can keep your words, 90% I done already heard, how long did you think that I would sit here for, I'm letting you know it's not exceptional

No conversation you can save the games, and anything you say I will remain the same. How long did you think that I would sit here for, destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional
