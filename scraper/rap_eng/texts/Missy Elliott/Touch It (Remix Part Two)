[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo Swizzy
I told these niggas I was coming back to bust they ass!
Okay! Remix! Part two!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
See now you who the God be
Back runnin the city and you know who the squad be
Flipmode, bitch, look see ain't nothing changed
Now I'm back with the remix with the Queens of the game (TURN IT UP!)
When you see me in the spot
You nigggas better respect it
Y'all already know where I rep
Ain't no reason to check it
And you know that you ain't fucking with me
Just for the record
So instead I'mma let Mary J. Blige come and set
(Now get low Mary!)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige & Busta Rhymes]
Maybe you can guess who it is (Uh huh)
Mary J. Blige about to handle my biz (Uh huh)
I'm on my grown woman still I rep for the kids
In every hood, and all my people doing a bid
(Turn it up!)
Now you know who's really the queen, deliver the mail
730,000 first week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch looking all pale
While I'm on a yacht overseas doing my nails
(Get low Mary!)
Well let me show you how we do
I gotta thank everyone for copping The Breakthrough
Bus' did take one, the remix is take two
You love the way we reinventing
How we just stay new
(Turn it up!)
How we selling out the stadiums, arenas and all
Only Louis and Gucci, we don't shop at the mall
Got you partying and dancing and having a ball
And you loving the way we repping
How we do it for y'all, go ahead and...

These jokers screaming, "Damn, Rah still be looking good"
They do they little mack
Be asking me who I ta
Ain't none of your concern
You a G, make it hap'
(Turn it up!)
When I give a nigga some play, he losing his brain
Asking me a bunch of questions, acting like he my man
Wanna stress a bitch out, telling me I'm in chains
I'm sayin, "Damn, my bad if you fell for the game"
(Get low, Digga!)
Now he sitting there looking stuck
He thinking 'cause he spent a little dough I'm 'gon fuck
If money ain't a thang, I'm saying let a bitch know
Type to empty your account
How far you willing to go?
(Turn it up!)
Now he hoping on a jet, he ain't wasting no time
Told me all expense paid, any place I could find
Hit the islands in the winter, tricking all on his dime
Ain't a shorty in the world pussy better than mine

Am I jingling baby?
Yeah, go 'head, mami
Don't I look charming?
Put your lips up on me
Woop!
Kiss it, touch it, good
Yes, I wish you would
(Turn it up!)
You like to see me when I dip, baby, dip
Don't it look like I got Beyonce's hips?
Looking like I could be Nia Long
Boy, you smoking that Cheech and Chong
(Get low, Missy)
Have you ever seen thickness in a thong?
You can hit it like a game of ping pong
If you give me two shots of Patron
Nigga, bring it on
I might let you take me home
(Turn it up!)
Now Busta Bus, Misdemeanor in here
This year, be clear, y'all best beware
In fear, emcees, y'all ain't come near
