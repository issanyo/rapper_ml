[Intro]
"...With a dozen roses, such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true, the makings of you"

[Chorus]
Boy, you remind me, remind me of my Gucci shoes
Everytime you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind everytime I get next to you

[Verse 1]
I think I'm falling in love with you, baby
Caught up in somehting that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing
Something like R. Kelly singing 'bout a Jeep
Boy, you're everything to me
And you're my, you're my, you're my property

[Chorus]
Boy, you remind me remind me of the ice on my ring
Boy, you remind me of this
These are the makings of you and it's true
These are, these are the makings of you

[Verse 2]
You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time
We made love just like the 25th day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Clause to show up
You got a heart of gold, baby, you should know
Baby, you remind me of so much
And baby, you always stay on my mind
You're just like my rims, you shine

[Chorus]
Boy, you remind me of 26s on my ride
The way you're spinning around looking like a superstar
Boy, you remind me of how life's supposed to be
How life's supposed to be
This is what you remind me
And you're my, you're my, you're my property

Looking at you look at another
Baby, I don't need another brother
Sex time around you I feel the same my body
There no pressure, baby
You know I keep it so real and
I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal? Tell me how you feel
Could it be me, me for eternity?
(You and me for eternity)

Like the ice on my wrist it's like kick on my hip
Mac on my lips, Armor oil on my whip butta on my shirmp
I'm the Gladys, you the Pip
I Keep my hair flip the way you like to see
Me strip keep a money clip
You remind me of a tip like a pair of jeans
From Abercrombie when they rip like a glass of wine
Everytime I take a sip it's you, you, you, you, you (Aw, baby)

[Chorus]
Boy, you remind me, remind me of my Gucci shoes
Everytime you walk pass, all the girls be looking at you
(Everytime you come around I lose my mind, babe)
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
(You got, you got, yeah)
And I be losing my mind everytime I get next to you
(no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

[Outro]
"...With a dozen roses, such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true, the makings of you"
