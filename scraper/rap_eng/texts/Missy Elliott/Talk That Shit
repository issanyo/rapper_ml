[Intro: Timbaland & T-Pain]
They can talk that shit, they can talk that shit
They can talk that shit, they can talk that shit
They can talk that shit, they can talk that shit
They can talk that shit, they can talk that shit

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Baby girl you saw I'm a don, let's get on one accord
If you misunderstanding me check me out on Forbes
And I got a Maybach, with the partition
And they call it Flat head baby, flat baby the new edition
It's Timbaland man beats that make you bump that
Over a Mill on my debit card, believe that
Wanna hurt a nice top, I'm talking implant
Bout to cop a nice watch, I'm talking Rembrandt
I've been around world so much I think I'm Omar
I met that [?], you the golden arch
Yeah I talk shit, nigga that deed shit
I bought a yacht just to see if I would get seasick
So why you fronting for, when you ain't got that
I got a Bugatti Zana, bitch you ain't got that
Homey your money's too young, you need to go to bed
It's grown man over here, nigga we talk that

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here
I'm in a Maybach, he in the cavalier
Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash
Let's have a conversation, we can talk about that
And I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk
And I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk
Now go and give me 50 because when I talk that spitting
If the haters keep hating, I'm a have to come and talk that shit

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Oh you think you cute huh, got a lot of money, huh
I'm filthy rich and you can call me Donald Trump, huh
I got big bank, I'm talking big bucks
And I bought a Phantom to see how the back doors open up
Missy E on the track, I'ma make you bump that
I got the new Ferrari shorty you ain't got that
I got them whips that so sick when I spit them hating chicks
Wanna know how much I get two hundred grand and eat Doritos chips
Been around the world so much I'm like Obama
And I got a vacation spot in the Bahamas
Yeah, I talk shit, talking 'bout that deep shit
I call the DJ's up and tell them: "go and leak this"
Cause I got that cash, I got that dough
I make my money money grow, so I'm never broke
You wanna know much it costs to get a Tim track
Man you can't afford that

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here
I'm in a Maybach, he in the cavalier
Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash
Let's have a conversation, we can talk about that
I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk
And I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk
Now go and give me 50 because when I talk that splitting
If the haters keep hating, I'm a have to come and talk that shit

[Verse 3: Missy Elliot]
They call me Missy E., I got a lotta cheese
And you're a Nickel Bag shorty, I'm a Dime Piece
Don't you see the [?], got dough up everywhere
And the Lamborghini doors that go up in the air
Man look at this, I got the Bentley whip
I drive the sickest Benz, boy I make them haters sick
You I got it, I get it, I be the richest in the city
Talking more shit than you see up in the toilet
Man, you's a hater, I got the big house with the elevator
See the way you sit on it, 12 big acres
I rent movies for my movie theater
Now what you talking 'bout, bitch you ain't got that
I got the credit card that call a bill a jet lag
See the way the hater talk, a Missy don't care
I be your a milli, a milli, I'm a millionaire

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here
I'm in a Maybach, you in the cavalier
Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash
Let's have a conversation, we can talk about that
And I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk
And I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk
Now go and give me 50 figures when I talk that spitting
If the haters keep hating, I'm a have to come and talk that shit
