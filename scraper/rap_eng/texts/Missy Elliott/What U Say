I've been through it all before
That nigga ain't c'mon back thru my door
I couldn't help it, anymore
So all your messages I'll ignore

[LaTocha Scott]
You made me believe, that I was your everything
And then you turn and leave me with none [ohh yah]
Now I stay here crying every night
Wishing you were here with me, but you can't be

[both - hook]
No matter what you say
You can no longer hurt me
It's over now
Get your bags, your out
I don't need your kiss no more ohh!
No matter what you say
You can no longer hurt me
It's over now
So get the hell on out
Cuz I don't need your touch no more ohh!

[Missy Elliott]
I used to think I was in love
But now I now that I wasn't
You treated me, like dirt
But it's you thatz gonna get hurt
No let me tell you!!!!!
That you had better get out
Cuz supposibly you never loved me
And now I don't need that ohh!!

No matter how many times you lied
I just kept coming back for more
Back for more, back for more!!!!

Gonna wipe the tears from my eyes
You should have looked inside
But now I don't got da time
