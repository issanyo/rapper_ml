Go 'head rub the puddy cat
Don't you like the way I make you be my little slave?
Whip you like a kid every time you misbehave
Ooh, you such a freak
Freakin', freakin', freakin' me
All you gotta do is just flip it, smack
Baby, can you show me how to bring sexy back?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]

And I'mma bring sexy back and matter of fact, yeah, I think I'm super fine
