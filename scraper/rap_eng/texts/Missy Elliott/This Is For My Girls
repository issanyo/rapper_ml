[Verse 1:]
There's beauty in your soul
That's what makes you beautiful
Don't let nobody ever make you doubt it, yeah
Your heart is free and strong
That's what keeps you keeping on
Can't keep you down, there ain't no doubt about it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't forget, it's all about respect
Nothing else will do
Remember it's your life [Rowland]
Live it any way you like [Rowland]
Cause you know you got the right to [Rowland]

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland leads]
This is for my girls all around the world
Stand up, put your head up
Don't take nothing from nobody
This is for my girls stand up and be heard
This is for my ladies, my sisters, all over
This is for my girls

[Verse 2:]
You're someone who can be soft as silk but strong as steel
Don't shy away from showing what you're made of, oh
This world is yours to take
You can bend but you won't break [Clarkson?]
You got no fear and nothing you're afraid of [Clarkson?]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So don't forget, it's all about respect [Clarkson]
Nothing less will do [Clarkson]
Take a [?]
Let 'em see how bright you shine
Cause you know it's your time to...yeah

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland leads]
This is for my girls all around the world
Stand up, put your head up
Don't take nothing from nobody
This is for my girls stand up and be heard
This is for my ladies, my sisters, all over
This is for my girls

[Bridge]
Let life in with open arms [Clarkson]
With love and with an open heart [Clarkson]
We got to remember [Rowland]
We'll stand strong forever [Rowland]
Yeah, we stand together [Rowland]

[Verse 3: Missy Elliot]
This is for my ladies, like soldiers we stand up
Remember when 2Pac told us keep our head up?
And even when the times get rough we get up
Treat your life like a stage, you go 'head and tear it up
Pass the mic, pass the mic, ladies come through
Don't ever, ever let 'em try to stop or try to block you
You better tell 'em you something better than any other
You'll never settle, you're next level, yeah, you're making moves
Woo, put your hands up  high
This is U-N-I-T-Y
Yo, yo, this is how it go, woo

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland leads with ad-libs by Clarkson and Rowland]
This is for my girls all around the world
Stand up, put your head up
Don't take nothing from nobody
This is for my girls stand up and be heard
This is for my ladies, my sisters, all over
This is for my girls
This is for my girls all around the world
Stand up, put your head up
Don't take nothing from nobody
This is for my girls stand up and be heard
This is for my ladies, my sisters, all over
This is for my girls

[Outro]
All over, my girls, my girls
My sisters, my sisters
All over, this is for my girls
