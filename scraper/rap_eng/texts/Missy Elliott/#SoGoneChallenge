[Verse 1]:
We're two peas in a paradox
A silent movie starring Bruce Lee
And the Atlanta Hawks
If I wasn't the don don dada
Would we even talk?
Or would you cut your losses
Break even, and leave me lost?
It's easy to breeze through the seasons
Without me falling short
I'll do little to get all these
Porky pigs to talk
But still they working at turning
Our feature films to shorts
And would you end it
Pretending we weren't
Cut from cloth?
Same fabric
Laughed at every monster
We saw in the same attic
Mastered every mantra
We spoke in the same labyrinth
I'm adamant with the javelin tosses
My chain's battered
Shadowing over Alice
It's hard to remain Hatter

[Hook]:
I do what I can
She do what she want
She count on her man
I opened her up
In person she cute
We met on the gram
Shit didn't last
It wasn't in the cards
It wasn't in the plans
If she come to my show
I'll bring her on stage
And we hittin our dance

[Verse 2]:
Lily pad lily pad
Still waters
Every body has a mouth
I traveled south
Along the border
I took a dip in Delaware
I dipped before they caught up
I took a trip to neverland
I tripped and now i'm falling
Fumbling the equations
And functions that lead to victory
Mumbling all these numbers
I run with whatever sticks to me
Done committed to memory
Centuries of our history
Studied the laws of physics
But that ain't seem to do shit for me
Cuz, love ain't black & white
It's the whole spectrum
I got, plugged into your database
No credentials
I'm in this for you girl

[Hook]:
I do what I can
She do what she want
She count on her man
I opened her up
In person she cute
We met on the gram
Shit didn't last
It wasn't in the cards
It wasn't in the plans
If she come to my show
I'll bring her on stage
And we hittin our dance
