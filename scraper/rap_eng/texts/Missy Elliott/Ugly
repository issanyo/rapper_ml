You sho' is ugly, ugly

[Blaque] (Missy)
Hey boy, I don't mean to be rude
But the way you coming on made me catch an attitude
You wanna know what the deal, but what's up with your grill
Cause you ugly so please stop talking junk in my ear (come on)

[Blaque] (Missy)
Turn the lights off, turn the lights off (ah)
Yeah you ugly but whoo there's some hoes in here (ah)
Turn the lights off (oh), turn the lights off (whoo)
Boy you ugly so whoo won't you disappear

[Blaque] (Missy)
Sorry to hurt your feelings
Cause boy you think you are so appealing
You keep stepping to me but we will never be
Cause you ugly so there will be no conversating (come on)

[Blaque] (Missy)
Turn the lights off, turn the lights off (ah)

Turn the lights off (oh), turn the lights off (whoo)
Boy you ugly so whoo won't you disappear

[Blaque]
When the lights off, boy you look real good
Wanna give you my number but something tells me don't do it
When the lights come on and I see your face up close

[Missy]
Damn you ugly as hell and on top of that you broke as a joke

[Blaque]
How dare you walk up here on me like you super fine
As long as it's dark in here you know every chick is mine
Ain't no way you gon' take me home (so ugly)

[Missy]
Aah, you ugly
Boy what that hit your face
It must have been a can of mace
I ain't got nothing to say
Just two words out there, Oil of Olay
Boy just give me some space
Ugly is not a very good case, ah
That outfit is just a waste, come on
Cause it ain't doing jack for your face, come on
That's why girls running away
Like roaches when they hit Raid, ah
It might be foul to say
But it's foul for you to look that way, aha
And I don't want your chedder, ah
I don't care what you say, whatever
Cause me and you will never be, come on
Damn, you so ugly

So I can't even vision gettin' love as your gift

Did your mamma let you out like this, hell
I know you wanna do me baby
Yeah but I'm kinda into cuties lately
Matter of fact homeboy, let me hook you up
Here's two bucks, go on and get your fade hitched up
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
