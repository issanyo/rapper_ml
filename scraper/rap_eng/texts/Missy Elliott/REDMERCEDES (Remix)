[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me
Rolling deeper than Adele when we go out
If the ladies show up, then we show out
With my girl in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck me, baby
Leather seats so she wetter than a pool now
When that thing go up then she go down

[Chorus: Aminé]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Ugh! Got a new beam, new whip (new whip)
Doors sit up like a facelift (facelift)
Sub in my trunk go apeshit (apeshit)
Rims spinning round like a spaceship (spaceship)
I see money, I'ma chase it (chase it)
Ask them suckers why they always hating (hating)
Maybe cause your man wanna taste it (taste it)
You know you like to see me when I'm naked (ugh!)
Junk in my trunk, gon' beat
Look back at it, I'm thick, thick
Big ol' hips, I'm thick, thick
You can call me Rick James, I'm rich, bitch (woo!)
Vroom, vroom, vroom in my two-door (two-door)
Big body dancing like a sumo (sumo)
Yeah, I got the meds and it's paid for (paid for)
What you chat 'bout, boy? You don't know

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me
Rolling deeper than Adele when we go out
If the ladies show up, then we show out
With my girl in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck me, baby
Leather seat so she wetter than a pool now
When that thing go up then she go down

[Chorus: Aminé]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life (on my life!)
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type (type)
This shit so clean, I put that on my life (on my life!)
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Hundred on your wrist so you wanna get loud now (skrt!)
Everything ain't what you see, something like Bow Wow (true)
Copped the red Benz and we left the Honda (damn)
These days, everything I do bananas (woo!)
4matic in my whip while she on my stick shift (yeah)
Girls really, really love the way the candy paint drips (true!)
CLBN, they like CNN (no!)
We the news, nigga, we don't give a fuck 'bout them (no!)
Missy like my auntie, dreads like palm tree (yeah)
Girls give me shots when I play them Ashanti (yeah)
Hit my nigga AJ when I'm in the UK (ha!)
Red Mercedes waiting up in terminal five (ayy!)

[Chorus: Aminé & AJ Tracey]
This shit so clean (so clean!), I put that on my life (ha!)
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type (oi!)
This shit so clean, yeah, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type (yeah)

[Verse 3: AJ Tracey]
Fly, that's the Cee-Lo, used to grab the reload
I don't wear Valentino, Off-White with the Vlone (wari)
Humble and I'm British (yeah), I ain't polite though
AMG hotbox, high as a kite, bro
Rockstar life, might grab on your wife, yo (oi)
I do the stage proper, then I'm kicking the mic pole (ahh)
If the venue popping with the women, I might roll (I might)
I smashed and deleted, then I moved to the right, bro (to the right)
Hit it, skate, we don't date (nah), Merc, Cris, three-O, late
See my darg? He don't play
Smooth criminal, I pull the move and get away (I'm gone)
Grey Merc, I'm turnt (turnt), work hard (yeah?), smoke purp
Niggas hating cause I really chopped their brains off
It's like this girl was Lincoln cuh she tryna take my chains off (ow!)

[Chorus: Aminé]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type (type)
This shit so clean, yeah, I put that on my life (on my life!)
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
