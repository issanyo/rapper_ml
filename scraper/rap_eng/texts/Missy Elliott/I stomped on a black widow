[Verse 1: Raziah Jones]
See them nitrate blood flow
Oxygen
Thc
Dry mouth
Hydrate
Blunt lit
Lil boy atom bomb annihilate
I radiate through your future black bank
Extract protein like shake
Boy I move weight
Digital age move slow
4G LTE
5 elements carry me

[Chorus: Raziah Jones]
(See the light now)
Black widow cry when she bleed x3

[Verse 2: Raziah Jones]
Bitch I got a lot of looks as of lately
I move in time slow motion
His movement got no motion
I take him to the sky leave his body fucking floating
Boy boy I bet you see now why you shouldn't be gloating
Took took him from his normal life expanded his pain
Why his body feel so heavy
I drop him from the temple
Now the streets covered
And he looking empty
Should I should I catch you fool
I just ask the titans if they'll let me
