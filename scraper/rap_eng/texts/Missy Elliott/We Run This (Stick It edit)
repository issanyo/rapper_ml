Sick tape, volume two!
Believe it!
Hoh! Hoh!
Let me switch up the game

On the flo' I fall back
Step back cause I might put it on ya
I go deep, so deep then I sleep
So sweep cross the floor
Like a broom with my feet

You don't want me have to show ya
How I hop on the beam, flip it over
What up? I'm tore up, sho nuff
I ain't scared to take it off
(Misdemeanor take it off)

Tipsy and I feel good
(Feel good)
Stop a track put on your woods
Into it, I do it, I dud it
If you really, really want it
Then playas stop frontin'
(Stop frontin')

Hey boy you know I'm your type
(Your type)
5'2 and wear my jeans real tight
My curves they swerve so superb
My word is my word and I came to serve

Cause we what?
We run this
What?
We run this
What?
We run this
Oh, oh, oh

It don't matter where you from it's where you at
And if you came to freak-a-leak don't tip your hat baby

East coast, west coast
Down south, represent your coast, c'mon
Yeah we run this, and yeah we run this
Y'all don't want it 'cause my coast run it

Oh, we run this here
We run this here

Wanna pull my hair? Break my back?
For the right money we gonna do it like that
Back to back, I can't even keep track
We gon' show you how to pick a few stacks

Look at dis girl, does she look good?
You can look baby boy, but please don't touch
Look at how you makin' me blush
I'm enough to go around, so people don't push

Wanna see my goods? Oh hush
Party people look in the club
See my diamonds they shine like glittas
So many karats they look like crittas

And we gon' party all night
With a flashlight wave your hands like a kite
I like to keep the people hype
Somebody here, can you hand me my mic?

Cause we what?
We run this
What?
We run this
What?
We run this
Oh, oh, oh

It don't matter where you from, it's where you at
And if you came to freak-a-leak don't tip your hat baby

East coast, west coast
Down south, represent your coast
Yeah we run this, and yeah we run this
Y'all don't want it 'cause my coast run it

Oh, we run this here
We run this here

(Oh yeah)
Is my fellas in the place y'all?
(Oh yeah)
Oh get your back up off the wall
(Oh yeah)
Cause we fin to blow the roof off
(Oh yeah)

And watch me Bogart, get on the ground
Do a one two start, do it with my squad
Cause we rollin' it hard, and it's for all o' y'all
And this is how we ball, cause we some superstars

Say oh yeah, hands in the air
Like oh yeah, cause we don't care
If you wear fake hair and you got fake nails
Ladies where you at? Right here!
