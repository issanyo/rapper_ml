[Intro]
(Fakin' shit gone kill you, boy I know the real you)
(Fakin' shit gone kill you, boy I know the real you)
(Fakin' shit gone kill you, boy I know the real you)
(Fakin' shit gone kill you, boy I know the real you)

[Verse 1: Fantasia]
Really gon' make me
Expose you for exactly what you are, you are
And I'm feeling a little wavy
So right now I don't mind pulling your card
(Fakin' shit will kill you, boy I know the real you)
(Fakin' shit will kill you, boy I know the real you)

[Pre-Chorus: Fantasia]
And as hard as you try
To hide reality, why
We know the truth
(So act brand new if you want to)

[Chorus]
But what would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be without me
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be

[Post-Chorus]
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
You tell 'em that you make big moves
But tell 'em what you really do
Do you really wanna play this game
(Fakin' shit will kill you, boy I know the real you)
(Fakin' shit will kill you, boy I know the real you)
You should tell 'em what you really like
Tell 'em you ain't 'bout that life
I've put you on, I let you shine
Now you so fly... shit blows my mind (Oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Fantasia (Kelly)]
And as hard as you try
To hide reality, why
We know the truth
(So act brand new if you want to)

[Chorus]
But what would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be without me
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Boy you think I'm stupid?
What you think I'm clueless?
You keep chasing them girls
Boy you get the deuces
I'm sick of your excuses
Without me how can you do it?
Do bad all by myself
Nigga yo dick useless
Dude I don't need your sex (your sex)
I'm moving to the next (the next)
You frontin' man, you stuntin' man
You're worser than my ex (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You think that shit funny?
We know the truth boy, keep it one hundred

[Pre-Chorus: Fantasia]
And as hard as you try
To hide reality, why
We know the truth
(So act brand new if you want to)

[Chorus]
But what would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be without me
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be

[Post-Chorus]
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na

[Ontro]
(Fakin' shit gone kill you, boy I know the real you)
(Fakin' shit gone kill you, boy I know the real you)
(Fakin' shit gone kill you, boy I know the real you)
(Fakin' shit gone kill you, boy I know the real you)
