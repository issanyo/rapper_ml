Nicole (featuring Missy & Mocha)
I Can't See (Remix)

[Missy]
Freaky, freaky
Uhh uhh
Freaky, freaky
Uhh uhh
Freaky, uhh freaky
Uhh uhh
Uh uhh uhh uhh

Ain't no you without me
And that's for real baby
Uh huh
And ain't no you without me
So what's the deal baby
Uh
And I got five little fellas tryin' to talk to me
Heh heh
But see my mind is on you
So it don't matter to me
Uh

[Nicole]
What you've been giving me
I like the way it feels
Won't trade it in for nothing
Please don't take your love away
Cause if you leave, I'd never be the same
Oh no no no

I may be young in age
But I know I'm in love
I don't care what they say
They don't know a thing about us
Cause you've got my back and I've got your trust
Cause I'm not trying to see you without

Chorus

I can't see no me without you
I can't see no you without me
That's something, I can't conceive
Cause there's no me without you

[verse two]

[Nicole]
Girls tried to separate us
And make me lose my cool
Your best friend tried to play you
But I held it down for you
That's just to show my love is true
True

Those times came when I thought
I could live without your love
But I just couldn't shake you
Memories of you weren't enough
Now I know that I'm living for your touch
And I'm not trying to see you without

Chorus

I can't see no me without you
I can't see no you without me
That's something, I can't conceive
Cause there's no me without you

[Take me to the bridge]

Bridge

There's no me without you
There's no you without me
I can't see it
I can't feel it
I ain't even trying to hear it

[Mocha]
Yo
I doubt you wanna try me
Without you, where would I be?
Like Lyte, then find me
Icey, Fly like Lee
And shh, while you lookin'
You gon' see she fine
And then you gonna lose it, when you hear she rhyme
Now you wanna be mine, but in the meantime
Could we find, plenty of free-time
Jewelry ain't foolin' me, I see past this E-Class
We Makin' It Hot, you catch a heat rash
What, what

I can't see, I can't see
Nobody but you and me
I can't see
I can't see (that's something I can't conceive)
(Cause there's no me without you)

Chorus

I can't see no me without you
I can't see no you without me
That's something, I can't conceive
Cause there's no me without you

[Misty]
Nocole Wray
Brian Morgan
Misdemeanor here
Mocha
What
Uh huh

I can't see, I can't see
Nobody but you and me
I can't see
I can't see (that's something I can't conceive)
(Cause there's no me without you)
