Listen up everyone! We have been just informed
That there's an unknown virus that's attacking all clubs
Symptoms have been said to be heaving breathing
Wild dancing, coughing, so when you hear the sound
Who, di, whoo, run for cover

Woo, ahh, daddy, ooh, ah, oh, ooh
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch

Misdemeanor on the flow, pretty boy here I come
Pumps in the bunk make you wanna hurt something
I can take your man I don't have to sex em

Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat

Don't stop, get it till ya clothes get wet

Number one, drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make you hoomp, boomp, jump
If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn

Oh, my God, show em I'm large
Shove my beat up, attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'

(Woop woop!)
Don't touch my car alarm
Break in my car you will hear "Viper Armed"
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
