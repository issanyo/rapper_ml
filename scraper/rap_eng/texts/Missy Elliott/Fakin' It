He's so bad, I hate to see him comin'
But I be frontin', makin' he think he somethin'
Knowin' I be lyin' when I'm up, up on 'em covers
Up, up on 'em covers, covers, covers

And yeah, he be kissin' me and yeah, I be smilin'
But he ain't doin' nothin' for me, he ain't got me wilin'
He ask me if I like it, I say yeah 'cause he tryin'
I only do it 'cause I love him, man, I be lyin'

I wonder if he know
Last night I was fakin' it, fakin' it
Last week I was fakin' it, fakin' it
A minute ago, but he don't even know
That I was fakin' it, fakin' it, fakin' it

He don't know I was fakin' it, fakin' it
Thought he was just that dude but I was fakin' it, fakin' it
But I'mma just tell him, I'mma just tell him
Tell him that I was fakin' it, yeah

I'm so bad, I be dancin' on the mattress
But I'm so good, I should be-become an actress
I should win an Oscar for best supportin' actor
I be like Sally, he really, really like me

Yeah, he be kissin' me and yeah, he be grindin'
But he ain't doin' nothin' for me, he ain't got me wilin'
He ask me if I like it, I say yeah 'cause he tryin'
I only do it 'cause I love him

I wonder if he know
Last night I was fakin' it, fakin' it
Last week I was fakin' it, fakin' it
A minute ago, but he don't even know
That I was fakin' it, fakin' it, fakin' it

He don't know I was fakin' it, fakin' it
Thought he was just that dude but I was fakin' it, fakin' it
But I'mma just tell him, I'mma just tell him
Tell him that I was fakin' it, yeah

When we be love makin' and nigga, I be fakin'
Lookin' at my faces think he got my legs shakin'
Then he hear me moanin', I be groanin' like it's achin'
Ask me is it good, well boy, don't spend your time wastin'

I'm like an actress, damn, I need an agent
Really want him off me but I lay here real patient
Damn, I'm so amazin', damn, I'm so amazin'
This is for my ladies who get sick and tired of fakin' it

Yeah, he wanna taste it, tattoo, and engrave it
No clothes, butt naked, my mind I must erase it, erase it
Many men be softer than some raisins
Sex, I ain't fazin', I'm just sick of fakin' it

See, most girls would probably end up cheatin'
Most girls would maybe even leave him
Most girls, but with me there ain't no reason
I'm gonna stay, stay 'cause I can't do my baby like that

See most girls won't have it any other way
Most girls, but my baby put it down in another way
Most girls, can't take it, won't make it
But I'm a big him up-up like he beat it up-up

Last night I was fakin' it, fakin' it
Last week I was fakin' it, fakin' it
A minute ago, but he don't even know
That I was fakin' it, fakin' it, fakin' it

He don't know I was fakin' it, fakin' it
Thought he was just that dude but I was fakin' it, fakin' it
But I'mma just tell him, I'mma just tell him
Tell him that I was fakin' it, yeah
