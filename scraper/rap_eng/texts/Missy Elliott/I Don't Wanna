Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Oh ho ho
Hey

(Pam)
I tore up the pictures
All the memories of you
Cause I don't wanna remember
All the pain you put me through
Here I go again
Can't get you far from out of my mind
And so many times I've cried
I tried to put these things behind me

Chorus

I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Everytime I can't function without ya
Everytime I sit home thinkin' about ya

I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Everytime, I can't function without ya
Everytime I sit home thinkin' about ya

(Pam)
I keep tellin' myself
I don't love you anymore
But why am I foolin' myself
Cause this feeling is not too sure
Everything I do
Just brings memories of us
And I don't wanna think about you
But I'm missing all of your love

Chorus

I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya

Everytime, I can't function without ya
Everytime I sit home thinkin; about ya

I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Everytime, I can't function without ya
Everytime I sit home thinkin' about ya

Bridge

My heart's lonely
I've been so depressed for weeks
Can't get you off my mind for me
Someone has took the joy from me

My heart's lonely
I've been so depressed for weeks
Can't get you off my mind for me
Someone has took the joy from me

Chorus

I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Everytime, I can't function without ya
Everytime I sit home thinkin' about ya

I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Everytime, I can't function without ya
Everytime I sit home thinkin' about ya

I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Everytime, I can't function without ya
Everytime I sit home thinkin' about ya

I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Everytime, I can't function without ya
Everytime I sit home thinkin' about ya
