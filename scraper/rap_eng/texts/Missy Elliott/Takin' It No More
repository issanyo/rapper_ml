(Sampled from "take away" By Missy Elliott)
I just Wanna be the perfect Match
We've become so attached
Take away [x16]

[Verse 1]
Stop it, thinkin' you making a profit
Nigga be so out of pocket
Treatin' me like I'm forgotten
No options, feel boxed in
All of my stuff Imma take away
Be no more us when I break away
So act like you know when I walk out that door Imma make away

So eat me, holla when you see me on TV
Shoulda find a better way to treat me
Now you're gonna fuck around and leave me
Remember that shit that we talked pillow talk
Remember that shit when you're watching me walk
Up, 2, watching me roll
I'm leaving' I'm outtie, I'm gone, bye!

[Hook]
First you take away my friends
Then you take away my trust
Then I take away my love
I ain't takin' it no more [x5]

[Verse 2]
See like yesterday, I remember what you said to me
I remember what you did to me
You don't know what you really meant to me
If it was meant to be then
(Sampled from "take away" By Missy Elliott)
"I just Wanna be the perfect Match"
But nah, you just wanna take away
And never give back
In all them years I could never get back

Boy it's over, I'm through
I ain't got no time for you
Standing there without a clue
Say I'm actin' mad new
Remember when you gave that apology
All it was was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never got fly with me
Now he cry for me like Jodeci

[Hook]
First you take away my friends
Then you take away my trust
Then I take away my love
I ain't takin' it no more [x5]

[Verse 3]
Sick of being a fool over you
There's too many dudes, I can pick and choose over you
Tired of singing the blues over you
Promised myself not to blow a fuse but I do
(Sampled from "take away" By Missy Elliott) "I just Wanna be the perfect Match"
Now you sorry cause you blocked off?
You only sorry cause you got caught
I was your lover and your best friend and your biggest fan
Held you down never wanted you to fall off
Stayed out all night, I sent a text
All caps, "WHERE THE FUCK YOU AT BOY?" Whoo-hoo
Stop lying I can see right through you
Wait til I get my hands on you!
Yeah, you had me messed up in the head
But I meant what I said and I ain't gonna trip though
You can bet that I'm packing my shit though
Have a good life, you won't see another tear flow

[Hook]
First you take away my friends
Then you take away my trust
Then I take away my love
I ain't takin' it no more [x5]

[Take away [x16]]
I ain't takin' it no more [x5]
