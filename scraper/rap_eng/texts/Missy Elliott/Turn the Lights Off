[Chorus]
Boy why don't you put the needle on the record
Turn the lights off
Lets get closers than closer than most
Turn the lights off
I think we can get to know each other better
Turn the lights off
And lets grab a glass and make a toast to me

[Verse 1]
You and I, in a room, so dark
Hold me tight, all night, lights off
Kiss me, everywhere, I'd never dreamed
Its like heaven, heaven

[Chorus]
You gotta put the needle back on the record
Turn the lights off
Lets get closers than closer than most
Turn the lights off
I think we can get to know each other better
Turn the lights off
And lets grab a glass and make a toast

[Verse 2]
Here we are, you and me, just us two
I'm feelin high, so high, when I'm round you
Don't hold back, let it go, show me how you feel
Ride it all night, all night, like I'm going

[Chorus]
Put the needle back on the record
Turn the lights off
Lets get closers than closer than most
Turn the lights off
I think we can get to know each other better
Turn the lights off
And lets grab a glass and make a toast

[Missy]
Hit the witch to the light tonight
And make it right like a first class flight
We a light like smoking a pipe
Turn it up like we rockin the mic
You get my hype I feel horny and trife
So polite you might make me your wife
I ain't right the way I'm livin my life
See how I am when you turn off the lights
I gotta jones all down in my bones
I gotta lil twitch up in my spine
And if I let you go and feel on me
You gone have to play this one mo' time

[Chorus] 2x
You gotta put the needle back on the record
Turn the lights off
Lets get closers than closer than most
Turn the lights off
I think we can get to know each other better
Turn the lights off
And lets grab a glass and make a toast
