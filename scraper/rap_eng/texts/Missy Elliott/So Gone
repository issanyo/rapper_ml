[Intro: Will Gunz]
I Dont Know Why Niggas Talkin' Like This A Movie, This A Documentary
*Laughs*

[Verse 1: Will Gunz]

You From The Projects Right? You Should Know Them Starvin' Nights
Them Cold Days I Had To Settle For A Dolla' Slice
Thats When The Money Came, The Work Got Bigger
And If They Bread Wasn't Right Niggas Would Work With Em'
Gaining Another Nigga Gratitude Stands For Gang
Theres More Than That The Ways Of Life You Gotta Understand
This Real Shit, Mother Fucker Can You Feel This
Go Back And Listen To Some Lyrics
From My Passing Me By To Shawny, Franco In Baby
It Seems Clear, Starter Gear Like Its The Late 80's
Was Born In The Hood Prolly Die Here Too
If This Rap Shit Don't Work Cause I Dropped Outta School
This All A Nigga Got Left Besides A Life Of Stress
So Ima Spit My Life Story Till My Last Breath
Ima Get It AnyWay, For Designer Niggas Slaves
Till Then "Its A Phase", But For Now "Its Okay"
"Niggas Die Everyday B" How Ignorant Is That
But If You Saw Your Mans On A Post I Bet You Won't Be Saying' That
Ya Get Me Fed Up With That BullShit
Its Sad To Say The Youth Today Is Strongly Becoming A Nuisance
Im Starting To Dream - Lucid
Get Up From The Bed, Walk Out Of The Door Then Suddenly Out Of The Blue I Wake Up To This Life That Is Ruined
Drugs, Money And The Constitution
Im Tryna' Find My Solution
My Third Eye Won't Open - Pollution
The Shit That We Say, The Look On Your Face It Easily Shows Your Confusion
You Thought I Rap About Jewlery, Flow Fluently
Focued On Tryna' Bring Unity
But Not New World Order
Some Shit About To Go Down Don't Say I Never Warned Ya
You Should Know We Live Painfully, And Why I Say This Shit Blatantly
Momma Told Me "Pray To The Stars" And Then I Thought
You Can't See Stars In New York
