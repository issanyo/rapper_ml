Listen up everyone, we have been just informed
That there's an unknown virus that's attacking all clubs
Symptoms have been said to be, heaving breathing
Wild dancing, coughing
So when you hear the sound, "Who-di-whoo"
Run for cover muthafucka

Woo, ah daddy, ooh, ah, oh, ooh
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
(Ah, ooh)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
(Ah, ah)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
(Ah, ah)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
(Whoo)

Misdemeanor on the flow, pretty boy here I come
Pumps in the bunk make you wanna hurt something
I can take your man I don't have to sex 'em
Hang 'em out the window call me Micheal Jackson
(He, he, he)

I'm a pain in your rectum
I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme splitter, call me Re-Run
Hey hey hey, I'm what's happenin'

Hypnotic in my drink
(That's right)
Shake ya ass till it stink
(That's right)
Mr. Mos' on the beat
(That's right)
Put it down for the streets
(That's right)

(Who-di-whoo)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Come on pass the Dutch, baby
(Ah)
Shake-shake shake ya stuff ladies

(Who-di-whoo)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
(Ah)
Don't stop, get it till ya clothes get wet

Number one drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make you hoomp, boomp, jump
If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn

Oh my God, show 'em I'm large
Shove my beat up, attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'

(Woop, woop)
Don't touch my car alarm
Break in my car you will hear, "Viper Armed"
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
I'm live on stage, c'mon and give me some applause
Thank you, oh thank you, you all are so wonderful

(Who-di-whoo)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Come on pass the Dutch, baby
(Ah)
Shake-shake shake ya stuff ladies

(Who-di-whoo)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
(Ah)
Don't stop, get it till ya clothes get wet

Listen up muthafuckas
You have five seconds to catch your breath
Five, four, three, two, one

Pop that, pop that, make that money
Just keep it going, like the Energizer Bunny
Shake that, shake that, move it all around
Spank that, yank that, dutch back now

Freak him, freak her, whatever ya choice
Didn't come to judge, I came to get ya moist
Scream, now my voice is lost
(Who-di-whoo)
Can I get a ride on the white horse?

(Who-di-whoo)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Come on pass the Dutch, baby
(Ah)
Shake-shake shake ya stuff ladies

(Who-di-whoo)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
(Ah)
Don't stop, get it till ya clothes get wet

Pop that
Pass tha Dutch, baby
Jiggle that fat
