Lil Scrappy, Let's go

[Verse 1: Lil' Scrappy]
Hey Shorty, I like the way you ass it up
I'm only whisperin' cause I'm just tryin to fuck
Ooooh, go' head move that ass
Give a G a chance and let me clog the gap in ya pants
I can tell you a freak by the way that you dance
Yeah, a Triple AAA man
I'm-a grown man, you heard me
You fuckin' with a grown man, hold your legs up baby
Scream my name like a fan, Shh, you ain't got nuttin' to say
Hol' on lil' baby its o-kay-kay-kay
Ahh, some say I'm wrong for fuckin a nigga bitch
The same niggas that do the same shit
Suck my dick quick, gettin' it rich quick
Take this good ass thuggin' and help the nice dick
I'm icy like Gucci I'm bussin' a Uzi
Go on in the pussy, I don't fuck wit the booty
When I'm in the bed still carry my tool-y
Do the Paris Hilton and make a porno movie
I'm groovy, like motherfuckin +Austin+
Look at all the D bras and draws as I'm droppin'

[Chorus: Kaine & D-Roc]
This is the Wait Remix
This is the Wait Remix
Hey Girl, this is the Wait Remix
Cause you couldn't get enough
Like B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.EB.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Yo, Free

[Verse 2: Free]
Hey, how ya doing little dirty, let me whisper in ya ear
Tell ya some shit you might like to hear
Got a nice little pussy and my ass poke out
Automatically, I can ride a dick, no doubt
I'm known for getting all the haters mad
I can go slow, but go crazy fast
I give amazing head
Backside a lil' softer than a baby's ass
Now that's wild soft
I'll let a rich nigga hit it on his golf course
I got a young dude open, that was my fault
I let him see me in my bra and my boy shorts
Now for the freaks in here, it's the remix
Puttin' it down with the Ying Yang Twinz
Last night, I fell in love with an O.G
He crept up on me and this was he told me
He said

[Chorus: Kaine & D-Roc]
This is the Wait Remix
This is the Wait Remix
Hey Girl, this is the Wait Remix
Cause you couldn't get enough
Like B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.EB.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Bussa-Bus baby
Let me holla at ya, shorty

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Before I put my cup on yo ass
You lookin' I could park my truck on yo ass
Shorty, you should go ahead and clap that shit
With yo' big ass makin' me wanna slap that shit
You know what jump in my ride and let's slide
I'm-a beat up the puddy and cook it with a fish filet fry
Now it's time to make you open wide
Like a diamond, fuck like you ain't got no pride
I love it hard, I take you and Alana outside
Fuck you off the edge of the bed landslide
That's right, the way you freaky I wanna Hang-Glide
All on your ass, you tryin' to give me head in my ride
Shhh, Wait, chill, shhh, quiet
Let me finish tellin' you what's goin on, okay?
The way you like to do it, we can fuck to the song
And I'm-a beat the pussy up, 'til it's time to get gone
And before I can end, what I was sayin
She was tryin' to put me onto to her friend
I told her bring her, I'm warning you
I once that said, "Wait 'til the both of you see my dick"

[Chorus: Kaine & D-Roc]
This is the Wait Remix
This is the Wait Remix
Hey Girl, this is the Wait Remix
Cause you couldn't get enough
Like B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.EB.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E, B.M.E
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough
Couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough

[Verse 4: Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott]
When I get up on the track, I'm-a talk a lot a shit
Been a-around the world, I done seen plenty dicks
Small ones, medium, grande baby
One minute, two minute, no way baby
Eat the nookie up, or eat the cookie
I put the "Sugar on his tongue", and that a shut 'em up
I take my clothes down like it's goin' down, like a show down
Show him I can go for 12 rounds on the cold ground
Hey nigga, let me slow it down
Like a stripper on the pole, I can roll it round
Now who that there, wanna tear the nookie up
You betta pull out ya cash, and put more than 50 up c'mon
Cause this here chick ain't gonna let you beat it up
You betta pull out ya cash, and put more than 50 up
Wait 'til you taste my..
Wait 'til you taste my..
Wait 'til you taste my..
Wait 'til you taste my..
You gonna love this good stuff!
