[Intro: Missy]
Ooh, I don't want I don't need I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance be a man take my hand understand
I don't want no minute man

[Verse 1: Missy]
Boy I'mma make you love me, make you want me
And I'mma give you some attention, tonight
Now follow my intuitions, what you're wishing
See I'mma keep you all night, for a long time
Just start counting the ways

[Hook]
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no

[Verse 2: Missy]
Tonight I'mma give it to you, throw it to you
I want you to come prepared, ohhh yeah
Boy it's been a long time, a crazy long time
And I don't want no minute man, and that's real
Give it to me some more

[Hook]
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Fifty grand I get this on one take (Hova)
Look, I'm not trying to give you love and affection
I'm trying to give you sixty seconds of perfection
I'm trying to give you cabfare and directions
Get your independent ass out of here, question
I'm not your man, not Ralph Tresvant
Not Ronnie Romance, no ma
I'm tryna hit you then quit you in the middle of the round
Like I'm Roberto Duran, no mas
Six A.M. another chick in the house put your hands up
6:15 another chick kicked out, put your hands up
Spend one minute tryin to dig her out
The other fourteen tryin to put it in her mouth
The dick too chubby, too much'll make you love me
Now be a nice wifey and run home to your hubby
Cause we both know what we doing is wrong
Don't forget to put your ring back on

[Missy]
Ooh, I don't want I don't need I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance be a man take my hand understand
I don't want no minute man

[Hook]
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, break break me off
Break break me off, show me what you got..
Break me off, show me what you got..
Break me off, show me what you got..
Break me off, show me what you got..
Break me off, break break me off
