(Intro - Timbaland)
Yeah, yeah, check this

(1st Verse - Missy Elliot)
Now I'm in the 9th inning
Thought I fell off ain't quite finished
Yeah I'm 'bout to put my foot in it
Talk with it, walk with it, I'm no gimmick
2012 there'll be no games
Real rap, real pause, I'm not playing
Haters you all lame, you ain't miss a thing
I'm a beast in the booth, I'm just saying
I make 'em wanna get low
Duck with it, buck with it, let's go
Every time I spit a rhyme it's a sick flow
You newcomers better sit back and take note
This here my time. Here I come, better run take what's mine
About to let off like a tech nine
This rhyme gon' make 'em push rewind
Yeah I'm so hot
Up on the charts, number one spot
See me when I drop and I won't flop
Missy never stop got the music game on lock
When I get served
You third, you second but I come first
Flip my verse like I flip birds
I'm fine, Yes Sir

(Chorus)
We hitmakin', hitbreakin', party shakin', innovating
Groundbreakin', sole creatin'. We be the most anticipated
Hitmakin', hitbreakin', party shakin', innovating
Groundbreakin', sole creatin'. We be the most anticipated

(2nd Verse - Timbaland)
Now I'm in the 9th inning
N***** think I fail when I'm still winnin'
So I've been gone for a hot minute
I love this shit, that's why I gotta gift in it
F*** n***** get fly
N**** can't talk with a gun in his mouth
N****s b**** up and they run in their house
I can smell bulls*** when they walk by
Heard that old saying yo
"Never ever cross a one day, give ya most"
Never ever act funny for the white folk
I'm a big fish remember you a tadpole
I like Lady Gaga. Why you let a n**** do your whole album?
Where you think that fake producer got ya style from?!
Come f*** with a n****, watch the outcome
Ain't no real artists
Wack talent get in, real starvin'
All you hear in music is a chorus
Well that's okay Timmy back in the story

(Chorus)

(During Chorus - Missy Elliot)
Y'all can't be serious
We break records, I done told y'all
How many of y'all got a catalogue this long?
Don't worry, I'll wait!

(3rd Verse - Missy Elliot)
Down to the 9th inning
I'm the real deal, y'all pretendin'
Years later my songs still spinnin'
I do record deals no less than ten milli
My hits be yay long
My songs go on like a marathon
Get ghost, get gone, you a dum-dum
Better round here, come on biters like a python
When I act fly
When I act like you better than a M-I
Shakin' em, bakin' em all like a bean pie
Takin' em, burnin' em down like I'm left Left Eye
Futuristic
Y'all can pack it up, I done ripped it
When you say my name call me Miss Bitch
I make the next chick run to the exit
Yeah I got a Sixth Sense
I'm makin' this a movie like a Netflix
I'm on the guest list, on the check list
I'm the flyest chick, now tell me who the best is?!
Elliot be the name
Elliot back in the game
Elliot hit 'em with a BANG!
Bring the hook back in Timbaland

(Chorus)

(Missy Elliot during chorus)
Did y'all forget?! I think they forgot!
They think we done
All we do is make hits?!

(Outro - Missy Elliot)
And if you want a hit? Maybe we'll return your call
Don't call collect
(Operator Voice)
You have a collect call from... (Dial Tone)
