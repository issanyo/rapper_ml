[Intro: Ashlee Simpson & Missy Elliott]
L.O. L.O. L.O. L.O.V.E
L.O. L.O. L.O
Yeah!
This is a Ashlee and Missy Elliott remix
I'm talkin' 'bout love!
Woo!

[Verse 1: Ashlee Simpson]
All my girls stand in a circle and clap your hands
This is for you
Up's and downs, highs and lows
And no matter what you see me through
My boyfriend, he don't answer on the telephone
I don't even know where the hell he goes
But all my girls, we're in a circle
And nobody's gonna break through

[Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
Oh, did you hear me say?
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
Oh, did you hear me say?
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
I'm talking' bout
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
I'm talking' bout

[Post-Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
Say you'll be my girls for life, girls for life
Say you'll be my girls for life, girls for life

[Verse 2: Ashlee Simpson]
Oh hold up, I need another one
I think you, you do too
Grab my bag, got my own money
Don't need any man in this room
My boyfriend, he'll be calling me now anytime
I need all my girls to keep him off my mind
So hold up, we need another one
What we got is all good

[Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
Oh, did you hear me say?
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E

L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
I'm talking' bout love

[Post-Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
Clap your, your, your hands

[Bridge: Ashlee Simpson]
Love is an energy
Love is a mystery
Love is meant to be true
Love is a part of me
Love is the heart of me
Love is the best thing we do
Love is energy, love is a mystery
Love is meant to be true
Love is a part of me, love is the heart of me
Love is the best thing we do

[Post-Bridge: Ashlee Simpson]
All my girls
All my girls

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
C'mon!
Me and my girls, yeah, we got money
We go out to the club when our men's act funny
Put on our Louis Vuittons, we look stunning
Don't blame me if I look good, hunny
See my Jurry shine, I keep the room sunny
Throw on my mind, don't smile, the guys love me
In the club clappin' our hands if they ain't chubby
Other chicks mad 'cause they might look ugly
Ashlee say, "L.O. L.O. L.O. L.O.V.E."
Hello, my loves blow kisses out to me
And they blow kisses to me, 'cause I'm a lil' cutie
And I'm not a lil' flousie, I'm scared you wit da booty
I tried groupies, y'all see how they'd run to me
And I know they wanna do me, I'm hot as a jacuzzi
Now, me and Ashlee, we rock the mic, right?
On the remix, we keep the club hyped
So niggas up in the cut, all night
Me and Ashlee got what the people like

[Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
(I'm talkin' 'bout)
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
