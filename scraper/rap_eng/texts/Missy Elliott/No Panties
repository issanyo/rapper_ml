NEW TRINA!!!!

[Verse 1: Trina]
Look boo, what the deals?
You got my cash, so you stick it in here?
I know you be packin' the steel
But I can't suck ya dick and get my lipstick smeared
Fuck nigga dont be grabbin' my braids
You got some cash? Then I'm easily persuaded
Taste ass these un-sauteed
See I be cummin' all night & all day
Uh Miss Trina, sim seema
Fuck a beamer
Got me benz and some rims
Tinted windows and some tens
I'll tell you time again
I'm fine enough to even fuck your mans
Looky here Slim
I swerve to South Beach let me speak
'Fore you fuck me you gone treat?
And put some Santinees' on my feet
Take me to the beach
Now crawl up in my wall real deep... OWW

[Verse 2: Trina]
Bitch you ain't gotta like me
Oh you his wifey? I think ya man like me
He had me in the car with his hands on my bra
Breathin in my face sayin (TRI - NA!!) OWW!!
I ain't tryin to disrespect
Im just tryin to keep ya in check
See I ain't done yet
Shit - I'm the type of bitch
Break up happy homes like Trick
Slow mo - easy Joe ya so and so
I'm a super woman ask Mo (u know)
The way I ride wood
Super good too good
And if your man won't you're daddy would
Bitch understood Slip N Slide - Miss Trina
Did sold out the arena
I'm a dead ringer
Three fingers, dig deeper
All up in my gut nigga what?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trina]
Hey nigga whats the word?
Watch my hips dont you like these curves?
I want a crib in the deep suburbs
Two dogs and a mockingbird
Versace spread on my waterbed
Now give me some head!!! (OOOH!!)
Give me some head!!! (OOOH!!!)
Miss Trina like to skits on red
And I'm the first to say it
I'm the baddest bitch OW!
