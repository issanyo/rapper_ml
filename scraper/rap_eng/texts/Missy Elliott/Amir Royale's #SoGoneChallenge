A-Rod—
Blues Bell Music by the way
LaGuardia High School representing
New York U, Clive Davis 2-0-2-0
We ain't nothing new bro
Straight up, check...

[Verse 1]
This prelude is 'bout this mei nu I met up at ReMu
You know who you are
They want more then I'll make you the sequel
But before we move out to SoHo
I thought I would drop this on the low
To show 'em I still got flow
Cause they doubt I can beat 'em
Me a grammatical cannibal
Animal, who eats MCs like Hannibal
Animaniac lyricism, my shit is so Wakko
Ya'll could walk and flock to the studio
I'll be there at five on the dotto
Now, this thing supposed to be about a girl that I got
This thing supposed to be about another girl but it's not
Unless you think all of my music spiritual and it's hot
Cause honestly she's all I got, she my rock
I'm so in pocket, bullshit do not phase me
My baby, got me feeling so crazy
Enough of that, let me quit with the basics
And get you elated, girl I can make you dance
Like I'm Zapp, Roger—persuasive
Was into Bianca stronger than Blanka before I met you
I think that we played games more times than we actually met
You and me would always fight 'bout how to talk in Crayola
I'd be like, "Yellow", but you wouldn't notice
You was blue 'bout some things
So I read you some things I wrote
And told you I wanted the world green
More than I wanted gold, you remember?
That was before we fell out, we better now

[Verse 2]
I always extend my hand to catch all your pressure
I get ahead of myself and then end up neglecting
I'd give you all my extensions just so you could use 'em
I'd give you all my attention but you don't wanna be truthful
Sick of this like it's syphilis, sitting here with your pictures
Thinking that I should rip 'em
And switch up like your emotions
When you feeling indifferent
I wish all this went different
I wish all this shit was just simple
I recognize how Magnificent
Wouldn't even be shit without you
That whole shit's about you, you deserve all the credit
You incredible at getting every second of the stress
Up out your head, not forgetting you need to dress up
Just to go get your blessings
Heavens, your essence is the best
Girl you expressive, festive
These other girls robotic, you aquatic
You got it and girl you know you got it—you got it?
Go and get your goals, then go and buy some clothes
Then go and make your homie's head roll, oh
I'd buy you some roses, but you know you don't need those
Nevermind, stop 'fore I impose
I told you back when we had beef
When we was kosher, to know yourself
Ain't from the 6th, but we born on a seven
My old girl born on the fourth
Without regretting said I never get the messages
I send and preach
I'm always letting my head get bigger and aggressive as shit
Ego always need stroking but it's only cause I act like a bitch about everybody else's problems
They ain't mine to resolve but, she's right everytime
I rest my case—cause these words ain't gonna replace
Mother's without their sons and officers losing face
My gosh... let me let that line breathe

[Verse 3]
D-Hall told me to write this
I'd tried to shake it, but it's a craving and it tastes great
While authentic at the heart, it's got pride
Girl this art is my only life
I walk out across a stage and the feel lights of God
My mother's eyes and probably all of my kinfolk
I wish all this was so simple, I pray you forgive my sins
Cuz my father had raised me well
And I swear that this isn't his fault
So matter fact this ain't for fame, this is for Dulcey
This is for Papa, 'cause Jharrel is the homie
This is for Vito's mother and all that she's holding
This for Alprentice mother, cause you know your boy golden
Know that he golden

[Verse 4]
My boy D-Hall told me to write this, so, I'm finally writing
I'm thinking 'bout if I'll be flying to you in a couple years
Cause if I can afford it then
Then my dreams will finally be clear
Reimagined, young dragon
The last dragon in action, tryna create a faction
That'll at least save a fraction of Hip-Hop
We soaring the future
But we'll hit you with the bruise, like Lee
Stop me, they cannot do it, I am Nike
I will not pause 'til I'm the king
And they're playing my stuff to sing
And showing my face on screens and telling my story
Cause I'm storytelling
Share this story to whoever got better impressions
I hope you somehow get this message
It's important that the world hears it
It's not meant to be impressive
It's just my mind is lucid and loose
But surely we losing
I hope this touches your heart
Cause you know I wouldn't misuse it
Turned the Internet to a museum
Just so you could view it, so view it Blue

[Outro]
My gosh, my gosh

Peace and Blessings
Love to you all
