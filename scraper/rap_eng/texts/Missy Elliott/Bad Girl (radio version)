(Aubrey)
Look in my eyes covered in Maybelline
Looking like something fresh out of a magazine
I can be part of your deepest fantasies
You're the detective, come solve my mystery

(D. Woods)
Some say that love is all that I'm missing
Some call it jezebel, I call it attention
But what they don't know, they can't even imagine
Say I don't have self-esteem but it's my passion

(Group)
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me
I, I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me

Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

(Dawn)
Something about me has got you hypnotized
Examine my body like you're the science guy
Watching my every move, you anticipate
What you're thinking about boy, I can recreate

(Aundrea)
Some say that love is all that I'm missing
Some call it jezebel, I call it attention

Maybe I'm just a bad girl

(Missy Elliot)
I know you looking for a b-a-d c-h-i-c
Looking so sexy, make â€˜em pay me
She not me, 'cuz there just one me
I'm the M to the I double S, Y, E
When the lights come on I tran-transform
Gimme that, baby come, come on!
I could do it all night to the break of dawn
On, on, and on, I keep on going
They call me a jezebel
'Cause I freaks, I does it well
Got extensions in my hair
Bad girls is y'all up in here
Tonight we gon' just let it do what it do
I can flip this pretty young thing on you
I ain't looking for attention I just want you
Lemme be your addiction, I can be that too

(Group)
I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me
I, I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me

Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform

From a caterpillar to a butterfly
I know I got something that you gonna like
Don't be afraid, I won't let you down
I'm the one that'll make you come around
