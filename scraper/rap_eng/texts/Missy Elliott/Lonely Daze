[Intro]
Oh oh
Can we try
Oh

[Hook]
Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay


Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay

[Verse 1]
Listen
Sit back, relax your mind, your dinner is waiting
The more I see you girl my heart beat is pacing
New lovers mentally we knew what we were thinking
No waiting all night long, let's start the love making
Can we try?

[Hook]
Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
I love you baby come with me
'Cause I love you
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay
I'm gonna make you stay
Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
Can we try?
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay

[Verse 2]
One chance is all I need to have you forever
I'll wait forever girl until the twelfth of never
If I could do it I would carry your baby nine months long
But I'm a man no doubt darlin'
And you are my lady

[Hook]
Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay
I'm gonna make you stay
Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
All the things I wanna do to you baby
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay

[Bridge]
I'm tryin' to figure out, what this love thing is all about?
Can we be as one?
Help me to know your so fine baby be mine
I wanna tell you girl, it's your love I only seek
And it's the one that's meant for G'
Baby I'm sorry, please stay don't you leave
Stay don't you leave me

[Hook+Outro]
'Cause I want you baby
Anything I've done, I'm sorry
I'll climb a mountain, swim a shore
Anything you want from me
I'll give you that and much, much more
Yes I will baby
Come on
If you want I'll kiss the ground that you walk on
Cause that's just how much I love you
All I ever wanted to do is make you happy baby
Tonight I want you by my side
