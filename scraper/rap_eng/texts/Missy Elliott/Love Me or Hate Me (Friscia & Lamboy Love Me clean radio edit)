Yeah. It's officially the biggest midget in the game
I dunno
Make way for the S O V

Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!

I'm fat, I need a diet
No, in fact I'm just too light
And I ain't got the biggest breasts
But I write all the best disses
I got hairy armpits
But I don't walk around like this
I wear a big baggy t-shirt that hides that nasty shit
Ugh!

Never had my nails done
Bite them down until they're numb
I'm the one with the non-existent bum
Now I dont really give a....
Ugh!

I'm missin' my shepherd's pie
Like a high maintenance chick missin' her diamonds
I'm missin' my clippers size
Now bow down to your royal highness
No I don't own a corgi
Had a hamster, it died 'cos I ignored it
Go on then, go on report me
I'm English, try and deport me!

I'm that funky little monkey with the tiniest ears
I don't like drinkin' fancy champy
I'll stick wit' Heineken beers
Whoops, might burp in ya face
A little unlady-like
What can I say
Well oh gosh I'm not posh, male wit' odd socks
I do what I'm doin YEAH!

So everybody's entitled to opinions
I open my mouth and shit I got millions
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid
I'll make you giggle 'til you're sick
'Cos my nose jiggles while I spit
Yeah I do have some stories
And its true I want all the glory
Go on then, come on support me
I'm English, try and deport me!

So I can't dance and I really can't sing
I can only do one thing
And that's be Lady Sovereign!
