[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Tell me how long is it, boo?
Seven inches—yep, that'll do (C'mon)
Don't want another, not another lover (lover)
'Cause you the type of brother I get freaky undercover (yeah)
Let me be the one for ya, playa
Let's see what's behind them Gucci underwears
What I gotta do, baby? What I gotta say? (Say)
To the bedroom, okay, kay, kay (okay)

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
Tell me what I gotta say
Tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I'm about to make a move
'Cause baby, I just want to be the one
Tell me how you want it, babe
Maybe we could spend the day there
Let me know what's the place
Baby, I just want to be the one

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need another
I could spend my life being your lover
Think about it, take some time
Put your eyes together
We can make this thing right
'Cause I don't want no other
I just wanna be the one

[Chorus]
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh
Baby, I just wanna be the one for you
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh
Baby, I just wanna be the one for you

[Verse 3: Janet Jackson]
Let me know what you're missing, boy
So I can be the one there for you
Talkin' 'bout being all you want
Baby, I just wanna be the one
After you meet my stipulations
Hop in the yacht, mystical vacation
To put the list, ain't no replacing ya
'Cause baby, I just wanna be the one

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need another
I could spend my life being your lover
Think about it take some time
Put your eyes together
We can make this thing right 'cause I don't want no other
I just wanna be the one

[Chorus]
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh
Baby, I just wanna be the one for you
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh

Really wanna uh
Baby, I just wanna be the one for you

[Interlude: Janet + (Missy)]
You...you...you (What a minute, shawty)
You (For you) you (For you)
I just wanna be the one for you

[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
Baby, I'll do any little thing for you
Tell your ex-girlfriend, I say "Bye, boo boo" (C'mon)
Chicks can't see me, I'm way too smooth
But I'm like a loose goose, we can shoop dooby doop
Let'cha hit the poo poo, do what it do
The nookie got them boys goin' goin' cuckoo
I'm sick like the flu, too—what, I thought you knew?
And we could have a threesome, bring a cute friend, too
Trips to Anguilla, guantanamera
Look in the mirror, no chick can love you better
Now who could love you better when we're together?
I'll be your Cinderella, you'll be my fella
What I gotta say to make you say "okay"?
I shake my booty, I shake my booty

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need another
I could spend my life being your lover
Think about it, take some time
Put your eyes together
We can make this thing right 'cause I don't want no other
I just wanna be the one

[Chorus]
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh
Baby, I just wanna be the one for you
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh
Baby, I just wanna be the one for you

Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh
Baby, I just wanna be the one for you
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh uh
Really wanna uh
Really wanna uh
Baby, I just wanna be the one for you
