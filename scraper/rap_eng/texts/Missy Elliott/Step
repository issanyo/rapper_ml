[Intro]
All I want is a little respect
All I need is a little respect

[Verse 1]
Have you ever had a girl to call up your man?
Better tell her step back, step back
She claiming that your man is her man
Gotta get her wig knocked way back
But you gotta act right and not let it lack now
I'm a lover, not a fighter
But if she keep on disrespecting, I might just
She violate, I got the right to strike her

[Chorus]
Yeah
Come up out of these heels
Take it, pull my hair back
I know I need to chill
All I want is a little respect
Ladies know how it feels
When another girl violates that
Know when it's my man y’all
You better tell that girl to step

[Verse 2]
You know them type of chicks that walk by
Better tell her keep on walking
Twist to the side to catch your mans eye
Turn around to see if he watching
Those them type of girls you set straight
If you don't they will keep walking
But you better shut her down before it's to late now
Tell her she don't want no problems

[Chorus]
Yeah
Come up out of these heels
Take it, pull my hair back
I know I need to chill
All I want is a little respect
Ladies know how it feels
When another girl violates that
Know when it's my man y’all
You better tell that girl to step

[Bridge]
I am not the one to be played with
Tell that girl to step
I ain't got no time for the bull shit
You should learn some respect (I think you need to learn some respect)
Cause if a girl came clocking your man
You wouldn't like that
I'm not one to go and start fights (go and start fights, I’m not the type)
You gotta cop your own cause this one is mine

[Chorus]
Yeah
Come up out of these heels
Take it, pull my hair back
I know I need to chill
All I want is a little respect
Ladies know how it feels
When another girl violates that
Know when it's my man y’all
You better tell that girl to step

[Outro]
All I want is a little respect
All I need is a little respect
