Owwww!

(Space & Missy)
I break your bones and your gristles
Get high as a missle blowin' like a whistle
Pull my titties like a pistol
Bang bang let me hear Total sang
Swang ya diggly a ling okay I swing my pun tang
The kind that rock in my '98 drop
Niggas (skate!) feel my head bop
Hit me off with that New Total Rock that New Total Rock

(Keisha)
I like my man lookin' cute in some boots
Dirty boots, Tommy jeans
Baggy jeans, wit' some cream
If you know what I mean
(Boy you move too fast)
He drive a truck that he can thump
Smokin' skunk, in the seats of his Jeep
But he's fresh cause the nigga feelin' on my knee
(Oooh)

Chorus

Boy you move too fast
Get your foot up off the gas
Don't be feelin' on my ass

Boy you move too fast
Get your foot up off the gas
Don't be feelin' on my ass

(Keisha)
I like my man in the club, lookin' thug
He's a thugg-a fly guy from the Southside
And he wanna kick it wit' me
(beep, beep, vrrrrmmmmmmm, aye yo aye yo)
He's on the cell phone, and the boy's gonna blow shit
I'll be gettin' crunk if the boy want my booty

Chorus

Boy you move too fast
Get your foot up off the gas
Don't be feelin' on my ass

Boy you move too fast
Get your foot up off the gas
Don't be feelin' on my ass

(Space)
Mama say, mama sah, mama ma cusa
Total is the best you've heard thust far
Maybe we smoke too much Budah
If you say f**k me, I say f**k ya
Mama say, mama sah, mama ma cusa
Total is the best you've heard thust far
Maybe we smoke too much Budah
If you say f**k me, I say f**k ya

The new Total rock

Take it take it to the top
