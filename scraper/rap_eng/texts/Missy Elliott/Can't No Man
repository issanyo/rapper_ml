Mmm, mmm, mmm yeah

I can't let you go babe
I don't think that I could (I never could)
Cuz everytime I try to forget you
I think about the sex is too good (yeah)
The way you hold my body babe
There's no other man that could
And even if he tried to turn me on
I don't think that he would, yeah

Can't no feet fill your shoes
Ain't no other man can rock me like you do
They can try to huff and puff and blow you down
But when we make love baby, you mark your ground

Can't feet fill your shoes
Ain't no other man can rock me like you do
They can try to huff and puff and blow you down
But when we make love baby, you mark your ground

But when I see your face babe

Cuz there's no other man
That be pleasing me
And not only are you incredible
