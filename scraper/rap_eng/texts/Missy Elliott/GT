Verse:[?],  Up all night,  party on the east side

X pill vibes floating like a fifth tire

She slow wind it tighter than a zip tie, Up all night

Trying to get a head start on the weekend, bass knock treble peaking

Say you want what you say you want, but you can't keep up when
I'm leading

Just be honest and say what you want from me

Instead of egging this shit on with me

Instead of misled animosity , stay down for me and that's all of me

Been practicing, practice , we not talking bout' the game but practice

Asking all these questions like you Allen

Answer to them all is why you asking

Baby ,tell me what u need then, say its love then why you leaving

Maybe it’s warranted , but

Coin will flip sometimes and maybe it’s not

Maybe it’s me on your mind

Maybe the time that l spent wasn’t time in your mind just reminders of it 

Chorus: Racing , Gt style through life,  l know ain't shit, gone wait not

No nights, if l ain’t shit , ain’t shit gone go right .... I been out here too

Long , I made tools that do two way harm.. I’m not here to Debate

This, love is hurt I been there too long


Bridge : Your Love is one in a million , it goes on and on and on

You give me a really good feeling, all day long [2x]


Chorus: Racing , Gt style through life,  l know ain't shit, gone wait not

No nights, if l ain’t shit , ain’t shit gone go right .... I been out here too

Long , I made tools that do two way harm.. I’m not here to Debate

This, love is hurt I been there too long. [2x]
