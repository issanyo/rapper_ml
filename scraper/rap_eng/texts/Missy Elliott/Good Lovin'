[Verse 1]
One sunny, sunny morning
When my man's right by my side
Held me closely, so close I felt love inside
It's like paradise when he called me his favorite girl
And for sure, he’s my favorite boy
And I’ll be there when he needs me
To be like no other woman gives you joy

[Chorus]
('Cause I’ll give him)
Good love to you
Sweet love to you
(Sweet love)
There when you say
(There when you say)
Gotta do for you
(Gotta do for you)
Hold onto you
(Hold on to you)
Right here for you
(Ooh)
(Good lovin')
Good love to you
(Good love to you)
Sweet love to you
(Sweet love)
There when you say
(I’m there, I’m there)
Gotta do for you
(Gotta do for you)
Hold onto you
(Hold on to you)
Right here for you
(Right here, oh)

[Verse 2]
When you come home from work baby (baby)
I’ll be here to run your bath
You ain't gotta ask me once I want this stuff to last
It’s the least I can do for you
I’m here till the day we die, boy
'Cause this feeling is so real to me
You’re my lover, my friend and it's more than I dreamed
So I’m right here to give you

[Chorus]
(So all I wanna do is give you)
Good love to you
(Sweet love)
Sweet love to you
There when you say
(There when you say)
I gotta do for you
(Gotta do for you)
Hold on
(Hold on to you)
Right here
(Right here for you)
I’ll be right here for you baby
When you need me, just call me, sweet love
(Good love to you)
Oh yeah
(Sweet love to you)
There when he say
(There when he say)
I gotta do for you
(Gotta do for you)
I gotta hold onto you
(Hold on to you)
I’m right here for you
(Right here)
Ohh
(I’ll give good, I’ll give good, I’ll give good)
(I’ll give good love to you)

[Bridge]
I’m willing to share my world
(Said, "I’m willing to share my world with you baby, baby, baby, baby")
For my man I’ll give you the world
(Said, "I’ll give you the world and I’ll tell everybody, I’m not ashamed")
You’re my man and I’m your girl
(I’m your girl baby, whatever you need)
More than willing to share my whole world
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah baby)

[Chorus]
Good love to you
Sweet love to you
(Sweet love)
There when you say
I gotta do for you
(I gotta do for you, baby)
Hold onto you
Right here for you
(Said, "I get so happy inside, yeah, yeah")
Good love to you
(Oh, baby)
Sweet love to you
(Can't you tell?)
There when you say
(I’m there, I’m there)
Gotta do for you
(Said, "I gotta do")
Hold on to you
(Hey, yeah, yeah)
Right here for you
(I gotta hold onto you baby)
(Because I love you yeah)
Said, "I gotta go now"
