[Verse 1]
It's 2:11 and I'm stressing
Watching TV in my hotel suite
I check my service every second
At 2:10 you still hadn't called me
So I'm gonna leave my cell phone
Turned on in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check my machine
Again and again 'cause I'm
Obsessing on you

[Chorus]
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll

[Verse 2]
Zoning out, thinking about you and me between the sheets
I wanna get intimate, but you're not within my reach
So I'll have a little more wine
And I'll try to drink you out of my head
And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough I can
Forget all about you until
I wake up again

[Chorus]
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll

[Verse 3]
Slipping into dreams
I feel my love surround you
My subconscious seems
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me?
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
'Cause I won't be waiting long

[Chorus until Fade]
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and cuddle up next to me
Come on and be my babydoll
