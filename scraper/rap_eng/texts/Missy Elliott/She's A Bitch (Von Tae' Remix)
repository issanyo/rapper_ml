[Intro]
She's a bitch
He's that nigga
She's a bitch
Uh, check it

[Verse 1: Von Tae']
Imma make it hot til' it burn like to a fire
Lay you on ya back With ya head to the sky
Imma lay you flat like a fresh pair of tracks
Nigga been hot since sippin’ Similac
And I got more jewels than a jeweler
Skinny nigga but my dick l long like a ruler
Take notes while I school ya
This nigga name stay in more mouths than a rumor

[Chorus: Von Tae']
(He’s that nigga) When you say my name
Talk mo' junk but won't look my way
(He’s that nigga) see I got more cheese
So back on up while I roll up my sleeves

(He’s that nigga) you can't see me, Joe
Get on down while I shoot my flow (He’s that nigga)
When I do my thing, got the place on fire
Burn it down to flame

[Outro: Von Tae']
Can you hear me now? (3xs)
