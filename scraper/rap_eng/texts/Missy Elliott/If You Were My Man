First time I saw ya face, I must admit
It broke my heart to know you had another chick
I know you won't believe I made this up
But I saw her last night leaving with another dude at the club

And I always knew one day
That she would hurt ya
But please, don't shed a tear
Because baby, she don't deserve you

And ooh, if you be my man
I treat you betta than she ever can
She's gonna break your heart

I can give you all the love
She don't give you, baby
And I promise that you won't miss her
When I am ya lady

And I betcha
Betcha, betcha
I can love you betta
Betta, betta, ooh, yeah

Now that she's out the way
Boy, we can share
Just gimme your heart
I promise I'll take good care

I can give it to ya, lemme give it to ya
I can make ya look betta
I can give it to ya, lemme give it to ya
I can do ya much betta, baby

Ooh, if you be my man
I treat you betta than she ever can
She's gonna break your heart

I can give you all the love
She don't give you, baby
And I promise that you won't miss her
When I am ya lady

And I betcha
Betcha, betcha

Betta, betta, ooh, yeah

See baby, she can't love you like I do
She just a chick tryna be like me
You wanna go and hang around all dem crazy fools
'Cause in ya face she shake a booty

See baby, that's not I, I'm a classy girl
Guaranteed boy, to rock ya world
So letta go, letta go, I'm just lettin' ya know

Ooh, if you be my man
I treat you better than she ever can
She's gonna break your heart

And I promise that you won't miss her
When I am ya lady
