[Verse 1:]
Stop thinking the worst
Be more of a winner
If you wanna set your mind to it
Then believe God for it
Stop thinking you lost
When the game ain't even started
You'll never get it if you can't see it
Before you ever receive it

[Pre-Chorus:]
(Now dance if you believe it)
(let's dance before you get it)
Go-getters will reap and sow it better
Don't talk but be about it

[Chorus:]
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead
Don't think about it
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead
Have faith in Him
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead
Go get what's yours

[Verse 2:]
Stop thinking you can't
Be more of a soldier
Believe you're more than conquerors
In Him that loved us

Stop looking to man
He's limited in understanding
He might have the same problems
And he may need the same answers

(Now dance if you believe it)
(let's dance before you get it)
Go-getters will reap and sow it better
Don't talk but be about it

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You've been thinkin' 'bout some extra dollars
All you gotta do is scream and holler like you got it;
(its on its way, go on and get your dance on)

You've been thinkin' 'bout some peace and favor
All you gotta do is keep the faith and you'll get it
(yeah, yeah, keep the faith)

[Rap: Missy Elliott]
Hold up, stop, now wait a minute
Ain't no stoppin' 'til Missy finish
Turn my mike up so the whole church can hear it
Ain't no talkin' 'bout it, we 'bout to be about it
Let's work it, we gon' work it
We gon' praise dance all up in the churches
Now we gon' rock the service
All night 'til the pastor do a sermon
Now hop, slide
Step to the right, you try it
Now hop, slide
Praise Him all night, we ain't tired!

[Chorus]

Go on, put your bags up, and don't worry about it
Go! And believe! don't think about it!
Don't worry about a thing, thing, thing
Go ahead, get the battle
Go ahead, get about it
Go ahead, you can take it
Go ahead, you can make it
