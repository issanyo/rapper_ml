Verse 1(Chilli):
Woke up this morning' and I'm all alone
Wiped out my eyes and the TV's on
Looking at myself on a talk show
Asking me about some video
Talking about some rumor they heard
Got y'all believing like that's the word (what)
That's the word? (like that's the word)
Got me in love like Urkle the nerd
(Could it be I'm still in love)
Oh! could it be I'm still in love (ow!)

Chorus(2x):
You got me going straight jack boy
I can't help it
I can't shake it (oh no!)
Don't wanna make me
Don't make me (oh no!)

Verse 2:
Popping up at my home
Saying things you shouldn't say
Then it backfired in your face
Talking 'bout love but it don't mean nothing
Here we go at it again
Tried my best to hold on
Still you sing that same old song
But I don't wanna see your face no more, ow (come on)

Chorus(2x)
Verse 3: Missy
You can catch me in the A-(hey!) T-L (hey!)
Ridin' around with the (hey!) chrome on my grill (hey!)
Fresh lit dress like a (wwwooo) billion bills (hey!)
Got my straight jacket(hey!)
Shorty but chill (wwOoooo)
I be on the straight jack (hey!)
Tighter than some dress slacks (hey!)
Runnin' like some Ex-Lax (hey!)
Swinging like a ball bat (hey!)
You can get with this (hey!)
Or you can get with that (hey!)
Let 'em hit it once
Watch the shorty come back (wwwooo)
I wrote a song about it now
Do you wanna hear it boy
Trynna roll up on me
I don't wanna hear (hey!) it boy
Boy you just a lil' boy (hey!)
Trynna be a big boy
Yeah I'm a woman man
I ain't got no time for it (woooo)
Sing the chorus
