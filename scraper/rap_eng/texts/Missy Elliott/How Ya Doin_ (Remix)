[Chorus: All]
Hey, how ya doing? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and we'll get back to you
Hey, how ya doing? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and we'll get back to you

[Verse 1: Leigh-Anne & (Jade)]
Ain't got no time for what you think can be described as love
How could you hold on me, you're missing me, I've had enough
It's been so long since you have treated me like I deserved
So long (long), baby I'm gone (gone), you can leave a message for me after the tone (oohh)

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]
You called, I missed it
You called, I missed it
You called, and I missed it
Never get back, getting tired of listening

[Chorus: All]
Hey, how ya doing? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and we'll get back to you
Hey, how ya doing? Sorry we don't mean to be rude
Why don't you leave your name and your number and we'll get back to you

[Pot-Chorus: Jade]
I know that you keep calling my phone
But baby there ain't nobody home
So won't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you

[Verse 2: Perrie with (Jade)]
I'm through with wishing things with you and me could be so good
Time to wake up boy no makeups can make me a fool
Too much history, now it comes down to one thing
So long (long), baby I'm gone (gone), you can leave a message for me after the tone (oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]
You called, I missed it
You called, I missed it
You called, and I missed it
Never get back, getting tired of listening

[Chorus: All & (Jade)]
(Hey) Hey, how ya doing? (doing) Sorry you can't get through
(Oh whoa) Why don't you leave your name and your number (your number) and we'll get back to you (we'll get back to you)
Hey, how ya doing? Sorry we don't mean to be rude (oh yeah)
Why don't you leave your name and your number (number) and we'll get back to you

[Post-Chorus: Jade]
I know that you keep calling my phone
But baby there ain't nobody home
So won't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Now listen boy you can never play miss got my mind twisted
Whenever I don’t answer you be leaving messages
You don’t do me right cause you got way too many chicks
You get the wrong number “brrr” it’s unlisted
I’m change my digits, I’m keep the distance
Oh now you want me back, you want to pay a visit
You get the dial tone, click-click
Brand new song here yeah Missy with Little Mix
Yeah I used to hold you down, I don’t want you around
Cause I won’t play that, you just sold me the clown
Boy it’s over now, yeah it’s over now
And when you call, I’m send you to my voicemail

[Chorus: All & (Jade)]
(Oh) Hey, (hey) how ya doing? (doing) Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number (your number) and we'll get back to you (Hey, yeah)
Hey, how ya doing? Sorry we don't mean to be rude (Sorry we don't mean to be rude)
Why don't you leave your name and your number and we'll get back to you

[Outro: Jesy & Jade]
We'll get back to you
Never get back, never gonna get back
Never get back, never gonna get back
(Aaaah) Never get back, never gonna get back
Never get back, never gonna get back (yeah)
Never get back, never gonna get back
Never get back, never gonna get back
Never get back, (Mmmmh) never gonna get back
Never get back to you
