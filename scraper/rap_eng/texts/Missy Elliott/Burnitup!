[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Whooo, I'ma shut this down
Kitty kat, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Hit it with the he, to the he to the how
Miss Jackson, oh she wear the crown
Brand new sound, got a brand new style
Coming with the banger like Boom Boom Pow
Wow, ooh, ooh, ooh, child
Janet Jackson come soon to your town

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
I am never gon', gonna go nowhere
Quit actin' brand new, you know I've been right here
Lately I've been on, on a mission yeah
But that don’t mean I’ve forgotten how to move you
Yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson]
So tell me what you wanna do? Louder
But don't do nothin' stupid
What is happening in front of you
All it is is love on the move

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
When the DJ play this we gon' dance like no one's watching
Hey Mr DJ, drop that track and won't you turn it up
I'ma dance all night and I don't care who's out there watching us
Just give me that fire and I'ma show you how to burn it up

[Post-Chorus]
Let your body burn it all up
Burn it up and burn it all up
Let your body, burn it all up
That's how I burn it up

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
Ain’t no sitting down, gotta keep it up
Me and Missy got the whole room jumping off (that's right)
Instant motion from the second it drops
We got a headbanger, the beat is so hot, hot

[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson]
So tell me what you wanna do? Louder
But don't do nothin' stupid
What is happening in front of you
All it is is love from the booth

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
When the DJ play this we gon' dance like no one's watching
Hey Mr DJ, drop that track and won't you turn it up
I'ma dance all night and I don't care who's out there watching us

When the DJ play this we gon' dance like no one's watching
Hey Mr DJ, drop that track and won't you turn it up

[Post-Chorus]
Let your body burn it all up
Burn it up and burn it all up
Let your body, burn it all up

[Bridge: Missy Elliot]
Missy!
Now this your jam, now do your dance
This that jam, now do your dance
If this that jam, now do your dance

Make it work, make it work, make it work (work)
Make it work, make it work, make it work (drop that)
Make it work, make it work, make it work (come on, girls)
Make it work, make it work, make it work (sing this song with me)

[Verse 3: Janet Jackson]
Tonight, we gon' come all together
Let me see your hands up high

Wanna come with me and take a ride
(Hurt your body, burn it up more)
Baby this is how I do it

Ah, now bring that beat back, Mr DJ

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]

Burn it up and burn it all up
