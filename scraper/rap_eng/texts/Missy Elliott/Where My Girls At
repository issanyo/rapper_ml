[Verse 1: Kameelah]
See, he's my property
And any girl that touch
I might just call your bluff
'Cause I don't give a...
Who are you to call my cell?
Oh, I'ma wish you well
'Cause any girl that tried has failed, oh

[Chorus]
Where my girls at?
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that
So, don't play yourself
Where my girls at?
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that

[Verse 2: Kameelah]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't you violate me
'Cause I'ma make you hate me
If you decide to mess with mine
Chop you down to size
Make you realize
You done messed up this time

[Chorus]
Where my girls at?
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that
So, don't play yourself
Where my girls at?
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that

[Bridge]
You must learn the rules
Don't come close to
Anything that belongs to me
He is mine
My property
So you must leave

[Chorus]
Where my girls at?
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that
So, don't play yourself
Where my girls at?
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that

[Chorus]
Where my girls at?
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that
So, don't play yourself
Where my girls at?
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that
