Eh yo Mary, i need you to vibe wit me on this one, uh
Uh
[Missy Elliot]
Check it
As i grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God im hot as the water like a preacher whos sinned
Im only human but
The world has put me on a platform since the day i was born
To only wait for my downfall but like a brick wall im too hard to brake
Ok i do make mistakes but im the realest from the fake
Thats why im the hardest to hate
I live baby girl i've learned to love those while ther still awake
Sleep Sleep
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood
Give to those who are misunderstood
I know like Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still No1
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader a teacher i gotta, like a single parent provider
Put in back those hip hop dividers
Like a preist with a back slider
I've sinned ut i win
And anyone we've lost in life from 9-11
We'll be sure to see again
[Mary J. Blige]
What you hear is not a test, im rockin to the beat [x2]
See me and my crew, and my friends were gonna try to move our feet
See i am Mary Blige and i'll like to say hello
To the black to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
First you gotta................first you gotta
