[Intro: Whitney Houston & (Missy Elliott)]
Oh yes boy (say yes)
Ooh yeah (oh yes)
Oh say yes boy (say yes)
Ooh yeah (uh uh uh uh)
Turn me up
Ooh yeah (yes)
Oh yes
Yes

[Verse 1]
The day you held me in your arms
I still smell the scent of you
On my dress, unbelievable
And you were so masculine
The way I felt your chest up next to mine
Felt you in my heart
And now I breathe your love

[Hook (X2)]
You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, daily

[Post-Hook]
Yes, yes, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, yes, Yes

[Verse 2]
The time you looked into my eyes
I felt like falling in love
And I was mesmerized
'Cause it's something that you do baby
That makes me feel this way
And I can't explain
You're my joy, my peace, my happiness
And you, you, you, you baby

[Hook (X2)]

[Post-Hook (X2)]

[Bridge (X2)]
You're the best lover I ever knew
Can't nobody do me like you do
Put that all on my last dime
No one else worth none of my time
Everything about you I love
You were sent from the skies above
You came here to rescue me
And now I'm free

[Hook (X4)]
