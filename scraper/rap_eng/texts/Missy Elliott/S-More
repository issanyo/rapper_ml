[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I was thinking about you last night
And when you left last night, you left me satisfied
It takes two to tango
Tell me can you handle
Come on, you know
You know you want s-more

[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
You know you want s-more
You know you want s-more
(You know you want some more)
And if you want s-more, open up my door
You know you want s-more
You know you want s-more
(Open up my door, babe)
And if you want s-more, open up my door

[Post-Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
(I hear you...) I hear you knocking at my door
Let's me know you want more (You want more)
Come and get it if you're with it
I'll touch you how you like it
Is it sensitive? Do you wanna give
Give s-more, open my door

[Verse 2: K-Ci]
Lady, lady, lady, you were bragging on the phone
About the things you could do to me when we're alone
Baby, baby, you know what I got to give
Do you want it? Do you want it?
Tell me if...

[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
You know you want s-more
You know you want s-more
(You know you want some more)
And if you want s-more, open up my door
You know you want s-more
You know you want s-more
(You know, you know, you know, you know you want...)
And if you want s-more, open up my door

[Post-Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
I hear you knocking at my door
Let's me know you want more
Come and get it if you're with it
I'll touch you how you like it
Is it sensitive? Do you wanna give
Give s-more, open my door
I hear you knocking at my door

[Outro: K-Ci + (Jodeci)]
Baby, knocking baby, knocking baby, knocking baby
You know you knocking
And you want s-more, I know you want s-more
You want s-more, you want s-more, baby
I hear you... (Open up my door)
I...I hear you knocking, baby; I hear you knocking, baby
Nothing in the world, nothing, nothing in the world
Can make you feel the way I make you feel, baby
(You know you want s-more, You know you want s-more...)
(You know you want s-more, You know you want s-more...)
(You know you want s-more, You know you want s-more...)
