[Intro: All]
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform

[Verse 1: Aubrey]
Look in my eyes covered in Maybelline
Looking like something fresh out a magazine
I can be part of your deepest fantasies
You're the detective, come solve my mystery

[Pre-Chorus: D. Woods]
Some say that love is all that I'm missing
Some call it jezebel, I call it attention
But what they don't know they can't even imagine
Say I don't have no self-esteem but it's my fashion

[Chorus: All]
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl
I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me
I-I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

[Post-Chorus: All]
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform

[Verse 2: Dawn]
Something about me has got you hypnotized
Examine my body like you're the science guy
Watching my every move you anticipate
What ya thinking about, boy I can recreate

[Pre-Chorus: Aundrea]
Some say that love is all that I'm missing
Some call it jezebel, I call it attention
But what they don't know they can't even imagine
Say I don't have no self-esteem but it's my fashion

[Chorus: All]
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I know you hear me boy...
B-A-D-C-H-I-C, lookin' so sexy
Make them bitches hate me
She not me cause there's just one me
I'm the M to the I-double S-Y-E
Lights come on, I tr-transform
Gimme that dick, baby, com-come on
I can do it all night 'til the break of dawn
On-On and on, I keep on goin'
They call me a jezebel cause I freaks, I does it well
Got extensions in my hair, bad girls is ya'll up in here? (Yeah)
Tonight we just gonna let it do what it do
I can put this pretty young thing on you
I ain't lookin' for attention, I just want you
Let me be your addiction, I can be that too

I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me
I-I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me

[Chorus: All]
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

[Post-Chorus: All]
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform

[Bridge: Shannon + (Dawn)]
From a caterpillar to a butterfly
I know I got something that you're gonna like
(Don't be afraid I won't let you down)
I'm the one that'll make you come around

[Chorus: All]
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl
I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me
I-I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

[Post-Chorus: All]
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform
