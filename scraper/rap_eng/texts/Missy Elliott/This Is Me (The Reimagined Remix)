[Intro: Kesha]
I am not a stranger to the dark
"Hide away," they say
"'Cause we don’t want your broken parts"

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
You can put your mind to do whatever you wanna do
Just tell yourself that you capable, too
But don't do things that ain't even cool
And get rid of them no-good friends that’s enablin' you
Makin' you feel like you won't be nothin', your life crumblin'
They talk, mumblin'
You gon' be something, you’re glorious
We’re no gangs, but warriors, we well-known, notorious
They can't stop you or block you or mock you
They mad ’cause you bad and they not you
You fall down, but get up and skip and hop through
Kick down doors for others to walk through
You have a purpose, to make you say, "Did I do that?" Urkel
Now we callin' reality virtual
This is who I am, this is me, don't let them words hurt you

[Chorus: Kesha & Keala Settle]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I’m meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Kesha & Keala Settle, Keala Settle]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Keala Settle & Kesha]
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun (We are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become
(Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha & Keala Settle, Keala Settle]
I Won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Kesha & Keala Settle, Missy Elliott]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I'm alone, I never fit the mold
The world is so cold, hold it down on my own
I'm just tryna reach up to the sky, see the moon
I got confidence 'cause I'm the flyest in the room
And I been knocked down, but I always get up
I had some fake friends, had to go and switch up
Yeah, no pain, no strain, I ain't chasin' all the pain
'Cause I got more to gain, and I'm just tryna make a change
I'm just doin' me, I'm in my own lane
I fell down a few times, but I'm up again
Marchin' to another drum, see me crawl, see me run
When they thought that I was done, no, I'm not, here I come
I'm not weak, I get on my feet
No apologies, yeah, this is me

[Bridge: Kesha, Keala Settle & (Missy Elliott)]
And I know that I deserve your love
There's nothing I'm not worthy of (Uh, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha, Keala Settle, Both]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

[Chorus: Kesha, Keala Settle & Missy Elliott]
Look out 'cause here I come (Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
(Marching on, marching, marching on to you)
I'm not scared to be seen (Uh, yeah)
I make no apologies, this is me (No apologies, yeah, this is me)

[Outro: Kesha, Keala Settle, Both]
Whenever the world's gone, whenever the world's gone
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
Oh, oh, oh, this is me
