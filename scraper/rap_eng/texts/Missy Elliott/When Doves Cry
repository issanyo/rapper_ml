[Verse 1]
Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers G
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

[Verse 2]
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
A nigga like me strike curious poses
I feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Verse 3]
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
Now you've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase
Even doves have pride

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (maybe maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (why)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Interlude: Michael Jackson-esque shout]
Ooh ooh ooh - baby

[Outro]
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (a world so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (you know, you know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (why)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
