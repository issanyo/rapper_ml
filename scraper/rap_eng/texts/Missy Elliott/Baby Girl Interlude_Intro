[Missy] (Mary)
Ay yo Mary, I need you to vibe with me on this one
Uh, uh, check it
As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God, my eyes, they water like a preacher who sin
I'm only human but
The world has put me on a platform
Since the day I was born to only wait for my downfall
But like a brick wall I'm too hard to break
Okay I do make mistakes but I'm the realest from the fake
That's why I'm the hardest to hate
Aaliyah, baby girl, I've learned to love those while they're still awake
Sleep, sleep
And prepare a place for those who are good
In the projects and hood, gifted or misunderstood
I know Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still number one
There will be more of us to come (ohh)
I am a leader, a teacher, a guider (ooh)
Like a single parent provider (ooh)
Putting back those hip-hop dividers
Like a priest with a back slider
I've sinned but I win
And anyone we've lost in life or nine eleven
We'll be sure to see again (ooh, hoo)

[Mary]
What you hear is not a test (ooh)
I'm rocking to the beat (I'm rocking to the beat)
See me and my crew and my friends (and)
We're gonna try to move your feet (move around, move around)
See I am Mary Blige (yes I am)
And I'd like to say hello (thank you for inviting me)
To the black to the white, the read and the brown
The purple and yellow (everybody)
But first you gotta, but first you gotta
