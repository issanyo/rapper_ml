[Intro: Fatman Scoop]
Dangerous!

[Chorus: Ciara & Fatman Scoop]
Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up (Ciara!), level up, level up, level up (Missy!)
Level up, level up, (Fatman Scoop!) level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
[?], love yourself, level up
Drop that weight, level up, it's time to win, level up

[Verse 1: Ciara & (Fatman Scoop)]
Them old mistakes are gone, I won’t do them no more (no more)
That’s old news, there’s new news, I done did that before
I turned nothing to something, my comeback on one hunnid' (one hunnit')
Less talking, more action, you just gon' see Ci coming
I just keep elevating, no losses, just upgrading
My lessons, made blessings, I turned that into money
Thank God I never settled, this view is so much better
I’m chilling, I’m winning, like on another level

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I stayed prayed up
Nothing I’m afraid of
And I can have it all

[Chorus: Ciara with Fatman Scoop]
Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Fake friends, I let go, I don't hang with them no mo'
I don't need no promo, I make dollars like Creflo
Original, no klepto', got a new flow, got a new glow
Level up, I'm beautiful, my ass, bounce like a yo-yo
Ayy, I feel good and fly today
And I ain't worried about shit, no way
I level up, get money and devil up (that's right)
Now ya'll can't sit with us, y'all gospel folks, y'all jealous, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I stay prayed up
Nothing I’m afraid of
And I can have it all

[Chorus: Ciara with Fatman Scoop]
Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
Me and Ciara, they ain't seen this comin
In the streets, this song is buzzin'
Some of ya'll still talkin' mumblin'
But that shit don't really mean nothin'
We level up, level up
Fall down, get up, get up
Boss up, boss up
Ayy, ayy-ayy and level up, level up

[Chorus: Ciara with Fatman Scoop]
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

[Outro: Fatman Scoop]
Going back, and wind, hit the ground
Oh wind it up, oh round and round
Lets go, throw it back
And walk, hit the ground
Let's go
Wind it up, and go round and round
Level up, level up, Level up, all the way up
Level up to the sky, to the sky now
[?] level up
Get that cash, level up
It's time to win
Dangerous!
