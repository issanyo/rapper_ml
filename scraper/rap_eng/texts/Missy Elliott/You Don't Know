[Spoken: Missy]
Now, see
The one thing I like about the niggas
Is that they can fess up to one of they boys
That they been sleepin' wit' the same chick
And laugh about it
But, see
A woman, could never admit to another woman
That she been sleepin' wit' her man
Cuz if that ever happened to me
I would call your house and be like, "Yo-"

[Verse: Missy]
Don't you gotta man?
Why you fuckin' wit' mine?
See, I been through bad times
Get yo' mind off mines
You must be lonely
Why you messin' wit' me
But it won't be easy
To get my baby

[Chorus 1: Missy & Lil' Mo]
You don't know who you messin' with
Most of them leave with they car doors bent (*ad-libs*)
I'm so pissed, you gon' make me flip
(*ad-libs*)

[Above While:]
[Missy:]
Hello?
[Mo:]

[Missy:]
For real?
[Mo:]

[Verse: Lil' Mo]
I be callin' his house, when you're not around
Don't make me warn you
You know how I get down, down
Somebody told me
But I ain't trippin' off you, no
If you were doing your thang
He'd still be wit' you

[Repeat 1 While:]
[Mo:]
Hello?
[Missy:]
You know who this is, bitch. Heh! Yeah
[Mo:]
Yo, who this for real, man, hello?
[Missy:]
You know who it is

[Chorus 2: Missy]
I can't believe you would ever do that
Can't you show me some respect?
Is it cuz you just a reject?
Gotta keep your ass in check

[Repeat 2 above While:]
[Mo:]
Hello?

[Verse 4: Missy]
You been suckin' his dick
Tastin' my clit
Just a side chick
On the side, bitch

You be dialin'

[Verse 5: Lil' Mo]
Around yo' crew, you's a bad bitch
Yo ass be talkin' mad ish

Yo, I got ya moms prayin'

[Verse 6: Missy]
It's gonna get risky
Fuck wit' Missy

And you filthy and you mildy
Not appealin'
