You're so incredible
Ever since the day we became, we became.. so personal
Everyday that I spend with you it gets.. unforgettable
Anything that I did with you, I don't.. regret at all
(I love everything about you)

Take away, your gold and platinum chains
(and I'm gonna love you baby)
Cause I'm gon' love, love you anyway
(I ain't in it for the cheddar baby)
I'm not in it for, for the love of cash
(oh no no, you might go broke, but I'm)
Cause if you go broke, I gotta make it last
(not goin nowhere, nowhere, nowhere..)

(Ginuwine)
Listen, let's make, it national
I want the whole world to know
I'm with you, and I'm.. in love
Ain't no girl in this world
Can fill your shoes, none not at all
The things you do for me is so.. unbelievable
And you can take away all the platinum chains

Now can you hold me, now can you feel me
Now can you get near me..
For once in your lifetime, for once in your lifetime
Now can you hold me, now can you feel me
Now can you get near me..
For once in your lifetime, for once in your lifetime
