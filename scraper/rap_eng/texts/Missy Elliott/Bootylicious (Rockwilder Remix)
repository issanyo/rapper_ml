[Destiny's Child]
Kelly, can you handle this
Michelle, can you handle this
Beyonce, can you handle this
I don't think they can handle this
My boy Roc, can you handle this
My girl Missy, can you handle this
DC, can you handle this
My ghettos you can't handle this

[Kelly]
You better move cause we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
We're the baddest chicks, the chicks inside
DJ jam tonight
Spotted me a tender thing baby
There you are, come on baby
Don't you wanna boogie with me
Say, can you handle, handle me?

[Beyonce]
You gotta do much better
If you gon' dance with me tonight
You gotta work yo' jelly
If you gon' dance with me tonight
Cause I don't think they're ready for that jelly from them boys
Cause I don't think they're ready for that jelly from them boys
Cause I don't think they're ready for that jelly
From Beyonce, Michelle and Kelly
It's time for takeoff

[Hook]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya babe

[Destiny's Child]
I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip from my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hopin' you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we shake our **

[Kelly]
I'm about to break ya off
H-town growin' hard
Lead with hips, slap my thighs
Swing my hair, square my eyes
Lookin' HOT! smellin' good
Groovin' like I'm from da hood
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this?

[Beyonce]
You gotta do much better
If you gon' dance with me tonight (night)
You gotta work yo' jelly
If you gon' dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully if ya like what you see
Move girl, prove you can hang with me
By the looks I got ya shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff

[Hook]

[Missy Elliott]
Y'all not ready
How many times I say y'all not ready
Watch my booty shake like a fat lady's belly
My style so stank I better bank you gon' smell me
*SNIFF!* Aw, you smell me
Smells like money when I come runnin' *WOW!*
Missy keep it comin' -- *WOW!*
RocWilder drum drummin'
Destiny got the whole world freakin' somethin'
Now we killin' somethin'
Somebody better warn y'all
B, Michelle and Kelly put that jelly on y'all
Roc and Missy be hot like California
Won't you sing the hook, uh, why don'tcha
Now here we go

[Michelle]
Move your body up and down
Make your booty touch the ground
I can't help but wonder why
[All] Is my vibe too vibealicious for ya babe
