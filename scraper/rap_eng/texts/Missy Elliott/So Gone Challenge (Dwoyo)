I wrote this in ten minutes
That's more than you'll ever give me
You only met me twice but I don't think that you'd forget me
I'll admit that I'm crushing, won't admit that I'm creeping
Unless you're into that, I'll tell you all about your weekend
I'm peeping your profile, falling for things so simple like dimples on your smile
Give me your number, watch how fast I make that phone dial
Impatiently waiting, debating whether or not I should just show up to your spot
What's the worst that can happen? Serenade you with rapping
Ven conmigo mi Jasmine, you ever been with a Latin?
I know you understand it, cause I'm speaking your language
And I'm from your same island, another reason I'm wildin'
I'm finding ways to impress you, take you out and finesse you
Compliment your outfit while I mentally undress you
And test you, while you're in class I text you things to tempt you
Nobody makes me feel this way except you
You got my heart rushing, I'm loving the way you stunt in them heels, I'm crushing for real
Nothing but praise, that's just how I feel, do it again got you blushing for days
Okay, this whole song's for you, hope you can manage
This liquor got me so gone, but this wasn't a challenge
