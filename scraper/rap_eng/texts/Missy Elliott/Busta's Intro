[Intro]
Ay yo yo yoyo yoyoyoyo
Ay yo yo yoyo yoyoyoyo
Ay yo yo yo yo
Ay yo, Missy, fuck that
I just came out here a hour & twenty five minutes
On one of them Gilligan Island shits of New York, Virginia
Word up! To visit your ass, and you playin' shit like this up in my ears
What the fuck you think you doin', thinkin' I ain't gonna get on this
Muthafucka before I bounce
Yo check this out, let me hit you with this real shit real quick, Missy
One shot, baby just let me do my shit for a minute on your shit
Check it out

[Verse]
Ah hahahah!
I continue to disregard all of ya'll's opinion
Ahah! Blast your whole ass into oblivion
Eheaha, makin' New York with Virgin-akins
Eheh, this shit be bangin', ehe
If you disagree, uh-uh!
Before I smoke this, and get a little drunk and a little pissy
When I'm finished with music I'mma make all ya'll muthafuckas miss me
See "who is he, that girl right there who is she?"
It's Busta Rhymes and Missy
Niggas, when ya come around Missy, don't act like a fuckin' sissy
No chicken headz allowed here, no time for the kissy kissy
And when they askin' "who is he?"
I be Busta Ryhmes the phenomenal of get busy
Strictly major effective, ya'll niggas know the drilly
We gettin' money together, trackin' stacks and then count 'em
Y'all niggas stay tuned for the rest of my homegirl Missy's album

[Outro]
Word up! Flip Mode is the muthafuckin' squad!
Busta Rhymes commin' in right here with this quick lil' drop on ya
Ah, yo, ya'll niggas stay focussed!
Keep ya eyes and ears on this fulfillin' shit. Missy LP numba one!
Blossomin' like beautiful flowers on all y'all muthafuckas!
