[Intro]
[Jennifer Hudson:]
Hello

[Fantasia:]
Hello, Can I speak to Jennifer please?

[Jennifer Hudson:]
Yes this is Jennifer. May I ask who's calling?

[Fantasia:]
Hi Jennifer, I'm Tony's girlfriend. I don't mean to call on no disrespectful stuff but...

[Jennifer Hudson:]
Wait a minute, Tony's girlfriend. Apparently you got the wrong number because I'm Tony's woman. His only woman, that is

[Fantasia:]
Well, obviously that's what he's been telling you but I'm calling to introduce myself. My name is Fantasia

[Jennifer Hudson:]
Did you just say introduce yourself?

[Fantasia:]
Yea

[Jennifer Hudson:]
Well, I don't need no introduction. I am his woman and I am Jennifer Hudson. If this was 10 years ago, I'd be at your front door, ready to whoop your ass. But you know what; I'm to grown for that. I ain't got nothing else to say

[Jennifer Hudson:]
I'm his only woman, his woman
And you can't break up this home
You can say what you want
This is my man, get your own
After all these years I spent
Must've been close to 10
You can't mean the same to him
Especially when that's my man

[Fantasia:]
Baby now that he's with you
Tell me why he call me boo
Yes he played you like a fool
Cause he lying to you
I'm just trying to talk to you baby
Woman to woman
Like two adults
Not trying to start no commotion
But the man you claim is yours
Says he's mine and he loves me too
Same promises to you
The honest truth, yes we both are fools

[Jennifer Hudson:]
Seems that you're the one who's calling me!
Oh, he belongs to me
Only me and only me
This situation
You don't want no confrontation with, with me boo
I don't know what he's telling you
But it seems to me that your confused

[Fantasia:]
I'm his only woman, his woman
And what you saying to me
I don't care

[Jennifer Hudson:]
I'm not trying to go back & forth
Simply you're not welcome over here

After all these years I spent
Must've been close to 10
You can't mean the same to him
Especially when that's my man

[Fantasia:]
Baby now that he's with you
Tell me why he call me boo
Cause he's lying to you
And I can't believe it

[Jennifer Hudson:]
I can't believe it
The same man that I knew when he lived with his mamma

[Fantasia:]
I knew him too, yea

[Jennifer Hudson:]
The same damn man who care note that I paid
Who bed that I made
So you better believe

After all the years I spent
Must've been close to 10
You can't mean the same to him
Especially when he's my man

[Fantasia:]
Baby now that he's with you
Tell me why he call my boo
Yes he lied to me

[Both:]
And he's lying to you
