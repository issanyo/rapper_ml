[Intro]
Oh baby, baby, oh baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Such a pleasure loving you, it's all mine
I smile each day away
I feel better knowing you
Ooh, you've got me thinking

[Verse 1]
It's better to give than take
I don't have to beg you to
You're so good to me
Carries me from day to day

[Pre-Chorus]
I appreciate the things you do
Ooh, but there's one thing
I have to tell you boy
I take your actions
But I love the things you say

[Chorus]
I listen to the things you say
Ooh, you're calling me oh, oh, oh, oh
I listen to the things you say to me baby
In a poem or a card, serenade my heart

I listen to the things you say
Ooh, you're calling me oh, oh, oh, oh
I listen to the things you say to me baby
In a poem or a card, serenade my heart

[Verse 2]
Lovely letters come from you
At times, I know I don't deserve you
Any weather, you'll come through
Ooh, you've got me gleaming
I feel more than I'm not worth it
You're my treasure
I'll take you over anything
As pleasing on this earth

[Pre-Chorus]
I appreciate the things you do
Ooh, but there's one thing
I have to tell you boy
I take your actions
But I love the things you say

[Chorus]
I listen to the things you say
Ooh, you're calling me oh, oh, oh, oh
I listen to the things you say to me baby
In a poem or a card, serenade my heart

I listen to the things you say
Ooh, you're calling me oh, oh, oh, oh
I listen to the things you say to me baby
In a poem or a card, serenade my heart

[Bridge]
Every word that you say
Makes the day much brighter
Melody that you play
I, I hear right away
And my heart is lighter
Sweet to my heart, boy

[Chorus]
I listen to the things you say
Ooh, you're calling me oh, oh, oh, oh
I listen to the things you say to me baby
In a poem or a card, serenade my heart

I listen to the things you say
Ooh, you're calling me oh, oh, oh, oh
I listen to the things you say to me baby
In a poem or a card, serenade my heart

[Outro]
The things you say
