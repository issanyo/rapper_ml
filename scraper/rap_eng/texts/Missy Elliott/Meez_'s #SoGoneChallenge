[Intro]
Yeah
Meezay, okay
So gone, so gone
Yeah

[Verse]
We are. A movie that is never ending and a love rendition
Beyond the framing and angles, baby you are my vision
I hardly glisten but ever since you came in this living
Its mi casa su casa, now its streets that I don't frequent
My heart is jumping around, dancing cause heaven sent
You are and it's beyond bars that do represent
My love for you and how dumb I flew, when our eyes done met
I swear you're a God send, mama I would do for you
What Marvel and DC would be at awe for, tho its cute
Okay maybe its too, extreme but you make me better
Of a man, I understand now how women are better
I'm so privileged you're mine and I swear we'll get this cheddar
Together and hella we are, fairy tale forevers
I know you get irritations from your boy but remember
Its always you I love and your hot's forever Decembers
We're levels that even the levels couldn't get together
I promise to keep your interests on places that are better
Like my heart, this love thing of ours like a coast
So let's leave world uglies and proceed to do the most
