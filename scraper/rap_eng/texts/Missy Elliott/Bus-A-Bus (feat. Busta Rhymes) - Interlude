Yes in deed yes in deed out this mothafucka
Back with the right foot steppin' in first
And the left foot steppin' in after
I go by the divine attribute of bus a bus down suttin'
Other wise known as busta motha fucking rhymes

'Cause I'm in the spot love it
When a bitch kiss up on a mafucka
I love it the way when I piss up on a mafucka
Mafucka they need to chill relax
What yaw need to do is listen up mafucka
So as we begin to get you addictive to the shit

Peoples with you, you know one of your peoples
That stay sober you know to make sure
