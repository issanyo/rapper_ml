I be dippin' in clubs, girls screamin', "Do you want it Timb?"
Nigga, playa hater sayin', "Who the hell is him?"
I'm in the back, gleamin' from all that virgin gem
Keep a bunch of pretty models surroundin' Timb

I'm over capac'y when it come to makin' them beats
Me and Missy makin' y'all, move y'all feets
Makin' y'all dance and tango, make y'all legs get weak
That's only 'cause we drop a bunch of heat

That's watcha gonna expect, comin' from my crew
Bunch of dope beats, and a bunch of dope lyrics too
I know that's too much for you to handle dude
Now ask yourself what

Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?

When they come in the spot, dem wanna jock
Dem nasty boy lookin' around, with big cocks
Them girls be plottin' on how to get the rocks
So I beat that ass to the ground like I'm the cops

What they gon' say? Don't wan' play
Get 'em in the club, ahh, smokin' on hay
When I'm in my ride, people walkin' by
Pistol by my side, in case dem wan' try

Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?

I be gettin' in girls clothes, make 'em buy my whole wardrobe
Better get all my dough, pluckin' the hair in my nose
It's official I'm a pimp, 'cause my name glows
And I'm back to the Yugos

Talkin' that junk, you get buried
You don't wanna end up in the cemetery
Me and Timbaland got tracks that will kill you
In the other hand I got gats that will peel you

Watcha gon' say? Watcha gon' do?
When I'm in the club, comin' for you
I'm just a smooth motherfucker
Watcha gon' say? Watcha gon' do?
When I'm in the club, and I'm comin' for you
I'm just a smooth motherfukcer

Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?

Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do?
