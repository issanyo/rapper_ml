[Missy Elliott]
Hey mommy what a playaaaaaa?
Yo, yo, yo yo yo yo yo (x4)
Black, black, black
(Ms. Parker what you suckin' on?)
Standin' on the bus stop suckin' on a lollipop

[Static (Missy)]
Hey, hey Ms. Parker what's you address?
(Yo Yo, whatchu say, Static?)
Hey Ms. Parker can I caress?

[Black]
Mmm Ms. Parker glad to meet you
Mmm mmm Ms. Parker I do need you
Tell 'em now

[Chorus- Playa]
Listen to my heartbeat
Feel my wet lips
Ms. Parker don't you trip 'cause
Girl I know you want me
Listen to my finger snaps
You dig the way I roll
And the way a brotha act?
And your ex can't top that

[Smokey (Playa)]
Oh oh Ms. Parker what's that up your skirt?
Oh oh oh Ms. Parker you know I'm a flirt
Oh oh oh Ms. Parker can I ride with you?
(I've never seen this side of you)
And if you've got time to listen

[Chorus]

[Missy Elliott rap]
Y'all know 'bout Ms. Parker
Capital P-A-rker
Lived at the corner of Fort Ruckus and Walker
Always a talker, late booty caller
Big squeeze them nuts, them spaghetti meat
Baller stalker watch Ms. Parker get freaky
Smoke too much reefa 'til she cheeky
Ms. Parker got the mara weekly
Give me funk 'til I'm stinkin'
And if you wanna battle come and see me
Check it one time

[Chorus to fade]
