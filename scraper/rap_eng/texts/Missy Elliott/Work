[Intro/Bridge: 2x: Ciara]
When the song come on in the club
Put it up, put it up, put it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Rewind!)

[Verse 1: Ciara]
The dance train is coming back again
Extravaganza, you should run and tell a friend
Kings and queens are posted at the bar
Buckin' down, it's time to tip it off

[Pre-Hook: Ciara]
Walk that walk (walk)
Show me how you move it
Can you walk that talk (talk)
Put some snap into it
It's your chance now
Girl you better dance now
It's your time to show it all
The spotlight is on you, you better

[Hook: 2x: Cirara]
Work work work work
Work work work work
Work work work work
Work work bitch, you better work!

[Verse 2: Ciara]
You better shake that thang like a donkey
And go hard for it bitch, you better work
You better swing from a paw like a monkey
And go hard for it, you better work
Cause big girls get down on the flo'
And make it jiggle, jiggle, jiggle you ain't know
Ain't no shame, it's the name of game
Now everybody down to the flo', here we go
We got the rhythm of the be-be-beat
We got the rhythm of the beat
We got the rhythm of the hands
Let's get the rhythm of the feet
Jump in, jump out (4x)

[Pre-Hook: Ciara]
Walk that walk (walk)
Show me how you move it
Can you walk that talk (talk)
Put some snap into it
It's your chance now
Girl you better dance now
It's your time to show it all
The spotlight is on you, you better

[Hook: 2x: Cirara]
Work work work work
Work work work work
Work work work work
Work work bitch, you better work

[Intro/Bridge: Ciara]
When the song come on in the club
Put it up, put it up, put it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Rewind!)

[Verse 3: Missy Elliot]
When the song start to play, tell the DJ, "Back it up!"
And if you want the danceflo, you tell the DJ, "Back it up!"
This your jam, this your joy, "Hey Mr. DJ back it up!"
This that new Ciara, go holla at the DJ: Back it up!
Now! drop down! everybody in a club drop down
Jiggle that, jiggle that
Till it drop, till it drop, till it drop
All the way, all the way down to the ground
We in a club, in a club, don't stop
When the song come on don't stop
Me and Ci be on dessert
All the ladies on the flo you better work

[Breakdown]
It's out to be a fight in this club
A fight in this club, so get into my mug
Get into my mug
Get buck, get buck (4x)
I bet ya can't do it like me (like me)
I bet ya can't do it like me me me
I bet ya can't do it like me (like me)
I bet ya can't do it like me me me
Get some, get some
Get buck, get buck
Get some, get some
Get buck, get buck (Work) (Lets go!)

[Hook: 2x]


[Outro]
Bitch you better work
Bitch you better work
Bitch you better work
Ow! [Laugh]
Work...
