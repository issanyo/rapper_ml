I've got to find me a new guy
Uh, supa fly
Orish, 702, hot, come on

Oh why, oh why so stupid of me
To take you back so easily
I'm going, going out of my mind
To take you back a second time

Why must you put me through
So much heartache and pain?
Tell me am I insane
To let you do me this way?

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

Oh no, oh no how dumb could I be
To think that you loved me (how naive)
These lies all the time
I should have known you weren't mine

Why must you put me through
So much heartache and pain?
Tell me am I insane
To let you do me this way?

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

Oh no, oh no where did you go?
Why did you leave me all alone?
You're spending most of your time
With other tricks on your mind

I've got to find a new guy
See I need a new guy (can't put up with your lies)
(Repeat) Look what you've done to me
You broke my heart
You put a burden on me
I feel so torn apart
I feel so torn apart

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game
