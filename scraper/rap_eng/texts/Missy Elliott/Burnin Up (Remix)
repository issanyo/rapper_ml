[Intro: P.Diddy]
As we proceed (Yeah yeah yeah yeah) to give you what you need
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah) Yeah, it's gettin hot in here!
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah) Oh! It's gettin hot in here! Missy!

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott] (P.Diddy)
(Wooo hoooo!) Dag it's hot (I like this)
Must have been Missy comin up in the spot
How many times I'm a tell you to stop
If me and Faith on the track artist don't wanna drop
Now c-c-come on move your feet
Let's slide to the flo' when ya hear this beat
Let's shake it like a pro (oh) gimme what you got
This is gonna blow when you play it in your box

[Faith Evans]
Sometimes you can be in love and having fun
And still not know what's goin on (No)
Or on the other hand you separate, thinkin that the feelin's gone
Feels like forever when were together, I knew that we are destiny
So here's the last chance for the last dance
For us to bring back the dream

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
So baby come and rescue me (I'm burnin up!)
I got somethin' for you to see (I'm burnin up!)
Baby come and take me there (I'm burnin up!)
Trust me you should (Hurry up!) Baby I'm just (burnin up! burnin up!)

[Verse 2: Missy] (P.Diddy)
(It's gettin hot in here!!!)
I'm burnin up like a match (Missy: Match) layin on my back (Missy: Back)
Thirty eight deezy a that's just baby fat
Why you so upset? Cause you want some putty cat
You bought no jimmy hat no way don't gimme that
Yeah I want you back, so can I have you back
Those size twelve feet explains what's in your slacks
I know this for a fact, I love the way you mack
Can you rescue me? Ay yo Faith where you at?

[Faith Evans] (P. Diddy)
In the midnight hour, wait a minute
I can be in a lonely place
Then along you come with the sweetest thing to say
And put the sun in my day (It's gettin hot in here!!!)
I really wish you would

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Rescue me (I'm burnin up!)
I got somethin for you to see (I'm burnin up!)
Baby come and take me there (I'm burnin up!)
Trust me you should (Hurry up!) Baby I'm just (burnin up!)
Baby come and rescue me (I'm burnin up!)
I got somethin' for you to see (I'm burnin up!)
Oooh oooh oooh oh oh (I'm burnin up!)
Trust me you should (Hurry up!) Baby I'm just (burnin up! burnin up!)
(P.Diddy: It's gettin hot in here AAAAoooooooowwwwwwww!!!!)

[Outro: Faith Evans]
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
