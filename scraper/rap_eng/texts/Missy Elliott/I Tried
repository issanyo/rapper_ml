(Girl)
Aye yo bitch turn the f**kin' music up
You f**kin' bitch
I heard you've been f**kin' with my man
What kind of friend are you?
What's goin' on what am I dealin' with?
(wah wah wah wah wah wah)
I can't believe it
You call yourself a f**kin' friend
I should stamp on your face right now
F**k you bitch
Don't look don't look at me
You call yourself a friend

(Pam)
I feel so bad
For lovin' my homegirl's man
I tried
(you call yourself a friend)
I swear I tried
(wah wah wah wah wah wah)
And it's so sad
That she don't know, all of it
How long it goes
(you call yourself a friend)
I tried
I've tried

Chorus

I know I'm wrong
But I can't help it
I tried to block you out my mind
But I can't help it
For real you know I tried
(you call yourself a friend)
I tried
(wah wah wah wah wah wah)

I know I'm wrong
But I can't help it
I tried to block you out my mind
But I can't help it
For real you know I tried

(Pam)
It's a shame
When I'm with you, I can't maintain
I tried
God knows I tried
(wah wah wah wah wah wah)
I don't know
What to do, to make these feelings go away
I tried
(you call yourself a friend)
I swear I tried
I tried

Chorus

I know I'm wrong

But I can't help it
I tried to block you out my mind
But I can't help it
For real you know I tried
(you call yourself a friend)

(wah wah wah wah wah wah)

I know I'm wrong
But I can't help it
I tried to block you out my mind
But I can't help it
For real you know I tried

Baby, believe me
When I say, I really
Tried my best not to let you know
Wanna be wherever you go
Got the biggest crush on you
For real I tried, and that's the truth

Before you leave

You call yourself a friend, f**k you
Get out
Turn the music up first
Can't believe you were f**kin' wit' my man, get out
You call yourself a friend
