Know, know what I mean?

Fast car, fast car
I wanna meet your fast car
Take me on a comet ride
Shoot me past the fast car
I wish I owned that last car
You could be the end to
Everything my heart's asking for

Take me away
(So, so, far away)
I don't wanna feel no sorrow
Take me away
(So, so, far away)
I might not see tomorrow

Hey, hey

You tell me you can cure my addiction
(Addiction)
And you tear my feet off the ground
Everytime I would forget my affliction
(Affliction)
But I don't want to come down

It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground

Take me up in your rocket ship
Take me so, so far away
(Away)
Let me forget all the good shit
Take me so, so far away
(Away)

I need a face that's not mine that fits me
Just get me to forget misery
Yes indeed, we just be
In misery, yes indeed
We just be up high
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

You tell me you can cure my addiction
(Addiction)
And you tear my feet off the ground
Everytime I would forget my affliction
(Affliction)
But I don't want to come down

It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground

You remind me of my Mercedez Benz
For you I spend all my years
You might wanna meet my friends
And I might wanna have your kids
I name 'em Shaniqua , Bonita, Rashawn

And baby, you can take me far away
See the moon and the stars
Now can't nobody do it like you do
(What?)
I admit you got to go
(What?)

Me and you, just us two
Spread my love like a swine flu
Ay, you got me high
Wanna touch the sky
You know you love me right?
Let's sing this lullaby

Yeah, you could be my fast car
Maybe be my Jaguar
Baby, what you isn't are
Make me see the moon and stars
I wanna touch the moon

Get some of this poom, poom
Ride it like zoom, zoom
Make him drop this fruit of the loom
He want my peach fair Victoria underwear
I love 'em, oh so swell
And yep, he love my fruit cocktail

I keep it real, baby
I love 'em crazy, baby
I'm a name brand bitch
She just don't need it, baby
You better stay with me
Sexy is what I need
I'm a F-A-S-T C-A-R M- ISS -E

You tell me you can cure my addiction
(Addiction)
And you tear my feet off the ground
Everytime I would forget my affliction
(Affliction)
But I don't want to come down

It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground

High that you're givin' me
High that you're givin' me
High that you're givin' me
High that you're givin' me
High that you're givin' me
