Hip hop betta wake up, the bed to make up
Some of ya'll be faker than a drag in make-up
Got issues to take up before we break up
Like Electra let go miss Anita Baker
I love Jacobs, but jewelry won't fix my place up
Gotta stay up, studio nice to cake up
Now check my flava, rich folks is now my neighbors
I got cable, and check out hot I made my paper
Hip hop don't stop be my lifesaver
Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers
And like a elevator DJ on a cross fader

First piece of change I see I'm gon' get one
745 no license to drive

(Rewind)
I can hear myself but I can't feel myself
745 no license to drive
I ain't even gotta home I gots to live in my ride, fuck it
Couple of karats in my ear won't hurt
Need a nice chain layin' on this thousand dollar shirt
Evisujeans cover the rectum I kick game just like David Beckham
Anybody in my way I wet them
I'ma be this way until the cops come catch 'em
To detective sketch 'em on the sidewalk wit chalk
New Yorks infections till I got taught a lesson
Couple niggas gone couple in correction
Hillary got ten, Todd got 15 nigga even my kin
Got 5 years bringin' 19 in, I just think I used to think like them
Now they gotta live through the pictures that I send 'em in the pen
Hope you don't start yah life where I end
Wake up
