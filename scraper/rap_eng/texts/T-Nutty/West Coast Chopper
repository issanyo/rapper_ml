Chorus [T-Nutty]
I'm a gangsta, gangsta, I kick that shit like a gangsta gangsta, I bet you maybe wanna be gangsta, get to whopping at you niggas cause it's gangsta gangsta [x2]

Verse 1:
I get to chopping niggas like I'm breaking down a brick
Everybody know T-Nutty now be with this shit
So when I start the bussing, mothafuckers get to ducking, Ain't no reason for discussion, only if it's about to chill
I'm in the zone, something like a zip, 28 grams on the scale can you show me how to whip
Cause I'm something like a drug, what you sucker though it was, I be fucking with the bloods, I be fucking with the crips
I be fucking with the bitches and niggas with 9 millas
When they go down they willing to ride with us
And the deuce we die hard like Bruce Willis, kind to try hard I'm through chilling
I'm who the realest, I'm who be really in the streets, on the creep trying to find where the meal is to eat
Real niggas feel my pain, every time I spit it to a beef, bet that
I give it to 'em like a free donation
Sticking to the script, homie glued to the basics
Coming with the gas like a fat boy's ass, write it slow write it fast, I'm going to make sure it's stanking
What the fuck was you thanking, young T-Nutty did he really fall off?
Did he go soft? Can he still kill 'em all off?, kill 'em all off? Looking for myself when I'm lost
A veteran and better then a motherfucking boss
Always get the cheddar but a nigga never floss
Forever the 3rd letter, so choosing your words better, I'm plucking your bird feathers, get the swooping like a hawk
Stupid niggas talk like they really really want it, when I really get up on it then wanna call it off
Better shutter with the woofer, break it to 'em with a whooping, niggas hopping out the bushes for this line that I'm pushing
Individuals hit 'em with the subliminals, outta the momma criminals, situation get critical
I'm calling the shots like I'm a general, first time getting physical, fucking on niggas bitches though
Get the clutching and untucking the pistol for niggas touching my genitals I'm a put something in 'em
Ho niggas don't be pretending, I'm snatching all through in denim, and winning from the beginning can't see me like I'm invisible
It's going to take a miracle and spiritual beliefs to compete with the lyricals, I eat niggas
And treat niggas like cereal and creep with material, the miracle for bread or the meat nigga
T-Nutty I'm the west coast chopper, hit 'em in the chest with a west coast knocker
Imma do my best, never giving nothing less, everything to the left, keep it creeping for the blockstas, blah blah

Chorus:
I'm a gangsta, gangsta, I kick that shit like a gangsta gangsta, I bet you maybe wanna be gangsta, get the whopping at you niggas cause it's gangsta gangsta [x2]
