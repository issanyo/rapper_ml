[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Sit up in the couch, no job, no bitch, I don't care 'bout shit
Wheels on a meal when I prolly go to jail, I don't care 'bout shit
I'm a motherfuckin' monster, they call me motherfuckin' monster
I'm a motherfuckin' monster, they call me motherfuckin' monster
I'm a motherfuckin' monster, they call me motherfuckin' monster
If a nigga die before you do, then I put it on my set that I will motherfuckin' haunt ya
My Brainsick niggas told me fuck it, no mo' playing mister nice guy
Imma come right straight up at you motherfuckers' heads
The friendly competition make you bitches turn a blind eye
Eliminate anyone like it were some kind of a threat
Rappers touching around at you bitches like you was a hula hoop
And I ain't stopping until you other swagger rappers dead
You really have no idea what I will motherfucking do to you

[Hook: C-Ray, Twisted Insane]
Silverback gorilla x8
Imma hit em with the (humming a melody)
Silver back gorilla x8

[Verse 2: T-Nutty]
Imma get to beatin' on my chest
Like a mad gorilla, half you niggas know you never been a threat
Only fuckin' with the killers from the set
Out to get the skrilla on the realla bitch so tell 'em cut the check
I'm a motherfuckin winner you can bet
7 up the game then 11 backdo' mic check
I mean it when I say I'm the meanest but I guess when I shit it these niggas think they can clean up my mess?
Uh-uh can't be too humble, then they might try to take over my jungle
In other words, find another turf to dump your bundle
I spit that crack to yo aunties and uncles and nephews and nieces
I'm so off the leash they be yelling hey come get yo dog
Hopping on top of cars chopping em now with bars looking up at the stars nigga I do that same shit to y'all fucka!
I'm a motherfuckin' chopper, they call me west coast chopper (chopper chopper) x3
If you niggas really think you winning my propellers get to spinning like a fucking helicopter
My G-block niggas say fuck em, if we can't join the greatest then we gotta be the greatest, Imma eat you haters like some sweet potato (pie)
Now you coming up short because your shit has been abbreviated see me in your TV station pacing back and forth but I'm a killer
The doctor said he wanna see me front because I'm iller
Spit a loogy on a bogeyman and let 'em know it's realer than a movie, man I'm truly disgustin'

[Verse 3: C. Ray]
Ain't nobody worry bout' nothing
Oh everybody in the game boss
Oh everybody got two chains
Oh everybody off that sauce
And fuck what you heard they stunting
Cause ain't nobody worried bout cost (hell no)
And everybody in that game (affiliated)
And can't nobody take no loss (winning)
Oh everybody singing they raps
Cause everybody want them hoes
You could put the cape on you a catfish (mayne)
Certain levels where you niggas can't go
Certain levels that you niggas can't reach
Certain knowledge that you niggas can't know
See you and I was in, I'm finna break bones
Hit him with the polish leave a nigga face gone (poof)
And it was fun being dumb for a minute, I could write a thousand verses in a week
If I didn't say shit
Whenever we talk about the realla it ain't no TV show you fuck around with me and wake up in the matrix
Only thing I'm missing is some autotune, bad-a-boom, competition droppin' like I shot a few down
Apparently that's how you make a hit, put some money on a rapper head and he'll be on the news now
And every chick bad every chick fuck good
Every single verse every song every hook
You think you with the sets I'm on as long as it took
They talk about the struggle like it's all from a book
And look, everybody reading from the same verse, they ain't on the same song though
But you fucking with a different breed, we ain't from the same turf WELCOME TO THE CONGO!
