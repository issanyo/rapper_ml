(intro)
On any day, in the hood
In front of any building, you can find some chicks
And what will they talk about? Niggas

(A) Yo, yo get the f**k outta here!
(U) Yeah, that f**kin bum motherf**ker
(U) Pico and shit from around the corner, that nigga be wildin

(Angie)
Uh-huh, yeah..

(Uneek)
I know this player named Ricky, push an 850
Light-skinned, slim, with a head like Sticky
All you gotta do girlfriend is slip a mickie
And in a quickie, Ricky turns into tricky

(Angie)
Aiyyo but what about his man? 'cause named Stan
Run around town in the plush Benz van
Ice all around his Rolex band
But runnin his mouth bout his credit card scams

(Uneek)
Yeah jerk that nigga, I heard of that nigga
The crew of quick niggas wanna murder that nigga, shit
He must be listenin to too much Jigga
Buddy Longdough, he got no figures

(Angie)

Yo, aiyyo I know you know Ralph, up on Tiebout
He a Puerto Rican cat, yeah you know he eat out
Walk around town with the weed and heat out
And he loco in the coco, dank weed out

(both - repeat 2X)
All over the world, niggas got a story to tell
Is you fly as f**k, or you broke as hell?
What set you claim nigga, is you thug or what?
What set you claim nigga, is it love or what?

(Angie)
Rude bwoy name Brian, nigga stay lyin
Got regular, but he swear it's Hawaiian
Part time dealer, part time client
Smokin up what he should be supplyin

(Uneek)
And yo that kid Black, don't know how to act
Wanna keep the Timbs on when he hit it from the back (oop!)
Pullin on my hair, almost loosened up a track
But I like that kid, he can keep comin back!

{*laughter and ad libs*}

(Angie)
Everybody back up, back up off the ropes
All you silly niggas are gonna have to back up
{*laughin*} We're gonna need all silly niggas to back up off the ropes!
Move back.. back.. back.. back..
