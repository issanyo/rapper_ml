Whoo!

CHORUS: Angie and Lil' Mo
Even though you got no money
Other chicks be actin funny
It don't matter boy cuz I got love for you
[a nice guy that like to fuck alot]
I'm so tired of all these playaz
And I don't mean to be a hater
But I know just what I'm lookin for
[a nice guy that like to fuck alot]

[Verse 1]
This is for my on the low niggas
Average joe niggas
You know, I'm tallkin plain ol' niggas
Big up, big up all the regular dudes
Appreciate 'em after dealin wit a playa or two
What I'm sayin to you, is all the ice is nice
But a girl get tired of payin the price
See it ain't what we eat, it's how we do
I like Mr. Chal, but we can do BBQ
Fuckin wit you, you gon get to my heart
We can chill, crack jokes, smoke a L in the park
And when it come to lovin, you go hard...
Yeah, now that's really what a girl want
And uh, nobody can do me
Like you, so you the one that I'm givin it to
For rich or tore up, I'm in it wit you
For you fake smooth niggas, I'm finished wit you
Beat it

CHORUS

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, uh
I shine, you shine
Gotta alotta big things playa that's nice
I don't wanna knock your hustle but I know your kind
And I don't trust ya so I'm lookin for mine
Not tryin to sell me the gathos, not poppin bottles
Not tryin to stick it to models
You know misled bitches, after your riches
Try to throw me in the mix don't even notice a difference
I don't like Coogie sweaters anyway
I like a nigga in a hoodie better anyday
I'm not a chick-en, I'm not to be tricked on
Matter fact you the rea-son
That I, don't wanna get with playaz no more
I wanna low key nigga fo' sho
You don't really gotta be my boyfriend
I'm sayin though...

CHORUS

[Tony Sunshine]
