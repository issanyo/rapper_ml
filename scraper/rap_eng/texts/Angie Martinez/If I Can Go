Oh, yeah, yeah {Yeah...}
Animal House {Hey...hey...hey...}
Come on, woo, come on, uh {If I can go with you}
Yo, yo, uh {Hey}
If I could choose a place to go, it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tommorow's like
Today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else could stay
And if I can go with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin' like leavin' the
Coast too
Feelin' like leavin' with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the 9th grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And if I can go with you
Way out the states, no two-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is
If I can go, contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
I'll get my things soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away
And if I can go with you
Oh, boy, we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And coy, you better know I know how to sneak with them
Toys
And boy with the block since around '94, boy
And if I could flow with you
Holdin' dat dough, after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario, the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin', get mo' tissue
The way me and this girlie rhymin', it's so official
Down takin' a trip too with no pistols
'Cause everything peace, only sand on the streets
Little Miami Heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in ???, one in Sand Beach
And I'll think I'll go with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you {Tell
Me, oh}
If I can go, contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
I'll get my things soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away
You can fly away {Fly away}
No one has to know {No-no-no-no-no-no}
Babe, take me with you {With you}
'Cause if I can go {I can go}
Soon as you say the word
We'll be on our way
To a foreign place {Woo...woo...}
You got to tell me {Tell me, oh}
Yo', uh
So now that we got a plan are you comin'
We could plan a week (Come on), the only question now
Is La Guardia or Kennedy
And a seat, no aisle, no window 'cause I like to see)
((And seein' as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds
Could speak)
And since we 'bout to go in a few
(Go 'head) Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace, thank you
(Ho 'head)
That week off, I'm grateful, what was you tryin' to
Say, Boo
(Nothin', just grab my chain off the table and two-way
Too)
Okay, that little place is a great move
And ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay
Blue
(And the shop's there) If they don't got 'em, they
Don't make 'em (True)
No concrete, just sand, throw away your shoes (That's
Right)
Now that we are on our way
And our bags is packed and the car service (Come on)
Is not late
Everything's okay
So I guess I catch you on the next track, now I don't
Gotta ask
If I can go, contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
I'll get my things soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away
If I can go, contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
And If can go, contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
Nothing at all
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
