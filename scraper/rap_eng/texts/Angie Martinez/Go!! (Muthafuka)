Angie: What's this?
(unfolding of letter)
Angie & Guy: Dear Angie
Guy: I know we've been together a long time boo
But I'm writing this letter cus
I really couldn't face you like
It's kinda ill
I gotta a lot things going on right now
And I met somebody too
So I need a little space ma for real

[Hook]
This mothafucka told me that he'd love me for life
He told me he had my back and I would be his fucking wife
He told me no matter what baby everythings gon be ok
And now this mothafucka's leaving and he don't think he gon pay

[Verse 1]
Think a letta like this gon kill me dude?
Shit you was lucky I was real wit you
Shit you was lucky I was feeling you
Let me tell you what a bitch that's real will do
I remember all the things that we did in my house
Should of never left shit in my house
Get your clothes and your boots and suits nigga get em up out
You would never know what I'm about
When I'm in doubt I walk away like it's the in thing
Follow all my instincts
The henessey in ya blood got ya strong like ginseing
Who the hell you think ya pimpin?
Not me you can go
I don't care what you leaving me for
If you stay you'll be deceiving me more
Let me see what you do when you can't get your feet on the floor
You didn't think that I would even the score
Through the heat of it all
I was there for you
Cared for you
But you never gave the love back
I don't care if you a thug cat
Ain't no mothafucka ever gon treat me like a rugrat
It's niggas like you that make a bitch wanna wil' out
Put a brick through you windshield
I don't care how your fam or your fake ass friends feel
Since day one I've always been real
But you took it for granted damnit
You got me actin foul
Think you a playa international?
Got your bank card know your pin number so I'm cashin now
On some funny shit look who's laughing now
I'ma sell all the jewelry you left behind
Me being deaf, dumb, and blind
Instead of being two steps ahead I was a step behind
Thought you never gonna wreck my mind

[Hook x2]

[Background Hook]
I don't care though
You can go now
Pack your shit up
I don't need you

[Verse 2]
You messed with my mind was the worse thing you ever did
I ain't the one for the wedding ring
Your doing this for your benefit
You degenerate
Stab me in the back like a Benidect
But I blame myself for being blind for the scrub type
Should've knew from the getgo
But it's cool I can live I can learn get wise to my life
It ain't hard for me to let go
I'm a strong ass woman
Ain't no way I'm gonna be depressed
Let a nigga try to wear me down
Now the rain is gone I can see clearly now
Where my mentals at you should fear me now
Look really how
Did you think I wouldn't pay ya back
Your a bitch for the way you act
You want to be in the front while I played the back
And you think that I'm gonna be ok wit that?
That's crazy wack
You ain't never wanna help the team
Did things that I felt were mean
But I let it all go
Never paid it no mind
Even though you tried to fuck with my self-esteem
When you dealt with me you had things that you never had
Niggas knew I was your better half
Now you got a new bitch
Pray to God hope she know about me
And if not I'm gonna tell her ass
Stella had to get her groove back
Nigga move back
Who me I'm just moving on
Mary J. said the best when said that I'm not gon cry
Mothafucka thought you'd knew the song
But I'mma leave it alone
Cus I'm a bigga bitch
Even though another chick'll prolly try to get you fast
He should've died
Keep this in mind
Mothafucka wish I never would've met your ass

[Hook until fades out x4]
