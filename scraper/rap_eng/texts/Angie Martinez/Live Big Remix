[Angie Martinez] Oh!

It's what the world's been waitin for, live big, car keys the remix

[Fat Joe] Yeah!
[Sacario] Angela, Joey Crack
[Fat Joe] Pick the music up man
[Angie M] Let's do it
[Sacario] We 'gon keep doin this
[Fat Joe] Gangsta

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Yo! We leak heat on the streets, still they doubted it
When I could easily eat any emcee who think he 'bout it
Flows sickenin, either your under a rock
Or ya mothafuckers is just not listenin
And I don't me to sound hard or calice
But if you keep sleepin on Joe it just could result to violence
A couple of shots a clear the place
Brrrrraaaappppp! Cocksuckers we here to stay
It's the cook coke man, one 'mo gain
How the fuck you gettin dough when you look broke man?
It's the mink coat man, cost me nothin
See me jumpin in the pool with it just for frontin
And the chicks love the fat guy, I wish it's cause of the dick
But I bet it's cause of the chips and the fast life
Me and Ange livin big forever
Think a click fuckin with this man whatever

[Chorus: Sacario]
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that dough, you don't need a nigga that trip
And everybody with car keys only big car keys
Pull out your car keys everybody please
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that though, even on a remix chick
And everybody with car keys only big car keys
Pull out your car keys everybody please

[Verse 2: Angie Martinez]
Oh! It's just me the O.G
And since this live big let's start with B.I.G
And rep it for Big Pun and do it for Big L
And since I got a big truck you know I live well
On the remix, other stations I can't agree with
I been here for ten years ain't never leavin
It's been clear I went there so you could see shit
Let them fear we not scared it ain't a secret
Hope you prepared in the streets get ready
Cause we keep this steady, Animal House piece is heavy
Do more hotlines than hot nine
Keep your hand on your mouth cause we get very
Ugly out there, trust me out there
They love me out there, from Miami back to here
It's a new day I'm battin up, with homeruns
Sacario four album and I'm droppin this summer

[Chorus: Sacario]
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that dough, you don't need a nigga that trip
And everybody with car keys only big car keys
Pull out your car keys everybody please
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that though, even on a remix chick
And everybody with car keys only big car keys
Pull out your car keys everybody please

[Verse 3: Sacario]
Mr. Guantalo ay still eat where you won't be seated
Still shop where you won't be greated
Since the double XL there ain't a spot that they don't be peakin
And live big number one record northeast region
So stop breathin, I'll let you shop for scraps soon after I eat
This is the remix back with the beat
Clowns, take them scraps home don't be proud
Cristal don't make tops so we don't drink we pour our
I know I make you sick so call out
Like my soles latino crowds stomp the floor out
Sacario crew, still tigre out
Sixty deep at Jimmy's and I got the technicians with me
I'm just here to take all y'all chicks
To make all this money and drive all y'all sick
And I never, 'gon, stop remix
My own shit is problems whenever I drop

[Chorus: Sacario]
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that dough, you don't need a nigga that trip
And everybody with car keys only big car keys
Pull out your car keys everybody please
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that though, even on a remix chick
And everybody with car keys only big car keys
Pull out your car keys everybody please

[Outro: Angie Martinez]
[Laughing] It's the remix baby, Animal House, Angela, Sacario, Joe Crack
