Christmas in the city, boy
Ain't nothing like it (word up)
Yo, remember last year
I think we was on tour last year
I ain't tryin' to be (word up) in the city
That's what I want
Christmas in the city

Christmas jams at the tunnel
Chop through hustle and bustle
Snow and lights make wonderland
Out of this concrete jungle

There's a miracle on 34th Street
On a train, yeah, that lady
With all them bags, you see

Radio City for the Christmas show
We making Angels in the snow
Giving honey lots of kisses under Mistletoe

Snowball fights at courtyards
See Spanish Harlem sing Feliz Navidad
New York state of mind
At Christmas time
In the city

All the children showing
Their new clothes and toys and things
That they got for Christmas, this year
Their full of happiness and cheer

On Christmas in the city
I'm so glad I'm living
To see another Christmas Day
Got to show the Lord I appreciate
His blessings on this special day
It's Christmas in the city (hey)

CHORUS:
Christmas in the city
(Christmas in the city)
Ain't no place I'd rather be (yeah, oh)
Out of all the places I could be
I'd rather be
(I'd rather be)
In New York, chilly

Rockefeller Center
Has the biggest Christmas tree of all
You can go downtown and see it all
I guarantee you'll have a ball
On Christmas in the city

Something about this atmosphere
Makes me want to stay right here
I can see the city lights
Watch the cab drivers fuss and fight, on Broadway
And it's Christmas, Christmas, yeah

CHORUS

CHORUS

I want to be chilly
La, la, la ,la ,la
La, la, la, la, la
Out of all the places I could be
I'd rather be home, chilly

CHORUS

CHORUS

CHORUS (Fade out)
