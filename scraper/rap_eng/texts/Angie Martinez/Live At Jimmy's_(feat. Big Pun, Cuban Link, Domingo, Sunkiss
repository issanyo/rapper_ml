A sete bailar, tu ve el berau; va se congio, tigeraso..

[Chorus]
Jimmy, "Copa Cabana," in Miami, Little Habana
Aiy.. Latin Quarters, la Gran Manzana
We're gonna party hasta por la manjana

Gozando en Colombia, Venezuela y la Bahamas

Ven con migo mami, porque esto nadie lo para
Aiy..

[Angie Martinez - overlapping Chorus]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, yo yo, yo
Bubble heavy in the club, double Henne' in the cup
Trouble and merengue make you move yo' butt
Got the fella's goin' nuts, girl it's too much
Got me four numbers already, the night's still young
Papi work the room, 'mance 'em like WHAT!
Mami got no shoes, hair done like WHAT!
Me, you - speed through
Yeah, yeah good to meet'cha; how you doin'?
Afraid to be the one baby take it floor
Don't say nuttin' dumb, maybe we could do more!
Cause it's our night and it's okay!
Work hard - okay now we ready to play!
And the J, the I, the M, the M, the Y, the J, the I, the M
At Jimmy's.. at Jimmy's!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Uhh.. creep to yo' block in the black Cadillac
You could go wit' a grey Mac, BRRRA!
Run, duck; son, what the fuck?
See my tattoo, got Pun on my gut
Bag yo' chick; give a nun a million bucks
Curse me out, call me a bum and a slut
Cause I bust quick like a ton in a cut
Then I broke out wit' more guns in a stro'!
[Cuban Link]
Yo, yo..
Ain't nuttin' stoppin' us from droppin'
And rockin' the whole and droppin' us
The lockin' this down, strait up and down
We too hot to miss, we got the shit to make 'em loose it
They can't refuse it
Cause it ain't nuttin' like hip hop music!
New shit! Took a merengue beat loot it
Exclusive, it died down, this shit stupid!
Who's this? Cuban Link, no te asuste!
Don't mean to drop the bomb, I got the fuse slit

[Chorus]

[Angie Martinez - overlapping Chorus]
Whoo, whoo.. hey!
Stro' like swellin', smoke everywhere
Dance all sudden, hands in the air
Par in the back, ballers in the rear
Find me 'round there, bottles by the beer, yeah
All right cause it feels real good
And good wood from a nigga in the hood
Ladies - shake it, shake it real girl should
Let it be understood
That I'm wit' my friends and we ready to go
Connects wit' (?) to Santo Domingo!
And I, won't west 'til I poppin' at the show
Watchin' all my people shoutin' "Go, ma, go!"
So get it up, get it up (uh-oh, uh-oh!)
Shake it down, shake it down (uh-oh, uh-oh!)
If we havin' big fun (uh-oh, uh-oh!)
If you rep' Big Pun (uh-oh, uh-oh!)
C'mon..

[Chorus]
[Big Pun]
Boriqua, morena; girl I wanna take ya back to Cuba (Cuba)
Habana (Habana), c'mon you pretty mama
Jamaica, Puerto Rico or Santo Domingo
We could take it there!
Yeah, yeah; and put yourself try a player result

[Chorus]
.. and put yourself try a player result..
.. and put yourself try a player result..
.. and put yourself try a player result..
.. and put yourself try a player result..
