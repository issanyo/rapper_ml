It's the big bamboo rollin' (rollin')
Prada purse swollen (swollen)
Ben franklin foldin', we here to get it goin'
'bout to bust in the party wit' my people (wit' my people)
Flyin' out west side in my zito (zito!)
And I'm sittin' on chrome, status well known
From a small lot in brooklyn, I buy this side chrome (okay!)
If you wit' me let me hear ya (aight, aight!)
And if you lift it and you feelin' (aight, aight!)
Cozmos when I toastin'
Crackin' jokes wit' my girls, clown roastin' (how high? )
Fake ballers in the spot high postin'
Get out my air, can't you see my lows are frozen? (we!)
You see niggas be partyin', checkin' out my body and
Get out outta hand I gotta quarter terror squadians
Or do-double-g'll come and get'cha
Get the picture (who is ya), they'll flip ya (f'real)
