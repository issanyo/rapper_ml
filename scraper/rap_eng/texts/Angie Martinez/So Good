{A. Martinez}
He was all I wanted
Late night talking
On the phone, till day light often
At home he came through
Dinner on the table play fights forced him
The love was strong then, we went for walks then
Then I lost him, I mean he still here but I ignore him
Cuz hes to busy for me, he come around few minutes then leave
Things ain't the way they use to be
Then I met this guy right down the street
This is what he said to me

{Chorus}
Hello good looking
Tell me how are you
Everytime I see you ???
Your looking sooo good
Lemme show you gurl
I can be soo good

{A. Martinez}
Yo... uh..
I tried to work things out
Bring things back
Arguments started, you don't know how to act
Could have brought up fact how today
I met this new dude and I ain't even sat it
He pro'ly would have thought I was playin
And he pro'ly would have said stop playin
But its bull shit, I'm bout to stop taking
Cuz this new guy body drop, waiting
I ain't playin, he played himself
He needs space or time or wealth
You can have all the space in tha world
And ya man might find another girl

{Chourus}
Even though you don't know me
But what can I do
Let me see you girl
One sturday
Just let me show you gurl
I can be soo good

{A. Martinez}
Every girl need affection
Not somebody who stressing
Hope he learned his lesson
Cuz in one direction
You can't see to the left,then
You stuck with a  dumb fuck
Who don't understand, that one truck
Don't matter to you, no car, krib either
Just you and him in a two seater
But they always find out when its to late
Telling me to wait, no you wait
Wait till you see me In his arm
Then understand that I'm gone

{chorus}
Hello good looking
Tell me how are you
I see you gurl walking down on avenue
Let me show you gurl
I can be soo good

Even though you don't know me
Tell me what I can do
To make me see you gurl
One sweet Saturday
Cuz if you let me gurl
I can be soo good
