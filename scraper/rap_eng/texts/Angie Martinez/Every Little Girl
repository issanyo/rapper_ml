[Big Pun]
Yo, yo, Angie, come downstairs
The pump is open

Hurry up, ma!
Put your socks, put your slippers on!
C'mon ma hurry!
(Alright then, I got it)

[The Product G&B]
Oooohhh Angie..
Ooo-whoaaaa, yeahhh..
Oooh yeah hooooo whoahhhh, ohhh-ye ohhhhh-yeah

[Angie Martinez]
Uh, yeah (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Uh (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Uh-uh-uh uh-ah uh-ah-uh-ah

I started in Brooklyn
Coming up in the game
Everybody has a story
Mine wasn't the same

Angela, delinquent
I thought I was grown
I went through a lot things way before I was known
See, my moms
She never knew I would make it all start
She was through with the bad grades
The late nights in the park

Causing my mom pain
My life was in the dirt
I played hooky all day while she was hard at work
Sorry, ma
Know it was hard and my pops was a jerk
She packed her shit and got us out of there before it got worse

Moved the fam to Miami in hopes of changin my ways
A big portion of my mind still remained in a daze
It wasn't 'til we came back my life matured
Success would be the only thing that I was fightin for
I was determined to get there, and keep it hot
Since that day my only goal was to reach the top

[Hook: The Product G&B]
To every little girl, on every block
That's comin of age tryin to reach the top
I said no matter who you are, you can reach the stars
But never forget, how fragile you are, cause a girl is fragile

[Angela Martinez]
It's crazy
When I think back, sometimes I have to cry
Cause when you young, you don't see how life can pass you by
You don't even really care if you gon' starve or not
This go back to ninety-three when I got the job at Hot

I used to answer the phones for Flex
Do overnight spurts
Back then, I was like, "Hey who knows?  It might work"
I wasn't satisfied, but it would just begin
Cause in ninety-five
I was every day, six to ten

I put in a lot of work so I could bring in my listeners
I secured a fanbase
Although some of them dissed us
I was new at my thang
But I was doin my thang
And I would never let nobody try to ruin my thang
But of course, there were people couldn't stand where I was

Cause although know I'm in
I wasn't made what I was
Through the heat, kept it moving
Throw the haters a smile
What would they do if they knew her heart was fragile?

Angela.. (uh-huh)
Angela.. (hahahah)
Angela.. (wooh!)
Angela.. (uhh, uhh)

[Angie Martinez]
Overall, it's a rough business
It could stop even you
There's people that's gonna say things that's not even true
Like the one about me not bein down for my women
And I hated the lesbian rumors that went around for a minute
How bout the one that goes, 'Yeah, she goes with him
He bought her the car, the ice, the clothes and rims.'
And I'm sure you all heard she caught one dead in the face

It'd been different if she said what she said to my face
As for men
Who knows where my story will start
I went through a relationship that nearly tore me apart

So I'm chillin for now
It's all about me for the moment
Cause there's things that I wouldn't allow
But I'mma be aight though, keep comin with tight flow
Try to stay on the low while I'm watchin your hype grow
Playin the role like nobody can cramp your style
But I know, like you know, that you're fragile

[Hook]
