[Intro]
The brightest diamonds ever known
Yeah, Angie Mar
T-Ice
Take it to the record

[Verse One: Angie Martinez]
I wish you understood how I feel
Cause these words is real
After that bullshit
I coulda prefered to chill
But tell you what you deserve to get
But I still sat back and heard your shit
You said chill it wasn't shit
But come on I deserve to be mad
That whole situation was bad
I wish there was one of those moments in it
I could break and just laugh
But it was too serious to take what I had
I mean what I had was deep
Its still deep but damn
Its sad to see how one weekend could be like damn
One situation
See I can't
Have this type of relation
Hes my man
Or, hes my nigga
Or, hes my ...
Try to understand
Please pa, honest is the plan
And I don't mean
Please pa, beggin with my hands
I mean like
Please pa, got feelings, damn

[Hook: Tony Sunshine]
See, I know what you're facing
This fucked up situation
And maybe she might like me
Mami, leaving ain't like me

Cause baby you're a part of me
And baby its just hard to see
That you could flip anyday
But you would love me anyway

[Verse Two: Angie Martinez]
Ah Yea I know know I was wrong too
I made the wrong move
I went and looked throught someting that belonged to you
And I found out suttin
I was all confused
Mixed emotions coming
Feeling all abused
Shocked when I read
Who you was calling boo
Dropped it and I left
Stormed out
No talking to you
You'll never understand
How I felt
Waking downstairs
And you knew something was wrong
But I had to finish that song
Couple minutes
Didn't really take me that long
Still feeling confused
But I had to go strong and attract
And relax, sit back
Then you came in
And you asked whats wrong
The facts is blatant
I didn't have to say it
Stop playing
Shit, at that point
Even you knew I was OK to flip
How could you
No matter what you thought we was
Just throw around a word called love
Come on

[Hook: Tony Sunshine]
See, I know what you're facing
This fucked up situation
And maybe she might like me
Mami, leaving ain't like me

Baby youre a part of me
And baby its just hard to see
That you could flip everyday
But you would love me anyway

[Verse Three: Angie Martinez]
Thats exactly how it is
Exactly what I'm talking about
Exactly where it'll end up
This song after I'm walkin out
Niggas don't understand
When you give them your all
How many times you hang up
When you're daying to call
Try to dial his numbers
And you start with the first four
When you get to seven
Your heart beat like you're eleven
I learned my lesson
And I waive if there was any
I still try to understand shit
With out no henny
Just a clear mind
While you're thinking its just mere rhymes
I gotta go through this shit
And still report fine
And get on air
Be clear
Animal for real
Each year
The bullshit going on
I'm prepared
I ain't the only one
Chicks be going through it
Niggas don't understand
We be borderline losing it
And these feelings is real
So like I said in the first verse
I wish you understood how I feel for real

[Hook: Tony Sunshine]
See, I know what you're facing
This fucked up situation
And maybe she might like me
Mami, leaving ain't like me

Cause baby you're a part of me
And baby its just hard to see
That you could flip everyday
But you would love me anyway
