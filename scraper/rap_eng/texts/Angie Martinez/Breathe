Yo, yo, yo, uhh, uhh, yo, yo, whoo whoo whoo whoo, yo, uhh, hey!
Sometimes you gotta, catch yo' breath and
All the time you gotta watch yo' step and
Catch me all on yo' neck, stressin 'bout "What you doin next?"
And I ain't got much left, tolerance wit a hoop-la
La hodienda no se para nunca, yeah
They give it to you but I
Keep it movin while I'm runnin wit the rap race
But I need a little damn space, to breathe
I gotta just do me, why I always gotta be sexy huh?
Would you mind when you spill it like me?
In a pair of Air Max sweat pants hoodie huh?
Would ya, get off my back, c'mon, let a nigga relax
Cause I'm, all woman now, hear me roar
Right now I'm 'bout to hit the door
So I can parlay, it's my day, 'bout to pick up my girls at the highway
Gotta get away, gotta do it now, gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah

[Hook: Angie & Mary J. Blige]
[Angie] Gotta be free, gotta do me
[Blige] Gotta get away, get away
[Angie] Gotta gimmie some time to breathe
[Blige] Gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah
[Angie] C'mon ladies come ride wit me
[Blige] Gotta get away, get away
[Angie] Gotta relax your body!
[Blige] Gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah
I just really need some time
To ease my mind and let my spirit go

[Angie]
How many women cook and clean, wash the clothes
Work a job, come home, mop the floors, watch the soaps?
Nah, no time for that, besides The Young and the Restless is kinda wack
Plus thats that time you can be in the gym
Gettin ya legs tight, gettin ya head right
Doin it every night in summer time almost
You wanna ass lookin firm when they come up close
One of single mother types wit a couple of kids?
Nuttin come before them, don't give a fuck who it is
You a proud ass woman, never cry for help
Been doin it for years all by yourself
For cryin out loud, can ya get your props?
Wanna pull your hair out cause the shit don't stop and
Ya nigga wanna stress, gettin no rest
Takin no breaths, it's P.M.S
Wanna know when do I get my day
Wanna pick up my girls at the highway
Gotta get away, gotta do it now, gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah

[Angie over Hook]

Yo neccesito un poco de paz -- en mi vida
Neccesito un poco de paz -- en mi vida

[Mary J. Blige]
Some times a girl just wants to be free
From what you think of me baby please
Get up off my back and give a girl some space
Because we're livin in a big bad place
I just really need some time to have a little piece of mind and
(breathe) breeeaathe!
