FEAT. UNEEK

On any day, in the hood
In front of any building
You can find some chicks
And what will they talk about?
Niggas
(Angie:)
Yo, yo get the f*** outta here
(Uneek:)
Yeah, that f***in' bum motherf***er
(Uneek:)
Pico and sh*t from
Around the corner
That nigga be wildin'

(Angie:)
Uh-huh, yeah

(Uneek:)
I know this player named Ricky
Push an 850
Light-skinned, slim
With a head like Sticky
All you gotta do girlfriend
Is slip a mickie
And in a quickie
Ricky turns into tricky

(Angie:)
Aiyyo but what about his man?
'Cause named Stan
Run around town in
The plush Benz van
Ice all around his Rolex band
But runnin' his mouth 'bout
His credit card scams

(Uneek:)
Yeah jerk that nigga
I heard of that nigga
The crew of quick niggas
Wanna murder that nigga, sh*t
He must be listenin'
To too much Jigga
Buddy Longdough
He got no figures

(Angie:)
Yo, aiyyo I know you know
Ralph, up on Tiebout
He a Puerto Rican cat
Yeah you know he eat out
Walk around town with
The weed and heat out
And he loco in the coco
Dank weed out

(Angie and Uneek:)
All over the world
Niggas got a story to tell
Is you fly as f***
Or you broke as hell?
What set you claim nigga
Is you thug or what?
What set you claim nigga
Is it love or what?
(x2)

(Angie:)
Rude boy name Brian
Nigga stay lyin'
Got regular, but
He swear it's Hawaiian
Part time dealer, part time client
Smokin' up what
He should be supplyin'

(Uneek:)
And yo that kid Black
Don't know how to act
Wanna keep the Timbs on
When he hit it from the back
(Oop)
Pullin' on my hair
Almost loosened up a track
But I like that kid
He can keep comin' back

(Angie:)
Everybody back up
Back up off the ropes
All you silly niggas are
Gonna have to back up
We're gonna need all silly niggas
Tback up off the ropes
Move back, back
Back, back
