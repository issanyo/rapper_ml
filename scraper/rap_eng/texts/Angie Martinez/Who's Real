Sway Calloway:
ItsTheReal... Let me tell you what's wrong with this song, ironically; is that it sounds better than most rap we're hearing right now

Scott Rogowsky:
So ItsTheReal, you've been doing this stuff for five, six years, the videos... well all of the sudden you decide, "what the hell, I'm gonna get in on the game? I've been making fun of them long enough, let's do it ourselves?"

Eric:
Yes!

Combat Jack:
So Just, the whole album is dope, man, you co-sign ItsTheReal and their entire album?

Just Blaze:
Look, I like everything they played me when they played me their first couple of tracks; I thought it was dope
