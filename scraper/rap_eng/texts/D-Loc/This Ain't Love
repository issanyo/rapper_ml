[Hook: Big TC]
This ain't love, this ain't trust
This ain't honesty, sure ain't us
This ain't love, this ain't love, no

[Verse 1: Big TC]
They accusin' me, verbally abusin' me
Whatchu do to me, baby whatchu do to me
Who you talking to?
Baby, who you been talking to now?, I know
Why you stressin' me always want to question me?
Whatchu doin'? You sabotagin' the family
Why you wanna fight? Baby, you should listen to me
You know, girl you know you mine for life, oh yeah
And you will always be just fine, oh no
I said lovin' you ain't easy
Swear you gonna leave me, that's fine you can go
You can go

[Chorus: Big TC]
This ain't love, this ain't trust
This ain't honesty, sure ain't us
This ain't love, this ain't love, no

[Verse 2: D-Loc]
'Remember, you was fuckin' my sheets up
Now I'm like should I get a pre-nup
If not, she gon' get half of your shit
So it's cheeper to keep her, 'cause you gonna need Jesus after the split
Shit, I love my music too much, I'm in love
Get on my fuckin' nerve, now can I beat it up?
'Cause you don't know what you on
Why you all in my phone?
You need to take your ass home
[?]

[Chorus: Big TC]
This ain't love, this ain't trust
This ain't loyalty, can't be, no, no
This ain't love, this ain't love, no

[Verse 3: TeeCee4800]
Uh, This ain't love, this ain't love, this ain't love, no
You call me once, you call me twice, I miss your phone call
What that mean? I'm tryna' get up in that bitch drunk
And why you trippin', stop playin' like I got caught
You need to stop lettin' all these bitches get in our way
Why you actin' insecure? 'Cause I made you that way
I'm tryna' make a change, you just fussin' and makin' a case
You said, "It's too late, get your shit," 'cause you're movin' today
I know I fucked up, yeah, I know I fucked up
We was together 7 years, only 3 we had trust
Now you got a baby by another nigga
Now I gotta sit and look at all these pictures
This ain't love nigga, this ain't love homie
I'm tryna' get rich, swear to god they made it hard for the next bitch

[Chorus: Big TC]
This ain't love, this ain't trust
This ain't honesty, sure ain't us
This ain't love, this ain't love, No

[Outro]
Yeah
Big TC and D-loc
