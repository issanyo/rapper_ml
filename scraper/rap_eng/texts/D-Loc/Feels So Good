[Verse 1]
Let me break this bread
So I can pop my collar
Put this shit down y'all can call me your poppa
I slide through, let my motherfucking nuts hang
Give a fuck like an old school gang bang
Double-dash one time for your mind yo
Double-dash always got the hydro
With the captin and coat to match
You dont like me in the front you can see me back, woah!
Rock a party, smoke a blunt
I keep the crowd moving when I'm up in the club
Rock a party, smoke a blunt
I keep the crowd moving when I'm up in the club
Got 'em all saying with their hands up
"It feels so good, it feels so good"
Got 'em all saying while not giving a fuck
"It feels so good so I wish you would"

[Hook]
It feels so good
When everything's going right
Cause you got your shit together
And your bank roll is tight
It feels so good
When your money stacks high
And you got alot of weed and a big supply
It feels so good
When everything's going smooth
And you got a sexy girl to get you in the mood
It feels so good
So I wish you would
It feels so good, it feels so good

[Verse 2]
Now it's time to get my boogie on, let's bounce this bitch
I got the club bumping with the Subnoize shit
Got my cap down, got my pants sagging
Got the bud smoke by the pounds never lacking
Double-dash shit, fuck a bitch
I turn the motherfucking party out in a minute
Where's my drinks at?
Where's my dogs at?
Where's my blunts at?
I gots to have that
I gots to have this
I gots to have that
We do it again with a little more twist
I gots to have this
I gots to have that
We do it again with a little more twist
Can't gain mine
You know the King Klick
Kingspade shit bitch take a hit of this
That's whats up
I rock the party on the cut
Spitting flows, getting drunk

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm startin to get drunk
Time to get my swerve on
I'm holdin down the stage like a motherfucking Don
This shit's 'bout to pop and this mic here is hot
I spit a paragraph dog and blow up the spot
Get up in that ass and make a motherfucker feel me
Talk that big shit get ripped down and dirty
Bust out a sling shot, put a lyric in it
Slap a buster upside his head and make him hear it
Big shit, double-dash like to talk it
You got something to say you can see me in my office
I'll sign you off like I'm cashing a check
Six figure biggie doggy who wanna step?
I'mma stomp 'em king kong 'em
Gorilla Godzilla I'mma dog em
I'mma gets 'em, how I gets em
Got the whole place feeling good, vibing on my rhythm

[Hook]

[Outro]
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
So I wish you would
It feels so good, it feels so good
