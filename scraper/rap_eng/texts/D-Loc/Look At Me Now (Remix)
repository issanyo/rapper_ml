Lemme eat this beat like a BBQ rib
Homie don't trip let me bleed this bic
Lemme empty this slip so I can pack another rip
Is this all it took to get you on my motherfucking dick?

[Verse 2]
I smoke that bombing shit alwas got that sack sitting on my hip

Boaty got the bomb don't trip you know it I'm Stonetown legit got all the fine laddies on my dick and now its time to blow it
Let's go
Here we go again need to run and tell your friends that I rap to a beat from beginning to the end
And needa know everything every body know my name need roll up the green this the gold for the Kings
When I toke on the green I'mma say what I mean I'mma do what I do like I drink and blow steam I'mma King
Give me dollar bills on my feel I'mma put it in my pocket money hungry I'm my beat
Eat this food when it's on my plate better taste this case stay great like lakes
Smash these greats take it out you fakes fill my safe with Ben Franklin's face
D-double dash when I dash when I match got a little bit of this got a little bit of that
When it's in my hand gotta roll it by the gram now my eyes are low wear a blind to Japan
I'm high like Superman I be flying through the air hanging out while I fly like a California bear
Looking down on my land people looking I dont care makin grams on my look get payed for the wear
Style with japan like a peach to a plum like a rich vs a mall drinkin vodka with the rum
You can walk over run to the mall spend a 100 to the bank in my wallet drop a ton
Money money money gotta get it spending money money money money money all the time
Get money when the money's on my mind gotta get another 40 makin money with the rhyme play the money dummy
Money money money gotta get it spending money money money money money all the time
Get money when the moneys on my mind gotta get another 40 makin money with the rhyme play the money dummy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

When I rock to the beat everybody wanna peep gotta lett 'em all know about the Kottonmouth Kings

Don't get loud cause you know what I did I put it under the mat back in '96
We smoke that bombing shit alwas got that sack sittin on my hip
Pack another rip tryin take another trip we spaceship ridin im shotgun bitch
Do it like this I'll do it like what I'll ban the beat ima fuck it in the butt
Talk that shit I'll walk the walk gonna see my logo walk your block
Gotta keep it high when I got my spot gotta smoke my body to do it right
Needa grab this light feed your pipe rock this mic I'll kick your ass
Put it to bed I'll put it to sleep these white boys are throwin up the kings
