[Verse 1: TeeCee4800]
Tell 'em how we did it
How we crippin', niggas ain't with it
NY hat, nigga that's my fitted
Where you at? nigga be 'pecific
I pull up quick, that's how I'm crippin'
Two hundred racks all in my vision
But I'll take more 'cause ain't no limit
Ran through hoes, you can call me Emmitt
TeeCee the loc 'bout his business
None of our money 'cause I ain't in it
Bitch been broke for way too long
Now look how a nigga living
D. Loc been gone way too long
Now look how a nigga living
All we need is TC home
Man that'd be crippin'

[Chorus: TeeCee4800]
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Snitchin' on your crippin'
Why you playin' with this crippin'?
Any little thing then we trippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Everything I do, I do it twice
New Mercedes for the player price
Bitches talkin' 'bout they want some ease
Call the lords if you need a vice
Niggas call the phone to put me on
Would if they was talkin' 'bout the set
Would if they was talkin' 'bout a check
Group of gangsters gets you no respect
Swear I'm never seen up in the streets
Like that's where the fuck I'm supposed to be
Did this shit, I live this shit, believe
Over shit so now I'm overseas
Loc killed him, caught him with his niece
Army shells crazy in the Beach
I'm the one that told 'em 'bout the Norf
You the one that don't nobody know

[Chorus: TeeCee4800]
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Snitchin' on your crippin'
Why you playin' with this crippin'?
Any little thing then we trippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'

[Verse 3: D. Loc]
Tell 'em how you crippin'
With a four-fifth, nigga poppin' that clip in
If a nigga want trip, he can smoke the fishes
Little old bitch, that's how I'm living
Spit 'til the nigga get hit
Wig get split, tryna hit that fence
Then I slide off in that whip
Man they still don't know who did it
Don't believe I never gave a fuck
Liquor with the snickers, throwing up
Can't you see my niggas goin' up?
MTM, my niggas goin' nuts
Lil homies, homegirls or the homies, yeah we gon' ride
This the type of shit gone see all day in the mob

[Chorus: TeeCee4800]
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Snitchin' on your crippin'
Why you playin' with this crippin'?
Any little thing then we trippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
Tell 'em how we crippin'
