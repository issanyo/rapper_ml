Part 1: Miracle

[Intro]
Another Midtown Classic…

[Verse 1: Big T.C.]
Like life’s a miracle and a blessing
Every trial and test is a lesson
Gotta seek the truth and stop guessing
Ain’t got no room for doubts so ask questions
Knowledge is the most powerful weapon
Gotta forward march, no half stepping
I’ve learned, learned, learned
Ooh ohh, ooh ohhh
My Momma really tried to keep me out the terrors there of the hood (yeah)
Did everything that they told me that I can’t
To show ‘em that I could, oh yeah
People always told me that I was bad
I was misunderstood!
But, I admit that I was lost
Click, click, do ya, do ya, yeah (ohh, ohh)
Had to learn the hard way, it's smoke won’t burn along as you go
It’s a miracle I’m still standing (Still standing)
Woke up with the crosstown beefin’ in my own town only in the midtown
Never thought that I would make it
But, on my Momma, I’m on now

[Hook: Big T.C.]
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
It’s a miracle, Ooh ohh, ooh ohh

[Verse 2: D-Loc]
I remember when they doubted us
Kicked us while we was down, don’t want to help us up
Damn!
Indoctrinated and banging before I could bust a nut
Cuttin’ up, couldn’t shut him/‘em up
Now I’m on my way upstate
Locked up [?] gang bang[?]
This remind me of the time I survived
But in my mind I knew that my date came up
Knew it was God!
Momma tried, but she couldn’t save him/‘em
And now we on our way up
[?] Hitting[?]on that [?]prison brick[?] on the way they anticipate
And they say it like
Waiting on judgement day (huh)
Now they praise us
But we downplay fame, and stay prayed up
Look where we came from from
Yeah, we caged up, but they couldn't enslave us
Now they’re payin’ us, yup (miracle)

[Hook: Big T.C.]
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
It’s a miracle, Ooh ohh, ooh ohh
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
It’s a miracle, Ooh, ohh, ohh

[Scatting]

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
It’s a miracle
How they stayed hatin’ on us, guess they didn’t know
We them boys, we them niggas
Look at all this money and all these bitches
But it’s the realness of a millions
Keep God first and fuck them niggas
That switched up and got caught up in they feelings
I kept my ten toes down like I’m ‘sposed to
Stay focused like I’m ‘sposed to
And stay away from them broke dudes, like I’m ‘sposed to
(oh, oh) Oh yeah! It’s a miracle!
It’s a miracle! It’s a miracle!
‘Cause, on my Momma, I’m on now! Ohh, oh

[Hook: Big T.C. & Ty Dolla $ign]
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle (oh oh)
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle (It’s a miracle!)
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle (ohh ohh ohh)
It’s a miracle, Ooh ohh, ooh ohh (oh!)
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle (a miracle!)
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle (ohh oh)
(Ohh, oh) It’s a miracle
It’s a miracle, Ooh, ohh, ohh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhhh
Ooh yeah!

How did we end up in this bathroom?
If you don’t mind?… I don’t either
Long as we can keep a secret, we’ll be fine!

You a beast, you a animal
The way you ride that pole (that pole) Ohhh oh
