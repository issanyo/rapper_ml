[Verse One]
As I recall it
I first started to only get dap
To show the cats on my block and in my school that I could rap
They knew me as a B-Boy
Now I burst a verse and added piece to my collection
Twice that for the selection
I chose this direction cause I was an expert
At not only art, plus I had the ill footwork
Dancing supreme, flares, crabs, slice and windmill
Twelve years was the age, by then I had the will
I knew deep in my heart that if I came up with a scheme
To use my tools and my skills I'd fulfill my rap dreams
Started copping LP's as the years went by
Noticing the different styles and how MC's sound fly
P.E., J.B.'s, Rakim, Red Alert
KRS, Marley Marl, Juice Crew and B.L.S
The state of fresh plus a mess inbetween
That makes up my whole aura as an MC fiend

"Don't think you can before you start rapping" - Fat Joe
Labels, A&R, marketing schemes
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Looking at contracts and don't know what it mean
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Per diem, promo shows worth no doe
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know

[Verse Two]
To get my props as a pro I entered local talent shows
Cause I knew without my lessons my profession wouldn't grow
Battle cats in my school, in the street or in the club
Made a name for myself, everybody showed me love
But there was still something missing from my flavor of the month
So I sold out for a partner that was ill from the jump
Enter Tame One, lyric extrodinar
Two superb legionar, niggas couldn't compare
Slaying cats left and right, who performing tonight?
(That's them!)
Damn right, known to always be nice
Count was minimal but we didn't gain respect
Till 89.9, Bob and Armstrong Stretch
Official to the world or shall I say the industry
Now we hit from Dirty Jers' with the shit for NYC
Cause where we at, Jersey already on the map
So we uphold tradition so enters Artifacts

"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Executives in your ear telling you, you the shit
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Until your album comes out and there's nobody buying it
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Check the soundscan, [?] to see your flow
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know

[Verse Three]
Aight, the year is '94 and we signed a record deal, put your boots on
Big Beat/Atlantic was the shield
On the real, the first album was a dope experience
Hear my voice on wax over T-Ray instruments
Hitting tours and all
From a song talking 'bout writing on the wall
Many thought we had balls
We knew it was the plan, laid the whole program
Between A Rock And Hard Place, the label didn't understand
Example yo, my nigga listen to this
We would've blown from a vid' off the Busta remix
Second album mad pressure but we did that shit
Came with The Ultimate, a plaque, one tour, we split
Now the whole world shaking cause they knew that we was breaking
No more cans to be shaking, know the scores that we was lacing
From this I took a two year break and I was back
Cause I can't be stopped from getting mine, fuck that

"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
How it affects your life and how those around you feel your strife
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Whether you like it or not, the hottest MC can get dropped
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Keep your day job, messing with this you get robbed
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
