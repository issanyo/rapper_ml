Intro:
No Don’t think About it
No Don’t think about it
No  Don’t Think About It
Just do it, do it

V 1
I act on impulse, it’s all me, homie
If I add to insult, you’re salty
Don’t think before I open my mouth
Take it with a grain of salt, im sorry

Don’t be, and don’t let it be a let down
When she say how does friends sound
Can’t change how it went down
All my ex’s get x’ed out
And then ya put em in the x-files

I’m a little like you
And you a little like me
On this little old stage
In this little old scene
Look at me just breathe
If I didn’t give a – Ugh
Bet I could’ve been so much
Bet we could’ve been so much
But the time ain't up
Bet that we could still be us
Bet that we could still find…
Don’t think about it

Chorus:
No Don’t think About it
No Don’t think about it
No  Don’t Think About It
Just do it, do it

V2
New day and a new phase
Was it me or my new J’s
Feeling good in a good way
Never think about what you should say
That ain't gonna help you
Never let em tell you
You can do today tomorrow
And marinate
Why you waiting for the rain to fall
They say it's much better with a umbrella
Take a chance today
Come dance in the acid rain

When you down and out
And you stuck in a roundabout, Aye
But you don’t know, ya dont know
And you feeling like you bout to drown
Aye

Tell me annie are you okay, okay
Don’t pay no mind to the low wage
Coz you got time you got all day
But life won't ever knock twice
Take a chance on your own aye

Chorus:
No Don’t think About it
No Don’t think about it
No  Don’t Think About It
Just do it, do it

V3:
Step out of your thoughts
Why you always on gram
Why you never wanna talk
Why you always on snap
Why we always want more
Why we never content

Coz that’s ego
But what's worse is that’s really most people
Shit gets hard
So they really don’t see those
Parts of themselves
We all mean well
But sometimes we yell


Come on
Just vibe,  yo but don't think
Dont mind, im on my own thing
Let go of your inhibitions
Don't listen to the cynicism
Get high baby float with me

Truth is you could die today
Phone Call came an hour late
Impact of the crash missed you at that time and place
So don’t you ever wipe that smile away
Is all I’m trying to say

Chorus
