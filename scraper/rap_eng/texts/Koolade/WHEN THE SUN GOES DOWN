Intro:
Footsteps treading lighter
And the skylines growing brighter
When the sun go, go down

Verse 1:
Loving the way you look in the white round
Moonlight, licking her body like boy down
Vampire ain't got nothing on this mouth
Get wild when the Sun go down

The moon come out
The wolves’ gon’ howl, Koolade on tap
Baby you gon’ drown, get your feet wet
Or jump in the deep end, hope that you know now
What!? That when the sun go down

You probably gon’ drunk text with an old ex
And confess your love and your regrets 
And say you miss, your relationship
Reply was who dis?
When the sun come out

Pre Chorus:
Tomorrow ain’t coming
Tonight will be something
We remember all our lives

Chorus:
Footsteps treading lighter
And the skylines growing brighter
Stars might fade, but they’re replaced
By a beam of light
Shining from my eyes everyday
When the sun goes down

Baptised in the black light,  in pools of Patron
Capsized in the cab like, you should go home
Till the sound of the magpies, singing you your song
Pa rum pum pum pum
When the sun goes down

Move like that’s when the moonshine
Sipping on grappa, move in the moonlight
Make you mine tonight, lil mama
You the sunset to my, summer
When the sun go down


We like night owls
Loving lights out
This is my house
Let the wolf howl
At that white round
Blow a white cloud
Make a nice sound
Be polite now
Like you like Al
Hit em when the Sun come out

Pre Chorus:
Tomorrow ain’t coming
Tonight will be something
We remember all our lives

Chorus:
Footsteps treading lighter
And the skylines growing brighter
Stars might fade, but they’re replaced
By a beam of light
Shining from my eyes everyday
When the sun goes down

Dusk till dawn, till it dawn on me
Forget your thoughts; this is for your feet
Forties in a 4 door 4 x 4, oh lordy
In the morn they can mourn for me
When the sun goes down

That's when we get on our freak shit
And talk about how we really see shit
Pretending to be shit
Told them they can puzzle the weakness
And they looking but they struggle for pieces
When the sun go down

We drifting on a sailing rock
Chilling on the pale blue dot
When the sun go down
The cost of the brain cells lost
Was worth every memory we got
When the sun come out

Pre Chorus:
Tomorrow ain’t coming
Tonight will be something
We remember all our lives

Chorus:
Footsteps treading lighter
And the skylines growing brighter
Stars might fade, but they’re replaced
By a beam of light
Shining from my eyes everyday
When the sun goes down

Outro
Every day, every day we rise
Like the sun up top
And our souls inside
See the moon
She gon’  tell us what to do tonight
She gon’  tell us what to do tonight
