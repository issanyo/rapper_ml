BK, One Day
Check it out
Rapper Tag 37
Much love to Eso for the tag
I got a good feeling about this one, let's do it
Yo, check it

[Verse]
Back once again
Ladies and gents we welcome you to rapper tag
Coming live from rap's natural habitat
I am of course talking New York city
Inviting all of y'all, come take a walk with me
Note your time and place as your tune to the
Cyber space cipher let 'em watch as it drops simultaneous
And yeah, I took too long but I gotta say man
Chill even rappers need a fucking holiday, so I
Hopped a plane flew a very long way
Cramped up in that seat, pushed onto LA
Hit the shops, cops ain't shit, got a quick shot with Rick Ross
And made a pit stop in the city of sin
Where the bright flashing lights hide the wickedest grins
And the dealers on the table all getting it in
So I made a few bets, blew a stack of chips on the roulette
And learnt quick that the house always wins
Drove on through the valley in the shadow of death
Sittin' in the back seat, stop, paused to reflect
A simple case of cause and effect
Led me on my path of parlay in the lions den
It's the cross continental, top secret confidential
Puffin' on blue diesel in the rental
And my sixteens a sweet presidential
Never hesitate to lace the instrumental
Yeah, and it sounds so beautiful
Like I wrote you a post card musical
The sights and sounds so unusual
Moving through space and time
Body jet lagged from crossing the date line
So I'm feeling blessed to be alive in amazing times
I can cross the globe in a single plane ride
Send a message back to my peeps on the mainline
"It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to"
Now quick, before I forget to
I guess I better pass it off onto the next dude
Sup to Jimmy, I wish you could've come mate
I smile wide as I think back on watching wild star
Dreaming about the New York subway
I know we'll make it back here together brother, one day
Shouts to all those who raising the bar
There's too many to name but they know who they are
I'ma let Seth Sentry come and spit in ya ear
Say peace rapper tag, yo, I wish you were here
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
Kid Solo coming live, rapper tag y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
And if you still tuned in I'd like to thank y'all
Peace

[Spoken]
Much love
SYD, NYC
Kid Solo, Horrowshow
One Dayers in the place
And if you missed it
I'm wondering where he's been so, uh
I hit him up, let's find out
Seth Sentry you're up next, peace
It's like that
