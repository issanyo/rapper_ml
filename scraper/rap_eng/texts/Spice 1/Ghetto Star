[Hook]
Shameless stuff for you to see
What your life could truly be
And if you're really from the streets
Spit that ghetto poetry
Cause you're a shining star
Cause you're a shining star
No matter who you are
No matter who you are
And never fail to see
Never fail to see
The real G-A-M-E

[Verse 1]
Back in the day I used to smoke a blunt and pray before I got on the stage
And I was opening up for N.W.A
And I remember how it all began
I used to steal cars from Haywood, take them back to East Oakland
Till Short Dawg picked me up from high school
I was just a little nigga with heart,and uncle Short was hella cool
Took me to the studio, I met the homie Richie Rich
And all the way there people waved with their Caddy and screamed biatch
That moment was frozen in time
And I got memories like that embedded deep in my mind
Cause that's when something clicked in my head and said this is you
The whips, money lifestyle, women, it's all true
I went to sleep that night and dreamt I was a rap star
Woke up and wrote 187 Proof and started going hard
But the haters was hating, on the level of the devil
Then the riots kicked in and I gave you "Welcome to the Ghetto"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It was me, Scarface and Eiht on the cover of Source Mag
In the blue '64 Chevy Impala rag
And Menace II Society was the movie to watch
I just did the soundtrack, smoking big with the homie Pac
I did Triggas Gots No Heart in 18 straight up minutes
UGK, Big Poppa, full of stones and we was in it
From the Bay to LA back to Houston with DJ Screw
Cause Pimp C and Bun B was on the tour with us too (UGK)
I've been around too many legends to fail
I've either been shot up, stabbed or thrown in jail
But through the flames and the fire I emerged through the ashes
And shaped the game like it was made out of clay [?]
Bossalini, Fetti Chico, Soprano, Montana, Meier
Spice 1, I come from the Bay and I spit fire
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
I wanna say I shooked the world like Muhammad Ali

[Hook]

[Outro]
C'mon... ha ha ha
This how the shit went down you know?
I remember me and 'Pac smashed through the hood
You know what I'm sayin'?
[?]
You know what I'm sayin'?
We were two young buyin' alcohol man
