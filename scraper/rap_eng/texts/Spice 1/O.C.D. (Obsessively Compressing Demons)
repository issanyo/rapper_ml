[Verse 1: K-Rino]
Lot of pain, lot of hate, lot of malice, in it with my internal dilemmas see the challenge
My psychological status is feeling off of balance, steady try to be getting them benefits from my talent
Questions, no answers, thoughts, I didn't plan this, still standing back, never paint it on the canvas
The picture travelling through my mental and running rapid, praying my plan answers the city of second chances
I'm going through the process, still I'm undecided, nobody to fire with so I keep it private
Standing here held hostage, scared to take on my classes, let me read a list of what I'm dissatisfied with
Pandering gods oblige, told in the righteous, me struggling just to get control of my vices
I'm hoping to get ahold and show that a crysis and the peace embedded in my soul will be priceless
Every time I see a new baby I say "would he be the answer to my prayers when I pray"
Destroying the Devil whenever he's on a tirade, prays to Allah, Jeovah, God or Jaweh
A lot of words that I shouldn't really say, but I'm a product of the fiends that were put in my head
Over the years, even I got [?] and misled, but still I never sold out when I was looking for bread
Now in that knowledge, kinda hard to laugh and smile, I'll be griped that I never have my parents a grandchild
Am I worthy of being treated like hollow man how, when I [?] a young dude I understand now
Time don't stand still, dealing with your troubles it can get so real, I'm pushing cause I never wanna miss no meal
You can't run away from getting your medicine you gotta take your pill

[Verse 2: JL]
Fight this until I'm lifeless, prayed about it still I'm like this, mighty naughty mon, non righteous struggling to find God's likeness
Regolating my endorphins in the morning, uncoordinated forces not conforming, shortly my brain is where that was and orchestrating how the thing is being performed
Is it cause I've been never getting by negative, maybe it's cause my behaviour is too repetitive, it could be insanity inherited from a
Relative, maybe the lane I'm in in the game is too competitive
But I'm firm I gotta hold you, it's what you've been devoted to, you're feeling like it's over, do you realize?
When you're trying to leave a notice you ain't grinding all you noted, all the time is uncontrollable, feel I
Try this, try that, say my wig I'm Monroe, hiatus, climax, what I did in the lore to hide this combat, conflict I'm currently in, for all of my friends
I'll be ready for what creeps on the land and the evil that lurk, rock the ghetto kill a dream and a plan, hurt locked I live it nigga you
Ain't got a chance if you are not a rebel, I throw hands to the Devil to workshop to peddle on the block, pulling all kind of strings, distracted by all kind of things
Too many on the wrong kind of scenes,we decieved, be the reason that we don't call it [?]
Go and get a leader in handy be [?], plenty repeat in reverse, spending every penny, you fiending off this remedy it works, give me a
Handle to handle what is within me, my enemies have replenished the energies I exert

[Verse 3: King ISO]
I try hard to suppress these demons, but deep inside of me feel like [i must keep?] breathing, a deadly reason
For me to keep falling inside of a pattern and do like on every weekend, my Tec keep squeezing
Looking out the window every couple seconds for me just to check these streets and I'm starving, kick a nigga like Jack Lee Evans
My pet peeve's beefing in late [?] season, but let's keep eating cause I don't wanna hear another pussy talk all that shit queefing
And I don't even know a name but imma do it all, remaining Ocean Gang, wet you like a jet ski heaving
And best believe it, the best kept secret, I mean best kept like the mess we chiefing
Will knock a bitch out, no domestic reason, I pop so many bars, better check the [?]
I rep DG and they thought that I was dead, Doug said please check, nigga yes he's breathing
My hair be linging and I pray to the creator every other second I don't wanna bless these heathens
And every time a nigga leave the house I'm checking every nook and cranny looking at the last chest piece even
I'm bailing through the city, never catch me demons, you wanna have faith, better check e-[?]
They left me bleeding and it's all GG, I watch em dirty motherfuckers like they ODB
Niggas switching up on me because I'm on TV, ISO-Veli so dope you could OD me
Catch a fist through my bulb and your OG sneeze, leave him holey like swiss if he owe me cheese
Really sick in the brain if you don't believe, man I put it on my mama I got OCD, nigga

[Verse 4: Spice-1]
I be trying to be cool but they never wanna see me exorcising these demons
I got, extended clip with the 50 cal topped up with infrared beams and I got
A Devil that sit on my shoulder, an Angel that sit on the other
A foot up in the grave and the other one stuck in the street in the gutter
And Lord knows I'm not supposed to hold this heater, put a pointer right at his ovaries
OG smolder me, snitches die in the gang you know the story was told to me
That shit is cold to me, see I gotta fold em and no folding me, shit it ain't no holding me
I told myself nigga you tripping, you bout to dump on a motherfucker for ignorant shit again
You up in the pit again, tryna call up niggas who holding you down like crabs in the bucket
But fuck it imma blast, fuck it imma blast, fuck it imma blast, blast a way out, past the way out
Milli wrecking with the millimiter in your mouth, deep how we be rolling out, see what fetty chico be all about
We jumps in on niggas like fuck all your calves, spill this game on niggas clicking em out
Quick on em out, spill this game on niggas clicking em out
I be running with the top down tryna collect more haters so I can pop round
And you know I can never stop now, cause a corolla with everything up on a lock now
