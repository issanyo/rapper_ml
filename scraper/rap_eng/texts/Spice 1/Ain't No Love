(Chorus: Joya)
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love in this game
No, no, ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love
Ain't no love in this game

I used to hustle street corners back in 1986
Slangin Yayo by the dub, me and E-Bay in the mix
Only sixteen, slangin rocks on a sub, two 'o' clock in the mornin
We watchin under, see the coppers kept their creep on
But we was ready, didn't slip or slide or sleep on
The game was dare, you could be here today and gone tomorrow
Partner, see you gotta try to survive, the system failure, house of people
Money is the root to evil that we possess inside our arson minds
That's why so many of my homies dyin
Crack floods communities will we flex the green harsh look
In the face of what we call reality, dead partners and clips
Pictures and bullet shells on grave sites
Got me thinkin about my crazed life
What would I be, when I think that it's a shame
Cause my trigger gots no heart homie and ain't no love in this game

(Chorus: Joya)
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love in this game
No, no, ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love
Ain't no love in this game

I watched the po-po roll on and chase my partner
See, my homie's get stood on fool, by the coppers
See the, Herion addicts and fiends walkin the city streets
Not even wantin to care about what their children eat
But see it's a dog eat dog so be a hog
Young player maintain to keep ya brain, like it ain't fool
Gotta do what ya gotta do, roll with a crew if you got to
But keep your game true, cause see them haters out there bad
Talkin about they wanna jack a young player for all his cash
Better watch your back in '95 on the real
Them youngsters out there drugged on that high package steel
And can't nobody tell them nuthin about their life
Cause their daddy beat their mama and their mama on the pipe
When will the sticky situation change, like I told you before homie
There ain't no love in this game

(Chorus: Joya)
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love in this game
No, no, ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love
Ain't no love in this game

My homie mama almost died and had a stroke
When we told her that her little baby boy was left in smoke
We all shed in tears cause they did him cold
I know if he was here, we would all be smokin like a Roach stall
Light up the blunt and crack the top off of the 'Yac
But all the Chronic in the world can't bring my homie back
I'm missin all the times that we got drunk and fell out on the floor
Both at the back of a squad car straight cappin on the po-po
And that's a cryin shame, damn, there ain't no love in this game (*echoes*)

(Chrous w/ variations: Joya)
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love
I'm tellin you ain't no love in this game
No, no, it ain't no happy phase
You know that's right to say the place
Ain't no love in this game
It ain't no happy thing
You know there's pointin it to blame
Ain't no love in this game
It ain't no happy phase
You know that's right seed ain't the blame
Ain't no love in this game
It ain't no happy phase
You know that seed no ain't the blame
Ain't no love in this game, no...
