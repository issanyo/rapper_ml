(*Several coughs*) (*Inhales*)

(Intro)
Yeah, hahahaha, what's black and blue floating face down in a river huh, huh
Mark Furman tellin nigga jokes (oh shit, ain't about a bitch), yeah

(Spice 1)
I got your mama up in the trunk of my hooptie (let me out, let me out), what should I do with the bitch?
I think I want to dump her in a ditch, 'cause I'm a kidnapper
Body-snatcher, witness killer, special deliver, some murder to your door nigga
Open it up and you'll be staring right down the barrel of a Desert Eagle fo-fo
When I split your fo' it's time to bail, stick and move, dip and dive
And ain't no trace, just a bullet enlodged up in your fuckin face
I knew a nigga who always wore black
Said he was an O.G. player shot up some niggas with Macks
Said he had a little drama with some high powered killers
And the nigga that watched his back, he said he'd give me some scrilla
So he parlayed through the city, hittin party's and clubs
Until these so called O.G. motherfuckers finally showed up
These bastards opened up fire in the middle of the party
Blow to the floor and pulled my Mack and aimed for legs and bodies (oh shit, god damn)

(Chorus)
Kick to the tales of the niggas who got crept on
(punk ass motherfuckers)
(Nigga, fuck that nigga, straightly smoked)
Kick to the tales of the niggas who got crept on
Kick to the tales of the niggas who got crept on

(Spice 1)
I hit two niggas up in the ankle and one in the knee
Ain't nothin but the motherfuckin hog in me
So I bails to my caddy with the triple gold danas
Gun powder on my fingers and still got one up in the chamber
I told my nigga to bring his slow ass on
Cause if he's stabbin the motherfuckers, the other two won't be long
They comin, so hit the dirt and try to crawl to the ville and
These fools is some killers and I can see they really want this nigga
Musta fucked em out some paper or somethin sick
Whatever it is these niggas want to bury his dick
Got in the caddy and raised up out the drama scene
Looked like some gangsta shit you see up on the TV screen
But it ain't no cut, just action live, niggas die
Drug related killings reach an all time high
See real killers can be slept on
I'm kickin the tales of the niggas who got crept on

(Chorus)
(Shit), kick to the tales of the niggas who got crept on
(Go nigga, police lookin and shit nigga)
Kick to the tales of the niggas who got crept on
(Fuck you doing nigga, firin up a joint, motherfuckin...)
Kick to the tales of the niggas who got crept on
(Fuck is wrong with you?)

(Spice 1)
We chopped it up, my partner had some love
Fifty g's to creep on the niggas that tried to kill us up that fuckin club
Twenty five up front and twenty five up for the killin
For that kind of money I'll have they blood up on the fuckin ceiling
Now the slaughter is about to begin
Mini 14's, six homies and some motherfuckin Mack 10's
Infra-Red, silencer, I'll silence ya, cut off ya P-G-A and a Massacre
Everybody, cause can't no nigga diss me
Niggas you sent to the club, with some motherfuckin pussy (pussy)
I'm feelin, hit the hospital straight do they ass
I took em down to his basement and then I stabbed his ass
Screams jumpin the night, the nigga never heard I kill with a routin
Even got him for a couple of birds
So then I creep up into the I-C-U, I see you livin too long
Nigga you crept on, your life gone

(Spice 1)
Yeah nigga, got some shit just for you
Special motherfuckin can catch shit you on, uncut herion nigga
Straighten your motherfuckin Bays nigga
Yeah nigga, you like this shit huh nigga, suffer nigga
Suffer motherfucker, yeah, take a good dose of the shit, nigga
Yeah, yeah nigga you feelin it huh, can't breathe, what you can't breathe
Somethin wrong what, what, huh, huh, what, what, huh, huh, huh, what
Oh, thought you said somethin, hahahaha...
