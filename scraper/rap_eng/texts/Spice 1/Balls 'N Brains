[Verse 1]
Pullin' up a 500 with the 20-inch D's
A motherfucker better freeze
When he see me cockin' these
Two Glocks, bust off a few shots
Catch a motherfuckin' case like 2Pac
A real nigga gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Livin' in the city with the killers and thugs
And might be dealin' some drugs
A nigga either show love
Or bust slugs in mugs
Time tickin' on my Rolex
Niggas be watchin' me dippin' and trippin' if I'm heated
Cause I leave they ass deleted, erased
I seen the bitch in his face
When I was pullin' on the trigger
One less nigga
Enemies stallin', I be killin' em all
Cause I got the brains and balls
And I don't beckon for no bitches or no niggas at all
It's R.I.P. on the wall
I be the last nigga standin' tall

[Chorus]
Real niggas gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Suckers dream of schemes
A baller fiend for C.R.E.A.M
I weigh my motherfuckin life on a triple beam
Real niggas gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Suckers dream of schemes
A baller fiend for C.R.E.A.M
I weigh my motherfuckin life on a triple beam

[Verse 2]
Don't let your mouth write a check that your balls can't cash
Or put your Uzi where you mouth is, nigga, we on a mash
Ain't no rules to the game, motherfuckers run up and blast
Drive the car in a alley, throw the body up in the trash
If it wasn't for rappin' I'd be jackin' you motherfuckers
With the fully automatic, we killers, you can't touch us
Tell me how you gon' deal with the niggas that feed
When they're comin' from the city where the murderers bleed
Keep a strap on the side, a A.K., MAC-10
Watchin' all my enemies and all my friends
Rollin up on niggas with the Tec in a Benz
Might need checkin my ends, money and power'll win
And when the enemies see me, I'ma dip in the cut
Pull out my Uzi and tear his motherfuckin' ass up
Mob shit, dumpin' and jump in a drive-by bucket
Screamin' out 'fuck it'!

[Chorus]
Real niggas gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Suckers dream of schemes
A baller fiend for C.R.E.A.M
I weigh my motherfuckin life on a triple beam
Real niggas gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Suckers dream of schemes
A baller fiend for C.R.E.A.M
I weigh my motherfuckin life on a triple beam

[Verse 3]
When I'm dead throw a blunt in my casket if I didn't die high
My niggas go to war for me in G rides
Skip the killas, real niggas pack Uzis up in the pillows
Big figures, hope you feel us, we love them big wheels
Puttin' niggas in comas if he ain't dead from the blast
Get to hospital, stick a knife in his ass
Mob into the hooptie, put the foot to the gas
Forget wearin' a mask and stick and move real fast
Got the morgue on my pager
Niggas be talkin' 'bout killin' me while I'm sleepin' in my bed alone
And when I'm headin' home they wanna follow me on
Until I tap em with the strap and get to bustin' the chrome
It's bullet holes in my hooptie
Some motherfuckers rollin round wanna shoot me
It's all bad, live a life on the razor with "All Eyez On Me"
These niggas be talkin', but they be so phoney

[Chorus]
Real niggas gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Suckers dream of schemes
A baller fiend for C.R.E.A.M
I weigh my motherfuckin life on a triple beam
Real niggas gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Suckers dream of schemes
A baller fiend for C.R.E.A.M
I weigh my motherfuckin life on a triple beam
