[Chorus]
Ride around this mothafucka wid a full clip (full clip)
When the other day ago one a ma lil partnas got hit (got hit)
I’m in d hood gettin paper, nigga fuck a bitch (fuck a bitch)
An ain’t none a you niggas gon’ do shit
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Nigga what’s happenin wid it, 6 are you clappin wid it
Got dat double action wid it, time for some action wid it
Mouthpiece I’m knockin wid it, Celly Cel in dis bitch
Gettin articulate an focus on gettin rich
All on a bitch, turn em into actresses
In an outta motels, nuttin on matresses
Drinkin an tippin, he trickin em off of tha rent money
He say he hit em but baby that’s only tip money
I be laughin dis up because they gangless
Most a dese niggas brainless, hit em up wid d stainless
Cookin, like black angus I can make you famous
Hug his mama while she makes his funeral arrangements
Smash off wid a bitch named Brandy
First name cogniac I’m talkin bout landi
I’m on some otha shit these fools playin catch up
I’m talkin over their heads, and check em from tha neck up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Rough tickets, that’s what they sellin, they say that he tellin
Ain’t no tellin that’s what Jack told Helen
I heard they let him outta jail with no bellin
Six times hellin, get on da smellin
(We bounced out wit)
Bounced wit d drum, di-di-dum-drum drum!
Shot him in his tongue wit da huntin gun!
Blow-bap-bap-ba-budu-budu-bim!
Bow-bap-bap-ba-du-du-du!
(ugh!)
They discontinued him, he’s no longer (he’s no longer)
No longer on da menu he’s a goner (he’s a goner)
They be tryna to celebrate like New Year’s Eve two thousand twelve
I get rid a tha monster an cut off his tail
(ugh!)
I played da game for what it’s worth (what it’s worth)
You plan a hit on me, it’s gon’ get reversed (get reversed)
So keep their eyes on their guys, your ears to distrust
Some people will bury themselves alive to prove that they know how to use a shovel

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Bi-di-beng-beng-beng
Not one of a you niggas gon’ do shit
I’m in da new whip creamed up like cool whip
Wid 2 clips fo’ d niggas wid da new slips
I got ma ruffles on point more than a few chips
Nightmare to da hataz but i’m a hustler’s dream
An not a lad not a nigga wanna fuck wid dis infrared being
The other day ago one a ma lil partnas got hit
And d nigga who did it runnin aroun here poppin big shit
Drup, Jack and Sandy gave ma dude d business
But when I catch d boy in traffic, the jackets gon’ be relentless
All over him wit dis eagle dat I got from da desert
Huntin for him like Jack Sparrow be huntin for treasure
Measurin ma life on a triple beam, keepin ma pay an weight up
You send some niggas at me I eat em an scrape d plate up
I walk around dis mothafucka wid a full clip
Cause zoon tight nigga allergic to da bullshit

[Chorus]
