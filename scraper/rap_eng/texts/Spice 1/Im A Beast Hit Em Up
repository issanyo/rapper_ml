[Intro]
Alright
First Biggie died, Pac died
You know what I'm sayin', everything was cool, laid back
Now we got this fuckboy Flex!
So we gon' do it like this:

[Verse 1]
Put 'em up on the scoop
It's Mr. Bossalini the rider
Got a Desert Eagle with slugs gotta get deep inside ya
First off, fuck boyflex and his fake-ass name
Talkin' dead on my dead homie, the game is on fame
Fuck fuckboy Flex and the Flex [?]
And the next nigga that flex be next to [?]
Decapacitate the motherfuckers, leave 'em broke down, a bleeding
For talkin' shit about a real nigga that's not longer breathin'
Old coward-ass lame-ass game-less nigga
I'm a piece 'till I die ([?] nigga!)
It's two real-ass niggas dead over the type of shit
That you tryna get started, fuck nigga
You look retarded on YouTube cryin'
Shit, I wish I was there to slap you
Right when the ten drop I woulda nap you
Night-night nigga (blaw!)
You [?] box
Shoot yourself in the foot
You fucked around with the Mob
Still West Side, nigga, but still love the East
But these bitch-ass niggas like you to bring out the beast
Peace, nigga
