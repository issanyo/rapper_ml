[Chorus]
Here they come of a pound of Bud
Swisher sweet, Hennessy, it sounds absurd
Knock niggas' noodles, I'm about to curve
Hold the Mack 10 and watch me pound their nervers
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly

[Verse One: Spice 1]
Fillin up out of the funk with a black and a black, two foes on lack
Never let a bitch fall off, my nigga better keep your ho on strap
Man I thought it was Halloween, it was so many tricks here treatin
So many candy ass niggas out here trickin off every weekend
And niggas be holdin them heats but shittin themselves before it get real
I be makin them out of believers when i put the brain on the steel
Niggas vanishing for real, dissapearing in the wind
Evaporating motherfuckers with .45 for fucking up (my in?)
Chimpanzee ass niggas tryn to fuck with a King Kong
Bannana clip will spill out and fill it in your ding dong
International, wear my bulletproof vest like it's a fashion show
Iceberg Slim, cold as a motherfuckin Alaskan tho
50-1-50, I can even show you the papers
Kill a nigga, have a real ghost ridin the scraper
50-1-50, I can even show you the papers
Kill a nigga, have a real ghost ridin the scraper

[Chorus]
Here they come of a pound of Bud
Swisher sweet, Hennessy, it sounds absurd
Knock niggas' noodles, I'm about to curve
Hold the Mack 10 and watch me pound their nervers
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly

[Verse Two: Twisted Insane]
Knock em with the .45, hit them with R You can
Niggas run up and get fucked up
But you can do all you can
Try to do to save your friend
But he gon die in the end
When i'm off that juice and gin
? just begin
Could'a been that swisher sweet that's still with the weed, no oxygen
And heard that motherfucka go up on the road ? them blocks again
Trick it up ??
And hoverin over motherfuckers like I was Chris Angel off a fifth of hen
Excuse but is it a bit too much to eat niggas up like a double stuff
Hover your cookies and please don't push me, I jump on niggas like double dutch
Niggas can wolf about such and such, I am for the nuts and Shoot For The Face
I'm ??? and I run up niggas up if you chosin to race
Hit them with venom and
You claimin you tough but you sweater than cinnamon
I'm off of that gin again
And I'll iron your face if you wrinkle my ?
I'm a nigga that's sicker than
Motherfuckers that think they're wicker than psycho
And murded anybody in the middle of the night when I'm lookin on niggas like Michael

[Chorus]
Here they come of a pound of Bud
Swisher sweet, Hennessy, it sounds absurd
Knock niggas' noodles, I'm about to curve
Hold the Mack 10 and watch me pound their nervers
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
If niggas go run up we go Machine Gun Kelly
