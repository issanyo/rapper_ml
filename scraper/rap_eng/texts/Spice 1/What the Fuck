(Noreaga)
Yo, yo, I'mma killer nigga, and a gangsta too
Murderous motherfucker that'll fuck your boo

Me and Spice 1 just applyin' the shit from the bay area
To the East Coast shit, +Trigga Gots No Heart+
And we say that shit, yo, you ain't know?
Aiyyo, now you know, from Oakland, now down to Sacramento
To my niggas gettin' signed now with no demo
They be proud of the game, speak loud of the game
All y'all niggas ain't got no, love for the game, aiyyo I did my shit
Yo I mastered my shit, platinum role, now yo I smoke an O
Me and Spice Weezy, no dizzy, one treezy, wall graffiti
What, what? Spice 1 motherfucker, The Black Bossalini

(Noreaga)
Now you know, from Oaktown now down to Sacramento (Sacramento)
Better than Iraq (Iraq), niggas just play a demo (demo)
It's all good nigga, it's all good nigga, it's all good nigga
Aiyyo, now you know (now you know), from Oaktown now down to Sacramento
(That's Oaktown and Sacramento)
Better than Iraq, where we just play our demo (play our demo)
It's all gangsta nigga, it's all gangsta nigga, it's all gangsta nigga

(Spice 1)
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
Stick an Uzi at this nigga gettin' lighten shit up
Immortalized, thug niggas realise gravediggaz
From New York to California bring all my figures
Put it down like G's, turn to part of the cheese
Money-hungry motherfuckers with the thug disease
Nigga please we bomb pimps, players for sheets
Ridin' on enemies, make sure them motherfuckers bleed
Hit the weed, get the cash, money and bitches
Bendin' double make it to Diamond Lexus and saggy bitches
Two-hundred miles an hour, pushin' bodies out the car
We disintergrate niggas, give a fuck who you are
Keep my soldiers on the payroll money and power
Not too many real killers to be fuckin' with cowards
Keep it craculatin, for sheesty with Noreaga
True life players, kidnap 'em and make 'em pay us

(Chorus: Noreaga & Spice 1 - w/variations)
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what, what, what the fuck!
What, what, what, what...
