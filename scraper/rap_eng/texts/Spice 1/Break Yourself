[Intro: MC Ant]
Ayo Spice all these rich motherfuckers keep going to the record stores buyin' these fake ass raps. You know what I'm saying?

[Spice 1]
Yeah, yeah
I hear you 'bout all that fake shit
Niggas need to get up on the hardcore shit
You know what I'm saying?

[MC Ant]
Ay man, you still got them ski masks and them gats
I'm ready to jack these motherfuckers
I'll make them break theyselves and shit

[Spice 1]
Yeah, fuck that. Let's handle that business. Huh, yeah
We gotta flow somethin' funky. Check it

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
Spice 1 is fuckin' it up upon the flow
And if you got the static motherfucker we can go
My homie Ant Banks got the bass line thumpin'
Stop a nigga heart 'cause by my music they thumpin'
Spice is on the one and Ant is on the two
But y'all don't kick it yet because a nigga just ain't through
Comin' hard as fuck I be like acin' and I'm icin'
Steppin' into the ring, fuckin' 'em up like Michael Tyson
Gimme all your cash 'cause I'm about to blast
And bust 50 bullets in your motherfuckin' ass
Niggas think I'm crazy 'cause I'm poppin' off at the mouth
And plus I had the chopper pointed at your damned house
My name's Spice 1, I be a vicious motherfucker
Get you for a key and leave you lyin' in the gutter
And if you think it's possible to harm 'im
I be stickin' my foot up in your ass like it was Charmin
So nigga break yourself and buy the motherfuckin' tape
The beat'll fuck your ears like a statuatory rape
Murderous nigga on the gangsta tip
So MC Ant cover me while I reload the motherfuckin clip
And by the way, if you want your life don't take yourself
Buy the dope ass record and break yourself

[Interlude: Spice 1]
Huh, yeah
You know what I'm saying?
Got MC Ant in the motherfuckin' house
He came to break these motherfuckers
Load the clip and handle your business partner

[Verse 2: MC Ant]
A-N-T is like a motherfuckin' pro with it
Niggas didn't know that I get funky and flow with it
Straight up out the O-A-K-L-A-N-D
Coolin' all the bitches when I be on the late night tweak
Who's up at the corner?
Be stoppin' and starin' to makin' 'em stutter
Was that MC Ant the rip-a-rappin' motherfucker
187 with the 211 and progress
So get out the shit break bitch because I'll just
Pistol whip your ass and slam the tape
I pop if you want a brake and dump you off in the lake
Run you dumb dick, I'm quick to pop the clip
Slip if you wanna slip, I'm tough and won't even trip
Don't move and you won't get hurt
Take off your motherfuckin clothes and put your face in the dirt
This is a genuine gank move bitch
So give me your money and your jewels and make me rich
Another nigga might play it on a cool tip
But Ant and Spice won't be takin' no bullshit
Everything nigga, even your gold tooth
I knock the motherfucker loose if you want proof
'Cause I'm down for the mail
And if it's worth the jail I'm out on bail
If it ain't given I'll straight up take your wealth
Tell a motherfucker straight up break yourself

[Interlude: MC Ant]
Yeah and that's how we runnin' shit on this motherfuckin' stage right now. You know what I'm saying?
Ay, Spice, I want you to step to 'em and kick it one more time with that gangsta shit
Check it

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
It's like a G-O, and I kick in a bank in a motherfucker
So stop at the red light and I just point it up at another
Rich-ass nigga on a ego tip
Give up the Rolex watch while I'm [?]
And have ya both in the back of a black hearse
Bitch if you want your life give me your fuckin' purse
This is a Halloween â€’ trick or treat
But if you trick you get beat, shut up, left dead in the street
'Cause 187 is runnin' shit up in the house
Down to shoot you in your motherfuckin' mouth
And MC Ant of O-A-K-L-A-N-D
Is with the faculty and S-P-I-C-E
So put the goodies inside the bag
This ain't a lolly gag, stick in my clip and raise him up out his Jag
I let the motherfuckin' 9 click
Comin' at our dome, kickin' funky gangsta shit
So nigga empty your pocket, pull out your bank roll
Try to be a hero and [?] your asshole
'Cause Arnold Schwarzenegger just play parts
But I specialize in stoppin' niggas' hearts
187's sendin' niggas to ghetto heaven
We beat the funk out your eardrums and keep it revvin'
So don't pound too hard and fuck up your health
And by the way drop the Abraham Lincolns and break yourself

[Outro: Spice 1 & MC Ant]
Yeah, motherfucker you wanna spent that money on that bass hip. Won't you get the bomb baby?
Yeah, nigga brake yourself and get with the real shit
Yeah, nigga, MC Ant and Spice in the house
With Ant Banks on the tracks
Yeah, Ant Banks in the motherfuckin' house
187 motherfucker
Goin' out to all you motherfuckers
We got the dope shit
Bustin' caps in your motherfuckin' eardrums
Straight jackin' it
I'm out
