Rage, there's no room...

[Spice 1]
If four try to jack I'ma blast three
Run the fourth nigga over with the caddy
Had he not known about the Mac Daddy
Slug happy that's born to die
Ask why
You niggas be out there thinkin you can't ever be touched on
Close your eyes and click your Filas and I'm gon' send you home
On a one-way mission to CP Bannon
My cannon is made for killin
Nigga caught up in this mob shit and this drug dealin
I'm tellin my momma don't want to be no statistic
But realistically I've got my enemies scared shitless
All of my homies is killas
Surrounded daily by the real niggas
With finger-trigs you dig? We big
Nigga duck if you want to live
Cause it ain't no name on them bullets
Murderers be dishin
You wishin you never got caught up in my gunplay
You shoulda listened
Now it's too late ain't no turnin back
Nigga you done started this
I told you once before my trigger gots no heart at this
Now shall I proceed to blow your head up off your spinal cord
Cause niggas that fuck around with my click is known to come up short

[Chorus]
Them come up short in the ghetto them die where them lay
This is how we live and die up in the Bay

[Spice 1]
Realer than real niggas down for the killin
And ain't no remorse for you suckas
Ruckus is caused when the chrome is exposed
To you niggas, leaving your body froze
Your flesh is freezin you wheezin
Paramedics can't stop the bleedin
You seein your life before your eyes
You hate you leavin
Shoulda thought before you pulled the trigger
Thats the bitch in you
Recognize realize that all our trigger fingers itchy too
See we on some old mob shit
Everybody guilty of somethin
That's why when one dumpin, we all pumpin
Tryin to kill us somethin
Vacate the facilities when we bailin up in yo' shit
Cause the pistol grips
Make bigger holes then them fuckin hollow tips
You fuckin with a soldier
Ain't nobody told ya
You funkin with niggas that's known for killin niggas
Over and over this is my gunplay

Cops ain't nothin but the Klan undercover
Cops ain't nothin but the Klan undercover

Rage, there's no room...
