[Havoc the Mouthpiece]
Yo Russell Simmons
This is your commander in chief of your West Coast operations
Havoc the Mouthpiece
My orders are to assemble a team
Of 6 of the West Coast's dopest rappers
I have chosen Prodigy, Havoc the Rhyme Son, Spice motherfuckin 1
2Pac, Eiht from Compton's Most Wanted, and Ice-T
So let the gangsta team begin

[Havikk the Rhime Son]
Gnaw on a dick motherfucker cuz I'm a rip a gangsta skit
And blow your motherfuckin ass into anincrement
I rip 'em vertical diagonal I mean fucked up
Show that ass and I'm a physically tear it up
Another G witha Glock givin a fuck about a cop
I do my talkin with a 12-gauge buckshot
Like Spice 1 I'm just a giggity-giggity gangsta
And keepin a motherfuckin slug up in the chamber
+I Don't Give a Fuck+ like 2Pac
I get a fuckin thrill when I see a cop drop
Squeeze yo motherfuckin neck and snatch your head off your shoulders
Peel ya cap read your brain like the devil boy I told ya
Make a move for your gat and I'ma split your fuckin back
6 ways with a mack Havoc's in a mood to put a dick in the dirt
Jeffrey Dahmer gets no love cuz I'm the murder 1 expert
You couldn't deal with the real shit so you got ass whipped
Fuckin with a lunatic bitch West Coast on a wreck
So motherfuck the mainstream you tuned in to the gangsta team

[Prodeje]
I broke it down for the gangsta flex
Snappin necks as I wreck from the gangsta teks
You gets no love you get a 9 in your asshole
Droppin it in the back the fuckin niggas with a damn pole
And that nigga Prod he's a gangsta I know the game bro
And I could be a fuckin murderer the hot shells melt yo ass G
And the Tales From the Crypt grabs yo ass like a movie
You got fucked up nigga when you fucked up
The brain splat on the floor like some damn nuts
West Coast they hoo-ride on your ass if you fast
You will still get mortified members only motherfuck the phony
I give your ass the blues like Tony Toni Tone
Regulate in the 9-tre nigga this is payday
Comin from the mists with an A-K
O.G. stand no G. nigga from the S.C
With a Glock in my hood it don't stop til a nigga drop
I don't drop but I bust hot slugs from a drop top

[Havoc the Mouthpiece]
Yeah Rhyme Son and Prodeje
That's the way to show motherfuckers
How the gangsta team is runnin shit
Now it's time for the rest of you motherfuckin gangstas
To show 'em how we livin

[2Pac]
Now I'm losin it cuz my brother died
Lookin down the barrel of a 9 from the other side
Never really did read coppers from the episode
Finger on the motherfuckin tek ready to let it go boom
Now these devils really fear me
I told ya last year nigga holla if ya hear me
And one-time can't fuck with my 4-5
Do or die stay high til I motherfuckin die
Cop-killas killin cops much props you gets love
From the motherfuckin thug niggas on the block
Swingin hard as a motherfuckin barbell
Doin it for my niggas in the S.C. Cartel
Run up on me nigga and I'm blastin ya you
Can't fuck with the West Coast massacre

[Ice-T]
Check check microphone check who's next
The Cartel's in the house breakin fools necks
And I'm the motherfuckin cop killa
Now on y'all when I used to pimp them hoes they called me Ice Gorilla
Motherfucker it's on and you should've known
I don't give a fuck about ya from word say yo
I don't give a fuck about much no more
You might catch Ice robbin liquor stores
Before I stop checkin a bank packin a shank
Oeelin back busters to maintain my street rank
Down with the Cartel and 2Pac the pigs
Want a nigga with a scope on a rooftop
Punk motherfuck 'em they better duck 'em
When I'm out to kill I'm quick to buck buck 'em
Bailin with the Eiht from C.M.W. my nigga Spice 1
Is causin trouble too yeah so how you wanna fight
We can either straight scrap or bust caps all night
On and on I broke dawn and I'm on to stop to these G's
And we'll motherfuckin break you heart clean
You can't fuck with the gangsta team

[MC Eiht]
I goes one for my niggas bow here come the nigga
Fools get pushed to the street cuz I'm in too deep
I'm buckin 'em down as they fall I laugh
And I'm stealin babies fresh out the twat
So the gangsta's pow just call me the big black wolf
Snappin motherfuckers from the top of my roof
No need for help cuz Eiht'll do the hangin down
With the gang so let me start bangin niggas don't fuck around
