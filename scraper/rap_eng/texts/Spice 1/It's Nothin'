(Intro: Spice 1)
It's nothin', you're nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', you're nothin'

(Chorus: Spice 1)
It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player
To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin'
It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player
To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin'

(Spice 1)
It's nothin' when I'm runnin' with the heater
Sittin' on a twenty inch thangs
Mobbin' with the wood in the grain
Can't get in the game, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn
Hittin' them with the thumb and pinky ring
Touched down Lex with the platinum chain
Me and my niggas known for bringin' the pain
T-a-to the brain, it ain't nothin' to the boss mayn
F-a-flossin' with the sticky green
Time gets delayed with the gangsta lean
Up into the caddy when we ride for cream
H-a-hustlin' dream, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn
Runnin', runnin' whether you're smokin' the Glock
With the barrettes spinnin' around I'm hittin' them now
Goin' sick f-a-fish tailin', smooth sailin' now
It ain't nothin' to a boss mayn, bailin' now
I'm r-a-rollin' back to back to the trailer now
Inhale, exhale b-a-blowin' it out
S-a-shouldn't have choked off the endo smokin' my bong
P-a-peepin' on the haters cause they scopin' me out
It ain't nothin' to me, even when I'm ridin' on my enemies
Run with a lil' hennessey, weed and be
You'll be keen to see, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn
Play boy...

(Chorus: Spice 1)
It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player
To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin'
It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player
To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, to a thug, you're nothin'...

(Spice 1)
... to a player, to a boss, to a rider ain't no thang
L-a-live savish mayn for the cabs mayn, ain't your average mayn
Federallies wanna bust me mayn, handcuff me mayn
C-a-catch a player rollin' with a half thang
I keep ballin' mayn, cause it's all the same, ain't nothin' to a boss mayn
Play boy it's nothin'
To a boss when I'm c-a-callin' shots and makin' boss moves
M-a-make a million mayn see the really pain
It ain't nothin' to a boss mayn, feel the pain
R-a-real thugs lovin' the boss, suckin' 'em all, muggin' it all
Watch out I'm chasin' with the real, r-a-rollin' on
Sm-a-smokin' cough, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn
Trigger fingers with the big gats on 'em it ain't no stoppin' me now
Smokin' the pound and never come down
Keep it crackin' while I'm rollin' now, skypager now
Smash off like speed racer now
It ain't nothin' to me, thinkin' 'bout it bein' servin' luxury
Even if I'm rollin' in a bucket see
I keep bustin' see, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn
Play boy

(Chorus: Spice 1)
It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player
To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin'
It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player
To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, to a thug, you're nothin'
