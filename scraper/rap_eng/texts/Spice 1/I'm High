Song: I'm High

Chorus: I'm high (repeat 6X)

S-P-I-C-E about to hit it and crawl
Pull up the vega make it fat nigga got the crush nasty for a playa
Purple Haze got me hittin the switches and rollin bats up
With some niggas who don't want to put the gats up
I'm high til I kick the bucket
Fuck it, throw some blunts on my coffin and I'll
Smoke it with the dead niggas
Light it up like the Fourth of July
Type of chronic make a dead nigga wake up high
I gets higher than giraffe pussy
And niggas know I got to smoke about half ounce, before I flow
It ain't no bammer in my zig-zag, or in my blunt
There ain't no weed in the studio, we on a hunt
To get the sticky ass green shit, shut em down
You can find a little chron' spot in every town
Nigga sell a twenty ten sacks up on the block
Break the doobies in the ashtray down to roll a chopper
I'm addicted to the THC, gettin fucked up
Leave your doobies around they gettin sucked up
Lungs like a motherfuckin vacuum cleaner
Mobbin on the 580 smokin out the Beamer
Just call me Dr. Bomb from the Bay
Hit ya in the chest with the chron like an A.K
Kick back lay back and throw them feet up
Sometimes I wanna roll, a whole fuckin tree up
I break it down, halves and O's
Smoking more than a broke down sixty-four
And ain't no nigga in the world that can outsmoke me
The muthafuckin chronic addict S-P-I-C-E
Bill Clinton hit the chronic and he didn't inhale
But I'm gonna cough a fuckin lung up for niggas in jail

Chorus 4X

Smokin pot before twelve, ain't no secret to my homies
Step the fuck in your face with the smell of chronic on me
It's the C-H-R-O-N-I-C
Havin withdrawals about a quarter to three
About to loc the fuck up cuz the Fed hit the weed zone
And niggas tryin to sell me backyard homegrown
I need the motherfuckin bomb break down the bail
Roll it up in a fat ass chocolate zail
Mr. Endo smoked em all
Which every nigga hit the joint, cough, gag and crawl
Suckin in weed smoke with my nose
Hit the joint ten seconds hold it in for twenty-four
It's puff puff pass
Nigga quit fuckin the weed or I'mma bank on your bitch ass

Chorus 8X
