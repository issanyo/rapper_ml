[ VERSE 1 ]
Smellin' stale fresh out the county jail
Coppers gave me hell in a cell
But now its Mo' Murder to make mail
They thought my heart was playin' life at a different pitch
But I stick to the script, dump a snitch in a ditch
It's '94 I can't be fuckin' around
Paranoia of a jack so I'm quick to draw down
The only way I gets my mail is to be offin' yo' ass
With a AK or a Uzi screamin'"give me your cash nigga"
So back to fuck on up
Cause can't nobody stop this nigga that's sellin a D that's raw and uncut
Fuckin' over fiends
Laughin' in their faces sellin' soap to niggas, could die any day
Niggas come short up on them jacks, G
Another homie eyes wide open dead in my backseat
We never thought that they would get him
My nigga fought like a soldier, he never knew that the bullet hit him
Thought to myself was cocaine with my homie's life
He picked the crime Do or Die now he pays the price
To look in struggle on his face with his gat in his hand
My nigga died with the face of a desperate man

[ Hook ] 2 X
So we can tear this face
We can tear this face
The face of a desperate man , Gyeah-man
Butabyebye butabyebyebang butabyebyebangbo
So we can tear his face when him smokin the endo

Check motherfuckin one check one two
I gotta gets my mail, that's what I gotta do
And don't nobody run up on me
Cause Franklin and Grant is my only motherfuckin' homie
I made a deal with the devil and sold my soul
Threw up off O.E. at fourteen-years old
Young hog ass nigga never ever soft
Got me a strap and learned not to shoot my balls off
And all the youngsters sneakin' pass the bottle
Because the Gs, pimps, and hustlers was the motherfuckin' role model
And every time we had a house party
It was just the chance for a nigga to see another nigga dead body
And nobody stayed around for sequels
Cause the nigga that was bustin' was spreadin' bullets 'round equal
Now they mobbin', I'm seein' sparks hearin' shots
Pistols pop, another motherfucker flop
On the asphalt, stuck by the fo'-fo'
Flatline, ambulance put him in the do'
Loud screams from his homies yellin' "I'mma smoke 'em!"
Feelin' bad cause his partner's own blood choked him
A touchin' scene, niggas screamin' in the rain
Looked in his homeboy's face, his homie said his name
Now he'll be lookin' for that nigga with the gat and
Ready for that red rum with the face of a desperate man

'94 is gettin' hostile nigga
I gotta watch my shit, mug on my face nigga, hound dog mean bitch
I'm muggin' every nigga that be walkin' by
Is it true can his hand be quicker than my eye?
I'm wonderin' if I gotta pull out my steel
Cause motherfuckers they can't feel me they won't look at me real
So fo' to the motherfuckin fo'
If I have to let 'em know not to play me like a ho
Cause I sticks to the G code
I unloads the clizip and ease on down the road
1 and 1 Spice only
I do my dirt all by my motherfuckin lonely (by myself nigga)
