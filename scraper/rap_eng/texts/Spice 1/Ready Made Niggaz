We're ready made niggas
All about our paper
We want that scrilla, scratch, paper, cheddar, cheese

(Spice 1)
It's bossalini, fetty chico, the nigga that'll split your phillie
And roll your ass up like a sack of coke and smoke ya
Fuck ya, never loved ya, know your ass for years and still smug you
I see you with your bitch on the streets, I'm still bustin ya
Buck-A-buck-A, blow off your dome and disappear
Have your wife waken up at the middle, didn't even know I was here
Stick-n-move, that's the code of a killer, thug nigga
Got us livin the lifes behind 45.s and pullin triggers
Chrome trucks and diamond links, hella bitches and hella drinks
Niggas flashin they player pieces, hollerin Crystal in a sec
Ain't no tennis shoe playa, roll with thugs
I'm corleonin' with them thuggstas, Crips and players and Bloods
It's goin' down

(Chorus)
We're ready made niggas on another page
All about our paper ain't a damn thing changed
We want that scrilla, scratch, cheddar, cheese
Still G's to the game it don't change

(Black C)
I got a bunch of jealous niggas, it ain't mad at me
They want to grab they niggas Nine and blast at me
You're livin on your own gun, nigga now how can that be?
That you're a bangin-ass nigga that can't even bring the heat
See I'm a own man, cock my own Nine, make my own cash
Drive my own car, by my old path, smoke my own grass
And it's like that while you bitch niggas is fakin
On the block sellin them dubs but at the club perpetrating
Like you's a big baller, we fuck with G's and thugs
O.G. shot caller, up in the pen with love
So fuck the bullshit, you niggas wanna pull dick up on a dick bitch
But love to pump your gums about who fuckin with black chris
That's why I keep my eyes open and stay focused
Cause I'm the nigga you love to hate plus I'm the dopest
Still tryin to cope with our trials and tribulations
While you bitch niggas hatin, my homies are paper chasin and it's on

(chorus)

(Que)
Got no love for the niggas that's don't understandin
I'm a real nigga, on the level of a made man, peep my steel loc'
I lace you with the (?)
I want my seven figure digits on my desk when I'm finished
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, I'm a killa cali thug nigga on the rise
It's suicide, do or die, catch me if you're ready to die
See the days where I make the mail to rest, make moves like playin chess
(?) leave you niggas in the dust
We're makin big moves, doin big things
I'm amused to niggas hate that shit, ain't gon never fuckin change
Niggas peep they foe when it's on and poppin
You can catch me in the end on the highway smobbin
We roll benzos, beamers and lexus
Have you niggas on another page stressin
Don't hate me, hate the game nigga
I'm all about my cheddar cheese, rollin with these real G's nigga

(chorus)

Scrilla, scratch, cheddar, cheese
