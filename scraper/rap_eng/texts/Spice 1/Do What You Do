You do what you do to me

I need to feel. So be prepared
I want to touch. Wanna taste of your sugar skin
So open up and let me in
Don't you know that I'm here to tease you
Let's do it right now

You do what you do to me
And give me love instinctively
Let's go all the way. Come on and make my day
Do what you do to me
The way that it's supposed to be
Live your fantasy. Love in ecstasy

I said take me like a man. I said take me as I am
I said take me by the hand. I said take me if you can
I said you can't turn away. I said you cannot defy
I said you can't be afraid. And you cannot deny

I long to feel your heartbeat race. I want to rise
Want to fall in your special place
So get it on, now face to face
Don't you know that I'm gonna thrill you
I want you right now

You do what you do to me
And give me love instinctively
Let's go all the way. Come on and make my day
Do what you do to me
The way that it's supposed to be
Live your fantasy. Love in ecstasy

I said take me like a man. I said take me as I am
I said take me by the hand. I said take me if you can
I said you can't turn away. I said you cannot defy
I said you can't be afraid. And you cannot deny
