(Spice 1)
Hit the freeway in a 850 goin about a hundred and forty, sporty
Niggas slowin down as if they know me
Owe me a Chronic session but I keep on mobbin' I got my own
Fiendin goin to the zone, rollin up I see a Vega loan
Watchin out for the po-po cause the gangsta braise alert the coppers
Smokin under them choppers O.G.'s see me and give me propers
They say whattup to the Easy Bay Gangsta each and every time
As I took my hat and light my Chronic up in the sunshine
I gets my mobb on just like all you other players
Lookin out for dead Presidents who want that green paper
Put out my doobie as I mobb up off the freeway
I'm goin side-a-ways, this way, that-a-way
I see my partners up in the alley fightin they pit bulls
High performance, old schools, with fat dulls
Catch me cussin at the cluckers on the street
Tryin to stop myself from pullin out my heat, I'm mobbin' today

(Chorus: Spice 1)
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo
Mobbin' today, hey
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo

Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo
Mobbin' today, hey
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo
Mobbin' today, hey

(Spice 1)
Po-po passin me up, lookin all inside my car
It's full of smoke, rollin down my window, they see me choke
And spit a loogie out on the street because I'm hella high
Rollin around, maddoggin with some Red Eye
Talkin slow and show them about which way to go
Just hittin corners, tryin to find myself a liquor store
Hustlers slangin on the stow-front tryin to make some ends
I'm gettin deals on blunts from the Iranians
They know my face cause I comin up at them every day
For some Hennessy and lemon squeeze a Alazay
Then I'm back on the streets drivin through the track
See fools fresh out the Penn, killers from way back
Hoppin out the hooptie chop it up with real ass O.G. homies
Jerk players only, cause ain't no time for fakes or phonies
Come catch a glimpse of a real player up in the Bay
Gotta get my pay okay, I'm mobbin' today

(Chorus: Spice 1)
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo
Mobbin' today, hey
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo
Mobbin' today, hey
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo
Mobbin' today, hey
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo
Mobbin' today, hey

(Interlude: Spice 1)
Yeah I've seen up out there player
Runnin with a five hundred knowhatI'msayin?
850, guard be, knowI'msayin, somethin proper
Somethin fly, say knowhatI'msayin?
Get your mobb on you know, youknowhatI'msayin?
Or you can sweat these busters with their mean muggin
Player hatin youknowI'msayin?
That's all they is, get your mobb on man
Cause I'm gonna get mine on youknowhatI'msayin?...
