(Forty Fonzarelli's answering machine)
Ay, what's really? You hit my locker number
This Sick Wid It/Jive Records
Leave a message at the beep *BEEP*

[Intro: E-40]
Hah! Mmm-hmm
Yeah, uhh, on my pager
What you say? Oh yeah
Kick that shit then, nigga!

[Verse 1]
[Keak da Sneak]
Higher than a bird, off that herb, in the O-A-K
Off on perv, parked on curb, rollin' up a vay
Licked it three times, laced it with the Alizé
About twomp a day, baby hit me frequent-lay!
Sneak, and Forty, from chocolate short-ay, we been
O.P.P.'n, 'cause my nature's no day, the broad say
I last, with you six months
But I say, she pullin' a gang of major stunts

[E-40]
Uh, bust niggas, consequences when you're doin' the do
Fuck around and get caught up in a catch twenty-two
In the area (Area), dirt and dust
Where the yay (Yay) be A-plus (A-plus)
But ain't yo' sista Suga-T? (Suga-T)
Ain't you the one that say Sprinkle Me? (Sprinkle Me)
I loves me some 40 Water
I seen you up in 2Pac's video poppin' your collar

[Spice 1]
I play this playa shit like Bugs Bunny (What's up, Doc?)
Ain't no cartoon figure, nigga, I makes money, ain't nuttin funny
If you're ever in some funk, call your potna on the slunder
And leave one-eighty-seven at the end of the number
B-uh-Benzell Washington on a cellular phone
You could tell that the Easy Bay was his home
My beeper goin' off like a high school bell
And all my money in stacks, and all my pockets on swell
M-uh-mobbin' like a playa, but I'm still a G doe
Pager goin' off like C-3PO
Time for the Hurricane, E said word
I put a nigga on his back (BLAOW!), fuck what you heard

[Chorus: Harm]
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone

[Verse 2]
[E-40]
I be so rebel-yalous
When I'm talkin' on my phone-telyalous
You can have my batch (Have my batch), but I maintain
I chop it up as a loss and charge it to the game
She said you must be playin' some kind of phone tag
'Cause every time I hit you, you don't hit me back
And why is dat? 'Cause you're hella hard to get in contact with
Thought you thought, was cookin', baby girl? What's crackin' on some crab?
Six o'clock, the girl said, "that's when my crevice be the wettest," plus
Dude be gone, left me home, be leavin' my ass up in the living room all alone
And I be starvin', rubbin' my monkey, fiendin' for some Donkey Kong
Now you're talkin', let's get the show on the road
I know you're tired of barkin', you need to hop on my load
So we can stab out, strike, rock and roll
Park at the top of hill so I can check your oil

[Harm]
I said ah one to the two ah two to two three
Tell me why your baby mama keep on pagin' me?
I didn't give the ho the number, so why does she call?
She says she wanna do me and all of y'all
But I'm like that nigga on The Mack
I don't want the honey, I want the money
Some of you niggas is funny style and meanwhile
I'm sellin' my piece to these tricks 'cause it's the paper chase
Laced with game, see I'm livin' in the hustler's dream
Call up a player if it's major
Especially if it's scrilla, nigga, hit me on my pager

[Chorus: Harm]
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone

[Verse 3]
[Keak da Sneak]
Rang it, baby gimme a call
My name you're screamin', how I be hittin' them walls
You got me tinglin', how you be workin' them jaws
With a kiss that make a score shady, nowadays raw
I lash and cut, dash, we up
Beat case with a blast headin' straight for the nut
B.A. and H got some breezies all in the cut
It's that season, drop my number, told the ho "hit me up"

[E-40]
Yo, yo, you're 9-1-1'ing me to death—what's all that for?
Got my Unisys bill and Pagenet pager on the overflow
What's happenin' with all that old bullshit?
Is it really all that damn serious?
You're draining the hell out of my battery
Got your partner thinkin' curious
'Cause in the Y-E-A A-R-E-A, the game ain't constipated
Fuckin' around in the Golden State where the game originated (Originated)
Fools be scandalicious, used-to-be-squares be turnin' vicious
Hit me on pager, hit me if it's major

[Chorus: Harm]
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone

[Outro: Harm]
Ooh, you better ring, ring, ring, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone
Ooh, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring
Ooh, you better ring my telephone
