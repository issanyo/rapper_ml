[Intro]

Yeah
We getting more mail than the rest of the pushers
With my nigga Spiggity Spice 1
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a tech nine in the bushes
We getting more mail than the rest of the pushers

[Verse 1:Spice 1]

For these Dough Boys shit I peals and burries motherfuckers
Doing wonders for this thread dodging all you fairy motherfuckers
In a clean ass 68 Camaro Rag Chevy
Inside peanut butter outside grape jelly
My desert eagle chrome like the rims of my sc-scraper
Keep an autograph bullet for each one of you motherfucking haters
Mr. Bossolini
To be played with
These niggas always tryna do some shit they won't get away with
I'm heated
Nigga hot as coal like Keisha
Put you in pocket and wrap your ass up like a [?]
Better believe that Bossolo and Mr. Bossolini live life in the fast lane smash likeLamborghini's blaw

[Hook:Bossolo]

More mail then the rest of the pushers
Still posted with a tech in the bushes
We Doe Boys from LA to the bay nigga
On this legendary shit getting straight figures

[Bridge]
For this Dough Boys shit I peals and burries motherfuckers
I'm still posted up in the bushes with the tech nine
Doing wonders for this thread dodging all you fairy motherfuckers
We ride nigga
We Dough Boys

[Verse:Bossolo]

I'm still posted up in the bushes with the tech nine
On this Dough Boy shit a nigga staying on the grind
That's out of the mind nigga never dropping a fucking dime
Drop to rolls when I ride staying on the grind
A lethal weapon with this nine and I'm blastin'
When bullets rang out got these soft fools dashin'
Suicidal insane with thoughts sicker than Curt Cobaine
Red dot to the dome nigga we got the pure Caine
Dipping and riding hommie watching out for Johnny Law
With more packages that you [?] that you ever saw
Hit the border nigga we got like spicy Cheetos
Whoever snitch get a ditch wrap them like burritos
We ride nigga we Dough Boys
We eliminators never decoys
Leave you leaking nigga slumped over face down
Hot spot gauge clocked
Nigga blaw
