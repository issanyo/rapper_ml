[Verse 1: Devin]
What's up, bitch? Come on in
And drank a little drank and smoke some weed with my friends
We all chillin’; we seldom have to Bogart cot
‘Cause every nigga’s got two bitches that'll go nonstop
So just kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Pass that 40 on ‘round while I roll a fat sweet
Yo, ya neat and ya clean but ya seem kinda dumb to be
Falling in love, thinkin’ I'm the one
Ya see, we travel all the time and run across plenty bitches
With they palms out for riches, won't even do the dishes
This is the season for catching the skrill
And if I fuck you down good, bitch, I bet you you will
Be calling and paging and writing asking where have I been
The same place, bitch, getting high with my friends
I got a fucked off schedule–I do every day
And if I call it will be too late, so...

[Chorus]
Don't wait
Don't wait
Don't wait
Don't wait

[Verse 2: Devin]
You say you wouldn't mind jumping up and down on my bone
But you got a man and you don't wanna do wrong
You say he don't give you, no money no space, no time
You walk around the house naked and he pay you no mind
But I'm not the nigga to step in his spot
But you can meet me at the sandwich shop on Bellfort and Scott
Clean your cot and I got a spot when we finish grubbin’
Be down for some pussy pettin’ and some titty rubbin’
I’ll be shoving this dick in ya, have ya feelin’ at ease
But don't get mad when I wash my dick in the sink and then leave
Because it beez like that sometimes
I might as well come straight to ya, ain't no need for me lying
I got a fucked off schedule—I do every day
You probably see me in the Park, Southwest or the Trey
But if I happen to call it’d probably be too late
You can keep your cot straight but don't wait

[Chorus]
Don't wait
Don't wait
Don't wait
Don't wait

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
I take a bitch to the hotel, to the motel, to the Holiday Inn
And if that bitch start actin’ up, I’ma kick her up outta my Benz
While it’s rollin’, pockets stay swollen, holdin’ money up in my face
Big ass dollars up on my pinky, fat ass Lexy up on my wrist
Kiss my gangsta, pimpin’, playin’, hustlin’, muthafuckin’ ass
You bitches gon’ retrospect somethin’, or I’ma have to put down the mash
Now which one of you hoes is ridin’ westward, goin’ bitch back to the Bay
I’m finna stop over here to my potna house so you can get to some of this yay
You hoes better watch yo’ coochies, better oil yourself around
Because every time I come to your town
It’s gonna be some old pimp shit goin’ down, bitch, so don’t wait

[Bridge: Devin]
I know you might get lonely
But don’t you wait up on me
I know you might get lonely
But don’t you wait up on me
Don’t wait

[Verse 4: DMG]
Damn, ooh wee, baby look good
I wonder if I could hit her wit’ the wood
Let me see—step up to her with E-A-Z-E
Say, what’s your name? Mine? DMG
Shit, I was peepin’ you out from backstage
Checkin’ out the way you swing your thang, ay
It’s an afterparty, Room 520
You, bring your potnas, y’all, get up wit’ it, fa sho
Here they come, nigga, Spice got the condoms at the do’
With Remy and Mo’, now here we go
Damn, clear out the room, turn the lights down a little
After we hit ‘em and quit ‘em, we through wit’ ‘em
Don’t wait

[Outro: Devin]
Just take this dick and be satisfied—don’t wait
Don’t wait
Don’t wait
Just take this dick and be satisfied—don’t wait
Don’t wait
