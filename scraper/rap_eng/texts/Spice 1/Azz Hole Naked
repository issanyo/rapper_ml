(Spice 1)
She was five eleven, six one with high heels
Tick-old biddy remind me of a catty's grill
Daddy's ill, slappin' that ass off pimp pills
And hit it on the flo' from the back where she still live
(It's Spiceberg Slim here), naked women, two thousand three Benzo
With all the trimmings, had my t-shirt and my boxers on
Hearin' "longest" I be given take a ride and side slip over the phones
Hittin' it for a minute, back up off it (back up off it)
Fuck it, get bucket naked so I can toss it
Ain't no two minute nigga, a few minute nigga
I'll take another shower, spend a few hours in her
Send her back feelin' like she got of her flight
Got her lookin' for me in the day time with a flashlight
My little soldiers on a mission hit the pole and position
And your naked body, got 'em standin' with bad intentionin'

Tell the canieces to dime pieces have you seen my collar?
I've done popped it off my shirt, I've been lookin' for hours
Screamin' yeah baby (yeah baby) like Austin Powers
Drinkin' Remy straight deepen the midget's puffin' on fire
Knew her nipples were pierced cause I could see it through it shirt
Peep up the thighs don't see there samethin' I can twirk
Watch her mommy shakin' (shakin') picture her baby gettin'
(Azz Hole Naked)
An't no use to me lyin' to kick it
Under dig it, I done peeped it from across the bar
Was hangin' with it and just smokin' with me, is that Remy or Hennessey?
I gotta gang of sticky green in my EXT
V.S.O.G., please believe that's me

Damn I got my jacket caught up in your peanut butter
Wrestlin' ass naked while we be under the covers
Let you pin me down, playin' around, pullin' your hair
Smokin' the air, clothes everywhere, holdin' the playa
Clap two times and the lights go out (clap) we pull closer (closer)
Up and down ridin' around like a rollercoaster
Most of the time you gon' get it just how you want
Got me hittin' it from the back, help from puff of the blunt
Parent though mommy, give it to me all that you got
Sticky green in the sess mail blow up the spot
Put it down cause I been up in the county for three months
You soft as cake baby, I'm hard as a tree stump
Please come your pretty ass to the edge of the bed
Lickin' your neck runnin' my fingers through the back of your head
See the real in me, got you feelin' freaky and crazy
Just me and you girl goin' halfs on the baby and gettin'

(Chorus: Spice 1)
