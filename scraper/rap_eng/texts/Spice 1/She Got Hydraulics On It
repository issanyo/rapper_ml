(Spice 1)
On the phone while I'm poppin' my collar
Drop that ass up and down like a six-fo' Impala
Make it c-clap mommie, make it go round and round
She got hydraulics and switches and make that ass clap a sound
Lift one leg up but a three-wheel motion
She hittin' switches with it, draggin' that ass to the flo'
Pumps and dumps in her trunk, she got sixteen switches
She stay crunked and her candy paint is delicious
She hittin' switches with it, tellin' me to come get it
Back that ass up mommie you know I wanna hit it
Because I whips the coochie never let the coochie whip me
Tap that ass like drum-line, quadriple O.G
Move that ass round and round and you makin' a thug want it
Booty round like my rims and I'm puttin' the spinners on it
Had a ring on her tongue and a ring on her belly (uh, yeah)
Big ol' titties look like headlights on my Chevy, blaow!

(Chorus: Spice 1)

Watch her go from side to side
Front, back, pancake and then she three-wheel glide
Wouldn't happen ??? three feet high
She hittin' switches on me, she need to let a O.G. drive
Hit some corners, you know how we bounce in Killafornia
You need to drop the top and let a thug put it on ya
Put the bouncin' up and down lookin' over your shoulder (shoulder)
See ya engine runnin' hot but you don't stop to pull over
She got hydraulics on her (on her) and I'm gonna give it sum gas (gas)
She can keep bouncin' up and down shakin' that ass
Hit the switches mommie, ass all in the air
All in her homie face and I know he don't care
She got hydraulics on her body frame grabbed from bouncin'
I give her applause because the ass clappin's outstandin'
She low to the flo' (She got hydraulics on it)
If you think she nympho (She got hydraulics on it)
If she ready to go (She got hydraulics on it)
If she ready for mo' (She got hydraulics on it)
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce), blaow

(Spice 1)
She got hydraulics on it, she hittin' switches with it
But can she do it like that when she got a thug in it
She got hydraulics on it, she hittin' switches with it
Bounce that ass up and down let a boss hit it
Three-wheel motion in this biatch (She got hydraulics)
Seven side up in this biatch (She got hydraulics)
Front to back up in this biatch (She got hydraulics)
She hittin' corners on me in this biatch
She got hydraulics on it, she hittin' switches with it
But can she do it like that when she got a thug in it
She got hydraulics on it, she hittin' switches with it
Bounce that ass up and down let a boss hit it
Three-wheel motion in this biatch (She got hydraulics)
Seven side up in this biatch (She got hydraulics)
Front to back up in this biatch (She got hydraulics)
She hittin' corners on me in this biatch
She go front, back, side to side
Front, back three-wheel GLIDE..
