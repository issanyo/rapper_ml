(Spice 1)
[Verse one] {:14}
Dear lord, could you please tell Lucifer
Turn the heat down, feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now, the block is hot
I hear the street demons callin
Playin russian roulette
With thug nature, sky fallin
Don't wanna die broke and alone, smokin a zone
With the homies in the car strapped up
With a vest on, lord please tell Lucifer
He need to turn the heat down
Cause I'm convinced that hell is up on these streets now
The hood is on fire, niggas comin up short (short)
Ashphalt burnin the sole of my jordans (jordans)
How long will I mourn my homies is gettin shot
Not even mommys tears cool the drama or not
Just gettin hotter, my homies can't take it anymore
Sick and tired of bein broke stressed and poor
Enemies, wanna murder me at 3000 degrees
Wanna catch me on my paper route scoutin for cheese
Turn the heat down

[Hook] {1:01}
Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer
Turn the heat down, I'm feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now, underneath my feet now
Underneath my feet now, feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now {repeat 1x}

(Outlawz...)
[Verse two] {1:22}
Its been a long ass road, for me and my dogs
Late nights is cold and day times is hard
And everyday is a test, and god must be the teacher
Hatin ass niggas, make me travel with my heater
And satan been waitin, on a nigga like me
Since the day I was born homie I knew it was on
Daddy gone, and now I'm left to raise myself
The devil playin games with me, got me lustin for wealth
So me and my homies went out to get it, no matter what
The lord I know it's wrong, but somebody gettin touched
And I can feel the flame, everyday I'm in the game
My homie died in vain, so now we ride in his name
Are we goan ball or die, put it all on the line
Get this money man, make 'em haters wanna shine
For makaveli, killer khadafi the prince
May the lord bless your soul nigga, till the very end

[Hook] {2:10}
Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer
Turn the heat down, I'm feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now, underneath my feet now
Underneath my feet now, feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now {repeat 1x}

[Verse three] {2:30}
Although you hate to be broke, even smoke with the folk
Made alot of money dropped alot on the floor
Did alot of shit I never done before
Fucked alot of hoes never paid they cardinal
Always blast first when it comes to this woe
Its in my bloodline plus my daddy done it before
You never seen hardtimes why you fakin it for
You never seen another nigga with his brains on the floor
I think it's all for me to figure why you hatin me for
But then again I'm one of them motherfuckers that do shit broke
And then again I'm one of them niggas that'll eat off the floor
And I got pool massive blood what you askin me for
And you don't need what you think you do
And you don't really wanna die but I huck you thru
Its gettin hotter on the streets tryin to kill who snitchin
And if you can't stand the heat then get the fuck out the kitchen
Its gettin hotter nigga (punk ass nigga, outlawz shit bitch)

[Hook] {3:18}
Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer
Turn the heat down, I'm feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now, underneath my feet now
Underneath my feet now, feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now {repeat 1x}

[Verse four] {3:39}
Livin life hot to death we stop the press
Stop to, catch my breath and count who left
You see this black rain pourin, they wanna see us prehistoric
You wanna see me in the county or the corener's
There's angels with me, so I can never give up
Makaveli trained soldier, just aim and bust
From my mental that is, with a pencil that is
Known got a old soul like he been to the bid
Lil' wayne wasn't lyin, the block is scorchin
What gotta kill a cop just to stop the torture
Watch the roads cause there really ain't nobody to trust
A outlaw till I die you better ride wit us
We stand firm in the flame watch the face to burn
I get a blast from the past when the pain return
Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer
Turn the heat down, I'm feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now

[Hook] {4:26}
Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer
Turn the heat down, I'm feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now, underneath my feet now
Underneath my feet now, feelin the flames of hell
Underneath my feet now {repeat 1x}
