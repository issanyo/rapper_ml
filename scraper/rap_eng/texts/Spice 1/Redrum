Celly Cel:
Murder one, motherfuckers call it redrum
Doin' niggas in and let them shells pile up
From dumpin on these niggas in my motherfuckin face
I breaks em off a taste of that Ciggety Cel and Spice..

Spice 1:

Gettin' it on like Marvin Gaye, I'll meet you by the motherfuckin dock of the
East Bay [blew]
Kill em off like this, ba-da-ba-ba-ba-bye
Them slugs couldn't spill me, them niggas shoulda killed me..
Now I wanna know who they are
When I put some slugs in them niggas kill em off in they car..

Celly Cel:

You see, they can't fuck around with niggas whos so quick to blast
So quick to put these slugs up in your ass
They be a hundred miles and runnin when they see me comin
Bringin more funk than the pussy on a yeast infected woman
So kick the flow
You see a nigga stompin with that 'H' on my back
Choppin these fools in half with my Mack

Spice 1:

Mass motherfuckin murder they ain't breathin'
That niggas wheezin
Hot slugs got him freezin'
Coughin and he's soundin like he got a cold
But hes chokin off that Redrum, whole fuckin body numb..

~Chorus~:
Redrum leave your body numb, blast dum-da-dum-dum
Retalliation is a must where im from..
Redrum leave your body numb blast dum-da-dum-dum
Drinkin Redrum cause I'm 187 proof....

Repeat Chorus

Spice 1

[Blaaaw]
Murder in the first and shit
Beat a nigga dead body with the pistol grip, playa..
Sp-Spice 1 often shoots, kickin knocked out niggas in the head with boots
I got my motha fuckin choppa, pop a cap, in your ass cause you can't stop a
Psychopathic motherfuckin nut
Snatch all your fuckin guts
Leave your ass in a ditch all opened up..
Kickin' the tales of the niggas who got crept on
Blow out his fuckin brains, cause i was slept on..

Celly Cel:

Now I'm posted with a chopper in my coat full of Hennesey
Fixin' to let my 40 spit out thirty-two when I see
These niggas that wanna test a playa swingin' from my nuts
Pull my mighty Mack and let the street sweeper sweep him up..
The only thing I leave behind is casings on the ground
Lookin for the snitches on the block so I can buck em down..
I gets my Clown with every round that I let fly
Trigger happy niggy in the hood, die nigga die
Funk for life, when they smoke me that's when I'm done
So take a sip of this Red motherfuckin' Rum....

~Chorus(2x)~

Celly Cel:

Call me the Undertaker, call me the casket closer
Fillin niggas up with lead like they fill Shwisher's up with doja
At the graveyard countin' the bodies I left in the mud
I break em off, ain't nothin but buckin' till they spittin blood
But niggas dont feel me
They wanna kill me but these fools dont know me
I rolls them like a blunt, fill em with slugs and bury them slowly
Infrared beam gleam, he's dead on the scene
Shot in the spleen
Got two in the chest he's off the scene
Its C-Celly Cel and Spice 1 sp-splittin wigs
Its murderin' so some of that Redrum come take a swig
[Blaaaw]

Spice 1:

These motherfuckin nuts if you wanna murder me
Harder to kill than your average motherfuckin 'G'
Put a cap up in that ass
Nigga with a gat thats quick to blast
Raisin up outta the funkwith a chrome four four and a black ski mask
Killin for the cash, mobbin' that ass
When so many of these gang buckshots shatter my glass
Mashed on the block and I kept on bustin'
Gotta let them know I'm not no Midnarc
Put it up in Piznark
And let my A.K. Biznark
Beitchh!
Killin off niggas in the diznark
You ever seen what a bullet can do to flesh
Just call me Messy Marvin, leaves a mess...

~Chorus(4x)~
