[Intro: Spice 1 & (2Pac)]
(Spice here's them niggas now yo
Hit that shit, hit that shit
Where ya'll niggas going now
Where the fuck ya'll going now)

Damn ain't this a bitch ya all got me fucked up
On this old playa hatin' ass shit
Know what I'm sayin'? Understand me?
When I was broke ya'll niggas didn't give a fuck
If I was pissin' on myself, or shittin' off the Bay Bridge, nigga
Now you in my muthafuckin' mix talkin' that old crazy shit
That's alright cause I'm gonna bust a cap in that ass
Me and Pac goin' to let you know about
That old playa hatin' ass shit though

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
Ya see these jealous motherfuckas they be playin' me G
Like a sucker ass nigga see
That ain't feeling me
It ain't easy to kill a G
A motherfuckin' player from tha F, A to the C
Back stabbers in the muthafuckin' place
Smilin' in my face
I got my hand on my gun
Cause they got me on the run
Spice motherfuckin' one
Known for leavin' bodies numb
I'm a G motherfucker, can't you see
I'm a G
Rollin' deep with my fat fo-fo Uzi
I comes with a big fat gat
And hollow point clip
And quick to be a soldier by my shit
So nigga don't try no mo' shit
No ho shit cause when I was broke
Nigga didn't give a fuck about my status
Now that I'm at this
I'm loc'd out and livin' lavish
So fuck the gun control
I'm about to bust a cap nigga

[Hook]
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Now niggas know that the jealous got me strapped
That's mean close to the edge
I got the cops and the feds, on my back
And there's no way that I'm giving up
I rather bury you bitches
Cause ain't no marks, finna worry my riches
If I catch your ass in traffic
You best to pull for your pistol and open fire or get blasted (boo yah)
Cuz I'll be damned if I, drop
It don't stop
I'm boxin' motherfuckers with my Glock
A skinny ass never had a penny ass nigga
I figure, my Mossberg pump will show them punks who's bigger (blah)
And even if I did fall, I'll still ball
I'm bustin' motherfuckers with my back against the wall
'til these jealous ass bitches kill me
I'll be thuggin' like a motherfucker, nigga feel me
And ain't no time for mistakes
So homies watch ya back
Cause these jealous ass tricks got me strapped

[Hook]
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
Homie ya know if I don't be runnin' with my strap
Then I might get blasted
Get blasted or blast
That's how I'm livin'
So I blast and blast the bastard
I can't be worried about no jail time
Cause niggas they tryin' to take my head
I can't have shit if a nigga dead
So I bust back and break the bitch nigga off proper
With a four-four take nine a chopper
And try and decapitate a niggas arms from his shoulders
These jealous niggas don't know they fuckin' around with a soldier
I don't be slippin'
So nigga don't wait for me ta fall
And if I got enough hallow tip will smoke 'em all, y'all
Envious niggas prepare to fly off ya feet
Cause I'm comin' with some muthafuckin' heat
Playa, so keep ya aim straight and hit a nigga on tha first shot
Cause I'm a be tryin' to make your muthafuckin' heart stop
And don't be screamin' out for your family bitch
Cause it was your choice that we jump into this gangsta shit

[Hook]
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
Jealous got me strapped
(I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run)
