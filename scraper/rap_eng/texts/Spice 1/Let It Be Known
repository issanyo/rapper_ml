[Intro: Ant Banks]
Ah yeah... you know what I'm sayin'?
Ant Banks in the house kickin' it with the boy Spice 1
Comin' at your dome, hey Spice let it be known, nigga

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
Spice 1 with the 31 flavors
I be takin' my time so the suckers catch my vapors
On the dope track, rollin' like a MAC-10
I'm a fool when I'm fuckin' with a fifth a gin
Fly into the ass of a beat like a buckshot
So damn dope I could be sold up on a drug spot
This is a section of my many styles
But my direction is to take MCs for many miles
So, Peter Piper packed a perfect pickle peter
Well, I pack a muthafuckin' milimeter
Where? In my trunk with the bump and the funk slam
Another brother like me sayin' god damn
Fact one: I'm insane to my fuckin' brain
Open up my mind and blast like it's a hurricane
You're in front of a firin' squad
And my job is just to let it be known
Let it be known

[Verse 2: Spice 1]
Rolling up past a junkie in my Delta '88
With two A's in my lap, and my aim is kind of straight
Lots of static up in my rhyme, bitches clingin' up to my noun
Gettin' dope like a kilo or an ounce or a pound
Bitin' up on my rhymes tell me how much you can chew up
Niggas up in the rearview with his brains col' blew up
I am not the one, not the two or the three'a
I be what is known as S-P-I-C-E
Let it be known, yeah
Let it be known

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
Dope, how muthafuckin' funky can a nigga get
Comin' with the shit ya can't fuck with
After a murda I'ma step and then I couldn't see ya
Lockin' him up inside my mind like in Santa Rita
187 muthafucka
Kickin' that funky shit ya just can't get enough of
Spice, the nigga that's icy like a popsickle
Hard as a nickel muthafuckas act fickle
Bet yet it tickle, 'cause the nine got the back side
So I kick 'em 'cause the bullet take 'em for a ride
On a long trip, get in your shit and dip
187 up in the tape deck with the muder shit
Takin' a ship to the dome
Spice 1 is in the house mutherfucker, so let it be known
Yeah mutherfucker, let it be known

[Verse 4: Spice 1]
4-1-5 is my hood, that's where I'm from bitch
Black steel is my brother, fuck with me you'll get dissed
Boom boom to the head now your body's numb
I'll punk you out and slap your bitch and get a fifth a rum
There you are C.B.Bannern' all your casualties
That's what you get you fuck the 1-8-7 Faculty
I'm a fool to my bone, that's what's goin' on
My boy got static so I used this mobile telephone
It was busy so I hung up and I called twice
He said "who is it?" I said "it's M.C. muthafuckin' Spice"
He told me "someone sold my boy up like some col'd slaw"
Pack your nine, I'll pump the beat up in the Jaguar
I push the brakes and smash the gas and started smokin' shit
Picked up my phone and called my posse from the Oakland bitch
Shot to the city like a nine to the boat yard
We chopped him up and sent his fingers with the postcard
Think I'm insane? No, I'm just a little senile
And plus I'm caught up in this mutherfuckin' freestyle
And all you suckers must'a had a fuckin' payday
Nutty to fuck with S-P-I-C-E on any day
I'm so insane that my mind is gone
Check it out mutherfucker, let it be known
