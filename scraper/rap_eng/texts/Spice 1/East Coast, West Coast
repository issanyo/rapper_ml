Spice 1
Geah mane it's Speice 1 kickin' that gangsta (Blaw) original rude boy from the ole school mane, come wicked
Like dis foo, ha ha yeah, clip and a trigger method, straight from, straight out the east bay, west coast foo

Hello you've reached the muthafuckin' S-P-I-C-E
Me the ruthless nigga from the crazy streets of Cali G
Gots to come wicked, turn this muthafuckin track
So niggas dip yo Vogues from the front to the back
And just slide, down the block and hit yo' corna on three wheels
Spark up some of that kill, that chronic, that real
Indo green shit straight from Humboldt county
Ounce of chronic up in my pocket swisher sweets all around me
LA niggas dipped in Vogues, east bay niggas roll stangs
Bet your old school still ain't shit if you ain't sittin on them thangs, fo' 15's in the air shaking all yo' shit going boom boom, boom, boom boom, yeah, So don't get the 114
Get it all twisted and tangled as if you didn't know
We got the bump for that ass. we got the rump for that ass
And in the trunk we got the muthafuckin funk for that ass


Chorus: It ain't no party, like a west coast party cuz a east coast party ain't shit
It ain't no party, like a east coast party cuz a west coast party ain't shit

Simplē E : Aye yo', what it be like out there, this is your girl Simplē E, and this is your lucky moment, I'm straight up and down representing the East, the place where rhyming ain't nothing but errythang, all day, everyday, Jerseys definitely the spot

Abracadabra, dude don't know shit
I'm running through your nose with my incense
Psychedelic power, now I got to let ya know
Drink all you want, we can get some mo'
In the back of my rover, so let's ride
Ride to the corna, really wanna do some shit
Got your man all sprung on the Simple shit
Look at me, Dimple E, that ain't me
My freakin' name's Simplē
And ya can't test, I rhyme with the best of the business
So jock this verbal tennis
I got Spice on the 1 puttin' hoes in check
(ohh) Gives love but I'm givin it back
To the east the place called home where I roam
And get the funk for ya dome
But look-a-here, buddy boy, you can't toy with the east
Cuz the east got beats
The east got bump, the east got lyrics and shit
To make the whole world spin
Tell a friend
Let the E shit rip


Chorus: It ain't no party, like a west coast party cuz a east coast party ain't shit
It ain't no party, like a east coast party cuz a west coast party ain't shit

Spice 1:

Niggas don't wanna see me get funky like Bootsy, baby
I loccs up and get to breakin em off, takin they shit and talkin crazy
See, Cali niggas, we don't fuck around
Some roll with top down
Some roll with straight muthafuckin frowns
Seven-deuce glasshouse, four nappy-headed niggas
I'm in the backseat rollin blunts and drinkin liquor
I tell my dogs smobb the fuck out, it's time to go
And hit the corna store
So we can drink some mo'
Hennessy makes me feel fine
187 up in the house packin a fat nine
Can't be caught without my shit, nigga please
Muthafuckas know me and they know I'm stackin g's


Shit, haha, Yeah, muthafuckas straight get gatted up if you ain't got your shit, haha, that's how it's jumpin off on the West Coast, haha


Chorus: It ain't no party, like a west coast party cuz a east coast party ain't shit
It ain't no party, like a east coast party cuz a west coast party ain't shit

Simplē E:

Ain't nothin changed but the days, to blaze ain't enough
I got my counterpart thinking he tough
I do it smooth-like, I do it just like it outta be done
So kitty come, kitty come
Get a load of E's shit
I got the bump and shit
To make a muthafucka sit and recite my shit
So nigga, woah, bitch boy, back back
Don't make me act a fool and abstract
Subtract, eliminate ya face from your body
I like to party drinkin Bacardi
Breezers, young skeezers can't get with it
My style so foul toxic waste couldn't rid it
I'm rockin shades
And I'm sportin my braids
For the east, post north how we do it
We do it, we done it and run it, look at me
Spice 1 and the Simplē E
We got you silly suckers stuck on stupid
So move it
We be the bomb baby
We be the funk to freak
So see, ain't no party, like a east coast party cuz a west coast party ain't shit


Chorus: It ain't no party, like a west coast party cuz a east coast party ain't shit
It ain't no party, like a east coast party cuz a west coast party ain't shit
