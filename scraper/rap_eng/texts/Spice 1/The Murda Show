So step the fuck off this youknowI'msayin?

[Spice-1]
Ya see I'm nothin but a Mac-10 shooter
Killer man looter on the creep with the Glock
Got it cocked picidy pop
I cold shot when the cop drop m-a-money gone nigga
Mind of a lunatic on a steel trigger
Motherfuckin flash backs of nigga's bodies rip
From the AK blast on that ass hollow point to the tip to the toe
Creep slow and watch the blood hit the fuckin flo'
It's the goddamn murda show
Starring a nigga in black wearin a weed hat creepin low
And co-starring is a psycho motherfucker
He grew up in Compton bustin caps at the cluckers
His name is MC motherfuckin Eiht
He got the Uzi weigh a ton eatin niggas like a steak on a plate
So nigga get your popcorn and peanuts cause we nuts and we know
Sit back and watch a nigga murda at the murda show

(Chorus: Spice-1 & MC Eiht)
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock with the fools that I Glock
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock with the fools that I Glock

(MC Eiht)
Nigga, shut your fuckin trap, yeah your punk ass is short
Shorter than short when I peel your cap
The slide the slick, suck my dick
No mistaking, I bring home greens, fuck the bacon
The big black mack getting motherfuckers sprung
They'll be put in the trash by this Compton tongue
Eiht, Spice 1, kickin much ass for fun
Ain't nothin but some niggas on the run
Fools need to stay the fuck down
They can't hang when we bang from Compton and the Bay Town
It's like the last dance or your last chance
When I reach in for the strap in my fuckin pants
I pump lead then the scene is fled, ain't nothin said
Leavin your skinny ass dead, I can't sleep cause it's time to go
Fool or I'll be late for the murda show, nigga

(Chorus: Spice-1 & MC Eiht)
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock with the niggas that I Glock
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock with the fools that I Glock

(Spice-1)
Step in to the torture chamber, nigga, let me torch ya
Hangers on your motherfuckin back, bring ya scorcher
Psychopathic, madman, dead body chucker
Quick to pull the trigger on another motherfucker
Slangin to the basehead bitches in the alley
Killin for my motherfuckin cash in the Cali
My nigga MC Eiht will make the getaway drive
I got the gat hangin up out the motherfuckin ride
Niggas be getting the duck sick fuckin' with the player, sprayer
Lay a nigga out with the shout of the t-t-tech
Mic motherfuckin check one
Stabbin niggas up in the lungs bustin the caps with bloody guns
My Uzi's got my back if player haters wanna jump
The motherfuckin hollow head hit his chest thump, thump
And all the niggas leave his bloody body in the dust
One nigga dead seventeen caps bust
That's how the niggas do this shit where I'm from
Red-Rum leave your body numb blast of the dum dum
I got the Glock and I'm headin for the liquor store
Me and Eiht are two-eleven at the motherfuckin murda show

[Bridge]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven (4x)
The one-eighty-seven posse (3x)
The S-P-I-C-E, Eiht, G-Nut, and A-N-T

(Chorus: Spice-1 & MC Eiht)
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock or you might get the Glock
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and yo ass needs to stay the fuck down
Bangin from Compton and the Bay Town

(MC Eiht)
Yeah, come on
Uh, Spice-1 and MC Eiht
