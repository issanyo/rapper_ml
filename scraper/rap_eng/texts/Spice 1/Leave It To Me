[Verse 1]
Leave it to me, I'm a specialist, treacherous, professional
[?], I think a wild shit like a mad scientist
You pop a b-boy addicted to rap
Oh yeah, you never thought that I could bust that cap
I pull a rhyme to the beat and do you just like that
Your [?] baby couldn't rap
I pull a rhyme and process, if you use my formula, ask
Whatever happens just happens, I don't know the effects
W-E-S-T [?] where I be
Where everythin' is done, it don't matter how dangerously
Now, who can make a rap and rock a [?] party
A [?] MC couldn't do it so they laughin' to me
Because they know what time it is
The time is now
You can't tell me "stop rappin'" 'cause I don't know how
I just keep on rappin' to a funky beat
Eat suckas alive and sayin' "Bon appétit"
I'm on the mic, and you will agree
To L-E-A-V-E it to me

Leave it to me

[Verse 2]
You have the [?], you can't concentrate
My rhyme just put you in a tragic state
Snap, crack or pop, my rhymes are crispy
I mess around and make the fly girls go dizzy
I'm S-P-I, with the C and the Y
Now reddle me this, where's your mind?
On the moon for stroke, no brain control
My devastating rhyme turn into [?]
Old Spice, the [?] essence
I'm not talkin' about a key or a gram
I talk about a MC in yo face!
I shocked the world and pump the bass
I'm Spice on the mic, and you will agree
To L-E-A-V-E it me

Leave it to me

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm S-P-I-C-E, on the mic I'm very icy
Coolin' kind, kinda kickin'
Nothin' can excite me
On the mic I make the money maximum and a mill
Makin' suckas [?]
I can create, devastate, rap a [?] on your mind
Vicious is my mic, bubbalicious is my rhymes
Can't beat me or defeat me, trick me or cheat me
The suckas wanna hide, the ladies wanna freak me
Takin' out any rookie like the crumble out a cookie
You're goin' insane if you think your rap'll shook me
I'm the mic on the mack, I mean the mack on the mic
They [?] and excitin' like a Mike Tyson fight
I'm makin' money in the mack, the money makin' my rhymes
That's how the cookie chrome is [fresh and defyin'¿]
I'm Spice on the mic, and you will agree
To L-E-A-V-E it to me

Leave it to me

[Verse 4]
I'm Spice, the ace, the number one, uno
Don't try to front, don't [?] because you know
Who, is goin' to turn the major crew
Yeah, Spice, the double ice, whether liquid or fluid
I make your vision get hazey, too damn cold!
UZI down a fresh rhyme, now I'm 'bout to reload
Breakin' necks, playin' with a foolhouse dead
You wanna make a bet, I ain't fresh?
I get dead
Don't know jokes, portin' fat ass roll
22, double death, get a double dose
Of my skill, so as now I'm 'bout to get ill
Step back, [?] cool aids feel
Now, I'm Spice on the mic, and you will agree
To L-E-A-V-E it to me
