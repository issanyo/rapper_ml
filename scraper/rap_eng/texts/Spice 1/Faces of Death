Murder from the mind of a sick nigga
Thinkin bodies, dirty money, bloody Cocaine and Tech clips
I play with pistol grips, dead niggas and lolly tips
Suicidal sick shit, a psychopathic lunatic
Caught up in murder man, dirty up in this dead fool
Faces of Death, hog my dreams out of drains fools
Pullin pistols, tellin niggas to get the fuck back
I'm regulatin shit, there's money up on my dope track
See I'm a soldier in this game, ain't nothin strange
Got a nigga lyin on the floor with half of his fuckin brains
Murder and crazy it's just a part of the game
Niggas won't kill ya, just don't fuck with their Caine
Mack 10 silencer all ya heard was screams (AHHHHHH!!!)
All I seen was the gleams from the Infra-Red beams
Another motherfuckin walk-by in your hood
Better pack two clips up on your hips and it's all good
That nigga Death, he got more faces than a motherfucker
So don't be shocked if you're naked, bleedin in your gutter, niggas

Ay bwoy, ay this is... in this mother...

Fuck up all of your hoes, all up in your bed, in your bed
Faces of Death is an way gone...
Fuck all of your hoes, all in your bed, this is... in your bed, in this...
Faces of Death away, fuck up all your hoes all in your bed, in your bed
Faces of Death is an way gone... (all right)
Fuck up all your hoes in your bed (Twilight Zone to 1999 yet, Spice 1)
Don't you ever... in your bed
