[Intro]
No need for Lato's, pure straight out Bolivia
Peru, uncut baby, what?

[Verse 1]
Life is a struggle, that's why niggas I know stay on the juggle
Some hustle to double, others hug you to mug you
Poverty-stricken, they even turn a church kid into stickin'
It seems sickenin', but what? Whatever makes the pockets thicken
Fuck police and no remorse for the beasts
That's lost on the streets, that pistol whip a priest for a crosspiece
I'm lost chief, runnin' through strips, thinkin' of top dealers
Fillin' TEC clips, with 'cop killers' that could stop gorillas
Shovin' a stub nose in butt holes, I'm nutso
Skitzo, clepto, killin' shit up throughout the metro
My thug essence'll always keep me plugged with drug investments
Sketch my reference, takin' papers considered preference
And violations will lead to kidnappin', decapitation
So what you're facin' is realism that's in activation
Livin' off land with five honies playin' my hand
Me and fam, sippin' off Guinness stout and eatin' clams
It's all part of plans, a vet chillin' in Tamps, West and Stans
Outta state connect, slugs, sex, drugs and grands

[Refrain]
What? For my hype niggas (Uncut)
Trife niggas (Raw), 25-to-life niggas

[Verse 2]
This is as, pure as opium, purified for street players to open 'em
Space, like three L's laced with coke in 'em
Shots awoken 'em, fake uniform Jakes approachin' 'em
Six trips, to young clips and killers coachin' 'em
However though, fake ass niggas'll never know
'Cause my method's perfected, I'm movin' skeptic and never show
I'm soon to blow, stack doe, lay on the low
While I'm sippin' Cristal, I mess with Long Island and Mo'
A part of nature, me wan' acres in Jamaica
Puffin' exotic trees without seeds rolled up in leaf paper
So exhale, 'cause if I don't live to tell
Then fuck it, farewell, I'll see the rest of y'all niggas in hell

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
So all my goodfellas, heroin, coke and weed sellers
What the fuck cats can't tell us if they ain't got bread to bail us?
Happy to survive, I haven't seen it all, Peter pay Paul
From the connivers to the livest, they crack fool
It's all war, the streets are filled up with guns galore
Plenty young for war, gettin' their minds strung for sure
Yo dun, cock the 4.....

[Outro]
Motherfuckers think we're playin', back em down
Holdin' niggas for hostages, what? What?
