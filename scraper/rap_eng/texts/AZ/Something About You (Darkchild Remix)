[Spoken Intro: Rodney Jerkins]
They said I couldn't do it again, but I did
Darkchild, it's another Rodney Jerkins remix
Fred Jerkins remix, DJ Do-It-All
N.E. and AZ

[Rap: AZ]
Who's the mack in the weed-scented tinted hatchback?
Half Dominican, half Black, cash stack
I'm abstract, some Grand Marnier mixed with 'gnac
Rockin' the red Rangers hockey shirt with the hat
Can we sit and chat? Exchange ideas on this and that
Speak explicit facts, hoping it's pleasure to where we gettin' at
Envision that, queen size bed, Chanel sheets
Beach body queen, ooh, you smell sweet

[Verse 1: Ralph Tresvant]
Something about you, babe
Makes me feel the way I do
Know that I love you, babe
But you treat me like a fool
Wanna tell me babe
How I fit into your plan
Don't you deceive me, baby
I'm just trying to be your man

[Bridge 1: Ralph]
Oh, nobody ever made me feel this way
And oh, I think and dream about you every day
And oh, if I could only get you out of my mind
And oh, but every time I try to run away

[Chorus]
Over and over and over I try
To get you off of my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feeling I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feeling I get when I can't get enough

Something about you, babe
Ay, over and... (RT, second verse)

[Verse 2: Ralph]
Something about you, baby
Changed the way I looked at me
Is it obsession, baby
Or just curiosity?
You're takin' advantage, baby
Of my sensitivity
Do what you wanna, babe
Just give back my sanity

[Bridge 2: Ralph + Bobby Brown]
Something about you, baby (over and over and...)
When I think about you, baby (over and over and...)
(I think about you)
There's no doubt about it, baby (over and over and...)
I know it's suicide to stay
But baby, every time I try to run away...

[Interlude: Rodney Jerkins]
AZ and Darkchild...

[Rap: AZ]
I'm speakin' life, Avirex, Guess, sneaker type
It's like the preacher's wife amongst my miss
My piece, I keep her right
Splurgin', through the suburb, Lex' swervin'
High beams, me and my queen, we make a fly team
She corporate, I'm caught in street life, playin' it cautious
We both supportive, I once sexed her in her office
Chanel scent, Honda Accord with the tint
It's evident the way we bump heads, it was meant
You a quarter, we need a princess, let's make a daughter
Play the border, and give birth underwater
So what you want, huh? Let me know
Sun or snow? Pick the spot, we can go
Let's rock and roll, let a real cat lock your soul
Cop and blow, get dressed up, stop the show
And keep it pumpin', there's no doubt, you about somethin'
No stuntin', no frontin', no nothin'

[Chorus]
Over and over and over I try
To get you off of my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feeling I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feeling I get when I can't get enough
