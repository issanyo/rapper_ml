[Intro: AZ]
Yes sir! Another year, ha, ha, ha!
Toast ya glass please, this is champagne
You know what it is..
I love when the music sound so vibrant
So refreshin', alright let's get down to business

[Verse: AZ]
It's a - thin line between love & hate
And due time, a stable mind separates what's fake
It's two kind of paper takers, make no mistake
You got those that touch a little
Then there's those that rape
I've been embraced, got a face that the game can't shake
I'm known well like a Coke scale, my name hold weight
Impeccable taste, medallions in symmetrical shape
Since '88 been wildin' wit a electrical tape
Was a Ape to that street rap presented itself
Who could beat that?, so like Lennox I surrendered my belts
I was felt wit five funnies, my cars was dealt
Wit my money and subconscious, I was God himself
The weed helped, but overall I was so Hip-Hop
Certified as a cool guy to be so hott!
Verbalized like 2Pac, wit a East-Coast bop
Then the shit just changed, had to switch up lanes
Past predicted the future, though the present exist
Poetic wiser, I'm Kama Sutra, it's a heavenly bliss
Schooled as a little dude, only dealt as diss
But you know 'em people is sick and their medicine mix
So 50 it's only a run, enjoy this here
Matter of fact you ain't done, enjoy this year
And uh it's only fair I make this clear
You could neva fuck wit me, so don't neva fuck wit me
If money makes the man then on Iraq land
Saddam statue will still stand on top of the sand
You a fan so overall respect my hand
Cause I can see what's goin' on, I respect your scam
And we can toast to the life that showed us both
That trials and tribulation only bring forth growth
And when we ghost, you could bet who be felt the most
So live your life 'til the reaper approach..
