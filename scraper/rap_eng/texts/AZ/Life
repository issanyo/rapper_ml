[Intro]
You know what it is, turn my mic up
Turn my muh'fuckin' mic up on these faggot ass niggas
THAT'S MY WORD...

[Verse 1]
I'm linked to the loonies, yeah a live wire
Though I think like them Sunnis, shit, I never tire
Social drinker if you knew me
Plus, I'm a buyer
All bottles on me baby (baby..), put your bids in
Without a plan I just ran, and I slid in
Hundred grand, now we fam, I could fit in
Fake love from these Matrix thugs
So move, nothin' personal, or take these slugs
I'm back, the MAC double, clap
Strap to the lap in the hatch back
With the duffle pack, puffin' a sack
I never nap, but I see niggas sleep on me
So for that, I'ma make 'em sleep eternally
AZ the archangel, my smarts is tangled
So I could dumb at any time or send them sharks to bang you
Chains dangle, charms all glossy and lit
So like that shit Flava Flav said, stay off his dick

[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right, nigga
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right, muh'fucka
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right
Or get your bitch ass bodied tonight

[Verse 2]
First the, Lex off the lot then the Jag came next
Then them cheques started pop, and these crabs got vex
But when you, fresh off the block, you just laugh at threats
So baby pa, I'm a star for real, so no stress
One of the best that made that transition, sold the Beamer
Never a bitch nigga, stand pissin', got a, cold demeanor
Full of that ambition, still, hold the Nina
So no disrespect, but don't be (?)
I'm a steamer, puff trees consecutively
Classic shit all day like, B.I.G
Passionate, how I spit on this M-I-C
So pardon me, but y'all puffers better PYT
I am he, the most hated, but the hoes favorite
Flows flagrant, hall of famer like Joe Namath
You know I'm heinous, so why violate my slot?
I'm as serious as a Muslim when he makin Salah

[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right, nigga
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right, muh'fucka
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right
Or get your bitch ass bodied tonight

[Verse 3]
Made for the silver screens, vocals is vivid
Play the shade in the Philippines, I, blow through some digits
Still a fiend for the illest jeans, I'm supposed to live it
Was chose, like them Gucci soles that expose the signatures
No limit from the start, never seen a finish
With heart and a little smarts, proceeds is endless
It depends on what mark is left, if a OG's remembered
And how I chow was just part of my style, hear me now?
Cross paths with the craziest that, had no conscience
You know that kingpin, 80's shit, when they spaz they monsters
Get ya ass found chopped up in a trash bag in Yonkers
Thank God they only rappin' today, it's that real
I know some big wills that's still tryin' to, appeal they case
Baby face, biddin' niggas since '88
So I'ma skate 'til I slip and, shipped upstate
I know y'all hatin' ass niggas can't wait, muh'fuckas...

[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right, nigga
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right, muh'fucka
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right
Or get your bitch ass bodied tonight
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right, nigga
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right, muh'fucka
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get yo' shit right
Or get your bitch ass bodied tonight
