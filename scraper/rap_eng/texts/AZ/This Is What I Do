[Intro]
Yes, yes, ladies and gentlemen
I'll like to thank you for your support, love
Not only to me, but to the whole hip-hop industry itself
We as a whole, we've been weatherin' the storm
From the start, 30-plus years ago to now
But uh, like all victims of hate, we persevere
So allow me to speak not only for me
But on behalf of the hip-hop coalition
Every hood, every ghetto across the United States of America

[Verse]
Yeah, as a youngin, I was innocent and sponge-in
Just learnin' the life and, Christ second comin'
Well mannered and nice, got advice from a woman
But when the money get tight, the stomach start grumblin'
It was summer then, wasn't no Hummers then
Run in the Benz, you was kingpin and bubblin'
We started huddlin', puttin in, and jugglin'
A year later we straight, no more strugglin'
HA! But that was only the start
The love between the homies started fallin' apart
I guess anything's addictive when it's callin' your heart
Death and incarceration had us all in the dark
We was done, some would say "we had a beautiful run"
And if beauty is skin deep we was beneath the slums
I was numb, rap was like speakin' in tongues
So relax, I adapt within a week, I was sprung
Spoke facts on the track was like squeezin' a gun
No more crack, all the boys on my back hearin', "RUN!"
Yeah, I change done came
All them years, on the stairs with G Rap and Kane
I felt pain, them demons still lurkin' my brain
But the ways of the most high is too preserve to explain
It was the fame, that focused me, perfected my game
And like that, there's so many others that this rap will remain
And in exchange, we give fans the force of the reign
To feed, nurture, and breed, and be the voice of the slain
It's a shame, but that real shit come with the life
And in order to obtain, you gotta sacrifice
It's like cuttin' your bid shorter, don't pass on fights
I'm maturer, so you know all my facts is right
Plus my aura is like the spoilers on the Porsche at night
So be polite, just go for them critics that write
This is rap, we from the hood, just tryin' to get us a slice
Some'll bite, but the most just coast with ice
And, rock a little chain, and, get a little brain

[Outro]
Ha ha-ha ha, yea, hey, it is what it is
You know rap has no rules
See my enlightener he-he once told me once said
"If there is no devilish-ment, then there will be no Godliness"
"One can't exist without the other"
Knah'mean? It's like, a doctor is only needed to heal
And he caters to the sick, so the sick must exist, ya heard?
A minister, he only gives sermon to, uh you know
Those seekin' for forgiveness, so them sinners must exist
You know? It's simply simplistic, ha ha-ha ha
It's AZ the God, Constantine, Quiet Money for life
This is what I do, I'm here...
