[Chorus: Chris Classic (AZ)]
Rolling down the block pushing something you ain't never seen,  never seen (yeah)
Shorty riding shotgun so incredible (so incredible), gorgeous
Lay back in the turned down gangsta lean, gangsta lean
(I stay chilling daddy, you dig, ha ha)
This feeling is undeniable

[Verse 1: AZ]
Drama seas, sands so white
Bahamas beach, your plans go right
Out of reach, Rambo flights
In some two seater, sitting up like cleavage
Plane conceded, the prayer was a parapalegic
Save the chatter, my swagga's needed, believe it
Button ups, tailor custom cuts
Trees on the feet, physique fucks him up
That's what's up
Straight from the gutter side
To keep clean on everything my mother dries
Still I love Allah, sucker for southern fries
Facing affiliation, embracing my butterflies
I, been down for a minute now
There's none flyer, all the live wires in the ground
A young messiah, admired by entire town
Sun-fire, stay higher than Mariah's sound
So you know I'm on some other shit
Sneak peak, low creep, Deep Cover shit

[Chorus: Chris Classic]
Rolling down the block pushing something you ain't never seen, never seen
Shorty riding shotgun so incredible (gorgeous)
Lay back in the turned down gangsta lean, gangsta lean
This feeling is undeniable

[Verse 2: AZ]
Local wars, coastal brawls
If you ball at once, what's the most you saw?
If you fall, do you really got folks to call?
With that bell on hand, why they tell on fam? (sigh)
I feel his pain, how the unfortunate try to steal the fame
How it's more nauseousness than the killer in ray
Through so much anger, I know such danger
Thorough, I'm a decade in
From a borough way wicked than Wes Craven
Then again
Certain things I could never do
My whole life, get it right, get revenue
Get a wife, get a white BMW
2 door style, take that roof off now (ha)
Yhat was dreams of a younger me
Now my hunger's humongous as a hummer 3
Ferrari drop, with that time in the summer tee

[Chorus: Chris Classic]
Rolling down the block pushing something you ain't never seen, never seen
Shorty riding shotgun, so incredible (gorgeous)
Lay back in the turned down gangsta lean
This feeling is undeniable

[Verse 3: AZ]
I'm unsure how I felt before
But for now all I ask is Lord help us all
Help me stay focused, I'm self absorbed
And then sunny vibrations, realest spot that's spacious
Few cases, Julio Iglesias
Floor from the coupe, I'm like Owens in the booth
Big boy, had his known from the roof
Way before rap, I can more than fall back
All that, it's a beautiful zone
I stay mellow like musical tones (musical tones...)

[Chorus: Chris Classic]
Rolling down the block pushing something you ain't never seen, never seen
Shorty riding shotgun so incredible (gorgeous)
Lay back in the turned down gangsta lean, gangsta lean
This feeling is undeniable

[Outro: Chris Classic]
It's undeniable
It's undeniable
It's undeniable
This feeling is undeniable
