[Intro:]
Sugarhill remix
Hell yes

[Verse 1: AZ]
At times I window watch out the Mariott
Zoning on owning co-ops, foreign drop top coupes and yachts
Guzzling straight shots of scotch
Formulating up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot 'cause it's scorching hot
Making it hard trying to figure who's out to trap me
Pataki got all kinds of undercovers coming at me
Perhaps he won't be happy 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be sitting in Coxsackie
But never me, see my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstacy on a hill—that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make living this a must, plus this is real

[Hook: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
(Sugar Hill baby, Sugar Hill baby)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
(Pour (?) and lets count this money)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby

[AZ in background]
Ayo son, pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the Grants in the safe, cause we spending the Jackson's
The Washington's go to wifey, you know how we do

[Verse 2: AZ]
No more cutting grams, and wrapping grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seeking for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed to treat ya
Laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid
Wearing the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Caribbean cuisine
I guess being down for so long I'm all in store to see my dreams

[Hook: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
(Sugar Hill baby, Sugar Hill baby)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
(Pour (?) and lets count this money)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby

[Verse 3: AZ]
So until I see past the green pasture, me being supreme master
Ain't much more life to fiend after, but another chapter
A new way of life to adapt to 'cause these streets'll gas ya'
And have ya' caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killa crew more hospitable
Consciously aware plus political
'Cause though they claim that every man's created equal
Us as native people find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established we eating lovely, living lavish
Like the house of Versailles, Paris—I gotta have this
It's so plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough, to make living this a must, plus this is real

[Hook:]
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
(Sugar Hill baby, Sugar Hill baby)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
(Pour (?) and lets count this money)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
