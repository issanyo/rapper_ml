Stay set, sequel in the making
Three sixty my beliefs in the Nation
D's frisk me, they peep reparations
With a real nigga aura, though I speak education
So explicit, mix it with quantum physics
Gifted with Don lynguistics, sit and palm bitches
Palm biscuits, a youngin' was autistic
(?) Fly since the Garland District
Eccentric, inflictin' with the proper diction
Compositions consist of no competition
Christened by my folks out in park slope
Cigar smoke, stay awoke through Allah quotes
Cope with the crimes and the petty minds
Steady grind, let him rhyme, bet he shine
Bezzie time, VVS it because he's naked
Expose the despot, can't respect it when he dyslexic
Epic, keep the soldiers and the suckers separate
Perfected, don't speak on women that I slept with
Check it, been ordained since my first chain
And my attribute substituted my birth name
Words exchanged frequencies the (?)
Some would prefer fame, others lead and guide
Decide, confessions of the lost lessons
And my possessions keep a stressing nigga guessing
Question (?)
Hi haters, I'm back off of hiatus
