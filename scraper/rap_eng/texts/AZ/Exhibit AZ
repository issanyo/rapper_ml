[Intro]
Y'all know what it is
Almighty AZ, Brooklyn
Hahahahaha

[Verse]
I'm zig zag ziggin' it, I know niggas diggin' it
Life so legitimate, been nice since The Genesis
Mics, no blemishes
Polite, though militant
Real verse illiterate, I'm still on that tequila shit
Goons I gorilla with'll reassure my scrilla flip
Ventriloquist, hand in some clitoris
Would never float on foreign land I'm unfamiliar with
Did the dealerships, every year, iller whip
Dream from that killer shit, remain as a lyricist
The jail's hearin' this, females curious
In retail since Pete and C.L. did Reminisce
Peace to Jena Six, Emmett, Bell, my nigga Nick
Young Rel, the money (?), still in the mix
Love me a witty chick, that's pretty, don't penny pinch
Warm kitty could do the Diddy on the liqourice
Rap ridiculous, on tracks meticulous
So deprived I could cry when I mention this
This that different shit, vocals over instruments
Every verse is like a dose of some insulin
Cash in (?), clash with the ignorant
Flash that .40 cal, no smiles, I'm infamous
Facin' a quarter cent, my cause is more intense
Payin' respects to the deaths out in Port-au-Prince
