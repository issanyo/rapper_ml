[Intro]
Okay, if you in a club
I advise you to put your drinks down, and head to the dance floor
Anywhere else will be uncivilized
If you're in a car, pull over
Put the hazards on and let the windows down
This is something the world needs to hear
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Yes I'm Brooklyn's best till I'm put to rest
I heard tales of niggas sendin' shells to cook my flesh
No jail, never stale homie look how fresh
I'm low key like them old G crooks out west
As far as poetry I'm Nas, Biggie, Jay, Mos Def
Rakim, Kool G Rap, Kane, KRS
Pac, Common and Kanye, could say I'm blessed
Peace to Ghost, Raekwon and Ron Artest
This is suppressed hunger, I'm obsessed with summer
I'm for what runners is gunnin' them younger boys will gun ya
But any nigga icing your own wifey will warn ya
There's no wonder, every fronter wanna be stunner
I spit thunder, I'll miss when I'm six feet under
Legit, I'm just tryin' shift G-Unit numbers
Even rich niggas slip in the slumber
Shit happens but believe I'm back blastin a number

[Hook: repeat 2X]
This is not a life that we in, this is hell
This is not a stoop that we on, it's a cell
Life is not a gift in the hood, it's a charge
Because I'm still alive, that makes me a God
This is not a life that we in, this is hell
This is not a stoop that we on, it's a cell
Life is not a gift in the hood, it's a charge
Because I made it out, well that makes me a God

[Verse 2]
Yes my flows elite, I know the streets
I'm the Cochise of the East Coast I blow on beats
I create in the coma state how I doze to sleep
I keep dozing but never doze six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me
(Say what?)
I haze up 'fore haters hopin' I gave up
It's either you stay tough or you copin' to ?cage cuff?
From cold player to cold savor the hoes favor
Who's the most underrated, G Rap, AZ, or Jada?
Allah savior, bark but sharp as a razor
With street smarts in a Jedi heart like Darth Vader
Harsh behavior, puffin a Garcia Vega
The god see the haters but the larceny is greater
Pardon the player, I'm crunk with some defeats
But somehow somebody somewhere don't want me to eat
I'm one with the streets, I'm wanted and I'm comin' for keeps

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And it's a must I live it, the trucks is kitted
Too many peoples in the penal so duck or visit
Show it off when I freestyle, who fuckin' with it
A final song for song as long as the hustlers get it
As long the jewels on all is custom fitted
Diamond cut for cut the cluster ups the digits
Enough is enough you can trust I hush the critics
Buck for buck, yeah I'm buckwild I must admit it
The dough done did it, I'm Doley the flow is vivid
You know me, low key homie, only expose the snippet
So prolific, so sincere, so gifted
So melodic, y'all got it so twisted
Sent to do this, E-40 the rugers had a few Belugas
Brought it back to the sewers
True this no duets, no collabs, no regrets
You crabs, I'm just here tryin' cash some little checks

[Hook] - 2X
