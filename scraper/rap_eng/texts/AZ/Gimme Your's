[Production by Pete Rock]

[Intro: Nas]
Word-up A, I had the joint out
Nigga gon' ask me "what [I] want?"
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm like
Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back (we keep it real y'all)
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five boroughs

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money-gettin' niggas
Need my assistance to stack figures, beyond non-existence
Fuck keepin' my distance, cause bein' poor produced persistence
Plus pleas, a hundred G's will have me blockin' out of jail sentence
I'm recognized by the illest of individuals, killers and criminals
Even willies that's really into jewels
But still skeptic on who I cling to
'Cause every single nigga that swing through ain't my man just 'cause we mingle
Too much snake shit, even females be feedin' off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it
Temporarily, though it don't worry me
The wise verbally nourish me
Properly with that inner-city urban G, see
I fuck with those beyond my age bracket
'Cause they analyze and map it, get the papers and stack it
Leavin' no trace to track it, kingpin thinkin' tactics is accurate
That mack shit, livin' the lifestyle, we feel relaxed with

[Chorus: Nas (AZ)]
Just gimme (pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (rollin' trees, stackin' G's)
Gimme what you can't get back
(True dat, I thought you knew dat)
Just gimme (money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world? (rollin' with us)
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five boroughs

[Verse 2: AZ]
So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And until I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism, so I visualize it to live it
Movin' cleverly, with intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin' papers others would never see, G
So through the crest in my glow of fluorescence
Symbolizes the essence, you're sailin' in a schweppervescence
Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance
But informers'll have you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enormous
Life's a performance so players play with endurance
'Cause for more cents, any villain's willin' to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
'Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so...

[Chorus: Nas (AZ)]
Just gimme (pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (rollin' trees, stackin' G's)
Gimme what you can't get back
(True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin' with us)
Gimme what you can't get back (It's real, NYC)
Just gimme (QB), just gimme (B-K, VT)
Gimme what you can't get back (see me, AZ y'all, representin')
Just gimme (yeah, the street life is trife life)
Why don't you gimme the world (representin')
Gimme what you can't get back (life's a bitch and then you die)
