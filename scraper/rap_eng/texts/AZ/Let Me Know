Its international players shit you know what I mean
Its big boys shit, y'all little boys get the fuck
Outta here, ya heard

Floss with me and stash holds more than 50
Snatchin the baddest bitch no luggage, we off to Sicily
First class flights, see me shine matchin in white
Gatored up with the faded cut flashin the ice
Fuck that, niggas know me, keep low key
Sneezers nosy, live niggas creep OT
From all the hustle on the streets daily numbin the brain
From drainin out of his game but we runnin the same
Loving the pain, thug niggas thuggin in the rain
Broke niggas stay broke stingy huggin they chain
Church niggas just chill stay connect and thoughts
While the vest they lost warrants catch them in courts
Catchin the source, the students that lessons is taught
I been near through my younger years perfecting the sport
All praises do for all those facing the zoo, this is the crew
Soon we'll be blazin that chew

If you want it (if you want it)
Just let me know (let me know)
If you want it (if you want it)
Just let me know (let me know)
If you want it (if you want it)
Just let me know (let me know)
Let me know (let me know)

I do this for y'all, I ball for y'all
Hit the streets strap up go to war for y'all
Its all for y'all, Champagne across the ball
Late night hit the strip see me floss the car
Hit for now, all smiles no tears for now
Quiet money know the styles see all years from now
Anti, still camerin shots when remise with eyes
And hands through the wise
Strong ties dance with the live
Act hold up, my whole team actin all up
Brooklyn! hear to speak niggas packin all up
Poet at heart, dart making throwin at them charge
Hit or miss still a way splitter blow them a part
Flow with the sharks, real killers coat with the dark
Is these playin in the streets they awoke to the art
AZ on your project walls act to the halls
Respect all the laws, its locked now check all the doors

[Hook]

What y'all niggas want, y'all know who y'all fuckin wit
What up

From all the new, solar now roll with the crew
Young in, now a nigga just know what to do
Trustin a few, feds had me flushin pervu
You fuckin with who?
Slippin I'll be bustin at you
Money to get, y'all niggas that run your shit
Dum on your bitch, butt fuck her cum on her tits
I'm young and convinced, captive trainin for T's
You ain't in my league just chill and keep blowin your weed
Quiet as kept, cash flow relyin on my rep
Sizing the threat, down for like knives in the vest
Sure shots for the war blocks caught in the box
Call for you ox, crab niggas call for the cops

[Hook]
