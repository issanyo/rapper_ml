[Intro: 5 Percenter talking]
Yo God, do the knowledge, God, it's like this
This world is ruled and controlled by societies
That exists within the societies, that exists, within the societies, God
You understand?
These secret societies is maneuverin' within society to control society
That's why society is outta control
33rd and one third, I heard the illuminated ones, huh

[Verse 1: Amar Pep]
The last days we're facin', that's the case when the emanicpation
Proclamation decays, back to the plantation
The government plottin' a nuclear detonation
Destroyin' vegetation, water, the New World Order means starvation
The eye on the dollar symbolize illumination
A society, secretly overseein' population
Understand it, the government plans to enslave the planet
I'm trapped in a phase, thinkin' of ways, can it
Happen? 85 percent of the population nappin'
Prayin' in churches, catchin' the Holy Ghost clappin'
Across the border travelin', I found the Nile across the water
Teachin' my peoples the age of the New World Order
Twenty five to click blood line, we toast off wine
Snap clips in 9's, with minds more advanced than Einstein
And Murman, knock down walls like Berlin
To get out, we can't get in, we can't win

[Chorus]
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out!

[Verse 2: Barsham]
See I, wrote up a composition, I made a decision
For competition, some invite lifestyles that I be livin'
With tribes I been in, with the little brothers that's sinnin'
So I started to vision, crack fiends formin'
In a collision, my mind is in that position for soul fishin'
My only dream was to be a musician
Better yet a mortician, that's the life condition
'Cause everybody knows they gonna die, crackers livin' lies
I Inovise plus I feels the vibe, mother cries
Plenty mothers that tries, now that she knows her son's gonna die
Take a trip, pass the line, now ease
The mind escape from the crimes of New York times
'Cause I'm one of the brothers who made it throughout the others
The Rotten Apple's tryin' to break loose from these shackles
No doubt, I follow routes, guzzlin' Hennessy, mixed with 'stal
In the ghetto, we can't get out
We can't win

[Chorus]
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out!

[Verse 3: AZ]
Nothin' can stop the nation, elevation, daily operation
Since man creation, we increase the population
Proper education, got us tappin' in information
Preventin' from gettin' locked under top-secret investigation
Guiliani's part of Illuminati
A million minds in one body designed to decline society
They want at least 1.2 billion deceased
While the rest is left with the mark of the beast on their domepiece
Prepare, the signs of the times now are near
That outbreak scare, found in Zaire, soon be here
So tune your ears, and be saved from a slave
'Cause in a matter of days I'ma E-Q your brainwaves
AZ the Visualiza is wise as Elijah
Here to advise ya, and bring out the realness that's up inside ya
Intoxication, my voicebox rocks the nation
Street affiliation, the Doe or Die situation

[Chorus]
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out!
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out!
