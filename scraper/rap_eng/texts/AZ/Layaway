Girl, I won't be caught up
I won't be the way
That I thought we could be
Cause girl I know see how you are
Nothing comes for free baby
I gotta pay your fee

Money's what she wants
Cheddar is the key
She's in love with me
There's no myth she ain't gotta do it for free

I gotta put your love on layaway
To make you stay
I can't afford your love
Ooh mami mami, mami mami

Girl, I'm workin 9 to 9
So I can keep mine
I gotta live my life
You, thought that you could get me
To be your baby's daddy
Girl you're funny funny

Money's what she wants
Cheddar is the key
She's in love with me
Cause she ain't gotta do it for free

I gotta put your love on layaway
To make you stay
I can't afford your love
Ooh mami mami, mami mami

Rap

I gotta put your love on layaway
To make you stay
I can't afford your love
Ooh mami mami, mami mami

Girl I know that's what you want now girl
I know that's what you want now girl
Don't front it's what you want know girl
I know that's what you want now girl
Don't front it's what you want now girl
Don't front it's what you want now girl
I know that's what you want now girl
Now say just what you want now girl
What you really want now girl
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh

I gotta put your love on layaway
To make you stay
I can't afford your love
Ooh mami mami, mami mami
