[Verse 1: Vado]
As the sun rise I wake in my apartment
Think how many banks I could take out a 100 large in
For my day is started I walk in the closet
Pop a tag, grab a garbage bag to split my cigars in
F's in the carpet go with my Fendi garment
Watchin' Game Time, who had 50, that was Harden
Throwin' gang signs, gettin' busy at the garden
Shorty Facetime, real pretty, and she dark skinned
They lost a margin, a big cut
Caught slimin' at the pick up
Wonder why he ain't pick up
They found five in his pick up
Where you at? Let's get up
Need to know where that coke go
And was it the boys? Was it the niggas we both know?
I'm like oh no, load six in the .44
Grab me the 12 gage, hit it right in low coat
They low though at a loft in Soho
Tell 'em we want it back, pay double the (?)

[Verse 2: AZ]
I ain't with that, we can rap when I get back
Gather the click clacks, call on who to go kidnap
Snatch a six pack, get low and just sit back
We never panic, we got mechanics to fix that
This that real shit, gotta let niggas kill shit
Make 'em feel it, let 'em know that it's still lit
Designer lace, them pretty Porsches in our ace
The city's nauseous, they see the fortress as high stakes
Annihilate, violation, they out of place
Accommodate, take whatever out of the safe
It's the game though, back and forth, the same old
Friend or foe, we at the end of the rainbow
Say it ain't so, not a talk on my thing show
I been about it since British walkers and Kangos
In a Range Rove, holler back when I change clothes
So we can creep on the streets and let these lames know

[Verse 3: Vado]
So that's the angle? I try time with cables
Make 'em lie on the table then put the iron in his naval
What's the time they gave you? We at the diner on Maple
Know my slimes is able, a bunch of lions and bengals
Tired of serachin', ridin' around conversion
On my mind's the urge to see slime in person
I can't wait, what's the plan ay? Let's go with plan A
Meet up with gang day, headshots soon as we handshake
It's simple, play like you cripple wearin' a trench coat
See me talkin', speed up the walkin', and let the fifth go
Keep it movin', pass up the tool, and that's when you get ghost
Start manoeuvrin', later we coolin' and have her big toast
It's the lifestyle just follow lead
So take it off or die in ring, Apollo Creed
It's 'bout survival, you lift the rifle, you gotta squeeze
On the Bible, could win the title if you got a team
Nah mean? Vado
