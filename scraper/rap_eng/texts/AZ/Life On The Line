[Intro: AZ (singer)]
It's so much
In so little time that needs to be accomplished
For the fact with me on this track is so live
How could this be denied?
It's hater-proof
Like Snoop once said
“This here's protected by ballers with big dicks and 187 skills”
(I put my life) that's if it's a must you test us
(Put my life on the line, hustling the streets tryna keep you a dollar)
Hustlers (So put my life)
What it do? (Put my life on the line, let's come and love each other
Give me some shine)
My life's always on the line, dig?
(I put my life, put my life on the line)
I'm a soldier, survivor, period
(I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme)
No question mark is needed
(I put my life, put my life on the line)
You already know what it is
(Put my life) Allow me...

[Verse 1: AZ]
From them brick tenements to them cinema flicks
So many quick nightcaps, it's hard to remember some chicks
Flashbacks of certain cats in a similar mix
Sit home doodle semis—such sinister shit
Converse with my Old Earth, in any event
Them hot shells ever hit me, just tell my sons gently
Simply, I'm a rider, I provide for the fam
A Da Vinci with the smarts, hard as Semite Sam
Empty I am, but my subconscious so in-tune
Love the nonsense, they harmless
They know I'm immune, I'm a goon
Geared up, properly groomed
Appear square so the unaware can only assume
From the womb to the tomb, it's a bottomless doom
You pop shit outta pocket, I'ma pop ya balloon
Drop maroon, low Mauri's with it, cocked on glory
See, some may know the half but here's the whole story, shorty

[Chorus: singer]
Put my life, put my life on the line
Hustling the streets, tryna keep you a dollar
So put my life, put my life on the line
Let's come and love each other, give me some shine
I put my life, put my life on the line
I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme
I put my life, put my life on the line
Put my life

[Verse 2: AZ]
Blood set, Crip set, G-Unit, Dipset
Nas got rich and reached back, I ain't riff yet
With cheques, crack sells, Elmira black tales
So many wires and you wonder why it's packed jails
Pink border pastel, mink sporter, snatched mail
Rap well since Sugar Hill, homie, ask L
It's a life that I learned to enjoy
Higher fire employed, my attire's McCoy
Not a toy, not a tear when they bury the boy
Not a care, no fear; nothing's here to destroy
So don't annoy, I do this for them Chips Ahoy
I probably die for the cause, blood rising through the gauze
It's a underworld hiding in the floor
Hand on the Bible; still lying to the law
I'm still rhyming, I'm surviving on tour
With the war wounds on me, y'all dudes so corny, cowards

[Chorus: singer]
Put my life, put my life on the line
Hustling the streets, tryna keep you a dollar
So put my life, put my life on the line
Let's come and love each other, give me some shine
I put my life, put my life on the line
I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme
I put my life, put my life on the line
Put my life

[Verse 3: AZ]
Back from hibernation, high classification
Certified, I survived from the last generation
Verbalized about pies and past situations
The fly guys, and they demise, how they lives was taken
How they cries was deprived, and they sided with Satan
He was sitting with twenty-five, and got fried from the basin
Manipulation, mood swings the minds of men
Have them do things to get out, then they right back in
Once again, heard it said hip hop was dead
Before Bus' shaved his head, cut off his dreads
Before Kim went on a limb, got sent to the Feds
It seems deep but she chose street-cred instead
Just like me, a true G is hard to find without a fee
I still put my life on the line
It's modesty when you reap from a life of crime
And honestly, it's no receipt for that price to shine

[Chorus: singer]
Put my life, put my life on the line
Hustling the streets, tryna keep you a dollar
So put my life, put my life on the line
Let's come and love each other, give me some shine
I put my life, put my life on the line
I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme
I put my life, put my life on the line
Put my life
