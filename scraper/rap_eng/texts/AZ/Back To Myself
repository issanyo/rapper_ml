[Intro: AZ]
I'm ready.. what's up?

[Chorus: SoShy]
Beautiful dream, dark is the life
I wanna swim
Now that I'm saved, beauty in me
God is the light, I wanna scream
I'm back to myself (back to myself), hey
Back to myself (back to myself), hey
Back to myself (back to myself), hey
Back to myself (back to myself), hey, hey

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yes, it's me in that SUV
Linen shorts, Gazelly specs with that Gucci tee
Never off when I rep, a young Spoonie Gee
I'm a Kid Capri ever nigga Brucie B
How I play, be the proof, yes the truth is me
Never stray from my roots though, truthfully
We all sidetrack, but the live slide back
Big boy shit in the mix, try that
On my own dick, used to ask why I rap
I'm more of a mogul man, I'm the logo to the brand
Since Illmatic went dolo with the clan
20 years at it, see my photos on the 'Gram
Damn, I'm OG in this muh'fucker
Reminiscin' on the streets, just another hustler
Tryin' to eat, out of reach from the suckers
Word to my old TEC, I'm back like I never left

[Chorus: SoShy]
Beautiful dream, dark is the life
I wanna swim
Now that I'm saved, beauty in me
God is the light, I wanna scream
Back to myself...

[Verse 2: AZ]
Bein' a street dude, most things you see through
It's different levels of peaceful and degrees of evil
I keeps it equal, exercise both when need to
I'm definitely the definition of what growth can teach you
Cool, calm and collected, from a Don's perspective
Used to run around unarmed and reckless
A charm and necklace, gettin' it, I'm on some next shit
Been a fan since seein' Flash and them perform The Message
Born aggressive, meek now I'm deceptive
It's deep, how I can peep the foul laws of justice
Dust blunts and stems or, jewels and gems
Wise men and fools, the two don't blend
There's rules to win, get a pen, let school begin
Family is forever, you can choose your friends...

[Chorus: SoShy]
Beauty in me, so I'm
Back to myself, hey
Back to myself (back to myself), hey
(Back to myself, back to myself)
Back to myself (back to myself), hey
Back to myself (back to myself), hey, hey
... Back to myself, back to myself

[Verse 3: AZ]
In life you accept it or you's a neglected
Confused, but street enthused though grew eclectic
Keep connected, creep when, least expected
It's deep, in one week went from sheep to shepherd
Mystique, mathematician, a rap rendition of
Iron Mike in the ring, my insight is extreme
For what it seems to seein' it unfoldin' your dreams
I'm on my theme, became the feet and chose with the team
Never lean, instructed to death or abducted, can't touch it
I'm stand up, I ain't nothin' to fuck with...

[Outro: SoShy]
Back to myself...
