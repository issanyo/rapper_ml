[Verse 1: AZ]
Serpent Nas, nocturnal
Circumsizse rock thermos
Ride or die homicide vibe when them shots burn you
Hop ergo keep low close shop
Hop hurdles hot verbal
Worry not got the blocks further
Fast follow numb off the rum red bottle
Jet models from jump
Been a threat to some survival
One bible same crew few rivals came through
Blue rifles flames foo
Fuck a I'm the same too
The game is small, the shells is large
I came to war on hammer god
I'm from the core I claim for all
So fire wind ready I annihilate deadly
High in the Chevy
Movin' on the two way, tag on the two way
With fam on the toche
Blue ray, up close push a nigga two pace
Soufle, superstar stat without the Lou pay

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
You get it poppin' so do we homie, cock yo shit
I don't care where you from, who the fuck you get
This is D-Block, niggas betta rep they set
Cause it's on, it's on (2x)

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Yeah, Hey yo, I keep the hammer cocked right on stage
Sheek Louch an OG but, I don't have to act my age
Fuck around I'll let that silverback out his cage
Hide the body till yo skin color, cocaine rage
Listen, I suggest you keep a calm like fishin'
For this fire come out like, nitro glycine
Back to you, load it up, you think I'm pissin'
I'll leave these coward motherfuckers rotisserie chicken
Seen it done it, ran from police
I got diamonds in my eyes like my rose stole Jesus' piece
We could do this now or after the show
Hey yo Bully clip up
Police coming? Fuck it, pop some mo'

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
You get it poppin' so do we homie, cock yo shit
I don't care where you from, who the fuck you get
This is D-Block, niggas betta rep they set
Cause it's on, it's on (2x)

[Verse 3: Hell Rell]
Stop, picture me being scared of a snitch nigga (nope), bitch nigga (nope), I'ma young rich nigga (yeah)
Got some backs for you, so come bitch nigga
Wanna talk bricks nigga? Lets get rich nigga
See I'ma paid man, plus a made man
God must've had me in mind when he made man
And don't worry I'ma find all my enemies
Smoke blunts of kush so my dime is a Hennessy
They call me grim reaper
They got a page I whip back the beepers
I'm all about a Franklins like a rether
When it come to that coke I'm the ring leader
Don't make me sweep up the streets with the street sweeper
Come to my crib
Let you see what I'll do nigga
Knock some walls down make the indoor pool bigger
You can't relate to that talk, because I'm too richer
The hit is out, Guess on who?
You nigga!!

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
You get it poppin' so do we homie, cock yo shit
I don't care where you from, who the fuck you get
This is D-Block, niggas betta rep they set
Cause it's on, it's on (2x)
