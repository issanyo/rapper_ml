[Intro]
What's good?
Yeah, AZ
Premo, what's good?
Wop, what's good?
Stop playin with these motherfuckers man
You gotta crush these niggas, Wop
Straight up...

[Verse]
Gladiator style, Timbs tied tight
Camoflauge and fatigues 'til they read my rights
I be's that different breed, they don't bleed my type
Indeed
I'm knowledge seed, don't need no hype
The doer, could snatch the medulla off Medusa
Pursuer, pop off Rugers and fuck cougars
Culohas, mixed with Jamaican rum
My face is numb
My only words for you niggas is I ain't the one
Doly, half of you cowards'll never know me
You real, show me
I'll blow you down like a stogie
Fuck your trophies
And fuck who's live in ya top 5
I'm only here to put highs in niggas' vibes
