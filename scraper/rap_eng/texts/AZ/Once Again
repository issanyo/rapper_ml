[Intro]
I'm back first and foremost; I'd like to thank Nas
For allowing me to have be on the Illmatic, and that Stillmatic Joint
Changed the game a whole lot, secondly I'd like to thank the Notorious B.I.G
Who put Brooklyn on the map, you the revolution of that era
And all the artists that came after the era we started
I'd like to Thank the East Coast, West, the North, Dirty dirty
This is my story, welcome me back

[Verse 1]
For all those I still speak to guess we still peoples'
Life's more peaceful when you low and you eating legal
Certain niggas never spoke now it's peace to see you
It's a different side 'cause it's the streets too, pleased to meet you
Just think I was a thief and kieful
Sold coke even dabbled in a bit of diesel
Skid bidded saw the light and I slid with it, left the life
But for the price I can live with it we all pawn
Know a few niggas that's coming home
Could see 'em now in that '86 summer zone
Hope they adapt, whatever led niggas to smoking cracks
Knew a few that went too far for me to coach 'em back
What a waste, this little blood niggas'll cut ya face
Catching a case'll make you fuck around and touch your safe
This all I know, intelligence is all I show
I'm from the roots and the truth is that I love the dough
Welcome me back, huh

[Verse 2]
You attract some of the baddest when you platinum status
That's why I stay with prophylactics after what happened to Magic
Six days of my creation had to relax on the Sabbath
Remember asking certain niggas to past me a package
I was blind moving ass backwards
But you can bet it was the grind that made the cash massive
Back on my feet, accapella used rap to no beats
On the run, dun, was the first one to clap at police
I ever saw, can never catch me in the presents of flaws
Push the Accord in '94, MAC-11 in the board
Who wanna bring it? Since Nas, niggas swore I was Queensbridge
That's surprising from the wise I was taught to be lenient
Move in silence, my moms claimed my music was violent
Had to school her, let her know that I'm a user of talents
Many faces, Gucci sneakers with the skinny laces
Fendi sweats and Begets all up in the bracelets
Welcome me home, huh
