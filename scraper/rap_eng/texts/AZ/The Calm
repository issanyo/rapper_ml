[Intro]
It's always calm just before the storm, you know...

[Verse]
I mean, it is what it is
The more drama, the less you see, SUV's
Homicide, death in threes
Momma cries 'cause her joy and pride left, she grieves
Bullet holes, cold blood, they just let you bleed
No love, a million hugs can't protect your seed
Even wifey soon fuck, she got sexual needs
It what it be, trapped, H-O-O-D
Or facing a 20 flat if you don't fall on threes
Please believe, life, it'll buckle your knees
Either, niggas get sniped or they cuffing your sleeves
Quoting degrees amongs men with emotional needs
My city is filled with murderers and multiples breeds
I'm trying to breathe, bitterness and signs of fatigues
But these niggas so illiterate their kind's a disease
Where the G's that puts the principles that founding Degrees
At the Municipal going through the typical squeeze, was never free
Life move at mystical speeds, so at night
It's only right when you twist you some trees so you can see it
Cold-blood hater, couldn't be it
Or favor for a favor passing paper if you need it
Speeded, doc did dirty but not defeated
The last of the level head thoroughbreds breeded
Cheated, for love I gave and never got
I agree with, those that pray and make salat
They serving on a higher plane
Am I the same? From the era of the level niggas dying for a chain
Why I explain, these teenage boys, they wanna bang
Til they caught get arraigned then them Courts where they hang
Will it change? Us willies and ballers are we to blame?
Kitted Coupes with us spoilers adding water to the game
Make it rain, when the only concern is to maintain
Cause either you label lame or lives label's the same
Our nigga drained is like an inferno full of pain
My journal to the game is eternal in my veins
How I came is how I'm leavin I still believe in
Show and prove, I choose CÃŽROC over Seagrams
Freedom in so many forms, right from wrong
Life's a bitch, niggas die on the norm...

[Outro: scratches]
AZ, still right in your face, that hustling is so in me
That hustling is so in me
That hust, that hust, that hustling is so in me
That hustling, that hustling
That, that, that hustling is so in me
