Intro: Nas

Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs

Verse 1: AZ
Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money-gettin niggas
Need my assistance to stock figures, beyond non-existence
F**k keepin my distance, cos bein poor produced persistence
Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin out of jail centres
I'm recognised by the illest of individuals
Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels
But still sceptic on who I cling to
Cos every single nigga that swing thru, ain't my man just cos we mingle
To mistake shit, even females be feedin off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high hopes help me escape it
Temporarily the window world, don't read the wise
Verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC
I f**ked with those beyond my age bracket
Cos they analyse and mack to get the papers and stack it
Leavin no trace to track it, keep on thinkin tappers is accurate
That mack shit, livin the lifestyle, we filled with black wit

Chorus: Nas, (AZ)
Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin trees, stackin G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs

Verse 2: AZ
So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And in too, I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism so I visualisin to live it
Movin cleverly wit intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin papers, others would never see, G
So do the crest in my claw, flourescents
Symbolises the essence, you're sailin in a sweppervescence
Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance, but informers
They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enourmous
Life's a performance so players play wit endurance
Cos from war sense, any villain's willing to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
Cos though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leavin thievin, we'll be leavin wit some kind of doe
So...

Chorus: Nas, (AZ)
Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin trees, stackin G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back (It's real, NYC)

Just gimme (QB)
Just gimme (B-K, VT)
Gimme what you can't get back (See me, AZ y'all, representin)
Just gimme (Yeah, the street life is trife life)
Why don't you gimme the world (Representin)
Gimme what you can't get back (Life's a bitch......)
