[Verse:1]
We been down from the dirt genesis birth
Woulda swore we woulda balled 'till they set us in the earth
We was been on our worst with the letters on our shirt
Jewels on our chest only moved with the best
The rest was upset but the rest was no threat
Fresh was the less sky box at the Jets
Floor at the Nets we was more than some vets
Legandary known balled more than the mess
But guess princess says on the neck for wreck
Venley I styled off the deck, was speck
Jail calls accept all collects connects had all kinds of niggas in check
Correct
I wouldn't of known this here was next got a gun to my head and you want a nigga dead

[Talking]
I mean, listen you could have it all baby I mean, I only get one life ain't no remix on it we family still. So many whirls we go through, my shorty

[Verse:2]
I showed you the life I gave you the mic
You ain't shy no more you say what you like
You play all polite but its all day and night
Bipolar zone but I gave you the throne
Next to the king you untreacherous thing
You set the stage I selected the ring your first Jimmy Juice your red bottom shoes
Spy bag collection I had direction
I kept giving you kept accepting smiley face texting so wide a deception
Why munip me? do it so slickly you said you loved I but you fucking the next guy
If it was me you'da pulled the left eye but let's try
Though I can't believe it
I know the best I but we got a chance to weave it
See its never too late when together you stay
I just would've never ever thought you stray

[Talking]
