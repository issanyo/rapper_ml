Minolta, double exposure, wide lens view
Check credentials and niggas next to push tha Benz through
You know the glow iced out rings long dough
Spandex, Moshino, ho bitches lettin' their thong show
I play the game, took plenty paper still remain the same
Age and name, barrel link chain, lettin' my piece hang
Domestic, no more crime play but still connected
It's ethics, calculated steps through geometrics
Ways spendin', double shades of beige linin, 97' Expedition
Displayed with all the trimmins
Travel light push tha LS on casual nights
Have you ever puffed the chalice weed pipe
That shit will have you right
I roll dice trying to defrost from this cold life
Used to sell coke on tha strip, but now I hold mics
And plan soon to pack and vacate somewhere in Canc√∫n
Escape to a cozy estate filled with mad rooms, furnished up
Too many foul niggas time to turn it up
Push about a buck and shift gears burn the clutch
Cause it's like this, for these chips I strike swift preciseness
Precious jewels a life thats priceless
I payed my dues and through it all I never trade my shoes
Cash rules new crews who made the news
We all for paper, I guess greed is just a second nature
Indeed shots of Henrock, and weed'll escalate ya
Some mostly touch along the line crossed up
I took tha short cut puffin' on blunts, bustin' off nuts
The night type, love dime bitches and night life
Casino dice sexy strip dancers and white ice
I seen the movie most of you niggas couldn't move me
Truly it's like a 6-shot ruger against an uzi
So bust ya run, or cock back bust your gun but I fake none
I remain like the sun bless tha stong livin'
Intellect an long vision, connects in prison
And real niggas wit recognition
So respect the mission volume one
Second addition the next dimension
Dotted line sign your deposition
