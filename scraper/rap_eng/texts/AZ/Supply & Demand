[Skit: Narrator and Sound Effects]
Heartbeat thumps
Planes Fly Overhead
Explosion
Gunshots
They say that life comes down to a series of moments
And in those moments are choices
Decisions that we make that could affect our lives, forever
We were in one of the worst fights we had ever been in
But all I could think about
I mean, the one thing that kept echoing in my mind
Was how?
How did we get here?
