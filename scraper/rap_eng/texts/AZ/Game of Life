AZ, revelations is here
In the end, nobody wins
In this game of life

[Verse 1]
From a street level, you eat with the devil here
Dance with the wolves, keep that heat on your metal here
Nobody cares, cuz everybody's rebels here
It's so real, you ain't even gotta double dare
You can hear, all them cries from the ghetto here
Lies is what they sell you here
Why would you settle here?
Ha, I'm trying to hide from them haters here
Get high, stay fly in the latest gear
But some how, homicide is like the Matrix here
Why we gotta take it there, just for us to make it fair
Yeah, and I'm losing all my patience here
I try to wonder why them tourists vacation here
It's them dollars that, all of us is chasing here
German, Jamaican beer, few of us is taking here
Yeah, ain't no winners we just disappear
It ain't just sinners niggas snitching here, listen here

[Hook 2X]
Ain't no winners in this game of life
Some'll claim that they came here twice "My God"
My advice, never change your stripes
Cause ain't no winners in this game of life

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's only here where you lose all your morals here
You get used, all the girls giving orals here
Most dudes, for some reason feel immortal here
The cause is where they call you here
The government extort you here
Yeah, your own loved ones'll cross you here
And of course, being a boss it'll cost you here
I swear, crack fiends is trying to short you here
I need some kind of coffee here
I'm mad momma brought me there
Yeah, this Hennessey got me saucy here
Don't wanna kill but still they trying to force me there
Can't chill, my chicks trying to talk me there
But that ain't how they taught me here
I can never walk in fear
NO, cell phones is walky-talkies here
Yeah, it's like my nightmares stalk me here
I'm a beast till them motherfuckers chalk me here
Leave me in a flossy pair
You know it's not my choice we here

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I feel lost in this motherfucking jungle here
If you ain't live I advise you not to come through here
No lie, most these guys ain't too humble here
The livest crews crumble here
We drive through them tunnels here
Yeah, trying to survive through the summer here
It's shaky grounds everybody got a number here
We make sounds but we communicate under here
Niggas facing hundred years
Some mothers is unwanted here
Yeah, even taskforce don't want it here
Shit, was all the crash course coming here
It's so dark, it's even shady when the sun in here
All of us is done in here
Ain't nowhere to run in here

[Hook]
