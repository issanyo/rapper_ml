[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ayo, ayo
Wood green jacket in the clapper
Catch me inside Mojito City with a stretched plump actress
Grabbin her thong, the light-skinned Nia Long
Rich niggas way back, the bitch do John
Why would you ever wanna be here?
Guns bigger than me here
I'm like the centipede, three pair
Wallabees, first pair ferocious
Guns from Scotia, everybody know I flow like oceans
Truck little pieces, how we gonna eat this?
I walk around fly, high, telekinesis
And my lady, a well known designer who fell in line with me
And all she do is sell LV
We in the grow house, trees look alone
I built the Dutch Master train set kid, relax, you home
And watchin' Carmelo and the Knicks go in
I'm playin' my square, I'm in the front row, my bitch roll in
That's not wifey, that's a lover
She gave me some top, but how we met, she was alone with my brother
Givin twenty-year veteran good dick, came to my senses
Stay strong like old man in dentures
Winter time rockin' a fox, hangin' with Bruno Mars, The LOX
Sting, yo, Nas' pops
We gettin' honies, Rat Pack clique in my gunny
Blowin' two Ls, Ocean Eleven this money
Floss stays coolin' on them horses
Hoppin' over logs, long Polo boots, ownin' them Porsches
Maxin' king, everything' Gucci
Just like the suits I play Saturday to stay in Jacuzzis
Brother Man, I'm floatin' to mother lands
And came back with ounces of gold, wrapped inside rubber bands
Hangin' in McCormick & Schmitz
Doin' my OG thing, slangin' some 'caine in the mix

[Chorus: Altrina Renee]
I'll be flying to the islands when it's cold outside
Matching furs, his and hers, got matchin' black cars
On my life, livin' right, baby, love is no limit
Life's good either way, 'long as you in this

[Verse 2: AZ]
Uhh, from bullet holes and graffiti
Bein' low to exposin' money rolls on the TV
Clothes on neatly, cologne switchin' weekly
Women chose, now need to be told how to treat me
Discreetly, used to dick 'em down just for GP
Freaky, now I worth a fortune on Phoebe's
Easy, went from 22s on the shoes
And just chill with the factory feel, I'm still cool
Refuel, fresh from the era, Lo-sweater, cold weather
Used to beef if Ra' or Kane flow better
Forever, Larry Davis live, be obliged
For those broads bein' blessed to absorb a nigga vibe
Reside, in various places
Some spacious, others is basic
But the face lift, escalates it
Persuasive, polly with many, but not friendly
Cop Balenci', fly Versa' and rock Fendi
And he, came from the bottom, no problem
Nothin' surprise me, niggas try but can't size him
Possum, me and the missus, gourmet dishes
Instagramin' our pictures under chandelier fixtures
Scriptures, script from the heart
My pit's dark, chess players keep what I peep, I pick apart
My wiz is sharp, wine and dine when it's time
Line for line, leavin' that crime shit behind
The world is mine, suited and booted, so secluded
Leaving 'em clueless, this is how thorough niggas do this.. huh
Quiet Money, Ice Water

[Chorus: Altrina Renee]
I'll be flying to the islands when it's cold outside
Matching furs, his and hers, got matchin' black cars
On my life, livin' right, baby, love is no limit
Life's good either way, 'long as you in this
