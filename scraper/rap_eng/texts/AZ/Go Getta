Probably catch me in the club with some bad bitches
I remember nights when I didn't have bitches
I remember days when I didn't have riches
I'm in the club now, champagne spilling
I'm in the club now, I'm a big spender
Ice on my neck and diamonds on my suspenders
I'm no beginner, my ex girl, she keep calling me, tripping
But I keep tryna tell her that I'mma stay pimping
I bought a cream Bentley, black Lamborghini
Three or four houses, 15 Henneys
I'm a boss, pretty lady, you wanna roll with them dollar signs, baby
Go getta, I'm a go getta, I'm a go getta
I'm a go getta, I'm a go getta, go getta
Go getta, yeah
I'm a go getta, I'm a go getta
I'm a go getta, I'm a go getta

I'm in my condo downtown with a girl that a flew in from out of town
Drop the top, now we cruising around town
1 o'clock, we hit the club and go shut it down
See, I don't mean to make you feel like you're a rebound
But girl I fly you in and fly you out right back of town
You flying out while another girl is flying in
At 9 o'clock the pimping begins again
Why wouldn't it? Chickless never, sickest ever
Fuck the climate where you sit, I could switch the weather
