[Intro: AZ]
Yeah, nah I'm comin' through, you know what it is
C'mon baby, cut it out, listen
Get yourself together
Gonna have some fun, ya heard

[Verse 1: AZ]
The Louies is on, the sweaters is knitted
The skully's like a fitted, the leather, forget it, haha
For the cheddar, whoever can get it
With that 40 cal. was like now, whatever I'm with it (woo!)
Low-key in that SUV
'Cause when you all star-studded, they won't let you be
When all ya cars is buttered with accessories
It's unnecessary for extra G, shit
I'm so anal how the chain dangle
How it sparkle like the star bangle, believe I'm Allah's angel
The God came through to claim his queen
She mean, hard body in Cavalli jeans, a dream
In rare form, those who stare is the norm
I was there, damn near in the wrong but now I'm here, yeah
So miss lady in ya crispy Mercedes
Park it up 'cause once I'm there we Swayze, c'mon, c'mon

[Chorus: Jaheim]
I got, dressed up to impress you
Yes I'm, strapped up to protect you, then
Everybody fall back
(We're goin' out tonight)
I just, took some money out my bank account
Gonna wipe the truck down right in front of the house
Babe be ready
'Cause we goin' out tonight, ah yeah

[Verse 2: AZ]
So, pretty you, pretty face, pretty do (pretty do)
Pedicure, manicure, pretty shoe (pretty shoe)
I realize right now that you really boo
You so kind, at the same time you silly too
I can see us at the Trump with the city view
Top floor, eatin' brunch like the Willies do
So why front, I ain't never gettin' rid of you
I could stunt, you the truth in the physical
You independent too, secure, and you into school
It's clear I'm a criminal, but you there subliminal
Ya bamboo Zinfandels can do's
And slow jams, I'ma see you 'round two, goddamn

[Chorus: Jaheim]
I got, dressed up to impress you
Yes I'm, strapped up to protect you, then
Everybody fall back
(We're goin' out tonight)
I just, took some money out my bank account
Gonna wipe the truck down right in front of the house
Babe be ready
'Cause we goin' out tonight, ah yeah

[Verse 3: AZ]
We celebratin', we deserve to be watched
Then you could, smell the hatin' when we turn on the block
And without, reservations we reservin' a spot
That's how the heavyweights do it, I'm a '88 student
So, no offense that the windows is tint
But when you Willie you just give 'em a glimpse, let them admire
As the sillouettes reflect from the tires, they'll know
It's nothin' less, but respect for the driver, we low
So, understand this wasn't part of the plan
See usually we do a movie, I do me, and I scram
But damn, you so addictive, so submissive
Sorta sassy, but different than other bitches, word

[Chorus: Jaheim]
I got, dressed up to impress you
Yes I'm, strapped up to protect you, then
Everybody fall back
(We're goin' out tonight)
I just, took some money out my bank account
Gonna wipe the truck down right in front of the house
Babe be ready
'Cause we goin' out tonight, ah yeah
