[Intro: AZ]
Yeah... poet, politician, playa when necessary
This is AZ, I'm your host for the evening
It's Magic Hour... how we gonna do this?

[Verse 1: AZ]
No stress, we on the sands in Tahiti
Bare chest, you bastards, 30 grand on the pinky
Respect, finesse movements like your hands in grafitti
Grey Goose, mixed with grape, cran and the kiwi
It's truth holds galore, rose gold, clothes galore
Take paper 'til they close the door
Either or, corner hustle or hustle on tour
To seen it all, nothing left but to stumble no more
And the sex is phantasm
Flow, campaigns 'em
Dough, can't change 'em
Courts, can't arraign 'em
It's sports, Titanium quartz, Iranian taught
I came to enforce, all the bangers is brought
Brought the bang at your fort, torch and tangle your thoughts
Scorch and stand if you're short, so of course
Just to chill and conversate, kneel and salaam alaik
Millions I'm trying to chase, illin' from out the gate
Get it right my feelings is not awake
Ducatti bikes, shipped from out of state
The pressure is on, the blunts is lit
My presence is strong, it's real I'm amongst the mix
The Wesson is long, I move like I'm on some shit
So testin' is wrong cause once guns is drawn, that's it
The beats the rap the game is done
We leave, we at, we smack, we bang them guns
We beat with bats, we scrap, we came, we come
So, peace to that he's back nigga, one...

[Interlude: C.L. Smooth]
Yea, Chairman of the Board, man
Black Leader, the Mecca Don
El Presidente... Ladies and Gentlemen

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
All I do is bring the life to a dead game the moment I came
Under my umbrella, my flag, my name
If the ship leaving the port, cruise to the resort
You can't be serious baby, this is sport
Gotta make my rounds, head wolf of this pack
Till it's me an A' steppin' out of both sides of that Maybach
We can eat lovely, just don't interrupt me
And mix all this checkmate with that quiet money
I can see it all bubblin' the move is no troublin'
I'mma give you the plug and the Sosa
They all love CL, no jail for homey
Only gotta tell me one time, don't fuck me Tony
Just buy weight fly straight and keep me right
And I don't care what I spend on security
It helps me sleep at night
See nothing sharp as me
You take it in air, you can't compare
To the initials engraved in my office chair
The boss is here, we deep in the game
You can't do it the same
You gotta bring a strong leash for your dame or pop up
Speaking of cheddar, me and son peak it together
Can't feel it's the real deal or let the meatballs meet the Beretta
Smellin' like fresh cut leather
Odd color called sarsaparilla
The curtain is drawn the seat's vanilla
Let him see heat forever
Taking that seat empowers
All you want in this Magic Hour
