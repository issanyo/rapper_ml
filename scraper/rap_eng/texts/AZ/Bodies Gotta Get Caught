Play time's over lime green rover
Even after Remi still seems I'm sober
My cream got lower them things got colder
Ever since the last thing I caught in October
June's now here move around where
Parts of D.C what ya'll doin down there
Dough gotta get flipped who gotta get hit
Got a lot of work can't let shit sit
I know down there it's slow down there
Everything's double I can blow down there
Next flight out I'mma jet right out
Got the white floating on the 95 south
See y'all soon it'll be around noon
And y'all know a nigga style I'mma leave y'all room
Dressed in old clothes step on no toes
Money over bitches sexxin no hoes
It's shit like that'll make you slip like that
Crossed all up and get you hit like that
The game ain't fair names ain't clear
Everybody wanna hustle it's a shame I swear

Chorus:
Bodies Gotta get caught (Niggas gotta die)
Everybody wanna shit talk (Why niggas gotta lie?)
Somebody gotta get scorched (Niggas gone fry)
It's time niggas get taught (Stop gettin high)
(repeat)

Ain't no rules no more nobody's cool no more
But I ain't never give a fuck so screw y'all all
Love to ball since school got moves and all
Sweet J's three play I abuse the floor
And there's certain niggas now I refuse to call
Swtiching up on the cards only confused them all
You got blocks go head move that wall
Like to break shit down I give em two for four
I'mma get my run few trips I'm done
Wanna fuck but the work can't mix wit fun
See the shit don't stop till I'm sittin on top
And ain't nuttin like floating through picking up knots
Y'all know that vibe a nigga's soul done died
Play the board till the lord above close my eyes
It's real like that why I feel like that
Couldn't understand til I had to conceal a ghat
But SOS don't play it goes both ways
And we love hittin corners just like roach spray

Chorus

So if you love yourself you won't cross my path
I gasoline niggas up and torch they ass
40 yards from the field goal caught the pass
While you fumble shit knocked off half ya stash
Had to be your work I see your hurt
But any fool on the street gotta eat first
I earnt that right i've turnt out nights
Just now taking time out to learn about life
It's more wise to it like why did I do it
Why if I do it y'all would die if I use it

Chorus 2x
