[Intro: AZ]
Fuck outta here man
Certified shit to the death
Y'all know who I be
Rep that real shit...

[Verse 1: AZ]
In G-mode, a genius, Giants fan, no jewelry
Drove it all maturely, close the malls in Missouri
Popped off in a drop Porsche, no sorts of security
At the Waldorf with a sawed-off, I floss deliberately
Loved lyrically, ne-ar nigga could mirror me, vividly
Regardless who he appear to be
Pure sanity, puffing, pumping that Amerie
Self portraits painted over the canopy
Nothing was handed me, can it be? It's like Vanity
Pushing them Europeans, kush on the Caribbeans
Ran with the demons, low for understandable reasons
Silent lambs, it's Hannibal season, ha
Still breathing, Brooklyn be my garden of Eden
Chasing paper, please pardon my speeding
Venisons is not needed, the penthouse, (?) repeated
Been about it, niggas gotta believe it, so leave it
From the ghetto to the manicure, fresh green meadows
Where you can spot 'em in them red bottom stilettos, hello

[Chorus: June Summers]
Nothing move but the money
Puffing cigars, I'll buy a pool where it's sunny
Couple of America's next top
Both got bodies with bottoms and no tops
Bottles that go, pop
Nothing move but the money, watch my moves
I'm too smooth to hear it coming, respect my mood
(Don't) disrespect my groove
Homie I'm that dude

[Verse 2: AZ]
As long as the universal laws of life is obeyed
The sea breeze and the palm trees come with the shade
Tipsy off the Dom P since under the age
So originally it was on me, I numbered the days
Doe or Die was in my heart, had to humble my ways
You know either you play your part or you running astray
Some'll say seek and you shall find
My first peek at a Porsche, nearly lost my mind
Ski resorts still in thought, never off my grind
Til the casket get dropped, put my ashes in a box
Last shot, if it pop, it's that national love
Was certified what I was with half the buzz
This is drugs, flowing through the Pro Tools set
Two stepping on the track, I ain't old school yet
Stay repping what I rap, I'm a coastal threat
So just crown a nigga king, got my balance on the beam
I'ma fiend for that cream and that faith unseen
I embrace for me to do my thing (thing..)

[Chorus: June Summers]
Nothing move but the money
Puffing cigars, I'll buy a pool where it's sunny
Couple of America's next top
Both got bodies with bottoms and no tops
Bottles that go, pop
Nothing move but the money, watch my moves
I'm too smooth to hear it coming, respect my mood
(Don't) disrespect my groove
Homie I'm that dude

[Bridge: June Summers]
I'm amazing, another success story in the making
From the hard knock school of education
To the hard blocks doing what I'm making
Even if I had to take it
I'm amazing, my life would be a best selling publication
For inspiration, because I made it
The way that I did it, the life that I live is so amazing

[Verse 3: AZ]
I love the feeling of a fresh pair, cologne in the air
Made it here to the next year, Coronas of beer
Where I appear no respects there, grown ups is here
I wear the hats that the Mets wear, I'm known for the gear
Never fear, this is Hip-Hop, hustle or die
On the beach chair with flip-flops and trunks in Dubai
Who am I? The kid with the coke on the street
That did a somersault dive and backstroked on a beat
I know beef, when applied it's like elephant weight
My intelligence is vast, it's like measuring space
I'm in a place only few really reach and enjoy
Street scholar, holla at your boy (boy..)

[Chorus: June Summers]
Nothing move but the money
Puffing cigars, I'll buy a pool where it's sunny
Couple of America's next top
Both got bodies with bottoms and no tops
Bottles that go, pop
Nothing move but the money, watch my moves
I'm too smooth to hear it coming, respect my mood
(Don't) disrespect my groove
Homie I'm that dude
