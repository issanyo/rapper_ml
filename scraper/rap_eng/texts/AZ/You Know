[Chorus: Rell]
You know that I know
That his flow is so-so
And I ain't saying I'm a player
But I'm a man with mo' class
And I ain't trying to be no hater
But he ain't got no cash

[Verse 1: AZ]
You know he hustle, so he's trouble
All he see is he can free fuck you, feed you junk food
It's just that kiddie shit them punks do, the one two
Dine at the hotel they humped and dumped you
Minors I know well, you something to run through
Vagina is wholesale, ain't nothing but young dudes
Bottle here, bottle over there
Lou bracelet, bings and things bling in they ear for stare
Boys footwear, jeans hundred a pair
With me, that's not a person you really wanna compare
Came from it, stunt it, done it for years
Drained from it, got a stomach from beer
I do better, investing a little cheddar
And all linen resorting in swimming pool weather
So come with me, have some fun with me
So I can let more than just the sun hit me

[Chorus: Rell]
You know that I know
That his flow is so-so
And I ain't saying I'm a player
But I'm a man with mo' class
And I ain't trying to be no hater
But he ain't got no cash

[Verse 2: AZ]
Cars the minimum, spar with Rakim and them
The God, in jailyards, I'm way larger than Eminem
Loved on the East coast, cop the 12 with the seats coached
Keep close, there's more to it than just a mink coat
So act right and move up the list
And if you eating red meat, switch up to fish
Your jeans got nice fit, your ass the right width
All you need is a villa, Marquis and the white six
And that can happen 'fore the month is out
I can see you up in Manhattan, jumping out
Tits is perked and your cake is fat
The Ace is back, and haters need to face the facts
There's no snow but Santa is near
The hammers is here, the princess and the band is clear
You been around but no one like me
A John Singleton, young Spike Lee, I'll make ya famous

[Chorus: Rell]
You know that I know
That his flow is so-so
And I ain't saying I'm a player
But I'm a man with mo' class
And I ain't trying to be no hater
But he ain't got no cash

[Verse 3: AZ]
So it's now or never, let's pow-wow, whatever
Beach towels, feet out, fly down together
Either that or I leave now if it's better
Why beat around and lecture, be the clown that sweats ya
I'm just trying to hear the sounds selector
Have you lounge with Dexter, get from 'round them stressers
Here's your chance to Aladdin or the lamp
Loser or the champ the Franklins or the food stamps
Talk to me

[Chorus: Rell]
You know that I know
That his flow is so-so
And I ain't saying I'm a player
But I'm a man with mo' class
And I ain't trying to be no hater
But he ain't got no cash

[Bridge: Rell]
Rock with me
Baby take a chance and let me show you how it should be
Rock with me
Baby here's your chance, come take a ride with Rell and AZ

[Chorus: Rell]
You know that I know
That his flow is so-so
And I ain't saying I'm a player
But I'm a man with mo' class
And I ain't trying to be no hater
But he ain't got no cash
