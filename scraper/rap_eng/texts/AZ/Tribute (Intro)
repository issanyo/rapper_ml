[Intro]
Haha, decade and some change later
I'm still here
Said I was washed up
Well I, I am fresh, haha

[Verse]
15th anniversary, taught patience
Corks pop like it's New Year's in animation
Talk stops when I enter New York locations
I'm like (?) sedatin'
Laminatin' off skin tone alone
Hands embracin', feel, I'm still in the zone
Emancipation, proclamation
Patron
Everybody ain't free, but everybody ain't me, huh
Yeah, I'm a mic fighter, night rider
Herm√®s head instead used to like Prada
A lot of, lost souls untold
Unfold, see my name in the scrolls
Lights, cameras, stars, glitz and glamour
Cigars, green jars, European cars bananas
And I, live a life so real
Upright, so chill, got a psycho feel
Still, build with my a-alikes
Chef meals, chicks in heels, she can stay the night
Say it right, official nigga rap shit
Re-flipped, a tribute to my classic...

[Outro]
Yeah, we celebratin'
Achievement, success
The art of wealth
See y'all suckers 15 years more from, ya dig?!
Hahahahahaha...
