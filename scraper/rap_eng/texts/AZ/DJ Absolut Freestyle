[Intro]
Yeah, and I say New York City
Y'all know what it is
It's AZ, with the youngin in charge
Ayo Abso, this here's a go

[Verse]
Smell the exotic cologne in the air
Beach chairs near the grill, chill, Coronas of beer
Conceal firearms, grown ups is here
Prada don, got a closet full, could loan you pair
It's presence, certified if ya story is true
I'm from the essence, speaks from a warrior's view
Since adolescent, seen the system slaughter my crew
Guess this is destined, dance stance is like Kostya Tszyu
Did a Gallardo, aqua blue
Rocked spots with Big Pop', was unstoppable
From hot blocks to the tropicals
From bullet wounds straight to ICU
Don't even sneeze near me
He ain't a killer homie, he's scary
Without his crew the nigga seem leery
Where the vibe at?
All the cars and the live cats
You see the squad, nigga slide back, the God symbolize rap
Ratchets blowin', caskets closin'
You bastards get rich is only half the slogan
It's mastered, muh'fuckas tryin' to fast me forward
From the streets to the nastiest poet, and y'all know it
