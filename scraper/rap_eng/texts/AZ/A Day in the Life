[Verse 1: AZ]
Splitting a dutch on the roll over, the show's over
Bipolar so she might get the cold shoulder, I'm a soldier
Greeted born black-hearted undefeated
Taught to squeeze it 'til the last conscious
That's how you squash shit, killer so I can't return
But main problem do the knowledge still standing firm
And [?] got the cave but a few acres
Armani shades, tapered fade, I'm a move maker
New paper, pleasure is the main focus
Goose feathers in the leather I exchange with [?]
Double doses of 80 proof but [?]
Baby coupes in the booth it's what AZ do
Dictator, chick slayer
And flip Mos see your hoes in the mix later
It get greater, calculate add subtract
The math you hate motherfuckers, the dragon is back

[Hook: Macie Stewart]
I'll stay
Come what may
Won't let nothing get in my way
I say it's just a day in the life

[Verse 2: Havoc]
It started way back, back in nine zero
Before the money waiting for the boogers in my earlobe
Fully by the benches, the wards trying to give bust
The gang stopped a nigga from coming outside pimped up
Naw, you ain't hear that crap? It's coming from the stomach
Gotta hustle while we love it
The macho on the wall in my room in red, fuck it
Have fiends in there smashed with the Bobby Jaw bucking
Hand to hand pending felonies but kept pumping
Kept a bitch on her knees in love with the [Hustlin'?]
Fuck you can tell me 'bout guap
Been getting money since the wop
You was in the co-op snot-nosed under your mom's ass
Momma's boy we was cooking in pyrex glass
Fifty Gs under the mattress, a heart thrill
Opened up a barber shop to wash my bills

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freeway]
L. Pridgen'll melt drippin' the bell with 'em
I just picked it up and dropped it off, counted it and locked the safe
I'm cautious so I [?] the place
Had to Glock the waist in case a hater try to knock me off
I was learned to shoot first, the coupe worth
Ten to twenty [?] in ten
I break from my heroin connect 'cause he there again
We go around and around like a ferris wheel
Scrambling just to get a check
Cops yelling checkmate
They lock my nigga Little, my nigga Toast, my nigga Eyes
They reside in that [?] place
Sad place to vacate
I'm killing shit so they gon' be straight when they vacate the premises
I'm independent means I'm all about my spinach
But my dollars told me Jeezy trying to holler with the businesses
I only deal with real niggas that build and
Know about making a couple million, no benefits
The point is they been afraid, I been a threat
Since I was a prospect been a North Philly kid
From the city where they got them small blocks
But they feel me in the large box, feel me in they projects

[Hook]
