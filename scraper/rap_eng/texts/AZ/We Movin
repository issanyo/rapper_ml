[Verse 1]
Fresh fruits out the juicer
Since juvie jail taught well, I'm a trooper
If she can tell it's a Louie smell I can scoop her
In a black-bluish SL, bumpin' Luther
Saint Lucia, linen shorts and loafs
Been across the coast, contenders call me the GOAT, haha
Why grope, when women open their throats
Sophisticated adults with stimulatin' results, the Sos'
Still afloat, still a mil' in the vault
Still appeal to the real when it's wrote
Proper approach, I play
Check the resume, fuck what a record say
Only a few certified can really rep this way
Chick fetish, a baller, them bricks bet it
No daughters, the dick's leveraged
It's nothin' to discredit, embedded
Born with it, my vision was all vivid
I'm livin', the Lord did it, decisions is more digits
More explicit, more deliberate
More extraordinaire, so what is it?
Son of a snorter, my aura is Diadora
Extortin' can lead to slaughter, a quarter is deeper waters
Seekin' Kimora, speak sweet sephora
Too neat to loiter, too at peace for fraudure
I applaud ya, if all the pressure ain't dogged ya
Broads tryin' to destroy ya, whores of the Pandora
On camcorder caught with a gram shorter
Mandatory five that's when Yam was alive, that's my word

[Verse 2]
Reckless endangerment, necklace insane and shit
Give her no dick, that's how you really restrain a bitch
I'm the Hussein of this, rap foolish fugazziness
Fairy-tale spittin' that others claim niggas crazy with
Up in Mercedes whips, new Gucci blue-navy kicks
Hair wavy, stay fly on that 80's tip
What can they say to diss?
Let 'em pray and wish, at any minute a nigga could 100k the wrist
Slight lisp, but speak truth, the Greek Zeus
All I do is just fuck, nut and eat fruit
From recoups to Venezuela, send the tailor
It's all done for the century servers in the cellar
Hey fella, only few can measure
Takin' paper is pleasure, they imitation vanilla
The arm legger, arm head, with Don cred
I'm no wannabe wack rap non-celeb...

[Verse 3]
From Magic City to Miss America pageants
Got me passin' on pussy never imagined
In suites crashin', eatin' felipes laughin'
Sneaker freak, keep up with feet fashion
They keep askin', how is his shine lastin'?
I'm too ahead of my time to be a has-been
Rhymes craftin' come from crime interaction
So niggas spazzin' is just a minor distraction
Dinner napkins tucked in the button-up
Which means any medallion that's dangling's covered up
Sleeves cuffed, sippin' a tea cup
MC money's like key money when re-in up...
