Mm

It's that shit right here
It's that big boy music!
Yahmean?

Thinkin of a masterplan me and my man
Hand to hand on the grind since a half a gram
Understand even then you couldn't pass me hand
Was on the land all geared up in Dapper Dan
Around the year of them classic jams
I done seen niggas get bitch slapped and ran
Word to yam a few got rich and swam
While I was sunk with they G packs trying to pump
It's over, no closure cars gave niggas exposure
I was carried by Allah on his shoulders
Sober my first AR in the hood
Would of stuck a muhfuckin Brinks truck if I could
Understood I was strong headed
But them streets and them guns gave me the wrong fetish
Cool whatever, I'm here we can do whatever
From the cars to clothes to the jewels whatever
Why worry? I'll rest when I'm dead and buried
So for now I'mma dress, get head and be merry
(Muthafuckers)

My minds still in the grind you wouldn't understand
It's been a long time since we was going hand to hand
When the block was too hot we had the look out man
Playing the corners to warn us soon as he saw the blue van

Plans to conquer the street
Branded in my head like the mark of the beast
My knowledge so ominous I plot in my sleep
When I eat my niggas eat
We take the bitter with the sweet
If I die few'll cry, less'll do a bid with me
Once intrigued with money and fast cars
Stubbornly I sold crack to my mans moms
Suddenly it troubles me so I asked God
Forgiveness for pasts wrongs and future sins
Presently the coop I'm in
View as heavenly as the roof ascends
Like Vince Carter I'm too intense
For dudes defense to stop me I abuse the rim
Anybody can ball I do it to win
Son it's Doe Or Die, all that other shit aside
Any sign of betrayal my nine'll improvise
I spit the sickest rhymes
Daydream of getting mines
Fuck scales and just as I ?tri-beamed to digitize?
Pure white perrico I cooked over a greasy stove
From Brooklyn to Queens to O-T
With keys I sold in a V
So cold when I hit the street many people froze
My team deaded the block till it decomposed
And was under our complete control to each his own
I don't sleep on niggas in the street no mo
Cause when shit hit the fan even Nino told
