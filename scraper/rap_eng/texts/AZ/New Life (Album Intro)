[Nina Simone]
Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Reeds driftin' on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, yes
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me

[Verse 1: AZ]
Play the game for my people stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision focused, get wise, and largen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark that's unseen
Caught inbetween, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be keen, from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first, get bent nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I realize I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish minds design tricks, leave you blind quick
Cause you to die behind shit
Mathematic, Master one twenty, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic, cuz it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game
Love the Nightrain, found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, It's all a race to the top
Tryin' to freeze time, that's why I ice the face of my watch
