[Intro]
Yes, yes, Quiet Money Record, you didn't know
And I am the Alpha/Omega
No beginning, no ending
The past present and the future
Fresh on the market
I can feel this one in my bones

[Refrain]
This is all, I want or need, you feelin me
Like this and that, no strings attached
I don't want, relationship, I can hang out with
Doin this or that, with no strings attached

[AZ]
This is, bachelor heaven, got beats on the back of the 7
License plate, yeah life is great
No swine, I'm in a viceless state
Tryin to, slow grind like I'm pricin weight
So welcome, sexy halves they can't help 'em
Ain't no dream that these Ikes sell 'em, where the shorties at
Got the condoms and the 40 packed
Got the condo and the cognac, tints on the Pontiac
Party night, Pucker and Bacardi light
Get it nice then fuck her on the Harley bike
Get it right, she chose to expose her life
No proposal, she social but cold as ice

[Refrain]

[AZ]
Now, peep game, peep how she speaks her name
She claims, she was the key to Alicia's fame
She's vain, a Tyra Bank look-alike
Top Model, you can tell that she took advice
Perfect form when the shoe match the purse it's warm
You do doo-rags, don't flirt too long, she's fierce
Three karats up in both ears
And a push button E class buggy that control gears
No care, all in her zone
She like Cher when her hair is grown and don't cut it
She used to niggas frontin in public, try and impress
Tryin D just to see if she'll freak out in sex
Wifey type though she like like a Nike stripe
To +Just Do It+ it's the mood that she move with
Fun is fun, when it's done it's done
If you sprung you sprung but homey one is ONE

[Refrain]

[AZ]
So if your, G is tight and your paper's long
Your cape is on, she's there with that Grey Poupon
It's nothin, pass that with the Louis on the knapsack
It's like a movie, hear the booty with a backslap
Let her know that love is felt
The roughness helped, but she was still above the belt
I'm comfy, just in case niggas wan' bump me
Or her ex wanna come hunt me, it holds me down
I love when we stroll the town, hittin up spots
So fly when we side to side, sittin in drops
It's special, what next, chick you know what Lex do
Kidnap her when she just met you

[Refrain]

[Outro]
Yes, c'mon (bounce bounce, bounce bounce)

[Refrain]
