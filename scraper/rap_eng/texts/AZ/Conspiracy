Good morning ladies and gentleman
And welcome to today's seminar entitled Conspiracy Theory
Where the focus will be conspiracy itself
And today's special guest speaker is legendary lyricist AZ
Ever since society's inception there has been a hierarchy where in which you have
The inclusive and the exclusive
And today he will be expounding on the two entities
Of the included and those of us who are excluded

Sky high gas prices another housing unit being built right in Rikers they opportunists
Society don't like us we like mutants
What happened to the dark cyphers the loves lost
Neighborhood street wars
Scientist manipulating G-4's we not alone
Hurricanes cyclones bomb threats suicide on the Whitestone I palm tecs
Straight from the heart of the hood but overstood
Played my part til I'm parted it should but meant good
Move by the moss(?) and the morns metamorphosis
Offered me optional doors I wanted in
With the wild life wanted to blend but then again
With them satellites they sucking us in we being tracked
So many got chips in they back they blindfold
Me I'm trying to run that victory lap and find codes
Cursed with that ESP I seen they hold papa for a PS3 so is it me
Or majority wanna be slaves
They don't wanna behave but they wanna be saved praise the Lord
Moving on they own accord too content to implement a sharp in they sword so all aboard
Bruised by the height of recession hunger scarce in fears by the vice and infections
I'm aware of the war going on this world we can't escape from
We can run but we can't hide forever
Its deep the system got the masters asleep
Religion mean to rely on they supply and deceit they putting chemicals in food we eat
Polluting the waters it cause slaughter to sheep we the meek
And money ain't worth what its printed on
I'm posted at the Sprint store trying to put minutes on
Its flying(?) on the same line I'm trying to do business on
I guess they applying what they learned from the Pentagon

Fuck out of here...
