[Intro: AZ]
Yeah, some Firm shit, you know what I mean?
For all the niggas, in New York all across the motherfuckin' world
Ain't nothin' changed yet, shit's still real

[Refrain]
Yo, major large niggas get they grind on cash
While the crab thinkin' niggas keep they mind on ass
I guess most motherfuckers ain't designed to last
Whatever happened to the realness from back in the past [x3]

[Verse 1: AZ]
You know the routine; fast cars, rings, get a crew scene
We true fiends, old-school style, that's how we do things
Born and destined, hands on many investments
Strong, reflect this 'til I'm drawn back to the essence
Street wise, 36 waist, small feet size
The C.I.'s quick to slide off once the heat rise
Detour, poverty zone, police war
Going through each dawn, searchin' new ways for me to eat more
Fast learner, Quiet Storm, play the back burner
Bureaucrats, I react like Nat Turner
Hold weight, used to rock kicks with no lace
Fuck a soul mate, low heart pace, pulse at a slow rate
Runnin' rapid, while others play as if they captive
Brain's inactive, bein' subjected to this crab shit
To each his own, fuck the foulness, need a week alone
We can zone all day long on the speaker phone
600, nine-five North, stay blunted, stress, I came from it
Sex got drained from it
The new breed star gazin', raisin' two seeds
To be free, the franchise is all a whole crew need, indeed

[Partial Refrain]

[Verse 2: RZA]
Whips and full clips and pussy lips, rubber grips attached to hips
Past the journey to the crib, the purest sickness curer
Holy Quran Sura, leaves man to understand, I stand up a rough briva
Heart is bleedin', stress got my hair line receedin'
God look we feedin', leadin' my seeds back to Eden
And stay suspicious of promiscuous bitches
Who don't wash and do dish and too big for your britches
Lustin' riches, fuckin' the next man mistress
You wonder why your pussy itches
Fat ass sample without the glitches
Shatter your mental, split your bean up like a lentel
Disfigure your face you recognize him by the dental
Hot lead from raw heat, left in store meat
Lay it out on Broadstreet, before he
Left all he heard was the echo from the shot
Cops autopsy revealed he was stopped by the Glock
Devils lettin' off SCUDS, thugs trapped up in HUD houses
New York been infested by Bloods, lusting for colors of red
More black lies done shed through
Yet the blood travelin' through veins remain blue
Boned out until we zone out, no doubt
Chicken-heads beg for the nine-inch applehead
Their legs open like Fallopian, lubricated by petroleum
Nine months later comes the ovary explosion
Bitch you stupid, a hundred dollars you couldn't recoup it
When I reign the truth on your brain, you mute it
Ruler Zig-Zag, Zig Allah, plus Allah Zig, Zag-Zig
We addin' more knowledge to your wig

[Refrain]

[AZ and RZA]
Word up, word up
Yeah, Wu-Tang, Firm up in this piece know what I mean
Holdin' it down, stamp of approval, you know
Get ya brain washed, you know what I'm sayin'
Get your muscle tendered and straight
No doubt, no doubt
Word up, the black God exists in the physical form, you know
The Firm baby, holdin' this, A to the Z, I know what time it is
Aight, Armageddon
