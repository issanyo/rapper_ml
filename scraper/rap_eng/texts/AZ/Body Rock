[Intro: AZ]
I like this
Check it baby
Tell yo friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
We can do dis every weekend

[Chorus: Dwele]
Get yo team, get yo flock, get yo body rock, ah!
Tell yo girls not to stray 'cause my crew on the way
And they all wanna body rock, pimpin' for days
They don't wanna play with you ladies
What you say?
Get yo team, get yo flock, get yo body rock, ah!
Tell yo girls not to stray 'cause my crew on the way
And they all wanna body rock, pimpin' for days
They don't wanna play with you ladies
What you say?

[Verse 1: AZ]
Neon strobes, we on vogue














[Chorus: Dwele]
Get yo team, get yo flock, get yo body rock, ah!
Tell yo girls not to stray 'cause my crew on the way
And they all wanna body rock, pimpin' for days
They don't wanna play with you ladies
What you say?
Get yo team, get yo flock, get yo body rock, ah!
Tell yo girls not to stray 'cause my crew on the way
And they all wanna body rock, pimpin' for days
They don't wanna play with you ladies
What you say?

[Verse 2: Twista]
What you see a playa pull up in the Jag' or the Range or the drop top Benz it's like: ugh ugh
She'll holla at a nigga in a minute 'cause she know she gotta get up in it



















[Chorus: Dwele]
Get yo team, get yo flock, get yo body rock, ah!
Tell yo girls not to stray 'cause my crew on the way
And they all wanna body rock, pimpin' for days
They don't wanna play with you ladies
What you say?
Get yo team, get yo flock, get yo body rock, ah!
Tell yo girls not to stray 'cause my crew on the way
And they all wanna body rock, pimpin' for days
They don't wanna play with you ladies
What you say?
