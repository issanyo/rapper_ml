[Scratches in the intro and Chorus by Pete Rock]
[A sample of the Onyx classic "Slam" is heard in the background of the intro and the Chorus]

[Intro: Pete Rock]
Rock the house (rock the house...)
East New York, East New York
East New York, East New York
Uhh, East New York, East New York
East New York, East New-York
To my nigga AZ, hit it off

[Verse 1: AZ]
We was already molded into people's minds as mulignanes
Now we more fucks'd up with a mayor named Giuliani
You can try to blind me, analyze but can't define me
My mind's divine, heavily entwined with Gandhi's
Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through
'Cause my cerebrals are more of a higher plane than the Hebrews
My mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions
Overdosin' wannabes posin', sendin' them through convulsions
Too hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow
Your mind's boggled
But I'm as deep as Donald Goines novels
My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
And since a minor, I been fuckin' with marijuana
Wavy-hair, my skin got a money gettin' glare
Strictly menace wear, mackin' off a Guinness beer
So, where it all begins is here
Destiny and me finally meet
So, how can I be weak? I'm rather unique

[Refrain: Big Daddy Kane sample & Pete Rock]
Why, why, why I'm rather unique
So check it out why I'm rather unique
So check it out why, why, I'm rather unique
So check it out why I'm rather, rather rather unique
So check it out why I'm rather unique
Just check it out why I'm, why, why I'm rather unique
So check it out why, why, why I'm rather unique
AZ check him out, one time why, why, why I'm rather unique

[Verse 2: AZ]
My verbals rip shit, brains give birth to thoughts in triplets
Fuck it, I'm on some flip shit, ready to let my clip spit
Dramatical, vocals release shells like automatics do
Music's magical, causin' any battles to be tragical, child
Got a style sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia
Slaughter your circulatory like leukemia
Filled with larceny, who want parts of me? I'm vicious
Mad malicious 'cause it's real on this road to riches
I got this mastered, other rappers'll graft it, weak and wicked
Camouflagin' as killers; how they speak and kick it
Peep this uniqueness, non-believers I'm leavin' speechless
Left to choke as if skunk smoke was comin' through the speakers
Surgically nice with any verbal device
Trife, breathin' life into mics
My eyesight's beyond the twilight
So, die or fight, no surrender, no retreat
Techniques speak, I'm rather unique

[Refrain: Big Daddy Kane sample & Pete Rock]
So check it out why I'm rather unique
Uhh why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York why, why, I'm rather unique
Why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York why, why, I'm rather unique  why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York  why, why, I'm rather unique
My man AZ to the fullest

[Verse 3: AZ]
So, it's gonna take more than your astrologist to knowledge this
Physiologists couldn't even figure out the exoticness
Raps demolishin', certified the way I style it
My wordplay blaze with the rays of ultraviolet
My culture's smilin', gettin' more in depth with each breath
Autobiography follows the footsteps of Malcolm X
Money and sex, Gore-Tex, Donna Karan and Guess
Finesse, success through the life stress, mics I bless
Puffin' trees to get me high as trapeze
Lookin' Japanese, at ease when I'm stackin' G's
So, let's discuss, plus degrees
Why the rhyme force is the source for thoughts that's lost
So, don't cross 'cause it'll cost
The ghetto savior, smooth for real, playa with flavor
Moves be major, with un-explainable behavior
The word's on the street so keep your ears to the concrete
Why I'm rather unique

[Refrain: Big Daddy Kane & Pete Rock]
Why I'm rather unique

Check it out
Check it out

Check it out
Check it out
