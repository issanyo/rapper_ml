2000

Beef with us make y'all niggas wanna blast yourself
Is you niggas really real you should ask yourself
Niggas trying to play big willy can't afford it
The biggest of the biggest willies get extorted

Cannons are tucked where the nigga that we planning to rush
Heard up north he was soft niggas land in his butt
Damaged him up where his crutches standing him up
So what the fuck no he wish he never ran into us
Slam on his nuts beat him so they can't even bust
Juvenate all on his face after we damage him up
Heard you haters from the other side speaking my name
He ain't live he just a crab nigga weak in the game
Speaking in vein who got a gas beating his brain
It ain't done till we left him dead three in his frame
No disrespect my motherfucking nerves is wrecked
I get upset so when you fuck with me your work connect
Never forget I'm a vet plus a threat in this shit
Rest with the fish for faking trying to flex in the six
Freedom or hell these streets here is treating me well
So fuck a cell write the judge don't believe in the bail
You made your bed now lay in it so stay in it
This game ain't made for the lames to play in it

It's War motherfuckers wanna fuck with me
Y'all motherfuckers can't fuck with me
It's War mother fuckers wanna fuck with me
Y'all motherfuckers can't fuck with me

Bottles of Hen it's time these niggas die for they sins
Signs of revenge if they try it once they do it again
Nothing's live for the nine triple my mind's official
Besides I'm a nigga that would ride or die with you
Holding guns high with you load live with you
Attack back to back do a drive by with you
It's thug love, love for the streets love for the slugs
In love with the money but I'm loving the gloves
So bubble up double up you in trouble or what
Your brother do what your vest better cover you up
Time invested since nine five my motto's defected
Trying to connect it no swine my kind won't accept it
Double breast if my first breath born in deceit
Corner my beef we can get it on in the streets

It's War motherfuckers wanna fuck with me
Y'all motherfuckers can't fuck with me
It's War mother fuckers wanna fuck with me
Y'all motherfuckers can't fuck with me

Those hypnotic 98 clothes we throw in the garbage
I'm allotted while your flow is slow and robotic
Do the knowledge street scholar schooled in the projects
Life is dice so don't stop and think of any side bets
Surviving back in effect don't fly in
Yo would die again it's all for the hood got to win
So "The Streets Iz" some got game and sweet with it
I'm deep with it spitting this slang put you to sleep with it
A zigga for the fully to spray quicker
So play nigga right where you stand is where you lay nigga
