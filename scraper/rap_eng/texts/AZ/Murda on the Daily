[Verse 1: AZ]
Hold up
Murders on the daily,minors getting charged
[?],niggas trying not to starve
Death or the devil, I was dying to get large
Freshest in the borough kept the lamas in the car
Piranhas wasn't far putting ganja in cigars
Planned your [?], pray I don't go fool
Livest on the set,[?] like a jet
Who a threat, he a problem whole lobby getting stressed
Connects,directs,first flights out to Quebec,then hop right out on the next
TECs [?] they stare [?] let off a hundred rounds at the reggae splash
[?] fuck a pass, eating on [?] when niggas out
Whatever nigga doubt start fronting to figure out
Clout, separate certified from slouch and burglarizing the house that was murderizing [?]
Motherfuckers be out

[Verse 2: Cormega]
The situation is real
In jail you get mail, at home you get bills
The street is empty stomachs and clips filled
Unfamiliar faces recognize that love don't live here
Little niggas catching cases, guns blazing
An unexplained murder, label the drug related
Different races, a white cop takes information, a black woman crying waiting for an explanation
Near the store winnings by dominicans and asians
They owned by the dudes why is niggas such haters
The city never sleep cause shit is so crazy
An ugly gun fight hit a pretty young lady
Bittersweet relief, they say she gonna make it
Now niggas looking at very strong cases
My mind is a 9, I just let it off safety
And spit 16 nigga murda on the daily
