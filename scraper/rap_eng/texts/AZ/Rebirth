[Intro]
How can I be torn from the pages of history? Huh?
How can my name scraped off the pyramid walls
When I sat with Pharoahs and Kings?
You think you know, but you have no idea

[Verse 1]
This track's here it's like a breath of fresh air
That shaved through sunrays, families suffer on Sundays
Had to run astray, pack up and run away
Fountain of youth, found it, feel like the younger A
Make sure my son okay, shit, that's the mission
College tuition, hope he get accepted to Princeton
If not, got his bail for prison
I know the pressures of the oppressor, it's hell living
Feel like I'm Mel Gibson, killing 'em kindly finally
Niggas untied me mami, love the punani, but I
Can't make you my Bonnie never, made for the cold weather
Haters y'all know better
How can I fold? I was told to hold it together
Listen, no intermissions, I am, so in position, like, Ali and Liston
Who could. box me the distance? Try me
Not a police call, I give orders to creep on ya
I master the street corner,  relax in the feet sauna and
Fuck if y'all don't like it, I'm here and I'm shown niceness
Appear in my own likeness, I zone as my own psychic

[Verse 2]
Flow if a nigga's holding, my clothing'll get you open
I'm toasting in bitches posting, approaching with mixed emotions
And ready like military, y'all varied like Ben and Jerry's
Compare me to him is scary, I'm eerie as cemeteries
And losing is not inside me, stay moving from paparazzi
I'm proving the angels got me, I'm cool but my game is cocky
And money can never make me
My guns they don't come with safeties
I hung with the ones that's crazy, I come from the front of Macy's
And shopping and dropping eighties
Show stopping with proper ladies
I'm hearing a lot of maybe's, what nigga as hot as AZ?

[Outro]
Ha ha ha
Ayo it's a wrap baby, we got 'em right now
We going platinum man, 202k
Brooklyn, stand up!
