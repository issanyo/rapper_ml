[Intro]
Word up, right
I, I just be on some chill shit, man
I ain't even, can't be (?) shit, man
Just, just livin' life, yaknahmean

[Verse]
Peep the graphics, it's hand crafted
Jammin' the classics, this rap shit keep fans attracted
The black Ben Affleck
Fuck shades and fancy jackets
Just, jeans and J's, the hat be backwards
Came from, clappin' ratchets to rappin' immaculate
I happen to have it
The mannerisms, passion, the magic
My fabric, authentic, more eccentric
Raw, vintage, (?) shit, been deep since my entrance
Indented sentence, poetry erupts
With no incentive, show degrees of lust
Flow relentless, overseas a must to manifest my presence
The last of the legends
Signs of seven, my mind define heaven
My rhymes'll blind bredren, my shine times eleven
Crime spreadin', the poor they want more
Or they want war, you snore they hunt yours
Blunts tore, tobacco's tossed of course
The boss once more, no back and forth for shorts
I'm lost, big boys want them big toys
Want that big money, why wouldn't we live comfy
Ha, yeah, jewels is all chunky
Ha, I'm a hip-hop junkie
Niggas can't take it from me, can't give it
It's just how I live it, fuck outta here...

[Outro: scratches]
"Now it's about time to show you how it feels"
"Got my mind on this paper, paper chase"
"My name, my name is..", "AZ.."
"Like a roller coaster, street life'll comatose ya"
"Now it's about time to show you how it feels"
"Got my mind on this paper, paper chase"
"My name, name is..", "AZ.."
"Just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets"
"But look at me now..."
