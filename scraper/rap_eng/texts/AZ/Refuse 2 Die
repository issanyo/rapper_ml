[intro]
(pshhh pshhhh: puffing)
Its too much bruh i can't get it (?)
Its the life right here (haha)
I i used to say its like felony money
Misdemeanor crime, for sho

[verse 1]
Peace to the go-getters, they got it the flow-fibbers
All over the know-niggas, involved as the ho-hitters
At the Bellagio, blackjack, they blow figures
Petrone guzzlers, never no slow swiggers
Nigga, its just a part of the life
Like the billers up in the (?spraylers?), part of the sight
Pardon the plight i'm up right over the dome
Busy b just hit it three, lets welcome him home
Work alone is enough to stay with your thoughts
If you a boss, be a boss, don't play with remorse
The lay with the sauce, the greens with the corn on the side
(?slug prize?) still alive i was born to survive

[bridge]
You know what i mean
We got the cars, the women, its the life right here baby
See i was told that, the weak was frowned upon
You get to swimmin' you drown
I'm swimming baby, all the way

[verse 2]
Dollar signs blind got a column by mine
Out to find what is crime i'm the homicide kind
With a five time nine i design niggas' shrines
So respect a nigga grind and just let a nigga shine
Look the no line but you're chick-a co-sign
Every brick being flipped, bitch it's (?mikelo?) time
I'm sick of pole nines sick of switching phone lines
Twice in the mixture took pictures both times
Hold mines from the ever or (?tever?) or fly nor (?mever?)
Smoke more high more better, more cheddar
Yes the truth is I, two letters AZ i refuse to die

[bridge]
See its one thing for certain, two things for sure
Stand-up dudes stand up (ya dig)
That's what i do i be standing up
Its the game right here baby
Its the only game left for me to play

[verse 3]
Here for me to get it, started out in the civic
Yellow brick road, niggas calling me the wizard
Frontin' with them hoes i have you running through your digits
Stunting on the globe blowing through like a blizzard
Early l-mavas showing love on the bizzet
Doves on the coop whats the proof you can live it
What is it, when you reach a point for you to pivot
What the lives still vivid no my dice niggas dig it
Dirty game playing got the girly chain hangin'
Bit back slurred speak still street slangin'
I'm sayin' what all the hustlin' for
For you to get it, flip it, spend it, then you hustle for more

[outro]
Ya dig, hold on, imma be around for a long time
(ya know what i'm saying)
See i'm just what it used to be
Can't get it sup right here
I worked too hard for em'
Respect a nigga grind, let a nigga shine
