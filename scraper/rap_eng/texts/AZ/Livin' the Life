[Intro - Cozmo flips a sample]
It's wet ink, you dig?
Think it's a joint
Y'all get a level and all that, right?
Yo who joint is that, who that singing that?
The Satellites?
That shit crazy, ahaha
Once again! Back in business
AZ is a whole game motherf...

[Verse 1]
In a high rise penthouse suite over the beach
Got a bad bitch, butt ass, massaging my feet
Bumping DeBarge through the iPod, I'm nodding to sleep
My homey Miz caught a charge, his bid start in a week
Valet garage, got eleven cars parked in the street
One of the few so elite, it's an honor to meet
Obama physique, groomed well, garments is sleek
Have a chick so in check you got to con her to speak
Don of the week, centerfold magazine style
Fuck Kenneth Cole, everything is Japanese now
Love dinner rolls, lemonade with iced tea mixed
Who's on beginner mode? I see through the sheisty shit
Politely flipped, handsome, slightly mixed
Random broads come aboard, few might see dick
Fights we fixed, it's a handful whose life's legit
Said it before, mahphukkaz, yeah life's a bitch

[Hook]
This is for the homeys that did it and got away with it
Still around and talking, lounging, never lost it
Built they own fortress, living the life
Four wheeling or they peeling on bikes
This is for the homeys that did it and got away with it
Still around and talking, lounging, never lost it
Built they own fortress, living the life
Be four wheeling or they peeling on bikes

[Verse 2]
Kickstand the Kawasaki, cooling it off
Switch hands, the sour got me, I'm cool as the frost
Shower properly, smelling like a jewel in my north
It's only right like a midnight 2-2 Porsche
Dual exhaust, buck-60, fleeing, burning the clutch
Ballers is never talkers, they just learn and adjust
The jeans is crushed, double stitched, creased in the front
So go figure, ne-er nigga could teach me to stunt
Reach for the blunt, the reaper ain't release in a month
No sleeping, if you're scheming you'll get beat to the punch
Retreat to the Trump, feet up, fruit in the bowl
How many ever minked up and drop the coupe in the cold?
The view is controlled, the watchers just work and contribute
Only certified fly guys flirt with the visual
Circle the menu, main course pick of the day
Get yours, what else for a nigga to say?

[Hook]
This is for the homeys that did it and got away with it
Still around and talking, lounging, never lost it
Built they own fortress, living the life
Four wheeling or they peeling on bikes
This is for the homeys that did it and got away with it
Still around and talking, lounging, never lost it
Built they own fortress, living the life
Be four wheeling or they peeling on bikes
