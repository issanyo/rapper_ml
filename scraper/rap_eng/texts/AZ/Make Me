Fly photos no polo i throw those back
Hung up my scuffed soldier boots I holds no gat
Gotta crew of lil homies for that.. where the love at?
Still standin i ain't strung on crack
Still handle it like Pun on tracks
So check me out ya'll
Street of philly was born willy arms is chilly
Neck froze, fresh clothes, the specs is silly
Adore for really, war like the lord Achilles
Im too illy, worth more than half a billi
So please feel my im direct effect
And since a kid at fresh fest I’ve been fresh til death

[AZ talking]
You know what it is.. ayo Fresh come on man , it’s how we do it.. let’s resurrect the hood ya heard?

[Fresh]
The coke game is a regular, the stacks uneven
Pimp game’s still cellular, but rap I’m eatin'
Used to pitch packs in streets
Took it to the next level hard face watch made by Patti Philipe
Jars of dro the chalk just added to beef
Bars stay hot with raps thats grabbin the beats
Double nickle deep down in the bucket seats
Yatch match the Rolli, where my fuckin freaks?
Flow fast and gawdy with chinchilla minx
Hoes trash they bore me the kid barely blinks
Ma we can take it to another life level
Somethin like whole diamond round ya ice bezel
I heard a few niggas hatin on your nice fellow
But did they know your range cherry and ya ice yellow
I holla at you neccessary when it’s nice hello
It’s Fresh, 50 bricks nigga on my grind level

[Fresh talking]
Ayo A talk to these niggas.. you know we poor but cop chilly wrists niggas.. stackin chips niggas.. and official hood figures

[AZ]
Been locked in since them wally moccassins and them drop top bm's
Ya’ll shoulda cock blocked me then
Now a dime later haters try n box me in
But like Iverson i skip hop to the rim back spin whip wop fake cock it again
It’s understood I’m the hood Hitchcock with a grin

[Fresh]
Came in the spot wit 6 bad brawds, lift Jag doors
Never too gawdy but my wrist wrapped raw
Flip packs of raw, slick black valor
Reacquainted with rap now we rip half of these tours
Pull up at the summer league games Ashton Mar's
Hopped out the whip prada shit straps and all
The crack game is back so its fresh to ball
330 hard top cherry red bar watch
[?]
I handle pop niggas CL split top
So listen up to whos runnin the game
You know its Fresh 50 bricks plus the shit on my chain
Polo mitts so sick they just stick in you’re brain
[?]
And you could see Fresh livin good enjoyin my health
Now we runnin in the bars and we buyin the shelfs
M5 burn rubber we denyin the belts
Big bottles of that Don and we dyin for help
Niggas, shit back up when the Ashton dash up
The shit ash color mack in the black truck
