Hey hey hey hey, hey! Hey!
Hey hey hey hey, hey!

[Verse 1]
Peter paid Paul, prosecuter's case fall
Trial not needed, tell that loudmouth beat it
Now niggas see it chea! Bow to the cement
Back on the lamb like Shazam here I am
Killa like Cam, got gorillas on the land
Stop if you ain't got a million in your hand
Pissing in your pants cause they let a nigga free
Want to say a little grants then just let a nigga be
Low sweaters with the V's, thick alls with the moccs
Down in D.C. cause them doors don't lock
Love get shown, that's right a nigga home
Fresh on the land, SL in the plans
Please understand it's a few years lost
Recession ain't fierce, still new gear costs
Whose here's boss? Can we talk it on another note
Of course about the motherload cause I ain't trying to cut a throat

[Hook]
Money makes the world go round, I know you're lowdown
So fly, tiptoe through the town, tear the clubs up (x4)

[Verse 2]
Konvict Muzik, Bad Boy baller
Cash Money millionaire, Roc-a-fella spoiler
Black Wall Streets where the Bravehearts be
G's in my Unit keep my Terror Squad deep
Dipset, D-Block, Quiet Money shit
Hustle hard, Grand Hustle homey ain't no funny shit
Fuck the police, I'm Disturbin' tha Peace
Murda Ink on the sheets, just confirming the beef
Mos Def, rocking Talib niggas in their cribs
Swizz Beat niggas down, Timbaland on their ribs
For Real/Pharrell, niggas front until the Doctor got to Dre them
The truth from The Roots, let my shooters Andre them
3000 shots from the Big Boi Glock
It's Ludacris shit, but my CBs don't miss
OG Suge, I'm a Ice-T nigga
Up to no good, a Pisces swigger
I Cap a nigga Corn with the Gemini sag
A Scorp with some horns, got A-quarius swag
Corpse get embalmed, district peel them out the bag then
Place them in a tux and face them straight up
Drove to the sky, I'm supposed to be fly
Fresh head to toe, I'mma let a nigga know

[Hook]
Money makes the world go round, I know your lowdown
So fly, tiptoe through the town, tear the clubs up
Money makes the world go round, I know your lowdown
So fly, tiptoe through the town, tear the clubs up
Money makes the world go round, I know your lowdown
So fly, tiptoe through the town, tear the clubs up
Money makes the world go round, I know your lowdown
So fly, tiptoe through the town, tear the clubs up
