[Verse 1]
Sketch it, witness the relentless, the manhunt intenses
The TEC left behind was printless
NARCs and Homicide, Feds and armored rides
Haile Selassie, I'm vest-up, armed to die
Forever will, Glock shots, shoots to kill
So what the deal; violate, feel the steel
The cleverest, soever swifts, roamin' and holdin', terrorist
Born with this, gettin' on with this
Making moves while you fake moves
You and your frontin' crews, dressed, pawnin' jewels, livin' on 6-2's
But now it's on, the end justifies the means
Lye smoke and cream, is all I fiend
It's in my genes, I float through the streets and seen
In a tinted European 850 coupe, it's green
Nothin' in between, me and my team, we ill too
Respect due, oh I feel for you

[Verse 2]
We got this locked now, pure official, white crystal
The hype'll get you before the snipe from the pistol
It's potent, just one whiff'll have you floatin'
Hot and soakin' while I'm sellin', y'alls is smokin'
Forever shinin', but strictly through diamonds prominent
And dinin' with wealthy old dime bitches, riches from cosignin'
Golden-American Visa Charge-card, holdin', I'm rollin'
Affiliated with those that bollin'
So knowledge me, and analyze my qualities
You've crossed all apologies, my lifetime policy
Plus playin' for keeps in these New York streets
It get deep, so hold heat and try and control your sleep
'Cause umm, the life I live is deeper than the Mississippi Rivers
Me and my niggas only drivin' what our vibe give us
Puffin' lye, gettin' high til we die
So fuck it, whatever nigga, try violate and fry
