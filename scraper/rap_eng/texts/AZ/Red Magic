[Chorus: The Brothers Johnson sample]
Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

[Verse 1]
Posted up perpendicular, criminal curricular
Versatile, nah nigga's style is similar
You know the signature, Louis V graffiti wear
Foolishly to believe niggas could see me here
Greek platters, sitting like how I eat matters
Sip so much Cris' I got a weak bladder
Speak dapper, dummies call me the deep rapper
Bitches bow and allow a nigga to beat faster
Breathe after I'm gone gracing the mic
Indeed it's fashion and pawn, a day in the life
Been a beast since the octopus break beats
Way before the V-Twizzy came with the suede seats
Years before Nas verse released and his tape leaked
I was right there in Chesapeake like 8 deep for 80 weeks
Crazy Jeeps, candy coupes, a baby freak
Fornicating, fucking broads on the day we meet
From DC to VA Beach, down in NC
Fuck police, nigga, stay in the beef
Blaze and creep, analyze, display conceit
Sex sanitize, interchange the seats
I'm elite, niggas need to listen when I speak
I can lift you off your feet or position you to eat

[Chorus: The Brothers Johnson sample]
Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

[Verse 2]
Closed caption, chose in rose rapping
Exposed to the cold, got a cloth and dove back in
From stove action to spitting the flow flashing
From dough stacking to having them hoes yapping
No rations, Rollies, I'm old fashioned
And more macking for doley homie, what's happening?
In that 4 door, '84s on decor
More fly than the day before, for sure
Bonjour, blowing kisses at the pretty women
A connoisseur with the kicks and the crispy denim
Stay winning, puffing spliffs to the 5th dimension
Politicing from a pimp's position, persistent
All wrist wear, water resistant
Get it clear, niggas auras' different, I'm all vintage
A crook off a verse and a hook
I'm in the books when it's smooth as an inside jux

[Chorus: The Brothers Johnson sample]
Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
