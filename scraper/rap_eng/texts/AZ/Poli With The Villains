Hook
This ain’t radio-ready this is mixtape heavy
For them hip-hop heads, every dose is real deadly
Bodies in the buildin’, everybody’s catchin’ feelins
But I don’t give a fuck I’m tryna poli with the villains

Verse 1
East coast, west coast
Both is the best coast
Beatin’ on some pussy you can hear it through the bedpost
Beef and it’s a bullet or you get both of your legs broke
Let’s smoke
My shit’ll make a nigga chest choke
Yes, yo, everybody screamin’ me and Esco
Like me and him together, we can form the next Death Row
Fresh flow, got this, I ain’t tryna let go
Props shit, and I’ma hit a nigga with a TEC blow
Hot Cris, get mad respect through the Metro
Toxic, stir it up, like the Doug E. Fresh show
Wop it, smurf if a nigga got a dope beat
Hock spit on any nigga earth if he owe me

Y’all niggas know me
Ya dig?

Verse 2
Live nigga, eye a nigga back on fire
Fresh off the ave, niggas eyein’ my attire
Feet up on the dash like it ain’t no nigga flyer
Dub-sack buyer, I’m a out-of-state supplier
SIRE: That’s what they call a nigga now
Go inquire, hear how I shut niggas down
Mariah: Be glad Nick Cannon put the cuffs on
It’s sad, I was that close, we coulda got our fuck on
Chucks on, bad boy, tryna get my puff on
Puffin’ on some purple cuz a muthafucka luck gone
Roll by, fuck a fist, catch me on the doe side
Ghost ride ever since my man Money Mo died
Broca, Julio Igles for the cho-cha
Sosa, elite status, call me the most high

‘Fo y’all muthafuckas die

Verse 3
Whips got copped, a nigga wrist got rocked
‘Round the same time ‘Face first shit dropped
The Snoop shit came, started dissin’ Luke name
Then Biggie shit blew, what a nigga gonna do?
The Illmatic dropped, nigga got a slot
Three months later, nigga sittin’ on top
Sugar Hill rocked then the whole shit flopped
Thank God I could bob, duck, weave and I box
Real nigga shit, spittin’ “Why’s a nigga rich?”
Got pride, keep cash, so y’all crabs suck dick

That’s it
What else?
It ain’t no mo’
