[Intro: AZ]
Yeah
It's on now
You know?
NFL type of thing
My man Scott and Ray holding the fort down

[Verse 1: Ray Buchanan]
Is your love just dedicated on my success
Will you still be standing by my side if ever there's a test?
You're apart of me now, that I don't doubt
But if you leave me later I might not survive that drop
When the debts are high and the money's come and gone
Will you still be in my corner helping me to carry on
Will you be holding me after the cheering stops?
Will you, baby?
(Zhané)

[Chorus: Zhané]
After the cheering stops
There will be no love lost
I'll take you by your hand
And stay, oh no
After the cheering stops
There will be no love lost
I'll take you by your hand
And stay, oh no

[Verse 2: Ray Buchanan]
Tick, tock, in the fourth quarter, when it stops
Will you be there no matter what to give me props
'Cause on the daily it drives me crazy
From the struggle, are you my lady?
When I was balling you wasn't stalling
To give me love when I was up, but now I'm falling
To a level down to Earth with everybody else
Do you want me for me or spotlight for yourself
The NFL not for long, so don't be bugging
Is it the jersey or the hype, or me you're loving, or lusting
For all my skills to pay the bills for a sista
I got with ya because (you're my lady)
No diggity, so feel me
You wanna get with then understand me, G
The fundamentals, it's potential, it's essential
The way you make me feel, yo it's crucial, so

[Chorus: Zhané]
After the cheering stops
There will be no love lost
I'll take you by your hand
And stay, oh no
After the cheering stops
There will be no love lost
I'll take you by your hand
And stay, oh no

[Verse 3: AZ]
I know when times are [?] can a fella trust you?
But you know the hustle, life is like a card shuffle
And for the dough, how I come and go, I'm coming slow
I'm tryna know 'fore my dough start to running low, so
Let's connect in some nighttime sweat
And you can bet when it come to sex, like mine's wet
And verbal, we can sin and rob
Get live so I can get inside, find foulness and prescribe
Begin again without camouflaging and blending in
Betting Benjamins on the Superbowl, who's gonna win?
It's me and you, back to back, how we do
Let's become [?] and multiply by two
[?] sports
Yo, be strong, let's hold down the fort
Cause it's [?] getting slowed down in court
And though I can't call
If not, couldn't say I never saw it

[Bridge: Ray Buchanan & Zhané]
I'll be right here when the cheering stops
I'll be what you need
I'll be right here when the cheering stops
Need to know that
I'll be right here when the cheering stops
The cheering stops
