[Intro: Bounty Killer] (AZ)
Cross!!! Angry!!! (Yeah!)
Aiyyo you know it's Bounty Killer and AZ (Stand in attention)
No if's no buts no maybes (Single file)
Aiyyo yallo! Motherfuckin niggas clear out (Carry your flags)
Warlord in the buildin (It's the art of war)
Aiyyo yallo! I got this fuckin forty five willin
(Fire they lost power) I caught dem stealin
(Bounty Killer) yo!!! (AZ) Lawd a mercy (Soldiers at war) huh!

[Verse 1: AZ]
If you Crip get your Crip on sip get your piff on
Never slip I'm in the mix with the fifth long
Never riff see me fixin on my lip balm
Chip charm chillin with them Gucci kicks on
But like the Kiss song niggas get shit wrong
To a bliss fully flipped and they gettin pissed on
Life ain't a sitcom gotta keep your wisk on
Shit niggas bitch other snitch like Nick Bonds
Pick chrones pick 'em up switch pawns
Pick 'em up get 'em tuck get gone see it's on
Some got warned got laid got torned
Got shot got saved got mourned

[Hook: Bounty Killer]
War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin

[Verse 2: Bounty Killer]
Run up inna mi gun an yuh a mystery
Di last dem see yuh and di rest a it a mystery
Rush mi wid knife an promise yuh a guh fist mi
Badman nuh trace an crab like big seh
Bullet mi a guh gi dem bout 60
Friend from him could, him haffi leave yuh in a jifty
Gunshot a mek di fassy speak inna gypsy
From Brooklyn to Poughkeepsie croosss

[Hook: Bounty Killer]
War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin

[Verse 3: AZ]
I'm cool with them Pirus cool with them die moves
Any death this way niggas a die too
Cry who y'all won't do me like Ja Rule
Jewels all sky blue smooth since High School
Fuck with a why do with me it's why who
You sneeze you liable to leave we hostle
Young apostle, son of pop duke
Cop cruise to move to top roof
Got loose and left them high stoops
The rest is my new respect to my troops
Give me boose some juice some grey Goose
And word to Jesus it's back to Beirut

[Hook: Bounty Killer]
War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin
