Yeah, go 'head, back it up, you can hold me baby

I just wanna see you take it off

Baby you got what I need now
Couple bottles of cris, let's get it on now
From the front of the club to the back now

I just wanna see you take it off

Watch me move and it shake the whole place down
Pull up in the whips so we can get down
'Cuz it me and my girls now, you and ya boys now

Sarafina, grace of a ballerina, small waist
Ass shake like Trina's
Pretty face, tougue taste like zima, if I
Wasn't a pimp I put a ring on ya finger
Freak for sure, knew her for a week or more
And already wanna beat up raw
On the dance floor dancing 'til my feet were sore
(I just wanna see you take it off)
Even willing to, piece her off, had my
Hands on her rear, cheeks was soft
I was all in the air letting that reefer talk
And like magic, in seconds, I eased her thoughts
Told her, get a drink if she need support
Just order don't think, I eat the cost
The car's close if ya legs are too weak to walk

I just wanna see you take it off

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Weekend's here, told boo, be sincere
I wanna see you in ya evening wear
Had her doubie wrapped up, made her release her hair
Lights on, made sure the grease was near, Nikes on
Kicked 'em right off beneath the chairs
Tan lines lit up nice, made her features glare
Tattoos, smooth skin, plus her teeth was fair
(I just wanna see you take it off)
Doe is here, I, know affairs, love cars like clothes
I, drove for years
Love a massage and a chick to let me hold her ears
Who's willing, no feelings, I'm cold as beer
As long as the zone is there
And as long as she bathe and comb her hair
We can light something nice and cologne the air

I just wanna see you take it off

[Hook]

Now you good, quote ya price if ya toes is nice
And if you got fitted jeans that promote you right
It's never a such thing as clothes too tight
Hype, hair color, skin-tone too, light
I love sights, I'm a old school type, tits, lips
Even marry hoes I like
Rarely kiss but I lick, twist, roll it right
(I just wanna see you take it off)
We can do it with a, bowl of ice
Take you out, you could, pose as wife
Teach you how to hold heat, unload and wipe
(I just wanna see you take it off)
Give you a different roll in life
Lemme show you that tonight's your, chosen night
Take that, take that. Uh huh

I just wanna see you take it off

[Hook]

Yeah, AZ, Quiet Money, L.E.S. Big Thangs, Throw 'em down
