[Chorus: Merecco Turner]
When I was a young man
19 and used to hustle in the street
Was all about making green
But I was living the good life
Fast cars and lotta women
Didn't love so I made 'em cry
And when I got older
I used to tear the clubs up
Bottle after bottle, model after model
But now the best story of my life
Is my pretty little girl and my beautiful wife

[Verse 1: Papoose]
I used to see weddin' pictures on the wall
My parents looked happy
I said, "when I grow up one day, I'm gettin' married"
Hangin' in the hood I was dragged into it
They said bitches ain't shit, a bad influence
Broke hearts, got my heart broken: true karma
Had to have a talk with myself like, "you smarter"
The O.G.s were sayin' these girls ain't loyal
Get locked, they won't do nothin' for you
But when I went to the male facility to visit my friends
It was overcrowded with women visitin' 'em
Went to the female facility to visit my wife, it was deserted
No man visited and that hurted
When I see that, I transformed my vision
I realized some of these men are the real bitches
The hood taught us wrong, ain't want us to be supreme
My daughter is the princess, my wife is the queen

[Chorus: Merecco Turner]
When I was a young man
19 and used to hustle in the street
Was all about making green
But I was living the good life
Fast cars and lotta women
Didn't love so I made 'em cry
And when I got older
I used to tear the clubs up
Bottle after bottle, model after model
But now the best story of my life
Is raising my little man and my beautiful wife

[Verse 2: Mysonne]
It's Mysonne
I was plottin', makin' plans up, tryna get my bands up
Runnin' 'round on these streets and I got jammed up
Then I came home, I was out here tearin' the land up
'Til I met my wife, had kids, I had to man up
I had to stand up and raise my kings (God)
Understand a nigga ain't got wings
But I'm tryna move righteously, conscious be fightin' me
The Devil playground, he just keep invitin' me
The O.G.s enlightened me, how to move my honor
Played by the rules, I'm tryna improve my karma
This year, I swear, I'ma move my mama
To a big house out somewhere in Florida
I swear I'ma give her all the stuff I promised her
My wife held me down so I gotta acknowledge her
I'm out grindin' for my legacy
So when I'm gone the world gon' remember me

[Chorus: Merecco Turner]
When I was a young man
19 and used to hustle in the street
Was all about making green
But I was living the good life
Fast cars and lotta women
Didn't love so I made 'em cry
And when I got older
I used to tear the clubs up
Bottle after bottle, model after model
But now the best story of my life
Is raising my little man and my beautiful wife

[Verse 3: AZ]
Uh, the culture create menaces
The drop on the roadster, so venomous
Rose as a soldier, I was into shit
Bands, had the benefit, ran through them tenements
Taught by the teachers, the techniques
The reefer, the neckpiece, new sneakers, the best freaks
Fresh on a reg since Pro-Keds
It's blessed to be said, I'm an old head
Po' dead, the God 7, restin' in Heaven
Me and [?], we still brethrens, the last of the livin' legends
Lost in the sauce, now on my deen
Was all off course, I was a fiend
Fiend for the women and cream, but when you king
And, knowledge intervenes, everything ain't what it seems
Truths be real, the juice is spilled
And that unconditional love's the only proof that's real

[Chorus: Merecco Turner]
When I was a young man
19 and used to hustle in the street
Was all about making green
But I was living the good life
Fast cars and lotta women
Didn't love so I made 'em cry
And when I got older
I used to tear the clubs up
Bottle after bottle, model after model
But now the best story of my life
Is my pretty little girl and my beautiful wife
