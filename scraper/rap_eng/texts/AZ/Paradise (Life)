This is life (echo 2x)
But it's paradise for me

[Verse 1]
From the cradles to the stiff coffin, legit fortune
I lean for them corner fiends, crip-walking
Wedding-bells I'm out of that shell of slick talking
Honeymoon, deep scuba diving, kissing the dolphins
I lived, though I quit flossing, I forgive though this shit's costing
At the crib with the kids often, coasting
Ski-boating on the beach ocean
Hoping them old closed cases never re-open
Moving, y'all minor leagues, I'm like speed motion
Muscles thru my white tees bulking, he's holding
Hypnotic, spit shit you sit and vibe with, melodic
A mental escape through all the garbage

[Hook x4]
This is life (echo 4x)

[Verse 2]
One in a million, I'm strong young and appealing
Was born son of a villain, put on in front of my building
Peeping how the street structured, deceased brothers
Critique, but I was placed here to reach others
Incomplete, staying feet from the deep cover
Eternal sleep, I wonder if the Beast love us
The frail weaken, the stronger be in jail eating
The average male will make it home if the bail's decent
I inhale frequent, it alleviate weight
To be a part of the game can't be a day late
To be a part of the sane, need a G a day take
Five if you live, slide mines on the side

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Mics, money, and music my life's for you to view it
I stand militant, my stripes came from the sewage
Interrogation lights, spent nights up in the cubics
Fistfights, I'm nice like Earl Huvick
Harmonizing, narration is traumatizing
Here since '94, it's still kinda surprising
I touched topics, safe-boxes, unlocked it
Complete zone keep my tone on one octave
Owe nothing, won't ask to hold nothing
Clean behind the scene, but control buttons
Brought it back for the essence that got watered in rap
Cause of my aura I bring more to a track

[Hook x7]
