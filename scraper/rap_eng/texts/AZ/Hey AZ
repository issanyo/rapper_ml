No doubt, time to mellow out
Party at the yellow house, yell it out
Invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laidback with the Alize, milli's concealed
Conversating like some more pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit stressed out supporting your bitch
Let the ice shine, easing my mind with white wine
Assured lifeline, sqeezing my nine the right time
Camouflage life, feds almost bagged the god twice
Bizare nights move on the grace of Allah's light
All Armani white, feeling like Christ with the army type
Cons be writing knowing my life is based upon the hype
Burning incense with intents to school the infants
The rules are different, so for those that chose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains

Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Long (fucked up, all night)
Long (fucked up, all night)

So many deaf and blind got caught up and left behind
I guess Bacardi Lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine
Next in line, slow G-ing, low key-ing
Me and the crew in the gold B.M. O.D-ing
Top speed, blowing through the sweet night breeze
Wherever life leads, anything's better besides a tight squeeze
Sliced cheese, even my pieces pushing nice v's
Dressed precisely, hoping soon one be the wifey
It's working well, process words, helping to purge and sell
Urban hell, playing park benches, burning L's
It's all basics, probation, open cases
We ill natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of satan, congregating
Conversating, trying to map ways of escaping
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels as souvenirs

[SWV]
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)

Long (fucked up, all night)
Long (fucked up, all night)
AZ, knock me off my dog gone shoes

[AZ]
For the world
No more case pending, it's all a brand new begining
AZ I'm back winning, dressed in black linen
Attract women, low fade, waves laid and spinning
Stay paid, four different ways, put my bid in
No sleep, be playing with time, my mind goes deep
These cold streets, rock a diamond chip, gold teeth
Trying to stay sane, amongst the madness and maintain
Though the game changed, the message involved remain plain
Poor advice given, we all strive for nice living
Insights, some pay the price others spend nights in prison
Plea bargain, hoping my peoples peep the problem
We each disolving trying to make moves to keep from starving
