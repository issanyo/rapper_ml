[Intro: Jay-Z (sample)]
One million, two million, three million, four

[Verse 1: AZ]
First off, it's the first in the loft
First to peel off in that pretty little Porsche
Pretty little women with their skin so soft
And that triple beige linen stay bigging up, New York
You know them haters goin' talk
And do what they do so a player can't floss
Well motherfucker, I'm a boss
Rich boy, hustler, slimmer Rick Ross
So don't get it crisscrossed
I'm a bit pissed off but the wrist still frost
Neck all chipped up, kicks still cost
I leave foreign change, I done catered out the Range
Me and you the same, homie, get it out your brain
South beach with it, I done did it out in Spain
Was never heavy with the fame
But the name still bang 'cause I'm heavy in the game

[Chorus: Consequence]
Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey)
I gets mine and you better do the same (hey)
If not then you're only in the way (hey)
'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey)
Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey)
I gets mine and you better do the same (hey)
If not (hey) then you're only in the way (hey)
'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey)
(Come on)

[Verse 2: AZ]
(Come on)
Different breed, different needs
[?] in Nova 'cotia, mixin' weed
Influence to Costa Nostra, this is me
B-K A-Z H and I see (come on)
And I ain't here to hurt nobody
I'm just here to watch chicks work their body, and
Back somethin' like Laila Ali, and
Head back to the hotel lobby, and
Louis V, jewellery
Who else could it be homie, who but me
Fresh Prince of the projects, Kool Moe Dee
With my Tom Ford shades and 'em up North ways (word)
I'm just tryin' behave
Tryin' get it how I get it 'til I'm finally paid (yes)
Yes I'm finally made
Joe Pesci in Casino I can honestly say

[Chorus: Consequence]
Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey)
I gets mine and you better do the same (hey)
If not then you're only in the way (hey)
'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey)
Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey)
I gets mine and you better do the same (hey)
If not (hey) then you're only in the way (hey)
'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey)
(Come on)

[Verse 3: Consequence]
So at this point, in the uh-major is insignificant
It's all about the Cons' and the way that I be rippin' shit
'Cause I moved on from the fools I did business with
There ain't no hard feelin's like I just became impotent
Now they take to him, like valleys in California
Come what you want, fire, that's when the hoes is on you
I'll still be on the corner and I feel no shame
'Cause I bet you they goin' kick it like when your field goal range
So if you don't know the name of the killer you see
Let me spell it out for you like a kid at a bee
See I gotta get mine, no matter the consequences
That's why they feel the kid like one of the five senses
So why raise the question about my demographic
When everybody knows that my demo was a classic
I'm in the driver's seat like chauffeur in traffic
So you don't want to try with the Cons' you bastards

[Chorus: Consequence]
Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey)
I gets mine and you better do the same (hey)
If not then you're only in the way (hey)
'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey)
Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey)
I gets mine and you better do the same (hey)
If not (hey) then you're only in the way (hey)
'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (yo)
