This veteran's charge, soon to have a Wally garage
Yea, demand the land, I want a jet black discovery recovery, big time
See when you, when you start fucking wit my shit like that
You're taking on a natural high see what I'm saying
Shit is natural (yea no doubt) shit is like baking a cake
Know what I mean, like squeezing a hand joint (word up design, designing)
Know what I'm saying, Doe or Die style kid, the remix

(Both)
Yo, yo I roll wit brothers who puff dust lust plus
A + conniving cash you can't trust
Yo, these avalanche rock throwers, granola holders
Style is steady ready like a military soldier
Wu Killa Bee plus Sosa, AZ
Two SC's, Doe or die style, let's see
Yo, the track's banging like a Amaretto shake son
Take some, 50 on whatever we make son

(Raekwon)
Yo now let me show you how my whole team operate
Cooperate, tie you up, drop you on the Tri-state
What up, my whole style is camoflage
The veteran's charge, bagging all these shorties up in sport cars
When we react, it's like Mafia, keep my jims rocking ya
Czechoslovakia, Khadafi, dunn, diamonds
What, Sosa, La costra nostra
Snap a flick of this Chef, double exposure

(AZ)
Who's the wickedest, street official-est, Guess, Cortex
Lex is the crispiest, iced up, ridiculous
People look, the unexplainable'll keep ya shook
How ill is him? The realism got you hooked
So let's lay law cause only fat cats play ball
Let this ape walk, cause taking his paper's all I crave for
The resurrection 86 cartel connection
Raid your section, L's twist to a perfection

(Raekwon)
Primetime, genuine, shine, Lex seat recline
Yo, 'Vine, he ran up on me with a nine, he's mine
I won't play, Gamma ray spray Rae, he tried to pray
He threw a grand away, yo, I plan a day to drive his land away
Doe or die, right, light up the Thai, my peoples get high
Showing my love to niggas on the inside

(AZ)
Black supreme, high king, mine shine like high beams
Who be that dime queen? Seems she take time in her hygiene
My lime green, Italian gator boots made a fiend
Check the Firm team, names internationally ring
Triple X large, duplex with a garage
Gold Express Cards plus enough 'sess to bless the Gods
So let's play, catch me in a Motown Cafe
Cap on half way, sipping OJ and Grand Marnier
Doe or die way, Courvoisier
