[Verse 1]
I'ma, 80's baby
Mercedes made me
Crack money and MoÃ«t made me crazy
Strapped hungry with no vest, they named me AZ
Amongst the militant, too insane to raise me, was Swayze
Some old school pimps embraced me
And built real between daffodils and daisies, amazed me
The cars changed, switched attire
Broads came, partied like Richard Pryor
(?) frames, no lens to protect my pupils
Thou' the heart changed, love amongst my mens was neutral
Beautiful
We puffed, it was dough to spread
With enough bread for uniforms to summon the Feds
I fled
Instead I had a mouth to feed
19, my queen claimed she havin' my seed
Do the right thing is wise, that's what Spike Lee said
So disguised as a mic fiend, my ties was dead

[Chorus]
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top
The game don't stop...
The game don't stop...
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top

[Verse 2]
My kid here, career in the bloom
I don't live there no more, I done moved to the moon
Whips is like spaceships that zoom on fumes
Flooded bracelets they lit like an eclipse in June
No cartoon
I symbolize the code itself
Once told he who hold don't expose his weatlh
But what else
When one life's faced with crisis
And you see hate replace the holy faith of the righteous
I just
Handcuffed and jailed myself
Jammed up and, bailed myself
With no help
Made my own V.I.s and mailed myself
It's all B.I., I had to tell myself
I'm on lock
And the game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top
Flashin' my wrist watch
Like, "go get cops"
Bitch I'm legit got rich off Hip-Hop

[Chorus]
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top
The game don't stop...
The game don't stop...
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top

[Verse 3]
I'm one man but so many monsters in me
With one gram had plans on conquerin' cities
So on one hand could've signed and, launched with Diddy
But I ran with my other man, the response was pretty
A few grams, a few niggas' fiances with me
New Sedans, was feelin' like Fonzworth Bentley
Who the man? My homies at the concerts with me
I was back on my deen
Then the jacket with the jeans
Then the hatin' and slackin' with the team
Now I know what it means
Things ain't always what it seems
It's the ones that smoke blunts with cha
Rap with cha
But really want your black ass out the picture
Bet the God won't slip
I'm indie with the semi on the Remy loaded talons in the clips
Rubber grip
Got the silence on the tip
So call it what you want I'm on my New York shit!

[Chorus]
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top
The game don't stop...
The game don't stop...
The game don't stop
Til the playa get knocked
Or the shit flip-flop
And you sittin' on top
