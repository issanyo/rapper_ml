It's been official best wishes I send em wit you
Never sentimental you know the shit a nigga into
I'm cross-country it's big pimpin all the broads want me
I'ma do this till the law confront me
Fuck a slow jam kissing and holding my hand
I'm a cold man stay flippin gettin that fam
Who can blame me for all those days you tried to game me
Switch and change me did shit that made me angry
It's like payback watch the shit you say on this track
I heard the stories how you get down lay on yo back
True confessions why ask so i'm sexxin
Who i'm blessin and if a nigga use protection

(Singer)
I've been feelin bad but not bad enough
Not to walk away Oh no
Feelin so sad cause thought you were my girl
Since you betrayed me it's on...on.....

You know you're wrong for trying to play me
Now he's gone cause he's back with me

Chorus:
He wasn't yours when he was mine
I can't believe
That you got down like that
Now you know how it feels
He's back with me
Cause it b's like that
(repeat)

(Singer)
Never thought you just hurt me girl
(how could you just) How could you just go on?
Can't believe you tried to say it was someone else
When it was you that I saw

You know you're wrong for trying to play me
Now he's gone cause he's back with me

Chorus

(Animal)
I could see the whole game through the platinum frames
I done hit niggas wifes I ain't sayin no names
I just drive through ya block in convertible drops
Hand you and your best friend sharin a rock
Copped a house on a hill six car garage
Back massage I'm into menage a trois
Where I'm living at you can wear shorts in December
You remember stay in the mix like a blender
I'm goin up the middle I'ma spread y'all both
I'm an animal you know I had to hit y'all both
You and the doctor call back go ahead i'ma fall back
Sex was wack but your best friend was all that
Me and honey dip was creepin off for months
Had her blowin on the pipe while I was blowin on blunts
But you is trouble though I cop the six double O
But i'ma let you go with the Lex bubble though
Shorty think I trick alot cause she suck the dick alot
I'm fuckin wit y'all like Sir i'm in the mix alot

Singer* Background Singers*
Why'd you have to go and play yourself
Girl you know you were wrong
Now you're sitting home all by yourself
The man you thought was yours is gone
(repeat)

Chorus 4x
