[Intro: AB.Y.SS]
Heh, yeah, they said heavy is the head that wears the crown
So you know it's going down
Eastwood Entertainment, lets go

[Verse 1: AB.Y.SS]
Yeah, uh
And now I sit back finally breathin'
A youngin' diggin' through them crates called Diamond D
The slow role had me steppin in them wallabees
Twisted on the block, throwin' up like the Dynasty
Truth is I'm way more than what you try to be
And paint a perfect picture for the blind, they just tryna' see
My right hand to the sky, I swear solemnly that I raise the bar, jack the pot like the lottery
Snakes came as friends tellin' all these lies to me
From the start they follow me, return as a rivalry
Mask and glove on, the industry's my robbery
Shootin' past the moon 'til these stars on the side of me
I been more than what you tried to be
I turn your speakers to my diary 'cause I ain't tryna' see poverty
I hit the ground runnin', move around like it's five of me

[Hook: Lamone]
To be or not to be, that is the question
Depends on how you live, then you got to put in work
And it's how hard you fight makes you a legend

[Verse 2: AB.Y.SS]
Uh, yeah
And all this love came with hate, envy's automatic
But that's what happens when you think big, I'm more than average
Scrape the plate 'til it break, been more than savage
I'm from a city that never sleeps, insomniac
My Hall of Fame status more than a ballers' average
Box me in from every angle, still lettin' off the plastic
Bright lights beamin' on me, I was lost in traffic
I'm married to the game before Mase had that horse and carriage
You can chop and bag it, find me in the flawless bracket
Poker face king sittin' in the Don palace
From the ground to my crown won't spray up at it
Been the catalyst stampedin' your top strategists
I've been more than what you tried to be
I turn your speakers to my diary
Sky's the limit, I'm the pilot, come fly with me
And when I touch down I move around like there's nine of me

[Hook: Lamone & AZ]
To be or not to be, that is the question
What's understood need not be said
Depends on how you live, then you got to put in work
Legend
And it's how hard you fight makes you a legend
You know how I give it up

[Verse 3: AZ]
Uh, dreams of perfection, a King's perception
Doers stay on they deem, what's seen is destined
Everything in between is what brings the lesson
Lessons brings blessins', it seems refreshin', stay reppin'
My vibe is what keeps me alive
I'm the proof of what pop Duke tried to teach me at five
I survive
These streets is on daily repeat
Somehow, I was spared to style and air on the beat
Your boy deep, done it, tatted stomach, I come from it
Them trap days I was raised to keep it a hunnid, who want it?
I'm wiser, a few dollars, no Uber drivers
The truth provider, fuck [?]
They could do me notta, Nathan
'Nother creation, hand-written, spittin', know what you facin'
Etched in stone, my rep is known
I'ma do this to all the homies, max out and come home

[Hook: Lamone]
To be or not to be, that is the question
Depends on how you live, then you got to put in work
And it's how hard you fight makes you a legend
