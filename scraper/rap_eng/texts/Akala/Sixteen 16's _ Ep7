[Akala : Verse 1]

Life liberty in the pursuit of property
Probably woulda been more proper terminology
To explain the world envisioned by a monopoly
What do we do with this world we’ve inherited
What is happiness for you?
What do you pursuit?
Wealth for the few as long as you’re enjoying the view?
And what does wealth guarantee?
Some peace of mind, regular blowjobs and cars that are nicely designed?
I’m being superficial
It also guarantees that your children’s school won't get hit by a missile
On the unlikely event that it does
It will be fucking hell to pay for a memorial written in blood
Money don’t buy happiness, probably true
What if it buys the closest thing then what do we do?
What good is it loving all of the simple things
If the power the money brings takes em away at your whim
