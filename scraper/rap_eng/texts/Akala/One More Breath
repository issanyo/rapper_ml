[Intro]

[Verse 1]
What is this thing I see
This silly little thing called me
This skin, this hair, this flesh
This brain, this pain, this mess
What's life?
A game that we just  play with two plain dice?
When the shell dies, does the soul fly?
Hellfire, does the flame fry?
Is this the audition, brief intermission for something much grander
Get a bigger piece of pie, great show in the sky
Or is that just propaganda?
That they telling me, selling me sold with evidence
But intelligence, slowers development
We that think that we know we are not reverent
But we don't even yet know if we're relevant

[Hook]
One more pause, one more breath
One more pause, one more breath
Is this all that there is
If it is, I wish I could give
One more pause, one more breath
We could never know, if we're ever next
Everytime I think I know, I stop and ask myself

[Verse 2]
What is this thing I see
This silly little thing called we
This brain, this pain, this flesh
These trains, these planes, what's next?
Yes, we're gonna beget technology
But the majority, escaping poverty
No, I don't think that we can
Cause we still think that we got the plan and
By judging a man by just what's in his hands
Or his land, or his tan and just cause we can
Pause, take a breath
Realise that none of us know what is next
See your code of address or the code of your dress
We all still use that same hole for our breath
Playing the game but there's never a Ref
And you can't take it with you if ever you left

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What is this thing I see
Who could ever know, what we're gonna be
Are we elevating our meditation
Not detonating through self-preservation
Generation television's raising
Yet we're complaining about how they're behaving
Washing our hands or just bathing with satan
Yet with all that said, that's just what you make it
Pause, take what is naturally given
Because actually there is no tax on our living
It's a fact though it's naturally hidden
Like I'm just an actual assassin on riddem
The adrenaline, we're rememberin'
Our December is cold as it's ever been
Fighting our best, but the victory we revel in
Fighting our brethren, how could we ever win?

[Hook]
