[Verse 1: Akala]

Who’s fuckin' with the flow of the kid
Duppy riddims then I kill em with the shit
Yuppie feelings, Couldn’t give a shit
Couple Shillings, now they think they’re rich
Never ever could they ever get em’
Sever heads whatever I am ever clever dread
Everybody Killer fill em up with lead?
Are they realy really, is that many dead?
Every spitter [] for the bread
Are they really ready to go bury heads
Does it matter, if its chatter
What you gotta do to be a better rapper
Wann coppy me cop a snapper
How cute, little slapper
Few riddles syllables spittin Jewls
Spirituals, for the youth
Take em’ into schools turn them into fools
Got them coming out thinkin that they {}
Everything they hold everything they know
Everybody got to be a better clone

[Chorus: Akala]

Who’s Fuckin with me really sincerely
I tell you to think clearly you cannot get near me
Cos who’s ramping with me really sincerely
I tell you to think clearly you can't even hear me

[Verse 2: Akala]

Bloods flowing  in my veins never tame
Pain weighing in my frame never sane
Players never changed games stay the same
But the wicked wizard will forever reign
Witty lyrics comin out my brain
Sickest with the physics could never explain
I am the bloody one no talk
You’re just a fraud like the courts
Talk and they fuckin talk and retort
But what they’re sellin I have never bought
They wanna bloody yell about the law
But they’re the ones peddeling the war
Blood to settle scores got to get the raw minerals
Criminals with the law
I am the f one are they dumb?
Dh are my sons, send em to they mum
Never spat a sick verse whip a gun
If the fight come? Prolly woulda run
You see couple tracksuits
Couple black youths
Couple fat suits
And you think cos they talk tough
That really mean that they trap food
But the roads know what the roads know
Only few rappers getting rolls tho
Who cares if you can't flow tho
I don’t really watch for the show show

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Akala]

Seen a drug addiction uncles sent to prison
Capitalism inner city livin
Av’ a seat start from the beginning
Story that im spinning it will never finish
Glory that I’m giving it cannot diminish
Cor he’s bloody sick, take him to a clinic
What you think it is, schizophrenic lyrics?
What a prick he will never mimic
Every single little fact that they have
Rags in their bags that never has
Ever made the subject of my track
Though I may get fresh when I rap
Or maybe not so bloody what
Either way girls wanna clog
And I got a car and I got a watch
So what blud where your office?
Where your knowledge bigger than a college
If you haven’t got it wonder in a forest
Lost in your mind
Lost in your soul
Where you’re going you will never know
