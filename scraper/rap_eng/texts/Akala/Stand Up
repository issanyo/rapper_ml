It's Not A Rumour, blud

[Verse 1: Akala]
All my people, wherever in britain
Bro I know the flows cold
Let me know that you feel it
And I know the roads slow but your ready to kill me
Cause I feel that same pain, hear the lyrics I'm spittin?
Critics ask why I don't smile, they gotta be kiddin
Little kids'll blow your head off, just to say that they did it
I'm in the streets one deep, these villains think that I'm slippin
Nah bruv, I don't care bout none of you spitters
If your real then your feelin' it
Nah, I don't give a shit
Respect the message nigga, illa state records
British flag, yard colours cause tell me where my
Head is First time you saw me, iwas screamin' fuck the
Police' Next I came I change the whole game in the streets
These wollys still tryna' catch up with war, I
Bang harder, Father, 'roll wid us' huh, iain't even started...

Shit's tired, All the great rappers is either dead or retired
All these soppy cunts, talkin' bout bitches n'
Blunts, How much your chain cost, and you bustin' ya gun
And you can't spit, your sticks, ya get hang a box in
The chops, Silly boys can't bang with me, fools can't hangwith me
I dont really care unless it's paper or my family
Home's this is the roads and there's only one

[Verse 3: Akala]
I talk alot, but idon't conversate with punks
Try so hard to teach but ya man dem are dunce
Don't learn when the shit happen
Burn when the clap em
This is not a perm, but you worms get a relaxin'
My reaction, only in a street fashion
I am not bulletproof- could get my melon
Splattered, So I stay ready, spread positive energy
But I know full well couple prars wanna bury me
No reason, just cause, that's the negativity
How could you be a nigga-not feelin' my delivery?
Lyrically, my ability, rippin' up killa's viciously
Spitter's that wanna mimic me
Stickin' them where the spirits be, huh
Pretty boy akala, move like a ape
Skinny, but ipush plates, like I'm fresh off a 8
Ah mate, so you relly shoulk sty in ya lane
Only spitter on my level got the same last name
