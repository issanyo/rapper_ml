[Verse 1:]
Gangster, The Revolutionary, A Rape Victim, Random Accident
Drug Addict, A Politician
Whatever our self, or worldly definition
We can’t escape the chariot of transition
Some characterise it as the judgement of the sinners
Others spiritualise it and they say: 'There is no difference.'
Energy ain’t created or destroyed it just changes form
Once we play the song the sound just travels on

[Chorus:]
Dark Corners
The Dark Corners are the place where we look death in the face
And we let it give us chase but it always gets away
Dark corners are the place where we’re running out of luck
And we cannot back it up. Death always catches up

[Verse 2]
As the needle plunged into the vein and blood was exchanged
For dosing around Afghan something was strange
This time the substance he injected was pure
Everything he had before had been cut never raw
Like all users he had used to make the pain disappear
And it was the only time in life that his mind had felt clear
He had struggled with the sickness ever since fourteen
When he remembered the hand that touched him understood what it means
After even longer struggle he finally got clean and met a girl that made it worth pursuing his dreams
They had plans to start a family with a wedding in June
He didn’t know he was so conventional but yeah it was true
So when the news came about Michelle he just lost it
Ran straight back to the same block where he used to cop it
His old connect came up in the world who’d supply a grade much higher
Went and he hit it straight fire
His skinny body went into shock and fell asleep
His brains forget to tell the lungs that he needed to breathe
Dark corners. Now he’s in them dark corners
When we hit them dark corners we can’t see
But dark corners

[Verse 3]
A good girl, a normal girl that was everybody’s view and though this annoyed her
She couldn’t deny that it was true
Whatever conventional was she was it
Grew up with both parents nice house in the Sticks
Though they had never been rich they certainly did prosper
Parents from Nigeria and both of them doctors
Church every Sunday, she had never missed a week ever
School she was top of the class yet they demanded better
Went straight to Cambridge, studying law
But had strange dreams of justice and helping the poor
Maybe that was part of why she chose him, didn’t know what in her mind
But he was clever and kind of a little troubled inside
Her parents wanted for her a nice Yoruba boy
So when they found out he was English they were slightly annoyed
But when they found out he was addicted to drugs it was too painful
Said they ‘wouldn’t come to the wedding it was totally shameful.’
Michelle left the house in a storm
It was a rainy night she never saw the truck before it ended her life
Her parents had decided that they would apologise
But they never got the chance in the end
We live on borrowed time and when them dark corners come
No, you cannot run
No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that’s right. When them dark corners come
No, you cannot run. No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun

[Chorus]
Dark Corners
The Dark Corners are the place where we look death in the face
And we let it give us chase but it always gets away
Dark corners are the place where we’re running out of luck
And we cannot back it up. Death always catches up

Dark Corners are the place where we look death in the face
And we let it give us chase but it always gets away
Dark corners are the place where we’re running out of luck
And we cannot back it up. Death always catches up

[Verse 4:]
Born of Old Money, yeah, born into wealth
But how well did he play with the cards he was dealt?
In his life on this Earth trip
The family confessed, even his father was slightly jealous of what he accomplished
Became an icon
Products became the symbols of the age
Each time they were released you should have seen all the craze
Seen as an innovator
The great creator but beneath all the shine and the sheen was the slave labour
And of course, there was that war they were funding to keep
The minerals flowing from the African Republic when the products they released
Ever came of the scrutiny
The scientist that authored the report disappeared
Thus, the message is clear, as power is old
It’s blood nourishes soil in which powerful grows
Power changes reality and this CEO had enough leverage that the media only painted him as gold
But despite all the wealth and the things that he owned
On his deathbed he couldn’t find comfort for his soul
All he could see is images of death [?]
Victims of mercenaries that this government had trained, died in a cold sweat
Drowned him in shame
Billions couldn’t buy him another day or numb the pain

[Chorus]
Dark Corners
The Dark Corners are the place where we look death in the face
And we let it give us chase but it always gets away
Dark corners are the place where we’re running out of luck
And we cannot back it up. Death always catches up
Dark Corners are the place where we look death in the face
And we let it give us chase but it always gets away
Dark corners are the place where we’re running out of luck
And we cannot back it up. Death always catches up
