[Verse 1]
It's my time like it or not gotta ride can't fight
This thing'll take you with it like a landslide
My mind spitting rhymes refined as old wines
No games since age 5 I hold mine
Never fell for the spells they tell in this world
I read Malcolm, you was learning to spell
I took exams early with the geeks in the school
Opened a business you were still chasing your balls
I spent my teens sticking but I'm one of Britain's best mathematicians
Official, I got the certificate
So however you want it kid we could do scholarship politics
Or the opposite
War with hollow tips No supathug, just I don't fear, why would I?
You bleed like me and breathe the same air
I got a purpose on this earth
And I ain't ready to go
So if I gotta send you first then let it be so

[Hook:]
Roll wid us or get rolled over [x3]
It's time now the wait is over
Roll wid us or get rolled over [x3]
It's time now the wait is over

[Verse 2]
It's bigger than the music
It's more like a movement
A unit of trueness spreading like rumors
They foolish, say I can't do it they doubt
Cause we acorns now just watch out for the tree that sprouts
When it does, remember I told you
I'm going from local to global
Poor and hopeful
From glueing back shoes
Cause they showing my toes through
To owning shoe companies and yards on the coastal
If you real grab on, I'm taking the fam with me
But hold on tight cause we movin real swiftly
Fakes can't stop my flight
Not your life that's like
Trying to fight atomic war with a knife
(can't do that)
Fight like mike with control not physically
If ignorance is bliss that explain my misery
I'm clear in my vision b, solve your mystery
Compete with me you get whitewashed like black history

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's not all gravy, man dem is shady
Tings is crazy but that don't phase me
It's not all gravy, man dem is shady
Tings is crazy but that don't phase me
Get yours, there's only one life to live
You gotta feed your kids, you gotta eat real big
Young soldier you can do whatever you want to
And no one out there can stop you
Not sure just watch me for practice
In these board meetings
Taking cheese off crackers
You actors are not factors
I see the bluff cause you sell crack
It does not mean that you're tough
It's the matrix and it's blatant you
Paper thugs are not ready yet
For getting unplugged
Grown man still talking like
You know who I am, where I'm from'
Bredren what the fuck are you on?
Telling the world who you shot
And what are you earning
When you get popped that will not stop it from burning
So it's worthless, you gots to be a soldier
Watch me grind you'll understand it as you get older
Nothing pretty but when I do things the job's over
Never stick at that critical moment, I'm potent
I'm focused, you jokers can't see me
I feel like a marksman at point blank it is too easy
