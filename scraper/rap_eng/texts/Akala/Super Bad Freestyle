[Ghetts]
Bad mother, shut your mouth
Even though I might die if I flood the drought
I'm Justin, you're just around
Shed light on the underground
Look, but don’t touch the crown
By the way, that’s Uncle Brown
A gyal dem a run me down, cuh
Ayy, look Stormz
This is soul baby
The kind of soul that gave Stella her groove back
The kind of flow that put the rhythm in 2Pac
8 years later
They’re saying Ghetto Gospel was ahead of its time
I'm like, duh
Tell ‘em I knew that
I’m Marty McFly with these albums, fam
And the new album be the almanac
Back to the future with it
I've got a MAC full of music in it
I go HAM and abuse the rhythm
Beast mode but you can see the beauty in it
Who are you when the moon's the limit?
Armstrong
Melvin to you baby boys
Your mother keeps my arms strong
Life's a bitch so I got a hard on
Leaving all the bozos banging over postcodes
But don’t own the house they live in
When you’re young, that’s almost acceptable
But not when you’re my age, so I ain't
Bang bang bangin’ bangin’ like M.I.A
Truth be told, I wouldn't mind moving home
I don’t wanna bring up my kid around here
I want a house in the suburbs
I grew up with mice running round in my cupboards
Hungry, you could hear the growl in my stomach
Mumsy, put some more cow in the oven
Mmmm, the table’s set
Back when I never had cable yet
John Loghbrough 20p bagles then
Now everybody want bread man
Cuh I get the bagles in

[Akala]
Red rum scorch MCs like desert sun
Better run my tongue is a better gun
Than any manufacturer, bone fracturer
When I come I come for blood just like Dracula
MC massacre,  spectacular
Can’t discuss when I bust rapid or thousand rhymes a minute
Drown the clown I’m with it
Round the town I’m spitting wild profounder lyrics
Down the sound and spirit
Not the malleable type still my soul's still flammable right?
I’m a cannibal animal still Hannibal right
I’m radical magical with my hand on the mic
I’m a lyrical miracle you're a spiritual criminal
Metaphysical syllable written by the invisible
In two ways there’s no pen yet I bet I
Stay with the force like Jedi
Left eye it’s for the best you will never win
Can’t comprehend my power like melanin
Nor settling with the militant breddren
I play by my own rules like the reverend
Reveling in the fact I got the gold medal in
Every Olympic rap there has better been
Best MC who don’t reckon him?
I am the start and the end like the reckoning
True king never Move fassi
On the front line with the troops like Selassie
Know who I is surname ain’t Bassi
Too much deo too much massi
Know what the ledge is
Truth like the color red is
No breathe ain’t the only thing dead is
Fellows I can’t relate my mind’s like Fela's
Fuck Champagne blood we rep for favellas
I just came back from Brazil and don’t feel the same
Don’t push us to kill, we still feel insane
YO! Run it


[Mic righteous]

I know the path that I chose to take
Know who my mates are make no mistake
I know this game is like an open race
You know how I roll and slow the pace
You know that I know you know the name
Couldn’t give a fuck if you show me hate
Tweetin’ about me oh behave
An O.G no im a O-G-A
Im an Ogre
I spell it my own way
I got the medicine as if I was peddling cocaine
I’m flames ima change his name to propane
Im a prick just came and deadded the whole game
With a mixtape he made back on ‘08
Write a rap that make you slap your own face
Man wake up and act your own age
Don’t make man go back to my old ways
Or I’m...
In a predicament a prick’ll wanna give it cos he thinkin' I be shittin' yeah but really I'mma switch
Didn't wanna do it but I done it before I did it
I’m in the woods for a good 20 minutes looking for a Brick
...Yeah prick
If words can't hurt im’a hit ‘em with this
Call up mister blitz
Like come finish the prick
Now you don’t want me to do that shit one more time
Fuck the feds fuck the judge fuck the jury
JK, when they free you I'mma greet you with a ?
Fuck the feds fuck the judge fuck the jury
Free Palestine, till they bleed me
