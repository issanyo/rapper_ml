[Verse 1: Akala]

In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue
Being the cunt he was, the genocide that ensued
Was half a millennia of permanent blood bath
Today we celebrate the rapist and his fucked up past
Decimate a native, leave him in our path
Death and destruction, we kick back and we just laugh
When the culture values dogs more than certain humans
It is certain it will come up with the worst solution
Decimation, erase a nation and proudly stating
Nowadays the language has change
But it's the same shit since the Nazi's did within Europe
What Europeans was only supposed to do to natives
The word "genocide" now carries a little weight with it
But we don't really mean it, a killer is our patriot
Ain't nothin' better than a resource theft
Ain't nothin' more sexy than black and brown death
We'll tell you what is comin' yeah we'll tell you what is next
Cause we've eaten here before, we're familiar with the chef
Hmm, what's cooking? The same dish, different dressing
The same priest, different confession
But will still give you a blessing yeah
A baptism in blood, in fact it was a flood
In fact it was some grub who packed triggers and mug
A whole nation, this is empire
The question is can we aspire to any higher?

[Hook: Amy True] x2
We're living through the fall of the empire
We're living through the fall of the empire
And we don't even know what is meant by it
And we don't even know what is meant by it

[Verse 2: Amy True]
See, any foundation that is built on greed
Raping and pillaging will never succeed
We're living in the age of information
Enslavement, call it colonisation
I call is straight piss taking
Call it money or lose your debt making
Breath taking, soul destroying, back breaking
Where they crack whips for fake staters
Our society is broken down
So I don't get a loan or credit cards
See that is out of bounds
Freezing all your assets, stopping any bank withdrawals
Read in to the future cause the past is shiowing many flaws
We are not collateral, we are something greater than
Take a stand, let's all take our money out of filthy banks
Mental evolution, no confusion built communities
Until my last breath, I won't stop until we all are free
Shouting People's Army, see I kow there's something blessed in me
Cause when it all falls down I know there's so much meant for we

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akala]
Colonise a savage take what isn't a land she inhabits
Then we justify it by claiming that we already had it
Cause who needs facts when we got force?
Who needs their own minerals, we'll just take yours
We ain't talking bout music when we say tours
Rape mothers and mother nature 'cause they both our whores
Tell our kids every day that crime don't pay
But there's no way we believe the bullshit we say
Cause it's clear as the light of day
The light is lighting up the way
Of those who trade in graves cause death does pay, yea
Supply arms to both sides in the fight
And if you ain't frightened you ain't paying attention to your alliance
I know something that we ain't learned
That, yea, maybe hell is real and one day they'll burn
But in the meantime, sure they'll earn
Till their empire's done and another one gets its turn

[Hook]

[Outro: Akala]
It's over, the fall
It's over
