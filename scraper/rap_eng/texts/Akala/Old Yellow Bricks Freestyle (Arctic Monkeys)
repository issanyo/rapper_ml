Red rum scorch MCs like desert sun
Better run my tongue is a better gun
Than any manufacturer, bone fracturer
When I come I come for blood just like Dracula
MC massacre, the word spectacular
Can’t discuss when I bust rapid; a thousand rhymes a minute
Drown the clown I’m with it
Round the town I’m spitting wild profound lyrics
Down the sound and spirit
Not the malleable type is my soul still flammable right?
I’m a cannibal animal still Hannibal right
I’m radical magical with my hand on the mic
I’m a lyrical miracle you're a spiritual criminal
Metaphysical syllable written by the invisible
In two ways there’s no pen yet I bet I
Stay with the force like Jedi
Left eye it’s for the best you will never win
Can’t comprehend my power like melanin
Nor settling with the militant breddren
I play by my own rules like the reverend
Revelling in the fact I got the gold medal in
Every Olympic rap there has ever been
Best MC who don’t reckon him?
I am the start and the end like the reckoning
True king never move fassy
On the front line with the troops like Selassie
Know who I is surname ain’t Basil
Too much deo too much massive
Know what the ledge is
Truth like the colour red is
No breathe ain’t the only thing dead is
Fellows I can’t relate my mind’s not Othello’s
Fuck Champagne blood we rep for favellas
Though I’ve never been to Brazil I still feel the pain
What would push you too kill it’s when you feel insane
Was it sane when a strain came out?
Get your brain blown out
Brain blown out
Chips or clips the things bussin
One brings laugh other brings nothing
But destruction I’m cutting up the track like it’s nothing
Serve up the whole thing up diced like mutton
Glutton on the mic never had a full stomach
Never left a scrap from the plate of my mothers
And my brother like no other I fuck a track no rubber
Give me something if you're bad then sucka
Disease is shookin me
Won’t even look at me
I am the thing like a dreadman’s cookery
Soul just simmer, hope not a glimmer
I play like the taxman only one winner
In this world there’s only one sinner
Anybody who speaks truth is a glimmer
So don’t be surprised if I don’t make playlists
Cause I don’t minstrel dance or paint faces
Tell me the industry is not racist
Our society is so let’s face it
But one thing profound to me
Music the only thing that know no boundaries
So if you love music then raise up your fist in the air
And roll with the movement
Black or white man or woman
Anyone who respects the work we put in
See these dudes are like no dinner with just pudding
Yeah you sweet but no substance put in
The fuel that you put in: energy you get back
Give me the whole stack and sets I will rep that
Check facts I’m the best out molest raps
Trash tracks well it’s tact till it’s slack
Necks snap when I check cash whose chest fat
Better foundation fuck because it let’s crap
Absorb like white into jet black
You came for connect four, I came for a chess match
Which means we don’t think similar
You score but you got no skill, Lineker
Lay low better halo than Diego
It’s like this just cause I say so
You nothing just like Play D’oh
Mould to whoever you're with I can’t take those
They mimic me, can't mirror me
I am the metaphor they’re just similes
They mimic me, can't mirror me
I am the metaphor they’re just similes
