Right here dangerous idea
If we did this then we couldn't feel fear
If there's no fear there's no control
If there's no control someone's gotta let go
They say I Shouldn't say too much they might delete me
Realize I don't really care about tv
Keep your awards your applause I'm easy
All I can do in this life is just be me
Pilger can say it so can Niomi Kline
Its free speech for them that's fine
Young black rapper should utter the same words
Utterly absurd nutter insane nerd
Even the fact I call myself 'black'
Social conditioning and that's a fact
The idea of races has no factual basis
It was made just to serve racists
To justify to doing to some what couldn't be done
To others but they all are our sons
Black or white all of our sons
Muslim Christian all of our sons
Look up in the sky that's all of our Sun
Last time I checked we only had one
So if some were superior
Others inferior based on exterior
Well then surely the sun would know and fall in to line'
It would rain on your crops and not mine'
Air would prefer to inhabit your lungs'
Food would prefer the taste of your tongue'
If that's not the case then nature has declared
Despite what we say the worlds in fact fair

Chorus:
Kids in Iraq
Yours and my children
Kids in Iran
Yours and my children
Afghanistan
Yours and my children
Even Sudan
Yours and my children
Kids in brazil
Yours and my children
Police drive by the favela and just kill them
Kids in brazil
Yours and my children
Police drive by the favela and just kill them
Right here dangerous idea
If we did this then we couldn't feel fear
If there's no fear there's no control
