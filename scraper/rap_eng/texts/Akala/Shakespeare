[Verse 1:]
Nigga listen
When I spit on the riddem, I kill em
Raw like the Ball of Brazilians
You don't want war, cor, the kids brilliant
Blood, I'm the heir to the throne, not William
Akala, smart as King Arthur, darker, harder, faster
Raasclaat, I kick the Illa shit
It's like Shakespeare, with a nigga twist
Lyricist, I'm the best on the road
Nitro flow, oh-so-cold, I'mma blow yo
Keep the hoes, I only want dough homes
Nobody close, I'm alone in my own zone
No no love for the po-po
Loco when I rock mics solo
I hope that you know, where you dun go though?
Want it with Bolo? Must be coco
It's William back from the dead, but I rap bout gats and I'm black instead
It's Shakespeare, reincarnated, except I spit flows and strip hoes naked
No fakin'-test my blood bruv
Its William, back as a thug cuz
So real the shit I kick now
Plus I don't write, I recite my shit now
Straight from the top, expert timin'
On top of that, now the whole things rhymin'
No more tights, now jeans saggin'
If I say so myself, I'm much more handsome
Don't ever compare me to rappers
I'm so quick-witted that I split 'em like fractions
My shit, I tell em like this
It's like Shakespeare with a nigga twist

[Chorus:]
I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts, blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybes
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies
Pumped up, feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts, blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies

[Verse 2:]
I'm similar to William, but a little different
I do it for kids that's illiterate, not Elizabeth
Stuck on the road, faces screwed up
Feel like the world spat 'em out, and they chewed up
It's a matrix, I try and explain it
On a real though still ready to blaze 'em, no contradiction
Just face it, they so enslaved, they worse than a agent
I grace stages, sharp as razors
Don't get cut cuz, keep ya distance
No artillery, tryna' be militant
Y'all dudes killin' me, think that ya killin' it
It's embarrassing watchin' you babblin'
Keep spittin ya darts, mines is javelins
The hood Tiger Woods too milly
Number 1 for so long, its just getting' silly
Shit kinda like Bruce wit da knuckles
Like the first time ya ever saw Ali shuffle
You don't trouble, left layin in a puddle
Bruv you are havin' a bubble
I'm a whole different kettle of fish
Thou shall not fuck with 'dis
My shit, I tell em like this
It's like Shakespeare with a nigga tiwst

[Chorus]
I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts, blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybes
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies
Pumped up, feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybes
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies

[Verse 3:]
To be fair, no MC close to the man
Little just come youts jumpin' out of they pram
Everybody badman, behind a mic stand
It's not creative, one bag of hype, and
If you buss your ting, where's the mash?
Move so much food? Where's the cats?
These dudes ain't real, they just rap
I don't spit what I don't know, just the facts
No talks of rocks I ain't sold, shots I ain't blown
My business ridiculous, sick with it, quick witted
Companies head to head and I liquidate it
Welcome to illa state, meet ya fate mate
Talk truth but we don't play games
Move sick, look, sample techno
Never pull a ting, if it ain't gonna let go
That's that, rap track
Clap ya like a black gat
Back chat, crack back, I'm the nigga, that's that
The rest of these kids is irrelevant
Don't compare me to him, that's just beggin' it
I'm on my own shit, dicks ain't spit
Its no democracy, dictatorship
So dicks hate my shit
I'm sick, raise ya spliff
I'm swift, blaze em quick
My hits, major shit
I flip phrases quick
My sick razor shit
Give thick grazes quick
And chicks say he's Chris
It's not a rumour
That kid Akala, it;s not "Ack-a-la", beg ya pardon
Don't get it twisted
Your on the sideline like a mistress
I'm the whizzkid, with the sick shit
My shit, I tell em like this
It's like Shakespeare, with a nigga twist

[Chorus]
I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts, blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybes
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies
Pumped up, feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybes
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies
