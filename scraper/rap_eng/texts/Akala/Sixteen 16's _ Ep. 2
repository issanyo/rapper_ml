[Akala : Verse 1]

Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness
Those words uttered by the owners of people
Problem with being an oppressor
Talkin’ about freedom
Is the people you oppress may start to believe you
And act on the words you say
And make the owner way
How can such noble thoughts come from a wicked source
Of course
It gives me cause to think
Are the words even worth the cost of the ink?
If they change their meaning when the powerful say
So we can fight for freedom even the freedom to own slaves
These words these prostitutes with no standard
That sell themselves to anyone who can utter the language
And get fucked by the highest bidder
So the life is bitter for most
We can all toast to the glam and glitter
And go ham on twitter
And instagram a picture
But can't stop the police from executing
…children
