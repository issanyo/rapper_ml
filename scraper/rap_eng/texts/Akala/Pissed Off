[Verse 1: Akala]
True Words are never beautiful
Beautiful words are never true
Every truly clear thing
Need never prove
If it is not enough, it will probably never do
Ever feel like someone lives your life but it is never you?
You? Not knowing if coming, going or flowing
Every door that you open
A key to another one that's broken
Every word that is spoken
Somebody else's poem
And the more that we focus
The less we ever seem to notice
It's like the sound of the letterbox early in the morning
But you know it's nothing good
Just a red letter warning
Sucking every penny that we got
'Til we ain't got a pot left
All this pressure on my back
Do we want it off off off? YES!

[Hook: Akala]
Do you feel pissed off just like me?
Do you feel pissed off just like me?
Do you feel pissed off just like me?
I got an idea just why that might be

[Bridge 1: Akala]
We touch it, we taste it, we take a sip
We breathe it, we need it, it invades our lips
We hold it, we own it, it controls our grip
It's something, it's nothing
It's just how we live
I can't call it
It's something with how we live
I can't call it
It's something with how we live
I can't call it
It's something with how we live
It's something, it's nothing
It's just how we live

[Verse 2: Akala]
True Words are never beautiful
Beautiful words are never true
What is your view?
Blessings or curses, are never ever few?
The man with no mind
The one who will never choose
The skin with no feeling is the one that will never bruise
We can't feel it, we touch it, we taste it, we breathe it
We peel it, eat it, believe it, we feed it
Heed it, we need it, defeat it?
Won't even meet it
To beat it you have to seek it
Cheat it? You just release it
Beneath it you get the secret
It's not real
Guns don't kill, the people behind them do
All the ism, schisms, divisions, if you decide it's true
They are doing nothing, shit
Just what they're designed to do
Look close enough at your enemy
And you will find it's you

[Hook & Bridge 1:Akala]

[Verse 3: Akala]
True Words are never beautiful
Beautiful words are never true
The liar is the only one in the world that is never true
Fly all over the world but never move
The only vehicle he have, we never use
Talk a lot about dreams but never do
Is this just me and you?
Stuck in this position
Wishing we even had a mission
And wouldn't spend 40 years barely chasing a living
Job that we hate with a dying soul
Boss that we'd like to strangle slow
The partner we live with we don't even know
Because the man in the mirror is just another freak show
Stand like a pillar but what do we hold?
Have a lot of things but what do we really own?
Absolutely nothing
We're just bluffing the entire show
All of our discussions
And our fussing over the price of Gold
Should we be reminded that a Diamond is just crushing coal?
And they don't own it
It's we that make up the motive
They are not giants, just notice
They only stand on our shoulders, shit
And they don't own
It's we that make up the soldiers
They are not giants, just notice
They only stand on our shoulders

[Hook 2: Akala]
Do you feel pissed off just like me?
Do you feel pissed off just like me?
Do you feel pissed off just like me?
I've got an idea why the fuck that might be

[Bridge 2: Akala]
We feel that we are not in control of our own lives
We see that we are not in control of our own lives
We taste that we are not in control of our own lives
It's clear that we are not in control of our own lives
But we are more in control, then we could ever know
But we are more in control, then we could ever know
But we are more in control, then we could ever know
The steering wheel is right there, just grab a hold
