The faceless people
The faceless people
The faceless people
The faceless people

We are the faceless people you don't ever see
We are the faceless people you don't wanna be
We are the faceless people you don't ever see
We are the faceless people, people

As the world turns, so does my head
I need a little leg just to butter my bread
Gets a little bitter but I've gotta get fed
Never been a quitter so I've gotta get ahead
I am the invisible man, you can't be me
I am the invisible man, you can't see me
I am the invisible man but I'm 3D
Come and meet me, Mr. Invisible

We are the faceless
We are the faithfuless
Here today, tomorrow we're gone
But nothing is wrong
It's the same song, we're invisible
Nothing can change us
Or rearrange us
We come and we go but nobody knows
And nobody shows
We ain't nobody, we're invisible
We are the faceless people, people
We are the faceless people, people

We are the faceless people you don't ever see
We are the faceless people you don't wanna be
We are the faceless people you don't ever see
We are the faceless people you don't wanna be

As the world turns, so does my head
I need a little leg just to butter my bread
It's a little bitter but I've gotta get fed
And I've never been a quitter so I've gotta get ahead
I'm your worst teacher
Your favorite student
Frivolous spender, your saving is foolish
Lads on a bender, come on let's do this
I'm the pretender but I speak trueness

We are the faceless
We are the faithfuless
Here today, tomorrow we're gone
But nothing is wrong
It's the same song, we're invisible
Nothing can change us
Or rearrange us
We come and we go but nobody knows
And nobody shows
We ain't nobody, we're invisible
We are the faceless people, people
We are the faceless people, people

Can't you see what is happening to us here
We are tearing apart tryna keep it near
Can't you see what's happening to us here, my dear...
I don't wanna wake up feeling like a wasteaway
I'm gonna save it for another rainy day
I wanna raise these stakes in the game I play
But I can feel it all slipping out my way
Because I am the invisible man, you can't see me
Being the invisible man is not easy
I am the invisible man but I'm 3D
Can't beat me, Mr. Invisible

We are the faceless
We are the faithfuless
Here today, tomorrow we're gone
But nothing is wrong
It's the same song, we're invisible
Nothing can change us
Or rearrange us
We come and we go but nobody knows
And nobody shows
We ain't nobody, we're invisible
We are the faceless people, people
We are the faceless people, people
