[Verse 1: Akala]

I was six years old when I first heard Public Enemy
I knew in an instant me and hip-hop was meant to be
Shivers down my spine
Hearing a rhyme
Goosebumps on my skin
And the feeling within
All the pain and the rage that the music was cathartic for
You probably wouldn't know if you ain't seen the hardships before
Maybe you would, maybe that's the beauty of it
Anyone, anywhere relate to the topic
Wu-Tang came out with Shaolin philosophy
Bit of martial arts and some fruit from the knowledge tree
And hood tales, you know, poverty, robbery
Where childhood friends die for not much, probably
Felt they made their songs for my ears and fears
Cos boys like me were not allowed to cry tears
So here's a couple bars for them pioneers
Without you, you know we wouldn't be here
