The words it's impossible and I can't
Should never be uttered because they just aren't
True, we just gotta' let go
Whoever saw the baby that said it couldn't grow
Or the river that said it couldn't flow
Get in and have a go
Come along have a role
But it seems we sow only seeds of doubt
Just in our head yet we can't pick them out
And what do the sprout? Fear and arrogance
Same thing … do with extravagance
Feel better or worse, than anyone here
Either way still the cause is fear
I am the enemy and I'm the ally
Past the pauper and the Prince now can I
See I'm the cause and the source of the greed
All I ever think is me, me, me
My Ambition, My life, My belly
My radio, My car, My telly
My meditation, My hurt
My Temple, My Mosque, My Church
Look now at my technology
But I can't make a blade of grass
Oh, no please reassure
Me the somehow I am more
That is the crutch that I need for my balance
Comparisons how I define my talents
Conquer the World with my sword, my falace
Decorate my cotch', make it look like a palace
A cage may be golden, still a cage
What do I mean? Let me explain
Divisions of race and class in these prisons
Make us feel better, but it ain’t really living
Kinda' like aspirin the numbs the pain
But don't deal with the cause
So nothing ever change
I still feel empty, I still feel envy
Having nothing though, I steal plenty
Those we applaud and laud as our gentry
Look back through the course of the centuries
Call it history
Bother to record it
But all it is, is the wars that we thought in
Who we have hated and stripped naked
Which places, enslavement
Draw on a pavement, call it a nation, give us a flag
What happened to the way you
Split us into factions, factions, captions
Give us a distraction
Lights, Camera, Action
Give me an Oscar
Now I'm important
More than a Doctor
You know the circus, make you're self worthless
TV makes us more than a person
Give me a badge, I'm an authority
And I have the right to protect property
But not people, that's far too dangerous
What happens to privilege, if their the same as us
But the real question that puzzles philosophers
Is there another way that we don't feel shit
Or is this it?
Just a bunch of misfits
For what it's worth, here's my two p
I think the worlds perfect, life is brilliant
The only thing wrong, is our own ignorance
Can't describe the beauty, the mystery
Don't subscribe to beauty, that is misery
Hard is for us, it's what’s obvious
It's obvious were independent, but that don't bother us
Obvious
We keep killing
No matter what nature keeps giving
Things keep growing and the earth keeps spinning
What don't compete is the only thing winning
Obvious that men are intermediated by women
But it's obvious that women have greater power within em'
With that said it's two sides of a coin
Ying and the Yang like twins conjoined
It's obvious people can't create wealth
Only thing we destroy is ourself
And the self is the hardest thing to believe in
It's obvious to see that they keep deceiving
Obvious that we live lives with no meaning
Obvious that we forgot to keep dreaming
Like we did when kids went playing
That is the truth, forget what I'm saying
So dream
But don't dream for more cash
Dream for the vision to see that your rich
Don't dare dream for a better tomorrow
Dream in the moment, or it's just hollow
Dream for whatever, Dream to be clever
Dream, Dream Jimmy and Bob made an album together
Dream for whatever, Dream to be clever
Dream, Dream Jimmy and Bob made an album together
Dreams are just dreams when we dream together
Dream Jimmy and Bob made an album together
Dream forever
