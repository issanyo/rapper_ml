Next I snap it, flex like magic
? deifying death I won't have it sonny
So hungry with his full stomach eat till I vomit MC shits running
Poison in my intestines, it ain't as pure as me, but I still digest(?)the food will be a return of my investment
That's what I seek know the seeds you grow and you will reap
Me the speaker, preacher, teacher Demon in the night with the right to right demons
I'm quite keen ? since I was white semen
Seems I'm making something but my life's like dreaming
Elite MC known for many reasons sobbed to common MC like I went to Eton
But I went to the school of Rakim, KRS1 and Shaolin I came out of 12 stage Dan
Took a ? whole of japan with my bare hands and my next plan put an MC back in their pram
Fam did I mention there's enough chi in one of my sentence to ascend him into a higher dimension
Give away a 16 every single week in the run up to the album quite peak
More spare bars coming the energy I summon it ain't never running out
You ain't last 2 summers you pass through stunners
Spit a little bar and you think you ready for class that we duppy you're hardy a puppy
Harder than yuppy? you ain't never felt it this hard in your stomach
16 16's done
Knowledge is power coming soon cuz
Let have a little fun have a little run
Struggle in a sentence is heavy on the tongue
Done
