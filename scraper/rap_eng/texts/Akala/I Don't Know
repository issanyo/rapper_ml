Verse 1
They say ignorance is bliss
Never a truer word spoke
Half the answers only bring more questions that we’ll never know
Even the wise man knows he don’t know much
Still not wise enough to accept it as such
So we chase the questions seeking direction
Every time we think we’re right get a swift correction
Whether Muslim or Jew really don’t matter which
You can’t buy tomorrow no matter how rich
We all bleed and breathe and take shits
And chase the same answers
Though some think are better equipped
But with all the test tubes and test and so-called best
They still don’t know
A theory is just a posh word for a guess
Because you’re in a skyscraper don’t make you different
From those in huts along the Amazon
And not more significant
We’re all the same all rise all fall
But those on high horses have the furthest to fall

Chorus
The moon and the stars
Fast women and cars
Is this world truly ours?
Or are we just entertainment
Chasing it all we rise and we fall
Said I don't know
The moon and the stars
Fast women and cars
Is this world truly ours?
Or are we just entertainment
Chasing it all we rise and we fall
Said I don't know

Verse 2

They say ignorance is bliss never believe it
Those who don’t learn from history are condemned to repeat it
Truth you gotta seek it, wherever its hidden
Or else you’ll find yourself dancing to someone else's rhythm
Mental prison is the worst kind
You can take my liberty but my mind is mine
Whatever they controlling, never let your brain close in
The mind is like a parachute, it only works when it’s open
Smoking gun but they say they never shoot
No such thing as a fruit without root
Truth not being told will never make it go away
A lie told a thousand times can never take it’s place
They say it’s fate, but take a proper view
They’re trying to hold so many destiny’s in their hands
They’re bound to drop a few
So the more we keep moving, the better chance we got
Everybody knows a rolling stone gathers no moss

Chorus

Verse 3

They say ignorance is bliss, well I ain’t got a clue
All you gotta do is whatever that works for you
But when 6 billion individuals looking out for number 1
And we got to share the same sun
That’s when the troubles come
That brings us back to where we started
Face to face with the cold-hearted facts
That there are no answers
My head all of this chit-chat
I don’t even smoke
But I’ma go have a spliff and just kick back

Chorus

Outro
You know, don’t ask me
I’m not a prophet
I’m not the answer
I’m just a rapper
A little boy from North London
What you’ve heard for the last 40 minutes
It’s my opinion
My thoughts, my feelings
It’s not right, it’s not wrong
It’s just what it is
It’s just Akala
