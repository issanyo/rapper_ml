[Verse 1]
A rope tightens breath constricted
No hand pulls this is self-inflicted
Sickness self diagnosed without witness
Wish list grip fist the beggary of riches
A belly full fights never willingly
An empty stomach does not have the energy to finish it
Layers in between padded by a dream
Stretching for the means
Without thought of exhausting the seams
No space for indignity on the face of simplicity
A taste of sufficiency's a belly full of lethargy
A dash of apathy a pinch of extacy's a recipe
Serving up a feast for the beast of our treachery
Not sure if your getting me celebrity's are effigy
I hear just fine but I'm deaf to those next to me
Conflict it perplexes me
Cause out biggest battle
Is now we're so free that we choose to be shackled

[Hook]
I'm stuck freedom lasso

[Verse 2]
This invisible strain of the human stain
Colors every brain, vein
Thus chained to another's pain
We may not be the artist by we surely are the frame
We may just be the smoke but we cannot blame the flame
Strange is the fruit that nourishes not the vein
Yet we are odder still for we seek it like the rain
Nothing bounds out path yet we march perfect in lane
Whoever saw a tiger that desired to be tamed?
Reality defies nature does not know surprise
Yet the lesion of our season blinds even the eagle's eyes
Spies dread not headlock tight as thread knot
Get lost why throw a bone to a dead dog?
This is not charity that is just sarcasm
That's why we bite so hard and never bark at em
Spark at em's insane
It's play gather and prey
When even the mighty tiger
He desires to be tamed

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They act as if it's positive
Though it's so obviously derogative
And even if you're bobby
This is never your prerogative
It's obvious we're warriors
And crooked just like bobby is
But colleges and mockeries
Will never make a socrates
Apologies and robberies
They follow with atrocity
Sorrow and hypocrisy
Don't make very good crockery
Watchin' this it's horror bliss
And one day I will promise this
The day the tiger wakes
That is the day of your apocalypse
