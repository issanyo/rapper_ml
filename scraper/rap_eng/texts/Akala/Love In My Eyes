[Verse 1]
Remember when I met you?
Heart went racing
But I won't chase I was in a strange place then
Faking, what on my face was blatant
You could be mine but I'm scared of the taking
Pacing, I was not used to the waiting; contemplating
And I'm not talking about consummating
Just conversation, let alone debating
All the time in the world is all we've got and there's no need for waiting
All the thoughts in my mind of what we could find got me anticipating
Right now we're just friends and I like how we're shaping
Plus I need time for the doubts that I'm facing
Not about you, it's me who needs changing
Look on my face you'll see that I'm gazing

But life is no oasis
And soon things got complicated
So I jumped ship, real quick
'Cause I hit ship, sink and I really cannot take it
'Cause I've never been here before
In fact no where near before
I don't quite know
But I feel it from my afro to my big toe
It's not working and I need my space
Plus I gotta deal with this bullshit case
So we parted ways and it felt real strange
Didn't get much done with my days
How will we ever see eye to eye?
I don't agree with myself even half the time
Then it dawned on me, it's never plain sailing
You can't succeed if you're afraid of failing

All the time in the world is all we have
And there's no need for racing
All the thoughts on my mind of what we could find got me anticipating
Right now we're best friends and I like how we're shaping
Plus I got over the doubts I was facing
Couldn't change time but time had me changing
Now on my face you'll see when I'm gazing
