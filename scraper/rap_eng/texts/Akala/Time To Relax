[Verse 1]

This ain’t a song, it’s more like a note to self
A reminder to me that I need balance
‘cause I’m always working, plannin’ projects and preppin’
Stressin’ over the state of this world and how we affect it
This is part of the gift, the energy that I’m blessed with
But if you overuse them, then you will blunt your own weapons
How ever much you train, muscles only grow when you rest ‘em
Yet I don’t make enough time to stop and pause for reflection
Go and check my mum, talk about nothing much
On a sunny day, sit in the park, stare at the sun
Feed the ducks, ride a bike, shit sit in a tree
Anything to escape the stress that the city will breed
Lucky enough, that what I love is my livin’
I know that that’s rare so chillin’ just feels like sinnin’
But it’s not, take your time, you ain’t gotta say sorry
If you’re always exhausted, you can’t help anybody

[Chorus]

Through all the work and the wages, bills and the tax
Through all the stress and the payments and the [?]
Through all the loss and the gain and the pain we attach
Through all the stress and the strain that came with the facts
We gotta kick back, make time to relax
Gotta kick back, make time to relax
Gotta kick back, make time to relax
Kick back, make time to relax

[Verse 2]

You’re not paranoid, things really are designed
To offer you absolutely no peace of mind
Maybe that’s the price to be paid ‘cause we’re complicit in suffering all over this world that we are living in
Cars and the clothes, everything we consume
Still painted in the suffering of colourful hues
So we’re tainted by the nothingness of what we’ll choose
But overwhelmed by the lack of change if we refuse
So we all watch the so called news
And see their views of a bunch of mass murderers paraded as true
Enough to turn any thinking person to a lunatic
Maybe thats what we already are ‘cause we are used to it
But in the midst of all this
There’s a bliss that you’re missing
Silent moments, one that you love quietly kissin’
Starin’ at the stars, realising that ours is just a world among billions of worlds that we’ll never know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Just take a moment to breathe, is what I’m sayin’
Breathe deep till the air in your chest is all the way in
Let it out slowly, feel the tension erodin’
Listen to the music [?] before you compose it
Just take a moment to breathe and take stock
You ain’t that important, wars will not stop if you do not
But health and longevity depends on balance between yin and yang
And so far I just haven’t
Made enough time to breathe and just chill
Keep still
They ain’t lyin’ when they say stress kills
So breathe before you punch someone in the mouth
Breathe deep before you push out and tear down the house
Breathe before you hurt yourself and your health
Maybe cliché but it really is our true source of wealth
Breathe - essence of life and of the universe
We’ve done it from birth yet we doubt that it really works

[Chorus]
