[Akala]
My artillery's full to the brim
With a criminal syllable peel back skin
It's a sin, more than a loss or win
If you take on him I will break your kin
With the words i'm ashame him
Cos with the words i'm a shaman
Spiritual mind elevation
Back through time on the back of the rhyme
Shackles align through back of my spine
Capturing rhyme all the facts in the line
And the timing is frighting, i'm brighter than lightning
Not a man, a character from a movie
I chew through metal while my hand breaks Uzis
Who's these floozies?
Claiming they wanna slew me
Do what you you gotta do G
I quite like fighting i've made that clear
Take your career and replace it with tears
The Shakespeare is here i take fear and peer
Into the hearts of men and show you they're cowards
But I never allow em, i'm sending them flowers
Like five man on earth that can rap with this shower
Capture, empower, in fact i'm a tower
My roots go 10 miles down in the earth
How you gonna knock man down?
Silly little clown, when you got a dig down first
Who wants what with he kid i'm the best
I don't mean it in jest like most rappers do
Do yourself a favour look back through the albums
Mixtapes, and tell me who
Has been so consistent with blistering speed
Resisting the system not captive to creed
Put things over a person
Verbally i'm worser than the most of the worst of em
Put a hearse on em, see how it looks
Put a verse on em, see if he shook
Worse than a crook, see the words that i took from their language
I mangle more man that banners starred spangled
Cos i'm a vandal
You look dumber than man wearing socks with their sandals
Some man still do it tho, no shame
Us man still slew it tho, no strain
Who said you'll go through with no pain
They should have told you it is no gain
The A with the A with the A with the A
And i stay every day every day every day
Cos i'm harder than Bane was, Fuck Batman!
Some prick just defending the system
You all know my name cuz, we attack man
Get moved along like blacks out of Brixton
Fact not fiction, practice my diction
Rip these pricks like zips when you'r zips (?)
If I catch you, stiff as a statue
Pain is too much for you to react to, so you just freeze
I don't really mind, i'm pleased
Better than your talk just breeze, jheeze
You don't wanna ramp with these
Siamese flows cos i'm stuck to the beat
Chief, you don't really know that's its peak
The flows so cold better hold your receipt
And take that back back, when you sold crap crap
When ya hit back back, akala is back back
The world so gully, they could all rap about books
Still have the hood go bap bap, fam
It ain't that ive seen the strap stuff, i see the bigger picture of where we are trapped at
A junction, a function, people are munching on our flesh
Cos were meat for the luncheon
So i punch them, ones that come with assumptions
That i won't rumble for lunches
Im hungry, i'm starving, bones i am munching
Fuck crews im taking on countries
Why bring your rap to a nuclear war fight?
Give it 2 sec, be dead like your hype
10 years and ive been round the world twice
Why am i lying? like 10 times
And i bend rhymes lines, to ascend minds
And i'm 10 times guys that your friends hype
Yes im the best and im blessed ,so don't test
Who ever questing whether knowledge is power, are you fucking deaf?
