[Intro: Akala]
Truth
Who knows it?
Definitely not me
And they say they do?
They ain't said shit
Look at their attitudes

[Verse: Akala]
Who Knows what the truth is
Cos when im stupid enough to claim the exclusive
Rights on nulling of the facts, bullshit
Its just another attack, causing
You to be pushed to the back, move it
If you accept that you lack, prove it
Skill's of your own
Are you groaning
Your tone
In your phone
Gonna add your pay to poem? homes?
Accept my definition
Of yourself then your in my prison
Whos reality's
Gradually
Having me
Casually
Can you fathom the insanity
Of believing the truth is held by a few
And it ain't me or you
Ain't no truths just points of view
If it ain't known then is it still true
And If God made scriptures?
Can you tell me?
What language did she write in?
And if she picked one, out of the thousands?
How is that enlightening
For those that dont speak the language
How they gonna understand it?
Or is god that underhanded
That he'd act just about as dumb as man is
People just wanna feel important
Reporting ideas of the truth extorting
Those without nothing are the ones that brought in
Look at religion its almost deporting
Hard to admit that the world we're brought in
We ain't got a clue what the fuck the force is
That makes uncountable stars in the cosmos
Easy like a painter doing odd jobs
Accept that we dont know whats what
All gonna die anyway so whats lost
Good, bad, heaven, hell
Just ideas that are sold so well
By all the people with power and privilege
To trap us in fear, living like invalids
C'mon look at the BASTARDS like
Telling you to wait for the afterlife
They Ain't gotta live with half the strife
Fuck turn the other cheek, hardest strike
For anyone that tries to take your power
And use it in their way selfish
Nah,  fuck these cowards
You're as divine as anybody else is
Anyone that tries to trouble your loved ones
That is the time and the place that you can buss guns
Numb fucks livin' off trust funds
Got us down hear struggling for nuff crumbs
People end up dumb, killing over lump sums
Look how quickly we become accustom
To picture the paper that's pretty
The price of a tenant to live in the city
Life were defending has ever been shitty
They write all the endings and never been with me

Look what they feed us, leaders
Prophets a profit, think that they're Jesus
Did Jesus ask for a church collection?
Or drive a rolls royce with a turbo engine?
Lines in my voice and the words i mention?
Inspired by choice that of false pretension?
Blinded by noise of the poise of pension
Sang with my boys we are music henchmen (?)
See? the truth i mention
Beyond my own comprehension
See? the truth i mention
Beyond my own comprehension
