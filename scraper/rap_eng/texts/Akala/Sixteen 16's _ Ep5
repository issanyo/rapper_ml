[Verse 1 : Akala]

Gordon Bennet, I’m flabbergasted
Smart bastard, so bloody clever that it’s just retarded
I don’t recite my charges, nor my type of garments
Tryna hype the hardests like half of these spineless bastards
Who’s the rhyming artist
My timin I have harnessed
I’m shinin’ blinding partners the finest you find in varnish
It’s my time regardless
If I should die with martyrs
Know that I was old school like Jamaican partners
But I’m ahead of my time and the energy I harness
Brilliant and like equivalent to 4 million karmas
My brain power’s insane power I’ve never charted
Yet I’m known around the world for cremating carcass
Of these half baked emcees that think they’re masters
But they ain't nothing but a scam, like the naija pastors
Go preaching to the people, but listen harder
And you will hear that it’s just bollocks like I am the dog’s
