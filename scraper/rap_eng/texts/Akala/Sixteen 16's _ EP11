[verse 1 : Pompous Peterson]

So disc jockey, play the beat, the one by the...R-Z-A
For that chap Method Man...Bring the pain I believe it was

This week, we offered our condolences
To a Muslim, with a beard, some say that’s strange
But they don’t understand the way that we played the game
We don’t care about religion, what’s in a name
As long as you pump oil for us keep the price cheap
You can behead who you want the deal’s quite sweet
Help us to bomb other Arabs from the military bases we have in your lands
But you don’t have in ours
We’ll give you Rolls Royce’s, yes flashy cars
Pay you billions of pounds yes, we’ll make you stars
A reformer, quite enlightened, funding the terrorism that we claim to be fighting
So its only right that we fly the flags at half mast
Send the prime minister over seas to kiss your ass
Who said hypocrisy they don’t know the rules
Democracy is just a bloody word sentimental fools!
Uncle Pompous!
