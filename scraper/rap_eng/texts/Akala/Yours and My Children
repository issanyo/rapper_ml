[Verse 1]
Right here, dangerous idea
If we did this, then we couldn't feel fear
If there's no fear, there's no control
If there's no control, someone's gotta let go
They say I shouldn't say too much they might delete me
Realize I don't really care about TV
Keep your awards, your applause I'm easy
All I can do in this life is just be me
Pilger can say it, so can Naomi Klein
Its free speech for them, that's fine
Young black rappers should utter the same words
Utterly absurd, nutter, insane, nerd
Even the fact I call myself black
Social conditioning and that's a fact
The idea of races has no factual basis
It was made just to serve racists
To justify to doing to some what couldn't be done
To others, but they all are our sons
Black or white all of our sons
Muslim, Christian all of our sons
Look up in the sky that's all of our Sun
Last time I checked we only had one
So if some were superior, others inferior, based on exterior
Well then surely the sun would know and fall in to line?
It would rain on your crops and not mine?
Air would prefer to inhabit your lungs?
Food would prefer the taste of your tongue?
If that's not the case then nature has declared
Despite what we say the worlds in fact fair?

Kids in Iraq
Yours and my children
Kids in Iran
Yours and my children
Afghanistan
Yours and my children
Even Sudan
Yours and my children
Kids in Brazil
Yours and my children
Police drive by the favela and just kill them
Kids in Brazil
Yours and my children
Police drive by the favela and just kill them

[Verse 2]
Problem is, it feels better to feel better
And reap without sowing
Whatever is growing
Never ever slowing, turn days to dark nights
Their backs still bent from the weight of our life
Look what I spent and gents it's half price
Cos he is bent over the sewing machine half his life
Don't matter that we don't pull it
If we don't care that's our breads buttered with the bullets
Our cars choke on blood
Limbs in our diamond tip rings go rotten
There's something we forgotten
Pillars of the temple may seem separate
But they support one roof
If your really checking it
All of our slaughters
Only our daughters
Only our self in a war that we fought with
All corrupt laws it's, we are the causes
Cos we can't see they're all of our daughters
Kill a couple of us you're a devil
If you kill a couple million of them
Get stripes and medals
Generals conduct the great death symphony
Played in the key of hate
By musicians with no rhythm but offbeat killing
Hear the harmonies the screams of young women
They're not important
They are just orphans
How can that be if they're all of our daughters?
They're not important
They are just orphans
How can that be if they're all of our daughters

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If we decided to not be divided
Saw no one that we could side with
All the gun and stupid violence
All the fun of stupid tyrants
The blood of our defiance of the laws of natural science
Would have subsided or died a death or had no hiding left
Instead it provided the horse to ride on to the ride of death
We're enlightened but we don't know right from left
Cos we're so frightened
Its like we're blinded to the sight of death
For all our writing only writing on the doors of death
We're only fighting for the right to resort to theft
We would steal the air if we could as if we're short of breathe
Only if we're sure that it would have the cause and effect
If some part of us good, tell me where it is kept
Cos we are saying nothing while we crush them like a fucking pest
If you discuss it, everybody is turning fucking deaf
Look down at your kids, what if they were next?

[Hook]
