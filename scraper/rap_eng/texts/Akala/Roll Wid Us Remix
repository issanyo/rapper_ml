Right about now
I got man and em for u understand?
Young Niccolo - 15 y'know?!
Big E
Quest talk to dem!
Many men in tha street
But none of them is live like me
Quick to fire around like me
A young gun that's I'll
Hustler on tha block - shit real
Catch ya case hits tha streets
Till da sun's revealed
Listen I ain't trippin
Illin out da states
Spittin/grimey type
Put a hole in ya missus
Love beef so I stay in the kitchen
Hard to move in the game if u a pawn & ya queen is missin
Cause niggas round here play 4 keeps
AK's that'll spray all day
Blow ya lungs to ya feet
Overseas wid da gullious thieves
Roll Wid It Get Rolled Through Playa deadly in these streets
Record tight jus let em' fight
Bang hammers cause on the block cause we hot - livin tha streetlife
Ain't nuthin new to real soldiers
Hold It down
Game is over
From shotown 2 London - we rollin
Uhh
Roll Wid Us Or Get Rolled Over
It's time now the wait is over
Never let em' see you sweat
Man of respect
Yeh We live like we roll Tecs
Full of ourselves
Best of the best - my niggas blessed
Thanks for askin
Thanks for passin
Knuckle bruise from the blastin
I gave u gonerhell
Kill tracks like my dick touch tha ovaries
And my chick took the pill
Can't take her back - too much pain
Moved Work
Towerbridge in my whip like 12 times a day
And I'm still goin true - so shine away
F*ck cops - maintain, streched out & claim
Keep feedin em' - whatz there to eat
Fried Rice, Chicken Wings plus barbeque ribs - that's beef
Chilled orange juice
Kit back purposely
And if u catch me outta hood
U can bet it's P
Soldier I need a backpack to carry mine
Best believe cause they bigga than none
So what - Bless ya
Roll Wid Us Or Get Over
Faggots talk hard but don't get no bolder
Shookin tha club widout they soldiers
Normal rollers just they olders
Two-steppin
Louie Crep wid the checked laces
Yeh she's buff but her face pasted
So I can't place it
I'm a fly nigga
In any hood
I would ride nigga
Before taklin like 'nah nigga'
Roll Wid Us Or Get Rolled Over
It's time now the wait is over
Yo
L8li tingz hav been insane
I'm catchin stupid beef for ova peeps speekin my sake
Nu carlo stay loyal to da fam
Da fam fought tha same way
We leasin tracks for no cats searchin 4 a pay day
But let's get one fing cleared up right now
Ain't nobody out there messin wid ma fam str8 up
Now listen - I ain't trynna drop a word of wisdom
But trynna show heads that don't know the place we live in
Where u got those? he shot tha fiends to make a livin
Will those envy? pretend to be friendz & I'm snitchin
While lil kidz are swearing hood in every drop I'm pissin
People end up missing - families left reminiscin
No fam beat tha clique
M1 blocks where we jam
If ya son says us on blud
Live me for my mans
Understand when I walkin road I check my shoulders
Your friendli man down tha phone blud - u ain't a soldier
Now I understand what they say to him when he's older
Roots see his roads Roll Wid Us or get rolled over
I understand what they say to him when he's older
Roll Wid Us blud or get rolled over
Roll Wid Us Or Get Rolled Over
It's time now the wait is over
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Matter without movement
And Pac's no force for the cause
I keep rolling
So composed it
While u was top speed
I'm still strolling
Fake thugs folding - u niggas is done
U just can't cannot fight - that's a fist to a gun
Bold when the sun
I'm ten versus one
Smoked to a lung
U little bastard - disaster must come
But most
Only postponed
U clones get dethroned
I shoot truth - leave ya lies leakin tha road
Bleed & exposed
Yes my flows are cold as an artic blizzard
It's not written in poems
Merlin verses
Dark as a womb
Worse than curses for raiding tha tomb
Meet ya doom - tha kid who can't be moved
I'm just livin out my name - it's all so plain
I'm different f*ckin gravy
Eva since tha lick
I keep the grasscuts - so the snakes can't slither my shits
We could talk stocks & figures like shots from triggers
Niggas gettin smoked like Kippers
Cause man and em' don't learn till tha shit happen first
This is not Usher but yeh we could let it burn
Roll Wid It - It's betta wid mo hands
Even when you can't fight what u don't understand
Roll Wid Us G
Or Get Rolled Over!
That's right
It's not a rumour blud
We coming for this year blud
