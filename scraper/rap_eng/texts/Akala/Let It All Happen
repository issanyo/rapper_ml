[Verse 1: Akala]
Existence is resistance in a world that
Thinks the human instinct should be held back
And all of our wisdom we we should sell that
Destroy the difference that we all have

And make use clones for the throne
Serving their agendas
Even when we think we oppose
We're really their defenders

Look at what is given to those
Who chose for their repentance?
To fold to the goddess of gold and be cold henchmen
For stars spangled with banners

That dangles cars as carrots
Strangle Mars with cannons
Mangle arms with malice
And channel arms so callous
And banish bards that challenge

And challenge half the planet
The great USA
With a British dog on a leash
We are the bringers of peace into the Middle of East

You are invited to Feast
On the tasty flesh of a beast
It might be someone's seed
But why worry there is no need

We intravenously feed
On dead carcasses
Yeah they're starving cos
They wanted to own their own wealth
And they are not part of us

Most of the time I think of myself
And I can palm it off
Sometimes I think of the world
It gets me started off

[Hook]
So so what do we do now
Make ways that praise more than a few how?
Their fake ways we kill it with a tool blaw
Or go back to the way we've always done it

Whatever we do there's always gonna be division
Whatever we do there will always be a thieves' religion
Whatever we do they're just gonna build another prison
So let's just do nothing and let it all happen

Whatever we do the universe just keeps on giving
Whatever we do the Earth will always keep on spinning
Whatever we knew we still won't understand beginnings
So let's just do nothing and let it all happen

Existence is resistance in a world that
Thinks the human instinct should be held back
And all of our wisdom we should sell that
Destroy the difference that we all have

[Verse 2: Akala]
Every freedom we believe we're receiving this evening
But believing is deceiving
When there's no meaning
In not a syllable

However how lyrical
Spouted from the mouths of a clout
Devout criminals
Hegemony is as old as humanity right?

So we're told
So let us scramble for the globe until everything folds
As long as pockets always have enough dollars to fold
As long as rockets always have enough venom to scold

A daddy's daughter
A mother's son
Or anyone
That has not come to succumb to a murderer's tongue

So we're told
Worship a gun
From the palace of permanent slums
Purchase a ton
From whoever will sell you the Sun

And sell it back to whoever can give you the funds
The race is run
But I don't know if we lost or we won
It's all perception, death and resurrection
A lack of answers won't stop as asking the question

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akala]
Resisting the system?
Please tell me what's the mission
Cos we would probably be oppressors
If given position

Yeah I try to spread a message, but really ambition
Is what is driven through my lyrics
I'm really a gimmick
Not that I don't put my heart and my soul in the words

It's just I ask
If the bars are changing the Earth
How arrogant to believe we can change it
Through art

Only slightly less arrogant than those
Who believe that we can't
So pull a bit harder
We may just crumble the house of cards

Never to slumber it's strength in numbers
Whenever we charge
There is a charge, lays these bars lace the guitars
Aim for the stars
Game for the part, straight as dart, pain from the heart
Great for the art

Start fighting
Or never should ever you pen to the page
Start writing
Or never should ever you empty the gauge

Murder a phase, verbally slayed
The coroner could not determine his age
Hard as a foreigner earning a wage
From the conservative nerd of a sage

Not heard? I'm a permanent page
Written in the ink of the blood of a slave
No cotton so burn on a wage
Buried at the bottom of the ocean of rage

[Outro]
Existence is resistance.. x15
So so what do we do now?
