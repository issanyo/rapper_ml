{Jaja Soze}
Yo! this is the other side of the story you never hear about
Killers looking out the jail windows and start cryin' out
Like "Mom I miss you!"
Please forgive me
Don't mean to diss you
Sittin' here
Wipin' the tears
With a tissue
Mom I miss you
But what about the rapper that blings
Mostly sings
But didn't tell the fans his mom bought those things
With her last wages
From her cleaning job
Sweeping stages
For the mere fact
She'd rather you be happy
Than locked in cages

{Akala}
There's no honesty
Honestly it bothers me
Done with the fake shit
Flick your heels Dorothy
Run off back to OZ with fake tales of Montana grams
Like 99% of the block strugglin' for a grand
Grandmother diabetic
Insulin gets injected
And little kids neglected
Cause parents livin' reckless
I've done wrong can't judge the suppliers
But there's far too many fiends in my life to ever glorify it

{Hook, Akala and Jaja}
The otherside that you never see on television
The otherside when a killers shed a tear in prison
The otherside ain't written in gold
It's really cold
The otherside of the truth but its never been told
The otherside ain't no fake rap videos
Just jail cells, funerals and the mental homes
This rap shit used to be the news from the hood
Now everyone's jumpin' round like it's all good

{Akala}
What you know about moms addicted to the pipe
Hood plus the wicked type
Dads in and out of jail
And he's an Ike "I Am-ite"
What you know about two parents with two jobs each
With a grown man for a son that raps talkin' grease
{Jaja Soze}
See everybody's in a gang but not really prepared
See you're a plumber not a killer really you're scared
And you would brag about the killin' not the nightmares
You going to flow where you sleep and got sweat in your tears
{Akala}
One of my O. G.s told me once
He couldn't pull up to the lights
Without seeing the night
That he first took a life
He vomited
For months on end
Then picked back up the sting
And he'll be 65 before he ever see his ends again
{Jaja Soze}
I got some close friends and killers that work nursing clones
Smoking something that poisoned them to the mental homes
Repeat the cycle of destruction that was built for the zones
Self genocide sellin' each other coke bones

{Hook}

{Akala and Jaja}
Hey Jaja have you seen um, these grown men fibbin'
Too scared of themselves admit about how they're really feelin'
Yeah I see them talkin' about killin'
Lyin' at home chillin'
No guns, no knife they just lyin' about drug dealin'
What ever happened to really really fightin' the system
If we body dem we body for dissin' mothers and sisters
Man, what happened to the progress
All I see is crossdress
If you lyin' to these kids then that just makes you hopeless
This music is our culture weapon if we use it right
Or point it at our own heads, this is self-suicide
Do these little kids in the sticks
Really think these guys are real
Would they be making rap songs if they really kill
If you're in real beef
And your name's on the poster
It ain't that hard to just
Drive by and toast ya'
Yo Jaja did your dad leave
Ya my dad left, bro
Yeah fam, mine as well
And I still can't let go
The pain of how I grew up
People call me a screw up
Drunk half the nights off Henney until I threw up
Walkin' around the block
Me and my brother tore up
Me and my mom at the post office
For 20 pounds we cued up
Me and my big sis
Fightin' grown men crazy
Big brother died as a baby
So who the fuck you think raised me
So what's the message in the song
Be honest nothing more
If you really live the grind
Just be honest and make sure
If you a straight A student
Don't pretend you're a shooter
I know grown men that can't read
And end up bein' losers
Cause the other side is just like anywhere else
We just wanna live good and help ourselves
