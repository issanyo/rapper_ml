[Intro]
(Murder, murder 8x)

[Verse 1]
Every shot that thunders
Through the nighttime don't you wonder
What potential was extinguished
To keep the flames burning under?
Through the underworld and over world
Principles are so the same
Though we pretend they're not as if they do not control cocaine
But you'll find it's connected
Every kid in the hood that's living with a death wish
Is the same as the King who kills for the bling
But he is just much more reckless
It's the King that I'm talking about
Though he is born with a silver spoon in his mouth
He still gonna clap for the slightest of chat
At any world leader that can't back it
If he is sitting on the boxes
They are just oil or mineral deposits
Food he is moving fucking with our profit
So he better stop it
They say money makes the world go round, but it don't
That is just not true
If you ain't got guns to protect that money
I'lI regret that, Sonny, it is more fool you
Only murder further agendas that money couldn't force
Eliminate the foes who propose
To suppose a different course, of course
A little torture is usually a big supporter
Though there's nothing quite like killing
Good riddance to non supporters
We demonize the man on the corner
Paint him as a thug
We worship murder so much
It's just that he ain't killed enough
You wanna commit murder
But not end up in cuffs?
You gotta make it to the Premier League
A thousand murders plus

[Hook]
Who said money makes the world go 'round?
They just didn't know
Murder runs the globe
M-m-murder runs the globe

[Verse 2]
Every knife that puncture lungs of sons
Don't make you wonder Mums?
If he was born to billionaires backed by a hundred guns
Would he be living still, drinking, sleeping, eating meals?
Instead of dead where it don't count
We expect you to be killed
Because living as a pauper is a fate that is tainted
Acquainted with torture
We ain't debating the rape of the daughter
If she was raised in particular borders
Place that fate made particular slaughters
No fate just particular orders
It's the way of the world no accident
In fact it's immaculate
You got a big gun start clapping it
Cause the language of power devour quick
Any silly biddy little pacifist or activist or challenges
Brown or black skin savages
Who inhabiting land with minerals in it
Who think for a minute that the rhetoric we spoke
Hope? Was not meant to be a joke
Don't dream compassion will happen it won't
Just go straight for the throat
Because any nation or races
That prove themselves incapable
Of matching modern murder machines
Make themselves enslavable
It is murder not money we desire insatiable
The thrilling of the killing it's million dollars sensational, YES!
What you can't do with a bribe
Can be achieved in a breeze with a gun and a knife
Because only murder further agendas that money couldn't grind
Nothing like a couple dead kids to change a parents' mind

[Hook]
Who said money makes the world go 'round?
They just didn't know
Murder runs the globe
M-m-murder runs the globe

[Verse 3]
Let's get a little clarity
You ain't got the capacity to internationally
Have a say in the ways things happening
You expect to collect more battering
Your arsenal it ain't got no nukes
Armies equipped with too few troops
We're laughing at you when you call truce
It's part of the ritual to shoot-shoot-shoot
You got no background in colonization
Or public resource privatization
You can't bang with the big boys, face it
But you still wanna play like Satan
You got no death squads to call your own
Or a pilot to fly your drones
Much less bulldozers for their homes
Talk gangster and you want to name Al Capone?
He was an amateur, silly little boys don't understand
Even he went jail for tax evasion
For missing a payment in the payment plan
To the man, one with invisible hand
And a hidden fist to enforce my plan
I am just because I can more wicked than the Summer of Sam
Kick your shit and I kick mine fam
You bust your gun and I bomb your land
Only murder further agendas that money can't control
Nothing like a massacred village to get the problem solved!

[Hook]
Who said money makes the world go 'round?
They just didn't know
Murder runs the globe
M-m-murder runs the globe
