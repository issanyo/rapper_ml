Welcome to England, part of so called Great Britain
But ain't a fucking thing great about the way we're living
For me it's hard to see how we're perceived over seas
It's believed we sip teas, and speak like the Queen
Nigga please, the streets will suck your blood like a leech
A lot of shells, ya get wet but real far from a beach
Dole queue, fifty pounds a week, ends don't meet
If ya like me even your mum's done hustled more than weed
Times are harder, we get dads but few get fathers
And we still pray but shit, get few answers
Every single area with an ethnic majority
Full of drugs, guns and poverty, getting to thirty is a lottery
And the government, deceiving the white working classes
Into believing they're supportive to us black bastards
Bullshit! Like we're living so cool
Go to your local fast food, take a look at who's serving you
And the schools are bullshit too, so we're weighing out grams
I'm strange amongst the mans 'cause I got some exams
I grew among youths real nice with the knowledge
Yet I'm the only one who finished school, let alone college
Our role models ain't doctors, but shottas who pop hollows
Chefs that cook food that'll kill you if you swallow
So addictive once the wicked thing holds you, you're never right
Can't begin to count the lives I've seen consumed by the pipe
Walking ghosts, that sold their own soul for them rocks
And mandem shot them rocks, just to cop rocks
'Cause the shining kind of rocks make sluts suck cock
Along with jocks and repping their ends by busting gunshots
It's on top, you cannot tell me all is not lost
Grown man is busting shots just 'cause they're dying for props
That's why, public displays, guns spraying in raves
But most of these youths can't shoot, so innocents hit by the strays
Our, future is fucked, that much is obvious
And I'm, far from perfect so I make no promises
'Cause every day create more Doreen Lawrences
So it's fake, when they make out like all is positive
I gotta keep them things and be willing to bust them
Niggas is ignorant, no discussion, you'll get murdered for nothing
A pregnant woman, got kneecapped, over a car crash
Ten year old boy stabbed and left bleeding to death in his own flat
Man is warring over manors not even drugs
You'll get plugged, for stepping on the wrong toe in clubs
You wanna know how real it is? I'll tell you with ease
All you gotta do, look at the last two New Year's Eves
One just passed, four teenage girls went out for a blast
Two never came home, machine guns that were blast
The year before, a man survived a shot in the chest
Bullet pierced the wall, put the gunman's own friend to his death
And what's funny, is that we ain't even shocked
This shit happens every day, so we just shrug it off
And that's a basic introduction to Britain's black community
No Puffys or Jiggas 'cause we got no unity
That's why, half the world don't even know that we're here
Yet we're living the same struggle, our mothers cry the same tears
And of course, I want my kids to have a better life
But for now... I gotta survive
