[Intro: Josh Osho]
Lose myself in you
Find myself in you

[Verse 1: Akala]
Sometimes I feel like, I'm not enough
Can you please complete me?
Or at least let me sleep with ease
Convince myself to at least release me
I wanna be more than my wealth more than my health
I think I need your help
Be all that I can more than a man that I am
But still not someone else
I put you down just projecting weight by the pound
That drowns my direction
Hate by the pound surrounds my reflection
I do this for my own protection
Reject it before I'm neglected
Defective as it is, thats my directive
The simple truth is that, I feel protected
Only at times that we're connected, cos

[Pre-Hook: Akala]
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
This song ain't gonna write itself
I think I need your help
This wrong ain't gonna right itself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
I just wanna, I just wanna

[Hook: Akala]
Lose myself, find myself, see myself
Be myself, lose myself, find myself
I just wanna, I just wanna
Lose myself, find myself, see myself
Be myself, lose myself, find myself
I just wanna, I just wanna
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
I just wanna, I just wanna
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
I just wanna, I just wanna

[Post-Hook: Josh Osho]
Lose myself in you
Find myself in you
See myself in you
Be myself with you

[Verse 2: Akala]
Save the drama
I'm far from a knight in shinning armour
I just do the best that I can as a man
I believe in Karma
Leaving the drama, is easily harder
When you find someone, easy to partner
They ask and its easy to answer
I think I have found what I seem to be after
Cos I wanna tune to your rhythm
I want a guide that relies on your wisdom
Open my eyes is closing my vision
So it's no surprise that I notice division
But I wanna be more than the ordinary
Ain't you bored of the orderly?
Just a robot you know what
You could just order me
I, pretend I'm the remedy, but I could never be
Cos of my energy, I am the enemy
Always eventually back where it's meant to be
I'm just a remedy
So whatever the weather, however clever
You never, ever endeavour, to wrestle with forever
Want to get better? Then we gotta sever
This big ego and work together

[Pre-Hook: Akala]
