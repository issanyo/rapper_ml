Sometimes I just wanna fight, fight
And I don't give a shit what's right, right
In the middle of the day or the night, night
I don't wanna bark just bite, bite
Sometimes I just wanna blow, blow
What it is I don't really know, know
But I feel it in my mind and my soul, soul
Sometimes I feel like a psycho

And that's when you wanna get sarcastic
And pull just a little bit more of my elastic
I'm not elastic, I snap like plastic
So for me that is bloody fantastic

Cos today I wanna fight, fight
And I don't give a shit what's right, right
In the middle of the day or the night, night
I don't wanna bark just bite, bite

And then suddenly...
I wanna love the world today
I wanna laze the day away
I wanna let the music play
I wanna laze the day away
And then, once again

Sometimes I just want war, war
I don't really know what for, for
But I know that I want to get raw, raw
So bring it here if you're, sure

Sometimes my life gets hectic
That's when I lost perspective
The anger got me infected
And my brain gets defective

And that's when you wanna get sarcastic
And pull just a little bit more of my elastic
I'm not elastic, I snap like plastic
So for me that is bloody fantastic

Cos today I wanna fight, fight
And I don't give a shit what's right, right
In the middle of the day or the night, night
I don't wanna bark just bite, bite

And then suddenly...
I wanna love the world today
I wanna laze the day away
I wanna let the music play
I wanna laze the day away

I wanna meditate
I wanna levitate
I want my mind and my spirit to resonate
I wanna drink green tea at my friends gaffe
Walk up to random people and chit-chat
Ask them about life, how their day was
What their hopes and dreams and afraid of
Get to know them and get to know me
Some days I love everything that see
Other days, the man in the mirror is a guy that I don't know
I try to reason with him but there's no pleasing him
He just will not be told
It's this big ego that he's got in his big head
That's got him all mislead, that needs to get fed
Makes him act like an illiterate idiot
Like he's got something to prove, nothing to lose
Ego boost, turns to aggression
Don't learn his lesson, where is he headed?
I know he's got his head in so far up his rectum he thinks the world ends if you disrespect him

Sometimes I just wanna fight, fight
And I don't give a shit what's right, right
In the middle of the day or the night, night
I don't wanna bark just bite, bite

Sometimes I just wanna blow, blow
What it is I don't really know, know
But I feel it in my mind and my soul, soul
Sometimes I feel like a psycho

And then suddenly...
I wanna love the world today
I wanna laze the day away
I wanna let the music play
I wanna laze the day away

And then once again...
That's when sense just goes out the window
I lose myself in just a moments impulse
I'm tip-toed, one foot on the thin rope
Breathe wrong, I take it as an insult
It can be anything, everything
I'm confused and angry and there's no medicine
Hate this flesh, hate this face
Could be in the Bahamas, I hate this place
Big disgrace, let's face facts
Hate this music and I hate this track
Hate this rap
Oh no, take that back from my ego it's far too feeble
I'm the best rapper alive, no what does he know
Whipper snappers have tried but they don't evoke
The results that he shows when he spoke
You wee lemons?
All are or we joke

I know what it is that's got me feeling so violent lately
It's all this classical music I've been listening to

Pick better Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers but I picked a fight I picked tonight
I know that I pick better Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers but I pick jaw I pick war
Sure that I pick better Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers but I picked a fight I picked tonight
I know that I pick better Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers but I pick jaw I pick war
Sure that I pick better whipper snapper little rapper chitter chatter doesn't matter cos a badder matters at a psycho
Whipper snapper little rapper chitter chatter doesn't matter cos a badder matters at a psycho
