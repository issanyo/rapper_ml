[Hook] x2
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
But absolute powerlessness does the same
It's not the poverty
It's the inequality we live in everyday that will turn us insane
We live in everyday
Yo, Listen

In a scheme of livin' my life wasn't hard
But as far as Britain goes sh't i practically starved
Sleepin' in a track suit, gas meter runnin' out
Electric cut of as well, candles lighting up the house
Lookin' in my mother's eyes I see how she feels
The strain and the pain of just paying bills
It ain't real and that's how i grow like so many more
And i was part of who i am
I am very sure
You wanna' know the rage i feel in my stomach
Knowing my mom and dad split up when i was still in her stomach
And not everything that happened i will put in 16's
But i will tell you enough so you know what i mean
My boy's mother got cancer the same time as mine
But his mother died and mine survived
It was crazy back then
When i was like 10 already had the mental strength
More than many grown men
It was a couple of years after my step dad left
Did he really know all the crazy mess he left
Because mum done recovered from the lumps in her neck
But being poor and alone couldn't cope with the stress
Her and my big sis for
So much so, that I hadnâ€™t left school
When she left home
I was 13 by now still a little kid, innocent
Next couple year though would turn 'to a militant
That is the result of no food in the fridge
And every other day you gettin' searched by the pig's
Plus these patronizing teacher doe' my grade sick
Trying to emasculate me yeah turn me into a f'cking ana
Don't mean no woman please let me be clear
I mean been a spineless man because what do they fear
More than the working class brown male with a brain
And when our energy is harness everything changed
Look at 'Pac, look a Marley, look at Hendrix, look at Garvey
This is the potential that is wasted on a daily basis
A racist classist world that we live in
Still we comin' from nothing and we educating millions
I see why it scares you its like how dare you
Overcoming the obstacle that we have been careful to
Place in your way, every step of the way
In this so called democracy were kids get sprayed
Black and the Asians, Turks and the Chavs
Crowded in council flats, living like ants
And who's more confused than so called white trash
Talking this madness about they want there country back
It never was yours, you should read more
What they did brown people they did to the own poor
But people's memory short so much that i'm seeing
Black and Asian kids cast eastern-European
No pot to piss in, makes competition
I fail to see how this is a effective system
When cats and dogs in America and Britain
Eat better food than most of humanity
And we spend our technology only on killing
How is this more than sophisticated savagery
It was once said the world is a stage
Each persons is just a actor with a part to play
Like the middle class kids and the kids of the rich
That have everything but yet still pissed and on coke and ketamine strong hat on
I ain't generalizing look at the evidence
So go to Glastonbury any year
You will see but unlike carnival it won't be crowing with police
This is London the kids on the very next street
Had a very different life experience from me
And in my experience the can't help but be smug
After lifetime of what they think is just good luck
But still more anxious and more thankless
Unearned privileges ways like an anchor
It's why they copy what we do, tyna' be what they not
They will grow up though and get better jobs
And maintain the system that they claim they hated
They can't fight against it, they got a stake in this matrix
Hip-Hop is just a fad to them, you didn't know
But for us this is our living breathing soul
And yeah they might back pack in South America
Or even volunteer in a African Village
But all said and done, when push come to shove
And shit hits the fan they're middle class and British and i ain't even dissing
That's just how it is most rich brown people just as full of sh't
So much more concerned with our cars and jewels
That most of the world poor luck just like you
So much more concerned being privileged few
And who knows maybe me to
