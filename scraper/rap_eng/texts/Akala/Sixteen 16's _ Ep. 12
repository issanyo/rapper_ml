[Verse 1: Akala]

Conservative rap shout to white billionaires
Heirs to the throne of global capitalism
Built on the back of niggers
Literally in actual figures
Centuries of labor unpaid, it had to equip us
With fuel for the engine
Fools stop pretending
We have not provided the answer to each and every question
You don't worship us and brown imitators
Then it's obvious to all that you blatantly hate us
Matters not how we got our paper, even enslavement
Or dead Congolese kids today for mineral payments
What matters is you worship blindly things over people
See yourself as less than equal
In the world that we teach you
If you have not, you be not
Swing from the treetops
All you little monkeys should know by now that we not
Of the same species, we're more human than you
That's why you worship us you dickheads, proving it's true
