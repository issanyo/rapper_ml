[Verse 1: Akala]
It's that Yard, Cockney, cant copy
Flow cocky done off the dance like we're Brockie
So dem cyant stop it and them na profit
Son your flow is dead and [?] duppy
Trust you know us, we came from windrush
They clutch the purse nuff, but they that robbed us
Must we fight nuff [?]
The more we get righteous, the tighter the cuffs
Cah we started from zero, council flat here
To all around the globe with the flow to your earhole,
Coming from London no boy bwoy [?]
Fake imposter try play with the Pharoah
Crown the king don't doubt a thing
Make sure you show the little man you're proud of him
So we could know the set that the older vets laid the path from the start now show respect

[Hook]
It's like we're living in a room full of giants
Who do anything to try and deny us
Yeah, and we see the whole system is biased
But we're standing on the shoulders of giants, giants, giants...

Reach out and grab it now
Hands up we're living proud

[Verse 2: Kabaka Pyramid]
Standing on some broad shoulders like Olympic swimmers
Born as a winner me nah bawl for no bimmer
Man are di trilla tell your [?] that me iller
Tour the world and then a mi kick back and grill inna the villa
One likkle island have the whole world a shiver
[?]

[Verse 3: Akala]
We forgot we are standing on top of those shoulders
Not in a language to flock, but so focused
Lock everyone of us up, but can't hold us
We already was at the top, they don't own us

[Hook]
It's like we're living in a room full of giants
Who do anything to try and deny us
Yeah, and we see the whole system is biased
But we're standing on the shoulders of giants, giants, giants...

Reach out and grab it now
Hands up we're living proud
