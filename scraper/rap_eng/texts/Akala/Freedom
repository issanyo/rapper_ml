(What is freedom?)

[Amy True: Hook]
Free your mind
Free your goals
Free your time
Free your souls
We go out, a lot out of the way
We go out, a lot out of the way
We want our freedom, ye
We want our freedom, ye

[Akala]
I want freedom
I don’t know the meaning or how to achieve it
'Cause freedom founded on thinking I was freed isn't freedom
But that’s the kind of freedom
That’s crazy and make appealing
And all other forms of freedom
Is crazy dangerous demons
Pray your brains on the ceilings
For entertaining the meaning
It’s political
Physical, spiritual and it’s healing 'cause
Freedom is difficult
It requires a critical
Master the population
Not following the typical
Propaganda accused
Media supreming news
In fact it ain’t even shock anymore
It’s just real, mask killers
Dining on fine dinners
While preaching to us about freedom
Like we are

[Swiss]
Listen, I want to be free like the number
When I feel like to wonder
Don’t want to feel like I’m under
But over saturated my imaginaticial wonder
Your boxers and cotton,is something I want to come to
'Cause I’m a freedom hunter
A true terrorist, a live killer
Me and Akala brought the pen inside, five fingers
It’s musical medicine
Dude want to collide with us
We fighting the spiritual war
Can I get a further witness
More fire, more power
The worst hours
I can free myself for more these cowards
The up and downs
The biggest enemy ain’t a coward
In my surrounds
My biggest enemy is the enemy
I’m a stoned gutter

[Akala]
If knowledge is power then tell me please what is freedom
Can you define a single word that has many meanings
If you mean it, like I mean it
Do we really need it
Is definition another prisoner that we believe in
Can you be free in prison sitting in your cell
Can you be free of the system when you living in hell
Can you be free if the vision is too difficult to tell
'Cause we going round in circles like a dog chasing his tale
Time will tell, if we fell
If we live to tell the tale
If we will ever break the spells that they telling us well
And get free
Free from the pressure
Free from depression
Free from the lies they tell us in the history lessons
Free
