[Akala : Verse 1]

This love is a drug
The way it affects the run of your blood
Never to snub, but always eventually they do succumb
Overrun, by thoughts that make you withering on
Your own mum or anyone who has a slip of the tongue
And there’s the question
While you’re collecting tremendous sums
While people are living in simplest villages even the wickedest slums
Despite all the image and acting so innocent all of the pillaging’s done
So you relax not knowing the facts of how it actually come
What’s next will power lose the head on it’s neck?
And will the one that comes after be like a master grafter?
Or more disaster cos history’s not a class in laughter?
But yesterday is not tomorrow so why do I trouble to answer
I ain't sure if any war was fought for the poor
Any persons working with a motive that is totally pure
What I do know is the powerful won't hand it over
You gotta take it but nature might make you even colder
