Nothing is to be feared only to be understood
Intoxicated often does what
The sober would, if he thought he could
If he had the power, he'd abuse it and that seems clear to me
What is dear to me, is also fear to me
Because pain is the price of what I hold near to me
To which I'm attached and I can't light the match
If I did I'd see everything I think I lack, is right
Here already, I'm a part of it, not the end and nor am I the start of it
But apart nonetheless, scared of what is under flesh
And everything I can't posses so instead I disconnect
And to numb the stress, take a blunder guess
Rather than know, I don't know and just accept
I view it as a test and I must pass, it's only real if
Its something that I must grasp
Nothing else counts a bit if I can't count
It quick, so lets count figures
Let us count figures. Figures in the bank
Figures mowed down by tanks, the steel boot of the figure stamps on the
Ants, but they want more than figures
We ain't figured that we need them
And we're projecting the reflection of how were really feeling
When we kick them kill them, leave them there dying bleeding
And say they did it first, we are just getting even
And repeated until it's something that we can believe in
The truth is that inside we are screaming
And we hate ourselves that's why we act this way
When we strike out we should punch ourselves in the face
That is what we are really doing, got no clue what we're pursing
The mirror or the million, what are we really viewing?
We can take a microscope and analyze atoms or telescopes to the sky
The same thing happens, it's the same picture, they both go on forever
So when we place limits on things, is that clever?
In fact I define myself by my limitations, my station or my status
Or my silly faith in papers. The type that I read or the type that say I've
Read, the type for which they bleed or the type that say you bled and now
The ego's fed but never had its fill, so until we shed, let's accept the deal
We will steal and will kill just for the thrill, that's my dose of truth
Give me the blue pill And let me swallow, wallow now in my sorrow
Don't want to find my own Truth it's easier to borrow
