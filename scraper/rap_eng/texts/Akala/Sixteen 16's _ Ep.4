Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
Those words uttered by the owners of flesh
Show us philosophy is dead, if it's just an idea
Without real-life practical steps
Oh is that so? Is the life of the mind no longer valid?
If we don't live what we think through daily habits
I'm embarrassed to say, everyday I betray
How I think I'd like to live in this world, am I insane?
Or the same as the hypocrites that I do disdain
What would I do in their shoes? I know what I'd like to claim
But there's no way we could say, how we would behave
If we had a whole different life up to this day
Is it innate? Encoded in our DNA?
Or in the spirit that is born in this body that we enslave
What is happiness for you might be hell for me
Do you still get to pursue it to the fullest degree?
We'll see
