Peace is on the way
Peace is on the way
By the sword they say
After this, this last blow, last chop
Last drop
Peace is on the way
After this, this last scream, last shout, last trample of boot
Just one more, one last rubble wreck where once were dreams housed
Last plane, last flame, last sky
Peace is on the way
Just one more naked Vietnamese girl
Be she Russian, Israeli, Palestinian or Great Great, Great, Really Great British
Just one more placard wielding warrior and this last sword-slinging gunman
Just one more song of machine-gun metal hurtling Death to outrun life
Just one more war
Then we can have peace
Then we can have peace
