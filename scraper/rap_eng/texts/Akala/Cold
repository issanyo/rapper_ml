Can I take you back for a minute
It's not just lyrics
I live it I'm spillin my spirit
On the beat like streets cold as blizzards
Late night drownin' my sorrow in a bottle of spirits
Was a sweet child, that characters missing No trace
Now it's bora in coat and screw face
Colder, soldier, angry young male
Don't ask how, you already know the tale
Never lived with my father
Nasty break up with my mum and her partner
And of course, times was harder
Moms did her best with the strength she could muster
But she so stressed it was us that would suffer
Plus school teachers hate me, say that I'm feisty
Play all kinda mind games to try break me
Helped turn a innocent kid, into a ignorant pig
Fuck em anyway, I still got straight A's

Winter was real, no gas
I went to bed in full clothing
Back when my world was closing in and mom was sick
I can't explain the pain when the news came
Sorta like the blizzard that came after the rain
My mind was a prison, I visioned the worst
Ran home from school, wanted to get there first
Didn't want either of my sisters, to find what I pictured
Moms was too strong, she just soldiered on
Dad, I ain't mad
Don't think I don't understand
But I still had to learn how to be a man
Standing on my own two, not the way you supposed to
Funny how the cycle repeats
Nobody showed you, Wouldn't believe I told you what I had to go through
Pressure couldn't fold me, but turnt my heart cold G
What don't kill you make you strong supposedly
That must be why nobody can hold me
Yeah I had a struggle, but really it's sugar-coated
When you think of all the millions barely living and hopeless
In the news Mother and child, bellies bloated
Put yourself in their shoes, knowin' death is approaching
But it's not fate, it's bait, they were thrown in
The deep end of the endless ocean of mans sin
Politics, religion, man philosophize
Got technology and television
Still don't know why the worlds a weight on top of your shoulders
But we fold up, true we can't hold up them boulders
I been through the shit, but came out like roses
I'm blessed, don't ever think I don't notice
I know I got a path, but it's hard to stay focused
Specially on these roads, where foes are like roaches
Foul and I crush em and I won't even notice
If I lose my way, I just want you to know this
