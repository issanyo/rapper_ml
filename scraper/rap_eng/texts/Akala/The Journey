[Intro: Akala & (Mic Righteous)]
Isn't the purpose of life to give your life some purpose?
Chasing these dreams and these goals to only find they're worthless
(In this eternal circus I could turn in circles
Spins around the fire burning
We're searching for higher learning)
Distracted by higher earning
Yearning for more than what's on the surface
What if I told you that inside you were perfect
(Would you believe me or say I'm crazy man, what's your verdict?)
The furthest from the battlefield is always lovin war
(The one who's on the front line, well he ain't as sure)
Don't appreciate all your blessings, you need to struggle more
(Might have the fullest plate and live amongst the poor)
If you've got a heart full of hate then you are just as flawed
(What if the journey is the destination, what you reckon, if you present)
Is a present, will you grab it with every second, or
(Would you still wreck it, given a second chance?
Now that we've even said it, nah, we ain't no better, in fact)
We're just as wreckless and we ain't got the answers
(These are just our questions)

Journey with us, journey as we ask these questions
(Journey with us, journey with us)
Journey with us, journey as we're learning lessons
(Journey with us, journey with us
Journey with us, journey with us)
We ain't got the answers
(Journey with us, journey with us)
We're just asking questions
Is this what they're waiting for
Cause we give it to them straight and raw
Is this what they're waiting for
(This what they've been waiting for)

[Hook]
Every journey begins with just one step
Turn over the page, open the book, just look
Every journey begins with just one step
Put your foot in front of the other and just move

[Verse 1: Mic Righteous]
I've been livin' in a prison in my mind
You been nothin' like mine, when you talk, pigs fly
What you call this life
What you glamorize is a pack of lies
I'm with a pack of lions
You ain't playin' with our pride
That's patronising, talking to the young bucks
You ain't ready for the pop-pop
Little Akon, you don't wanna get locked up
You don't wanna be a Konvict
What you spat got him on shit
Don't you fuckin' have a conscience?
I got this, can't stop it there
That's how I felt for the last couple years
You don't wanna confront my peers
My brother just lost somebody
So I had to go back to the manor and confront my peers
And comfort my peers
All this time I'm funding my career
All this time my fans are getting air
Yeah, I'm stood in the middle of nowhere
And I broke my back just to get here
Then and there is where dad just said a prayer
Still feel the blood of the person
I was building up in me, yeah I'm prepared
Still feel the blood of the person
I was building up in me, yeah I'm aware

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Akala]
Akala and Righteous, the words we are uttering
Feel in your spirit, the pain we are summoning
Cause we came up in the suffering, now we're recovering
But it still feels like we're stuck in it
There's enough of it
Everyone's sucking the life out of people
If it doesn't toughen 'em
Break, crack, shatter your life
This is the journey, it ain't always nice
We have not learned to disable the lies
It seems we're determined to pay all the price
But still, I murder a rhythm like no one in Britain
I'm righteous on mics when I'm spitting
Fam, don't worry bout me I am living
Just play your position and stay out the kitchen
When the rhythm hit him in the chest, better get a vest
I'm obsessed in his steaks there on the decks
Getting vexed, it's a head stare on your neck
So who's next to express? Get it off your chest
Chess that I play, fuck the right game
Time you were sure you aboard the right plane?
This one right here it goes where I say
The journey is allowing me to focus my pain
To spit phrases, molten ice flames
You'll get burned and frozen, that's only quite tame

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mic Righteous]
Brush off my shoulders and bop to the mother-ship
Bumping some other shit
Now all the lies will just turn into mumbling
Turn up my mic again
Turn up my mic so they know who the fuck it is
Know when I'm coming in
You just a problem for rap, when I rap
I'm a problem for governments
There's a problem in mainstream media coverage
Ffeeding us utter shit, please keep 'em coming in
This year I'm encouraging anyone with the courage to go up against
The system we're stuck up in
And if you ain't with us then fuck if then
Become a pawn or become a king
Become a pauper, they die by the sword of another pawn
Why are we fighting each other for?
Why are we fighting our brothers for?
What's the price of a life if you young and poor?
Looking online at a life for only some can afford
I got a son that needs more so I'm opening doors
I'm hoping he won't say I'm hopeless
That is more dangerous than a man who is desperate, broken
Coming back from an injury, did you miss me?
Man'll wanna throw me out like a frisbee
(Where you been fam?)
Wanna know where I've been G?
(Yeah, tell me now)
I've been alone, it's a rocky road, Kingsley

[Verse 4: Akala]
It's a rocky road in the stories that we're told
Well I'm evolved from the places that we've growed
You wasn't there when the rental was in arrears
And the bailiffs came to the door
You wasn't there, didn't witness all the tears
In fact have you ever been poor before?
You sure this ain't Jersey Shore?
This is real life, it is totally raw
Uncle's is going to prison
And half of your role models getting their dough in the kitchen
Living right next to the rich kids
One street away but our struggle is totally different
I am the man of the house where I'm living
And I'm like 11, I'm destined for prison
I never went though cause I beat the system
And all of my villains is proud that I broke tradition
You don't know shit about us
Do not discuss what you cannot sus
Sus is the start of them fuckin' us up
No it wasn't just not enough luck, better suck it up

[Hook]
