[Chorus : Ahmed]
If you start to say maybe, then you gonna see the light
That wonder, I wonder, how's it gonna be
When it's crossing your mind
Guess you're gonna find out your way
Yes I wonder, if you wonder, you keep telling me
It's going nowhere, and maybe you're right
But from where you stand
Maybe there's Something stoping your sight
And I wonder

[Verse 1 : Akala]
Sometimes I wonder if we would let our minds wander
Would it give us the strength we need to shine stronger?
Without struggle progress can't happen
But you can't reach a destiny your mind can't fathom
Every atom in your body must, pressure doubt til it's crushed
It seems that we fear the most when we are on the cusp
But if we just let it happen instead of second guessing
We'd see what we think we need it is in our possession
Some times I wonder if the biggest of blunders that we are under?
Is that we ain't eaten food in a whole and so confuse it with hunger
True hunger is the wonder itself
With no appreciation there is no abundance of wealth
It ain't the destination it is the journey so coma and walk with me
But I know where I am going so better walk quickly
And no doubters are allowed on the road
Cos we are following wonder to wherever it goes so let's go

[Chorus : Ahmed]
If you start to say maybe, then you gonna see the light
That wonder, I wonder, how's it gonna be
When it's crossing your mind
Guess you're gonna find out your way
Yes I wonder, if you wonder, you keep telling me
It's going nowhere, and maybe you're right
But from where you stand
Maybe there's Something stoping your sight
And I wonder


[Verse 2 : Akala]
We may not get the answer to every question asked
But if we don't start conversations then we ain't got a chance
So cease the time, grab the bull by the horns
Make the most of the moment from the moment your born
Because, where do we go now?
What do we do to make it we don't know how?
Never to slow down is the only way that we control ours
But no doubters are allowed on the road
Cos we are following wonder to wherever it goes so let's go

[Verse 3 : Ahmed]
Pretend that you're loving what you living
Like i don't know what you're feeling
You wanna stand there by the stars and
You make a move and then you're freezing
You're looking back again, nothing's gonna happen then
Think about it it's time for believing
I'm not available, if you're playing cynical

[Chorus : Ahmed]
If you start to say maybe, then you gonna see the light
That wonder, I wonder, how's it gonna be
When it's crossing your mind
Guess you're gonna find out your way
Yes I wonder, if you wonder, you keep telling me
It's going nowhere, and maybe you're right
But from where you stand
Maybe there's Something stoping your sight
And I wonder

[Outro : Ahmed Akala]
Lyoum b'nia 9elbi daba kay dwi
It's from my heart that I speak
Tri9 bent liya, lyoum ana matlit m'jli
I'm not lost anymore, i know where is the way
Oufigh Oufigh Agharass, oufigh oufigh arass inou
I've finally found my way
