[Verse 1: Akala]

Have you ever never had a pot to piss in bruv?
While living round the corner from those that swim in grub
Have you ever gone to school, stomach still rumbling?
Rich kids coming in, ten pound for lunch on 'em
Have you ever felt the resentment of not having shit?
Knowing your mother works as hard as those who are arrogant
Talking 'bout pull yourself up by the socks, bloody snobs
You started the race with a fifty pace head start, of course you're gone
We started from the beginning, had to carry baggage
Parents didn't have two cars, a home, and a lovely marriage
But that's life right?
We all play our cards
But ours are scarred and marked
So we put 'em in bars that's hard as [?]
Or not
Rep the underground dirt
But still tour round the whole globe, shouts to Kool Herc
We're so focused on our slice of the bread
Forgot to say if you're still at the bottom it's cool, hold your head
It don't make you less
