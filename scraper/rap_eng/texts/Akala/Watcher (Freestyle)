I'm the watcher, to me you cocksuckers are transparent
I see the future like tarots, my talent embarrass you faggots
Your shit is tragic like what happened to Magic
I'm cold turkey to addicts, wolf to a rabbit
Same city, different planet from Buckingham Palace
Where Rastas are smokin' the chalice, niggas drinkin' liquor by the barrels
Barrels smoke 'em, bullets soak in your apparel
I'm Sagittarius, so it's natural that I spit arrows
The watcher, I see proper, so called top shotters
Tell the world your business so you 'bout to get knocked by the coppers
But never lock up 'cus you sing like the opera
Pussy'ole fi get chop up, they got no morals
Think you ruthless 'cus the world see that you shootin? You stupid
On the low-low is how you should do tings
Passing your straps for stripe, you niggas are bitches
I don't know you, I know who you clippin', so much are snitches
Fuck the fame and the name, that ain't the aim of the game
Supposed to scheme for a better day
But niggas can't see, it's like they blind
It's cool, 25, plenty time to open your eyes
Like Memphis, future bleak, government vengeance
Like hell they wanna help, they just uppin' the sentence
Two strikes is life in the country we live in
If you pop shots, but not if you fuck children
So who you think they tryin' to imprison?
But niggas don't wanna listen
Limited vision is inhibited wisdom
So I keep my eyes open, every moment I'm focused
You jokers is bogus, I flow ferocious I'm sure that you know this
A lot of dudes spittin' written but I'm ripping riddims
God given, so you sinnin' if you think that you winnin'
No religion, not a Christian I believe in the spirit
Even if you a heathen, you believe in my lyrics
I'm the Einstein of physics, Shakespeare to writing
Tyson to fighting, strikin' like lightnin', we're frightenin', timin' like (?)
See clear, my vision refined
Look through my eyes, you feel like you see them for the first time
I spot the snakes, I know they kind
The fakes is easy to break
They got no spine, them man are principle
Discipline you niggas like the principal
My lyrical miracles, biblical to spiritual criminals
