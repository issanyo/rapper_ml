Run with me, I've got no idea where to
But I would feel much better if you were there too
Where to? I told you I've got no clue
But I would feel  much better if you were there too
Run with me, let's run from ourselves
Come with me, let's run from the world
When you're done with me, run with someone else
Soon you'll see that you're back to yourself
Run, Run, gotta keep running
Run, Run gotta keep running
Running and I'm Running I'm a glutton for the running
If you ask why I'm running I'll run from the discussion
Run, Run, gotta keep running
Run, Run gotta keep running
Running from your loving and I'm running from your bluffing
What I'm running from, I'm Running from I'm running from is nothing

Like a marathon man
Like a marathon man
Like a marathon Man
Like a marathon man

Run from your thoughts, the thought police are coming
Run from opinions, cos they mean nothing
Run from applause, run from the hecklers
Run from the line and run from the guest list
Run from the stage, run from the show
Where we're running to, nobody knows
We're running from death, then we run from life
Running from wrong then we run from right
Run past dreams
Running from fears
Run past smiles
Running from tears
Running from the moment
We Run past years
No one knows what we run from is
Run, Run, gotta keep running
Run, Run gotta keep running
Running and I'm Running I'm a glutton for the running
If you ask why I'm running I'll run from the discussion

Like a marathon man
Like a marathon man
Like a marathon Man
Like a marathon man

Run like a marathon man, the world is coming from you
Run with a gun in your hand, can't do nothing for you
Run from here to Japan, the world is coming for you
Run like a marathon man, yourself is coming for you

Run from yourself and me and who you wanna be
Run from your childish dreams over equality
Run from yourself and me and who you wanna be
Run from yourself and me

Run from your conscience, run from the nonsense
It's the ad break so run for our sponsors
Watch the news, run from these monsters
You should be confused, run from your responses
Run from your views, shout with the crowd
Shout with the crowd, first check you're allowed
Run from the shame, run from the proud
Run from the quiet, run from the loud
Run from everything that you could be
Run from everything that you would be
Run from those who say what you should be
Run, Run, gotta keep running
Run, Run gotta keep running
Run, Run, gotta keep running
Running and I'm Running I'm a glutton for the running
If you ask why I'm running I'll run from the discussion

Like a Marathon man
Like a marathon man
Like a Marathon Man
Like a marathon man

Like a Marathon man
Like a marathon man
Like a Marathon Man
