Hip hop spoke to what we saw on our front doors
The black CNN, and so much more
African oral tradition evolving through Jazz and blues
Griots rappin’ from back in the day as a way to spread the news
Until came from Jamaica, blazing amazing sounds
On the back of Hercules hip hop came to the Bronx with sound
A decade before, the same Caribbean
Our grandparents left to the shores of the Europeans
So we never learnt to rap watching Music television
This is our culture grew up on them sound systems
Now hip hop is global beyond imagination
We still can't allow its roots to be forsaken
So I’m makin' a statement and engraving it on London’s pavement
For the founding fathers and mothers for this art that we’re making
