[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I know we all live our life based on what they think
Cause we think it matters but I reckon
If we didn't care for just one second
We'd be much happier
Realize your life is your's to live
Tell your friends or your parents and what they think
You want the whole thing
Four kids and a good job a big house and quiet down
And thats cool, stay in school. Go to uni with those like you
If on the other hand you want to travel the world just to meditate
Thats what you should do
You don't need permission from the stay-in-line commission just to be who you are
Follow your heart, follow your dreams like a kid again
They want to write you off, with the end of the bit of pen, let them have it
They'll come around eventually
If not it wasn't meant to be
Its their problem
June or December, theres one small thing that I think we should remember

[Hook]

It's not that serious
Sometimes I want to fight
Sometimes I want to cry
But then I must remind myself
It's not that serious
We're gonna make it through
And find a better way
That works for me and you

[Verse 2]

If you don't conform, society whips you with its displeasure
If they were happy they wouldn't care
Whichever way that you chose, what you do with your time
Long as you ain't hurtin' no one, then thats fine
Problem is we hate to see another live the life that we dream
And I don't mean big screen and flashiness
Just free, carefree, true happiness
Wake everyday excited whats to come
Never work a minute when doing something you love
So when we judge, ask why, is it because we feel life passed us by
It's never too late to get rid of the stress
Theres a whole world out there
Just look up from your desk and say that the world is mine
And if you're not having a good time, then you're wasting your time

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You know, yo
People think I'm really serious, right
And I was for a long time
I'm not gonna lie and pretend I wasn't
But, then I realize that sometimes you just got enough
I mean, I'm not as serious as people think
Yeah I like to talk about the issues in the world
But at the same time, we can't let them bog us down
Yes, the world is not perfect, we all know that
Its just not that serious
Go to a comedy show, man
Take a bubble bath, or, I don't know, buy a pink dressing gown
Do something crazy that people wouldn't expect you to do
Let's drop these things called egos on the floor
Stamp on them, and try to get on with it, and realize that its just-
Just don't take yourself do god damn serious

[Verse 3]
What about the problems in the world?
Things ain't golden
Yeah, I agree
But will worrying solve them?
No, I'm not saying ignore
By all means do something if you feel for a cause
But you can't feel poor enough
To enrich one single person on this planet
And you can't feel bad enough
To fill one single soul with happiness
So, the biggest challenge we face, is just keeping a smile on our face
If stock markets crash, or girlfriends leave you, people don't like what they see when they see you
Football teams lose, bands will split
But the thing we must remember is this-
Its just not that serious
It really is not

[Hook]

[Outro]
Today walk up to somebody and talk to them find out how their day was
Don't worry if they think you're crazy- which they probably will
And you people in the train-
When you don't want no one peering over your shoulder to read your letter
Stop taking yourself so god damned seriously
Its just your newspaper. If I want to read a bit of your newspaper, whats the problem?
You should open it up, and let me have a good look
Yeah? Thank you
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Akala, not taking himself very seriously
And there are probably a lot of people that are angry about that and think I've gone crazy
"Why am I not screwing up my face? Why am I not trying to be the best grime MC?"
I'm trying to make nice relaxing songs
Whats my problem? I haven't got a problem, its just that I stopped taking myself so god damn seriously
Thats it. Have a good day
