Do you ever just have the urge to kill?
Do you ever just have the urge to kill?
Do you ever just have the urge to kill?
Do you ever just have the urge to kill?

[Verse 1 : Akala]

Riddle me this, riddle me that
If murder runs the globe and this we know and accept
What do we expect but mass murders to live happily
Those who really fight for freedom to face tragedy
When you really look at the world do you feel a sickness
Couple dead kids in the world, its just business
Arm sales economy, added to the GDP
Maybe its just me, maybe I’m naive
Though I’m not Siamese, I do feel your pain
And I do believe, though maybe I'm insane
The state murder is still murder its still murder
There’s no fight that’s big enough to conceal murder
Lets make a movie and celebrate our real murder
Pay a rapper to glorify, nigga, kill, murder
But never question your oppressors or suggest murder
Should be directed in your betters that invest murder
I wonder is it absurd that we protest murder
Cause clearly they haven’t heard that we detest murder
However much we detest, we cannot deny
That murder has both helped and harmed you and I
And anybody, everybody has a human right
To defend themselves from oppressors with a greater might
I look around this world, such a bloody sight
I wanna know

[Hook : Akala]

Do you ever just have the urge to kill?
When you realize that peace can't work cause they don’t respect peace
Oh the feeling is so real!
When you see that murder’s legal when it’s done by police, the beast
Do you ever just have the urge to kill?
When you see a child’s body like a dog in the streets believe
Oh the feeling is so real!
When there is no justice and we can't breath
Do you ever just have the urge to kill?

[Verse 2 : Akala]
Terrorism is its own religion practiced by millions
Obviously not just Muslim but also Jewish and Christian
Atheist, Hindu, Buddhist
Since when has belief
Ever stopped human beings
From being bullies
They pretend one terror is worse terror
Even while they sponsor their terror it works better
Even while they bomb their countries and burn them up
Even while they colonize them with no letter
And we, what do we do? Pay tax to them
Maybe I’m a coward
No war was ever one by dickheads with a mic shoutin’
Rappers can't bring you liberation
Just articulating do you share these frustrations that I am facing?
Are you one of these assholes like me
That believes there’s a better world that we could be?
But knows that It won't come so easily
And revolutionary love there needs to be
Everyone has the right to defend the one they love
And no uniform gives you the right to shed my blood
If the courts systematically denies what we’re legally due
What should we do? (tell me)
Should we pray to heaven and wait for better and hope that it comes true?
Or, defend ourselves from you
Cos it’s only when you aim your violence at your oppressors that it's taboo
I wanna know

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Akala]

Nations and nuclear bombs and colonizers
Applaud us for our silence reward us for non violence
While supporting old tyrants
Calling them all clients
They bought them with a fortune a slice of the empire
Of course they haven't taught them torture is a science
To which you should resort to kill frauds and defiers
Feel the force of the fires
Petrol poured on the tires
Bet it more than retires
Whoever's caught in the wires
Several daughters in silence
Whichever mothers are crying
Justice is just like anything
If you can't afford to buy it than you starve
This is our world that I'm describing
It's too much!

[Hook]
