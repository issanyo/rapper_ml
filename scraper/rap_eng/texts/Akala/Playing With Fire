'Playing With Fire' Lyrics

TY

You’re, you’re playing with fire fire fire fire
X4
Even with inner city inner vision you can never really be sure
Who’s gonna make things raw and bring madness to the door
It can even start with your mates, trying to burglarise your gates
Asking you funny questions like (are you coming home late?)
Crackheads in my postbox trying to make me lose my calm then you smile in my face when I put a pound coin in your palm put a fist to your nostril
Get a court case and a hostel and a bad rap from the judge and a snide glance and a grudge
They say hold it down I say down here sucks like I don't want big bucks
Let me interrupt
Before I press self destruct and blow this up
Everything that I worked for may end up fucked
People wanna act like I owe them big golden notes
Make me wanna put the mic down and start holding folks
But the truth is its a roller coast no excuses my friend we can all be ghosts

AKALA

From the local to the global it’s the same old saga
Got to get one up to come up, play with the fire
What do we teach our peeps if they want to reach higher?
Little bit of bleach, or leach or just preach your messiah
But the wisdom you speak can’t beat your attire
In a place where what is sacred is our desire
Get whatever you can get but forget your neck
Cos they coming for heads when they collect them debts
Whether it’s the few suits that you used to think is cute
Or a beef in the street with a heat and some local yutes
It’s the same game when they take aim gotta maintain for the fame
But we’re insane cos we maintain with the most dangerous pain
We can blame rain because it never came and rearranged all the flames
But chains only change when we rearrange our own brain
Can we really do it? I don’t know maybe you can tell me?
Everybody playing with the fire to get wealthy is it healthy?

TY

Folks on the floor claiming postcodes I do not own
Gotta lotta bad temptations facing me at home
Wanna fly like a bird by sky high with my words but why
Bring sand to the beach if the lifeguard keeps your mouth shut dry
Never been okay but what you gonna do crochet?
Won't settle for the hockey cokey or the okey doke
Have to play it low key tho kick it aikido in the place in your face always try to kick it to the people...
The unspoken word rarely heard at all rap and spoken word favourite final call
People know what they’re doing when they tamper with the process
Trapped in dirt when I'm trying to see more than Capt Kirk
On the enterprise re-energise don't apologise we epitomise (fire)
And of course you get burned every time you play with it
Number one youth music all over the world savour it...

DURRTY GOODZ

I told them I'm gonna make it
I told them I'm gonna take it
I told them when I'm coming out I ain't coming out no fake shit
So whenever you see me hustle an whenever me trying
Don't ever try knock that hustle somebody’s gonna end up dying
What do you know about hours in the studio
All night til your so damned tired
But you gotta go work in the morning then the boss tells you that your fired
An you’re like "What the fuck, what's this?!" I gotta feed the fam an pay the bills
Christmas is coming, my misses is running, I'm getting evicted, feeling restricted, could end up convicted, not what predicted, I gotta fix it an what's it all over this shit
I'm missing my brother
I nearly lost my life three times
Man have been dissin my mother
Coz I be spitting the lava
What a Palaver Lord they wanna bring me beef drama but let my enemies scatter as we continue the saga
Forgive them father
They not know what they've done ruining what I've been doing makes me go harder
Playing with the fire get burned learn!
