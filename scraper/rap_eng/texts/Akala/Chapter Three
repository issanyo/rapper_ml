Then I snapped out of the vision
Couldn't remember where I was, shit it took me a minute
All I could hear was sirens ringing
Why am I stood here with this pistol gripping
Bredren pulling at my shirt and screaming to run
I don't know why I should come
My legs moved anyway, ran across the highroad
Back to the block, in his flat, closed the blindfold
We're safe now it's a state where you don't go
AIn't nobody gonna talk to the po-po
Couple man, ballies on their face, gats on their waist
Shit, ain't no tale to relate
I knew right there I was faking the pavement
I was destined for stages and pages
The inspiration that I came with, I can't explain it
You probably think I create it
The current comes through, I just conduct it
Practice my shit, then put the trust in energy
From the visions that I've seen
It's like a dream but a much more vivid scene
The energy
From the visions that dwell in me
And provide a guide as if they were a spell on me
Inevitably though we all put them secondary
But we gotta follow if we are to overcome the lethargy
Done all this and kept my integrity
Spat the same politics, who ain't legendary?
Yeah right
That brings us back to last night
