Ep.1 ( 00:12 ):
Double-time sixteen this week, let's go deep
It's so peak when I speak for the road geeks
So cheap when you speak that you won't reach
Anybody, not your boys or your own peeps
Little chief want beef? Look, no teeth
In his mouth cos he doubted the bro’s teep
That’s a front kick
For you dumb shits
That don’t know we throw flows and punches
Where you livin at, munchkin?
You don’t know that Akalas been munchin?
Emcees like Saltfish, Dumpling
Or better yet like free school lunches
So full of shit that I shouldn’t even touch him
But I do cos I’m just that hungry
Ravenous, valorous, abracadabrous
Amateur emcees get dead in front of cameras
Scratch that we’re takin’ any challengers
Whatever caliber can't match my stamina
Look king you ain't on this ting like him
You never grew up on Sting
Your guard's weak and there’s holes in your chin
While I’m cold with the flow, John Jones in the ring
Your like Man that go gym, but never do squats
Foundation’s weak so you’re easily dropped
While I’ve got more bodies than a Chinese cemetery
Done duppied a million men with the pen already
Claim that you’re on dis ting, ya never ready
Didn't your mum tell you lies ain't necessary?
And Uncle Akala will punish you for lying
Kid Leviathan, I have been
You’re sweet as a hyacinth
Knowledge is Power Volume 2
Next year again we will see who’s who


Ep.2 ( 01:27 ):
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness
Those words uttered by the owners of people
Problem with being an oppressor
Talkin’ about freedom
Is the people you oppress may start to believe you
And act on the words you say
And make the owner way
How can such noble thoughts come from a wicked source
Of course
It gives me cause to think
Are the words even worth the cost of the ink?
If they change their meaning when the powerful say
So we can fight for freedom even the freedom to own slaves
These words these prostitutes with no standard
That sell themselves to anyone who can utter the language
And get fucked by the highest bidder
So the life is bitter for most
We can all toast to the glam and glitter
And go ham on twitter
And instagram a picture
But can't stop the police from executing
…children

Ep.3 ( 02:13 ):
Life’s a bitch then ya die right don’t ya?
But if you don’t die right, where does your soul go to?
Harder than the questions of life, I will approach ya
Two fists up by my eyes like i'm suppose to
Smokin' more than every fiend in Camden town
If ya ever believe that I’ll be beat by a hand me down, bloody clown
Ever since Cuban linx came in on import
Been sharper than swords so I can reign within this sport
Look at me now, Dessalines with the machete’
Take a slavemaster head off, quick if you let me
Bet me everything you own clone
But this bloody throne’s stuck to the back of my arse
Like sweaty boxers
Steppin’ in my zone homes
No, I suggest you don't
You can't budge me an inch, much less get him off it
So stop it, no profit Come off it you little novice
They don’t make ‘em like this anymore
We rap scholars


Ep.4 ( 02:52 ):
Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
Those words uttered by the owners of flesh
Show us philosophy is dead, if it's just an idea
Without real-life practical steps
Oh is that so? Is the life of the mind no longer valid?
If we don't live what we think through daily habits
I'm embarrassed to say, everyday I betray
How I think I'd like to live in this world, am I insane?
Or the same as the hypocrites that I do disdain
What would I do in their shoes? I know what I'd like to claim
But there's no way we could say, how we would behave
If we had a whole different life up to this day
Is it innate? Encoded in our DNA?
Or in the spirit that is born in this body that we enslave
What is happiness for you might be hell for me
Do you still get to pursue it to the fullest degree?
We'll see


Ep.5:( 03:39 ):
Gordon Bennet, I’m flabbergasted
Smart bastard, so bloody clever that it’s just retarded
I don’t recite my charges, nor my type of garments
Tryna hype the hardests like half of these spineless bastards
Who’s the rhyming artist
My timin I have harnessed
I’m shinin’ blinding partners the finest you find in varnish
It’s my time regardless
If I should die with martyrs
Know that I was old school like Jamaican partners
But I’m ahead of my time and the energy I harness
Brilliant and like equivalent to 4 million karmas
My brain power’s insane power I’ve never charted
Yet I’m known around the world for cremating carcass
Of these half baked emcees that think they’re masters
But they ain't nothing but a scam, like the naija pastors
Go preaching to the people, but listen harder
And you will hear that it’s just bollocks like I am the dog’s


Ep.6:( 04:21 ):
The flow’s complex
You need music theory to see what is coming next
The crotchets and minus the riddims I will devour
You botched it but I’m killin a million villains an hour
Sour are the faces of racists who face the power
Even though they chat a shower of shit, they’re really cowards
So if I do allow it to hit, you man are out
I’m more unconscious than you are already you ain't about it
So just allow it
Don’t stand the fuck up, nah have a seat
If you’re so road then go back to the street
But never, rap on a beat you’re crap I promise
Your friends are not your friends cos clearly they are not honest
You can trust uncle Akala to keep it real
And cos I signed myself I’m always keepin the deal
Ain't been on commercial radio since 2006
Performed in 50 countries since so
Who gives a shit, huh?


Ep.7:( 05:03 ):
Life liberty in the pursuit of property
Probably woulda been more proper terminology
To explain the world envisioned by a monopoly
What do we do with this world we’ve inherited
What is happiness for you?
What do you pursuit?
Wealth for the few as long as you’re enjoying the view?
And what does wealth guarantee?
Some peace of mind, regular blowjobs and cars that are nicely designed?
I’m being superficial
It also guarantees that your children’s school won't get hit by a missile
On the unlikely event that it does
It will be fucking hell to pay for a memorial written in blood
Money don’t buy happiness, probably true
What if it buys the closest thing then what do we do?
What good is it loving all of the simple things
If the power the money brings takes em away at your whim


Ep.8:( 05:46 ):
So the saga runs on
This is still London same Billy with a truncheon
Now aimin their guns on
Shots to the sternum
Cock Back Burn ‘em
Or choke an immigrant incase you brothers ain't learnin
Here’s a little reminder
The symbolic debt
Like, when they use to hange ‘em and tag ‘em for stealin bread
And all you were focused ons what the victim evolved with
Where they on the road did they wear a hoodie or smoke spliffs?
Couldn’t give a shit if they licked a million shots
Death penalty has been abolished, has it not?
And I seen way more drugs at Glastonbury than Carnival
But they don’t feel the need to send the police with arms at all
And while the paedophiles walk free
Public enemy number one my brother its still you and me
To see what’s going on, you ain't gotta be a clever sod
It’s all about race and class just like it ever was


Ep.9:( 06:30 ):
This love is a drug
The way it affects the run of your blood
Never to snub, but always eventually they do succumb
Overrun, by thoughts that make you withering on
Your own mum or anyone who has a slip of the tongue
And there’s the question
While you’re collecting tremendous sums
While people are living in simplest villages even the wickedest slums
Despite all the image and acting so innocent all of the pillaging’s done
So you relax not knowing the facts of how it actually come
What’s next will power lose the head on it’s neck?
And will the one that comes after be like a master grafter?
Or more disaster cos history’s not a class in laughter?
But yesterday is not tomorrow so why do I trouble to answer
I ain't sure if any war was fought for the poor
Any persons working with a motive that is totally pure
What I do know is the powerful won't hand it over
You gotta take it but nature might make you even colder


Ep.10:( 07:17 ):
I drop a sixteen? Everything dead
I’m Akala
Cos my dad’s black, I fool the whole world
Like Obama
They really think I care about life, nah you’re mad
I murk everything on the dance done you’re sad
I had, quite a good time
And spat, quite a good rhyme
Cos mine’s, quite a good mind
For time, mic would shine
Sublime, bring who you could find
Cousins don’t worry us
It’s not school, we are grown men
Well some of us
Trouble us, bless you
Sweet heart you’re special
Suck it up, don’t show pain, it’s just a flesh wound
Test whom? Don’t do it to yourself
That’s just disaster
Like an honest third world leader in private planes that are chartered
You are not a martyr if you die for no reason
Cos you look like food, and we were hunting this season
High treason to a royal emcee
Is when you mimic me
I am the metaphor and you are just a simile


Ep.11:( 08:01 ):
This week, we offered our condolences
To a Muslim, with a beard, some say that’s strange
But they don’t understand the way that we played the game
We don’t care about religion, what’s in a name
As long as you pump oil for us keep the price cheap
You can behead who you want the deal’s quite sweet
Help us to bomb other Arabs from the military bases we have in your lands
But you don’t have in ours
We’ll give you Rolls Royce’s, yes flashy cars
Pay you billions of pounds yes, we’ll make you stars
A reformer, quite enlightened, funding the terrorism that we claim to be fighting
So its only right that we fly the flags at half mast
Send the prime minister over seas to kiss your ass
Who said hypocrisy they don’t know the rules
Democracy is just a bloody word sentimental fools!
Uncle Pompous!


Ep.12:( 09:50 ):
Conservative rap shout to white billionaires
Heirs to the throne of global capitalism
Built on the back of niggers
Literally in actual figures
Centuries of labor unpaid, it had to equip us
With fuel for the engine
Fools stop pretending
We have not provided the answer to each and every question
You don't worship us and brown imitators
Then it's obvious to all that you blatantly hate us
Matters not how we got our paper, even enslavement
Or dead Congolese kids today for mineral payments
What matters is you worship blindly things over people
See yourself as less than equal
In the world that we teach you
If you have not, you be not
Swing from the treetops
All you little monkeys should know by now that we not
Of the same species, we're more human than you
That's why you worship us you dickheads, proving it's true


Ep.13:( 10:36 ):
Have you ever never had a pot to piss in bruv?
While living round the corner from those that swim in grub
Have you ever gone to school, stomach still rumbling?
Rich kids coming in, ten pound for lunch on 'em
Have you ever felt the resentment of not having shit?
Knowing your mother works as hard as those who are arrogant
Talking 'bout pull yourself up by the socks, bloody snobs
You started the race with a fifty pace head start, of course you're gone
We started from the beginning, had to carry baggage
Parents didn't have two cars, a home, and a lovely marriage
But that's life right?
We all play our cards
But ours are scarred and marked
So we put 'em in bars that's hard as [?]
Or not
Rep the underground dirt
But still tour round the whole globe, shouts to Kool Herc
We're so focused on our slice of the bread
Forgot to say if you're still at the bottom it's cool, hold your head
It don't make you less


Ep.14:( 11:22 ):
I was six years old when I first heard Public Enemy
I knew in an instant me and hip-hop was meant to be
Shivers down my spine
Hearing a rhyme
Goosebumps on my skin
And the feeling within
All the pain and the rage that the music was cathartic for
You probably wouldn't know if you ain't seen the hardships before
Maybe you would, maybe that's the beauty of it
Anyone, anywhere relate to the topic
Wu-Tang came out with Shaolin philosophy
Bit of martial arts and some fruit from the knowledge tree
And hood tales, you know, poverty, robbery
Where childhood friends die for not much, probably
Felt they made their songs for my ears and fears
Cos boys like me were not allowed to cry tears
So here's a couple bars for them pioneers
Without you, you know we wouldn't be here


Ep.15:( 12:03 ):
Hip hop spoke to what we saw on our front doors
The black CNN, and so much more
African oral tradition evolving through Jazz and blues
Griots rappin’ from back in the day as a way to spread the news
Until came from Jamaica, blazing amazing sounds
On the back of Hercules hip hop came to the Bronx with sound
A decade before, the same Caribbean
Our grandparents left to the shores of the Europeans
So we never learnt to rap watching Music television
This is our culture grew up on them sound systems
Now hip hop is global beyond imagination
We still can't allow its roots to be forsaken
So I’m makin' a statement and engraving it on London’s pavement
For the founding fathers and mothers for this art that we’re making

Ep.16:( 12:46 ):
