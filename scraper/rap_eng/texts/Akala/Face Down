Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt
Since the playground, sucka for a flirt
Now ya lay down, face down.
Lay down, face in the dirt

It amazes me, all the things that we’ll do to get it
Talk about it a little, next thing forget it
It’ll rule your whole life if you let it
I don’t believe that it’s only every 6 seconds
Constant drones for those with testosterone
You know that a dog's gotta chase his bone
Wherever it’s thrown, however far from home
You need to lay down, face down
Once blood starts flowin’, and hair starts growin’
And curves start showin’, and we get our toe in
Jump in with both feet, so deep we nearly drown
Got nothing to say unless it’s around
Chasin’ it, gettin’ it, tastin’ it, excellent
Look how I’m flexin’ it
Every endeavor becomes just another clever way to lay down, face down.

Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt
Since the playground, sucka for a flirt
Now ya lay down, face down.
Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt

I’m not sure if women know the things men do
Maybe you do and you’re just the same too
But it’s the only reason we go to the gym
Get a trim, and try to better him
It’s why we study, just to get money
So when we step to you, you won’t look at us funny
Even the stealin’ and drug dealers
The pressure to just look appealin’
So you can look our way and we can get the feelin’
And what do you think is the motivation?
Why a man will take another man’s nation?
Same struggle, just on a bigger level
For us fellas, this is our peacock feathers
And I’m not saying that women are to blame
I’m just sayin’ if you didn’t give us any less to change
We’d change very quickly
Believe what I’m sayin’, maybe you’re the same
It’s always on the brain.

Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt
Since the playground, sucka for a flirt
Now ya lay down, face down.
Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt
Since the playground, sucka for a flirt
Now ya lay down, face down

And don’t get me wrong, I ain’t knockin’ a bit of fun
I’m just sayin’ when you’ve got a million sons
All over the gaffe and you don’t see one
You have to ask yourself, is it really fun?
How many homes you broke
Because the little head was stronger than the bigger head?
Ain’t enough we gotta get a bigger bed?
And I ain’t sayin’ I’m better, fellas I’m never
I’m sayin’ imagine we use that energy instead of just-

Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt
Since the playground, sucka for a flirt
Now ya lay down, face down.
Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt
Since the playground, sucka for a flirt
Now ya lay down, face down

All of the things that we will do
Is all we try to get with you
And all the nonsense that we say
In the hope that you will look our way
All day every day, it’s on our mind
And when we stray we pay the price
But we take a chance and roll the dice
And we just end up

Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt
Since the playground, sucka for a flirt
Now ya lay down, face down.
Lay down, face in the dirt
From the waist down, chasin' the skirt
Since the playground, sucka for a flirt
Now ya lay down, face down
