Conform x15

[Verse 1]
It's bigger than your local colloquium
In a world that is dystopian
Kid's aren't born in fallopians
They're grown in tubes and inserted growth in them
Dust is choking them
But this ain't the type of pollution we place in the ocean
It's apathy, stench we can't quench
Don't matter who inhabits the bench
Or wig or gown, hammer or crown, oval or down
Jokes on us, we're not even frowning
Much less pissed off
We're switched off
Smiling villany, the wickedest tyranny
Is the one that says fuck you so nice
You say thanks, and shake hands
Say he's your man, forget all your plans
Reach your hand out you see your in bondage
The idea of beauty is blondeness and other such nonsense
What our response is?
Conform and amputate conscience

[Hook] x 4
Conform. Obey
Transform. Sleep easy

[Verse 2]
Ah, that good old human conditioning
Ever since days of the pyramids
Make us invalid, which means invalid
Wrestle with things we can't manage
Like peace and equality
Which minority is the authority?
Whoever has property, it's all idolatry
Even if you have no image of God, do you follow me?
Do we not all worship money?
When you think about it it's quite funny
Can't eat money, can't breathe money
Can't inject it and kill disease money
But we pray at it all till we're guns and tanks
And offer the money god a million sacraficial lambs
Who's the priest in charge of sacraficial plans?
Let us pray and hold hands
War is peace - ignorance strength - freedom is slavery x3
Not only do we believe that creed
We hold it deep and praise it as bravery
Yeah
Along with the vision and difference
So we can maintain the belligerence
To their pain, feel no shame
It's all just stages in a video game
That our kids play kill, kill, kill
Death is such a thrill, thrill, thrill
Swallow junk, still feel ill
Take blue pill, pill, pill

[Hook] x3

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind
I do beliee our nature's kind
Just confused and we're so far gone
Got no clue how to right these wrongs
So we bury our head in the sand or the desk
Anywhere but inside of our flesh
If I looked at my self - I would see I am the enemy
I am not honest nor kind nor caring nor sharing
Or any of the many thing that I pretend to be
I'm selfish and arrogant, and obedient
Follow truth only when it's convenient
Accept laws that I know that decieve me
So I can sleep in my bed easy
Don't blame governments, they are just us
If they are corrupt, then we are corrupt
Look back through history
What makes you think that we would act differently?
If we were in power
We would devourer whoever the underclass were like cowards
The question is, is this inevitable?
Is there good or evil?
Is it terrible?
Or just survival?
Some say it's overspill from days when we were tribal
I don't buy that I think you will find that
That's an excuse if we just don't buy facts
Everything we really need to survive actually makes us feel good inside
Sex feels good, food feels good
Damn, even taking a pill feels good!
So if war and hate were our natural causes
Why would we need conditioning for it?
But I ain't gonna forfeit my privilliges
Now I'll get back in line and follow my orders
