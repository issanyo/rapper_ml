[Verse 1: Lowkey]

So many men say they're revolutionary
But they don’t really know what revolution would mean
It would mean blood and it would mean pain
But it could be us who bring that change
Each bar that I publish
Is blasting for justice
Regard your partners as parliament puppets
Acknowledge me on behalf of the public
Abolish the Queen we demand a republic
Little hypocrites are spitting typical nonsense
I'm a black bull because of political content
Laugh at my people while you criminals bomb them
Militant on the rhythm, I'm killing you with a song then
History you won't read in a textbook
Kunta Kinte, I bleed from my left foot
Never see me on the TV with Jedward
Tell the BBC they need me on Westwood
Screw [?] crack head
You don’t crack heads
You’re crew don’t pack texts
Do those whack sets
Do a whole track that says who sold crack best
Salute though, kudos to Hugo Chavez
Forget the ice on your hand and your Rolly
When it’s on top get your [?] from Sony
Mangle, dismantle, and cancel your cronies
Till I go out like Diana and Dodi
Talk about my race, why is it funny?
Forget Ayrab, you’re getting Zionist’s money
Sicker than sickle-cell
And my names rings bells
Might be taking me lightly cos my skins pale
I can get dark, more dark than the dark moor
I can get dark like a dark night in Dartmoor
Dark like Darfur at half past four, AM
So why you dummies getting daft for?

[Hook: Black The Ripper]

[Verse 2: Black The Ripper]

I’m on the revolution ting
I’m on the Huey Newton ting
All these clones are watching the throne
But I think we all know who’s the King
They’re on this Martin Luther ting
I’m more like Malcolm X without the specs
When I speak you hear me loud and clear
Fuck police, I say that loud and clear
Law abiding, fuck out here
My people struggling out here
Goin’ jail hustlin’ out here
Cos the government don’t give us nothing out here
Sometimes I need a sign so I ask God and get nothing but air
And you wonder why we’re living in [?]
And you know what’s the wickedest ting?
No one gives a shit, we’re just letting them win
The minority control the majority
They tax our wages, that’s robbery
They’re already rich, we’re living in poverty
Dishonesty and hypocrisy
Nine to five life, that’s not for me
What the heck?
Keep your cheque
One grand a month can’t pay my rent
I ain’t scared, I run up in the Lion’s den
Till the royal family give up lying for Lent
There’s people in the army dying for them
David Cameron’s family got rich of the slave trade
Now it’s 2004 and he’s got you on a slave wage
Fuck that and fuck them
I don’t pick cotton blud

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akala]

Everybody anybody talk revolution shit
But do we really know what revolution is?
Fighting, but enlightened
All of the guns are controlled by the tyrants
Don’t get me wrong, we defend ours
But real revolution is who we are
Long as I drive a car
Wanna be stars
As the world starves
Just get ours
Far from a part that is hard to regard
As nothing but the darkest part of the scars
Cos we march and we dance
And we chant and we prance
But can’t advance past our past fast
Caught in division, war for religion
Mental prison, nationalism
Flag is a cloth that wrapped round your head
Proud as a shroud to wrap round the dead
We’re bound by the clowns that backed down and said:
We’re bound to be bound, go back down to bed
Long as we see borders and orders
Of course we’ll resort to retort till they’re taught with our forces
Or just act brainless, avoid the fact that they chain us
And all the crimes that are heinous, and hope that we can get famous
But Guevara t-shirts are not revolution
I ain't saying I've got the solution
To curb our greed of redistributing
The wealth of the earth to those of our choosing
Real revolution, wanna be a part of it?
Turn off the TV, read, start of it
Malcolm was reading, Gandhi was reading
Toussaint was reading, though he died bleeding
We have that man to thank for our freedom
We die for dumb shit, why not die for freedom?
We have that man to thank for our freedom
We die for dumb shit, why not die for freedom?

[Hook]
