[Verse 1: Akala]
Real supporters like real things so thanks
No deal but passport bookings are full of stamps
So much so, had to get the new one done
Your crew run run, every time a new one come
Cause a verse from Akala is harder than time in Abu Ghraib
With the same sense of injustice, put em to their grave
Slaves to a better king, great its American
But that ain't impressing em, chains got to bury them
I slay with the best of them, pray for the rest of them
First immaculate birth since the manger in Bethlehem
Three wise men came and gave me the blessings then
Head grew bigger for my brain to develop in
Same as the heroine, to veins full of melanin
Shit that I'm peddalin', it's death to your brethren
Yes better cherish him the best there has ever been
From this side of the pond, I'm a Bond with a better trim
But I don't work for MI6, quite the opposite
I fight Imperialism but couldn't put a stop to it
Cause outside of the lyric realm
I ain’t Superman
The world we live in is fucked, like the bars I spit
You don't know the half of it, how much smarter can Arthur get
The only joker round here is you, so we laugh at it
They tell you that I’ve mastered it, I’m just practising
I always represent my class like Thatcher did
But I am not a privileged prick of a politician
I am the broken home with no pot to piss in
So if you stop to listen you would know that I'm badder
Than any other thing that has ever been made of matter
My whole head's gone like I've been shot with a cannon
Think I need treatment better check Frantz Fanon
Who said it wouldn't happen they lapping up all the knowledge
Many other conscious MC's are boring lets just be honest
Akala's on some other shit love...
Yes I did just refer to myself in the third person, what a mug
But the grub that my belly's now having, I had to scrap em'
Every single inch of the way to get it cracking
It almost never happened but you decided to back him
So the passion that I'm rapping with, they could never fathom
Cause their spirit don’t feel it, its why they're so idiot
Want to tempt fate, that's great, lets seal it, I mean it
More that any word that you've ever heard
For all the street scholars still stuck on the kerb
For the road and the pavement, I don’t romanticise
I see structural poverty and I analyse
Gentrification fucking us up
We gonna have it?
Town planners trying to turn London into Paris
A rich white centre with a ring of estates
Where all the chavs and the immigrants go. Is that our fate?
Just enough poor people left to clean up the dirt
Go kill yourselves in the sticks where the shots can’t be heard
Leave the centre to the civilised people, to improve
You know the type that want to have their carnival without coons
Move you little paupers; fuck your sons and daughters
Your lives and your communities are not important
We can all pretend that it's just market forces
Rather than the social engineering which it of course is
They say they don’t believe in hand outs, fucking liars
Look how we bailed out the banks and didn’t nationalise them
You can make it if your enterprising right? Try it, just like I did
That’s what I'm supposed to say, when you ask me how my life is
But that ignores the facts and all the things that I have seen
All the blood that's put before my eyes when I was just a teen
I ain't being dramatic
Or beggin’ gangster life
Truth is though I did do wrong, I’m living on borrowed time
Rappers rhymes starting to sound clever, like they borrowed mine
You learn nothing from me it MUST be that you ain’t got to sign
Ain’t got to hide it from them brother if you got a mind
Did our people not bleed for the right to read in another time
Watch the youths back in Yard, back in Nigeria
Do they reject knowledge? Are we serious?
So whose culture is it then for us to act foolish?
Who we entertaining and serving with our bullshit
With my dreads, with my picky head, with my hoody on
Chief up these so called scholars go off and write a song
Yeah I think deeply, man is so neeky
But still box man in their mouth for getting cheeky
Think I'm exceptional? That's not true
I’m like most of my brothers that grew up on the Wu
I don’t respect a lack of honesty or authenticity
Ready for anyone think they can talk to me lyrically
Physically, I ain’t superman nor a massive dude
But train everyday like a soldier, what you thought this is?
We talk this revolution shit, and not be super fit
How you gonna fight a battle soldier if you ain’t used to it
Fizzy drinks, packet of crisps, chicken and chips
Nah fam, green banana and yam we go HAM
Make your shit stand strong when you're still an old man
Check the Rastas in the hills back in Yard you’ll understand
What’s the plan?
Keep em dumb and distracted and unhealthy
Perfect recipe for keeping themselves wealthy
Anywho
Murdering mics, daily I duppy, little yuppies, that's to scared of the trenches, I'm forever muddy
A roadside brainiac, I’ve forever studied
Couple man mistook me for a prick, look what they discovered
I tell jokes all the time, I’m forever funny
Ha-bloody-Ha you really thought that I would let you mug it
We speak gully cause we're still tuggy
Though we, deeper than gullys and we ruin countries
And you, needn’t have worry cause it's all covered
Look how we, feeding them knowledge and they will love it
Yeeaah
Fuck your conditioning, rap nitroglycerine
Glistening like the top of the pyramids on you invalids
We all know who the winner is, don’t shit where your dinner is, Man rap about food but couldn’t even finish his
You’re hungry? I'm starving, look at my ribs inch’ning
The baby n' it's bedtime, maybe I should sing to him
A sweet little lullaby, put em to sleep
It's so peak for the other guy cause he ain’t me
Most of you speak 'bout the gully side and put me to sleep
Cause you’re a chief and you cannot rhyme, better believe
Uncle Akala is the hardest out
Everybody says this
And it's no secret why I don’t make playlist
But tour tickets selling out, novels self published
My life’s all good, I enjoy my summers
But I am what I am, council house, single mother
So won’t get arrogant from a little bit of abundance
As long as I puncture trying to manufacture dry schemes I’m already done with
Run through that stage in like seven, I'm on my shaolin monk shit
One finger push up, a blade in the neck
Iron shirt, qigong you can't fake the respect
Much less, [?] a vet, I'm as brave as cadet
In Dessalines army, what the fuck you expect?
NEEEEEEXXXXT
