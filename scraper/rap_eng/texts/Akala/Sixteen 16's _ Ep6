The flow’s complex
You need music theory to see what is coming next
The crotchets and minus the riddims I will devour
You botched it but I’m killin a million villains an hour
Sour are the faces of racists who face the power
Even though they chat a shower of shit, they’re really cowards
So if I do allow it to hit, you man are out
I’m more unconscious than you are already you ain't about it
So just allow it
Don’t stand the fuck up, nah have a seat
If you’re so road then go back to the street
But never, rap on a beat you’re crap I promise
Your friends are not your friends cos clearly they are not honest
You can trust uncle Akala to keep it real
And cos I signed myself I’m always keepin the deal
Ain't been on commercial radio since 2006
Performed in 50 countries since so
Who gives a shit, huh?
