[Akala:Verse 1]

Double-time sixteen this week, let's go deep
It's so peak when I speak for the road geeks
So cheap when you speak that you won't reach
Anybody, not your boys or your own peeps
Little chief want beef? Look, no teeth
In his mouth cos he doubted the bro’s teep
That’s a front kick
For you dumb shits
That don’t know we throw flows and punches
Where you livin at, munchkin?
You don’t know that Akalas been munchin?
Emcees like Saltfish, Dumpling
Or better yet like free school lunches
So full of shit that I shouldn’t even touch him
But I do cos I’m just that hungry
Ravenous, valorous, abracadabrous
Amateur emcees get dead in front of cameras
Scratch that we’re takin’ any challengers
Whatever caliber can't match my stamina
Look king you ain't on this ting like him
You never grew up on Sting
Your guard's weak and there’s holes in your chin
While I’m cold with the flow, John Jones in the ring
You're like Man that go gym, but never do squats
Foundation’s weak so you’re easily dropped
While I’ve got more bodies than a Chinese cemetery
Done duppied a million men with the pen already
Claim that you’re on dis ting, ya never ready
Didn't your mum tell you lies ain't necessary?
And Uncle Akala will punish you for lying
Kid Leviathan, I have been
You’re sweet as a hyacinth
Knowledge is Power Volume 2
Next year again we will see who’s who
