[Verse 1: Akala]
I was the kid in school with hand me downs from my sister
And gal dem still loved me now that’s charisma
Front of my crep split ain’t seen a barber for months
But the way I profile you would have thought I was Trump
Back when I was spotty and my head way outgrew my body
Even those times spittin' it shoddy
Before I bust my first nut behind the trees in the park
You’d find me and Jay drunk way after dark
Bams too, looking for moves like bees do swarming
Funny thing we all got ball in the morning
We like thirteen but grown as we see it
You find us any Saturday night in Coliseum
Sticking d*ck to big gal and I told her my age straight
Never been one to play games
Or watch face or none of that
Pop shots I’m gunning back
No ball to catch
Look how these cowards running back

[Hook: Selah]
No matter what they say to you
No matter what they put you through
Always to yourself stay true
You gotta hold your head up high
When you feel you’ve hit the ground
And they seem to laugh out loud
Whatever goes up must come down
You gotta hold your head high

[Verse 2: Akala]
For my young tugs on every block, eighth in their sock
With aims to get paid and parade in the drop
Sweet kids get older, grow chips on both shoulders
Daddy left it seems the wind done blow colder
Even in july, that’s why we hoodied the whole year
Mothers lose sons when them clouds disappear
Nothin' sweet out here, but I count my blessings
Been through a lot of shit, but I take it as lessons
Just a young yout that ain’t never had nothing
Many times went to school stomach still rumblin
Still felt like I had a right to f**k
Brought gal to my yard and the power would cut
While yutes sleeping, I’m at the launderette before school
With big bin liners still trying to look cool
At the time it was hell, now I just laugh
Funny how you change the way you feel about the past

[Bridge: Selah] x 2
Hold your head up, hold your head up
I know you're fed up but you gotta get up
Hold your head up, hold your head up
Never let up cos you've gotta get up

[Verse 3: Akala]
If they put your back to the wall, you gotta stand tall
Don’t watch these little dicks, all they do is talk
Fuck em all I’m rollin, real niggas’ll roll wid it
Yeah life’s a bitch, but I still wanna hit it
Spit what’s real to me nothing more nothing less
Niggas ain’t got no homes, but roll with stones around they neck
Can’t you see you’re the diamond, always shining
Plus the only thing tough enough to break us is us

[Hook]
