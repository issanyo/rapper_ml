[Verse 1: Akala]

Life’s a bitch then ya die right don’t ya?
But if you don’t die right, where does your soul go to?
Harder than the questions of life, I will approach ya
Two fists up by my eyes like i'm suppose to
Smokin' more than every fiend in Camden town
If ya ever believe that I’ll be beat by a hand me down, bloody clown
Ever since Cuban linx came in on import
Been sharper than swords so I can reign within this sport
Look at me now, Dessalines with the machete’
Take a slavemaster head off, quick if you let me
Bet me everything you own clone
But this bloody throne’s stuck to the back of my arse
Like sweaty boxers
Steppin’ in my zone homes
No, I suggest you don't
You can't budge me an inch, much less get him off it
So stop it, no profit Come off it you little novice
They don’t make ‘em like this anymore
We rap scholars
