[Instrumental: Biggie Smalls "Dead Wrong"]

[Bella Gotti]
Every chick wanna be bad
So they rap about experiences they've never had
Their boy's seatbelt is the closest thing they ever getting to strapped
And she ain't ever chipped a nail and yet she's spittin' ‘bout crack
They got her gassed she think she’s bad, lookin like a bag of money
If that’s the case bitch then you’re a big sack of pennies
My niggas make it rain, I’m dancing in the rain
Gene Kelly, and every box they drop has smelt smelly
Had my black hair swinging like I'm straight from New Delhi
My niggas hit him up while he was pumping Mackaveli
Out the Bentley,
I'm spitting for the fun of it
So please don’t tempt me, I get a kick out of making all these fucking bitches resent me
Look at my time in this game, it's lengthy
Confidence? I've got plenty, strut like I’m an untouchable
No (?) me
Chill with the realest chick all day
She my reflection, my shadow, her name's Nolay

[Akala]
Uh, Uh, listen yo, uh
Good afternoon, you can call me uncle Akala the flow father
With a mind that works much like Assata’s
I’m turnin’ rappers to Martyrs
Look how they’re trembelin’ begging and everythin’
Cos they do know what their level is
But…I ain't a gentleman I will dismember ‘em
Ever malevolent bredrin!
Who…said you could ever win
Must be adrenalin overcoming the evidence
You… can bet I will pepper them definite
Definete eyein the weapons intelligence
Wish I could tell you it's difficult
Clearly it's effortless
Hear me rap, I'm totally fucked
Your flow is celibate
Look how I riddle a rap
Quick as a pig will attack
One little black
When he ain't strapped
Hands is cuffed behind his back
Fact that I riddle a rap
That is so lyrical that
Pitiful chaps
Could not react
Cos my defense is to attack
I… triple your spittin
Like Britain when building
The empire that they acquired with killing
You’re simple like bloodin’ and cripin’ in Britain
Are we that unoriginal can’t even find our own reasons for killing?
And that’s what you’re callin’ a villain?
When you know the criminal’s chillin'
Buyin’ a government stackin’ a billion
Look…Tottenham to Clapham? I slap ‘em for slackin’
Attack ‘em with (patented passions for rappin?)
So all of the chattin you’re yappin’…back it!
Or, I will go back to the habit of
Taking nations daily
Enslaving babies, like NATO paid me
MC even dream that he slay me
I’ll show you where his grave be
You can't phase me no conscious like occupation Israeli
Your occupation is lazy
You look great pushin’ up dasies
See my strength is too great
You can't fade me even if they try for a couple of centuries
Like they did to Haiti
For breaking the back of slavery
I'm taking it back to basics
A beat that’s bangin’ and bars
That are harder than the heart of Satan
Their lookin’ at Harlem shakin’ after me givin them half a pacing
I dare you to laugh the other half will break a part of the matrix
There’s too much danger
We ain't friends Pesci and casino end a man's life with a pen

[Deadly]
I’ma come through looking all, whammy in that shirt
Now I’m attractive just like a gally in a skirt
I'm from a place where niggas bury hammers in the dirt
So many niggas are nuts that insanity's just a word
When feds try to block me on that move
When I come to lick them jewels
Scratch that, slam it in reverse
I can tell you what happened
Car done ripped the bird
I can let it all out
I ain't canning these worms
My whole circle’s full of real niggas
Man I did the dirt
Man have yet to man up
Some man have did worse
Man licked man down
Man have jacked man's worth
Man have yapped man's line
And took over man's turf
When them blue lights flash
Man dem rally in them curbs
We link the girl make her put the whammy in her purse
Niggas getting this twisted
Talkin’ like, me and them are friends
Just because they mentioned ? in the verse
I was stackin that away
For a rainy day, I caught that bird and I knew from…
Listen...

Hear me out....
I said you catch me on that same vibe
Round about the same time
Don’t smoke bud but I’m with my homies that stay high
Soaking up the fumes from when I was around yay high
Leaving ? twisted I don’t say bye
Niggas gassed cos there be 2 chicks in the same night
My homies be
2 sticks in the same five minutes
Empty 2 clips in the same ride
We might pringle your wig because we aim high

[Blizzard]
Causing damage, call me Brad the Impaler
Hate and I’ll give you air like an asthma inhaler
Every line brings you one step back to your maker
I'm the kind of guy to buy land, and gamble an acre
Hey yo, hows that for a sound wager
I'm Jay Z on the dub I'm a pound caker
Bryan E no Phillip Glass, a soundscaper
I’ll be about later if you want a bout later
I’ve got expensive drive like Addison lee
In Manchester I can travel in a taxi for free
Step out the car they don’t ask for the fee
I say safe and then I bounce so you could never try chatting to me
Because, everybody with sense knows I’m a raw spitter
Disagree then you suck dick like Rawzilla
I’m a lion, you ain't got a roar in ya
Me steppin’ in your booth, that’s an automatic four figures
Favouring green tea over liquor
Your family’s playing my EP over dinner
I roll studio and record a motion picture
My content's catered like I already know the listener
People have said I've sold out
And it's all chat
Because I'm off key but never fall flat
Your favourite nightclub’s a venue that I've toured at
Promoters stay by my feet like a door mat
College girls in the states tellin me where the dorms at
Skype accounts so busy I'm signing out, store that
Because I’m in the morning, I forgot ya
I’m out and about adding heavyweights to my roster
You think your record deal’s gonna help you prosper
This shit goes to pop the second they forgot ya
You sold your soul for a figure that was pricey
But I’ll never let a clause and a record deal define me
