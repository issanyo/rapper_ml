[Verse 1: Akala]
Gordon Bennett!
I'm flabbergasted
Smart Bastard
Why don’t he play his role and just act retarded
'cause when you’re born single parent poor thats your place
Don’t read too many books, sag your jeans screw your face
Chat shit
Act thick
Practice
Your backflips
Put your motherfucking arse out for the cameras
Providing entertainment for your cultural betters
Men of letters think we can only be good if they let us, 'cause
Knowledge ain't for punks, they market it like it is
Cos who the fuck wants to be Carlton from fresh prince
But geeks designed the system devisions of politicians
Marthis, and the smiths were livin' in their vison
So, knowledge is power
For devouring cowards that shower'd you
With propaganda each and every hour that’s why
Malcolm never died as, just another tug on the road
A symbol over the globe
'cause did you know?

[Hook: Akala]
The most rebellious thing you can do is get educated
Forget what they told you in school, get educated
I ain't sayin' play by the rules, get educated
Get educated
Get educated
Get educated
Break the chains of their enslavement, get educated
Even if you're on the pavement, get educated
What a weapon that your brain is, get educated
Get educated
Get educated

[Verse 2: Akala]
We speak of power
When we speak of education
Free your body, free your mind
What you think Toussaint did?
Planned rebellion, that’s the way to use your brain kid
That’s the only way we're gonna make it outta this matrix but
Gotta know the basics
We can look around say that we hate it but
But how do we change it
Or rearrange it, all to replace it
Gotta step into the mind that designed ya
What do you reckon when you step into the fire
What are you reppin' is it definitely bias
Severing your effort in the ways they require?
Act like you're lesser than better
Severing endeavors is clever
I know a bag of youths that act like they ain't clever
Cause it's become fashionable to say we all clap a tool
Never symbols of the state, only those that look like you
So whose job are we doin', pursuin' our ruin
The riddle ain't very hard, brother you fill the clue in
So when we clappin' our tools and play the fool
We ain't breakin' the rules, it ain't very cool, you know what to do

[Hook]
Forget what they told you in school, get educated
I ain't sayin' play by the rules, get educated
Get educated
Get educated
Get educated
Break the chains of their enslavement, get educated
Even if you're on the pavement, get educated
What a weapon that your brain is, get educated
Get educated
Get educated

[Verse 3: Akala]
So you want to hide something from Blacks
Then you should put it in a book
Still some brothers won't even look, it's like they shook
Its not just us, dumber you act the more they promote it
'cause dumb people will not rebel, sure you know this
Yo, look at the dreams that they feed to our babies, your seeds
Look at the means that they tell us you make all the P's
Dumb celebrities say girls act like you're me
If you suck dick and film it, get a show on TV
Because we don't want too many women thinkin' like bell hooks
We want a bag of hookers that bend over and just cook
Our silicone addressers do anything to impress us
Of course a woman's life is lived just for the fellas
Much as the next man, I love a woman that's shaped up
But there's nothing more unattractive than a woman that play dumb
But the ego with a reason to see you
Lesser than equal to be you
But wanna keep you
At all the bullshit that we do deceitful
And we're evil
I wouldn't want to be you
Putting up with our bullshit, and I mean me too
The anger burns inside of me, violently, it's dividing me
One moment I'm cool, the next I think that you're tryin' me
'cause of course I believe in peace, theoretically, generally
But if you love something then you got to defend it, see
Not tellin' you be a coward, no coward could be a friend to me
You should know your enemy, cut the head of a centipede
But know the one whose head needs to get severed
For the one who just lives it cos they just don't really know no better
The yout across the block ain't your enemy brother
And if you really knew the truth you'd be defending each other

[Hook]
Forget what they told you in school, get educated
I ain't sayin' play by the rules, get educated
Get educated
Get educated
Get educated
Break the chains of their enslavement, get educated
Even if you're on the pavement, get educated
What a weapon that your brain is, get educated
Get educated
Get educated
