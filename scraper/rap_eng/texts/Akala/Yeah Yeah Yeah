[Verse 1]
There's a lot of talk, who flow the meanest
Work it out; it don't take a genius
I spit my thesis talkin' ceases
Rappers act sick and I got the treatment
Expose actors, similar to a cinema
Similar to a Dillinger
Your wack tracks ain't got skills
Add to that the fact that you're not real
Talk bout gats, say make caps peel
But they fake raps - you get slapped in ya grill
Stop lyin' to buyers, I'm tight as pliers with the science, hahuh
The roughest rhymin', tough as diamonds, fuckin' blindin'
You must be high as kites
Figure you can fuck with the nicest
I'm off the scale, like Hampstead house prices
So hot, the sun seem cold
So hot, the flow boil liquid nitro
What ya hearin', the best thing since bread slice
Nigga with charisma, that would turn a dike
That's why I've had more blows than opponents
Hoes don't know how I flow
I blow out opponents and mics
I'm oh-so nice
It's Not A Rumour, it's the truth blood so

[Hook]
If he's talkin' like he's hard
Don't believe him, pull his card
Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah...
If you've really had enough
That's OK, call his bluff
Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah...
And if your boss is talking shit
And you really wanna quit
Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah...
Anybody, anywhere
Chattin' rubbish in ya ear
Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah... '

[Verse 2]
They say I think I'm the best, I'm far too arrogant
I ain't the best; I'm beyond comparison
Think ya good, but you're not
Couldn't get close to me inside a phone box
Why spit? You're a dipshit without diction
Plus your whips and your clips is fiction
That much of a killer?
Why you lyin'? I think you're Porky-Pieing
If ya had dough, you should own shit, not sign it
I think you're Porky-Pieing
Tryna' be G when you're soft as PeeWee
That greezy talk see through to Stevie
I mean it, believe me, to me it's easy
You find it hard, I can hear from your CD
I'm the best, can't put it more simple
Plus pretty thug, women love the dimples
I been had gyal, like Saddam or Bin Laden
I'm kinda like a pimp, but no mink dragging
I'm a nigga's nightmare- like ya ting jamming
A skinny little nigga with the heart of a dragon
Unstoppable, Mission Impossible
Logical, I'm the one- ask the Oracle
Legend like Christ and the 12 Apostles
Got more lines than Whitney's nostrils

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If you a baller cool, rap about
But there's no Puffs in england
So shut ya mouth
It amazes me, these rappers are so dumb
Get they advance and think they Trump
See I spit like guns, tongues speed of a chopper
I don't really care, you're a shotter
Youth, dem a blow ya brain out
Cause ya got ya chain out
So what real good is a name now?
Watch no face, trust me father
Young never dumb; that's not Akala
The Don Dadda, dun flow badda
Walk tall as a ladder, and I talk with swagger
Everything I do, poetry in motion
Deep, like a puddle to me is the ocean
Cause convulsions, like voodoo potions
Ramp with the Sultan, I find that insulting
That's a Nova racing a Ferrari
You're little clique takin' on the army
Be a legend when I die, like I was Bob Marley
Marcus Garvey or Muhammad Ali
Cause I'm droppin' knowledge, like Oxford scholars
Not bad, considering I didn't finish college
I'm here now, your noise is void
All you so called 'Hot Boys' paranoid
No paragraphs parallel, this is Paradise
I'm a paragon, leave you parasites paralysed
My parables parachute here to Paraguay
It's paramount you don't fuck with I
The flow kicker, go-getter
Show ripper, pro-spitter, natural-born winner
Sicker than liquor in livers
Slicker than Jack-the-Ripper
Killer spitting riddims big as a gorilla nigga
These bitter niggas bicker
But I'm bigger than that
I'm tryna' fold figures, big as Jigga and that...
I'm focused maaan...

[Hook]
