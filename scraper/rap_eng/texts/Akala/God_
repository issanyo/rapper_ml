As I lay on my back and look at the stars
With dreams of floating and going to Mars
I can't help but feeling a little helpless
And that makes me feel selfish
How can I among all this wonder
Still be concerned with my own blunders
How am I among all this greatness
Preoccupied with what my fate is?

God, can you tell me?
Is that my nature
Is that how you made me?
Or is it what I learned since I was a baby
Am I really gonna burn if I don't obey thee?

God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
How are you?
A star you?
What are you?
Who are you?

I must be sky high
Thinking we can vibe right
Look you in your eye sight
Blinded by divine light
I'd love to know now if I have a role in your grand design
God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
Or am I just someone like you floating in your space and time

God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
How are you?

As I lay on my back and look at the stars
I try to imagine just how far
Five of ten million light-years are
And I can't do it, so I feel stupid
Also a feeling I can't describe
And I won't try
Words are not qualified

God, can you tell me
Do you stand with us?
Did you abandon us?
And leave us to revel in our own disgust?
Was intelligence given to olden us?

If our galaxy is just a piece of dust in the universe crust
We're just a grain, we think we're the desert
Can you tell me, are we special?
Or just a practice run
Actors for your fun
Will the show finish
So we can start living?

God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
How are you?
A star you?
What are you?
Who are you?

I must be sky high
Thinking we can vibe right
Look you in your eye sight
Blinded by divine light
I'd love to know now if I have a role in your grand design
God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
Or am I just someone like you floating in your space and time

God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
How are you?

God, are you a man?
Does that mean...
And if you're a woman
Would you then...
Are we made in your image
Or have we made you in our likeness?
Or are you just like us
Happy then sad
Do you get mad when you see people acting bad?
Or are you too busy making up new galaxies
To notice human tragedies
God, can you tell me
Do the animals talk among their selves about us
And imagine how great things would be without us?
And what's up with this chap Satan?

God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
How are you?
A star you?
What are you?
Who are you?

I must be sky high
Thinking we can vibe right
Look you in your eye sight
Blinded by divine light
I'd love to know now if I have a role in your grand design
God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
Or am I just someone like you floating in your space and time

God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
How are you?

I'd love to know now if I have a role in your grand design
God, who are you?

God, who are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
How are you?
A star you?
What are you?
Who are you?

God, where are you?
Who are you?
What are you?
A star you?
How are you?
What are you?
Where are you?
God?
