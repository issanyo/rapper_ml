Thick skin covers my brain, I don't hear what you say
Thick skin covers my veins, so I don't feel no pain
Thick skin covers my frame and I will tell you plain
Thick skin covers my
Thick skin covers my veins so I don't feel no pain
Thick skin covers my

Fair is foul
Foul is fair
We go there
We know where
We don't care
Say your prayers
Cos I live for the stairs
And just have a seat and a chair
I will do anything for your approval
Sever my aura, it's not useful
Cut my third eye out, stamp on it
Insert the plug, quick put a clamp on it
Before the blood has a chance to get damp on it
I don't wanna feel numb, I wanna feel nothing
Sit down on my face, it's nothing
Give me an imagine I can be cussing
Two minutes to hate on something
I need someone to blame for my life
Fact that I hate my job and my wife
Them bloody foreigners
They're the reason I don't read and eat too many pies
That I believe in too many lies
I've been deceived that I need to despise
Really, I ain't got a clue what's going on
The world moves and I'm barely holding on
And that scares me
But I am the patriot so I just can't admit it
Fear is weak, I am strong
Look at the strength that I exhibit

Thick skin covers my
Thick skin covers my brain, I don't hear what you say
Thick skin covers my veins, so I don't feel no pain
Thick skin covers my frame and I will tell you plain
Thick skin covers my
Thick skin covers my veins, so I don't feel no pain
Thick skin covers my

Fair is foul
Foul is fair
Just listen, a man on a mission
Don't talk
If you're not my religion or don't look like me I don't wanna hear it
You weren't born on the same patch of land
You are not as much of a man
You've got a heart but it ain't the same
Mine's more pure you should be ashamed
I am a patriot, can't you see
I am a patriot, can't you see

Take ideas  that I have been fed and let them decide just who I should be
So no I'm not proud just to be living
Only proud of the box that I fit in
And I'm taking it on the form of pride
Cos I'm proud of my disguise
But if you look in my eyes
You would see that I die inside

Thick skin covers my
Thick skin covers my brain, I don't hear what you say
Thick skin covers my veins, so I don't feel no pain
Thick skin covers my frame and I will tell you plain
Thick skin covers my
Thick skin covers my veins, so I don't feel no pain
Thick skin covers my

Yesterday we were friends with them
Today we'll go to war
And everybody will pretend to forget that we were ever even friends before
By taking their land we're giving them a hand
DoubleThink DoubleThink - Yes we can!
Fear and ignorance make love
And they give birth to patriotism
If I'm in charge, I will get large
The more I can harbour their divisions
No I'm not saying that we should be proud
But we are what we did and what our cultures were
Does that mean I've got to be mean and attempt to differentiate words from words
Pyramid, Sistine Chapel the Great Wall, something can be learnt from all
But if I stay bigoted, in my own little world my knowledge is inhibited
And knowledge is moisture for thick skin
Softens the shield that we exist in
