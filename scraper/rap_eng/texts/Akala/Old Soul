"Feels like that I've been here before"

[Verse 1: Akala]
I don't wanna romanticize another time that's gone by
But I have to be honest and tell you that
I'm an old soul, so some Nina Simone
Is gonna put me in the zone better than some talk of Patron
Or Crystal or Pistols it's oh so tedious
I want to hear some tunes like Strange Fruit with meaning in
I want to hear the wolf howling and the waters muddy
I want it to dance, want it to make me cry but also funny
I'm feeling that inner city blues, Marvin's the town crier
Some Soul II Soul, some Aswad with Dub Fire
Some Gregory Isaacs, a little touch of Dennis Brown
I love the soul but nothing moves me like that Reggae sound
Jamaican blood, sound system upbringing
Our black American cousins are big influences on the songs we are singing
It's all Soul with Africa at it's base
So Fela and Masakela, Makeba play from the same place

[Hook: Asheber]
I remember, I remember
Do you remember?
I remember
I remember, I remember
Cause I'm just an old soul
I'm just an old soul
I'm just an old soul
Do you remember?

[Verse 2: Akala]
I'm quite sure the right chords are a cure for disease
If music is the food of love, let us feast
An open appetizer, whose songs cannot retire
The legend Stevie Wonder comes bursting out through the wire
The main course, of course, is Hendrix and Marley
James Brown will get down and start the after-party
After dark is only Pendergrass
Grab a partner and do the slow-grind wallpaper dance
There is something about the old sound on the analogue
And real musicianship that we just can't carry on
Or maybe I just am an old soul romanticizing
About the good old days when Miles Davis was a commercial artist
When singers could sing soul
And had a message
And if you saw them live they sounded better than the record
But how would I know I was not even on the globe
When most of these artists rocked
Simple, I'm an old soul

[Hook: Asheber]

[Bridge: Asheber]
Old souls, old souls
Old souls, old souls
And it feels like
And it feels like
Like I've been here before

[Verse 3: Akala]
Are you like me, are you an old soul?
Do you only like music from before you were born?
When you're listening to records
Or contemplating the questions
Do you ever get the feeling that you've been here before?
Do you find yourself talking about the kids these days
Then have to remind yourself about your actual age?
If it's only Reggae or Soul since you were five years old
A little Blues, a little Jazz
You know you're an old soul

[Hook: Asheber]
