[Verse 1: Tofi]

I used to be part of your community
Immigrant or not it didn't matter, there was unity
I can't believe that things changed so fast
I wanted a better future, who knew we were going back to the past

[Chorus: E K]

Back to the past, (x2)
They don't wanna go back to the past (Way back (x2) )
That's how it starts, (x2)
They don't wanna leave us in the dark (Dark)
Back to the past, (x2)
They don't wanna go back to the past (Way back (x2) )
That's how it starts, (x2)
They don't wanna leave us in the dark (Dark)

[Verse 2: AJ]

British jobs are not just for the British
If you think like that you're just finished
Immigration helps aid Britain
Like foreign doctors working for the NHS
Stop causing distress!
Boris Johnson
This message for you (You!)
Make sure you don't ca-ca-catch a flu! (Achoo!)
Stupid arguments
About the EU
What happened, to the campaign leaves?
Where did you find it? Under the trees?
Got people hating me, cause I'm black (black)
Well guess what
I'm coming back (back (x2) )
So please don't act
Get yourself packed

[Chorus: E K]

Back to the past, (x2)
They don't wanna go back to the past (Way back (x2) )
That's how it starts, (x2)
They don't wanna leave us in the dark (Dark)
Back to the past, (x2)
They don't wanna go back to the past (Way back (x2) )
That's how it starts, (x2)
They don't wanna leave us in the dark (Dark)

[Verse 3: Substance]

(Nah) Back to phase one
Love for the Blacks, all the Asians (Yeah)
We're choosing types
But we choose to make fun
Enough was already do we need to raise one (One)
We need a solution but they haven't made one (Yeah)
We need an escape door they wanna make one (One)
Believe all the poison that you preach
Take every poor soul that you reach
All that hatred that you preach
You're lying through your teeth
I don't believe you, funny how a suit and tie can deceive (Uh-huh)
A presumed assumption of intelligence
When ultimately, my ethnicity is so irrelevant (S-so irrelevant)

[Chorus: E K]

Back to the past, (x2)
They don't wanna go back to the past (Way back (x2) )
That's how it starts, (x2)
They don't wanna leave us in the dark (Dark)
Back to the past, (x2)
They don't wanna go back to the past (Way back (x2) )
That's how it starts, (x2)
They don't wanna leave us in the dark (Dark)

[Verse 4: Sayeed]
Discovering truths about you so evil, (Disgusting)
Bengali's aren't equal
At the end of the day we are all people
The respect we get is all equal, (Man or man)
Welcome to the UK
We get the lowest, we get no pay
You think that we're silent
Stop the hate and think you're gonna get violent
Immigration is part of our civilization
Modern people lies are breaking into disintegration
Majority of people cannot understand the value of leaving the EU
I didn't want to leave the European Union
Nevertheless I didn't want to be part of the Immigrant-Free Britain
Take my word, I'm gonna fight for what's right on this Earth
Whether that means being the next president or worldwide politician
