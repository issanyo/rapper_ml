[Intro]
Any which way some of you want to come through
I’m ready for you like Sun Tzu
Ready for you like Sun Tzu
Ready for you like Sun Tzu
Any which way some of you want to come through
I’m ready for you like Sun Tzu
Ready for you like Sun Tzu
Ready for you like Sun Tzu

[Verse 1]
The art of fighting without fighting
Or fighting when you need to
It's appealing, we're peaceful but demons if we need to
Equal whatever you bring we'll meet you
This sport is a war with a discourse
Which thoroughbred horse make it through this course?
Which emcee shall I chew up for this course?
Same energy known for the sick tours
No hype man, breath control
Record a track I do the same thing live
Can't do that? Ah bless your soul
You ain’t ready for the Shaolin vibes
Wake up when it’s still dark in the sky
With the heart for the grind and an art full of rhymes
And the sharpest of lines and a spark of the mind
So bright that I’m leaving them partially blind

[Refrain]
Any which way some of you want to come through
I’m ready for you like Sun Tzu
Ready for you like Sun Tzu
Ready for you like Sun Tzu
Any which way some of you want to come through
I’m ready for you like Sun Tzu
Ready for you like Sun Tzu
Ready for you like Sun Tzu

[Hook: Asheber]
Don’t be foolish
What you want to test I for?
I’m a man on a mission
Don’t let I catch you slipping
It’s no competition
I’ve been studying the art of war

[Verse 2]
It’s the hardest of times we’re living in, isn’t it?
So why ain’t you disciplined just a little bit?
Little git, wanna throw a little hissy fit?
Here’s a question, tell me can you riddle it?
Does it take effort to make yourself really shit?
Or is that your best that you’re giving it?
Nah, it can’t be
Well, rhyming just ain’t for everyone
Now every little son of a gun seems to think
From the moment they come out their mum they are the one
Without ever having what it takes to become
Ten lifetimes ain’t enough
I was a griot, I was a Sufi
I was a Mayan priest but not in the movies
I was a druid pouring out fluid
Blessing the ancestors cos we come through them
Hundred more times I was born before
Before The Windrush came and Britain forever changed
Energy and memory it remains
In my veins and it don’t take much to reclaim
All I gotta do is say my own name
And the power of Greyskull reigns
Yes, ruthless student, nuisance mutant
Trains with the Shaolin monks, I’m reclusive
Name is a thousand thumps with a pool stick
That reigns on a silly little punk for the bullshit
Game for a round, punch and we all kick
Elbows, knees, let’s go for the full kit
Tell your G’s I’ll believe that they’re all sick
When I see degrees they achieve, we’re talking
A school called wisdom, you could go there anywhere
Yet you are never there

[Refrain]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It’s the art of a warrior, heart of a foreigner
That’s living in an all-white town from a toddler
Graft that your body does half wanna honour us
But you've gotta tell them that you’re past wanting followers
A class for the coroners, who the ras wanna collar us?
Kill rate way past choleras
Look at all the revellers, look at what a rebel does
Sekkle, metal can’t settle us
Dope, but the CIA can’t peddle us
Nope, we go for the throat what you telling us
Choke, on the little hope that you’re selling us
Joke, I take Britain like Severus
Cult, it’s the occult and its elements
They wanna reign high but we come to be levelers
We know the design and we’re done with the evidence
Go with the times get bun for the hell of it

[Refrain]

[Hook]
