[Verse 1]

I drop a sixteen? Everything dead
I’m Akala
Cos my dad’s black, I fool the whole world
Like Obama
They really think I care about life, nah you’re mad
I murk everything on the dance done you’re sad
I had, quite a good time
And spat, quite a good rhyme
Cos mine’s, quite a good mind
For time, mic would shine
Sublime, bring who you could find
Cousins don’t worry us
It’s not school, we are grown men
Well some of us
Trouble us, bless you
Sweet heart you’re special
Suck it up, don’t show pain, it’s just a flesh wound
Test whom? Don’t do it to yourself
That’s just disaster
Like an honest third world leader in private planes that are chartered
You are not a martyr if you die for no reason
Cos you look like food, and we were hunting this season
High treason to a royal emcee
Is when you mimic me
I am the metaphor and you are just a simile
