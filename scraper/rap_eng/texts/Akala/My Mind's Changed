[Chorus:]
My mind’s changed
It’s part of living this life
So wrong or right
We expand our mind
Cause my mind’s changed
I don’t know what to say
Along the way many wrongs in this place
Caused my mind’s changed
The things were better before
I ain’t sure that they matter anymore
Cause my mind’s changed
My mind’s changed [x2]

[Verse 1:]
In my mind a thousand characters battle to be heard
Each one screaming at the top of there lungs
So I can’t make out a word
And all occasion
One of the fools within my cranium
Recovers the rules, discovers the tools
For good communication
And the beatens ceases a million Jigsaw pieces
Shard of my shattered childhood fit together so easy
And violence has meaning
Poverty is honourable
That’s me projecting back
From the space I am now
When you in and you live it
It is more than just horrible
Any day you wake up your life can announce
Don’t quote me statistics
That won’t cure the feelings
When I can see the life expectancy is half of my pares
I done made it to thirty
Further than my mother
Four Corners, lions went off the rails
But never did get caught
Maybe the strength from my mind
Or powers divine
Or good old fashion love will explain it just fine
Swat team never past the stick that matter
You squashed the beef
Time the lord you promise to just cock and squeeze
I want that God
I was just acting
The pride and the confines of my mind
I was trapped in
Funny how shit work
The way how we grew up
See how the other brother face straight screw up
Now I see my brothers and I see my reflections
Don’t mean not prepared for the worst
That mean I just ain’t expecting
And the fear, and the crave and protecting
The need and direction
I no longer feel the need to mask those aggressions

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
In my mind I would die for the things I believe
One of the mind’s greatest powers is how it deceives
And you beliefs, is silent
Tell your people dialogue
Still you got to maintain conviction and never trying to stop
And I do not, know
No can I tell u surely
Surely, that pure speculation
That’s not put before me
But what the mind conceives
I strive to achieve
It’s cliche
As  the phrase say, I believe it’s true indeed
Believe is powerful
The image of christ
Got half the entire planet believing that the saviour is white
And skin bleaching and such other sickness
Must be understood within us
Mind’s more evaded by
Multi purposed layered image
Ye many different mind’s resort the same
That we share a power switch
Soon cut this cord
Disconnect from our minds
Ye I called thind mind mine
The one, know nothing is in
Can’t define it much
Cause find it doesn’t reside in my brain

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
In my mind is a nation of it’s own
That I don’t condone
Much less control
The occupy the form
But know that I’m the servant
More like an observer
Powerless to stop myself
Witnessing the murder
It’s a curve and I’m recurving it
Nothing is ever certain
Cause the story tell us freestyle
And making up the word
And as it goes along
Just to throw me off
So I don’t know the plot
Even though I am on screen
Take the credits from new open shops
And that may sound cryptic
But I ain’t got a clue
How to explain to you
The things that we go through
I know that you feel it too
You know more control than I
It’s a charge, I wish they find the cure so I wouldn’t die
Seem like we charged that we would call alone
Along, thinking with discipline is 20 years old
Ye I gone back in time for only two minutes
The chapter on my mind is why i produce
It’s an overload
It’s in the coded code
We know it’s on the only show
On the road
Been told, ever since it hit Rome
Never showing them the cause of the flow
That a force to change the course
So we reaping and sewing
See the mind is the reason why we fooled up a lot
And if you troubling someone's loved ones
Then we fiending for blood
I want to grow up
And grow down
And go back into the ground
And some of the things produced by the mind
Might just stick around

[Chorus] [x2]
