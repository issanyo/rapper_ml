[Hook]
Young money love money blood money right
Your money war money more money right
They don't even really understand what it's like
Electro living in the land of the light
Electro living
Electro living in the land of the light
Electro living
Electro living in the land of the light

[Bridge]
We're electro living in the land of the light
Everything is switched on still something don't work right
Do what ever you got to do to make it through the night
But whatever you do don't believe the hype

[Verse 1]
Lets have a little natter about a couple of matters
Pour me a cuppa' cha a little butter an crackers
The kids are unruly news does not fool me
And if TV don't play me no more, just YouTube me
Hit em with electro retro meets techno
Rap rock kid push back the threshold
So take your best shot with you best shooter
Here we are now, entertain us computer

[Hook]
[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
They can't change what it is just by putting a name on
Or make something art just by shoving a frame on
Or become less guilty by passing the blame on
Or ramp with Akala where's you brain gone
I'm the rapper that's dapper
No matter the chatter
The illest whipper snapper
From the land of sausage and batter
Where fat are getting fatter
And the man them mad as a hatter
The goffer or the gaffer
Well bruv I'm the latter

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
We're electro living in the land of the light
Election rigging in the land of the right
Do what ever you gotta' do to make it through the night
But what ever you do don't believe the hype

[Verse 3]
Things are what they seem
Despite what they tell you
Beware of the truth or it'll send you to bellevue
If you take a closer look and uncover the veil
You will see they're just salesmen with nothing to sell you
But these wags with there fags
And christian dior bags
Shag and they brag and pose for lads' mags
It is sad
We are sad for things we cannot have
But we are not sad for Baghdad

[Hook x2]
