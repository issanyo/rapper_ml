[Intro]
This yo girl Thug Misses
Just a classic on a track
Ah, ah
We bringin' it back
K-Wang 2.0
Ride

[Chorus]
I like the way, the way you weigh your body, baby
Your steppin' drives me crazy
We pop lockin' and the DJ poppin' and the club steady rockin'
Oh-oh-oh (K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang, K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang)
Oh-oh-oh (K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang, K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang)
Oh-oh-oh (K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang, K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang)
Oh-oh-oh (K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang, K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang)

[Verse 1]
K-Wang with it, it's time to hit the floor with it
Ride with it, slide with it, glide with it
K-Wang with it, get off the chain with it
It's yours, do yo own thang with it
I put yo back with it
I move yo back with it
Ride with it, I watch how she glide with it
I two-step, I watchin' do they thang with it
Zone out, I pop with it, lock with it
I wang with it, I rock with it, bounce with it
Freeze with it, I wang with it, whoop with it
Style with it, I right with it, left with it
Ride with it, I rocks out the side with it
I put yo bike with it, I move yo bike with it
I do yo thang with it, I K-Wang with it
We off the chain with it, I do yo thang with it
Ri-i-ide

[Chorus]
I like the way, the way you weigh your body, baby
Your steppin' drives me crazy
We pop lockin' and the DJ poppin' and the club steady rockin'
Oh-oh-oh (K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang, K-Wang wit' it, K-Wang)
