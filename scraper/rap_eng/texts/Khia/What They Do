[Intro: Khia & Gucci Mane]
Thug Misses in the house (Yeah!)
Gucci Mane in the house (Gucci mane flow)
This is Big Cat here (Big Cat in the building)
So watch you mouth (So watch yo mouth)
Tell me what they do (Tell me what they do)
Shawty what you do (Shawty throw it up)
Boy, you want me over there?
Tell me what they do (Tell me what they do)

[Chorus: Khia & Gucci Mane]
What they do
What they do
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolut
Then they turn to prostitutes
What they do
What they do
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolut
Then they turn to prostitutes
Tell me what they do

[Verse 1: Khia]
Thug Misses and I'm looking for a Thug Mister
Big spenda, break bread like a real mister
Drop low to your knees boy, whistle on it
Then put that wood on it, cut me like you paid for it
It's on you, let me know if you really want it
You on Goose, so I know you gon' get loose
Pop a pill, do what you been wanting to do
Than make it rain like a mothafuckin' hurricane
I hate lames if you want it, you gotta suck on it
Get it right, if you want it you gotta bid on it
Real thick and my sugar got gold on it
Spend on it, make a chick put her friend on it
Good neck, good back, oh yeah I want it
Slide on it, make a chick wanna ride on it
Hell naw, nigga I ain't scared of it
Thug Misses, Gucci Mane, and you still want it

[Chorus: Khia & Gucci Mane]
What they do
What they do
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolut
Then they turn to prostitutes
What they do
What they do
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolut
Then they turn to prostitutes
Tell me what they do

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
For about 100 dollars, she'll let you come through
200 dollars, take her clothes off too
300, she'll be all on you
44, give a blow job 'til she turn blue
500 dollars, she'll eat a girl too
Jump the whole stack, she'll do the whole crew
Hoes get loose when they drink Grey Goose
See the coup on rims with the big sun roof
You can bring your friend and your homegirl too
Damn what you heard babygirl, it ain't true
I don't like her girl, I really like you
Cause she already told me what she wan' do
Love it when you fresh and you wear purfume
Everybody stare when I walk in the room
Chain frostbit like it's New Year's Eve
But the watch on fire like the first day of June

[Chorus: Khia & Gucci Mane]
What they do
What they do
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolut
Then they turn to prostitutes
What they do
What they do
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolut
Then they turn to prostitutes
Tell me what they do

[Verse 3: Khia]
Let me show you what a real boss chick do
Make ya feel real special when I'm on you
Slide low, lay back, and enjoy the ride
Super wet, stay gushin' on the inside
Waterfall like a stream, call me Aquafina
A real bad mama jama love it when ya beat it
Stay fresh, stay tight, poppin' all night
I got that comeback, strokin' on it just right
Prize winner, play hard if ya want to
Act like you don't want it when you know ya do
It's real simple, use your lips then use your chin
To the pole back, baby sip another meal
Fruity Pebbles, lips tastin' like fruit loops
Lovin' what you do when you gone on the Goose
You lovin' what I'm doin when I'm gone on the Goose
You get it crackin' loose, kissin' on it, suck it too

[Chorus: Khia & Gucci Mane]
What they do
What they do
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolut
Then they turn to prostitutes
What they do
What they do
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolut
Then they turn to prostitutes
Tell me what they do
