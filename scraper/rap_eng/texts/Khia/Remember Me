[Verse Two]
Remember me standin out
When there was only little loot
Little cash in the pot
But I was shinin on y'all ass
Now I'm shinin some more
While yall was worried bout a bitch
I was writing my words
Thought it was all about a nigga
I was praisin the Lord
And thanking him for all the blessings
All the things that he taught me
Dealing with the problems and the worries in life
And the joys remember me
I done shined on you twice
Remember me
The one you thought wasn't gon be shit
But a little whore
With your man be creepin
That's what you thought
But I wasn't peep this
Now I'm a star on the TV blingin
House paid for and my car exceedin
A hundred g's or more
And the kids is eatin
Shrimps from store not wanting needin
Shit from a bitch or a whore
Believe
