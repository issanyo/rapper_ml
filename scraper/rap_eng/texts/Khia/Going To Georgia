[Chorus (x2)]
Now if you ask me where I'm goin'
I'm goin' to Georgia
Ask them niggas where they goin'
They say they goin' to Georgia
So where you think I'm goin'?
I'm goin' to Georgia
They goin' to Georgia

[Verse 1]
Now well I'm goin' to Georgia
Where they steady keep it live, keep it crunk
Off the chain, and they always be ballin', ridin' on them things
22s and they keep the bass that be bumpin' in the trunk
Why I'm goin', cause they be knowin' just what a misses want
They got it, club poppin', it's poppin', it's all good
Everybody is stylin', they profilin', and they reppin' in they hood
Collar poppin' and shoppin', with Gucci fifths, Fendi bags
Why I'm goin', you know Atlanta, Georgia, where it's at

[Chorus 2]
I'm goin' to Georgia
Ask them niggas where they goin'
They say they goin' to Georgia
So where you think I'm goin'?

Ask them niggas where they goin'

Where they steady be keepin' a motherfucker crunk
Off the chain, and they always be ballin', ridin' on them things

All my girls and thug misses that keep it real, where you at?

To thug misses, I'm blazin' Atlanta, Georgia kinda weed
That got me goin' and goin', I'm yellin' "damn is that dro?"
To my niggas, I'm stayin' Atlanta, Georgia, now home
