[Verse 1]
Ill tell you what is happening (with your love)
I want your love and imma get it
See there is no denying it (its for sure)
Cause you deserve it, all of it

[Hook]
Only thing i wanna do
Is just make sweet love to you
Cause your body keeps me hot
Give you everything i got
Youre exactly what i want
And im everything you need
Only thing i think about
Is the nights them lights go out (oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Cause youre worth it (cause youre worth it)
And you deserve it (and you deserve it)
Im glad that i can be, the lover that you need
Give you everything you want, cause your love

My love is real, i know you feel it (cause i know)
This i can bet
Im glad to be the queen, to give you what you need
Fulfilling all youre fantasies, i hear youre body calling me (Khia)

My love wills you to come to me (hurry up)
Dont make me wait

Spiritually my souls on fire
And my body works your heart
Cause youre worth it

And my love will remain true

Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]

[Chorus again] (3x until fades out)
