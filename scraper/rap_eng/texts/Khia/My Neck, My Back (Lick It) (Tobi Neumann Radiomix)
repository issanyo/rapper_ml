[Verse 1]
First you gotta put your neck into it
Don't stop, just do it, do it
Then you roll your tongue from the back up to the front
Then ya get it up, keep me up on ya
Make sure I keep my eyes on ya
All over the club and stuff
Real clear, show me so much love
Knows how to stay down on ya
The best love comes so slow and long
The best love comes so slow and long
The best love comes so slow and long
All night til the crack of dawn
Real good, keep it coming strong
Through the night makin' so much love
Dead sleep when the sun comes up

[Verse 2]
You might roll dubs, you might have G's
But so what playa, get on your knees
A girl like me moans and screams
"Thug Misses" know what I mean
At the club, so fresh, so clean
A girl's hatin' fella's watching me
Standin' out in the light so clean
With a unit on my face, so mean
I gotta pick which fella I need
To take me out, spend his money on me
You try me, I'll make you see
No other girls got nothin' on me

[Hook]
So lick it now, lick it good
Lick this ahh just like you should (come on)
Right now, lick it good
Lick this ahh just like you should

Then ya get it up, keep me up on ya
Make sure I keep my eyes on ya
My neck, my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck, my back, lick my ahh just like that
