[Intro]
Is you live, whores?
Whores, is you live?
What's up, Team Khia?
Khia Mafia, real niggas, real bitches
Hater walkers, K-Wangers
Pussy poppers, ass twerkers
Whatever bitches like me, get like me
Don't trust no nigga
Don't trust no Christian bad boy
Is you live whores?
Whores, is you live?

[Pre-Chorus]
Next caller, bitch
Stop callin', bitch
'cause you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', bitch (about nothin')
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', bitch (about nothin')

Next caller, bitch
Stop callin', bitch
'cause you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', bitch (about nothin')
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', bitch (about nothin')
Next caller

[Chorus]
There's a hater on the line
Let me block this bitch one more time (next caller)
You made another page, bitch, that's fine
'cause I'm a-block your ass one more time

[Post-Chorus]
Next caller, bitch
Stop calling, bitch
'cause you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' bitch (about nothin')
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin, bitch (about nothin')
Next caller

[Verse 1]
I see you sittin' here waitin' in line
What's on your mind?
I'm so irrelevant, talk to me
Bitch, I got the time
Talkin' a lot about nothin'
Beat it, bitch, I'm on my grind
Hoe, the last thing I need is a bitch wastin' my time
Zero fucks given, fuck your opinion, I got mine
MotorMouf Thug Misses the truth bitch, where the lie?
I'm on my motherfuckin', she can't be stopped I'm on the clock
Ain't gotta worry 'bout you callin' again
Your number blocked
Next caller

[Chorus]
There's a hater on the line
Let me block this bitch one more time (next caller)
You made another page, bitch, that's fine
'cause I'm a-block your ass one more time

[Post-Chorus]
Next caller, bitch
Stop calling, bitch
'cause you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' bitch (about nothin')
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin, bitch (about nothin')
Next caller

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you callin', talkin' your shit
Like I'm gon' really sit here and listen to you
You bitch, you bitch, you bitch
Get a word in, you wish
All that hatin' that you do
Bitch, you really just need to quit
'cause you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
You lurkin', stalkin' ass bitch
All that flexin' for the gram
Stop it, hoe, you need a-quit
All that typin' that you doin'
Like I'm gon' really sit and read it
You usin' up all my data
And fuckin' up all my minutes
Some fuck nigga that never hit it
A bitch nigga I never see
So really there is no reason
For you to be callin' me
Swipe left at the first sign hate
You get deleted
Bitch, you blocked
??? was your friend in the beginnin'
Ain't no stoppin' MotorMouf
You best believe it, bitch, I'm winnin'
Zero followings, bitch
I don't follow hoes, I lead 'em
While you broke ass bitches
Be there hatin' on the queen
All your long-ass messages
I'm sittin' too high to see 'em
Next caller

[Chorus]
There's a hater on the line
Let me block this bitch one more time (next caller)
You made another page, bitch, that's fine
'cause I'm a-block your ass one more time

[Post-Chorus]
Next caller, bitch
Stop calling, bitch
'cause you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' bitch (about nothin')
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin, bitch (about nothin')
Next caller

[Outro]
Next caller, bitch
Stop calling, bitch
'cause you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' bitch (about nothin')
Next caller
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin, bitch (about nothin')
Next caller
