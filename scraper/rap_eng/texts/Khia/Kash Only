[Intro]
Now, when he comes, open up, let him freak you
Now, now, when he comes, open up, let him freak you

[Chorus]
He said he wanna come and see me 'cause he lonely
I said, "Come on, baby, cash only"
He said he get some money for me, come quickly
And when you finish make sure you fuckin' tip me

No credit card, cash only
Don’t take no credit, nigga, spend your cash on me
He said he get some money for me, come quickly
And when you finish make sure you fuckin' tip me

[Post-Chorus]
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
Where’s the good dick? I need some good dick
Where’s the good dick? I need some good dick

Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
If you want you gotta spend it, baby

[Verse 1]
He said he wanna suck this pussy 'cause he lonely
You know you fuckin' with it, spend your cash on me
I love my nigga, fat dick, long money
And he love to make it thunderstorm on me
I put this pussy on that nigga like a onesie
If that’s your man, bitch, why he runnin' towards me?
He say he single, he want me to be his lady
I told that nigga if he do, he got to pay me

Make this pussy hurt, make it squirt on the dick
Get your money’s worth
Get what you deserve, make it spit, make that pussy twerk
You say you got the bands
Spend a hundred grand on it
You the motherfuckin' man, pick and choosin' what you want
He got the stash, blowin' major cash
Ain’t worried 'bout the cost
Gettin' money every day like a motherfuckin' boss
Fuck a broke nigga talking bout ain’t no money now
Money talk, get to walking nigga
What you sayin' now?

[Chorus]
He said he wanna come and see me 'cause he lonely
I said, "Come on, baby, cash only"
He said he get some money for me, come quickly
And when you finish make sure you fuckin' tip me

No credit card, cash only
Don’t take no credit, nigga, spend your cash on me
He said he get some money for me, come quickly
And when you finish make sure you fuckin' tip me

[Post-Chorus]
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
Where’s the good dick? I need some good dick
Where’s the good dick? I need some good dick

Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
If you want you gotta spend it, baby

[Verse 2]
I don’t give a fuck about nothin' but the money
You say you wanna see me then I know you got it for me
If you don’t then beat it, I done skeeted on your lips
Dig down a little deeper in your pockets, leave a tip
If you want this ass, it’s the cash, you gotta spend it
Mr. Big Time, money ain’t a thing so come and get it
You say you got the bad duffle bags and you tip it
You say you got the money for me then I’m coming quickly
Cash for this ass, nigga, put the cash up
Bust a nut, bust a check
Count the cash, what the fuck?
I don’t want nothin' but the money, stacks only
No credit cards, digital currency, cash only
Fuck a Cash App, PayPal, never that
Send a Uber to the bank, send that cash back
You in my DMs talkin' 'bout you wanna lick it
I’m in your pocket deep spending, baby
Do it baby, spend it

[Chorus]
He said he wanna come and see me 'cause he lonely
I said, "Come on, baby, cash only"
He said he get some money for me, come quickly
And when you finish make sure you fuckin' tip me

No credit card, cash only
Don’t take no credit, nigga, spend your cash on me
He said he get some money for me, come quickly
And when you finish make sure you fuckin' tip me

[Post-Chorus]
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
Where’s the good dick? I need some good dick
Where’s the good dick? I need some good dick

Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
Cash, cash, cash, cash for this ass
If you want you gotta spend it, baby
If you want you gotta spend it, baby

[Outro]
From the back to the side just right in
Tighten up, grip it down shits wild then
From the back to the side just right in
Tighten up, grip it down shits wild then

Do all the things, freaky things his bitch can't do
You even got his bitch wanna freak you
Do all the things, freaky things his bitch can't do
You even got his bitch wanna freak you

Now, when he comes, open up, let him freak you
You even got his bitch wanna freak you
Now, when he comes, open up, let him freak you
