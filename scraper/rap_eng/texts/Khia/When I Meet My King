When I meet my king
It will be a beautiful thing
Like walking through the gates of heaven
Seeing my mother again
Like cooking naked in my heels
Smoking, fucking again
We take a walk through the parks
Rapping, doing our thing
I'm loving him, he's loving me
Together, chilling and things
He saying, "Fuck them other hoes"
My diamond gleaming and blinging
We going out looking good
Together, running the club
And leave together, hit the leather
Sucking, fucking, and stuff
He making sure we living straight
I'm having children no games
We taking trips and vacations
Like the Bradys and things
He rubbing me, massaging me
With lotion, twitching my thing
Until it's wet, I got his back on me
I'm sure you can bet, oh, me, oh
Nothing he's never leaving me
No matter the fame
That we go through it's me and you forever
You'll be my man
When I meet my king
It will be a beautiful thing
Touch it so will be my ho, forever
His is the same

When I meet my king
His hair will blow in the wind
Showing me his pride, his strength
The tone of his skin
To be so pure, so deep
The lion within
There to protect me
If, whenever, I'm scared
Telling me to smile, don't cry
To hold up my head
Keep everything tight
Make sure the children stay fed
Can't hold shit down if
I'm gonna have a bitch in my bed
Hand femur, always dreamer
Kill a nigga by head
Shoulders tight, be the line
Don't put up with him, take shit
Know how to treat me like a queen
Take me out, buy me things
My baby high in the Benz
Spendin money on me
And unfound, gives a damn bout the shit in the street
Most spared, color gata
How me off to the hater
Pro-player, shot caller, magnificent baller
When I meet my king
It will be a beautiful thing
Touch it so will be my ho, forever
His is the same
