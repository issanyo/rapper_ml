[Verse 1]
Come on baby let me see what you about
Let me show you what I got let me make you smile
Put a arch in my back push my pussy in and out
Give it to you how you like baby thats what I'm about
Let my juices just flow off your lips
Girl plays on the dick pussy in a knot rollin with my hips
Pop a pill drink a little liquior thats when im the best
And I know you're lovin me cause I'm better than the rest
I'm take my time making sure that I please you
Both titties in your mouth baby let me breast feed you
Tell me how you like it I'll do anything to please you
Even though it's wrong I can't help it cause I need you
Cause you make me smile and I don't ever want to leave you
How can something so bad keep me running back to see you
You fucking me tonight so let's go cause you're goin home with me tonight

[Bridge]
So come on baby let me see what you about

Taste my candy rain candy cane
Drip drop good to the last drop baby talk to me

Then you roll your tongue
From the crack back to the front
First you gotta put your neck into it
And don't stop, just do it, do it
Then you roll your tongue
From the crack back to the front
