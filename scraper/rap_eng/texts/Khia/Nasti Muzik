She's a nasty girl, and she loves to sang
She's got a real deep voice, if you know what I mean
She's got some big ole lips, and some wide hips
She's got a real big moan that'll turn ya on

She's a sexy nasti girl, and she really loves to sing;
She's been singing all her life, and she know how to sing it right
If you want a nasty girl, I bet her love is guaranteed...
Ooh-ooh-ooh... wee-ee-ee...
