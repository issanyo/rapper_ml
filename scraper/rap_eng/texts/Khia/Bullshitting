[Verse 1]
Who they hittin' on like they motherfuckin' money long
But most these niggas broke as hell and they ain't got none
Ol' broke ass niggas wearin' fake ass chains
Run a real motherfucka ain't boutta goddamn thang
You's a crap fo' a nigga, pull yo pants up
You not hustlin' motherfucka, get yo weight up
You sellin' dick like a hoe, you's a bitch now
Ya hoe takin' care o' ya, you the shit now
That ego gon' get you niggas fucked up
You free doe so why you actin' like you locked up?
You pretty tough when you jumpin' on a weak bitch
Dem crackers comin' then you turn into a weak bitch

I'm guaranteed to put this motherfuckin' steel on ye
I gotta tell these hood rats how the game go
You take care nigga 'fore you do yo kids, hoe

Oh what forgot yo gangbangin', you's a man now
A bullshit motherfucka, pull yo pants down
And get fucked 'cause you got the game fucked up
And you's a hoe nigga, and you broke nigga
Tryna act like you a killer when you're really scared
You only act hard when you're with ya bodyguard
Time's up for all the motherfuckin' bullshit
If you a real nigga, pay yo bill nigga
Ol' snitchin' motherfuckas workin' with the law
A-you's a house nigga, I'm a field nigga
I'm in the jungle everyday, where you at nigga?
A paddywhack ass suckle, where yo stack figure?
Always big boy talkin', put yo bread up
A crown by the lil' money, bitch I'm sicker
