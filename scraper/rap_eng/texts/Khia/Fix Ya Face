[Verse 1]
Be-befo' I get another mug shot, hoe
Tap out, bitch, fo' I put you in a Sleeper, hoe
Bad bad quit, thug misses 'bout to beat a hoe
Keep fuckin' round and your family won't see you, hoe
Better fix yo face fo' I practice my new [?] move
Better watch yo mouth 'cause the queen got somethin' to prove
What the hell, can you smell?
What the raw cookin'?
Wanna stand alone but I'm alone fo' a fuckery
All black, black ass nigga ridin' it fo' me
Trap on my hip and I'm bustin' soon as I see ya
Fuck western on, I'm about to wax off all you hoe
But undertake a bitch, transformin' on all you hoe
Pretty tough, hot, have you bitches can't see me, no
Hated by many, but the queen confronted by none
It ain't my fault Dr. Drew fucked up yo face
90210 ain't fo' us, pick up yo face

[Chorus]
Fix yo face fo' I catch a case
Fi-fi-fix yo face fo' I catch...
Fix fix fix yo face fo' I catch...
Fi-fi-fix fix yo face fo' I catch...

[Verse 2]
C-cause yo mouth twisted like Biggies' eyes, so I guess fo' sure we better call you Big Poppa now
Bitch, you're time's up, go and cry on that nigga's grave
Still insecure, still tryna get it, his light has fade
Bitch, you washed-up, pick your motherfuckin' face up
Stop whinin' hoe, fix yo face so we can recognize you
Bitch, where you at, come and see me 'cause I owe you, hoe
Plastics and addition and you barbies you can get it too
Call me [?] your woman, yeah I said it, bitch fuck you
Nappy headed queen from the south, hoe fuck you
Bustin' out my bra like the [?], bitch I'm bad now
Been a bad girl, so you hoes better stand down
Ask me, warrior queen, yeah you bitches know you heard o' me
Back from the dead, so it's off with your fuckin' head
Fix yo face, take yo place - hoe, behind me
Bitch bow down, show respect to the fuckin' queen

[Chorus]
Fix yo face fo' I catch a case
Fi-fi-fix yo face fo' I catch...
Fix fix fix yo face fo' I catch...
Fi-fi-fix fix yo face fo' I catch...

Somebody 'bout to get they motherfuckin' wig snatched
Snatch the motherfuckin' wig back
They better pack it up before they have to mack it up
Your whole fuckin' team needs to be hanged, starting with that drag queen you turned into, dumb bitch
Don't cry, I'll hold your hand through the corrective surgery
It's gon' be a few, but I got you, no worries, I got you
We gon' get through this together
Did all the men in yo life tell you you's ugly?
And you believed 'em, huh? Bum bitch
Yo face twisted like you done had a stroke

(Bitch, fix yo lips I've been told you)
(Bitch, fix yo lips I've been told you)
