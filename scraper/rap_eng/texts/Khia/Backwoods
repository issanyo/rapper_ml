[Hook]
I'm out here smoking on the woods
Way in the back
Drop a whole gram in it and I think I need a drank
You see me ride through the hood
Sunroof gone
Kickin' in the scene
Where the gangsters lean, oh-oh

I'm smoking on the woods
Way in the back
Got me high, lookin' good and I think I need a drank
You see me ride through the hood
Sunroof gone
Kickin' in the scene
Where the gangsters lean, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I'm out here smoking on the wood
Way in the back
Got me high feeling good and I think I need a drank
Titties sittin' up pretty, and my ass sittin' fat
Tryin' to pull up on my nigga cause I know that's where he at
In the hood, where it's good
Rooftop gone
Kickin' in the scene
Where the gangsters lean
My cup on full
My pockets on (?)
Smoke out your (?)
Boy, I'm out of control, oh-oh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I slide through the hood
Way in the back
Looking fly, feeling good
About to pour another drank
Smoking on my backwood
Chilling with my black wood
Cause he break my back good
And he make me act good
Crumbling herb all day, and day
Andre, press play, what you say?
808 blasting, through the hood I'm passing
Nigga, why you asking?
Hit the wood and pass it, oh-oh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Head chopped off, rooftop gone
Wood grain boss
Bitch, you know me costs
Checking out the boys with they toys
Rim shiny, candy paint blinding
Smoking on hypnotic
Hoes clocking, cause they man watching
Tell me when you see
A bitches best me
D still got me going
Calling one hit wonder
Blow smoke in your face
Me and Mary Jane

[Hook]
