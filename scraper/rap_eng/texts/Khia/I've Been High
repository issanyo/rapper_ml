I get high
Just smoke all day
Higher than a motherfucker
Smoke my problems away
I don't give a fuck
I just stay and get high
I smoke a whole half an ounce
Have me feelin' just fine
I got bills, and they ain't goin' no where
But when I'm higher than a bitch, shit, I really don't care
I just chill, smoke, and roll through the hood
Fresh and clean, smokin' green with the niggas and thugs
I've been high

You get high, ain't nothin wrong with that boo
If they knew like we knew, they'd be gettin high too
Go to the club, just don't give a fuck
Smokin' weed with the niggas and thugs
They rollin up, with they weed, my weed, they weed, it's weed, much weed
We gettin high and watchin time fly
When we higher than a bitch, problems off my mind
I've been high

You fuckin' up, and got you mad as fuck
Lookin for that nigga tryin' to find his truck
Stop to the store, and cop a box of blunts
And get higher than a bitch then ya pull your stunts
They hit the road, you know where he's at
A matter fact you better put your cat on your lap
She's goin down, oh yes it's time to clown
While your higher than a bitch catch 'em have that sound
I've been high
