Paroles de la chanson Don't Trust No Niggas (feat. DSD) :
You put your trust in a nigga, stupid hoe

How you figure he won't fuck your best friend and your sister

Ah, lie to you, ah, then screw you

Get mad if his homeboys do you

If he's a nigga don't let him fool you

They all dogs, that's what they do, uh

Tell you to put a stop to the shit they pull and

Get your own shit, that's what you do and

Don't worry 'bout him or his jewels, man

You make him sweat dubs on your shit as

You ride by music high as hell too

He watching you lusting with his bitch

You smile at him, nod at him, keep riding

You see him later 'cuz he wanna stop by

When he sees you off the chain looking good too

You even got his bitch wanna freak you

Don't trust no nigga, no, no

You can't trust no nigga, no, no

Don't trust no nigga, no, no

You can't trust no nigga, no, no

Motherfucker get gone

Don't trust no nigga, no, no

You can't trust no nigga, no, no

Don't trust no nigga, no, no

You can't trust no nigga, no, no

Motherfucker get gone

Now when he comes, open up, let him freak you

Do all the thangs, freaky thangs his bitch can't do

From the back to the side just riding

Tighten up, grip it down, shit's wild then

Get him up, put him out, nigga get gone

She's the one cussing, blowing up your cell phone

All over you, yea, you had to learn the hard way

I gives a fuck about what you might say

'Cuz you'll see I'm a queen in the end though

You see where you're gonna be in the end, broke

Knowing nothing with nothing stuck in the hood

While I'm straight lookin' lovely, living real good

So trust a nigga, fuck a nigga, get your own shit

To let him know that he's fucking with a raw bitch

With her head own her shoulder knows how it goes

And when it's time to let a motherfucker get gone

Don't trust no nigga, no, no

You can't trust no nigga, no, no

Don't trust no nigga, no, no

You can't trust no nigga, no, no

Motherfucker get gone

Don't trust no nigga, no, no

You can't trust no nigga, no, no

Don't trust no nigga, no, no

You can't trust no nigga, no, no

Motherfucker get gone
