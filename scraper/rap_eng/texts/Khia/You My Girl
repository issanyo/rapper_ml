The mistakes that I made in my life me strong
Made me right never wrong keeps me writing my songs
Cause I know you my girl cause of you here comes me
Out your wound duplicate just like you makes me sick
Just in time you my girl you my angel my world
Shining down at my life got my back don't think twice
When in need of your help if I'm wrong got your belt
But only you Uesirah had respect for your job
And your heart and your soul and your house and your goal
To your friends and your kins even sick didn't quit
What's the thanks that you get for the time that you spent
Raising kids paying bills talking shit paying rent
But I'm gon shine for you girl make you smile at me girl
Smile so bright like the sun for your girls and your son
You my moms I love you I thank you for having me
Even gone you live on live through me make em see

[Hook Vanc]
You're my girl
When no one was there for me
You're my girl
When nobody cared for me
You're my girl
And no one can take that away from me
You're my girl
And even though you're gone
You're my girl
Through me you still live on
You're my girl
You taught me how to be strong
You're my girl

Calling up on the phone just to talk hear my voice
Talk so much just like me I talk you all night have no choice
Telling jokes bout the kids how they bad things we did
When I was young having fun me and yall pulling stun
Nigawauna having fights cuss us out hit the lights
Had it all thanks to you extra strong thanks to you
Take it all thanks to you standing tall thanks to you
Glad I was picked for you you my girl and its true
I was mad when you left didn't get a chance to see you go
Now you back platinum strong live through me make em know
I'm your girl baby girl and you did this for me
You my girl favorite girl live through me make em see

(Chorus)

Oh don't you know I miss you
I need you here with me
To walk with me
And to talk to me
Oh yea
All right

Now these words are for you let you know I love you
With all my heart and my soul through these words
Let you know lets them know you my girl
No matter what I'm your child and through me they can see
You live on through my smile through my kids your grandkids
Through my will and you hopes if I go out bless them off
Live through me make em see you my girl
(don't you know) You my girl

(Chorus till fade)
