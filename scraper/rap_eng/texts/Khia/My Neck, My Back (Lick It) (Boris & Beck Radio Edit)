[Intro]
All you ladies pop that thing like this
Shake your body: don't stop, don't quit
All you ladies pop that thing like this
Shake your body: don't stop, don't quit
His is the house remix
Boris & beck
Do it, do it, do it now...

[Hook]
My neck (uhh), my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck (uhh), my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck (uhh), my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck (uhh), my back, lick my ahh just like that

[Verse 1]
First you gotta put your neck into it
Don't stop, just do it, do it
Then you roll your tongue from the back up to the front
Then ya get it up, keep me up on ya
Make sure I keep my eyes on ya
All over the club and stuff
Real clear, show me so much love
The best love comes so slow and long
Knows how to stay down on ya
All night til the crack of dawn
Real good, keep it coming strong
Through the night makin' so much love
Dead sleep when the sun comes up

[Hook]
So lick it now, lick it good
Lick this ahh just like you should
My neck, my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck, my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck, my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck, my back, lick my ahh just like that

[Bridge 1]
All you ladies pop that thing like this
Shake your body: don't stop, don't quit
All you ladies pop that thing like this

[Verse 1]
First you gotta put your neck into it
Don't stop, just do it, do it
Then you roll your tongue from the back up to the front
Then ya get it up, keep me up on ya
Make sure I keep my eyes on ya
All over the club and stuff
Real clear, show me so much love
The best love comes so slow and long
Knows how to stay down on ya
All night til the crack of dawn
Real good, keep it coming strong
Through the night makin' so much love
Dead sleep when the sun comes up

[Hook]
So lick it now, lick it good
Lick this ahh just like you should
My neck (uhh), my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck (uhh), my back, lick my ahh just like that

Then ya get it up, keep me up on ya
Make sure I keep my eyes on ya
My neck, my back, lick my ahh just like that
My neck, my back, lick my ahh just like that
