Sit yo ass down, bitch (Thug Misses)
Sit yo ass down, hoe (music speaks fo' itself)
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
(Ya) a boss bitch, I'm the queen with the fuckin' crown
And when I step up in the club
Sit yo ass down
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
Sit yo ass down, b-b-bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
A boss bitch, I'm the queen with the fuckin' crown
And when I step up in the club
Sit yo ass down

[Verse 1]
Sit Ubu, sit - g-g-g-good dog
Hoes bow down, when I come around
Time's up for misses in the fuckin' buildin'
You hoes ain't got a chance, when I step in the buildin'
So sit yo ass down, side line hoe
Niggas fuck you, get amnesia, he don't know you hoes
I pop my pussy through the club
Hoes [?], for real bitch salute the queen they thought the dues is up
Hoe, sit yo ass down
'Cause you super B
Hood, ratchet, either you's a super freak
Don't make me do you hoe, in the conversation
Don't make me violate, bitch
I'm on probation

[Hook]
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe

Sit yo ass down, b-b-bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
A boss bitch, I'm the queen with the fuckin' crown
And when I step up in the club
Sit yo ass down

[Verse 2]
In order to be the best, you got to beat the best
And ain't no bitch defeat me yet, you hoes a hot mess
Bitch sit yo ass down, tired ass trick
Put that pussy up, bitch 'cause he don't want that shit
You hoes are super loose, time to retire, hoe
You fucked out, washed-up, too much mileage hoe
Fucked all the old niggas, now you fuckin' jizz
Filthy, funky, monkey pussy bitch
You don't want it with me
I'm like a drug dealer
You hoes some fuckin' thieves
Don't make me call my goons out, like it's Halloween
A real nigga wouldn't want you on yo' bare pussy
A-kiss my ring, I'm the queen
You hoes ain't fuckin' with me (no)

[Hook]
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
A boss bitch, I'm the queen with the fuckin' crown
And when I step up in the club
Sit yo ass down
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
Sit yo ass down, b-b-bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
A boss bitch, I'm the queen with the fuckin' crown
And when I step up in the club
Sit yo ass down

[Verse 3]
Sit yo ass down before you get slapped down, knocked down, dragged down
I'm the boss bitch, so why do you streak
You better simmer down befo' you get yo wig split
I-I-I took yo' ass out, one call will make you disappear
You hoes are sour puss, ain't nothing 'bout you real
So sit yo ass down befo' you get fucked up
Slutnuts, if I get crunked you hoes can chalk it up
I know you used to niggas, b-b-bustin' in yo' face
But when I flush it in yo' face you'll feel it right away
You ragged ass hoes kills me with that attitude
You bitches diarrhea, super maneuver

[Hook]
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
A boss bitch, I'm the queen with the fuckin' crown
And when I step up in the club
Sit yo ass down
Sit yo ass down, bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
Sit yo ass down, b-b-bitch
Sit yo ass down, hoe
A boss bitch, I'm the queen with the fuckin' crown
And when I step up in the club
Sit yo ass down

[Outro]
Bitch, sit yo ass down
B-b-bitch, sit yo ass down
Bitch, sit yo ass down
Bitch, sit yo ass down

B-b-bitch, sit yo ass down
Bitch, sit yo ass down
