[Verse 1]
I'm a badass bitch
And let you know I ain't with that bullshit
You get me wrong I'm a-go off in this bitch
His shit, your shit, oh, shit
'Cause all I'm trying to do is keep it real
And let you broads fully know how I feel
I'm not asking, I'm demanding for respect
And if not it's your chin I'm gon' check
Bitch, respect me when I come through
I'm looking good times ten with my crew
I brush you off 'cause you flaw, who you?
Tryna see, trust to speak, girl, you weak
Do your thing, it's your thing, don't be scared
The men I got, the men you don't, I'm not to blame
The style I got, the style you don't, I'm onto you
'Cause you's a hoe, a jealous hoe, you know it, too

[Chorus]
Now, you hoes don't be about shit
You fuck ass hoes always worry about a bitch
You type of hoes ain't gon never have shit
Ol' weak ass hoes always worry about a bitch

(Them jealous girls)

Jealous girls and you know it too
You arguing with your man fighting about me boo
If he ain't home you call him up swearin he's wit me
And yes he is he's in jacuzzis in the baddest suites
You breaking bread giving head and you hating me
I'm looking good representing while you hating me
Hate your man he the dog and he dogging you
I'm getting mine looking fine on your mind you fool
Get it right don't be jealous hating plotting on me
Its your man you need to dip if you ain't wanting to be
With his games and his lies got you jealous of me
Got you up riding by late night to see
His car parked outside done blowed ya high
Got you fucking up his shit got you wanting to fight
Pimp when I turn em loose you grow jealous of me
Wondering what it is I'm doing why he wantin' to leave
