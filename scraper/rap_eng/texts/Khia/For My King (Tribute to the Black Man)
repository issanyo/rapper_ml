I danced with my dark
The smell of wise follows his steps
Vision forever, striving for perfection
Over-standing what is to be understood
Universally, righteously
Our hearts united eternally
Protection of my feel
Backbone, dark tone, in my zone
To journey on
Kiss of utilizations
Creating strong generations
Chemistry flowing out of you as a gift
Of always, arising
To whatever you desire
To the destitute rooted in my soul
Unfolded onto me as one
I feel the chemistry
And it's healing me softly
Floating prosperly into your words
Your breath will bring the light
I love his meditation
Projecting what is pure
And my natural cures of strongs go on
Others smell the dark drone behind me
Expression of heat
And I needed to digest
Massaging free his mind
Divine singing give me more
My dark love
Diamonds covered all over
No fake chemicals
Patience as the dive of a unity
To a prospering fertile to saint through
"I love you my king!"
