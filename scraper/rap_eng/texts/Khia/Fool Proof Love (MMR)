(Intro)
You've got a spell over me
You can't tell me that you don't want this
I gotta make you believe
That my love is pure and holy

(Chorus)
But if I told you I love you
Would you hear me when I say
Would you think that I'm crazy
Or love me anyway
They say love without patience
Is foolish anyway
Fool proof love for you baby
Please hear me when I say

Believe me when I say
Please hear me when I say
They say love without patience
Is foolish anyway
Fool proof love for you baby

I'm a victim of your love
Call me crazy it's alright with me
I'm foolish that im sure of
When it comes to your love baby

If I told you I love you
Would you hear me when I say
Would you think that I'm crazy
Or love me anyway
They say love without patience
Is foolish anyway
Fool proof love for you baby
Please hear me when I say

I'm guilty when I say
I'm guilty when I say
They say love without patience (patience)
Foolish love for you baby (baby)

I'm a victim of your love
Call me crazy it's alright with me
I'm foolish that I'm sure of
When it comes to your love baby

If I told you I love you
Would you hear me when I say
Would you think that I'm crazy
Or love me anyway
They say love without patience
Is foolish anyway
Fool proof love for you baby
Please hear me when I say

I'm guilty when I say
I'm guilty when I say
They say love without patience (patience)
Foolish love for you baby (baby)

You cast a spell over me (I'm guilty when I say)
I'm captivated by your love baby (I'm guilty when I say)
I'm foolish that I'm sure of (I'm guilty when I say)
When it comes to your love baby (I'm guilty when I say)
I'm a victim of your love (I'm guilty when I say)
Loves a foolish game, you know I love to play (I'm guilty when I say)
Who's gonna keep the score, come on and give me some more (I'm guilty when I say)
Foolish on fire, filled with desire (I'm guilty when I say)
Your love has got me on my knees (I'm guilty when I say)
