[Chorus]
Santa, baby, please hurry, hurry, hurry
(Jolly 'Ol Saint)
Santa, baby, he takes care of my worries
(Jolly 'Ol)
Santa, baby, please hurry down my chimney, tonight
(Jolly 'Ol Saint, Jolly 'Ol Saint)
Santa, baby, please hurry, hurry, hurry
(Jolly 'Ol Saint)

[Verse 1]
Nick made me wait all year for the dick
12 months of Christmas screamin' ho, ho, ho
Slide down my chimney, suckin' on my mistletoe
Fresh chocolate chip cookies, sittin', waitin' by the stove
Hot, warm buttermilk slip-slidin' down your throat
I can hear the sleigh bells pullin' up to my door
I been a good girl all year, so my gifts are on the floor
Keep my sugar to myself, it's for nobody but my Santa baby

[Chorus]
Santa, baby, please hurry, hurry, hurry
(Jolly 'Ol Saint)
Santa, baby, he takes care of my worries
(Jolly 'Ol)
Santa, baby, please hurry down my chimney, tonight
(Jolly 'Ol Saint, Jolly 'Ol Saint)
Santa, baby, he hurries down my chimney at night
(Jolly 'Ol Saint, Jolly 'Ol Saint)

[Verse 2]
All I want for Christmas is my Santa baby
To shower me with gifts and maybe make 'em bigger
Most wonderful time of the year, that's for sure
Here comes Santa Claus' Little Drummer Boy
Silver bells ringing Silent Night, let it snow
Givin' love on Christmas Day, it's a happy holiday
Wish it was Christmas every day, I believe in Santa Claus
Mistletoe and holly, absolutely egg nog
It's a Winter Wonderland , butt naked with bells on
The man with all the toys, spreading joy to my world
His corncob haunts Jack Frost, drives him crazy
Anything and everything for my Santa baby

[Chorus]
Santa, baby, please hurry, hurry, hurry
(Jolly 'Ol Saint)
Santa, baby, he takes care of my worries
(Jolly 'Ol)
Santa, baby, please hurry down my chimney, tonight
(Jolly 'Ol Saint, Jolly 'Ol Saint)
Santa, baby, he hurries down my chimney at night
(Jolly 'Ol Saint)

[Bridge}
Deck on my walls with sloppy toffee
Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya, ya, ya
'Tis the season to be naughty
Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya, ya, ya
Deck on my walls with sloppy toffee
Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya, ya, ya
'Tis the season to be naughty
Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

[Chorus]
Santa, baby, please hurry, hurry, hurry
(Jolly 'Ol Saint)
Santa, baby, he takes care of my worries
(Jolly 'Ol)
Santa, baby, please hurry down my chimney, tonight
(Jolly 'Ol Saint, Jolly 'Ol Saint)
Santa, baby, he hurries down my chimney at night
(Jolly 'Ol Saint, Jolly 'Ol Saint)
