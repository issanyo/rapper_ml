[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been called a bitch but never called a hoe
I gets plenty money and I'm always smokin' dro
I love everybody but the hates, they love to hate
Point them hatin' hoes out
I bust 'em bitches in they face
Khia's always thuggin' fresh
Ridin' only in the best shit
Spinnin' on dubs
Niggas never stop sweatin' me
Motherfucker, ask the bitch you fuckin' about
Me see if she keeps it real
'Cause real bitches keep it trill
Real niggas know how I feel
Tired of fake niggas and bitches
I'm the real thugmisses
And I'm gonna get it how I live
Hood rich, bitch
So fuck what you heard
I'm shootin' bitches the bird
And I ain't with it, you heard
I'm gettin' tired, disturbed, fed up, and disgusted
If you say one more thing
In your face I'm a-bust it
So let it go boy
'Cause you don't want none of me
'Cause I'm a-tell you about your ass
Baby, that's what you need
I know you wanna suck this pussy
So get down on your knees
Just to lick my shit fo' sho'
You know it's gonna be a breeze
So, what it gonna be, you and me?
I'm the shit that's fo' sho'
Yeah, I've been called a bitch
But never called a hoe

[Chorus]
I've been called a bitch but never called a hoe
I gets plenty money and I'm always smokin' dro
I'm down with everybody but the hates, they love to hate
So if you ain't talkin' cash, get the fuck out my face

I've been called a bitch but never called a hoe
I gets plenty money and I'm always smokin' dro
I love everybody but the hates they love to hate
So if you ain't talkin' cash, get the fuck out my face

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I've been called a bitch but never called a hoe
I've been know to say, "Fuck a nigga, fuck a pussy hoe"
My face good in any hood, any city that I go
Nothing but love, my nigga
If you want me, come get me
I be 'round
Real killas, real niggas ride with me
Anything you wanna do
My niggas stay down with me
Thugmisses, queen, bitch
All my soldiers die with me
Cry with me, smoke with me
Roll nothin' but dro with me
Ask me what I said
I tell you how it goes
Hide money in the floors
Ridin' big on 24's
Pussy poppin' in the club
Real niggas know how it goes
Yeah, I've been called a bitch but never called a hoe

[Chorus]
I've been called a bitch but never called a hoe

Large house, big faces
