[Intro: Blitz the Entertainer]
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Thugs and thug misses
It's your boy Blitz the Entertainer
The wait is over
I introduce you, the one and only, queen of the south, miss Khia
The boss lady
The thug misses with sweet kisses
Grindin' all day on a mission
Shawty listen, if you ain't on your grind and you ain't gettin' yo money right doe
You need to think about this shit nigga
