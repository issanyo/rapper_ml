Lyrics to You Know What It Is [feat. KD Aubert]

Fought it like a killer bee
Watch me how I kill this shit
Can tell with what I'm working with
... is my nourishment
You know what it is
Money my curse
... embarrass me
Like they wanna honor me
They ain't got to honor me
I ain't got to honor bitch
... you know what it is
Now I'm getting all of it
You know what it is [repeats]

... the way she shakes that ass
You know what it is
It's my swag
My...
My car
The money
It's the way I'm...
Make these beautiful bitches love me
You know what it is
It's the Burberry cologne spray
... 15 miles... we ain't stopping until...

You know what it is [repeats]

It's the black Gucci belt
With the black Gucci...
You know what it is
... murder it's all I got...
MÃ©nage a trois...
You know what it is [repeats]

It's my diamonds...
I know they... on me like...
You know what it is
... I'm innocent
And my mouth still talks this shit
... you know what it is

You know what it is [repeats]
