[Prod. by Dr. Dre]

[Intro]
Yeah, you in bra
Whaddup doe?
Yeah

[Verse 1: 40 Glocc]
I was predicted a statistic that might not last
What your doctor would call, a psychopath
So proceed with caution, you might go next
Start feelin' kinda nauseous, and bust yo ass
I ain't never played the rules or been in acting class
Far as I'm concerned that Hollywood shit's for fags
Keep it real dawg, post up with the steel dawg
Kick it with real hops[?], with real balls
A lot of these cats? Yeah they talk so real
But half of these cats get cracked and squeal
I could give two fucks less if I got a deal
I still get bucks and watch Christoph Spiel[?]
Cuz I could care less whether I'm broke or not
I cop me a quarter piece and blow up the spot
Sorry dub for dub[?], and rock for rock
Work it up to a whole brick and sold the block
Ima cop that jag, and drop that rag
Walk up outta the mall, with shopping bags
I want the Lifestylez, ov da rich and the famous
Nah I ain't rich yet but that's finna be changing

[Hook: L.V.]
All I need is the Finer Thangz, all I want is the Finer Thangz
All I want, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want is the Finer Thangz, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want is the Finer Thangz, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I need is the Finer Thangz
Eggin' [?] my life

[Verse 2: 40 Glocc]
See I fall in with heat, fall in the Jeep
Hit your block, jump out, and dump up all on your street
Hit the weed, and bump in-between the sheets
Ring some pussy up and let my dick fall in the sheep
You want beef? Put your money where your heart at
Fuck that, put your mouth where my nuts at, suck that
Spit on wax, with 16 bars
Then jump on tracks, like I'm a track star
We all got straps, no need to act hard
We can get our scraps on, in my mama's back yard
I started out young, ridin' handlebars
Went from, shootin' up cars to a hood ghetto star
Bet ya never thought Glocc could make it this far
With Doc Holiday, puffin' Cuban cigars
Menage a trois, it's on the beach under the stars
Panties and bras? Got bad bitches takin' it off

[Hook: L.V.]
All I need is the Finer Thangz, all I want is the Finer Thangz
All I want, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want is the Finer Thangz, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want is the Finer Thangz, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I need is the Finer Thangz
Eggin' [?] my life

[Verse 3: 40 Glocc]
Now I done been around the world and back, and watched cats
Switch from Jerry curled backs to Wayne caps [?]
And now the new fact[?] fresh braids to the back huh?
And everybody rockin' silver like it's platinum
Stop it dawg, what the fuck wrong with y'all?
If you can't afford the real don't cop it at all
You can't ball and be broke
Spend up all your come up money
And wonder why you keep coming up short
I don't know what it is, what the fuck is this?
C'mon that shit on your wrist's faker than silicone tits
You need to quit, seek a role model to follow
One that can teach you, the means of a dollar
See you? You spend your last buck on weed
See me? I spend my last buck to eat
Might fall in the club, buy myself a drink
Hell yeah I'm fucked up, what the fuck you think?

[Hook: L.V.]
All I need is the Finer Thangz, all I want is the Finer Thangz
All I want, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want is the Finer Thangz, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want is the Finer Thangz, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I want, all I need is the Finer Thangz
All I need is the Finer Thangz
Eggin' [?] my life
