[Ray-J]
Oh, Oh, Oh
Ray-J
Oh, 40
Woo hoo
'Fingazz on the track'
You got a a G like Damn
She already know who I am
Girl you know that I can
Put you in the mood so
You move you body really slow to the beat like damn
Go up and down like damn
Then drop it to the floor like damn
Do it real slow, oh you incredible you got a G like damn

[Verse 1 - 40 Glocc]
Allow me to introduce myself
Dr. Dre life with instant wEalth
Snoop D O double G made the Connect
Being bad Let's take a spin on the ass strip
Big bad 4-0, fIrst class in a jet
Fresh off the porch of the project stePs
Went from Mobb Deep to meeting Jimmy Iovine
And model chicks, but uh, lemme keep it clean
Been around the world and some with 50 Cent
East coast Tim's, west coast accent
Zoo life, ten cars in the caravan
Even Los Angeles like, damn
When we out in Chicago, they like damn
When we dippin' in Memphis, they like damn
I ain't trippin', I'm global, they like damn
From the Vegas night life to the tourist pose got em like damn

[Ray-J]
She already know who I am
Girl you know that I can
Put you in the mood so
You move you body really slow to the beat like damn
Go up and down like damn
Then drop it to the floor like damn
Do it real slow, oh you incredible you got a G like damn

[Verse 2 - Twista]
How could I pass on her
Like Gucci I say lil mama got an ass on her (damn)
Look at the glass on her
She gettin' it so I gotta spit it fast on her (damn)
Im pickin your body I see you be doin it cuz you be lookin so wonderful
Ass fat as a motherfucker
Eyes lookin so colorful
That's the reason I noticed the way she blinked twice
After eyes saw me that made her not even think twice
Told her her legs nice
Make 'em say damn
When they see you rollin' by on that Harley chrome and pink bike
Ray-J look over there
You see how her ass sit up
Cheeks hangin out but shucks no way imma pass it up
I told her shawty stop
You got a bunch of bad bitches wit ya
You gotta give some of that to 40 Glocc
I react for your type the way I react with the mic
I ain't gonna lie when I saw what my reaction was like, damn

[Ray-J]
She already know who I am
Girl you know that I can
Put you in the mood so
You move you body really slow to the beat like damn
Go up and down like damn
Then drop it to the floor like damn
Do it real slow, oh you incredible you got a G like damn

[Verse 3 - Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti!!
I met her out west, took her down south
Found some country niggas had golds in their mouth
Big straps, big chains, know what I'm talkin' about?
Then I took her to the club, shawty walkin' it out
I'm like, damn
She got them low-cut jeans
Look like a model and walk somethin' mean
I'm a street nigga, I'll sell a bitch a dream
She's a a real bitch so I need her on my team
My team, my team, yeah I need her on my team
I think I seen shawty on the front of a magazine
Or I may be trippin' but fuck it, it's all good
Yo Gotti, 40 Glocc, you know that it's all good
J got the big head, and he ain't even famous
We asked Ray-J, could he smell danger
Danger, danger, yeah your life's in danger
Comin out with us without a muthafuckin blank
Yo Gotti

[Ray-J]
She already know who I am
Girl you know that I can
Put you in the mood so
You move you body real slow to the beat like damn
Go up and down like damn
Then drop it to the floor like damn
Do it real slow, oh you incredible you got a G like damn
Like damn
On the floor like damn
You incredible you got a G like damn
Go up and down like damn
On my dick like damn
You incredible you got a G like damn
