(Papa Reu)
Yo
When I see my boy C-Note I'ma buy him somethin' brand new
When I find Lil' O
You know he gone keep somethin' new
And of course, you know the original
Papa Reu!!!!
I'ma keep somethin' new, new, new
Look

First Verse (Papa Reu + Lil' O):

(Papa Reu)
We gone buy somethin' new, for the millenium
This triple O jag cost two million
Buy somethin' new, for the century
Double O, one drop top Bentley
And I'm gonna clown when they see me
In a jag truck with four TV's
Yachts and jets, yes we're overseas
Best to get presidential role's

(Lil' O)
Watch me get an A plus for the way that I bust
Presidental role's with biggetes and ice plus
Like plush, all of my foes they bite dust
When I bust my beretta, fat rat, with the cheddar
Drop the top on the cadillac, cool, and yell "WHOA!"
Hoes askin' who the fuck is that?
It's Lil' O
You ain't know?  These other ones shine, I glow
Blood stream for State, cristal and hydro
Man the way that I go, be havin' niggas sayin' man he left with my hoe
And made a woman swear like she was doin' Tae-Bo
And Lil' O, man he put it in they face I know
For real I know
Bitches young follow him
He bail up in the club like he's King Solomon
Young nigga thuggin' ain't no stoppin' him
Poppin' champagne, jewelry with the rocks in 'em
The O ain't trippin', come on

Chorus (Papa Reu):

We gone shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Platinum role's to tell the time, time, time, time, time, time, time
And all the diamonds gonna blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Rollin' twenties all the time, time, time, time, time, time, time

Second Verse (Papa Reu + TC + C-Note):

(Papa Reu)
The windows be tinted, and we be in it
Five hundred cruise control, lights all in it
On the coast of Puerto Rico, with some women
Where my shorties at?  Where they at?
So come here my baby
You look and now you wearin' them guccis
So take me to where them rude boys be preachin'
You know they say we rich and we bubblin', we bubblin'

(TC)
We got so much money, we can't even count
Check my credit cards, bout X amount
Bout to pull somethin', out the garage
Seventeen, playin' with bout ten cars
My nigga Rue, bout to survive bank
I'm steady clubbin', ain't even old to drink
Ballin', that's all I know
White bentley off the showroom floor

(C-Note)
We gone buy somethin' new
Two thousand dollars a shoe
Ice the benz candy blue, now I'm comin' through
My lex bubble like moets and them private jets
With ten K around my neck, Prince and cut biggetes
I'm in the game like EA Sports
No more standin' on the corner pushin' island resorts
C-Note to buy the cars, we some million dollar players
We go with Papa Reu, cuz we real rhyme sayers
Parle' ers, police give me tickets cuz we ballerific
Next time I'm poppin' big shots, cuz all my letters kick it
Now we bitch slappers cuz we fantabulous
Walk around sell out the show, cuz niggas tired of us

Chorus (2x)

(Papa Reu)
Buy somethin' new, somethin' brand new
Buy somethin' new, somethin' really, really new
Buy somethin' brand new, somethin' brand new
Buy somethin' brand new, really, really new
