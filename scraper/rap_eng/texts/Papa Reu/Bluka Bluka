Bullet holes go into yo vest
Straight through yo vest
Just like the rest you play me oh me oh me

The our ar ar artillery from world one, two, maybe three

Not them regular ones but all you need
I use them on my enemies and all the ones who are
Hatin' me look boy
Pop, look before you pull the trigger
Tell me boy, which gun bigger

The closes friend to me one day a hater
Tried to come and run up on me
I counted fast and I started to spray
I thought I got him but the motherfucker

Bullet proof yo Hummer AK user
Finger on the trigger

Fuckin' self nigga I spin the bin

Yo block we be scopin'
Fifty shots to yo dome, we leave ya open
