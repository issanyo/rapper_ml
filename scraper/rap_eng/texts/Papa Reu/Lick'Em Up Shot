[Intro: Papa Reu]
Here it is, we come to dance in the ‘94
Eightball and MJG together with the South Circle, see
We gon’ do it like this for all them boys, so check it

[Chorus: Papa Reu]
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
Lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
Lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
Lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
Lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
Lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

[Verse 1: Eightball]
Check one, on the mic, it’s the fat mack, freakin’ on this phat track
Peep my khakis saggin’ and my gat in my backpack
Gangsta Memphis, home of players and Uzi sprayers
But me, I’m just a hustler, fuckin’ poetic rhyme sayer
Iz-eight-bizall, will make a new nigga fall
Then send him to the land of the Orange Mound killer clan
Him being the enemy, meaning he’s not down with me
Meaning he didn’t come up in the muthafuckin’ Mound with me
I got a posse thick as hinds if you did not know
Some of them are jackin’ but the other half slang dope
Gangsta, straight from the bottom, got ‘em sick with this
Flavor that was made up by that nigga named T-Mix
Blast him, bucked him, let him eat the hollow tips
Snatch him like a bitch and then beat him with the pistol grip
Danger, anger, overload, explode
Go into my ‘fuck the world’ mode, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

[Chorus: Papa Reu]
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
Lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

[Verse 2: MJG]
Just give me a muthafuckin’ reason to demonstrate a pimpin’ type appeal and
I’m peelin’ caps in your muthafuckin’ nose
And I’m drillin’ holes in your coffin
Quite often, I have to show these niggas who the boss and
Keep tossin’ these hoes upside the muthafuckin’ wall
These bitches eatin’ supper out my fine silk drawers
Because I plays my card, and I likes to H-U-S-
T-L-E, MJ-fucking-G
Ain’t gonna be another busta in my future talking shi
‘Cause he don’t know who he fuckin’ with
See, it’s the P-I-M-P-I-N-G in me
It keeps me totally about the M-O M-O-N-E-
Why these niggas front with this bullshit I don’t understand
Shady ass busta, sticky ass hand
You run for cover when my muthafuckin’ bomb drop
On you and your crew, nigga, lick ‘em up shot

[Chorus: Papa Reu]
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
Southern Funkadelic terrorist got ‘em scared of this
Young nigga making a fat grip being a lyricist
Kill with the muthafuckin’ Glock if I’m forced to
Break a nigga off and leave ‘em shorter than tattoo
Peace and much love to the niggas that I’m down with
The niggas that I clown with that’s down with this South shit
Hard from the start, so many players on my family  tree
Meaning there was many doing this shit before it came to me
Hard times made a nigga write a lot of hard rhymes
Fuck walking a chalk line, mayne, I gots to get mine
Death wish, click goes the clip in my piece
One in the chamber for the jackers and the crooked police
No more peace without a piece, a nigga life will cease
For your herringbone or the phat ride you crease
If you got nuts thinkin’ that I’m droppin’, I’m not
Lick ‘em up shot, nigga, lick ‘em up shot

[Verse 4: MJG]
Here comes the muthafuckin’ nigga, with his own type of rhythm
Get ‘em, up, nigga, nigga, get ‘em
Up, if you wanna, come jack it
Step, make a move, ‘cause I’m packin’
What, ever it, takes for
Me to get a nigga up off me
MJG rollin’, down the strip dodgin’, dips drinkin’ Crown
I’ma sip one more fifth
I’ma chief six more spliffs
I’ma drop these sucka ducks
Run ‘em over like Mack trucks
Dumpin’ bustas in a lake
I gotta dispose ‘em out their way
Straight up, sucka nigga, you gets popped
Fuckin’ with this clique, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

[Chorus: Papa Reu]
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

[Interlude: Papa Reu]
We ain’t a joke
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
We stinkin’ murderers
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
We stinkin’ murderers
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
We stinkin’ murderers
They’re picking up the place like they’re a big time hustler
Their gun in their waist, a millimeter
They’re coming out again ‘cause buy can got ‘cause we…

[Chorus: Papa Reu]
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga

[Outro: Papa Reu]
Here it is, we’re coming to dance in the ‘94
8Ball & MJG together with the South Circle…
And we’re gonna lick up shots to all them boys…
