Hello
Naw I'll Be There In A Minute
But I Got Something To Do
What
You Should Know There's One Main Thing And Its

[Chorus:]
When I Hustle
Baby I Be Thinkin Of U
Always On My Grind
Spending Alot Of Time
Like We Use To Do
Now I Be Out In These Streets
Cause Baby We Gotta Eat And U Know Thats The Truth
When Im Out On My Hustle I'm Comin Home To U

[Verse 1:]
Yeah I'm A Hustler
But Baby Girl I Wanna ***** With Her

So If Any Brotha Tell U He Could Better He Lied
Look I Ain't Nelly
But I Could Make U Hollae.I
When We F.U.C.K.I.N.G In The Tree Top

[Hook:]

But U Should Know There One Main Thing And Thats

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Baby Girl U Be My Queen
The Only Thing Make A Thug Smile In His Dreams
Or Make Me Feel I Ain't As Thug As I Seem
When We Make Love U Get Weak In The Knees
The Only Female Who Do What She Pleased
But Say She Ain't Trickin When I Gettin Her Jeans
Car When Verrumum A Safe In The Streets
I Tell U Mami Dont Worry Im Safe With The Heat
Now Come A Lil Closer Move Ur Waist To The Beat
In The Window Of My Comfort For Heat When U Sleep
