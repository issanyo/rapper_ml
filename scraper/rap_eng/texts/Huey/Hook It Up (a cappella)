If she got a partner, tell her she should get with this
A well known money maker H-U-E-Y

Huey be the man to give some real love- you know that playa be i
The type that would take her out the hood
Make sure her hair and her nails look good
500 benz you can break a lil' wood
If she was my girl, ima do what I could
As long as you understand its 50-50
You do for me, I do for you
You shoot for me and I'd shoot for you
You be sweet to me and im sweet to you
You may think im lyin but it's the truth
Cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it
Its easy for me to be pimpin
But imma gonna make you my mistress
To avoid the life- lookin ruff
Head and attitude- all messed up
All ya gotta do is holler at kells
And tell him go on hook it up

If she got a friend hommie, tell your girl to hook it up

If she like real playas and don't f**k with no haters
Wanna get with a real balla that's makin that real paper
If she want a good life shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows, party mingle with the stars
Now if she understand that I am her blaming man
And when comes to sellin out shes my sold out crowd
And if shes not the type that got a lot boyfriends
Then tell your girl to holler at her future boyfriend

If she got a friend hommie, tell your girl to hook it up
