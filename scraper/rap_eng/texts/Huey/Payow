Ooh, she don't know, she don't know
She don't know, she don't know, I got that payow
Baby, ooh she don't know about me, she don't know I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that payow, I got that payow

Baby, ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
Ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
Baby, ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
I got that, I got that, I got that payow

Speakin' of payow I got somethin' you might love
And it's a murder weapon wearin' the right glove
In the stoke of this I'm hopin' it's tight as fuck
And if it hurt just let me know and I'll lightin' up

I'll light you up from just a few shots
And have you soundin' like sirens of two cops
Things you don't know about me you gon' learn right now
150 rounds that sounds like that motherfuckin' payow
You know about me

Baby, ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
Ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
Baby, ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
I got that, I got that, I got that payow

Now when I come I'mma put this burner on your tongue
Suck it the same way you was raised suckin' your thumb
Ain't gonna kill you, want you to see how the blower taste
Like that's a doctor from shocks, you done took to the lower waist

I hope this payow is enterin' Niagra
'Cause this pistol is hard as niggas on Viagra
Send me automatic click, click pow, pow, don't run now
As you hit you with this motherfuckin' payow

Baby, ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
Ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
Baby, ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
I got that, I got that, I got that payow

Yeah, ooh, that ass is so fat
I want the lights on usually the room is pitch black
Wanna see move forward, back when I give a smack
Rubbin' on my 6 pack and I ain't holdin' shit back

When you hear that click clack baby go your ass down
Til' dem lips drippin' wet, ooh slow your ass down
And I done click a hole in your wall, oops broke your couch
I'mma fuck around and have to buy a house
'Cause I done hit you with that payow

Baby, ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
Ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
Baby, ooh she don't know about me, you don't know, I got that payow
I got that, I got that, I got that payow
