It’s a pair of balls with a Baseball Bat

I met her in LA heard what I said
I was flying Blue, she flew Red
She said “you from round here”?
I said “No, I’m from Florida”
Dirty South made surrounded by three sides of water
She said that was cool, but didn’t ask all that
Said I was kind of fine but I flew the wrong flag
Baby don’t trip, you got blood on your rag
I thought the same about you, but won’t trip on that
I drive a big truck, all forty-eight states
Making legal money baby, no chance to take
We hit it off that night at the motel
I was cracking gang jokes and she tripped and fell
I held out my hand to help her up
She said appreciate it dog, but I can get up
I snicker a little damn girl was tough
What you gone do tonight? Baby what’s up?
She said she was all dyke and she do the screwing
I’ll show you how to be a dyke
So you know what you doing

She was kind of bashful, playing hard at first
In the motel room and I went to work
Told her all the men stay hard in Florida
That’s why women go to the beach
To cool Off in the water
She said you lying but I wouldn’t know that
Ain't no man that ever lived ever touched my cat
I wet my finger touched her
Neck pulled down to her chest
U put my finger in her mouth and she started to sweat
She had got hot, but I knew she been scared
Relax I’ll be gentle women call me golden rod
I turn her nipples like I change the radio station
Give it to you like you need, like I know you been waiting
I say you love cock, all this time you been faking
You started bucking acting up and legs started shaking
She started talking then she called me Mary Lou
She called big Nat and said thank you, thank you

We had-had some good sex but it was all good
She was feeling a little guilty for cheating on Mary Lou
I say, I’ll take care of that, don’t worry about that
You get Mary Lou over here and I’ll hide in the back
Mary Lou showed up, mad as hell
I told her she was ugly and sit down a spell
You can look a lot better if you fix your attitude
If you want your girl back, you best be cool
I said get naked, you know what I want
Don’t be acting so crazy like it’s the time of the month
I pulled out my shovel and I started to digging
Her girl came out the back when she heard her squealing
Came and sat on her face while I was digging her out
From the waist down, calling it the dirty south
Now they get hot when they look at my state
Florida on the map, Cali women masturbate
