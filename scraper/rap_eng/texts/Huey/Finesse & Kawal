[Hook: Huey & Apac]
I finesse kawal kawal finesse
And I finesse kawal  kawal finesse
Money stacking wall to wall as I'm running to a check
Just a youngin  tryna ball like I'm hooping through the net
I finesse kawal kawal finesse
And I finesse kawal kawal finesse
Money stacking wall to wall as I'm running to a check
Just a youngin tryna ball like I'm hooping through the net

[Verse 1: Huey]
I finesse kawal, kawal finesse
They ain't really balling they kawalin when they flex
Just a youngin and on the grind for the money and the respect
I ain't tryna waste my time
You can deal with me direct
You can't kawala a kawalaer
I got the product it's lava
I'm doing numbers I look like I just hit the lotto
Chasing these commas ATA the motto
Feeling like Pablo Picasso
I'm popping a bottle
I'm up at the top of the condos
Ballin' like Rondo
Rondo be shooting like Rambo my brothers ain't down for the convo
Flossing ain't with the nonsense not talking losses
I'm saucin' ain't into talkin' I do this often
Finessin' I stay finessin' I be kawalin
I'm on it on it ballin' like I'm Spalding

[Hook: Huey & Apac]
I finesse kawal kawal finesse
And I finesse kawal  kawal finesse
Money stacking wall to wall as I'm running to a check
Just a youngin tryna ball like I'm hooping through the net
I finesse kawal kawal finesse
And I finesse kawal kawal finesse
Money stacking wall to wall as I'm running to a check
Just a youngin tryna ball like I'm hooping through the net

[Verse 2: Apac]
I finesse kawal, kawal and get finessed
Why these hoes all on my line
I guess they really wanna flex
I ain't really into talking
Baby I just want the neck
She said it ain't about the money cause she know that's all I get
You know I'm comitted
All about stackin' the digits
Nigga you gotta go get it
Started from rags to riches
Whipping the pot like a chemist
Nobody cares how you feelin'
Didn't give two fucks how you feelin'
Most of these niggas is bitches
Finessin' kawalin' is my living
You know we gonna get it
Pull up in the foreign and see the roof missing
Bitches looking at the Rollie you can watch my diamonds dance
They finessin' and kawalin' while I'm counting all these bands
I do it all for my brothers wish this moment could last
All these bitches on our dick now cause they know that we got cash
And I

[Hook: Huey & Apac]
I finesse kawal kawal finesse

Just a youngintryna ball like I'm hooping through the net
I finesse kawal kawal finesse
And I finesse kawal kawal finesse
Money stacking wall to wall as I'm running to a check
Just a youngin tryna ball like I'm hooping through the net
