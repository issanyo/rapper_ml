Now when we hit this thang
You automatically look good
Off of my apperiance I automatically look good
Make my way to ya door
Open It they like a gentlemen
Take you by the arm
A kodak flashes While entering
Take you to the bar
Buy ya your favorite drink or two
And all ain't gettin it
So I can try to sleep with you
What person in their right mind wouldn't wanna be wit you
You da type i take home and show to my peoples boo
I ain't gonna lie
I hate women who sensitive
For real
Be lettin the littlest things get to them
Lil mamma listen

Most of all i gotta be able to put...
