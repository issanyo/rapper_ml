[Verse 1]
Was born in it
Crawled in it, walked in it
Was in poverty before a nigga even talked in it
Learned in it, touched the urn and got burned in it
Anything that you wanted you had to earn in it
I had been served and got served in it
Pussy better what your words in it (?)
Or get bird lifted
Yup, I saw my first body in it
That was one less body in it
I whooped a nigga named Johnny in it
Nothing personal it was probably business
Skipped class in it just to get some ass in it
Grew up fast acted an ass in it
Homey all the strong last in it so I’ll be the last in it

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
Seen my parents on drugs in it
Everybody was in the drug business
The real niggas show love in it
But some niggas I couldn’t trust in it
I bought a Glock with some .45 slugs in it
Vampire blood sucking niggas you could think Ima suck a nigga
Have him stretched out less blood up in ya(?), ugh
Went to my first club in it, yeah smoked my first bud in it
In the hood I had love in it
From the Blood to the Crip niggas
Thug niggas
What up nigga?
I seen alota shipped in and saw a lotta dope shipped out
This what my city bout

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I caught my first case in it
So I got my first glass case visit
In a state building
Started rapping and got the make the shit happen in it
Never knew i turned a captain in it
A murder capital you standing in it
And everybody got a cannon in it
Life is a box betta carry it(?)
You best believe I got my city cap(?)
And you can put the city on my back I carry that
Nigga, don’t think this shit a game either

[Hook]
