It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season

Bullets fly from Glocks from cops none stop
Eighteen-year-old graduated with diploma, got shot
Laid in the street surrounded by white chalk
When you shot illegally dead don’t talk
Every hood off the chain, poor life’s slane
I put on smile but I live with much pain
Hood living got me living in a strain
Putting work in for my piece of the game
No gun found in the hand of the dead body
Stay cool through it all, but that there got me
Thirty-eight hot, got two boys shot
Pulling my hand, I hit jack pots
Won’t leave silver dollar, cut wind when they holler
Red and white lights and the ambulance will follow
What would you do if it was your soon?
Would you park your car, imagine grabbing your gun?


It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season

I think not. It will be real hot, on my block
You how it be when the cops get shot
Some say why, run from cops
I heard cops got Glocks, that go pop
Off that, less say you stop and drop
Lay down on the ground and you wait for cops
Might get a lick or two cause he had to chase you
If I had to chase somebody, yea I’ll do it to
New time judge say it was fair to me
Jump out of jail, no job, parolee
No time to settle, got fines, and monthly fees
Nowhere to live, so I live with G’s
Ain’t many folk, finished probation
You can double check words, all across the nation
No cell, parole, now it’s time to flex
Damn, what’s going to happen next

It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season

Some cops are trigger happy, if your hair is Nappy
Want to live, but they attack me and they slap me
Killed my little shorty from Cleveland arms
Laid to rest. No more, mother’s arms
I’ll always keep it real and tell it in my songs
Best believe if they keep it up, we dropping bombs
Some don’t believe we’ll ever get together
But when bullets rip baby bodies, they gone forever
If what I say offends you and makes you mad
We got a lot in common, poor moms and dads
Be sick so long that my stomach hurt
I live my life in hell but I put God first
My ten percent of earning
I’m supposed to leave at church
I spend it at the gun store, a rifle with three round burst
If you got guns, keep buying ammunition
Protects what’s yours because poilitions don’t listen
If you don’t have a gun, I’ll advice you to get them
Keep it locked away til its time to hit them
Don’t jump the gun, be patient to the time
It Be one continued thought, then everybody’s mine
And Everybody have their own damn reason
For waring back at them, because its shooting season
Waring back at them, because its shooting season
Waring back at them, because its shooting season

It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
It’s the time of the season, that’s the only reason
It ain't no pleasing, it’s shooting season
