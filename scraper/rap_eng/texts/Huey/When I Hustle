[Intro: Huey]
Hello? No, I'll be there in the minute
Man I got something to do. What?
Look, you should know there's one main thing and that's

[Hook: Lloyd]
When I hustle, baby I be thinking of you
I'm always on the grind, dont spend a lot of time like we used to do
Now I be out in these streets cuz baby we gotta eat and you know that’s the truth
When I'm out on my hustle (hustle, hustle), I'm coming home to you
Shawty I'm coming home to you

[Huey]
Yeah, I'mma hustler, but baby girl I wanna fuck wit ya
You the type to make a thug nigga turn in love wit ya
Mami let me tell you, I ain't nothing like these other scrubs
It's H-u-e-y, cowboy, he fly
Got money to the skizzy, thats why I fly G-5
If any brother could tell you he do you better he lie
No, I ain't Nelly, but could make you holler +E.I.+
When we f-u-c-k-i-n-g in the treetop
Bet you will feel special than ever when we ride
Cop you a summer wardrobe come spring time
The more that we around gratify me to love you
But you should know there's one main thing and that's

[Hook]

[Huey]
Baby girl, you be my queen, the only thing that make a thug smile in his dream
Or make me feel that I ain't as thug as I seem
When we make love, have me weak at the knees
The only female that could do what she please
But say it ain't trickin when I'm giving her g’s
Care whether I'm hurt or safe in the streets
I’ll tell you mami don’t worry, I'm safe with the heat
Now come a lil closer, move your waist to the beat
In the winter I'm the comfort for heat when you sleep
There's no other couple that’s fucking with we
The more I'm around, gratify me to love you
There's one thing to know and that's

[Hook]

[Lloyd]
I've been all around the world before
But I know you're the one for me, you're the one baby
Just stay and you’ll see (shawty I can make you see)
I don’t want to have to run these streets no more
But for now, girl it's ride or die (it's ride or die)
Baby I'mma get you right and

[Hook]

[Outro: Huey]
See I told you everything was gonna be iight in the end
Gotta grind (we gotta eat)
That way I can take you on shopping sprees and all that good stuff
Uh, you understand what Im saying right?
Stand by yo boy side
Together, me & you can ride
It's when I hustle... let's go
