[Intro: Sample from Huey's "Pop, Lock, & Drop It (Remix)"]
Understand I'm the baddest man alive
So let's just, ring your knees and do the G-5

[Hook 2X: Huey]
(Tell me this) Who's flier than a G-5 airplane? (me)
Got bad ass bitches playing dare game
My bread's up (my bread's up), my car clean (my car clean)
My bitch tough (my bitch tough), my charms gleam (my charms gleam)

[Huey]
+All Eyes on Me+ like 2Pac
26's on the drop and 2 blocks
What am I? Everything you not
(BALLIN') Raised off them true blocks
Interior paint, rims color coordinated
Yes, yes, it's blessed as if the Lord made it
Naw nigga don't jack, that's for your safety
My gun's got heat sensors and no safety
I'm an expert in anything that I do
No cubics, all diamonds are blue
I know ya heard about me, no I'm not worried about ya
I sit back, relax, sittin on Louis couches
That's right the truth is out bitch, I knock your toothless out, bitch
You ain't ready for what I'm bringing and who I'm out with
You can flex, front hard if you want to
Meantime, Huey gon do what the fuck he want to

[Hook]

[MempHitz]
Who's flier than a G-5 airplane (me)
Got bad ass bitches playing choo-choo train
Throw a stack up on it, I'll throw a stack back
Put some gangsters on it, I'm a push some gangster back
It's time to face the facts, the rest of you niggas is lame
I'll tell ya boss the same, yeah I'm killing the game
Yeah I'm a A&R, but I got an AR
That shoot real far, go straight up through ya car
I'm flier than flavor, stay duckin' a hater
Fuck what you talkin' 'bout, my nigga we gettin' that paper
I know you heard about us, Hitz Committee, the shit
H-u-e-y, he fly, he the type of guy
That make a whole lot of money for his company
Committee, how we living, never tricking that's a felony
I stay so hi-I-I-I-I-igh
I'm so fly these niggas starting to call me G-5

[Hook]

[T-Pain] + (Tay Dizm)
Who's flier than me? (nobody), answer this (what)
If you sick with money, I must be cancerous
I know you ballin' dawg, I know you in the game
But I don't just talk about G-5s, I really got a plane
But I ain't stunnin' on you though, it's just a G-3
That's some nice car but ain't no use in trying to G me
See the difference 'tween my lifestyle and yours is
Mine is x-rated and you just barely in PG
Aye so Tay Dizm (what up), how tight is your game? (Pain)
Yea! (I can make a pay J be my main man)
Yea! (Get a flashy thing put it in the matchin' ring)
Yea! (I'm so fly they can't tell me a damn thing)
Ok tell them hoes to get in the lab (Oww)
If there ain't no more room she can sit on your lap (Oww)
Now take this and this and that and this exactly what it look like
If you get hit by a truck with a bunch of fly shit in the back

[Hook]
