[Intro: Huey & Colby O'Donis]
Woo
Colby-O
Hey (Hey)
We got a little problem with this one, ya dig
Hey ayy (Hey ayy)
Yo [?] we about to have fun on this one
Let’s go

[Verse 1: Huey]
Hello
You know, numero uno
That fellow, I'm that thorough
I see how you movin’ - shakin’ that jello
DJ drop the bass back to that treble
Every guy in here like how she move
So serious wit it, she got off her damn shoes
No clue how she move, she just groove
Right, left, up and down - I'm like ooh
If she got a man
Then and?… I don't care
Everything’s done - from nails to her hair
Usually chicks with beauty don’t phase me
But this one’s crazy
I'm all over it, baby

[Chorus: Colby O'Donis]
I... I... Makes me go crazy
Girl you’re my heart (I go crazy)
I want you for real, but baby don’t tear us apart
I... I... Makes me go crazy
Girl you’re my heart (I go crazy)
I want you for real, but baby don’t tear us apart

[Verse 2: Huey]
Now why would you wanna do that
If I was to ever leave, I'd be comin’ right back
And in fact, you love me too much
To just pack your clothes and shoes - and you up
Hey now, I'm done with playin’ now
I've done had hoes from Saint Louis to A-Town
You ready for you and me?
You ready for me and you?
You want me to cop a ring, fuck it, I'm gettin’ two
So together we will be
Forever we will be
Laid up, pillow case made from feather’s of geese
Your my M-A-I-N lady
I can't - yup - say it
You drive me crazy

[Bridge: Colby O'Donis]
It's too late for these games
It's two hearts, too much pain
I see pictures with frames
When i think of... you
The physical, psychosomatic
Drama, I know you can't stand it
My world is spinning, can't grasp it
She’s my number one mistress, listen

[Chorus: Colby O'Donis]
I... I... Makes me go crazy
Girl you’re my heart (I go crazy)
I want you for real, but baby don’t tear us apart
I... I... Makes me go crazy
Girl you’re my heart (I go crazy)
I want you for real, but baby don’t tear us apart

[Verse 3: Huey]
So how do you feel now?
You wanna throw it away?
Or you wanna live proud and smile the next day
The pictures that I see in frames of me and you
Grew back memories I see of me and you
We’re stuck together like papers and school glue
But we gotta think smart, as students in school do
Regardless who do - is not what I am
But I got a plan and as a man, I wonder

[Verse 4: Colby O'Donis]
Is she with another man
Is she with a girlfriend
Why is she ain’t answering
What is really happening
Maybe I don’t give a f---
Maybe I should find a friend
Maybe take her to the crib
Maybe show her the biz

[Bridge: Colby O'Donis]
It's too late for these games
It's two hearts, too much pain
I see pictures with frames
When i think of... you
The physical, psychosomatic
Drama, I know you can't stand it
My world is spinning, can't grasp it
She’s my number one mistress, listen

[Chorus: Colby O'Donis]
I... I... Makes me go crazy
Girl you’re my heart (I go crazy)
I want you for real, but baby don’t tear us apart
I... I... Makes me go crazy
Girl you’re my heart (I go crazy)
I want you for real, but baby don’t tear us apart

[Chorus x2]
I... I... Makes me go crazy
Girl you’re my heart (I go crazy)
I want you for real, but baby don’t tear us apart
I... I... Makes me go crazy
Girl you’re my heart (I go crazy)
I want you for real, but baby don’t tear us apart
