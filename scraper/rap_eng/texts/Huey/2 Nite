[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
You already slow
It's going down tonight, homey
H.U.E.Y
You already know what it is
Hits Committed, partner

[Verse 1]
We're goin' out tonight
I'm feelin' fly tonight
Yeah, it's goin' down tonight
It's 'bout to go down
The whip has smoked down
The fit shock the ground, let's leave
Playa, I'm ready to go
You ready to roll
Lift up our doors, yes up on sprees
I'm feelin' the groove, gimme a boost
Maybe later on tonight, we can get us a room
She can have a couple of friends that cum with her to
Let's drink, get drunk, and see what it do
Walk in, errbody you feelin' a fit
From my head to my neck, it's filled with gliss
Whatchu want from the bar, I'm gettin' it quick
What more can I say, this nigga is rich
Don't get too drunk to clown tonight
Unless that clown is gonna frown tonight
But I'm feelin' good, wanna lay some wood
Understood, it's goin' down tonight

[Hook]
Lemme make this call, 'bout to hit my dawgs
We goin' out tonight
You know how we ball, whips in tow
I'm feelin fly tonight
I'm feelin' the red bra with high heels and thong
But the brown was fine
No time to play, nothin' else to say
It's goin' down tonight

[Verse 2]
The remedy kicked in, I'm feelin' the Henn
By the way the club is jumpin', Lil mama gettin' the biz
She no what it is, she done already said
It's nothin', she twerkin' the hips, lickin' them lips
Damn, she know how to turn a nigga on
Got a pretty face and some nice waist
Damm, I can't be waitin' to get her home
Everybody in the club then shows up
Women sippin' on Mo, no hold up
Then I whisper in her ear like you know what
We can leave right now 'cause I'm tore up
You right, but baby girl, hold up
I'm 'bout to round the guys
No time to play, nothin' else to say
It's goin' down tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So now that I got her home, I'm ready to get it on
Your high heels and thong, make her drop that
I'm bout to turn on the song that raise your hormones
Now she suckin' on my neck, girl stop that
Yeah, we both grown, we the only two home
Bout to get triple X rated
Do you want it, can you take it
Your body so beautiful naked
You can get it from the back, you can get it from the front
Which way you want it baby
Lemme hit it from the side while you lookin' in my eyes
You gotta dunk it baby, we done, done what we did
So it is what it is
Let's hit the shower now
It wasn't okay, nothin' else to say
It done went down tonight

[Hook]

[Outro]
Haha, yeah
Hits Committed, too fully focused man
Bout to take this album to the top
All day, 07, that's us, make
Huey, what's up
Bout to G5 her
Side to side, side to side, side to side
Haha, Hits Committed, man
Let's ride outta here
