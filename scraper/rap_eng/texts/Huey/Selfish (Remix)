It's yo boy memph hits, and this is another hits crew production
Asia cruise

Baby girl what's happening
You say you don't like how I'm acting
Thinking I'm giving these girls action
But you don't even smell me
What can I so tell me

Let's Start By Correcting Ya Tone
Lower Ya Finger, Don't Be Comin' At Me
With Condescending Demeanor
We Both Know That Ya Dead Wrong
And What Makes It Worse You Don't Even Have The Nerve
To Ever Say That You're Sorry

You're Never Wrong And I'm Never Right And
You Win All The Rounds And Every Fight
That's Why

Can't Stay Another Day When You're Always
Getting Your Way, You Just Keep Getting Your Way
You Just Keep Getting Your Way, Ya Selfish
So I Decided Not To Get In Your Way
It's Time To Do It My Way And That Means
Getting Away From You, Ya Selfish

Listen let me break it down to you
I ain't selfish I gotta keep it real wichya I'm just helping
The first time you kissed me I was breathless
Thought about you night and day could'nthelp it

Baby I make a lot of moves
A lot of trips
Doing shows and interviews
A lot of tips
Tripping because you know I'm round a lot of chicks
And you seeing that my myspace get a lot of hits
Every now and then I'll probably blow a kiss
Spending less time ain't on my (? )
I'm hood but I don't wanna see that look on your face
So I decided not to get in your way
Now whos selfish

Can't Stay Another Day When You're Always
Getting Your Way, You Just Keep Getting Your Way
You Just Keep Getting Your Way, Ya Selfish
So I Decided Not To Get In Your Way
It's Time To Do It My Way And That Means
Getting Away From You, Ya Selfish

No, We Don't Need To Talk
Ain't Nothin' Left To Say
You Got Everythang Ya Want
Go Ahead And Grab Ya Cake
I Know What's Best For Me
We Go Our Separate Ways
Leaving You With Everything
Even All The Pain

Can't Stay Another Day When You're Always
Getting Your Way, You Just Keep Getting Your Way
You Just Keep Getting Your Way, Ya Selfish
So I Decided Not To Get In Your Way
It's Time To Do It My Way And That Means
Getting Away From You, Ya Selfish (x3)
