Ay, it's so beautiful when a plan come together yup
It's your boy Memph hits
And ya'll already know what this is
H U E Y
(Remix)
Bow Weezy
T-Pain
Hitz Committee, partna

It's H U E Y, home fly G5
And by the look in my eyes she have nice thighs
What her mama done gave her done grew from local to major
My pockets flooded with paper, born as a Missouri stater

Mami gon' take it low if you can, then touch your toes
You and your partna them, you can get dollas then
Trickin' ain't in my blood, but I’ma make it rain on 'em
I'm too rich for dolla bills, I consider that as change

25's on my range, know that that's a odd number
The way that you tootin' that thang can make the guys wonder
Of what's underneath or even if it's real
I’m hoping she a freak 'cause I ain't tryna chill

I’m tryna get it poppin, wit a shorty like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind
It's H U E Z and Bow Weezy
Let's see if she can get lower than before on the remix

Toot that thang up mami, make it roll
Once you pop pop, lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you baby girl let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me maybe we could roll, oh

Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it

Damn lil' mama I’m sayin’
All that in them jeans, woo
Aye, aye, let me holla at chu for a minute though

Hey what it is, they call me Bow Wizzle
Now pop, lock, drop it for me, make that thang jiggle, yep
She moves her hips just like Shakira
If she was in a contest she would be the winner, yep

From Ohio all the way to St. Louis
Hey all the girls do it just put your back into it
Now shake what she gave ya, I’m talking bout ya mama
If you won’t do it for me then do it for these dollas

'Cause I’ma make it rain, these other dudes is lame
They talk a good game, but they can't do the same
Now drop it up and down, now take it to the ground
If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is

Pop, lock, and drop it, but baby don't stop it
We can do it like Chris Brown, girl and get it poppin’
Man I’m a pro, look I’m far from a rookie
Girl get your pretty self over here gimme them cookies

Toot that thang up mami, make it roll
Once you pop pop, lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you baby girl let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me maybe we could roll, oh

Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it

Shawty snap, yeah!
Goddamn, shawty snap, shawtay!

Yea, now let me ask you a lil question that you never heard
How do you make them dollas disappear like I’m for real for a lack of better words
Let me introduce my friend, that's Huey and Bow Wow
I’m the pain better known as Teddy bend her ass down

I’m G, yea, but you probably already knew that
But you didn't know I could make you pop, lock, drop and do that
Now understand I’m the baddest man alive
So let's just bend your knees and do the G5

Now we fly
Yea now you can do it
Yea I know you see me
Yea you wanna be me
Yea you got my CD

Yea that's Hitz Committee
Yea that's Baby Huey
Yea that's Bow Weezy
Yea that's Teddy Pain

I’ma make you climb the pole
I’ma play you depending on how this money unfold
And I got it from my mama I ain't tryna go pro
If you pop, lock, drop it, I might let all of this go, oh

Toot that thang up mami, make it roll
Once you pop pop, lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you baby girl let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me maybe we could roll, oh
