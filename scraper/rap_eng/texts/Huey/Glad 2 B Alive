Cheaaa yeahh yeahh
I made it up out of the hood my god
Thanks to his committee jive in the building
It still makin niggas sit back and think wonder tho

Verse One
But first of all i thanks god for a better day
Getting money no drugs found a better way
No more shootin and fighting. posed in alley ways
Running from cops throwing rocks in gang ways
Remember getting monkey wrenches and turning
Hyrdens on anytime of the day killers turn into fire zones
Couldn't make it thru the hood wit out it going down
Jumpin niggas punkin niggas thrown rounds
I sit and wonder if i was still there what would i be
If i was still watchin da loot news what would i see
Another hom-sucide another robery
But Huey made It out now ain't no stopin me
I kno theres niggas hatin on me it ain't nothing new
I let my big ass rims giving something to do
Third eye watching my back cuz niggas poppin it
It feels good to be alive but still it got me..

Chorus
Sitting on my cadilac wishing everything was still good at home
Even tho i kno its not otherwise i wouldn't be gone
I can admit that im glad that i got away from the sad things
Everything that can make a nigga mad mane
I gotta say man it feel good to be alive

Verse Two
Look not only it feel good to be alive but it feel good to have
Ya homies on ya side and they ain't mad cuz they see they
Nigga on the rise and they tell me Huey do what you gotta

I gotta shine and they kno i wanna see them out of trouble
They like you out da hood but nigga look we got the bubble
Otherwise hustle to get what a nigga need and most of em
Grown and gotta take care of da seed so they out there on
They grind with coke or weed and continue to be raps c a and b
Thats why i got them cuz they always had me and if we had beef
Errybody had heat back in da days errybody had to eat if you wearin
Da ??? then errybody had to creep to be supportified im like gonna
Make your profit
It feels good to be alive but still it got me..

Chorus
Sitting on my cadilac wishing everything was still good at home
Even tho i kno its not otherwise i wouldn't be gone
I can admit that im glad that i got away from the sad things
Everything that can make a nigga mad mane
I gotta say man it feel good to be alive

Verse Three
As far as family errybody gonna thru oldest brother locked up
So is mine and ???? but we a choosen generation we gonna
Make it thru its f**ked up that my cousin had to make the
News shot five time now he in a better place and all of ya
Cousins wishing for a better day im doing good for the b rays
Wit out a problem
It feels good to be alive but still it got me..

Chorus
Sitting on my cadilac wishing everything was still good at home
Even tho i kno its not otherwise i wouldn't be gone
I can admit that im glad that i got away from the sad things
Everything that can make a nigga mad mane
I gotta say man it feel good to be alive
