[Chorus]
Yep, got a closet full of clothes
You ain't gotta stay fresh for the hoes
Yep, got a closet full of clothes
You ain't gotta stay fresh for the hoes
Yep, got a closet full of clothes
You ain't gotta stay fresh for the hoes
Yep, got a closet full of clothes
Yep, got a closet full of clothes

[Verse 1 - Huey]
Yeah, a nigga got a closet full of clothes
Ain't 21, but got a bottle full of Mo
Cool in the summer, but I'm hotter in the snow
Fresh Force 1's in my closet, they can go
Evisu jeans, I'm top of the line
Evisu Ts, a watch that can blind
Four cars, a piece up in each ear
Have two of the baddest bitches up in each ear
It's fear up in this atmosphere, of course he's near
Like my nigga Trell said, I'm fresh as John Deer
But back to the basics, Girbaud with the straps
I'm done with the Daytons, I'm gone with the flaps
So many pair of Pradas, the red and white strips
Red and white fitted with the red and white kicks
Leave out of town with a STL bitch
Just to let you know I'm on some STL shit, bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Kid Trell]
You know the kid got the Cutty on 4's
Spend a couple grand, got the charm on froze
Keep it so fresh, ridin' on low pros
Eyes stay open like I'm takin' No-Doze
Prada fit red and white trim, so throwed
Know I got the Prada loafs on, so cold
Closet lookin' like warehouse, on so swole
Half of the shit that I rock is so old
Never mind the name, you just know it cost dough
Try to touch my bread, pimpin' that's a no no
You don't wanna see the kid spit the .44
The price of the shoes, yeah I paid about 4
Niggas don't like me, I don't really care
You know I been smokin', you can smell in my hair
You know that Kid Trell keep a pocket full of dough
Choppin' on 4s with a closet full of clothes, fo sho

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Huey]
Yeah, a nigga got a mouth full of plat
A nigga got a chef with a STL cap
Fill your ass up with some STL straps
Have a body lost on the STL map
It's H.U.E
I don't know why Kenneth Cole shoes collar shirt so fly
They ain't got nothing to do with my red monkey's fresh out the zoo
Cause ewww, they so funky
Rock sweat bands, but still the hoes love me
Tell they baby daddy, give 'em money
No fuckin', fresh Akademiks, fresh matching tennis
If shit ain't name brand, it's a lack of interest
Getting escorted whenever a nigga enter
Niggas gettin' tortured if ever a nigga trippin'
Another soul lost, if ever a nigga slippin'
Gotta hit the mall, forever a nigga fitted, yeah

[Chorus:]
