[Intro: Huey]
Yeah, I made it up out the hood my God
Thanks to hits committed, jive in the building
(You know, big edge, G, I see you baby, what up miff?)
It still make a nigga sit back, think and wonder though, ya know, damn

[Huey]
But, first of all I thank God for a better day
Gettin' money, no drugs, found a better way
No more shootin' and fightin' posted in alley ways
Runnin' from cops, throwin' rocks and gang ways
Remember gettin' monkey wrenches turnin' hydrants on
Anytime of the day, killas turn into fire zones
Couldn' make it through the hood without it goin' down
Jumpin' niggas, punkin' niggas to throw around
I sit and wonder if I was still there, then what would I be
If I was watchin' the late news, then what would I see
Another homicide, another robbery
But Huey made it out now and that ain't stoppin' me
I know it's niggas hatin' on me, ain't nothin' new
I let my big ass rims give 'em somethin' to do
Third, I watchin' my back cause niggas plot
It feel good to be alive but still it got me

[Hook: T-Pain]
Sittin' on a Cadillac, wishin' everythin' was still good at home
Even though I know it's not, otherwise I wouldn't be gone
I can admit that I'm bad, I got away from the sad things
Every thing that can make a nigga mad (man man)
I gotta say, man it feels good to be alive

[Huey]
Look, not only it feel good just to be alive
But, it feel good to have your homies on your side
And they ain't mad cause they see they nigga on the rise
And they tell me, Huey do what you gotta do, I gotta shot
And they know I wanna see 'em outta trouble
They like you other hood, well nigga look we got the bubble
Otherwise hustle to get what a nigga need
And most of 'em grown, gotta take curl they seats
So they out there on the grind with coke and weed
And continue to be rappers C.A. impede
That's why I got 'em, cause they always had me
And if we had beef, everybody had heat
Back in the days everybody had to eat
If you went into kempt everybody had to creep
To be supportive, I'm like go ahead make your profit
It feel good to be alive, but still it got me

[Hook]

[Huey]
As far as family, everybody going through
Oldest brother locked up, so it's mine and Luke
But were Trojan generations we gonna make it through
It's fed up that my cousin had to make the news
Shot five times and that ain't even a better place
And all livin' cousins is wishin' for better day
I'm doing good for to be raised without a papa
It feels good to be alive, but still it got me

[Hook]
