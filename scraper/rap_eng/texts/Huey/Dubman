[Verse 1:Leanzus]

Gun man gun man gun man, shooting since the jump man
Stunt man with the gun blam this one for the slums man
My goons always acurate no slump man
Hit em with the Glock or the pump man
Find a river where i dump him
Shoot of his head now we call him stump man
Perfect aim
My boy take the blame
We run this game
No need for fame
Steal yo chain
Gak spit that flame
They know his name
I'm just riding with it
Hand on the trigger i can click it
Bring a ho home ask her where to stick it
No compassion for these actions
No caption for this captain
At the bank cashing in the whip fasting
Need some traction
Abandon yo companion imagine the satisfaction
No distractions
My goons got good reaction
Get to clapping
Got the magic pop a zanny felling fantastic
Get to acting like a faggot it end tragic
This shit a classic
Light up that shit make me feel estatic
Drunk and blown
Fuck dem ho's
Skunk and po
We getting thrown
Duck the po
Gun at ya throat
Think like 6 scientist
High as shit
Half my pay go to my mom cuz she why i exsist
Starting to get violent
Pistol leave em silent
Got a new client he reliant
I'm so defiant
My lif in dire need of guidance
Your favorite rapeprs album i inspired it
Just need some direction
Put on fo my section
Stay repping, my plug got the connection
I show no affection
Got a nun saying oh god
He so raw
He's a prophet not in it for the profit
I gots mine if i see something i cop it
My bitch a godess
Feeling so modest
We flawless and lawless
She suck till she jawless
Just honest
These other rappers in the closet
Make me vomit
Nah i don't got a problem with gays
That shit stragiht
Just don't be tryna kiss my face
I try to stray away from the hate
Your opinion on me holds no weight
Only care about the man at heavens gate
Pistol placed right on your face
This can be your fate die today
So obey
My mind is gray
Lay astray
Not kim k but i fuck with Yay
That line was pretty cliche
Smoking haze to 808's and heartbreaks
Feeling kinda lonely
I be civil till i'm with the homies
Yeah that's the kendrick lamar influence
No need for a hook we got straight bars
These other rappers got fake cars
My house has it's own gravatitional pole like it ate stars
Nah this ain't mars
My plug hit me up like wait dawg
We ain't flawed
Tell the government to equate all
And to the coppers
We hate ya'll idle eyez idolized by my idolize

[Verse 4: Jimbo Slice]

Gun blam, gun blam, gun blam
Better pray my gun jam
Sweep up all you dustheads like a fucking dustpan
Comma, comma, comma, comma, comma, comma, three dots
Karma come around whenever I’m on the block
Point them cameras, hammers, clap ya, at the time your life flash
Snitching, why’d you try that, why’d you do me like that?
Light the blunt up left hand, wave the uzi right hand whew
Rolling with my b’s, we make your blue flags white flags
White flag to a red flag, we don’t leave a witness
Booksmart boys go witless, bust his big brain; citrus
You know I’m a G
I do not try to G
I do not try to be
What I desire to be
On I-and-G
I’m on the move that’s I N G
Remixes soon with IBC
Got red eyes, visine please
To YDB I RIP
Tryna play the hero, you won’t have your moment
Gun up to their dome, now ”click clack pow, it’s game over”
