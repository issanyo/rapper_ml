Been a long day and all I wanna do is be with you
See your face and do all the things that lovers do
You really got a hold on me, I don't even care who sees it
This is how it's supposed to be, give it to me when I need it
Set a fire in my heart and the flames consume my mind
I can feel you in my thoughts, telling me all your desires
I wanna reach the highest score and really I can't wait for more
Baby all I am is yours and I'd love to see your

Eyes on me from across the room
I wanna see your every move
We don't have to fight, we can take our time
You can answer the questions on my mind

Why you lookin' at me that way
Why you gotta be so cool with it
Why you gotta be so nasty
Why you gotta be
Why you gotta be

Why you gotta make me laugh babe
Why you gotta be so cool with it
Why you gotta be so nasty
Why you gotta be
Why you gotta be

I'm not being freaky, I'm just tryin to make you feel
Alright
Alright
I just need a minute, it ain't even gotta be
All night
All night

My mind ain't gotta
I love it when we touch each other
We stay on top of the world when we under the covers
Let's paint a picture of affection you can pick the colors
No need to maintain shame lose the mask my lover my lover
I'm learning so you know that I need your wisdom
