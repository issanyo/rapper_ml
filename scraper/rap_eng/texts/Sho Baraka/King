[Hook: Lizi Bailey]
I'm a stranger, no one knows me
No one understands the troubled man that I be
How'd I get here? Please come and ﬁnd me
I wanna go somewhere that all my cares can be free

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Yeah, I had a dream all people were made equal (yea)
Hollywood and hip-hop didn't exploit evil (dang)
Ignorance wasn't synonymous with Hood (dang)
We wanted God and we didn't settle for good (dang)
In my dreams He will save you
And Lord's not a name to increase an agenda or platform (dang)
In a world where government cared more
About feedin' the poor and not fundin' the war (dang)
No matter your color we were all brothers
Some just have a different type of tan than others
Ha, in my dream hate was bowin' down to grace
Along with racism they were mentored by faith
Ha, then it grew and it became service along with racism
They were mentored by purpose
In my dream anger was quick to listen
Charity and peace were close friends with riches (yeah)
Contentment was never jealous of business
And pride was always kickin' it tight with forgiveness
Ha, in my dreams it's such a good life there
I'm startin' to think I don't belong in this nightmare (hey)

[Bridge: Lizi Bailey]
Oh, something in me knows this is not my home
This is not my home
And a stranger I will be until you come for me
Until you take me home

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
It's been so many years, count the days and hours
I feel trapped in this world wide web no browser
Search my journey a pilgrim no mayﬂower
Just April showers April fool, April fool
Flashback grab that had that where's that fast track fade black
Ha where did it go?
First home ﬁrst gone thirst on hurts strong search on what's wrong
Ha where did it go?
Thrill is gone - that's the blues under blue skies
Time flies for every mile do I earn rewards
Tell me Lord put somethin' on my commissary
Penitentiary livin' from this sentence so wanna run on run home
Tryin' to ﬁnd myself that I lost that was so long
But after all this time my mind's so gone
My past is a stranger, my presence is acquainted
I soon forget my future I ain't never met
Unknown plastic faces displaced to betrayed visions
Images of shenanigans yeah dummy like mannequins
Can I speak candidly more fake than for real
Livin' in a fantasy freeze time insanity
Born to crawl walk run walk then crawl
The fate of all to face the call of every man's fall
The pain of that can drive many to be maniacs
Or manic depressive requestin' that's how insane we act
It's hard to face the facts that soon this track will run its course
I just pray that we'll be okay with what this means for us
The end is near no need to fear when hope is clear
The time keeps moving, it's true, bring in the chorus

[Hook]

[Outro: Sho Baraka]
Man it's such a good life there
You don't like my dreams, well good luck in this nightmare
Huh, it's such a good life there
You don't like my dreams, well good luck in this nightmare
Dang it's such a good life there, such a good life there
You don't believe in dreams, well good luck in this nightmare
Yeah good luck in this nightmare
It's such a good life there
I'm a stranger
