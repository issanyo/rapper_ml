Intro:
Yo we not even in the studio right now
We in the stew
If you never touched a Super Nintendo controller
You ain't got no business listening to this song
We bout to take it back to nine seven
Not ninety-seven, nine seven
Verse 1 (Sho Baraka):
Yeah huh
A new breed of emcee who can take theology's, philosophies and mix them with the boys in San Augustine
He's God
He gave us evidence to believe
He gave us a sign but without sin He's a G
Gangster of Heaven, he does what he please
He gave up His blood plus He talks to the seas
He's shining bright, it's like the stars are His stylist
Earth under his feet just to prove He kicking science
Your Highness
He wears righteousness as His uniform
Riding a bronco, you jokers are fake like a unicorn
No room for you copy cat rappers, you outta place
I'm sold out for the Son, homie we outer space
This is high art that's painted without a trace
Your bars are weak like you benchpress without the plates
How can a God take a world through death and hate
Forgive sin and a return all for a lot of grace
Verse 2 (Dre Murray):
Now I ain't first in the science, mathematics was a giant
And in this land full of stones you a liar or a lion
When the high wears off and the King comes down you'll catch one to the crown for the lies you supplying
The hills sang Zion and I cry
You talk about how your soul is ride, three hundred kids die
Nobody blinks an eye, tragedy becomes the norm
Desensitized, we in the eye of the storm
With new concords and some skinny jeans on
Disguising death as life, everybody sing along
Claim to know the way, but the truth is unknown
A billion one-of-a-kinds in the land of the clones
I'm gone
Verse 3 (Eshon Burgundy):
Yeah
I'm alive, wire of sorts
I'm stealing all the people listening to admire my thoughts
I'll be apart of people dissing a proverbial christian
Trying hard to make the burial glisson and I just need it to shine
In my own strength trying without the Father's power
Motormouth, I can't help but talk at several miles an hour
And my flesh keep rising like I'm hopping on a skateboard trying to win the Espy gliding
Even when I think I'm fresh I'm rotten
Even at my best I'm not in the league of the most popular Dee's
No way I can compare to the only begotten C
Matter fact just let me leave
I'm bout to hop in the breeze
Verse 4 (Fro Wundas):
Yeah huh
A co-sign on these bar loans, it's past due (uh huh)
I'm past ill, I'm past sick, I'm past flu (uhhh)
I passed through my past crew was still legendary in a city that's legacy when you past truth (wonders)
Hey you, pay attention you missed the mission (yeah)
Forever christian but I don't really bang with religion (naw)
Denomination, now I don't really bang with the vision (huh)
But however you rep it respect it cause it's your decision (yes)
It's all gravy some love me the hood play me (yeah)
I'm trying to speak to the unreached with preach daily (yeah)
I know the beast is a fat woman who eats daily and she trying to swallow the beat whole, it's just crazy
Bridge:
Yo we taking it back to hoodies and skull caps in the summer
Snap backs and starter jackets, you know what I'm saying
When rappers used to rap and flow ain't had nothing to do with what you was wearing
You know what I mean
Verse 5 (S.O.):
Yuh
Man and Christ got the victory
And so I ride with the winning team despite what the vision be, a mystery
Spoken in the moment see the word that we're promoting should cause you to move call it poetry with motion watch them silence the commotion
Gah
All's Moses, all's the saint's fugitive flake with them darts throwing
Hearts droning
Earth shake from them dark Roman's
And some didn't leave with their heads that start moment ah
And even now was cities weren't easy bows
