Are you ready?
Yeah yeah
Say it Loud
Yeah yeah
Say it Loud
Yeah yeah
Say it!
Oh Lord, Oh Lord
Wake up!

Kingdom come
Your will be done
We're marching on
Marching on to freedom

Kingdom come
Your will be done
We're marching on
Marching on to freedom


This is Nubia, Axum
This is Lalibela
This is "We Shall Overcome"
Singing acapella
This is Gospel, This is justice
This is liberation
This is truth before the reconciliation

This is 2,000  years up in the making
Culture shaping, maybe more
It depends on how you trace it

This is bringing authenticity to counterfeit
(Wake up)
This is God over politics
This is dignity to all
We the Father's kids
This is biblical fidelity in scholarship
What good is my faith without compassion?
What good is my word and belief without action?
(Wake UP)
We the heirs to the civil rights
We bring that Holy Word to a dirty fight
This is a March don't let 'em get between us
Children of the dreamers, this is theological clean out

Kingdom come
Your will be done
We're marching on
Marching on to freedom

Kingdom come
Your will be done
We're marching on
Marching on to freedom

This is Carter G. with the history
Tom Skinner on the streets preaching victory
AME and Jarene Lee with the ministry
Reconciling our imagery with YAH before Genesis 3
Some say Christianity cause insanity
Like other religions didn't cause calamity
(huh)
Like your beliefs never caused anyone agony
I claim we have perfect God, not a perfect family

Their supremacy tried to kill my identity
But I know my history, I am made in God's imagery
(Wake up)
Save me your half-hearted apology
I see your theology all up in your policies

Join the March
If you're passive, then stay away
Stay awake
We gonna stay and pray, and strangle hate
It's a revival
Lovin' those who hate us
Stand on the shoulders of giants and then scream
Wake UP!

Kingdom come
Your will be done
We're marching on
Marching on to freedom

Kingdom come
Your will be done
We're marching on
Marching on to freedom

(I just wanna tell you that I thank you Lord
I know you know the things that I'm praising for
You didn't have to do it, but I thank you Lord
You didn't have to do it, but I thank you Lord

I just wanna tell you that I thank you Lord
I know you know the things that I'm praising for
You didn't have to do it, but I thank you Lord
You didn't have to do it, but I thank you Lord.)

Absolutely. But what I'm saying is look
You can't have discussions in society about race and racial equity unless we're talkin' about justice, right?
And we can't talk about justice unless we're talkin' about the dignity of all creation. And that's why we preach Jesus, because we're calling people to do the impossible. We're sayin' "Wake up, O sleeper and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." Amen?
Amen

Wake Up!
