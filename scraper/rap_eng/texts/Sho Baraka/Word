Chorus
I've been reading that Word
Living that Word
Digging that Word
Giving that Word
I've got that Word on my lips
The Word in my palm
The Word in my mind
Yeah, Word is bond
Verse One
I'm up in The Word ain't no fear in me heart/
Check with me squad, the only thing I fear is me God/
Me pride and me moms, I got freedom/
No death since the second Adam and that's Word!/
Who these cats who now got nerve?/
I walk with boldness like revenge of the nerds/
Only 'cuz the Memrah gave us the smikhah/
Now we get amped just to be his speakers/
The Word will return, ain't no maybes or likely/
Fire in his eyes so don't take it lightly/
Attest it 'cuz he may run up your stairs/
This ain't a game, He's coming with a full marching band/
Blood robe flowing, angels' trumpets blowing/
Ain't no laughing matter but some heads are rolling/
These cats on the block they got swagger on the corner/
But Jesus came through and their swag got ran over./
Chorus
Verse Two
If you knew me in the past, I'm a different kind of dude/
New attitude, no longer described as a fool/
Me shoes or me jewels, got a new cool/
Me stylist is the King of the Jews, that's Word!/
Man thinks the Word is fake? Forty different authors complementing what they say/
Inerrancy of Scripture still holds up today/
He knew what He was doing, He ain't do this by mistake/
The Lord spoke clearly 'cuz He's great and all potent/
Got relevant components 'cuz the Father is all-knowing/
Timeless classics teachable for any moment/
Got many nice sayings but no worthy opponents/
Young men walking with a bounce in their step/
They got right living 'cuz they know what they left/
This new breed ain't scared they'll take it to your chest/
Correct you with love, they'll leave you impressed 'cuz.../
Chorus
Verse Three
I've got that Word on my lips, in my heart, in my palm/
Maybe Mark, maybe Luke, maybe Songs, maybe John/
It makes me cry sometimes but, yeah, that makes me strong/
Make your boy repent when his mind is thinking wrong/
Peace to my heart, something like a smooth song/
Gives rest to the weary when the race feels long
Got me serving my wife, like cooking in the morn/
Got me fleeing temptation when my passions are torn/
Serving the poor, I'm like an open door/
What's mine is yours, yeah, Acts Chapter Four/
Peace in the storm when it feels like its war/
Contentment in my heart when my flesh wants more/
He saw man's need and He gave what He had/
He had riches, homie, then took rags/
Even worse than that to make me feel low/
He gave His life on the Cross so we could live bro/
