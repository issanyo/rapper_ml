[1st Hook]
Lord, Lord you know I tried
When I should have been strong I cried
When I should have helped I walked on by
When I should have told the truth I straight up lied
I know your love has set me free
But I keep on putting you up on that tree
Oh Lord, Have your mercy on me
Loving father put you grace on me, on me

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Tre's nerves are bubbling, juggling jobs, avoid hustling
Hard trusting in God, cuz' now he's struggling
TV's throwing lust at him, Corners boys punking him
Wife wants to fuss with him, LORD keep touching him
He might return to street life, But he'll fight will all he can
But if they test him again, He would hate to have kill a man
The pressure he can't handle it, he's lost ways to channel it
He might Black out, Then he has to be in anger management
His common problem, his values aren't- matching wallet
He's praying but still jobless, his faith used to keep him honest
He's got visions of bad decisions that are void of godly wisdom
So this one bad decision will most likely land him in prison
So a week from now, He'll be at a Bank in town
He'll be yelling get down, with some other clowns, waving a gun around
He'll succeed ducking the cops and leaving with profits
But he'll have problems dodging all the guilt that's working on his conscious

Put Grace on me, on me (3 times)
Loving Father
Put your Mercy on me, on me (3 times)
Loving Father Put you Mercy on me, on me

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Jane feeling the pain, like razors are in her vein
A year since the cancer came, her faith and frame has changed
Chemo and pain killers, the disdain gets realer
Her Hope becomes thinner, from all the news that they give her/
She taking the news with caution, she knows that the Lords awesome
But often there's pauses, of the loses and of what death cost us
Is it worth fighting she nauseous, plus the hospital charges
She's heard there's light in the tunnel but all she sees is Darkness
No one is feeling her burden, they just keep giving her sermons
If they listened with more discernment, they could tell she's hurting
Her speech is just an illusion, she's scared of the end conclusion
If she shares her doubt- she feels her image may become ruined
Shes holding her fears in, tears in, She'll be dead by years in
Shes not thinking through how God forgives sins
Until then her nights are long, alone, faking strong
The corner of her heart, This will be her song, sing

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
How often we go thru the motions, up and down rollercoasting
Scared to admit were hurting, nervous thoughts of perversion
This culture we've built is perfect, were saying his death was worthless
Not to concerned with worship as along we do our churchin
Were decorating our person, just to continue a lies
Or shortcomings we hide, with a shallow disguise
To prove we got it together, to make it seem like were better
Than friends, fam whoever, we take some extreme measures
We have a desire to add, to the grace that we have
Were never content with our lives, we operate within pride
We hate to seem dependant, but that's the way that he intended
Humans made in his image, built to live in the tension
Learn wisdom, we were distant his love we didn't deserve it
We confess we were worthless, then break our backs trying to earn it
Without you I'm, helpless, weak, my existence is bleak
I refuse to proceed without your grace and mercy on me
