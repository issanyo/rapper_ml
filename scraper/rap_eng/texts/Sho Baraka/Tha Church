[Intro: Sho Baraka]
"Ladies and gentlemen, I'll like to interrupt this album
With a little bit of real talk
We 'bout to represent the priest here to the believers
It's your boy Sho biz and Lecrae
Yo let's do this, dawg

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
It goes one for the Father, two for the Son
Three for the Spirit, through whom work is done
Before he cracked the sky, and let leave the the dirt
Let's go ahead and represent tha Church
Wake up in the morning, and I hit my knees early
Face to the floor, thinking I'm not worthy
I'll do that loop-nod thing, gotta bear my cross
Team up with Lecrae, we gotta reach the lost
I'm getting pounds from the church saying
"Sho, you're wrong." but don't get too proud, cause Sho is prone
To lie and conceit while the spirit lies in defeat
Gotta beat the flash daily, cause dawg gotta eat
Cause God's wrath is something we all gotta meet
It don't matter if you black, white, Jew, or Greek
The only way to avoid this doom and despair is if
God x Christ as he with you, and He say
But on the contrite on mah knees it may sound easy
But this living it out thing is hard work [?]
It's the Church, baby, not pews or steeples
But those who shun evil, those Acts 2 people
Not talking 'bout the church your mother's in, and funny hats
But in the streets
Even in the alley school of cats
Quoting many facts, death bury yo resurrection
But get to know that atonement he's coming back
Forget five mics, I want 5 saved souls, (right)
With self-control we're taking the Gospel across the globe
Say word, Sho, that swerve to the deacon, the pastor
The building fund, and the choir's singing
That's real talk, we do it all in His Name
So how 'bout it, let's be a Church without blame
A Church without vain, a Church without shame
But who murdered Christ?!
In that we take claim

[Hook:]
We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life, ya'll
And He did, and for us
And why do it ya'll?
And He did, and because
[2x]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
It goes one for the Father, two for the Son
Three for the Spirit, through whom work is done (c'mon)
Before Christ come back and reign on earth (yeah)
Let's go ahead and represent the Church
I pick up the phone, and Sho
Talkin' 'bout his show, I'm like
I can't go 'cause my dough on low
[?]
I got a knock at the door, he got my ticket in his hands like
You ready to roll?
I'm like (yeah)
It's so good to my system mane
It feel good to be a Christian mane
We got the same spirit workin' with us
We get excited when we think about the Lord comin' back to git us
And what's mine is yours, I know what's yours is mine
Full money, time, or sixteen bars of rhyme
It's like, Acts 4:32 yeah 'Crae dirty too
But the church keep 'Crae from lookin' like a worldly dude
And I ain't talkin' bout the buildings and bricks
I'm talkin' bout the men and women who be gettin' strict

[Hook:]
We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life, ya'll
And He did, and for us
And why do it ya'll?
And He did, and because
[2x]

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka & Lecrae]
I was your everyday sinner, up in the club
Sippin' on (huh?) smokin' on (what?)
Straight from the suburbs but vacant like a thug
Don't mean to glorify but it just is what it was
Yeah you know me too, I was the same dude hustlin'
The same one in the club for fun, and loved lustin'
The same little thief off of Scott street, ya watched me
Probly hoped the cops would come and box me
'Till the Gospel offended me, gave me an identity
A man with a hole losin' grip of his soul
I was introduced to the scriptures and Him who died
I never saw a man cry, 'till he met Christ
[?]
Christ became more than a name, conviction hit my frame
My heart was changed, like somebody hit the light switch
Inside of my brain, and when I hit my knees to pray
It wasn't in vain
I been doin' a lot of thinkin' and I had to invest
In my soul, and all I had to do was say yes!
And ever since then I've been eternally secure
And placed in the Church, all glory to the Lord

[Hook:]
We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life, ya'll
And He did, and for us
And why do it ya'll?
And He did, and because
[2x]

[Outro:]
We the Church
It's the Church, baby [8x]
We the Church
