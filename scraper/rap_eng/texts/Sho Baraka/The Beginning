Alright, what did you--- what did you think of me when we first met?
I thought you were arrogant
*laughs*
...and flirtatious
Oh gosh, okay... no-- nothing good though? Just all negative stuff?
I wouldn't say negative, but I've learned...
Arrogant and flirtatious is not necessarily good qualities
But that's just initially
Then...
And then as the summer went on, I learned more about your character and those traits didn't stand out as much anymore because the ones I was looking for [?] start to stand out
Alright, um... I'll say that when I first saw you uh, I was definitely attracted to your-- to your character and the way that you served. I saw you serving young ladies. I saw you leading and to me, I knew that I could marry a woman who denied herself to, to love and serve other people 'cause I mean, you not gonna always be fine. *laughs* So I'm gonna have to love you, I'ma have to love you... *laughs*
Says who?!
I'ma have to love you for some other reasons and so... uh, the character was something I was like "when that fine go away, she still gon' have fine character." You can manage with [?] *laughs*
