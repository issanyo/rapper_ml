[Verse 1:]
We await the return of the rock, the world will get rocked/
Pray you see this ain't a game stop passing the rock/
He holds the top stop but he's still getting mocked/
When he cracks the sky all that mocking gon' stop/
This is just some theme music like rock n' roll-a little something, something when he rocks the globe/
You think your on top he'll rock your role- he ain't Lee Jerkins but he'll rock ya soul/
Yeah he took many lashes and took the blows-wore the crown of thorns and rocked the robe/
Even took the cross and struck a pose- he knew on the third day he'll roll the stone/
Then I saw something I never saw before-high and exalted I saw the LORD/
Then I wrote a song about how I saw the LORD tried to tell everybody that I saw the LORD/
Look to the heavens it's a bird in the sky-look a little closer it's the LORD on high/
Lord and King on his robe and thigh-get your passport cuz the LORD's so fly/
Whether it's the Rapture or second flood-think about this for a second cuz/
Think about this for a second cuz-you sure you want to square up with the LORD above/
No cuz we see the end \, no we gon' win trying not to sin live off his word and oxygen/
Until he comes back we're building up the church for him/

[Chorus:]
All my people on the left, all my people on the right
From the front to the back shout it loud all night
Maranatha (Come and get me) 4x
To all my people on the right, all my people on the left
From the back to the front, shout it loud to your death
Maranatha (Come and get me) 4x

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
All rise, for the coming of the king of the Jews/follow me through the
Bible while I bring you the truth/open book and take a look and you
Can see this dude/overlook Him and forsook Him, you'll be singing the
Blues/you can say I want to see Him, matter of fact I want to watch
Him/you can say I wanna be Him, matter of fact I wanna copy Him/you
Can say I'm getting deep, man I'm going for the bottom/you can say I
Really need Him, man I can't live without Him/can't wait till I get to
Go on home/when you hear the trump, I'll be long gone/I'll be caught
Up in the sky saying, so long/you waiting on the LORD, just hold
On/this should be the hope of every christian listen/to me every
Christian, pray/for maranatha/His quick return for every christian/So
All my people on the left/are you looking for the coming of the King
From His thron on high/And all my people on the right/has the
Knowledge of the coming of the King put a change in your life/If not
Then it should baby, this not just a good fable/this God never would
Play you/His Son died so He could save you/This is the hope of the
Ones in the One that's coming/it doesnt yet appear, but we'll be like
The One thats coming/the one that runs it, eternal/with the Father by
The Spirit of promise/picture people living life according ot this
Promise, affecfted by the accounts that the Son of man is coming/thats
A banging motivator that should get your heartrate up as you are
Reaching for your crown, your reward from the Maker/
