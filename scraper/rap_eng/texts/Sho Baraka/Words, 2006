[Crying & Screaming]

[Hook]
Yeah, maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe

[Verse 1]
All I wanted a perfect life
Some perfect kids and a perfect wife
Some perfect days and some perfect nights
Even though I'm flawed, I should be alright
A child with special needs didn't fit in my plans
I'm a needy man, wanting more that what you put in his hands
All I wanted was a perfect family core
Now I'm envying the family next door
Trying not to trust therapy more than God
I am walking the street where fear and love collide
I am learning in weakness, you still gotta serve
And my connection with my boys is way deeper than words
But damn, words, I thrive with 'em
Words are my life, my career, I survive with 'em
I'm given a life sentence that words can't fix
Now we both live in a world that don't make sense

[Hook]
Yeah, maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love

[Verse 2]
My sons are not a punishment or an accident
Just a little abstract masterpiece of what the Master did
I try not to doubt the power of prayer
But many times, I just feel like the power ain't there
Some days I'm feeling good, some days I'm feeling torn
I'm getting praise for activities a father should perform
I get applause when I excel, thank you
Is there grace for me when I fail and I'm feeling shameful?

[Hook]
Yeah, well, maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love

[Verse 3]
My father said he needed greater trust in the Lord
And the Lord used cancer so he could trust in Him more
He died without complaining, that's when I understood
He taught me more in his silence than a sermon ever could
Words can be lies to help us disguise our phoniness
Feeling insecure in the midst of pride and loneliness
I learned the meaning of contentment really fast
Wanting change while appreciating everything that you have

[Hook]
Yeah, maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe words don't say much
Maybe I should just learn to shut up

[Bridge]
Only you know
Only you know
Ohhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
Only you know
Only you know
Ohhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

[Verse 4]
Truth is your presence speaks much louder than when a choir sings
I never knew I'll find joy up in the smallest things
The counsellor said "Live long, love strong, stick together
This is a thorny rose you two will carry forever
Find value in your interactions, and not in your treasure
Find strength in Jesus, increase your faith in good measure
Avoid evil, your kids need a home that is peaceful
Don't be a passive man, understand that your family needs you
Pray for healing, hoping they find a cause"
But after all, I resolved, you are not a problem to solve
Maybe I wouldn't change you
Maybe I'm just unable to see your potential
Because I'm blinded by the labels

[Hook]
Yeah, maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe words don't say much

[Outro]
In that moment, we had a breakthrough
Silence, I want to thank you
In that moment, we had a breakthrough
Silence, I want to thank you
