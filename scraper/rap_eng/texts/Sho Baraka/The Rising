[Intro: Erica Cumbo]
Oh what a beauty that life was found
Life was found
Life was found
Only in those whom which grace abounds
Grace abounds
Grace abounds
Darkness can no longer hold me down
Hold me down
Hold me down
It's a new day now the sun is out
Sun is out
Sun is out

[Sho Barka]
The sun's out, the sun's out...

[Sho Baraka]
I got a whole lotta light. Homie Imma let it shine. (shine)
A whole lotta light. Homie, Imma let it shine, (shine)
A whole lotta light. Homie, Imma let it shine, (shine)
Homie, let it shine. (shine)
Homie, let it shine. (shine)

[Erica Cumbo]
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
Sun's out, the sun is out. (Yeah, ok)

[Sho Baraka]
We do the Father's business, you can go to work too
These are family matters, some are just Urkel
We celebrate the Son, yeah he brings life now
A whole lotta people asking us to calm down
You'd get excited if you understood forgiveness
And you should see the difference ever since the light hit us
I'm no English teacher, but I can spell repentance
And eternity in hell is a run on sentence

(Slow down.)

[Sho Baraka]
Yeah, how do we escape that?
Only by getting that judge to erase that
You heard that, he's the homie, death couldn't hold him
He carried the weight of the world on his shoulders
Best straighten up, death's getting closer
Either you're crooked or the world's leaning over
Living in the sun is a lifestyle, some got the light, but watcha gonna do now?

[Sho Baraka]
I got a whole lotta light. Homie Imma let it shine. (shine)
A whole lotta light. Homie, Imma let it shine, (shine)
A whole lotta light. Homoe, Imma let it shine, (shine)
Homie, let it shine. (shine)
Homie, let it shine. (shine)

[Erica Cumbo]
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
Sun's out, the sun is out

(Yeah, what, ok.)

[Trip Lee]
When you said the sun is out, whatcha really mean?
Let me make it plain, let me spill the beans. (spill the beans)
God sent his Son just to intervene
Cause we was walking dead, like that Thriller scene. (Yo)
You want things to be better but its still a dream
The work God already started, he's fulfilling things
Hang with Adam like he's still a fiend
But instead I try to walk in that light like Mike in Billy Jean

[Trip Lee]
Slow down
I was all about me [?]
Trying to get ahead like a guillotine
But now I'm following the head, he's the realest thing
He lived and rose, bro, but he died in between
So if you want some evidence that he was really [?]
Look at the lives of the guys [?]
Cause he opened up our eyes, bro, we been redeemed
Praise God, the sun is out, I can feel the beams

[Sho Baraka]
I got a whole lotta light. Homie Imma let it shine. (shine)
A whole lotta light. Homie, Imma let it shine, (shine)
A whole lotta light. Homie, Imma let it shine, (shine)
Homie, let it shine. (shine)
Homie, let it shine. (shine)
(Yeah)

[Erica Cumbo]
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
Sun's out, the sun is out

(Yeah)

[Sho Baraka]
Look at folks in other countries believe
He walked on water just to reach over seas
Yeah, he's fully God, fully man
He thought the Son was down, but he would rise once again
Let's go

[Erica Cumbo]
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
Sun's out, the sun is out

[Sho Baraka]
The Good Shepherd, a barn was his birthplace
Who else you know would stop time with the birthday. (Nobody)
Many people live their lives just to get dough
Watch the bread of life rise without the yeast though

(Let's go.)

[Sho Baraka and Trip Lee]
Joy to the world, gift to all the people
Best Christian rap ya hear without a beat, yo

(Shine)

The way we view the sun is so feeble
That's why we live backwards and we're so evil

[Erica Cumbo]
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
I told ya boys that the sun is out
Sun's out, the sun is out
