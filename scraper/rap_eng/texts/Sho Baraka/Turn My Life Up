(Intro)
Turn my life up, baby!

(Hook)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
No more low living, (no)
No more low living, (no)
No more low living, (no) (Live at a 10, live at a 10)
No more low living, (no) (Live at a 10, live at a 10)

(Verse 1)
Remember setting apart in my heart to walk that line
Had the nerve to tell GOD to have some things in line
When I graduate from college has some jobs in line
Convert about five or six friends of mine
I wanna grow old, no dangers of any kind
Throw in a couple kids and a wife that's fine
Handed Him the contract like "Can you sign that line?"
He ripped it up and said "That's your plans not mine"
So now everyday I gotta renew my mind
To prove the perfect will of God with faith that's blind
Cuz even after days of placing faith in Christ
I came mighty close to almost wasting my life
Understanding eternal life is knowing that man
And now my boys trip cause I'm in love with a man
They trip even more when I tell em that I'm a bride
They know I'm sincere cause I say it with pride
And I.....

(Hook)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
No more low living, (no)
No more low living, (no)
No more low living, (no) (Live at a 10, live at a 10)
No more low living, (no) (Live at a 10, live at a 10)

Verse 2
I used to pray just to change God not to change me
I realized the more I prayed He changed me
Even if I only prayed during storms, He changed me
And now I write of marvellous works like Stan Lee
I gladly play Indian and He:chief
I'll be that sitting bull when He speaks
I try to speak more with my feet less with my teeth
I try to be more of the Spirit less of me
I try to be more of a man less of a G
How many Saints wasting their life proving they street
This young cat said he would come to Christ
But he don't really think that its fun in Christ
Well I didn't come to prove that its fun in Christ
I came here to preach the abundant life
And I didn't even come to get crunk tonight
But while we're lets have fun tonight

(Hook)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
No more low living, (no)
No more low living, (no)
No more low living, (no) (Live at a 10, live at a 10)
No more low living, (no) (Live at a 10, live at a 10)

(Verse 3)
Will GOD provides my needs? Probably not my wants
Be careful what you ask for He'll give you what you want
Israel asked for a king, He gave them what they want
Had a couple righteous kings, but most of them were chumps
The disciples wanted Christ glory, he gave them his cup
You know, persecution and death, that kind of stuff
The world wants its sin so he's given it up
But then He gives His son, He's risen us up
I wanna live at a ten but I've been cool at a five
I exaggerate my victories, living a lie
Deny my shortcomings so many times
Just to prove to my homeboys I live at a nine
But at the root of the issue, I struggle with pride
I struggle to live when he calls me to die
So now I want my happiness in holiness and grace
Instead of seeking for a blessing I'm seeking his face

(Hook)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
Turn My Life Up , the abundant life (yeah)
No more low living, (no)
No more low living, (no)
No more low living, (no) (Live at a 10, live at a 10)
No more low living, (no) (Live at a 10, live at a 10)

(Outro)
(Live at a 10, live at a 10)
I pray by the mercy and grace of God, man
That we would live in the fullness of His calling
The we would experience the abundant life on Earth
As it is in heaven
That we would find happiness and His holiness in love
And that we would turn our life up, and live at a 10, baby

C'mon, lets get it!
