[Intro]
I was wondering
Are you listening, baby?
Ayo Braille, you said it was cool if I could rap, right?
Alright, cool

[Verse 1]
First Shaq and Kobe break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with the flow
Well, what do you know? Maybe the problem ain't Sho
You need ears to hear, maybe you listen too slow
You got folks losing sleep trying to prove that they woke
The other half on Twitter try to prove that they dope
Social media activists, they arguing over quotes
When a society's on fire, I'm trying to avoid the smoke
Some will only love me when I'm dead or in a dress
An Uncle Tom or oppressed, a brother that's hotep
I don't care, my dude, I don't trip
I just walk through your park kicking down your monoliths
Decolonize the gospel then express it through my vocal cords
Fishing for souls, that's why I'm going overboard
While the church folks are hiding their dirty secrets
I can't believe we're over here arguing over "penis"
I'm close to Jesus, I'm also close to genius
Out of this world, I'm also close to Venus
Linguist, I'm speaking healing through broken English
Two dollars in my pocket but I still feel distinguished
Clean as dental floss, close to the Harlem Renaissance
Boy spit fire, you probably thought it was Pentecost
I'm out to lunch eating rappers around nine
A.M. in the morning because I'm way ahead of my time

[Scratches: DJ Efechto]

[Verse 2]
This is that real hip-hop before iTunes
Before mumbling rappers were saying nothing
I mean, if you love it, I guess I can show grace
This is real men at work, these jokers is Kid n' Play
I want that Miseducation, that Midnight Maraudin'
That life before Eve ate the fruit in the garden
'Cause it's still 20/20, still kingdom people, still Jesus music
Different label but I'm still with the movement
This is [?] rebels on a different level
Breaking new ground trying to dig in with a different shovel
My rhymes are vicious, your flow is suspicious
Joe Paterno with the flow, my pen brings conviction
No gentrifying my intellectual property
This is the writer's block, I have a monopoly
I rap tight like burritos and European speedos
Please excuse my ego, these jokers are Jared Leto
Yeah, I may be clowns like Nemo
Chances of me being wack - never to zero
Suckers think they can beat me, I laugh
Eat 'em up then demonstrate it on pie graphs
You cannot get at me, homie, this ain't Twitter
You and I carry this film[?] the same glitter
So when they wanna describe my body and work
Say no matter how messy, he's in love with the Church
Yeah, he's conscious, Cross Movement mixed with Common
A professor and prophet who is now sound bombing
He is trap-jazz gospel mixed with hip-hop soul
Some say he's too safe, some say he's out of control
Denmark Vesey getting heavy, some may call him the aggressor
He's moving between thugs and seminary professors
He writes with intelligence and honors his heritage
The bottom line is he is changing the narrative

[Outro]
Feast your ears on the least expected
Pay attention, so, so lets pay attention
So, so, so listen up

Fly excellent, I fall excellent
But never quit
Yeah, fly excellent, I fall excellent
But never quit

Yeah sometimes you just gotta show these jokers you can rap
