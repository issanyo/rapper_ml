You and I have been through everything
So that's why I give you everything
That includes the me no one else is seeing
And no one else is seeing
When I get to dress down with my headwrap on
Or you walking around in your sweats in a rest with your t-shirt on
Nobody else can get to see
This is the best of you and me
This is the we that no one else is seeing
And no one else is seeing

When I get to dress down with my headwrap on
Or you walking around in your sweats in a rest with your t-shirt on

[Sho Baraka]
Nah it's cool what you wearing, ain't no need to change
We unite cause you fly when you looking plain
[?] yeah you chilling with the headwrap on
You communicating swag when they say it wrong
You don't need those name brands to get compliments
Your name is a brand and it's confidence
But you still enjoying life and you have some fun
You know when to stay low and then turn it up
All the ways I can describe you, yeah I'm lost for words
And I swerve, swerve, swerve, you got lots of curves
Yeah you all about the class and I'm here to learn
Yeah I read your body language, yeah I'm such a nerd
I'm a simple man, I want simple things
You still a queen when you wearing jeans
Your life is swag and you keep it clean
When you check your mate, I'm still the king
We give and go, we a dangerous team
You ain't from here, we Stranger Things
You angel fly, I see your wings
I ain't blowing smoke, no gasoline
