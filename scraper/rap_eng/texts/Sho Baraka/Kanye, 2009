[gospel sample]

[Refrain: Sho Baraka]
I got somethin' to say (Go and say it then)
I got somethin' to say (Go and say it then)
I got somethin' to say (Go and say it then)

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Jamie Portee]
"How, Jay?!"
This is my Kanye rant
Tell everybody this is my Kanye rant
Uh, what
This is my Kanye rant
Can I talk for a minute, yeah?
Can I talk for a second, yeah?
Can I talk?
Let me talk (Shut up!)

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
They like "You better watch your mouth"
I'd rather pray for forgiveness for what might come out
Lord, have mercy on the words I speak
I'll have an opinion but might change my views next week
Like, why, when I share my faith it's called intolerance
But when they share their hate it's called scholarship?
And why ain't no Whole Foods in the hood?
All I see is fast food here, can we eat good?
We need black-owned and less bad loans
Less pawn shops and liquor stores and We Buy Gold
And why black history always starts with slavery
So even when I'm learning
They still putting them chains on me

[Pre-Hook]
I got something to say
(Go on say it then)
I got something to say
(Go on say it then)
I got something to say
(Go on say it then)

[Hook]
Be quiet!
This is my Kanye rant
Everybody listen up to my Kanye rant
Please, this is my Kanye rant
Can I talk for a minute, yeah
Can I talk for a second, yeah
Can I talk
Let me talk

[Verse 2: Jackie Hill Perry]
Yo, can I speak for a minute?
Why everybody on Twitter try to be prolific
Try to be so gifted
To those typos go swipe on your image
Get a filter for that, so that Michael in yo writtens
It's a privilege in fact
That's like, stop asking me about the lack of female rappers
You rappers ain't even ready for what's gon' happen after
We busy being mothers while you chasing platforms
You fat for 'em - you living backwards
No wonder why you salty
Lot's wife taught him well
On why the Sodom call me
Probably cause I'm snatching bodies out the fire falling
Light a match and ask your daddy who is Maury calling?

[Pre-Hook]
I got something to say
(Go on say it then)
I got something to say
(Go on say it then)
I got something to say
(Go on say it then)

[Hook: Sho Baraka]
I'm genius!
This is my Kanye rant
Everybody listen up to my Kanye rant
Can I talk for a minute, yeah
Can I talk for a second, yeah
Can I talk
Let me talk

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Is this rap or a cry for help?
Because many times, I think that I confuse myself
I'm just small time, but some think I can change rap
They think I'm BET, they want me to bring the game back
They like "Sho, you inspire so many folk
But what is it all for when you're creative and broke?"
I know, I know, money don't solve problems but
Influence don't stop Sallie Mae from calling
It's enough to drive a brother to depression
I'm rich in spirit but my pocket's in recession
This is braille, I'm just telling you how I feel
Only fake people gotta remind you they keep it real (I keep it real)
I'm fighting my pride trying to be the nice guy
On my Michael Jackson, just trying to see the bright side
My white friends think I'm all about black power
My black friends living in ebony towers
My artist friends have terrible work habits
My Christian friends got the truth but live passive
I reproduce they habits, I can't even hate
I guess we're all brothers but I still can't relate

[Outro: Sho Baraka, Natalie Lauren & Jamie Portee]
I was wondering
Are you listening, baby?
I was wondering
Maybe I'm the one crazy

Sho, you really talk, talk, talking 'bout nothing
See 'em out running you ain't saying nothing, nothing
People nowadays can't be trusted
So stop lying, why you be fronting?

I was wondering (shut up)
Are you listening, baby?
Maybe I'm the one crazy

All I hear is wa wa wa wa wa shut up!
All I hear is wa wa wa wa wa shut up!
All I hear is wa wa wa wa wa shut up!

Can I talk?
Let me talk!

You ain't really talking 'bout nothing. Shut up!
You ain't really talking 'bout nothing. Shut up!
You ain't really talking 'bout nothing. Shut up!
You ain't really talking 'bout nothing. Shut up!
Man, you ain't really really really talking 'bout nothing. Shut up!
You ain't really talking 'bout nothing. Shut up!
Cuz, you ain't talking 'bout nothing. Shut up!
Shut up!

Hey, make that bad man go away. (Go away)
Make that that bad man go away. (Go away)
Make that that bad man go away. (Go away)
He talking crazy, make that man go away
Make that that bad man go away. (Go away)
He talking crazy...
