[Verse 1:]
She can hear the choir clap and hear the deacon hum
Fingers slide across the organ, hear the bass thump
All the saints in the church on one accord
Singing with a passion to him like "Oh My Lord
Through sickness and death, yeah you're still Lord
Through success and wealth, yeah you're still Lord
But church I got something you could pray for
The soul of my son that he begins to pray more
And please Lord save my son from his sins
Although he's locked in prison I pray he be born again
But at the same time he writes his mom a final note
Sayin sorry for the hurt, trouble, lies and dope
Sorry mom I let you down but I'm losing hope
But my freedom comes now in a chair and rope
She gets a letter from the prison and her tears pour
Cuz all she can say is "Oh My Lord"

[Hook:]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord

[Verse 2:]
Reflecting on the words of my praying big brother
Somebody slipped me Helen Baylor's Praying Grandmother
Then I thought of my great grandmother
A vessel of the Lord sharing signs and wonders
You couldn't tell me that my granny wasn't saved then
Couldn't see couldn't walk still trying to praise him
I would sit and just watch in amazement
She got a strength within that could shame brave men
But now we would call her faith sort of Ancient
But her family saw her faith and it changed them
It took a while for me to realize my granny's faith
About the same time I realized the Lord's grace
Some would say she didn't have much to live for
But as long as she lived she knew that he was still Lord
She didn't have one dollar or cent
But quiet is kept my great grandma was rich

[Hook:]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord

[Verse 3:]
I've seen a weak man demonstrate strong faith
I've seen a lame sister running this long race
I've seen an undeserving people get the Lord's grace
I've even seen a blind man seeking out the Lord's face
Take a look at the name that the Lord made
Testimonies echo from the grave of the freed slaves
From Jim Crow laws to protest in the street
Got people on their knees praying Lord bring peace
A daughter crying cuz her mom's on crack
Her pop's is in prison and her brother's going back
Lord help em see that you bring life
And even in the darkness Lord you bring light
And even that dumb man you make wise
And even to the weak man you give might
People saying runaway but not where to
Well my earnest prayer is that they start running to you

[Outro:]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord
Thank you Lord, Lord, Lord

You're still Lord
