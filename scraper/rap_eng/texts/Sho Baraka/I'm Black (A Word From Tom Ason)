I'm black because I'm the opposite of white
(Naw, that's not it)
I'm black because I was told I have a slave masters last name and I shouldn't eat swine because it's the white man's animal
(That's not it either)
I'm black because I like to wear jeans that let my underwear breathe and I desire a cuff so it falls right off my boots
(Naw, naw, naw)
I'm black because I'm baneful, dirty, filthy, disgusting, or at least that's what the Webster dictionary says
(Hmm naw, naw, naw)
I'm black because I abbreviate everything from timberland to timbles, polo, p-lo, style, stylo, down, d-lo in which someone had the nerve to label it Ebonics
(Naw, naw, naw)
I'm black because the only vacation my dad knows is on the weekends
Hmm
No I'm black because that's what you see
Not who I be
(Naw, naw, naw)
If shallow egotistical comparisons were never made
I wouldn't be black my brother next door wouldn't be white he'll just be a lighter version of me
Or I a dark skinned version of him
(Point taken)
So it's a reality
Propagated by society
Setup not biblically to define you and me
But embraced by Christianity
Continuing on this insanity
Distorted as this world's perception may be
Who I am and what I am
I thank God because...
I'm black
