Sho:
What’s good get your Ls up
We are back at it again
You know your boy had to let the ladies speak right
All my virtuous women
We are going to go ahead and make this one
The official ladies’ remix…haha
We can be more, lady we can be more x2
Mahogany Jones:
Let’s be more than a one hit or a quitter
A one night stand that gets blasted on twitter
Come on let’s show the world that real love can make it
With God on our side, every trial we can face it
We can out last the test of time
You keep your virginity and I’ll keep mine
Until the glorious day when we ent-twine
As husband and wife ain’t no sin on our minds
Yo we could be walking down the aisles
Matching with the bands on our hands with a smile
*Lay down a……….* with our first child
Sitting back thinking like man this is wow
Peace in our relationship, ain’t nothing but a foul
Friends that are married having fun all the while
The world is like wow
We can show them the right way
No more child’s play
Let me do you a good thing, you’ll be glad that you found me

( Chorus )
See girl
(girl you know you got my heart, heart)
You know i love you so much
(and you know i love you so much, much)
This is more than lust
(this is more than lust, lust)
You and i could be us
(you and i could become us, us) yeah
Say girl (we knew each other for a while, while)
I know we just friends
(and i know you said we just friends but)
We can be more lady we can be more (2x)
Erica Cumbo:
Will you be my ricky or bobby, my new addition
I can be your candy girl and *cover your nutrition*
Am a proverbs 31 true to the heart
You a man of God for real not just fronting the part
When we aretogether and alone you always protect our purity
Fort knox sherlock kindof security
Heart never wandering
Hands never travelling
Never felt your eyes mentally unravelling
Naah, my physical features
You are my best friend for life, you are a keeper
Me all dressed in white am’a meet ya
Down at the altar speaking vows for the preacher

(Chorus)
Butta P:
Started off friends just chopping it up
It’s funny how time flies now look at us
We used to kick back thinking things that dream up
I couldn’t breathe without you
We was two kids in love
You was mr.shy guy
I was in the rush, am feeling like a kid again
I think I got a crush
Two birds of a feather willing to do whatever
You taught me how to fight for this love
You make me better
Now you are mine forever
Nobody will love you better
I ain’t chopping time youand me we chop each other
I don’t need no money material things however
As long as we are a team, loving you
Will be my pleasure
Sho:

Tell her
We can be more, lady we can be more x2
