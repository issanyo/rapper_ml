[Intro: Sho Baraka]
Yeah
Trap, trap jazz

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Courtney Orlando]
Hold up, I know you don't want no problems now
Break it down, there's no way you can keep us out
Excellence, you know we about our excellence
Oh lord, oh lord run it back again
Hat on top 'cause we think excellent
Frames on straight 'cause I see excellent
Dressed for success 'cause I be excellent
Everything we do, everything we do
Excellent
TSB 'cause we live excellent
Art on high 'cause we make excellent
We thank God 'cause He be excellent
Everything we do, everything we do
Ooh!

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Bars like Attica
Rap Benjamin Banneker
Building up communities, here to raise the standard up
Excellence
Yeah that new Peter and Paul
Gordon Parks, off the charts
It's Kobe without a ball
(Excellence)
Booker T, giving knowledge for cheap
Smart and cool, that's a college degree
Excellent like building strong families through years of oppression
There is no recession when all you know is the Great Depression
Reading Phillis Wheatley I'm tryna avoid the greedy
Mother Teresa in sneakers, tryna serve the needy
Cool in school, FAMU & Tuskegee
New school educators - Dhati and Thabiti
Focused like Moses but I'm feeling ill-equipped
I'm praying for a rod and the Red Sea to split
A crew to hold me up and a pharaoh to beef wit'
Just point me to the promise, I'm exiting Egypt

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Courtney Orlando]
Hold up, I know you don't want no problems now
Break it down, there's no way you can keep us out
Excellence, you know we about our excellence
Oh lord, oh lord run it back again
Excellence
Hat on top 'cause we think excellent
Frames on straight 'cause I see excellent
Dressed for success 'cause I be excellent
Everything we do, everything we do

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Excellent
We problem solvers they are problem starters
Excellent
We lay down our life, come visit the martyrs
I'd rather better judgement than a bigger budget
I guess massive money make you jokers coon in public
Annie Malone and Bethune, we excellent educators
Serena with nothing but love, we still serve the haters
Feeling old, gimme soul, rap Leon Bridges
When I commit to drop these hits, y'all gon' need some stitches
Excellent
Fight for justice from creation to the tomb
I know Black lives matter, and they should matter in the womb
(Talk to 'em Sho!)
I don't do a lot of talking
Most of you who claim you woke are really sleep walking
Praying for the strength so I can fight for the people
Only thing I'm afraid of is God and my ego
Following false heroes, giving my vote to Nero
If they Marshall Law I'm playing Danny DeVito

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Courtney Orlando]
Hold up, I know you don't want no problems now (problems now)
Break it down, there's no way you can keep us out (keep us out)
Excellence, you know we about our excellence
Oh lord, oh lord
Excellent
Hat on top 'cause we think excellent
Frames on straight 'cause I see excellent
Dressed for success 'cause I be excellent
Everything we do, everything we do

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Excellent it's when information turns into wisdom
Excellent like the peace that came with Mandela out the prison
Excellent it's knowing I'm not defined by the wealth and stuff
Get the rich, line 'em up, they'll tell you money is not enough
Forgive us Lord 'cause we want love without truth
The world is spiritually poor 'cause we want heaven without you
It's malpractice, we want healing without patience
We don't want a heart transplant, we want facelifts
I was poetic so they forgave my poor ethics
A misogynistic skeptic with methods of good aesthetics
I was so dirty, unworthy and insufficient
I don't worry, he loves me when when I'm inconsistent
Commitment greater than talent, service over status
Passion over tactics, I don't drive your bandwagon
I keep grinding until they name a climate after me
Until it's common knowledge you jokers shouldn't be rhyming after me
I'm wired to be inspired by the lovers and the haters
I take it to different levels like I'm rapping on elevators
If you reaching for the top you better learn to survive
You can either fall or fly when you reaching for the sky

[Outro: Sho Baraka]
Fly excellent
Or fall excellent
But never quit
Never quit
