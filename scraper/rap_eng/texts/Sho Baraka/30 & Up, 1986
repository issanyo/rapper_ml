[Intro]
I mean you can't be stupid your whole life
You gotta grow up eventually
DJ play this song, play this song, DJ, maybe we could change the world
DJ play this song, play this song, DJ, maybe we could change the world


[Verse 1]
Excuse me um I'm going to make it through the crowd bruh
I'm just trying to dance with nostalgia
Classy and charming and beautifully dressed
Of course I'm looking fresh in my fedora and vest
If looks could kill she about to do damage
Better take a pic make it quick Instagram it
Too old for skinny jeans too young for linens
Got a young man's fresh with an old man's wisdom
A diamond leader respect it up on the block
You got your band two knocks twist curls and locks
Imma act cool, Eddie Murphy Boomerang
You the flavor Halle Berry, (mmm) Sweet Thing
We can be more I can still be your king
You a Tracee Ellis Ross Queen child of The Supreme
I'm talking about love they're talking about lust
They don't want to grow up but we 30 and up!

[Hook]
Talk that talk you better walk that walk
Girl you know we got to work to stay in love
When I'm feeling high when I'm feeling low
You change my world with every touch
All I know is that you're 30 and up
Keep moving you got my heart and got my soul don't stop because you're 30 and up
Keep moving you got my heart and got my soul don't stop because you're 30 and up


[Verse 2]
Yo DJ What happened to the love song? Hey you take requests?
They say that real love is gone
You a lie tell him that we got it
There’s no limit to our love tell him that we Bout It (Uhhh!!)
Haters can't touch this we Too Legit to Quit all we need is some Hammer pants and an s-curl kit
Some will celebrate someone want you to struggle
Don't get bent out of shape but just keep those Squares Out Your Circle
We too mature to be acting like teenagers
Acting like I'm fake to impress these strangers somebody must have found the Fountain of Youth. Bottled it up and didn't give that bottle to you!
We stay dating with no expiration put the kids to sleep and have adult conversations
Far from drunk but what's in my cup is only for the heads in the room that's 30 and up

[Hook]
Talk that talk you better walk that walk
Girl you know we got to work to stay in love
When I'm feeling high when I'm feeling low
You change my world with every touch

[Bridge]
All I know is tonight if you're ready to have a good time and leave your kids at home let me hear you say yeah. Say yeah
Yeah and if you're all grown-up, too fly show nothing but love
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah

[Outro]
DJ play this song, play this song, DJ, maybe we can change the world
DJ play this song, play this song, DJ, maybe we can change the world
Yeah. Go back in time and tell the young me
Don't rush through life, move slowly
Don’t be a player, trying to collect trophies
Don't break hearts, you just end up lonely!
