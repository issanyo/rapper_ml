[Hook: Christon Gray]
Oh wherever you came from give my regards
Somebody made a work of art
And I just think it's so bizarre that I'm in the picture
So for better or for worse I'm seeking the Lord
Sometimes it's back to the drawing board
But I won't give up 'til I'm sure it's a perfect picture

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Okay, meet Claire, ha, she says she's single and content
She says she ain't lookin' for a man but we know she really is
Prayin' makin' a list of things her husband needs to ﬁt
A fit 10 who loves the Lord, she won't settle for no 6
Oh well, let me introduce you to a 6 named Cliff
He ain't Adonis, but then again Claire ain't even a goddess
Million dollar smile with some 50 dollar pockets
He got a killer charm and he been walkin' with the Lord
They get introduced and then they have a couple dates
And after months of bein' fake I guess they get sick of the chase
After counsel and growth Cliff goes shoppin' for a ring
Spits a little game at her like "won't you be my queen?"
She wants a big weddin' which means spendin' big bucks
He's thinkin' of future expenses he wants to save up
Mom told her be submissive baby, don't be contentious
Be quick to listen baby girl, your words can be vicious
Father told him never stop datin' your wife
The honeymoon is one night, she needs good sex her whole life
What God has put together, let no man tear apart
They have their whole life in front of 'em and this is just the start

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Okay, chapter 2, Cliff and Claire have a new situation
New child, new career, they need new patience
It's a different place in life cuz it's a different marriage
They need new expectations now that they've become parents
Cliff wants the wife with the shape of his wedding day
Claire wants more help with the child and a more servant mate
Well since he ain't gettin' sex, and she ain't gettin' served
They both do small things to work each other's nerves
Because of debt and school loans and the house they own
He keepin' up with the Jones's, this brother's never home
The things that caught her eye she used to like but she don't like no mo
The jokes that came out of his mouth well now she hopes he keeps it closed
So when he works he ﬂirts and he gets attention from the boss's assistant
This is causin' some tension
She complains so much, man he really starts to hate it
Her words are cuttin' him deep so he feels emasculated
This makes Cliff very passive but also quite aggressive
They both are stressin' cuz their marriage is depressin'
They've given up on the portrait it's back to the drawing board
They need the right frame of reference so they can paint some more

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
(Okay, chapter 3)
After seein' that their selfish ways were really only hurtin'
They ain't perfect but the couple is workin' with counsel
Seein' Jesus and other couples as the model
Dyin' to serve each other is the paint brush to follow
Who would think to love somebody as bad as us
Love ain't love unless it can be taken advantage of
Love's a commitment at my expense for your benefit
It's a call to action even when the server ain't feelin' it
I think they know now, they've learned to surround
Themselves with other married couples and lay aside the crown
Cliff learned how to cheat his job and not cheat his wife
Changing his expectations and prioritize his life
Claire learned that small things can cause great fights
She's trying to serve in spite of and not serve in spite
If anything we could model our great hero
Always give 100 percent and expect zero
