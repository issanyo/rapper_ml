[Intro: Sho Baraka]
It's chaos
It's real chaos
Okay

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Let me tell you about Dana
She lives in Decatur
Her and her friend Sasha
They don't know their proper
English
They want to travel England
They want to be singers
They want to be dreamers
A mix between Beyonce and a Trina
A mix between some hood and some divas
They don't hear of Jesus
Well, maybe on Easter
And sometimes on Christmas
They living the fiction
Religion is so distant
They just want a thug with some nice rims
Maybe he will like them
Make music, and will sign them
Maybe he will guide them
Make them into stars
Buy them a nice house and drive a fancy car
And no tellin' where he'll take us
Maybe to Jamaica
Please don't be too anxious
You know that boys' a thug
All he cares about is power, money, sex, and drugs
He's just going to use them
Pimp them and abuse them
They'll be know from LA down to Houston
Not because of music
But because of child prostitution
They become content with what they're doing in life full of ruin
They don't see God with a solution, so

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Courtney Orlando]
Grab your gun
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos
Grab your cash
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos
Rule the world
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos
Live your life
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
My man got shot last night
Got popped last night
It's been months since he dropped that pipe
A decision that some don't like
His life wasn't easy but my boy had fight
I'm telling you my man was doing things right
And how does God reward him by taking his life?
Excuse me if I seem just a little uptight
I'm not too impressed with your God or Christ
He had a son Clyde
Marketers told him "bye" (bye)
He didn't have a dime, but he does have a nine (nine)
His nine was a ghetto credit card accepted in all stores
Got no declines, no fees, no charge
He rode with little Eric (Eric)
Eric hates his parents
He lives in the burbs so he was so embarrassed
Cuz he never heard gunshots
Crips or the Blood spots
Didn't know his neighbors cuz they were rich and they had lots
Sniff cocaine, love pot
Tax evade, wife swap
He wants to escape, so he listens to hip-hop
Clyde has a surprise for Eric at the Chop Shop
He found out Eric killed his pop over some street rock

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Courtney Orlando]
Grab your gun
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos
Grab your cash
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos
Rule the world
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos
Live your life
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
I've seen it done proper
I've seen some imposters
Missions done abroad
Missions to mi casa
Some say why bother, some serve out of pride
And some just do it for the badge of honor
They sending missionaries cuz they went to seminary
And they feel like they gotta
Not because the Father
Encouraged them to service
It's not out of worship
They're not really committed
They treat it like a courtship
Do they love community?
Do they love unity?
Do they walk in purity?
Will they rep the King?
Do they treasure the Lord?
Or do they treasure things?
Take a look around you
Have you people seen?
This world's full of chaos
They call themselves playas
They treat it like a game
Each person is to blame
All I know is I don't want my life to be in vain
Like blood or cocaine
Like the whole of Ukraine
If God gave you a blank sheet, would you sign your name?
If the future's unknown, I pray your heart don't change
Even if you're promised pain and the world calls you insane
You should still jump aboard on that plane
C'mon

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Courtney Orlando]
Grab your girls
Live wild cuz there's nowhere to run, live for self cuz there's no one to love
Grab your cash
Live frivolous, run for the dash, live for now, don't live for the past Rule the world
Live for self and remember the quote because this world ain't offering hope
Live your life
The world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos, the world's full of chaos
