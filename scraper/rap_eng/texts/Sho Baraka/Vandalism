[Chorus: Boogalu]
Sound alarms
Bang the drums
Vandalism
Sound Alarms
Bang the drums
That Kingdom come, come
He on that Vandalism
[x2]

[Verse 1: Boogalu]
Bad kid, mad city
Mad scenes of the baddest things
Human beings think, say and do
They are etched in my mind
Like the memories of vets
Meetings villains in the vines
This is true
It's Vietnam in the cities
That we knew, 'fore the rich came
Through
But the heart speaks too
It's proof text for the brokenness
No matter what the context
You know we all vexed by a curse come
True
Speak, watch your vandalism spew from
Your checks
Like decay on the project hall walls, full
View
Depraved heart caves
Overpass concaves
City grim on our plates
Name plates, Never true
'Til we come true
All cakes when we All come straight
Never clean, all shame
Drip, Drip on the I.D
Filthy from the game
Life stains
Some got our finger prints
Others got names
All the same
Broken works of art
Searching for a new Descartes
Brushed with a cross
Who'd thought?
Art

[Chorus: Boogalu]

[Bridge: Sho Baraka]
He is always on that vandalism
Broken things, Master in them
Mastering the rebel with the rebel in
Them
Mastering their new creation
Ugly into beautiful
Reverse vandalism

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
A Paintbrush and a canvas please
I'm a piece of the master's work the master staring back at me
I told y'all I was Rembrandt with a Fedora cap
Ernie Barnes with the rhymes I'm just painting y'all good times
Harlem reborn Zora Neal or Langston
Bring culture to the culture somebody better thank him
Vultures they say my abstract is wack
Its tasteless vandalism for our side of the tracks
But I'm obnoxious redeemed and unavoidable
High Art for the lesser some say its so enjoyable
I'm conscious that the pompous will call it it nonsense
Simon the Sorcerer, They profiting of the Prophet
Fling paint, play with colors they caint
Paintbrush steps back to see what the Lord makes
History packaged within the form of poetry
Verses get the rewind that's the signature that you know it's me
And now we see
The majesty of Christ taking vandalism and making it a master piece

[Chorus: Boogalu]
