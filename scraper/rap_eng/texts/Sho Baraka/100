Verse 1
What I look like caring if the world don’t feel us
I serve a God who died harder than Bruce Willis
Man’s born sick and he just gets ill’er
In our optimistic prime he could transform a killer
He could transform a dealer, ask Json
We were all born sinners ask my mom
My nature’s no better than Judas and that’s the truth
Without the Spirit I’m an arrogant adulterous dude
So I keep accountability until I get old
Tedashii said, “Bring the heat cuz the world’s so cold!”
I gotta live 100 so my feet don’t slip
I gotta live like Jacob more holy less hip
By his grace Sho Baraka gone spit the real
Been doing that Reach life before I got the deal
Called to make mini-me's til the day that I die
So on my tombstone say, “he didn’t die he multipled"

Hook
I gotta keep it (100)
My men keep it (100)
My ladies keep it (100)
We gotta keep it (100)

Verse 2
Back in the year of the 2 triple O
This random thug tried to strong arm the Sho
Me and my boys on the corner just sharing our faith
This cat staring at us like he got something to say
He began to size us up acting tough talking loud
I tried to ignore him but this fool attracted a crowd
I expected some resistance but this ain't what I wanted
I had 99 problems this made 100
He looked me in the face and said if you love that Christ
You’ll have no problem with me sending you to see him tonight
I’m thinking option number one is we can turn the other cheek
Number 2 is we can stomp his loud mouth in the street
But that’s what they want to see us fail when they test us
Talk a good game but then crack under pressure
So I prayed to GOD, if I gotta take this L
I hope out of this you would get your glory as well
So this cat stared at us for a second or two
Jumped at us and smirked like I’m playing with you
We had to represent the Lord even though they were stuntin
No matter what they do we gotta keep it 100

Hook

They move their lips but their words mean nothing
They think God got their back but them boys just frontin
They talk loud but we can drown out the sickest boys
We like Chicago, willing to make the iller noise
They want toys, fame, wealth and health
Everything good without being good themselves
They want things (Yes they do) but its Jesus they better get
Cuz hell’s their life sentence like a subject and a predicate
Sometimes I see the wicked and I lust for their things
But then I see the Lord and I trust in the King
Hung on the cross for hours while still in his prime
We don’t call him heir for nothing he showing us hang time
He is holy, he is perfect, he is God
God is like three in one, its so odd
Because of all this your boy gotta keep running
99 won't do it gotta keep it 100

Hook
