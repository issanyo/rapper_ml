Inner man right, outer man fresh
The boys got swag, we ain't too impressed
Friends come and go but real men gon' last
We been fresh but we the folks who still got class

We got class, let them boys have swag (Denzel) [x3]
We got class, we got class

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Yo I am chillin' Suzy Rock chillin'
Tryin to be a Godly example for these children
While I'm here I'd like to thank
My pops who taught me faith before he passed away
Can we get a round of applause for gentlemen please
Trying to put an end to swag cuz we are G's
To my father's on they homework cuz class don't end
And other words to some lazy and passive men
To my wife mi amore Sade on Pandora
Mumblin' the verse cuz I only know the chorus
Civil rights defender got service on the agenda
Step outside feelin' like a day for suspenders

[Hook]
Inner man right, outer man fresh
The boys got swag, we ain't too impressed

We been fresh but we the folks who still got class

We got class let them boys have swag (Denzel) [x3]
We got class, we got class

[Sho Baraka]
Hands in the air if you like them girls who ain't on TV
Cuz they got mo class than the models

[Verse 2: Suzy Rock]
Shout out to the smart girls in college starvin' artists and
Bible freaks what ever they wanna call us
We got class that you can't cash and got a ring that you can't smash
Please fools don't ask
I'm on a mission to be a mogul business is mobile
And I got unlimited texts and sendin' His message global
Makin' Ô¨Åshers of men - check my net worth
Baby I'm talkin' riches 'til ya neck hurt
And I ain't talkin' red bottoms I ain't talkin' bags
I'm talkin' pure hearted inner beauty got class
I'm talkin' modesty honestly she still bad
Cuz she don't think she's sexy cuz she showin' her ass...
Ask me no questions I tell you no lies
I'm just givin' you life, you can like it or not

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Okay havin' class is that one night stand
That took place after that bride and groom dance
He put a ring on it, go and get intimate
Yeah, Songs of Solomon and no censorship
Young boys be saggin' in the mall
How they supposed to be winnin' all I see is they drawers?
I'm in that grateful apparel that bear fruit logo
Yeah you gettin' schooled but I'm still in my play clothes
Svelte already but not yet support a cause and stay fresh
All with the same check
Ah, my society where everything is high
Where class will survive and swag goes to die
