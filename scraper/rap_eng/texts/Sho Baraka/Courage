[Hook: Sho Baraka & Derek Minor]
I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm a truth carrier, barbarian
Hands to the plow how they bury me no fear in me
Years ago, I be up in a dim lit hole screaming, Woah!
As the reefer blow and the liquor pour
On a line of white unafraid to fight stand proud
For a crowd of the devil's children talking loud
Then Pow! the Spirit gave birth to a child
Now you don't know me and you don't know my style
Courageous as I make the sacrifice live selfless
Follow Christ through the dark valley where the death is
Reject sin kill the lion stomp around Jericho
Ram's horn blow, serpent's head crush death blow


[Hook: Sho Baraka & Derek Minor]
I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
They want me under that system hunting that
Good life, hood life just like all them other cats
They want me scared man I'm gonna snap
They want me following a lot of them but I ain't hearing of none of that
Running back, look I ain't gotta follow fools
And I ain't gotta follow crews that don't like to follow rules
Ain't gotta try to follow all them hundred dollar dudes
Naw, bruh that ain't my motto and I know I gotta choose
They tell me to rebel and well I ain't enthused
By opposing my creator cause I know that I would lose
Just cause I'm a dude don't mean I need Glocks
I think they got the flu cause they think they need shots
We stop tryna chase them we much rather know Him
We can't see the sun (Son) then a storm finna blow in
We tryna be courageous, let His word soak in
We got that free admission we bout to go in

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Derek Minor]
I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
All creation will be shaken and hearts will be racing
They'll be waiting for the judge and His opening statement
They show courage in the wrong ways
Before I move to Atlanta I knew some real braves
These cowards run the world, I guess they legs are tired
So now they sit in the throne that the Lord desired
We trust in our hero that's how we know we're saved
Yeah, He even gives us strength on our weak days
It's a zoo out there, cheetahs driving Jaguars
And most rappers are animals, lyin' in bars
They claim they run the game, they got that money mayne
But my value's eternal I got forever change
I tried not to judge I was defended once
Until I got booked and saw what the sentence was
I find courage in the Spirit in our God alone
I'm not scared of Mick Jagger's rolling with stones

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Derek Minor]
I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in
