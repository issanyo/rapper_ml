Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Yeah, I live a nightmare that I can't escape (huh)
Rape, crime, and hate over 808s
Hello new year, we can be a resolution
We bring solutions, they only spit pollution

Radio filled with intoxication
Also plots of assassination
I found out it's exaggeration
It's the same thing on every station

My favorite artist now sounds like
An average rapper that sound bites
He would rap about real life
But since he left he don't sound right

Slow down, yeah

They give a trophy to the loudest coward
He ain't the wisest in the room, he just talks the loudest
Me and my radio got real beef
I promise baby, that sucker tried to kill me

[Chorus]
Radio killing me
DJ killing me
I was in love with you girl but now you're killing me
Copycats killing me
Industry killing me
Girl you keep playing the same stuff, you killing me

Say we want change
We want change
And we ain't going 'til we get it
Going 'til we get it
Say We want change
We want change
And we ain't going 'til we get it
Going 'til we get it

[Verse]
I went to a party the other day
I heard a call from the other way
This dude I went to school with
I always run so cool with
Now he's rapping that foolishness
He like "now come on Sho, that ain't who I is
I write those lines just to feed my kids."
He get pimped by the music biz
In other words, he just kills to live
Hit that dude with an awkward silence
Once was a smart kid, graduated college
Nerd in school, now selling us violence
He acts sad now, like it's really so [?]
But he'll never change cause his bank account enjoys it
And now I'm a hater cause I disapprove of poison
He's socially responsible for his ignorant choices
He's not commentating on the game, he's cheerleading
While he lives off blood money, our backs still bleeding

[Chorus]
Radio killing me
DJ killing me
I was in love with you girl but now you're killing me
Copycats killing me
Industry killing me
Girl you keep playing the same stuff, you killing me

Say we want change
We want change
And we ain't going 'til we get it
Going 'til we get it
Say We want change
We want change
And we ain't going 'til we get it
Going 'til we get it

[Hook]
Lies on the radio, radio
Lies on the video, video
Lies everywhere I go, where I go
They keep selling me
They keep selling me
They keep selling me
They keep selling me

Lies on the radio, radio
Lies on the video, video
Lies everywhere I go, where I go
They keep selling me
They keep selling me
They keep selling me
They keep selling me

Lies
