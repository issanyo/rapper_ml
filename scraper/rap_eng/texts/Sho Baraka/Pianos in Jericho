[Intro: Sho Baraka]
We march around
Lord, will these walls fall down?

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Is God sufficient? Is God my mistress?
Is God a magician to fulfill my mission?
What's my intentions? Am I defensive?
When I hear his laws, am I dismissive?
Is he a lobbyist for my ambitions like a politician?
Is he my missile, my righteous pistol?
Will I aim to hit you when I got some issues and things become uncivil?
Did we invent you? Do we believe when it's not beneficial?
Do we let the wall eclipse you? Do we dismiss you?
Sophisticated fools trust the Lord or trust His tools
A paralyzed man with no rush to touch the pool
Do we want healing? What kind of God would ask me that?
Maybe because we find pride in our afflictions and handicaps
Man, I think I've let my problems become my savior
I've taken focus off the Lord and focused on my anger
I think I've let my opposition define who's my neighbor
Are we changing the wall or did the wall change us?

[Hook: Sean C. Johnson]
I walk around the walls of Jericho
Hoping they fall, hoping they fall
I walk around walls of Jericho
I got problems to solve, problems to solve
I walk around the walls of Jericho
Hoping they fall, hoping they fall
I walk around the walls of Jericho
Lord, please hear my call, please hear my call

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
If I die destroying a wall, make sure you dance at my funeral
I'm going to a place that's more beautiful
No grave can hold me down for my soul
Do not weep for I do not live in that tomb, that ain't me!
Fight against the systems and evil Illuminati
But never fight the Illuminati in my own body
We pray for victory and want God to intervene
But we don't expect that our enemy is praying the same thing
But who's my enemy? Are they God's imagery?
When we believe differently, do they deserve dignity?
The walls fell for my grandma, too many blessing to count 'em
She got to see an Obama, the integration of fountains
The wall fell for my brother fighting against addiction
Found a new conviction, he heard the Lord and he listened
The wall fell down for me, doubt and idolatry
Never believing what's wrong with this world was really me

[Hook: Sean C. Johnson]
I walk around the walls of Jericho
Hoping they fall, hoping they fall
I walk around the walls of Jericho
I got problems to solve, problems to solve
I walk around the walls of Jericho
Hoping they fall, hoping they fall
I walk around the walls of Jericho
Lord, please hear my call, please hear my call
