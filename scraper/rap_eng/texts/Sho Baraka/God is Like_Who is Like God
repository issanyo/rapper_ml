PART 1: GOD IS LIKE

(Verse: Sho Baraka)
(GOD is like)
Perfect in all his ways, you come broke and he'll fix you today
(GOD is like)
The peace in the midst of the storm
You're going crazy he'll give you a calm
(GOD is like)
The man who says that gain is lost
But man would say that this is totally false
False like the way we merchandise his act on the cross
Cause man waters it down and exploits it for cost
(GOD is like)
Sovereign and majestic king
Ask Kirk he's the reason why I sing
(GOD is like)
He who make Pharaoh a mighty man
Then humbles him just to show that he can
(GOD is like)
A loving father who extends love
To a man who just mutilated and killed his son
(GOD is like)
Forgiver, protector, light , mighty, way ,truth , the life
(GOD is like)
Sweet like cinnamon
Something like a lifeguard cause He really can save a man
(GOD is like)
Not like, he is love he's no like us
Who is like GOD, who can we trust....

PART 2: WHO IS LIKE GOD
Verse 1
Sho
He's the foundation layer architect of the earth
Determined my end but he predestined me first
Perfect fellowship with man then man got the curse
But then he gave himself he prepared for the worse
He's got a monopoly in his line of work
Who else you know can make a grown man from the dirt
Be careful what you say cuz the saints stay packing
66 bullets 2 clips in 1 cannon
We track stars on his team and Jesus is the captain
He put us in a race so we run like what's happening
He got mansions all in the sky, He ain't lonely
He don't need no earthly shack, he ain't Kobe
He's the real Ace in the deck the rest phony
These other jokers just want to jack the king homie
Who is like our GOD he's just so holy
Mom said put Him first but I make Him one and only

Sermon Excerpt by James Roberson III

(Verse 2:Cheeks)
Who is like the Son you? You can test if you want
But the odds of finding one are like infinite to none
Trying to measure up to God, We all impotent and dumb
He rejects the strong and proud and lifts up the humble ones
So how I sound braggin' like I'm the best
No Christ in my life At best I'm powerless
When it comes to Yeshua, (Yup!) I'm impressed
Cause He rose like the Phoenix Got up and conquered death He's the real King Pin He alone holds the throne
Exercising perfect Justice In a League of His own
He's the heavyweight champ And still undefeated
Quit searching for weakness Ain't nobody like Jesus
Stretched His arms like elastic to save us from the casket Forget Reed Richards, Elyon is Fantastic
He Flames On like John Storm Swings the hammer like Thor
My Hero's El-Gibor Cause ain't nobody like the Lord

Sermon Excerpt by Joe Surkamer

(Verse 3: AmEn AnOiNtEd)
(Let me set the record straight)
I'm asking can you fathom this trinitarian tandem
Or imagine the thousands of atoms it took to make Adam
Who is like GOD cause HE HIMSELF is high
We try to do it but AH! were left with me, myself and I
Please believe HE'S on the throne while we do it to death
I'm relieved HE'S number one cause number two is a mess Queen or Bishop it's best I get this mess off my chest
We're Rooks and Pawns next to the KING plus HE'S got us in check
(If I ruled the world) you can stop trying
You're Hov you're the sovereign ruler, man stop lying
How you use the name "Hova" and don't know who the KING be
HE says walk this way and HE runs the emcee
HE'S the KING and ROCK there is none higher
Forget the bling and the block or burn in the lake of fire
(JESUS) the only known to wake go and fold HIS grave clothes went and told displayed HIS holes then raise like case closed!
