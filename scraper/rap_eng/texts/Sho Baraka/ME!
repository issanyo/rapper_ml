[Hook: Lee Green]
I done fought a lot of pain and addiction
I done shown a lot of help and intervention
Don't look at me like I'm bad, I just need a little rehab
I done seen the devil's tricks in the night yeah
But I'm tryin' to hold onto the light yeah
Don't look at me like I'm bad, I just need a little rehab
Oh, rehab, rehab, yes Lord rehab, oh rehab

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Hello everyone I'm a me-aholic
I've been sober since about uhh... 9 this mornin'
I know the Lord sees my greed it's so appalling
I spent my phone money on clothes so I missed my callin'
But my extended adolescence is so stylish
I want Play-Doh, I'm so childish
Sometimes I serve to get an applause
But when they stop the applause I'mma stop serving y'all
My sexual past just brings more scars
I'm tryin' not to compare my wife to porn stars
Cuz unchecked lust can be a cruel thing
I struck out serving my love too many mood swings
I know Jesus the holy and true King
I'm too busy tryin' to make him a cool thing
Uhh... am I sharin' too much?
Will my openness lead another brother to lust?
I know that my accountability sucks
It's huntin' season for that lust, tell this brother to duck
Doubt whispers in my head that God ain't real
My flesh just wants an excuse to do what it feels
So guys I just need a little help (little help)
I'm a little tired of worshippin' myself (self)
I know these words may seem strange (seem strange)
But I came here lookin' for some change

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Theory Hazit]
Hello everyone I'm a me-aholic
Just Ô¨Ånished the dirty deed like Alicia Keys I'm fallin'
And I ain't tryin' to have nobody stumbling and fallin'
From umm... fill in the blank and thank God nobody saw it
Man I promise I'm so self-conscious
Should I spit it conscious or should I preach the gospel
Would I lose my fans would my next one drop
I wonder if the underground gon' accept me or not
My appearance is everything, I rock a pair of cool J's
I'm tryin' to lose weight and get buff like Cool-J
And I gotta get that scrill to secure all my feelin's
Pay all my bills and spoil all my children
That ain't enough, I need money left over
I'm sick of hand-me-downs and eatin' on leftovers
Man I hate rejection and I lust for your approval
If I confess my sins the church may consider removal
So guys I just need a little help
I'm a little tired of worshippin' myself
I know these words might seem strange
But I came here lookin' for some change (well alright)

[Hook]
