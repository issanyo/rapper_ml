[Hook]
Rich man lies and he rises
Poor man lies and he dies
We do it all for the money
All for the money
All for the money, for the money money money
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us

[Verse 1]
We tryin' to bloom in the city lights
I think we ask what's up cuz we're scared of heights
Poor man saw his rose die when he lied
Rich man lies, he saw his rose rise
Greed begets more greed
Hood rats love the trap that brings more cheese
We get the world but want more Adam and Eve
I got so much to hide but I need more leaves
The same person addicted to caffeine
Likes to look down at the person who does smoke weed
The war on drugs is the war on us, import make money then lock 'em up
I said doctor can you ﬁx my ills
He thinks ﬁxin' my ills is givin' me more pills (please)
That means I get more bills, poor man can only leave tears in his will

[Hook]
Rich man lies and he rises
Poor man lies and he dies
We do it all for the money
All for the money
All for the money, for the money money money
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us

[Verse 2]
Get ya hand out my pocket, get ya hand out my pocket
Out my pocket don't ride me no mo
Would less welfare make the poor care and work hard, I really don't know
I know a girl who makes a grip, all she gotta do is strip
She makes about 3 G's maybe 4
I tried to tell her to quit, she's like what's better than this?
Go to college and pay school loans?
Well let me teach you about some ghetto wrath
Baby momma's gettin' beat but still comin' back
School of hard knocks is where she learned to add
3 jobs for 2 kids that's some ghetto math
Rich man can he get a dollar please
Life feels wasted so his pants at his knees
We've all got bad aim in the darkness
How can I reach my goal instead of being a target?

[Hook (x2)]
Rich man lies and he rises
Poor man lies and he dies
We do it all for the money
All for the money
All for the money, for the money money money
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us

[Verse 3]
She said, he said alright I ain't pointin' ﬁngers...
This is what he said
He said...
I know civility died last week when I couldn't get my kids food to eat
And if opportunity knocks on my door I'm lockin' him in the basement, haha
I see fools gold wearin' fools
Accumulate that gold young man hide it in your mouth
On your neck in your hair on your wrist
Cuz of course that's where it's most proﬁtable
And when your gold... I'm sorry... God begins to wear you down
Appraise your heart and character to see his real glory
We all international player, I just go to learn
Souls of men last forever but money will burn
Thanks for the invite to your melting pot
I feel like I'm the only one that's melting a lot
Your hospitality is a manifest destiny
And the welcome mat is soaking wet, it's from the years of tears
I don't seek resolution of pain amongst the privileged
They tried to break me but all they created was more soul
More strength, watch me dance, watch me dance
I will dance on your bureaucracy
I will dance cuz all I've ever had was a jig, ha
And if you're confused, I'm talkin' to you
