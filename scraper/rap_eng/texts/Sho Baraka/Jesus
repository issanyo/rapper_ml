[Verse 1: Sho Baraka}
What's the debate?
He died and he rose from the grave
Something like control+s yeah his word does save
Clear image of the Father something like blu ray
A name that ruled the Middies longer than Hussein
I heard freedom from bondage
I'm like "Who's payin'?" "The man from Nazareth"
And I'm like "You playin'!"
Nothing good comes from there, that's what I heard
But the Son came from Heaven and I'm like, "That's swerve!"
Then became flesh and walked among us
Who cares for the hairs on my head, thirst and my hunger
So I feed off the Word, not bread alone
He even delivered on the Sabbath like Karl Malone
So what's the Jazz all about? He's on the throne
He's the defense for His children, yeah He's in the zone
The prince of the Earth may have his purple reign
But the doves will cry out for the one matchless Name of

Jesus (3x) (You sent the Son - for the sinner)
We give honor to the One who sent
Jesus (3x) (You sent the Son - for the sinner)
Give honor to the One who sent

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
You ain't gotta hit New Orleans to see Saints runnin'
I'm not talkin' Bush - hard to see the streets flooded
We're brothers who walk through the storms of life and stay covered
But God will go hard like Paul and stay buzzin' (Hornets)
Boy was opposed to the blood, ask my cousins
But then I got a blood transfusion so now I love Him
I had my own bail-out
Your boy had a custom of not believin' in the savin's but now I trust Him
Walking by faith not by sight with my dawgs
Something like Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles
I've been called in the game so now I ball
Crazy I give the Gospel to toys and Barbie dolls
If it's breathin' it needs Jesus
Whether it's black, white, brown, it's pagan or even heathen
Gene, Kareem or my cousin Steven
Who thinks he ain't got beef with God just because he's a vegan

[Hook]
Jesus (3x) (Yes You are, yes you are)
We give honor to the One He sent
Jesus (3x) (Yes You are, yes you are)
Give honor to the One He sent

[Verse 3: Alex Faith]
Christ Jesus: Fully man, fully deity
Sinning in the dark, but I know He's fully seeing me
Freedom from Christ so I killed the pharisee in me
Facing all my giants I'm a smooth stone infantry
But static, the God-man, He was sent to be the satisfaction for God's wrath
He was bruised for me, now I see it
The crucifixion got me choked up
I was front row, Shai Linne, I was there
He was crushed by His father for His glory and the good of the nations
We call it imputation, or expiation
But he called it finished left the stone bench and rose up
Rolled away the stone you can say that he woke up
Christ treated death like a temporary injury
So I hate the fact that men persist in tyranny
Daily flesh massacre and indwelling-killing spree
Made in God's image we're not meant to dwell in enmity
That's why He sent Jesus, frees us from sin
That's why He sent the Spirit to apply the work within because He's
