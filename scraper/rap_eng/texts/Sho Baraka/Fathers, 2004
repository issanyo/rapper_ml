[Chorus]
I'm a lover, a provider
I'm a teacher, I'm a fighter
I know there's grace for me even when I'm wrong
Through all my indiscretions and all my imperfections I'm a love you till the day that I'm gone
How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E
How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E

[Verse 1]
Son in the land of the passive make sure that you man up
When introduced to a lady its always proper to stand up
Never talk behind the back of someone you're not a fan of
Know when the cops approach you, you might have to put your hands up
Respect all people and show honor to the king
No matter what they think the Lord created all human beings
Be critical, but never partner with defiance
Be happy with who you are all alone in the silence
Pray without ceasing, but keep your eyes on the system
Always speak up for the weak until somebody listens
Don't marry her if you don't plan to bury her
If you sweep her off her feet then learn how to carry her

[Bridge 1]
Through thick and thin you know we gon hold it down
Through good or bad you know we gon stick around

[Chorus]
How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E
How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E

[Verse 2]
Baby girl make sure your kings a better man than me
You better believe I know that may be hard to achieve
You're beautiful, I will always remind you
Never let the culture's idea of beauty define you
Baby girl don't be easily impressed
Stay clothed in righteousness cause it's harder to undress
I'm tryna raise the next Lena Horne
Fannie Lou Hamer a lady who can bring reform
Be wise and strong
Don't be a side chick for the ride along
Always be humble whether right or wrong
And know I'll be here when your friends are gone
When your friends are gone

[Bridge 2]
If you want love, get love
If you need love, spread love

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I got new goals its family business I handle now
The kind of stuff that brothers over thirty be bragging 'bout
Tell my son that he's more than some target practice
Tell my daughter that she's more than an extension to a mattress
Never reach a goal by pulling others down
Royalty is much more than a throne and a crown
Your knees should be hurt from praying with your people
Your shirt'll be wet from crying over evil
I learned that love ain't based on performance
Make a mistake and I will love you in the morning
I see life in my children's eyes
And when I'm wrong I'll be the first to apologize
Peace to all my fathers who are working through their flaws
Fulfilling their duties and they don't do it for applause
It's true, any fool with a tool can reproduce
But a father is that dude that'll see it through
Forget the stereotypes lets be clear
There are good men out there we are here

[Bridge]
Through thick and thin you know we gon hold it down
Through good or bad you know we gon stick around

[Chorus]
How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E
How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E
How do you spell dad?
M-E- (x2)
