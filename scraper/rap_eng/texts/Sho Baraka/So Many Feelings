[Intro]
So many feelings
What do you mean what do I mean?
So many feelings
We've talked about this before. You hurt my feelings
Oh really? Alright...

[Hook]
(So many feelings)
All up in 'em, caught up in 'em
I live in 'em, you don't get 'em
(So many feelings)
I do not want you to fix it, but I just want you to listen
Yeah, I just want you to listen

[Verse 1: Vanessa Hill]
We keep crossing the signals and crossing the wires
And now I just wanna leave
You feel disrespected, I won't let you protect me from all other crazy things
I do not want you to fix it, no, but I just want you to listen
Yeah, I just want you to listen

[Hook]
(So many feelings)
All up in 'em, caught up in 'em
I live in 'em, you don't get 'em
(So many feelings)
All up in 'em, caught up in 'em
I live in 'em, you don't get 'em

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
I think you think I can mind read (for real)
And I think you ignore my needs
And you speak of hurt as if I try to plan it
I think we living on different planets
I say something, you get offended (seriously)
You say "Damn Cliff, you never listen!"
So then I shut up and you shut down
And I'm just like "yo, what I do now?"
Here lies grave that we dance around
Our fight played out with no sound
We argue so much, it's like we love it
Yesterday it was sex, today about the budget
Now listen I'm cool, drop the subject
I'm three seconds way from just saying f--k it
I must admit sometimes I wanna quit
Cause I feel like my feelings don't mean shit
We pray, we talk about faith
But why you never seem to show me grace?
You step on my toes and keep on dancing
Then you wonder why I'm not romantic
Tragedy up on your majesty
We been fighting each other since Adam and Eve
You got the murder weapon but you claim your hands are clean
You wanna talk it out but I need my space to breathe
How's my soul, you'll never know
We make grave mistakes, dig more holes
In the backyard, try to hide the bones
We know skeletons will never grow
Fool ourselves hiding our dead bodies
Murder murder murder just seems to be the hobby
Cool, shots fired, you got me
A house full of death but we act so godly

[Hook]
(So many feelings)
All up in 'em, caught up in 'em
I live in 'em, you don't get 'em
(So many feelings)
All up in 'em, caught up in 'em
I live in 'em, you don't get 'em
