[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay
Another day in this world system, still tripping
I don't expect anything different
They save whales, save dogs, save dolphins
Save trees, but kids ain't really that important
See signs of a genocide, yeah, keep silent
But for some land and oil we get violent
All I hear is less faith, more science
If it feels good to you then try it
The sex addicted make kids porn victims
Bloods shed blood, crips set tripping
Young girls watch videos, they live reckless
Give up their virginity, all for a necklace
My man was driven, he was sitting on wisdom
But he traded that in for some rims that spinning
He got 26s but his rent he can't pay
So he's like oh well its still a good day

[Hook]
Oh well, it's still a good day
So they say oh well, it's still a good day
Oh well, it's still a good day
So they say oh well, it's still a good day
No no no no, it's still a good day
No no no no, it's still a good day
No no no no, it's still a good day
No no no no, it's still a good day

[Verse 2]
I saw an old friend, that I meet back in school
We wasted our lives, we was way to cool
He told me his story, then I shared mine
Come to find out he ain't changed much since the '99
He's one of those 'if' brothers you've met before
If I had this or if I wasn't poor
If I had money I'd open a store
If that brother cared at all he would probably have more
All the money he wants can't buy joy
Dollar bills don't make men out of boys
Money can't buy him love but it buys strippers
If it can't fix his wrong it buys liquor
I might become one old man with a bad liver
But I've been drinking for years and I hate quitters
My pop sold drugs, momma was an alchy
When I got old I'm pretty sure I know what I'll be
An aimless soul, struggling to cope
Government selling us hope but giving us rope
To hang ourselves so I die a little everyday
But he's like oh well it's still a good day

[Hook]
Oh well, it's still a good day
So they say oh well, it's still a good day
Oh well, it's still a good day
So they say oh well, it's still a good day
No no no no, it's still a good day
No no no no, it's still a good day
No no no no, it's still a good day
No no no no, it's still a good day

[Verse 3]
I'm far from perfect so I know the Lord's worth
Even on holiday you know the Lord works
Outside of Christmas I'll rap in his name
Jokers mad at me, I don't this for the fame
I will not sell my soul trying to make it in the game
Most of these rappers' content stay lame
There's good rappers but our music's not the same
They rap for the dollars I rap for the change
I don't do this for the selfish gain homie
He went autotune when he took the T-pain homie
Pull over you in the wrong lane homie
I swear it read HOV only
I ain't talking about the rock, I'm talking about the rock
Watch that sky drop, and you can get it bro
I guess what I'm trying to say is
Oh well, it's not a good day
