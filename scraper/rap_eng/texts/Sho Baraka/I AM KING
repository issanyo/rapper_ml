[Intro - Reflect]
Yeah
I brought the kings with me on this one
It's a movement

[Verse 1 - Reflect]
I had a dream
I saw black slaves of 2018
Pullin' to be king
With a crown in the middle
Lookin' like tug-of-war
I guess they forgot the inheritance of the Lord
Dyin' over streets when God gave 'em the Earth
It's all in the Bible, just do your research
"White man's religion" â€” That's just fake news
The cross [saved?] Africa, for Europe, even you
This ain't black vs. white, this is dark vs. light
But racism might distract you from the Christ on site
So here's the Visine, me and my team
Dark brown but we're flippin' on the high beams (KING!)
"K" is for the knowledge
"I" is to inspire
"N" for the nurture
The "G" is to grow higher
Jesus lit the match, so we all on fire
You see a crown and the attire, you know you lookin' at a fighter

[Hook - Richie Righteous]
My people
My people
We're ready to mount up like an eagle
Stand and fight against evil
A system rigged and deceitful
KING! You can hear it when I rhyme, I'm a
KING! Renewed in my mind, I'm a
KING! I got a different bloodline, I'm a
KING! Yeah yeah I am a
KING!

[Verse 2 - Sho Baraka]
I am a king all day, Mansa Musa
How we got the fruit of the Spirit when the land produced us?
Seed of Abraham now planted in good soil
Anointed with the oil, the Father now calls us royal
Tell me, what's a king without wisdom and purity?
Face your insecurities, that's what we call maturity (yeah)
The Father is with us to go be his witness, to model his business
Forgive us when we don't honor our sisters
The great transition is him takin' us from boys to men
Go check my resume, homie, we all linked in
And we network with the fam all across the continent
Boastin' in our righteousness more than our accomplishments
But we stand confident all up in that grace
Even with the enemy all up in my face
When one man falls down, there's two to pick him up
A three-cord bond, it's hard to break us up

[Hook - Richie Righteous]
My people
My people
We're ready to mount up like an eagle
Stand and fight against evil
A system rigged and deceitful
KING! You can hear it when I rhyme, I'm a
KING! Renewed in my mind, I'm a
KING! I got a different bloodline, I'm a
KING! Yeah yeah I am a
KING!

[Verse 3 - Eshon Burgundy]
(Yo)
(I'm a lawyer)
(Salute)
Neighborhood, royal priesthood, I'm hood, nevertheless
My ancestors died serving, they good, nevertheless
Every slave that died as a child of God
Went to Heaven in the sky
Persecuted, what better way to arrive?
Carryin' their train, runnin' to the groom, liftin' up the veil
Most of them slavemasters caught a H-E-Double-L
This crown is not physical, but you know it's there
Like you can not see oxygen but feel it in the air
Yeshua, blood ruler, gave me God's image
Born again, divine is my umbilical cord, I'm [offin' it?]
I'm not a king 'cause of the color of my face
I'm king 'cause I'm from the bloodline of David by God's grace
There's no Jew or Gentile in this wild kingdom
Just lions who invited to [iron?] but we gon' triumph
I finally understand how to be a man
These drug addict rappers can't teach me the father's plan
And them Klan members gon' all fall into God's hands
Hebrews 10:31, his kingdom come
