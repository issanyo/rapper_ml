[Intro]
Extinction: The dying out, or termination of a race or species. Extinction occurs when a species can no longer reproduce at replacement level. Most extinctions are thought to have resulted from environmental changes that affected the species in either of two ways. The doomed species might not have been able to adapt to the changed environment and thus perished without descendants or it may have adapted but in the process may have evolved into a distinctly new species

What caused the death of the mighty lion?
I don't hear him roar, whats the reason for?
What caused the death of the mighty lion?
Once he hits the floor, there will be no more

What caused the death?

[Verse 1]
The Lion's dying and he trying to graps for the air
It's no longer there, and it seems like no body cares
He fumbles and stumbles he tripping he up and he down
It's a miracle if he doesn't return to the ground
I think he's hit a bump, from my view he is possibly stuck
They won't help him up so it seems like he's lost their trust
The harvest will come, by then he'll return to the dust
Some are pleased with his death, that just spells misfortune for us
The one hope for the world is now dead and he's gone
We've made a few clones, but none with a roar that'll frighten your bones
He's wearing a muzzle, no longer the king of the jungle
The cowards have killed him; they've taken away his roar and his rumble
They're few that will cry with fear that extinction will rise
Apart from their pride they just want to lay down and die
We cheered for his death, if the world wasn't darkened enough
We got what we want so I guess this is just a caution to us

[Verse 2]
Extinction, or fleeing, receiving the taming procedure
Rapid decreasing, disguise pretend to be zebras
What you believe in, or tell me your reason for breathing
Bowing with Caesar, or is it allegiance to Jesus?
Where's my fighters who are ready to oppose the liars?
Not afraid to shun evil, a passion for people
They put us in cages and hope that will scares us or change us
We cause them danger, they have to respond back with anger
The shooting of Luther, the shooting of Kennedy
If your roar's too loud there's a remedy for your enemies
There's a problem we tend to be afraid to be brave
I'd rather head to the grave than live my life as a slave
I know its easy to say, but it's the words that I pray
If I'm crazy for something, I gotta be all in or nothing
There's a rumor buzzing you can hear the hearts thumping
I guess there's more Lions and a revolutions coming
