[Hook 1: Ali (Sho Baraka)]
I'm tryin' to be great and I'm on my way
Way up, way up, way up
It's never too late and I'm on my way
(I'ma leave my mark, ready set go
Ready set go, ready set go)

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Hello greatness I'm here to greet you
False humility and doubt had me scared to meet you
Fear had me I couldn't sleep I lay awake
Felt like I had to put my dreams up on layaway
That's the thoughts of a kid living on welfare
Section 8 monthly food stamps government healthcare
Depressed hopin' adulthood would suck less
From our house we had a poor view of success
Let it be told all that glitters ain't gold
Life is a slam dunk when you livin' with low goals
Pick and roll with a number of great friends
Some want you to be great but not greater than them
Never lust for the top, love it's a long fall
Climbed the ladder of success on the wrong wall
It's by working faith, it's the Lord's grace
Mediocre is contagious, give me some space, space

[Hook 1: Ali]

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Ha, I'm like hold up can I dream?
Everybody's dreaming but not me
Imago Dei His masterpiece is so vivid
You know the architect homeboy we in the buildin'
No ceiling prayers tear the roof off
Talk to God via text you got a new call
Fans will exalt ya, haters wanna stone ya
Man will always fail ya keep ya eyes on Jehovah
I'm sayin' great I'm trying to push my brothers
Talented tenth, that service for the good of others
Some know a lot, say a lot with no application
Success' mistress is procrastination
Greatness is like Bach on the keys, Ali in the ring
Like King havin' a dream
Huh, it's like Mueller on his knees, Tolstoy with a pen
A Messiah without sin

[Hook 2: Ali (Sho Baraka)]
Hello faith, goodbye doubt
I met greatness on my way out
Never give up, never give up, never give up
Hello faith, goodbye doubt
I met greatness on my way out
Never give up, never give up, never give up

[Hook 1]

I'm tryin' to be great and I'm on my way
Way up, way up, way up
It's never too late, I know I'll be great
