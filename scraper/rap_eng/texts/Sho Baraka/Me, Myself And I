Intro
The eyes of man are never satisfied
I want it I want it I gotta have it gotta have it
I'm just talking right now cause I like to hear myself talk
That's part of my issue
I know and I admit it
What's yours?
Verse 1
Yeah. Ok. This is bad, something close tragic/
I'm trying to beat it just like Michael Jackson/
My flesh seeks for satisfaction/
Spirit reigns, titans start clashing/
I got people thinking I'm confused/
But I'm not, well maybe a little what am I to do/
It takes years- for man to build a name/
One selfish moment-turns it all to shame/
I work hard- just for them to envy me/
But in the end I'm not who I pretend to be/
Lord help, this could be the end of me/
What do I do when I sleeping with the enemy/
Yeah he's slick he's smooth/
I don't really trust him with ladies in the room/
He's selfish he's scarred so many lives/
Look in his eyes, can't wait for his demise/
Hook
You're a lie, you're a jerk, you're a creep/
So prideful, arrogant and weak/
Lord help this might be the end of me/
What do I do when I'm sleeping with the enemy/
I run from, run from (Me myself and I)
I love some, love some (Me myself and I)
Run from, run from (Me myself and I) 3x
Verse 2
I can't run I can't hide/
I try to kill him he won't die/
I've studied too much of what the vultures do/
Trying not to reproduce what the culture do/
I'm a grown man I ain't gotta prove I'M COOL/
But first what's the price of those louis shoes/
That would look so nice with some glowing jewels/
Hold up do you see what I be going thru/
Yeah he gives manna for the day/
Contentment on my face , but then I see my neighbors plates/
He got a new job, and a new crib/
Candy painted, cool whip/
Say homie, I don't need it cuz my friends bought it /
Noooo, I'll take it cuz my friends got it/
I know its sad, death by fashion/
Makes sure its brand name when you toe tag him/
Verse 3
Oh my situation is deep/
Always trying to create a person I can't be/
We go in debt just to buy/
Stuff to impress people that we don't like/
I'm at war now, But I mma go home/
Until he touch down we have some field goals/
I gotta clique I gotta team/
Share my weakness, that authentic thing/
Know the Lords grace not my own might/
Man can't have everything in man's sight/
I know Sho and his tendencies/
That joker just might be the end of me/
