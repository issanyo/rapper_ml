[Intro: Sample]

Yeah
Hallelujah, yes Lord
Thank you Jesus

Preach
Been good
Preach
Been good
Yeah, you know he's good

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
I go hammer, I know He was nailed
I know Jesus walks, I'm never going to hell
I know people talk, delete that junk mail
I got my passport stamped overseas, diggin' wells
Tryin' not to lust for them clothes I can't spell
If you don't live behind your bars, you and I don't gel (tell 'em)
Free man now but a slave to my savior
College graduate but I'm still going for majors
Yeah, black belt in a bad way
Judo know? I did what my sensei (preach)
Notorious was my mindset, I got faith - wasn't ready to die yet
(take that take that)
Now take that from a Bad Boy
None of it's mines I'm just playin' with my dad's toys (preach)
I got the church with me, I'm tryin' to be like the Bible not a bad verse in me

[Hook]
And if you know He's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
And if you know He's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
And if you know He's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
Come on praise the Lord, let's praise the Lord

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
This dude said "why you rap off beat?"
I don't rap off beat, the beat is off me
Ha, that's a little joke for 'em
I ain't rappin' for the bread but you could give a toast for 'em (west coast)
How long these clowns gon' wear a mask try to distract us
Halloween is a scary day for the rappers
Get it? Rewind it and start it over
I'm livin' whale I may change my name to Jonah
I got a Hebrew walk, keepin' it kosher
It's hard to be ﬂy when you duckin' the vultures huh (yeah)
How does a prophet and a priest forgive a liar, a fool, a phony and a thief (preach)
Yeah, can a brother get a witness?
Freestyles non proﬁt but he still give 'em the business (hey)
Dinner with death just to show 'em where the mortal is
Watch the sunrise just in time for a mornin' hymn

[Hook]
And if you know he's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
And if you know he's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
And if you know he's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
Come on praise the Lord, let's praise the Lord... talk to 'em Duce

[Verse 3: Duce Banner]
Last year round this time my grandfather died
I thank God every day he got to live a full life
Friends hustle said I had a future not to waste it
Then I got sappy they right, I never woulda made it
Too emotional for thuggin' see that's a handicap
That road would only lead to bein' dead, in jail or handicapped
Last I heard at church he catchin bodies in the street
I'm sure reppin' with perspective by me bodyin' this beat (well)
Grew up a Christian he found me and I repented
But still was Dennis the menace my earnest prayer to be with it
Till one day I said forget it, this ain't real it's a scrimmage
Like Michael Jordan told Pippen I'll leave the game you can win it
Workin' at Target but Target ain't my target
I've been aimin' at my target since this rap thing started I
Treated him like a dog, I had God backwards
Now they mention me on Twitter, I'm back at it...

[Outro]
Ah yeah can we get a praise break?
Ha, can we get a praise break?
We gettin' happy doin' the praise break
We gettin' happy doin' the praise break
And if you love Him like I love Him praise the Lord
And if you know you been good praise the Lord
And with your life and your words just praise the Lord
Come on praise the Lord
Let's praise the Lord
