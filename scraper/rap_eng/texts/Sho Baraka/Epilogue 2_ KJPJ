[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
This is that
This is that, that, that
Protest music I might say stuff
Crazy enough to get a king up
They might get me in a lion's den
Or go ahead and put me in the fire then
Corrupt kings, corrupt queens
Do ugly things with a pretty please
I seen abuse of a king's dream
Slay for the money it's whipped cream
Serve people or serve dollar signs
Grand theft auto or Columbine
Israel and Palestine
The world been crooked
How am I out of line?
And I don't know why we do this
Only the foolish kill Jesus or praise Judas
I see shock in a large crowd
I guess you ain't right cause you shout loud
They celebrate like they did a favor
Free a criminal and kill a savior
[?] I take the blame too
We love ourselves, we rather change you
I'm trying to live like it ain't true
Yeah, you know, like we ain't fools
[?] cause it ain't cool
Nailed to the cross, plus your name's [?]

[Chorus: Ali]
I walk down through the valley
Full of mercy, full of grace
Kill Jesus, praise Judas
I will kill them for the evil
And all their wicked ways
Kill Jesus, praise Judas

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
This is that
This is that, that, that
Protest music I might say stuff
Crazy enough to make change come
The freedom writers may like this
Pick in an Afro with a black fist
Words that decorate a real father
Who love on the queen's daughters
Who blossom the king's flowers
Cause ain't no hoes up in God's garden
And my little one is nightmarin'
Well I guess I'll be a light then
I'll walk with wolves and baboons
There'll be a church up in the wild soon
And the valley of death
Cause ain't much changed since the last I left
Envy asking me to come back
Jealousy wants me to unpack
Lust been talking about she miss me
Death's been dying to kiss me
Greed whispers with the coolness
"I love it when you act like Judas"

[Chorus: Ali]
I walk down through the valley
Full of mercy, full of grace
Kill Jesus, praise Judas
I will kill them for the evil
And all their wicked ways
Kill Jesus, praise Judas

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Ali]
No no no no
No no no no
(Kill Jesus)
No no no no
(Praise Judas)
No no no no

[Sho Baraka]
Yeah, the many mistakes, the multiple apologies
The pride in my heart when the rest didn't acknowledge me
The many times I've opened my mouth
When silence could've been the best route (yup)
We all [?]
One day, it's all gon' burn
They say

[Hook: Sho Baraka & Ali]
No no no no
No no no no
(Kill Jesus)
No no no no
(Praise Judas)
No no no no
(Kill Jesus, praise Judas)
