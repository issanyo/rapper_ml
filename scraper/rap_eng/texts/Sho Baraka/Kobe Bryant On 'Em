(Hook)
Opposition in my face
Tryin' to play defence
I'm bigger than this dude
That don't make no sense
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)

(Verse 1: Sho Baraka)
Opposition in my face
Yeah, I Kobe Bryant on 'em
Body slam my flesh
Andre the Giant on 'em
When life throws you curve balls
Like Nolan Ryan on 'em
Don't give up in the field
Detroit Lions on 'em
When His foes gave Christ the cross
He wasn't dyin' on 'em
He still extends love to those
Who would be lyin' on him
Gotta offer my service
Yeah, your boy's wylin' on 'em
That's why I pack a punch with my lyrics
Yeah, I'm stylin' on 'em
Sin and lust, no laughin' matter
No joke on 'em
That's why I run from temptation
Usain Bolt on 'em
But there I go celebrating before the finish line
I find myself repentin' again for my pride
Got that 4x4 community
Pass the sticks on 'em
I hope I can depend on my dogs
Mike Vick on 'em
I wanna be free from slavery
Kunta Kinte on 'em
And just please the master
Daniel son and Sensei on 'em

(Hook)
Opposition in my face
Tryin' to play defence
I'm bigger than this dude
That don't make no sense
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)(x2)

I'm unashamed of the Gospel
116 on 'em
Chosen to be in His presence
VIP list on 'em
My God's something like Kobe
Crazy and amazin' on 'em
Yours is always hurt
Yeah, Tracy McGrady on 'em
Temptation comes my way
I Cuba Good on 'em
I ain't tryin' to master the green
Tiger Woods on 'em
I'm tryin' to deliver the Word
Bill Gates on 'em
But they worried about themselves
Myspace on 'em
I'm haunted by the truth
That even church goin' youth
Wanna root for the thug
In the thousand dollar suits
Cause he looks fly
And he got a lot a swagger on I'm
But he's gonna die
Yeah, pull out the casket for I'm
Then he stands before the throne
Judge Judy on I'm
Then you'll see your life was mishandled
And unruly on 'em
Then you realize you missed the bus
Criss cross on 'em
And you ain't the biggest boss
Rick Ross on 'em

(Hook)
Opposition in my face
Tryin' to play defence
I'm bigger than this dude
That don't make no sense
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)

Now I'm a bit scared
Cause all my friends
Police was pullin' sirens on 'em
But I got picked from high school
I Kobe Bryant on 'em
Yeah, we talkin' NBA
But I feel more like the NFL
Cause I got that new found love
That's the truth Emmanuel
The lamb hurt for my sins
No longer perp with my friends
No longer work for the ends
Last clerk to leave the gym
Cause the Lord is like the glass
You can always bank on 'im
I like to jump over cain at nights
And straight crank on 'im
I hit the J at the buzzer
End this game of jeopardy
Causin' the world to stay away from me
Like I got leprosy
I used to run with 8
Now I'm runnin' 24
Used to be lukewarm
Now I'm full time for the Lord
To my defense I'm still in that 2-3 zone
Keep it old school like 45s
I roll with dee yon
Give, I know winners do
Romans 13 on 'em
We are the champions
Rock band Queen on 'em

(Hook)
Opposition in my face
Tryin' to play defence
I'm bigger than this dude
That don't make no sense
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
I Kobe Bryant on 'em (eh!)
