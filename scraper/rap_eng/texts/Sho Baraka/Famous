Iiiiiiiii
Just wanna make you famous
Just wanna make you famous

I, I, I began to reach for the stars
Then I saw a star who reached for the cross
Then I saw the crowd they were screaming at the screen
Like crucify the King yeah, the man in between
Crushed bones, blood dripping off his face
Framed on wood now that's a picture of grace
But the sequel comes a couple days later
We saw the father strike the son something like darth vader
Looking for a stunt man who can conquer the fall
Must take hits and must have no flaws
Did his work and time in a coffin then split
I guess that's what you call a real box office hit
Praise God it was Jesus and 12 on the Scene
That would makes his life pg-13
Yeah I get choked up see it
But go buy the book you'll understand when you read it

No glitter no glam but my team still shines bright
Where ever you catch us I hope we flashing the light
Bearing our crosses just to get our passions right
Jim Caviziel on em we want to act like Christ
With every act I want to make em known
For Every crack of with whip for every punch that was thrown
Our Street team is punching the clock
Whether you on Wall Str. or you're hitting the block
On the backstreets building with the fam
But we All n sync looking like a boy band
He's the man plus a hard act to follow
Only way to heaven he's a one way model
The creator of the stars took the low road
Could have been a king could have been a Pharaoh
Yeah he did it make us blameless
So now my only job is to make him famous
