[Intro: Sho Baraka]
Yeah, in the beginning everything was good
Like You are Yeshua
Nothing could restrain us from walking with our Maker
Then we decided to be gods and now we're so dangerous
A creation that was once perfect is now ill
Our eyes are never satisfied, You fulfill
Our appetites seek destruction, You build
Our hands are swift to kill, You heal

[Hook: Sho Baraka]
Yeah I know who I am but who is He?
So it seems He's the Sovereign King
I'm the prodigal on his way home
I'm the prostitute who should've been stoned
Next to You on the cross is a thief
It is me, it is me
I believe but help my unbelief
I believe but help my unbelief

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Despite the corruption, You make beauty in the madness
Every morning Your composition paints a beautiful canvas
Thy words are an author and an architect
There isn't good in this world You haven't offered yet
We get the Savior from a prostitute's offspring
This shows that there's grace in Your offering
I am Adam and Eve I have tasted deceit
Now I cover up my greed in some 100 dollar leaves
I'm a sinner, I'm forgiven, He's risen I'm so down
I'm adopted but His child He's humble I'm so proud
I'm filthy but so clean, guilty but so free
I walk the narrow road but I'm livin' on my knees
He's easy to understand but quite complex
I'm already at His throne but not quite yet
He's cleanin' my heart but I still got mess
I'm runnin' this good race but I still got rest

[Hook: Sho Baraka]
Yeah I know who I am but who is He?
So it seems He's the Sovereign King
I'm the prodigal on his way home
I'm the prostitute who should've been stoned
Next to You on the cross is a thief
It is me, it is me
I believe but help my unbelief
I believe but help my unbelief

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
You're the passover and Priest, Prophet and Sovereign King
New song that we sing the Shepherd and Prince of Peace
You're the Lord over the galaxies, powers and principalities
Head of the family, Savior of all humanity
Perfect Innocent Martyr, Bread and Livin' Water
True image of the father, Lamb led to slaughter
In Genesis we were severed driven from Your presence
In Revelations we'll be baskin' in Your glory and essence
In the beginning light came from the sun and moon
In the new heavens and earth, You're the light that consumes
In the beginning we are promised a lot of pain and fear
In the end You will wipe away every single tear
In the beginning it is promised we all shall die
In the end there's no death and the dead shall rise
In the beginning it is clear creation was duped
In the end You promise You'll make all things new

[Hook: Sho Baraka]
Yeah I know who I am but who is He?
So it seems He's the Sovereign King
I'm the prodigal on his way home
I'm the prostitute who should've been stoned
Next to You on the cross is a thief
It is me, it is me
I believe but help my unbelief
I believe but help my unbelief

[Outro: Diamone]
Help me believe You are who You say You are
You are who You say You are
Oh I love You, oh I love You
Holy father, perfect offering
Living water
How I love You, how I love You
You are who You say You are
Holy father, perfect offering
Living water
