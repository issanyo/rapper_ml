Yes I'm livin' the life
Yes I'm livin' the life
Couldn't live it without you (I can't live without you)
Not without you no no (no!)
Yes I'm livin the life
Yes I'm livin the life
Couldn't live it without you (I can't live without you)
Not without you no no (no!)
Yes I'm livin' the life

I got a first class flight, to where I live
I'm here now, but dead too, like I had a twin
That's the beauty of a paradox
Too like a pair of socks
Hearin' that see in double no Henny shots, shots!
Ain't no liquor in my liver
I just wanna take a picture that this life gives ya
Hope in the King like Coretta
And if it doesn't get betta, I know it will when He comes and get us
Or when we get up yeah, you see I'm done
I know I just left but I was already home
Sittin where the King seat, right there by the throne
And even though I pass away, I am neva gone
So now, I wait on my position, I feel the tension like I'm lifted while I'm waitin' on my pinchin'
Pain cuts deep, with no visible incision but I'm healed as a heal cause I live in that dimension

Yes I'm livin' the life
Yes I'm livin' the life
Couldn't live it without you (I can't live without you)
Not without you no no (no!)
Yes I'm livin the life
Yes I'm livin the life
Couldn't live it without you (I can't live without you)
Not without you no no (no!)
Yes I'm livin' the life

I mean there's got to be more to this world man
It's broken, I've seen it, but not only have I seen it, I've lived it
When you're in a nightmare and dreams seem to have limits
And you scream to heaven but they don't pass the ceiling
What a awkward feeling, you sellin your body with every touch, you're dyin' but you're still making a killin'
You want more then sex and possession
We stand on our corner 'cause we can't see progression...?
Wise in our eyes, broken kings seekin treasure, but if we're broken rulers then we're takin broken measures
