Ladies and gentleman, please stand to your feet
For Sho Baraka's rendition of "Overrated"!

(Verse 1:Sho Baraka)
Look at the state of the world
Yea, I'm mad at the world
And I'ma share my frustration just a little bit
Every brother is a thug
And while they glorifying drugs
They look at me bugged
Cuz I wanna be a gentlemen
And my ladies are a mess
They want value in their dress
And in themselves they don't invest
They want significance
The young'uns quote 50 cent
But can't count to 50 cent
We promote ignorance
And we're so illiterate
My Man loving that money to death
Really to death
He'll kill himself to get him a check
Oh, but he weeped about Virginia tech
But he sells Glocks and tech
Please help me understand his intellect
We can talk about taxes and air pollution
Government's great illusion
But that's makeup for the skin
And I don't wanna give problems without solutions
So I've come to this conclusion
Love God and hate sin

(Hook)
The money (the money), the power (the power)
The fame (the fame) The lies and the games
It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all)
Overrated!
The lust (the lust), the pride (the pride)
The greed (the greed), anything to succeed
It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all)
Overrated!

(Verse 2)
This cat was like I don't feel you to be honest
You should sound more street, more hood, more conscious
And also be more liberal with your content
He wanna make me a star, so I can fall like a comet
I'm satisfied with the things that God promised
I don't need to chase the steak when I'm cool with top ramen
I'm a servant of the King; I pay homage
I don't wanna be on top, if they put Him at the bottom
"Sho you just faking to be humble and poor
In hopes that the LORD will be pleased and bless you with more."
No, homie, I just keep my face to the floor
When he opens the door, my views will be the same as before
I can't be real commercial with it
Non-offensive lyrics, get some radio spins, and give them Jesus later
I wanna walk like the Lord, and talk like the Lord
If we live like the lord, then the world will hate us

(Hook)
The clothes (the clothes), the sex (the sex)
The cars (the cars), anything to be stars
It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all)
Overrated!
The rage (the rage), the hate (the hate)
The drugs (the drugs), everybody is a thug
It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all)
Overrated!

(Verse 3)
It could be hard righteous living
With the freedom God has given
But we can live in the world and keep our sanity
You might one day be a star
Even drive a fancy car
But realize, my friend, it's all vanity
It's the heart at question, who has your affections
Is it the goods you love or the GOD who made them?
So for my last suggestion
If we've learned any lesson
The world's lost the game - its overrated

The what (the what), the who (the who)
The things (the things), the rat race for the green
It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all)
Overrated!
The ohh (the ohh), the ooh (the ooh)
The ahh (the ahh), the blas√© blah
It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all)
Overrated!

The cash (the cash), the cream (the cream)
The diamonds (the diamonds), pretty much everything
It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all), It's all (it's all)
It's overrated

Yea, recognize Christ is the real champion
Surrender your life to Him
He'll bring your life real value
