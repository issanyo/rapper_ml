My heart has caused me so many losses I never really thought it through
We live a lie think we never die, but tomorrow catches up with you
Forever, we shouldn't waste our time together
So many people want forever

We would do dirt just because of peer pressure
Two knuckle heads and we ran the streets together
Just to impress the homies we would do whatever
Now you're locked up and it feels like (forever)
Some reason I feel like it's my fault
You found out I found faith, I found out you got caught
You serving time, I'm serving with time
You guilty of crime, I'm guilty of crime, against the divine
We thought we would forever do dirt
The un-quenching of man's thirst, forever is man's curse
Now we see the consequences and they hurt
An easy way to ruin lives when you put self-first
There is always freedom behind bars
We roam freely but we don't recognize ours
Forever is tomorrow
There is hope for your worries and rest of your sorrows

Yeah Lady you are mine
Its you and I until the end of time, (That's a mac line)
This covenant don't mean much to most
They get a little spooked then their ghost, (what a joke)
Hey this is more than a rhyme; I've been called to provide
Even if I'm the last of my kind (clever)
Yes I know there's more; we're on one accord
We will please the Lord, (whom we stand before)
It's more than opening Doors, real service is more
This is even through rich and through poor
Some don't think about the vows their taking
Oath before God and the promise their making
These other jokers they don't see a queen
I guess it's hard when they don't see a King, (know what I mean)
This can't be Hollywood romance
If that's an indication of love, then we won't last
That's a system that's built against us
They sale lust and they're just here to tempt us
I am physic I can predict the weather
The storms may come but the sun shines forever

What's this all about forever is Tomorrow
Well life is short and our time is borrowed
And the lender wants his payment
And its impossible for us to make arrangements, (were so endangered)
Let me introduce you to a stranger
Who can pay your debt and turn God's anger (born in a manger)
He's the path to forever, He's the standard and measure
He brings God and man together, (clever)
When man wants his own way, and evil is ok
When he knows he should go right and goes left
Somebody's gotta pay for those who disobey
Sacrifice was the only way, He took death
I'm talking about Christ the Son, the righteous one
The only way tomorrow will come
I'm speaking of life eternal, life that's borrowed
He's more than a good man with morals
He's the reason we move and breath
You know peace when you know the king, (God intervened)
I know you're thinking these Christians do to much
We can't do enough in lieu of what he's done for us
