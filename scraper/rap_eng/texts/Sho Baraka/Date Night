[Verse 1: Stephen the Levite]
Can I be honest from the gate
And say it’s really a struggle to take my wife on a date?
Cuz we be low on the papes
And when i do I feel irresponsible, to me it’s logical, we ain’t got it so wait
We spend a lot on a plate and get dressed up
The budget gets messed up, who we tryin’ to impress huh? I do feel the pressure
From watching too many romantic comedies
Couples stuntin’ on instagram got sayin’ “come off the cheese”
(in my mind at least) though I would never hold a Glock and squeeze
In commission of robberies, In my mind i feel like a thief
I mean, is wrong to dream like I hit the lottery
And I could easily drop a g on my awesome queen?
Can a brother step in some wallabees
New jawns, i ain’t really got no more since I copped the rings
Money’s monopoly on my mind is problem chief
I know it seems off topic but this is how I think on date night

[Hook: Leah Smith]
Let's go for a ride
We can keep it simple babe
Forget your plans tonight
As long as I can be with you
It's a good night, a good time
I want you to myself so is that alright
Can we go on a date?

[Verse 2: Stephen the Levite]
How does something so simple stir up these insecurities, internally, purgin’ me of confidence
Then it gets deep, my inabilities conflictin’ in me, wickedly convincing me if it’s cheap then I’m wrong for this
And the consequence is I call it quits
Blame it on the rent because the money’s the problem and not my thoughlessness
If you caught the hint, then you’re convinced, this is common sense
There are creative ways to date when you’re not as rich
A walk in a park or parkin’ it talkin’ on a bench
Or park and sit where it’s really dark and the stars are lit
Far from city lights and all the kids
As long as we call the sitter and she’s on at 6, it’s an awesome trip/
I wanna get alone with you, kill the phone get you
Off the grid, how am I doing good? how should I repent
Take the time to vent if you wanna, you got my ears
If it's in your heart then I wanna hear
Baby it's date night

[Hook: Leah Smith]
Let's go for a ride
We can keep it simple babe
Forget your plans tonight
As long as I can be with you
It's a good night, a good time
I want you to myself so is that alright
Can we go on a date?

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Every single day is a date night
Well, even though I don't live it, you know what I mean
I'm trying, lady love, I'm trying
Let's escape the cliché movie date with late night dining
No Androids or iPhones, I love human eyes
No distraction, no phone, no kids, it's you and I
Full attention, mind, body and quality time
We can spend some dimes or maybe we could just stay inside
Just you and I, artist for the night
The thing's our canvas we are painters, we're bringing it to life
We're low on funds but we have high imaginations
Our moments alone are like heaven, excuse my exaggeration
Graceful from my angle, you're an angel
By night's end, you'll be removing that halo
But that's at day ten, my friend
With each new sunrise, a new day begins

[Hook: Leah Smith]
Let's go for a ride
We can keep it simple babe
Forget your plans tonight
As long as I can be with you
It's a good night, a good time
I want you to myself so is that alright
Can we go on a date?
