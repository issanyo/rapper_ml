[Intro] (spoken)
They talk about the law but they twisting the law. (Yeah they do) The law can't save us, it just shows us our flaws. (Ok) The law is a tutor that leads us to Christ, and by faith we're justified, and He gives us life. (Yeah)

[Hook]
They talk about the law, they talk about the law (bear some fruit)
They twistin' the law, they twistin' the law (bear some fruit)
The law is a tutor that leads us to Christ
By faith justified, He gives us life (bear some fruit)

They talk about the law, they talk about the law (bear some fruit)
They twistin' the law, they twistin' the law (bear some fruit)
The law is a tutor that leads us to Christ
By faith justified, He gives us life (bear some fruit)

Got grace from the Father in the Son renewed
Be filled with the Spirit and bear some fruit
Say bear some fruit (bear some fruit)
Say bear some fruit (bear some fruit) (let's go)

[Verse 1]
Let me be clear, I ain't here to please men
If I was then I wouldn't be a servant of Him
I'm shocked how quickly we turn from the real faith
They want to discredit my ministry, say I'm real fake
I'm like Paul, I got called on my way to Damascus
Commissioned by Christ to go preach to the masses
He wasn't a disciple when Christ took the lashes
And since the Twelve didn't know him, they questioned his passion
But he preached a gospel that was grace related
Not another from the Lord, and these Judaizers hate it
False teachers come through like wolves in disguise
And some of my closest boys believe these lies
We know those who teach this other gospel is accursed
And you followin' these teachings don't benefit the church
The application: I'm not bound to your traditions
Free from the law, to the Spirit I'm submittin'

[Hook]
They talk about the law, they talk about the law (bear some fruit)
They twistin' the law, they twistin' the law (bear some fruit)
The law is a tutor that leads us to Christ
By faith justified, He gives us life (bear some fruit)

They talk about the law, they talk about the law (bear some fruit)
They twistin' the law, they twistin' the law (bear some fruit)
The law is a tutor that leads us to Christ
By faith justified, He gives us life (bear some fruit)

I know I'm dirt I ain't got nothin' to prove
But be filled with the Spirit and bear some fruit
Say bear some fruit (bear some fruit)
Say bear some fruit (bear some fruit) (let's go)

[Verse 2]
Why you tryin' to rebuild what you once destroyed?
The contract's abolished, the law's null and void
It's no longer I that live, but Christ that lives
I no longer have the same priorities, you dig?
Since I understand grace, man, things have changed
If I'm justified by my works then He died in vain
'Cause there's no fury known like the Savior scorned
Tryin' to produce another veil after the first was torn
A promise was given before the law even came
But because there's a law doesn't mean the promise has changed
But what the law does do is shows we needed a promise
The Seed of Abraham, to Whom we pay homage
The application: if all this is true
How can I go back to the things I used to do?
You can read more, share more, do more things
But it's only through Christ by which you please the King

[Hook]
They talk about the law, they talk about the law (bear some fruit)
They twistin' the law, they twistin' the law (bear some fruit)

They talk about the law, they talk about the law (bear some fruit)
They twistin' the law, they twistin' the law (bear some fruit)

Sanctified by the Word for the Word is truth
Be filled in the Spirit and bear some fruit
Say bear some fruit (bear some fruit)
Say bear some fruit (bear some fruit)

[Verse 3]
They want justification by the law they've fallen from grace
They pretty much denied that Christ even died in they place
Eagerly await the hope of righteousness by faith
With faith fulfill the law with love, not hate
But I hate my flesh, it's bad for my health
Gotta serve my community while dyin' to myself
'Cause myself is nothin, but a thief and a liar
But Christ crucified my passions and desires
If I'm trippin' in community your boy's gon' hear it
Gotta restore that cat with the fruit of the Spirit
Without submittin' to the Spirit your boy can't grow
And just tryin' to do more, man, you reap what you sow
The application: walk in the Spirit in every situation
I'm crucified to the world, I'm a new creation
And just as Christ is the Architect to salvation
The Spirit is essential to sanctification (yeah)

[Outro]
Let's walk in the Spirit, so we don't gratify the desires of the flesh
Say bear some fruit (bear some fruit)
Say bear some fruit (bear some fruit)
Say I got love, I got love, I got (I got love, I got love, I got)
Say I got peace, I got peace, I got (I got peace, I got peace, I got)
Say He gave joy, He gave joy, He gave (He gave joy, He gave joy, He gave)
I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be (I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be) (yeah)
