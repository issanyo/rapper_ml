I step outta the front door
Music is inflating my ego
It's hard to just let go
Beats bangin' thoughts in my torso
The streets then repeat it like echoes
The picture thats painted
It makes me wanna live life dangerous
It makes me wanna be rich and famous
I know it ain't righteous
But they make it look so enticing
It attacks my ears like it's Tyson
Takes a bite of my conscience
Watch me bob my head to some nonsense
Rob, steal, kill, and speak bondage
I could be truthful, I used to be silent
But its got your boy straight fillin' with violence
I'm using the ladies, I used to respect them
And now your boy say anything just to sex them
I used to modest, I used to be honest
Now I do anything to get those dollars
'Cause I love...

Record execs make a killin'
"Yeah we could pay you in millions"
Cash to the ceiling, don't trust your conviction or feelin'
You'll be just misleading some children
Their parents will blame you
You communicate what you've been through
They don't understand you're a black dude
And one that does rap too
They just complain and they hassle
They would do it too if they had to
You just make paper, we don't need to know where it came from
You didn't make the rope which they hang from
Cocaine and that handgun, everyone there saw 'em the same bruh
But this is the country of freedom
You can have women, you can have diamonds
This is what sells, greed, sex, drugs, and violence
Package these items, for people to buy them
And one day you would be an executive giant
Produce and sell...

Who's at fault for ignoring Paul shootin' right for them Jordans
'Cause Nike extortin' the loyalty of poor man's emotions
Without them they feel less important
And how about athletes, they come from the same back-streets
And they could make them shoes a lot more cheap
And how about rappers, they boast about evil
They say the same stuff they got copied from Kinko's
And what are the wealthy, that keep on complainin'
They ask for legislation and they think that will change men
And how about churches, they become obsolete
They call more meetings just to talk about outreach
And have more workshops, and hear more men speak
And just repeat all the deep thoughts a dead man inked
Who's without blame here, I guess we're all guilty
In the core of mans heart, yeah were all filthy
Man has no standards, he thinks he has answers
We all got disease and it's much worse than cancer
He speaks with the father, he wants your allegiance
He plays God's role, yeah it's like we don't need him
But he hates...
