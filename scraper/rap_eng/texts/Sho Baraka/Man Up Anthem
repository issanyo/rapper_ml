[Intro]
Man Up

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Momma want some Obama in me, The hood want 'Pac
Hip Hop want to see the Common in me
And since it's a senseless contradiction
I end up a misfit trying to fit in
This ends when I stand up
And see the hands of the standard, holy is the Lamb huh
Now we holding you to Man Up
Cause we were made in His image
Start lookin' at what you came from

[Verse 2: KB]
(Hey listen)
Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy is Adamic
Adamant
After what Adonai is against
Let me take you back to the tree in Eden
If you read it you'll see that Eve was deceived
But Adam's the one who let her eat
Instead of leading
No we ain't leading
We bump that
Basically little boys with muscles and our mustache
To femininity we need a remedy
The God-Man 100% masculinity

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
We the last
Yeah
Where the men at?
It seems like they all lost
None of them are on the scene it seems like they died off
They extinct but my dream is to rise up
We chasin' the prize of the King, the divine boss
But we fell away, now we ungodly
We lose and we really got the blues like Navi
I want to celebrate the dudes that's beside me
Fellas let's elevate, we do with the lively

[Verse 4: Tedashii]
They lie
Go ahead dead boy get your shine on
And if a sucka try to buck ya get your 9 homes
That's what I heard you gotta do to be a man now
Stand up for yourself so I took it in my hands now
And that's the problem man we busy tryin' to solve it
All the while we walking dead, man somebody bring the coffin
Voice dropped, peach fuzz
Now you think that you a man 'cus you feelin' yourself
You need to Man Up

[Verse 5: Sho Baraka]
There's many things men is chasing after
They got some questions, we got some answers
Sex and models and tippin' bottles back
Pile up excuses right next to your bottle caps
A Rolodex filled with names that you aim to please
Next to the stack of money building up a heart of greed
Ice on his neck givin' jokers the cold shoulder
You drunk off pride plus you lovin' the hangover
You gotta whole lot of stuff that won't amount to gain
Life will never make sense because you never made change

[Verse 6: Derek Minor]
You got it twisted and sick like a fever
Lil' man live to stack dough, Keebler
Man up, get up outta the tree house
Leave the cookies alone it's time to eat meat now
Tryna show you a new way to live now
No charge, You can call it a freestyle
Without Christ your normal man is
A boy in a man's body like Tom Hanks in "Big"

[Verse 7: Andy Mineo]
Yeah
Bein' a man ain't got nothin' to do with age
You could be a boy 'til the day you lay in a grave
None of us behave like the image of who we're made
Cause we fall in the way, it's better known as depraved
Runnin' from responsibility
Really we crave the easy way out of places that call us to pull our weight
Man they goin' through every day decisions are made
Responding to the call God's given them from the gate

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
(Man up)
Let the process begin, let's separate the boys from the men...
(Man Up)
It don't matter how you started, partner, it's about how you end...
(Man Up)
Jesus is the model, follow us we will follow him
(Man Up)
We the last of a dying breed it's time that we...
(Man Up)
