(Intro)
This is the music of....
This is the music of life
This is the music of
This is the music of life...

(HOOK)
Okay, Okay, Okay, let's go!!!
Ohhh! Ohhh! Ohh! Ohh!
If you love this music of life, get your hands up
He's holy and perfect, so get your hands up
He's sovereign and majestic, so get your hands up
Get your hands up
Get your hands up

(Verse 1)
Before we couldn't sing that music of life
Now all we play is that music of Christ
Called and redeemed, get your hands up
Love God, love your brother He commands us
We live by a different beat, check the new sound
We walk in the spirit it's like a ghost town
We exalt a holy God who uses earth as a throne
If His throne is a chair, then a chair is my home
My sound track of life went from blues into worship
It's a daily sacrifice, yeah ya' boy knows his purpose
Never saw a beautiful death until I saw the cross
Saw the nails hit my sins, hit the law, hit my flaws
How could the banging of nails make music of life
And the rolling of a stone echo power of Christ
It's not the kind of music that make the kids jump
But it is the kind of that makes heart thump

(Hook)

(Verse Two)
It's the music that makes a stressed man cope
Makes a suicidal cat want to drop that rope
Makes the hood drug dealer want to quit that dope
It's faith in Christ that brings man hope
Ever since the fall it ain't been much to sing about
We were born in life's grave but Christ has dug us out
So I shout I sing I keep His banner raised
116 on my heart, this boy is unashamed
Of the ancient of days a God who's unchanged
I carry my bed to show the world I was lame
I will not go back to which from I came
It's like a free man who wants to be a slave
I believe in His holiness, authority and might
Now that I'm sealed with the spirit a deposit of life
If you're free from the bondage get your hands up
Sick of low living, He turned our lives up

(Hook)

(Verse Three)
It's the music of life that makes kings bow down
Makes the lowly up rise, open the blind man's eyes
His eye is on the sparrow; I walk the straight and narrow
Cuz' He is known to break the will of stubborn mules like Pharaoh
You can travel many cities, even nations over seas
Hearing stories of a Sheppard who gave His life for His sheep
And how he prepared a home after death for His peeps
Because He defeated death with a three day sleep
And now we write music to make the King blush
We got a crush on God, He choose not to crush us
But man's great tension is to steal God's fame
But He's had it since the sixth day ain't gon' change
The clouds are His high hats, the mountains are His keys
Thunder is the clap, you can hear the wind sing
If you find pleasure in the Lord, then get your hands up
He makes beautiful music I'm just a fan of....

(Hook)
