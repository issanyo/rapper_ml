[Hook: After Edmund]
Gonna be hard to shut us down, down
Gonna be hard to shut us down, down
Down

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Okay, call your man, call your girl, tell them all to call their bluff
Tell them call the stations and ask them why they hate on us
Took an ouch for his people just so he can stay in touch
Check the record books, it's better off you run with us
Call us punks, call us weak, call us chumps, call us dumb
Call the Verizon network and still see it's not enough
On the cable on the web, on the phone they call us whack
Go ahead and try to shut us down, ain't no app for that

[Hook: After Edmund]
Running with us, or you can hate me
But it'll be hard to shut us down
Ohh, running with us, or you can hate me
But it'll be hard to shut us down

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Listen, I like to tell the truth, don't like to save face
Born in H-town, got the words to save face
Christian means that when I eat the beat I say my grace
If only God could judge you how you plan to beat the case
Can't beat it, Mike Jack couldn't either
All you get is one life, can't rewind or repeat it
I will do this till the day I take my last breath
Beautiful feet I'm running till I take my last step
There's nothing they can do to stop what the Lord's doing
Come in the kitchen, take a look at what the Lord's brewing
Radio don't play us, television mock us
The truth is still spreading, there's no way they can stop us
Pharisees throw stones at my glass house
But they don't see their own reflection when they bad mouth
You can lie, you can hate, you can run us down
But in the end, the gates of Hell couldn't shut us down

[Hook: After Edmund]

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Some think we're a mess, some calling us blessed
A mic and a stage, don't always equal success
Sometimes a bigger platform only brings stress
I watch my life and doctrine and pray for the best
AT told me let your light shine homes
Even if they wanna see you crash like Dow Jones
It's like Matt 16, who can come against it
You can be a Pharisee or you can be a witness
If we stay in the church the world calls us religious
If we go on MTV, the saints think were tripping
If we try to hit the streets then we're some thugs in sin
With those spectating you can't expect to win
It's hard to make decisions when theory's clouded your vision
Sometimes I'm confused with who is my opposition
I think I heard cheers when I fumbled the ball
They claim they're on our team but praying for our fall

[Hook: After Edmund]
Running with us, or you can hate me
But it'll be hard to shut us down
Ohh, running with us, or you can hate me
But it'll be hard to shut us down
Gonna be hard to shut us down, down, down
Gonna be hard to shut us down, down, down
Down, down, gonna be hard to shut us down, down, down
