[Verse 1: Stephen the Levite]
I remember before my church started
A season that I called the darkness
Saved but still living in bondage
Not know the problem was not just my pride and lust
But that life was so autonomous
But at Epiphany I had an epiphany
Realizing community was the way it was meant to be
WHY?
In the beginning He who gave us identity
Was, eternally, co-existing as the Trinity
Saying
It's not good for man to be alone
It's impossible for him to model Us on his own
So
He gave man a companion not a clone
Commanding reproduction, expansion, and a throne
And now
The new Adam is starting it all over
Sparking it with bride who glorifies Jehovah
Submit
You wanna know who you are then know your role 'cause
Your ID's in Christ and Christ is part of a whole bruh

[Chorus]
Back back them church boys are back
Oh!
That's that the new life is that
Oh!
FOTU with my crew till He comes back
Oh!
Live in community
Walk in community
Back back them church boys are back
Hey!
That's that the new life is that
Hey!
FOTU with my crew till He comes back
Hey!
Live in community
Walk in community

Before Real Talk were Ambassadors chopping
Up that milk and meat, having all things in common
Before church planting was an option
Before the albums start dropping
We were in community stomping
Patience with your boy when I was loud and obnoxious
Before I turned my life up in at a concert
Before I learned the truth over nonsense
Before I hit a stage they were caution
Accountability, yeah awesome not produce a man selfish or pompous
Know the process of Learning the scriptures in its context
Bible study sometime it made me nauseous
But know I never grow sick of spitting up those synoptics
Constantly keeping others upon my conscious
Being honest not just robbing them of their knowledge
Promise to serve one another in righteous conduct
Its common sense I'm something like a communist

Back back them church boys are back
Oh!
That's that the new life is that
Oh!
FOTU with my crew till He comes back
Oh!
Live in community
Walk in community
Back back them church boys are back
Hey!
That's that the new life is that
Hey!
FOTU with my crew till He comes back
Hey!
Live in community
Walk in community

Give me a sec just to put it in perspect
He's God
And He deserves more than just your check
He deserves your breath
Every one you'll ever get
We deserve death
Something (by grace) we'll never get
So, hands
, devoted
, cause He rose and beat death
We could be right handed but we all went left
See in order to redeem me He gave up Himself
So I'm laying on the alter till they lay me to rest
What you expect
Man we give God our best
Plus
Knowing Him, is how we know our, self
So
We learn of Him in the way that He set
Up, so we can get it
Christian fellowship
As I imitate God and conform more to Christ
In the bond of community
I look more like
Him (Him), Him (Him), and the image I was meant to have
Praise God for the Church
Showing me just me who I am

Back back them church boys are back
Oh!
That's that the new life is that
Oh!
FOTU with my crew till He comes back
Oh!
Live in community
Walk in community
Back back them church boys are back
Hey!
That's that the new life is that
Hey!
FOTU with my crew till He comes back
Hey!
Live in community
Walk in community
