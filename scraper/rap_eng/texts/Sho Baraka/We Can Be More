[Intro - J.R.]
We can be more, lady we can be more
We can be more, lady we can be more

[Verse 1 - Sho Baraka]
Yeah you stepped in, God healed my heartache
And this is way past lust, no prom date
And we can be a sweet aroma, Scrangie
And they can call us outcast, Andre
Told my boys yeah catch me I’m fallin’
You are on my team even when I ain’t ballin’
You are patient with your boy in the worst case
I was like 9/11, the worst date
You been runnin’ through my mind, first place
Those other girls they weak like Thursday
This is gentlemen’s music, boys to men
I’m done with that player’s life, born again
We’ll be joined in body and soul
Heart and mind, money and time
If she’s chocolate or vanilla or you’re buttersctoch crème
She the only one for you, she should make you wanna sing

[Chorus - J.R.]
Girl you know you got my heart
And you know I love you so much
This is more than lust
You and I can become us
We’ve known each other for a while
And I know you say we just friends, but
We can be more, lady we can be more
We can be more, lady we can be more

[Verse 2 - Sho Baraka]
You got me feelin’ like a 6th grader, that’s fo’ sho’
Do you wanna be my wife? Check yes or no
It’s hard to stay pure in this dirty world
Everybody wants them a little dirty girl
They consult the pigs for a quick referral
They lookin’ for the shells when they have a pearl
You can be Coretta, I can be your king
We can get together, we can have a dream
I could be the Rev, you could be Justine
We can walk this way or we can run as a team
And you ain’t gotta wonder in your mind
God’s on our side, I see the ribbon in the sky
Huh, now tell them jokers bye-bye
You’ve found real love, Mary J. Blige
If you know love is more than a ring
Grab your lady by the hand, this’ll make you wanna sing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Sho Baraka]
A lifelong fight, that’s what marriage is
Make love, not war like a terrorist
My playboy past is so embarrasin’
But your love got me goin’ crazy, call a therapist
Yeah, girl you know it’s a problem when
You got me feelin’ lines from the Songs of Solomon
Yeah, you got a classy appeal
But you’re also so fine, I just gotta keep it real
I know beauty is alive
Peacocks may try, they don’t know you fly
Yeah, now go ahead and touch the sky
And bring my heart back when it’s time to swing by

[Outro - Sho Baraka & J.R.]
Clap, you make a brother wanna sing
Step, you make a brother wanna sing
We can be more, lady we can be more
We can be more, lady we can be more
Yeah, now look that lady in the eye
Yeah, now look that lady in the eye
Tell her we can be more, lady we can be more
We can be more, lady we can be more
