[Intro: JK]
Ten spyte van ons lyding en in die midde van ons pyn
Staan daar een wat bekend is met lyding
En Hy's gewilling om vir ons te genees:
Jesus Christus

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Yeah, I feel the pain of a 70's soul singer
Who just saw the death of one of its soul leaders
I wanna sell records but yet I feel eager
To write political tunes that give a certain ﬁnger
To talk to God they told me to climb a mountain
I'm thirsty for His revelation, where's the colored fountain?
As grace rains on the concrete garden
I guess it's common sense now that that's water for chocolate
Mommas tried to keep their babies off the street
Police got rap sheets so ya kids gettin' beat, beat
Hit after hit video in the crowd and still not enough evidence
I'm on my Harriet Tubman maybe my sojourner
More like Martin Luther the King and Nat Turner
I roll with a team of newly redeemed sinners
That know we have to lose our life to be winners (live)

[Hook]
Clouds will come the rain will fall
Sometimes sun won't shine at all
From pain inside cries will soar
But I'm hopin' that you hold all things together

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Yeah, every pastor ain't corrupt, every church don't suck
But the people are thinkin', who will speak for us?
A nation of people who bleach their skin
Keep ﬁghtin' my bro, you'll ﬁnd that peace within
Or that young brown sister with a pure gold voice
Or that unborn child who has had no choice
Third world pains, kids dyin' of AIDS
Abort a child cuz 2 adults had childish ways
Pretty offensive - I'm still in the zone
I have a Chris Rock goal - keep my daughter off the pole
That's two-fold - stripping and politickin'
Cuz to me homie I don't really see much difference
Promise a bunch of stuff you never get
Exit with the same concerns you came in with
To all my people who grindin' - what up tho'?
To all my people who dyin' - what up ghost?
To all my people who grindin' - what up tho'?
To all my people who dyin' - what up ghost?

[Hook]
Clouds will come the rain will fall
Sometimes sun won't shine at all
From pain inside cries will soar
But I'm hopin' that you hold all things together

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Born in Alberta, died in Atlanta
Had 2 parents plus raised by grandma
Told I was different cuz I spoke with a grammar that was proper
Cuz my momma tried to raise me with manners
I'm a lover, I'm a husband, I'm an artist, I'm a father
I'm a ﬁghter, a believer, I'm an actor, I'm an author
I ran up son of Adam, I'm just lookin' for the pardon
A vegan avoidin' the beef that started in the garden
I'm on my Oscar Grant and invisible children
Jena Six, Rakeem Boyd, I am Bobby Tillman
I'm on my thief on the cross the prodigal son
And I was the sheep that was lost
I'm on my mover and shakers a student of the panthers
Also learned in the quakers
I'm on my Zora Neale, Absalom Jones
Harlem renaissance with a Paul Robeson poem
I'm on my George Washington Carver
A humble servant who gave all glory to the Father
I'm on my Rembrandt with a ﬁtted cap
C.S. Lewis if he would ever rap
I'm on my Lord touch down
I love life but you can come back now
I'm on my son of a king, a fresh prince
Diverse being, the talented 10th

[Outro]
(To all my people who grindin' - look up tho'
To all my people who grindin' - look up tho'
To all my people who dyin' - what up ghost?
To all my people who dyin' - what up ghost?)
Wade in the water
Wade in the water children
Wade in the water
God's gonna trouble the water

Wade in the water
Wade in the water children
Wade in the water
God's gonna trouble the water

God's gonna trouble the water
