[Intro]
Yo, um
Just yeah just run it back to the top
'cause I'm probably just
Imma do something different

I-I got a story, it's not, well it-it's a story, it's a love story
It's not your typical type of love story though
But just listen

[Verse: Sho Baraka]
Once upon a time but not long ago
Before the Civil Rights Movement and the new Jim Crow
Sit back, I'll introduce you to a wonderful place
In every state called 'Myhood USA'
Life wasn't perfect, but they did what they could
And people took pride in their neighborhood
They had doctors, and lawyers
Artists, barbers, and teachers
Entrepreneurs, politicians, and preachers
Stable universities, sports leagues and banks
You invest and trade here 'cause in other places you can't
Black owned, from the cradle to the coffin
Before the NBA we had a history of ballin'
Durham, Greenwood, Atlanta, sweet Auburn, Quakertown
And third ward Houston, but here's a caution
Why they wanted their turn, and just earn and make a living
Some just wanted them to burn, baby burn
It was vicious
If the city wasn't consumed by unexplained flames
It would eventually change due to imminent domain
How can you own a home if you can't get a loan
And the powers that be just red line your zone?
The government wants your value to drop
So then the private investors come through and buy up your spot
You can't win fighting the government and KKK
Plus intergration hit my hood in a curious way
Blacks move to the 'burbs tryna escape the system
But they took stability and wealth right along with 'em
Their ownership and financial stimulation
It makes it much easier for gentrification
We ain't building jobs to build schools to build wisdom
But instead we build debt so they build more prisons
A few taxpayers, they make money off policing
Fines and tickets, I'm getting searched for no reason
Police are underpaid but they are making a killing
Compound that with the crack epidemic
But now we got dope fiends, shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of Harvard nor hope
Howard or Praire View even at Tuskegee
Morehouse next to the poor house
Baby we leaving for the American dream
It's in the 'burbs now
Opportunities in my hood get turned down
Community service groups, they turn into gangs
They hammer us with bad aim, they banging on everything
So now my friend on the next street becomes my enemy
No job to distract us, 'cause we ain't got an industry
All we got is liquor stores next to a Burger King
Next to a pawn shop, next to a Dairy Queen
Next to the China shop, next to the gas station
Next to the five churches, next to the building that's vacant
Most of the businesses owned by the Asians
So the money never stays in the same location
This is the truth, this ain't hating
If the church can't change it then who should we place faith in?
Some blame welfare, some blame the music
Some blame the dealer, some blame the user
Turn on the news, let's figure out who we blaming
Many benefit off my hood from not changing
Exploiting my culture, they aiding and abetting and it's the black stock exchange
They buying, and they selling
These generations of self hate and psychosis
In my hood it's almost innate to feel hopeless
Predatory lending and banking in my hood
We ain't creating wealth, we just importing goods
But a change gon' come is what I tell the youngsters
This is a love song, I like to call it justice

[Chorus: Vanessa Hill]
I wish words could really tell you how I feel
But words are only really noise until, ahhh
They come to life, I ain't lying
I know you try
This is not another love song

[Hook: Sho Baraka]
One time, hey young world
Love is yours, hey young world
Cause love is yours young world
Young world
Or my hey young world
This love is yours, hey young world
This love is yours young world
This love is yours young world
Share the love

[Chorus: Vanessa Hill]
I wish words could really tell you how I feel
But words are only really noise until, ahhhh
They come to life, I ain't lying
I know you try
This is not another love song
