[Intro]
Uh, sweet sixteen
Sixteen on sixteen on sixteen

[Verse]
When the pressure on me I cook it
When the feds on me, I book it
When the devil's on me, I shook it
When she put it on me, I took it
These buffoons look at me crooked, yet all I do is smirk
I devote my life to my party, and yet all I do is work, work, work, work
Work to get more loose leaf
I ain't slept in two weeks
Finally you find your dream, irony is, you lose sleep
So I keep my collar starched, in lunch meetings a la carte
I first stepped in this office with my shoes about to fall apart

Beggars can't be choosers, winners can't be losers
A Chief must pay dues and bow to Slick Rick, the ruler
Lemonade, agave with naughty water, I'm juiced up
Know all about that Mali, you can call me Mansa Musa!

I'm a city kid but still I'm from the bush, negro
Don't need to raise my voice to make you shush, negro
Chieftain in my blood, not just kush, negro
Street smart but I read a fuckin' book, negro

I don't believe in your dream if you say you tryna, finna, gonna do
Still standing in the same place overthinking what you wanna do
Niggas thinkin' they know everything, they offending those of us who do
When you walking on the red carpet, we can steal the rug from under you

Better move pronto, squanto, or your teepee won't be no more
They flip projects into condos quicker than you can say Jimmy Jim Crow
What do I know? Ask Django, I don't talk trash, I rap composed
Money come quick and money come slow, get the green game on point like Rondo
I'll meet you at the crossroads...of the valley and the hills
Where the bus took us to school with a bunch of white boys crushing pills
They slang a gang of yay, but they never went to jail
Well my negroes caught a case, for an eighth they went to hell
And well, house nigga in the field tryna get my funds right
While the homies in the shadows moochin' off of my sunlight
And they want what I earn, but I want more than a rapper's worth
And they say the grass always greener, nine times out of ten it's AstroTurf
While I put cash up in her purse, sometimes I dress like a farmer
For envy is a weed you should never try to water
Better to nip it in the bud, harder to whack it when it flowers
See 'round that Boston Garden I was brought up, that prince and pauper

I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
Blood on the leaves, the leaves, the leaves
Blood on the leaves, the leaves, the leaves
Kill a nigga with the guns and disease
Make a nigga wanna fly overseas
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
Pick up the heater and tell 'em to freeze!
