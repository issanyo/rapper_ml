[Shortened Pre-Hook]
Are we ever gonna
You should make up your mind
Take you back to my shrine

[Hook]
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got the feelin' you've been here before
You needed tonight like a weekend ago
Yeah, you in or you out or you playin' or foldin'

[Pre-Hook]
We in need of a moment
Are we ever gonna
You should make up your mind
Take you back to my shrine
Don't you pay them no mind
Let them be, let them go
She was made for my eyes
We escape the times

[Hook]
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
I'ma need the whole night
And  little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the party gets shallow the deeper we go
Telling you secrets that you shouldn't know
Yeah, I feel like it's just you and me on the floor

[Pre-Hook]
We in need of a moment
Are we ever gonna
You should make up your mind
Take you back to my shrine
Don't you pay them no mind
Let them be, let them go
She was made for my eyes
We escape the times

[Hook]
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more

[Bridge]
And a little bit more
And a little bit more
And a little bit more
Just a little bit more
Wahala she no dey give me
Wahala she no dey give me
I dey want you plenty plenty
I dey want you plenty plenty
Oh me, oh my, plenty, plenty
Oh nah, plenty, plenty
Oh me, oh my, plenty, plenty
Oh nah, plenty, plenty

[Hook]
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
