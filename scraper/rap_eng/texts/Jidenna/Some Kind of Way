[Chorus]
No matter what you say
Or where you go or what you do
Or how you pray
Somebody's gonna feel some kind of way
Somebody's gonna feel some kind of way about you....awww
You can't hide your face
We're-waiting-for-you-to-come out and play
Somebody's gonna feel some kind of way
Somebody's gonna feel some kind of way about you
Oooh Oooh Oooh

[Verse 1]
Now they wanna live like you
Up in the club gettin’ lit like you
Wanna talk shit like you
But they can't never be slick like you
Now they wanna live by you
First they ain't even wanna sit by you
Man I remember when I would enter-tain ‘em all like you
Every every every every time I do
(I do)
I be I be I be tryna find my cool
(my cool)
Every every every every time I do
(I do)
I be I be I be tryna find my cool
(my cool)
Awww

[Chorus]
No matter what you say
Or where you go or what you do
Or how you pray
Somebody's gonna feel some kind of way
Somebody's gonna feel some kind of way about you....aww
You can't hide your face
We're-waiting-for-you-to-come out and play
Somebody's gonna feel some kind of way
Somebody's gonna feel some kind of way about you
