[Intro]
No, no, no, no
Mmm, mmm
Don’t go n' leave me
Don’t go n' leave me
Don’t go n' leave me yo
Mmm, mmm
No, no

[Verse 1]
I thought of leaving
I want a kid
I want the world
I want the isle
I want to live
She got a grievance
She want the kid
She want the kid
She want the car
She want the crib

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I got to admit it might be about that
My moves need to be about that
Body pullin' me to feel you
Try to leave ya, but I still don't go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even if I wanted to
I come back around
Even if I wanted to
I come back and we just go around, babe

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
If you plantin' or plantain

[Post-Chorus]
When you got me feelin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, bang
When you got me feelin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang

[Verse 2]
I got no need to pretend I know
I got no need to pretend I know
I got no need to pretend I know
She want key
She want the car
She want the crib

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I might admit, it might be about that
My moves need to be about that
Body pullin' me to feel you are you
Try to leave ya, but I still don't go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even if I wanted to
I come back around
Even if I wanted to
I come back and we just go around, babe

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
If you plantin' or plantain

[Post-Chorus]
When you got me feelin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, bang
When you got me feelin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang

[Bridge]
Lookin' out and I wonder 'bout the things I do
Lookin' out and I wonder 'bout the things I do

Drinkin' my Seagrams
I got this I don't need friends
You taught me that I need them
'Cause everything come back around, babe

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
You be plantin' or plantain

[Post-Chorus]
When you got me feelin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, bang
When you got me feelin' like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang
