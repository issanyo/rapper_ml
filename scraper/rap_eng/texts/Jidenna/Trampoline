You ain’t even gotta vent

Or the daughter of the reverend
Or the daughter of the president
...aahhhhhhh

You think different, it’s different, you on one
B-Bar-tender - I need me anotha one

[Bridge]
Things I do, don’t don’t worry about the things I do

[Verse]
Need to be free more
What the fuck we got degrees for?
If we ain’t flying overseas more
If we ain’t fucking on the seashore
If we ain’t puffing on the breeze more
Getting cheese more
Stripper tease more
Man I got a little but I need more
Need to leave this bitch like a senior
What we get green for?
If we ain’t tryna go and see more
Champagnin’ with the team more
Congratulations nigga we won!
I been feeling stuck like a Uber with the child lock on the side door
If we ain’t live to die for it
Going eye to eye to eye for it

[Bridge]
Things I do, don’t don’t worry about the things I do
Aww the things I do, don’t don’t worry about the things I do
And not knowing when the shit ain’t funny
And don’t ask why my shirt get bloody
And don’t ask where I get my honey
Don’t ask where I get my muthafuckin’ money

[Chorus]
The lady ain’t a tramp
Just cuz she bounce it up and down like a trampoline
Just cuz she bounce it up and down like a trampoline (like a trampoline)
Just cuz she bounce it up and down like a trampoline
A trampoline

[Outro]
Oh no the lady ain’t a tramp
She just be knowing what she wanting
Oh no the lady ain’t a tramp
She just be knowing what she wanting
She just be knowing what she wanting
She just be knowing what she wanting (like a trampoline)
She just be knowing what she wanting
She just be knowing what she wanting (like a trampoline)

Biology Interlude

[Uncle Palmwine]
Look let me tell you
Let me tell you something you don’t know
You see, some women, they have a short range in their womb
Some men too, they also have a short range
Because when their sperm shoots out like this
OOOM
It doesn’t go far, it goes very slow, as a tortoise
So as you are sexing the woman
MMmbukatu MMbukatu
The woomb opens like this
WHOOOSH
Are you getting me? Very good
Now, if the womb close the sperm remain outside
You can never impregnate your wife
We are now speaking on a typical, you know practical, biological something
You know? That’s what I’m teaching you
Are you getting me?
A woman will move for another man and have a child for that man
Like they will jump from one man to another just have to have a child for that man
Eh?
Who is calling me?
Oh, my wife
Ma ay!
I’m coming! I’m coming! I’m on the way; just give me some time...
