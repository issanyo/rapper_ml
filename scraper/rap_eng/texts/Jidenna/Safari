[Intro]
Aa ra bap ba ba ba da da ah
Ba da bop ba ba ba da da ah
Ba da bop ba ba ba da da
Ba da bop ba ba ba

[Verse 1]
We all on a totem pole
Some are high and some are low, in their soul
Lord let me know
Is there something I should know?
Let me know!
Shit’s getting weird now
Goin’ down the rabbit hole
Feel a little whisper
See the animal in your soul
And we sound like hyenas
Anybody seen my phone?
Feel better here with Sheena
I’m gonna keep her close

[Chorus]
Bookmarks all up in Safari
They don’t want me going too far
Bookmarks all up in Safari
Cuz my old jawns tryna keep tabs on me
Yeah my old jawns tryna keep tabs on me
Don’t worry bout the cost cuz the tab’s on me
Shots for the tribe cuz the tabs on me
Even feds want a shot, keeping tabs on me
It’s getting wild - Safari
Yeah the shit getting wild - Safari
And we blowin’ on loud - Safari
Cause the shit’s getting wild - Safari
Safari

[Verse 2]
I was out there in Safari, livin’
I was out there acting naughty, sinnin’
Givin’ you a L is a hobby, winnin’
Then I dive down in her body, swimmin’
And we don’t wanna think
We just wanna dance all round the fire naked
We just wanna drank fornicatin’ in the wild
We just wanna loudy up with the freedom of our childhood
Cowabunga!
Baby we ain't gettin no younger
It get wild in the land down under
And in the wild every woman is a hunter
And do you want ta?
Do you wanna take a trip with us?
Mushroom tea gettin’ lit wit us
It's ok baby you can strip wit us
No one gonna know what you did with us

[Chorus]
Bookmarks all up in Safari
They don’t want me going too far
Bookmarks all up in Safari
Cuz my old jawns tryna keep tabs on me
Yeah my old jawns tryna keep tabs on me
Don’t worry bout the cost cuz the tabs on me
Shots for the tribe cuz the tabs on me
Even feds want a shot, keeping tabs on me
It’s getting wild - Safari
Yeah the shit getting wild - Safari
And we blowin’ on loud - Safari
Cause the shit’s getting wild - Safari
Safari

[Bridge]
Tonight she gonna try something for the very first time
Tonight she might do her very first crime
Aa ra bap ba ba ba da da ah
Ba da bop ba ba ba da da ah
Ba da bop ba ba ba da da ah
Ba da bop ba ba ba da da ah

[Chorus (Abridged)]
It’s getting wild - Safari
Yeah the shit getting wild - Safari
And we blowin’ on loud - Safari
Cause the shit’s getting wild - Safari
Safari
