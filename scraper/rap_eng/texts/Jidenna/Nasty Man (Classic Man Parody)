[Intro: Futuristic]
Ah, I just farted in the booth, it freaking stinks
I'm a nasty man
I'm a nasty man
You're ready, Jakob? Let's do it

[Hook: Futuristic]
I don't even know her name
But I eat it anyway (Get over here)
In my shirt there's hella stains
Cause I wear it everyday, yeah

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yeah, nasty with the flow though
Making pizza with my feet in Kansas, todo
Get it? Spit hit the ground like a yo-yo
I like to watch MILF porn in slow-mo'
Oooh, if I'm jerking I ain't talking dancing
I just Googled the boobs of Marilyn Manson
I met Bam Margera and depantsed him
I got a lot of pubic hair, tell me, is it handsome?
You know I'm farting on the first date
If we race to the car you know I'm getting first place
I cook terrible
The smell of my underwear is unbearable
I'll probably embarrass you
Don't watch that, febreze that shit
Manners at the table, who needs that shit?
Pick my nose on the low, they never see that shit
If I'm hungry then I might just eat that shit

[Hook: Futuristic & Jakob Owens]
I'm a nasty man
Chilling on the couch with my hands in my pants
I'm a nasty man
You know I have sex with all my female fans
I'm a nasty man
When I finish cooking dinner, let my dog clean the pan
I'm a nasty man
I'm not a classic man

[Verse 2: Jakob Owens]
I poop with the door open
I don't really care if it stinks
Dirty dishes stacked in the sink (Zach, do the dishes)
Flies everywhere, yeah, the stench really reeks
I ain't never brush my teeth
I ain't take a shower in the last few weeks
I ain't never wipe between my cheeks
Dirty ass hands when I dap all my peeps

[Hook: Futuristic & Jakob Owens]
I'm a nasty man
Chilling on the couch with my hands in my pants
I'm a nasty man
You know I have sex with all my female fans
I'm a nasty man
When I finish cooking dinner, let my dog clean the pan
I'm a nasty man
I'm not a classic man

I don't even know her name
But I eat it anyway
In my shirt there's hella stains
Cause I wear it everyday, yeah

[Verse 3: Jakob Owens]
I'm spitting candy bars with raisins in them
Cause my rhymes are sharp, gassing on the track
I ain't even fart but it stinks in here
Haven't showered in a week, fungus on my feet
I'm a nasty man, lotion now beating on my meat
Skeet, skeet on your track, cause that shit is wack
Hot bars, that's a fact, sweat dripping of my sacks
Snapchat your breasts, can I take a peek?
Check me out on YouPorn, I mean YouTube
Your lyrics stinks like my dogs' poo-poo...
