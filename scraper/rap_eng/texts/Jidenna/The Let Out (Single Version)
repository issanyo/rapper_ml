[Verse 1: Jidenna]
Every time I pull up at the let out it’s a spectacle
Heard the shit was jumpin’ like the wall that border Mexico
This the only time we on time and on schedule
Collars on the shirt niggas trying to look respectable
Then I spot her with the fur and ice like an Eskimo
Stretching out my cash so I’m hoping that she flexible
Shorties swinging purses and niggas swinging testicles
Eating fast food but we smoking on a vegetable
She looking man, She looking man
Go hook her man, Go hook her man
And that lame tryna holler he a Bond wanna-be
He a Roger Moore nigga I’m a Sean Connery, I know
Now you looking at a man that's on a mission
Blind-sided cause your man don’t got no vision
Enemies tryna pack us in a prison
But we gon’ pack up in that old Honda Civic

[Pre-Chorus: Nana Kwabena]
Yeah, yeah
All hunt and all prey
Yeah, yeah
Why they looking at the wave
Yeah, yeah
Y'all can bring it our way
Yeah, yeah
But aww no you won’t, aww no you won’t

[Chorus: Jidenna]
Yeah I’m running late so just meet me at the let out
Y’all tryna get in but I’m tryna get out
Niggas getting robbed, get shot at the let out
Heels in her hand while she leaving out the let out
I’ma meet my mans at the mothafuckin' let out
Preying on a fox, yeah a fox with her tail out
Ooh I can’t wait, I can’t wait until they get out
We be fresh as hell when we meet up at the let out

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I ain't givin' these niggas no points just a shut out
I bet I take your hoe right after they let her out
I'm the boss, the huncho walkin' with my chest out
I got 3 mill in cash stash it away in the guest house
I'm runnin' so late, I'm runnin' so late, I go get the money and shake
Soon as I pull up we run out the let out, we don't got time to debate
Throwin' cash off stage, supportin' the minimum wage
Gotta let my wings fly, if you let me out the cage
If I ever go to jail, I'ma bail out
Then we gotta pipe it up at the let out
Latifah the queen we set it off
We don't want the deal, the bet is off
Just throw me the ball we hit it off
You say we gon get where we started off

[Pre-Chorus: Nana Kwabena]
Yeah, yeah
All hunt and all prey
Yeah, yeah
Why they looking at the wave
Yeah, yeah
Y'all can bring it our way
Yeah, yeah
But aww no you won’t, aww no you won’t

[Chorus: Jidenna]
Yeah I’m running late so just meet me at the let out
Y’all tryna get in but I’m tryna get out
Niggas getting robbed, get shot at the let out
Heels in her hand while she leaving out the let out
I’ma meet my mans at the mothafuckin' let out
Preying on a fox, yeah a fox with her tail out
Ooh I can’t wait, I can’t wait until they get out
We be fresh as hell when we meet up at the let out

[Bridge: Jidenna]
Broke niggas met up at the let out
Tryna get in, we tryna get out
We used to meet up at the let out
On the fox with her tail out
Ooh, we can’t wait until they get out
Ooh, we fresh as hell at the let out
Woah, we used to meet up at the let out
Woah, broke niggas at the let out

[Chorus: Jidenna]
Yeah I’m running late so just meet me at the let out
Y’all tryna get in but I’m tryna get out
Niggas getting robbed, get shot at the let out
Heels in her hand while she leaving out the let out
I’ma meet my mans at the mothafuckin' let out
Preying on a fox, yeah a fox with her tail out
Ooh I can’t wait, I can’t wait until they get out
We be fresh as hell when we meet up at the let out

[Outro: Jidenna]
I’m at the let out
I’m at the let out now
We tryna get out
We tryna get out now
