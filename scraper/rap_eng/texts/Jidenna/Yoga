[Intro]
Let yo booty do that yoga

[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe]
Party at the beach down in Copacabana
Sipping Killepitsch, got my black yoga pants on
Me and Brittany, we’ve been down in Atlanta
Sweating in the club, call me Dirty Diana
Flexing like a yogi, drop it down with your hands up
Do a handstand, bend it back, put your legs up
I ain’t got no worries, I’m my own private dancer
My own private dancer

[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga
Flex it (yoga)
Flex it (yoga)

[Verse 2: Janelle Monáe]
Crown on my head, but the world on my shoulder
I'm too much a rebel, never do what I’m supposed ta
Bend it never break it, baby watch and I’ma show ya
Stretching on my cash, got my money doing yoga
Sometimes I'm PG, and sometimes I'm vulgar
Even when I’m sleeping, I got one eye open
You cannot police me, so get off my areola
Get off my areola

[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga
Flex it (yoga)
Flex it (yoga)

[Verse 3: Jidenna]
I said yoga, she did that yoga
Looking for my loafers, man I woke up in a toga
She left my collar on like she my owner
So when she downward dog, I jump up on her
I lo-lo-love the way you bend
Oh Lord, I’d love to break you in
Oh Lord, I’d stretch you out and in
Oh Lord, now you should tell a friend
Oh Lord, I pray, pray, I pray they come, come, come on over
And let they bum-bum do that yoga

[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga
Flex it (yoga)
Flex it (yoga)

[Outro]
Let yo booty do that yoga
