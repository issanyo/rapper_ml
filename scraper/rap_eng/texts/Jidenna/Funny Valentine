[Intro]
You make everything...

[First Verse]
Girl I adore you
Let me show you
That I wanna love you
Do anything for you

[Pre-Chorus]
But the burden's so heavy
Sometime I wanna say

[Chorus]
Stoppin' is the best place to start
Quit playin' games with my heart
Quit playin' games with my heart
Grow up and just play your part
Stoppin' is the best place to start
Quit playin' games with my heart

[Second Verse]
Girl I really think I love you
I'm thinkin' of you
I feel a way about you
I think I love you (yeah-yeah)

[Chorus]
(One more time) Stoppin' is the best place to start
Quit playin' games with my heart

[Third Verse]
Baby, I miss the way you do me
And lately, I wish I could've told you
I daydream, I wanna love you right
So lay your head on my heart
Take every bit of my love

[Bridge]
I miss the way you love me
(So kiss me) So kiss me
(So kiss me) Forgive me
Cause I regret never showin' you
You make everything I am ok
So kiss me (you make everything I am ok)

[Chorus]
Stoppin' is the best place to start
Quit playin' games with my heart

[Outro]
You di-did it
Ohhh you did it (with my heart)
You di-did it (ohh again, with my heart)
You di-did it (yeah)

[Chorus]
Stoppin' is the best place to start
Quit playin' games with my heart (yeah)
