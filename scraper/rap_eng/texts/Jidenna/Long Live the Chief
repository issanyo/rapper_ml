[Hook]
Niggas fighting over rings
Niggas wanna be the King, but
Long Live the Chief
For a li' ol' thang lil' boys bang bang
Long Live the Chief
Niggas fighting over rings
Niggas wanna be the king, but
Long Live the Chief
Yeah watch pretty mama while I slang my cane
Long Live the Chief
Uh

[Verse]
Cockroaches and the rat shit
Hand me downs with the patches
Mama put a little money in the mattress
Taught me how to make a silver spoon out of plastic
You can either sink, swim or be the captain
Get the last word I'mma get the last laugh in
Now they say "Jidenna why you dressing so classic?"
I don’t want my best dressed day in a casket
You can either lead, follow or get out the way
Make a fuckin' move it would make my fuckin' day
Got a 100 year plan you jus' think about today
Always been about time more than been about pay
Can't rump with me
Usain couldn’t run with me
Chief come to find you
You don’t come for me
At best you can run a lil' company
Nigga at worst, I could run the whole country
That's right - pimp game like a brothel 
That's why - I don’t judge a nigga's hustle 
I Airbnb the crib like a hostel 
Summer rate cheaper 'cause the streets get hostile
Shaka boy, this fire from Mojave boy
So no I won’t record for your homie boy 
I turn the party out like a naughty toy
Then I go and hide in plain sight like a lobby boy
Yessuh, that's Jidenna on the banner
Ridin' for my niggas gettin' locked up in the slammer
Elders saying everything's a nail to a hammer
And niggas can’t spell but we know our Instagrammar
Well done's better than well said
I read niggas well, a nigga well read
Really I ain't met nobody smarter
That's why I got admitted but I still rejected Harvard
I’m the fresh prince, in a school where they couldn’t read
Mama put me in a school with the Kennedys
When I met Bill Clinton I was seventeen
But dead presidents is all my niggas need
Dining with the governor's daughter
And her father say I remind him of Obama
I’m the chief diplomat...every day
And I’m black and white...Janelle Monae

Now watch pretty mama while I slang my cane
