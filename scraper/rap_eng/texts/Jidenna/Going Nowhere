[Verse 1]
Hands in the air like I don't care
Running free, just being me
Going nowhere
We're lying down side by side
Don't make a sound, enjoy the ride
G-Going nowhere

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes, you touch my thigh
We're holding hands, cancel plans
Going nowhere
Took me with you, a dream come true
Don't tell a lie or it's goodbye
We ain't going nowhere

[Bridge]
What goes around, somehow comes back around
You hold the crown and now we ain't going nowhere
I feel something different every moment that I'm with ya
Like Summer in November, everything yo do is brilliant
You're mine, we ain't going nowhere, nowhere
