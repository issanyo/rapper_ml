[Chorus]
Adaora

I adore ya

[Verse 1]
I give her my all
Before anybody thought I would ever be star
When she had nothing when we had nothing at all
I never let a women come in that deep in my heart
We’re taking everybody on
Anybody hangin’ by they lonesome
If anybody wanna get it on soon
Eenie meenie miney where you wanna go?
I’mma gonna go where the night take me
Anybody comin’ from the dark side
Anybody comin’ from a lullaby
Ain’t nobody know where your heart lie

[Chorus]
Adaora
Adaora
Adaora
I adore ya
Adaora
Adaora
Adaora
I adore ya

[Post-Chorus]
I A-doreya doreya doreya doreya doreya doreya doreya
I A-doreya doreya doreya doreya doreya
(I give her my all)
I A-doreya doreya doreya doreya doreya doreya doreya
I A-doreya doreya doreya doreya doreya
(I give her my all)

[Verse 2]
I give her my all
I’m running out of days I’m giving, I’m giving my all
But she got to give it man, she got to give a little more
I never let a woman come in that deep in my heart
Wooo yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Anybody hangin’ by they lonesome
If anybody wanna get it on soon
Eenie meenie miney where you wanna go?
I’mma gonna go where the night take me
Anybody comin’ from the dark side
Anybody comin’ from a lullaby
Ain’t nobody know where your heart lie

[Chorus]
Adaora
