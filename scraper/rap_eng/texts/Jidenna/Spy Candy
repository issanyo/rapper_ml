[Verse 1]
In a hotel with a broken glass
I fell in love with a perfect ass
This kind of love ain't built to last
You know it, you know it
Watch me (watch me)
Judge me (judge me)
I need you to love me (love me)
Stalk me (stalk me)
Fuck me (fuck me)
You follow me, I am your Spy Candy
We can't escape the famous life candy
You're so sweet (so sweet)

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna follow
Spy candy
You spy on me sometimes
I spy on you sometimes
Everybody wanna follow
Spy candy
You spy on me sometimes
I spy on you sometimes

[Verse 2: Tiwa Savage]
I saw you went home for the holidays
With your brand new car and your brand new baby
And that'll be your first love since I went away
You know it (you know it)
You know it (you know it)
You know it
Caught you (caught you)
I peeped you (see you)
We know the same people (we do)
It's hard to (hard to)
See you (see you)
You cannot hide, you are my spy candy
We can't escape the famous life, Candy
And you're so sweet (so sweet)

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna follow
Spy candy
You spy on me sometimes
I spy on you sometimes
Everybody wanna follow
Spy candy
You spy on me sometimes
I spy on you sometimes

[Verse 3]
I know you think that I'm a little paranoid and hot headed
But all our pillowtalk it had better stay on our feathers
Ever since the fame, baby, I can only trust you
There ain't no secrets these days
We all be spying and we all betray
I wish that I was traveling the earth with you, baby
I only travel with you in the virtual, baby
You poppin' up when I don't even search for you, baby
I should prolly turn off all my alerts for you, baby
But no

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna follow
Spy candy
You spy on me sometimes
I spy on you sometimes
Everybody wanna follow
Spy candy
You spy on me sometimes
I spy on you sometimes

[Outro]
It's okay, it's okay because I do it too, baby
Yeah, I do it too, baby
Ooooh
