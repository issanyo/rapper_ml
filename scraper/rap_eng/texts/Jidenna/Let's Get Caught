[Verse 1: Deep Cotton]
(Where the women at? Shit.)
Ah, baby, make me kneel
Maybe I should  pray to you
A lover that I can't deny
We're making love, my soul cries
Pick up the phone
Send all the photos
It's just nasty what you do
And I'm coming for you
And when we bang I can hear the sound
Of all the angels singing
Us making love

[Bridge]
And now you want me
To make you wetter than the sea
Oh ooh-wee
I want you too
Oh-oh-oh me and you
I want you
Baby let's get caught

[Hook (x2)]
Let's get caught uptown
Upside down, downtown
I want to go
I want to go with you

[Verse 2]
Lover, won't you take me, please?
Show your ass while you touch your knees
Darling, we would get along
Babe, I want to hear you moan
And yeah, I know, I lost my cool
But baby how I made it through
Lord, since you came right down
Now turn around
My pretty lamb

[Bridge]
And now you want me
To make you wetter than the sea
Oh ooh-wee
I want you too
Oh-oh-oh me and you
I want you
Baby let's get caught

[Hook (x2)]
Let's get caught uptown
Upside down, downtown
I want to go
I want to go with you

[Verse 3: Jidenna]
And do you remember?
Do you remember the feeling of nigga
Just going gorilla?
And then rocking Manila?
Like when no one could feel us
You were shaking villas
Going to dinner
Out thrilling the thrillers
You were wearing chinchilla
Oh-oh, baby
I see you
I see you me and you
Dreaming, scheming, living to the PGs
And it's heaven on TV
And then your man calls and I'm jealous
You and I
We were Adam and Eve
In the darkness of a river
And yeah, you were my thriller

[Hook (x2)]
(Oh)
Let's get caught uptown
(Do you believe in my love?)
Upside down, downtown
I want to go
(I want to go)
I want to go with you

(I want to go)
Let's get caught uptown
(Do you believe in my love?)
Upside down, downtown
I want to go
I want to go with you

(My love)
(Do you believe?)
(Do you believe in my love?)
