[Verse 1]
Bought a new pair of pants, my knickers
Papa got a brand new dance, my knickers
Wanna cuff, wanna hem my knickers
In the school they be tryna suspend my knickers
Their whole style, it depends on knickers
Y'all wanna talk, wanna dance like knickers
Fuck a mule, I want the land, my nigga
Villa lookin' like the south side of France, my nigga

[Pre-Hook]
Show up, I show up
All my niggas show up
It's showtime, nigga, show up
Showbiz come to the nigga showin' up

[Hook]
Now we made it
All my niggas been through
Now we made it
I know it's hard for you
To celebrate it
But I just gotta live my lie
I just gotta live my lie
'Til I
Put my knickers on
Put my knickers on
Put my knickers on
Put my knickers on
But I just gotta live my lie
Yeah I just gotta live my lie

[Verse 2]
I think they wanna end my knickers
Discontinue the trend, my knickers
Tryna bleach, tryna blend my knickers
Need to slow clap and command, my knickers
They don't even understand my knickers
Back in the day they used to brand my knickers
And now they wanna ban my niggas
Even though they got a Grammy in their hand, my niggas

[Pre-Hook]
Show up, I show up
All my niggas show up
It's showtime, nigga, show up
Showbiz come to the nigga showin' up

[Hook]
Now we made it
All my niggas been through
Now we made it
I know it's hard for you
To celebrate it
But I just gotta live my lie
I just gotta live my lie
'Til I
Put my knickers on
Put my knickers on
Put my knickers on
Put my knickers on
But I just gotta live my lie
Yeah I just gotta live my lie

[Verse 3]
My nigga
I said woo, this is that sound, my nigga
Burn it down, build a new town, my nigga
Said woo, lost and found, my nigga
Don't sink when they try to drown, my nigga
Oh man, never let me down, my nigga
Never let them ever break you down, my nigga
Bodies in the alleyway
Now police would like a nigga they could put away
They lookin', they lookin', now I got to lay low
They lookin', they lookin', now I got to lay low
So we been lookin' like the Phantom of the Opera
When we drive by, shoulda recognized the reminder
Chiefin', chiefin', nigga, delegate a bigger nigga
Trigger finger make a nigga fly like Wonka
Oh lord now they at it again
Oh lord, black magic again

[Hook]
Now we made it
All my niggas been through
Now we made it
I know it's hard for you
To celebrate it
But I just gotta live my lie
I just gotta live my lie
'Til I
Put my knickers on
I said lady
We really couldn't do without you
Ooh, my baby
Put my knickers on
I said lady
Put my knickers on
But I just gotta live my lie
Yeah I just gotta live my lie
