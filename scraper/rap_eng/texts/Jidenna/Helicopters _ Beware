Helicopters

[Chorus]
They'll shoot you down without warning
When they see you shining bright
In case we don't meet the morning
The crown's on my head tonight
Let them come for me, come for me if they want to
Let my children know what that's about
Let them come for me, come for me if they want to
They gon' make them helicopters come out
None of them go, none of them go, none of them go high
None of them go, none of them go, none of them go high
They gon' make them helicopters come out

[Post-Chorus]
Hella, hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella, hella coppers
They gon' make them helicopters come out

[Verse 1]
I don't fuck around, don't play no games
I'mma lion king awimbawe
I got one eye open while I pray
If they come for me, it's Bumaye

[Pre-Chorus]
Chief gon' talk that shit like yeah, yeah
Walkin' up in that bitch like yeah, yeah
Niggas gon' get lit like yeah, yeah
But a chief don't, chief don't run
I'll be here when you come out

[Chorus]
They'll shoot you down without warning
When they see you shining bright
In case we don't meet the morning
The crown's on my head tonight
Let them come for me, come for me if they want to
Let my children know what that's about
Let them come for me, come for me if they want to
They gon' make them helicopters come out

[Post-Chorus]
Hella, hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella, hella coppers
They gon' make them helicopters come out

[Verse 2]
And I tell them boys don't run away
When a ghetto bird come 'round my way
I done seen 'em kill 'em in broad day
If I die, today's my holiday

[Pre-Chorus]
Chief gon' talk that shit like yeah, yeah
Walkin' up in that bitch like yeah, yeah
Niggas gon' get lit like yeah, yeah
But a chief don't, chief don't run
I'll be here when you come out

[Chorus]
They'll shoot you down without warning
When they see you shining bright
In case we don't meet the morning
The crown's on my head tonight
Let them come for me, come for me if they want to
Let my children know what that's about
Let them come for me, come for me if they want to
They gon' make them helicopters come out

[Post-Chorus]
Hella, hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella coppers wanna chop us, chop us, chop us
Hella, hella coppers
They gon' make them helicopters come out
