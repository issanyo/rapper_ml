You know me
Rie on the mic
I don't want every bitch to be my wife
Take a guess, you might know why
Cause sometime I'd get an STI oh

My dick like no way, my dick like noway
My dick like no way, my dick like noway

What they say?
I'm a trashy man
Cause I smoke weed and I sip that lean
I'm a trashy man
Cause I'd serve fiends just to get that green
I'm a trashy man
On the side of the street when the feds see me
I be dashing man
Yeah fuck it, I'm a trashy man
You know they get so mad
When they seeing all this swag
Cause the bitches mistaking them
For their fucking dads
Ha, yeah I'm a young ma'fucker
So I'm gonna dress like one ma'fucker
And if you got something wrong ma'fucker
You can tell it to the end of my gun ma'fucker

He be like noway, he be like noway
He be like noway, he be like noway

What I do?
I make it tragic man
I've been obscene since I turned 14
Make it tragic man
Ay, R.I.E on ya' goddamn beat
I make it tragic man
If I catch you in the street, tie your hands to your feet
Make you vanish man
Yeah you can call it magic man

And this is Bloodlust 2, Bloodlust 2
This is Bloodlust 2, Bloodlust 2
This is Bloodlust 2, Bloodlust 2
This is Bloodlust 2, Bloodlust 2
And I am R.I.E hoe
