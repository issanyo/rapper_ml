[Verse 1: Jidenna]
Every time I pull up at the let out it's a spectacle
Heard the shit was jumpin' like the wall that border Mexico
This the only time we on time and on schedule
Collars on the shirt, niggas tryna look respectable
Then I spot her with the fur and ice like an Eskimo
Stretchin' out my cash so I'm hopin' that she flexible
Shawties swingin' purses, and niggas swingin' testicles
Eatin' fast food but we smoking on the vegetables
She lookin' man, She lookin' man
Go hook her man, Go hook her man
And that lame tryna holla, he a Bond wannabe
He a Roger Moore nigga, I'm a Sean Connery, I know
Now you lookin' at a man that's on a mission
Blindsided 'cause your man don't got no vision
Enemies tryna pack us in a prison
But we gon' pack up in that old Honda Civic

[Pre-Chorus: Nana Kwabena]
Yeah, yeah
All hunt and all prey
Yeah, yeah
Why they looking at the wave?
Yeah, yeah
Y'all can bring it our way
Yeah, yeah
But aww no you won't, aww no you won't

[Chorus: Jidenna]
Yeah I'm running late, so just meet me at the let out
Y'all tryna get in but I'm tryna get out
Niggas getting robbed, get shot at the let out
Heels in her hand while she leaving out the let out
I'ma meet my mans at the mothafuckin' let out
Preying on a fox, see a fox with her tail out
Ooh I can't wait, I can't wait until they get out
We be fresh as hell when we meet up at the let out

[Verse 2: Jidenna]
My team, fucking with the wrong team
I fiend, and she the back of Walgreens
My genes, shall pollinate the God's green
Yah mean? And get her on the box spring
Show me, show me, can't nobody get it
Show me, show me, can't nobody hit it
Show me, show me, baby don't tell
Show baby, don't you run and go tell

[Pre-Chorus: Nana Kwabena]
Yeah, yeah
All hunt and all prey
Yeah, yeah
Why they looking at the wave?
Yeah, yeah
Y'all can bring it our way
Yeah, yeah
But aww no you won't, aww no you won't

[Chorus: Jidenna]
Yeah I'm running late, so just meet me at the let out
Y'all tryna get in but I'm tryna get out
Niggas getting robbed, get shot at the let out
Heels in her hand while she leaving out the let out
I'ma meet my mans at the mothafuckin' let out
Preying on a fox, see a fox with her tail out
Ooh I can't wait, I can't wait until they get out
We be fresh as hell when we meet up at the let out

[Bridge: Jidenna]
Broke niggas met up at the let out
Tryna get in, we tryna get out
We used to meet up at the let out
On a fox with her tail out
Ooh, we canâ€™t wait until they get out
Ooh, we fresh as hell at the let out
Woah, we used to meet up at the let out
Woah, broke niggas at the let out

[Chorus: Jidenna]
Yeah I'm running late, so just meet me at the let out
Y'all tryna get in but I'm tryna get out
Niggas getting robbed, get shot at the let out
Heels in her hand while she leaving out the let out
I'ma meet my mans at the mothafuckin' let out
Preying on a fox, see a fox with her tail out
Ooh I can't wait, I can't wait until they get out
We be fresh as hell when we meet up at the let out

[Outro: Jidenna]
I'm at the let out
I'm at the let out now
We tryna get out
We tryna get out now
