No, no, no, no
Mmm, mmm
No, don’t come near me
No, don’t come near me
No, no

I thought of leaving
I want the key
I wanted what
I want it all
I want the lid
She got a grievance
She want the key
She want the key
She want the car
She want the crib
It might be, it might be about that
My moves need to be about that
Body pulling me to fuel you
Try to leave ya, but I still don’t go

Even if I wanted to
I come back around
Even if I wanted to
I come back and we just go around, babe

Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can’t believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
If you planting or plantain

Boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, bang
Doing like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang

A girl no need to pretend
A girl no need to pretend
A girl no need to pretend
She want key
She want the car
She want the crib

It might be, it might be about that
My moves need to be about that
Body pulling me to fuel you
Try to leave ya, but I still don’t go

Even if I wanted to
I come back around
Even if I wanted to
I come back and we just go around, babe

Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can’t believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
If you planting a plantain

I don’t mind it being like

Boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, bang
Doing like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang

Looking out of a window ’bout the things I knew
Looking out of a window ’bout the things I knew

Drinking my Seagrams
Got peace like we need friends
I look down and I need them
‘Cause everything come back around, babe

Bang, bang, boomerang
Do you love or hate me now, babe
Bang, bang, boomerang
I can’t believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
If you planting a plantain

I don’t mind it being like

Boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, bang
Doing like boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang
