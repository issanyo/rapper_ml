Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire, we the best my nigga
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire, we blessed my nigga
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire, ain't nobody around here that's ordinaire
Baby I'm extraordinaire

[Verse 1]
We walk through that village square and broken glass is everywhere
People pissing in the stairs, they hang their head down in despair
We are here, we are here, they can feel it in the air
We are here, we are here, we are so extraordinaire

Round the way they did appear some debutante and debonaires
Well at least that's what it seemed 'til we shot clouds up in the air
We are rare, we are rare, Momma told us we are rare
We are rare, we are rare, we were born extraordinaire

[Hook]
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire, we the best my nigga
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire, we blessed my nigga
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire, ain't nobody around here that's ordinaire
Baby I'm extraordinaire

[Refrain]
Extraordinaire (e e e e e e e e, oh, e e e, oh, e)
Extraordinaire (e e e e e e e e, oh, e e e, oh, e)

[Verse 2]
They push strollers in the midnight as if Jim Crow disappeared
Yoga mats are on their back, they walk around without a care
We are here, we are here, they don't want us so we're here
We are here, we are here, always been extraordinaire

Found our swag when we were young, we're on the run to millionaires
We fly all over Zamunda, we got land out over there
We are rare, we are rare, yeah, my dame is hella rare
We are rare, we are rare, we were born extraordinaire

[Hook]
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire, we the best my nigga
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire, we blessed my nigga
Extraordinaire

Baby I'm extraordinaire

[Refrain]
Extraordinaire (e e e e e e e e, oh, e e e, oh, e)
Extraordinaire (e e e e e e e e, oh, e e e, oh, e)

[Bridge]
Told you niggas from the start, they looking at you
All you niggas fall apart, they looking at you
Looking at me, not looking at me
They looking at you, they looking at you
Looking at me, not looking at me
They looking at you, at you...
Told you niggas from the start, they looking at you
All you niggas fall apart, they looking at you
Looking at me, not looking at me
They looking at you, they looking at you
Looking at me, not looking at me
They looking at you, at you...
