[Intro]
Marco, Polo
See you were supposed to be the Polo to my Marco
But I'm starting to think you not coming my nigga
Where the fuck you at
I texted, I facetimed, I hit up Nana
You got me hitting up other people like "yo where you at"
I been waiting at Maputo for 14
14 motherfuckin' hours
Catose
Like, you got me missing Afropunk
I woulda flew out the day after Afropunk
Got me missing Solange. Really? Solange?
Like a seat at the table
You got me not at the table cause you not here right now?
W'ap konn Jòj!
Koun ye-a, W'ap konn Jòj!, Koun ye-a
Paske koun ye-a wap ese femn tun'e ou lot moun koun ye-a
Polo your ass back on this voicemail, Bitch
Love you though

[Verse 1]
With a snapback and a suit on like it's draft day
Draft day, draft day
She said when I get home it's like bubble bath day
Bath day, bath day
Already broke a glass of the champagne
Champagne, champagne
Is it plantin, platanos or plantain?
Plantain
She ready for the weekend
We goin' Mozambican
Black passports, we ain't takin' meetings
Don't gotta lotta life, for a lotta words
And when they call her (bitch)
Is when I'm proud of hers
Chiefy, chiefy, chiefa, now I vape my reefer
That shit be too loud, shit could blow a speaker
Chiefy, chiefy, chiefa, that's my queen of shisha
She my Smokahontas, but they just see a diva
Move into the light, into the starlight
Everybody likes it in the starlight
She used to live a life of many bar fights
And dress in all white like Madam Albright

[Chorus]
Decibels, decibels
Smoke loud, move loud, too proud
They tell her pipe it down, but she made
Decibels, decibels
Smoke loud, move loud, too proud

[Verse 2]
Soap suds cover up that Nefertitti
Nefertitti, Nefertitti
Aphrodisiac and she my Aphrodite
Aphrodite, Aphrodite
Voodoo lady give 'em niggas heebie jeebies
Heebie jeebies
Wicked witches freakin' in my teepee, teepee
Teepee, teepee, teepee, teepee
Uh, fuckin' with the wrong, with the wrong niggas
You can't work a con with no con-fidence
Make my money long, fuck 'em small digits
Too busy grabbing your balls to ball with us
I don't just want this for myself like
I'll merge with ya if a nigga nice
Look at how Allah made the sky, yeah
Big enough for all the birds to fly, yeah
But fuck a breadcrumb, bitch
Suit bespoke and I ain't said shit
We living life out loud
She piped up when they tell her pipe down

[Chorus]
Decibels, decibels
Smoke loud, move loud, too proud
They tell her pipe it down, but she made
Decibels, decibels
Smoke loud, move loud, too proud
