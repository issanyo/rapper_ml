[Hook]
He say he want a quarter blow for the low
But this go high, the streets dry so hit the door
My nigga you gotta go
'Cause I ain't trying to hear that shit
I ain't trying to hear that shit (Yeeahh)
She say she wanna hit the room with your boy
But then she broke, just wanna fuck
What the fuck, fucking bitch you gotta go
'Cause I ain't trying to hear that shit
I ain't trying to hear that shit (Yeeahh)

[Verse 1]
Minae done make dollars
Minae done make cents
If we ain't talking about cash
Then we ain't talking about shit
Everyday not promising, I'm getting money and ball
Take care of your family, take care of your dogs
Ain't no use in just doing stupid shit because you can
Why just be a doughboy when you can be the big man?
I try so hard to get rich
I ain't thinking about no bitch
Because when I through smashing her, I'm like "What did I get?"
So I continue to grind
I'm going hard for my kids, and then I pay baby mamas
On top of feeding my kids and then my whole squad nigga
My team depending on me, if I ain't buying the sack
Then how the fuck we gonna eat?
Nigga, how the fuck we gonna eat?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Thinking it might be fatal, so I'm going dumb hard
I got a woman at home, she sit and wait for the call
So I keep my protection
And thank god for blessing me, I could've been a dead nigga
Broke, fucked up, I'm telling ya
So with that being said, I'm very cautious on trust
I don't trust nobody, I don't believe in luck
Everything that's happening is suppose to happen for real
Yeah, I'm on life insurance
Incase a nigga get killed, I gotta make sure [?]
My little family correct, because they can't get social security
I never had a [?], I'm from the streets of Memphis
Where niggas robbing for bags, where niggas stay paranoid
Don't wanna get that toe tag
Don't wanna get that toe tag

[Hook]
