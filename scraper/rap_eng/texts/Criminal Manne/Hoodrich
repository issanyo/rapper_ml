[Verse 1]
Let me talk about ma paper work
Because I got more paperwork than your folks at work
I’m none stop on my hustle like a madman
I gotta make a whole mill before the week ends
Rubber bands need assistance ‘cause I do em bad
Thousand 20s, thousand fifties in ma Louie bag
Box Chevy brand new let yo boy tail it
Sitting on 24 with shorties brand new corralling
Gold grill old school like YDMC
Keep it twinkle so we shine when you see me
Hop in and [?] the hoodrats I’m a block a cheese
I don’t [?] with biny women they be high-class freaks
No head no nothing why they do that at
I like them [?] for sure when they set back
Yo you can catch me right around the bricks
In the hood i’m a trap god I’m hood rich

[Verse 2]
Yo shoe box full of thousand stacks
10 stacks 20 stacks by the hunnid racks
I still got a [?] somewhere on the east side
Rent 5 hunnid a month ay that’s hood right
Don’t get it twisted I just cook there
I don’t go to sleep
One couch a X-Box and a TV
No bed no curtain I got a lot a box
Baking soda by the tons just to bake them blocks
Couple choppers breaching just in case we get jump
Ay I die about respect better have no punks
I see them eat egg sandwich
Partner at the [?]
Sometimes I boil a hot dog before I go hard
Call me this call me cheap I bet you I ain’t broke
I got a grill work the mill and never seeing home
Yo but you can catch me right around the bricks
In the hood only trap good, I’m hoodrich
