(Intro)
Girl are you ready to get wet?
I ain't talking about sweat
Oh baby

(Verse 1)
You want me to be your nigga
LA girls made me like this
They switched and turned me savage
All these girls getting harder to manage
Like, I'm only 22 tryna focus on you
Walk these other females to the exit
Hit you from the back in your favorite spot
Like shorty did you cum
I don't care if I cum, long as you cum
Let me use my tongue
I know what you want

(Hook)
My girl is my girl is with me
She is my girl
If you know you mine
My girl is my girl is with me
She is my girl
She know wassup
I just keep her satisfied through the weekend
Studio nine to five every weekend
We could lose our minds for the weekend
Wednesday Tuesday Thursday
I just have her my way
Think I got it handled for the weekend

(Verse 2)
Gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of you
What I'm saying babe, I really love you naked
You know that ass my favorite
Bounce it for me, baby
Give me both your legs
Baby, say my name
Ima hit you back when I crave it
Just give me what I want, baby

(Hook)
My girl is my girl is with me
Ima make you feel good
So good
Ima beat that pussy on the weekend
Studio nine to five every weekend
Make you lose your mind on the weekend

(Outro)
Let me hit that spot, let me hit that spot baby
Remind her
Know I got you covered for the weekend
Every position we gon try
Ima fuck you baby girl
I can be a freaky ass nigga
You gon be all over me
Ima be all over you
