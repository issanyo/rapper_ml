[Hook]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 1]
I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
Shaped a figure eight, who trust pretty girls anyways?
I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyways?
Not me

[Bridge]
Are you hating yourself?
Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

Was it worth it?
Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? (ohhhh)
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Verse 2]
I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway, spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway?
You're mine any day
It's burning
Take me
I wanna feel
Your power
This final hour
Tell me

[Bridge]
Are you losing yourself?
Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

Was it worth it?
Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? (ohhhh)
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Hook (2X)]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
