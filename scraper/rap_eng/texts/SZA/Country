[Intro]
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale, this here is the epic tale

[Refrain]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Verse 1]
I hear my thoughts, I hear them creep
And into my mind, into my dreams
Voices in my head save me
Untie my hands, untie my feet
So I might fly, so I might fly
I might fly

[Chorus 1]
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind, oh
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind, broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale

[Refrain]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Verse 2]
Like clouds under my feet, I try not to think
Not to feel like I'm stuck in this space, I'm just me
I'm just so much more, so much more, so much
I'm so much more, I feel I'm so much more
(Feel like I'm so much more, more)

[Chorus 2]
One day I’ll live, how I lost my mind
One day if I live to tell the tale
One day if I live, how I lost my mind
One day, one day I’ll live
One day I'll live to tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day I'll live
One day I'll live, I'll tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day I'll live

[Refrain]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Chorus 3]
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be by your side
Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your side
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go nowhere, I'll stay right here
Be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go nowhere, I'll be right her by your

[Outro]
Lost my mind, can't seem to find it, but I'll be here
But I'll be here though
