[Produced by Felix Snow]

Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

Young Medusa
Never sure, i just do
I jumped off the bridge
You say i fell
I say i flew
Missing parachute
Feeling like topanga
Patty mayonnaise
Kind of average
With queen qualities
Got molecules, i possess
Ever more nothing less

[Hook]
I think im starting to feel something
Here in the dark
I think im starting to feel something

[Hook]
Keep burning up
Keep burning up
Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

Broken glass unswept in my mind
Brooms to heavy to bare
Struggles that i find
Confusion
Gravity is relative
Sand castles are still real life
They hold dreams
Like the real ones do
I take care building castles too

[Hook]
