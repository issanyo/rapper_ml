[Verse 1]
You love the way I pop my top
Or how I lose my cool
Or how I look at you
Say why?
It ain't no fighting, no I can't stop it
This took a while, yeah
Love the way I pump my fist or how I bust my hip
For your affection, tryna be down
No fighting and no stoppin'
Stick around

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I was the type of girl you take over to mama
The type of girl, I know my daddy, he'd be proud of
Yeah, uh be proud of, yeah
Uh be proud of, uh be proud, you know, you know
Wanna be the type of girl you take home to your mama
The type of girl, I know your fellas they'd be proud of
Uh be proud of, uh be proud of, uh be proud of, boy you know

[Chorus]
Normal girl, oh
I wish I was a normal girl, oh my
How do I be, how do I be your baby?
Normal girl, oh, oh, oh
I wish I was a normal girl
I'll never be, no, never be uh, oh

[Verse 2]
You like it, when I be, aggressive
You like when I say to you
"Get it if you got it, I'm ready and waitin' for it
I'm callin' to put it on," yeah
Like it when I be aggressive
Love when I say to you
"Get it if you want it, I'm waiting, I'm gonna find you
I'm ready to put it on you," yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Type of girl you wanna take home to mama
Wanna be the type of girl my daddy, he'd be proud of
Uh be proud of, uh be proud of, uh be proud of you know, you know
The type of girl you wanna take her home right up to mama
The kind of girl, I know your fellas, they'd be proud of
I'll be probably, I'll be proud like, I'll be probably a problem, oh, no oh oh ahh
(No fantasy, no fantasy)

[Chorus]
I really wish a was a normal girl
How do I be, how do I be a lady?
Normal girl, ohhh

I'll never be, no never be, uh-yeah

[Bridge]
This time next year I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember your name, I swear
Livin' so good, livin' so good, livin' so good
This time next year I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember no pain, I swear
Before that you figured out, that I was just a normal girl

[Outro]
Normal girl, what do you say now?
We'd own the world, 'cause it ain't going away now
Quit on yourself 'cause you can't figure your way out
Normal girl
How do you be?
