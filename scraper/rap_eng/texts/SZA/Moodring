[Verse 1]
Moodring, (moodring)
Moodring, (moodring)
It can be difficult but sheâ€™s still the same song
Feeling indifferent, I change if you say so

[Hook]
Moodring
I mistook the two of you
Moodring
Whatever you want me to do

[Verse 2]
If you take a little bit
Pulling on the same rope
We fell right into it
I knew there was no hope

[Hook]

[Outro + Instrumental]
Moodring
