[Intro]
I gotta kinda sing it

[Verse 1]
Yo, now ever since I was young, had a gift for the tongue
This shit might open the door (it might open the do')
Fruit loop for the young, honeycomb for some
22 put piff in a bowl (put piff in a bowl)
And I was bending the corners, hot boxin' the sauna
I've been focused gettin' closer to ghosts (gettin' closer to ghosts)
And I be slippin' a bit, probably sippin a bitch
I ain't really into tippin' the hoes
See my brother got weight, my sister at home (yeah yeah)
When I get straight my sister gettin flown (yeah yeah)
Couple nephews, my niggas gettin' grown (yeah yeah)
Mikey D stay down, nigga gettin on (yeah yeah)

Living, wasting my time
Lacing with percs, purp in a bind
Hazy, oh baby, I'm better when blind
I don't see nothin' this perfect can fine (yeah yeah)

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & SZA]
We are the young and Xanax, oh

To hide from the lows
Cause we are the young and Xanax, oh
See, there's nowhere to go
Stuck on the high, yeah

You fuckin' with us, I won't eat (fuckin' with)
Start stomping your feet, I need that
Depending on all of your feedback
Come out to my show and come feed that
Can't go back to sellin' that retail
My daddy left me with no details
Came back with a bitch and his stepson
I guess he forgot that he left somethin'
He must have been saving the best bum (yeah yeah)
