Keep your intentions pure don’t be scared don’t mince words
I don’t mince words
My narcissism keeps me level
Keeps me straight no curve balls
Got no curve balls stay straight here
You wish that I was less than I am
Less than I will be but I won’t
No I won’t
Kismet, serendipity
Reflections
I am him and he is me
Kismet… Serendipity
