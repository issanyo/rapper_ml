[Verse 1]
I'm feeling like
I might take a sip and lose my way tonight
And it really ain't my thing
I might get lost on purpose
Lost on you
And you keep touching surfaces
I'll take you home tonight
Please don't test me I've been on the road tonight
And I'm really feeling myself
I'm lost on you
Lost on purpose
You've been touching surfaces

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want (if you want)
We can leave
I could be irresponsible for you
Possibly got what you want
If you need, I can pretend I'm only yours for you
Down for whatever you need

[Chorus]
Better let me know, better let me know
Better let me know
Better let me know how you feel
Better let me know, better let me know
Better let me know
Down for whatever (how you feel)

[Verse 2]
You been loving undercover with your other lover from the outside
Do you miss me on them other days when she be working late?
I no used to all uh that, I no used to all uh that
Don't ever add me to that
And it's cool daddy, it's cool papi
I'm here if you still needing that
Homie if you still calling that
Low if you still hoping that I'm the same one you knew before

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want (if you want)
We can leave, I could be irresponsible for you
Possibly got what you want (want)
If you need, I can pretend I'm only yours for you
Down for whatever you need

[Chorus]
Better let me know, better let me know
Better let me know
Better let me know how you feel
Better let me know, better let me know
Better let me know
Down for whatever (how you feel)

[Bridge]
I be feeling you even when you ain't around me
I be in a million pieces when you around me
I be missing you even when you be around me 'round me
Better let me know
Better let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want (if you want)
We can leave, I could be irresponsible for you
Possibly got what you want (want)
If you need, I can pretend I'm only yours for you
Down for whatever you need

[Chorus]
Better let me know, better let me know (right now)
Better let me know
Better let me know how you feel
Better let me know, better let me know
Better let me know
Down for whatever

[Outro]
I be feeling you even when you ain't around me
I be in a million pieces when you around me
I be missing you even when you be around me
'round me
Better let me know
Better let me know
