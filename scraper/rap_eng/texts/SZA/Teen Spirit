[Verse 1]
Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me!
To think I had it
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I hear you talking
Creeping on my shoulder
I hear you breathing
In my head I hear you screaming
Just do it..

[Hook]
Yeah yeah, I feel you talking
Yeah yeah I feel you moving
Yeah yeah let's do it already
Yeah yeah..

[Verse 2]
Chipping away at boulders
I conquer fire
40 days 40 nights
No New Star
Fuck your Third Eye
I be the One
Neo of the Sun
Give me simplicity
Too lonely, seems like real fun
I feel you
Creeping up my leg I hear you talking
Moving on my shoulder I hear you breathing
In my head I hear you screaming
Just do it

[Bridge]
Don't come close

You don't even know me, know me
Don't come close
Don't come close
