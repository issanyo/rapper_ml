[Lyrics from Snippet]

(Verse)

Come through, take a bit more
Aren't you, glad i'm destroyed
I have, nothing left for you to rape

Don't think much, of myself
I just, love your hell
Still just, your speed dial whore

(Chorus)

Tell me who you want me to be
Gave you the best of me
Still want the rest of me...
