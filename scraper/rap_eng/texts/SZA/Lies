[Verse 1]
I used to like you the way you were
When you were nice to me
When you were insecure
Found out how dope a nigga you really are
Now you got lots to say
Now you got hoes for days
Where do I fit in?
Now you got everything
Now you so over me
Where do I get in?

[Pre-Chorus]
I mean, can I just come over later?
I'm over worked and under loved
Can't you just do me a favor?
Could you pretend that I'm the one you love?
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Let's pretend that we are more than passing ships in the night
Let's pretend like it's just us
Let's pretend that we are strong enough to  put up a fight
Let's pretend that it's just us

[Verse 2]
I bet you like me the way I was
When I was insecure
I mean, I'm still for sure
I know I'm better than you and know what I deserve
More than the borrowed time
More than nouns and verbs
I wanna be somebody's somebody
I don't want to collect dust in your pocket

[Pre-Chorus]
I mean, can I just come over later?
I'm over worked and under loved
Can't you just do me a favor?
Can you pretend that I'm the one you love?
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Let's pretend that we are more than passing ships in the night
Let's pretend like it's just us
Let's pretend that we are strong enough to put up a fight
Let's pretend that it's just us

[Bridge]
Us, us
Just us, us
Us, us, us
Just, just us
Us, us
Just us, us
Us, us, us
Just, just us

[Chorus]
Let's pretend that we are more than passing ships in the night
Let's pretend like it's just us
Let's pretend that we are strong enough to  put up a fight
Let's pretend that it's just us
