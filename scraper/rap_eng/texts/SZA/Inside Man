[Verse]
Think I spent too much time on you
I rack my brain too many times at night
Bet I’m a breath of fresh air for another nigga
You finna make me go take care of another nigga
Who you playing?
It’s other things up on my mind other than a man
It’s other shit up on my mind like can and
Will I see the world on my own?
I see the world on the tip of my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet it’s easy
It get so easy to take the easy way out
No way out
They said easy
It must be easy to be you
I say "how do you figure when you don’t know me at all?"
At all, at all, at all
It doesn’t matter anyway, ooh
And now-a-days I don’t know you and never could tell if it matters anyway
I’m sure you got it all figured out
And you confident in yourself

[Chorus]
Well I’m tired of being on the outside baby
How can I come on the inside baby?
It looks like you’re good and you got it all
All figured out all by yourself
Well I’m tryna be on the inside baby
How can I come on the inside baby?

[Post-Chorus]
I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh I might play circus for you
How do you want me?
I conjure up that coochie for you
Voodoo, Houdini
And I might be that hoochie for you
Ever you need me to get in between your guidelines
And I slide right in
You could read in between my guidelines
And you fit right in

[Pre-Chorus]
So easy
It get so easy to take the easy way out
No way out
They said easy
It must be easy to be you
I say ‘how do you figure when you don’t know me at all?
At all, at all, at all
It doesn’t matter anyway, ooh
Nowadays I don’t know
You never could tell if it really mattered anyway
Anyway, anyway
I’m sure you got it all figured out
And you comforting yourself

[Chorus]
Well I’m tired of being on the outside baby
How can I come on the inside baby?
It looks like you’re good and you got it all
All figured out all by yourself
Well I’m tryna be on the inside baby
How can I come on the inside baby?

[Post-Chorus]
I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh I might play circus for you
How do you want me?
I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh I might play circus for you
How do you want me?
I conjure up that coochie for you
Voodoo, Houdini
