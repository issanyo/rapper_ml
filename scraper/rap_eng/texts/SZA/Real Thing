[Chorus 1: A$AP Ferg]
What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
We talk about art then end up on sex
We text for hours, you're so complex
Not your average girl in spandex
Who chase Bent-e-leys and Rolex
You wear them baggy jeans like Aaliyah
Your body so mean, I can tell you got a booty like Selena
Girl, you're 'bout to have me catch a fever
I can't lie, I get happy every time a nigga see ya
The way you move, the way you groove
Is so appealing
I'm usually not that dude caught up in all these feelings
I've been around the world and dealt with all these women
Through all these different girls, this is the realest feeling

[Chorus 2: SZA]
I'm tired of the waiting (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it

[Chorus 1: A$AP Ferg]
What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Sort of afrocentric, you been thick
Pearly white teeth like you live at the dentist
Impeccable freckle, you put a spell on niglet
Room full of syringes, she got me addicted
Body authentic, how do you bend it?
Got her too tempted
I don't know how to prevent it
I will go into it, party 'til I go limp dick
Run in that clitoris, like I'm in the Olympics
Swinging that diznick, til it's all in appendix
She be likin' it nasty, I like when you rinse it
Rinse it off like candy rain
Say my name three times like Candyman
Oh, cause our love so so real
That a nigga want to score like Shaquille O'Neal
And she fly like an eagle, so I call her Seal
Let nothing get in between what you feel

[Chorus 2: SZA]
I'm tired of the waiting (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it

[Chorus 1: A$AP Ferg]
What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old
