[Part II: Tender]

[Verse 1: SZA]
Come through take a bit boy
Aren't you glad I'm destroyed
I have nothing left for you to rape
Don't think much of myself
I just love your hell
Still just your speed dial whore
Tell me who you want me to be
Gave you the best of me
Still want the rest of me


I wanna be involved in all your dirt
And I wanna burst
Inside your veins and rain like
Blood all over your face
Like
Cum all over your face

I wanna feel for you
