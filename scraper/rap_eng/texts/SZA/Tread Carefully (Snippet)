[Lyrics from Snippet]

How do you feel?
Fighting your feelings
Scared of your feelings
Living in whiteout I can't see nothin' but you
Staring in my headlights
Gotta get my head right
Damn, I been here all night now

Gotta get my ways together
Gotta gather all my shit
I said I wouldn't stay all night, but it's 7 AM
I'm gonna miss my next meeting fuckin' with you
Guard down fuckin' with you
I'm making bad desicions how I'm livin...
