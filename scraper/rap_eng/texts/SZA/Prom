[Verse 1]
Fearin' not growin' up
Keepin' me up at night
Am I doin' enough?
Feel like I'm wastin' time

[Pre-Chorus]
Promise to get a little
Better as I get older
And you're so patient
And sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Shoulda coulda
Prolly wanna let me go
But you can't, oh
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

[Chorus]
Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please, please
Don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
Darling, like I know you will, ooh

[Verse 2]
Forget to call your mama on the weekend
You should put yourself in time out
(Shame, shame on you)
But lately you've been feelin' so good
I forget my future, never pull out
(Shame, shame on me)
Baby the money'll make it easier for me
To run and hide out somewhere
(So far away)
Hoppin' through poppy fields
Dodgin' evil witches
These houses keep droppin' everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Promise to get a little
Better as I get older
And you're so patient
And sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Shoulda coulda
Prolly wanna let me go
But you can't, oh
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Right now it's really pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

[Chorus]
Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take it, take it personal

[Outro]
Like winters fall on us, heavy
Take it off me, all it off
Winter, I can't stand this
Snow is falling all on me
