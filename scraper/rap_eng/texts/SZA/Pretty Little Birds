[Verse 1: SZA]
You are but a phoenix among feathers
You're broken by the waves among the sea
They'll let you die, they'll let you wash away
But you swim as well as you fly

[Chorus 1: SZA]
Pretty little bird
Pretty little bird
You've hit the window a few times
The window a few times
You're pretty little bird
Pretty little bird
You still ain't scared of no heights
When the spiral down feels as good as the flight
When hating you feels good for the night
When the morning comes I hope you're still mine

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes

[Verse 2: SZA]
Told you I like gentle giants so you softened up
And you been jack'n, bean'n, stalk'n just to get to me love
I wanna be your golden goose
I wanna shave my legs for you
I wanna take all of my hair down and let you lay in it
Spread all of my limbs out and let you lay in it

[Chorus 2: SZA]
Pretty little birds
Pretty little birds
Do you mean every word you mean, every word?
Pretty little girls
Pretty little girls
We hit the window a few times (the wall)

[Post-Chorus]
I can't stay
But I would lay
But I would
I would

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Lately I feel like I'm robbin' myself
Like I'm robbin' mines
Diamond cerebral peek into your cortex
Be faithful and free and just play in your vortex
I see you 'Lana, you fly by the pound
Fly by the ounce, fly to the south
Don't mind them bitches that's cleanin' my house
Lord, you can see, lord
You see them heights that they just can't afford
I see them lights and you made for that shit
Fuck all that cryin', you pray for that shit

[Outro: SZA & Isaiah Rashad]
But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
('Til we hit the heavens)
But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
('Til we hit the heavens
'Til we hit the heavens)
