[Intro: Rihanna]
Back, back, back, back, when you back, back, back, back down
When you back, when you back
When you back, when you back down
Back, when you back, when you back, when you back down
Back, when you back, when you back, when you back down
When you back, when you back, when you back, when you back
B-b-break it down, down

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, down, back when you breaking it down for me

[Outro]
When you back, when you back, when you back
When you back, when you back, when you back, when you back
Back, when you back, when you back, when you back down
When you back, when you back
When you back, when you back down, down
When you back, when you back
When you back, when you back down
When you back, when you back
When you back, when you back down
Back, when you back, when you back, when you back down
When you back, when you back
When you back, when you back down
Back, back, back, back down
Back, back, back, back down, down, down...
