[Intro: Travis Scott]
I need, I need
I need, I need
I need, I need
I need, I need
I need, I need

[Chorus: SZA]
Love, love, love, love
'Long as we got
Love, love, love
'Long as we got

[Verse 1]
Kick good
But you lie hard and you love 'em
But you stay high and I love that
So I let you hang here for a bit
Kick it with yo' friends
Get yo' ego tight
Oh, you faded? Good
Freaky for the night
Sit it all open on you
It been a minute since I wil'd out, feelin’ wide open
Like why? Why give a bum nigga like three minutes?
Got six figures, my name on it
Hype now, 'cause you came on it
Hype over a hunna eighty seconds
That's three minutes, nigga pipe down
I be looking good, I've been feeling nice
Working on my aura, cleaning up
Working overtime, you be getting boring so
Skrt, skrt, give me room, room
You playin' games and you canceled
Gang, gang and you ain't so
Phone number don't change tho

[Pre-Chorus: SZA & Travis Scott]
Why you bother me when you know you don't want me? (yah)
Why you bother me when you know you got a woman? (yah)
Why you hittin' me when you know you know better? (true)
Know you know better (true)
Know your crew better than you do
Call me looking for ya (yah)
I be looking for ya (yah)
Got me looking forward to weekends
With you baby, with you baby
With you baby, (true)
With you
We do whatever we want, go wherever we want
Love however we want, it don't matter (true)
You do whatever I want, get whatever I want
Get whatever I need, it's about

[Chorus: SZA]
Love, love, love, love, 'long as we got
Love, love, love, 'long as we got

[Verse 2]
Hoppin’ out the bed
Staring at you like damn, damn, damn
Why you did that, that, that?
Why you so damn good to me
I'm telling all my friends how you put it down
Losing all my ends
You be runnin' round, I’ll do it again, love
Give it all up for you right now that’s that good love
Put it all up for me right now, I wish you would, boy
No you can’t cause you scared of the feeling
And I'm pushing new limits
So you lovin' me, lovin' me

[Verse 3: Travis Scott & SZA]
Why you bother me?
Why you bother me?
Why you bother me? (yah)
Last time I checked you were the one that left (the one)
Me in a wreck—yah—, me in a mess (yah, yah)
You all I rep—yah—, like my side I rep (yah)
Yuh, that's that Mo City that side
That you can't come 'round at night, yuh (it's lit)
You like to get me high, you don't want no one beside ya
You like when I make fire
You say, "La Flame, keep makin' fire" (ooh)
Let me cum inside ya, let me plant that seed inside ya (ooh)
Ass and titties, titties, only thing that stuck with, with me (with me)
Only thing that was real
Only thing I could feel, you feel me? (yah, feel me)
So why you bother me, why you bother me? with you, baby
Tryna catch a P.O.V, yah (with you)

[Chorus: SZA]
Love, love, love, love, 'long as we got
Love, love, love, 'long as we got

[Outro: SZA]
I came to your city, lookin' for lovin' n' licky
'Cause you promised to put it down
All up in your city, lookin' for you, uh
Searchin' for you like love
Only thing keepin' me from droppin' you right now
Right now (love)
Only thing keepin' me by your side
Only thing keepin' me by your side now
