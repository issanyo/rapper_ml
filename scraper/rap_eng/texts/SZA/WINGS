Wouldn't you like to believe
I'm on the edge
I feel your palms on my back
You're murderous, you're murderous

Swept and I fall, euphoria
Breeze in my eyes
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

So painless, I feel the fall
Power trip, I need it all
I need it all

When you're around, I feel it
When I'm alone, I feel the waves
Crashing, down down
Here in your arms, surround me
I feel your wings
What are you made of
So what are ya, what are ya

Forget I'm alive when you're here
Can lay here for miles
I know you feel me
You're comfortable
I feel your soul

Swept and I fall, euphoria
Breeze in my eyes
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

In the horizon I see your face
I doubt you live when you say
How could you need me
How could you need me
How could you need me

When you're around, I feel it
When I'm alone, I feel the waves
Crashing, down down
Here in your arms, surround me
I feel your wings
What are you made of
So what are ya, what are ya

When you're around, I feel it
When I'm alone, I feel the waves
Crashing, down down
Here in your arms, surround me
I feel your wings
What are you made of
So what are ya, what are ya
