[Intro: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Ain't no worries, darling
Cause we're going to Spain, catch a plane to Tibet, darling
Can I show you this world, baby?
Ain't no rules to this life, darling

[Verse: ScHoolboy Q]
You know Q gon' drop that funky shit
You know Q gon' spit that real
How you not like me? How you not love me?
How you hide your feelings?
You been hooked from the jump
It's the first of the month
We be good for the week
Won't last for the day, just right for the night
So right for your life
Let the truth be told, let it crush your goals
But I can heal your soul like:
I could make you feel good through your skin, baby
I'm the blood in your heart when it pump, baby
I'ma be down with you 'til we turn eighty, and I know
Your family got so much to say, baby
I'm the thing that make pain go away, baby
When I'm warm and you sick to your tongue, baby, and I know

[Hook: SZA]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know...
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know...

[Outro: Lance Skiiiwalker & (SZA)]
Can I show you this world, babe? (Can I show you the world?)
Ain't no rules to this night, darling (No rules to this night, but you)
Can I show you this world, baby? (I know, I know, I know)
Ain't no rules to this night, darling (I know, I know, I know)
Visions kinda blurry
As I focus my frame to truly adore you babe (Truly adore me, that you adore me I know)
Can I show you this world, darling? (I know, I know, I know)
Ain't no rules to this night, darling (I know, I know, I know, I can tell baby)
(If you're having a good time
Yes I know
I can tell baby)
