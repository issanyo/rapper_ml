[Lyrics from Snippet]

Say you got love for me
Say you don't mind that we don't really fuck a lot
I-I-I-I just wanna smoke a little
Then take off all my makeup
So we can touch a little

Don't really rush a lot
I keep anxiety
Thank you for waiting anyway
Don't really trust a lot
I keep a side of me
Under Wraps
