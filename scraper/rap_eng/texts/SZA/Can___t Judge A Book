[Verse 1: SZA and The Tracks]
You can't judge sugar by looking at the cane
You can't judge a woman by looking at her man
You can't judge one by looking at the other
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover

[Chorus: William Prince, Victoria Canal, The Tracks]
Can't you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
Oh, you can't judge a book by looking at the cover, No

[Verse 2: Radkey, William Prince, Victoria Canal, The Tracks]
You can't judge a fish by looking in the pond
You can't judge right from looking at the wrong
You can't judge a daughter by looking at the mother
[?]

[Chorus: Radkey]
Oh can't you see, yeah
You misjudge me
Look like a farmer
I'm a lover

[Guitar Solo: Noe Socha]

[Post-Chorus: William Prince and Ruby Ibarra]
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover (yeah)
Oh now (yeah)

[Bridge: Ruby Ibarra and SZA]
Write my stories now
Paint the cover now
My feet are runnin' but my soul's planted on the ground
Break the labels down
Make 'em hear my sound
Can't judge a book by its cover
Can you hear me now?
We wanna break free (Can't you see?)
No you can't paint me (You've been done to me)
I fell like eight feet
Be thinkin' I'm crazy
But listen, lately
I'm choosin' to be all the things they make me
They try to judge me and they try to read me (Can't you see?)
Put me in box
Break the locks, never stop (You've been done to me)
[? 1:50] at the docks
Off the top, flip a hot
Takin' one look, try to read me like a book
But I leave 'em all shook
'Cause you can't judge a book by its cover

[Outro: SZA]
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
