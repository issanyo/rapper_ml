[Chorus]
Into the roads, it's open
Bare to your left, my heart sits here
They say my dreaming is hopeless
This is the bed I lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah

[Verse]
'Cause I'm me, I'm me, revenge is my thing
Watch em bleed, I like it
Yeah I like it, yeah I like it
Yeah, yeah

Ooh I fell off the truck, out of luck
So perturbed, uh
Ooh pick me off the ground, to be found
Call my name on the loud speaker uhh

Claim me loud enough for me to hear
Oooh, oooh, oooooh

[Chorus]
Into the roads, it's open
Bare to your left, my heart sits here
They say my dreaming is hopeless
This is the bed I lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah

[Refrain]
Mmm yeah
Kille come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, come, come
Come, come, yeah
Kille come, come
Come, come
Come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, yeah

[Bridge]
This is from the heart this is what we live for
Now back to the cheese the cheese
This is from the heart this is what we live for
Now back to the cheese the cheese
(This is from the heart this is what we live for)
At ease, at ease, at ease, at ease
(This is from the heart this is what we live for)
At ease, at ease, at ease, at ease

[Chorus]
Into the roads, it's open
Bare to your left, my heart sits here
They say my dreaming is hopeless
This is the bed i lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah

[Refrain]
Mmm yeah
Kille come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, come, come
Come, come, yeah
Kille come, come
