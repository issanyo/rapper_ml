[Part 1]

[Intro]
Here soon, here soon
Here soon, here soon

[Verse 1]
Loving alone is what you make it
(Make it, make it)
Stay for the storm if you can take it
(Take it, take it)
But pray for a raincoat to bare the brunt of mistakes
I know you worry a lot if I’ll be here for you
Do I care enough? Do I feel for you?
I can guarantee

[Pre-Chorus]
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more
And I didn’t know you cried 'cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I’m just keeping a little hope, baby
And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more

[Verse 2]
Dying of daydreams in your bedroom
(Bedroom, bedroom)
Been waiting so long, said you’d be here soon
(Here soon, here soon)
How could you forget that I’m the one who
Forgot all your mistakes and dirty drawers?
You know I care for you
When hell over earth came, I stood for you
Will you stand for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more
And I didn’t know you cried 'cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I’m just keeping a little hope, baby
I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more

[Outro]
Here soon, here soon

[Verse]
Funny how life is turning out
I don't have much to talk about
Don’t have much to write about
Got a shitload to cry about
Funny the words I do kick
Funny the niggas I do pick
It’s funny what sticks
(Go figure)
Mama said I’m sensitive
I gotta work on that
Not really
Tired of using adjectives, I gotta build on that
You feel me?
Not really

[Outro]
Young man, tryna hold the world in a broken hand, hand
Young man, tryna find the world in a broken hand
