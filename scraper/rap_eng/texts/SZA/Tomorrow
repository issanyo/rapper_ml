[Hook: SZA]
I just pray that today, is nothing like tomorrow
I just really wanna run away
So I can escape my sorrows
But do you have a dream I can borrow
'Til tomorrow, 'til tomorrow
Do you have a dream I can borrow
'Til tomorrow, 'til tomorrow

[Verse : Kris Kasanova]
Livin' in the city with no fuckin' hope
We either writin' rhymes or we slingin' dope
My homeboy got Red Hook tatted all on his throat
Ain't got five for the bus, but he got five to the smoke
My other homie said that he livin' in hell
And where he's headed, he'll either end up dead or in jail
Ain't it crazy how these hallways look like prison cells
And if these walls could talk, man, they would never tell
I know this little girl who said she don't believe in fairy tales
Her mama in the hospital ain't lookin' very well
I wish her well
She wish me luck
Livin' in the free world but I be feelin' stuck
My homeboy Shaq said, "Put Red Hook on the map
And if you make it out, don't never look back."
I wish him well, he wish me luck
'Cuz where I'm from, niggas don't care about us

[Verse 2: Kris Kasanova]
My homegirl just lost her best friend
And she ain't been the same since then
Lookin' in her eyes, she ain't got no hope
I call her here and there so I can help her cope
But now she drink, and now she smoke
Her pops worried that one day she gon' overdose
I wish her well
I wish her well
She searchin' for some change inside a wishin' well
Her mama told her, "Get over it. You can't cry for your whole life."
She said she should die, without her best friend, there's no life
There's no light
She wishin' they could trade places
So her friend could live out all of her life stages
She slit her wrist right before she hit my phone
She said, "Kris, I just didn't wanna die alone."
I wish her well, I wish her well
I wish her well, I wish her well
