[Verse 1: Childish Major]
Ain't nobody payin' attention
Ain't nobody stoppin' to listen
Ain't nobody care about your feelin's
Ain't nobody here for the emotions
Everybody just keep on floatin', bye
Bitches don't even say "hi" no more
All that attitude and you beggin' for some dope? Nope
You give it up for the blunt, huh?
Wonder why a nigga never wife ya

[Hook]
I bet you wanna party like it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
I bet you wanna party like it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday

[Verse 2: Childish Major]
You were never payin' attention
You was never stoppin' to listen
You was never carin' bout feelin's
You was never here for the emotions
Everybody just keep on floatin' by
You don't even call to say "hi" no more
And yeah I got an attitude
Cause everybody showed up except you
Everybody show love except you

[Hook]
I bet you wanna party like it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
I bet you wanna party like it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday

[Post-Hook]
Happy happy birthday, happy happy birthday
Happy happy birthday, happy happy birthday
Happy happy birthday, happy happy birthday
Happy happy birthday, happy happy birthday
Happy happy birthday, happy happy birthday

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Why we gotta fight in the kitchen?
Why you always givin' a fuck?
Why you always doin' the most?
Why they always killin' the mood?
Everybody just keep on smokin'
I can see the hurt in your face
You ain't just some regular song
You ain't never nothin' to me
Sittin' on the dock of the bay, everybody just keep on floatin'
You just want somebody to blame
You just wanna be in the mix
You just wanna give it a go
You just wanna do you a line
You just wanna do you a line, hey
This ain't regular shit
This ain't for no regular bitch
This ain't for nobody to know
This ain't for nobody to love
Baby you too ready to cry, hey

[Bridge 2: SZA & Isaiah Rashad]
Oh don't cry, don't cry
Cause I just want it my way sometimes, sometimes
Oh don't cry, don't cry
Cause I just want it my way sometimes, sometimes

Happy happy birthday, happy happy birthday

Happy happy birthday, happy happy birthday
Happy happy birthday, happy happy birthday

[Hook]
I bet you wanna party like it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
I bet you wanna party like it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday, it's your birthday
