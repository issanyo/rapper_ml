[Intro]
Maybe I should kill my inhibition
Maybe I'll be perfect in a new dimension

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson ooh

[Chorus]
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do do do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will

[Verse]
Keepin' up is hard to do
Even harder feeling heavy, steady chasin' you
Beep beep, why are you lookin' around, you lonely?
I feel you comin' down like honey
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson ooh

[Chorus]
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do do do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will

[Outro]
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do you know I'm alive?
Do you even know?
