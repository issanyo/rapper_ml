[Intro]
High up on, high
High up on, high

[Chorus 1]
High up on, high up on, high up on you
High up on, high up on, high up on us
High up on, high up on, high up on
High up on, high up on, high up on you
High up on, high up on, high up on us
High up on, high up on, high up on we
High up on, high up on, high up on, kush for me

[Chorus 2]
I'm high moon, hey moon
High up on, high up on, high up on us
High up on, high up on, high up on you
High up on, high up on, high up on
I'm high up on , high up on high up on

[Post-Chorus]
Didn't I tell you, didn't I say that
Didn't I tell you a high like this won't last?
Didn't I tell you, didn't I say that
Didn't I tell you a high like this won't last?

[Verse]
So I'm the fool, you could make it
Don't wanna be alone with him naked
Be a shame we're just gonna waste it
Oh

[Chorus 3]
High up on high, high up on climax
High up on you
High up on you should spend the night
I'ma do my thang
High up on, high up on we
High up on, high up on, high up on

[Post-Chorus]
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I say that? (Didn't I say that?)
Didn't I tell you? (Didn't I tell you?)
Didn't I say that? (Didn't I say that?)
Didn't I tell you? (Didn't I tell you?)
Didn't I say that? (Didn't I say that?)
Didn't I tell

[Outro]
K bye
