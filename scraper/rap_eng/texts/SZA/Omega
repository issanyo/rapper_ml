[Verse 1]
Let the church say, "Amen"
Release all my sins at the pulpit
It's the beginning
(It's the beginning...)
It's the beginning of my sermon
You hold my hand as an infant
Palms to the sky, Adonai, Ya Allah
Till they all come down
Till we all fall down
Down

[Chorus]
Lines drawn in the sand
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride
When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain
You're God in my eyes
Just ride
Lines drawn in the sand
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

[Verse 2]
Up here, the air is so thin
Mountains on my fingertips
I stand at the tippy, screaming at the top of my lungs
Tears in my eyes
Adonai, Ya Allah, answer my calls if you hear me?!
Adonai, Ya Allah, answer my calls if you're near me?!

[Chorus]
Lines drawn in the sand
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride
When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain
You're God in my eyes
Just ride
Lines drawn in the sand
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride
When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain
You're God in my eyes
Just ride

[Outro]
It's the beginning
It's the beginning
It's the beginning
It's the beginning
