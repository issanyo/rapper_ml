[Verse 1]
Should I assume you didn't mean it like that?
Or should I assume you know exactly how you said it?
You know exactly how you meant it
Should I assume it's me, sweet disposition
Switchin' position, duckin' submission
Or should I assume it's a weekend thing, boy?
You could get ass all week, droppin' that ass
Just think about me, think about me

[Pre-Chorus]
And it sounds good, what's the difference if it sound good?
Split the difference if it's still good
What's the difference if it's still good
Just not yours exclusively?
Used to be all good
Trade it up, now it's all bad
Rang it up, credit all bad
Getting on, never saw that
Mystery number, call back
It better not be her again
Know you wish it wasn't
Know you wish I wasn't

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, so hard to love (so hard)
Darling, you make it too hard to trust
You keep running from me
I'm scared of love
Make it easy for me
I wanna be, it's difficult for me
I'm scared of love, yeah
And you're hard to trust
(You keep) why you running from me?
I'm backing up
Make it easy for me
Don't wanna be scared to love

[Verse 2]
Hopin' you will, hopin' you would
Wish a bitch would, dissin' me
Hopin' you would, kissin' me
Underneath the constellation
If it's any consolation
If it's worth the conversation
I don't do this all of the time
I just say that every time it's worth the lie
It's worth the crime, it's worth the bad karma
I bet you like it rough
Makin' bad decisions how we beggin', and you love it

[Pre-Chorus]
All good, what's the difference?
Still good, split the difference
All good, what's the difference if it's still good
Just not yours exclusively?
Used to be all good
All bad
Tell it, love, that's more than

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, so hard to love (so hard)
Darling, you make it too hard to trust
You keep running from me
I'm scared of love
Make it easy for me
I wanna be, it's difficult for me
I'm scared of love, yeah
And you're hard to trust
(You keep) why you running from me?
I'm backing up
Make it easy for me
Don't wanna be scared to love
