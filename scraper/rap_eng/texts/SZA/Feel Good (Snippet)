[Lyrics from Snippet]

Do whatever make you feel good
Hesitate make it feel good for the meantime
Drag it out for the longest
Waiting on you for the longest

I don't know what's the hold-up
Nigga you could never show up...

...

Do whatever just to feel good
Left over make it feel good
Calling you when I said I wouldn't
Loving you when I know I shouldn't
Trusting you when I said I wouldn't

Guess what
It's a new day, same face, better brain, better body, new case
