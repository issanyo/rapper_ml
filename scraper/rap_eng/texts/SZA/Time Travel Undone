[Verse 1]
I'm tired of time travel, I
Rather stay here with my
Thoughts, wish they'd stay
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh
Misunderstood, I'm
Miseducated, Umm
You should just save me
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna live how it should be
Over, what it is
Over
Can I get a heartbreak?
Over
Unstick my thoughts, unstick my heart
Unstick these words, go from the start

[Chorus]
Take me to reality
And drag me to the truth
Take me to reality, oh
Drag me to the truth

[Verse 2]
Come clean, soul
Yearning for things, are numb
Do me good then just so
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh
Look with the light, I see
Top of my sight, I'm scared
Can't sleep at night
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna live how it should be
Over, what it is
Over
Can I get a heartbreak?
Over
Unstick my thoughts, unstick my heart
Unstick these words, go from the start

[Chorus]
Take me to reality
And drag me to the truth
(Drag me to the truth)
Take me to reality, oh
Drag me to the truth
(Drag me to the truth)
