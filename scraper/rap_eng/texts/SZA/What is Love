[Intro]
Back-back it-back
Back it up
B-back-back it-back it up
Back it-back it up
Back it up

[Verse 1]
I've been searching high and low
For someone who can do it like me
She said "Fuck you, what you hear, keep out for what you know and you'll see."
(Back-back-back)

You've been sneaking on my mind
Keep messing up my head when I sleep
I know you wonder who comes to comfort she
(Back-back-back it up)

[Hook]
Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love
(Back it up)
What-what is love?
(Back it up, back it up)

Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love
What-what is love?
(Back-back)

[Verse 2]
There's been lots of conversation about you and me
About the way that we see things and you don't agree
The tip of a bee sting is how you left me
(It's how you left me, how you left me)

I've been whipping high and low
For a little picket fence and my peace
Sometimes I wonder, who comes to rescue me?
(Back-back-back it up)

[Hook]
Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love (back it up)
What, what is love?
(Back it up)

Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love (What is)
(Back it up)
What-what is love? (What is)
(Back-back)

(B-back it up, back it up)

(Back it up)

[Hook]
Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love (Back it up)
What-what is love?
(Back it up)
Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love
(Back it up)
What-what is love? (What is, what is)

Back it up
