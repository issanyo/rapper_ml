[Intro: SZA]
Oh, where do we go?

[Chorus: SZA]
Where do we go? From here, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we go? From here, my dear, my dear
Where do we go? From here, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we go? From here, my dear, my dear
Oh

[Verse 1: Manhattan]
I ain’t gon’ speed up
I stay feet beneath her
Complete sentences, had to squeeze than easier (oh)
Piece of burn, ask for the class time capsule
Tell 'em little rascals, I'm a bad example
Who could have a child, talkin' like a wild orchid
Easier to laugh, when it's hard for you to cry
Stars in her eyes, pausin' the time
Where I'm lower than the flies
Lord she abides
More similar to the chords in my rhymes
Every syllable, drowns out the noise in her mind
She knows, I'll be gone by the time she awakes
It's worth every penny, for a night of good sleep
I wish we could dream, over [?] beats
How heinous can we get? Never mean to be seen
My guide sign, post me a question, a conscience
Where do MC's go after we body them?

[Chorus: SZA]
Where do we-
Where do we go? From here, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we go? From here, my dear, my dear
Where do we go? From here, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we go? From here, my dear, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we go? I don’t know where we go from here

[Verse 2: Manhattan]
Love smells of Napalm, early in the mornin'
Call me wreckless and irresponsible
Call me collect, and I'll respond to you
Call what you saw, fall far from the Nebula
X marks the spot, if you spell it in algebra
Tell 'em I came here, barely up pastors
Tell 'em, I asked them to pray for the rappers
Love on the rocks, got bums on the blocks
Heartbroken over what could happen when you on top
It's a quick drop down from the sky, believe me
Limbs never heal too evenly, really
We are heartbroken, we saw the promise land
Kicked off the Charlie chain, we didn't have the token
White boy, who would fight for us, inside the trenches
Bomb went off, I don't blame the invention
Blame myself, General, should prevent shit
This is my entrance into redemption
Revenge is a bitch, colder than Tibet it is
Lemonade still, popular beverage
It ain't gon' stop, 'cause we ain't gon' stop
'lot of coonies, got to us over the promenade
But, this is my wish and, it didn't come true
I'ma take 'em all back, even this one for you

[Chorus: SZA]
Where do we go? From here, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we go? From here, my dear, my dear
Where do we go? From here, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we go? From here, my dear, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we, I don’t know where we go from here
