[Verse 1]
Hey love, I loves you babe
Picking up a penny with a press-on is
Easier than holding you down
Can't be any harder than holding you up now
To come clean I said
(To come clean is to come clean)
To be real is to be real, it's
Probably true what they say about me
Probably came from my inner circle
It usually come from your inner circle
Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust
I've been dropping out and
I've been hanging out with my high friends
And we too stoned to pay attention, now
(Much too cool for 7th grade)
I mean really, it's same me, it's old me
You know? Same shit
I've been on the low key grinding
(Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding)
Learning on the low key, shining
Tryin' to keep to myself
But you bring me out of character
Every time again

[Chorus]
Damn Gina, damn Gina
Them jeans, they must be uptight mama
You need some get right mama
(Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go Gina, go Gina
(It works for me, it works for me, no)
Go get that get right mama
(Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go Gina, go Gina
(It works for me, it works for me, no)
Go 'til you get right mama

[Verse 2]
I belong to nobody, hope it don't bother you
You could mind your business
I belong to nobody, try not to disturb or
Mind my business

[Chorus]
Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no
(Go Gina, go Gina)
Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no
(Go Gina, go Gina)
Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no
(Go Gina, go Gina)
Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no
(Go Gina, go Gina)
