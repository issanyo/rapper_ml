[Verse 1: SZA]
You say you got a girl
How you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless, of knowin' it's selfish
Knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hanging out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home? Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus: SZA]
My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2: dvsn]
Said I'd leave, I wasn't ready yet
I wish me and her hadn't already met
I been tryna get my mind right, but
While you standing there naked in the mirror for me
Got a body that'll make anybody forgive
And I really got nothing to go off
But the feels, but the feels, but the feelings
Clothes off
God knows a nigga doing so wrong
Whatever me and her had is so gone
Ain't really had a friend in so long
But at least you come
But at least you come through
But at least you come
When you cum I cum too
Then I come to my senses
But I don't want to end this
Tell me if you're free sometime this weekend

[Outro: dvsn]
She been working nights on the weekend
Always picking fights on the weekend
Beefin' every Friday
Then I think about it
She might have somebody on the weekends
