[Verse 1]
Go forth, spread the news
I'm liberated
Go on, cut the rope
I know you hate it
Two knives, no fork
Wonder who'd make it?
I lose for you, I choose for you

[Bridge]
Gun fighting
Fatality, boy
Hell fire, boy
I stay for eternity
For you, for you
For you, for you I stay
For you, for you
For you, for you I

[Chorus]
Sometimes I keep you in my mind
Sometimes I let you go up high
I'm using everything I find
Do anything to keep you tied up
Tied up

[Verse 2]
Stationary, birds wings
Small canary, princess
Young savage girl, lost among the lily pads
One road no choice, I've given you this
Move moons for you, I choose to do it

[Bridge]
Gun fighting
Fatality, boy
Hell fire, boy
I stay for eternity
For you, for you
For you, for you I stay
For you, for you
For you, for you I

[Chorus]
Sometimes I keep you in my mind
Sometimes I let you go up high
I'm using everything I find
Do anything to keep you tied up
Tied up
