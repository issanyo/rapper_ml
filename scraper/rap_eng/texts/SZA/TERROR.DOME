[Rosemary's baby snippet]

[Hook]
Picture yourself in a padded room
Welcome to my terror dome
Picture yourself in a padded room
Welcome to my terror dome

Figured you'd had enough of being alone
Figured you call me
Glinda, ya good witch
...Sensei, Ya good bitch
I'll be there
Call me when ya ready

Uhhhhh
I'll be ya good witch call me
Uhhhhh
I'll save ya if I can call me

[Hook]

Not frightened after you trust your own thoughts
Catch the delirium, contagious
I think I owe you more
I feel I show you more
You're my eight packs of soft
Savor like a now or later
Mmm
I think about you now or later

I'll be your savior, call me
Catch you if i can, call me

Feel I've gone far
Tell me where to go from here
Little girl, Lost boy
That's how I feel
Sail me away

[Hook]

Picture yourself

(beat change)

Just picture yourself
Picture yourself
Picture yourself
Picture yourself in a candy land
I wanna go there, alone
All of the morphine you can stand
Padded rooms
Picture yourself

Picture yourself
