I come fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I come riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you

Run it back, run it on back
When you're breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me?
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way, darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

Let me cover your shit in glitter
I can make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul baby
Word on the street you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it's seeing now
Oh, darling would you please giving my reflection a break
From the pain it's feeling now?

I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
Oh, let me know

Get, get, no peace of mind

Let me know
