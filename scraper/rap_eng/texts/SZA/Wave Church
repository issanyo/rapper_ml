[Verse: MNHATTN]
Swear I've got life till the death of me
Design my life ever sketch I'm in
Artistically I broke backboards
Pen sales, records
Any method, smoke niggas, menthol
Protect y'all muthafuckin' neck when I come for it with a liquid sword
Play, but I don't play ball, I play the race car, now I'm bad for a black kid?
Grew up in Manhattan, all my white friends learned how to hack chips
Me? Tutelage under crack shit
Cook glass, pass, smoke ashes
It ain't trap shit, it's watchin' your loved ones grow up North
Know my lawyer can't prove it's a entrapment
Fuck it, I'm passionate, niggas that's my word
Montawk nigga, that's my church I set sail, promotional code no taxes
This isn't AMX, this is access
This ain't Basquiat
This ain't fingerpaint, it's my handprint, it isn't vanilla, it's a canvas
And my palms to the muthafuckin' stone
My palms to the muthafuckin' stone
Hold on, we on now
Let me introduce you to the new swag
My skin color is the new black
Ten on ten, used to use saran
Wrappin' hard white or aluminum
Made two grand then I blew it fam
I'm a Tyson nigga, never threw a jab in my life
I go all out, first round or all my wrongs like right
But you don't hear me though, the fuck wrong with your stereo?
I was an East Coast, piss poor kid, anything cold, fist closed
Over a sketch book that can't close
Manned up, man down, got up, no hand out
Changed lanes, front seat
He off with the chair down
Cuban, chain out
Fuck wit me I'm like....

[Bridge: SZA]
I'm sleeping everyday
I'm thoughts are pourin' over
I'm losin' everythin'
Your light is beamin' down from a flyin' saucer
I see you everyday, everyday
Don't like the lonely surround you
Don't let the lonely, don't let the lonely, don't let the lonely
I keep 'em up in the sky
I keep 'em up in the sky
I keep 'em up in the sky
Just keep 'em up in the sky
Everyday, everyday, everyday just keep 'em up
Don't run away, run away, run away
