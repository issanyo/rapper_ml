[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Hey Ali
I can hear myself good now
It's good now
Finally
Soulo

[Hook: SZA]
Guess that's how it is these days
You even lose when you win these days
These days, God's reign
Scared to live, scared to move these days

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Your soul sits on your third eye, Soul sits on the throne
Told you I was the third wheel, that's 3-wheel motion on chrome
3's up, 3's up, all around the world
We ain't shooting no jump shots, but we balling, we balling
I'm from where they get jumped or shot 'til they falling, they falling
They ain't heard one word from God, but He calling, He calling
I ain't never had a whole rack 'til I was 24 years old
At 25 I spent a hunnid of those and still ain't got nothing to show
I guess that's how it is these days, I guess that's how it goes
Cause this world is dark, and my Locs is on, but I ain't afraid
ABC everything, every M you end up with is owed
And that's simple math, I had to balance the good and bad
No masters but a mastermind, Master Kush up in my bag
Soulo in the backseat, in a thing with some tints on it
With a thing with some tits on her and every nigga in this bitch own her, Soul

[Hook: SZA]
Guess that's how it is these days
You even lose when you win these days
These days, God's reign
Scared to live, scared to move these days

[Bridge: SZA]
These Days, in chains
You even lose when you win These Days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to live these days

[Break: Ab-Soul]
Fuck...

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
My girl died and I lost my mind, I'm off everything except heroin
Blame God, don't blame her, all I did was take gangsters to church
Got your lady with literature in her Louis bag
Got your kids studying outside of class
Every project that I dropped she bought 'em
So now she read more than she Red Bottom
Ab-Soul, abstract asshole, I'm with the shit
I say 'cuz around Bloods and I say Blood around Crips
I'm twisted, got Mary, got Lucy, got Molly
That's wifey, girlfriend and mistress
Ain't no going against me, man, make another plan, pop a Xan
Forget it, that's how it is these days, that's how it goes
'Cause we ain't choose this life, it chose us
So don't show hate, cause she chose us
I'm just stacking paper, get yours up
Lil' nigga, finish your chores up
That's my word I got shows booked
Got that Purp I pour fos up, stole the show, this a hold up
Ho-Hol up, Soulo Ho, there is only uno
Puto, uh, Top Dawg out of this world, Pluto on Pluto, you know

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
More than a man, I done died and rose again

[Hook: SZA]
Guess that's how it is these days
You even lose when you win these days
These days, God's reign
Scared to live, scared to move these days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to live these days

[Bridge: SZA]
These Days, in chains
You even lose when you win These Days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to live these days

[Outro: Isaiah Rashad]
God's Reign
These Days...
Yo, y'all got some more trees?
