[Verse 1]
Shotgun to the back of my heart, I don't turn around to see who let one ring out
Said you'll never do me wrong? Guess we see how that plays out
Is it true? Is it true?

[Hook]
Heading to the Massacre
Bodies arriving every day
What were those shells you heard
Picking the bones up along the way
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out

[Verse 2]
Sharpshooter in my backyard
Killed a small boy once, never told no one
If it wasn't for my shotgun, he'd be alive and I'd be halfway, to heaven
Instead of sitting in the dark, going through hell you should've been here
Wish you had been here

[Hook]
Heading to the Massacre
Bodies arriving every day
What were those shells you heard
Picking the bones up along the way
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out

Shotgun to the back of my heart, I don't turn around to see who let one ring out

Pt. II: I Doubt It

[Snippet]
Lately I've been questioning
Am I all that I pretend to be?
I doubt it, I doubt it
Lately I've been questioning
Am I all that I pretend to be?
I doubt it, I doubt it
