I apologize for waiting to tell you for so long
I am not human
I am made of bacon, fairy tales, pixie dust, I don't feel
I hung myself and didn't die
I'm omnipotent, I'm alive
Not real, I'm alive

You leave me careless, I like it
I like it

[Hook]
Caught up in the blast
Caught up in the action
Caught up in the bursting flame
There's comfort in dying
There's comfort in burning

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

[Verse 2]
Doubt I'll ever be anyone's baby
Living as a unicorn gets so lonely
I have no answers
I have No questions
Stuck in your tandem
Heat that's worth standing
I like it

[Hook]

I can feel the accidents happening slowly
Falling for the rapture ever so boldly
I will go willingly
You don't have to kidnap
I'd like to be kidnapped
You leave me careless, I like it
I like it

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

[Outro]
Doubt I'll ever be anyone's baby
