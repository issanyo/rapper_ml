[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
I gotta ball for my dead homies
I gotta ball for my dead homies
I count this bread for my dead homies

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & SZA (Kendrick Lamar & SZA)]
Smoking dodo in your mama house
She get off work early, cussing at us, and kick us out
Popping wheelies on aqueducts in the summer
We stealing minibikes whistle when Gonzalez was coming
And I remember Shaniqua gave you the cold shoulder
Says she don't fuck with niggas that's chirping on Boost Mobiles
I'm laughing at you and praying that the choppers don't catch you (Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never)
We ditching third period just to fuck your school up
We know where you from homie, uniforms can't fool us
Chalk it up like you s'posed
Cornrows with the zags in the middle
Platinum FUBU jeans, rubber bands wrapped around the denim
I remember...
(Ooh, I remember)
I can feel when you around
You forever hold it down
I return the favor when I'm on stages
In love and memory, no enemy could separate us
And so I gotta say this
How I'm laughing, Now I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
How I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (oh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo woo woo woo
(Woo woo woo woo)
Woo woo woo woo
Pushing foreigns, flying cars
Poppin' trophies, by the mall
Bring back Derek, Stunna Deuce
Pat Dawg that's my cousin, love him too

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (Kendrick Lamar & SZA)]
Wishing I could reverse, us patrolling the turf
Tam's burger for breakfast, chili fries on my shirt
Granny said go to church, how often did we listen?
Sunday school wasn't cool, let's be getting at bitches
Aw man, I got weight on my shoulder
Aw man, I got
Aw man, I got so many angels to feed
Look to the heavens, they depend on me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & SZA (Kendrick Lamar & SZA)]
This personal, I hope you know my loyalty
Will always run deep
So I put it down two times
When I'm on these beats
Put my candle in the street
Put my faith in where you at
Gone, but you're not forgotten
Chad, I promise I'll be back
I'm saying
I'm laughing, I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (ooh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo woo woo woo
(Woo woo woo woo woo
Woo woo woo woo
Woo woo woo woo
Ba-Ba bow bow)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)
