[Chorus]
I lost my passport
But it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway
I lost my passport
And it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway

[Verse 1]
By the time you read this, oh
Probably will've self-destructed, ooh
Never say anything constructive
And all I am, I am, I can't fuck with
(No, no, no)
New love is simple
And old love is fragile
I lost all my reverence for you somewhere in the middle
(You so different now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Usually I could fix shit
Got to fix shit
Can't forget the things you said
All that I guess is stay, no, stay

[Chorus]
I lost my passport
But it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway
I lost my passport
And it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway

[Verse 2]
It'd be different if you wasn't my man, thrill
We wasn't hangin' out (boy)
We wasn't playin' house (boy)
Everything casual boy
It's more serious than I thought
Bit more commitment than I bargained for
(For, for, for, for)

[Pre-Chorus]
Usually I could fix shit
Got to fix shit
Can't forget the things you said
All that I guess is stay, no, stay

[Chorus]
I lost my passport
But it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway
I lost my passport
And it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway

[Bridge]
I need some time to cool off it well
What I want it ain't you no more
I need some time to figure out
Who I really am without you, 'cause
Really I am without you

[Chorus]
I lost my passport
But it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway
I lost my passport
And it's okay
This relationship's going nowhere anyway, anyway

[Outro]
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
