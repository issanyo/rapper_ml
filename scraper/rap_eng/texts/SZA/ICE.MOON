[Verse 1]
Summertime sadness
I feel India in my bones
I can smell sunlight
I can feel the highline
Bless me
Gods bless me
Goddess of Forbidden Love
I am she
I keep one white candle
Maintain
Purity, purity

[Chorus]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go go go there
Go to church if you scared

[Verse 2]
I lay formless
Hands tied in my sheets
Star signs say I'm rare
Chosen
By who
I-I-I-I-I
I wonder who's watchin'
Whose wing I'm under
Sweep me up and I'll go
No questions take me
I'll go!

[Chorus]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go go go there
Go to church if you scared

[Outro]
Show me the way
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
