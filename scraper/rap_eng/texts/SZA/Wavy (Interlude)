[Verse 1: SZA]
I think I'm bad as hell
I got issues, out of line
Sayin' tomorrow I'll get the dishes
Never come
Easy bake, easy wake, oven
Just give as much as you take
Forgive as much as you hate
Or get the fuck out

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I've been in the dugout (dugout)
Lookin' for a way out (way out)
You know just takin' it slow (oh yeah yeah yeah)
Now I'm feeling worn out (worn out)
Lookin' for a way out (way out)
Somebody show me the door (oh yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy & SZA]
I was wavy
I've been waitin' for you, boy
And I was drownin'
Ooh
I went crazy
I've been goin' crazy, boy
Found out, this the way out (Ooh)
Now I'm wavy
Now I'm wavy

[Outro: SZA]
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the door babe
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the ropes, babe
