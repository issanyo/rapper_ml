[Intro]
Top Dawg Entertainment

[Hook]
Days and nights
I, I sit and think where I went wrong with you, wrong with you
Days and nights
I, I sit and think where I went wrong with you, wrong with you

[Bridge 1]
Ah, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ah, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, ah, ah

[Hook]
Days and nights
I, I sit and think where I went wrong with you, wrong with you
Days and nights
I, I sit and think where I went wrong with you, wrong with you

[Verse 1]
Ain't typical of the typical type
Ay, you would (-), ay, you would (-)
Class this, I'm waitin' 'til my heart physical
Assets could build with you

[Bridge 2]
I just want to get you home to mine
I just want to get you home to mine
I just want to get you home to mine
I just want to get you home to mine

[Verse 2]
Nights and days with me
We, we, we, we, we, we like nights and days
You burnin' up my side
Shouldn't take a little birdie to tell you
Somethin' 'bout this girl ain't right
You shot me with this bullet and this is how I took it
Exit wounds, damn, I want these exit wounds, exit wounds
I think I can't let it out
I've come to think that maybe I'm too cool with these exit wounds
And nothing's feelin' the same, it's just a fearsome game
Impossible to please you and most these words'll be used

[Bridge 2]
I just want to get you home to mine
I just want to get you home to mine
I just want to get you home to mine
I just want to get you home to mine
