[Intro/Chorus]

[Young man, hold a world in a broken hand
Young man, hold a world in a broken hand]

"Moon boy wolf"

Round and round
I watch the world turn
Passion in the my heart
The flame burns
*flame sfx*
Uh
Working for the change
Minimum wage
Side hustlin everyday
Yearn for her
But my heart ain ready
On my path
And i gotta stay steady
Uh
Been
On the mission
4 a minute
Ruroni kenshin
Wit da tunnel vision

[Chorus]
[Young man, hold a world in a broken hand
Young man, hold a world in a broken hand]

Lonely samurai
Heart is Gemini
Dome equipped
With the third eye
Curve lies

Got a urge to
Save Lives
Like a battosai
Slay in one slice

Tip toe in the masses
Hunt evil like assassin
Stay outta my way
Or else You gotta TASTE MY BRADE

[OUTRO]

Drifting with the wind
Vibin from within
A mello life ill live
Ill never be the same
After this
