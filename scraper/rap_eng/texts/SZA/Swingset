[Hook]

[Verse 1: Jean Deaux]

Mama said don't look right in the closet
Mama said that when I think I lost it, know
I just started to glow, started to glow

Mama said don't let no boys get in my mind
Mama said I'd just run right outta time, no
When I feel confined, go

And it is like a cycle
I hope my fruit don't ripe no more
Don't ripe no more

I'm just stuck in outer space
What you know 'bout outer space? No
Baby you should take notes

[Verse 2: SZA]

Mama said ignore the beast under your bed
Become the beast instead
Fuck a fairy tale happiness is fraudulent

Mama said know otherwise
She got three eyes

Pray for yourself
No one else
Guess I still believe in fairy tales

Women's intuition
Tired of missionary
Born in sanctuary
Of your soul
I hope you notice that

All the missin' pieces of me you
What you know about outer space?
What you know 'bout outer space?
Outer space
