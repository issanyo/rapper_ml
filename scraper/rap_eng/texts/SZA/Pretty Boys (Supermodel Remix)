[Verse 1]
I'm drafting this message I'll never send
Hope you don't hear this, but if you do let me begin
So you got a new keyboard
Waiting for mine to arrive from FedEx
So hopefully that shit comes soon
Hopefully the new dick you
Moving on with doesn't fuck with
You gon' put all the bullshit right on him
Baby, let me tell you something
I called Harrison right after you left
He told me everything
'Bout the hickies he left on your neck
Why was I so easy to forget like that?
Blame it on the drugs but I don't get like that
Never thought you would go get with my friend
Say they cheat once they gon' do it again

[Chorus]
Leave me lonely for prettier boys
You know I need too much attention to be ignored
Why you ain't tell me you was bored?
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, I need you

[Verse 2]
I've never been the prettiest boy in the room
But I'm like a cat, swear I got around nine lives
You broke my heart five times
Only four more to go, wow, you on a roll
Guess I should start planning my own funeral
But you can't attend (you can't attend)
Don't act like you care, I know that's just pretend
(That's all pretend, that's all pretend)
Let me be real for a minute
I fucking miss you, I fucking hate you
Sad that you aren't here, man, I can't escape you
I hope that one day a pretty boy breaks you
So you know, you know
How this feels
How this feels
I'm still trying to heal

[Chorus]
Leave me lonely for prettier boys
You know I need too much attention to be ignored
Why you ain't tell me you was bored?
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, I need you, I need you

[Outro]
Oh no, oh no
You never saw it in me
You only saw it in them
The pretty boys always win
The pretty boys always win
Oh no, no no
