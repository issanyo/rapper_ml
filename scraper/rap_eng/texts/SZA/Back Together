[Verse 1: SZA]
I know I wanted to be a pretty lover
I only wanted to be your undercover
And now you getting mad baby, now you throwing fits
'Cause your phone ain't ringing like it used to do
How do you feel?
Now you wanna take it back
Now you wanna ghost somebody
Why you gotta treat me like that?
You know you were somebody

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
Suddenly I understand
When I call, wanna come by
I don't need no man

[Chorus 1: SZA]
Suddenly you wish we were
Back together
Telling me you wanna get
Back together
Just the way you had me was
So much better
Say you didn't think it would
Be forever
Ooh

[Verse 2: SZA]
I don't know, I just, I have better things to do
Better men to call, better time to spend and-
Runnin around tryna getchu boy, getchu boy, getchu
How do you look good when you grip it like that?
How do you look good when you put it like-
Runnin around tryna getchu boy, getchu boy, getchu
How do you look good when you grip it like that?
How do you look good when you put it like-

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
Suddenly I understand
When I call, wanna come by
I don't need no man

[Chorus 1: SZA]
Suddenly you wish we were
Back together
Telling me you wanna get
Back together
Just the way you had me was
So much better
Say you didn't think it would
Be forever
Ooh

[Verse 3: SZA]
Hello? Yeah I hear you
Yeah, yeah, yeah I seen you calling
Six times, I don't know, I just
I have better things to do, pass the times it's-

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
Suddenly I understand
When I call, wanna come by
I don't need no man to fly

[Verse 4: SZA]
Maybe we get back, maybe we don't
Maybe we call, maybe it's gone
Maybe you'll love me, maybe you won't
Ooh
We'll see, come again, we can talk about it
Suddenly you wanna, call on, or love on, or hold on to my ass
Well call them other girls
You can try, you can see if it works, gladly
I'm a little bored, I gotta little more things to entertain my time
And summer getting real close, weather getting real hot
Shorts getting real short, skin getting real tight

[Chorus 2: SZA]
Back together
(I don't know the place for you)
Back together
I don't know the first place to begin gettin' back witchu
So much better
I think you've run this chorus
Be forever
I think you've reached the end of a line darling
I think you've reached the end
Keep it classy, don't cry
I know it hurts, I know you want it
I know you long for the love
Too bad together sounds like an old tune
Like a holiday since passed
Just call, I won't answer no more

[Outro: SZA]
Back together
Back together
I'm onto new things, new sounds, new feels, new times
So much better
And you old news
Be forever
You old news, I can't stand it
Ooh
I don't know, I just-
