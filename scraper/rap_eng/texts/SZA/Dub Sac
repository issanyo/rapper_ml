[Part 1: Produced by Dave Free]

[Chorus]
I had a dub sac in my bucket, rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
Now I got a OZ in this Benz, still rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
OZ in this Benzo, rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
Rolling 'round like, "Fuck it," rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"

[Verse 1]
That shit weak, your bitch weak
That's too bad, my bitch bad
Smoke weed, I got plenty
Take your quarter back like McNabb
Sip lean, I got plenty, I drop a ace in a liter
Now I got a quincea√±era
Ever had a chick do it on the dick to capoeira?
Kick game like Martial Arts
Kick game like Marshall Law on Tekken
The homies got weapons
Martial Law could happen any second
Getting money, blowing digits
Only sexing sexy women
(Only sexing sexy women)
(Only sexing sexy women)
That like to do them nasty thangs
You know, I like them nasty thangs
Can't fuck with them whips and chains
I got a bitch that do, but I ain't got no gavel
Baby wanna know what's under my belt
Maybe 'cause I paid so much for the belt
Call the car service, get your ass home
But just yesterday me and Agent J

[Chorus]
I had a dub sac in my bucket, rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
Now I got a OZ in this Benz, still rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
OZ in this Benzo, rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
Rolling 'round like, "Fuck it," rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"

[Bridge]
What's happening? What's happening?
What's happening? What's happening?
What's happening? What's happening?
What's happening? What's happening?
(OZ in this Benzo, OZ in this Benzo)
(Del Amo!) Just a lil' Carson nigga, just a lil' Carson nigga
(Del Amo!) Just a lil' Carson nigga, just a lil' Carson nigga
(Del Amo!) Just a lil' Carson nigga, just a lil' Carson nigga
(Del Amo!) Just a lil' Carson nigga, just a lil' Carson nigga

[Verse 2]
You're so weak, you don't know me, Soulo so low-key
In Lord, Legends, infinity, oh, God showed off inventing me
Me and K with the promoter, drop the fo' up in the soder
I'm unraveling Backwoods
And he's bending corners, just thought I'd warn ya
What's hatteninn? I've been gone too long
But bitch I'm back again, except this time I'm old
Had that Chevy Celebrity the same age as me
With that gram in the glove-box, that's a 2 for 15, I mean

[Chorus]
I had a dub sac in my bucket, rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
Now I got a OZ in this Benz, still rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
OZ in this Benzo, rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"
Rolling 'round like, "Fuck it," rolling 'round like, "Fuck it"

[Bridge]
What's happening? What's happening?
What's happening? What's happening?
What's happening? What's happening?
What's happening? What's happening?
(OZ in this Benzo, OZ in this Benzo)
(Del Amo!) Just a lil' Carson nigga, just a lil' Carson nigga
(Del Amo!) Just a lil' Carson nigga, just a lil' Carson nigga
(Del Amo!) Just a lil' Carson nigga, just a lil' Carson nigga
(Del Amo!) Just a lil' Carson nigga, just a lil' Carson nigga

[Verse 3]
You still weak, you last week
I'm next month, twist the next blunt
The homie got his chain took at the Mixed Nuts
Now we blowing big weed, lean mixed up
Nigga, don't get shit misconstrued
We gave y'all plenty time to dig our stuff
Getting women in the mood
We tell the truth up in the nude
Breaking news, breaking news
I'm enlightening like Pikachu
All I do is what you wouldn't think to do
Silk, don't you remember that vegetable
South Pole Jeans, fat laces in all our shoes
A nigga turned into an oracle
Treat the damn booth like a urinal
Smoking a stogie in a terminal
I had a dub sac in my bucket, rolling 'round like "Fuck it"
Paul Jeremy, Doe and me tryna match a nugget
Pass the blunt to BC, AR and AJ
King Rich, YM, Python P, I put that on me

[Outro]
I had a dub sack in my bucket... Capital C!

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I just might be in yo' hood
I just might be in yo' hood
I just might be in yo' hood
I just might be in yo' hood

[Interlude: A-Mack (over Ab-Soul)]
Fuck outta here, man, you dumb ass niggas! You niggas are silly out here tryin' to look cute and shit man. Quit playing. This is serious bruh, niggas wanna come talk to me about all this dumb shit; a nigga ain't tryna hear that man. I'ma come clean bruh, go sit down with all that my nigga. This shit's over here from the grass... (?) We gon' handle it, how handle it my nigga straight like that, bruh. Eh, niggas out here look silly, my nigga. Like bruh, if you don't know me, look at my fucking Twitter, my nigga. It's your boy A-Mack out here man, Zanzilla, slapping niggas and bitches for fun, straight like that

[Verse 4: Punch]
Niggas chased my uncle there
Through God's grace, the gun jammed
I found comfort in this pleasure
Meaning I slept the best through gun sounds
These Days it's a little different
Between me and my past, I put a little distance
Egyptian cotton, thread count vicious
Started as a dream, manifest into little Kendrick
Now everybody feel it
Even niggas who didn't know, they try to forget it!
Selective amnesia, that's an Oxymoron, These Days
Niggas ask about pressure
I grew up watching freebase literally eat the face of my hood
So basically I beat the case, I vanished but left a trace
Just in case a nigga gotta go back
Yeah, it's not for games if I say that

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & SZA]
I just might be in yo' hood
I just might be in yo' hood
I just might be in yo' hood
I just might be in yo' hood
