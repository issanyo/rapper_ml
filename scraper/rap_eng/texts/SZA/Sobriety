[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night you gave me a ring
With a fucking castle on it
And a diamond on top that's all I really wanted
Whoa oh
Whoa
Until two aliens came and chopped both our heads off
With samurai swords
At least we died together, that's what I thought
I woke up huggin' leather, am I out of pocket?

She ain't got no soul she ain't got no heart
Love will stunt your growth
Love will make it hard to stay sober
So hard to stay sober

[Chorus]
I'mma be fine anyway
I'mma be cool
I'mma keep calm
I'mma be right anyway
Better than you, better than her
I'mma be on anyway
I'mma be on/off anyway
I'mma be on/off anyway

[Verse 2]
I been through like six Swishers
In one day with one grape and one blueberry
What would my mother say? She want me to be married
And happy and whole, not high and alone
Whoa, that Xanax make you trip, I still ain't got no whip
I still ain't got no friends
At least I got my family, bullshit
My daddy still can't stand me
That hate don't make you hard
Hate'll make you old
Haters gone too far
Hate is all I know
And I can't stay sober
I can't stay sober

You should see the look on your face

[Chorus]
I'mma be fine anyway
I'mma be cool
I'mma keep calm
I'mma be right anyway
Better than you, better than her
I'mma be on anyway
I'mma be on/off anyway
I'mma be on/off anyway


[Outro]
Just can't stay sober
I'm just trying to stay alive
I can't stay sober
I'm just trying to stay alive
I can't stay sober, I
Alive
I don't know man
