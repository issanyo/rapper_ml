(Verse 1)
Stowed away in my heart
Holding hands with the part
We were meant to be the stars
Broken hands from the sky

(Pre-Chorus)
We dreamed too far
We dreamed too far

(Chorus)
Band aids in a box
Band aids in a box
Reach for
Band aids in a box
Band aids in a box

(Verse 2)
And now you're here in my face
It's been dumb; too late
We are the ones to tempt fate
We are the ones to ease the pain

(Pre-Chorus)
We dreamed too far
We dreamed too far

(Chorus)
Band aids in a box
Band aids in a box
Reach for
Band aids in a box
Band aids in a box (2x)
