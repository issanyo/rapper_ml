[Hook: Isaiah Rashad, SZA & Ab-Soul]
Now can we fall in love while Southernplayalistic banging through the night?
Fall in love, through the night
And I ain't ever felt no type of way about this living, do or die
Type of way, do or die
And when they see our age, they say we're young
I'll let you push me to the side
Push me to the side
At least we fell in love with something greater than debating suicide
At least we fell in love

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
How you feeling, baby?
How you feeling, baby?

[Verse: Isaiah Rashad & SZA]
I travel, for you
I battle, for you
'Cause I love, to call, your name
I travel, for you
