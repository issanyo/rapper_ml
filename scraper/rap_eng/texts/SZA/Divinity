[Verse 1: Jill Scott (SZA)]
Relaxed inside my mind I tend to find
Rolled to space together and it had occurred to me (Hello?)
For a shooting star (Remember?)
Serving light, cosmic energy
Then I opened my eyes

[Break: SZA (Jill Scott)]
Sticks and stones might break my heart (Then I opened my eyes)

[Hook 1: SZA (Jill Scott)]
Reaching, stretching space and time for opportunity to sign you and me
Obscured in my divinity (Everything is)
Sticks and stones might break my heart
Won't give up my heart without a fight
Reaching, stretching space and time for opportunity to sign for you and me
Obscured in my divinity (Right here at your fingertips)
Sticks and stones might break my heart, tonight (Your fingertips)
I'm not giving up my heart without a fight (Right here at your fingertips)
My divinity
(Everything is) My divinity
(Right here at your fingertips)

[Verse 2: SZA (Jill Scott)]
Everything, everything is
Sticks and stones might break my heart
[??] long and far and wide for your [?]
Keep me up to speed
Keep me up to speed (Keep me up to speed)
Keep me up to speed
Let me off my, take me off the leash
(I wanna be hand in hand with you)
Keep me up to speed (With nothing but the truth)
Let me off my leash (I wanna be hand in hand)
[?] (With nothing but the truth)
Let me off my leash
Let me off my leash
(I'm just gonna let it be, hand-in-hand where you are)

[Hook 2: SZA (Jill Scott)]
Reaching, stretching space and time for opportunity to sign for you and me
Obscured by my divinity
(I wanna be hand in hand with you)
Reaching, stretching space and time for opportunity to sign for you and me
Obscured by my divinity
(I wanna be hand in hand with you)

[Verse 3: SZA (Jill Scott)]
Let me off my leash
Let me off my leash (Everything is)
My heart, is my breaking heart, but it won't break my soul
Let me off my leash
Let me off my leash
(Pay attention)
(Everything is)
Lifting my space in here (Loud and silent)
I could [?] hell in here
Wouldn't you like to know
That being a beautiful
Your dumb dumb girl (I wanna be hand-in-hand where you are)
Your dumb dumb girl
Your dumb dumb girl
I'll be your dumb dumb girl

[Outro: SZA (Jill Scott)]
Being if he likes me
Tell me what life could be
Long as [?]
[?]
[?] (I wanna be hand-in-hand where you are)
Believe me I know you (Believe me baby)
(Believe me I know it)
(Believe me)
(I wanna be hand-in-hand where you are)
