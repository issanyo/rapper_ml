Verse 1 (SZA):
You say you got a girl
And how you want me
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is wreckless
Of knowin' you're selfish
Knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love
Fallin' all over love, like
Do it to last, last
Hanging out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home?
Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by 10:30
No later than, drop them drawers
Give me what I want

Chorus (SZA):
My man is my man is your man
Her, this her man too
My man is my man is your man
Her, that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

Verse 2 (J. Lye):
Ya ya, J lye
I know how you feel
Give me a minute i'm keeping it real
I know you’ve been bored cause you told me the deal
And me? I got dumped so I got time to kill
I saw you with homie, you’re eyeing my body
I'll teach you some things like i'm Mr. Miyagi
If I am I asked then my memories foggy
And if you got friends then you can bring the whole posse
Look, I don’t need a lot from you
But where I come from baby ain't a lot of you
And i'm sending you that drink, not to bother you
But I know that you be seeing me on top of you
With the way your eyes look, the way your thighs look
I'll make you feel me even when i'm not with you
And i'll never be the one you catch stressing you
But I do apologize if im stretching you
Rest of you, lesson two
And you are everyones favorite so my bets on you
On your worst day, baby see the best in you
And I gotta give you more, I see less of you
I'll take Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Any other day you can get away
No doubt you've been calling me your sweet escape
J lye baby, hit me when you’re on your way (you know)

Chorus (SZA):
Through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend
