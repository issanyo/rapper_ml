[1st Verse]
The media lies and they try to make you
Believe whatever so they can break you
And when we riot it's cause' they incite it
They only wanna see us all divided

[Chorus]
Are you hating yourself?
Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?
Are you hating yourself?
Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

(Clears throat)

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh and the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know it makes me unhappy
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
Will all the real men get up?
I know you fed up ladies....

But keep your head up
Things are gonna get easier
Oooh child, things'll get brighterBut keep your head up
Things are gonna get easier
Oooh child, things'll get brighter
