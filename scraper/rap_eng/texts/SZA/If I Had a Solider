[Chorus: SZA]
If I had a soldier (had a soldier)
I'd send him to war (I'd send him to war)
And if he returns to me (returns)
[?]
If I had an army
I could rule this place
If I had an army
You won't hurt my fate

[Rap]


[Chorus: SZA]
If I had a soldier (had a soldier)
I'd send him to war (I'd send him to war)
And if he returns to me (returns)
[?]
If I had an army
I could rule this place
If I had an army
You won't hurt my fate
