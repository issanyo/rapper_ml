Real nigga pride, rich nigga problems
Real nigga pride, rich nigga problems
Real nigga pride, rich nigga problems
Broke niggas eyes on this rich nigga’s pockets

That late night money had a nigga running wild
And them niggas really in it they don’t crack a smile
Ghetto bitches they be choosing, can’t blame them it’s culture
The police hit them corners, they vultures them niggas on us
She just give us the abus, she just wanna fuck the rims
And let a nigga crush it in a pair of tims
My niggas got felonies fuck around get bucked
And it’s way more to it ain’t just bout a look
They be loading them pistols I keep it for protection
And if my niggas call, I be there in a second
I just keep it g, I put that on the gang
You do a couple shows then think you got a lot of fame
That’s the way of the world, what you see on tv
Tell em I said be careful this ain’t what’s up on our screen
All this from a little white girl, that avril lavigne
Like fuck the middle man I never paid that in between

Still got real nigga pride, and rich nigga problems
Broke niggas’ eyes on this rich nigga’s pockets
I ain’t switched, I survived, I did this off the slots
And it’s the same game plan that you ain’t wanna be involved with
Fast forward, all these pretty bitches flocking
Swiss wrist watches that my whole click rocking
Bitch nigga salling young nip, split the profit
I ain’t stupid, I ain’t scared, so that’s highly unlikely
Niggas don’t like me, kill me, come fight me, feel me
I ain’t the type of nigga covered his life
I mean I value every breath and see it’s wrong when it’s right
Before you envy my success, respect my sacrifice
And if you can’t then now we dropping caskets twice
Cause if you get me, I got niggas coming back that night
But if you with me we go shopping and don’t ask that price
It’s love or hate, but nigga that’s just life
