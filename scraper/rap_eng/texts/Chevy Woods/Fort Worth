Shes too good for her
I don't know where we went
Girls like her
Shes gifted, she gifted to me

[Verse 1]
She at back home thinking, like is she really with it
She remember when they told me this music shit I don't really think you got a life in it
Had to think to myself, should I give up should I go get it
Should I stay in the hood with the killers and the dealers and the gorillas
Got a chance nigga choice, everybody gotta sacrifice something
Shit matters with the block but I ain't giving all up for nothing
I made a way with the words
Same way I made a way with the birds
Same way I pulled up in that new car, niggas like mane is that really yours
Damn right no rap shit
I spend all of the dope money
I had a bad bitch safe
I started rap with the coke money
Pillow talking got my cousin killed, bitch niggas got jealous
When you don't know your real friends, damn than it ain't no telling
Is yo niggas gon' bust back, when them shots get to yelling
Got a call from my dog in the pen, and he way out in Fort Worth Texas
He like "Listen I'm good, do what you do be home in a minute"
I'm like be cool my nigga I'ma see you in a minute
