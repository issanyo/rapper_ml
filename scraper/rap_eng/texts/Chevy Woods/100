[Hook]
You already know the tag
Bring the money in the bag
It's off a hard nigga
How you want it?
Uh?
They don't get it like we get it
They don't do it like we do it
What they doing?
We already done it
Uh?
Swerving in the big body
Gotcha girl riding shotty
Stunting hard when I'm out in public
Uh?
If you ever in the city
Ask any real nigga
They gone tell you that
That boy 100

[Verse 1: Boaz]
Dressed in all black, like the omen
The loud pack gotta nigga foaming
I know the niggas is groaning
There's so much hate in your blood
I swear that, that shit is showing
Niggas is grown men, that still need to finish growing
So let me show 'em a thing or two
I ain't with the talking, Imma do what I came to do
These niggas can't move through the streets the way I do(The Hustle)
I hop, skip and jump down the block like a kangaroo
Ain't no telling what, they really get me started
Imma drink 'til I retarded
Fingers full of residue, sticky from the chronic
Getting blooded in the drought, getting top, like a playa
All she wanted was 100, it ain't tricking if you got it
Uh
Real niggas getcha your money baby
All my bad bitches bust it over
An I don't care they got the stamp on
No, i still gotta bust 'em open
Uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Aye
They never thought that I could make it pop
From serving 20's to the junkies in that vacant lot
New car from speeding, banging that old Jada
They tried to hide in disguise, I know they all haters
God given, God willing, I'm God fearing
I push button on that roof, I know that God's staring
Yeah and all my niggas they got felonies
Smokescreen, new 100's up in these denim jeans
Check it, I had my own work, I've been a boss
So it ain't nothing to shake back when you get it lost
It ain't your problem? shit I was taught not to get involved
And these earrings alone will probably get the draws
Ha, so tell them niggas I do this for real
I'm getting rich, so ain't no need for discussing my deal
Yeah, you see them shooters make that semi pop
You wanna a problem, could be a problem, on any block

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cook Tha Monster]
Uh
Until somebody kill me, I'm gone keep in benji nigga
When i'm copping, bring a bag full of benny's nigga
Used to have to put a hangar in back of the tube
Now I'm nacking on my how I'm eating my food
I'm a dog in the kitchen, turn one into two
Put the coco in the pot, let it simmer and brew, whip
Watchu spending on your rent, I be spending on shoes
This is chess, you better think before making a move
I call tem shooters on te phone, you be making the news
You grabbing more then fifty bricks, you can get them for two
I don't just talk the shit I'm talking, I'm really a do
Throw the foreign in the fifth, tryna willie the goose, skrt
I'll be cool, when I'm counting a million or few
I need the crib with the balcony, ocean in view
My little bhudda, he be itching like bishop in juice
I bet you five grand flat, having you missing your roof
