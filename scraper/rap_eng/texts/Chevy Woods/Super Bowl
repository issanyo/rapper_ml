Quarter brick on the scale, watch me weight that shit up
Shit is so much work that I need me a truck
Quarter brick on the scale, watch me weight that shit up
Shit is so much work that I need me a truck

[Hook]
I’m smokin’ weed and gettin’ money, smokin’ weed and gettin’ money
Smokin’ weed and gettin’ money, smokin’ weed and gettin’ money
Smokin’ weed… and gettin’ money
Smokin’ weed… and gettin’ money
I’m just smokin’ weed and gettin’ money, smokin’ weed and gettin’ money
Smokin’ weed and gettin’ money, smokin’ weed and gettin’ money
Smokin’ weed… and gettin’ money
Smokin’ weed… and gettin’ money

[Verse 1]
I’mma leave that shit to Sosa, I don’t think that I’m Kobe
I be overseas with it, bitch, I think I’m Ginobili
And my shooter’s Lewinsky, 42 off that whiskey
Lay you down somethin’ quickly, no misdemeanor, no Missy
Yeah them felonies, I know ‘bout
Shootouts, I know ‘bout
Coke sellin’, I know ‘bout
Dope sellin’, I know ‘bout
You don’t know shit, boy
Talkin’ out your mouth
Lights off, they masks on, and they right outside your house
Them gold chains, buy some gold bottles that we drinkin’ up in that VIP
That’s what I sell and I’m fly as Hell
You with that bird-mouth-ass bitch
Take it to the top ‘cause I’m from the bottom
You niggas know me, real shit
But let me break it down, we smokin’ weed, gettin’ money up in this bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gangbang, that’s 48, a hundred niggas on the left side
Fucked around with my nigga O now I’m leanin’ out on the Westside
FTR to my North niggas, Pennex out on that Eastside
Big duke from that Mon Yough where they known for lettin’ them heats fly
Sixty grand on my watch, nigga - try somethin’, get shot, nigga
The ‘hood got fucked up when Big, Dre and Loc got locked up, nigga
Young niggas have metal too – Olympic-style, they’ll medal you
I was out on that ocean view – fuck you think you want me to do?
They holler and give back – but they ain’t never give me shit
I put the ‘hood on my back – and I was never on no weak shit
Pussy nigga's like y’all? I smell y’all bitches from far
But I’m just countin’ my bread, and smokin’ out of that jar
