[Hook]
Give me bout an hour, let me change my clothes, I been cooking in the kitchen (x4)
Stepping all fresh, all white, looking like cocaine (x4)

[Verse 1]
Give me bout an hour, let me change my clothes, I been cooking in the kitchen
36 souls, dropped the 40 man I forgot to mention
All of these gold chains, looking like Mr. T
If you blink one time, niiiil, pass by in the V
I just got a new Pyrex and a new stove nigga, what you want?
Come to the back, knock twice, never come to the front
3.5 for the 50, got the J’s going crazy
Hold up! Lemme quote Jay Z: "nigga fuck, you pay me!"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just bought a brand new car off the lot, motherfucker, that’s money!
Got the wolves on the leash let em go cuz you looking like food and they hungry
Taylor Gang 4800, and ya know that’s forever with it
I ain’t got a cold in my heart, man I know they forever with it
Lil ass nigga making lil ass nigga have a lil ass nigga at yo crib
Talking all that big shit, lil nigga
While I’m out on the road doing shows tryna get a couple million
Tryna get a bigger crib, our hood, aye aye

[Hook]
