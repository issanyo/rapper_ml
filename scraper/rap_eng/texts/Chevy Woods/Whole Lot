All up in this bitch with a whole lot of money    (all up in this bitch with a whole lot of money)
She hoppin' down the pole for a whole lot of money    (she hopin' down the pole, hopin' down the pole)
These cars all I got cost a whole lot of money    (oh shit, damn damn)
Bet she doin' anything for a whole lot of money

[Post-Hook: Chevy Woods & OG Maco]

I get a whole lot of money
I get a whole lot of money    (I get a whole lot of money)
I get a whole lot of money
I get a whole lot of money    (I get a whole lot of money, nigga, shit)

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]

[?] and she actin' a fool for that champagne
She know I'm a Taylor, she know I'm a player
She wanna be part of my campagne
She told me she down for anything
And I'm like 'baby, you don't say'
She told me just pick out a girl
Cause she goes both ways
Just give me the time while I'm in the drop
Hustle continues, this money won't stop
Outside the club gettin' rain in the lot
What you gon' do when it's raining them shots
Keep on tellin' me you ready my nigga
Hope that you holdin' this [?] my nigga
Oh, I'mma fuck she'll let me my nigga
You talkin' 'bout killin' me [?] my nigga
And all my niggas on the same shit
Fuck 'em pussy niggas man they lane switched
I'm forever on that gang shit
Poured up on your bitch and took her in a [?]

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
I get a whole lotta guala, problems come with franklins
With every dollar, solve equations
Above and below the equator
Came for the paper the pesos
Who gotta say so, shit
Most of my haters is lame O’s with niggas as broke as they Pinto
I’m not adjusting my sharpened up pencil
The throwing the testing my rock in my necklace. ???
Yeah you wanna be neck to neck (pussy nigga)
BITCH! This ain’t giraffe wrestling (hell naw)
Numbers don’t lie in the grass confession (hell naw)
Bitch 'We The Best' like that Khaled song
