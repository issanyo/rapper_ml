Every chance I get, I'mma go and get it
Every chance I get, I'mma go and get it
Every chance I get, I'mma go and get it
All white brick, Nicole Kidman
Full time grinding, part time shining
Full time grinding, part time shining
Full time grinding, part time shining
Every chance I get, I'mma go and get it

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
High speed chase with narcotics on face
Can't pump my brace can't catch a case
You might catch me on a magizine on the cover
I can 1999 in the Lex' bubble
Turn your head like a pliers, Mikey Myers
My shoulders dipped in diamonds, sapphire
My hands made of fire, stonehenges roofed thru' the vortex
40 haters on my neck
Alligators for pets, sang a hook like Keith Sweat
I even kidnapped one and made 'em do my taxes                      Velociberry raptor, RiFF RaFF in closed captions                           Tried to captivate my style but it only made me angry
I hate to talk to strangers, they wanna steal my Kurt Angles                             Might be only kiddin' I'm crawling like a kitten
Rap game Cal Ripkin no wait Ernest Givens
I Escalade the truck valet in Mississippi

Every chance I get, I'mma go and get it
Every chance I get, I'mma go and get it
Every chance I get, I'mma go and get it

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
Every chance I get, I'mma fucking floss
Bitch I got the sauce, show ya how to boss
Smoking on the flight, now we taking off
Loud got me looking at the clouds, cuz I paint the cost
Speaking on my name, don't ya get it fucked up (right)
That's the type of shit to get your face touched up (right)
I been trying to tell 'em that we got what they inhaling
Yeah, that fire we ain't buying what ya selling tough love
Facts only, hoe facts only
Cash flow in her racks only
Run the game like laps homie
I ain't talking 'bout raps only
I been the same since ground flow
Fuck the fame to your ground hoe
My team straight and my town know
That I'm way up it goes down so
Money on my mind grinding overtime (overtime)
Bitch I got the glow just know I over shine (over shine)
All I know is going hard there ain't no recline
I ain't never sleeping bitch, we eatin' 'cuz I go for mine (ah)

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
(Hahaha) (Chevy Taylor Gang)
(Whoo Whoo) (Gang Gang)
I be foreign wheel whipping
Foreign bitch pimping (skrrt)
Money on my mind, couple million I'mma get it (ya)
We be all up in the vip, watch me styrofoam sip
Got a glacier on my wrist, check out counter with your bitch
Got the jody with the huskie, but your main bitch love me
Got her left and pulling off, cuz you broke boys funny (skrrt)
All these champagne bottles looking like game 7
High school all star Every colors of the letter
Where I'm from if you ain't got it, you ain't safe homes
They ain't have no evidence so now the case closed
Blueberry suit, I call it my race clothes
In a bigger safe that's where the safe goes (cash)
I be getting to the money, how you love that
She told me you don't hit it right, fuck a love tap
I'm a taylor so I'm always on my gang shit
I'm talking taylor gang gang gang gang bitch!
