[Intro]
Aye(x4)
Ugh
Me & my niggas ain't never trying to go back
Yeah
Once you get alot of money, It ain't about how you spend it
It's about how you invest that shit
To make more money

[Verse 1]
I ain’t trying go back to selling coke again
Police they trying focus in
Hunneds with these frozen jems
Lines they had they noses in
Now my picture important for the camera I pose for him
Switching up the car so they can never know what I’m rolling in

[Hook]
So you could play your part
Or fall a victim to the game
Me and my niggas used to hustle for the jordans
But now things change

[Verse 2]
Now we getting this money, dividing slices of pie
And only thing that I want
Is what’s rightfully mine
I’m talking shit from a distance
Them shooters rifling down
Paying for it, think about it
I just might not be round

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Coke spots got ran in, yeah I was in em
Selling 50’s out them, that was the beginning
Charlie Seen fein, coke team, we was winning
Knowing ryan sting, white balls, 9 in it

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now that AP mean and that thing clean as water
Ocean view scene I done seen all the problems
9 for the bullshit, I mean ron harper
Out in LA, looking mean in my Dodger

[Hook]
