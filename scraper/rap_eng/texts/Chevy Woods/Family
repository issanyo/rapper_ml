[Intro: Raven Felix]
You can call me
You can call me

[Verse 1: Raven Felix]
Uh, loyalty is royalty
Nothing is more important than those close to me
Dropped out of school to bag groceries
So I could provide for the people who matter most to me
Gotta sacrifice to get to paradise
I never thought I'd be living this rapper life
It's amazing the difference a couple of years make
Considering that I never finished the tenth grade
And I'll do anything for my day ones
Who are riding with me from the time that the fame comes
To whenever the fame done, and that's real shit
Unconditional love, fuck the predictable ones
That be splitting the minute the shit getting rough
No longer time hitting me up
But it's cool 'cause we here now
So many times my friends looked out
Made sure that I was okay when I was down
I don't forget that shit
So, however it goes you're never alone
When the world treating you cold
All you gotta do is pick up your phone
And know that

[Hook: Raven Felix]
You can call me
When this shit gets rough
You can call me
When you down on your luck
Right here in the eight
You know where to find me
Know we can relate
'Cause this is family
Yeah, this is family
Oh, oh, oh
This is family
Oh, oh, oh
This is family
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Yeah, I've been balling all week
So all them bottles on me
We don't talk to police
My nigga keep it in the streets
I got love for both my brothers
On me, that's family, for them
I'd go hell and back, that's on my cousin homies
I'm out here on a slowly roll
Hope that I don't lose control
No, I can never sell my soul
This the realest shit I ever wrote

[Hook: Raven Felix]
You can call me
When this shit gets rough
You can call me
When you down on your luck
Right here in the eight
You know where to find me
Know we can relate
'Cause this is family
Yeah, this is family
Oh, oh, oh
This is family
Oh, oh, oh
This is family
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: J.R. Donato]
See, I do it for my fam, that's the difference
See, you do it for the gram
I'm the man, yes I am
Got the vision and the plan, and I'm ambitious
Ain't no hoping, ain't no wishing, I'ma get out and get it
Tryna stay consistent
If you bullshitting keep yo' distance
I'm committed and I'm repetitious
Straight out them trenches
My whole family gotta get it
I want nothing but blue Benji's
We don't know about picket fences
They still trapping in them buildings
The money that's coming, can't get enough
And I'm letting it stuck, gotta get it up
I was taught by the best, get yo' business up
I was taught gotta shut them lil' bitches up
I was taught gotta cut goofy niggas out
And the shit that I do, man I been about
We got trappers and choppers up in this house
Pillow talk, that's why all of yo' business out
They gon' still know it's me when it's tinted out
Finna buy me some houses and rent them out
I got goons, all I do is just send them out
Brand new number, I get it, don't give it out
Never Know why I'm hanging I'm in and out
I ain't drink with ya' boy, got a bigger mouth
Tell me what is you all of your feelings about
Tell me what is you all of your feelings about

[Hook: Raven Felix]
You can call me
When this shit is getting rough
You can call me
When you down on your luck
Right here in the eight
You know where to find me
Know we can relate
'Cause this is family
Yeah, this is family
Oh, oh, oh
This is family
Oh, oh, oh
This is family
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
