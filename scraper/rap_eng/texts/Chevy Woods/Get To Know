[Hook]
I'm about my business so we live different
I still be at the hood yeah I still kick it
My mind on the money made a meal ticket
And this for all my niggas cuz I'm still with it
I'm still with it (x2)
Don't give a fuck what they say cuz I'm still with it
I'm still with it (x2)
Yeah this for all my niggas cuz I'm still with it

[Verse 1]
Hell nah we can't talk no business
Boy you ain't got no dough
On Instagram you flexing bitches
And you still ain't got no hoes
My money riding out the [?] store
But you pussy niggas no show
Straight out the pot yeah that's a work of art
The fiends yelling for the yayo
And I'm just counting all this paper up with my niggas on god
Ten passenger seat jet getting high before we take off

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So one time if you still with it
If you not then you pray you gotta deal with it
And now everybody a real nigga
My homie caught a body yeah say shit that's real nigga
So don't tell me what your life like
They had my dog in life light
It was so cold in that night
But we got it done for the right price
Don't play games where we come from
Ain't no lames where we come from
I made some change where we come
Ain't even see it coming where we coming

[Hook]
