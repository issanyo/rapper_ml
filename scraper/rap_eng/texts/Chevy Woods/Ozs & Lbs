[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah nigga, I only fuck with a certain type of niggas man
One hundred, ayy Drew put some delay on my voice
Put some reverb on there and turn me up, uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas got it fucked up
Probably thinking its a game
I might smile a lot
But I ain't playing with 'em
I'm up at eight, I work all night
I'm rolling weed, I'm on the flight
Soon as I land I'm gonna write
I'm on the grind
40 hours, 2 shows, 3 planes, 6 zeros
Flying all around the world
Like I'm a fucking hero
Pouring it straight out a bottle
That's how we drink Cliquot
And we all from the same hood
That's why we feel the same thing
Like say if one of our pockets hurting
We all gon' feel the same pain
Always smoking out the car service
Police escorting, not at all nervous
We the bomb, search us
Penthouse, whole room filled with cash in it
Old school backseat, with the stash in it
Big joint, OG mixed with hash in it
And it's TGOD, you niggas last minute
Your flow last year, the swag last fall
You just the last place, you ain't gon' last at all

[Chorus]
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
You know its Taylor Gang or die
Haha, word

Ah, fresh out the spot where they selling
You gotta pay 'em to cook
Ain't no rules out this motherfucker
Who sold you that book
Bitch we down when its cracking
Around my way and you know that
Can get more than I ever asked
So be afraid of the go back
Hear them talking, I'm cool and moving
No cameras, respect the shooters
I'm out on this money train
You don't know about hustle, do you?
It's everything in or nothing
Bitch you know how I get down
You wasn't mad at me before
So why is you mad at me now?
The alcohol got you talking
You do the same thing, and the cops
Know conversation, know where we playing
Only for money calls only
That mean I can't deal with them old games
That you trynna kick, this ain't Shinobi
I told her baby you thirsty
She responded I'm cool
Said your wrist, its got water
I told her bitch this a pool
Feel me gang that, or concrete dive head first
But if you owe me money, I need my bread first

[Chorus]
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds

[Verse 3: Berner]
What you smoking on man? Aha
What you got in your bag though bruh?

The same shit, new bitch with me
Buy 20, run through 50
I'm running through the stop lights, late night
I told baby girl get your cake right
That kush doesn't taste right
You take it to the head
All you smell is KK and cookie smoke in the Benz
Where my roof go, I stack up quick, while they move slow
White girls in my room, I'm smoking while they do blow
Plush life, no crushed ice
I'm 20k in the game, my bookie loves life
But fuck it, I like to blow cash
I don't tuck it, its nothing
Two first class flights to the function
20 zans, 120 grand, in the city where the pretty girls dance
And them plants grow, in the warehouse
Skinny cash, if you pass me bullshit, I'mma laugh
I'm the man, no lie baby

[Chorus]
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
