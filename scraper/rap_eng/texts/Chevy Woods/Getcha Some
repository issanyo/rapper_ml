[Chorus: Chevy Woods & Peej]
You know I got just what you need up
Fuck with a nigga who's money's guaranteed up
She said she never seen a dime
She never through with playing, is proud
She on the floor and that's her job
So I threw her a couple dollars
Baby, gon' get you some

[Post-Chorus: Peej & (Chevy Woods)]
Okay, okay, okay, alright, (gon' get you some)
Okay, okay, okay, alright

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
All the champagne poppin', yeah, we do this every night
Bring your friends, I got friends, what the end of the night?
All my dogs pullin' up to the mansion in the hills
Know you say you heard about, but that Philly dude is fo' real, oh yeah
You gotta know you the bomb, you explosive
All that ass, gotta show it take your chance, don't you blow it
Amen, oh lord, God bless your parents
You can't handle your liquor, gotta stay coherent
I'm the man, you ain't heard I'm the man?
'Bout that money, gotta stack it up and save it, that's the plan
I'm the man, you ain't heard I'm the man?
All these niggas sleepin' on me 'cause they did too many Xans, I'm the man

[Chorus: Chevy Woods & Peej]
You know I got just what you need up
Fuck with a nigga who's money's guaranteed up
She said she never seen a dime
She never through with playing, is proud
She on the floor and that's her job
So I threw her a couple dollars
Baby, gon' get you some

[Post-Chorus: Peej, Chevy Woods & Post Malone]
Get up bitch, get up, get up
Get up, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up
Okay, okay, okay, alright, (gon' get you some)
Get up bitch, get up, get up
Okay, okay, okay, alright (Okay, okay, okay, alright, get up)

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Go get you some, go get you some
Just go get that money, I know that you hungry
I know that you want it, bitch just keep me company
Like bitch just keep on grindin', you know I keep comin'
She keep on me, man, I don't want none
I know what she got just what I want
I know you go hard, pull up in that foreign
She breakin' her back just to show me she love me
Bet you never met a bitch so..., now gon' twerk it like she did sumin'
Then she pop it like a pimple, she bring it back just like a retro

[Chorus: Chevy Woods & Peej]
You know I got just what you need up
Fuck with a nigga who's money's guaranteed up
She said she never seen a dime
She never through with playing, is proud
She on the floor and that's her job
So I threw her a couple dollars
Baby, gon' get you some

[Post-Chorus: Peej, Chevy Woods & Post Malone]
Get up bitch, get up, get up
Get up, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up
Okay, okay, okay, alright, (gon' get you some)
Get up bitch, get up, get up
Okay, okay, okay, alright (Okay, okay, okay, alright, get up)

[Outro: Post Malone]
The way that lean for me
When know, I know, I know
I know that you will never see
The reason she bustin' on 'em
I just wanna keep on it
I'm sippin' on that, sippin' on that
I'm tryna feel up on that, tryna feel up on it
