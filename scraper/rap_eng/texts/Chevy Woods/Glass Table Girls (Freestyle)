Miami nights, cool, I got a friend on the Dolphins
Used to make that white dance, Christopher Walken
I be on that other shit that these niggas ain't never on
Tell 'em that you better jet if you ain't 'bout whatever homes
No perm, yeah, I'm just nice
It's a wedding to you, to me, it's just rice
I be on that other shit, like yeah that's my brother bitch
While your baby mother dancing right up in front of this
No lie, I'm so fly, look up I'll be chilling
You be running for them thousands, catch me chasing down the millions
Like I, I need it, speeded getting weeded
Got a problem nigga treat it, your pockets skinny, bulimic
I don't play 'bout it, no court, yeah that's how I ball
Had them dirty birds and, I ain't talking Jamaal
With cash running back, I be shitting on them, no stall
What you worth? Catch that verse

You know I love, that 'cane
And she know it's Taylor
Smoking on planes with your mane, yeah
She love them papers
