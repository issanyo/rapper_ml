All this money in the living room and shooters by the door

When them people, pull our fathers tell my niggas getting dough

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Nigga I just bought a foreign now I'm zooming out the lot
All these suckers niggers jealous they just envy what I got

Zombies on sight of the crib and you don’t know about that line
Having boxes for my money and my mom ain't even know
Two twenty-five a piece yeah you know that that’s a go
She know that I'm a Taylor yeah she know I rep the gang

I'm tryna catch a ghost, pull up and let them hammers go
And then I’m getting ghost, I might just let our fortune fled the town
And whip the coke, it float on water like a boat
Never prepared to flight, but that Batman over night
It liked its extra [?], baby you’re flyer than a pilot
This that [?] life, that trap life
Give me a sign, what’s the best price?
I bring that snap now come and try
It’s time to count the Gs
Got so much money I can’t believe it this is farabreeze
