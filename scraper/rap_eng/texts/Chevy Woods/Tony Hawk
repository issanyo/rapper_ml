[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
I’m married to that money while you niggas gay
Them VVS stones sitting in my bracelet
And yet my outfit sick as fuck just like a patient
Mohamed Ali smoke, that’s the greatest
I pull up in that cost-a-lot, don’t ask the ticket
I don’t park it in the parking lot cus I’m so different
No flower on the chicken either, that’s that pure
That Michael Jordan, 6 seconds, bitch I better score
Don’t act like you don’t see these grapes and all this jewelry
Shit I hustled all this money up, you know the story
Maps gon' see, yea go bitch I’m flirty
Tune up on my new car, man on a Rari
Right after I cook it up you know I played
Designer fresh and everything, why you niggas basic
She do whatever for me just cus she know I’m Taylor
Penthouse, please playa punch the elevator

[Hook X2]
I said right after I whip it up you know I played it
I Tony Hawk the police, I’m skatin'
Hammers on a 64, them bands
Like Magic jumpin' out the park, that could make you famous

[Verse 2: Curtis Williams]
Look, me and Chevy in that Chevy
Tell her don’t come in less her and her friends is ready
This money ain’t shit so watch me blow it like confetti
With my brothers and my niggas that’s with me from the beginning
Living life’s a sin and different city, different women
Incredible marijuana, rollin' and smoking ganja
With niggas all around me, Taylor Gang, they be my partners
Recessions with my idols
Made a killing with my eyes closed
But they don’t see me like they blindfold
I’m no nigga to tell a lie
I keep it real and keep it trill
Searching for that profit, fuck a deal
Still remember days when we ain’t had no meals
And while you boys was at the crib we was in them fields
You really had the bill, we really put in work
So it’s never sucka shit if they mentioning Turk
You know wussup, to raise the wall and join I roll a blunt
And then we match up, real niggas doing what they want

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
I got John Matton jumpin', yea I got them plays
They 5 grand a piece but you could get the two for 8
I got 4 rings on me like a Audi car
All them diamonds dancing, shining in my Audemar
The coupe wheels all shine from that amera
All these artists with me, please don’t make em draw
Shit they always with me, I ain’t gotta make a call
All them bottles turn to weapons, we don’t drink em all
I Tony Hawk the police, I’m skatin'
For you niggas just to try me, I’m waitin'
48 hunned band, I’m reppin'
Pass it to a jay first, that’s just a tester
I teach you how to hustle up, yea that’s a lesson
In a minute and a half, 1000, 90 seconds
I said I’ll teach you how to hustle up, yea that’s a lesson
Made 1000 in 90 seconds, do the math

[Hook]
