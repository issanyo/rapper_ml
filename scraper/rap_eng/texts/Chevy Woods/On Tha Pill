Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Sha-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill

[Verse 1 - Chevy Woods]
So baby come fly with a nigga who space surf
She know how to dive, she don't jump, it's face first
I let her log on and play with my laptop
â€œWe so high up Heinz Field in the backdrop
I roll a bat she catch balls like a backstop
D-12 baby and ya man just a matchbox
I get cash really honey this is me
I'm the drug she's a plug, she in love with tha D
Never give it to her raw, no seeds like tha weed
So don't be blind to the fact, baby girl come and see
I get money with an attitude that's mad cash
But when you walked past, I was like damn
She want me to give her my all
I'm talkin' one night, no feelings involved
Early morn no passion, show her my flight school skills - no crashin'

[Hook]
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm rollin x8

Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Sha-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill x6

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
Okay!
Uh oh
Everything Taylor'd, room with no neighbors
Hop inside and we'll go where a bird or a plane is
And what's your name is, and who ya came with, listen
I'mma take you out and put in the right position, oh
And tell your nigga I ain't trippin
Never fallin' off, I ain't slackin' on my pimpin'
Niggas call me weirdo, bitches call me different
Send me naked pics when I'm on the road
Just to let you know
I think it's beautiful
Soon as I get home, I'm rushin' over like a head start
Fresh up out the shower to the sofa skip the bed part
A sharp shooter, young Bret Hart
Probably would like to, Hollywood night you
Red eye flight you, somewhere near we can get lost
And let you pop off
Gone

[Hook]
