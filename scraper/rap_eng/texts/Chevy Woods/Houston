[Hook x2]
If it ain't about the money nigga, I don't wanna hear it
Way in the UK if it ain't foreign nigga, I don't wanna wear it
Pulled up in the foreign from a block away vroom, ya can hear it
I ain't scared of no nigga, it's only God that I'm fearing

[Verse 1]
Pull up with yo main bitch, what you talking about
Cuz she only wanna fuck a nigga, cuz I'm hot now
Let em say I ain't getting money, bitch stop now
Cuz they ain't be no snitching over here mothafucka don't you ever bring the cops round
All my niggas with the gang and you know they gon' throwed at
If you repping this club, girl you know you gotta throw that
Real niggas step in the building, real money will be rocking the club
Know your bitch mad that you with you cuz you wanna come fuck with a thug
All my niggas stay down, still down with it
If ya talking about the money boy, lets go get it
Got a heavy plan for it though, shits real my nigga
I'm cold hearted bout this money I don't care how you feel my nigga


[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Still down with the day ones
Yeah I'm still down with the day ones
All them niggas my niggas

All this champagne bottles in this motherfucking club girl you know you gotta drink that
Now I know your name girl, gimme your [?] take back
Clicquot for my niggas
Ciroq for the hoes
I be having drinks on how high a nigga get that shit for low
Don't trip my nigga I could make a phone call if ya want that bird
And I ain't even tripping on your bitch homeboy I don't want that bird
But a nigga still flexing and I'm way up in Texas
Some way up in Houston
And your bitch still texting
