[Verse 1 – Chevy Woods]
Man these broke ass niggas keep talking bout money
Pussy nigga tell them niggas what’s the situation
Got my feet up, eating good every night, home boy I’m situated
Get left, I ain’t tripping, nigga make something out the situation
Is them niggas that you running with gon’ bust back when it’s the situation
Boy I’m cold with the flow every line that I say like a sick [?]
You work all night on the street out there, ain’t you sick of patient
Man I got 100 flows, man I did 100 shows, you could pick your favorite
Told me she don’t fuck with you niggas cause you motherfucking niggas basic
Money counter and a couple trash bags, nigga that’s the situation

Sipping on the brown right now, [?] sitting in the bottom of my cup boy

[Hook – Chevy Woods]
You ain’t talking bout money, you ain’t talking bout shit
Pussy nigga what’s your situation

Big money that’s the situation, with your bitch, that’s the situation
With my niggas in the club popping bottles, hell yeah that’s the motherfucking situation
Big money, big crib, big car, that’s the situation

[Verse 2 – Wiz Khalifa]
I [?] like my car was stopped at the light
She leaving me then she fucking tonight
Fuck me once, love me the rest of your life
Made her feel comfortable, let her cum twice
Roll up my weed like my drink with no ice
Niggas just want to be me, no surprise
I could do more in my sleep than you guys could do all in a week
Roll up a plane, call it frequently flying
I take my bitch shopping, she freak then I’m buying
Talk when I want, ain’t no speaking to mine
Been had the money, the secret is time
Come to the party just reeking the pine
Want the whole thing, not a piece of the pie
Got me an O, the bitch think that she fine
I’m smoking the drink while she drinking some wine
Give her that dick, felt it deep in her spine
I talk a good game, get deep in her mind
Was gay, now she thinking she straight
My money is straight
My flight come in private and shorty its seats don’t recline
Ain’t dropping a dime, I’m getting this cake
So close you could talk to the pilot
My new bitch in college, the fuck boy you tryna kick knowledge

[Hook – Chevy Woods]
You ain’t talking bout money, you ain’t talking bout shit
Pussy nigga what’s your situation
You ain’t talking bout money, you ain’t talking bout shit
Pussy nigga what’s your situation
Big money that’s the situation, with your bitch, that’s the situation
With my niggas in the club popping bottles, hell yeah that’s the motherfucking situation
Big money, big crib, big car, that’s the situation
That’s the situation
