[Verse 1]
Bad bitch jockin', aye
Fancy wrist watches, aye
All up in the kitchen whippin', got my wrist lockin', aye
Told her Imma catch her on the rebound Dennis Rodman, aye
She said she down to top me told that lil' bitch hop in, aye
We just did [?], aye
All these big diamonds, aye
Shopping spree buying bitch a nigga been shinin', aye
Bad yellow thick red bone know she got it
Know this bad lil' chocolate on a visit from the bottom, aye
Oh yea we got it again
You can bring all of your friends
Party then party some more got the Cartier's on paid a stack for the lenses
Bitch I still got it pussy niggas been plotting
Broke niggas still starving in the bleachers still watch us

[Chorus]
Say you getting all this money what you mad for
Hit the coop and throw the chickens in the RAV4
Everyday we be ducking from the task force
Swear to god all my niggas know it's back and forth
Runnin' back and forth, youngin' runnin' runnin' back and forth
Youngin' runnin' back and forth
Youngin' runnin' back and forth

[Verse 2]
I don't know you how the fuck you get my phone number
Could be the feds no I don't fuck with them unkown numbers (Hello?)
She the champ, got them bitches mad, they don't understand
I'm just sayin', bitches be like that you fuckin' with the man
What's the plan baby can't be bland, fuck you in the sand
Like you dream, you could live your dreams, keep up if you can
Where I'm from it's just motherfuck the task force
Hundred thousand transactions at the back door
Niggas foul they ain't living by the G code
Look how them rat as niggas told on Tico
We just ballin' shit like Jordan at the free throw
In the crib watching Tony snort a kilo

[Chorus]
Say you getting all this money what you mad for
Hit the coop and throw the chickens in the RAV4
Everyday we be ducking from the task force
Swear to god all my niggas know it's back and forth
Runnin' back and forth, youngin' runnin' runnin' back and forth
Youngin' runnin' back and forth
Youngin' runnin' back and forth
I don't know you how the fuck you get my phone number
