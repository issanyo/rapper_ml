[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
I been in and out of town, now
See you every time a nigga come around, now
Love the way you put it down, now
Know Its a hunnid when you smile, now
Told her baby hit the lights, we about to handle our business
Say a nigga name when I'm in it
We can keep going don't stop til' you finish
All paid for hell nah it ain't rented
We can do whatever that you want when we in it yea yea
All the money coming in Imma spend it yea yea
Heard [?] really get it yea yea
Boy them streets cold I was really in it yea yea
Put in overtime, put in overtime
This ain't over night it was over time
Gotta keep it on me 'cause they wanting mine, yea
Hustle everyday fuck a 9 to 5

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I get money everyday on the East Side
Bought the trees from the West Side
House party on the South Side
Call my niggas from the North Side
We be on it we be on it yea
We be on it we be on it yea yea
We be on it we be on it yea
We be on it we be on it yea yea

[Bridge]
You know the life of a rolling stone
You never know
It's safe to say it ain't safe to say
Yea

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
In love with my Taylor's in love with my squad
Spend one night with me now she going far
Have sex in the bed, we smoke in the car
The life that I live, you know I'm a star
Tired of paying for Uber's for broads
You ain't got no cake, then stay where you are
Khalifa the man, Khalifa a boss
No top on the car, she reach for the stars
Oh yea, I been getting money oh yea
Everybody put they hands up in the air
Imma always do my thing I ain't going away yea
I'm a roll this paper plane up like a playa
It ain't nothing but some gangsters up in here

[Chorus: Chevy Woods & (Wiz Khalifa)]
I get money everyday on the East Side (What up Chev)
Bought the trees from the West Side (Gangsters only man 48 Hunnid)
House party on the South Side (TGOD we do all the things)
Call my niggas from the North Side (Yessir)
We be on it we be on it yea (We be on that paper chase)
We be on it we be on it yea yea (We be getting money we be getting money)
We be on it we be on it yea (We be spreadin' love, we be spreadin' love)
We be on it we be on it yea yea (We do what we want, we do what we want)

[Bridge: (Wiz Khalifa)]
You know the life of a rolling stone (Do exactly what we want to, when we want to)
You never know (Go exactly where we wanna go)
It's safe to say it ain't safe to say (Blow that money where we wanna blow 'cause we gon' get it back we don't mind spend that)
Yea
