[Verse]
Tell them bitch niggas I'm ready
We eatin', can't here what they sayin'
Sub tweetin' niggas, we see em', we catch em' and now they was playin'
On Instagram, flexin' in pictures, man that's just to make up your life
Baby we gonna get it on, so you won't need no makeup tonight
5 grand enough for a show, and I just did 5 in a week
10 to the single no radio play man no money to speak
She want it I got it, she told me you lost it, my nigga too bad
So shout out to Will and the captain my homies we stuck to the plan
All this can't fit in the bag
All of this money I'm gettin', they mad
You just a loser, don't want me to win
Window come down when they spinnin' that bend
Donuts in foreign's we spinning them Benz
I make a lot and it's never goin' to end
Oh yeah that's cool, you and your friends
[?]
Yeah nigga
Nigga we made it
Taylor Gang
LA Leakers man
Ya'll ready for that 30 D man, we bout to turn it up
