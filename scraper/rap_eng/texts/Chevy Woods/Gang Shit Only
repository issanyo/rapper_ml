[Verse 1]
Watch a nigga go beast mode
Marshawn Lynch shit I'm living by the G code
Never let a nigga change me
Landed out in San Fran told that bitch [?] me
Hit my nigga Berner with the wussup
They never understood us fuckin' niggas throw my hood up
Riding in a stolen young niggas with they hood up
They ain't get the whole bag I swear I wish they would've
Kevin Love with a key, off white tall white, boy I'm Dirk with the three
You ain't allowed where I be
See them red and blue lights skrt-skrt on police

[Chorus]
I be doing hella shit
Lemme fuck you for the hell of it
Fuck that nigga he irrelevant
Shoot the fade we could settle it

[Verse 2]
I ain't never give 'em no names
Ask my cousin had the plug with the cocaine
Doin' 100 in a slow lane
Diamonds dancing like it's Soul Train
Bitch it's gang shit only, tell your baby daddy stop acting like he know me
20 shots like I'm Kobe
Panoramic roof on the Spur like Ginobli
Out the bag like Wizzle, talking all this gun shit and never shot a pistol
Boy don't make your momma miss you
Fucking with them Taylors that's a issue

[Chorus]
I be doing hella shit
Lemme fuck you for the hell of it
Fuck that nigga he irrelevant
Shoot the fade we could settle it
