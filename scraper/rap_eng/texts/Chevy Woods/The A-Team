[Verse 1]
Hotel room with the city view
She got a brand new car, new titties too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, girl, feelin' you
I'm tryna find out what you tryna really do
Started askin' all these questions, this a interview?
Big body take up lanes when I'm wheelin' through
Niggas Satan, I'm like "Ooh, I'ma deal with you"
I ain't never sown nothin' in the field with you
Win a song, what you want, nigga? Tell me what you want
I just need a call, got the bag in the trunk
Niggas claimin' bitches that they ain't even fuck
Money on my mind and they never enough
Had a pack ready when I touch down, yeah

Bitch talkin' 'bout she in love now, yeah
I just dropped a four in a crush now, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' like T Cole in a Lexus
All these champagne bottles I be flexin'
Gettin' to it, I just hope you get the message
I just got me a bag down in Texas
Five hundred dollars for the room service
She gon' pull up and give me room service
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, don't you get nervous
What the fuck you lyin' for like you need courage?
Many pussy-ass niggas, they be watchin' my pockets
Think a nigga sweet, nigga, watch when I pop it
Talkin' like you on, nigga, you are not poppin'
Taylor Gang shit, nigga, that's how I'm rockin'
She just pulled up in a six forty-five
Junked out, killin' 'em in 'em red bottoms
When I'm feelin' like I'm sick, she come over for a fix
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, she the head doctor

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, betcha feelin' me
