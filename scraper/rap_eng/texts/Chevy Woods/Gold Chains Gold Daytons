[Hook X2]
Gold chains, nigga gold daytons
Bum niggas ain't got no patience
Young niggas tryna get a name
And the cycle probably will never change

[Verse 1]
That's real shit where I come from
You probably wouldn't make it where I come from
Hes 17 and he ain't got one gun
And he roll with the groupie niggas
I feel the same way do it the bodies shit I swear to god
Hitman for the bread man that's just his job
Gotta do what he gotta do to survive the streets
And hes up all night cuz hes tryna eat
Moms don't give a fuck, dad neither
And he don't fuck with his brother cuz he a woman beater
That's real shit he just play us cards
Just think man whats this art
