[Verse 1]
Junkies on my line cause they know I got it
Servin' crazy white, girl, that Lorena Bobbitt
And the kitchen yeah that's where a nigga lock it up
Took a whole hour just for me to rock it up
Hot spoons, straight drop soon
Dice game seven back-to-back, nobody move
I could talk about this shit cause yeah I had to work
My triple shotgun, pistol in her purse
So all that drug talking, nothing new to me
100 thousand off a tour ya thats a coupe to me
If you talking bout that money bitch me all ears
You popping rozay, nigga all you hear is cheers
Gucci dough that's foreign you ain't never been
From the hood my plugs black don't know no Mexicans
Every 30 seconds I was getting calls
You shop with me no I.O.U.'s if I don't fuck with y'all
Ball

[Verse 2]
We hit the mall in this we don't look at no tags
No dirty money in that brown giant eagle bag, uh
All eyes on me I'm feeling like I'm 2Pac
Them pussies miss cause they just licked off 2 shots
TGOD we heavy and you light weight
You on the corner with a quarter, that's that light weight
My car has horse power around the USA
My Louis belt that's off the Louis store out in LA
I had that dirty money now I only check
My watch thats 60 thousand I give me respect
TGOD that's Taylor Gang
That's a thunderstorm cause we don't make it rain
Grab a couple gin, couple bottles pink
My pinky ring pimping shit so baby watch the mink
Bitch we living good, but how you living on?
Shout out my hardcore niggers is you jigging ho?
Oh!
