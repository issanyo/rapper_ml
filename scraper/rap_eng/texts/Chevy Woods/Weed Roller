[Intro: EZ Wider]
It's your boy Mr. EZ Wider
And there's nothing I love more
Then to come home to a nice fat, bold blunt
And if you feel the same, call up

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober
She know exactly what I need she keep them swishers
The way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her I gotta keep her

[Verse 1: Kev Tha Hustla]
That's good weed and she knows so she don't fuck up my swisher
She roll that thing that hit hard like a kicker
I hit the bed and then I get to twist her
Just like my swisher
And she's my weed roller
A 50 box she rolled 'em I was like damn
She lit the first one up like you know who I am
My weed roller
She's only good for three blunts then it's over

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
She know I need that weed as soon I come home off the road
To make it easy on me she got one already rolled
A nice long swisher
And shes a good twister
Yeah I got one that will roll my weed for me
And she don't smoke so that's more weed for me
No I can't front this shawty got me impressed
Make a cigarillo look like a cigarette

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
