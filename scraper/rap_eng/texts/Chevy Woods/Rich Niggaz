[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Uh, I'm a get arrogant fuck it
Watch 60,000 you hate it or you love it

Out on that corner that Kirby, no Puckett
Pull up the car got em droppin' they jaws
Pull out the chain got em dropping they drawers
Pull out some money she doing a dance
Shit all this money can't fit in my pants
She got a thing for them ballers for sure
And in the bedroom she model them clothes

Swerving like I had too much to drink

That's what I screamed out the roof of that thing
Bumpin' Gucci Gucci in my coupe just to provoke niggas
Damn right, pens ain't wanna get my hand right
