2 red cups, gin in it with mad ice
Smoking like a Taylor over show, you for show right
I just keep it g, I just keep it g
I just keep it g baby, I just keep it g

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Convertible top off, I just keep it g, g, I just keep it g, g, I just keep it g
Know your bitch wanna fuck with me cause I keep it g
You're a sucker nigga, I'm a nigga from the streets
Get it in the heat, we ain't talking top
Old nigga you sleep, pillow talking to them broads
Never seen a key, I ain't talking open doors
I'm talking about that white glass house marble floor
I got the bitches bagging up and they all naked
That's A1 steak sauce, you ain't gotta test it
It's hotter than a motherfucker, all my stove's on
By tonight, all the work gone

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Clear cut stones, bought the jewels
See my shit, it look like a pool
Don't mind me though, I'm just doing me
Just a regular, just the life I lead
Or the life I live, don't mix it up
Unless it's we, twist it up
I just keep it gg, I just keep it gg
I don't fuck with you, you don't fuck with me
I'm bout my paper, I'm bout my scratch
You bout your bread, go and handle that
Feast my nigga, it's a big table
Comcast go fishin, I'm watching cable

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
2 red cups, one filled up with hella ice
OG kush, could tell just by the smell is right
Try and call my phone but I was on a private flight
You be tricking off, but I just give her hella' pipe
Plus she rep my gang, she roll my weed, she down for life
I say get on this plane and I ain't gotta tell her twice
I'm out here doing my thang I ball they ain't seen off of me
I bough six of them chains And gave them shits to all my niggas
Make the money tall my nigga, when it's summer fall my niggers
If there's ever problems in your face don't have to call my niggers
You repping taylors, that's what they call my niggers
I'm rolling papers to smoke with all them niggers
