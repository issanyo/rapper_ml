Pocket full of money i don't fuck with loose change
Your bitch look like dinner she a pray food chain
Stay up out your feelings, I don't fuck with mood swings
I can save you baby look that's just the truth hey

Just walked in my closet and got nauseous
Brand new designer shit so please proceed with caution
See people talking 'bout they got it
But they don't rock it how I rock it, hold on
You see these Yves Saint Laurent pieces
Chains that I got on
Rings and shit thats made for me you won't see in the store
A whole section of shit that I don't even wear no more
Smoking
Pull up in that new Celine joint
Open
