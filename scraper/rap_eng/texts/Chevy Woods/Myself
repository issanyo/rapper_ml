[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Pulled up and they was like (holy shit)
Suicide doors on the spaceship
You gon' let me go deep, could you take it?
Coke bottle, you ain't no model
It's going up in the Bay, watch the hoes follow
Deep dish on them hundred spokes
Hop out, play dead, ever seen a ghost?
Don't front you want to come to the palace
I just put this fit together, I don't need me no stylist
Your baby daddy be mad, all this money I'm pilin'
And he can't afford to take you on a trip to an island
What's he smokin' on, salad?
I'm on gas
You a sucka', she puttin' you on blast
Yeah my car got a chip and it go fast
You first place, she told me you don't last
And when she with me, she flippin' and throw ass
You see before you niggas got low cash

[Hook: Sage the Gemini]
You ain't gotta love me, I love myself
I’ma have to do the job myself
I don’t keep it if you don’t wanna be kept
Bitch you don’t love me you love my wealth
(x2)

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
I'm in Beverly Hills
With a girl named Beverly
Trying to feel on her Beverly hills
None of you niggas real
All y'all fake like cyber skin
Meet bitches off the internet, round up my cyber wins
My car got WiFi, dammit I'm trying to win
I'm doing donuts on the internet, fuck it they cyber spins
Walk in the room and they bringin' your idol in
Your girl wetter than water spouts when I'm driving my Spyder in
Girls be annoying, I don't have the tolerance
Drive coupes with the seats that I only let models fit
Freshest nigga out there, it's tags I'm poppin' it
Attracted to her butt and the girl that's poppin' it
See me in your mamma house, sonnin' you up
You be like "mom how was your day?"
And then I interrupt
Like, "damn nigga, in high school you was the man, nigga"
"Fuck happened to you?"
Hey!

[Hook]
