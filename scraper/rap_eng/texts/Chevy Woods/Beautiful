[Verse 1]
Hollywood trip
The lessons with the luggage, ugh!
All summer you know that I'm ready
All my macho man shit, got me feeling like ready
All this money that I'm getting, you know I'm a problem
I heard that work work work, nigga shout out at Rihanna
Your bitch in a whore race, she on that pool shit
[?] some Trump's day party, this pool lit
All these hundreds that I'm getting, I just count my blessings
And if they pull that tommy on you, better give the step in
Told my momma that don't make 'em like this, she like I don't understand how you got patience like this
On the corner with my niggas, we was racing like this
I mean you know where I'm from thats how you make it like this
We be champagne sipping, champagne spilling on a 15 hour flight cross the world with my niggas, boy what's up? (boy what's up)
Prolly get your bitch a Uber truck (Uber truck)
And if she ask me for the address, I'ma plug

[Hook]
You gotta hustle for the beautiful life
We all just wanna live that beautiful life, life, life
You gotta hustle for the beautiful life, yeah
We all just wanna live that beautiful life, life, yeah, is real

[Verse 2]
I remember all the nights I was over the stove (over the stove)
And all 'em transactions over the phone (over the phone)
Thank the lord they ain't indict me
Ran my shit like a business, I was done by three
Touching paper, I got it, I love the smell of it (smell of it)
And never fucked with 'em niggas, I failed to tell something (tell something)
Could give a fuck if you broke, get up and sell something
Man, you don't know about this life, is why the [?] homie
You gotta, teach your kids that the streets ain't for 'em
Lil homie want me friends and he way too gone
Now [?] girl just stay strong
And his father in the jail like where did I go wrong
Man the streets ain't safe, swear these niggas will bury you
But this the same shit, that they say that they marry to (marry to)
Same streets got my niggas a federal, is way much more, think about I'm telling you

[Bridge]
We just wanna live, we just wanna live
We just wanna live, we just wanna live
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful


[Hook]
You gotta hustle for the beautiful life
We all just wanna live that beautiful life, life, life
You gotta hustle for the beautiful life, yeah
We all just wanna live that beautiful life, life, is real
