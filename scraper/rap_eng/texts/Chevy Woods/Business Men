[Verse 1]
Toast to him and I ain’t talkin' a celebration
Gon' have to chop you out, from these set of erasers
Leave your camel suit empty, that’s lie to your noodle
Then I’m on the beast, just me that’s watching the strudel
All them bricks that I had up in that Izuzu
Pit fights, I’ve seen the loudest dogs turn poodle
Black frame just like tint
My new wheel got presidential, amen
I pray to God you niggas lose the hate
‘Cause if not my lawyer bubblegum the case
Yea, he from Charleston, he just chew well
And eating cases is what he do well
Dumb is down, I think not
I seen Swiss pull up to the show in a yacht
Shit, that’s more motivation for us
I’m Taylor Gang, what more is there to discuss?

[Hook]
All these cham bottles, that’s ridiculous
That’s just a saying, be sure we getting it
Puff said he’s bout the Benjamins
So don’t return when you send your men
Cool seats, same color as cinnamon
No discussion ‘cus that’s the end of it (word)
You come up sure ain’t no business then
We business men

[Verse 2]
I still got old rhymes that’ll kill yall
But I ain’t gotta go in that vault
This the crew do stir, you just roll with a bum
They see me work, now they wanna know what I want for a show
You wanna talk about notes, let’s see that
Not about that money, I’ll never be that
There’s razor blade cuts all on the table
Foreign the Sprite like who’s sippin the maple
I got 6 digit phone calls
So why not would I catch the alley oop
You know these boys right there, they got army guns
So don’t make me call up the troops
‘Cus I’m just cool and relaxing, I’m faded
It’s what I do, nothing new, I’m just the latest
Look at they faces is red
And they hated hospital clothes
You can’t get it ‘cus you ain’t got no patience pussy

[Hook]
