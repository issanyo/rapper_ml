You know I’m reppin’ Taylor
All my weed from Cali, so you know I’m smokin flavour
Ain't fuckin with blunts, you know we only smokin’ paper
And I throw it up so that you know just what my name is
Muthafuck a hater

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
Left the crib with 10 grand bought a hundred pair
I’m the coach I can show you how to be a player
5/8 is the fitted, bitches love my hair
Camo shorts go with anything I wanna wear

[Hook]
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]
Rolex, more sex, good weed, no stress
Run my town, arms, chest, lift weights, bowflex
Throw your set up, what you rep when you twistin’ ya fingers?
Real recognize real and my nig you a stranger
Got a bank full of scrilla, a brain full of papers
Got a phone full of hoes, and a gang full of Taylors

[Hook]
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang

[Chevy Woods]
You see me out I rep my gang
Used serve that John McCain, that John McCain
Hold up they dont know my name?
Chevy who? Chevy who?
Look at all that shit them dollars do
Gettin’ all this money wit you know who
It’s Taylor Gang over you
We poppin bottles gang signs
All my niggas gang signs
Rollin up gang signs
Niggas trippin, bang time
Hold up, what they say bout us?
Same niggas gotta get the OK bout stuff
They ain't in the same league
They don’t play like us
No stems, no seeds, keep that rolled up
Bang on them hoes, we does that
Socket work, I just had a plug for that
Get your taylor on
Hold for whatever you rep
Throwin up the gang, 4800 still reppin a set
