[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Chevy please let me roll this weed up
This the main event so watch the people pull they seats up
Bottle of some gin, let's just hit a couple freaks up
I'mma take one home and have her singing like the Glee Club
Never on no cheap stuff
Here we got expensive taste
Green lights, never press the breaks
You can look at us roll
All the kush that we blow
You know Iâ€™m at the shows looking good for these hoes
Got they man on patrol
Shorty wanna live it up
Playing hard to get but she wanna give it up
Yeah you smoking good but I'm probably smoking better
151, taking shots with no Baretta
Know me homie, I'm the king
You could watch me do my thing
With a drink getting drunk, having one night flings
This is Pittsburgh, home of the six rings
We getting money now, all we hear is "Chi-ching"

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
And we do anything to get this paper
So they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit, we ain't got later
Cause we out here on this road
And we do anything to get this paper
So they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit, we ain't got later
Cause we out here on this road

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Cool ass, fly around, chilling, young fool
Gin cup sipping, that's me, that's what I do
I got the gang in my bloodstream, strong how I'm living
And now I'm G'D up so they just throw away the kitten
I swear you hella bad the homie Mac tell me about you
But we cool if you stuck up we can go without you
We on the money we schoolin' you know you wanna be on the block
I swear the homie got a gift so he don't need the block
Zig Zag papers, king size
Smoking chilling in angry cars, mean rides
Pops was a hustler and Moms ran track
So tell me what you get in me when you mix that
I just sit back light mines
And middle finger you suckers with my nice rhymes
So whether home or on the road
We getting dough it follows us everywhere we go

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
And we do anything to get this paper
So they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit, we ain't got later
Cause we out here on this road
And we do anything to get this paper
So they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit, we ain't got later
Cause we out here on this road
