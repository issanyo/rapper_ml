Haha, Trippy, 2050

[Verse 1]
I go on and on and on and uh
7:30 A crazy morning uh
2, 3 I'm up in my zone and uh
Try to copy me who's them cloning uh
All wanna be just wanna be and all of the things just wanna be
And you tell your girl who you wanna be
A nigga that you seen on the TV
You know a nigga gotta live by the g code
That ain't yours gimme that, repo
All champagne rozay campaign
Leave a nigga in the uh my last name
Small face fifty bills that's all cash
See a nigga on site all smash
Kick game how I got it from the OGs
No sticks no seeds in my OZ

[Hook]
Tell me where you wanna go
To a place nobody knows
What is crazy, yea it's crazy
I said it's crazy, crazy, crazy

Yea, Yea, Uh, Yea

[Verse 2]
In a world of aliens and spaceships
I be uh nigga I make hits
Flow so smooth like a slick perm
No you hit tunes, that's Big Jerm
I'm big worm, hope you getting mine
If you don't better have it by the night time
A little white whine, no white lines
Same niggas i'd a bounce on the sideline
I'm prime time I'mma do my dance on 'em
I go to (...) I'mma slam on 'em
I know these niggas wishin' I'mma jam on 'em
I know a couple killers no cam on 'em
On and on and on and uh
7:30 A crazy morning uh
2, 3 I'm up in my zone and uh
Try to copy me who's them cloning uh

[Hook]
Tell me where you wanna go
To a place nobody knows
What is crazy, yea it's crazy
I said it's crazy, crazy, crazy

Sorry guys, need to go. to be continued by me or anyone who wants to... TGODJ
