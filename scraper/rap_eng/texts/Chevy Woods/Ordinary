[Verse 1]
I still run with them same niggas - still run on that same block
Still running from police - still ducking them same cops
Boy, that two-seater, yeah, you know that Coupe mean
Niggas making them false statements
They don’t really know what the truth means
That’s alright, that’s cool, though, they gone learn up
And you damn right that’s a whole pound, my nigga roll up
Boss shit – yeah, we be on that boss shit
Niggas had it, couldn’t handle it, so it’s safe to say that they lost it
Bossip, aw shit, M-O-B, on that mob shit
Talking about who you gone rob, bitch?
I’m fully equipped with this rocket
Nah’mean? It ain’t even worth it
Throw my frames on, now that’s picture perfect

[Hook X2]
Them girls wanna party, they gone off that liquor
I’m telling them all to come fuck with my niggas
They single, they want what we do, it’s so different
Do it so different

[Verse 2]
Word – my niggas like hoes that like hoes
Arguing with that desk bitch
Like “fuck you mean that my flight closed?”
Sweatsuits, yeah bitch, they’re my flight clothes
Music playing in my iPod, I’m in high mode
High mode, ultra beast, niggas all on them old gangs
I was thinking about how to make a million off cocaine
That’s hard to do when niggas ain’t gon’ play they role
Man I should call, a couple niggas told
Them long nights - them cold days
Them two-way streets – them one-ways
That car read a lot of money, nigga, that’s ball park
And you, you was a bitch in school, nigga, we call that Hallmark

[Hook]
