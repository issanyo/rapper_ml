[Intro]
TGOD, Ricky P, yeah I'm on my shit

[Hook]
In this place feel the empty space
Your love holds the key, baby…
In this place full of empty space
Your soul contain the love, the love will shine for me

[Verse 1]
Oh, get a look at my watch
Over that stove, get a look at that pot
Uh, get a look at the hood
4800 I’ll be up in that block
Uh, you know they.. and shooting
Crazy they’ll be killing shit
Young nigga fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, ak's with banana clips
Getting high than the mother fuckers and their moms never know about it
Shit I love my city, shit I love my hood
I’m just trying to make it out here
See all these money right here that… old money from my past life shit
Everybody talking green but them niggas don’t ever go like this
Two Chainz with a Glock... pulling money, tell me who can I lean on
Smell that Cali in the air, you can smell it ain't even lit
Man, that weed is strong! And you know that’s TGOD
Got me in a booth about the OD
Many fucked up boys don’t know me, uh

(Aha, I had to act another one)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get money, young nigga
I’ve been getting money since I was young nigga
Dirty money young nigga
Now a nigga got a lot of bank funds, nigga!
Fucks wrong with you niggas
As a matter of fact I don’t care what’s wrong with you nigga
Shit what I long for these niggas
I ain’t got no love, work out hard for these niggas!
Fuck them right, up on that court
You know damn well, I’mma ball with my niggas
Think I like the way everybody talk a shit
Tell me, am I wrong for trying to ball with my nigga?
And that’s South beach that… on that top floor
Popping champagne, it’s the life you chose, man
What a fuck is you here for?
Huh, just the question that I got for you
Since you worry about anything I do
Them cars out, my jewelery out, my bitch bad, her… real
Real nigga, I don’t give a fuck how you feel!

[Hook]
