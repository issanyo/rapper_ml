[Intro]
Taylor gang shit
4800 shit
I be back on that shit

Smokin that dope
Money
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
My bitch thick she got cake everyday
Ain't 'bout money stay the fuck up out my way
You be trolling stay the fuck off my page
Bread winner nigga free Cam Vigates

Fuck the feds they was trying to tap my phone
Popped a xanny now she can't make it home
I'm a player hit up lay-ups like Jerome
Two or three joints now I'm in my zone

Fuck the cops load bricks bitch I'm gone
Macaulay Culkin home invasion home alone
Big dog shit I put the whip on chrome
You be tweakin' bitch you made as fuck she chose

She too sloppy nigga come and get yo hoe
No olympics they just runnin up with that pole
Taylor gang shit you know just how I go
(brr brr brr brr) What you need nigga hello (hello)

Bitch fuck the talkin I'm just tryin' to feed your face
Diamonds dancin' bitch watch em through the mace (brr brr)
Early morning you be wakin' up too late (early)
STK good steak on my plate (ah)

Bitch fuck the talkin I'm just tryin' to feed your face
Diamonds dancin bitch watch em through the mace (brr brr)
Early morning you be wakin' up too late (early)
STK good steak on my plate (ah)

[Outro]
Taylor Gang shit. Haha
Woop woop. You know how I mean bitch. 4800
Wanna feed your face. Diamonds dancin' bitch watch em through the mace. Hahah
