Sometimes I think
What if I accepted a handout?
And then work on my own
So when it all goes down, who’s leaving by your side?
Gotta keep the circle close, never let the evil get inside
Something from the early 90’s, threw the speakers in my ride
My head rest on the head rests, I’m speedin’ and I’m high
And I don’t plan on slowin’ down
No break pass, freestyle bike
Hold up, this don’t look right
They copy us, they style by
Just wanna step dance
And they’ll do anything for it
My jump shot on point
Fuck them niggas I’mma keep scorin’
They blinded to that bullshit
Can’t really feel what’s important
Oh cause I’m workin’ hard, you think that I’m ignorin’
Your phone call, tour textes, when I was out in Texas
I entered what’s called business and I don’t see a accent
So tell me what am I to do?
Never feelin’ like it’s all for nothin’
That’s just how it be when you get the buzzin’
New friends, distant cousins
Who never lend a hand when you was getting nothing

And I never asked you for nothing
Cuz I work hard for everything I get
So I never feel like it’s all for nothing
Put one hand up in the air, show me you feelin’ it

And I just take it for what it is
I never cried over spilled milk
And from all the bricks I had look what I built
So if you want it it’s there, you gotta drive to get it
I used to drive to get it did like a tiger’s fitted
My own lane, ain’t nobody else in my driveway
Let’s toast to this for thug’s past and you can sip that outazay
I’ll be flyin’ over them clouds
With the world out my window
They tellin’ me slow down
Boy you don’t know what you in for
But I do, my man went through the same
And I didn’t pay the shuttle’s worth to show him he got game
Same niggas talkin’ ‘bout how we dress is lame
With a step of foot let alone wouldn’t make it in this game
I know they just want what we got
But couldn’t picture with a frame
What we doin’ over here is crazy so them bitches go insane
We don’t wanna play their part
So they ain’t never gonna be seen
They just lookin’ over the fences, see how this grass so green

And I never asked you for nothing
Cuz I work hard for everything I get
So I never feel like it’s all for nothing
Put one hand up in the air, show me you feelin’ it
