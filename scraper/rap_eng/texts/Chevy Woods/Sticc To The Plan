[Hook x2]
No hesitation, I know that you want me
But stick to the plan, she calling me daddy
Three clock in the morning on a phone with a nigga like me
Tell your dad he don't wanna fuck around with a nigga like me

[Verse 1]
My [?] I used to do caddy's
And now is she riding, she call me big daddy
My duffle in the phantom, I need it right now
I can't understand you, what is you saying right now
I'm taking these trips out the beach or somewhere that you niggas can't go
I let her remind [?] up on that pole
She told me your brother he got it so now he can die for the low
He told me Que Pasa then hung up cuz he don't talk on the phone
I understand my nigga cuz that's the same shit that I come from
And I could make a bird call for you if you really want one
1 hunnid gram in the floor
1 hunnid gram in the sink
40 on my waist
Where I'm from, ain't safe
No, no

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
She pull on my chain
She know I'm the man
She told me she don't fuck with Taylor Gang
But now I know she a fan
I whistle my baby that [?]
My niggas been trapping and dying I shot out the snow of them niggas
She pouring the liquor
My whip on the course
PW 8, I'm pouring the syrup
Bitch give me my weed
I'm watching them flander
And if theres a problem, my niggas go Rambo
I'm way overseas, I'm throwing up channels
He died by his bed, and he earned a metal
And fuck what your dad says, I know he don't like me
See that's the problem, he wanna be like me
