[Verse 1]
Counting up the bag got another bag coming
If it ain’t bout the money boy you ain’t saying nothing
I’m in love with blue hunnids
She be up and down the pole wat the bands for the summer
Shaking all that ass cause she get it from her mama
She in love with blue hunnids
I’m just tryna run the bands up
Can you do it with your hands up
I like it better with no filter
She performing on the camera
I’m talking big thing rolls
Fuck the judge, cased closed
We just want the money in this rich nigga world
Main bitch with me she ain’t ain’t like a girl
I just treat her like she regular and then give her the world
She in love with blue hunnids
She love me in it for the bag cause the broke boys frontin
Evil Knievel with my gang cause you know we stay stuntin

[Hook]
Counting up the bag got another bag coming
If it ain’t bout the money boy you ain’t saying nothing

She be up and down the pole wat the bands for the summer
Shaking all that ass cause she get it from her mama
She in love with blue hunnids
I’m just tryna run the bands up

She performing on the camera
