[Intro]
Yeah shit’s just different sometimes man, you know what I’m saying
I hate when you pull up in that motherfucking shit though
Know we getting money man
They want your spot, they’ll do anything to take your spot
Oh shit

[Hook]
Pulled up in that old white cadi cocaine
Niggas get to firing, bullets ain't got no name
Do this for my niggas man my niggas never change
I put that on my mama, on the set is Taylor Gang
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup

[Verse 1]
I had the best dope, they ain’t like it though
Bought A 30 gauge with the rifle scope
My cousin on the daily saying a bible verse
I wasn’t there to see my grandad in a hearse
They don’t know the pain when you’re working hard
It’s money over bitches I just rep the squad
And I just do my shit and don’t care what they say
My homie told me get it, what up LA Dre
I try to catch some knowledge just to break a cycle
But we can get a check if they just call us valor
Corn chips and places up to the palace
Got something on your mind then we can talk about it

[Hook]
Pulled up in that old white cadi cocaine
Niggas get to firing, bullets ain't got no name
Do this for my niggas man my niggas never change
I put that on my mama, on the set is Taylor Gang
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup

[Verse 2]
I told my mama pray for me, I on’ know what they thinking
Look I ain't in the way put them in my niggas beefing
And I was outta Vegas and woke up to see niggas tweeting
Right now my nigga Chinx man we just got to speaking
There’s police killing niggas
There’s niggas killing niggas
They say it’s never personal, they always say it’s business
Chinese fool keep the beef low mein
And grandpa always told me fire in a low mein
I’ve never had a problem tryna reap cocaine
They call me in the morning just to ease that pain
We running up them numbers yeah we fucking up the check
And when you hear this shit rewind and give me my respect

[Hook]
Pulled up in that old white cadi cocaine
Niggas get to firing, bullets ain't got no name
Do this for my niggas man my niggas never change
I put that on my mama, on the set is Taylor Gang
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup (wassup)
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup (wassup)
