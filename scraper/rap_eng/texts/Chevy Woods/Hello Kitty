Shawty Make Me Feel Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill Shawty-Shawty Make Me Feel Like We Fuckin on Tha Pill

[Kev Tha Hustla]
So Baby Come Fly Wit A Nigga Who Space Surf
She Know How To Dive She Don't Jump It Face First
I Let Her Log On And Play Wit My Laptop
We So High Up Heinz Field in the Backdrop
I Roll A Bat She Catch Balls Like A Backstop
V-12 Baby And Ya Man Juss A Matchbox
I Get Cash Really Honey This Is Me
I'm The Drug She Tha Plug, She In Love With Tha D
Never Give It To Her Raw, No seeds Like Tha Weed
So Don't Be Blind To The Fact
Baby Girl Come And See, I Get Money Wit An Attitude That's Mad Cash
But When You Walked Passed, I Was Like Damn!

She Want Me To Give Her My All
I'm Talkin One Night, No Feelings Involved
Early Morn No Passion, Show Her My Flight School Skills No Crashin
[Bridge]
Girl Ya Lovin Got Me Gone, Me Gone, Me Gone
You're Like A Drug To Me I'm On, I'm On, I'm On
I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin
[Hook]
Shawty Make Me Feel Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill Shawty-Shawty Make Me Feel Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill

Shawty Make Me Feel Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill Shawty-Shawty Make Me Feel Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/wiz_khalifa/hello_kitty_on_tha_pill.html ]
Shawty Make Me Feel (I'm Rollin) Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill (I'm Rollin) Shawty-Shawty Make Me Feel (I'm Rollin) Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill (I'm Rollin)
Shawty Make Me Feel (I'm Rollin) Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill (I'm Rollin) Shawty-Shawty Make Me Feel (I'm Rollin) Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill (I'm Rollin)

[Wiz Khalifa]
Okay!
Uh Oh, Ery'thing Taylor'd
Room with No Neighbors, Hop Inside And We'll Fly Where A Bird Or Plane Is, Watcha Name Is, And Who Ya Came Wit
Listen, I'mma Take You Out And Put You In That Right Position, oh
And Tell Ya Nigga I Ain't Trippin
Never Fallin Off, I Ain't Slackin On My Pimpin
Niggas Call Me Weirdo, Bitches Call Me Different
Send Me Naked Pics When I'm On The Road
Just To Let You Know, I Think It's Beautiful (Beautiful)
Soon As I Get Home I'm Rushin Over Like A Head Start
Fresh Up Out The Shower To The Sofa Skip The Bed Part

A Sharp Shooter, Young Bret Hart
Prolly Would Like Ta, Hollywood Night Cha
Red Eye Flight Cha, Somewhere Near We Can Get Lost And Let Chu Pop Off
Go
[Bridge]
Girl Ya Lovin Got Me Gone, Me Gone, Me Gone
You're Like A Drug To Me I'm On, I'm On, I'm On
I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin, I'm Rollin
