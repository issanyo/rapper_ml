[Hook]
Time won't wait for you
Hope you know that if you work hard
You get just what you want out of life
Is your life, is your choice
Your choice, your choice, your choice

[Verse 1]
Ugh!
Shout out to 'em corners who paid me, ugh!
Shout out to my momma, she raise me, ugh!
Shout out to 'em calling me crazy, 'cause I could pre ounces in the [?] to a Jefe, ugh!
Never let the fame get to you, but sometimes that bling get to you
You don't understand this blingage, do you?
Sometimes all we had is noodles
And couple T-shirts, couple pants for school
Look, we ain't have a lot but it was manageable
I was tryna spell my name in the[?], ooh
But now I look good on them cameras, ooh

[Hook]
Time won't wait for you
Hope you know that if you work hard
You get just what you want out of life
Is your life, is your choice
Your choice, your choice, your choice

[Verse 2]
(talk to 'em real quick)
Forty-six hundred, forty-eight hundred
I was running back and forth bagging up onions
On some fly shit, I'm like, these niggas bugging meh, I knew to shut it down before the Taskforce come in
Air Force One and never had a budget
Brand new luggage, trips out the country
My cousin [?] told 'bout you bitches
My cousin [?] show me how to whip it
I had scholarships, tuitions, niggas in the prison
I was tryna travel, they was stuck on they pivot
Oh, oh, oh now I get it, you wanna fuck with us 'cause we winning?
Fuck outta here

[Hook]
Time won't wait for you
Hope you know that if you work hard
You get just what you want out of life
Is your life, is your choice
Your choice, your choice, your choice
