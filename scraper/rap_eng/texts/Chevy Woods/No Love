[Chorus]
Where I'm from you know it ain't no love
Steph Curry with the 30 ain't no love
OJ it don't fit it ain't no love
Her niggas tryna blitz it ain't no love
Bitch fuck up out my section ain't no love
You screenshotting them texts it ain't no love
If you ain't down for sex it ain't no love
All these hundreds count my blessings ain't no love

[Verse 1]
Ran into the enemies whats up
Don't get no pass you know it ain't no love
Got super bowl and she play super thug
Don't call me tryna blame it on the drugs
You know the plug and you ain't show no love
You from the hood so boy you know whats up
We gon' show up at your house boy ain't no love
We gon' take his shit you know it ain't no love
We be in the kitchen nigga Popeyes
I'm just flexing on 'em nigga Popeye
Heard you cooperate with feds nigga not I
Need mine like Debo on the bike with the cockeye

[Chorus]
Where I'm from you know it ain't no love
Steph Curry with the 30 ain't no love
OJ it don't fit it ain't no love
Her niggas tryna blitz it ain't no love
Bitch fuck up out my section ain't no love
You screenshotting them texts it ain't no love
If you ain't down for sex it ain't no love
All these hundreds count my blessings ain't no love

[Verse 2]
Used to servin' all them junkies that ain't shit to me
If your baby daddy broke then tell him get with me
Tell him he gotta double back 'cause it ain't shit for free
It ain't shit for free, it ain't shit for free
You ain't never leave the country where your passport
My nigga Dasher had them bricks up in the RAV4
It ain't no love it ain't no love so what you ask for
That's on the gang talk bout the gang and you'll get smashed for it
Hoe wait, pussy nigga you ain't never hold weight
In the kitchen tryna bake a whole cake
Quarter million in my safe I'm straight

[Chorus]
Where I'm from you know it ain't no love
Steph Curry with the 30 ain't no love
OJ it don't fit it ain't no love
Her niggas tryna blitz it ain't no love
Bitch fuck up out my section ain't no love
You screenshotting them texts it ain't no love
If you ain't down for sex it ain't no love
All these hundreds count my blessings ain't no love
