But I still bought that strap
Bitch I knew the burn I had a body on it

Yeah what the fuck you thinking nigga come from
You ain't know that's the bottom
Where them niggas be and they shoot for fun
I got extended clips for them problems
I keep hearin' niggas talkin' bout how it's so hood where they from
But let me tell you something when they made yours
They stopped making them guns
Tryna fit 100 in a rubber band
But you niggas ain't got that problem
Bitch I've been the hustler
You can ask them niggers how I doubled up for that profit
Most of y'all nigga targets
And probably don't even know it
Got a 100 pack with your names around
