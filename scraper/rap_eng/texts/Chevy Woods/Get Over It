[Verse 1]
Say I work too damn hard (too hard)
In the studio too damn long (too long)
Every blunt I smoke too damn strong (yeah, yeah)
Where the fuck you think this money come from?
No more stressing, now I'm over it (no, no)
I just hope that you get over it
Never put no bitches over this
Another party yeah you know we lit, ugh
I'm just riding with the top off, woooo
Baby you could take your top off, woooo
You saying you balling, you should stop dawg, woooo
That's not a Rollie, that's a knockoff, ugh

[Chorus]
No more stressing, now I'm over it, ugh
I just hope that you get over it, ugh
Telling all your friends that you over it, ugh
But we both know you ain't over it
Girl I hope you get over it, yeah
Girl I hope you get over it, yeah
Girl I hope you get over it, yeah
Girl I hope you get over it, yeah
And I hope, I hope, I hope
Yeah, I hope, I hope, I hope, ugh
That one day you get over it, yeah
Go one day you get over this, yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby act like you never knew, woooo
'Cause I'm acting brand new with all this jewellery
Got my brand new flex to make a move
I see you hating from afar, bitch sue (sue me)
Pour that 1942, we on shot two
Got the green light baby, never let them stop you
Told that bitch don't text my phone about the shit we use to do
'Cause when I see you out in public, I'm like who are you?

[Chorus]
No more stressing, now I'm over it, ugh
I just hope that you get over it, ugh
Telling all your friends that you over it, ugh
But we both know you ain't over it
Girl I hope you get over it, yeah
Girl I hope you get over it, yeah
Girl I hope you get over it, yeah
Girl I hope you get over it, yeah
And I hope, I hope, I hope
Yeah, I hope, I hope, I hope, ugh
That one day you get over it, yeah
Go one day you get over this, yeah

Yeah, I'm acting brand new
