[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I'ma do it all for a check
I got all this cash, I don't need your respect
I'ma do it all for a check
If you disrespect then it's off with your neck
I'ma do it all for a check
I got all this cash, I don't need your respect
I'ma do it all for a check
If you disrespect then it's off with your neck

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Drop the clutch and mash it down
Louis belt designer goggles
VIP, I'm poppin' bottles
You see me, you don't want no problems
I'm 'bout this life, I ain't lying
Private jets when we be flying
VVS all in my diamonds
So that's what I just be shining

[Bridge: Chevy Woods]
I be shining, I be shining
I be shining, muh'fucka I be shining

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I'ma do it all for a check
I got all this cash, I don't need your respect
I'ma do it all for a check
If you disrespect then it's off with your neck

[Verse 2: Hardo]
I hit the mall, blow the check, bitch I'm a baller, finesse
I put the coupe in a cress, chasing the bag, I'm obsessed
I'm twenty five getting rich, new forty one on my wrist
Mixing it up, make a twist, then it's gon' sell like a diss
I got drink in my cup, sorry to say man I'm up
Contemplate on them bucks, Gucci signs on my stuff
Doing a limb and fuck a trooper, I got bricks, I'm in a Uber
Bitch, I came up from the sewer, stand and point when I maneuver
Rose gold, yellow gold, straight money, you don't fold
Stack it up until I'm old, put the pyrex on the stove
I put miles on that road, all them times that I done drove
Rose gold, yellow gold, put the pyrex on the stove

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I'ma do it all for a check
I got all this cash, I don't need your respect
I'ma do it all for a check
If you disrespect then it's off with your neck

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
I'm talking molly, percocets, percocets
Got her head on my lap while I'm speeding in the Vette
She gon' do whatever for the set
All this water on my wrist, diamonds dripping on my neck
She just text me like, where the fuck you been?
Bitch I'm getting rich, this two hundred bricks, ooh
I don't know her name, plus I fucker her friend, ooh
I go Ric Flair in the pussy like (woo)
You's a pussy nigga, show me some respect
He official with that whistle, that's a tech
All these blue hunnids on the floor look like a mess
I should be dicing, told them niggas place your bets

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I'ma do it all for a check
I got all this cash, I don't need your respect
I'ma do it all for a check
If you disrespect then it's off with your neck

[Verse 4: Hardo]
Roll up, drink Corona
Uh, roll up a blunt with my high school diploma
I seasoned a curb and it turned into dust
I laugh at a hater for flipping a bus
It was a school bus, it was a Tuesday
Look at your jewelry, why do your rubies look like Twizzlers dipped into Sprite?
Maserati mountain bike, now I'm in Asia sippin' on purple potion
It was the purple palace, uh, now it's the codeine castle

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I'ma do it all for a check
I got all this cash, I don't need your respect
I'ma do it all for a check
If you disrespect then it's off with your neck
I'ma do it all for a check
I got all this cash, I don't need your respect
I'ma do it all for a check
If you disrespect then it's off with your neck
