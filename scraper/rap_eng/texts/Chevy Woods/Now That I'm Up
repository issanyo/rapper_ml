[Hook]
Now that I'm up, wanna fuck with me now that I'm up?
Now that I'm up, wanna fuck with me now that I'm up?
Now that I'm up, wanna fuck with me now that I'm up?
Now that I'm up, wanna fuck with me now that I'm up?

[Verse 1]
I got three or four of my sweet dough
Scorin' easy like free throws
I told her, "Baby, just deepthroat"
And this is all like a week ago
That AP that's three below
Three hands down and that's three below
Gotta watch with when them cars creep in slow
They up the tool and they let it go
"Gangsta's Paradise", Coolio
Catch a bullet quick coolio
Dirty birds sellin' hulio
[?]
Ask some bell, you gotta play a role
Makin' all this money, so I buy what I want
Tell then niggas they pussy, wanna fuck with me cause I'm up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get money, I'm with it
You 'bout it, let's get it
This foreign, let's get it
You know we business
Get money, I'm with it
You 'bout it, let's get it
This foreign, let's get it
You know we business
Quarter chicken
I smell like the kitchen
Them junkies keep callin'
I guess they like my whippin'
This business, them pleasure
They jumped up, that's extra
A triple, a bigy
I weight it, I measure
Now that I'm up, twenty-four's all on that truck
Now that I'm up, all the bad bitches wanna fuck
Now that I'm up, niggas already know that
Now that I'm up, wanna fuck with me now that I'm up?
