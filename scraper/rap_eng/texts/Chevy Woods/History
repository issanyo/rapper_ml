[Chorus: Devin Cruise]
All my diamonds glistening
All my haters pissed at me
All these ladies kissing me
Tonight gon' go down in history
All I know is victory
Finger to my enemies
I got my whole click with me
Tonight gon' go down in history

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Ok this the situation
You ain't fucking ain't no visitation
I'm just tryna make tonight amazing
Eddie Murphy I just want relations
Can you top me off while I just roll this weed
All about whatever's how you supposed to be
I love all my niggas keep 'em close to me
Bitch I been a player ain't no coaching me
I got all my jewelry on, baby tell me what we on
Ain't nobody put me on
Bitch I had a cracking phone

[Chorus: Devin Cruise]
All my diamonds glistening
All my haters pissed at me
All these ladies kissing me
Tonight gon' go down in history
All I know is victory
Finger to my enemies
I got my whole click with me
Tonight gon' go down in history

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Got your baby mama in my DM
Telling me she ready for the weekend
She just hit me told me y'all ain't speaking
Ain't had it in a while and now she tweaking
Two door coupe I drop the top her hair gon' blow
Head all on my lap as she put on a show
Now I'm on this green like where you tryna go
She just told me somewhere that nobody knows
I got all my jewelry on, baby tell me what we on
Ain't nobody put me on
Bitch I had a cracking phone

[Chorus: Devin Cruise]
All my diamonds glistening
All my haters pissed at me
All these ladies kissing me
Tonight gon' go down in history
All I know is victory
Finger to my enemies
I got my whole click with me
Tonight gon' go down in history
