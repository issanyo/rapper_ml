[Hook]
Shorty
Told you
Promised
I’d come back around
(x4)

[Bridge]
And I told you once
Girl I'll tell you twice
I wanna feel all your body
All a part in the same
And I told you once
Girl I'll tell you twice
I wanna feel all your body
All a part in the same
Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
10 bags to rodeo drive
Baby tell me what you like
(Oh)
Girl this AP flooded
Hit the lights we could turn into a light show
Yeah I’m ready for the night show
And ain’t no telling where this might go
Pack your bags, leave the crib
Then meet me here
What you think I got this flight for
That’s my city I’m the only one
Gimme brain then I owe you one
You only here cause you know you up
Don’t bring your friends if they ain’t down to fuck
You say you know us you don’t know enough
You moving too fast, slow it up
We got a house full of bitches
And a mansion in the hills
And a house for the going up

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And I told you once
Girl I'll tell you twice
I wanna feel all your body
All a part in the same
And I told you once
Girl I'll tell you twice
I wanna feel all your body
All a part in the same
Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Ted Park]
I don’t know about your operation
You make me feel all about you
Like this your occupation
We’re together then we split up
This a bit complicated
But this could really be so simple
Baby, back to the basics
I know I’ve been gone for a minute
But girl now I’ve come back home
I know you never forget
But we love and forgive now baby
Let’s get it on

[Hook]
