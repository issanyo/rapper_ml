[Hook: Hardo]
Lord I accept the world you put me in
I hope that you accept me lord for all my sins
Look in the sky's, it just dark clouds around it
Look at my eyes, you see that I'm tired of violence
I've been praying so long
I'm really tried too long
I'm tired around with this chrome
I don't wanna do wrong

[Verse 1: Hardo]
You think I like living this life style
Everyday I got niggas tryna knock my lights out
All these killings, all these robberies
Its kinda hard when a nigga stuck in poverty
Breaking glass all up in outside my house
They had a nigga creeping tryna take me out
I don't never park til I drive around
Know how killas move
Cuz I'ma kill a nigga
Know how robbas move
Cuz I done robbed some nigga
So I'm always a step ahead of you niggas
Everyday another tragedy
Everyday a fatality
So I prayed to god, thanks for calverty
That's the only hope that a nigga got
All the shit I got,  I can't get out back
I'd change it all if I start from scratch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Couple bricks in the rental
Yeah I got yo bitch in the rental
And this the sound of the city
Yeah this the sound of the ghetto
They sleeping and hearing them shots
They letting off heavy metal
Ain't nothing changed to a nigga
You get out of line, they gon' get ya
I'm back on the block, I'm with it
Man you ain't been there for a minute
My old head he told me to get it
I told em I got us some [?]
Bitches you chilling and fucking
All of these tapes in them bricks
Wrap em and [?]
Yeah I know the business, I was it
For niggas thinking I wasn't
I put that shit on my cousin
Yeah I put that shit on my cousin
Tell them the zeros and commas
Protected by 40's and llamas
He tried us and now he a goner
The young niggas do it they wanna

[Hook]
