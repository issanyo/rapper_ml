[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
What up though this is big Snoop Dogg hanging out with DJ Motor Mane, you understand me?
Hit 'em with some of that G shit
(La musica de Harry Fraud)

[Chorus: J.R. Donato]
Rain drops falling on the window of my Benz
I just noticed I don't have a lot of friends
Bring a child into this world, step it up and be a man
I be feeling like the shit, and they calling me the man
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am

[Verse 1: J.R. Donato]
I say they hate to see you come up
They hate to see you hustle but them pounds I gotta turn up
I'm flexing all my muscle boy give shots you try to run up
Cause I ain't finna tussle I got fans way out in London
So dreams do really come true
I'm high as fuck when I come to
Bad bitch tell her come through
Niggas looking for hand outs when you tell them no then its fuck you
Oh well, nigga fuck you I'm in this new coupe and I'm comfortable
Where you're friend I said bring two
Lit with them when ain't nothing to do
Said hell yea I'm the man now, hell yea I got grams now
Pops still doing real estate, hell yea he got land now
And I'm bout to be a father too, don't bother me I won't bother you
Hell yea I got shows to do, hell yea I got pounds to move
Gang

[Chorus: J.R. Donato]
Rain drops falling on the window of my Benz
I just noticed I don't have a lot of friends
Bring a child into this world, step it up and be a man
I be feeling like the shit, and they calling me the man
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
I'm having nightmares feeling it's niggas want me dead
Going through it I got niggas in the feds
Sliding in that brand new Benz I don't need a lot of friends
I'm just living I know one day its gon' end
30 bottles foreign models I'm just trynna ease the pain
Had a convo with myself to never fall in love again
All night till the morning all we know is get paid
How you fall in love with something that won't love you back the same?
Boy them streets them cold yea, case you didn't know yea
48 Hunnid, Taylor Gang, yea yea yea
Pull up on the 'Nolia

[Chorus: J.R. Donato]
Rain drops falling on the window of my Benz
I just noticed I don't have a lot of friends
Bring a child into this world, step it up and be a man
I be feeling like the shit, and they calling me the man
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
They said they want me to stop, but I ain't stopping no
Wonder where I got these Vans but they ain't dropping those
I'm eating lobster bisque, baked at the Pappadeaux
That's my bitch, she your wife, turned her to a proper hoe
I get a lot of dough, I fly a lot of planes
Every time you turn around Young Khalifa copping chains
She yours I got the brains, taught the game
Bitches say I'm not a lame, watch your self out there, these cops insane
They'll do anything to keep us off the streets
So I grind everyday cause Sebastian gotta eat
And the jewels that I rock turn these good girls to freaks
Make 500K a week, bring my cheese then we speak
Capeesh?

[Chorus: J.R. Donato & (Wiz Khalifa)]
Rain drops falling on the window of my Benz
I just noticed I don't have a lot of friends
Bring a child into this world, step it up and be a man (that's cool. I do me you do you)
I be feeling like the shit, and they calling me the man (it's harder than it looks. Pause)
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am (the motherfucking man. look at us now)
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
Hell yea, yes I am, yes I am (just look at us!)
