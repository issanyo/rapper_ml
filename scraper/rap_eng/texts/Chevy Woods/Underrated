[Verse 1]
Man look how far we came without you nigga's
Ya'll play both sides, so now we gotta out you nigga's
My grandma said there would be days like this
And I know grandma, they hate me gettin' paid like this
All these diamonds on a nigga, damn
Gotta pray every night, could have been stuck in that can
These Jordan 1's on a flight to [?]
And I told you nigga's before, I'm still reppin' the set
Champagne and the lobster get your shell cracked
And that bullshit come for free, so you can sell me that
Shooters outside, so don't you wait for us
And they make any place safe for us
Ain't got no talents so they blame us for it
And we never show up there if they don't pay us for it
Brown bag, word to Jeezy and Cali
To the grave to a lot of shit, I don't speak about it


[Hook]
Bring your friends and let's celebrate life, and toast to your [?]
Damn, ew girl I know you love it
Underrated, but I'm still like "fuck it"
Underrated and I fuckin' hate it
The [?] want from you, they don't want you to make it
Gettin' so much, got me dressin' the latest
And I swear to max all the hatin' they wavin'
Underrated, but I'm still like "fuck it"
Underrated and I fuckin' hate it
The [?] want from you, they don't want you to make it
Gettin' so much, got me dressin' the latest
And I swear to max all the hatin' they wavin'

[Verse 2]
Walkin' off stage, they screamin' encore
Just cracked the panel, it's a hundred, in that car door
And I'll never forget where I come from
Heard em' say that they want it, better go and make em' some
It's tug-of-war for that pull of attention
Damn, all these hundreds, I forget to mention
Make it hard for me to answer calls
Keep it real my nigga, you know I still fuck wit ya'll
Yeah, I'm drinking champ it's like ten in the morning
I don't just do this for me, you know that I do this for ya'll
Cause wasn't nobody there for the fall
And just to think, I did this for my dogs
We livin' different, we don't speak the same
Make sure that convo money if you say my name
Yeah, I did all this outta Pittsburgh
Pistols aim, shots fly, clips burn
