[Verse 1: Tyler Johnson]
Stepping to the table with unsurpassed diligence
Killin it, too smart for you to understand how real it gets
I'm a hungry MC, and I hunt until my meal is fed
My insolence is tickled with the idiots I deal with
You're all just "rappers"; fail to see the artistry
An artist you see recongnizes how music's a part of me
Exhausted, all these kids have lost it
Tossed with the gloss and thrill and only care what is costed
I'm To intellegent for the television
Ill teach these children real rhyming until hell is risen
Kev and I are kings, here's the ring, now kneal and kiss it
Us MCs hold the key to unlcok the path that held the vision
To the heart and soul, it's hard to know but it won't stop me kid
I can't sleep; this cot is stiff, I've got a lot to give
You mistake my intellegence for pure cockyness
The hate creates wakes until this ship is going to rock me sick

[Verse 2:Kevin Held]
Rhymin structure flowin, through my vicious veins
Apply puncture gain pain that attains the membrame
Insane, on the mic driven distance from a dyke
Interpret k im ruthless, like the third reich
Eyeing up a target through my sniper scope
Nope to hope don’t care if you’re the damn pope
Blasphemy!Blast with me!
MC average class you C!Rediculious reactions to fast too see!
Flippin scripts coin flip statistics are fifty fifty
Your girl always gives head and tail, nifty nifty
Landing ahead of my own luck yall suck still stuck on fuck
Keep tailin, you better, buy me, dinner you schmuck
Staying irrelevant, intelligent, full of strong element
What i meant kevin hell is straight heaven sent
Me and tyler you will admire, no suprise if we get higher
Were your supplier, connecting MC's better inquire
