[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Ay man out the kitchen, I just prayed for a chicken
They just gave my man a sentence, we just looking for the witness
Oh you mad a nigga winning? This is only the beginning
Cheffin' up, it'll take a minute, cheffin' up, it'll take a minute
Took your bitch to Benihana's, she had trouble with the menu
Fuck a line, we don't wait, you had trouble at the venue
She keep telling me I'm simple, 50K up in the rental
Let me slide up in your dental, that's just what this money get you

[Bridge: Chevy Woods]
I load, re-load, then I load that shit again
Why the fuck you 'round me when you know you ain't my friend
Bitches gang, gang and you know that's to the end
And if it's 'bout that money then you I'm going in

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Get a check and fuck it off
I've been balling like a boss
Maybach, second row
I can teach you how to floss
Fuck the bricks in the Chevy, trap with my dog Chevy
Got too many chains and they heavy
Poured a pot, whip it steady
You cannot fuck with the gang, don't come around you a lame
You bitches fucking for fame, I'm gold, 10 chains
I [?] with my dogs, working with the top off
Fuck a bitch, she get lost
I'm buying all for the cost
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
They ain't wanna see me make it, stole the top, had to take it
I'ma win, gotta face it
You niggas fake, get your cake
Rollie icy, come and skate
I could take you on a date, pussy wet you're like a lake
