[Verse 1]
These niggas tryna count me out but I'm too real shit
Ten shots couldn't drop me, it just fucked up my whip but my shit paid for
I spent that plea to get it fixed 'cause I'ma make more
Yeah I'ma make more
Look nigga speak when you spoken to thats mafia business
Looked till we find you 'cause you know it never women and kids, somebody pray for him
I'll make them shooters never leave, yeah they gon' wait for him
Boy thats just how we play
I'm just cruising the city reminiscing some shit
Them bitches mad 'cause every time they call I'm busy or shit
I'm in the studio baby, you just gotta pull up
Can't try to make you understand 'cause it's never enough
Me and my nigga real friends used to talk 'bout this
You niggas[?] on the net but never pop out bitch
Been through it all, seen it all, as them niggas they know me
I grew up around some niggas thats not my homie

[Verse 2]
I gave you niggas every chance to put your all in this shit
Too much [?] Rousteing, shopping sprees like you lit
You living ass backwards and I know it, nigga you show it (I know it)
I'm like every pack I give you, how you manage to blow it?
It was cracking nigga, it 'cause your moms , you cold ass fuck, wild head cracking nigga, just know that, ooh
You pillow talking to these bitches boy you easy to get
I was popping, fuck you, if you ain't believe in this shit
Look this a long way, from up all night, trapping the coker
Throw a extra seven on top, hoping it blow up
We hearing gun shots every night, know that ain't cool
Shawty wanna hit the block, play the corner, never in school
I taught him tough love, be hard-headed, so just hit it with some tough love, like Cam' says shit should be alright (be alright)
