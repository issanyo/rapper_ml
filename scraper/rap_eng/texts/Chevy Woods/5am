5 in the morning
Its 5 in the morning (x3)
Hit the game to the crib so we know what that's about
And if ya ain't fucking girl ya better get the fuck out
Its 5 in the morning (x2)

[Verse 1]
5 in the morning (x2)
On the munchies, crying with the money
Getting juice[?]
Amigo bout to see what bout it
When you come to the condo, girl don't you doubt it
Keep your shoes off, have a couple drinks
Know how I play, don't care what you think
I've been on my grind all motherfucking year
A nigga like me, I deserve this year
All them things that I told them in the club
Girl you better do it when we get tu the crib
Legs up in the air like Jordan
And your girl with the head
Damn like damn, give it to me baby girl wam
Throw it back on a nigga like me
Taylor Gang in this bitch I know them pussy niggas see

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't shit changed, you know I rep the game lil nigga
Everything the same lil nigga
Instead of worrying about mine, need to get you some change lil nigga
I been out turning up like a mothafucking fool
You know how a playa do
I don't play by the rules
I could show ya something, teach ya something lemme school you to this motherfucking game here
Ain't no motherfucking game here
Ain't no motherfucking snitching
Nah we don't sell names here
No, they waiting for it, yeah I know they ready
Girl that thang got a mothafucking kick back
When ya shooting gotta hold it steady
