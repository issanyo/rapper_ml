[Verse 1]
Uh, I’m just trying to get rich
I stay down nigga, I ain’t switch
Yea, but once that money start pilin'
At once we stuck on Gilligan’s island
My nigga doing 10, I’m just waiting for the call
All the problems that he got, money ain’t one at all
Hood ass nigga got a way with them words
Crack it for my nigga, pour it out on the curb
Out here giving it my all so the world gon' know
And if you down for it then the money gon' show
Been running from them lights like a real nigga do
Look at what we made and what we did for the view
You thinkin it’s a game, click blaw, hold that
I got 20 niggas that ain’t tryna go back, Taylor
Yea, but don’t trip, that’s different
The same 20 niggas all with it, real niggas yea

[Hook]
Sure a nigga know where we go from here
I’ve been doing shows, out on tour all year
And if you work hard everybody know it
Hate it or love it, everybody gon show it
Here’s yo chance, don’t blow it
Versace frames on, tell them haters I’m focused
They want me to fall off and I know it
Man I’m on fire, I’m smokin', real nigga wuddup?

[Verse 2]
Never lost 100 on the way
And you’ve been running round, making plans all day
Can’t get a refund nigga
You know how that shit go where we from nigga
Yea, one flip, bounce back
In the kitchen with a hat then I’m tryna ounce that
No love for them rats or them snakes in the grass
If we ain’t do business right now do the math
Yea, all this, that’s for nothing
We’ll be there for it, that’s something
Yea, it’s a lot more coming
Like counting up a million and that’s in all hundreds, shit
You know me, I ain’t even stuntin'
I could get anything if I wanted
You know, black car, chauffeur
It’s just a head nod, no words

[Hook]
