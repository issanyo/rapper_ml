One night for the money
One night for the money
He ain't even gotta know, you ain't even gotta tell him
One night for the money
One night for the money
One night for the money
He ain't even gotta know, you ain't even gotta tell him
One night for the money
We did it
Yeah girl we did it
He ain't even gotta know, you ain't even gotta tell him
One night for the money
We did it
Yeah girl we did it
He ain't even gotta know, you ain't even gotta tell him
One night for the money

[Verse 1]
Yeah a nigga made it all
Lost it all, got it all back
One night with your main bitch
You ain't even gotta worry 'bout the call back
And that's real, my nigga
Way too mothafuckin' real, my nigga
But don't take it to the heart
Over some pussy and get killed, my nigga
I was way out in Denver
I bet she remembers
We got it on one time, she said, "When you comin' back?"
I said I'm gone 'til November
That's cold, get a coat for it
Never trip on what I did last
3 million on a nigga's brain
Tell me what you know about a nigga chasin' small cash
Bitch, ballin' like [?]
Strip clubs in Atlanta
Throwin' money on a bitch's ass
We did it
Yeah all of my niggas, we did it
And we don't ask you for them ass shots, girl
'Cause you're way too gifted

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Got her throwin' up gang signs
You ain't know your bitch gangbang
She ain't nothin' but a side dish
She ain't nobody's main thing
We on our way to the room now
Bedspread full of hundreds
She ain't even gotta pour it
Shots of 1800
It's about to go down
That's exactly what her face did
He ain't even gotta know
You ain't even gotta tell him when he call where your face is
One night for the go down
You can buy him somethin' nice with it
Tell him how you worked hard for it
He ain't even know you're nice with it
Pulled up two blocks down
We both know this the last time
When we see each other on the streets
We don't even look once when we pass by
We did it
Yeah girl we did it
One night for the money
And you were so with it

[Hook]
