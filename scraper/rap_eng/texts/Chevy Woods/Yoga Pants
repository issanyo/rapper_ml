You just left your workout huh
Your last man he ain't work out huh
Fuck once and I merked out huh
Bring your friends to the twerkoff huh?
Wrist work stir fry like a migo
Yea yup baby that's lingo tho
Told the clock on the bike like chino
Bitches want that bone like dino

No love making, just be shaking
I'm hoping she can take it

Got her off a shit starter
Look at my wrist water
Put my new bitch on her
I can never kiss on her

You badder than a motherfucker

You whistle like you seen a bad ass chick
