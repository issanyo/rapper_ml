Chevy Woods - Losing it all

(You're asleep)

[Intro]
Im sick of all the opinions, telling me what i should do
Apply this shit to yourself, maybe you could win too

[Verse]
I be up all night, rolling joints getting right
Sometimes on tour, sometimes on a flight
Man who would've ever thought, it'll happen overnight
In the middle of the club, im just tryna get right
Champagne on ice, live life everynight
Walk off with the floor model like fuck that price
Need my drink on ice, pinky ring on ice
Getting money with my day ones, ain't gotta say that twice
Pulled up scoring, kobe jordan
Vip, somebody important
Thats me not you though, can't kick it like judo
Thats taylor gang bitch gotta tat it in blood
Better act like you know

[Hook]
Tell em failures not an option, ima work my way around it
I dont ever think about it (x2)

[Verse]
Nigga friend or foe? where you tryna go?
Prices for the high, bought it for the low
Gotta make a profit, thousand dollar outfit
Babymama drama, take her to where i live
All this money pilin, are you mad im stylin?
For nick cannon, just incase you wildin'
Told my momma pray for me, just incase they wait for me
You ain't bout no money boy, stay the fuck away from me
You know how that paper be, friends come from everywhere
Friends over in switzerland, boy i be everywhere
Throwin up the gang, shit ain't ever change
You ain't getting paper, cause u stayed the same

[Hook]
Tell em failures not an option, ima work my way around it
I dont ever think about it (x2)
