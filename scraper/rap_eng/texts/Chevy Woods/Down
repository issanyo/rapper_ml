Have you ever had a dream that you had it all?
But then woke up and it all was gone
The headaches of the world guess i’m telling all
I did it on my own, i ain’t either down from y’all

From a nigga bad, we was penny pinching
That mail box money, look at all these bills we getting
I just want the baddest, call her mj
We about that money, you know we gotta get paid
I dreamed about this life now i got it my hand though
Shooting for the top, homie i’m playing rambo
Thinking about it and doing it it’s 2 different things
I think myself, i never think about who to be
Look homie, i’m a grown man, i run my own shit
Jack … zone, i’m on my boat shit, girl

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me do you know what success is?
Or how it feels?
Or being overseas, fans getting restless
But we just trying to chill
With a life in the spotlight
You don’t wanna watch it from the crowd
You just gotta keep it cool
In the spotlight
Even when it all goes down, when it all goes down

Somebody save these niggers, they ship’s sinking
Don’t know who they thought it was, this’ me speaking
I spend my nights rolling up, sipping and i’m twitting
She say she want it all, so we planning for the weekend
Until the week end
You know she working out
And she say her favorite song is word of mouth
You know red cups, that’s my thing
She robbing … i’m eddie murphy, we boomerang
She like… i’m like girl we ain’t the same
They flying off that bullshit, they playing jane
So you say you ready for the spotlight
Ain’t got to count it up, i know my … right
You know that’s hundred after hundred after hundred
Franklins i’ve done it

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me do you know what success is?
Or how it feels?
Or being overseas, fans getting restless
But we just trying to chill
With a life in the spotlight
You don’t wanna watch it from the crowd
You just gotta keep it cool
In the spotlight
Even when it all goes down, when it all goes down
