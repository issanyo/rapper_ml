[Intro: Bullet Brak]
Man this weed has me high as hell

[Verse 1: Bullet Brak]
This that super piff, I call it holograms
It'll make ya vision shift, twenty-five dollar grams
I'm talking backwoods, and rolling papers
A whole gang of dutchess, I'm talkin different flavors

I smoke exactly what i'm counting dogs, heavy green
Do this for my mothafuckin family, I love my team
I'm going ham, Bullet Brak, pack of wolves, black on black
We need it jack, that's a fact, every dollar, all of that

I'm plottin on this plan to make a couple hundred grand
I'ma hustla, turn it to a mill, while I catch a tan
It's my turn, where's my burn like Big Pun said
You gone learn, You gone learn i put my gold fronts in

Now i'm ballin, now i'm ballin
Act a ass, act a fool now we wildin
DMV, NYC
Shots out worldwide they fuck with me, Bulletttttt

[Chorus 1: Bullet Brak]
We smokin by the pound pound pound, that's that super piff
We Louie Louie Louie Louie down, I'm that Gucci gift
I'm smokin Danny Bonaduce, Danny Bonaduce
Weed got me goin crazy, call it Danny Bonaduce

Roll it light it, roll it light, roll it light, roll it light it, roll it light it
Roll it light it, roll it light, roll it light, roll it light it, roll it light it
Roll it light it, roll it light, roll it light, roll it light it
Smokin Danny Bonaduce

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
A quarter-pound a week I got to have it truly
I just smoked ten joints playin call of duty
Five bong rips talkin biz wit Ludie
Smokin till it's short, that's that Bonaduce

Pass out while we smokin bitch you pussy, coochie
She wanna blow the band while we playin Hootie
You don't like what i'm sayin fuck you baby sue me
Shot out to uncle Snoop, we blowin on that ooh wee

A hundred dollar sacs, you can smoke it all
Shit call me when you n***** get a pound involved
I'm smokin on that fire fuck a fire alarm
Only paper baby, you know what my gang be on

I roll one, you roll one, I light one, you light one
I pull one, you pull one, let's both get high
I'm on one, you on one, we both on the same thing
Let's light up and touch the sky.. haha

[Chorus 2: Bullet Brak]
We smokin by the pound pound pound, that's that super piff
We Louie Louie Louie Louie down, I'm that Gucci gift
I'm smokin Danny Bonaduce, Danny Bonaduce
Weed got me goin crazy, call it Danny Bonaduce

Roll it light it, roll it light, roll it light, roll it light it, roll it light it
Roll it light it, roll it light, roll it light, roll it light it, roll it light it
Roll it light it, roll it light, roll it light, roll it light it
Smokin Danny Bonaduce
