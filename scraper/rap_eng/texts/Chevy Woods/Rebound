[Intro]
Haha yeah
Fuck you thought bitch
Charles Barkley bitch, Dennis Rodman bitch
On a bitch

[Chorus]
Rebound rebound rebound
Rebound rebound rebound
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
Rebound rebound rebound
Rebound rebound rebound
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
We was going through it, and now we barely speakin'
More fish in the sea for me and you know they be tweakin'
Rebound rebound rebound
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
Rebound rebound rebound
Rebound rebound rebound

[Verse 1]
Brand new car got a brand new broad I'm on my brand new shit
Had to skip town got a brand new spot I know they gon' fuck with this
Rebound rebound rebound
Your bitch she my rebound
She ain't smoke when we met, ooh yea now I got her on that weed now
Catching bitches off the backboard
What you putting on that act for
Baby daddy drama I don't give a fuck
What you think I got the strap for
Rebound rebound rebound
Drink this Hennessy now
She told me it was over tryna move to Tennessee now
Bustin' bitches on the tour bus
Girl your head good but you don't know enough
Go ahead yea run and tell that Martin Lawrence that it's going up
Rebound rebound rebound
She just trynna show me
Rebound rebound rebound
I need me a trophy

[Chorus]
Rebound rebound rebound
Rebound rebound rebound
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
Rebound rebound rebound
Rebound rebound rebound
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
We was going through it, and now we barely speakin'
More fish in the sea for me and you know they be tweakin'
Rebound rebound rebound
I just caught a bitch off the backboard
Rebound rebound rebound
Rebound rebound rebound
