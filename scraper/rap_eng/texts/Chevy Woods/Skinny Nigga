[Verse 1]
Skinny nigga half a man on the wrist, ooh
Don't trip you don't wanna see them pistols
I got a beam on the 40 cal red dot
I know shooters that'll get you one head shot
I don't care about shit you other niggas got
Bitch always wanna [?]
Where I'm from young niggas go stupid
Man a few of my niggas went crazy
All these [?] gon' check on me on set got me rubbing my hands like Baby
Don't try nothing nigga they gon' fly something nigga
Man my main lady boy, she a rider
I be out this bitch taking care of my biz get home let me dig in like Skylar
Niggas always talking bout how they got shot
You caught heat through the legs thats minor

[Chorus]
All of this money all of this money
All of this money all of this money
Oh that's why you mad? All of this money
Skinny ass nigga with a whole lot of money
Skinny nigga with a whole lot of money

[Verse 2]
Niggas always wanna talk about they gore ready
50 shots in the chopper gotta hold that steady
All my niggas from the hood here no calling
Click clack boom bet you niggas get to falling
I done sold a lot of dope I ain't gotta rap about
9 hours in the box what the fuck you rap about
Cocaine all on my table, money stuffed in the money counter
Imma get this straight my nigga 60 minutes Imma have that play in an hour
Taylor Gang yea we all 'bout that
30 niggas deep and you know we all 'bout that
And it's right on sight all about my life since you sucka niggas say you all 'bout that
I done made a lot of money on the road hold on
Can't fuck with you niggas y'all just wanna prolong
Hotel 67th floor Dubai
If I can't get money wish ya nigga goodbye
I ain't never talk on my phone I'm not stupid
Nike's on my feet motherfucker just do it
Life got a bunch of ups and downs hope you ready for that war 'cause you bout to go through it
Yea, life got a bunch of ups and downs hope you ready for that war 'cause you bout to go through it

[Chorus]
All of this money all of this money

Skinny nigga with a whole lot of money, ooh!
