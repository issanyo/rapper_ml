Walk up in the club, I see bitches everywhere

I got niggas wanna hate, I got money on my line
Really don't got no problems, cause I don't got the time
And I'm talkin' it cause I'm livin' it
Girl your ass fat, who you in here with?
Really got dough, so I'm spendin' it
Niggas going broke, that's what the difference is

I don't got no love for her, so I don't put my trust in her
Police ass nigga need a badge, why you cuffin' her?
