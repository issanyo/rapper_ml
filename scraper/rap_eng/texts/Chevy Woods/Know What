You gotta really be doin’ this nigga shit, tho

[Verse 1 : Chevy Woods]
This sound like me, I done pass France
One white T one pair of pants
Fuck with me if you understand
Hustler, my nigga, I’mma shot when I land
I pop the bottle with the captain of the speed boat
Ain’t gotta say you neva did it boy cause we know
No skys but I was nice with the sky slop
They don’t know we took a shot, niggas wanna be Nino
Okey, I’m reloadin’ bitch, you tripin' over that pussy, don’t even know the bitch
Real shit, that’s just how I call it
A lot of plastic cards all in my Gucci wallet
You ain’t even know the team my nigga, but you ballin’
Friday you probly yellin’ out Deebo stole it
You only talkin’ like that cause you around ’em niggas
I guess they encoragin’ you off that liquor


[Hook : Chevy Woods]
I don’t know where they find you at, but you ain’t my nigga
If you told them people that then it was a lie nigga
I don’t know where the fuck they got you from
I don’t know where the fuck they got you from
You ain’t my, you ain’t my, you ain’t my nigga
You ain’t my, you ain’t my, you ain’t my nigga
I don’t know where the fuck they got you from
You ain’t my, you ain’t my, you ain’t my nigga


[Verse 2 :Fatman Scoop]
He said he know me but he never get no money with me
When I was broke, I swear to life they wasn’t fuckin’ with me
I’mma tailor you trippin, you know I’m reppin’ right
Can you keep it with you and shoot in that weapon right
This champagne got your bitch in a trance
And she don’t know me but this is her jam
Let’s make it happen we brought some for real
And I’m just down to buy it I don’t care what it’s costing for real
Huh, I swear that Capi says ? that you got it
Huh, you makin’ back it’s double, I promise
Huh, that’s my nigga but you ain’t my nigga
What you on that got you hot my nigga

[Hook : Chevy Woods]
