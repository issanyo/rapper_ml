I don’t really gotta say it but uh
Real shit
You know, some of the shit I’d say, you niggas wouldn’t believe it
I mean, if I showed you in your face, you wouldn’t believe it
Me and my niggas been gettin’ to this money
This really ain’t nothin’ new

Get into this money, still perfecting the flow
You see me, I’m a G, you got a couple letters to go
Went from cookin’ and rockin’ it up, to dope with the stamps on the pack
Was gettin’ so much of it, thought it couldn’t get better than that
Threw on my boots and coat, had that work in the cold
And never did I do business with any niggas who told
My niggas live by the code, we ain’t seen it or heard it
When you talkin’ ‘bout money you gotta know how to word it
Been on the road for a while, them sacrifices, I made ‘em
Oh, you don’t see what I’m doin’, I guess your vision is jaded
Gotta get it and save it, stack it up and invest it
Well I come from the jungle and all my niggas, they restless
Wouldn’t change it for shit at all, like who need a court to ball?
That Ray told me time is money, I put this verse on my dog
And put it out on my gang, cuz yea, they my niggas fo’ sure
Fuck them niggas hatin’ cuz we don’t do this shit fo’ show

(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
Yea nigga, fuck these niggas know about your dad bein’ gone, nigga?
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
Fuck you niggas know about that?
Fuck you niggas know about?
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
The same shit you sellin’ is the same shit your uncle overdosed on, nigga
It’s real shit, 4800, I’m from the jungle for real my nigga
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)

I swear this shit ain’t made up, at night weighing that weight up
Moms ain’t know I was bakin’, I was tryna get my cake up
Yea, them old niggas, they had cars that I wanted
And I ain’t need advice, I just need to get up on it
I befriended a couple niggas just off of the cool
But had to separate cuz they ain’t move, I move
I’m feet first to the pavement and my niggas know that
And I can’t lie, I had dreams of the go back
But what example would I be settin’ for all who follow?
When that pain set, I’m in need of that bottle
Damn, a lot of shit hurt me just the same
I’m just speakin’ for my niggas cuz they feel the same
Yea, that money callin’ and I’m pickin’ up
I gotta do this, business bruh so I don’t give a fuck
If you mad at me, what the fuck you think?
I just got it full by mines, I just got to be

(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
That’s real shit man
Fuck you niggas know about?
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
Dirty ass bitch playin’ both sides
You know what I’m sayin’?
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
Aye, your cousin got caught up in some bullshit
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
And he the only family you know
The fuck you know about that?
