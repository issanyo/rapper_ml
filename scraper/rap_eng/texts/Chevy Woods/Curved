[Chorus]
Girl you know you bad
But you getting on my nerves
Ain't got the time for your bitching I be pitching so you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
I be pitching so you know you getting curved

[Verse 1]
Bad bitch from Seattle, yea
She gon' suck me if I let her, yea
Swear to god that I just met her, yea
[?] she buy me two sweaters, yea
We just got done talking on the FaceTime
I just told her Imma need that face time
If she down to do it Imma make time
I get it jumping just like Jordan on the baseline
And I'm loaded like a pistol never rolling
Hating niggas they just wanna know 'bout what you holding yea
Used to get it out a stolen
This a AP all flooded not a Rollie yea

[Chorus]
Girl you know you bad
But you getting on my nerves
Ain't got the time for your bitching I be pitching so you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
I be pitching so you know you getting curved

[Verse 2]
Straight up out the bottom, yea
Momma said I got a problem, yea
Imma tell you one thing if I'm coming to your crib then I'm bringing this revolver, yea
And don't you get to acting like you ain't on shit
I heard about you they say you don't like to spit
Just to let you know that that's my type of shit
They hating on the net and I ain't typing shit
If you ain't down for sucking or no fucking tell me baby what the fuck you call my phone for, yea
That's the only thing that I told her after that I know the bitch heard the dial tone

[Chorus]
Girl you know you bad
But you getting on my nerves
Ain't got the time for your bitching I be pitching so you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
Yea, yea you know you getting curved
I be pitching so you know you getting curved

[Outro]
