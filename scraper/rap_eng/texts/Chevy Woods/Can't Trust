[Intro]
Aye aye my nigga you remember when we hit that one lick
And you were complaining bout how I got more money than you off the shit or remember that one time I fucked that bitch that you wanted to fuck and you got mad at me cause I fucked the bitch

[Chorus]
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch

[Verse 1]
Aye you niggas switching sides I can't trust you niggas
On my mama that's a code boy had long for niggas
Said you down for me found out that was all lies
I'm from the jungle boy you know that I got [?]
They pulled that 40 out they waist put it in your face
Gotta kill you cause we know that you gonna tell the chase
Sushi dinner with the money that's a private date
Seen him on the stand I can't believe that he touched state

[Chorus]
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch

[Verse 2]
And Ima watch that money pile up
Boy you funny [?]
Ain't have no love when I was broke bitch you can't love me now
Been through some shit my brand new bitch said why you never smile
Cause I got niggas in the prison hole can't get no trial
Bumboy you on the bench I put your bitch in the clinch
They chasing em over the fence eagle across me [?]
I just dropped it in the [?]
I just fucked over your thot
Never put trust in a bitch, no
She can not come to the spot, yea yea yea

[Chorus]
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch

[Outro]
I can't trust you, oh
I can't trust you, no no no
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
I can't trust no nigga, I can't trust no bitch
No bitch, no bitch, no bitch
