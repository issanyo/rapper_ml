[Intro]

[Hook]
I got more than your rent on me
Ayy, I got your bitch on me
Tom Ford, thatâ€™s the scent on me
Bitch I'm fly, you ain't got shit on me

[Verse 1]
You keep rapping bout the trap house but we know you faking
Bitch keep talking like she single but she knows she's taken
If you ain't fucking, keep it moving, I can't do no waiting
If you could snatch her man she's yours, I don't do no hating

[Hook]
Ayy, ayy, I got your bitch on me

[Verse 2]
All these hundreds I be dumbing ooh
Girl don't run away from it ooh
That pussy splashing, it feel like a pool
All these diamonds on me icy cool
Wow, she from the UK, baby girl a model
Ayy, said she a drinker, help me kill the bottle
Woah, we out in Aspen, I got Gucci goggles
[?] top me in the cabin, told her not a problem

[Hook]
Ayy, ayy, I got your bitch on me
