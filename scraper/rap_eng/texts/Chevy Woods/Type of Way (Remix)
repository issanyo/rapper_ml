[Hook: Chevy Woods]
Man, fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Seen murder, trapped and crime twenty three
I done sold a lot of weight, on the corner I was straight
Never fuck with high prices on the yay
Im Taylor Gang, I know you feel some type of way
This flooded AP make you feel some type of way
That bitch you call your bitch, she got a Tyson face
Its a drought and you ain't on, you feel some type of way
Some type of way, I know you feel some type of way
I pull up and pull off, you feel some type of way
Secretary hands, go ahead and type away
Them shots go off and you won't feel no type of way

[Verse: Chevy Woods]
Everyday we gettin' money, need it right away
We run up to the car, serve 'em they ride away
I was hand in hand, that's what I'm tryna say
Put me in a pot, that's what that powder say
I'm talkin' vacations to a hide away
Ten in the o, heating thats a harder way
Ain't nothing for the free, don't give no hard away
Now-a-days, it costs 40 for a brick of yay
That right after they hit it, they can't fix they face
These J's cost 500 any type of way
So fuck what a hatin' nigga gotta say
Pull up in them coupes, like what you gotta say

[Hook: Chevy Woods]
Man, fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Seen murder, trapped and crimed twenty three
I done sold a lot of weight, on the corner I was straight
Never fuck with high prices on the yay
Some type of way, I know you feel some type of way
I pull up and pull off, you feel some type of way
Secretary hands, go ahead and type away
Them shots go off and you won't feel no type of way
