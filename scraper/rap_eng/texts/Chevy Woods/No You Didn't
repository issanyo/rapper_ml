[Intro]
Hazelwood nigga
Haha, pull up
Shout for the 48 hundred block
46 hundred wuddup?

[Verse 1]
This a one on one, I swear nobody got
Kamikaze crazy, you call this a watch? (AP)
Molly poppin, bitches sweat and talk a lot
Bullets flying in directions if you said a lot
5 kilos, that’s a cinder block
Clean up time that’s what they call spin the block
Yea, I got my life up in this rental car
So me and the police, we don’t get along
Look at me with all this winter on
Yea, my money grandma Sunday dinner long
Gang gang nigga, that’s how I bang nigga
So don’t be mad at us if you don't gang with ya

[Hook]
I just pulled up in that - no you didn’t
Yes I did, they like “no, you didn’t”
That nigga snitchin, you like “no, he didn’t”
That Johnny Gale coupe that new addition
They say he used to get it but we know he didn’t
Say he used to flip it but we know he didn’t it
Said he used to pitch it but we know he didn’t
Real street niggas always know the difference

[Verse 2]
A slatch for these niggas, you could dig a hole
Magazine on magazine, they centerfold
Drop off on, felt that paper shit, that’s all I know
I was itchin for that scratch and it was coming through (work it)
Numbers counting numbers for the lowest number
I dropped it in a pot, sometimes it came back nothing
I was staring out that potsick like “no, he didn’t”
He exchange it, you said he played you, man no he didn’t
If it ever came back shorty made it right
That’s bottle after bottle on a Tuesday night
If you say you got it from us we gon know you snitchin
Plus my lawyer still gon tell the jury no he didn’t

[Hook]
