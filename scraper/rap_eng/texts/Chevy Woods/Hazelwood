Yea, this that fix me a plate shit
That ghetto shit, uh
Oh you do hair?, in your house?
Get money, yea

Yea, this that corner shit, you feel me? I was on that bench
Thinkin’ I would make a milli, money comin’ in so silly
Had that product servin’ junkies with my niggas on the Nolia
Shout out to my nigga Mainer before Cheeser had that Rover uh
East side, 32, hundreds on just caddies
Shout out to the ho that played me, glad I ain’t your baby daddy
Whole hood represented, Bobby Rothman before Sally
You know that’s the war zone, yea that’s the alley
You know Freeze, that’s my nigga
And his pops, well that’s J Five
Fiends callin’, moms cussing me out at the same time
That’s curren$y, New Orleans, countin’ money, get high
I do the same thing in the morning, ask them, why would I lie?

So my connect you will never know
A hundred things by myself but now I’m doin’ shows
I put that on my hood, they already know
I’m a Nolia boy so I’m trained to go

It’s a cookout at the playground, pull my car right up to Lewis
Uncle yolkey hoopin' with the youngins barely shootin’
Got a cousin with some babies, I be buyin’ for the kids
My cousin V, he did the same, he scoop me from the crib
Yea, you know that top off, that Camaro baby
I ain’t in the army but it’s shout out to my camos
Playing angle, second Nav, that’s Mike’s skinny candy
Got a cut, then a plate, yea, fresh up out of Janie’s
This my hood, a nigga love it
Never leave it cuz I can’t
It’s the reason that a nigga got these bands up in my pan
Can’t forget my mom cuz she raised a boy up to a man
Rest in my peace to all my homies and my niggas in the can, damn

So my connect you will never know
A hundred things ‘bout myself but now I’m doin’ shows
I put that on my hood, they already know
I'm a Nolia boy so I’m trained to go
