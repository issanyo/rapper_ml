[Intro]
I just landed lil' mama wussup
Bombay and lemonade in my cup
Your baby daddy always talk like he the plug
If we catch him we gon' tie his ass up
I re-

[Chorus]
You could bring your friends if you want to
You could drink as much as you want
We gon' have some fun if you want to
I know you want to, I know you want to, I know you want to
I know you want to, I know you want to

[Verse 1]
I just landed lil' mama wussup
Bombay and lemonade in my cup
Your baby daddy always talk like he the plug
If we catch him we gon' tie his ass up
I remember when you told me he a weirdo
True Religions hell nah we don't wear those
He a sucka he just frontin' we don't fear those
All these birds flocking to me like a scarecrow
I be balling like Melo in the 4th, I'm clutch
Be yourself pussy nigga why you tryna be us
Some bitch keep calling what the fuck do you want
Brown bag of money look like a fucking school lunch

[Chorus]
You could bring your friends if you want to
You could drink as much as you want
We gon' have some fun if you want to
I know you want to, I know you want to, I know you want to
I know you want to, I know you want to

[Verse 2]
Look I ain't trippin' what is it I'm tryna give you the business
And give you all my attention when I be sliding up in it
[?] told me to kill it I Mortal Kombat the finish
Said that you wanted that work I'm tryna give you the business
You at home having problems with your man yea
You could tell me girl you know I understand yea
All the drinks all alone thats the plan yea
I just do the money dance Johnny Manziel

[Bridge]
Like ooooh, I'm so into you
What you tryna do?
Like ooooh, you could bring your friends
Imma bring my crew

[Chorus]
You could bring your friends if you want to
You could drink as much as you want
We gon' have some fun if you want to
I know you want to, I know you want to, I know you want to
I know you want to, I know you want to
