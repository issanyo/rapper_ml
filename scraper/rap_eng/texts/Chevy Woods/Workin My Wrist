[Intro]
I just finished cheffin' up a baseball
Had it jumping motherfuck a day job
Balling like LeBron in the playoffs
Gotta keep it pushing till it pay off

[Chorus]
You ain't never heard shit like this
All these dealings got the task force pissed
One time my momma caught me by the stove
She said boy what you doing in the kitchen
Had to tell her I was workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist

[Verse 1]
I just finished cheffin' up a baseball
Had it jumping motherfuck a day job
Balling like LeBron in the playoffs
Gotta keep it pushing till it pay off
Niggas had a party at the condo
She topped me in the morning like Alonzo
Gotta keep a duckie in the car
Tryna search it but there's nothing in the car
I was tryna break my wrist in the kitchen
Randy Johnson so you know this how I'm pitching
Tried to tell 'em fuck with me but they ain't listen
I could show you how to double up a chicken

[Chorus]
You ain't never heard shit like this
All these dealings got the task force pissed
One time my momma caught me by the stove
She said boy what you doing in the kitchen
Had to tell her I was workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist

[Verse 2]
Got a table full of money I just feed my face
Yea the feds had my man but he beat that case
Anna Mae, Anna Mae she gon' eat that cake
I'm just out for the chips like Frito Lay
Heard your phone tapped nigga don't call my phone
Used to run to them cars like all day long
Tried to get you right need the low price on the yay
Gotta go and see the plug man and he can't wait
Bet you boys wanna know just what's in my safe
Imma keep on hustling to get that Wraith
Y'all met and it was cracking can I make my play
You ain't gotta let a nigga Imma make my way

[Chorus]
You ain't never heard shit like this
All these dealings got the task force pissed
One time my momma caught me by the stove
She said boy what you doing in the kitchen
Had to tell her I was workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
Workin' my workin' my workin' my wrist
