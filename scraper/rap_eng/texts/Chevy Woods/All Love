[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Don't never let nobody else projections of they self determine you what you are
If you can do it once, then you can do it twice, It's all about what you've learn
Ain't nobody saying it'll be easy at the top
People waiting for you to fall
Been around the world and even though I'm young, I feel like I've seen it all, been through it all

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
When it goes down, we gon' come up
People throwing hate around
I'm saying now nigga, you believe in me, you believe in all of us
You don't got to trust us, but you gon' respect us

[Hook]
And is all love, (all love), love, oooh ooh
Is all love, (all love), love, yeah yeeaah
Is all love, (all love), love, oooh ooh
Is all love, (all love), love, yeah yeeaah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Don't matter how hard it might get, don't let go
Don't move too fast, anything worthy gonna come slow
You can have anything that you want
You can try anything that you want
You can do anything, that they said you can't do, oooooo

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
When it goes down, we gon' come up
People throwing hate around
I'm saying now nigga, you believe in me, you believe in all of us
We came for it all, you ain't gotta give us nothing
Please believe us

[Hook]
And is all love, (all love), love, oooh ooh
Is all love, (all love), love, yeah yeeaah
Is all love, (all love), love, oooh ooh
Is all love, (all love), love, yeah yeeaah

[Vesrse 3: Chevy Woods]
It hurt me to write this than it did for to say this, ugh!
Found out they love you when you tell them yes
Hate you when you tell them no
Saying but don't really mean it
I go off  her actions though, I know we had our differences
You still invited to the show and we know things about each other, nobody should ever know
You know I miss my lil one, It's hard for me to sleep at night
Shit, I looked out for everybody, now I'm wrong for living life ( for living love eeh)
Been going through it, tell me where the druuugggs at, go get influence
Look I just need my niggas 'round, my momma handle business for me
Had to sacrifice some things but I swear thats a different story
Is so much for me to do, nobody gonna do it for me
Right in front my momma's house they try to take me out glory, but

[Hook]
And is all love, (all love), love, oooh ooh
Is all love, (all love), love, yeah yeeaah
Is all love, (all love), love, oooh ooh
Is all love, (all love), love, yeah yeeaah
