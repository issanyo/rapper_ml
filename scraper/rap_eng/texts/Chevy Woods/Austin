[Hook x4]
She off the liquor
Said I'm that nigga
Girl it's just us behind these doors
It ain't no winners

[Verse 1]
She off the liquor, I'm off that dope
She said she like that brown she want Henney and coke
I need a sprite, I need some ice now I'm in mood
Damn girl you hella bad, in them red bottoms
I see them niggas hating, my shooters red dot em
Them niggas tripping off, they have too many pills
My niggas counting money bags and so many bills
I just pulled up on the [?]
I got it for a model
And she hella bad and you don't know about her
She get them [?] fast, ain't nothing slow about her

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
Give me a brain
Girl what you thinking
Just let me party, show out to linking
Would you be down for me if I was singing
I'm talking TLC, Deandre creeping
I know these niggas mad all my niggas ball
I'm dunking hella bad, smoke weed walk out the mall
You know my niggas Taylor
You know my niggas player
You know we rolling joints and KK be that only flavor
You know I rep the jungle
That's 48 hunnid
And yo bitch can get it if yo bitch want it
I ain't tripping off I don't need your ho
I pour 4 into a 20 ounce I'm speaking slow

[Hook x4]
