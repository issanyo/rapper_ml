[Chorus]
Take a picture, I got all this money
Kodak flash
Blue hundreds, I got blue hundreds
In my [?] bag
Like what the fuck you talkin' bout
If it ain't about money
When it's hot I pull the drop out
I hurt your feelings when it's sunny
(Hold up, hold up wait a minute motherfucker)

[Verse 1]
You the type that need a bitch to stroke your ego
No we not together, we just fucking and she know
No car notes, I don't care 'bout the repo
I was in my momma's kitchen [?] skeet slow
36 ounces, I'm so used to a kilo
Knock, knock, knock, junkies all at the peephole (Hello)
You ain't never do it boy you acting, yeah we know
My shooters never smile but they all getting cheese though

[Chorus]
Take a picture, I got all this money
Kodak flash
Blue hundreds, I got blue hundreds
In my [?] bag
Like what the fuck you talkin' bout
If it ain't about money
When it's hot I pull the drop out
I hurt your feelings when it's sunny
(Hold up, hold up wait a minute motherfucker)

[Verse 2]
This ain't a wrist watch, your bitch watch
Ooh throw it up, that's a sick watch
I can't fuck with you cause your clique huh
Girl what your last nigga was, I am not
I get money, I'm so sure
If it ain't money, I skrrt skrrt
She a baddie, yeah that's her
I got double G's, Gucci loafers

[Chorus]
Take a picture, I got all this money
Kodak flash
Blue hundreds, I got blue hundreds
In my [?] bag
Like what the fuck you talkin' bout
If it ain't about money
When it's hot I pull the drop out
I hurt your feelings when it's sunny
(Hold up, hold up wait a minute motherfucker)
