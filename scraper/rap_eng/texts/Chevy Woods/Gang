[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
I'm rolling up that motivation, they'll never give me no credit
No alerts turned on my phone so I ain’t get your message

Man tell these hoes that I’m big timing, I’m Mannie Fresh, how you love that?
That bank card like uh, rich nigga no limit
Top off when it pop off with her head down how I’m living
Bitch stay out your feelings
Keep it G and get richer
She came over, that’s game over
She here talking with Richard
