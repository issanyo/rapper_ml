Oh, they said they don’t fight like this no more

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, gloves on, then I beat it up

You gon get it later off on how you actin’ now
I’mma put my gloves on and play Pacquiao
That king-size bed, that’s the boxing ring
Oh, we gon fight, I’m just waitin’ for the bell to ding
I’m the champ baby girl, you ain’t gotta ask
And the bedroom’s sponsored by Everlast
I promoted this myself, call me Don King
I had you floatin’ like the butterfly, Ali
Call esthetics, speed bed
Straight down the middle girl, I got a mean jab
Mayweather fast or Butterbing slow
Uppercuts, right hooks and watch our knees go
Oh, the ref don’t wanna stop the fight
I’mma play Michael Tyce, let me knock you out tonight
Difference is , I’m getting weeded up
Taking my gloves off after I beat it up

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, gloves on, then I beat it up

He was talkin’ all that shit when we was weighing in
I got the contract, I just need a pen
And the physical to show me what your body like
In the interview I said you goin’ down tonight
They said what round, I said I don’t know
I’m just down to let the girl give me low blows
Cause ima have her cornered, throwing in the towel
Trained a little harder, I went the extra mile
24/7, like it’s HBO
I throw my robe on and now I’m good to go
Fireworks going off, walk into the ring
It’s the main event, our faces on the screen
That’s Rocky, Apollo, need that water bottle
Between rounds it’s models, docks S-in if you follow
You want a re-match, you gon need a lawyer
Cuz I’m the golden boy bitch, Dela Hoya

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, gloves on, then I beat it up
