[Hook: Devin Cruie]
I’m on the race to the money
Don’t call no police on me
You know I’m out here, out here, out here
You know I’m out here, out here, out here
They talkin, don’t know my name
All I know is my game
You know I’m out here, out here, out here
You know I’m out here, out here, out here
Throwin' up money
Oh yea, they tryin' to slow me down
I got 100$ bills, no one slows me down

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
It’s big meetings and that Taylor the office
Fly nigga fresh to death so what you want a coffin
My mind on that money, never spend without a profit
And any anything I ever touch, bitch I’mma make a profit
I was hand in hand with it, 50’s in the bag
I swear my shit was so good, the fiends wanted tabs
I had my weight up so for some niggas I couldn’t waitt up
Look I was on it, I chopped it up and I kick it later
Like the police, them pussies want everything we got
I’m talkin' shootin' fiends, bricks that try to make em cop
This home sweet home but ain’t shit sweet about it
My homie hit some niggas up and said you’ll read about it
Real life shit, but you ain’t livin this
We drop the 40 in the store on some nameless shit
He had detectives in this grill on some dinner shit
But he ain’t turtle or a shell, you want to explain the shit bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
My passport’s stamped up, tell me what you travel like
Been on the pavement everywhere, what your gravel like
In the night time, led pipe they let off
All you hear is them tigers screamin', they fire rounds and they spit off
Ain’t no shots returned, ain’t nobody call the police
Bitch run away, it’s wartime, I still be on my street
Put that on my cousin and I’mma be here, what you think
Bitch I’m off this gin and I’m like middle finger your drink ha
Yea, it’s big meeting in that Taylor office
Fly nigga fresh to death so what you want a coffin
You niggas gotta be livin the life
You gotta be just getting by
‘Cause bitch you ain’t shipin no pies
And if it’s money then we all for it
Young boys run with metal look like young forest
So bitch you owe me money then we all for it
Have my young boys run with metal look like young forest
