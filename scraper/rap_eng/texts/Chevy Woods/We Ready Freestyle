We made it
I just wanted to fuck this shit up myself
Taylor Gang shit
4800
Chevy!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I don't care what nobody doing this year
Don't question me or what I'm doing this here
My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga
You had a few shots and now you a beast
You need to stay off of that liquor
I'm talking about balcony smoking in France
Sitting on top of the villa
Chopping up game with the homies
About the shit we did, like remember
Look at this watch like it's Gucci adlib that's BUR
Welcome to winter, three hundred just for the dinner
You losing, we over here winning
Making up shit, man what a shame
Nigga I guess you ain't on top of your game
You flexing and taking them pictures
Boy you need to stop ?
Haha ? boy ?
Keeping it one hundred, you ain't even have
Lying about bitches you ain't even smash
Having them stupid ass problems, that's bad ?
I'm right on the beach from right out the street
Cooking up pies, I can serve you a piece
Talking all loud, who you the police
Right where you stand nobody speak

BOW! He made it!
Taylor Gang shit
TGOD
Fuck nigga!
We made it!
