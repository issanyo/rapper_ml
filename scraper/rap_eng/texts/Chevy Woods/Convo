Champagne, this a player tho..
WOOP! Black Cobain. Word

They say the game change
But I just say the players do
I been on this corner hanging out for like
A day or two
A lot of shit been happening
I'm just happy that I made it through
Or that I'm making it, fuck what you make of it
Wooooo! Big bank my convo, big bank my convo

[Chevy Woods]
Big joints of the green bro
Doing shows with my team - whoa!
Old-school in my tapedeck
Fuck you think that I lean for?
Push a button, them screens fold
Diamonds all on my AP
Fuck you know about long flights?
Beirut! That's crazy
Long nights are paying off
Them cold days that I didn't take off
All them times I ain't like the price
But I bought it all!
Damn! Shit I grew up where them killers play
Where they put one in the head, like
"Will I live today?"
I just chillin, the best you can buy
And keep it cool, cause they say if you stretch you could die
Word. What you gonna do when that pressure applied?
Just from an argument and you hear that metal go blaow!

[Black Cobain]
And I ain't slept in days, but a nigga gettin paid
I fuck around til I came
Bad bitches give me brain
All I smoke it that Mary-Mary
I ain't into no churches tho
Told my bitch when I made a mil
She could take her ass off birth control
New stamps on my passport, old church from my last tour
Rolled it up and I smoke one
? let's ?
? weed smoke, interstate I got 3 hoes
Got 2 chains and they both gold
Came a long way from them bo-bos mayne!
Them dark nights had a nigga on heath ledge
?
And now I'm fuckin with them Taylors
Waddup, Chevy rolling papers
We gonna smoke one for the mayor
