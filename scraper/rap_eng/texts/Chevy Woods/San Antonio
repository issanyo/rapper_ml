[Hook:]
Girl I don't want no one to know
And you don't want no one to know
But I just gotta let you know
That you bad and you from San Antonio
You bad and you from San Antonio (x3)

[Verse 1:]
Empty bottles of the Champagne
I don't know what happened
Girl you wouldn't be in this crib if a nigga wasn't rapping, I know that
Show that
Throw that
All of that and she bad girl
Lemme welcome you to my world
We do some things different
Ain't a thing missing
Round she we ain't never kidding
Lemme see that kitten

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
When I'm out in Texas
I don't answer my texts
I'm with my home girl
And she tryna take me home girl
I swear a couple of these shots will do
Tell me what you tryna do
I swear I'm into you
Now grip this mic just like a interview
Takes time, we can make time
When I'm done girl that's escape time
I can't give her the chance
All this money can't fit in my pants

[Hook]
