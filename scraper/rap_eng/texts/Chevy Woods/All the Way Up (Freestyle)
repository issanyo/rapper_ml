[Verse]
I'm fresh from Dubai on a loaded jet
I be on the flights you would never catch
Told her pick the tickets up at will cost
Cause her head game jumping, got that bullfrog
All these diamonds on me, it ain't hard to notice me
Had you in that prescint and you was singing like Jodeci
I ain't tryna hit it if it ain't the right potency
See me with the gang and now she wanna get close to me
I can make time if the head right
And we can talk bread if it's spread right
Fucking up a foreign, got the gears right
And you niggas keep on talking, this your year right?
I was in the trap playing dreamcast
Cheffing up the coke to get a mean bag
They gon' come and get it with a ski mask
What's up with you niggas, they sling fast
I don't sip the red, it's only activist
Franco Harris catching plays, I'm immaculate
What you in it for if you ain't stacking it?
Got the trunk in the front, not the back of it
Okay now we talking real money
All my niggas with it got that field money
Crib from the ground, that's that bill money
That's that I don't give a fuck how you feel money
Taylor Gang, boy that's all I know
Jin and Jackson, I'm in action, got it in control
I'm about to catch a body like Drizzy
Purple Bape hoody on, yeah I'm Weezy
I'm just tryna catch a show and ball, Breezy
If you ain't know, now you know, bitch believe me
If it's about the money, then it's go time
Special cloth alert, hang it up, clothes line
