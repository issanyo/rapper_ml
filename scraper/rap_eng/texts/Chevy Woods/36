Oh they say niggas can’t get money like this no mo’?
We countin’ it
Ha-ha, Taylor

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’
What you mean? (What you mean?) That’s a 36
That’s a 36, that’s a 36

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’
What you mean? (What you mean?) That’s a 36
That’s a 36, that’s a 36

I got you with me in the kitchen and you ask me how it’s lookin’
I’mma tell you good when I’m whippin’ and I’m cookin’
That’s a dirty fix, you see my diamonds I’d ‘em flipped a lot the worth of this
Your pockets injured when I’m out here tryna hurt the strips
4 and a half, 9 piece
18? That’s a old thing
That’s a 36 and I ain’t new to this
Been on the mile, knew how to pitch
That’s rental car, turn pipe wielin’ with it
I’m talkin’ glad bat, corner store pitchin’ with it
That’s a 36, don’t call my phone
Need a 36? That’s a Jerome
Been in the kitchen all day, they up and down my hallway
Them 36’s all day, move so fast like andale
You’re tryna haller at your boy, you gon need some chips
If you’re tryna get the whole thing, 36

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’
What you mean? (What you mean?) That’s a 36
That’s a 36, that’s a 36

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’
What you mean? (What you mean?) That’s a 36
That’s a 36, that’s a 36

36’s out the trunk, nigga what you need?
This gon be 28 or bigger, nigga what you need?
I hustle like the south-east corners, slow trap this be
Protected by 36 gorillas, they the primal fiend
It’s open season, vicar’s kitchen’s open up it’s never lie
Have these workers cookin’ like it’s dinner then these numbers fly
Let these numbers grow, in a drop numbers gon blow
Get this shit, I got it, go sell
Give her titties, smokers want mo’
Nigga got that fire, propane
All white like daddy, cocaine
When the man say snow, no rain
I make bread like dough, no thing
This shit gon fly, no plane
My only trap here, no stains
On full time post, no game
All about cash money like Wayne
If you ain’t heard, I’m a trapper panic with naked flips
Something like Jason Statham in Transporter with taken trips
They see the AB in our Taylor Gang
Bitch it’s gon be murder if one of these snitchin’ niggas go to meet the cops

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’
What you mean? (What you mean?) That’s a 36
That’s a 36, that’s a 36

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’
What you mean? (What you mean?) That’s a 36
That’s a 36, that’s a 36

Thought I was goin’ crazy, just a little skitz
(What you mean?) Start out misplacing 36
18 at my little bad hoe’s crib
The other half at my aunts where my clothes is
Long neck on a spoon, that’s a Murton Hanks
That’s a 36, oh you think I ain’t?
Gettin’ money out here, wippin’ 36
Gettin’ 36, bitchin’ 36
Shaquille O’Neal, that’s a 36
For Boston though, ask the Celtics
David Garrard, Bru Breeze
Times 2, you know what that means
That’s a 36, 4 names
No guns, it’s lunch time
Niggas gotta eat, I gotta see my chips
That’s why I flip a 36

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’
What you mean? (What you mean?) That’s a 36
That’s a 36, that’s a 36

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’
What you mean? (What you mean?) That’s a 36
That’s a 36, that’s a 36
