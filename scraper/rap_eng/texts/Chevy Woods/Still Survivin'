What gives nowadays? No controlin’ it
Self medicatin’ the situation
My city’s burnin’, the smoke is risin’
By any means we’re still surviving

How much you willin’ to make? Nigga show me
I just need one more player, nigga Kobe
Got me livin’ a life full of events
Home run to the cops, yea, over the fence, cool
No scarves, another day, so what?
My niggas don’t do the court, that mean they don’t show up
We getting paper so nuff, they wanna kick a holdup
Shoes on the wrong feet, nigga you got works
Just play your role and gotta act first
Before you think about money, get the pack first
Don’t be shy when the law we spill
One night, crazy morning, like for victims, uh

What gives nowadays? No controlin’ it
Self medicatin’ the situation
My city’s burnin’, the smoke is risin’
By any means we’re still surviving

That’s just how I told a nigga from
Before they know how to read a book, they shoot a gun
Think about it now, that’s damn near 1.5
Grams goin’ for the 50 just to get them by
Mom’s trippin’ of course, but gotta get ‘er to leave
Sour all in the air, got pistol tucked in the sleeve, man
Fuck it, they cool with me
Can’t coach ‘em though but they’d shoot for me
I just roll the trees and never thin about to do it
Like my old ears tryna get a winkin’ out it
They told me get it and get out to avoid the stress
So I’m just runnin’ to the finish ‘til I’m out of breath

What gives nowadays? No controlin’ it
What gives nowadays? No controlin’ it
Self medicatin’ the situation
Self medicatin’ the situation
My city’s burnin’, the smoke is risin’
My city’s burnin’, the smoke is risin’
By any means we’re still surviving
