Hold up first, I roll up
Roll up, roll up
These women in the world they know us
Know us, knows us
Haters keep on hating, they grouse us, grouse us
Taylor Gang is the gang and you know us, know us

[Verse 1: Tuki Carter]
First of all, I’m one of those niggas
Who like to get his money straight
Meet a bitch, treat her to a cool dinner with a lobster and a steak
Take her to the crib show her how you live, you be fuckin on the first date
Blow a lot of weed, give her shots to...make that pussy pop
I'll be knockin in the night
So when I’m pimping on the spot
You know …to keep it pimping
Pimping and your bitches are choosing
Nigga you losing your pimping
Tough from the bottom, I’m riding to the top nigga!

[Hook]
Hold up first, I roll up
Roll up, roll up
These women in the world they know us
Know us, knows us
Haters keep on hating, they grouse us, grouse us
Taylor Gang is the gang and you know us, know us

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas getting mad
It really matter all the money I be gettin
Coming from a place you get your own, stealing swag that's so forbidden
Hop up in my car, 1968 Camaro, boy, I’m shifting
Give a fuck about the shit you see on YouTube you should see the crib I live in
And my niggas get it poppin'
And we’re rolling up, ain’t no stopping
We smoke in front of the cops
They don’t even hit the block and tell us to put it out
Me and Tuk be gettin' drugged out
We’re getting money in this ma don’t even give a fuck what you talk about
You little bitch!

[Hook]
Hold up first, I roll up
Roll up, roll up
These women in the world they know us

Haters keep on hating, they grouse us,grouse us
Taylor Gang is the gang and you know us, know us

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
Getting money since a mother fucking teenager
But what you know about the mobile phone full of things?
Or getting knocked off your brand
New ninja for some niggas in a car
Waiting on you with them red beans
Give a fuck what you’re reppin bitch, I’m a Taylor!
I’m rolling weed, drinking gin, I’m on them Cali flavors
Man these niggas sweet as candy, see them now n later
And niggas waitin in the car I'm about to be a player!
Look! I never hung with you niggas, I never stunt with you niggas, although I'll stunt on you niggas, I’m on my shit fly, is just fun for you niggas
I got a drum for you niggas
And I ain’t talking about a mother fucking band!

[Hook]
Hold up first, I roll up
Roll up, roll up
These women in the world they know us
Know us, knows us
Haters keep on hating, they grouse us, grouse us
Taylor Gang is the gang and you know us, know us
