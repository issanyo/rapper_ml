Caller: I already know this motherfucker did not just send me to voicemail again. Chevy fuck you be acting all stupid for and shit like you wasn't the one liking the comment all my flicks on the 'gram. Just remember nigga that was all you. It was never me. Alright.

Chevy Woods: Hey hey bitch. I ain't tryna hear that shit. You talking the same shit I just heard from another bitch. Aight I know you lying. Bitch I can smell that shit

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I can let you love me but I know she lying
Said that she don't wanna fuck me but I know she lying
Told me "Baby you could trust me" but I know she lying
Said "You the only one who touch me" but I know she lying
Bitch you lying, bitch you lying
Bitch you lying, ayy bitch I know you lying
Bitch you lying, bitch you lying
Bitch you lying, ayy bitch I know you lying

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
I just count the money, I can't waste no time
Now she said she wanna fuck me, told her wait in line
I used to go see the bitch rain, snow, or shine
She had her last nigga's name tattooed on her spine (Crazy shit)
But now that's case closed
I don't want you bitch
Hey you like lollipops
You fuck with suckers bitch
And I ain't no sucker bitch
No I can't trust you bitch
No I can't love you bitch
Get the fuck up out my whip

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I can let you love me but I know she lying
Said that she don't wanna fuck me but I know she lying
Told me "Baby you could trust me" but I know she lying
Said "You the only one who touch me" but I know she lying
Bitch you lying, bitch you lying
Bitch you lying, ayy bitch I know you lying
Bitch you lying, bitch you lying
Bitch you lying, ayy bitch I know you lying

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Say you got the number to my line
(Hold on bitch, quit lying)
Say I'm wrong I do this all the time
(I got another bitch on the way)
Girl I'm grown, I ain't gon' commit a crime
Legend in the game and ain't retiring
Hundreds of girls, they wetting up
Know we the gang, they fuck with us
I'm putting in tons of work
Tatted up under my shirt
Copy my swag but I did it first
Say I look better in person
I'm the nigga that she flirt with
Smoking KK, never dirt yeah

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
I can let you love me but I know she lying
Said that she don't wanna fuck me but I know she lying
Told me "Baby you could trust me" but I know she lying
Said "You the only one who touch me" but I know she lying
Bitch you lying, bitch you lying
Bitch you lying, ayy bitch I know you lying
Bitch you lying, bitch you lying
Bitch you lying, ayy bitch I know you lying

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
I told you bitch don't call my phone for the thousandth time (Hello)
I swear to God that everything was fine (Swear)
Live by the code, you do the crime, gotta do the time
(Ayy do your time)
She from the Hills, her daddy rich and she love cocaine lines (Cocaine)
Ayy that your type of bitch, ayy she be hype as shit
I heard she go both ways, yeah she like to dip
She fucking with the other side, I can't invite her in (The ops)
And last night my youngest hit man that bitch trifling
