[Intro]
I ain’t even gotta drive on this one
(League of Stars)
Ima just kick my shoes off and roll joints in back seat
That’s cool! Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I’m seldom seen, set em hand in hand on the scene
That caddy blank and pull up, get the digit your man
She wanna hang, I tell her baby stay in your lane
The car cake but the icing was the swing of the chain
Not mean not six in Miami, but the Jersey and James
And plus I’m flyer then them niggas who landin' them planes
And we keep everything one hundred that’s all for the gang
And plus the circle tight so nah I don't fuck with you lames
You niggas probably keep a box to the top of the cops
My man a bar tendence any send em some shots
And now I’ll never be trippin on what I should say
Other than your bitch ass shit, I had a good day

[Hook]
I push rounds, I got dope for you niggas
I push rounds, I got dope for you niggas
I push rounds, I got dope for you niggas
I push rounds, I got dope for you niggas
Drug dealer shit, drug dealer shit
Drug dealer shit, help you cop something nice from a dealership

[Verse 2]
I push rounds, I got dope for you niggas
If I was still out there they'd be no hope for you niggas
Hey you don’t smoke what I'm smokin' my nigga
That shit the river this the bottom of the ocean nigga
Shit change when that dope came in the picture
And all the niggas who told ain’t go to prison
Shit was all great, you still kept the biscuit
And you would probably fold when you see em' lift it
The narcs pulled us over on the traffic stop
On the east side summer time it was hot
He asked us what we 'bout to do, go and cop?
Cause you live on the hottest motherf*cking dope block

[Hook]
