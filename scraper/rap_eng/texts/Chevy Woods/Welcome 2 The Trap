LULU: You know what this is?
ACE: Yeah. That's coke
LULU: Yes, but that's a kilo of coke
ACE: How much it's worth?
LULU: $25,000
ACE: Damn

[Intro I]
Commission
Count that mother fucking money, nigga
Holiday season, oh yes Chevy
You came to the right one, nigga

[Intro II] -Chevy Woods-
When they talk about that money, gotta mention me
Bitches want me now because they see me on tv
I got the whole cake but you can't get a piece
In my hustle coat I wear that shit up on my sleeve
X2

[Verse]
Yeah I've in the trap, I’ve in the trap
Tryna double back, tryna double back
Ask my nigga Bo how I be in the kitchen
With the chickens  ain’t talking bout no freaking lickin'
I pulled up in that car you ain’t ever seen
28, 36; like what that mean?
If you don’t know the numbers you ain’t never juug
One second, man, I’m on the phone with the plug

[Hook]
Cause I was in the trap, I was in the trap
This sound like the trap, this sound like the trap
Gotta keep it strapped, feel like I was trapped
Welcome to the trap, welcome to the trap
[x2]

[Talking]
I swear to god, I put that shit on me
If you ain’t from here, don’t come here
If you don’t hang there, don’t bang there
Ain’t no game here, welcome to the trap
It’s what we do

[Verse 2]
Six-Hundred Benz with the limo tint
A penny for your thoughts and they don’t give a cent
Money on your head, money well spent
And I don’t even gotta be there when them shells spent
My nigga pimp about bout it, word to Master P
Got a hundred in the safe, and got the master key
And for this watch, I pay the ticket, it cost where you live
Versace frames in the coogi, I just do it big

[Hook] x2
