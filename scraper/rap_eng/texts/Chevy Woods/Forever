[Verse 1]
I just made a play on your bitch she in love with my watch, yeah yeah ooh
I ain't finish school from the school of hard knocks make more money than the teachers too
Got some cousins I ain't seen in a while when they ask me how I'm doing I just tell em cool
Taylor Gang and I put that on everything if you get to tripping I'm a fucking fool
Yea I'm way up way up way up
Tell them pussy niggas I ain't tripping 'cause I'm way up
Balling on you niggas this a motherfucking layup
I remember all the nights that a nigga had to stay up
If you owe a nigga gotta make sure you pay up
Handle all my business then I go and roll a J up
She was on gold, don't you never try and play us
Tell your baby daddy yea it's cool that he hate us
Cause we getting rich

[Chorus]
We getting rich we got money forever
Not just right now boy I want this forever
Cooking up O's and it's taking forever
She got it once now she want it forever

[Verse 2]
Got the iPhone jumping I ain't missing no calls Imma answer every one of 'em
My homies said he want a half of one come to the crib and Imma cook it right in front of him
Your baby daddy he a fuck up
He be fucking up the pack every time I be fronting him
I hit the block, throw the testers in the air
Hit the ground, fiends pick up every one of them
Put that on me I be running up numbers
Fucking up checks 'bout to fuck up the summer
Fucking your bitch but you swear that you love her
You can't fool me boy I smile undercover
Champagne coming by the case load
Hit your baby momma with a face load
She my se√±orita bring me Pesos
Chicken with the cheese I need queso

[Chorus]
We getting rich we got money forever
Not just right now boy I want this forever
Cooking up O's and it's taking forever
She got it once now she want it forever
