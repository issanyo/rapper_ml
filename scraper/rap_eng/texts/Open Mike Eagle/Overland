[Intro: Serengeti]
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?

[Hook: Serengeti]
I ain't got a job, but I'm working
Got a girl, but I'm flirting
I ain't sure, but I'm certain
I ain't really lost, but I'm searching
I ain't really bourbon, I ain't really uh, shit
I ain't got a job, but I'm flirting
Got a girl, but I'm searching
I ain't sure, but I'm fuck fuck
I ain't got a job, but I'm flirting
Got a girl, but I'm searching
I ain't sure, but I'm certain
I ain't really lost, but I'm searching
I ain't really bourbon, I ain't really turning
I ain't r-- shit

[Verse 1: Serengeti]
Chris McDowd looks like Joe Piscopo, stereo system is Arsenio
Living in Tampa, me and Tamantha, she was a dancer in Orlando
I wear purple like I'm Panthro, turned up the Santro, pumping J-Lo
Fresh ass, dark like Crockett, hands in my pocket
Got a picture of you in my locket, about to take it in you like a motherfucking socket
Next up on a docket
In your quarters, in your chambers
In your nova, in your coda

[Hook: Serengeti]
I ain't got a job, but I'm working
Got a girl, but I'm flirting
I ain't sure, but I'm certain
I ain't really lost, but I'm searching
I ain't really bourbon, I ain't really, I ain't really turning
I ain't got a job, but I'm flirting
I ain't got a job, but I'm working
I ain't got a girl, but I'm flirting
I ain't really lost, but I'm searching
I ain't really, I ain't really, ah
I ain't got a job, but I'm flirting
Got a girl, but I'm flirting
I ain't got a fuck, fuck, fuck
I ain't got a job, but I'm working
Got a girl, but I'm fucking
I ain't sure, but I'm certain
I ain't really lost, but I'm turning
I ain't really searching
I ain't really, I ain't really

[Verse 2: Serengeti]
Want a back massage, in my garage?
You wanna see my collage, you wanna see my Dodge?
Wants us to make you sweat? (Wanna make you sweat?) Want a cigarette?
What you want is up to you, shark attack
I'ma bring yo' friend to the back in my garage
Black don't crack, shark attack
Listen to J-Lo, on my stereo
Isuzu Trooper, in Daytona
Hot and wet, soft like salmon in the cooler
We got Danna in the distance, plane has landed
Planes are landing
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?

[Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle]
So demanding, underhanded
Underpinnings, got a hundred winnings
And many losses, I be flossing my teeth
I got no beef, I am a Christmas wreath
I miss the days, I miss the days
And I miss the minutes, and I miss my spinach
And I put these kisses in it, not chocolate
Watch my rocket ship, I am Apocalypse
In [?] nerd, no one's after him
Shadow Star, back to Zanzibar
Rapping in your daddy's car
Go real far plus electric
Bus pathetic, never release it
How we do it, call us Jesus, come back on the day after Friday
Do it while I make my molecules vibrate
And I dilate my own pupils, not used to you
Move through you like Metamucil do, uh!
That's a poop joke for you folks
Yeah, too close for you folks
Big hands, big cans
Need a kickstand, balling quicksand, ouch!
Ain't no oxygen down here, it ain't no air

[Hook: Serengeti and Open Mike Eagle]
A job, but I'm working
Got a girl, but I'm flirting (no air everywhere)
I ain't sure, but I'm certain
I ain't really lost, but I'm searching
I ain't really bourbon, I ain't really (there's no air everywhere)
I ain't really turning
I ain't got a job, but I'm flirting
I ain't got a job, but I'm working (ain't no air everywhere)
I ain't got a girl, but I'm flirting
I ain't really lost, but I'm searching (yeah)
I ain't really, I ain't really, ah

[Outro: Serengeti]
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?
Why you so demanding?
