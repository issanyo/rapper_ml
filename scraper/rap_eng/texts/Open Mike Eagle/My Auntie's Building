[Verse 1]
They blew up my auntie’s building
Put out her great grandchildren
Who else in America
Deserves to have that feeling
Where else in America
Will they blow up yo village
Don't knock me down
Don't knock me down
I beg you, I'm just chilling
I’ll fight you all, I'm willing
Just show me who’s that villain
I don't see one, I don't see one
I can't find nobody
Chicago or Benghazi
A high rise without no lobby
Run up stairwells like Rocky
'Cause these elevators so sloppy
Stop me now if I'm lyin'
But I don't need your buy in
Heard a hundred sirens
Attention’s undivided
I was in there, she lived there
She raised a few of her kids there
No lobby
No swimming pool
No need in buying no swimwear
Got memories from in high chairs
I stayed quiet like Ice Bear
They say America fights fair
But they won't demolish your timeshare
Blew up my auntie’s building
Put out her great grandchildren
That building cost 10 million
Now an empty lot not filled in
It was people there and kids there
And drug dealers and church folk
And they hit that shit with a wrecking ball so hard
Thought the whole earth broke
All them people dispersed though
Federal to commercial
State demolished my circle
I guess everywhere is my turf though

[Outro]
That's the sound of them tearing my body down, to the ground
That's the sound of them tearing my body down, to the ground
That's the sound of them tearing my body down, to the ground
That's the sound of them tearing my body down, to the ground
That's the sound of them tearing my body down, to the ground
