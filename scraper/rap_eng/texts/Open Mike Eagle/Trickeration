[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Buy seven, get the eighth one free though
They overcompensating, rolling quarters into Speedos
They make you sell tickets to a play
To rock a show that's happening a whole 'nother day
Your frozen yogurt is a lie
Machines full of unused boba in disguise
It's all a big sports debate show
They make them choose opposite stances, this shit is fake, bro
They mark up as a miracle
A thousand-dollar price tag, six-dollar materials
Madea movie on the tube
And I'm sorry to inform you the grandmother is a dude
Yeah, they like to say that we're post-race
So they can give us MGK and take Ghostface
At the supermarket, shit annoys me
I'm still tripping, how they getting milk from a soy bean

[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]
Trickeration (it's a trick) [x8]
Trickeration (so slow in the head)
Trickeration (so easy to trick) [x4]

[Verse 2: MC Paul Barman]
One foot in the Rockaways, one foot in the Upper West
People in shock today, even after supper rest
Rubberneckers see washed-up boardwalks and gravlax
The hyphen in "have-not" is a knife in the padlock
Keep receipts for price-gauge tax return
Shacks and earn, give your taciturn ass a turn
Nuance... needs are the new wants
You still clip coupons if your orbit's the Forbes list
Somewhere out there are trillionaires who abhor it
They don't stroke their double-chin billy-goat hair
They don't stand out nor act like they really don't care
Feels good to agree with me as you chill in your chair
Stalwarts in all sorts, their serves in our ball courts
Push over tennis wall, when it falls transforms to small forts
Now let's rest for a full note
This text is just filler, the best is the pull quote

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Milo]
(You're fucking with my head Michael!)
Twist your cool-ass mustache
But pretty soon you'll realise Riff Raff is just a cheap gag
I'd rather receive a left hook from Seth Brooks' dad
I think his last name is Binzer, Hamato Yoshi is Master Splinter
But you should already know that. This is absolutely one crazy town
And I get along fine for another lazy hound
Like the waitress lazily recites the side dishes for the night (Yuck)
My dude, I don't want none of these
Wearing purple robes like my name is Empedocles
And I'm hella suspicious
Reading everything on Twitter when I should mind my own business
Indeed, that's how they swindle and rob you
Seeing the next man has a Kindle and think "so should I, too"
Standing on the highest tower in Hyrule
The black Power Ranger waves down, "hi fools"
Ayo, this culture is mad dubious
When it comes to collecting rupees, I'm the poopiest
And when it comes to adult modelling, I'm the nudiest
Surf my pay-to-play website where I parade around in fabric skintight
They'll convince you that you do wrong
I tricked you like the dude at the end of the MF DOOM song
"Yo yo yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close range
The game is not only dangerous but it's most strange"
