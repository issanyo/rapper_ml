[Hook]
Don't go beating yourself up
Cause we all make mistakes
We trying to get the g's and the wealth up
We trying to get paid

[Verse 1: Alpha MC]
I'm back at it again
Like a crack addict with pens
In the alley in the back of the rehab that he went to
That's how I look at my cheese
Kraft on my mental
When neither one of them were suffering
From the negative chi that I give in to
Cause if at first you don't succeed
Don't get discouraged
Just get some herb and smoke some weed
A moment's occur when you were zonin' and your focus returns
I don't know the path to happiness
All I know is Swim Team cats is traveling
And no one has the answers
Cause the universe is vast and babbling
Way bigger than the cash you carrying
It don't help to marinate in every mistake you make
But it does help to know the right people
I'm flowing tight steelos
When I'm standing over my steeple
Accompanied by Open Mike Eagle

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Go ahead and rock your chain with pride
Be sure to get a diamond for every one of the slaves that died
Unless you wanna work eight to five
And not get paid to rhyme with a hater and an Asian guy
(The Underground)
Never got you in the first place
Go write some shit that chicks can rock to on their birthdates
Better yet a ghostwriter for the first take
Purchase some heat and hit the streets like an earthquake
Think of the people drinking their beer on the freeway
You want them bumping Brittany Spears in the PJs?
There isn't a market for weird rappers these days
Gotta support the careers of Clear Channel's DJs
Go write or rap about vagina meat
I'll help you find a beat
Cause nigga you just tryna to eat!
And fuck a clever rapping movement
You say that you sold rocks
You never have to prove it

[Hook]
