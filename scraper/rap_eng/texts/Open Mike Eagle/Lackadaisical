[Intro]
Just woke up man, let's do this shit

[Verse 1: Wax]
On my good time shit
Like Janet in her youth
Laid back on a hammock in the booth
No offense to Jesus but dammit I'm the truth
But that sweet talk stuff could cause damage to your tooth
That cavity rap get you rapidly smacked
I happily attack since I got my faculties back
But I don't get up
Drive-by slap from a bucket seat
Smoothly disguised but a rugged beat
Like a last minute shoulder check
Of the approaching threat of a wide cobra neck
You don't really know it til it grips you
Knocking on the studio door before it hits you
You'd've thought there was an octagon there
Pull the curtain up to reveal a papasan chair
I grill you up a superb chop of veal
Little did you know that it would be your last meal

[Chorus]
Lackadaisical
A leaf floating by in the wind
Lackadaisical
But that leaf might puncture your skin
Lackadaisical
Seaweed out in the waves
Lackadaisical
Like a lion at the zoo behaves

[Verse 2: Wax]
I exist in a timeless mist
Where there's no time to get violent or wild and pissed
I dismiss that roller coaster ride turbulent-ness
And keep a whole host of vibes at a tournament list
Retiring the signature, vet of sports
Old geezer by the miniature tennis courts
Between sets fresh mango juice
Shoe string's tight but the kango loose
And every old folks' home here to Boca Raton
For rocking vocals like I'm Joseph Ramone
Today's jazz clarinet and tomorrow's freestyle rhyme
But in the meanwhile I'm bumping the beat sent from E in my Sentra B
Essentially illest of the century
If they don't mention me with the greats
I ain't gonna hate
Hatefulness ain't one of my traits

[Chorus]
Lackadaisical
A leaf floating by in the wind
Lackadaisical
But that leaf might puncture your skin
Lackadaisical
Seaweed out in the waves
Lackadaisical
Like a lion at the zoo behaves

[Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle]
The half Burger King half IKEA
Brand new thing but it's a bad idea
If you work in here you should have a staff ID
And don't holler at the moon before I have my tea
For real though, how happy can a bad guy be?
I keep it dark in the middle like a black eyed pea
I'm at the VIP
I see MBG
I like to go see them
And see if they see me
I'm at the Rollie [?]
Sippin' a yogi tea
It's karaoke night
I'm picking ODB
Send emojis please
Baggie, I pickpocket trophies
Wondering if Urcle and Nad are still homies
It must get lonely in the bowels of space
Rapping crop circles, all the local cows escape
I'm at my aunty house she made a thousand k
She heard my new LP, she said it sounded great
And I'm lackadaisical

[Outro: Audio Snippet]
The glycemic index of Froot Loops is somewhere between 69 and 74 depending on which glycemic index you look at. These are highly processed grains, that really are not good for you in the first place. And then they add insult to injury with things like yellow 6 and blue number 2, these artificial colors again are something we wanna avoid, especially when we talk about things that we're going to be giving to our children
