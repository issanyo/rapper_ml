[Intro]
Leave you a good name, I'ma leave you an heirloom
You gon' think it's your birthday, when you come out your bedroom
And because of no pig men, let's go to the mall though
Ain't holdin' my kids back, I'm letting them all know

[Verse 1]
No choice but to entertain
Cause when the terrain, activate my December brain
Yeah, flights fall like ticker-tape
I'm up at dawn because we all anticipate
Yeah, imagination weighs three tons
I feel dumb because I didn't even sleep none
Yeah, yeah, let's get together, love
Let the gloves because it's colder than it ever was

[Hook]
End of a cold one, but the ghetto is ok
It ain't supposed to be no fun
But we can do it our own way
We can pretend to be icemen
The ghetto is so cool
It's even cold when they roast you
For coming out in your snowsuit

[Verse 2]
Yo, whatcha gon' fuck with, son
Greet the morning sun with your open arms
Whose sunlight is as cold as ours?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Got old ladies wearing big furs
Wind chill so cold it make your skin burn
Frozen finger-tips is how the kids learn
Freezy freaky mittens on glow
Didn't hear a season's greetin' cause we was eatin'
And some cold words don't need repeatin'
The trigger is so tight truthfully
Bunch of wrapped boxes where the roots should be at dawn, yeah

[Hook]
End of a cold one, but the ghetto is ok
It ain't supposed to be no fun
But we can do it our own way
We can pretend to be icemen, yeah
The ghetto is so cool
It's even cold when they roast you
For coming out in your snowsuit

[Bridge]
I'm a leave you a good name, I'ma leave you an heirloom
You gon' think it's your birthday, when you come out your bedroom
And because of no pig men, let's go to the mall though
Been holdin' my kids back, I'm letting them all know
I'ma leave you a good name, leave you an heirloom
You gon' think it's your birthday, when you come out your bedroom
And because of no pig men, let's go to the mall though
Been holdin' my kids back, I'm letting them all know

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, warm drinks always start mellow
Hot chocolate with the fake, little marshmallows
Actually, it was a real marshmallow
I don't know, I don't know, yeah
Yeah, I heard thirty bells ringing
Skin turn to purple so it's all thermal everything
I left my dirty boots by the front door (door, door, door)

[Outro]
I'ma leave you a good name, I'ma leave you an heirloom
You gon' think it's your birthday, when you come out your bedroom
And because of no pigment, let's go to the mall though
Been holdin' my kids back, I'm letting them all know
I'ma leave you a good name, I'ma leave you an heirloom
You gon' think it's your birthday, when you come out your bedroom
And because of no pigment, let's go to the mall though
Been holdin' my kids back, I'm letting them all know
