[Hook 1]
We've gone too far
We don't want to go back home
We don't like to see each other but
We don't want to go back home
So because we know what's waiting
We don't want to go back home
We've all gathered here today
Cause we don't want to go back home
By the way I've signed my name
You can see how far I've gone
Hold this pen out in my name
Still never found my home
Watch you stalking through the window
Promising to make things right
Trying to get ourselves to fight
For tomorrow night

[Verse 1]
Ma I'm done I call up the homie
I borrow his gun, I'm not gonna run
I'm my father's son
I hold up the legacy
Macho, masculine all in my pedigree
Angry and cold
Bold and intense when you're
Trying to not be so overly sensitive
Fail, fail, everyday, damn...

[Hook 2]
We know his trouble
So we don't wanna go back home
We know it's dark in here
So we don't want to go back home
We sit here and act adventurous
So we don't have to go back home
If anybody calls up say I'm here
Cause I don't want to go back home
By the time I get to Phoenix
It's playing on the jukebox now
Feeling so bold I'm not repeating
Until the bartender makes that face
Wasting time searching my homie's songs
And even trying my own name
The result's always the same
Zero matches found

[Verse 2]
A couple of beers, a part of the darkness
A couple of peers, I don't have a body
Just knuckles and ears
Please give me a glass with adjustable mirrors
Don't judge me cause I know it's weird
What if they followed us here
This gentrification tomorrow it scares me
Ninety nine bottles of beer on the wall
And tears in the stalls

[Hook 1]
We've gone too far
We don't want to go back home
We don't like to see each other but
We don't want to go back home
So because we know what's waiting
We don't want to go back home
We've all gathered here today
Cause we don't want to go back home
By the way I've signed my name
You can see how far I've gone
Hold this pen out in my name
Still never found my home
Watch you stalking through the window
Promising to make things right
Trying to get ourselves to fight
For tomorrow night
