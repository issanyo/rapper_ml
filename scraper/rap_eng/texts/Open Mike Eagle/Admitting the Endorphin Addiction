[Verse 1]
I chase my poison tail
And get so high that voices fail
I heard that when you in a fucked up space
No one can hear you signal help
I tried to set them straight
Tell them I self-medicate
All they saw's a glitchy video
But then I never show my cards
Instead, I write for stealth
Blah, blah, blah, I cry for help
All this bellyaching's just to say
My belly's hurting after all
It's all endorphins, though
Or maybe every Scorpio
Is predisposed to never feel as cold
As the first time they felt a loss

[Hook]
My addiction, my obsession
My admission, my rejection
I insisted, I accepted
My prescription carried us away

[Verse 2]
Pretend I didn't know
Who smoked up all the mistletoe
You'd really be surprised
How innovative I can get when left alone
And once them cravings strike
I knew I should say goodnight
Want for them endorphins
Got me saying everything except for that
White knuckle rodeo
And failing fills my holy holes
Staring at my phone
Wondering how endorphins travel via screen
As I feel my withdrawal
I understand them 90's songs
Rap music has ruined me
I always want to loop my favorite part

[Bridge]
Day to day
Today is ground zero
I'm twenty inches tall
Today, today
My sky has fallen
I have no resolve

[Hook]
My addiction, my obsession
My admission, my rejection
I insisted, I accepted
My prescription carried me away

[Outro - Alan Watts]
But then you see, you do the flip
*floop*
In giving away the control, you've got it!
