[Verse 1]
There's no rules left, it's a new moon
You can eat a hamburger with a soup spoon
You can chew shrooms, you can run a red
Or make fun of the dead, it's never too soon
It's never too loud, it's never to wild
It's all fresh, it's a new style, fresh as a nubile
Clear off your desktop mess, make room for some new files
Clear history
Open ears hear clear weird whispering
There's no rules left, everyone is listening
No fools left, everybody's instant kings
We all kiss the ring, 'cause it's a new greeting
Drop a new project every few weekends
Re-release it again, it wasn't too recent
It's all just truth seeking

[Break]
There came a day
When all of the letters jumped off all of the pages of all of the books
Every piece of film in every vault everywhere became exposed to the sun
And magnets erased all of the hard drives

[Chorus]
I tried but it's hard to forget it all
High time but it's hard to forget it all
I died but it's hard to forget it all
Eyes wide but it's hard to forget it all

[Verse 2]
There's no rules left, you can act foolish
Put it out there, accept what attracts to it
Start a mass movement, take your block over
Be a rock smoker, be a stock broker
Or celebrate for the whole month of October
Go further apart or get a lot closer
Get a Pac poster as a Biggie fan
There's no rules left, follow any man
Follow any woman, have many friends
Unfollow everybody and begin again
Start it all off on the wrong foot
No need to hide it inside, just let them all look
Because they're all shook from embarrassment
And if you're scared, get a therapist
Unless you're scared of Americans
Or the slave ghost stares of your heritage

[Bridge]
I tried to walk myself home but I don't know where I live
They asked me for my password but I don't know what it was
And I ain't got no passport, so I can barely leave
Where will I go

[Verse 3]
People eat boogers when they grown as hell
People beat hookers and don't go to jail
No rules is an effed up sentiment
But that's the only way to make sense of it
The conventional wisdom is insufficient
We undid what we implemented
And now nothing's cemented
No rules left fuck it I meant it
And I try to say fuck just to blend in
But my upbringing tugs at my senses
A foundation founded on making the ancestors proud in foul situations
But there ain't no now for the ancients
And if I say it too proud, I'm a racist
Everybody wanna dance in the streets too
Until it gets all crowded and dangerous

[Outro]
We live forever so whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest bis'
Can a nigga eat, pay the rent, bless the [?]
Master the art, and not-
Don't sell yourself to fall in love
Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is
Never leave me alone
