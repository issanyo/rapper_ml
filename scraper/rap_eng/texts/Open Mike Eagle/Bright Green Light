[Verse 1]
All I hear is haters when I walk out the house
Cause everyone that's positive talks like a mouse
And nothing seems to wash the taste of salt out my mouth
So I stumble through the front door then I fall on the couch
What brought this about?
Me giving too much credence to my walls and the shout
Fuck 'em all, they don't count
Not even a small amount in the grand scheme
Cause people want you to join 'em in a bad dream
Miserable motherfuckers are quick to start a tag team
I was pretty close to tapping out, they almost had me

[Hook]
Then I found that bright green light behind my eyes
I found that bright green light behind my eyes
I found that bright green light to my surprise
I found that bright green light behind my eyes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like I don't get the worth I deserve
When other people's judgments are not worth my concern
Cause there is not a human on this earth that deserves
Authority to box me 'til I'm dirt in an urn
So fuck your swag and fuck your swerve
And put the mic down, it's not your turn
I got a green light cause I just burned
I earned it every Thursday night on the curb
Where they light that herb and fight with words
And lightning strikes occur
But when I see that green light in my mind it's like a blur

[Hook]
