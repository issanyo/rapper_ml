[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Imma say what it do when it's too much
Imma say what it do when it’s too much
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, one, two

[Verse 1]
Might not wanna hear it but the truth hurts
My pot belly getting big, need some new shirts
Everything ain't great but I can do worse
'Cause I can go to the dentist when my tooth hurt
I don’t watch Blue Earth when I get stoned
I pull apart a ink pen like a wishbone
Used to spend hella time in the friendzone
Loin cloth and a tie like a Flintstone

[Hook]
Big afro, wig with a chinstrap
I'm thinkin' real hard, chewin' on a pen cap
Some songs just more for the headphones
Fuck the NFL, fuck the redzone

[Verse 2]
It's about time people get set straight
They got my stomach upset, Kaopectate
And I was up all night, went to bed late
I had a big fat Frank Black head day
Cut the dead weight off, get a new start
Cos you can sell hot dogs at the fruit cart
And if you verse too long make it two parts
I had a real bad dream, Bob Newhart
And I woke up cryin' in the bed, y'all
My lady asked am I good, I said hell naw
And then I felt all bad for my weird mood
I looked up and the sky still clear blue

[Hook]
Big afro, wig with a chinstrap
I'm thinkin’ real hard, chewin’ on a pen cap
Some songs just more for the headphones
Fuck the NFL, fuck the redzone

[Chorus]
Yeah, it can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away

[Verse 3]
Why is everything so miscellaneous
My messed up thoughts come instantaneous
And rap is dangerous as hassle made it, yeah
Yeah, I murder Dracula in Castlevania
Then the sun comes up, and I need it
Vampires don't fuck with my genius
Mispronounced that though, I meant "genus"
(Don’t let 'em see you ride your own thang)
Check the censorship
Extra strength for them extra sensitive people like me
She got them Triforce pieces I need
I won't buy 'till I see some ID (okay)
What’s your largest sofa, can I put one arm in Barcelona?
Stretch all the way to Are-izona
If not, fuck that, party's over
Sorry Bulma
Find Vegeta
Bye Rihanna
Hi Felicia
Hide all yo weed inside your speaker
Bye bye police, it was nice to meet you (yeah)

[Chorus]
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away, just shut yo eyes
It can all go away
It can all go away
