[Verse 1]

What did I do this time
Did I leave you in the club again
Stuck looking for a husband with the homies drunk junk rummaging
I apologize
And I hypothesize on the day my damned helicopter dies
I might send you on a mission for some waffle fries
I'm trying not to lie, so ain't you proud of me
Imagine how good everything's about to be, like two thousand three
No recession dear as good as yesteryear
Let's have breakfast
I've made progress, I'm only half sexist
My rap necklace
Has been replaced with medallions, so let's carry on at the pace of a stallion
Your face should be smiling
I'll take undeserved groups for a thousand
And I'll make undershirts with you on the pouches
Your boobs won't fall out this time I promise
It won't be tie-dyed or shrink five sizes
You won't catch the pink eye virus
I swear no conjunctivitis
I know you don't like it
No motorboats, facebook pokes or drunk driving
And I'll be much more liked, I'm
Out doing things started rooting for the Vikings
That would be the icing on the cake called ASS
I floss between all teeth and take all baths
It takes all path, goddamn a facepalm
But don't get embarrassed, I feel no pain
Caterpillar world with a steel toe frame
Boot to the ankle but I need no crane
This isn't the end of the tour I'm sure
The road makes you sick, but I know a cold cure
And oh it's so pure
I'm learning how to rotoscope so I can add allure
To the facetime phone call, it's all in real time
Making margaritas, chopping all their limes
In a Cosby sweater, the pleasures all mine
The pleasures all mine
The pleasures all mine
