[Verse 1]
I do shows for rap fans and smart people
Alcoholics, book readers and art people
But wallflowers and participants aren't equal
So if you've never made noise time to start people
And I don't wanna hear that socially awkward jive
'Cause i'm the king of the socially awkward guys
If I can stand here and vocally talk through mine
Then all these other nerds should totally fall in line
And all them ladies quit pretendin' that y'all so shy
And actin' like its unlawful to talk to guys
Go up to him make a move if he caught your eye
Whoever told you that was slutty just told you lies
I'm tryna make it not your typical rappin' show
If that's what crackin' stop the track 'cause I have to go
2011 yo i'm fed up with that fo' sho
Now information age we gain interactin' though (?)

[Hook]
Turn to your neighbor say neighbor
Do you wanna see somethin' new
Well I can't tell by your behavior
'Cause you're still standin' still in your shoes
Turn to the other side say neighbor
Now I really wanna hear the truth
'Cause me and the choir put your feet to the fire now lets see what you're really gonna do

[Verse 2]
That's all we want but we won't beg and plead with you
If you don't move what the fuck do we need with you
We came a long way but we'll make it worth the wait
We'll turn this motherfucking place to rehearsal space
One persons great
Or we can rock for three
And me and Prolyphic can practice choreography
And make sure that we're all posed properly
For the benefit of those with flash photography
This is my good side
Make sure I look fly
And if its just a point and shoot, nigga goodbye
I need some depth of field to make it extra real
I want one of them creation record deals
But those only for martians and white women
That ain't afraid to say hard shit and write nigga
I live in an apartment with white tenants
So I'm disqualified but I will not apologize

[Hook]
Turn to your neighbor say neighbor
Do you wanna see somethin' new
Well I can't tell by your behavior
'Cause you're still standin' still in your shoes
Turn to the other side say neighbor
Now I really wanna hear the truth
'Cause me and the choir put your feet to the fire now lets see what you're really gonna do

[Outro]
Now everybody in the place with a hard rap face
I'm like gonwitchya, gonwitchya, gonwitchya, gonwitchya!
If you confused when you see sometin' new i'm like
Gonwitchya, gonwitchya, gonwitchya, gonwitchya!
If you came in the spot and didn't rock
I'm like gonwitchya, gonwitchya, gonwitchya, gonwitchya!
We don't need you
