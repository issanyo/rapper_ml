[Verse 1: MC Paul Barman]
Echo chamber, let go danger
Steatopygia, they had no idea
I'm the nicest since Dionysus
The second well-paid, all of a sudden self-made
Rugged interdependence:
Lovers stand at the entrance, arms folded
Would it be blasphemy to ask you to shake that ass for me? Ayurvedic medicine, the flyer way to better skin
Five fingers divided can't even high five
Five fingers together can keep them all alive
But Mr. Fisticuffs didn't get dissed enough
We gotta listen to criticism—a slap on the wrist isn't a bluff
There’s always room for humility, see
I got inhuman skills for you still to see
There's perfect settings all around
Tightropes pulled together make for solid ground
Double up on math and gym to graduate sooner
I wish someone had told me that before I was a Junior

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
They should call it L’apostrophe
It’s the capital of apple sauce and white wine
I saw a light shine, it was a beacon from the Keystone Pipeline
So then I got lost or maybe dropped off
It’s all a haze in the days since it popped off
My soul waves from the graves of the Choctaw, they always call The old phase wanna run toward baseball
The new brains weren’t certain yesterday is gone 'cause the time that we were slaves isn’t way off
I won’t play golf, I won’t pray to the sky and take days off
I won't wait to decide
I won’t sway to the side like my uncle that died of AIDS from putting needles in his veins raw
I like to hang around people with the same flaws in a roller coaster made out of chainsaws
Busta was right ‘cause everything remained raw

[Verse 3: MC Paul Barman]
Hey ya, got you all in check like a small insect
A veteran in rhetoric can pass a strange law
“Declined to indict” reminds me I’m “white”
Euphemism infuse a schism in truth and wisdom
“Decline to indict,” a new euphemism taken to filthy heights
Come Michael play in the milky night
How wrong can we say stuff and still be right?
Like “organic evaporated cane juice”
Your brain boost is my main use
With each heartbeat repeated and fart meat excreted
I spark offense against the dark arts’ heat, neat!
Hindsight’s a divine right
So be untrue to yourself and think your forethought through
Acknowledge we’re all brainwashed and you’re not you
