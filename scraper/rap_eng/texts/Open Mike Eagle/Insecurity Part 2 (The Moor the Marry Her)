[Verse 1]
Nah girl it's all good
Ain't nothing special I had to say
Don't feel weird there's a chair here
Just let me put this here bag away
It's all good, all gravy
Let's all hang and be real good pals
Let's start drinking cause Lord knows
I don't want to feel shit right now
What's wrong?
Nothing pressing just work shit, you know how that goes
I'm just meeting your friend here
But don't want to take us all down that hole
Tell me how y'all know each other
What's cracking homie, here, take this seat
Just bags for some shit after dinner
It's filled with the shit I'm gonna take home with me
Don't worry about it, don't worry about it
Can't even tell you why I sat that there
Knock it down, push it over
Here we're making room so shit I don't care
What y'all drinking? What y'all drinking?
I got y'all, this first round's on me
Put your wallet down homeboy
You just got here, you trying to clown on me?

[Hook]
Got used to being a pair
That outside world is scary though
The more, the merrier (x6)
I wasn't really prepared
That outside world is scary though
The more, the merrier (x6)

[Verse 2]
Got a small table cause I was saving
The configuration we had before
Ain't much difference in two and three
Just put two together then add one more
Don't worry about it, don't worry about it
Let's point to people we call our foes
Oh shit you already know
God dang girl you share all our jokes
Now with this new energy
We'll make new bits and make new routines
Now with these new permutations
When we play our games we got two new teams
Hell y'all got your own history
I'm the newbie here, put me on
Different jukebox variations
Since every night we play the same two songs
This extra drinking might take too long
That's the only drawback I see
Me and you we drink all the whiskey
I pray to God he don't act like me
Two guys and one lady
We damn near could be Black Eyed Peas
Let's write a song about a girl who's slogan is:
"Fuck you I can do as I please"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I thought you'd come here on your own
I can't fuck with new people
I get so anxious it's lethal
Thought you'd know
I thought you'd come here on your own
I'm like not a cool person
In my head tonight I'm just cursing
Thought you'd know
I thought you'd come here on your own
This high doubt is so secret
Thought for sure that's how we'd keep it
Thought you'd know
I thought you'd come here on your own
I can't fuck with new people
I get so anxious it's lethal
Thought you'd know
