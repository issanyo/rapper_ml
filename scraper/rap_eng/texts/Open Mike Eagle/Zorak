[Verse 1: Serengeti]
Yeah
Just stuntin' on it
Father-in-law's mad, and mad space booty
Display [?], groupies named Suzie
Tropical and transparent, leavin' like a ruby
Courtroom drama and a coming-of-age movie
Treat the laides well, warm chest in a 'cuzzi
I know we just met, just come for like a hammock net
Backward chains, baby wet, don't forget your turtleneck
It's cold like a rain check or being outdated technology

[Hook: Open Mike Eagle and Serengeti]
How the fuck is I'm entertaining?
How the fuck is I'm entertaining? (Technology)
How the fuck is I'm entertaining?

How the fuck is I'm entertaining?
How the fuck is I'm entertaining?
How the fuck is I'm entertaining?
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Yeah
Feel my nervous, mic my heartbeat
I write with sharpies like I'm Mike McCarthy
Reffin' fights between lights and darkies
And my malarkey's all in checkered
Old emotions dissolve collectives
The hero fell so we should call detectives
The old wind's blowin' me in all directions

[Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle and Serengeti]
Coffee sip, swollen hip from a jet ski flip
Tobacco pipe, amber stem, eagle rim, golden trim
Gold heads, glass legs, rusty hinge, amp legs
Lookin' like a sand wedge, sandy pants, golden floored
[?] ocelot, used to smoke a lot of pot
Hella Ls, roll it up, [?] it up, light it up
Did it weirdly, what happened last week? Steve (Steve)
Motherfucker please, go
Yup (Shit)

[Verse 3: Serengeti]
Yo
Tokyo is expensive, [?] mad, lonely, lovely, moody
So long Japan, return of the lion man
How are you my lion? Words exactly as on Bob's chest
He gets annoyed all the time, tryna get into his mind
Wish I could kill this mime, and the hyenas growled outside
You could see the fire from the planes in the sky
Mighty Micro, let go, technology
How the fuck this is, is, is entertainment?
How the fuck?
