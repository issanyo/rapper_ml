[Verse 1]

When I was a smaller Eagle
I was told I'd be richer than a lot of people
I was dressed like a very important boy
In my K-Mart brand sweaters and corduroys
And when the girlies looked down, it was really over
Black argyle socks and new penny loafers
I was erudite
The type of kid that most parents liked
I never begged 'em for a pair of Nikes
Cause I was studying brine shrimp and parasites
And learning how to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
(Nerd Alert!)
With thick glasses and everything
Supposed to have big cash when I'm seventeen
From working in research labs with acetylene torches
And a flying Porsche with leather wings
But looking back I wasn't too clever
Cause I grew up to be the smartest broke dude ever

[Hook]

But since it's too late for my goals
I'mma start a party that they can't control
From the Blowed, Swim Team got the H2O
So we gon' start a party that they can't control, yo
I never found no ancient scroll
But I'mma start a party that they can't control
You know my crew get the money and the fame and go
And we gon' start a party that they can't control

[Verse 2]

I be in my kitchen chewing on chicken fat
Thinking about Twitter, I should have invented that
That's not gold from a man's mind
It's just a whole bunch of code on command lines
I get ideas but they explode like land mines
I blame the Masons, they control us with hand signs
I also blame the school system
Except I used to teach, so I fools with 'em
They taught me all about metaphors
And other shit to make me smart but extra poor
Like which rivers flow through Ecuador
I got a high IQ and low credit score
A lot of rich cats are dumb as shit
They just work loopholes in the government
But how much dough these dummies gon' get
Raise investment capital, put your money on this right here

[Hook]
