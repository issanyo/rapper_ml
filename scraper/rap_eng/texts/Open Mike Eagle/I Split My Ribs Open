[Verse 1: Left At London]
You go on and on and on and on and on
About your plight
Tell me, will you be alright?
Tell me if you'll be alright
You go on and on and on and on and on
As if I didn't care
And I wish I could be there
God, I wish I could be there for you

[Refrain: Left At London]
Ah, ooh-hoo

[Chorus: Left At London]
Stay back, come back, make up your mind
'Cause I can feel it gettin' imminent
I know you feel a bit resigned
And I have never been articulate
So say, are you safe?
Are you safe? Are you safe?
Are you safe? Are you safe?

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Tryin' on my slip-on disguise
I'm wondering which wire I done tripped on this time
Stuttering in every language I have ever learned
And I'm usually hella good at feeling very unconcerned
But there's something in my eye
Or it's something from the sky
Oh fuck it, I'm crying, now here's a bunch of reasons why
And maybe I should focus on the one that's most ferocious
I split my ribs open, ain't nobody even notice
Look at all this blood
This whole damn kitchens about to flood
Afraid to dirty up your hospital scrubs or fuck up your buzz
When I'm gone don't pretend like you didn't know what it was
And nah, I don't mean when I die
I mean when I leave without saying goodbye
'Cause I'm offended that I'm hurting and your care is denied
You just gon stare at the sky?
Alright, bet, I'ma bear it in mind
But when it hurts, don't compare it to mine

[Chorus: Left At London]
Stay back, come back, make up your mind
'Cause I can feel it getting imminent
I know you feel a bit resigned
And I have never been articulate
So say, are you safe?
Are you safe? Are you safe?
Are you safe? Are you safe?

[Outro: Left At London & Magdalena]
Are you safe?
I hope you're doing better now
Okay, bye
