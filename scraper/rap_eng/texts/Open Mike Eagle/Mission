[Verse : Sno]

I'm Unfuckwitable wearing these Gucci Flip Flops
Khroam on my hip bitch
I like what I like, spit when I got the Open Mike
Let it rain on the hook
Since it's heavy let it Sno
Savage on this shit and your bitch gonna know
I got Tru swag, this is my Cue to show you the Flow
Give me the Peso
Killing the flows, reach from your head to your toes
Relaxing your mind
Glad that you finding the time to listen to rhymes
Fuck with my vibe and come chill with the tribe
Come chill with the pride, nigga I'll give you a ride
My nigga just fucking subscribe
Got this flipflop you can try, fuck it you need it prescribed
My niggas we conquer, divide moving worldwide
Coincide with the strive, drinking sprite
Supplied by the real niggas
Holding real triggers, verbal AK spray
All  I wanna do is get money
All I wanna do is spend cash
All I wanna do is fuck hoes
How long will this shit last?
