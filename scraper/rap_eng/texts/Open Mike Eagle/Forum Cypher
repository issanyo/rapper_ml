[Intro: Khroam]
What the fuck....
This shit really got supported...
Alright, cool, fuck it
Lets go!

[Verse 1: Khroam]
It’s the chronological chronic logical liar
Rapping circles round the novices like golf carts and dryer cylinders
Shit concrete like porn with closed captions
Watch what happens then cum into a penguins habit

[Verse 2: Halfadelic]
Imma fuck yo bitch
Then imma make her shit
If she keep talking Honey Crisps
Then imma make her flip (SWAG)

[Verse 3: Open Mike Aguila]
Swag swag swag swag
Swag swag swag swag
Swag swag swag swag
EXTRA swag swag swag
FUCK YOU!

[Verse 4: The Waters]
COME THRU WITH THE BLUE BADANA
IN MY ASS THERES A BUNDLE OF BANANAS
THINK FAST, BECUZ THEY CALL ME SANTA
FLYING ON REINDEER, CALL IT UR BITCH
WHATS THE SITCH, KIM POSSIBLE
SPITTING IT LIKE LEELO AND STICH
AOHLA MEANS FAMILY

[Verse 5: Gold]
I got 50k in the knapsack
Watch me stunt hard and slay tracks
Got the 9 on me like a price tag
Shootin these niggas with the dice mag
Hoes suck my dick cause I’m such a stunna
Girls blow you off cus you smell like Dung-A

[Verse 6: Murkman]
Fuck bars, that twix is for your kids
Toddlers in a candy store, silly rabbits who fall for Easter Eggs
Meanwhile, I lay tracks to rest with lead pipes
Hip-Hop is Guantanamo, I’m the warden, my bodyguards are dykes

[Verse 7: Genio]
Shut up bitch its bed time
Come for that ass, no homo
Its giggty time
Spit hot fire, Quagmire

[Verse 8: Uncledb]
She sells sea shells on the sea shore, no
He sells weed scales and a P4, yeah
He sells details, swiping the law
Deets, AKA credit card fraud

[Verse 9: Khroam]
Shoot a nigga
Fuck a bitch, nigga
I'm a real nigga
Cuz that's whatcha do when you a real nigga

[Verse 10: Gold]
Airs a little thinner where I breathe
You can find me out in Paris finding pairings for the brie
That’s the king of cheese, shit, I’m getting cheese
Easily imported but I’d rather switch the scene
Hop a flight and I’ll be out in paris by the night, dine at Brasserie

[Verse 11: Nebuchadnzr]
All I need is 4 bars
But I have the skill 2 do it in 3
Cause ain’t no 1 here fucking wit me

[Verse 12: iForgotAboutDre]
Yo I’m so high, bald eagle
Bitch I’m hard to kill, Steve Seagal
Young money Cash money
All I know is money
* Bird call *

[Verse 14: Uncledb]
Don’t bring war to the king
Don’t tell me about draw for The ting
YO Right about now
Your heads so big you get charged more for you’re trim

[Verse 15: Murkman]
I bucked-shots at bill beaks-on, whom can’t stop squawking
Since Murkman can't be conned, yet was marked with a flu, Avian
By condors, ‘cause white-lied pieces of shit, are what you believe in
So best have credence, in that pearl pile, of vanilla pudding
That my wings span, spreading as that strain which sickens at ease
Through the airwaves, like a new form of communicable disease

[Verse 16: BDP29]
Put me on a track with Gambino, I’ll upstage him
His lyrics are so corny, but he thinks they’re amazing

[Verse 17: BiterBitingRewrittenBits]
New jack mess with whatever snappin
Jetting these shark biters kid from gotham will leave you paykin @payked
@SDVG hoes think they supreme, clientele just got them ready to dye
And wannabe wu tang fans think they got cream, super sayian with knowledge show em whats fly

[Verse 18: Khroam]
I got bars and they heavy
Heavy than your mom on a Sunday
I go to church in my Jack Skeletons
I shoot niggas avoid if you not wanting to be a skeleton
I’m heaven sent with bill and shit
I’m Bill Nye I fuck bongs on PBS
Shit correlate nigga more or less
Jumping jacks on the bridge ideal death

[Verses 19 & 20: Murkman]
So you can vote “Yes I Can!” (I'm not lightskinned!), for me in 2016
I’m a real American, just don’t expect me to rep
That red, white and blue, anytime soon because
The fireworks I fire will crack, and split crackers
Down to the middle, like Malcolm or Muniz, to be frank-eeeehh
And go krack-krack..... krack-krack-krack-ka-BOOM, that fire works Though all I do is launch Fireworks, don't call me Canadian, boy
Or I’ll make them waters-work, I’m not sweet, like a maple leaf

But me? I drizzle smoke around, great Redwood trees
As a lumberjack, however I kick into the lumbar region-stumps
Of Black Hippies, to insert vile into ci-vil liberties
‘Cause I’m bringing Independence back, like on the 4th of July
Not rhetoric that you lie about, as if they're views from thee.... 666
I meant 1776, this is a wake up call - TempurPedic, not a Drake diss
Fuck all these sweet 16 ho-bitch niggas, I been spitting sweet 16's
Like Em was an M-16, unloading on ages of whomever was 16

[Verse 21: BDP29]
Call it a Childish insult, but I’ll still call you a faggot
You think your raps are fly, but they’re lower than maggots
Smackin' backs with the mac, is how I enter your palace
Knock you off of Stone Mountain,  drink your blood from a chalice
Call me callous I don’t care, cause your rhymes are wack
Smell the malice in the air, make your skull go crack
Daedalus when I build your cage, pitch black
The fact is when I attack, body bag is packed

[Verse 22: MFarrer74]
You thought I was down and out
But really your mind is in doubt
I've been hiding on the forums for a couple years now
Now it's time for y'all lames to bow
To the greatest to ever touch the keys
QWERTY loves how I do it with ease
Y'all ain’t showing love to my bars
Go ahead and smoke those cigars
While I work on my craft, I remember those stars
On a night that makes me feel like a czar
I don’t know how you can recover from those scars
That I gave y'all while listening to Kendrick Lamar
While holding a 40 as I ride in my car
With a shotty and I think I’ve gone too far

[Verse 23: JonnyMillerRaps]
People who write rhymes
We ain't equal at all times
I dont feel like rappin now
Gimme a bannana peal and half a pound. uh

[Verse 24: NLbway]
I’m young as hell like Caillou
Don’t fail like Caillou
I go for it like Caillou
Fuck Dora, Caillou

[Verse 25: MakNikova]
Before it all surface, no one is perfect
But all of us together can seem worth it
Experimental purpose, scientific verses
I beat box the beat by puttin them in hearses

[Verse 26: Khroam]
Mraz screeching blood clot
Comeback bats locked arena come out
50 cubic part cuban backwood glue in
Gorilla clawing off the lawn
Articulate like God, Aesop stories
Lorie with the loosie and the bleached inflection
Infection Z survival X detonation
Detonations on tracks like logical break in

[Verse 28: Murkman]
‘Cause I pop shots, into the clavicles to crackle M&MC’s
When I snap on, these cracker, sugarcoated motherfuckers
To remind y'all, I’m the original serial killer
To your Hip-Hop-sin, corny ass, trash bag transgressors
Reducing everyone of you down to size, “Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"
Again, god damn and I melted y'all mortals into
Sugary morsels, fried your lyrics and made them a reduction
Just to give RG a taste, of what means to have substance

[Interlude: BTP47]
Aight, guys…I was not prepared to freestyle…

[Verse 29: BTP47]
Its the T U T, yall r just ants to me ima aardvark
Im higher than u think i am on the bar charts
Even higher than a far star
U can even call me fuckin Jupiter
(God that was bad…)
Walked the same roads i know how hard it can be
I’ll guide you, you still fuck with me, don’t take a side or be free
As i’m have poems that has approached by cross roads
Body doze, who ? give em karate blows

[Verse 30: Murkman]
All I hear nowadays, is everyone up to no good, just evil
The D'evil’s in your crew, are less cru-el than, Cru-ella D'e-ville
Emcees trying to act like scam artists, scamming those in the arts
Cocky ass upstarts, whose voice ain’t worth more than my farts
While my craft-Hov-ers-o'er, your Craft Mac-N-Cheesy asses
Triple entendre, so please don’t ask me how, ask Hov
You damn amateurs, who have no respect nor love
For the form, can’t read anywhere, regarding the lines
Unless it’s burning trees, purple streams, or a hero-in white soda
We both already know, about that ego and how you’re “No homo"
Except all you can rap about is a mic, held close in your hand-les
While it’s wrapped close to your lips, so full of your self
Cause, within it has that lightbulb: you’re a flashing ass-hole
Ever wonder that’s why, all you spit is fecal-matter (no subject)?
Bending backwards to reverse cowgirl, a dickrided rapper’s style
Which is an homoerotic urge, you unconsciously, just can’t help
Man, it’s straight away to hell, with you fuck niggas, bruh

[Verse 31: The_Midget]
I’m midget but my dick long
That is what I told your mom, dawg
Playing cricket with my own dong
Hit a homerun don’t give a fuck if it’s the wrong sport

Verse 32: sho
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watching the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast, one hand, I juggle them both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coaching me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs
Fuck y'all pictures, your Instagram can gobble these nuts
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch (West x6)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies'll prolly turn these niggas to fucking Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich ass white girls looking for parties
Playing with Barbies, wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
(I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it)
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aiming straight for your pelvis, you can't stomach me
You plan on stumping me? Bitch I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas, climbing 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
Bout who's the best MC? sho, Jigga and Nas
Eminem, Andre 3000, the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rocking no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhyming with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Scope, -,  and Nappy
Tyrant, Amema, Murkman , Niday
Slickk, Freeus, TKSF, -
I got love for you all but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Trying to make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm trying to raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off trying to skydive
Out the exit window of five G5s with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot he drunk as fuck trying land
With the hand full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg
Bumpin Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 33: Quikstik]
I got a lyrical shotty for your body
Blow off your left arm, call that Uzumaki
I walk around and steal your girl like Tamaki
Anime bars muhfucka, what you know bout me?
I'm dangerous, product of Parker and Octavius
Meaning I'm of a superior era thus
Step to me, peep my CDs
Adam WarRock and Wu-Tang is what you'll see

(Ayo, pass the fucking hummus! Shit's gonna expire soon, man!)

[Verse 34: Khroam]
Bars I got bars
Bitches at the bars
I drop bars
Fuck y'all, I got bars

[Verse 35: Halfadelic]
All I see is snitches
All I get is bitches
If you talk shit then yo bitches get put in ditches

[Verse 36: MSeafood]
Check, His palms, spaghetti
Knees are weak, arms, spaghetti
There’s vomit on his spaghetti already
Mom’s spaghetti, he’s nervous
He’s about to eat cold spaghetti
He’s not ready, but he keeps on forgetting
To reheat spaghetti, all the guests cry so load
He opens his mouth but spaghetti won't come out
He’s running out, of the house to get some more spaghetti
But he’s too late, the spaghetti shop’s closed, blaw

[Verse 37: Sdin1212]
You know what I don't give a fuck about luck
Finna silence the game like Saint John of Nepomuck
Wanna find talent, reach into my bag or tricks
But the only thing you'll find girl is some good ole dick

[Interlude: Halfadelic]
(Damnnnn son where did you find thattttt)
(10x)

[Verse 37: Mattw116]

Coming with these lyrical tactics I’m always active never passive Steady rhyming through my passage making these classics
Lines always fantastic the impact I make is massive
While other rappers don’t even get you out your seat like you Degrassi
Unlike these other people I actually have character
I'm not putting up a drake image, you’re just a character
I’m telling you the story of me and I’m the narrator
I’m giving you these bars so you see that I’m a rare master

[Verse 38: Tyrant]
Movin' dope is my past present and Future
If my mound was any bigger you'd see me on Reuters
Cooking for two birds, only ones my bitch
Sit there and watch while I feast on this shit

[Verse 39: ZXQaos/Zade]
The rapture to rappers
Asshole assassin to ass’nance
Fuck sanction and passion
I’ll capture the masses of action from you faggots

[Verse 40: Time_Is_Illmatic]
I've got three whores spread on the bed and ready
With Double Ds I call them Ed Edd n Eddy
They call me a combo of Nas and Biggie
Had a menage with Nicki and Iggy
Flow so ill it needs a doctor
I've got two identities like Peter Parker
I rule like a Tyrant on the mic
And when I Scope You I'll put you in the dark no Streetlights
Got a girl with the ass of a Kardashian in the car dashin in
With the same flashin grin from the paper mag again

[Verse 41 : sbk]
Who wants to fuck with me?
Bitch i don't know
I'll leave you in a body bag
Looking like a burrito
That shit you spit is childish, Gambino
Im headed to the top, these haters trying to spoil it
They wouldn't be shit even if they were born in a toilet
I spit fire, step back cause its danger
Your mom should have aborted you with a coat hanger

[Verse 42: RESosa]
At first, reading this verse will make you sigh
Pay attention, this shit's  gonna inspire
Time isn't really Illmatic, is it
I'm gonna pop this bubble you think you're in, just like a zit
You will be forced to quit
Start beef with me, that's gonna be your first mistake
I will cook it, but I will not bake
For God's sake

[Verse 43: Kalsemari]
Yeah it’s still me, K-H-A LED
Tyrant on the same song I was on, no sony
I'll Scope You all, but no point in sniping fags
Top of the game, to reach me you need some hiking bags
I’ll sock a nigga and I don’t need nike to tell me to just do it
Following me like a fucking flock of sheeps, call it a Eid movement
But I don't walk a flock, I just throw flame and cock my Glocks
To shoot at the too many wanna-bes
And ex-bitches wanna castrate me like IMDB
They say I am creepy
But they haven't seen the real me, kalsemari
Israelis got more rocks on, than my fucking watch dawg
You be soft, I’m a rapper and a rockstar
Gangsters get Glocks, and pack more bars than a fucking gym
Macks for christmas, dicks for Christy if you're Johnny Sins
I rap this, you just sing it, perhaps you’re misfits
I take a dip in the pool and ya’ll follow like dipshits
Bitch I deserve my respect, but it doesn’t mean shit from fuckboys who lick dick
Not meant to get you twisted, but I like my bitches in C’s like Pimp did

[Verse 43 A_Master_EZ]

Money is time and time is money
I got time, so im rich, bitch
Fuck hoes and i don't pay them
Get all the bitches like faggot and fem'
Mess with me, lol, dont bother
Ur mom marries my dad, I dare you to step brother
Tell a bitch she got mirrors between her thighs
See my self there dont worry bout the size
With the mic im a dyke, cause no nigga can fuck with this
I see u bitch, she open wide, basically do the splits

[Verse 44: BDP29]
Fuck Gambino and anybody that love him

[Verse 45: ZXQaos/Zade]
Double the bars, rubble to stars
Run in the dark while I juggle a Park- er
Rhyme hard-er than darker the heart
Of a wet causer a' arson
If I was frozen inside of a moment
I'd blaze the flames of rage and motherfucking
Close it
But I'm as cold as snow coated boulders, no emotion
RG, I keep, total devotion

[Verse 46: Slickk]
I spit hot bars like I am forging steel
Get out of my lane with your boring appeal
I overshadow your whole style
So keep barking up that tree, I'll be here a while

[Verse 47: MyNamesCody]
Heyyyyy lol kk pz

[Verse 48: Quikstik]
(Had to come through with another one, hold up!)
Public Enemy mixed with YG, what’s that make me?
Lyrically I intimidate and educate thee
I’m the white boy knowing about COINTELPRO
So when I see racism I know how far back it goes
But y'all ain’t looking for conscious flows so
I tear up my home state harder than RTJ
When they came with Che and the Brusier Brigade
Tore up St. Andrew’s and left the smoldering decay
With Danny Brown putting the remains in an ash tray
Got me hyped enough to punch Floyd Mayweather in the face
Knock his teeth out and call it a day
Except Manny would have my head so let me collect it
I see the bodies of wack MCs let me inspect it
You hear this shit and you gotta respect it
You gonna re-read this shit and say
Damn Quikstik wrecked it!

[Verse 49: LAzY]
I come down from a loose high
When I walk through you know these geese fly
I keep it real cuz that’s what I was born to do
You call yourself bad bitch but i'v met worse than you
I come up with the weed like shottas
Big like poppa I tell them nada for the prada
They come back wit the pistol and shoot gratata
But believe me i’m not fazed i’m not bothered
Keeping it real but always feeling managed
Bounce back from rockets with no collateral damage
Put your whole goddamn career in a casket
Do I love her I tell her don’t ask it
She’ll be set up for disappointment
I ain’t her shrink I don’t take appointments
They come at me with potions for my emotions
In rap I get promotions move through the ranks without motion


[Verse 50: JWTM]
I'm not even much on the forums, but an artist on YouTube
Say like a god to these people reppin' ether making London Bridge burning to make on suffocate and lose
That's too harsh for me to talk like that, guess y'all caught me rapping like a newstyled Drake
Not Edward Scissorhands, but i'll cut a bitch off if she tries to steal my fucking resume, dawg!
Yeah, shit spitting in circles of nervous, attention, and criminals  confused about the power spoken out the uvula.....
Those dots were for a pause on the beat if I screwed up and left my richest rhymes in locker, think that I forgot the code again
Sometimes i'm tired of being the ultimate and undefeated rap battler at my school
Because of what I spit automatic sunk Titanic number two, if I feel blue don't mean I always sing blues, double entendre
Too messed up to think straight with the doctor, that a triple enten- DRE!
Know y'all are wondering, "where in the hell is JWTM coming up with these new rhymes, came from nowhere
This guy need to chill out before Eminem turns into Slim Shady and makes a roast fair!"
Punishment was taught from him, guess i'm spitting as his offspring and i'm Drake's younger brother
So I should follow in there footsteps, it's 8:08 but where the bass at??? Continuing to build a Martian mask for my rock band
The man that has a verse after me named @Translucent and y'all might think I'm a nuisance to look into future
And knew who the next verse was but the truth is I keep adding verses when turning superior
Just like something I never saw, I don't wanna make a scene!
Pockets running empty but my money grows on trees!
Someone annotate my lyrics, justify the means
Twist it if you want to, it'll haunt you in your dreams!


[Verse 51: YoDawg111]
One verse to make it up top with the GOATs
I’ll give you my two cents with my cock in your girl’s throat
Death multiplies by threes. SDVG, RedMasta , and Danger-Ru$$
Wonder who the fourth will be to bite the dust
Focused on the top with the attention span of a 5 year old
Listen for six seconds and my flow will knock you out cold
Waking up at 7 AM the day is looking bright
Go out for coffee after I ate out your girl all night
Every day, stay trapped with that nine
Get laid like it’s my job, hook up with another dime
Every other rapper taking an L in this event
Been in the game since I was 12 with everyone else underneath
I’m sending bullets Darren Wilson’s way in a baker’s dozen
Put a fourteenth in him to remind him that he’s nothin
And just when you thought my 15 minutes of fame is up
I’ll spit another 16 to show you why you all suck

[Verse 52: ChamKoopa]
I’m killing this website like I’m trynna get signed
All ya fuckers doing is running from the feds, right?
So nobody here? The game’s mine, I guess that’s fine
This cypher is over, you just missed the dead line
And before me, there’s just a fucking dead line
If you suck at rhymin', you should go to bed cryin'
Didn’t your mommas told you it was a bad time?

[Verse 53: Cordel]
Killin these bitches like im Michael Vick
I know I’m the best so hop of my dick
And yo “Bad Bitch” look like my shit
And she got those pink pussy lips
Watchout for gun cuz im murkin niggas down
TU TU TU is how my gun sounds
You faggot ass niggas dont know bout murder
I’m the best in the game just like Richard Sherman
Bobby Shmurda fucks males and his faggot ass “gang"
When I see this bitch ima hit him with a bang
GS9 like to fuck guys in the ass
While Glo Gang looks in the dumpster for cash
At least I’m honest to the rap game
I’m just tellin the truth so who you gonna blame?

[Verse 54: Akuma]
Apparently users dont know what four bars is
Typin raps in the cypher like they about to get the biz
When problably no one will listen to this
Although keep rapping cause you never really know

[Verse 55: ZXQaos/Zade]
Yo, I'm the hardest
Hardly Harlem, the holy hound of darkness
I hold artists by the cart'lage, causing carnage
Hip hop's become concerning
Expect me to purchase this version
Of the game?
Fuck's sake, where's the murder?
Anyways, I'm the next thane, wreck lames
A neck pain in the best way
10's 8, but I'm 5' 9"
Cause I write rhymes as the light's lime
While the mike's mine
I can swipe life-lines;
Oh, and Zade rhymes with blade
It's why I'm named as the fucking
Renegade
Of this yphercay
(Spoken) Yeah yeah, 16th bar, still hard

[Verse 56: Pakyed]
I need to get this off my chest, like women with breast cancer
I have a fetish to develop AIDS, just to make it spread faster
Fuck a sexy dime on her legs! See, I ain't what I eat
She got a Sixty-Nine on the test, So I gave her the D

[Verse 57: Shooter Starz]
Oh Yeah
Yeah, Yeeeeeaaaaaaahhhhh
YYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHH
Swag, swag, dab, dab
Whip, whip, wrist, wrist
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Drip, drip, flip, flip
Big tit, just tip
Yeah, aye, hey, sway,uh

[LAST VERSE: streetlights]
Eminem is trash
Chris brown is too
Kanye is a god
And so is Tyrant

Outro: Quikstik
RG, MOTHERFUCKER, FUCK WHO YOU THOUGHT IT WAS!
