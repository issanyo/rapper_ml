[Intro]
If I could afford it
Me and you would dance all the time

[Hook]
If I could afford it
Me and you would dance all the time
But somebody’s gonna check my piss
And I don’t want a background check
Not for a place like this

[Verse 1]
My legs are at a standstill
‘Cause I really can’t afford to pay my dance bill
They had one price written on the handbill
And then they drop these other charges like an anvil
My income bracket only parties at the landfills
I can’t afford to pay the cover to an anthill
Can’t pay my dance bill
I can’t afford the street car
And my coverage area is only three bars
There’s only three bars that means no reception
I can’t afford to make a better love connection
Credit rejected
Credit rejected
Credit rejected
Credit rejected

[Verse 2]
Back in my college days
I was foolish with my money in a lot of ways
I was dancing in McDonald’s on the holidays
Getting barbecue sauce on my Wallabees
Treating ladies to grilled chicken, extra Hollandaise
Now I don’t wanna pay to dance ‘cause I’m older now
And I don’t have twelve dollars for a Löwenbräu
I’d rather cop a six of Rolling Rock and go to town
I’ll just stay home for now

[Bridge]
(you know it’s just… just economics
It’s just mathematics
You can’t be mad at the numbers, I mean
You know, you have to compare
It’s like a thousand dollars for a drink versus uh, two dollars)

[Verse 3]
I try to pay it on time
But the automated system’s always offline
Wasting my talk time
Now I’m in this long line
Took a number waiting for the place to call mine
I’ve been here all night
They told me "shake your money maker"
That shit costs money too
They told me "shake your money maker"
That shit costs money too
They told me "shake your money maker"
That shit costs money too
They told me "shake your money maker"
That shit costs money too

[Hook]
If I could afford it
Me and you would dance all the time
But somebody’s gonna to check my piss
And I don’t want a background check
Not for a place like this
Not for a place like this
