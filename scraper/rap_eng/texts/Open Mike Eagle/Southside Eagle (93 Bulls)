[Chorus]
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls (And I don't know why)
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls

[Verse 1]
Yeah, shout out to Milo and Soulfolks
Shoutout to Midwest and both coasts
I'm growing hair on this side, not this side
Trying to make my outside match my insides
Living proof you can get what you intended to
I've been on every podcast that I listen to
And ain't no tickets on my credit card bill y'all
They got my name on will call at the ticket booth
I'm in a rap network, out of placement
I saw Kendrick at Leimert didn't say shit
I saw Vince at the club and didn't say shit
Cause this independent hustle is adjacent
Got in beef with a website 'cause they don't get that my life's real every night
I'm getting bread but I'm still living in the red
If you gon write about me get it airtight
I'm checking last years numbers and it's not bad
I probably need to start another podcast
I probably need to print another shirt run
It's first come, first serve 'till the merch done
Bring a spoon and a knife
Me and Video Dave did shrooms now we watching cartoons
"Hey Brain, what we doing for the night?"
"Trying to reach black kids in a room full of whites"

[Chorus]
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls (And I don't know why)
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls

[Verse 2]
My bow's out, trying to mark my territory
For my computer at the bar at the airport
USB charge from a spare port
Small talk and I'm not really there for it
Cause y'all know me
I didn't have a life plan after '03
In LA I went left on my OGs
And if the right hand knew, it never told me
I got a few close friends that I enjoy
Gotta make more ends, keep them employed
Live shows I be on my own
And when the merch line ends, I be on my phone
Reading Twitter takes, checking Instagram
Then I remember that I really hate Instagram
It's getting late, then I remember that I never ate
I got the cake, but I didn't make a dinner plan
Good dude, Good dude, who kiddin' who?
It hit me like a ton of bricks at the interview
I made a audio mural you can walk through
About my Auntie that I don't even talk to
I assumed it was right
Me and Video Dave did shrooms, now we watching cartoons
"Hey Brain, what we doing for the night?"
"Trying to reach black kids in a room full of whites"
I think about the kids Jeremy killed
Eddie Vedder put something on this therapy bill, yeah
He probably made hella bed wetters
That know every word to Yellow Ledbetters
I'm from the 90s, Fishbone with theremin
And big hits was love songs to heroin
In my hood OGs threw pitchforks
Now I'm northside bound doing Pitchfork

[Chorus]
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls (And I don't know why)
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls, 93 Bulls (Southside sunshine)
There's a Southside Eagle on the 93 Bulls
