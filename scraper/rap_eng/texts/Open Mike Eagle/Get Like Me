Open Mike Eagle:

I beg forgiveness and hunt for favors
The saddest emcee in a hundred acres
Had bad daydreams where I punch the neighbors
Gun Potatoes ?
Fun for Ravers
Old as fuck like the Undertaker
I'm Bo Dallas I'm so callous
Shirt so tight like Bo Clampin?
Interns watch me fold pampers
Since training day, it's training day
Got a Baroness I need a Lady J
I like yelp reviews that'll rate buffets?
I hate yelp too what I'm tryin to say...
Is I had hella birthrights that I signed away
But terms long, conditions stay
Top Ten Trapees, gotta mention pink
Next half bars the kitchen sink?
It come with website dog with missing links
I make the stiffest drinks the best of mens
Told one home girl we're the breast of friends
And apologized for like fifteen years
Actual rap name is Emcee Weird
I bet Pimp C freaked Britney Spears
I ghost write Sunday Gossip Columns
Free clinics hand out rotten condoms
And UFO's make the top Toboggans
Cause it's all hand made from top to bottom
Hit you with a frying pan like, Not the mama, Not the mama, Not the mama...
