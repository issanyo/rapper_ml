[Verse 1: Busdriver]
We’re not gonna quit, that’s the popular myth of our ancestors
Wallow in, drop to the pit with a sock on my prick
And my hands severed, I got one option to pick in an ominous grip
Of a planned centure , I take it cause I'm no apologist
For the chocolate chips that make a man's center, I’m where a hollow abyss
And an obelisk can stand together. While you’re out talkin' that shit
Those innocous crips they fan embers at the book burnings
When I jot down the script, my god is a bitch who’s transgendered
Up and dropped off a fifth on a modular synth, it’s a great gesture, nigga
(the opt of a gist when a cop is a fit for a clansmember)
It’s on the top of your list, a pop of the clip withstands pressure and squeeze
(Now shot to shift?) (my...) was a damn treasure, and you are lost to the mist
Cause you're not equipped to be man's successor
I'm the next step when the postular swiss leave tropical fish that swam together
(But you hate front me cause the bottle is thick) and my skin colour is a tan leather
But I can start you over, let me paint you, I can paint you ’cause I can never hate you

[Hook: Open Mike Eagle]
Let me paint you, I wrote a riddle in a dream
And it came true
Riding around town selling bottles of this oowee
From the moon like these other fools can’t do
Let me paint you, I wrote a riddle in a dream
And it came true
Riding around town selling bottles of this oowee
From the moon like these other fools can’t do

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
They handed us the precious stones
To keep your flesh and bones dancing in infected zones
And that philosopher’s rock is just a stepping stone
The higher goal is putting stutters in your metronomes
And we can lock this whole vibe in a quarantine
My brothers hover in the sky like they war machine
The first moment's like a high dose of Thorazine
That when the chorus sings I swear to life I see an old forest Brontasaurus scene
And three enormous kings, the Eye of Horus, start recording while hornet stings
My vital organs vibrate like a super-string
Spin the black circle till it sprouts Mini Cooper wings
We got the doubts so had to slow it down to bulletspeed
And fast forward as back where it used to be before king Cooper introduces you to user-read
Keep a journal ’cause my future is confusing me, it’s looping beautifully

[Hook]
Let me paint you, I wrote a riddle in a dream
And it came true
Riding around town selling bottles of this oowee
From the moon like these other fools can’t do
Let me paint you, I wrote a riddle in a dream
And it came true
Riding around town selling bottles of this oowee
From the moon like these other fools can’t do

[Bridge: Busdriver]
Paint me a comet that I've never seen
One that can’t be mistaken for anything
Likethe center of the sun
Paint me a comet that I've never seen
One that can’t be mistaken for anything

(I was born a king
I was born a king)

[milo]
I sat by my secret window to draft a thesis
On stretch limos as they pertain to black Jesus
And nascent bimbos destined to consume crack pieces
And why come it’s never gringos who lack visas
To work food trucks and make tasty snack tazers
I felt its reverberations through my hipbone
And I spoke the truth through wide nigga lips syndrome
That’s why accidental racism was just a thorn to me
Mike Eagle keeps telling me that I was born a king
They could not possibly afford the thing that they came to seek
They try to tame the meak, they’d have to pain their feet
And speak daintily, they couldn’t pay off these plaintiffs with their plane receipts
And I have found purpose from the pain in me
The days will pass and my curls will begin to look more like a crown
And I hear Alex Haley's ghost speak in Morse code without a sound
