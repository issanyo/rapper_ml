[Verse 1]
What you eating? Let's get you fed
Do you drink? Is you dead?
I got questions, you my first
Tell me what's keeping you on this Earth?
And why you ain't walk towards the light
I mean, this is one weird way to spend an afterlife
Ayo, I'm not judgin', we're just talkin'
But everything about this feels so haunted

[Hook]
Pardon me, I'm emotional
Excuse me if I get too personal
Because I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before
I've done seen a many do-si-do
But I don't know the steps to this ritual
'cause I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before

[Verse 2]
Be gentle, this is a first for me
And I'm a little scared baby in a nursery
You're an undead person, but it's worse for me
'cause I'm alive alright, but it hurts to be
You was alive, alright, 'cause I remember too
It was late last year, you were here for school (uh huh)
Everything was weird and cool
But it was tight back then, 'cause I was here for you (uh huh)
You went back, and I said, "What up, tho?"
Couple weeks went by, no rebuttal
You post online and you [?] with that
You both dead and alive like a [?]
You a ghost, but it's cool, 'cause you're mad delightful
So I don't have to act all spiteful, 'cause that's how life go
But y'all just catchin' light
[?] bring dead things back to life, though, if you're interested

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
How am I supposed to know?
Hold this moment or take it slow
'cause I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before
(Whoo!) I felt so alone
Who knew it was all just a broken bone
Because I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before

[Ending]
Shoot me your address, [?] you're haunted
[?] me, baby, I'll roll through
I'll recognize, but don't know the view
It's like people die when their phones do
What type of mess is my brain on?
Seven seconds of chaos
'cause if she's deaf, it makes me question:
Is a text message a seance?
And I don't know if I'm ready
To meet a person that died
That talks less like they're zombies
But looks perfectly fine
It looks like our flesh is the same
But I'm not gon' question the game
Imma take this number and lock you in it
Write [?] next to your name
I know apparitions and [?] visions
But don't nobody haunt me like you
"Who you gonna call?" Prolly not you
"Who you gonna call?" Prolly not you
I know apparitions and [?] visions
But don't nobody haunt me like you
"Who you gonna call?" Prolly not you
"Who you gonna call?" Prolly not you
