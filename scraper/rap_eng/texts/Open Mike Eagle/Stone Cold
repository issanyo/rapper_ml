[Verse 1]
This cadaver is quite old
Body temperature stone cold
The shoulders the right hue
Fingers and toes are alike new
The elbows are not a lot
But I can tell it's been a while since the heart stopped
No sound in [?]
But there's a little fluid in her left lung
The eyes look alive still
Mouth is relaxed like she died still
Up and for a moment as I race down
Ah, it seemed she's released bowels

[Chorus]
All the books say it's too late
If you wait for the blue face
Face-to-face like the two snakes
On the cover of a book
But between us there's other books
So let's take another look
All the books say it's too late
If you wait for the blue face
Face-to-face like the two snakes
On the cover of a book
But between us there's other books
So let's take another look

[Verse 2]
Her brain's damaged and needs more oxygen
I can tell you where to get new parts
But it starts with a promise that you won't go gossiping
Activities maintain with new drugs
But new brains don't warm up new blood
Lanes reduce as time passes
Men in black hats and dark eyeglasses proved
An electric shock can start motors
Every other things that stop can start over
Maybe there's some things to learn from dark code words
Maybe there's some folks who seen that she's gone
Maybe people study what they're not supposed to
Once everybody is sleeping 'till dawn

[Spoken]
I'm getting a little ahead of myself here but I need to uhm
Establish some ground rules you know what I mean?

[Chorus]
All the books say it's too late
If you wait for the blue face
Face-to-face like the two snakes
On the cover of a book
But between us there's other books
So let's take another look
All the books say it's too late
If you wait for the blue face
Face-to-face like the two snakes
On the cover of a book
But between us there's other books
So let's take another look

[Bridge]
You can't just want things like they used to be
With no transplants and no scars
Just put up with those stars
All that light happened eons ago
It somehow knows where you are
And there are those that reproduce starlight
Even though it's not at all far
Up close its power's up here
There is no far and no near
No hello or goodbye
Everything dead is alive
As it may breathe it's half gone
