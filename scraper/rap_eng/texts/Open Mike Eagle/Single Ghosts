[Verse 1]
What you eat? Let's get you fed
Do you drink? Is you dead?
I got questions, you my first
Tell me what's keepin' you on this Earth (yeah)
Why you ain't walk towards the light?
This is a weird way to spend one's afterlife
But yo, I ain't judging, we're just talking
But everything about this feels so haunted

[Hook]
Pardon me, I'm emotional, scuse me if I get too personal
Because I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before
I done seen many do-si-dos
But I don't know the steps of this ritual
Because I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before

[Verse 2]
Be gentle, it's a first for me
And I'm a little scared baby in a nursery
And you a undead person but it's worse for me
Cos I'm alive, alright, but it hurts to be
You was alive, alright I remember too
It was late last year you was here from school (uh huh)
Everything was so weird and cool
But, it was tight back then cos I would hear from you (uh huh)
You went back and I said "What up tho?"
Couple weeks went by, no rebuttal
You post online, and you haunt with that
You both dead and alive, like a quantum cat
And you a ghost, but it's cool cos you mad delightful
So I don't have to act all spiteful, cos that's how life go
But y'all just captured light
I hear GE bring things back to life though (if you interested)

[Hook]
Pardon me, I'm emotional, scuse me if I get too personal
Because I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before
I done seen many do-si-dos
But I don't know the steps of this ritual
Because I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before
How am I supposed to know, do I pause this moment and take it slow?
Because I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before
I felt so alone, who knew it was all just a broken phone
Because I ain't never been with a ghost before
I ain't never been with a ghost before

[Verse 3]
Shoot me the address, to your haunted
Apartment baby, I'll roll through
I recognise but don't know you
It's like people die when they phones do
What type of mess is my brain on?
Seven seconds in chaos
Cos if it cheats death it makes me question, is it text message or seance?
And I don't know if I'm ready, to meet a person that died
That talks less than a zombie, but looks perfectly fine
It looks like our flesh is the same, but I'm not gon' question the game
I'm gon' take this number and lock you in it, right there, next to yo name

[Outro]
I know apparitions and apparitions
But don't nobody haunt me like you
Who you gonna call?
Probably not you
Who you gonna call?
Probably not you
I know apparitions and apparitions
But don't nobody haunt me like you
Who you gonna call?
Probably not you
Who you gonna call?
Probably not you
