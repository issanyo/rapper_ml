[Verse 1]
I'm so stealthy, I'm so stealthy
I'll hide behind this pole
Watch me hide behind this streetlight
I'll get smaller watch me fold
You can't find me cause I'm tiny
I'm camouflaged in this pine tree
I'm camouflaged to my eyeballs
I got a secret mission like Skyfall
I'm like Nightcrawler or Mystique
Who the fuck I'm bout to be this week
I'm shapeshifting, I'm shapeshifting
Weightlifter or pip squeak
I'm so stealthy, I'm so stealthy
No co-defendants, don't help me
I'll pick pocket your drink tickets
I'm stocking up on these well drinks
I'm marching off to that green room
They couldn't find me no more
I was double fisting them well drinks
Right behind that door
Now I'm spying on ya, I'm spying on ya
I saw you picking your nose
I saw you pulling that murphy out
Your secrets' all exposed

[Hook]
I'll change my password so they can't find me
Police
So they can't find me
Congress
So they can't find me
I'll sneak up behind them

I'll change my Facebook so they can't find me
Exxes
So they can't find me
Spammers
So they can't find me
I'll sneak up behind them

[Verse 2]
I'll hide from you in your bathroom
I'm that slick, I'm that slick
I don't walk I just backflip
I'll pick-pocket your chapstick
I got Charlie Day for his rat-stick
I'm rearranging your key rings
You go to sleep with your face smooth
Now you're waking up to these bee stings
And these chicken pox and them spider bites
Hide your kids
Hide your wife
Wear two disguises at once
Call me black Napoleon Dynamite
Half afro and half jew-fro
I sneak around like I'm clousseau
Got the password to your Netflix
I'm watching every Naruto
See me standing on Sutro
Try to grab me but you're too slow
I changed the plates on my Yugo
Gotta fat suit like I'm sumo
I paid off all of my school loans
Gotta burner chip in my new phone
They killed Biggie, they killed Pac
They killed Benazir Bhutto

[Hook]
I'll change my password so they can't find me
Police
So they can't find me
Congress
So they can't find me
I'll sneak up behind them

I'll change my rap name so they can't find me
Exxes
So they can't find me
Spammers
So they can't find me
I'll sneak up behind them
