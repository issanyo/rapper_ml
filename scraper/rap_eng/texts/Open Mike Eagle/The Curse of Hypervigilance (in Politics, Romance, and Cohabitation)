[Verse 1]
You came through town in an old Jeep
Looking like 1997
Won a few hearts with a bold speech
Talking 'bout let's go find the weapons
Talking 'bout let's be good again
And looking like all niggas ever wanted oh
Big time bank hand wins again
We get a new name plate but they own the Office
Feels so good when we go to auction
Four year lease with a low deposit
Get a hundred loans so you can go to college
Your diploma's rolled into a polish sausage
Umpteenth time we believe the theater
Wished upon a piece of meteor
While the greediest men, they needed disguise
But here's a news flash: the media lies
Dang

[Hook]
I've seen it all, I've seen it all
Shoulda known, shoulda known (x2)

[Verse 2]
How long was you pent up
Your little pinch of defense sucks
You was an early bird to the 33rd
But that certain word was you tensed up
And I know cause I'm watching too close
Like a type-2 dude with food with mad glucose
Hark! who goes there? I'm centurian
I'd be curious as my caesarian section
Alas shit look mysterious
Inside-quakes coulda shook the pyramids
Searching between all the Cushion areas
I warned you I wish you took me serious
Deleterious been dropping facts
They got co-conspirators so watch your back
And I'm paranoid so you can not relax
And I never holla so don't holla back

[Hook]

[Verse 3] (x2)
You put some shit in my mashed potatoes
The list of suspects is just you
You put a scratch on my Masekela
Put a tiny rock on my left shoe
Put smelly shit on my car keys
Sticky shit in my Arizona
Shrunk my shirt so the arms squeeze
Hid my miniature Testarossa
