[Intro: Open Mike Eagle]
I hear you talkin' 'bout who you wanna be
But you not goin' nowhere without me
I hear you talkin' 'bout who you wanna be
But you ain't goin' nowhere without me

[Verse 1: Serengeti]
(Uh) Bipolar
A-are you missing out on Miami Beach?
There's beautiful people on blogs
Why you sitting about on microwaved hotdogs, dogs, dogs?
Tied to the job for a weekend, shit he feel great
Feel great like the [?] the educated ape, alas, alas
Pick up a baguette, alas, alas
Not isolated on the internet
It's all for you
Bipolar like a loose screw
Nervous, Miami Beach, body, nervous urges
Shoulda jogged, feel all flabby
Act crabby, Friday night Miami on Ice
Look at his teeth, look at his beats
It looks painful, people look at him, it's shameful
(Shit) That's not nice, that's not nice, that's not sweet
Everybody needs beats, everybody needs rest
Everybody needs everything at least, yes! (Okay, okay!)
Shit (Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
Oh
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, let's go)

[Outro: Serengeti, Open Mike Eagle]
(Shit) Stupid-ass motherfucker
Get yo' ass in gear with the Governor
You ain't never seen shit before, sucka
Heard about your sorry-ass story from your lover
Heard about you being tender
I'ma get yo' monkey-ass [?]
Stupid-ass, goofy-ass bald fucker
Get yo' ass in gear with the Governor
You ain't never seen shit before, sucka
Heard your stupid-ass story from your bro
(I hear you talkin' 'bout who you wanna be)
I don't give a fuck about you being tender
Get yo' monkey ass [?]
(But you ain't goin' nowhere without me)
I'm a ice cold, steel-ass winter
(I hear you talkin' 'bout who you wanna be)
You a motherfuckin' fake pretender
You a motherfuckin' fake pretender
(But you ain't goin' nowhere without me)
I don't give a fuck about you being tender
You a motherfuckin' fake pretender
(I hear you talkin' 'bout who you wanna be)
I'm a motherfuckin' cold-ass, steel winter
You a motherfuckin' fake pretender
(But you ain't goin' nowhere without me)
You a motherfuckin' fake preâ€”
Get yo' ass in gear with the Governor!
(I hear you talkin' 'bout who you wanna be)
Get yo' ass in gear with the Governor!
You ain't never seen shit before, sucka!
(But you ain't goin' nowhere without me)
