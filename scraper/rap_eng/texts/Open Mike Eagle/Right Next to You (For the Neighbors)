[Hook]
I think I had a home
But I was told that we were stoned[?]
Now I've got no land of my own
And so I live right
I live right next to you

You want to know
Which parts of my world I haven't shown
I would invite you to my home
But it wouldn't feel right
I live right next to you

[Verse]
Yo, I'm not a straight-A student
I'm not a big gray space mutant
My world ain't the dark side of mercury
The currency isn't Miami bass music

I'm not from a doomed megalopolis
I don't sleep in a tomb/sarcophagus
My mother ain't a moonchild
My daddy didn't travel via rocket ship

I didn't jump through a stargate
I'm not gonna front like I'm Scarface
I don't glorify stupid shit
My moms got arrested in a car chase

I grew up in the crack years
And I hope they never come back here
In my class kids overdosed
But I was in the back reading Blackbeard

Yeah, I lived in the projects
All types of bullshit surrounded me
But that's not a parallel universe
This shit is just down the street

This isn't war correspondence
The conflict isn't far away
We all know where the battle is
We all know that is hard to say

[Hook]
You can't see my skin and bones
Cause I don't speak in human tones
And I'm never gonna keep up with the Jones'
Even though I live right
I live right next to you

Pick in my soul
And pick my coach[?] up 'til it's gone
But I'm gonna get back what I'm owed
So you just sit tight
I live right next to you

I had a home
But I was told that we were stoned[?]
Now I've got no land of my own
And so I live right
I live right next to you

You want to know
Which parts of my world I haven't shown
I would invite you to my home
Even though it's midnight
Cause I live right next to you
