[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
I've had the same phone number for a decade
And various phone models strapped next to my left leg
My first power-up was a flip phone
And I could feel the power moving up through my hip bone
Yeah, I got a lady and I dance with her
I'm happy to see her, but what she feels is my transmitter
My antenna span's killin'
I'm all full of data like a Spiderman villain
I'm part flesh and part energy
The last text I sent you was from the heart literally
Taking flights it gets really really deep
I put myself on airplane mode and go to sleep
Between my cell phone, router, computer and solar radiation
My body's full of information

[Hook: Open Mike Eagle]
YEEEEEAH (I HAVE THE POWERRRR)
My body's full of information!

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
And I don't need a lawyer
Every time I make a call I get a centimeter taller
Yeah, I'm in the skies like the white god
Motherfuck your Spotify, my mind is an iPod
Both of my feets is iPads really
And this hand here's an iPad Mini
And this other hand is an old Wired magazine
When I pass gas it sounds like a fax machine
I be thinking of secret shit then deleting it
My mind's on the internet, if I speak it I'm tweeting it
A lawsuit, some people want to start one
But I got super powers so I'm like no harm done
I'm a thousand feet tall, I don't need no litigation
My body's full of information

[Hook: Open Mike Eagle]
YEEEEEAH
My body's full of information!

[Verse 3: Kool A.D.]
What's a computer, man? I don't even know what that is
I don't even watch TV, what's Catfish?
Don't know much about science book, never read the atlas
My raps run laps around tracks like Pistorius
Wonder how he finna do the new Harlem Shake at the wake
Two-eighths figure skate on the lake
If I fake I'mma jake, if I lie I'mma die
I clean up and look fly in a tie
If you're lost, I'mma find you
Time after time I am the slime, dime after dime
Jukebox money dance, dumbbob funnypants
Run god, dunny got a gun in the underpants
Hit the red grass, do the thunder dance
Take a peek under that, run tell shunder that
Somebody run me down the basic premise of Thundercats
It seems somehow relevant to the conversation
Kid's so high, he didn't know how to play the Playstation
Live life on a day to day basis
It pays to stay amazingly vaporless
Gaze into the ways I stay yapered, ya bish, ya bish, ya bish
