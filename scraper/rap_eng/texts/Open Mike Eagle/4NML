The truth is your thought and not what you said
Cause language is prison for whats in your head
The thought is a mountain of matter
The word is a shred of whats in your head I said
The truth isnt guilty or innocence pled
Language is prison for whats in your head
The thoughts and the feelings are living the symbols are dead
The symbols are simple

Hear me hear me hear me clearly
Disappear you cheery weird things
Silly god-fearing eery dreary golemns
Bout to strip the gears from your steering column
Periodically empty feedbags
Feather dust the brain must defrag
Kill the cheap ass hiss on your tape recorders
Can't fight transitions with tanks and mortars
Or troop formations with ranks and orders
No borders landlocked peninsula
This is not for your grandfathers band of brothers
New land discovered, maps not the territrory
Cause everything said is a fairy tale
A story told from someone’s glory hole
Boring old facts with injected flavor
All the good metdata’s reflected later

The truth is your thought and not what you said
Cause language is prison for whats in your head
The thought is a mountain of matter
The word is a shred of whats in your head I said
The truth isnt guilty or innocence pled
Language is prison for whats in your head
The thoughts and the feelings are living the symbols are dead
The symbols are simple

Cyrano de bergerac to observe the facts
Cause our everyday words are flat
As the earth in a dark aged almanac
Dissolve the facts in passion
Exaggerated actions
Massive men and yellow-eyed dragons
No bad skin and idiosyncrasies
I hear the sound is the video synced?
Repeat the phrase again it should be the same right
The night’s allure obscured by the daylight
Aim right into the dark for missed marks
It starts as a word and turns into a spark that’s absurd
It merges with all of the urges within
That lurk in your skin
Reversing the purpose again
And then its a circus experience worthless
Until its a verse that a serious serpent can spin
When you’re all alone you are an animal
The words i’m saying now mean nothing more than
Meow to an animal
When you’re all alone you are the cat you are the phone
You are an animal
The words im saying now mean nothing more than
Meow to an animal

We live in a thousand dimensions
How is it condensed in the tension of time
How do the characters written on a line
Help you get an image of the vision in my mind
How is it combined
Designed
Alligned
When it is confined
Like a human limited divine
We can only see three sides
The reverse side bottom and the top side hide
Just out of view
Beyond our six senses but true
The devil’s in the details
God’s in the clue
Amused
Removed
We choose
To focus on hues that are broken and bruised
Cause we are open to choose
An alternate frequency

The truth is your thought and not what you said
Cause language is prison for whats in your head
The thought is a mountain of matter
The word is a shred of whats in your head I said
The truth isnt guilty or innocence pled
Language is prison for whats in your head
The thoughts and the feelings are living the symbols are dead
The symbols are simple

When you’re all alone you are the cat you are the phone
You are an animal
The words im saying now mean nothing more than
Meow to an animal
