[Verse 1: Milo]
I can be the Ubermensch
Presently ensconced in a thick, thick loser's stench
Let's use only the future tense
My collective is unconscious though
Yeah, I can't forget when they auctioned us
Brown boy king, red crown glows phosphorus
Young Jung, bump Sun Kil Moon
Wearing toe socks, I've got hymnals for the know-nots
On tour and I'm weary of the dinginess
Tag my name in the Codex Seraphinianus
In Chicago bleeding in a back alley
An olive tree thrives somewhere in the Napa Valley
Oh boy, I'm a big fucking moron
IMDB searched life advice from Ghost Dog
Usher in a new era of raps post-Herzog
This is just desserts for an old slob, bow

[Hook: Nick Diamonds]
First one to take it (I've been slippin')
Last one to make it (I've been slippin')
At calling time but I can't, head vacant
It's another one of mine

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Yo, yo, people talk to me at their saddest
It gets fairly overwhelming for my secretary Gladys
She prefer to only deal with my earnest business proposals
So she patently refuses all the passwords to my socials
She once happened on a message from an older friend from college
Who would like to end her crisis by drinking furniture polish
I said, "Gladys, this one's simple, she just needs someone to listen"
Said she wasn't trained or paid enough for suicide prevention
Plus the reason people seek you when they can't hold it together
Is cause you seem to find the right words without too much sweat or effort
There ain't no Dr. Lecter, Dr. Scholls or Dr. Pepper
Got a lady and a kid and I gotta make these stupid records
Something's missing from this picture
Ain't none of these people worried about who listens to the listeners
Gladys told me, "Tell 'em fuck off if they such a waste of time"
I never told her that depressed account was another one of mine
