(Da-da, da-da, da da)

[Verse 1]
So don't be mad at me
I used to breathe asthmatically
No strategy for whenever brain
Gets going, counting the stars through the growing pains
Shoulder blame
For the bill, take a sugar pill
Over the counter drugs, the ones niggas couldn't feel
Like the wooden wheel
Ben switched the island with
Arms stretched
Head high like a lion sit
Yeah, I'm trying to get it
But where did it go
Under 10 inches of that lake-effect snow
But I'ma do whatever it takes, so let's go
Let's go to the projects, let's go to the moon
Shout to Aes Rock for calling out my spoons
Shout to hip hoppers I met in high school
Y'all saved my life Thursday afternoons

[Chorus]
(This goes out to the)
Ghetto children, making codewords
In the projects around the world
Ghetto children, fighting dragons
In the projects around the world

[Verse 2]
Don't overlook it though
You gotta know what you couldn't know
Yeah I'm good to gone, head scrutinize
Put your gloves on and dig for a new surprise
It might be supersized, use all your muscles
Get in front of the groove just like a hustle, improve
The fightin' scuffle, stay sharp for the moment
I rhyme for survival so the art is a bonus
I was sparked into motion back when Carson was hosting
Everything is better when you don't know nothing
I'm grown so I'm always disgusted
All these discussions online is mayonnaise versus mustard
Mayonnaise people think French can't be trusted
Mustard people think eggs is all busted
But fuck it
We in it for the pattern interruptions

[Chorus]
(This goes out to the)
Ghetto children, hacking networks
In the projects around the world
Ghetto children, splicing cables
In the projects around the world

[Verse 3]
So don't be mad at me
I overthink things radically
King tragedy
Prince everlong
Never shake up my eight-ball cause it's never wrong
I sing whatever song I damn well please
Vintage 5deez or tempted by squeeze
My dispensaryâ€™s closed and I meant to buy weed
I'm salty at the airport in security
Tragic is the story of the cookie face king
Long black trench on the roof like Sting
Pointing bats at my enemies let it be known
Pull up at the show hitting every orange cone
I park where I want but I cry if I'm towed
I don't really know where it's right to buy clothes
Unregulated labor made all that I own
Can I make an impact if I strike the right tone
And keep saying words into microphones
It goes

[Chorus]
Ghetto children, solving problems
In the projects around the world
