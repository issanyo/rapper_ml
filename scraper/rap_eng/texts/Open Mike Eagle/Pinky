[Intro: Serengeti & Open Mike Eagle]
Jeans soaked
Legs soaked
Sticky-ass legs soaked
Wet-ass denim
Looking pretty-ass pinky
Looking pretty-ass motherfucking pinky
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
Everyone call me Pinky
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
(Da da-da, da-da-da da)

[Verse 1: Serengeti & Open Mike Eagle]
Start again, try anew
Move out South too
Left my boo
Left my glue
Out there Memphis
Look at pretty-ass dentist
He a pretty-ass motherf-- fuck (yeah, yeah)
Ay!

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
I ain't never met nobody like you
But I'm a asshole and you a asshole too
Don't nobody wanna know the shit you do
Don't nobody wanna sit and think about you
Leave me fuck alone and do what you choose
I'ma sit here and I'ma motherfuckin'--
I'ma write a song and I don't know why
I'ma see the neighbors and I won't say hi
I'ma eat this cookie, it's gon' get me high

[Bridge: Serengeti & Open Mike Eagle]
(Motherfucker)
Legs all sticky
(Hungry-ass dude)
Everybody call me Pinky
(Left my boo)
Everybody call me Pinky
(Jeans all soaked)
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
Yeah
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
(Ba-da da da, da-da-da da)

[Verse 3: Serengeti]
Practice my whimsy, become the next Herb Dean
Sometimes in rapping, man, you start to lose steam
Plane trips and towns don't seem as interesting
After night's over, start ask yourself some questions
Green bean and spinach, green fern eyes
Lurker, them cats got the women
While you at the crib
Blending into a bed, berserker
Merging, the whole thing
I ain't got a job and I ain't really working

[Bridge: Serengeti & Open Mike Eagle]
(Legs soaked)
Just sittin'
(Jeans soaked)
Turnin' into a victim, shit
(Denim jeans soaked, hat soaked)
Turnin' into a stove
(Shirt soaked)
(Ba da da da-da da da)
Shirt soaked
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
Pretty-ass
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
Pretty-ass gold rope
(Da da-da, da-da-da da)
Pretty-ass

[Verse 4: Open Mike Eagle]
I don't wanna fight and I don't want no truce
I'm down with nobody and I got no juice
I'm chewing on my teeth and they all feel loose
I'm feeling kinda good but I got no proof
I'm feeling kinda good that it makes me scared
'Cause if I don't care, does it mean I'm dead?
I'm dead, then a motherfucker, all night long
Go and talk shit 'cause it just makes me--

[Outro: Serengeti & Open Mike Eagle]
Everybody call me Pinky
My real name's Daryl
My real name's Daryl
Everybody call me Pinky
(Ba da da da-da da da)
Pretty-ass motherfucker
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
Get yo' ass in gear with the Governor
(Ba-da da da da-da da da)
Motherfucker said
(Da da-da, da-da-da da)
Sorry-ass
Jeans soaked, legs soaked
Hands soaked, jeans soaked
Belt soaked, legs soaked
Legs soaked
Practice my whimsy, become the next Herb Dean
Sometimes in rapping, man, you start to lose steam
