[Verse 1: Serengeti]
You're not taking food off my table
I owe two hundred grand in back taxes
I just wanna see you on your mattress
Eat your food and watchin' your actions
Look at your cable, touchin' your navel
Take you out dancing, after that, bagel
Got you a gift from the trunk of my Sable
But you're not taking food off my table

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Heart of Darkness, extra nothing
I don't know combos, I'm pressing buttons
Accept what I'd get, question nothing
Except for myself when I'm high with you
Listen to myself breathe through my nasal
Nice and clean, we smell the witch-hazel
Why ask why, the lie's so graceful
Leave the WOOP book on the coffee table

[Verse 3: Serengeti]
Cuz you're not taking food from my table
I just spent two G's on these glasses
Wake up in the morning, I can see your cactus
Wish you good luck as you try to actress
Watching your cable from your mattress
Bring me a cup so I can tip on my ashes
Got you a gift in the trunk of my table
You're not taking food from my Sable

[Verse 4: Open Mike Eagle]
Brand new questions, old dimensions
R.C. Pro-Am, Pole Position
Donnie Simpson, Julie Brown
Celebrity skin tags move around
I'm inventive, this island isn't
So find which mind designed this kitchen
Clear my sinus, hear my silence
Don't trust fingers near my eyelids

[Verse 5: Serengeti]
Had this one chick, but she would not listen
Went to the bank all my money was missin'
Supposed to pay my tax, but she went out dancing
Played me for the fool, I was still romancing
So you're not taking food from my table
I just wanna see you on your mattress
Bring me a cloth so I can wipe my glasses
Pop that trunk I can give you them bagels

[Verse 6: Open Mike Eagle]
I might lose it, truly let go
Kick the train door and sue the metro
Buy new software and do electro
And start to feel weird 'cause I'm too successful
Buy my book though, buy my house
I clear out next week and fly right out
Book it now, my funds are unstable
Ain't no books hide under that table
