[Verse 1]
Black Tom got style, Erik can pull shit
Got a brother named Charles that be on that bullshit
I protect my neck with some magical jewels
And can't none of y'all can take 'em from me, yeah, yeah
In Cortez 'cause I feel like Fabian
My fit got a head like the dome of a stadium
You think it's all good but it's a really a gradient
Bag of Now and Laters and a Clearly Canadian, yeah
Don't turn away from me, look in my eyeholes
My brother got heart but he running with psychos
He always got a gang with him, hella disciples
They always tryna fight though but I stay cool
I can't lose no argument, I got my jewels
I keep my head down, pushing like I'm walking to school, yeah
I hold em tight like Infinity Gems
Police men looking at me like I'm finna be him, no
My daddy is a hard man, my mother’s a ghost
I keep my head covered or my brother will roast
And y'all fucking with my head with thoughts tougher than jokes
I ran hard, my footprints covered the coast
I be running through walls cause I'm buffer than most
A Nightcrawler tried to creep, I smell sucker's approach
He see I'm all charged, he get what he provoked
The homie Tom got powers so I'm tugging his cloak yeah

[Chorus]
I'm big as hell, I can't fit in my fit, my sleeves ripped
I'm a king so my ring is legit
I bring shit to your front door, ringing your bell
My eyes glow in my hood like a demon from hell
My old self locked away, no key to the cell
They shooting spells at my head, it's up to me to repel (yeah)
(one two, one two)
Ain't nothing gonna stop me now
Ain't nothing gonna stop me now (now now now now now now)
Ain't nothing gonna stop me

[Verse 2]
My big dumb brain’s an electrical ocean
Started walking, now my legs in perpetual motion
Can't stop, can't stop, but I'm not just boasting
I had to 'cause home’s overcome by roaches, yeah
I got swole 'cause I wanted revenge
My brother Charles got hurt when we was playing pretend
Started walking right then, just me and the wind
That asshole better hope I never see him again, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm big as hell, I can't fit in my fit, my sleeves ripped
I'm a king so my ring is legit
I bring shit to your front door, ringing your bell
My eyes glow in my hood like a demon from hell
My old self locked away, no key to the cell
They shooting spells at my head, it's up to me to repel (yeah)
Ain't nothing gonna stop me now
Ain't nothing gonna stop me now
Ain't nothing gonna stop me

[Verse 3]
Black Tom got style, Erik can pull shit
Got a brother named Charles that be on that bullshit
I protect my neck with some magical jewels
And can't none of y'all can take 'em from me, yeah
Can't none of y'all can take 'em from me, yeah
Can't none of y'all can take 'em from me, yeah
Can't none of y'all can take 'em from me, yeah
Can't none of y'all can take 'em from me, yeah, yeah
