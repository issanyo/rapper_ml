[Hook]
This is normal, it's normal now
(They said it's) Normal, it's normal, it's normal now
(They said it's) Normal, it's normal now
(They said it's) Normal, it's normal, it's normal now

Everybody get involved
It's holiday in the wasteland
Quit tripping y'all
It's holiday in the wasteland

[Verse 1]
(One-two, one-two.)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When the king is a garbage person
I might wanna lay down and die
Power down all my darkest urges
Keep my personal crown up high
I'm the king of my lonely island
Home is high they can't reach my house
I put out all the garbage fires
Squeeze the cider right in my mouth
Everything is not ordinary
Things begin and then have to die
Everything that's been dead and buried
It ain't supposed to come back alive
Now we all in a zombie movie
Only weapon is common sense
Zombie sheriffs is tryna to lynch us
Guess I'll call up my congressmen
Pick a day for a celebration
Make a circle on Halloween
Party under your pile of garbage
Can't see out then just follow me
When the king is a garbage person
I might wanna lay down and die
Power down all my darkest urges
Keep my personal crown up high

[Pre-Chorus]
One day without violence
No bombs, no gunshots
Can we get one day without fear
No sirens, no lights
Can we get one day they don't try us?
No bombs, no gunshots
Just like one day the whole year
No violence, no fights
Can the people get one day without violence
No bombs, no gunshots
Can we get one day without fear
No sirens, no lights
Can we get one day they don't try us?
No bombs, no gunshots
Just like one day the whole year
No violence, no fights

[Hook]
Everybody get involved, it's holiday in the wasteland
Quit tripping y'all, it's holiday in the wasteland

This is normal, it's normal now
(They said it's) Normal, it's normal, it's normal now
(They said it's) Normal, it's normal now
(They said it's) Normal, it's normal, it's normal now

[Verse 2]
I was protesting I lost my sign
Standing up cause they crossed my line
Gathered folks and they caught my vibe
If it wasn't for y'all I would've lost my mind
Long season I need this night
Fuel’s low so we reignite
Power’s out so we read by light
No cops allowed they can't read my rights
Power’s out no electro now
Synthesizers all retro sound
First directive's protect your town
Tell the garbage king "we don't respect your crown"
Generator, we back online
No bullshit, we don't have no time
Storm the castle, that flag don't fly
Say fuck the king til that asshole die
Fuck the king, no command, no chief
Since the man was crowned we ain't had no sleep
Dare the man to put hands on me
Or sovereign land that I stand on, B
Protesting I lost my sign
Standing up cause they crossed my line
Gathered folks and they caught my vibe
If it wasn't for y'all I would've lost my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
One day without violence
No bombs, no gunshots
Can we get one day without fear
No sirens, no lights
Can we get one day they don't try us?
No bombs, no gunshots
Just like one day the whole year
No violence, no fights
Can the people get one day without violence
No bombs, no gunshots
Can we get one day without fear
No sirens, no lights
Can we get one day they don't try us?
No bombs, no gunshots
Just like one day the whole year
No violence, no fights

[Hook]
Everybody get involved, it's holiday in the wasteland
Quit tripping y'all, it's holiday in the wasteland

[Outro]
I remember people
I’d like to get to know em
Its kinda like my brain is closed
But my heart is open
Maybe my heart is broken
A comet slammed into the planet
Then it parted oceans
I even started smoking
But then I quit the smoking
I still dream of deep breathing and my lips is open
I'm coming into focus
I used to practice trying to talk like I was Mr. Bogus
I bet a lot of lonely people think of kissing posters
