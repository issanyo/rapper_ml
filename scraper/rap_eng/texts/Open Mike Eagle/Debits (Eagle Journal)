[Verse]
You used to count on jesus
Then ran out of fingers
Purple mountain magic
Costs a million dollars
And they don't take paypal
And my credit's ruined
Graduated college
Like a fucking moron
Signed an application
They gave me some plastic
And some funny glasses
Spent it at McDonald's
Like the one in WalMart
Or the student center
Pretty close to where they
Put out the applications

[Chorus]
And they don't run away
They go hide on the internet
And wait
