[Verse]
All the party people still asleep
I'm tip toeing trying not to make a peep
Put the TV on low then I take a seat
The party's over, I wish I could stay a week
They knocked out early, how I stay awoke
My dream boat's broken, now they stay afloat
My dream car's broken and I need a lift
And how much Hennessy? Do you plead a fifth?
A loose  narrative and not quite a plot
I put it in the oven 'til it's nice and hot
I cook it 'til it's something that I like a lot
Then try to skip it on the water like a rock
And I've been sleep through all of it, I'm still amazed
A thirty year hypnosis and it's still a haze
They left me in the living room to chill for days
It's time for me to overthink a million ways
I wanna open up a skull, but why?
I'll just be a mix of Martin Mull and Plies
So you can sleep 'til sleepy people multiply
Nobody ever listens to a lullaby

[Outro] (x4)
Play fair, stay there
