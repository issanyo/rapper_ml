I'm sorry

Eric I'm sorry I spazzed in front of those battle nerds
After the judges said you won I tugged your mustache afterwards
VerBS I really should have advertised your pedicab
Regan I'm sorry I get haircuts that you've already had
James I'm sorry for judging the word bitch in your rap hooks
And when we went on tour I never let you use my MacBook
I'm sorry for mumbling, I record with my mouth dry
And Alph guy I'm sorry I didn't take you to South by
I'm a big fool, Milo you're my touring homie shit's cool
Apologies to your parents they hate it when you miss school
Taurus I'm sorry for holding beats in that folder
So Regan had to ask you for them shits over and over
I don't deserve such nice pals, big shout to my wife now
Cause she home with my kid right now, bet his crazy ass is on time-out
