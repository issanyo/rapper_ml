[Intro]
Note the trees cause the dirt is temporary
More to mine than fact face Name and monetary
Beat the skins and let the loose lips kiss you clean
Quietly pour out like light, Like light when answering
Cross the street from the storefront cemetery
Hear me hailing from inside and realize Iâ€¦

[Hook 1]
May the universe strengthen my character
So when it's deep I can be a submariner
Hope I never have to keep me a derringer
Cause I would challenge everybody like I'm Aaron Burr

[Verse 1]
If you see me wearin' ferret fur
And a herringbone
Wearing cologne
Made of grizzly bear pheromones
I fell victim to the smell of the marigolds
Disregard what I yell in my baritone
Let alone falsetto
I'm nervous in the booth hittin' notes all ghetto
Trying to hit that next so-called level
But my flow talk tastes like a low salt pretzel
(And my Mohawk's special)
It's an excellent punk aesthetic
But mine's orange
So the rest of 'em lump together
Ask Vibe, I'm the best of the sunken treasure
Right next to Kid Fresh and his hunting feathers

[Hook 2]
May the universe strengthen my character
So I can handle any props that my merit earns
I can walk my own road without careless turns
And never follow and holler 'til my larynx burns

[Verse 2]
Rocked from Paris to Harrisburg
And all the hairpin turns in between
The biggest nerd on the scene
Since the emergence of Ween
Immersed in detergent
I'm clean but I surf in the dirtiest ravines
With courteous thirty-somethings at grown folks' functions
Got Tone Loc bumping
Sipping funky cold medine
We never learned to do the shoulder lean
Or the super soaker thing
We're more in tune with what they doing over seas
Than this music for the teens
We do know what it means
With the constant junior rumors
On my new computer screen
Young famous do your thing
To the nation you're a king
But don't expect the older generations to agree
