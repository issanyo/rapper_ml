[Verse 1]
Writing on the floor of a Chinese restaurant
Crown on my hip like Simon Petrikov
Thought of a song called 'Thinking of Master Plans'
Reagan and Rakim drinking in Amsterdam
Cafe back room meeting with cancer man
Engineering project black astronaut
The first scene in the film Prometheus
I wrote a brand new story that starts from there
Just need some help with the financing
I ain't got nobody to pitch it to

[Hook]
My friends are superheros
None of us have very much money though
They can fly, run fast, read Portuguese
None of us have very much money though
They know judo and yoga, photography, politics
Some of them leap over buildings
Writers, magicians, comedians, astronauts
None of it mattered when niggas was hungry
My friends are superheros
None of us have very much money though
They wear the same underwear as billionaires
None of us have very much money though
Hustlers, beatmakers, drug dealers, sculptors
Ego-maniacal authors and bloggers
Some of them talk to the animals
None of it mattered when niggas was hungry


[Bridge]
That shit's not valuable
Come say it to my face
That shit's not valuable
Come say it to my face
It's all disposable
Come say it to my face

[Verse 2]
I was hoping this device might cure my remembering
I'm eighty-seven percent sure I invented it
High adrenaline I'm rapping on the cake boss
Name on the dressing room, so I ain't lost
Commencing countdown takeoff
Another sound stage, rehearsing a fake space walk
Lil' Wayne is an ancient African
Jay-Z's been around since the 20s though
The only new ones is Lil' B and One Be Lo
We only got a hundred months to go
Until your hometown's covered under tons of snow
It goes one, two, three, four, five little Indians
When it's all over I survive on the Pentium
Chips, cinnamon flavored memory sticks
And I'll flash, take a picture
Cause I won't remember

[Bridge]
That shit's not valuable
Come say it to my face
That shit's disposable
Come say it to my face
It's not authentic though
Come say it to my face
That's so ingenuine
Come say it to my face

[Hook]
My friends are superheros
None of us have very much money though
They can fly, run fast, read Portuguese
None of us have very much money though
They can make hair grease out of fruits and herbs
None of us have very much money though
They can take selfies like Dubuffet
None of us have very much money though
