[Intro]
I have never performed this ritual before
I'm going to do my, my very best
I’m going to read it as it, as it is stated here

[Verse 1]
Sign an autograph and sell it to your own self
Cause this a pageant, sing my anthem 'til your bones melt
It's engaged and it spans the entire globe
A big pigeon in a beanie in a choir robe
From a taxiderm bird on your fireplace
Just say the word and we emerge on your fire escape
And cookie-face vision half-blurred on a higher state
Confident, I keep my password on my licence plate
And I could teleport, we know the mirror arts
So fear the magic, it can tear your whole gear apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Your generation’s been cursed, what that trauma do
Our nametag says "Stop, look what I've been through"
We a pack of 500 black presidents
We the Bulls triple-seven magnificent
With no authority and self-written etiquette
A flag made of mirrors, bubba I'm you, I'm you

[Chorus]
We is not a gang, we all look the same as you
But don't be ashamed, we all make the same snafu
We got different names, we might get the same tattoo
Maybe it's a gang, maybe it became that too

[Verse 2]
Yes, be polite, but beg no pardon, no
It's made of cookie-king dough on Mario
Then we laugh, the whole staff half-Byzantine
With mathematics, protractors, a chicken wing
And Mario has got my face looking silly, kid
A princess is in a whole different pyramid

[Pre-Chorus]
A generation's been cursed, what that trauma do
Our nametag says "Stop, look what I’ve been through"
We a pack of 500 black elephants (Black elephants!)
We the Bulls triple-seven magnificent (If you want!)
With no authority and self-written etiquette (Yeah!)
The flag made of mirrors, bubba I’m you, I'm you

[Chorus]
We is not a gang, we all look the same as you (Introducing!)
We don’t be ashamed, we done made the same snafu (The 1993 Chicago Bulls!)
We got different names, we might get the same tattoo
Maybe it's a gang, maybe it became that too
We is not a gang, we all look the same as you (You're in it, you got tricked! You're in it now!)
We don’t be ashamed, we done made the same snafu
We got different names, we might get the same tattoo (As soon as the song goes off, you have been initiated!)
Maybe it's a gang, maybe it became that too
