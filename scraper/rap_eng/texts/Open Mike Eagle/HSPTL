[Verse 1]
I'd forgotten that we're all the same
That our differences are all a game
That were all like the super friends
So every loser has a future win
I had fell for the okie doke
Lost my control like, "holy smokes"
(gosh darn it)
I really said worse than that
I wish I could take the curses back
I had spoke from a frequency
That was pretty low
I bet you folks would agree with me
But when I thought it was impossible
Somebody brought me to the hospital

[Verse 2]
I kept two feet in a cup of booze
To try to stay above the blues
That color's unnatural
A result of personal subterfuge
I had the let the bottle go
Im tryin to be a role model, bro
I was such a piss-poor example then
Except for what not to do
If I had a rap check to spend
I'd go buy a big rare cockatoo
I thought I was responsible
Then they brought me to the hospital

[Hook x2]
Wherever I sit today
In front or against the wall
I can accept it all
No matter which-a way
Wherever I sit today
Ima make a motherfucking throne

[Verse 3]
I used to be so jealous-hearted
"How'd he get such a swell apartment?"
Look at me counting other people's fans
Instead of tryin to be a better eagleman
I even hated on my own friends
Turnin' up my nose with a clothespin
Like pee-you
In my head I had to make em wack
Luckily I came a long way from that
What kind of pal was I
Leaving all those downloaded files to die?
Now I'm bumping all these tracks
And given em good honest feedback
(cause thats, thats what I would want)
It's like there was two of me
My true motivations hid beautifully
A public face and a shadowed man
A dirty ship with a clean cut capitan
Foolin all my damn passengers
Tellin them we're still on this planet earth

[Hook x2]
Wherever I sit today
In front or against the wall
I can accept it all
No matter which-a way
Wherever I sit today
I'mma make a motherfucking throne

It smells like rain again
Fresh dew beads on the wet lawn
How many sundays have I seen?
How many blades of grass have I stepped on?
My old friend used to walk barefoot
Until the bottom of her feet looked silver
Close to where the shaw meets wilshire
I used to think she was a lunatic
Now when I call she asks, who is this?
