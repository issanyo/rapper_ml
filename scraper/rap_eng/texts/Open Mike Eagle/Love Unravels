[Verse 1: Beige]
I hate to say it, but I must admit I miss you
Through these failing seems I can see my muscle tissue
Shiny red corduroy gleams and then it flexes
Same as it did when I squeezed the one I shared my bed with
I didn't know that I was built with flimsy stitches
They all dissolved a little at the moment that we finished
I grip the picture frame and stroke the broken image
The glass severs the thread that holds together all my fingers
As this love unravels, atop my heads an apple
Try to hit it cupid, you're clearly out of practice
I'm a scarecrow, composed of tattered fabric
Coming apart at the seams, trying not to panic
I'm merely afraid that I might
Deteriorate until I
Become an invisible life-
Form and dissipate into the sky
Or, spontaneously cease to exist
Not even a trace of microscopic evidence

[Hook]
What's at the core when I'm unraveled?
All's fair in love and battle
Do what you have to

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Next up, director action
Swept up the ashes
Camera pans up, it's trackin'
Actor's neck up, reaction
What has or hasn't happened
Guess what, it's tragic as it
Cuts back to where he was standin'
Left us, it's magic
Independent or codependent, limited distribution
Lead actor has left the set direct actress is disillusioned
Yes it's the movie, disbelief suspended
Big weekend releases tend to release the tension
Features endin' Chinese theatre get your feet cemented
Let us be remembered

[Verse 3: Beige]
Tried to fit the thread through the needle but me shaky hands are sabotaging all of my attempts
Tried to come to terms with my decomposition but it wasn't something that I could accept
Time to repair, grab that steal
Pierce that skin, grab that feel
Hold that pain, hope that it heals
Glue that wound, that feels weird
Take my body, Frankenstein me
Sew me up like Watanabe
Sorry about the blood now the carpets soggy
I can regenerate like a starfish, homie

[Chorus]
