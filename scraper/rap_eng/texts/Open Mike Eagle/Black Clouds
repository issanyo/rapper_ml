[Verse 1 - Megabusive]
I'm vexed
Off the generational disconnect
Differences and introspect
Go unbalanced, unchecked
The wet get reckless and the set goes unprotected
Take one of these and meet me at the nexus
We speak for the unaccounted for and openly neglected
Open Mike Eagle and Megabusive are for the kids
Purposes served with astute turf nerdiness
While the world keeps learning us, bookworm burliness
Avoiding negative attitudes and over-assertiveness
And open-endedly thank you for perjurists and colonialists
I'm a rapper not a vocalist
Trying to show the world what a hometown hopeful is
Thank you for scoping us

[Hook - Finiki McGee]
He's all smiles
But the devil got soul
Raise up the flagpole
Let them niggas know
You got beef, well, welcome to the show
You can enter the arena but you've got to pay a toll
You don't ask twice, only take gold
Think this shit don't run on just blood, tears and dro
You've been warned
Like night, we come and go
So if you see them black clouds, oh no

(You don't ask twice)

(You been warned)

[Verse 2 - Open Mike Eagle]
I smell heaven's bread
Thirteen kids, but eleven's fed
We the offspring of the hungry pair
No drawstrings on my underwear
Y'all's king does a lot of talking
No sword but lord, what a golf swing
All the small things
Germs in the food gave me aspergers
The only one I respect is the Hamburglar
We hack and crack servers
Stole the OS from your binary
New world order, huh
We're all one...
Finally

[Hook - Finiki McGee]

[Verse 3 - Finiki Mcgee]
It's all bad but you kinda wanna try
Wouldn't stare too hard
Baby could bust up in your eye
What feels good can make you laugh or make you cry
Kiss your wishful snake eyes, roll up on my dice
Blow up on my, blow up on my
We watch the value fall swiftly to the knees
All full of hot air now the nigga don't breathe
We laugh about it then we toast over drinks
Lightning from the heavens ain't gonna strike these
