[Intro: Uncommon Nasa]
I can't shake this feeling
It's like, when I go to sleep
I might wake up
And then it's all gonna be gone

[Non-lyrical vocalizing: Barrie McLain]

[Verse 1: Uncommon Nasa]
I wish I could really stop focusing
[? 0:22]
In real life I got bills to pay
The fact that I do leaves me amazed
I live every day fearing a pink slip
[? 0:31]
I can name you every moving truck company
That existed from â€˜86 to '93
I have no memories of climbing trees
The fear of falling has led me to robbin' things
Paranoid and insecure
Not a fear of less but a fear of more
Thousand of tiny bubbles bursting
They give water but not enough for the thirsty
The glass is half empty once again
My life's a reservoir that I must upend
Who ever said that this was easy
You can't maintain a lifestyle by pushing
In place, in space, so in haste
Your face, your pace and your taste
Must grow to one day smash and grab
The thought of a man with a plan
That I'm glad to have

[Chorus: Uncommon Nasa & Barrie McLain]
Don't attack us
Create our backup
Don't know why I'm always scared
Scared of this plan and I'm aware
You can't have what's mine
It's what I've accrued over time
Don't know why I just can't rest
The time's so good that they just confess
