[Intro]
It's him who has the filthy fits x4
This is a RED WALL
This is the RED WALL
Turn back

[Bridge]
They say he move like
They say he move like light
X3

They say he move like light
They say he move like
They say he move like
Like Light

[Hook] x4
Wack motherfuckers always wanna redo
I'm smoking on my humble joint it's full of tree root

[Bridge] x5
They say he move like
They say he move like light

[Verse 1: milo]
I'm rapping in the attic of a square apartment
Felt like rapping in Madison Square Garden
And you were very happy to be there
Two feet perpendicular on your square
Proud and attentive, never loud and inventive
Your style's been incentivised with personalities
And app on this here mobile device
Spent your whole life overly nice
Buying mochas that are mostly ice
And overly priced

[Refrain] x3
Unfortunately for you, Red Wall is not a rap crew

[Hook] x3

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Nah homie, you gon have to show your dance papers
Ain't no room on this house boat for chance takers
Ain't no country for old hats with buckle-fronts
We make puzzle funk, fix flats with struggle pumps
I was befuddled once and never really recovered
Introduced to George Carlin as Mr. Conductor
I knew the magic word but chose to whisper another
My granny told my daddy "Don't split a sister and brother"
And so he didn't
It's looking snowy from the Kitchen
Heard the home girl say to the homie "Oh no he didn't"
Freezy freaky, toasty mittens
