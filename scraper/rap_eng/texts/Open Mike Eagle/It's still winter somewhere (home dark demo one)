[Verse 1]
My memory's photographic
I know those signs
No need for overthinking
We'll just turn blue
It's not in-ordinary
It's all the time
Get off that ceiling lady
You should sit down

[Hook]
You're not that kind of person
Given the situation
This is the right decision
This is the right decision
Given the situation
This is the right decision
This is the right decision

[Verse 2]
People evacuating
Pull the alarm
Hold on in one direction
All ran away
I see see that graven image
That makes things hard
I have an education
I know those lies

[Hook]
I'm not that kind of person
Given the situation
This is the right decision
This is the right decision
Given the situation
This is the right decision
This is the right decision
This is the right decision
