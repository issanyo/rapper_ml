[Hook]
My people come from stars
But not that far away
But y'all know who we are
There's really not much else to say

[Verse 1]
How you gonna race with a spaceman
Who walks with pride and grace through the wasteland
Do not attempt to embrace or shake hands
Unless you been blessed by Acey the Faceman
I'm from a place where the bass from the late jams
Snaps all the elastic and waist bands
And cracks through the plastic on raybans
Get your colorways dunked in a paint can
It ain't the funk if you can't dance
How you gonna front when you ranked last
Fuck a high class function with stank-ass snobs
My jobs getting drunk with the wait staff
Fuck a dunce from the late class
We in the lab with the bunsons that break glass
This is rap for the monks on the 8 paths
Those still getting crunk need a late pass

[Bridge x2]
When we were kids we would listen and believe
We had a need that felt like a sickness to go a long distance
To fuck with an emcee
No prescription if this is your disease

[Verse 2]
There's been a breach in the fortress
Nobody here speaks from the cortex
A leaked gem from the Swim Team
Is fiended for like tweak in the northwest
Not for real but it's getting there
I'm ice cold like the tap on your Frigidaire
I kick raps when kicks snap tremendous snare
Causes the big blap that pauses the click track
If you run outta gauze then get the gift rap
Don't talk tall then fall from the kickback
The Swim Team's big black walk-on
Kicking facts with mismatched socks on
Impact like this track with dropped bomb
Yell 'fuck yes' if you know what's next [fuck yes!]
Those still quiet are suspect
Butterflies in the belly stomach bubble upset

[Hook]
