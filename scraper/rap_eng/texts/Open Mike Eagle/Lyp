Oh you got a whiff of this
Bored on your business trip
Get it tatted on yo inner lip[x3]
Oh what is this shit
New niggas intricate
Get it tatted on yo inner lip[x3]

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Mother fucker I'm King Kong
Let these songs link your heart more
Far more than just memorizing the words
Learned the guitar chords
What defines my freeverse?
Justify my research
Make a how to Youtube video and
Of how you customizing my t-shirts (Yeah)
It's just so formfitting
His shirts baggy, but yours isn't
Some fools battle with bayonets
And my family crest is war kitten (Sweet)
They so thirsty that they hand squeezing those cantaloupes
DWTW we pouring that antidote
No candy coat and no grandiose
Of your circumstances was badly broken
Need new suspenders to you surrender
Complete control of your rap emotions
Shout out to my deviants
Keep reblogging that fan art
See yourself in my work
This is you watershed and your landmark
Every morning i wake up
And leap out from the tenth floor
Sign your name on this clip board cause
Your autograph is my ripcord

[Verse 3: Nietzsche Cortez]
Do you swear? If…
And if you wake up in a post DvT world
You ain’t gotta worry bout being on a list
Nietzche Cortez who I’m is only get
Whatchu need it come with me
If you really wanna live
I know your hearts in a bear hug
Cos of the feelings that chu get when you look at them in their love
‘Stead of singing them songs that Adele sung
Gettin sentimental 'bout a dude with the hair plug
Get your hair done, get your nail done
Go ahead and get the tattoo you were gonna get
But don’t forget to get the [inaudible] little emblem
Cos you only live once
It don’t matter where you end up
It’s your day
It’s your day
Girl dye your hair
Back to normal
Celebrate
Celebrate
The last day of your restraining order
Is it commitment or that your obsessed
To fall in love with someone that you never met?
But who’s to say that it isn’t love
If they just approved your friend request?
Do you follow to where they live?
Do you think that they’re interested?
Did you go through the front or back?
And did you leave any fingerprints?
On they’re fridge
In your blood
Write the vows of your wedding night
Girl I promise to be your alibi
Cos I know the strength of your sacrifice
Mikey knows you’re committed
Reagan knows you’re committed
