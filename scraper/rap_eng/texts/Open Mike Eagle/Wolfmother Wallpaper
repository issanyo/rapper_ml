[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
This is the room with the Wolfmother wallpaper
You can lick the wounds 'cause it's all flavored
All labor can resume 'cause we're all makers
All [?] get consumed by a six-foot mushroom
Working with the broom for the dust mice
Doing the tough guy skin from a rough night
I feel you thinking on some, "I don't give a fuck, Mike"
But this is what you wanted to see
This is the room with the Wolfmother wallpaper
Where I drink Blue Moon from the salt shaker
Tallest wall Fraser was on a fault line
But I ain't afraid to shake it cause it's all mine
You at the precipice, and if you tryna sink the rest of it
I'll show you [water/what I?], tell you where the question is
Can you hear that all the childhood excrement
Stand next to it and respect it, sit
You say you don't care if the air isn't decent
But there's a door there for a reason
And it's worse than the first floor
And after this you can't say you weren't warned
And even if you find what you search for
Caught between a nigga and a wizard in a turf war
In a small room hotter than the Earth's core
It might cost you your arm or your first born
And we both know you really can't afford it
So then you gotta deal with the feeling
And leave it with something that you know is important
Without leaving a thing in return
