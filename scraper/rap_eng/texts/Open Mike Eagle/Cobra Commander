[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
They call me crazy
Cause I know who draws the pretty pictures they see
He tryna chase me
This is the last straw
I ain't no hay seed
Won't take his mask off cause he don't wanna face me
They want me dead cause I know the truth
I can show 'em proof and put computers in the voting booth
I know the dude
He keep a stolen egg from a golden goose
And passes out crack and crystal meth to the local youth
I got a folder full of intel that told me how he kicks whales
Pulls pig tails and hid grails and runs up in the get-wells and snatches up the piss pails
And puts 'em in a vaporizer just to make the chem trails
What an unclean asshole
I'mma sanitize the unseen hand for sure
He 30 years deep in the killing biz
But I ain't worried about telling you who the villain is

[Hook]
Y'all know the answer
So all the Free Thinkers can all throw your hands up
Ain't no coincidence
This shit isn't random
I'm blaming everything on Cobra Commander

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Go to hell
Gayest shit I ever did was let a nigga braid my hair in jail
I ain't frontin', no I ain't lyin'
But I roll up, had my shit in zig-zag designs
Layin' in the bunk
Stay by myself
On my own
Up in that bitch with no help
I'm never on a phone, fuck a TV
I don't play cards
My nigga don't play me
Put a boiled egg
In a bag of chips
Crush the chips up
Put the egg and then I shook
Don't know how to play chess
I don't read books
I donâ€™t go to rec
I grab you by your neck
But in my mental
I hear them instrument
So I'm in the bunk
Writing with them little ass pencils
And I ain't got no answers
So mother fuck Cobra Commander

[Hook] [2x]
