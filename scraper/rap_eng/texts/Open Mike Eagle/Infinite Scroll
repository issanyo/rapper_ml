[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Awestricken, my brow furled up, my lip is curled
All distant, need a referral for a different world
Audacious my instinct is to go and get small places
Fuck your lease, I don’t owe you shit
Outlandish, I get low and I hover there
Not branded, cause if they could they'd discover air
Rain Walrus, under a pelt like a brother bear
Stone Fragments trapped in air tight tupperware
Who’s missing? The headcount says minus 1
Dude, listen: Priest, my mouth is a zion's gun
Intrepid, below ice like the submarine
Been sectioned, looking at old tight drum machines
Mixed potions, Hoping to grow like Thumbelin'
Your shit's broken, so watch me roll like tumbleweed
Old patterns breaking, interrupt duplicates
No data: blank, your concept's toothless
It's done


[Chorus: P.O.S]
I am a dead man walking
Them streets ain't talking, man
They busy talking on they phones
Favoriting they problems, liking all they causes
Can't help feelin' alone
I'm tryna live it while I can
Feeling every feeling, every feeling I can stand
Unplugged, unstuck instead of unwound and undone
(Head down, thumbs up)
Instead of lost in the infinite

[Verse 2: Manchita]
Woke up flat broke in a back seat
Low-ball recalling til I choke down the caffeine
Throbbing in my back when I feel the earth beneath my feet
Life’s no beach, it’s a rabid dog in heat
And I’m not your hostage, I’m hot potato—hash you out later
Not now, I’m way too gone for the page you’re on
In fact I burned the whole book like my next high depended on it
Batting fat lashes at the casting, ranting
“Save the fucking dolphins, you guys,”
While I mash a tuna sandwich
Fables never sounded so rounded and pounding
Never wound down, never found out
Who’s counting, who’s down with us
Should be obvious not a network mess
I guess that’s why my cuticles uplift in upset for the present unkept
Tenderness of my fleshiness
Dead with the swelling of this particular winter’s discontent

[Chorus: P.O.S]
I am a dead man walking
Them streets ain't talking, man
They busy talking on they phones
Favoring all my problems, liking all my causes
Can't help feelin' alone
I'm tryna live it while I can
Feeling every feeling, every feeling I can stand
Unplugged, unstuck instead of unwound and undone
(Head down, thumbs up)
Instead of lost in the infinite

[Verse 3: P.O.S]
Huh? Compare myself to who?
Skitching on this mother ship
Rock with a champion crew
Fit in with this other shit
I don't even know what they do
I ain't tryna learn, it's servant shit I never knew
I'm a professional profession skipper
Never been a job I didn't quit to hit a stage and rip it
Get it in, Get into it
Better with this, off the map
I'm ten and two-ing, keep it moving constantly
Keep that foolish off of me
Possibilities are literally limitless
But that screen is inches from your vision, man
That scenery is written text
Tryna knowledge up this girl
Who's talking on her phone though
Typing hella awkward
Bout some other chick she don't know
Hate the hand dealt, self-help through selfie therapy
Play the feels felt with your digital self, aimlessly
Only dramatic people utter "no drama"
Butter-nutting that beef they only seem to keep a pound of
Right? Fuck
