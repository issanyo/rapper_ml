Intro:
One day they came to save you
From all those people you can’t relate to
Stay cool, ‘cause we gonna make moves
And let the sun-rays of the day just take you away
They came to save you
From all those people you can’t relate to
Stay cool, ‘cause we gonna make moves
And let the sun-rays of the day just take you away

Verse 1[Open Mike Eagle]:
Don't forgive me I still get strength
From the poems you sent me, the lonely entries
Emboldened bridge ink your soul goes with me
Gently into the abyss
It consists of sadness, A homemade hell
From the Ten Commandments, Home-girl universe
Missing planet, Addictions rampin'
Tryna make sense in the mists of madness
Enslaved to the whims of a distant matchin'
Against this blackness, Good attractions
Friendships tend to get fixed into pastures
Another victim of instant reaction

Hook:
One day they came to save you
From all those people you can’t relate to
Stay cool, ‘cause we gonna make moves
And let the sun-rays of the day just take you away
They came to save you
From all those people you can’t relate to
Stay cool, ‘cause we gonna make moves
And let the sun-rays of the day just take you away


Verse 2[Open Mike Eagle]:
Please believe me, your memories keep me
Breathing easy, beneath the deep sea
Your sweeter than the fruit from leaves of peach trees
The bad vibes need releasing, It keeps
Me grounded when I feel surrounded in
In a chief's seat 3 feet leapin' drownin'
Heart poundin' disconnected
Standing for a moment in the whisper section
With the wish that you'll get rejected
Your intellect and your courage have a meeting at an
Intersection, you're traveling in misdirection
Red-light red-light insurrection
Then the peanut gallery
Interjects with more nonsense
Negativity erupts from subconscious
The destruction is monstrous

Outro:
One day they came to save you
From all those people you can’t relate to
Stay cool, ‘cause we gonna make moves
And let the sun-rays of the day just take you away
They came to save you
From all those people you can’t relate to
Stay cool, ‘cause we gonna make moves
And let the sun-rays of the day just take you away
