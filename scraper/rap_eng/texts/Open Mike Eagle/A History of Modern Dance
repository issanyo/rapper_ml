[Verse 1]
First step is intention, second step is a glance
Then divine intervention
Mixing science religion
Pretending like we giants
Promise I was the biggest
For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing
Two strangers passing on the metro, what were the chances
People walk into circles
Every audience listens
They taking turns judging, everybody got issues
I be moving my feet and on varied tables I'm eating on
Up, we're cutting a rug, was it something I said
Put on Erykah's album, I can tear up a mountain
Get your eagle on, naw, more peregrine falcon
They sit in the darkness
They connect they courting naked in different apartments
Don't say nothing that's awkward
Take them up on that offer
And you'll be partnered up for life flying up in a saucer
And they trying to cat daddy, I'm hella allergic

[Hook]
I've been doing my research, so I know that move
I studied them all
I seen that swing
I've been watching it for hours, so don't get too close
She kick real high
They swing real low
I done been in that position so I know that spell
I read that book
I know those lines, I see 'em coming back around

[Verse 2]
First step is intention, second step is a glance
Then divine intervention
Mix of science religion
Environmentalist dance, make 'em sign a petition
For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing
Two strangers passing on the freeway, what were the chances
Don't be acting embarrassed, that's the whackest awareness
They get it in before their skin starts cracking and tearing
Heaven's not for the living
Ordained reverend and comparative monster religion
Sit in my pews
Cruise ship in the Pacific, we can bend the rules
And do the Transylvania boogie to forbidden blues
She did the peanut butter jelly, ain't nobody looking
The soul train line's long and it's sloppy and crooked
The chicken noodle soup and poodle skirt and hula hooping
The bullshit's twerking, you wanna see the Juicy Fruit
Ain't no keeping a distance, murdered the shadow

[Hook]
I've been doing my research, so I know that move
I studied them all
I seen that swing
I've been watching it for hours, so don't get too close
She kick real high
They swing real low
I done been in that position so I know that spell
I read that book
I know those lines, I see 'em coming back around

[Verse 3]
We can do it for safety like a factory worker
Trying to balance a beam
Skirt's floating cause she's twirling around in a dream
It's the easiest hustle
You catch a swing and then you squeeze your trapezius muscles
It takes a year or two
Your old friends you done found yourself getting nearer to
Who wants to hear the truth
Well you can do the wop
And plug us in, we got it poppin' in computer shops
First step is intention, second step is a glance
Then divine intervention
Mixing science religion
Pretending like we giants
Promise I was the biggest
For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing
Two strangers passing in the hallway, what were the chances
