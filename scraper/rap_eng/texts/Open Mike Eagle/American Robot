[Intro]
Hiyawei Ohiya

[Verse 1: Buy Muy Drugs]
Wake up every morning, and I brush my teeth
Kiss the wife
Go to work
Wake up every morning, and I brush my teeth
Kiss the wife
Go to work
(I go to work)
Go to work
(Don't go to work)
Go to work
(Don't go to work, Don't go to work)

[Hook: Buy Muy Drugs]
First you brush your teeth
Shear the sheep
Hunt the prey
Feed the kids
Fuck your wife
Kill the day
And slay the night
Pay the lights
Mow the lawn
Fix the sink
And fuck your wife
Kill the day
And slay the night
Kill the day
And slay the night
Slay the night

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
For lunch my lady fixes me pickles and chicken parmesan
I clock into the station and wait on rating from Arbitron
Trying to get these interns not to be unprofessional
Please put your waste items in the proper receptacles
Saving
My son has been asking for different fire trucks
Climb the corporate ladder
Pal around with the higher-ups
Get your clients up
I park my car under the viaduct
Between an old mail truck and an idle bus
How many times I've promised myself that this was the final cut
Grind another line until it's the time with the Midas touch
Reminds me of this time when we thought nobody could silence us
Please pardon my sinuses

[Hook: Buy Muy Drugs]
First you brush your teeth (brush my teeth)
Sheer the sheep
Hunt the prey
Feed the kids
Fuck your wife
Kill the day
And slay the night
Pay the lights
Mow the lawn
Fix the sink
And fuck your wife
Kill the day
And slay the night
Kill the day
And slay the night
Slay the night

[Outro: Buy Muy Drugs]
(Hiyawei)
Brush my teeth
(Hiyawei)
Kiss the wife
Go to work

(Hiyawei)
Brush my teeth
(Hiyawei)
Kiss the wife
Go to work

(Hiyawei)
Who's in love with ya?
