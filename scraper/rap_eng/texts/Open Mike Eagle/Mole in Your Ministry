[Verse 1]
I had a nightmare of Tony Blair
I had a dream I cracked him in the head with a folding chair
I had the people just hold him there
And bashed his dome until blood splashed his golden hair
I drew his ass a mustache with a Sharpie marker
And cut his head like an artsy barber
I set it off in the House of Commons
I'm a party starter
Starting political parties for wheat and barley farmers
Voting in secret ballots for whole leaf or Caesar salad
Should I have roast beef or vegan sandwich?
Will I get cold feet or meet the challenge
Is the Obelisk a secret phallus?
Circle yes or no
Squeeze the juice from a purple vegetable
Then bring it to the first Congressional hearing
That you can find
Mix in their wine and start smearing
All over their faces like
"Taste this you rapist
Take it like the bribes
From the dudes you gave favors"

You've had the whole world in a chokehold mentally

[Verse 2]
I listen to far too much NPR
In my scarred up empty car
So large trucks near me start hard-bumping Diddy
I'm creating an all star funk committee
Made of chart-chomping ninnies
That make hard county ditties
Let's us do-see-do
(Poor broke and lonely ho)
Before they sell us polio contaminated Oreos
Sometimes I don't agree with rap
(Why?)
Cause most of it reinforces social achievement gaps
I gotta get brainy
Cause I'm a politic hating scholarship trainee
Sometimes when people speak we will silence it
Their skill level doesn't meet the requirements
I killed devils underneath the environment
Even though I don't believe in your fire pits
I'm sharp enough to make your tires split
Sharp as a choir's pitch
My enlightened heart don't desire shit

[Hook]
You've had the whole world in a chokehold mentally
(You'll be letting it go)
Cause I'm the mole in your ministry
I heard of the dark arts and underground chemistry
(I'm letting the globe know)
Cause I'm the mole in your ministry
Take the cross from the rose
And there's no more energy
(It's set to explode)
Cause I'm the mole in your ministry
I've been to the rainbow
The fake gold tempted me
(The mystery's age old)
Cause I'm the mole in your ministry

[Verse 3]
Pay no attention to the orbs that flew in a formation
Your flow will get cancelled due to your poor ratings
Your rappin' makes 'em continue to ruin poor nations
Because of you there's more rapings in Ecuador
Escape from you is what children think that the meth is for
You're what they get billions for building secret weapons for
You are the enemy
You're why they bombard the infantry
Of nations who populations are base and retarded mentally
And they can say that because of who?
(You)
You're also the reason they came back with "W"
(Twice)
Because of you it's war on the populace
And the logo's a sword and an obelisk
The same ones you adorned on your monuments
Not an inordinate moderate
They're more of the opposite
With little more than the pocket-lint between us
Me and my homies are building a rocket ship to Venus
Before the sick apocalypse hit it's zenith

[Hook]
