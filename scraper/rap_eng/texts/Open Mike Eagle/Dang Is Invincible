[Hook]
I'm so invincible, I'm so invincible
I'm not so vulnerable, like I was before
And I feel wonderful (Dang, dang, dang)
Y'all can't fuck with me
I'm un-fuck-with-able
I'm so invincible

[Verse 1]
It's a dang day
I visited my jail but I can't stay
I'm used to hearing what the fans say
I'm going out but not going out the same way
I rented me a bicycle
Woke up in a hood I ain't recognize
I saw a weird looking cop and I said goodbye
Fucked around and got a little bit of exercise
Everything was overblown
Woke up first down, and it's goal to go
I'm in the zone you know
Someone asked to collab and I told 'em no(uh-uh)
Cause I won't enjoy it
Told a school loan people I was unemployed
And they believed me!
This blouse is cool and they needed the right blue but I found cerulean
Woke up without a hangover
That burrito worked, my stomach, my head and my teeth don't hurt
I didn't vomit on my street clothes
Did I charge my phone?
I was drunk and I still remembered to charge my phone (Dang)
That burrito was good as fuck
I drank a whole bottle of water when I got back home but yeah

[Bridge]
Some other days I don't be knowing what to do
The day is dang
I got another point of view
I'm saying "dang" today I ain't afraid of you
Or you, or you, or you, or you

[Hook]
I'm so invincible, I'm so invincible
I'm not so vulnerable, like I was before
And I feel wonderful (Dang, dang, dang)
Y'all can't fuck with me
I'm un-fuck-with-able
I'm so invincible

[Verse 2]
Gotta admit it's hard to feel good without being narcissistic
Did the whole tour and didn't get a parking ticket
Looked in my heart and there wasn't no darkness in it
Feel awesome dude, found some wind to throw caution to
Ate awesome food, threw some trash in the trash from across the room
Like swish, didn't even use the wall
? and didn't get confused at all
Found new resolve and strength to get through when my crew dissolved
Less clumsy, didn't dress funny
I made some good times, I made some rent money
Got positive thoughts from talking to folks
And for a day I ain't sweating no anonymous quotes
I'm like dang

[Hook]
I'm so invincible, I'm so invincible
I'm not so vulnerable, like I was before
And I feel wonderful (Dang, dang, dang)
Y'all can't fuck with me
I'm un-fuck-with-able
I'm so invincible

[Outro]
I get to be the one for a nanosec
I get to be the one for a nanosec
I get to be the one for a nanosec
I get to be the one for a nanosec

Hey you, you listening to this record, wake up
Hey you, you listening to this record, wake up
