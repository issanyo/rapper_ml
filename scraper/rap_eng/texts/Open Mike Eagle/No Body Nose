[Verse 1]

I try to never let stresses show
I'm a grade A privacy professional
Forget everything that I said before
At the finish line this is what you better know

[Hook]

Nobody knows
More than you

[Verse 2]

Don't sympathize
My brain can't draw simple lines
I keep it compartmentalized
You know I won't call on Christmas time
And you know not to act all victimized
When we link up, it's all synchronized
It's all big glass beer bottles, twisted limes
A strong network uncentralized
Infrequent reunions with big goodbyes
But when your new shit's procedural
It's cause the old shit's unrepeatable


[Hook]

[Verse 3]

And if you can't see the whole view
There's a lot of shit I haven't told you
We're all just collections of past events
That's why I'm so protective and passionate
And when it comes down to new folks
I'm extra selective of applicants
Question, can your perceptions be accurate
If we never made festivus sandwiches
Either we'll get along really well
Or not mesh like weapons and pacifists
Descendants of Africans
One tribe, or separate savages
Is our ability to unify dependent on broadband connections and bandwidth?

And if you can't see the whole view
There's a lot of shit I haven't told you
