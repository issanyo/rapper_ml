[Verse 1]
Don't lie to me
They get exposed so violently
The pain in her soul won't go quietly
Do whatever you want just be straight
Show improve, tell the truth as a whole and don't wait
Be straight with me
I know it's hard and you hate to be
Confrontational, the information flows
Gracefully if you let it
Like hey, loan from memory banks but no credit
Let it go don't edit
I can take it
The only real truth is butt naked
And I know when you faking
And maybe them others was impatient
But I'm telling you to trust I can take it
Trust is so sacred
We need a solid foundation
Of openness with no hesitation
Just talk to me
I'm here just talk to me
Give it to me straight, just talk to me

[Verse 2]
You know what I mean
You ain't got to say it like that though
It's about being real and not being an asshole
You can keep real without being so rude though
We all hella grown and you know when it's too cold
You say it all harsh and the damage is two fold
A spoon full of sugar makes the medicine smooth though
I'm saying though
You ain't got to say it like that though
You can be true and still come off tactful
Is that so hard?
I ain't asking for too much
You beat me on head with this shit like it's nunchucks
I ain't saying cover, just butter the truth up
You know I'm sensitive and you came at me too tough
Come on

[Verse 3]
You know what, fuck it just lie
You ain't got to say shit
Fuck it just lie
Don't say shit just hide
Just fake it, just lie
I said it but I changed my motherfucking mind
Just lie
