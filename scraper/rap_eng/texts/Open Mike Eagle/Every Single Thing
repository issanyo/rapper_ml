[Intro]
One two
And I check one two
And I check three four as well
I'm 'bout to check five six
Better make sure all that shit is in sequence

[Verse 1]
Yeah
They say do you, just do it first
This all textbook, that's how confusion works
Everybody here stressed, can't understate
Everybody that I know got a stomach ache
And can't tell the undead from the unawake
You can't impeach at least give us summer breaks
And the experts all say different things
Put 'em all in the crossface chicken wing
Aerosmith said they don't wanna miss a thing
It's too fast like a little kid's christening
And black life value is not a size
So, what you mean if you askin' us to compromise?
If you a citizen it's automatic qualify
His momma keep the boy picture in wallet-size
You should be on the floor cryin'
How it both sides, we ain't both dyin'

[Hook]
Pause me, learn me, one-hundred percent
Predict me, get me, one-hundred percent
Complete me, eat me, one-hundred percent
Defeat me, delete me, another attempt
Repeat, learn me, one-hundred percent
Predict me, get me, one-hundred percent
Complete me, eat me, one-hundred percent
Defeat me, delete me, another attempt
Repeat
Everything, everything, every single thing [x3]

[Verse 2]
The economy killed the rhyme-star
I'm privileged; born with the silver time-card
'bout as high as I held my heroes
I put my chips on myself like Pete Rose
We in the future, there's far more options now
I'm in the crib breaking cardboard boxes down
Through my roots I respond, react
Cos my folks need jobs and some Wozniaks
In my nightmares, I swear, there's some Nazi blacks
That say "pull yourself up by your Huarache straps"
Y'all say something dumb and I swear to God
Imma pack up and run 'til I tear a quad
Imma look into the sun, Imma stare at God
I'm gon' get as big as Pun in the Terror Squad
I'm coming off the top at the Hammerstein
I won't even stop when it's Hammertime
Memories is deep in the skeleton
I say peace, please know it's all relative

[Hook]
Pause me, learn me, one-hundred percent
Predict me, get me, one-hundred percent
Complete me, eat me, one-hundred percent
Defeat me, delete me, another attempt
Repeat, learn me, one-hundred percent
Predict me, get me, one-hundred percent
Complete me, eat me, one-hundred percent
Defeat me, delete me, another attempt me
Repeat
Everything, everything, every single thing [x3]

I can see the whole future, man
Tell me what you like and I'll ruin it
I would show you the computer dance
Nigga, you already doin' it
