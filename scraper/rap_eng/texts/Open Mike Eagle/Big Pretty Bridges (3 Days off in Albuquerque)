[Verse 1]
I’m far away from my house, wrote this song in the hotel room
On a day of the show, got canceled, now this room feels like Bellevue
Jupiter’s got twelve moons and there’s life forms on a couple of them
Give a fuck if my plans fell through, if I’m deep purple or pale blue
So please circle the right answer on this questionnaire I’m gon’ mail you
Haven’t we yet made a real connection or is this simply a prelude?
Whats this centuries Quaalude? What’s the next millennium’s molly pill?
And my body feels like sunlight, ‘bout to run right through this poppy field
So my eyes burn and my nose run and my skin itches like fire
Only rappers with sinus troubles could ever enter my cipher
Every sentence that I write, my muse feels like it could be tighter
There’s a small chance that we can’t connect ‘cause we’re too differently wired

[Hook]
We’ll dig, we’ll still build big pretty bridges
We’ll dig, we’ll still build big pretty bridges
We’ll dig, we’ll still build big pretty bridges
We'll...

[Verse 2]
What the fuck is you doing here? I done plugged up this computer gear
And I’m ‘bout to sweat in this laptop, the drive here was like five years
I swear I only made one gas stop, I’m the Batman of the minivan
And my plan’s choking these rap fans who think rap shows are like Disneyland
What the fuck is you doing here with no roller coasters, no souvenirs?
Sometimes the shit’s second nature, other times it feels super weird
There’s some faces here I done seen before, seen people dancing, seen people bored
Now I’m reaching out for your hand so you can understand what I’m speaking for
But don’t sweep the floor, but don’t wipe the bar, leave them glasses right where they are
Look at me when I talk to you cause this not some shit I’m sleepwalking through
Not some shit that y’all can wipe away, a game some of y’all like to play
I’m dialing into U access and U this signal will not decay

[Hook]
We’ll dig, we’ll still build big pretty bridges
We’ll dig, we’ll still build big pretty bridges
We’ll dig, we’ll still build big pretty bridges
We'll...
