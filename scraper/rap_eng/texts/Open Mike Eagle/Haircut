[Chorus]

I really like your haircut
I hope you stay ahead of the trend
I really like your haircut
Your barber did a really nice blend

[Verse 1]

One side cut, low faded textual
Magical laser spectacles
One side long just to stay professional
Girl you just so asymmetrical
Keep the pump fade tall, cylindrical
Fuck what's "in", you're your own individual
Watch you offer an awesome visual
Open-toed sandals, soft and biblical
Middle class with your fancy habits
Girl you dress like Randy Savage
Cowboy hat with the plastic patches
They match the glasses, it's so glamtastic
High-top jeans to approach your naval
Rolled up bill just to coke your nasal
Thick gold chain with a low appraisal
All made up like Toni Basil

[Chorus]

I really like your haircut
I hope you stay ahead of the trend
I really like your haircut
Your barber did a really nice blend

[Verse 2]

You got the party rockin' on your seedy J's
Lookin' like a character from GTA
You get it shaped up every three days
With the lines on the side like BDK
I know that's before your time
So I'mma help you memorize from Yo Yo Rhymes
I saw you outside on the promo line
I said damn, those stretch pants is so divine
I can see the outline of your whole behind
And your granny panty lines with the old design
And your rainbow toe socks blow my mind
I'm so impressed I went home to write this rhyme 'cause

[Chorus]

I really like your haircut
I hope you stay ahead of the trend
I really like your haircut
Your barber did a really nice blend
