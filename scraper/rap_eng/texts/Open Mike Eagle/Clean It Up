Yup, and I heard it before
Said the failed rap writer, the blog cosigner
The new staff higher with the best new opinion
You emailed a lot but you never could get in
Hm, maybe you should ring J. Kim
Spittin' to get PR, it snubs you again
All you gotta do is keep rapping
Said the older dude who ain't got a lot happening
Easy advice when you're sitting outside of the air quotes game
Ergo, there's your lane
Listen to my nine go bang
First forty eight A twenty four frames of the audio, visual
Radio really could play some more Dilla though
I ain't gon' tippy toe
All things legally and otherwise stated
It's not a slave deal but it's on a plantation
Maybe I should ring J. Kim
Shout out to Random, Kweli and Print
NoCan and Castle, 'Geti and Prem
And Castro, Zilla, Zone
The real little world Small Pro
Payton and Sean Daley
Lewis Dorley for the win
Play you that recording like dailies
Fingers up, jazz clap for me, baby

They gotta follow us and it sucks for them
We make a mess and we clean it up again
It ain't ever gonna be like it was
They gotta follow us and it sucks for them
We make a mess and we clean it up again
It ain't ever gonna be like it--

[Open Mike Eagle]

It used to be a sock hop in the spot
Shout out to Aesop Rock, Rob Sonic and the man Big Wiz
DJ pretty frolic with his
I once seen him suplex an ice machine
I make it bubble like rice and beans, for side orders
The other ground rappers been marathon craning
We lie for five quarters
They're falling behind and making crosses, a calling for time
It looks similar, all I see is pinky rings held perpendicular
When they fall, shit's looking immaculate
Cause PR folks make it look like an accident
The label says organic keep reading though
The majors ain't afraid to pay for GMO's
Cat burglar black hat with stealth moves
They even making money off the health food
