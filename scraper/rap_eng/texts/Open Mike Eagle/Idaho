[Verse 1]
Maybe we should’ve stayed, where we was
We hopped in thinking it was a game, and it was
We made it then celebrated post-game, but the buzz
My hindsight’s blurry it’s looking grey, with a fuzz
Trying to muster all the foresight I can use, for the road
Cause out here ain’t no streetlights I can view, where we go
This was supposed to be the desert I’m confused, cause it’s cold
Seeking what sunlight reflecting off the moon, could expose
Took two, for the road
Drank three, in the zone
Drank four, to the dome
Couple hits from the bowl hit the road
But maybe we should’ve stayed, where we was
We hopped in thinking it never rains, but it does
And this is the loneliest stretch of road, we done seen
Two hundred miles to go and not a pole, in between
Don't roll, don't careen
Two hands, on the wheel keep control
I don’t know if I’m speeding or going slow, in a dream


[Hook]
Slidin’ in the shimmership, hidden by the riverbank
Hovering over the desert running out of real estate
Giant silver snake, grinding trying to hit the breaks, big mistake
Just trying to stay awake on the interstate


[Verse 2]
I can’t touch the bottom but I’m floating hella deep
I had a co-pilot but they fucking fell asleep
You’re supposed to be another set of motherfucking eyes
You shared your entertaining thoughts but now I’m stuck with mine
Damn near fucking blind, don’t know why you trust me to drive
I guess cause everytime you trust, we survive, but it’s time
Is a motherfucking gamble
Eventually lady luck will call and say she cancels
You betting on my confidence when I was extra high, now I’m extra high
We'll pull over just to rest my eyes
And the only thing, fueling me is that I’m scared to die
And I’m scared for you cause you could die and never said goodbye
Why you trust me so? Why’d you let me lead
When I don’t know where I’m going and I speed?
And this vehicle’s the jankiest
Feel this coffee ruining my stomach and my pancreas
Sounds make me the angriest
So foggy the words, seem to be turning different languages I


[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Maybe we should’ve stayed, where we was
This is the loneliest planet I’ve ever seen
And I am in no state to try to fly, this machine
I don’t know this terrain
All my instruments are twisted all my needles won’t behave
I don’t know what’s in this atmosphere so when we finally crash
I don’t know if we’ll be able to breathe, if we’ll be able to leave
I have the tools to repair, whatever structures we tear
I know at first it was yeah, but I was so unaware
Of like the cost of the fuel
It started awesome now we’re tossed and I lost all of my cool
