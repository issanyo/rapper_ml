[Verse 1]
Yeah, you can have it all
You can get the girl
And if you're short
Be the tallest midget in the world
It's your orchard, no self-torture
Hold head high like the guy on the New Yorker
Though, That guy reminds me of slavery
I'll let that inspire me to bravery
Click Twitter read j smooth and be the boy
YouTube for reruns of Freakazoid
Trying not to laugh or even talk a lot
People try to get shit done at the coffee shop
Good script, man
Grab that Oscar
Don't settle for shrimp pans, have that lobster
But sit straight or you'll have bad posture
And turn into a hunchback
And damn that's awkward
More rap advice
I'll open the coffers
You don't have to ask, I'll just offer

[Hook]
Believe me I understand
I lost a couple battles like MC Shan
Now my days go according to plan
Powerful man, universe man
This is not email spam
Or trojan malware that eats up ram
Just follow step one, step two then bam
Powerful man, universe man
And it don't cost three grand
You don't have to swear an oath to goat god pan
Don't need muscles or a situation tan
Powerful man, universe man

[Verse 2]
Go easy on the buffalo wings
Do your best to stay out of a juggalo ring
Bring half the intensity Mark Ruffalo brings
And you'll do fine
A little Windex makes your school shoes shine
Or rock 'em all scuffed, the weird kids are artsy
The jocks are all tough
Had an x-ray and everything the doctor saw sucked
I still feel awesome
Unless I feel weird
I keep it confident for the sex appeal, yeah
And walk like a king, a queen, if you're a lady
It all comes in time
Like the teeth of a baby
Just a little bit of crying and bleeding in between
After ill meals there's still appliances to clean
No, trash is in the blue, recycling in the green

Now go out there and be somebody

[Hook]

[Verse 3 -Serengeti]
Yo the principles of pleasure are "accept the universe's gifts"
GCI blaze the hits, stay cool, gangsta rule
Play the cards, take the shot
Try something least famliar
Hard like the wonder licker
Tribe in all sanscript
At least it's nice, breeze and dream
Woman that you met in France
Held hands while you dance
Imagination at a glance
Art house forewarns
This one's about a shopping clerk
Widow and a stepdad
Erotic like a golden lab
Kiss a little, eat your shoes
If you can stay and not peruse
Little poo's shoes, chartreuse
Tiny little kangaroos
From a village, feeling free
Energetic energy
Universal man, was that him?
Used to look damn
Yes it is, yes it was
Feeling so glum
Uncomfortably dumb, numb
Silly back then
Any place could be great, if you have a little grace
Paris could be boring, too, even Vegas in space, dog
Yo, be optimistic
Have fun like a bimbo
Smoother than a limo window
There's other herbs in in sento[?]
Plants that are cool, help children use words
And learn to use tools, infuses
Universal man, use it, do it
Be prepared for the end of times
Get amped, prepped
Have a little pep
Walk it off, calf cramped tight
Come on, fool, excellent source for companionship
I may be mules and fuel
There's stranger plants that are also cool
Universal man, truths
Plants that could be used as roofs and shoes
Chilling out the ranger rules
Scorpion, gold tail rings
Old Russian nicknames
Airplanes graveyard
Discovering lumbering
Singing and strumming, king-a-ling
Beautiful mall, meeting fling brings lean green things
Gah
