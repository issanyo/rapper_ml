[Chorus: Illogic]
Your ride’s dead, no life in the engine
You lost your groove and this is what you’re missing
There’s gotta be another way to break your fall
Instead of riding on our coattails, you make the call

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Organized waddle like The March of The Penguins
But dark like the soul of actor Robert Englund
Tryna stay open minded as Father England when his kids told him they were gonna start a circus
But nervous like always on posse cut verses
Stay smooth like Hydroxycut on epidermis
Yes, respect my overcompensation
Elected most hectic by voter nomination and voter fraud
Sign this form in triplicate
Once on the yellow on the maze and the golden rod
Not misogynistic enough to imagine that I’m the one guy that some French maids dote upon
Not gonna mow the lawn, I live in an apartment
I keep power bills paid, no pissin’ in the darkness, I’m
In it ’til I die, turn that r&b music off
That ribbon in the sky is some poor kid’s balloony lost

[Chorus: Illogic]
Your ride’s dead, no life in the engine
You lost your groove and this is what you’re missing
There’s gotta be another way to break your fall
Instead of riding on our coattails, you make the call

There’s an eclipse that’s yearning for some sunlight
Whatever it takes, I’m baked to get their minds right
Even in the darkest hour, there’s some hope
Boy, you just gotta face the facts, you’re not dope

[Verse 2: Has-Lo]
I grew up on tapes like Payton Locke
Threw up on days when I drank a lot
A lightweight like the one holding paper down
Your pen’s numb as the [?] of Don Draper’s spouse
From the very first date
T-bone steak, cheese, eggs and Welch’s Grape’s great
The first two million times
It’s your fault, not mine, shoulda took the sign, or [?]
My regiments ready with
The a-sides, [?] plus a deadly flip, [?]
That’s a double entendre
The first side hits and the b-side’s harder
Smarter raps than a young kid’s ear
‘cause all the schools say, “Put the dumb kids here”
The x marks it
I sell non-sequiturs on the black market, like a sex [?]

[Chorus: Illogic]
Your ride’s dead, no life in the engine
You lost your groove and this is what you’re missing
There’s gotta be another way to break your fall
Instead of riding on our coattails, you make the call

There’s an eclipse that’s yearning for some sunlight
Whatever it takes, I’m baked to get their minds right
Even in the darkest hour, there’s some hope
Boy, you just gotta face the facts, you’re not dope

[Verse 3: Illogic]
It’s the simpleton that bathes in complexity
Elevate the ground until they’re standing right next to me
I keep it moving, locomotive with the rhyme scheme
Barhop ’til I can’t walk but [?] with perfect timing
Designated driver swerving through the mean streets
Grab the wheel, crash-land in the middle of meaningless
He is just amazing, visuals of Bloody Sunday
Fully loaded out of range, a playpen for gunplay
Masterpiece theater, at least here’s a promise
Believe it, unmasked track-cleavage leaving beats topless
Off topic, lost optics, locked for shades on
Waking up for breakfast, sample plates of scrambled napalm
Move with the rhythm, got those school efficient ‘fluences
Doing this as second nature, motion sensors prone to injure
Breaker one nine, no longer confined to space
The stronger the bass, the more the system vibrates

[Chorus: Illogic]
Your ride’s dead, no life in the engine
You lost your groove and this is what you’re missing
There’s gotta be another way to break your fall
Instead of riding on our coattails, you make the call

There’s an eclipse that’s yearning for some sunlight
Whatever it takes, I’m baked to get their minds right
Even in the darkest hour, there’s some hope
Boy, you just gotta face the facts, you’re not dope
