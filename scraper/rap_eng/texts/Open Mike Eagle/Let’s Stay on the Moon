So long, you bitter climes
We're better leaving you behind and flying in the night
And all the damage that we've done
Don't look so bad when we block out the sun
So why fight?
And from the absence of sound
How can you pine for the clangor on the ground
And no room to walk around?
Let's stay on the moon
And watch the earth go down
Hats off if you survived 2125
Oh, try to thrive
We had a daughter, and she died, in 2129
And I'm barely alive
But there's nothing left to fear
Leave all your pain down there and wait with me up here
Nobody's calling, dear
So let's stay on the moon
And watch the earth go down
Everybody wants a thing to put an end to suffering
Always trying to talk it through
But you hear me and I hear you
And it's cold now, at the core
So I'll take the warmth of just twenty minutes more
And you with me for it all
Let's stay on the moon
Let's stay on the moon
Let's stay on the moon
And watch the earth go down
