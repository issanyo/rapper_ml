[Verse 1]

I've been following my creed since a teenager
Writing in more run on sentences than the dialogue up in Speed Racer
See we ain't new to this
You can tell how we copy floppy computer disks
I'm a futurist so I don't rock a crucifix
Keep it deep in the dirt on some Rosicrucian shit
I'm on that free thinking doubletalk
My people's out there like NASA's space shuttle walk
Cultivating epiphanies out of subtle thoughts
My people stay serving and steady crossing the line
'Til the judges call double fault
We got a secret though
We used to keep it low
And them same judges is tighter than some needle nose pliers
Time to let the people know
Through the wires the higher ups keep below the surface
I haven't seen him but I heard it
And who would mislead us on purpose?

[Hook]

Hellfyre is the club
Swim is the team
Blowed is the project, the free thinkers scream
For whatever they want, they feel free
So they can have whatever they want

[Verse 2]

Keep it close to the vest like Pakistan
Don't watch the mic, the other one is the magic hand
It's not happenstance
From where you're at I can touch you like Plastic Man
A little oral projection a little astral man
Clap your unshackled hands
Partying with kings 'til the whole damn castle dance
And we can do like a wave do
Who lit the candles that the people in the cave drew
Fire lights in from a mountain top, praise due to who?
My light level stays through the roof
Keep the black and white pebble like Locke on the beach
Here to hold 'em to the light right and frightened people see red

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Weightless, is the keys on a Casio
All the secrets in the world were explained
On that Dinosaurs episode called 'The War on Pistachio'
It ain't my fault you didn't get it then
It was all their divisors the dividend the quotient
Sitting there just as plain as the ocean
I should have never brought it up
I got an army full of thirty something misfits
With quick wits that swing a mean ass coffee cup
Getting ill on the free range chicken parts
In the kitchen or the woods with the Wiccan arts
I just say that shit because it sounds cool
I ain't got a clue about the crown jewels
I'll be at the crib acting glib
Fixing my kids bib watching Party Down, fool

[Hook]
