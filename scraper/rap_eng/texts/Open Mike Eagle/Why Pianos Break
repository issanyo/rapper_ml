[Verse 1 - OME]

I came in the spot
Top flight attitude
Close to yellin' "Pop pop!" like Magnitude
Me and Malibu's incompatible
I'm where rabbits food meets 7th avenue
Part mechanical, heart's intangible
Another part dark skinned animal
According to the clutch
Shopping carts and purses in the park
Immersed in the circus and service of the arts
Circuits spark, then the worthless words start
To burst to the surface in a vertical march
Thus begins an irreversible arc
Resisting the urge to rip a person apart
Pitch in, the sensation's intense
The switch gets turned and it burns like incense
But upward the serpent inches

[Verse 2 - P.O.S.]

I wake up when I wanna
Active antagonist
Matches to cabinets, hollering "Stop the madness"
I'm a polar bear, yeah
Call him cattle killer
Even eatin' vegan
Solar flare terror shit, hopin' to heat your evening
A beacon to the reachin' for seasons
In the abyss flipped over drum breaks
My daily shakes the standard off
I handle only matters, human animal
Keep the noose loose, never tangle with intangible
Dreamin' the impossible
Live a dream, leave a pretty fossil
Watch only worth it
Clock how they cop for they birth it's
Sad, really mad, millis made off your hurtin'
Bust so I don't burst
Head hearse (med first?)
Treat the whole world like it's Fred Durst
Laugh it off
Pass a blast off hate, leave 'em apple sauce
No spoon, 'member that, harder hat
Spaz 'til I'm lost
All that glitter's probably fitter in a krylon
Tell 'em how their squeezing you to death like a python
Feel a little roadside harm
Nose dive culture, armatron tickin' on down
Pourin' up, growin' on down
Throwing up hands instead of throwing up now, right
Been a renegade full of rage since the days
Trying to rearrange, fresh from your throwaways
