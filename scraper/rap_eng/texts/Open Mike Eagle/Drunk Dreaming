[Verse 1]
Nothing's the same
I forgot what they call you but what's in a name
I'm buzzed, unashamed
I forgot who I was now my blood's full of flames
Now watch me do this dance
I feel like I'm in True Romance (where the director at?)
And all my thoughts is loud
Little man on my shoulder trying to talk me down
Couldn't sit so I walked around
I thought I saw a clown so I fought the crowd (kill 'em all)
And every time I close my eyes
A tiny Obama in a drone flies by
Now Gladys hold my calls
It's the future I'm about to try to fold my walls
Now I know I'm gone
Feeling like these random strangers know my songs (but they don't)
I'm still in my dance
In a full body robe while I clench my hands
Then I shut my eyes
And Martin Luther King in a bus drives by (what up)
I yell "what up, Doc?"
He waves back at me and says:
"Mike, you the motherfucking man"

[Hook]
(Drunk dreaming)
Pardon me Mr Officer
The room spinning and my thoughts are blurred (Drunk dreaming)
This might be dumb but where'd them butterfly wings on your face come from? (Drunk dreaming)
I need to take a poll right now:
Who else has got a belly full of ocean water? (Drunk dreaming)
I might be wrong but maybe life is just a Crucial Conflict song

[Verse 2]
I whispered "oh my god"
But ended shouting "Bout to blow my wad!"
Getting mad cause I can't find my iPod
It's really bad cause I don't even have an iPod
I'm damn close to filling my void
Ain't nobody killing my noise
It's like a vampire
Replace the stake in the heart with a burrito to the face
I can't even taste it though
I'm still trying to do this dance
Doing terrible impressions like "yo who's this man?"
This kind of night makes your crew disband
But I'd rather be solo so fuck all twelve of y'all
Is anybody else warm?
Shots of Energon until we all transform
Call me Jameson Prime
He said whatever came to his mind
Cause he don't give a fuck

[Hook]
Drunk dreaming
The room spinning and it's all a blur (drunk dreaming)
Now I'm at my house
You trying to give me a ticket for blacking out on my own couch? (drunk dreaming)
I tell you how I got back home
A shot of Patron turned me to a damn time traveler
And I'm oh so shook to see an unlined photo book
