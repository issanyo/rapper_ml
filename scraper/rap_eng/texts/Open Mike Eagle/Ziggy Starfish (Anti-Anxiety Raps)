[Verse 1]
Landed some place I ain't never been, yet again
Space travel veteran, never blend
Like they asked you to come around, never end
The initiation most times. If I'm in this
Old school letterman, never been
I'd like to ask if you know the code, guess again
Is a game barely controlled that they don't give
Like they gon' live forever
Politicians on straw-man missions
Stumble into town looking all ambitious
It's the ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead
He won't eat the Wonder Bread
He won't pledge allegiances
My saints is dead comedians
Trying to taste this cred is meaningless
That shit is warping my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Knee-deep in the same dirt
Only water divides us
Same places, different continents
And my head-space is an island
I swim freely through my phylum
I'm tuned to radio silence
Came to me while I was driving
Right then, it was decided

[Chorus]
I ain't never been to this planet
Make eye contact and I'm smiling
[x4]
Eye to eye...

[Verse 2]
Woke up thinking I'm Batman
Every town is like Gotham
I log into my twitter page
And start bending over like Gollum
This dumb cred is like crack rock
And I never seem to hit bottom
My representative smiling at you like
"What the fuck is the problem?"
Walk uncharted lands with no squad
Spots my ancestors picked cotton
They want me to carry their customs
When I know the truth is postmodern
I won't walk like an Egyptian
Don't talk like I be pimpin'
There's in-groups and there's out-groups
And I believe in making distinctions
I just smile and offer you greetings
Hopefully with no pretense
My aim's to honor your physical
And leave room for all of your secrets
We should all play a big Scrabble game
And make every word a confession:
"A-N-X-I-O-U-S."

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]
