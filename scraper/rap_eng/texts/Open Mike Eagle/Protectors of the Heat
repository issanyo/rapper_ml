[Hook]
Sticks we pick up, sticks we pick up
Sticks and stones that get thrown at these stick-up kids
Just kids, you know
These kids can grow
Pundits denying them this
So we pick up sticks for stick-up kids

Sticks we pick up, sticks we pick up
Sticks and stones that get thrown at these stick-up kids
Just kids, you know?
These kids can't grow without sunlight and grit
So for stick-up kids we pick up sticks

Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks

[Verse 1: Hemlock Ernst]
Gatsby
Seven headed dragon, ashy wake of vital Casio
Carry pens by the gallon load
Lil Mario tortoise shell spectacles and monocles
Diamond-fitted
Spinning from ruby necklaces, high polish
I ain't got a wallet
Just paper clips and newspaper clippings
Suggestion: new paper's mission's overtaking the district
Far from pensive
Emotionally unstable when looking from grave to cradle
B-boy in me, headspin like a dreidel
Tongue moves
The simplest sentences
Past the nimblest premises
Guards officiate the remnants
For the God divines the way the spine is crooked
And hookers need a dinner mint after Sunday supper out on 25th
Part the lips, force fed monogamy
Since bible verses prefaced place settings
Silver spoon, table--mahogany
Trouble knew Morse code
Tapped, tip-toe by proxy
Oxycontin levels maximized by runners high, honest why?
No simple way around this elevation
Cliff running for young son--darting
Out from undertow
Bury my opponents in a wave of exhalation
Ten ton flow, American
Blue Beard and Thunder Crow
Too much for these young minds to handle
Dismantle candles and stardust
Circle wax around the artist

[Hook]
Sticks we pick up, sticks we pick up
Sticks and stones that get thrown at these stick-up kids
Just kids, you know
These kids can grow
Pundits denying them this
So we pick up sticks for stick-up kids

Sticks we pick up, sticks we pick up
Sticks and stones that get thrown at these stick-up kids
Just kids, you know?
These kids can't grow without sunlight and grit
So for stick-up kids we pick up sticks

Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
I'm in an MJ jacket with eleven gold buttons
Trying to tell you what to do when I never know nothing
It's a secret, we're all damn desperate for it
Flitting through the long grass with lungs full of petrichor
What's the method?
Fuck it's a suggestion
Look at the assumption that's snuck into the questions
I'm grown, my dinner's vanilla cones
Skeletons  in closets, big thick gorilla bones!
And everything's encrusted
Like jewellery or better yet chicken breast
Quick pick; oral or written test?
Which pick florals for vision quest
A little warm death from Cassandra
Accompanying checks from a sponsor
I'll text you a mantra
Inhaled through your chest is enlarged on your exhales say "Jeff you're a monster"
I'm vexing my own damn concerts
This mic's dumb
I'm at the airport staring at my sliced thumb
Cookie-faced about to go through security

[Hook]
Sticks we pick up, sticks we pick up
Sticks and stones that get thrown at these stick-up kids
Just kids, you know
These kids can grow
Pundits denying them this
So we pick up sticks for stick-up kids

Sticks we pick up, sticks we pick up
Sticks and stones that get thrown at these stick-up kids
Just kids, you know?
These kids can't grow without sunlight and grit
So for stick-up kids we pick up sticks

Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
Sticks, we pick up sticks, we pick up sticks
