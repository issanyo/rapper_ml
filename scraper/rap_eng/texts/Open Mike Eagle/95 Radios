[Intro: Open Mike Eagle]
Okay, it's quiet now

[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]
And we drove all through the neighborhood
Just sittin' in a car all day
Tryna find a radio
And we wrapped both hands in tinfoil
Pointed at the window frame
Tryna find a radio
All up in my grandma's basement
Slidin' all the closet doors
Tryna find a radio
And the homies say they heard a rap song
Sounded like some folks they know
But we couldn't find a radio

[Verse 1: Has-Lo]
Hard to express when the world is listenin'
Hard when you're sure that the world is not
In between P.M. Dawn, and Sun Ra
Wearing a suit like my school mascot
The Edison owl not a head in the crowd
Could match my technique and impeccable style (style)
Says the young Hassan
In the mirror while Tip's saying "rock-rock-on"
With my guy Stefan who despite the specks
Saw himself doing things he would live to regret
Anyway, reciting off top the memory
Burnt a little chia my laugh was Gimli (heh)
Regarding the guns I coulda shot
I'm more Dove might blow up but won't pop
Jigsaw blocks and hop the road home
Steps on the Ave where I played and roamed

[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]
And we drove all through the neighborhood
Just sittin' in a car all day
Tryna find a radio
And we wrapped both hands in tinfoil
Pointed at the window frame
Tryna find a radio
All up in my grandma's basement
Slidin' all the closet doors
Tryna find a radio
And the homies say they heard a rap song
Sounded like some folks they know
But we couldn't find a radio

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
The old me would drink a 40
And eat bologna, shinobi
On NBA Live, I play with Kobe
The OGs, I miss my old hood
Miss my homies, is lonely
The radio host is like they know me
The ocean with the seashell is how we floatin'
Was hopin' to hear the airwaves, I think it's broken
I can still play it if the tape resurfaces
Kept the old Boombox for just these purposes
Heard a day show had mine on there recently
People had a hard time finding the frequency
Piece of me show feels personal
Circled on all sides by used car commercials
It's worth it though, whole block listenin'
'cept the kids, they so not interested
Implement new COINTELPRO's
Hooks, fit loops, copyrighted by Velcro
Whole sound changed, don't nobody want to sell those
Call the intercom yab this is my bellcote

[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]
And we drove all through the neighborhood
Just sittin' in a car all day
Tryna find a radio
And we wrapped both hands in tinfoil
Pointed at the window frame
Tryna find a radio
All up in my grandma's basement
Slidin' all the closet doors
Tryna find a radio
And the homies say they heard a rap song
Sounded like some folks they know
But we couldn't find a radio
