[Pre-Intro (Spoken)]
Too soon! Oh shoot! Los Angeles, let's go!
Oh wait you got that 2 PM dorner? Isn't that the lowest common denominator of ethical dilemmas?

[Intro: Busdriver]
We leap through your TV, bruh
My dudes sick like we looped leukemia
The beat sick like we looped leukemia
My scene sick like we looped leukemia
Alert the news media, we leap through your TV, bruh
My dudes sick like we looped leukemia
The beat sick like we looped leukemia
My scene sick like we looped leukemia
Alert the news media

[Hook: Nocando]
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Mike Eagle will not fail
Mike Eagle will not fail
I repeat shit to myself more than
These white people in Scottsdale
I'm a indie hustler first team
Fuck music, sell shirt screens
And I pull up to my rap show
In a Ford Focus, on 13s
And my nephews in the eighth grade
He only talks about bayblade
And my supermarket is Ralph's
On tour I'm looking for a Safeway
I'm a cantankerous old coot
A man, a blanket no phone booth
And this never bitten lint all or nothing
This ass naked as snow suit

[Hook: Nocando]
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)

[Verse 2: VerBS]
Squad is always full of haters
Me and flocka puff trees
Like Bob Marley and the Wailers
Thick white girls
They must of came from Decatur
I got the ill vibe I got
The bay area flavor
That's how I open up all these hot bars
I'm out of this world nigga
Yeah I'm something like I'm a Mark Clark, ooh
I started rapping off
The walls of Crenshaw
Back in the day I call that, yo
Leimert parkour
Picked up the times
I blow niggas ran mouths
Indie darlin', pardon my grand smile
On this marathon jog
I'm going to stand out
Opportunities open up
It's a plus if you dope as fuck
And you rhyme like

[Hook: Nocando]
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)

[Interlude]
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon

[Verse 3: Nocando]
Yuh
Icarus, niggerish
Genesis, Leviticus
Candy flippin' the Lawrence Fishburne crimson
With that clear pill Limitless
In Bristol sipping Guinesses
Hard to handle like
Life with a wife and ten kids
And six different mistresses (Woo!)
This shit is getting ridiculous
Niggas are getting so sensitive
Forgive me for my insolence
I ain't really into this
I got a new view through a new scope
I'ma be frank like the new pope
I don't give a fuck if them dudes dope
It's Hellfyre, eat a dick 'til you dudes choke

[Verse 4: KAIL]
My neighbors are pigs
So we don't speak when we I grab the mail
My neighbors are pigs
So if my crowbar snaps a tail
I'm fast as hell
And there ain't no catching KAIL
But, catch me if you can
Frank Abagnale, pass the snail
But, we just gon' discount that as rails
Until they're on my traffic trail
And know how this package smell
Long as you packin' cells
I pack the nail from the coffin
That sends your rat ass back to hell
Bitch!

[Hook: Nocando]
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)
This that Dorner (too soon)
That Newtown (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock
That god dammit that's (too soon)

[Verse 5: Busdriver]
Yeah
Niggas say my catalogue's too YMCA
Not enough YMCMB, and my life plan reeks of fresh brie
Yuh (Oh shoot!)
Like I'm a white man on a ten speed
Like I'm in Thailand living rent free
All I ever need the mic stand, that's what the rats see
My soc' should never overshare
Look the hood calling me weird
'Cause my shit could weaponize the open air
Yelp alerts could be heard in ear buds
Believe in {?} with road flares
This shit is barely a beer buzz
You're gonna stare at us like you leer at jugs
Or apply there and buy share
I'm like "Hi there" and I'ma buy this Paris
On the pulmonary palimpsest
Feedin' niggas in high chairs
With an Allen wrench
No fashion sense from the Karmaloop
I'm the big dog man, call me Marmaduke
Might think tanks more than the [?] crew
Make the uninitiated barf and puke
We beside the finest from some smashed atoms
While ratchet hoes do tableaus
'Til they suffer from back spasms
We clown backstage like Patch Adams
Took the game with us like backgammon
Press pass and test labs as my best gags
It sounds like crash landings

[Verse 6: Rheteric Ramirez]
And they knew I was crazy without getting drunk
And you thinking I'm tipsy
I kept it one hundred, I've never been fifty percent
Or fifty one fifty
The shit I see on the news, though
Got me feeling chaotic neutral
Put yourself in my shoes, though
What you think Tookie and Dorner would do, bro?
Better check that [?]
I got some gangster shit that'll make you
Blow your grey matter into a fuckin' handkerchief
Cause this is operation Repo
To take L.A. back from people
That wanna make dark skin friends
Without crossing Pico
If I forced you to take the bus to places you're scared to drive to
Would reality coincide with what you
Buy on iTunes?
They say we rose from the ashes after riots
But I wouldn't believe it
Saying that is like burning the wing of a dove
And calling that shit a phoenix
The cost of living that empty coffin
'Cause death is an empty wallet
This isn't the petty problems
Of bitches and Mary Poppins
Whenever the henny is callin'
Give a fuck if my enemies talkin'
Destiny though will never be broke
Fo' sho' that's been My War like Henry Rollins

[Outro: Busdriver]
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
Too soon
