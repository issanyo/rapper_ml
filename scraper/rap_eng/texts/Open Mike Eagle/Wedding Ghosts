So don't invite me to your wedding (yeah)
You didn't invite me to your funeral
So I'm not gonna be on time (yeah)
You didn't invite me to your funeral
So don't invite me to your wedding (yeah)
You didn't invite me to your funeral
So I'm not gonna be on time (yeah, yeah)

No backflips and no somersaults
And I'm gonna toss
Every invite that I come across
And Imma fight this shit like an underboss
(Yeah, yeah)
Some guilt there but it won't grow
Heart broken, I don't know
You can ask me if I'm gon' go but
I recommend that you don't though
And I don't care who gon' be there
You can save that shit for a single man
I'mma sit here in my studio, elbows deep in a Pringles can (yeah)
Instincts say run, run from you
I’d be so uncomfortable
Everything's so combustible
I don't even know one Huxtable
I'm not gon' front front for you, no subterfuge
Why I can't play bum bumbershoot
And I'm tryna write a dumb something new
(Yeah, yeah)
This must be some kinda joke
Saw that big dumb envelope
Might have looked like maybe I was down
I had my foot on the ropes
(Yeah)
I was blinking in
Thought I was down, now think again
When you brought it up, I was blinking in
Thought I was down, now think again
(Yeah)
Got a limited time on earth
So what's your side show worth
I’ll watch your slide show first
Yeah I'm bogus, I'm Joe Dirt
Yeah, Yeah
After all
Let's play some tag or basketball
If it's collared shirts or slacks involved
Y'all can keep the dress code that's for y'all
You ain't go to mine
I ain't know you then
Ain't known you long
Ain't no new friends
Yeah we all get it, so you go with him
You go with her
So let's smoke some herb and
Let's order chicken and baked potatoes
Smoke the weed
And just play some Halo
Please, oh please, don't make me fake bro
I say all this cause I hate to say no (hate to say no)

So don't invite me to your wedding
