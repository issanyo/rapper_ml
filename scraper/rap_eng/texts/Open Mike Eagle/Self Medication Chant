Shit. I fucked around and left the gate open
Sometimes im on point, sometimes my brain's broken
Like a dolphin and a carp share the same ocean
Sometimes im space ghost and other times beethoven
At least by the hairdo
My twin in rocking naps that combs can't tear through
Stocking cap? no but a skull navy bears blue
And orange
In fond memories all the stress gets absorbed
My homies all fresh but the press kids ignore
I stretch then I yawn then my legs hit the floor
Can't stress bullshit no more
The earth is a disco ball
So I just go la

If it ain't great then forget the shit
I make shit so weird my muse shakes her head at it
(never quit)
I float on my ocean
The motion of the waves won't cave to commotion

Im unchained, not a slave but devoted
I can't be contained, got a name and I know it

Maintain, not a claim but an action word
Forward force is the same as a pachyderm's

Keep it reserved so it came off taciturn
But in my head its a chainsaw massacre

Sometimes I gotta sing la so im not obscene
So I won't forget that humans are not machines

Every moment is a yank on a slot machine
No matter who your god is, rank or philosophy

The whole concept of laws is a prank
Makes you think you can put it on pause but you can't

Knee trouble stomach pain
Patchy face stubble
Kid's snot bubble running again
Pretend everything's fine
When I'm climbing the walls
Tylenol days
Night spent roaming the hall
There's no laws to the universe
Those have all been human birthed
Noted it all in web crawls for a google search
Google earth jupiter's spot
The block's lucifer hot
Iâ€™m not super sure who's a pure
Human or not
I box shadows
And dream about tobacco
And og blacks that got choked with a lasso
And roped to a lamp pole
Shown as examples
Of how easily a man's world can get cancelled
A handful of sun-spins passed
And now the last of the oral storytellers
Know nothing but horror stories
No glorious warriors tales
No inspiring titans fighting monsters
Or conquering environments
No. nothing but loss
Keep the baton, pops dont bother dustin it off
Cause there won't be no more running
Cause after this moment right here and right now
There'll be nothing at all
