Your boy Alan Greenspan
Does the best that he can
To walk away from this mess with clean hands
He cut interest rates to the floor and shit
Supporting the lending of sub-prime mortgages
To people far too poor to afford the shit
Yeah, on the surface sure it seems great
Giving poor folks a road into real estate
But don't get comfortable, wait
The payments start to rise its adjustable rate
Lenders flip 'em like they're hustlin' weight
Sell the debt from your apartment on foreign markets
The predatory mortgage started without the hint of a down payment
Flippin' it sounds dangerous
And greedy investors flippin' promissory notes
On the hopes of future interest when the borrower is broke
This was the housing bubble, now
Hundreds of thousands struggle to fight foreclosure
And moreover the big banks take a spanking
They came from caked up to bankrupt tanking
Institutions the world's banks depend on
Gone like the companies WorldComm and Enron
Now here comes the crazy part
The feds starts to bail em out days apart
Instead of folding em and scolding em
The US government bank takes control of em
The same folks that insisted to keep the rates low on the interest
And told the banks to go rape folks and pillage and make those millions
Knowing it would fail
Now they slide in low to control em with bail out
They should go under the jailhouse for economic devastating
Calculating lehman, stearnes, and merrils failing
But they're out para-sailing with Sarah Palin
