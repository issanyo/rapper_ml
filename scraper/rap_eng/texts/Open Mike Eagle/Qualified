[Intro]
Am I qualified, qualified?
Am I qualified, qualified?
Am I qualified, qualified?

[Verse 1: Sammus]
I’m staring into his eyes
And he’s the most beautiful person I’ve ever met
Then my burdens arrive
They’re killing my vibe
Burning inside like a cigarette
Figured that he will not want to be intimate
I tell him sometimes I’m not into men
He says, “That’s okay
You’re wonderful like a bouquet!”
And then we climb into bed
We hug and we kiss a lot
And it hits the spot
I tell him I love him
He tell me he love me
I tell him to get in my tummy
I’m yelling “I’m cumming!”
But it’s more than the sex—he claims that I’m great that I’m really amazing
But a couple more days in, I dunno, will he still say the same thing?

[Hook: Sammus]
Am I qualified, qualified?
Am I qualified, qualified?
Hell if I know
But I’m terrified you
Will uncover my soul
And I’ll run inside
Then I’ll wanna hide
Wonder what did I do?
Wonder what did I do?

[Verse 2: Sammus]
Am I qualified? Check my qualifiers
Like I’m Open Mike... but I’m hella tired
In terms of my music things seem to be going okay but I’m not really sure
Like what if I lose it?
How will I know what I’m making is not some manure?
I lock myself in peeking under the doors
Yes I will admit that it’s tough to endure
The feeling I might hit a ceiling
Revealing that it won’t be long 'til the cracks start appearing
I’m filling the holes like the backs of an earring
'Til slowly it grows and the gaps is apparent
My fans will stage a big a coup d’etat
They’re chanting, they’re yelling, “Oh you a flop!”
Then they chew me out like I’m food for thought
I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop

[Hook: Sammus]
Am I qualified, qualified?
Am I qualified, qualified?
Hell if I know
But I’m terrified you
Will uncover my soul
And I’ll run inside
Then I’ll wanna hide
Wonder what did I do?
Wonder what did I do?

[Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle]
Why would I guess?
What if the answer is yes?
Then if they’re impressed
Then why would I stress?
'Cuz questioning keeps me depressed
Reaching a deepening mess
'Cuz weak is the flesh but flesh is what’s here though
My soul’s an invisible hero
When I need something real in my earholes
'Cuz my positive feelings is zero
And I feel like I’m 300 years old
Got a weird cold and the fear folds
Me in different dimensions
I’m bigger than what I appear though
If the beer’s cold
Then I’m drinking it 'cuz it lets me hold
When I’m thinking that different people
Have been given the picks for the keyholes
When we knowing that shit is ridiculous
Dang!

[Hook: Sammus]
Am I qualified, qualified?
Am I qualified, qualified?
Hell if I know
But I’m terrified you
Will uncover my soul
And I’ll run inside
Then I’ll wanna hide
Wonder what did I do?
Wonder what did I do?
