[Verse 1]
(check, yeah)
We was walking away
Repeated all we can say
Depart with a hug
And it's a public display
Like a dozen a day
Walking, we plugging away
At it, I'm running away
Cause O'Doyle’s is closed
And it never was closed
So I'm never exposed
When I'm hella morose
Cause I'm telling 'em no-
-body, my skeleton shows
With it's elephant nose
And it's pelican bones
Watch how I carry it home

[Bridge]
Cause the story it goes
There’s a spork in the road
And we got to the bar
But then O'Doyle’s was closed
And it never was closed
Even whenever it snowed
Every night it was there
Either there or a show
Every answer is there
Every question is no
Never questioned before
So we guessing it's home

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody’s secrets inspire all of my scenes
I write in all of my fantasies and I die in all of my dreams
My superpowers I maintain
I take control of my scene
Y'all should see what I can't say
I can't say all I done seen

[Hook]
I done told
Some goofy shit that sounded like a poem
I spun around in circles on the globe
So who the hell could ever feel at home
I done told
Some goofy shit that sounded like a poem
I spun around in circles on the globe
So who the hell could ever feel at home

[Verse 2]
Yeah
We live in a space that should have never existed
We’re used to the taste of a human in space
We ruined the room only a few could replace it
And Doyle’s is closed
I'm avoiding my nose
It smells like if you imagined you boiled a rose
And the oven is on and the coil’s exposed
And we pulling the door
Like we did it before
And now we’re trying to deal with heat that we shouldn't absorb

[Bridge]
And the story it goes
There’s a spork in the road
And we got to the bar but then O'Doyle’s was closed
And it never was closed
Even whenever it snowed
Every night it was there
Either there or a show
Every answer is there
Every question is no
Never questioned before
So we guessing its home

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody’s secrets inspire all of my scenes
I write in all of my fantasies and I die in all of my dreams
My superpowers I maintain
I take control of my scene
Y'all should see what I can't say
I can't say all I done seen

[Hook]
I done told
Some goofy shit that sounded like a poem
I spun around in circles on the globe
So who the hell could ever feel at home
I done told
Some goofy shit that sounded like a poem
I spun around in circles on the globe
So who the hell could ever feel at home

I done told
Some goofy shit that sounded like a poem
I spun around in circles on the globe
So who the hell could ever feel at home
I done told
Some goofy shit that sounded like a poem
I spun around in circles on the globe
So who the hell could ever feel at home
I done told
Some goofy shit that sounded like a poem
I spun around in circles on the globe
So who the hell could ever feel at home
