[Verse 1]
When I get nervous say something relatable
I'm hella relatable
That's hella legit and not really debatable
I live in your neighborhood
That guy you shit talkin' is right there in back of you
So try to act natural
Remember that movie, they all gonna laugh at you
It's so understandable
Sometimes when I'm social I feel incompatible
I live in the capital
I live in the forest, it's green and it's magical
I live international
I am not rational
Damn it I'm just so illogical
I don't wear a monocle
I don't know which sequels are truly canonical
I'm sorry don't follow you
I promise I truly and really remember you
I'm not just pretending to
I'm trying to distinguish between individuals
And I'm feeling invisible
I promise I'm truly and really relatable
I'm watching Undateable
I fuck with millennials, cutting my cable too
As soon as I'm able to
I'm super relatable, super accessible
I'm super accessible
Just look at my calendar, look at my schedule
Monday is incredible
Some people are dummies, but I'm intellectual
I'm just like the rest of you
My garbage disposal is stuck on a vegetable
I should call the professional
Man, y'all look incredible, damn

[Verse 2]
Yo, when I get nervous say something relatable
I'm hella relatable
That's hella legit and not really debatable
I live in your neighborhood
And I'm so political, hella political
I'm super political
I live in the hood and my city gets difficult
'Cause they treat us like criminals
Let's set up an interview, how'd you get into you?
You such an original
I know 'cause I judge other people, I'm cynical
I'm kind of uncomfortable
I hate when I'm late 'cause I try to be punctual
I do what I wanna do
I do what you want me to
I'm super uncomfortable
I did what I want
At the end of the day it was too irresponsible
