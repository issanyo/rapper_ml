[Verse 1]
You are not an animal
The magic in your movements is certainly not mechanical but human
More than just a loopin' in a manual
The luminous intangible glowing of your existence
Can't be duplicated in laboratory infants
Though what the so-called writers in media stories invent
Their intent: to increase the revenue percentage
By the ---- nervousness
Translatin' hatin' through paper through ratings flourishes
Encouraging copy-catters to keep the cycle 'round
Corporations wanting a garbage recycled sound
It's the final round and the judges have been corrupted
They've already decided we're rubbish
Tiny nuggets to be hidden from the sight of the public
Just another lousy challenge to the balance of budgets
And yo their palpitating hearts resolve to callus and Bunyan
As their little children locked up in their palaces dungeon
But how they function

[Chorus]
I think they got a brain disease
They think that every brother is the same as me
When everything up in your brain is make believe
I represent the difference you're afraid to see
C'mon

[Verse 2]
If your music diet's restricted to poppy slow jams
And bubble-gummy rappers the station director programs
Then you'll think every rapper's a sociopath or dope man
With pockets full of dope and some whiskey like Lindsey Lohan
No ma'am
That's why I laugh and you complain of
Deranged thug brothers that smother you up in lame clubs
You spend your whole lifetime running behind the same stud
Then call us all dogs, that we're all sharing the same blood
Your choices in music matching your men game
Making your decisions on what your ignorant friends say
A grown ass woman bumping the music that kids play
All that repititions the definition of insane
(That shit is nuts) A sort of interesting note
You swear to god that you're sick of being bitches and hoes
But when you hear those independent cats with different flows
You stick up your nose, like homie why you listen to those

[Chorus]
I think they got a brain disease
They think that every brother is the same as me
When everything on video is make believe
I represent the difference you're afraid to see
C'mon

[Verse 3]
I'm writing you again
You're tireless, inspiring you to win
Let's help you settle right into your skin
People say that nothing is as mighty as a pen
So I hope that I provide at least the tiniest of gems
I'm trying this again since you're feeling like an alien
And no one else is moving to the beat inside your cranium
Necessary feelings buried deep in the uranium
I cut a little piece so I can reach into your radians
Let me remind you of your brilliance
A picture becomes the sharpest without the darkness fillin it
The glow that creates a carcass out of your largest nemesis
Resulting from the glow and to connect the carbon filaments
