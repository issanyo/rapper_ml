It's so good to have you back
To provide us all with that bass
Especially after you finish cookin' that bass

I always been a hungry nigga
The type to set a whole entire country into a frenzy hold up
Whatever niggas wanna do, niggas wanna try
Fuck it, I'm better than the best of them
King Kong and Godzilla mixed up together
While I'm blessing them
It's wrong for niggas to mix us together
Cus I'm better than every fucking body
You should remember that I never been lesser
Always fresher I'm upgrade and bitch constantly mutilating foes
And outshining their favorite
Probably boost the ratings while I'm changing and rearranging the climate
I'm the fucking pilot
Silence, I'm so amazing and so spectacular
The way I sparkle like fireworks then I cause a massacre
And make you feel how the fire hurts
See the dungeon dragon has returned RAWRRR, look
Then I come one after the other then BLAOWW, before the hook
Then I see how the people's amazed and astonished by what I do
Cause I see how the heater just blaze and I tarnish up other dudes
Then I see what I feed to make niggas just WOWW when I'm coming through
Indeed I plant a seed that'll make 'em DROWNN when they get the news
That yes I am the best and unless you could replace
Cause I only deal with facts and the truth is in your face

I got bass (coke)
Every line is (dope)
The type of shit that make 'em feign and had 'em thirsty to (smoke)
I got a funky fresh (car)
And a funky fresh (broad)
I'm a funky fresh (star)
And I'm up to (par)
You see the trunk got bass
Yeah the pots got bass
All the niggas on the block they be dealin' that bass
You see the trunk got bass
I flood the hood with the bass
I'm bringin' the sprinklers out
Even when there's a drought
I got bass
I got bass
I got bass
I got bass

This should be soundin' like a thousand mosquitoes buzzing like hmhmmmhmmhmhmhm
I got you niggas buggin' like fucking zombies is coming
And dumbing and losing it
Got a fucking army that's gunnin' and running for rulership
I'm in a fucking party with something that's stunning' and cute as shit
I don't play with none of you dummies
Who the fuck is you foolin' with
Then I count and sum up my money
Niggas know how I do this shit
Then I bounce and I run through the country
Then I come with a slew of hits that'll massacre the planet
Obliviating the earth
And diabolically smashing everything for whatever it's worth
It's Busta Rhymes godfather beast boy emperor
This rap shit coming to get the bread
Gimmie my cash, quick so that I can be malice
You niggas now running telling do it
So I can reblanket the town with the epidemic
I got a flow that cause cancers
Better call up the paramedics
And it'll complicate blood circulation in diabetics
A lot of hateful niggas try to put my pockets on diuretics
But NAHH we don't allow them things
You and your mans can get it as you complicate the flow
To full drive when I feed my pushers then
Spit a dart like natives livin' in bushes

I got bass (coke)
Every line is (dope)
The type of shit that make 'em feign and had 'em thirsty to (smoke)
I got a funky fresh (car)
And a funky fresh (broad)
I'm a funky fresh (star)
And I'm up to (par)
You see the trunk got bass
Yeah the pots got bass
All the niggas on the block they be dealin' that bass
You see the trunk got bass
I flood the hood with the bass
I'm bringin' the sprinklers out
Even when there's a drought
I got bass
I got bass
I got bass
I got bass
