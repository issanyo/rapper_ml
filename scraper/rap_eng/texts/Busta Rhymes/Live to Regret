Album: Set It Off (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)
Song: Live To Regret

Ha, Ha, Ha, Uh, Yeah, Yeah
While we hit you with another one of them old phenomenal shits
Nineteen-ninety-six, that nigga comes through with another one of them fucking ill ones
Busta Rhymes in the place to be, Flipmode Squad
Y'all motherfuckers keep it right here
You know how it's going down son
Blow the spot up, one shot
Yo check it out

Aeiyo son, I get busy each and every day
Freaky different shit make you bounce around your way
So many niggas just fade away
Talking shit on mics with nothing to say
When I display freaky bump shit you wanna say
Hit you off, make you and your peoples wanna stay
Yo, who be that nigga that be coming through?
That's me, mountain climb mics just for a few (ha, ha, hoo)
Tell me just what you wanna do
Hit with more shit that make you feel brand new
Steady solid gold posting like Marilyn Macoo
Suckers suffocating till their faces turn blue
You don't have a clue, of the proper number of my crew
How we shoot the spit-shine on niggas like a pair of shoes
Any time you wanna set it off
I'mma make sure that you all live to regret it

Chorus:
Don't you do something that will catch up with you
Watch your back before you die
Don't you do something that you live to regret
Or feel the heat so bad baby
Don't you do something that will catch up with you
Watch your back before you die
Don't you do something that you live to regret
Or feel the heat so bad baby

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Huh! Yo!
I be the absolute wicked and that's your first warning
When you start falling, my name you will be calling
Who's that?
You wake up to every single morning, that's me
Busta Rhymes with the loudest talking
Living to regret what they did to you, stay talking
Talking shit you better watch how you be walking
Coming through so that you all can really see
Rhyme after me, bring you back to reality
Ha, check your self nigga
Just count from one to three
Then I hit you off with another new stylee
A-hee, A-hee-hee
Dedicated to MC
Break you off something with so much new ferocity
So hot, I will burn off your calories
Chase you all down like I was your worst enemy
Better believe this nigga set it
Fuck around and I'mma make sure that you all live to regret it

Chorus:
Don't you do something that will catch up with you
Watch your back before you die
Don't you do something that you live to regret
Or feel the heat so bad baby
Don't you do something that will catch up with you
Watch your back before you die
Don't you do something that you live to regret
Or feel the heat so bad baby

Yo, yo, yo, yo
I be that nigga that you can't see
Breaking shit down in all actuality
All y'all niggas who misbehave
Better count your blessings or make your grave
Uh, this goes out to all the ones who talk trash
Bring the noise nigga, we will bust your ass
If you really wanna set it off
I'mma make sure that you all live to regret it

Chorus:
Don't you do something that will catch up with you
Watch your back before you die
Don't you do something that you live to regret
Or feel the heat so bad baby
Don't you do something that will catch up with you
Watch your back before you die
Don't you do something that you live to regret
Or feel the heat so bad baby
