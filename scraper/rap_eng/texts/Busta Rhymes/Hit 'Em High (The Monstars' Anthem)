[Intro: Coolio]
Greeting, earthlings
We have now taken over your radio

[Chorus: Method Man]
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Going straight to the
Hole, you ain't got no game
I'm breaking ya out the frame, coming through like a train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew taking all control
You can't get none of this, we're running this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this
Get out the lane, I'm coming through and if you don't
Wanna move then I'm coming right through you

[Verse 2: Coolio]
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust, now your whole crew is dust
Coming through my area, I'mma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range go tell me who wanna tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real & Method Man]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

[Chorus: Method Man]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Insane like a runaway train, I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed—ah—, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange megalomaniacal
Monster in the game and I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep coming
Down like rain, you feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you. Pass me the
Rock, now I'm headed to the basket, get up out my
Way is what you better do, my tactics is unsports-
-Manlike conduct, you better ask it. Don't get
No better than this, you catch my drift? (drift?) You get stripped by
Ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer (whoa), danger
You're dealing with official hoop-bangers with hang time
Like a coat hanger, jump with thunderous
360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk (funk)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Uh, lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessing and moves is animated (uh)
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated (nah)
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is getting money (money, money)
When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies
Uh, every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm 'bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness, uh? (no doubt, uh)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money, or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay
Lounging in the mothership back around my way, uh (uh)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I getting lyrical? Daddy, I think so
Monstar dropping flavor fluid so drink slow

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (yeah, run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (ah, hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war, turn the music up, please!)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (ah, yah, before)

[Chorus: Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, God bless, pick up your chest (uh, uh)
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed balling on the fast break just like the pony express (ooh-uh)
I'm gon' mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game, you and your team
Just need to back off (hah), get off my block, give me the ball
I said it's my rock (hah), I'm starting a line-up by getting y'all to
Bring the livestock (hah), throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot (hah)
When we come right through, tell me what you really gon' do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip (huh)
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams
Like crash cars, who do they be? They be the Monstars!

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore
(what is she talking about? hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

[Chorus: Method Man]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
