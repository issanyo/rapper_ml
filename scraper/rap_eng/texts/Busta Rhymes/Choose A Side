Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

I'm back on my Beethoven shit now
Yeah
J-Doe...!

[Chorus:J-Doe]
Cops and robbers
Cowboys and Indians
Better choose a side
Cause you know
How we get it in
See them boys live for you
If they let 'em in
It's gon' be problems
For a nigga if I get 'em in
Cause when the smoke clears
You prolly wonder
What you lookin' at
It's either my side
Or your side
Nigga, what you gon' do?

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I apply direct pressure
To stop the bleeding
You probably should
Tighten the cloth
We blow to rupture arteries
Undescribable force
Niggas be lookin more bitch
Than a dyke in a Porsche
Cannons'll cut your whole click
Like I'm slicin' a pork
Retaliation's at it's best
When you challenge a boss
Know what side you're on
Cause it could cost
(It's either my side
Or your side
Nigga what you gon' do?)
Ok, no need to wonder
Who one of the best be
To tell the truth
If you ain't wit' me
You must be against me
But I got that thing for Mo'fuckers
So go 'head and tempt me
And have 'em saying
"Damn, the Devil has
Sent you to get me!"
From how temperature change
From squeezing the metal empty
Until you make a pussy squirt
Like the back of a jet ski
And if you wanna know how stupid get
You can meet him first
If you don't properly choose
Who you movin' wit'

[Chorus: J-Doe]
Cops and robbers
Cowboys and Indians
Better choose a side
Cause you know
How we get it in
See them boys live for you
If they let 'em in
It's gon' be problems
For a nigga if I get 'em in
Cause when the smoke clears
You prolly wonder
What you lookin' at
It's either my side
Or your side
Nigga, what you gon' do?

[Verse 2: Aaron Cooks]
I'm on a pill
Drinkin' Duce
Million in the suitcase
Ten-thousand hundreds
All blue-faced
Wrist gold, whip game, VMV
Whatchin' Busta on TMZ
Rubber-banded B-U-N-D-L-Es
Then no [?]
Conglomerate money
Bitch I'm G-O-D
Jack Thriller
Keep one eye on niggas
Plottin' on me
(It's either my side
Or your side
Nigga what you gon' do?)
No-Limit vision
I see murda in the booth
Feel like Remy, Higher Learning,
Hittin' models on the roof
Thousand [?] Cuban
Hangin' like Mr. Cooper
Drippin in the Michael J. Fox [?]
And I'm the future
Snatch yo ghost out yo face
That Killer B shit
Ste-vie shit
Keys move
You just ain't see shit
Spikes on Louis Vuittons
That LOD shit
Came up off coco
S-W-V shit

[Chorus: J-Doe]
Cops and robbers
Cowboys and Indians
Better choose a side
Cause you know
How we get it in
See them boys live for you
If they let 'em in
It's gon' be problems
For a nigga if I get 'em in
Cause when the smoke clears
You prolly wonder
It's either my side
Or your side
Nigga, what you gon' do?

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Security levels should heighten
Being that I got the license
To silence; I'm bullish
With appetites for bitin' the curb
And bitin' the bullet
Bright in the moment
Like a light and it's strikin' the footage
Like bluffin' a bastard wit'a ratchet
To excite him then pull it
Now nigga could it
End up being that nigga
That's what you talkin bout
Poppin' but couldn't
(It's either my side
Or your side
Nigga what you gon' do?)
Alright, Most of the time
I know this shit's annoyin'
Cause when you can't beat 'em
See most you niggas try to join 'em
I'm Def Leppard
And I ain't tryin' to hear the noise ,and
Most of you dudes don't have a choice
When I hit 'em with the poison
Get reacquainted with the ones you lost
So you can join 'em
My pen extremely dangerous
The way [?]
Ha, and while most of you better hide
Or either slide, make a proper choice
Before picking a side nigga

[Chorus: J-Doe]
Cops and robbers
Cowboys and Indians
Better choose a side
Cause you know
How we get it in
See them boys live for you
If they let 'em in
It's gon' be problems
For a nigga if I get 'em in
Cause when the smoke clears
You prolly wonder
What you lookin' at
It's either my side
Or your side
Nigga, what you gon' do?
