[Intro: DJ Khaled & T-Pain]
I’m for real about this shit, this the remix (welcome to my hood, hee) let’s go, remix, remix, remix
(Where ya hood at, where ya hood at, where ya hood at)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it, ugh
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy (YMCMB)
Welcome to my hood, where they gettin' fly like a G6
And everybody know this is the remix
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on yo knees
(Woop, woop) that’s the sound of the police in my hood

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Everybody on the corner with the work
Slangin & bangin in front of that liquor store
Blowin money cause I live life fast
With this bottle fulla yak, I’ma sip this slow
Singles double when triple beams take over
Now holla cause they Impalas got extreme makeovers
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street now
Wear the wrong color and catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is quotin’ scriptures
While Luda's getting head, more gums than baby pictures
Cock my 40 Glock and my partna just bought a replica
Now Asians sayin they don’t keep no cash in they register (hurry up and buy)
We run from red and blue lights to get that green
But whoever got that white is winning like Charlie Sheen

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Teddy Pain (Teddy Pain) bad man (bad man)
Mix shots, boom (boom) boom (boom) boom (bang)
Man we the best never the less, you know we get it hot
Fire flame-flame, fire-fire flame
Put me on the track and I’m a really let a muthafucka feel it
When I do it, how I do it, what I do (do)
If a nigga really wanna test, come and test
You can bet that I’ma eat em all day (fuck food)
850 what I represent, Tallahome Florida president
Me & DJ Khaled got these haters lookin hesitant
So keep all that wackness out my ear
(Pew, pew) That’s the sound of your career in my hood

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you niggas got your ringside seats, cause it’s whoopass season
Comin to a hood near you, everybody know what happen when you see me comin (Back up!)
I be hurdling & gotcha reguritating & murdering everything gun shots bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
Ya’ll know what it is, I’m coming to get it & others are blocking
I’m runnin the hood and nothin can top it
You can Google it and you can search it
On how a nigga come and unlock it, impossible to stop it
More fire, thunder, pain, I go and heed the villain, he’s adrenaline poppin
Need a medical situation because the way I’m fuckin everything until I’m peepin it
Why you tryna do what you already know that I’m the king with it
And, you don’t wanna come behind me with it bro
Uggh, I killed this shit I ain’t gotta rhyme no more

[Verse 4: Twista]
Welcome to my hood where poor members of faculty backin me
If you ever try attackin me, that could be when I eat em
Especially when I beat em, when they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me
I’m an anomaly to em, put em on crutches
We’ll sock ya lip first for you touch us, he one that’s kickin our brothas
Much as I smoke the duchess and model chicks that cut us
And muthafuckas that love us, their enemies wanna touch us
I’m a spit a flow as if it was a sin, then the gangstas are restin forever
See a solid 4, then I’m a put it on the fin
Then you know to never test, it’ll be a category F5
Handle military with automatic weapon so let’s ride
Love to the honeys, and everybody that runnin the north
And they whole city from the westside

[Verse 5: Mavado]
Welcome to the gully where we not take bad up
Big Spliff in my hand and Hennessy in my cup
You see the gal them we have up is like some angel adopt, them fat and grab up
You hear me when you pass the gate written at the entrance violate
A straight death sentence to live you must be great
To be a snake know repentance
We coming at you with vengeance

[Verse 6: DJ Khaled]
Never slippin', I’m ballin, Puff keep on callin
I don’t see none of you pussies, fuck that shit you be talkin
Rep Miami the ghettos (Dade County), every hood and the projects
And when I drop off my singles, I’m droppin one of my targets
Lord forgive me for my sins, I gave you hits
I gave you "All I Do Is Win", I live this shit
And, we the best, it’s no pretend
I touch a million, throwin hundreds in this bitch

[Verse 7: Birdman]
Real real nigga numba 1, hustle fly with my son
I come from uptown, G5 tommy gun
Red flag everyday, hundred mil ready to spray
Swagged out nigga, Bugatti with the paper plate
Blowin on some good nigga, feelin good nigga
Stunna island, Me & Khaled on the wood nigga
You understand, shinin like I know we should
Birdman YMCMB we good nigga

[Verse 8: Ace Hood]
Ace Hood in this bitch ho, kickin down in yo front door
Knock knock, you hear the Glock cock and that thing pop on the 4 4
Posted up in that same block, I’m in the drop top with that bank roll
Young nigga, I’m out here, can’t name a place I can’t go
Ridin round with my 50 grand and they wonder what do that safe hold
Middle finga them feds and that’s why I pledge a part of my G code
And fuck them prosecutors, hustla connoisseur
It’s we the best forever, make sure you spread the rumor bitch

[Verse 9: Fat Joe]
Good coke, hard ride stashes in the bodyshop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggas gettin left right in front of the marble precinct
Leave em like them Jordans, red dot leakin
I’m 15 when I first startin coppin pies
You 46 just turnin blood, stop it 5
It’s like the only way to make it is supplyin things
Hoop dreams dunkin over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse 10: Game]
It’s that black raw, black dawg pullin up on that black home
Compton that’s my backyard, that’s where I used to get them sacks off
But, now I got platinum plaques in the back of the 'Bach
And I’m back with Dre again, Aftermath
We the best, Me & Khaled, Dre & Em
Detox, RED, that’s back to the back
Step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga I’m so hood even tho I’m livin good
Niggas still in VIP strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks then it's back to the trap
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the lac
Red rum, if you try it niggas (Westside) throw it up now

[Verse 11: Jadakiss]
They knockin packs off, they lettin gats off
Medicate, benefit cards scratch off’s
Savin every dime, tryna choke a quarter
And they ain’t sellin crack, they sellin coke & water
Smokin or ya snortin, they coppin all the Jordans
Nothins more important, steal em if you can’t afford em
I’m gettin to the money, I need another comma
Some of em love the drama, more than they love they mama

[Verse 12: Bun B]
Welcome to the land of the trill
Where everybody walkin' with they hand on they steel
And, a model is a supply & demand any will
You went outta line with the wrong man then get killed
When ya damned if you will & damned if you won’t
Lotta dudes sayin that they can but they don’t
Lotta boys sayin that they G’s and they ain’t
Mess around, get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, and say what you do
For I come around ya hood, broad day with the crew
They got them fists, AR’s, AK’s and them twos
And they will gladiate all day, what it do
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it, to my G’s on lockdown
Stick with it, think I’m a stop reppin PAT, forget it

[Verse 13: Waka Flocka Flame]
Welcome to Clayton County, my house got surrounded
Enemies tryna drown me, but my hood still around me
Rookie of the year, no freshman cover
Shawty 16 years old, with 4 baby mothers
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET
And, since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on the TV
Everyday is a party on Grove Street

[Outro: DJ Khaled - talking]
‘We The Best Forever’, June 28th. It's gon' be a hot summer
