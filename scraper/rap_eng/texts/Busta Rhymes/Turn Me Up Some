[Intro: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]
(Barking) Yeah (Turn me up some)
Fuck goin' on; yo Uncle Darren, what up brother
Yeah, yeah
Flipmode!
See we got a whole...
We got a gift-wrapped package for you motherfuckers
Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yeah
Bust it

[Verse 1]
I stay rippin' a nigga tracks so
Hotter than wax, yo, so tell me why you act so
Yo, I max 'cause I make a nigga black 'til its time to relax yo
Until you all collapse so, fuck it
It's hardly that the god is getting tired
You don't wanna say that
Can catch a cardiac relapse, nigga
What, the god is back so you don't want nuthin'
No matter how you react
Blows that black and blue your front and your back
Choose, whatever the route that you choose
Wounds so horrendous forensics will get to analyzing the bruise
Blows will never come in singular, they coming in twos
My crew be starting the ruckus once I give them the cues
To blast from the triggers that'll bust from all of my dudes
Be the shit that make you niggas run up out of your shoes
We make you back down, having the facts down
With all the noise you be making you can even see the shit on the news
Word up

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]
So you don't know nuthin' about it
(Barking...Turn me up some)
Yo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some
Yo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some
I'm sayin'
But you don't know nuthin' about it
(Barking...Turn me up some)
Yo, I drink a fifth of yack and hurl it up some
Yo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some
I'm sayin'...

[Verse 2]
Now watch me get a nigga fast, like them bitches with no ass
You corny niggas low class
Yo, I flash on them then I go and smash
Couple hoes and then splash on them
Flicking a little ash on them
From the blunt we smoking, keep a chick choking
Got them open with flows
I suppose it make them soak in their clothes
Keep the shit that make 'em sniff and make em open they nose
Got them fucked up, stuck just like they striking a pose
Yo, we gaining weight, nah, it's just my pockets are swole
From keeping niggas whylin' while they driving smacking the pole
Ah, one, two, yeah, see, perhaps, while I hold me a stack
Hater niggas block, holding me back
Yo, you fool niggas plotting against the god best be holding a strap
'Cause how we coming through, you know it's a wrap
Move with a crew of guerrilla dudes who know when to clap
I blow some shit from off of the Earth or the face of the map
Yo, so take that
Once we give it to you, ain't no faking a jack
It's funny how you find your face in a trap
Little bitch nigga fronting like he ready to scrap
You better off acting pussy trying to give me a dap
Staying focused on fulfilling a dream
The way we spark up and spit a fire, the flame probably killing your team
Fuck it, so now we harbor helicopters, turn this shit up
If you and your peoples ain't hearing me proper
I'm sayin...

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]
So you don't know nuthin' about it
(Barking...Turn me up some)
Yo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some
Yo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some
I'm sayin'
But you don't know nuthin' about it
(Barking...Turn me up some)
Yo, I drink a fifth of yack and hurl it up some
Yo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some
I'm sayin'...
