Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Charlie Brown]
Yeah, there's a Transformer
Topic of the tropic up on a corner
Babbling about he's slinging rocks on the block
With a knot, yell "Stop!"
Next (we have) it's (too bad)
Transformers on cue - gas
Try to say Brown is skin puller
Hitting nuff skins so relax, Ken
But no, gradually the stakes grip
Contradict, flip, trip and slip
Peekaboo I see you
(What you gonna do?)
From the shotgun to every other crook
Look at the book for the days of Turtle Hook
The one in the middle, bust this riddle
My laugh, ah, giggle
It took a longwinded one
To see what I've done, shine like a sun
I'm not mad because you get what you deserve
True your picture was kicked to the curb
Jeckyl and Hyde side, no pride, slide
On society's blind
Backstage underage, you're on
No credit when I said it, ah, transform

[Hook]
That ain't right, that ain't right, that ain't right
Peer pressure
That ain't right, that ain't right, that ain't right
Transformers

[Dinco D]
Hello my darling, hello my buddy, hello my old time pal
Switch the pitch from a curve to a straight ball
Vibes of tribes of people we call
(Formers!) Formers, Transformers
Robotic chaotic like daughters
Of cosmic shock, brain shock
Change the sundial, see the shadow clock
Time rewind, audio-visual
Don't record, keep invisible
And don't buy the apple that's rotten
Cos from New York to Europe, dealers has gotten
Evil, dropping, dime dropping
Backstabbing, crooked be whopping
Now somehow anyhow in '90
Two-faced misplaced by the bass just find me
Checking, one two mic checking
Or wrecking so step to the deck and yeah
Prepare, ask what's here
And transform

[Hook x2]

[Busta Rhymes]
How many many times (times) you (you) you try (try)
To front on this (this)
If you try to flip gonna get a whip aimed direct to them lips, bow!
Transformer see you around the corner
If you keep keep living like that you're gonna be a goner
I couldn't understand I'm a man on the right path
Try to front like I'm a stranger
That put up and pushed the kid
But then bumped his head and then caught amnesia
Said back to the facts and the truth and the wack ways
Of his fake character
You two-faced behind a fat steak only cutting your grass
It's a little bit shorter
Better chill-ch-chill and relax
That make the kids get broke backs
Wild 'bout a little brown sugar
Before you transformed I knew ya
You better identify some desire by self and understand self
Peer pressure made you a Transformer
You know what I'm saying?
Back to the rhythm in fact here I come
Want to follow wack kids go ahead act dumb
One day you'll awake and maybe see the light
Cos what I been saying my man my mellow check it out now huh!

[Hook x2]
