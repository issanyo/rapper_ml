[Intro: Busta Rhymes & Raekwon]
Aiyo, Shallah, what up?
Yeah, you know how we do it
Turn me up, kid, let's get it popping
Crazy, let's go get 'em killa
Yo Dre, good looking on this coke, man
This shit is official

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ayo, it's back to business, making them diskettes, pushing sixes
Rocking wild animals on jackets are sickening
Hear me? From here to Rockaway to Cali, we flipped this
Broad day, Chef'll saute, his lyrics is crispy
Now I got Dre up in the kitchen, Rae stuck in position
Bout to flame broil his coke and get busy
What? Politics, pop collars and drive violent whips
Stay fly, hungry and wise, you know the code, honor it
Sit back, yelling it's nothing, unless his buttons get pressed
We don't stress nothing, we only get dressed
Stretched out, moving professional, frying more fish
I heard it in slurs, them niggas is blessed
While we ball to the maximum, give me the floor, for real
I show off and let my money get stretched
Take it to a new level, new bezzle, few rebels
Few wolves with medals on, you know we get test

[Hook: Raekwon & Busta Rhymes]
Me, nigga, me, that's who, Cash Rule
Hah, better slow it down, niggas'll smash you, homie, uh
Me, nigga, me, pass through, rascals
Hah, half gorilla, half ape in them track suits, black, come on
Me, nigga, me, capsules, birds, whips
Ounces and fifths, no licking the glass, duke, yeah
Yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm here, so it's there, yea-yea-yea-yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Here comes the, a lethal presentation taking you places you never been
Deadlier than the combination of coke and heroin
I see the weakness in most of you niggas that be hollering
So I toned it down, so these words be piercing your lower obdomen
What I meant to say abdomen, keep on listening and following
While I'm ditecting a German, hateful niggas, chicks be swallowing
And if you look funny to me, and there's a problem then
I put you under an ultraviolet light or a halogen
As if I was busy deciphering counterfeit dollars and
Hoes in like some kind of Biblical figure, King Solomon
Hah, just for the record, what we do is essential
While I captivate the masses and keep the moments eventful
Doc Dre, Bust, Shallah Rae, see the vision?
Most you niggas still in disbelief, just came into fruition now
Pop the cork up off this bottle and you pour it
So euphoric, document this moment, shit is so historic

[Hook: Raekwon & Busta Rhymes]
Me, nigga, me, that's who, Cash Rule
Hah, better slow it down, niggas'll smash you, homie, uh
Me, nigga, me, pass through, rascals
Hah, half gorilla, half ape in them track suits, black, come on
Me, nigga, me, capsules, birds, whips
Ounces and fifths, no licking the glass, duke, yeah
Yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm here, so it's there, yea-yea-yea-yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
King of kings spit blood, all on my apron
Wash a nigga's face with the MAC, smoke them like Steak Umm's
Yeah my dynasty's brolic for real, we hunt, eat, catch the rat
Blow his waist, float in the stream
You know we all-pro with it, anti auto-tune
Boom, my flow fire, sit by the stove, hit it
Real niggas, official as listeners, gangstas and visitors
Step in the shit, we all prisoners
Might take the hammer from you, know I'm the animal
Rock a spur fur hat, no niggas in sandals, boo
Everyday get money and dress rugged, these are the times
Keep a nine on you, blow off in public
And I will surely feed my niggas the streets
Cop the hottest things to get, and haters they can eat and then preach
And while it go down, worldwide, this the team, this the theme
Me, Dre, Rhymes, my money makers is mean, what?

[Hook: Raekwon & Busta Rhymes]
Me, nigga, me, that's who, Cash Rule
Hah, better slow it down, niggas'll smash you, homie, uh
Me, nigga, me, pass through, rascals
Hah, half gorilla, half ape in them track suits, black, come on
Me, nigga, me, capsules, birds, whips
Ounces and fifths, no licking the glass, duke, yeah
Yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm here, so it's there, yea-yea-yea-yeah, yeah
