I stay turnt up like a stove with a t-kettle
Swag see it like a kid in the hospital
All that and your doe still a lot little
Pussy up bust a but spittin hot riddles
Like a dog off the leash when I say get

Get into the paper when I baseball hit em
Python bite yeah da boy sit bent em uh
What they talkin' about? Like big bros say we walkin

I'll fuck around and member put the park in the house
Propane flow I'm the spark of the south!
Bullseye, nigga yeah the target is out!
Errybody go to red carpet is out so high man

Make a nigga ears bleed till 'em it is critical niggas
Think they nice and yeah that shit is kinda typical
Till they be alone, and anyway in where they come from ???

Lookin' like a nigga still hustle on tha corner bossed up like a
Ceo time on her

Fuck around and be the first to get burnt up

Won't lose if a nigga try to feel me
Gotta betta off chainsaw hill freeze
Bad chick chop some weed up
In the back of the back main back with my feet up
Franklins like urethra shut the whole
Mall down with a swipe of the Visa!
Shades black can't walk up
Reeds game full of ice lot of cars like Tonka
My swag is awesome, awesome and I run it like Boston
Flashy like Rondeau
Got a bash full of bad girls sittin' in the condo
Twizzy half the head honcho shoutout
Cc ablejacks in da londo!
Six swags see the real whip past got
The chicks wanna to ride me like Six Flags
G4, G5 switchbacks
Gone in the earliest gone quick, fast!
Tell B roll it up like Nash
While I'm in the back countin' up this cash
Details swag put a pull up in the slap
Trot wave like I can't handle the clash!
