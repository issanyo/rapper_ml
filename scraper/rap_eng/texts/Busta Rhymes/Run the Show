[Verse 1: Kat De Luna]
Got you half flippin' like fire
Come with me, let me take you higher
I'm the object of all your desire
And your attention is all I require
Don't stop now, 'cause you on a roll
Make me go anywhere that you go
I'm that dream in your head when you're sleepin'
I'm that secret inside that you're keepin'

[Verse 2: Kat De Luna & (Busta Rhymes)]
Bite your lips cause you know that you feel it
When I shake it, you know you're addicted
I see you're lovin' this Dominicana
You like the way that I dance the bachata
Don't stop now, 'cause I'm on a roll
Give you that gutta you feel in your soul
My heart beats like a drum, can you hear it?
