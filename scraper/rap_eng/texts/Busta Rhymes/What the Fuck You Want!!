[Intro]
Flipmode motherfucker, Flipmode motherfucker
What the fuck you want, what the fuck nigga?
What you want, what the fuck nigga ?
(We gon hit it down like this. nigga what?)
Check it out

[Verse 1]
I be, testing your faith and wrecking your face, invading your space
And watch the tables turn like you're trading a place
I pull stunts like Evel Knievel, me and my people fly like an eagle
And blow your entire cathedral, hurry hurry, don't worry worry
Hit y'all with a flurry flurry of jabs, leaving y'all niggas blurry blurry
Brew up some shit like I'm cooking for y'all
When I'm done then I come looking for y'all
(Huh huh hold up hold up)
Federal cases cause nuff bodies end up in medical places
In they blood finding them chemical traces
Leaving special investigators going through skeptical phases
While we getting money the decimal changes
I was a Seventh Day Adventist apprentice
Now I strike with a vengeance
Blowing the door right up off of the hinges
This be that, "Put Your Out Of Your Misery" song
And make you ask your man is this the joint he dissing me on
That's when I ask

[Chorus]
What the fuck nigga what you want?
What the fuck nigga what you want?
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga

[Verse 2]
Moving your muscle and doing the hustle
See nowadays we getting money like Russell
Who really wanna tussle? Challenge the super saber in a nigga
Blast the challenger way out of space, like Galaga nigga
Battle star Galactica, cross my diameter nigga
Derange your whole circular shape, into triangular nigga
Yo, so what it was my fault?
That I had to bring this shit to a screaming halt?
What you need to do is open up the vault
That's why I make sure, that my vest will be on
So when I blast you, and your additional stress will be gone
Then I sprinkle just a little bit of salt, on your plans
And watch your shit shrivel up right in the palm of my hands
I ain't afraid of ya, but I thank all of my niggas for saving ya
I was about to take you back, to when your mother was making ya
Clapping you up, slapping you up, trapping you up
Holding you hostage, duck taping and Saran wrapping you up
Yo!, first she was sober, I smell aroma
Put you in a Trans, and slip into an irreversible coma
Fuck y'all cubic zirconium niggas, it's over
Closing in on all y'all niggas, while we're moving in a little closer Then I evaluate and elaborate, confiscate your shit
And dare your ass to retaliate, that's when I ask

[Chorus]
What the fuck nigga what you want?
What the fuck nigga what you want?
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga
What the fuck nigga what you want?
What the fuck nigga what you want?
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga
