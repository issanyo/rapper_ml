And this side chick game ain't, ain't what it used to be
This side chick game ain't, ain't what it used to be

[Hook]
They call him "Captain Save-Hoe"
'Cause he comin', not even gonna know
He doesn't know he's
Not-not-not supposed to save these hoes
Not supposed to save them
Not supposed to save them
Not supposed to save these hoes
And this side chick game ain't, ain't what it used to be (No, no)
So they call him "Captain Save-Hoe"
'Cause he comin', not even gonna know
He doesn't know he's
Not-not supposed to save them
Not supposed to save them, save them, no

[Verse 1: Jesse Rankins]
He don't even need any armor
Just a cause
As soon as he sees a damsel in distress
There he goes
To rescue a hoe
And away and away
They go

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shawty watch me talk to a friend
They see the way a nigga make it pop to the end
The people getting tight 'cause he wanted to attend
Now she wanna throw it all on me again
Guess they wanna see the kind of money I'mma spend
I let them all watch while I get another wet
If you wanna see it, then I really recommend
Gotta pay attention from the time that I begin
I'mma make it, let me [?] you better
Put 'em on the wall to the dance floor
See, I got them all I wanna [?]
Shawty sippin' every single bottle that I bought
She'll be fucking in the club like we [?] in a resort
The best angle is to see it from behind
Grind that shit, pop that shit
I really appreciate what you be doing with your spine
Grind that shit, drop that shit
Now, see the way I come and get them amped up
Grind on me, mami 'til your body cramp up
I feel you, hot and sweaty and your clothes damp up
We all over the world, baby get your stamps up
From the couch, the way she make it bounce
She put it on me like she wanna kill me
And then I let her crouch on a nigga good
And I continue to watch until she
Take a little dip
Take a little dip
Go on and move them hips
Dancing like you strip
Baby, take another dip
Take another dip
Go on and move them hips
Moving like you strip (I don't save them)

[Bridge 1]
Not supposed to save them
(You're not supposed to save them)
Not supposed to save these hoes
(Nigga, we don't save hoes)
And this side chick game ain't, ain't what it used to be (No)

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
Not supposed to save
Save
Sa-Save
Save hoes
Not supposed to save them (Here we go)

Not supposed to save these hoes
And this side chick game ain't, ain't what it used to be (No)

And this side chick game ain't, ain't what it used to be

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Take a little dip
Take a little dip
Go on and move them hips
Dancing like you strip
Baby, take another dip
Take another dip
Go on and move them hips
Moving like you strip (I don't save them)
