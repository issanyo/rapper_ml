[Chorus]
All my niggas dirty
Hungry and thirsty
Hit ya like a 30/30 for watcha worth see
Ya know we got to get this money
Survival hungry

[Verse 1]
A yo ooh baby, what I feel is just, ha
The type of shit that make you act stupid for real, what the..
Ya'll, before ya try to wear these you need to hear these
Welcome all ya'll to my world series
Ya ya ya elaborate on Busta Rhymes theories
Ya ya ya I gon' bust your ass on behalf of all MCs
Ya ya ya never disrespect these monumental creating new flow
The full blast we'll hit'em hit'em hit'em high hit'em low
And while your style will soften, my mind will drift often
To illusions of my lyrics given you massages in the coffin
The boom shock ooh wee
Horny nigga crash into a motherfucking tree
Officialize shit when we in the place to be
Extra strength nigga maximize the party
So fierce I just pierce (ha) in the place
Make the spot look scarce, I pierce needles in ya face
Fuck dumb shit straight up
Keep it bouncin baby make sure you hold your weight up
A ha yea, just watch how the flow will change up for sure
Reppin' until my niggas walk out the door

[Chorus]
All my niggas dirty
Hungry and thirsty
Hit ya like a 30/30 for watcha worth see
Ya know we got to get this money
Survival hungry

[Verse 2]
Yo, I refuse to lose, look at the news and read the interviews
Flipmode is the Squad, a unit made of many crews
Give me the whole entire wheel of fortune
Making a sacrifice no matter what the shit be costing
And while you coughing I be flossing like a fuckin dolphin
A lot of bitch rich niggas experience extortion
Since I was born when I perform, I drop a million
And one stony rocks on niggas like a fuckin hailstorm
I pollute yo, my new flow, put on your funeral home suit
And execute 'em with a bang (shoot)
The blow torch has been ignited, those who so excited, ha
I'm bout to rope 'em in, a bunch of bitch niggas are being extradited
You soundin' so sloppy, like a broken muffler draggin behind, an old jalopy
Once the bomb drops, here's the aftermath
Scientists tried to dissect the way, I formulate my craft
Worrying 'bout how I achieve things
The way I analyze shit and how I percieve things
My style is real, like lamb skin imported from the Persian
Follow my excursion, all the way 'til you feelin' the new revised version
I complete then I defeat, destroy who ever complicate
How I eat, survival hungry nigga

[Chorus]
All my niggas dirty
Hungry and thirsty
Hit ya like a 30/30 for watcha worth see
Ya know we got to get this money
Survival hungry
