[Busta Rhymes]
Hey yo Swizz..
This shit sound like some shit
The streets wanna do the merengue to (yeah)
Or dance around a sombrero too, WHOO!!!
Yeah, another special from Flipmode Records
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah here we go!
Streets! Flipmode baby, yeah check it Busta Bus baby
Yeah, Rah Digga now, c'mon
Check it, huh

[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
If you ain't noticed yet I have come wit a throne
See I was gone for a minute but now I'm home
The way I touch it you can feel it in your bones
Fuck wit the kid cause I'm taking you into another zone
See it don't matter what you think or what you say
I always love for the street every single day
You better get down on your knees, you better pray
Cause goin' against the grain of this Squad
I promise you will pay! (WHOO!)
You see Flipmode is the team that I rep forever
Respecting the Code of Honor staying together
It's getting hot I think you should take off the sweater
Rattle and knock all of your troops who goin to get this cheddar
See when we come I'm wondering how they gon' manage
Show em mysteriously watch how they vanish
See when we finish just analyze all the damage
No matter who you are, we accept any and EVERY challenge (yeah)
Yeah yeah, I think we got 'em again this time
Flipmode c'mon!

[Hook - 1: Mynx] {*Busta Rhymes ad-libs*}
I think I - I think wanna say something like this (like this)
People denying that they feeling our shit
So we hit 'em with the really crazy flow (crazy flow)
To let 'em know that we be hitting it fa' sho
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together

[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you know that this is really not a game
The way I put it down you will remember the name
The way we change it up shit is never the same
And when I'm finished I promise I'll have you niggas feel ashamed
For giving the people shit they ain't really loving
It's funny to me but y'all niggas be buggin'
But it's aight because I will continue flooding the streets
With heat for the ladies and niggas who be thugging
And if you want it then bring shit wit open arms (spread love baby)
While I continuously give you niggas bombs
Assalam alaykom wa'alaykom salam
I'm in the abscence of confusion holding the world in my palms
I'm tired of telling you there ain't nothing greater
Swinging the torch and repping for Violator
So tell the DJ to go and turn up the fader
Putting it down for the streets regardless what you saying playa!
How many times am I gunna have to tell y'all?
Flipmode run these streets, c'mon!

[Hook - 2: Mynx] {*Busta Rhymes ad-libs*}
I wish I - I wish I had just a little more time (more time)
Instead I give you this and leave more on your mind (on your mind)
Me and Busta Bus be making crazy doe (crazy doe)
So you know that we be killing it fa' sho
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together
I will be here just to hold you down
We'll still be around
Cause we will rock forever

[Verse: Rah Digga]
Dirty reppin' the Squad, don't even get me started
Getting worldwide love keeping the street regardless
Ever since kindergarten, always been the sharpest
Doin' this for my fam cause home is where the heart is
Other crews could chill, all of y'all days are numbered
Bus got the Yellow Digga coming in the Navy Hummer
Start quality, guess I should thank my mother
"Bionic Woman" on the mic like I was Jamie Sommers
Now, I know that you don't wanna really take it there
Digga and Bus you know we make the perfect pair
We keep it gully wit a little latin flare, it's unfair
Oh well, how I still be spitting and keep everybody all up in the mix
It's only right that I shout my brother Swizz
Flipmode and we only making hits
It's like this, c'mon

[Bridge]
[Mynx:] Baby I say, what people say
We gon' keep it on lock from day to day
Let 'em know that we both are here to stay
So keep it hot baby, don't stop baby

[Busta:]The Flipmode is in the spot we run the place
Busta Bus and Rah Digga all in your face
When we step up in the spot we controlling the space
We keep it hot baby, we won't stop baby

[Busta Rhymes]
