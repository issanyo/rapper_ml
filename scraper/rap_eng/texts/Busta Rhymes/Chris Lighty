[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Violator.. For life
The moment of truths arrival, Finding the proof in bibles
Torans, qorans, etc... distribute the jewels through viral's
Quenchin' they thirst to see you, knowin' they hurt they need you
Sharing my pain through these words, hopin' to connect with people
Providing space where theres space of mind while we conquer evil
Visit a place where you see the sign and can spark the cerebral
Sick with the truth when I'm in the booth like I caught the beazles
What I let off is lethal, lets set it off and eat-together
Bless the possess the signs that come before me
I wrote this couple days after they took Chris Lighty from me
Still in denial but put up your cellie's and lighters only
And rep your love like the greatest pain when you lose your homie
Despite ya try to hide it, look how ya try to fight it
There's no possible words, you can find to describe it
You would've enlightened a lot of lives that would make us mighty
Your still at light, no coincidence your last name is Lighty

[Hook: Bob Marley]
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last:
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die - don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie;
One and all have to face reality

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
And since your gone I'll face it and stare it the eyeball
Back is against the white wall, the sun is setting
My spirit gets darker when the night falls
Still in denial when my phone be ringin' and I hope you might call
Seein' ya smile when you know we winning
Steppin' through the right doors
Glorious moments with you, nothing we couldn't get through
Still question what you were feeling before that bullet hit you
I called when it supposedly happened but couldn't get through
Questionin' those who were there and exactly what did they do
Painful, my tears are fallin', Master at problem solving
A man of god so I know you here when there's trumpets callin'

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
So many questions remain unanswered, it’s so exhausting
The harsh realities of another precious life that’s lost and
You never fell under any pressure, they couldn’t stop you
I’m sad you’re gone but I’m happy to know that God got you
So much I’ve learned from you bro, I’mma rep you til the end
You rest in power and peace until we meet again
So much I’ve learned from you bro, I’mma rep you til the end
You rest in power and peace until we meet again

[Outro: Bob Marley]
If you listen carefully now you will hear:
There’s a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
There’s a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
