[Verse 1]
Yeah, Flipmode Squad
Yeah, there ain't nothing iller
Busta Rhymes got another killer
Niggas be gambling, playing Cee Lo
We be getting money at casinos
Gamble my money like gambinos
Scarface look like Al Pacino
Now my pockets got muscles like Lou Ferrigno
Copped the hot shit, big up my nigga Premo
Stack loot with my nigga Dino and Enno (Julio)
Spliff and my other nigga Chico
Uno dos tres quatro cinco (Gimme five)
Count from ten all the way back to zero
Set it off rep. from here to Puerto Rico
Runninâ€™ the bitches mixed with black and Flilpino
Trick in the hide or on the niko
Caught the round trip to Santo Domingo
My nigga Spliff criminal like Max Remo
Thug think he loud then show me your hero
Nigga tried to play me on the D-Low
Tried to short me a couple gram on a kilo
Thought we didn't know better oh yeah we know
Stepping them niggas for what its gon be yo
Niggas spend money and fuck a free show
Get in with shorty who whip in a little Geo
Derelict niggas get left by the seashore
Lock up a nigga and sabotage the keyhole

[Chorus]
Alright y'all (alright)
You know we keepin' it tight y'all (real tight, what?)
That's how we doin' it (ha, that's how we doin' it)
That's how we doin' it (yeah, that's how we doin' it)
Alright y'all (alright)
You know we wildin' all night y'all (all night y'all)
That's how we doin' it (ha, that's how we doin' it)
That's how we doin' it (yeah, that's how we doin' it)

[Verse 2]
Yo, guess who coming through for dinner (Who)
Busta Rhymes bringing another winner
Coming with another all night thriller (Yo yo)
Shit bang through your bass kicker
The more hot shit, the more you move quicker
Shit'll make the club crowd a little thicker
Nigga in a club fronting like a killer
You ain't eating my nigga, you lookin thinner
Now you a sinner a partier beginner
You better off if you dance to "Who Got The Keys To My Bimma"
You a killer but you never pulled a trigger
How that calculate money yo how you figure
Yo, another homerun hitter my nigga
Yo we ain't over hit you with a refiller
We keep it moving never label me a quitter
Flipmode baby you could call me flipper
She wildin we wildin along with her
My nigga put me on told me she a stripper
Fronting like he don't really wanna be with her
He told me handle my business cause he already did her
He says she used to be the seed's babysitter
Fuck a sloppy second hit the highest bidder for realla
Keep the champagne in the chiller
Keep it cold while I hit you with another wig-splitter

[Chorus]
Alright y'all (alright)
You know we keepin' it tight y'all (real tight, what?)
That's how we doin' it (ha, that's how we doin' it)
That's how we doin' it (yeah, that's how we doin' it)
Alright y'all (alright)
You know we wildin' all night y'all (all night y'all)
That's how we doin' it (ha, that's how we doin' it)
That's how we doin' it (yeah, that's how we doin' it)
Alright y'all (alright)
You know we keepin' it tight y'all (real tight, what?)
That's how we doin' it (ha, that's how we doin' it)
That's how we doin' it (yeah, that's how we doin' it)
Alright y'all (alright)
You know we wildin' all night y'all (all night y'all)
That's how we doin' it (ha, that's how we doin' it)
That's how we doin' it (yeah, that's how we doin' it)
