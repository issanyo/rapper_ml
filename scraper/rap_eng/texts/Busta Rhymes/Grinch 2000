This is a Flipmode Squad
Jim Carrey collabo
Now what?

[Busta]
Ugh, hallelujah
Kids hear this come on
While I'm lacing and tryna prepare this
For y'all, oh well I got a story to tell
About a dude I met once, miserable as hell
How grouchy he was
And how slouchy he was
And when he talked, you'd smell his breath
And how lousy it was
And if you daydreamed, he'd give you pinch
Now let me tell you about Mr. Grinch
Every holiday season while we was young, growing up
Everything be cool when Mr. Grinch show up
Always plottin' and schemin' to ruin everybody's holiday season
And never had a justifiable reason

[Jim Carrey]
Yo B I had my reason
They call me The Grinch
I tried to live the given
But it was making me winch
I see happy kids whitless
"Merry Christmas" they shouted
I stole the gifts
And there was nothing anyone could do about it

[Hook]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus, (uh) you're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch
(Busta Rhymes, Jim Carrey, Mr. Grinch)
Mister Grinch

[Busta]
He was an angry little dude with a horrible attitude
And he'll show you some gratitude
If you let him ruin your mood
Everybody knew about him from here to Baton Rouge
He remind me of the crazy lost cousin of Mr. Scrooge
Word to mother

[Jim Carrey]
Yes, it's my favorite day
You let me take all your gifts
And just yell my name!!
(MR. GRINCH)
After that I'll be on my way
Just to return and successfully ruin your day

[Busta]
Okay for the record
What the hell made you like that?
So grouchy and grimy
How everything about you is whack
Ay yo I know you all can tell
From all the talk from his mouth
You better set some big traps
Around the gifts in your house
State of the art surveillance
Just to give it a boost
You sleep with one eye open
With a couple wild dogs running loose, now
He's definitely not the dude you can trust
He be bouncing with all your goods
And leave you biting the dust

[Hook]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch, Mister Grinch

[Busta]
Grinch come around safe guard your things
You better safe guard your money
Safe guard your bling
You gotta safe guard your crib
Safe guard your g's
You gotta safe guard the stash and the car keys
You gotta listen up to what we talking about
Yeah it was better when the Grinch was never coming around her
Time after time again
Never mind he already took the liqour out your Heineken
He already quick to try again
To steal the gifts another way
And give you all a different style again
Why you stackin' and you trying to swell
You best believe Mr. Grinch schemin, dude stay coneiving ass
Ay yo he stay schemin' when you thinkin' he not
Looking over your shoulder
Peepin' everything you got
(He, he, he Busta Rhymes I will get you too)
Relax duke you need to chill
Something seriously wrong with you

[Hook]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch, Mister Grinch
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch, Mister Grinch
