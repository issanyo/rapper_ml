[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
See everytime we do it y'all know that we rep it properly
Y'all niggas know when we come we fuck the buildin up we sorry
Incase you didn't know we ain't that thing you mess with
(IT'S THE CONGLOMERATE!!!) Make sure you never second guess it

Cau mi seh

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Shoutout to Joe Crack last night we blew a ounce
Mattress financial, opened up a few accounts
Harlem mine (Mine) we bumpin 'Ye
No one have this much power since Bumpy J
Lenox Avenue (Lenox Avenue) Awww shuckey duckey
Seen Paid In Full, now everybody do the dougie
When I do the dougie (Dougie) I'm talkin dougie lime
Pistol whip a nigga while you lookin buckyeye
Had the buggy eye, it was hard to see it
Now the headlights chinky like the car korean
Play around I'm a put you in the mausoleum
When I ball you fall you can't guard a deer
Listen sunshine, I be duckin one time
I was first rockin thirty chains at one time
Nowadays I might just rock two or three
Louis V, Gucci T, nah y'all ain't used to me

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
If you take 'em off the leash I promise watch and see what happen (UH HUH!)
When I spit I tear the flesh off humans bitch (UNLEASH THE DRAGON!!!)
Now I suggest you greet the captain where I'm from
I keep them wolves with fangs that be true to be bleedin from the gums
(FOUL!!) Heartless when it comes to bread despite a lust of cash (YEAH!!!)
Bombs with signature initials droppin crush the mass (DAMN!)
I'm gluttin when it comes to stuntin and bwoy I love to flash (YEAH!)
That's why I don't eat on glass tables, diamonds cut the glass (OOOH!!!)
AWWW SHUCKS!!! Is why I cuff the stash (OK!)
And spend money to finish garbage niggas dump the trash (WOOO!!!)
From bread to cars weed and liquor nigga we so high (WHERE THE WEED AT?!)
So sickenin with this shit I spit, book of ECOLI!!! (DAMN!)
Peep how I keep those ties and run it for another year
(AWWW DO IT!!) See how I leak yo' eyes and give you shit to shed a tear for (Tear for)
Incase if you ain't know who you fuckin with!
(IT'S THE CONGLOMERATE!!!) One world government
