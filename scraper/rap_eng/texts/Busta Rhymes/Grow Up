[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Tell the DJ "Turn it up real loud!"
No, we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Cher Lloyd]
I got a flow that'll make you drop
I got a flow that'll make you pop
I got a flow that'll make your mother
And your father call the cops
We're gonna make this thing go blow
We've got a system overload
We're gonna be the generation
That makes everything explode

[Bridge A: Cher Lloyd]
And I when I say explode, I don't mean that we're using bombs
We doing stuff that we don't ever have to tell our mums
Love this life we got, we got it all up in our palms
Paper chasing, yeah, we're buying everything we want

[Pre-Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Somehow, some way
We're gonna have it our way
We don't give a what what you say
No, we don't

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Tell the DJ "Turn it up real loud!"
No, we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday
We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Show everybody who runs this town
No, we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday

[Bridge B: Cher Lloyd]
Do ya, do ya, do ya know what I mean?
I'm the princess, I don't wanna be the queen
Please, don't say a thing, Mr. Bean
Every time you talk, grr, it makes me wanna scream!

[Verse 2: Cher Lloyd & Busta Rhymes]
I don't know what you heard about me
Don't make me hold up my pinky
I'ma finish off all these MC's
Like they were my cup of tea
I got a flow that'll make you drop
I got a flow that'll make you pop
I got a flow that'll make your mother
And your father call the cops

[Pre-Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Somehow, some way
We're gonna have it our way
We don't give a what what you say
No, we don't

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd & (Busta Rhymes)]
We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Tell the DJ "Turn it up real loud!"
No, we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday
We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down (come on)
Show everybody who runs this town
No, we'll never grow up
And if we had our way (let's go)
We would do this everyday

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Cher, let me take it from here
Bullseye again
I got 'em in a target, pull up and I park It
Corner on a market, that’s the way we did
You can see the way, I walk and I talk It
Everytime I show up, I got 'em sprung
I don’t wanna grow up, forever young
No, I never wanna leave ya, better believe me
Trust me Cher, you're the one
Gonna make all the people, gotta go and pump their fist
When they hear the beat, they’re gonna jump like this
Lean and bend their body all around and then they gotta turn and twist
I guess it’s time for pictures and my close-up
I can do this 'till infinity, I pray I never grow up

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Show everybody who runs this town
No, we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday
We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Tell the DJ "Turn it up real loud!"
No, we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday
We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Show everybody who runs this town
No, we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday
