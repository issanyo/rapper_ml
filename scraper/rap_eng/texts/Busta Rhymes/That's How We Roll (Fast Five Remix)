And we do it how we do it whether it's now or it's later
And we always handle business cause we bout gettin this paper

Every hood and every street and every block we got it covered

Hop in any vehicle I choose
I get up in that 'Vet and start it all you hear is vrooom
Roaring up the engine 'till it pop like a balloon
Light my dutch hit the clutch throw it in the gear and peeew
Riding in the fast cars driving like it's NASCAR
Tearing up the asphalt when I'm in that Jaguar
Dipping away from Nassau, redlining the dash board
Exhaust blowing fire like a rocket 'bout to blast off, fast y'all

Rolling see the way we holding see the money folding
Everybody see the way we hit it, chosen when we hit the road and
Everthing is golden ya'll already know how we get it (vroooom)
