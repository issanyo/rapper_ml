Hell no and nobody fucking with the key s
Seen her looking boy you’d better come and get your bitch
Before I have to grab her, before I have to snatch her
Before I have to smash her stab her with this fuckin dagger
When I’ll be the shine, when I’ll be a disaster
Go money come a way too slow, my money come so much faster
Better not turn the door just a little B
This close what a buggin in the B
Bout my money, bout my dollars bout my DVD
