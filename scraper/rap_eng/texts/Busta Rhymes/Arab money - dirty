Busta rhymes verse
You can talk about your money but i really dont care
Im into coppin streets shit im trying to buy air
Im the first black nigga that i rap trillionaire
I control heat i'm bout to buy the ozone layer
Im into coppin minerals now diamonds and granite
So much paper i could probably gift wrap a planet
And clone a million janet's respect my company
While I stack another billion and I give it to the block cuz
Chorus x2

Lil wayne's verse
Calendar say gettin money errday
Smile look like iced out perrier
Bury me a g and tell ma kids that i was
Now jump into ya grave do you dig what i dug

Young money entertainment, drugs and fame

Ya!
