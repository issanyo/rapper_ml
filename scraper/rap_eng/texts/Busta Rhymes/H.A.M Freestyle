[Verse]
Tell me, who you really really think is more lyrical?
Cause everytime I go somebody got to see they medical
And everytime I come, I’m eating everything that's edible
And if you ain't already know, then who be more incredible?
They wanna call me crazy like I’m borderline clinical
Cause how I do it and I kill ‘em and I get incredible
And magically do it like this was another miracle
And if you don’t like it you can suck up on my genitals
Ta-ta-ta-tal ta-ta-ta-ta tals
Do it little bitch and get up off your little pedestal
And whenever you see me, you better salute the general
Cause I will break it down to every single little mineral
(Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp)
Suck up on my testicle again when you see me counting money
Move the decimal again
Bout to cop another diamond out of Senegal again
Everybody saying that he's uncomparable again - okay
Killing everything I think we ’bout to have a funeral
A lot of you niggas be doing whatever you be doing
And I don’t even know what to call it, just sound terrible
Lower down the chorus, see we have another burial
These niggas that be rambling and babbling
I ain't hearing them
And everybody know that I be handling my B-I
When it come to other rappers niggas know I be scarin’ them
Chop, chop, chop chop
Chop another beat up
Now you see the way I heat up, everybody wanna meet up
Just to come inside the building and witness another killing
Then I relax and then shop back and put my feet up
Every beat that I touch I’mma lace
I’mma never stop even with a muzzle on my face
When I finish with this sissy, I'mma leave with out a trace
Nigga kneel down better say grace
I go HAM!
