[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
King Karnov
The Conglomerate
Murda Mook, they got a lot of talk about you going on around town, my nigga
Yeah, a whole lot of talk
A whole lot of gossip
A whole lot of facts

[Verse 1:Murda Mook]
I’m one of them niggas that’ll run down and finish you
Then got to Vlad and promote my album on an interview
See, this is different living, you just in the view
I’m Louis 13, and y’all niggas pinnacle
Taste different, bass whipping, shoe bitches, lace women
And I ain’t tripping, I got a grip
My pockets swollen, I’m just walking in the club while it’s closing
I’m yelling bartender poor a couple up nigga
And look around, and I see it’s only us niggas
Fuck niggas, that’s just how I feel
Riding round Harlem, looking like dollar bill
Last week the club owner said “you gotta chill”
This week the club owner say “we gotta chill”
Fly shooter, I’m in designer still
Funny how I’m pulling all these niggas cards without a deal

[Hook]
I ain’t one of them niggas
Disloyal motherfuckers, I ain’t one of them niggas
Get caught up motherfuckers, I ain’t one of them niggas
But them royal motherfuckers, yeah I’m one of them niggas
Right, you’s a bitch, I ain’t one of them niggas
You be diming on the strip, I ain’t one of them niggas
And then you die up on the strip, I ain’t one of them niggas
But supplying up the strip, yeah I’m one of them niggas

[Verse 2: Murda Mook]
Looking at my twitter feed like what the fuck you talking bout
See a nigga Loaded Lux called me out
Man why he show his gun to a killer
And got mad, like he must think that I’m one of them niggas
Different kind of guy, I spit crack, I spit cyanide
Get one dose of this shit and you’ll probably die
Tell bus bring the track round, all these dudes run laps round
Y’all say pardon my back, I say pardon my backdown
We them calm niggas, we let you act wild
When we on it, this thing sing, my mac wowed
Make it hot till it boil my nigga
Cook coke like I cook arroz con pollo my nigga
We deal with straight drop, you do the oil my nigga
And we shared sweaters if I’m gon coil my nigga
Ain’t got time to be worrying bout who is you
I ain’t got peripheral vision, nigga my shooters do (easy!)

[Hook]

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Let it be indoctrinated
Those who are skilled in combat
Do not become angered
Those who are skilled at winning
Do not become afraid
Thus the wise win before the fight
While the ignorant fight to win
Appreciate the jewel, fool!
We having fun with this shit!
We establishing the rules of this motherfucking hip  hop
Stop looking for excuses niggas
Punishment
Murda Mook
Yeah it’s ok to calm down now
Easy, nigga!
