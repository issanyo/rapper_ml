Busta had a dream
Reek Da Villian had a dream
J-Doe had a dream
Hold up, okay
All my life I want money and power
I thought I'd get that moving the white powder
Then I start spittin, anybody can get devoured
I made that shit, better turn me up louder
Damn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches
But I can't be consistent
They all wanna get me
There's no time cause I'm busy
You see me once then you miss me
I'm on the streets on my grizzy
I gotta scrape up these pitties, she at the door with them titties
She pull out one, she pull out 2
I guess I got my moment
Yes, I'm trying hard to resist it
So I gotta pray for forgiveness
Cause Lord knows, Lord knows I got too many bitches
I'm with a model, why you holla at a basic bitch?
I got a bottle, see me pourin up that Ace and shit
Ah nah nah, nigga don't get mad at me
She see me pourin waterfalls and tried to chase the shit
She ain't used to being round all this amazingness
She see me 5 feet away and now she can't resist
You know I had to drop a verse before my favorite shit
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can f*ck the world for 72 hours
Damn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Our hand on the steering wheel, the game is like my taxi
I'm the one that's driving all you rappers to the backseat
Conglomerate running shit, welcome to the track meet
I keep at least 100 racks just where all my stacks be
Taxi cab fashion, got yo bitch up in the backseat
Making noises like she have shit, while I stabbed it
It's the money guys, yea we all about that mula
Put that ruga to your tuta, now they screamin hallelujah
Salute to the big homies that's banging on the west side
9 shots, fill my homie C Murda and Aesop
Yea that be that blood love, show my niggas thug love
Even though the credit stores, money what we love blood
Let it run Ali
