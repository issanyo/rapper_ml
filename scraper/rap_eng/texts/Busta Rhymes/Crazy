[Intro]
Ayy! [4X]

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I know you love the way I come and I scorch this
Ain't nothing changed niggas know I'm holding the torch, bitch
Excessive with the heat see how I'm holding the fort, sick
I'll twist a nigga's shit just like a fucking contortionist
It's bang bully bust rhymes, I'm coming to squash shit
Demolish every hood, disintegrating the mosh pit
Spaz, animal rap, they love when the god spit
I know you wish you could the way I bang them regardless
It's the Conglomerate in case I ain't mention
There's bitches in this building and they all in this section
To dominate this shit has been my every intention
These niggas think they sick I come and kill the infection
And when I come through you know I'm blowing the top off
The building and the club you niggas know how I pop off
And if you violate you'll probably get your shit chopped off
The way I got police barricading the block off

[Hook]
Sometimes I act like I do because of this voice in my head
(voice in my head, voice in my head)
It tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread
(chunk of this bread, chunk of this bread)
You make them niggas want to say
(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Them niggas psycho how they ball
(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
They buying all the alcohol
(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Like they just buying out the mall
(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Before I finish counting this bundle
So kindly as I welcome niggas (back to the jungle)
I'm back to run this, bitch, I strive to keeping it humble
I'm here to shake the building 'till it crackle and crumble
So back out bitch, see how we knocking the most hard
I'm about to split the ocean, get to calling the Coast Guard
Better call the ambulance, I'm coming to choke y'all
I'm smashing every country, bitch I'll send you a postcard
See now they acting like they ain't knowing
But I know you see exactly where the bottles is going
A couple box loads see all the money we spending
We drink until we stupid and the party is ending
Now peep the way we coming in we picking shit back up
The tunnel two thousand twelve the way the shit packed up
We full throttle in this bitch and never will slack up
While I feed you the heat watch how my niggas will act up

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ayy! [4X]
Ohh! [3X]
