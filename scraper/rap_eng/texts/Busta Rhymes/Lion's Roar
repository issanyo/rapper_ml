[Asher Roth]
Pretty girl, you know that you so hot (hot, hot-hot)
How about I take you to my spot? (spot, spot-spot)
We can take off all our clothes, evoke our animal
You hear my lion roar, head high, eyes closed
You begin to describe all things we do in a big big bed in an empty room
Look at you on me then me on you with a warm washcloth and a few ice cubes
Did it get so wet? No I'm at my best when I make you sweat
Ready now get set cause you get no rest
I'mma smack that butt, I'mma grab them breasts
Yeahhh, tell me what you like (like) can I scratch and bite? (bite)
We can scratch that fight (fight) make it last all night
Slidin on your side and curves, satisfy the primal urge
Ridin on you back and forth, that's how you make my lion roar

[Hook: New Kingdom]
Head high, I'm low
Hear my, lion roar (ooooh)
Lion roar (ooooh)
Head high, I'm low
Hear my, lion roar (ooooh)
Lion roar (ooooh)

[Asher Roth]
Yeah yeah...
On the mic I'm a beast, I'm a big bad beast
I could speak that heat, I don't need no reason
Jesus, them big teeth you be feedin
Better leave now, I'm 'bout to be eatin
Even you stick around and we beatin
Bleedin, have him laid out on the cement
Breathin, I had him back in your team and
Leave in peace and have a safe evenin
Beef is not what I like to do
Speakin just to enlighten you
Teach him a rhyme and preach in the mind and
A beautiful thing keep fightin through
Just how big's the fight in you? Tight and high and mighty or
A lighty, hide your heiny when a giant hasn't frightened you (you)
Look in my eyes (eyes) you see my pride? (pride)
You see the fire (fire) burnin down the side
Will and drive'll make a man, doin what you say I can't
Oh you think I'm playin? Well let's see just what you made of then

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Busta Bust and I'm back on my BULLSHIT NOW!!

C'mon! Got to make you wanna jump jump jump
And I come with another banger and I know you wanna bump
Cap and gown when I smack you down
And I graduated homie bangin in the trunk
Put yo' hands where my eyes could see
Let me take this thing to where it really need to be
One-two-three, let me take time
To remind y'all that you can't fuck with me
Shake yo' ass on the way to the flo'
In the dungeon drinkin and the lions roar
All my little mamis come to the crib
Let me pound on the coochie until it gets sore
Then I laugh and cough when I flash and floss
Moment when I get cash as a boss
Asher Roth, I'm comin too
Cause I heard that you got a lot of ass in the loft
See I ain't playin mister
I'm 'bout to twist your sister
That's how we do it killer, yeah!
(Lion roar) Yeah! (Lion roar)

[Outro: Asher Roth]
That's when I let my lion roar (lion roar) x6
(Lion roar.. lion roar.. lion roar)
