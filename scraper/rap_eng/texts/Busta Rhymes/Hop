Scrapin these niggas and breakin their pockets to chase them out
Suddenly call your bitches to see just how they just makin out
Fuck it, we kick the bucket and to continue to stake them out (Ha)
And in back of the crib is where we will be makin out
Puting some shit together make it so you could all attend
Welcoming you and my nigga so we can break your pocket again (Oh Oh)
