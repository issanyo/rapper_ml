[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Some people don't understand
The inner soul and the thoughts
Of the Inner Mind's Eye

[Verse 1: Charlie Brown]
Front line 510 to 710 I'm back again
So we send and extend
Peace to all it's the plural oral B the
Urban rural publicity Afrocentricity
Satellites coincide unifying it's time
To climb avidly apparently reality
Below zero it makes you pale no color
For the bleach for seasons many reasons
Equinox equator now who's the raider
And who's the soul who stole the surface?
Sacrifice slice commanding
I'm demanding official awareness we
Share this common understanding

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Word is bond and I give my
Life before my word shall fall
Do me a favor listen up y'all
We got to activate social
Activity for one common cause
Cherish your mind or you will perish
Nigga, relax your temper, so
We can live up to our nature
As civilized men
Everytime we live savage-like, we
Damage like the heads of our
Young little seeds
Oh! my gosh damn pressure makes
My eye balls bleed, since when
Was my mind really freed
It's kind of ill when you don't
Know what time or whose time
You are livin' in, this is the earth
We exist within
Damn
My mind keep swellin'
While in my inner soul keeps
Tellin' my anger & hate, while
In my verses, I keep yellin'
Let's do this, let's do this
Let's make a change, so I could
Stop feelin' strange, making a fool out of myself like I am deranged
You better believe it gotta stop
Yes it gotta stop, word is bond
God! Word is Bond!

[Verse 3: Dinco D}
I'll be coming around the mountian
Mountain
Mama mia more money nonstop
Solar sex the believer of breather
Taking on all sorts of shit
The devil his wife son daughter
And don't let me see you shoot no dogs
My pit will sit seed in all frequent paths
Infa-ray fake laughs relay or may
I say DJ away okay we stay
Hay play afraid touche uma
Might spray who I'm at least to
Say can really dig it man really
Dig it damn smack deep right in
The mind jack flash jump start
Signing off time often givin' up
Ending up next in line

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Time will tell everything
Time will tell all
Understanding The Inner Mind's Eye
Time
One of the deepest mysteries known to man
Stay tuned
As you continue to stay tuned
All biters, understand you better understand self
Before you try to understand others
Watch your back
Stay tuned again
