[Intro: PHresher]
Goddamn dawg
Ain't nobody do it like dis
They don't do it like pH anymore, they just don't (pH!)

[Verse 1: PHresher]
This ain't no accident, ayy
I'm on yo' ass again, ayy
Fell off, I'm back again, ayy
They on my stack again, ayy
I ain't gon' lie, I got a lil' white bitch
But that bitch African, ayy
Me and my niggas posted up, oh no
We on our Shaq again, ayy
I'm on attack again, ayy
Spendin' them racks again, ayy
[?], ayy
Gucci, new pack again, ayy
I'm an attraction
Time for some action
No time for distraction
They takin' a fraction, uh
I walked in wit' the shootas, ayy
You niggas chicken like roosters, ayy
Only talk tough from computers, ayy
We be in a pickle like, ayy
My shit long and it's ruthless, ayy
Love fat asses and boobies, ayy
Dive in the pussy like scuba, ayy
My diamonds dancin' like Zumba, ayy

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Look and I'm back to whoop a couple asses
Learn I'm teaching a couple classes
Hit 'em in the front, in the back
Watch how a nigga just got his ass kicked
You could never do it like dis
I'm fucking this shorty up on a mattress
Stretching the coochie like it's elastic
Until I got shortie pooping out her ass quick
Turn it up
I'm jumping and doing a couple back flips
If you think another nicer better get it together when it comes to the facts bitch
Look what's happening, how I got niggas scrambling
When we pull off niggas know we fuck the building up and start dismantling
Bout to put out the trash again
Shortie show me yo' ass again
And when I'm done with that lay everything down
And I throw on this ski mask again
Come through, fuck a nigga plans up, niggas start canceling
(doo-doo-doo)
Bars break a nigga leg to the point where they can't dance again
When you niggas relax I'll turn the gas on
Hoping you turn your camera flash on
Take one nigga take two
Y'all know what I do when I'm fucking up the [?]
