[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Put your money where your mouth is nigga
Place a bet again, better put your money on the god
I'm back to smash everything!
Shakin up some shit and then erase you like an Etch-N-Sketch
From the way we put it down and how I finish niggas effortless!
ALWAYS been described as a beast, that you should never test
And from the West to the East, you should decribe me as the very best
That ever do it and said it and jump it off I'm sick with this
Niggas already know just how we body chumps - RIDICULOUS

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
We set it off like alarms, set it off like a bomb
Set it, I was calm before I set it like Saddam
And you read it like a psalm in the Bible in Islamic
That Koran what you nervous cause we wet it like a palm?
We you sweatin like a can of Coke, bust ya in ya canteloupe
Your brain in an antedote, runnin through my veins like an antelope
Runnin through the Serengeti plains
Contemporary while I'm spittin legendary game

[Verse 4: Cassidy]
N.O.R.E. it's whatever dog you know I set it off
Start poppin the desert off one shot and his head is off
You know the feds involved when clappin the led involved
But I'm marrying my gat I ain't callin the wedding off
NAH!!! I'm not a clown I'll body you now
I got the pound that'll spin your whole body around
The ambulance will tell the dispatch a body is found
And ain't no tellin when your body is found, MU'FUCKER!!!!!

[Verse 5: Red Cafe]
Uh! Let me set it off, let me set it off
