[Chorus](8x)
Everybody want ya
They don't know you loca

[Verse 1]
El bendito, chico del barrio
She said quédate conmigo
Olvídalo, olvídalo
You still, you still want me tho'
They pay back the love that you owe me
They give me the love you've never given me
Blurred lines between you and me
That cut has been way too deep
They do not know who they are getting involved with
They see your ass and curves I'm the only one who could handle this
I know you crazy, sexy like Mercedes
I know you crazy, you made me so crazy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Hit you with no delaying so what you sayin yo
Silly with my nine milli, what the deally yo
When I be on the mic yes I do my duty yo
Wild up in the club like we wild in the studio
You don't wanna fight with me, you still do it tho'
Harmonic and moody is the name of your show
Who love women with hot temper get me
The ones who love the south they get me

[Bridge](2x)
Back to life, I'm feeling so alive
You ain't by my side, I'm alright
Perfect time to change my mind
Tired of the things you used to hide

[Chorus]
