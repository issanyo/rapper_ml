As we welcome you all to the future
Oh! We come to give you that
Operating like we be official
Yeah! We come to multiply
And we're plannin the scheme for the long run
Yeah! Our shit be always right
Every move you'll see how it's related

(Verse 1)
While we continuously stay sculpturin bombs
Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggas I'mma die tryin for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turnin back my nigga cause we takin it there

And leave!

(Verse 2)
And leave a mark until it's deep in the floor
Y'all niggas fucked up never should've let let me get my feet in the door
And then I step through, FUCK wipin my feet at the door
I be the deacon I'm beatin niggas and speakin the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggas be seekin me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step.. for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus
While a lot of other niggas don't be tellin you nothin
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggas like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggas trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggas to my live niggas everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin it there
