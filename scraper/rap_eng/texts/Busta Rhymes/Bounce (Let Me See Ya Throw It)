[Busta Talking]
Bounce, Bounce, Bounce niggas
Come on bounce, come on bounce, bounce
Come on bounce bitches, come on bounce
Come on bounce, come on bounce
Everybody bounce niggas, come on bounce
What come on, come on
I'm sayin bounce bitches, come on bounce now

[Verse 1]
Yes, yes yall, you know we talkin it all
See how we bringin the street corner to Carnegie Hall
It be so funny to see how badly they want it
The fall, fuckin up somethin me and my niggas is ready to brawl (ha!)
Now I'm ready to call my niggas get off of the wall
I run up in the club like how these bitches will run in the mall
While we poppin the collar holla you need to folla the scholar (aiyyoo!)
Hustle for dollas and rock it until manana
My niggas, KNOW HOW WE DO IT
I do it for the love and the riches, my niggas hittin them switches
I got the rent from my bitches
(You fuck around, youse a goner!); Put this shit back in order
And keep in mind that I might be fuckin somebodys daughter
My niggas that be keepin it gully and hang on the corner
Bitches get the strippin and shakin they shit how they wanna
Let me see it mama, and start showin ya shit
I love the way you make it bounce and get the throw on ya shit

[Hook]

Female bitches throwin they pussy at retail
All up in ya face seein every intricate detail (ah-hah!)
Now we rollin wit bigger money we foldin (ah-hah!)
Crackin (?) in the safe in money we holdin (ah-hah!)
Hold on, pause, these bitches be droppin they drawers
Layin flat on they stomache and poppin it all on the floor
Comin to get us, we tossin ya niggas like lettuce (uh-auh)
Leavin you beat up regrettin the moment you met us
Bitches open for bonin' and fuckin they starvin the let us
Sweatin and drippin on niggas and startin to wet us (so!)
Check out the way that we reppin we comin to get it (ah-roo!)
Get the fuck out the club if you ain't rollin wit it
I be givin you bitches some shit you be wontin to goggle
Hittin these bitches that focus on wantin' to model
Wether you whippin up in the truck or you revin' the trottle
Or you wlyin up in the club or you throwin the bottle
Just let me see it mama! and start showin ya shit
I love the way you make it bounce and get the throw on ya shit
