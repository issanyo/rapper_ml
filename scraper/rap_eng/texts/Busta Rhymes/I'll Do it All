I-iiii-iiiih, I never thought
Thaaaaaaat I, could fiiiind (excuse me miss)
Someone, so special (can I have a word wit'chu baby)

[Busta Rhymes]
Miss can I get a second to speak and quietly mention
That I am so into who you are, can I get your attention
My observations of you creates conversations for you
And if you got a little time, I got the patience for you
Okay? Good, you givin me the time to talk?
While I figure it out and sort what I'm tryin to say, let's walk
Just tryin to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter
Don't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?
I've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes
I'm feelin somethin special with us, it's just one of the many signs
I think that we have to look forward to our go-through
Any war with you regardless what it is I'm tryin to score with you
Sometimes I think and wonder especially through rain and thunder
If I'd ever find the one to ride when I'm on top or under
Until we reach the end, ma with love as I be your friend
Oh; here you can take my number, I hope we can speak again

[Hook One: LaToiya Williams]
No matter how mister, you know that I'll die wit'cha
Until the end of life, lay down on the ground wit'cha
I'll give my life to you; I hope it all comes true
Ready to start for you, I give all my heart to you
And when together I hope we never fall apart sugar
Now that it feels so good; our thoughts are understood

[Busta Rhymes]
I'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya
It's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya
Is it somethin at all or did I just bump in and fall
And even though you did I see how you was reluctant to call
But it's nothin to crawl before we walk (OOH) listen
And it's nothin to stall before we talk - look
To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you
And thus I'm diggin you, I ain't just tryin to pound you
I'm only tryin to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you
Regardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to
Just spend a little time and then CLICK, you know that kind of chemistry
The recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine
Mami, I like your conduct, light the fireworks and bombs up
The type of chick I wanna talk about when I call my moms up
Until the love is empty I credit the one who sent me
The most BEAUTIFULLEST woman and she ridin with me

[Hook Two: LaToiya Williams]
(I'll do it all) I'll do it all wit'cha, go through any door wit'cha
It doesn't matter I will, go against the law wit'cha
Just know you live through me; your love is all I need
If you ain't know you make me, no one's ever shown you baby
To tell the truth {?} you've got me goin crazy
Your love so real to me; and that's all that I, can see

[LaToiya Williams]
This is a thing I wanna feel forever, and I ain't goin nowhere
Cause you mean so much to me
No matter how my people try to doubt ya, I know the truth about ya
It doesn't matter to me
Baby I love you and I always told ya, I'm always here to hold ya
Cause you do so much for me
No matter how they try they can't deceive us, nothin can come between us
Cause you mean so much to me

[Busta Rhymes]
Listen; trust me and I will trust you, I ain't into tryin to fuss boo
Deeper than any lust, I'm only tryin to mindfuck you
That's probably why and maybe I can nickname you my baby
Now that you made me a man you're officially now my lady
Despite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever
And nourish everything we have 'til we grow old together
I'll never trick you, mislead or try to be shaky wit'chu
I only wanna make all the rest of my babies wit'chu
