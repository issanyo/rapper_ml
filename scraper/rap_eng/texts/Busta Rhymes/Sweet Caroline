[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Oh mother, sweet Caroline
Feels like you shot me with a .38 or a .45
My heart's bleeding baby, can't feel my legs I'm paralyzed
I know you just in it for the moment, so I'll enjoy the ride

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Eyes start rolling in back of my head, girl I'm already gone
I can see all of nothing, what's happening?
Can't even look at your face, girl I'm fading away
Girl your drug is automatic

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life
Sweet love of mine, oh
You're my sweet Caroline, my sweet Caroline

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Ooh baby, I'm down, as long as you do the same, I'll try the same shit, right now, right now
Baby tell me when you start to feel it, damn you fine, yeah baby
Just let go of all the emotion, all the emotions
Just let it out, flow with me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Eyes start rolling in back of my head, girl I'm already gone
I can see all of nothing, what's happening?
Can't even look at your face, girl I'm fading away
Girl your drug is automatic

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life
Sweet love of mine, oh
You're my sweet Caroline, my sweet Caroline

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Let me make sure Caroline understand something, here I go, when I step up in the spot like another block
When the nigga drop stop, you ain't even got a clue
Regularly man, a nigga that need to be seen
Medically tell me what you really wanna do
Generally niggas think they better than me boo
Niggas really tryna put they foot up in my shoe
That's right I'm independent, I don't really understand it
That's when I lay 'em down, I'm tryna get a better view
Genuinely see the way I regularly choose
Whack niggas switch, I'm up to legendary view
Something from benal they already really knew
Instead of tryna fuck you need to get a better crew
Lactose, switch, I came up back close
Better know I back those, I don't wanna let it go
Damn folks, shawty wanna stand close
When a nigga bang those and I let it blow
He don't really wanna do it
Then what it gets a nigga that be flowing like a fluid
And I be damaging every nigga, every time a nigga get up on, it's nothing
We know that they already do it and ain't nothing really to it
Pull up, stop, how 'bout a drop top?
Then I'm out, I got my Glock cocked
That's how we do it over here
You not hop on the mic on a wrong black knock
Y'all niggas know what it is
And you know the way I put it down for 'em
That's right, got 'em loose
And it ain't nothing baby girl, you can see the grap on em
Now ya'll don't really want to get a better note
Fireworks, nigga I be giving 'em a show
Let me chill though I really met a pretty little hoe
Make her bounce on me but a nigga gotta go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life
Sweet love of mine, oh
You're my sweet Caroline, my sweet Caroline
