[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo.. all my bitches that make money
Throw ya motherfuckin' hands in the air (Suuuu!)
Cuz it's all about the money
(Yo, yo, all my, all my, all my homies
Let me hear you go suuuuuuuu!) Money rules the world
I take over all pussy with money
(All my girls making money, out there)
All cars get tooken over cuz of money, baby
(Let me hear y'all go suuuuuuu!)
All businesses, baby, it's all about the money
To all my niggas that bustin' shots for money, right now
Bust shots (suuuuu!) bust shots for the money, now

"Where's your money?" (suuuuuuu!)
"Where's your money?" (about the money)
"Where's your money?" (it's all about the money)
Throw ya motherfuckin' hands in the air! "Where's your money?"

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
The Brooklyn borough king, you bitch to me is everything
Sent me to Jersey, trapped off the parascene, or Penelope Pitstop
You can't duplicate the picture, or record this hip hop!
My owl's are tryna crust up the ziplock
Dime pieces in high heels and flip flops
Real playas, with the Zenty's wristwatch
Outside of clubs, is backed up in gridlock
Three bouncers the size of sasquatch
Plus whips that will make your eyes pop
Hot burns that burn faster than matches
Dirt is only out to catch vicks
See boys on the back on some rap shit
Fake industry heads sweating in the guest list
I'm on the spot with a bottle of fresh Cryst'
Lay up on the table, arm around the best chick
It's all about the money

[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Hey, I'm O.D.B., let me know "Where's your money?"
Next time you see me, let me know "Where's your money?"
Baby, I just got home, let me know "Where's your money?"
We got to feed these kids, baby, let me know "Where's your money?"

[Busta Rhymes]
In a fly, tailor-made suit, cooking a blunt
Got the Phantom, parked, crooked out in the front
Rowing, gun toting, Sonny Chiba niggas we large
Caymen Island style, sucking on cohiba cigars
The way we stack cake, you know I know it's making you sick
Watch dough with diplomats from other countries and shit
Heh, now let me show you why we walk with a swagger
Money over flowing, spending like it don't even matter
Money do a lotta shit, money make me more bread
But money take a nigga life, put a price on they head
Think you nicer than the dreads, niggas fight with the feds
Keep it cool, while I put all of the hype on the bed
Bitch, ever since my cake got a little bigger
Fuck a JP Morgan, Merryl Lynch and them niggas
Fuck it, call it what you wanna call it, nigga, we sinners
Throw my money at ten thousand dollar tables for dinners, now


[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
It's a Busta Bust now, nigga, let me know "Where's your money?"
Everytime you see me, let me know "Where's your money?"
You can give me all your money, let me know "Where's your money?"
When it's the first of the month, nigga, let me know "Where's your money?"


[Busta Rhymes]
For the carat D class, next to my middle finger
When I see my own reflection, diamond frost the mirror
Diamonds as cold as ice, frost bite like winter
Floss fitters, three quarter four length chinchillas
You wish you knew the way, the kid'll quiet dough is a mystery
Niggas bread'll stack longer than American History

Heh, now peep the way we runnin' through y'all, it's funny
Fuck around get you murked with my "Woo-Hah!" money
Lay you down in the dirt, let me school y'all dummies
Hit the town with the work, like crack heads, they love me
Shit, to call my cake disrespectful bitch, holla
A lot of acres with a pet alligator, named Dollar
Bust it, y'all niggas know that I'm the most, so just stop it
I cop cribs, and stash cake and keepin' money in wallets
Niggas money smaller than a bar of Whatchamacallits

Money hungry like Sudan, when my paper stay brolic

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Busta Rhymes)]

Hey, I'm O.D.B., let me know "Where's your money?"
(It's a Busta Bust now, nigga, let me know) "Where's your money?"
Next time you see me, let me know "Where's your money?"
('Fore I stick ya ass up, nigga, let me know) "Where's your money?"
