[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
What the fuck is this?
While you pull up wit' a bunch of rentals
Sorry, but we don't give a fuck about your credentials
We back to reinstate the boom bap wit' the fundamentals
Then they act like they don't wanna move back
So when the gun's essential
Blat, hit a shot 'til they clap, so disrespectful
Calm down, the shit like this
What the fuck is wrong with your mental?
While I remind 'em who's the nicest
Sometimes these niggas' forgetful
I, so official, we makin' them actin' civil
These fickle niggas, we beat them until they're crippled
Fold their bitch-asses up and serve 'em just like a nickel crack
Then pin them down when I carve my initials in their back
Sing along with the whistle
While we constantly launching missiles
Want to debate who be nicest
Then niggas want to argue with you
What's the issue? Y'all already know the answer:
If I've been called I make them black up in this bitch
Then they kick a hole in the wall
Calm down, hahahahahaha

[Hook: Busta Rhymes + Sample]
Yo
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on-)
("Yo, chill, man—chill!")
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Back it up, back it down, bought the four pound
Blow a hole in you dome like it was the ozone
Make you jump out your shoes, ill street blues
Pop pills, drink booze, with skills I paid dues
Hit you with the iron like Mackle boy
Spit fire when I rhyme till I smack a toy
I build, destroy, I bring pain, I bring joy
Tactics employed like Pretty Boy Floyd
Or Al Capone, international zone
Coaster my toaster in this holster home
But if it comes to the art, and it makes a spark
You're gonna find out the bite's much worse than the bark
Similar to a shark when I light up the dark
Put your body in park when I'm hitting my mark
The boys and the men all separate right there
And jump around, save PJ from the pair
Calm down

[Hook: Busta Rhymes + Sample]
Yo
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on-)
("Yo, chill, man—chill!")
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!
