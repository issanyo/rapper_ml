[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
This the kind of...
This the kind of slappers that I used to dream about...
Peter Tosh.. Peter Tosh.. Peter TOSH..


[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Nigga we back I be that bumba blood clot
Mozart now watch how we fart
Poisonous darts see when I start
I make 'em lick wood
Lock every hood, it's understood
Make 'em calm down, fuck up the place
Black till they good, they wish that they could
Do what i do, them niggas wack
Donkey shit rap
See when i come through, it's a wrap

[Interruption]
Pull-up pull-up pull-up pull-up!
