[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Things was lovely when she was loving me
We at the club together sippin on bubbly
Trust me I'm waking up and now she not around
Let me down no more she's outta town
See her with the next man better treat her right
Cause if you don't act check em later on tonight
And them strangers was the same ones that cared for you
Swear the job will always be there for you

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Pleasure or pain
So much love to give
I made a mistake
Now I'm her type
Pleasure or pain

Acting like this is a brand new beginning and

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
MamI skin clearer than a vegetarian
Shorty beautiful, golden like she was australian
Aborigene she was such a soul aquarium
The way you make me feel it's probably you that I'll be marrying
Baby you exemplify everything that you like
Look like baby girl from Restless shining like the moonlight
Almost kinda strange how everything about you too right
Hold me like you love me baby girl you squeeze it too tight
So win the girl a waiter flag
And I'm pleased to say I'm so passionate about the thing we have
So I'm coming to get you
Can't believe I'm finna one
I'm with you
Look at the shit we've overcome and been through
Come closer let me kiss you
Trust me ain't nothing gonna change I love you through the pleasure and through all the pain

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Pleasure or pain

[Verse 4:  Konshens]
She said like the ocean get it
She want it
Can't stand remind that everyday she [?] it
Even when it hot like a shaft to the target
She tell me say me loving sweeter than chocolate
Special ringtone to me phone anytime she call it
Sing me clutch press the gas don't ever stall it
I better be there fast or it's gonna be a tragedy
And I don't want that
So I'm giving her all I got
She want the rough up, tough up play smash up plus kiss her upon uh go
All of that
Ya see
Pleasure and pain
Control her brain

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Pleasure or pain
So much love to give
I made a mistake
Now I'm her type
Pleasure or pain
