[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Yo
Good mornin', good mornin'
Hey yo Bo knows this, and Bo knows that
But Bo don't know jack 'cause Bo can't rap
I use nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs
Smoke ya like herb if your style is to the curb
Making more hits than Sonny and Cher
Stop, look, and listen but please don't stare
Slammin' emcees as if my name was Ric Flair
But since I'm dark, call me Koko B. Ware

[Verse 2: Charlie Brown]
Yo, I know the scenario
Chaps, I rap, superierieo
How now brown cow with A Tribe Called Quest
The Leaders of the New School, the LONS, the LONS
Kick the beat, like Peter Pumpernickel
After the lab, I go fix me a pickle
Watch the boob tube, to gimme some space
The girlfriend shares, and the girlies' underwears
Make me sick of all the [?], AAAH, [?]
From radio to the video to Arsenio, tell me, yo
What's the scenario

[Verse 3: Posdnuos]
Ichabod cat got nothin' on a ?
I got headphones to match [?]
Stop kick more when I tour as is
Plugs is connect as oral sex come correct
I got checks bigger than bigger than Busta's blunt
I don't go on the frees but I just tease on the ease of a tick tick tack tock
I got lickety [?] but I won't smear
So someone Plug One on my vibe
As I muscle much dollars, gripping much cheese
Keep it undercover like a yellow submarine

[Verse 4: Chris Lighty]
Yo
You got the B.I., then you add the zero
Chop the track, yo, scenari-ario
Funk the flow, ho, you never know
Will I got off the 'locks or will I let them grow?
Show to show, ho to ho
Booties is bangin' 'cause I'm the pro
Mash up the track then I start to flow
Pass it on 'cause here I go

[Verse 5: Mista Lawnge]
The Black Sheep has arisen, oh dear
The cat's out the bag and that's the end of your career
Don't spit it out, take it to the rear
I like to see my dick snot disappear
Some say they get live but the Sugar Dick is liver
In and out of any situation like MacGyver
If it's not Bo Peep, then it's Lady Godiva's
When it comes to getting ass, I'm a striver
Give me ten hoes to bone and there won't be no survivor
Peace from the nine point fiver

[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]
Hey yo, oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh uh, all over the track
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Raow, raow, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
Rhythm in sync, the rhymes are on time
Yo ripping up the sound like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario

[Verse 7: Dinco D]
True blue, Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than two
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape crushed grapes apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah-, an -eader, simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later

[Hook]
Here we go, yo; here we go, yo
So what's, so what's, so what's the scenario?
(Repeat until fade)
