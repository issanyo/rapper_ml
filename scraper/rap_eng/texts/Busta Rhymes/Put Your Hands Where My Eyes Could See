If you really wanna party with me, In God We Trust
Yo it's a must that you heard of us yo we murderous
A lot of niggas is wondering and they curious
How me and my niggas do it, it's so mysterious
Furious, all of my niggas is serious
Shook niggas be walkin around fearing us
Front nigga, like you don't wanna be hearing us
Gotta listen to how radio yo be playing us
Thirty time a day shit'll make you delirious
Damaging everything all up in your ear-ius
Yo it's funny how all the chickens be always serving us
All up in between they ass where they wanna carry us
Hit ya good then I hit em off with the alias
Various, chickens they wanna marry us
Yo it's Flipmode my nigga you know we bout to bust
Seven figure money the label preparing us
Bite the dust, instead of you, making a fuss
Niggas know better cause there ain't no comparing us
Mad at us, niggas is never, we fabulous
Hit my people off with the flow that be marvelous
Oh shit, my whole clique victorious
Taking no prisoners niggas is straight up warriors
While you feeling that I know you be feeling so glorious
Then I blaze and reminisce on my nigga Notorious
