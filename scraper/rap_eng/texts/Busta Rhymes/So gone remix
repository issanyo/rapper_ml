[Monica] Remix

[Monica] Remix, ohhh
[Missy] Oh, new Monica, so sick!
[Monica] Remix, hey-hey, remix
[Missy] It's the remix playa
It don't get no hotter than that
[Monica] Remix
[Missy] Uh, a hot beat on some wax
Monica, what you say about that?
[Monica] Hey-hey..

I'm on the club, I got people out on every block
And them say you been cheatin, what the blood claat?
Them rude boys, while you think youse a hot shot
You'll come back like them addicts look for crack spots
You must be high, how dare you think you got me on lock
You got me open like a chest with pnuemonia
I'm quick to run up on ya, you and your chick I came to warn ya
Crazy like them gangs in California

Hey-hey

Silly of me, devoted so much time
To find you unfaithful, I nearly lost my mind
Drive past ya house every night, in an unmarked car
Wonderin what she had over me, to make you break my heart
You...

You make me feel (you you you)
So unreal
You make me feel (oh I...)
So unreal

Nights I couldn't sleep, you let the sun beat you home
I asked myself over again, what am I doing wrong?
To make you stay out all night, and not think to call
What does she have over me, to make you not think to call

You make me feel (baby you make me feel)
(I'm so gone over you) So unreal
You make me feel (You make me feel)
(I'm so gone now) So unreal

Ay Busta Rhymes, lemme know a man's point of view
Because I think of men as dogs, that's including you

[Busta Rhymes]
Ohh Monica, look closer, tell me what you see
Correct yourself 'cause dog backwards will spell G-O-D

[Monica]
See I'm so gone and I'll be slappin any kind of chick
And I will step to any boo that think he's messin with

[Busta Rhymes]
Watch what you say and what you do sometimes I can't ignore it
From how you rep and spaz over your dude, I love you for it

[Monica]
Well, I'm a singer not a fighter, but don't test me
I got a razor blade under the tongue, that's security

[Busta Rhymes]
Listen, now what you sayin? First of all you know you still my baby
My lady, what's with this razor shit, you talkin crazy

[Monica]
See Bust, I'm down for my man if he act right
But if he's out freakin, yeah, I'm on the first flight

[Busta Rhymes]
I know that youse a hot head, girl, let me continue
I don't mean to patronize, but I love the sexy thug in you
You crazy

[Monica]
You make me feel (Now now now, I'm so gone)
So unreal (So gone, so gone, on you)
(You know you make me) You make me feel
(And I love to love you baby, I'm so gone) So unreal

(So tell me what she did to you, you)

What she do, I do better
What she do to make you love her
Is it real or forever? Baby please
Can't we stay together
What she do, I do better
What she do to make you love her
Is it real or forever? Baby please
Can't we stay together

Ohh, I...
