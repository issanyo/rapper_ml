[Verse One: Nas]
Yeah, yeah
It started with rhythms I heard listenin' to the wall
The bouncin' of basketballs on playgrounds and all
The empty bottles that's hollow, wind blowin' inside 'em
The flow and the rhymin' got my alignment to a science
Mixin' with my moms in the kitchen, them spoons rattlin'
Pots and pans, faucet water pourin', tunes managin'
To come from all the fussin' and ramblin'
What I noticed was -- pure music, untampered with
By things showbiz does; older thugs showed us stuff
Like how to hold a plug, juice from the street light
It almost could have blowed us up
Crates of records, great sessions had the whole hood jammin'
Large speakers, fresh made, smell the wood sandin'
Father did his blues smooth, legendary jazz man
Saw his wife secondary to his true passion
Started with my crew rappin', new jacks in '82
Never looked back, now look what it changed me to: music

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry]
We gotta believe the future
We gotta believe the past
We gotta believe in more
That know that we have
We gotta believe each other
We gotta open up our minds
'Cause music is for life.. for life

[Verse Two: Hi-Tek]
Uh, what's the difference between me and you?
It's I'm a real connoisseur of this rap shit, I really do it
My whole life, man, is really music
Through my bassline, I'm livin' through it
Another expression of life I couldn't live without
I like my music straight pure, not watered down
DAMN, it felt good to fulfill the dreams of gettin' out the hood
Kept me busy, gave me a chance to stop sellin' drugs
Spendin' time in the basement kept me from actin' up
Zonin' out, wishin' Dre could check it out
I'm here now, I can't believe it
Proof in the puddin', everything happened for a reason
Through this music I'm able to feed the family
When I'm stressed out, it's my sanity
It's a lifestyle, all on the street and in Hollywood
Music in my DNA, it's my livelihood: music

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry]
We gotta believe the children
We gotta believe in hope
We gotta believe in more
That know that we know
See, we gotta believe each other
We gotta open up our minds
'Cause music is for life.. for life

[Verse Three: Common]
Keep the music alive
The good and the strong survive
I closed my eyes and imagined I was 'Jackson Five'
Randy and Michael, goin' through life cycle
Music allowed me to let life go
So vital to a youngster, comin' up amongst street hustlers
The big beat'll touch us in such a special place
Givin' the ghetto a taste of what freedom is like
I reached a point in my life where I was needin' the mic
No second guessin', self-expression in lessons learned
Aggression became sessions where sessions burned
Put my soul into it, now my feet is firm
In the game, where a name is hard to earn
And hot cats' careers gets scarred and burned
Through the years, mine took a Godly turn
This is the story of my life here trapped in a verse
No matter the money or the movies, music is first, yeah...

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry]
We gotta believe the future
We gotta believe the past
We gotta believe in more
That know that we have
So we gotta believe each other
We gotta open up our minds
'Cause music is for life

See, we gotta believe the children
We gotta believe in hope
We gotta believe in more than all we know
See, we gotta believe each other
We gotta open up our minds
'Cause music is for life...

Now, you know, this is serious thing behind the music that we're doing
It's like, music, for me man, it mean, it means everything, family
