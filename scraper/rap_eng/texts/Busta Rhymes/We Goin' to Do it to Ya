[Verse One]
Ever felt the fire burn like this (burn like this)
You shocked that I've returned like this

C'mon, while we make the bitches yearn like this
Pearl white shit'll make the world hype quick
And earl like knowin I'm bonin your girl like this
Act sweet (BOY) nigga we pack heat so (BACK BOY)
Stack money like a Backstreet Boy
Track sheet, never whack, bitches hittin in my back seat
Love my flick up in the Black Beat boy
So move your black feet boy, make bitches bounce to this
Don't let me have to let the mac speak boy
Track meet boy, hundred meter dash, straight to the trash

And you know we rock on and on
And make the bitches wanna bounce, all night long and
And to my gettin money niggas keep ballin (c'mon)

[Verse Two]
The Range Ro' and everything you see is paid fo' nigga, c'mon

Chase mo' money, fuck I wanna waste dough fo'
Stack peso, big money know my small money
Probably bigger than your WHACK payroll
Money get your hands off of me, dance all night
Break bitches hot and sweaty take your tight pants off for me
So horny, shorty pull your plans off on me
Whylin out, while shorty ditchin her mans off for me
So simple, there go the champagne glass
When your pour, make sure the whole entire thing full
Sinful! Still shorty puttin the somethin on me
Brushin on me, whylin and feelin and touchin on me

Gimme my ounce back nigga, Flipmode back in the spot
