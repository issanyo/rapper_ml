[busta-verse 2]
Clap to it, niggas know how to act to it
Rap niggas be gettin they shit crack to it
Act stupid and makin my niggas react to it
Blaze it jus to keep em commin back to it
Fine tune it (turn it up) blow ur mind to it
Rock shit and break ur motherfuckin spine to it(HA!)
Roll a dice til it spit precise to it, c the crib I bet
U wanna know the price to it, so much cake
I cut my own slice through it, hungry niggas a come and
Take ur ice to it, sing to it, make ur head spin to it
Best shit and then let the ruckers begin to it
Get to it, so raw u wanna shit to it, spit to
And make my people wanna flip to it (trip to it!)
Weaker niggas slip to it, and make sure I always keep
My people hip to it, sick to and if there's traffic my niggas a dip
Through it, if shit is hot niggas is quick to whip to it
Rest to it I ain even do my best to it
Blow the spot and left the shit up in a mess to it
(Wooo) we got u niggs gettin bent to it (do it)
Shit that u'all niggas should not attemp to it
Put a dent to it (come on!) and do exactly what
We meant to it (n so on), it's flipmode bitch
