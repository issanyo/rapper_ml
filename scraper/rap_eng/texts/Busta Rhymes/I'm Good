[Verse 1: Amplify Dot]
You can probably tell from the attitude I got it
Them chicks all bark like a motherfucking forest
Playing with me I suggest you set the game to Novice
I be putting in work, you're an intern at the office
Listen, I'm a boffin
So I spit words that you're lost with
And then I switch keys so lyrically I'm a locksmith
Right hooks like I'm boxing
I get top marks like I'm Ronson
Them birds stay fly, lyrically they're an Ostrich
I'm a boss bitch
You niggas playing in your cockpits
Braid the hair at the side
They probably thought I made pop shit
I'm a Don, so kiss the ring and be gone
Come to me on the day of my daughter's wedding, (boss)
They hanging on by a thread
That's irony cause I floss
Got diamonds all in my watch
And a background in my socks
They praying and praying that I fall
But nowadays I just ball
I walk the walk that I'm talking
I be with them cause they cool

[Hook: Amplify Dot]
She hit me like I'm famous
My pockets are Yellow Pages
I'm waking up all the neighbours
Behaviour getting outrageous
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
Stacking up all these papers
My trainers are all the latest
Surrounded by famous faces
We're here baby I made it
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good

[Verse 2: Amplify Dot]
Nowadays I'm feeling like my middle name's abada
They biting when they see me
On mic let me at her
Blacked out rolling through the jungle
I'm a panther
And now my name's spreading
They say I'm sicker than cancer
Kill 'em with the banter
Spin 'em like ballet dancers
Spitting with all this venom
Playing these snakes and ladders
Climbing to the top
I'm running every stop sign
Kicking down doors like the bailiffs or the cops
Kind of like a fucking apple mac
I'm never PC, can you handle that?
Champion baby, where's your white flag at?
Falling to your knees like I blew your back out
Got 'em cutting chips like a pumpkin
So you know I pull of the dough
That's a mother fucking dumpling
When you hear my tunes and the bassline's thumping
Better know it's about to be something

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
So, y'all niggas can hang your fucking plans up
Make you niggas stand up
Hands up, hands up!
Hands up, hands up!
News clips, guess I'm getting new shit, you flip
New whips, cruise ships
Sailing from the tropics
Bitch, I'm back from vacation and let me take'
But I'm inside while I break 'em in
If you smart nigga, run on!
Never the one to front on, nigga, come on!
Look around, if you really wanna fuck around, listen (listen)!
Safety on my gun is not on
And we're black in the spots until they turn the lights in the club on
And I'm coming to get your food and get to scrub on
Till it's blood up on the dance-floor, yep!
Choppa boy, fear squad, done with that
Back to the dance I drink up to
VIP with the only kind of people that we are chopping, Sir
While we are still on liquor
We are just in my business
Back to counting the moon, I don't wanna move without the
A Dot, let 'em keep counting
We ain't in a hurry!

[Bridge: Amplify Dot]
Walk like a champion
Me have to talk like a champion
And it feels real good to me
It feels so good to me, to me, to me, to me
Walk like a champion
Me have to talk like a champion
Rum pa-pa-pum
Rum-rum pa-pa-pum pum
And it feels so good to me

[Hook:]
