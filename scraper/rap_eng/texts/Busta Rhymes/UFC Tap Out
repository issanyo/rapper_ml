[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tap out, tap out
UFC, knock a nigga lights out
UFC, stomp a nigga lights out
Match worth a couple million, pull your racks out

Tap out, tap out
UFC, knock a nigga lights out
UFC, stomp a nigga lights out
Match worth a couple million, pull your racks out

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
If you want a problem, I'ma show you how to make that problem bigger
Stomp with a nigga, launch on a nigga
Bomb on a nigga, stomp on a nigga
Everybody know that when I do this shit again
You don't really wanna have no problem with me killer
Got a couple niggas that'll beat you in the head
Kinda like a 1000 little monkey and gorillas
Nigga that would whoop you all over the plate
Lick you in the back, lick you in the face
Hit you with a chair, hit you in the face
Break a nigga jaw, ain't nobody safe
Breaking niggas into pieces of little ity bity shapes
Slow motion, now niggas see the way
A nigga bone snapping, every time you looking on the tape
Somebody call a ref, see the way I split a nigga flesh, like Iâ€™m cutting up a steak
Please somebody get 'em up
When my niggas really finished with 'em, it be floating with a lake
Submission moves from the top, when them niggas get to closing of the gate
Back up nigga give me elbow room
Or you'll be the next broke nigga face in my brake

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tap out, tap out
UFC, knock a nigga lights out
UFC, stomp a nigga lights out
Match worth a couple million, pull your racks out

Tap out, tap out
UFC, knock a nigga lights out
UFC, stomp a nigga lights out
Match worth a couple million, pull your racks out

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Tell the truth man
Rather do a shooting than a fight, man
Tote a .45, fuck the motherfucking hype man
Run up on Wop, worst night of your life damn
Old man go find your freaking head in a trash can
I don't give a damn 'bout your kids or your old man
Gucci Mane still keeping a strap, what he calling
20 gold shining in my mouth, where my gold at
You ain't got to lie to kick it bitch, with yo broke ass
Yeah I fucked your bitch, jumping up the Rolls like Macho Man
Call me Goldberg when that Desert in my fucking hand
Whipping Goldberg, put a style on your fucking ass
Yeah I'm from the hood but I'm a legend in this fucking land

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tap out, tap out
