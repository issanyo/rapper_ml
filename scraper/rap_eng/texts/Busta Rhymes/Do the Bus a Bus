[Intro]
Uh

[Chorus]
The Bus-a-Bus (Yeah)
The Bus-a-Bus (C'mon, ka-c'mon)
The Bus-a-Bus (Uh)
Rockin' to the beat
(Flipmode, motherfucker, Flipmode, y'all)
The Bus-a-Bus (Uh! Yeah, yea-yeah, yeah)
The Bus-a-Bus (Ka-c'mon, ka-c'mon)
The Bus-a-Bus, (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Yeah, yea-yeah, yeah, yea-yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Floss time (Time!), Busta Rhymes shine on every primetime
Mastermind gettin' this paper now cross the fine line
Money plenty sippin' gently, whip the Bentley
My Bentley runneth over empty with gifts you sent me
Then you broke the last rule, frontin' like we was mad cool
You damn fool, come around frontin' wearin' your man's jewels
Play the part, they want me to start shit
Get on your mark quick and target, corner the market
Peep how we're movin' this, keep improvin' this
See, you in this because you love the way me and my crew be doin' this
Have a ball, I'm not mad at chy'all, where the alcohol?
I ain't messin' witchyou at all, girl your ass too small
Cop the hot shit, write it off while you bite it off
And try to fight it off; the fact that you wack and your light is off
Bite the dust, you like to fuss, look right at us
I know you like to cuss, who could you trust to bring the rush?
Now do—

[Chorus]
The Bus-a-Bus (Aw, c'mon, keep it movin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Aye, yeah, I like just what you doin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Ayo, yo, y-yo, yo, all in together now)
The Bus-a-Bus (Aw, c'mon, keep it movin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Oh, yeah, I like just what you doin')
The Bus-a-Bus, (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Ayo, yo, yo, yo, all in together now)

[Verse 2]
Turn it off!
Turn me back on, go get your mack on
And keep the track goin' and latch on, hope you can catch on
Follow the beat you sweet bitches and get your dance on
Tipsy off a little Cristi', a little Chandon
Barbecue back at the mansion, feel like a champion
Collapse on, my thing orthopedic to rest your back on
Nowadays, Flipmode money be runnin' mad North
Fuck around, dig in my treasure, feel my forty-five long
Ride through, about to slide through, I'm right beside you
Mind you, my system be bangin', adjust my EQ
Peek-a-boo, we not seekin' you, focus on beatin' you
There's only one of me, 'cause you copy there might be three of you
Classic and so essential, we monumental
Powerful, we presidential, we bomb your mental
Bite the dust, you like to fuss, look right at us
I know you like to cuss, who could you trust to bring the rush?
Now do the—

[Chorus]
The Bus-a-Bus (Aye, c'mon, let's keep it movin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Oh, yeah, I like just what you doin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Ayo, yo, yo, yo, yo, all in together now)
The Bus-a-Bus (Aye, c'mon, let's keep it movin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Oh, yeah, I like just what you doin')
The Bus-a-Bus, (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Ayo, yo, yo, yo, yo, all in together now)

[Verse 3]
Hit me off!
You Speak & Spell and freak it well, son
No need to dwell, checkin' 'em out, my pockets swell
Shit sound so intermediate, my ingredient
Is to immediately rep for everyone you see me with
You little idiot, I exile you and your X-File
You and your next trial, and demolish your little wack style
Black child, I'm takin offensive, we too impressive
To the naked eye, the way we floss sure be expensive (Ooh!)
Turn up the fader, ain't nothin' greater
Still a little hater be gettin' paper, go meet your maker
Undertaker, now go shake whatchya momma gave ya
Shaker, shaker now we trippin' the circuit breaker
Model up and swallow up and turn the throttle up
Break the bottle up in the hip with the greatest follow up
Bite the dust, you like to fuss, look right at us
I know you like to cuss, who could you trust to bring the rush?
Now do the—

[Chorus]
The Bus-a-Bus (Aw, c'mon, let's keep it movin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Oh, yeah, I like what you doin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Ayo, yo, yo, yo, yo, all in together now)
The Bus-a-Bus (Oh, c'mon, keep it movin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Oh, yeah, I like this, what you doin')
The Bus-a-Bus, (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Ayo, yo, yo, yo, yo, all in together now)
The Bus-a-Bus (Yeah, aye, yeah, keep movin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Oh, yeah, I like what you doin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Ayo, ayo, yo, y-yo, yo, yo)
The Bus-a-Bus (Yo, c'mon, keep it movin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Yeah, I like what you doin')
The Bus-a-Bus (Uh!)
Rockin' to the beat
(Ayo, yo, y-yo, yo, all in together now)
