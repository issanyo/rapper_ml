(Intro)
Daddy can I sing a song please?
Thank you

(Verse)
Hush other rappers don't you cry
Flipmode is back and you all gon' die
Lotta ya'll niggas really think its all good
That live a lot safer 'cause you moved out the hood
Its too late for you to try to call a truce
We targeting you niggas like a snipre on the loose
Better watch your head
And watch how you talk
Watch where you sleep
Watch where you walk
Always be aware of the choice you make
Every turning point, every route you take
The crazy shit I feel every time I have the the thought
I yell (?) since the dawning of New York
Now we're seeing shit we never thought we'd see before
If you ain't realize, It Ain't Safe No More
If you ain't realize, It Ain't Safe No More
If you ain't realize, It Ain't Safe No More
Hehehe
(Gunshots/Chaos)

(Outro: Busta Rhymes)
Fuck this shit, uh
Fuck
Yea, unfortunately for a lotta you motherfuckers
We bout to run up in your shit
And give it to you in a way you might not be prepared to deal with
But it is what it is
And it ain't motherfucking safe no more!
