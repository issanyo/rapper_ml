[Hook: J-Doe] x2
I do it like a movie
My life is a movie
All my dreams are stacked up
All my belts is Gucci
Motion picture swag ho
My fit blend like a smoothie
I do it like a movie
Cuz my life is a movie

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
My life is a movie
Chill just a little bit, damn ho
Sorry lil homie, you'se a has-been
Played out nigga, Hasbro
Bitch I’m Marlin Brando
Y’all niggas sweeter than a mango
Y’all corny niggas always talk y’all shit
But y’all only remind me of an asshole
Baby girl get up on that damn pole
And tell your friend hating is for losers
Drop ya nigga off in a manhole
You love the way I move my George Lucas?
Bone chillin til a nigga kill nerves
Y’all know I spit scripture
When I talk I make a nigga feel words
3D motion picture
Took shorty back to the crib, she balked
Couldn’t even find a description
Ballroom-sized living room bitch
Life's your science fiction
Movie premiere show time
Y’all niggas know the way we move in
All day every day red carpets
Focus your lens, zoom in!

[Verse 2: J-Doe]
Ok now my life is a movie
All real with no filter
My girl got on real fur
Bitch I think I’m Spielburg
More like a documentary
Cuz ain’t no movie this real
So sick and can’t get wet
Bitch I think I’m Denzel
Get them hands in the air when I shut down the show
Hop off the stage and I get in and go
Not one of these niggas can fuck with my flow
I’m hot as the sun you are cold as the snow
Bad bitch in my room that’s action
I hunger the coming attraction
And they gonna keep going til I yell cut
If you didn’t know muthafucka guess what?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
My life is a movie
Limited Givenchi ostrich
Land lord, godfather of it
Bitch you know who the boss is
Better get yo hands up off this
Suffocate your shine, vacuum
Why most niggas still wanna hate?
I’m digging in they bitch in the bathroom
OK, slime, tell em everytime
Y’all already know what the flash do
When the diamond gleam and I never flick up on it
Blinding everything thing when I pass through
Do you really know what the cost is?
Bugging when you take a look at all this
Don’t ever count money I just look up in them contracts
And million dollar deals in the office
