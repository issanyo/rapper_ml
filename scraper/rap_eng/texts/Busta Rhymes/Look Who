[Intro]
I'm tired of tellin' these niggas I'm comin'
Busta Rhymes bitch, Flipmode bitch

[Verse 1]
[Check it] Some nigga sniped on my roof at buildings, it's silly
So many big guns when they pull out a dock in a city
She don't wanna fuck around, it don't make sense tryin'
It's like fightin' someone who believes there's rewards in dyin'
Nigga look like he a little can't front like he hard
Actin' tough like he Lil Ze from City of God
Nigga front, I'll let the bullets stray and split up your arm
With so many shots that'll follow, shit could ruin a farm
When i see the police come I stash my own gat
Before i have to do it, you should trash your own rap
Hang 'em til' they're drip dry, harness 'em up
And let they bitches give me dick jobs 'n polish me up
Why act tough? you don't have the ability, son
I take your shine like a bitch i took virginity from
You da type that regularly deal with supidity, done
That make me grab utility belt for utility gun

[Chrous]
*Look who's got you goin' crazy again*
Bus-a-Bus, Flipmode/Aftermath Bitch
*Look who's got you goin' crazy again*
*'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here*
*Look who's got you goin' crazy again*
Aftermath/Flipmode faggot, you know how we do
*Look who's got you goin crazy again*
My niggas be happy with guns, they be poppin' at random
*You know how we do*

[Verse 2; Repeat Intro x3]
I'ma mash on niggas til they sick of me, run
I'ma mash on niggas til they sick of me, run
I'ma mash on niggas til they sick of me, run
When it come to reppin' tha block I'm the epitome *Rewind*
Come and see the way niggas conspire, try to get rid of me from
Up outta the game, can't be serious, you kiddin' me, won
Die slow and ask your man [ah shit, look what he did to me sonny]
It wasn't meant, but you shoulda never said shit to me, money
Once the homocide detective get to chalkin' around
And leave the witnesses fucked up or shot talkin' about it
