The fine cocaine, lil' nigga you touch the shit that ya can't contain I
Fill'em with octane, light another fire nigga
'Till I'm high killa, ignite another flame ah, sorry I dig his talent
Well tie ya little lame look, Ok it don't matter

I'm a take off my jacket now, you see I'm back on my bull shit
You tired lil' niggas go in line, watch how

And if you wan' test what I'm on bitch

To cause the riot, (hot drops), and I come to supply it
Hu-hu you niggas on a diet, you can't stop it, then I drop
Ya know ya can't deny it, my home boy you know that I'm a crook
And I'm a try it, while I'm counting this money and I hide it
I'm taking it back, puttin' ya hands in my eyes, can't see
You get to puttin' yo eyes on me, look, look how I drop shit
I got hit, I won't quit, and bet you see I'm back in a cockpit

Everybody gather around, and get ya to singin' the hook

[Hook:]
(Oooh ooooh and I like it I like it)
And so I said and so I said
Excuse me dear - My gosh you look nice
Put ya money on her - better double the price
But let's get it niggas and jump
