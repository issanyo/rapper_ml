Two days ago, sitting at home playing the violin
Can't play ya know, I just put it under my chin
Do you want to know, when I keep my twin
That's right he's in the bin
Takes two years to buy a goldfish
Bet I can do it in two months
That's mad

I drink milk
Semi skimmed
I make silk
Semi untrimmed
Cut your hair
It's some what long
I mean pretty long
Nah seriously get a hair cut
Semi square
Big hair
Semi circle
Big turkle

Round, oh half round
Yes please

'Cause I feel like I'm running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday day, day, go!
See they don't really wanna pop me (Blow!)
Just know that you never flop me (Oh!)
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come a semi circle gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow and then I gotta shudder any little thing that semi circle think he be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple semi circles
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and again
And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
A human man better call a ref, and everybody knows my style
And semi circles know I'm the the best when it come to doing this
And I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go

[Spencer]
Nah I'm good mate
