Everybody wit me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up
Back it up, a girl like you, a nigga like me can't pass it up
Rollin' by, lookin' good, put it in reverse then back it up

They broke the mold, one of a kind, fat boy witta gold mouth that shine
Hard to touch, sorry to tell you, you boys out here ain't hard as us
It's Ball and G, part of the streets, 'cuz the streets are a part of us
Lay it down, please remember, games we don't play them now
Disrespect, please remember, stains we gon' spray them round

Get a pump, unload and dump, forget it, close the trunk
In the middle of a fire, scotch and burn him, let's overheat him
Really mistreat him, let's Rodney King him and over beat him
MJG is the reason yo season needed seasonal spices
They needed more life and lucky yo wife was bleedin'
I don't like this leavin' yo body, for drinkin' too much Bacardi
You should've known when you started, never fuck with G and E
In any climate I'm shinin', 'cause I'm perfect wit timin'
I'm good for rippin' and rhymin' in and out the beat
And 8 Ball is loadin' the clip for niggas supposin' to trip
And you know I'm rollin' the whip, we finna set 'em free
Buss a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up

8 Ball and G, get it crunk fa sho
My swagger, my flavor, my pimpin', my flow
My ho, my woman, my slacks, my denims
My backstroke in swimmin' in pools wit models in 'em
Them boys, they hate it, we hustle, we made it
We richer, the picture, is two of the greatest
The realest, you bump some Ball and G, you gon' feel it
Guaranteed, muhfucker, stamp, sign, seal it
We placin' the fakest, they don't give it up, we gon' take it
The realest up in in this niggas buckin', bitches shakin'
They asses but cash it, might be a habit
Like mics when we grab it, we cock it, we blast it
Buss a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Buss a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga, bitch
