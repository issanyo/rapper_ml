[Intro]
Busta Rhymes y'all, word mother y'all, check it out y'all
Just swing to the left, swing to the right
Make ya feel good, feel alright
One time, feel good yeah y'all
Busta Rhymes in the place y'all
Makin' you feel real good y'all
Flipmode is the Squad in the place y'all

[Verse 1]
Buck wild to all of my niggas who don't care
Floss like a bunch of young black millionaires
Makin' ya run, me and my gun, stackin' my ones
Floss a little, invest up in a mutual fund
Blowin the horn since of everyday I was born
Never dreamed Iâ€™d see a nigga landscaping my lawn
Dangerous, my niggas shit be accurate
Have to get, the flow be so immaculate
A yo a yo I do my deal sippin' my moe'
Sippin' it slow, them pretty bitches sayin' hello
Any wiggle hittin this playa, Oil of Olay
Little honey dipped in within her little cabriolet
I don't mean to hold you up but I got somethin to say
Swear to only give you hot shit everyday
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us
You strange to us that's when we gettin' dangerous

[Hook]
This is serious
We can make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
Cause to much of us is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My Flipmode squad is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

[Verse 2]
Hold your breath we swing it from right to left
Word to Wyclef nigga shit be hot to death
Staying alive, you know only the strongest survive
Holding my heat, under my seat, whippin' the five
Baseline for all of my people movin' around
Give me a pound, all of my niggas holdin' it down
Cuttin' you up, the new shit wreckin' you up
Fuckin' you up, my black hole suckin' you up
Back in the days a nigga use to be assed out
Now a nigga holdin' several money market accounts
Blaze the street and then I would just like to announce
Feelin my grove, my jigga jigga makin' you bounce
Others is fair, me and my niggas breakin' the bread
Straight gettin' it, we got you suckers holdin' your head
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us
You strange to us that's when we gettin dangerous

[Hook]
This is serious
We can make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
Cause too much of us is dangerous
So dangerous we so dangerous
My Flipmode squad is dangerous
So dangerous we so dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

[Outro]
One time ya'll
Throw your hands real high ya'll
Yea, get down ya'll
Let me see you all ya'll
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode ya'll
Nineteen ninety eight ya'll
Ha, get down ya'll, lets have a ball ya'll

Little boy is bugging
Y'all
