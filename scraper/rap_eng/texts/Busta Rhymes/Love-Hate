[Intro - Busta Rhymes (Robin Thicke)]
I think I love ya
I think I love ya not

I think I love ya (WOOOOOOOOOOOO!)
I think I love ya not (I love you)

I think I love you

(I can't get away from that
Taste baby come on
So right, so wrong
I love you, I hate you
Need it like heroin, OOOOOHHHH!)


[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Baby girl see you the one right
And I love the way you 'preciate my sunlight
Revolve around me how the planets do the Sun like
They compliment the God phenomenally, just right
Hmmm-- in the beginning you were just a cutie
But I love the way your flesh and spirit manifest your beauty
Smile, pretty ass-- bigger than my whole jacuzzi
It's my city, have a seat and let me show the movie
Hmmm-- but I don't like it when you try to fight
Going through the love and hell for shit to turn right
Instead of turnin' LEFT-- that's when the pain stick
See I don't like it when yo ass try to talk shit
You see it's such a problem, when you be actin' moody
Gettin' mad at little shit and hold out on the coochie
Ha- even when I see the wrong sign
Baby girl me love you long time

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Baby I don't like you
(I've got a problem baby)
Even though I love you
(You got me going crazy)
Baby I don't like you
(All up in my face baby)
Even though I love you

I can't get away from that
Taste baby come on
So right, so wrong
I love you, I hate you
Need it like heroin, OOOOOHHHH!


[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes (Robin Thicke)]
Erry time you step up on the scene
I love the way you shine, I love the way you gleam
I love the way you think, I love the way you dream
I love the way you cook, I love the way you clean (I love you)
The way you rep for me, it's hard to doubt ya
I scratch my head thinking all what else I love about ya
So many different things, sometimes you drive me crazy
But what I love the most is how you love me baby (I hate you)
Hmmm- But then again when you be acting psycho
And I don't like it when you get jealous of me, acting spiteful
Emotional and overzealous, got me feeling stifled
See I don't like the way you be black when you be on your cycle
Hmmm- I think about when you be slackin' up
And you could read see how I don't like the way you be actin' up
Ha, Even when I see the wrong sign
Fuck it-- you know me love ya long time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes (Robin Thicke)]
(I love you)
That's why I got you on my side
(I hate you)
That's when I put you out my ride
(I love you)
That's why I rep you with the fullest
(Baby then I hate you)
Whenever you be on that bullshit
All my ladies all around the world
Hold your man down, show him how you rep to the finish
All my homies all around the world
Hold your girl down, show 'em how you rep when they with us

[Hook, x2]

[Outro - Robin Thicke (Busta Rhymes)]
(I think I love ya)
I love you

I can't get away from that
Taste baby come on
So right, so wrong
I love you, I hate you
Need it like heroin, OOOOOHHHH!

(I think I love ya)
I love you
(I think I love ya not)
(I think I love ya)

I love you
