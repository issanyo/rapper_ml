[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, let us talk about being leaders
Or, let us talk about leading anew
How about, let's talk about
Being a leader of the new school

[Inspiratonal beat starts]
(Young female voice arises)
I do want us to look at how leaders are made, right?
So, leaders are not being made
In the same way that they used to
And when leadership is being made [?]
There's no sacrifice, there's no scarring
There's no embedding of pain
There's certain things that have to go into leadership
That will sustain it
Leadership is not all popularity
It is not all fun
...Doin' things behind the shadow of a leader, right?
And another leader...
So, part of my gifting to this generation
Is to invite them to know
That there is a season and a time for everything, right?
And do not rush your time, do not rush your time
Some things have to be made through pain
And not just through the glamour of life
As we have here today
(Applauding crowd: Wow; Say it again; Preach!)

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
As we always aspire to aspire
More greatly
Just know, there will always be
Only one leaders of the new school.  Forever!
