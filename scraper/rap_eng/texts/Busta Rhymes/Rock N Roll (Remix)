[Intro: DJ Khaled]
It’s the remix!
Ayo Raekwon, we in the jungle with this rock ‘n’ roll shit
I’ma serve the streets with that West Coast Game
I’ma serve the streets with that Pharrell
Shit, I’ma serve the streets with that Busta Rhymes
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi, you know me
How he flying in the air like we ‘Living on a Prayer’, ow
We on the corner serving that Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll, posted on the corner with the Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll

[Verse 1: The Game]
Ayo Chef, let me get my Charles Louboutin on, yeah
Smoking on this Jimi Hendrix, feeling like a rock star
I’m on the block, dawg, leaning on a cop car
Clip the ashes, daydreams of getting knocked off
Most of them niggas be clicking they Tar Heels, Montross
I’m in the Le Montrose, feeling like a mob boss
But I don’t eat spaghetti, nigga, fried wings and hot sauce
Come through the door, get crossed over like Hot Sauce
Warn from the floor, be on the floor with a locked jaw
Told y’all before, man down when them shots off
Why you think I’m leaning on the car? I pay the cops off
Coming at me is like saying toilet paper not soft
Put a hole in one of you rap niggas, not golf
Tell you like ya mama, “I’ll knock your fuckin’ block off”
Rock‘em Sock‘em Robots, you a Waka Flocka knockoff
Say he play the block but can’t get a fuckin’ rock off
Me and Chef, a.k.a. niggas you can’t knock off

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Wanna talk about getting on when I’m already on
And talking ‘bout cars that are foreign, that makes me yawn
37 years since the first day I was born
The first 17 no jew-els I don
The other 20, outlined myself like Tron
So with life is the only thing I’ll be getting on
The Obama on the arm
While y’all niggas out of time like the hour arm’s gone
How’d this mayne get this bling?
Your bitch like, “How’d this thing get that aim?”
Maybe it’s the private planes or tightest chains or
That’s just the game and I’m not playing, nigga
I shake your hands, nigga, we not y’all
You get beef, niggas’ll heat that up, and eat that up
Pssh, see, that’s us
‘Cause lyrically, nigga, I’m three gats tucked
Nigga, what

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger?
Yeah, I bet it will blast ya
Now take a hit of this Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
It’s some powerful shit

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, fuck a carpet, I’ma roll you out a new rug (Yeah)
Baby, let me introduce you to the new drug (Yeah)
Hallucinate a new visual in a new dream (That’s right)
Then sting your nostril a little like methamphetamine (Shit)
The shit I spit at you on your flesh ‘til you properly rotten
Your cold and clammy skin like you was doing Oxycontin
You see the end results of my shit could be frightening
While you try to kill the pain and I ran in like using Vicodin
Triflin’, wanting every gram that I be slicing
When I feed the street the drug to make ‘em bug and get to pricing in
While I give a Metallica dose, squeeze quick
Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, dope fiend shit (Shit)
Then turn ya to a Twisted Sister, that’s what I do with it (Damn)
Then rubber band the bread, that’s how my Motley Crue get it (Yeah)
That old powerful shit, you know that thing that’s potent (Get it)
That indescribable feeling, that thing that keep you open
We smell that lethal smoking

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger?
Yeah, I bet it will blast ya
Now take a hit of this Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
It’s some powerful shit

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Uh huh, yeah, under the building shit, word up, ayo
They say he bury his money in gold caskets
Cabinets of rap books, thrown in some bottles that’s drastic
Scientists of war, flows mastered, everybody notice
The rap elite emerge from a grass clique
Gangstas in Polo gloves, no Lugz, Wallabees successes
I be so obsessed with the plugs
Making money, that’s the novel, Adidas sneaker, lethal reefer
Glass cutter, Cecil, that’s the heat, AK pop off
Green beret on, 40 belows, shoulder ratchet on
Low pullover in the hallway, not asking
Finish killing these little weight niggas
Fuck around, get outta place, I’ma do the haircuts and shape niggas
Bubblegum weed spot, last door at the ski shop
The sequel, come smoke with me and my people
We live like them rollers and Vikings
We known for fighting, come float with me like indictments

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi, you know me
How he flying in the air like we ‘Living on a Prayer’, ow
We on the corner serving that Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll, posted on the corner with the Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll
