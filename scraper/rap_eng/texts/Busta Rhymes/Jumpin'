Yeah

Listen

[Verse: Busta Rhymes & Heather Victoria]
Listen, see it was one of those days and the sky was blue
You niggas better roll out the carpet, the god is comin' thru
Hey its Busta rhymes
Hello happy to meet you
I keep the hot shit, now turn ya volumes up
Blow ya speakers (What), I'm on top and the feeling's lonely
You understand what I'm sayin'
Excuse me dear
Yeah I know
You look nice
With a Roberto Cavalli two-piece, enough ice
Thanks, appreciate a little love from you
How 'bout it, daddy, can I get in the club with you (nuh-uh)
Shorty lucky that she had a behind on her
Pretty face starin' while I'm claimin' my shine on her
She say;
Oh my gosh I can't be mad at you
You look like ya own a diamond market somewhere in Africa (Ha ha ha ha ha) I hope you find that funny
Soon as we step in the club we started throwin' 'round money
You haters wanna beef please, don't even try it
'Fore my niggas bust a Mac in the club and cause a riot (blaow, blaow, blaow)
You better enjoy the night and get ya party on
Before you try to diss (Who?) the Don Corleone (Me?)
Aye, what's ya name son, yes it's Busta Bust
It's a must (?)
There go that chick again
Sorry and I know it's low class
Can you please pour a little champagne in my glass
I'm glad you got me in here, thanks for looking out for me
I know I'm reaching but ain't got no money on me
Long chain dangle wit your diamond rings
A lot of bottles on the table, you doin' your thing
Niggas touchin' me, I might have to bounce quick
I left my purse in the car, it don't match my outfit
Ya outfit?! You think it's easy as that
Like you ain't about to give the kid a little head in the back
I said "You probably took on more than you can muster
Trick, let me spell my name out for you, Busta
B - boss nigga
U - undisputed
S - I'm sick, I make a mothafucka lose it
T - I be the top dog runnin' the spot
And niggas know the way we doin' it, A - I won't stop
Bang these streets while I be reppin' and writin' now
Take your temperature you play your cards right
And just about then all of my niggas got in
They rushed the door, police front like they ain't lettin' 'em in
Mook started rollin' some more and stood up right at the door
And started baggin' every single pretty bitch that he saw
And made 'em come along, see now this shit is full swing
Niggas still thirsty at the door tryna get in
Meanwhile I'm (wylin', fightin', they black for a many?)
Then we planned a jumpoff for later and every shawty wit' it
You know the way we do it, this shit is only the norm
Fire marshall in the spot, they try to turn the lights on
That's when we
Walked in the club and as far as I could see
Shit was jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
Just jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
All these hoes on the floor and as far as I could see
Shit was jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
Just jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
All these niggas on the wall and as far as I could see
Shit was jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
Just jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
All these hoes on the floor and as far as I could see
Shit was jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
Just jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
Just jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
Just jumpin' (jumpin') just jumpin' (jumpin')
