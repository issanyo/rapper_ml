[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Remix, Miss Fiona
You know it just your boy Busta Bust
I got a gift I've been wanting to give you a long time, check

[Busta Rhymes]
In case it was misunderstood
If you let me give it to you, I'mma give it to you good
Give it to you every opportunity I can
As far back, seated on the hood of the car
No obligation, ma, you know I'm with that
Long as you respect me, I respect you back
Let me keep you stressed free, baby girl, no pressure
Extra, when I give it to you on the dresser
Look, don't run from it, baby, hold steady
Let me give it to you throughbred, grown man ready
Lay the game down heavy, baby girl, ain't never end so good
You gon' wanna talk about me to your friends
Go ahead and teach me, maybe we can get up later
You know how to reach me, baby
I'mma call you my teacher
Cuz if you can't give it to me right, I don't want it at all neither

[Chorus: Melanie Fiona]
I don't want it all the time
But when I get it, I, have to be satisfied
So give it to me right, or don't give it to me at all
I don't think you understand
How real it is to me to find a man who thinks he can
So give it to me right, or don't give it to me at all

[Raekwon]
I love you with your hair low, there you go
Bought every color bag, made your gear game grow
You was fly, still, everybody knew I ride
I had a good one, she knew the times, thrown her up
Miss Fiona, sassy, sleep me over
Jump in the fence, just to sneak, creep over, baby
Lady with a good heart, a good home
A good dude, come out of Bloom', it's over
Hah, you know I'm insecure, now
Jump out the Rose wit the ring and go south
I'm never that beefy, you complete me
All of that riffing and dripping and street beef
Yeah, all the punks, I picked 'em
Just like the boogers on your face, I licked 'em
Yeah, you know you extra sassy
Who gave you life, who made you classy?

[Chorus II: Melanie Fiona]
I don't want it all the time
But when I want it, you, better make me smile
So give it to me right, or don't give it to me at all
I don't think you understand
If you can't please me, I, know someone who can
Give it to me right, or don't give it to me at all

[Melanie Fiona]
This is the real life, baby
This is the life that makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is the real thing, baby
When I'm alone I can make me say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus II]

[Outro: Melanie Fiona]
Give it to me right, yeah, yeah
Give it to me right, yeah, yeah
Give it to me right, or don't give it...
