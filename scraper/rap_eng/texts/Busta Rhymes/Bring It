[Hook: Busta Rhymes + Karlie Redd]
Now don't get it fucked up just because I flaunt it (Aye)
Niggas think that they can test me, bring it if you really want it
(I see you around town [?])
Bring, Bring, Bring it
If you, if you really want
Bring, Bring, Bring it
If you, if you really want (You wanna test me?)
Now don't get it fucked up just because I flaunt it
Niggas think that they can test me, bring it if you really want it
Bring, Bring, Bring it, if you, if you really want ([?] you done for)
Bring, Bring, Bring it, if you, if you really want (Hey)
Now don't get it fucked up just because I flaunt it (Karlie Redd)
Niggas think that they can test me, bring it if you really want it
Bring, Bring, Bring it, if you, if you really want
(You don't want none of this! Karlie Redd)
Bring, Bring, Bring it, if you, if you really want
(You not even ready for this)

[Verse 1]
I tell them, bring it, bring it, bring it
If you really, really, want it
They be mad that I get it
And they be mad that I flaunt it
The say that they gone do shit
But I know that they won't
And they say that they do big shit
And I know that they don't
(Hey, hey)
Now everybody round
Talkin 'bout me
On the blogs, internet
And on the tv
Now don't get it fucked up
Just because I flaunt it
You thinking you can test me
Bring it if you really want it

[Chorus]
Bitch bring it, if you like your [?] dirty gyal
Bring it, [?] (*rolls tongue*)
Bring it, call me a real bad gyal
Kimberly and the [?] (Cha)

[Verse 2]
I'm steady getting paid
While you worried 'bout my age
Talk about my ass
While I kill it on the stage
Ask about my daughter
But bitch, you my son
Had the nerve to ask about me and L.A. Reid's son
Question?
Where you getting your weave from? (Karlie Redd)
And why I see you in the bathroom
Gluing your teeth on (Horse)
And you was with R. Kelly
You probably got peed on
Only psycho hoes play the victim
Say they get beat on
(bitch, don't nobody believe that shit)

[Chorus]
Bitch bring it, if you like your [?] dirty gyal
Bring it, [?] (*rolls tongue*)
Bring it, call me a real bad gyal
Kimberly and the [?] (Cha)

Bitches think that they can test me, bring it if you really want Bring, Bring, Bring it, if you, if you really want
Bring, Bring, Bring it, if you, if you really want

[Verse 3]

Hoes send out my name
But every-ting, yes I rented

When you [?] your pum-pum

[Outro]
If I see you on the street, I give you a smooth lick, now you hear me?
You feel me? [?]
Nobody want your man
