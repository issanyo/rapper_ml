[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Notorious is glorious in the sack, hit skins from the back
Put my thumb up in the ass crack
Brooklyn freaky nigga with the most stuff
I’m Jesus pops, Mary just blame Joseph
You should see her drink the semen, she suck a mean one
Leaving them three apostles scheming, see when, BIG fuck a bitch
BIG duck a bitch quick fast
Dick to ass, don’t hesitate to split fast
You know what’s up, here’s a quarter and a buck
My steps is kinda creaky, try not to wake my moms up
Cause when I bust, I lick shots like a shotty
Thats why nut is drippin all over your body!
You know what’s up!

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
B.R. and B.I. get cream, people always sayin’ what the hell does that mean?
Bitches always see me and they can’t understand how I once a little boy and became a man
Now, as for the way we make em scream and shout, bitches
One by one I knock you out, bitches
One by one I knock you out, bitches
One by one I knock you out, bitches

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
You’re dippin your hand in the grab bag
Stopping and than I drop it, and pop em, dig up all in your ass bag
She giving me head all up in the back of the damn cab
The meter running hoping shawty paying the damn tab
She how the ass drag
This shit big, thats why we fuck em New York all the way down to Baghdad
Stabbing the pussy and jabbing like I’m Zab Judah
And plummet her pussy with plungers like I’m Roto Rooter
Beat the pussy til the shit flab
And wear it out til it swole and the coochie smelling like king crab
This type of dick is something this bitch never had
And make her swollow the dick til the bitch gag
Get mad, chick grabbing all over my jonhson, Charles Bronson
Big slab of meat, hungry and fresh of a monthly so she had to eat
Throwing me the ass and we ain't even have to speak

[Hook]
