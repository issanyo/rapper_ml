[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The Anarchy, Busta Rhymes shit, c'mon

[Chorus]
Ready for Busta Rhymes
He's the one we've all, been waiting for, forever
(I feel so fuckin good, my people)
Ready for Flipmode Squad
(So powerful, so good today)
They're the ones we've all, been waiting for, forever
(Yeah, yeah, new "Rulership")
Ready for Busta Rhymes
(It feels so fuckin good in my soul, come on)
He's the one we've all, been waiting for, forever
(I wanna see y'all, all my people if you feel good)
Ready for Flipmode Squad
(Just talk to me, c'mon, c'mon)
They're the ones we've all, been waiting for, forever
(Now, now, let me see y'all, so powerful)
Ready

[Verse]
All praise due, we comin' through real hard
Niggas raisin they right hand, salutin' the God
Yo, like a burnin' sensation of Henny on the first sip
Hot shit my nigga; let me spit a verse quick
Work shit inward, until my niggas hurt shit
And plot elaborate schemes for monies niggas worship
Beautiful like the pleasure of when I burst my first clip
At a nigga who sold me a brick that wasn't WORTH shit
Yo, we bomb shit, fire alarm shit
With my bitches who take packages under they armpit
Now, we remain the Imperial live niggas
Who consistently blackout and rep for them wild niggas
Yo, you incompatible, snatch yo' collateral
Gun blunt you, and rep for every thug capital
Diagonal vision, niggas seein' shit on slant
Plant beatings on niggas and celebrate a war chant
Diabolic how we manifest raw logic
Chronological time, we bring niggas the raw project
Hold fort and represent as the grand wizard
Street chronicle illustrate the bakin' of a bad blizzard
I got a spot for ya
With live niggas who murder sloppier
Than all of the Trenchcoat Mafia yo
Cause when you hear the sweet music playin'
It's like theme music for murder scenes
Like the Colorado slayin' 'cause I don't give a fuck
Speedin like we racin' on the Aqueduct
Black tinted-out, government truck
Curbside on niggas, leanin' just a little bit
Trunk trapped with smoke, my bitch'll take a little hit
Fake niggas could be the BEST actors
My bullets whiz so fast you feel the wind chill factors
In the wrong place you get your WIG peeled backwards
Get an ounce of the 'dro and STEAM a pack of Blackwoods

[Chorus]
Ready for Busta Rhymes
He's the one we've all, been waiting for, forever
(Yeah, yeah, just feel what I feel niggas)
Ready for Flipmode Squad
(Yeah, just reach up and just touch the sky niggas)
They're the ones we've all, been waiting for, forever
(Now, hah, yeah, I try so hard to just share that shit that I'm feelin')
Ready for Busta Rhymes
(All my niggas just talk to me)
He's the one we've all, been waiting for, forever
(So powerful, Flipmode Squad now)
Ready for Flipmode Squad
(Yeah, new "Rulership," all my niggas just walk in line)
They're the ones we've all, been waiting for, forever
(Walk in line with me, talk to me now)

[Outro]
Welcome, we are now in the current state of the Anarchy
We fight, to survive niggas
We fight, to rule our own government
We livin' in a current state, of no fuckin government
Niggas don't even know how to follow they own spirit
Lost niggas, unsure niggas, insecure niggas
Fuck that, salute, all our motherfuckers
All my niggas ready to hold it down on the front line
We survived it niggas, two-thousand
Time for the new bloodline to run shit
Enjoy the album
