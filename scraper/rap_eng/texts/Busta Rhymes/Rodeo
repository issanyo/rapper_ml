[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Turn ya radio up, like you don't give a fuck
Turn ya radio up, on ya stereo
Turn ya radio up, like you don't give a fuck
Turn ya radio up, on ya stereo

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (bang)
Got ya girl why you mad at me for? (bang)
I never seen a ass like this before (damn)
You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (bang)
Got ya girl why you mad at me for? (bang)
I never seen a ass like this before (damn)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Turn ya radio up, lets have a party
Lets celebrate the fact that I'm back killing everybody
Put it in lemme get a bottles in the air we doing it bigger
Game over bitch, cause I ain't playing with none of you niggas
See me stay in tune it's why me and streets is so connected
From gotta get this dollar, to smashing niggas on they record
You gotta respect it, ain't nothing you can do to prevent it
Or defend it, embrace it gracefully as I bless it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (bang)
Got ya girl why you mad at me for? (bang)
I never seen a ass like this before (damn)
You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (bang)
Got ya girl why you mad at me for? (bang)
I never seen a ass like this before (damn)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Turn ya radio up, like you don't give a fuck
Turn ya radio up, on ya stereo
Turn ya radio up, like you don't give a fuck
Turn ya radio up, on ya stereo

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'ma turn the radio up so I drown out all the shit you talking
Acting like a saint bitch you know that you not in New Orleans
Bottles of that Ace on ya face, molly's got you rolling
Motivate you to put it on me like you Kelly Rowland
Get it all in her gut, smack her butt, now her belly swollen
My balls got her pent up like I'm fuckin bowling
Either pay me for this appearance or just stop promoting
My name Curry, Wait! But I'ma keep going

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (bang)
Got ya girl why you mad at me for? (bang)
I never seen a ass like this before (damn)
You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (bang)
Got ya girl why you mad at me for? (bang)
I never seen a ass like this before (damn)
