[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready?
Yea
Are you ready to make some noise?
Put your hands together
I want everybody in here to stand up on your feet
Turn my music up
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise
I want everybody in here to stand up on your feet
Aye, where’s Spliff at?
There’s about to be a problem now nigga

[Verse 1]
Once I captured the soul of the street it’s so hard for me to let go
Respect down at the techno, hear the stadium echo
Now it’s reaching a vile when the weakness is silent
Putting the fear of God in ‘em while I’m shifting the climate
The gladiator presence, everything about me giant
This the year of the dragon with a heart of a lion
Got ‘em throwin’ their swag up, how I come to provide it
Now we makin’ ‘em riot till we makin’ ‘em try it
You can never deny it, how I came to prescribe it
Then bangin’ with the ship like Earth and Jupiter collided
Then I came, I’m remindin’ em, of how the spark ignited ‘em
And conquered continents the size of Asia times five of ‘em
And while I ride for them, you think it’s loud to them?
I give pride to them and get it rough with them
I hate the street that with you, it smell like earth burn
I captivate ‘em with my first words, everybody

[Hook]
(Shout, shout, I’m talking to you)
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise

[Verse 2]
(Holla!) back to applyin’ the pressure
Bother your corner stretcher, hot like a lot of pepper
Most of you niggas off, cotton and polyester
You know how I know all, legend like Robert Nesta
You know I’m out to get you, take all the robs count
And power to the Billies, couple cigar lounge
See how I make it pop? Knockin’ them all down
Watchin’ them all drown, this how the love sound
Your swag off, you know you really need to look around
And try to find it nigga, searchin’ the lost sound
But I welcome the hate, my mother prayin’ for me
Got too much money to count, my niggas winnin’ for me
Let me appraise you closely
They can’t believe the way we busted up like it’s not the problem is we just playin’ homie
And when we in the spot, there won’t be no delayin’
Only to collect another trophy, now the haters say it for me

[Hook]

(Shout, shout, I’m talking to you)
