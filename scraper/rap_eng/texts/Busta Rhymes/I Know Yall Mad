My clique; Ice Age gansta team
Pull up in the drop with the gangsta lean
And I stay on the block where the gangsta's be
Never hang where them wanskstas be
Cause back then I used to move them dimes
On the mic I was quick to bust a rhyme
Now I charge a fee just to
Bust that rhyme
Ice Age, Flipmode ask Busta Rhymes
I stay on the scene white cup full of lean
With a bad ass chick sitten next to me
And I didn't have to get a hold no extacy
And the bitch didn't want to have sex with me
Cause she already know I'm the boss
Blindin' by the ice on my wrist and the cross
Rollin on 4's every time I floss
AK by my waste, can't take no loss because
Down south we be ridin' on 4's
Pimpin' them hoes slidin down that poll
Keep diamonds shinin' cause we far from broke
Keep diamonds shinin' cause we far from broke
Got Ice Age across my fist
Pull up in the lot, drop top with a bitch
Cause nigga's pissed cause I'm filthy rich
Wait till they see that I run this shit
Ice Age in the place
Puttin' diamonds in these haters face
I'm a ghetto star with house and cars
I guess that's why these haters hate
I said, Ice Age in the place
Puttin' diamonds in these haters face
I'm a ghetto star, with house and cars
I guess that's why these haters hate
I know y'all mad cause I roll in the Rolls
I know y'all mad cause I be pimpin' these hoes
Pimpin these hoes, Pimpin these hoes, Pimpin these hoes
I see y'all mad cause we be gettin' that dough

I know y'all mad at my pricey clothes
I'm a feisty nigga with a icy glow
I know y'all mad cause how my chain swing low
How I get that gauva, Now I get that dough
I be fuckin' it up
And I be cuttin' it up
And I be drunkin em up
And I tote two .45's
Tuckin' em up all on the side of my truck
As far as duckin' to what
Your gonna get to two hollow tips stuck in your gut
You people can't do nothing so they suckin' it up
So what you fussin' for? (what?)
And homey wait one second
Hold up a minute nigga you know I ain't checkin
I'm comin' up in this niggas
Up in the zone, you see the game like drugs, can't leave it alone
You see I'm keepin' the chrome in my waist line nigga
While I sit on my throne
And I get richer bitch, nigga me and Mike Jones
Y'all niggas got it all wrong Busta Bust in the building
If you think a nigga strong enough to fuck with us
A nigga King Kong so what, you want it nigga?
You could get it on to fuck
A little bit a snap when I get up in it (hoo)
A take a nigga trap, cause I came to get it (hot)
I might not wanna see nigga hit it (hoo)
At the ballpark, see the way I wear my fitted?
Let the bitch talk to them on phone
Get the gossip in up out a nigga, see we well known
Now Flipmode, Ice Age set the tone
From the Madison Square Garden to the Astrodome

I know y'all mad cause I roll in the Rolls
I know y'all mad cause I be pimpin' these hoes
Pimpin' these hoes, pimpin' these hoes, pimpin' these hoes
I see y'all mad cause we be gettin' that dough

I know y'all mad at my pricey clothes
I'm a feisty nigga with a icy glow
I know y'all mad cause how my chain swing low
How I get that guava, Now I get that dough
