[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Yo, this is the way it's goin' down
We come in compound, releasin' double-rounds in hound
Like heat sensors, your defense techniques are no match
When I begin to draw back, cover up your cardiac
'Cause I'll arrest ya, when I penetrate feel the pressure
The critical perfectionist, rhythmic expressionist
We comin' deadlier than venom
And you'll be scared to pick the mic up again
Lyrically, you on the level of "Green, Eggs and Ham"
Your best bet is fold 'cause I gots a bigger hand
Plus I'm steppin' like a monster so go-go and scram
You ain't experienced, you lucky if you ride the ambulance
'Cause when you dealin' with fool Will is quite fatal
Shape-shiftin brothers like Play-Doh
Your rhymes are anal, and we ain't got no time to play no
Games, put the mic down, boy, try not to say no
More o' them rhymes 'cause you duplicate like Kinkos
You're a carbon copy with the wrinkles
You whacka than that nigga that be rhymin' in the Pringle commercials
Put your career in reversal

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
No need to front, that's what it is
I gotta get into you
Oh, I gotta show you what it is
Gotta get into you

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Strong communicator called the Black Eyed Peas
Hard illustrator co-coordinate with ease
And duplicator crew, we put em all on freeze
Lock em in the cell, then throw away the keys
Another lost identity in disease
Entity with a so-called MC enemies
Will decrease when I step into your sceneries
Of course now you off-course lost up in the source
I'm running out of time, there's no time for no scrimmage
A race to raid the diamonds and replace it with the real image
Picture that, I know where I'm at
I know where I'm going and I'll be back
With a stronger impact lyrics be intact
Get you intoxicated when black attack
With the full-force pressure, hard to measure
On a rated scale, whack MC's won't prevail
On a dream of makin' cream, braggin' about infrared beams
But it seems all they really pullin' is pullin' them schemes
I take it back to the essence of hip-hop
Never will I stop with my beat-box

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
No need to front, that's what it is
I gotta get into you
Oh, I gotta show you what it is
Gotta get into you

[Bridge: Kim Hill]
Can you feel it?
Hmm, I gotta get into you
Oh, I'm gonna show you what it is
I wanna get into you

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
No need to front, that's what it is
I gotta get into you
Oh, I gotta show you what it is
Gotta get into you
No need to front, that's what it is
I gotta get into you
Oh, I gotta show you what it is
Gotta get into you
