And try to give a nigga just a little butt now

Like a motha f**kin' tattoo

Everytime we come through
All the bitches shout (whoop whoop woo)
All of my niggas shine if you ready (yeah yeah)
Let me blow for a few
Nigga c'mon
Bounce in the street
With the heat stashed under the seat
In a range that's blue nigga (c'mon)
Cats like you be searching the crib
All the weakling niggas in your crew nigga (c'mon)
Everytime a nigga come step in the spot
Y'all niggas know we come to blow the venue nigga (c'mon)

Because they might just tow your truck from the spot
