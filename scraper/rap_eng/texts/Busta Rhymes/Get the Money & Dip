[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh
Uh, uh yeah
No doubt, uh
Ladies and gentlemen
It's the world premiere of the world's greatest
LBS, Rampage the Last Nigga
One time, uh

[Rampage]
When I watch Batman, my favorite man was the Joker
Now I'm runnin kids out the game just like poker
Fuck all you niggas that's commin mediocre
I could rock around a yo-yo, plus smoke ya
And make ya catch a seisure
Now this shit ain't I'm from the milk on Magnesia
You caught a heart attack, ya name is Mike Weever
You die, what? From the two degree fever
Me and my mans, lay it back, smokin cheeba
Straight funk flat, plus I'mma make you a believer
Ya dead on ice, that means you stoned to the freezer
They wanna bury you next to that girl
It's the heavyweight, yo I'm out to bring ruck
Watch you get bucked, pressin ya luck
Your times up, now who's the sub zero
Lockin shit down like Robert DeNiro
It's the Boy Scout, your superhero
What's the info, yes yes I'm a nympho, fuck ya demo
Ya limo, and ya bimbo, from here to the Projects
I get nuff respect
I got a fan base, so I roll correct
Me and Scratch, do it since possin nuff threats
We knockin brothers off the fields like the Mets

Chorus 4.25X: Busta Rhymes

Come in, come in the trip
Makin moves and slip
Get the money & drop
Get my fifth on my hip

[Rampage]
Yo I'm from the mans of the flaps
Where niggas pack gats under their dreads
Still on the corner hustlin crack
I used to boost to Macy's
On Saturday, I used to be at Lacie's
Back then, I thought a nigga couldn't phase me
My mom duke, said to Boy Scout was crazy
I'm 19, I got a baby on the way
Guilt the way I'm going on
I'm hittin brothers every day
From here to Fort Greene, me and my cousin Kareem
I got a scheme, fuck a hope and a dream
I gotta get this cream, roll up with the gangsta lean
Real niggas in the hood, know what I mean
I pack heat, hundred dollar Nike's on my feet
I'm livin like, I'm just another hungry brother in the street
That gotta eat

Chorus 4.25X
