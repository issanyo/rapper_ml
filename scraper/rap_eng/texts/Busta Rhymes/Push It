[Verse 1]
I was mobbin' through the beach, yeah the city by the sea
Mama tried to keep me home, but I love the fuckin' streets
I was cookin' up a Ki, tryna serve it to the streets
Couple niggas had beef so I had to Chief Keef
I got homies from the 2, I got homies from the 3
I keep everything neutral, I just wanna smoke a leaf
I was runnin' up a check, try me, he gon' get the TEC
Hear a lot of niggas talk, ain't a nigga 'press me yet
I'm in Houston, V Live, throwin' racks, that's a bet
And you ain't a real nigga if you don't rep your set

[Hook]
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money

Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money

[Verse 2]
Cooking on a pot, had to scale and weigh the rock
Almost burned my fuckin' hand, I forgot this shit was hot
I'm just tryna get a knot, had the shit up in my sock
Leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, I could work my own block
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
All these racks I could trick on
I got gold digger money, gold digger money
Hood rich nigga gettin' money, pushin' weight
Everything was an 8, now it's lookin' like a plate

[Hook]
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
