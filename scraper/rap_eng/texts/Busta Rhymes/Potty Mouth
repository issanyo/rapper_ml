[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh
One shot, bomboclat
Bitches jumping on my dick, hopping like it's hopscotch
Booty pop, my bitch don't wear that she prolly ass shots
I don't give a fuck, I fuck 'em all till they pussy ouch
Potty mouth, oochie wally, bang, bang, then I'm out
Once u-fucking-pon a time, had your bitch inside my house
Cooking grits and riding dick
Swear she the best chef around
Pop that pussy, now let me see you doo doo brown
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
Tell these bitch niggas it's they time of the month, time of the month
Niggas want beef but I eat that shit, eat eat, everything well done
I'm so far in the clouds I can barely hear
All that shit you rocking, boy, that was last year
GOAT's here, niggas steer my style like a stop deer
Pump fear to you bitches heart, Suge without the beard
Man, all these new niggas weird
They all lining up to come and see the last king

[Hook: Tyga]
I get money, I make money
I take money, them bitches want it from me, 'cause I'm
I'm 'bout whatever, I'm 'bout whatever
I'm with whatever, man, I do it, do it better
Two more shots, then I'm out
I'm a motherfucker and I got a potty mouth
I'm 'bout whatever, man, I'm 'bout whatever, man
I'm with whatever, man, I do it, do it better

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Man, I fucked your dime and now she's mine
2 Live Crew, put the pussy in my palm
She put on a nigga and make a grown man cry
Selling bullshit, I don't pay you no mind
But whats your sign? Gemini?
Scorpio, let me fuck from behind
However you want it, baby
Light the blunts, blunts and close your eyes
Real nigga doe, real nigga doe
Gotta freak bitch in the DBI, put me on doe
Came in the door, kicked in the door
Waiving the .44, put one, one in your blowhole
Man, your paper thin, you need to take some notes
Niggas steal my lines and say they don't, there go another new quote
I'm fresh off the boat, nigga, let's toast
Young Money real, y'all shit just a hoax
Made a fairy tale, busy on a float
Why would I lie? Forever under oath, I'm
So fucking frustrated with your lady
Get a flight, I send her home
Man, my love is, oh, so tainted
If you fine, you might get diamonds, if you a five, you might get nothing
I'm on my monsters, they from a moshpit
R-r-r-rock you like Nirvana
Man, I be off Patron like it's a holiday
Fucking with them finer things, pull up on your bitch and say

[Hook: Tyga]
I get money, I make money
I take money, them bitches want it from me, 'cause I'm
I'm 'bout whatever, I'm 'bout whatever
I'm with whatever, man, I do it, do it better
Two more shots, then I'm out
I'm a motherfucker and I got a potty mouth
I'm 'bout whatever, man, I'm 'bout whatever, man
I'm with whatever, man, I do it, do it better

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Man, I fucked your dime
Still in my prime
Young D, I'm freshest nigga on the line
Better man up, it's about to go do-down
Leave you with jaw-dropped, face on the gr-dround
Let the rain fill the moats round my kingdom
Carved in the cement, star, pledge allegiance
I'ma let you leave em screaming
Dreaming just to get by
Girl you so fly-fly, why you so high?
Two-two more shots, then I'm out
I'mma motherfucking potty mouth
I'm 'bout whatever, I'm 'bout whatever
I'm 'bout whatever, man, I do it, do it better
A-all bad bitches in my house
I'm a motherfucker, fuck her, then I kick her out-out
I'm 'bout whatever, I'm 'bout whatever
I'm 'bout whatever, man, I do it, do it better

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Cannibal, I eat you raw meat
I'm raw with beats
So scavenger with it, nigga look like Jaws with feet
You don't want it, bitch
Y'all niggas know I get gully, what you want?
Listen close, y'all don't hear how the beat get ugly when a motherfucker come through?
Excuse me, bitch
Please let me kill it just a little bit and let a nigga do what he do
That movie shit, that Tec make a niggas wanna vomit spit
You niggas already knew
She keep on fronting niggas, then I'm lighting up another city
Got her fighting 'till they get to biting, they we getting gritty
See the time and now a nigga climbing up another milli
Then we shining 'till a nigga blind them, up until it kills me
Forth and back and my dying is a nigga 'till it pulls up on the track
Then I'mma die sixty niggas 'till we pop off like we in the Wild West
When I finished giving you the crack (whaaat?!)
If you knew I'm in route to the crib just to park the Bugatti at the house
Sin big and one of my bitches really turn her out now
Still everyone know I got a potty mouth now
Shiiiit, they got me doing it again
Back to bodying the things and lots of screwing other women
You can never stop the shit that I be doing
And the way that we moving
Get it popping, never stopping, kill em in the end now
And I'mma get 'em to the point when I got 'em all open, handling my business with em, ha!
Trust me you don't wanna start 'cause you know it's torture!
Every single minute til I finish with 'em
And I knock shit down
Every time I come and then I lock shit down
'Till I come up place niggas better drop that crown
Ever here, 'fore I gotta pop you clowns
And I go erase niggas!
