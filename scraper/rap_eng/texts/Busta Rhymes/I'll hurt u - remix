Yeah
Guess who it is
Aayo Dre I think they in trouble
Scott Storch why you have to do it like this to 'em?
Feels like a new day
Listen
Now every time I come in, I hit ya niggas with shit
Regardless, you get retarted and then niggas ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do or say what I say
And spit what I spit, you ain't never even gotta question who
'Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that could ever come
And spitefully turn the place into a muthafuckin' zoo
Than I come in, I still go crazy sh sh sh shit
Ma, ma, ma, makin' n, ni, ni niggas do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view instead of tryin' to step up
You still tryin' to play catch up and keep up with the way ya nigga grew
These niggas panic and frett and get schizophrenic
And let they emotions out and I doubt they could ever touch my crew
Take a second, check it, I reckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded that why your shit is through
You fuckin' idiot I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever period every syllable is true
Now if you ain't blind and you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple or nothing that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggas could never ever really fuck wit me
'Cause I'll hurt you
And I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you
And I'll finish your career for you, I'll
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
You bunch of bumblin' fools who got me grumblin' dudes
All the way down the block
Keep 'em stumblin' and jumblin' over they wall
Jump ours throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock
And you wanna know the time, see you tired of all your
Ma, ma mumblin', ma, ma mumblin', na, na nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in the CD playa
And turn up the volume you bang your head
Because this shit'll knock ock
Continue to crumblin' niggas and tumblin' niggas
You struggle while I humble a niggas wit the Glock
Than I watch you while I keep a fumblin'
While I got you ta tre tremblin'
For one of my niggas bust your head wit a rock
Before I start to do another thing I'ma make you crown
Me the king wit such a butter swing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds
The summer bling when I'm climbin' and from a glimpse
Tell you bitch to get of my yatch
Now if you ain't blind and you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple or nothing that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try no matter how much you make
An effort you niggas could never ever really fuck wit me
'Cause I'll hurt you
And I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you
And I'll finish your career for you, I'll
