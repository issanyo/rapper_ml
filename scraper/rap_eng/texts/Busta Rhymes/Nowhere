Let my lips be your bar, yeah
Come and take a sip
Let your hips be your car
Girl, vallet over here

Let me in your private party
Put my bottle all on your body
You can dance on the pole
Some movie up and near the show

So bring your body close to mine
This is the hottest spot tonight

So you can tell your friends that you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
We're goin' out tonight but you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

I make you wanna stay in the house
Have a party here on the couch
Fuckin' with me you ain't gon' wanna go
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

Know that brother blowin' up your phone
Tell him 'bout this new shit you on
Tell him how I got you in the zone
And you don't need nobody else

'Cause girl, I got these dollars for ya
It's rainin' in the livin' room
Kissed you on your shoulder baby, bend it over
With me and you the party's never over

So bring your body close to mine
This is the hottest spot tonight

So you can tell your friends that you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
We're goin' out tonight but you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

I make you wanna stay in the house
Have a party here on the couch
Fuckin' with me you ain't gon' wanna go
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

Okay, I ain't seen you in a while
Baby, let me get a hug
Reminisce on how I fit you
Perfect like surgical gloves

Ever since you let me hit it
And your skin'll burn the rug
Or the rug'll burn your skin
Mami, you would make me love

The way you give it to a nigga
You would never play with that
Defenseless even though I was relentless
You would take it back

Hittin' every corner pocket
Shift a couple vital organs
Puttin' each other to sleep
And dreamin' 'til tomorrow mornin'

It's really good to feel you
Yes, it is
Then we drink and start thinkin'
About all of the shit we did

And the things we still be doin'
Let's take time and really own it
Let's marinate all in it
Let's embellish in the moment

Should be feelin' special, don't it?
'Specially when I'm left alone with you
Nothin' left to do, mami, come and get up on it
See everythin' is feelin' right
That's why we stayin' home tonight

So you can tell your friends that you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
We're goin' out tonight but you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

I make you wanna stay in the house
Have a party here on the couch
Fuckin' with me you ain't gon' wanna go
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
