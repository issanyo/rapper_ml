And we always handle business cause we 'BOUT gettin this paper

Hopping in any vehicle I choose
I get up in that 'Vet and start it all you hear is vrooom
Roaring up the engine 'till it blew like a balloon
Light my dutch hit the clutch throw it in the gear and peeew
Riding in the fast cars driving like it's NASCAR
Tearing up the asphalt when I'm in that Jaguar
Dipping away from Nason, redlining the dash board
Exhaust blowing fire like a rocket 'bout to blast off, fast yo

Everyday we gotta go secure another win

When we in the building, here we go again
Couple Porsches, couple Bugatti's, Phantoms

Suited and booted, SLR McLaren, Benzes
Rolling see the way we holding, see the money folding
Everybody see the way we hit it, chosen when we hit the road and
Everthing is golden ya'll already know how we get it (through)
Peel out on they ass, 160 read on the dash
Hand on the wheel and my feet on the gas (CONGLOMERATE) got everything on smash

See the way we do it, see the way we cut up
Put ya money where ya mouth is or shut up
