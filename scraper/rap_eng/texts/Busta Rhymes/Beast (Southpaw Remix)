[Intro: Hustle]
When the sun rises
I wake up and chase my dreams
I won't regret when the sun sets
Cause I live my life like I'm a beast
I'm a mothafucking beast

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo back to make you run around again like it's a fire
I spit acid bitch like I got cyanide in my saliva
Watch me wet and heat shit up like I'm a washer and a dryer
While I beat you in your head until you tire
(I'm a motherfucking beast)
See the way we got all my niggas is open
I'm doing it again trippin' and it won't stay
Got a nigga wilding like he in a bull pen
Look at me wishing I had him hoping
But I will diminish and I stop and I won't finish
But I drop and always kill a nigga hotter than a skillet
Think you're fucking with a god? You gotta be joking
Every single time you niggas see me, step inside the do'
Killing everything with a thousand gorillas, behind me so
I suggest you bow to let your chick eat my salami slow
While I continue to dazzle niggas in the hood with that tsunami flow
Get back homie before you get snapped
Even got a bitch strapped in the club with a snub nose
While I make them black with a bang and then a crack
Niggas in the head I'm back, everybody 'til the club close
Mm-hmm.. Haters I see you sitting over there
That's why you see me blacking everywhere

[Hook: Bailey]
I'ma motherfucking beast
I'ma, I'ma fuckin' beast
I'ma mothafuckin' beast
Fucking mothafucking beast
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
I'm a motherfucking beast, right
Homie, welcome to the east side, where the killers reside
We playing war games, please hide
Ain't no signs of peace, so fuck a peace sign, we ride (ride)
Bust shots from the car seat
Or maybe hang you 'til your neck is broke
Choke with you with a Stethoscope
That's how I kill a motherfucker in a heartbeat on a dark street
(I'm a motherfucking beast)
I'm a motherfucking beast, right
Keep a three-five-seven in the Levi's
When the beef fries, House Gang hoodie is the disguise
Look in these eyes, last thing you gon’ see when the heat flies
Yo, is it we dumb or is it the city we from
Got us killing each other over these bread crumbs?
You fuck with me it's gonna be cranberry and one-fifty-one
That’s murder backwards: red rum
I done seen a nigga dumping with the pistol
Pull a gunmen out the window of a rental situation, detrimental
Little kids are getting caught up in the middle when the kill is accidental
That's why I'm keeping a pistol, matter of fact capture my enemy
Kidnap or slap him in the back of the Infinity
Bandanas to mask the identity
And start spazzing like Charles Manson on Absinthe and Hennessy
Fight back, attack me with energy
Spiked bats will add to your injury
When I write raps you have to have a Bachelors in Chemistry
Or a Masters in Math to be in the actual vicinity
To pass me up mentally, to match my agility
From Aspen to Italy, I have the ability
To send your ass to the Trinity
Like death when it's after the Kennedy's

[Hook: Bailey]
I'ma motherfucking beast
I'ma I'ma fuckin' beast!
I'ma mothafuckin' beast
Fucking mothafucking beast
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
People wanna know how I am still hungry
But they don't know how the IRS hung me
What do you do when they take all your money?
Get green like Gumby, come back like a bungee
All of my grief, it has made me unleash
On a bum all opponents will cease
So I'm yelling to the north
And the south, and the west and the east
(I'm a motherfuckin' beast)
When you don't have nothing
Only other way that you go is to mad toughen
The craft up in the lab buckin' up to the bad luck
In a flash uppin' the cash stuffed in the bag
And you gotta get it no matter what
Don't got the money to put enough in ya gut
I gotta be the killer, cause I was stuck in a rut
My energy will never let 'em leave us in the dust
The lupus killed my mother
Something really stupid filled my brothers
And now they beginning treating me ill like others
When real life smothers, I kill like thuggers and bang
Fighting my way on top of the game with the pain I write this
I came to ice shit, I reign tonight, sit you hangin' lifeless
I'm Strange and hype bitch, I aim when I spit
For the win and I'm gonna increase
The pressure when I'm having no peace, feel me!
Because I gotta eat, I won't let that demons release, kill me!
On your soul I will feast, you're gonna need a bishop or priest
I am that monster comin' to get ya' to say the least
(I'm a motherfuckin' beast)

[Hook: Bailey]
I'ma I'ma fuckin' beast!
I'ma mothafuckin' beast
Fucking mothafucking beast
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)

[Outro]
I'm a motherfucking beast!
