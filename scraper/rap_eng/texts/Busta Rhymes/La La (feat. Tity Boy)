David, David, David, David, David Banner

Sittin' in the Caddy, Wright like Betty
Floatin' up the aisle like the bride and her Daddy
Hip hop addict, hip hop addict
Man I swear I'm on top like the attic

Yeah bitch, I be with my dog like Shaggy
And we stay clean but we get dirty like Harry
Flyer than bluebirds, cardinals and canaries
Fuck me, I'm all about Oui like Paris

Hilton Presidential Suite already
I'm richer than Nicole and I'm a lion like her daddy
I'm am hotter than the Sunday after Saturday
I swear I'm a savage like Lil' Webbie and Randy

Oscar De La Hoya, box you like a casket
Or Diego Coralles, nigga keep jabbin'
See my style it varies, like drugs in an alley
My leather so soft my paint prettier than Halle

Wittier than comedy, nigga write a parody
But I ain't tellin' jokes apparently
A parent, yeah my daughter be the twinkle of my eye
You hurt her you kill me and nigga I ain't 'bout to die

See y'all are at ground and my daughter is my sky
I swear I look in her face and I just want to break out and fly
4 tears in my face and you ain't never heard me cry
I'm richer than all y'all, I got a bank full of pride

Ow, started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'

Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

My paint bubbleish, the motor so vicious
The rims the same color as the wrapper of a kiss
First some hyphee, thump it like a piston
And when I'm in Detroit, Iâ€™ll be ballin' like a Piston

Boy, and did I mention I fly like a pigeon
Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin'
I'm 9 under par in the Bentley golf cart
The Polo be cream but the bottle's Caviar

Weezy, I'm sick from all this tourin'
You told me sip this then call me in the morning
And I vow I never trust another one
In my life and then I got horny

Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'

Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

See I ain't goin' nowhere, bitch
You know a nigga been home honey
Money fuckin' retarded, called it down syndrome money
My cake sick shit, been diagnosed sickle cell brain
My revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed

Like a mattress from Sing Sing or way down to Comstock
These bitches call me bling king, I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas flawless in D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass

They movin' on a nigga as I walk through the valley, ready?
And zoom in with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you nigga's can't believe
Like purchase persons, places all them things that you can't conceive

Like interactin' with women the caliber of Janet
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet
I hope you nigga's know just what it is
While I'm countin' my paper, nigga's know I'm handlin' my biz

Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'

Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
