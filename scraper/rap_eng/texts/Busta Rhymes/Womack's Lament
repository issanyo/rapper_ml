[Intro: Ali Shaheed Muhammad]
Whether you up too late, out too long or just way too headstrong
Y'all need to listen to this
An all-points bulletin has been issued for a black truck
A Chevy Silverado or a similar make
Several shots fired
Consider the passengers armed and dangerous
Do not approach
Contact the authorities immediately

[Busta Rhymes]
Funny how these niggas think that they nicer than me
Cause they sit in a cypher spitting they life away
Like they hyper at me
But I don't give a fuck bout none of them niggas cause I'm trifling, see?
As I come back

They reminded you to how you was thinking they better
Well fuck it, I'mma show them who better
And get this berreta, the dilemma is I ain't having that shit
You better step back bitch
As I come back

Black ratchet, black mask, pulled up in the black van
Jumped out of the black van
Ran upon them ready to give him the backhand
Ayo who that nigga? Domino
Sorry nigga he gotta go
As I come back

Yes now all of these bitches is hollering, screaming and running
And niggas is jumping, you hear vehicles
Screeching, you can hear their hearts beating
Why did George Bush, Sr. see ya
As I come back

What the fuck you niggas wanna do now?
Who the fuck is better than who now?
You niggas still wanna battle? I show you how I battle
Domino, better drop to the floor I'm about to pop your face off
As I come back

You and your niggas boasting with all that crescendo
Shots fly that showoff shit y'all was doing fly out the window
But now I'm gunnin' through, where the fuck you niggas runnin' to?
As I come back

Bullets for Phesto, leak like Aquafina trash nigga
The shots'll swell you bigger than Katina ass nigga
Got a couple left for Opio and A-Plus
Watch how the gauge bust
As I come back

Hey Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Ass nigga, back the act quicker and then I spit them at you
Casual, see actually I'll throw a kitchen at you
As I come back

It's Womack bitch, hold that bitch
Hairl long, see if it finna grow back bitch
All day I'm kidnapping one of these niggas
Grab ya nigga Tajai

Uh, uh, uh, all over the track
Tajai you make a move you'll gon' feel a fucking mack
Now put your motherfucking head down nigga
Shut up
