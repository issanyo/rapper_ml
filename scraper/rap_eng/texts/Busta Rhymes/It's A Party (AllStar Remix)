[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
SWV, Busta Rhymes, AllStar
Coming back one time
Blow your mind
Hit you up like that
Throw your hands up - party people in the place
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode Squad all in your face
Yes we coming through, yes you better tie your shoelace

[Chorus: SWV]
We're hanging out all night
Throw your hands up high
We can do it
This is how we party
We're hanging out all night
Throw your hands up high
We can do it
This is how we party

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
It was a party night and everybody was breaking
Niggas spending wild money and bitches got they ass shaking
Son, take time to rewind
And just remember the party time starts at nine
And doesn't end until the sun shine
Every time we surface, overwork this niggaâ€™s purchase
The simple fact they can never hurt this
More live this summer, we gets dumber
Banging beats out your Hummer or your 4Runner
Party time is when (What?) get to fasten your belt
Racing whips down the Franklin D. Roosevelt
Son, no stress at the door, we gets blessed
With the ability to finesse the all access
V.I.P passes, all different classes
Bang asses, look around son, take off your glasses
The DJ announced we in the house
You freaking out
Wildin' to the point where everybody passing out

[Chorus: SWV]
We're hanging out all night
Throw your hands up high
We can do it
This is how we party
We're hanging out all night
Throw your hands up high
We can do it
This is how we party

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Hit you off with a slice to device that I maneuver
My mechanism precise to make you feel nice
Hopscotch, hold your crotch
The top-notch sip on sex on the beaches with cantaloupes and apricots
Yo, what's the time on your watch? Blow the spot
While we leading car lines as long as four blocks
And I would like to say that (You now rocking with best)
Cause the party scenes ripping down in every single summer fest
My advance flow making you dance from here to France
Women ripping through their extra-tight pants
Bounce to fly functions, introductions are made
Follow instructions, believe we keep it fly from the post production
Hot to def, solar eclipse, we take trips and fly with
Women sucking little wide sips
Rocking from party to party
Backyard to yard
We always hold it down my niggas
Flipmode is the squad!

[Chorus: SWV]
We're hanging out all night
Throw your hands up high
We can do it
This is how we party
We're hanging out all night
Throw your hands up high
We can do it
This is how we party

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, we do it like this, ayo, we do it like that
Kid, you can smoke a lot but make sure that you pass it right back
(So we can do it again) and make you party all night
(Keep it movin') Makes you bang your head and lose your eyesight
(You motherfucking right!) You know we keep it extra tight
Feeling dyn-o-mite, niggas freaking broads like they Dolomite
Niggas know the plan when we all step in the jam
Expand the name brand (Flipmode Squad)
You know who I am
Bussa Bus coming through with God we trust
Make you bite the dust
Coming through stacking is always a must
Live roll with us while you chickenheads lust
See you at the jam whether you on the subway or the bus
We make it happen iller, we keeps the party extra live
That makes you bounce around like Bounty Killer, no jive, yo
Just when you think that we about to retire, breaking the wire
Keep it blazing and ignite the party back on fire

[Chorus: SWV]
We're hanging out all night
Throw your hands up high
We can do it
This is how we party
We're hanging out all night
Throw your hands up high
We can do it
This is how we party
