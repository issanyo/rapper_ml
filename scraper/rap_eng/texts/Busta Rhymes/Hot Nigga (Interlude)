[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
So this is how we gon start this shit niggas
I said, so this is how we gon start this shit nigga
I was always told that there's no better time than the present, pweom

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Bitch we back in the spot, niggas
Conglomerate control every block niggas
Bang 'em, tear 'em limb from limb, leave a nigga numb
And make 'em fiend for the official verse when the remix come!

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, y'all niggas gon' have to wait for that for a minute
Let's get back to it
