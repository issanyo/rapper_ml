God I know I've done got away with a lot
I've been keeping account
Figured I'd holla at you for my blessings [?]
Before I kneel down and a choir would sing
A sprinkle holy water on me, Please I need your help with some things
It's mostly complicated lord, I got me sick in the head
I conversate with people who died like I speak with the dead
Laying down with chicks with no feelings, it's like I sleep with the dead
I fed a lot of people poison, now I eat with the dead
Forgive me for the nega-tive
Things I do and things that I said in order
Take it for granted that my words are being recorded
Cheat, lie, deceit, sold drugs and fucked my mistress
Forgive me for the company I kept and murders I witnessed
Thus I never stole a switch and always stayed of my grind
The older folks would try and talk to me and I pay 'em no mind
The old timers, they used to say the devil is coming to get you
Stay on that path, better hope that god is walking it with you
I hope you listening and your hearing my clear
I strive to never say your name in vain
Or ever beg for mercy in fear
Every money option minimal for feeding my fam
Just tryna secure the food, minus the blood on my hands
A couple youngin' follow what we do
The shit is astounding
You can see the wicked in they eye and know the devils' around them
Until it's time, I wait for your arrival
Stick with survival and continue to walk with your blessings
My gun, and my Bible
Hope you forgive me lord

Mossberg on me, up early
Now what's the verdict?
Perspiring, paranoid, peak from curtains
Hearing voices, church lady gave me holy water
Plus some stuff to smear ointments
All over the skin, I hear it over again
Voices blow in the wind
Telling me foes is coming for revenge
Giving me choices, there that voice goes again
No applause, no air time
No need for the floss or "I don't care" rhyme
No studio session needed to air mines
Here lies a dude who did it
I'm a fool at the pulpit
My jewelry dripping
My uzi slipping
I interrupt his eulogy
Excuse me y'all--sipping
Something to soothe me
Talk about my dude, I miss him
Father's a pimp, his mom a Christian
Laying there shivering, what's his religion?
The choir's a liar, songs they singing are repulsive
Preacher man tell it how it was, it went

[Hook]
Rough around the edges
And the edges stick way out
