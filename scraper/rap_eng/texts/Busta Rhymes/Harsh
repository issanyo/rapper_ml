[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
You know
One day I got a call from the Ghost who told me I had to get on this conference call
To discuss a little business with him and the homey Rozay
Know the situation transpired where a nigga had to get dealt with a little harshly
Yeah

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Root for the villain and shoot with no feelin'
Like Audio Two yeah the crew is "Top Billin"
Blowin' the dutch in the coupe with no ceilin'
Invisible bully like the Gooch when I'm illin'
Cash too green, it's taped to the toilet
Like I'm Michael Corleone in the bathroom scene
Young black Vito, chopped and wrapped kilos
Clap torpedoes, stack, Doritos
We in the Mexico sippin' the Mojito
Discussin' perico, green weed and diesel
AK muzzle air holes you can see through
Ridin' the bulletproof five, yeah, I'm lethal

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH)
Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH)
And like a Rothschild with money that's why I'm (HARSH)
How we dealin' with 'em? (HARSH) How we dealin' with 'em? (HARSH)
How we handlin' em? (HARSH) How we manglin' 'em? (HARSH)
Stop bitchin', you the one who done caused me to act (HARSH)
And if I'm itchin' and you front, it's my duty to act...

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
(It's that L.O.X shit right here)
Style is infectious, actress in a Lexus
Sunroof open hasish for breakfast
Beef never settled, I'm Lyor to the ghetto
Russell with the hustle, Rick Rubin with the metal
When I lick a shot I'm aimin' at ya top floor
Blocks like stock everybody bought more
Birds fell out the sky, rats could drop dead
Flyin through Bed-Stuy, white drop head
Sticky green twist, guillotine click
Dapper Dan three piece suit for the trip
Link with Dominicanos, straight to Sofrito
Three point range hit free throws with kilos

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH)

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Shine like brightenin sure but I'm the titan
Hard like when Cus D'Amato was trainin Tyson
Gun we react in the car but no license
Life on top of the city could touch lightenin
Cocaine wave, dollar bill slave
Rangler is tough but the inside is suede
Ride with Louch and 'Kiss until I see a grave
One third of a legacy
Pedigree is I can make a don a don cause of integrity
Rap like a phenomenon sleep for a better dream
Nine is for better things smoke for medicine
BIG is the only rapper I don't think that I'm better than

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, I rub stones together and cast a spell quick Like
Like a Zo hittin' voodoo blessings 'fore I move bricks
I beat you like the number eleven, with two sticks
Money from the door and then when I bop with two chicks
It won't stop never stop there he go again
Together watch the coke and have the baking soda blend
Fredricka kinda pure see how we make the fiends flock
And watch the lines for the coke a quickly wrap around the block
They say we bad for business cause the coke price dropped
How we flooded and we bubble white 'til it's white hot
Pot purchases we chop it up to pieces
'Til only the shake is left countin' the profit in Ibiza
Eight million dollar yacht, scotch, a little refer
Diamonds so big they call it obnoxious little creature
Money to cop original paintings of Mona Lisa
High the way I feel a cloud sittin' on my Caesar
