So tired, so sick

No matter what I do

I keep on tryin 2 please ya
But I don't need ya
If you goin be trippin
Everytime I see ya

Verse 1 (jon young):
Sick & tired of all the questions
Its gettin a bit much
Every button that I touch
Sets you offand then I'm fucked

'cause no matter what I do or what I say
I'm always wrong
If I call then I'm callin too much
Or not at all

Either way I'm messin up
I'm fightin a losin battle
The winners been determined
So I'm finna put down my paddle

'cause I'm sick of alwayz playin this game
Its gettin old
Girl you know I ain't cheatin
You jus wanna be in control

But I can't be havin that
'cause I'm a grinder and you know this
You need 2 jus chill
Consider this you're final notice

I got thangz to do
Deal wit it or girl I'm dunzo
If you trip over sum shit again
You goin be solo

My fundz low
So I gotta get back on my grind
No more givin in when you trippin
I'm wastin time

You know I ain't finna do you wrong
That's why I'm sayin chill
Wit me you always know the deal
Girl I always keep it real

Verse 2 (j cash):
Just got in the door
And there you was waiting
But not to greet me
Just to start with your interogating

Where I been?
I told ya, I was with my friend
Oh my god, here we go with this ish again

I ain't gotta prove myself
I been did that
I done got you everything you need
And then that

So I ain't answer my phone
And now you all mad at me
Think I'm cheatin
When you see I got a low battery

Its like you feed on drama
And I don't need that
Always over my shoulda
So Ima leave that

You need to understand
N I don't think I'm wrong
That Once n awhile
I need some myspace like

N Same goes for the fellas
You need to trust yo lady
Jus hold on loosely
Clingin too tight gonna drive her crazy

But I done found a good one
And damn she keep it real
You havin problems, talk about it
Tell em Just Chill
