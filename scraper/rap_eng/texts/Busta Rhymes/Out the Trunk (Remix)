[Intro: Fashawn]
West up nigga

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Say, who got a problem with the volume?
If you tryna sleep, go get a valium
We night owls, young, livin' our life wild
Tomorrow ain't promised, we living for right now
Pop the pussy for a real nigga right now
I ain't tryna politic and bail with you right now
Chicks looking at me like a meal ticket
Mass Appeal keep the wheels spinnin'
Deal with it, Fashawn, complements of the don
Louis Vuitton, Louboutin, fabrics I been on
Never mind that
Get your mind right before I recline that
It's beyond rap and that's the reason I'm on your block right now
Not in a physical, I invaded through sound
Yes I'm internationally known
But CA's the state that I call home
I'm about to turn it up now

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
This one is for the trunk
Wake up the neighborhood when the dump
Rather it's Rob Base or EZ Rock he pump
Like my old Reeboks, if he pop, I pump
Meaning I rock nothing and no one can stop me, none
What I do stop or stump, why not, I'm young
Prolly seen more Versace than Pac and Pun
Word to Migos, I move words by the kilos
I used to moved birds with my amigos
High supply my wealth
No iPhone app, I apply it myself
Your album got shelved, I couldn't keep mines on the shelf
You getting signed by God, wouldn't help
That's the reason I'm on your block right now
Not in a physical, I invaded through sound
Yes I'm internationally known
But Fresno's the city that I call home
I'm about to turn it up now

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now

[Outro: Fashawn]
Wassup, get your weight up
It's Choppo, 2014 to infinity
