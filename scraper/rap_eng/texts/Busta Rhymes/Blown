Let us all bow our heads
I only pray for some of you
'Cause some of you deserve
The exact beating you about to receive
We don't wish bad on no man
I ain't got no malice in my heart
I just want you to appreciate me
See I don't need nobody fake comin' all over my bed
Talkin' 'bout takin' my place that'll get me blown, blown
(Yes)
And yes I got a problem with you tryin to' be me
Well, it's just me tryin' to be me that'll get me blown, blown
(Huh)
And yes, I hate you hatin' on me
(Unless)
You wanna see them lasers homie
All up in your face that'll get you blown, blown
And it's best that you don't come and test
Unless you got the vest on deck
If I feel that respect then a nigga gotta go, go
I work hard just to make the people wanna love me
Make the people wanna hug me make the people wanna see me
Make the people wanna touch me make the children wanna be me
Make the women wanna rush me
Sometimes it'll get a little ugly when I be grindin' to get it
And you try to take it from me and I be strivin' to rep it
Gotta get a little gully 'cause you be tryin' to test
And started fuckin' with my money
Now I'm tired of you walkin' on a nigga and Im
(Eyyyy)
Really tired of you talking bout a nigga when I'm
(Flip)
Only tryin' to be
(Me)
And everything that I can
(Be)
With all the pressure that you're forcin' on a nigga
Then I will do what I gotta do even if I gotta go wrap my finga
On a trigga and pull it, trust me, prolly gotta bust me
And know that I'm gonna defend a fool to the fullest
See I don't need nobody fake comin' all over my bed
Talkin' 'bout takin' my place that'll get me blown, blown
(Yes)
And yes I got a problem with you tryin to' be me
Well, it's just me tryin' to be me that'll get me blown, blown
(Huh)
And yes, I hate you hatin' on me
(Unless)
You wanna see them lasers homie
All up in your face that'll get you blown, blown
And it's best that you don't come and test
Unless you got the vest on deck
If I feel that respect then a nigga gotta go, go
I live and breathe what I do
Trust me you don't wanna go to far
(Ha ha)
Husky 'cause I put a little size on now
I don't wanna have to choke you par?
So please don't make me handle people
That are look at you a little crazy
Hope you are just a little smarter than a rash homie
Finish with ya you gon' wish that you was close to God
'Cause I put all of my feeling and I put all of my passion
And then look up to the ceiling
'Cause you know a nigga had to get another
Well, now eva eva make you think that you could
Ever come through and try to take what's mine
'Cause I'm willing to just to give my everything
And make the sacrifice and whatever
I'm made of always bringin' to the heaven, twice
'Cause I like repeating when I win
And it's only right nigga respect my grind
See I don't need nobody fake comin' all over my bed
Talkin' 'bout takin' my place that'll get me blown, blown
(Yes)
And yes I got a problem with you tryin to' be me
Well, it's just me tryin' to be me that'll get me blown, blown
(Huh)
And yes, I hate you hatin' on me
(Unless)
You wanna see them lasers homie
All up in your face that'll get you blown, blown
And it's best that you don't come and test
Unless you got the vest on deck
If I feel that respect then a nigga gotta go, go
You don't wanna cross that line homie you don't wanna do
That and I pop it and I prolly make ya really wonder who
Dat and I cock it you don't want me poppin' through your
Little doo rag and I drop you once I really got you leave a nigga
(Blue black)
Then I come in and I hit 'em and I make a nigga wanna sit
And think about just a little, make a nigga really wish
You're in a better situation with somebody
He'll be talking 'bout another nigga wig
(Flew back)
Now, let me give what I give to the people
While I walk and I cross under the bridge, so simple
See the moral of the story of the song is dude you will let me live
While I beat that pavement and stay up in the street
And I meet that greatness and blazin' with the heat
(Look)
And stand so firm on the ground that I walk on
Fake nigga earn your keep
See I don't need nobody fake comin' all over my bed
Talkin' 'bout takin' my place that'll get me blown, blown
(Yes)
And yes I got a problem with you tryin to' be me
Well, it's just me tryin' to be me that'll get me blown, blown
(Huh)
And yes, I hate you hatin' on me
(Unless)
You wanna see them lasers homie
All up in your face that'll get you blown, blown
And it's best that you don't come and test
Unless you got the vest on deck
If I feel that respect then a nigga gotta go, go
