Hey, now who goes there?
Busta Rhymes and Uncle Kracker ya'll
Check it, yeah

The freaks come out, the freaks come out
The freaks come out, the freaks come out
The freaks come out, the freaks come out
The freaks come out, the freaks come out

Broken glass everywhere
People freak the hallways and freak the stairs
Ain't a care in the place, no style or grace
Keep your brights on baby and hide your face (c'mon)
Slide the ace and erase your mind
If you came to freak, then I've got some time
Fall behind and I'll do the same
And get it on baby like my man Mills Lane
No shame, feel no pain
The night might fall, but we're in the same lane
Rain or shine we could all be free
And you can rock this, till you can't see
So watch me, and I'll watch you
You know the party don't stop till I say it's through
Check to any time or town
And you can find your Uncle when the sun goes down

The freaks come out at night (everybody)
The freaks come out at night (c'mon now)
The freaks come out at night (everybody)
The freaks come out at night (c'mon now)
The freaks come out at night (c'mon now)
The freaks come out at night (everybody)
The freaks come out at night (c'mon now)
The freaks come out at night (everybody)

Hey, yo
If you're hangin' out late I hope you got caught
Cause it ain't till 12 when the party really start BOOM
It's frightening the way we climbin' up the charts
So make way, cause you know we comin' to tear the place apart
Winin' and dinin' all over, spooking all the crackers
Let's keep thing crackin' and keep the people wowin'
I'm sayin' the door about to shut, you better start runnin' in
Before they close the spot and all the freaks start comin' in
Everybody up in the streets start to funnel in
And let all my people that use to go down to the tunnel in
See when we come through and step on the scene
I razzle and dazzle the people with my mystery machine
Freaks come in all shapes, sizes and colors
They can come from any direction even come straight out the gutter
I'm sayin' if you wanna live a quiet life
You need to stay up in your house and don't come out at night cause

The freaks come out at night (everybody)
The freaks come out at night (c'mon now)
The freaks come out at night (everybody)
The freaks come out at night (c'mon now)
The freaks come out at night (c'mon now)
The freaks come out at night (everybody)

The freaks come out at night (everybody)

The freaks come out, the freaks come out
The freaks come out, the freaks come out
The freaks come out, the freaks come out
The freaks come out, the freaks come out

Freak it to the left, and freak to the right
In the middle, just a little, if it feels alright
All night till the break of day
You can come for a while, but you can't stay
It's no place for the weak at heart
What's Busta say?
It don't start till dark (yeah)
Up in the parks, the clubs, the halls
Turn the cell phones off, we ain't takin' no calls
And don't fall cause the nights are young
Ain't nobody gonna stop till we see some sun
Hit me one, hit me two, three times
It's your Uncle Kracker and Busta Rhymes
