[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

[Hook]
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 1]
Oh, my Lord! Lower the casket down (Down!)
Sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow! (Pow!)
Frown while I shit on your crown, skip town (Town!)
Ground zero, Shapiro the king cash cow (Cow!)
Do I make 'em say "Wow!"? Strip! (Ow!)
Bow! I sit with the pound, Click, (Blow!) Blow!
Click, click, (Blow! Click, Blow!)
Stop traffic, dropping them classics, flip now!
Bitches, I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start, when I growl
(Rawr, rawr, rawr!)
Let me come and mop up the knock offs
When I pop off and never stop, 'cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (Pause!)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lock jaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough—nigga, we drop more

[Hook: Busta Rhymes + Sample]
Yo
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on-)
("Yo, chill, man—chill!")
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 2]
Here we go again!
Watch how the gasket blow, or settle for land mine
Blast from the door, Smash up ya straight with a massive intro
Flammable fluid in ya yak sip slow, Let me line up the fiend 'n' pitch mo' dro'
I’m sick and I’m thorough bitch, so?
Know when I switch my focus tip toe, Black, see I make the MAC skip so (Brrrrlat!)
Doin' it till ya get low, when they sick to they stomach, need Pepto-Bismol
We outta here; Vladimir Klitschko
Beatin' up the street when I'm lettin' this bitch go
And eat a nigga food like we hungry 'n' piss poor
We 'bout to fuck shit up while you lettin' this itch grow
We reppin’ every hood from the town we start bombin' it (honor it!)[?]
Just in case you ain't know; it’s The Conglomerate!
