[Kardinal Offishall]
Ol' Time Killin' I'm feelin', I'm spillin'
I'm pulling out heat on industry niggas earning a million
With bullshit like Gilligan's
Somebody go check Will and them
And ask Uncle Phil to rep me while my shots get rid of dem
Dis X y'all I'm feel it all up in yo mega-lens
Somebody go tell Missy I'm a hundred minute mission (Listen!)
Hunched over the side I'm a lyrical homicide
Ride di gyal feel a bone if I a pon tity pride (HEY!)
Slew dem, Boo dem al dem fassy nah crew dem
Yo Kardinal and Busta come to crush the liccle fool dem (Who Dem?!)
The Circle Click and The Flipmode Squad reppin' da' T-Dot and B.K. back to
Y'all (HEY!)

[Busta Rhymes]
Now unna fi know seh unna fi stop the mumbo jumbo
Before mi run and go call Columbo
Fi lick out unna bumba-hole
Nuff shot a fire, see how shit is very simple
To leave you with holes and dimples
Inside of your shit and cripple a nigga (DAMN SON!)
Yuh betta roll out
I'll dismantle ya whole mout fi talking what you nuh know bout
Hacksaw Jim Duggan some of these niggas is frontin'
Nuff' of these niggas is nothin'
Always huffin' and puffin'
I'll soon come and give you a cuffin' (AH-OOH!)
Frontin' like you tough, and soft as a blueberry muffin
(EASY RUDE BWOY!)(FOOAH!)
Because of circumstance I might have to go hurt ya man
It's such a shame the way we fuck up the party and done di dance

Chorus: [Jully Black & BlackKat]
It's a Ol' Time, Ol' Time Killin'

[Kardinal Offishall]
Bun ya calm give tanks and praise
Put on ya' vest, protect ya' chest
From dem hollow points stray
We runnin' in da' streets
And we wildin' on the mics (SAY WHAT!)
The dress code is beats and white Nike's
Nuff niggas shinin' but I'm beggin' you to look again
The teams are so sold like Jordan playing for Washington
Style is like Allen I. on the all-star team (it's yoo much for you!)
Make you wanna wake out ya' dream and wipe the dribble off your sweatshirt
Corny niggas get hurt flirtin' with death
Every time the mic sees my breath
This ain't a killin', it's a favor that we doin'
I'm taking em' out of misery fore' da' crowd start booing em'

[Busta Rhymes]
Screwing and pursuin'
Splitting em' in 2 and em'
Niggas I have to remember fore' I have to get all of my crew and em'
Wild street niggas from way back ah while I keep it hot
Flexing with Bill Golayoot from B.K. to da' T-Dot

Chorus: [Jully Black & BlackKat]
It's a Ol' Time, Ol' Time Killin'
We a deal with, run and get your money clip (BLOOK!)

[Kardinal Offishall]
Ah ha!

And make these weak cats pop the diamonds out they pinky ring
And sell it off when I go off
When the drummer start drummin' smokin' rocks up in the corner talkin' bout'
(Yo Bust Coming!)

[Busta Rhymes]
It'll be last one of you amateurs that will mash up any challengers
Fuck yuh bus stop, caw mi nah pick up any passengers
Yo pure dutty nigga ting a gwaan
Bus-A-Bus and Kardinal yeah we fill up a arsenal like carnival, yo
While we chillin' and fulfillin' niggas with listenin' pleasure
Where's my drink yo let's salute the Ol' Time Killin'
You actin' bitchy man, my trigger finger itchy man
We don't engage in any social activity with chi-chi man
2 body bag and a cute casket
Could put you and a whole a ya' fruit friend in 1 fruit basket (Chyo!)
And when the dance done you know we complete
You better bounce before we cock and put a shot inna ya bloodcleet

Chorus: [Jully Black & BlackKat]
