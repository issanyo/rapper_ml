[Intro: Popcaan, (Busta Rhymes)]
She have her man but
Popcaan a the only man she want
The only man she want, yeah (Remix)
She no care if she a him fight
Or if him drive me car a the stop light
Me a the only man she want
(Mek mi talk to dem now)
The only man she want yeah

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Yuh nuh hear how the gal a yell out (Busta)
Yuh nuh hear how she a deaf him
(Him a cry now) From the way how she a lef him
Your shorty want me and you know it
And when I'm left alone with her, sir
And I know it hurt every time she get up on it
Some think it's inappropriate, baby I must propose it
Let us fuck the juices get the spilling like a water faucet
In the truck 'til it sweat will accumulate and drip up off it
Laying back and gently let you kiss up on it
I'm loving everything you do, and I must commend 'em
Me ah the only man she want is wah she tell her friend dem
(Ha Ha Ha!) Now let me hot you up until your body melt
And how you save it for me cau yuh nuh want nobody else

[Verse: Popcaan]
Her man say she very special
Yeah, very special
The gal a try I me nah lie
War upon the front line, nah lie
He may buy her the world and the star
Cha, the house and the car
Still she she waan gi me di thing
Inna the restroom a di bar, ey
She willing fi wine pon the pole
Willing fi gi me any weh pon the toll
All when him a search her phone
A Popcaan a every ring tone
Him cuss her and call her whore
Same friend said the relationship poor
As him talk and turn him back
She a link up over Portmore

[Chorus]
Him tell her fi stop say him a go chop
Say him a go shoot, say him a go shot
Popcaan a the only man she want
The only man she want yeah
Him tell her she cheap, say him a go cheat
Say she a go weep say him a go beat
But me a the only man she want
The only man she want yeah

[Verse 3: Popcaan]
Say she love how the plat up hair yute
Cut off foot jeans me no haffi wear suit
Her man is wealthy me no haffi use loot
Tell her enough times she tell me we no fi use (shhhh)
The gal a fight fi me like American troops
She have me real bad chargie, she ah me dupes
Don't care if he lef her with cut up and bruise
A Poppi a the man weh she choose

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Popcaan]

[Chorus]
