Yes! To be or not to be, or can you be what you wanna be?
(THAT IS THE ANSWER)
You see Leaders of the New School have completed a level of life which is being observed as a new revolution of musical longevity in the form of positive vibration through mind power of unexisting energy, so I ask..

(WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?)

[Cut Monitor Milo]
Today's fantasy is like a stage of tomorrow
And when the Leaders walk, the others will follow
Coz we make moves like that of a champion
Now you know and understand.. (WE'RE STRONG LIKE SAMPSON)
And one day soon, I will have a mansion
With a studio room for brothers to camp in
And musical vibe is all you need my dear
Now ask yourself the question
(WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?)

[Busta Rhymes]
Be too annoyed for the screamin'
But are you really aware or are you dreamin'?
They say recess in terms of progress
If you dope in your days I think it'd be a mess
(WHY'D YA SAY THAT BUSTA, WHY'D YA SAY THAT)
Because I feel that it is time we should react
That is the question - (WHAT IS THAT?) Where do we go from here?
Is it something we should fear or just go anywhere?
Then maybe you'll be lost over nonsense
(HA HOO HA) No need to get tense
B to the U to the S to the T-E-R
Busta Rhymes coming startin' the question's how far
Will I go to meet my destiny?
Will it be activated or will it be a memory
Time to prepare put your motive in gear
??? tell me why coz the future is near
Uh-huh uh-huh, check it out yo, uh-huh here we go now

[Dinco D]
Goodie-two-shoes no not I'm a (MANIAC)
Radiation radio, radical format
A future in the past, can you understand it?
Dialect ??? mental ???
??? (I)
Just on the quest to find (MY)
True identity to identify where
Everybody goes (WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?)

[Charlie Brown]
Last but not least, ??? from the east
??? so I don't drive a, AH, you know
Graduation, elevation, of (BROWN), Charlie that is, boom get down
Smith Street, Turtle Hook and Uniondale High by former of the loner ???
To have fun and stun, while I record
When it rains, AH, (IT POURS)
LONS, LONS, ??? from 91 to 92 to 94, you want more
(STRONG ISLAND'S FINEST)
AH, you dare, ask me what, God? Uh! (WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE)

[ALL]
Finally got ourselves together
Now we know, just who we are
Finally got ourselves together
Now we know, just who we are
Finally got ourselves together
Now we know, just who we are
