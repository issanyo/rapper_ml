[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes & Ol Dirty Bastard]
[BR] Busta Rhymes up in the place with the ODB

[BR] —You rhyme after me
The ODB was nominated for a Grammy
[ODB] Congratulations Bust with your solo LP
[BR] Putting scratches in my lyrics like my name was Kid Capri
Blow up the spot, regardless of your nationality
[ODB] And I'm the Dirty Dawg can't fuck with me
[BR] Took Mariah on a fantasy
[ODB] I had a wet dream that I was bonin Jody Wately
Doin wild shit-a-nuh, ain't allowed to see
[BR] But we about to blow up the spot momentarily
Woo-Hah!! Ran stupid all throughout the country
[ODB] And for youse to kill me? That wasn't meants to be
[BR] I know it feel good, motherfuckers want the recipe
[ODB] And whose the vigilante, in the place to be

[Hook]

[Interlude: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Dibby dabby dibbi dah, then I pass a lot
Let me get more hot, represent the spot
A mad Squad when it comes to the art of rapping
I gotta keep your hands clapping
When you look at me, the type of guy I be
I'm a dirty dancer, making girlies panties move
Let them fly so I can blast up the twat
Girlies watch sayin "God, stop getting me hot!"

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes & Ol Dirty Bastard]
[BR] Niggas talk shit, yo kill the yapping
Word is bond baby, tell me how you look so smashing
Now I got your head hurt, you need an aspirin
Bashin your head in the wall, time for some action
If you want a small piece well here's a fraction
Of shit that will bust your head quick, peep the transaction
Of how we keep motherfuckers constantly crashing
They flyest whips, think no shifts, now whose the champion?
I bring the wicked flow, like the latest fashion
Satisfaction baby keep your camera flashing
[ODB] I was busting the sperm cells mixed with Old Gold
Fungus mold, 'fore-you-should-list...slum gold
Played for a wild Irish rose
Fat ass nigga, slim bitch with no clothes
In the backseat of a 'back sixty-nine Oldsmoz
Are your soles and toes in the windows? Oh my hoes!
Hey believe me when I say so
You're in need ofarealnig-c-ca-ca-ca-crambole

[Hook]
