[Intro]
Oh! x10
Yo! (yo!) x4

[Hook]
I wanna see you do that thing
Before you all pass out (pass out)
Hands up (hands up)
Spazz out (spazz out)
Nobody could do it the way we get it down, nah (ah, hah)
We make ‘em blow they cash out (cash out)
Don’t you love it when we come and do it again?
Pour liquor till it spill out the glass (non-stop)
Either way we got it on snag (the way we got it on)
We don’t stop until we bounce like
(Busta Rhymes vocalizing)

[Verse 1]
Can't stop 'til we knock off your block
Mami watch the flyest nigga winning purposely, I sloppily mop
Celebrate this bread, we be getting Monopoly guap
Several homes in beautiful cities, I property hop
Most you niggas need to probably stop
Create a lane 'cause when I come through, most you dudes'll probably flop
When I spit chances'll be shot cuz I'll probably pop
Shots legal til the nozzles is hot, and blow the spot
Now you know we got it for 'em (I give 'em the heat)
And we gotta put it on 'em (defeat in the street, let's go)
That guitar shit I’m lost in the zone
Might as well give me the crown bitch, I’m bringing it home
Tight as hell, you hear the sound bitch, I’m standin’ alone
See I be like a katana 'til they bandage your bones
Why you niggas quick to block and love the shit that we bring?
Bust bottles and salute what’s legendary

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m comin’ and killin’ and causin’ you niggas to lose it
While I'm asking for challenges, I line 'em I’m smacking 'em stupid
Assault and battery, the booth, boy, I love to abuse it
You see the high bean when I’m comin’ motherfucker, move it
And so I say
You know we got that shit
We give it to him til we makin’ a nigga say “We got it, bitch”
(And uh) we don’t stop, (and uh) we don’t quit
(And uh) you see most flip because we drop the most hits
I know for most, it's hard to just stomach
God of the spit in the flesh, and what he do to become it
I step in the building, demolish shit, you know how I cut it
The way I mash on err'thing, you know how I run it
My hundred-fifty thousand dollar features swallow your budget (what!)
And fuck the hood up boy, and see how they love it
Why you niggas quick to block and love the shit that we bring?
Bust bottles and salute what’s legendary

[Hook]
