[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Hah... Rah Digga...

[Verse 1: Spliff Star]
Yo, Yo, Yo! It's my time to shine and I'm a shine bright
Sodomize the mic Get the crowd hype Make 'em want to fight
You see the rhymes I construct The flows I conduct
It fucked up the party like somebody got bucked Nigga word!
I lays it down flat like a door mat
Get head in every state wherever I toured at
Spliff ah spliff
Duh-ty nigga what the undisputed
Counting traps Taking trip out the cacilac
Smokin' quan-quan doggie style chicks in the Montreaon
Cracking many bar Fuck it, nigga grab an Averon
Me Spliff, be the fucking tailor of my fashion
Fuck what niggas think, watch a nigga turn platinum

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Ya'll niggas wanna get down

[Verse 2: Rah Digga]
Digga Digga, first name Rashia
Sweetest person, had no idea
Just like that, honey flipped three times
With nickles and dime staking rhymes by the eon
Situation around the way with my women
Looking spiffy wit the Fendi type linen
Totin' herbals We got papers like staples
Marla Marples Didn't think I could take you
Confrontation, now niggas wanna run up
Trying to flex muscle on a bitch tring to come up
Rhymes harder than concrete statues in Eygpt
Roll they ass out like they parapilegic
Boy! I got shit for the brain
You faker than them new heads calling me by my nickname
I shatter an ego quick I be that chick
The wrong niggas gonna be round to see that shit

[Chorus]
Ya'll niggas wanna get down
Ya niggas wanna battle
Eh, what ya'll wannna do
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya'll niggas wanna get down
Ya niggas wanna battle
Just what ya'll wannna do
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya'll niggas wanna get down
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya niggas wanna battle
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Eh what Ya'll wannna do
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha

[Verse 3: Baby Sham]
Get the royal blue Nav and swing my way
On some real party shit if you hold your weight
I can hold mine
You wanna battle blow some lines
Rocks gleam on the top of my wrist
You want this
Be the same dude that hop on the pubics quick
You can't hold this
You jealous cause ya shorty want this
Dig her back out in front of my crib
Her man staked out
On the rare the cloud sh...shut your mouth
What you chap 'bout, the same shit
Been on for chris The style got you twist up
Walk wit face ice grilled up
Some cat pulled up in a black surburb
Let me move first so I can park my shit on the curb
Ya moves slow get bashed in from Q.B. to Aspen
I'm short for reason
You spoke and should have passed that
Don't ask my age cause the world made me like that
Blast a hole in ya face soon as my nine cock back

[Chorus]
Ya'll niggas wanna get down
Ya niggas wanna battle
Eh, what ya'll wannna do
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya'll niggas wanna get down
Ya niggas wanna battle
Just what ya'll wannna do
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya'll niggas wanna get down
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya niggas wanna battle
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Eh what Ya'll wannna do
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha
