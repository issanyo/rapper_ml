Levels of imagination
The levels of imagination

[Verse 1: Dinco D]
Yo yo yo, check the hype, beat go drum
The D to the O is a son of a gun
Go bang for the song that I sing
Bang for the bell just ring
So my personality is on a uneven flow
With a ha ha ha and a ha hee ho
Well of course the source of our force is a spectrum
(Colors!) It makes you wanna chase them
But today a new school will begin of candy
(Candy!) Mind candy
Fine and dandy I want big bucks no whammys

(Come on!)

[Cool Whip]
Boom, bam, alakazam
Tip to tip of the lip I can
Bust a dope rhyme and on time and
Never stop climbing up (up!)
And up I go, they laid the tracks
LONS and the Cracker Jacks
Can't forget the Now and Later
I got words in mind that I have to cater
To the beat (the beat!) the beat it's a treat
Take a seat, relax your feet
And nibble a snack like a bunion
Keep away from the onion
A notice for whether short or tall
That's all (that's all!) adios, y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Brittle]
Not a fiddle faddle, a Cracker Jack's an aggle
Mangerie but in French bon apetit
Can I get some sugar in my tea?
I like Swiss Miss mixed with a bit of honey
I like lunches and breakfast brunches
Captain Crunches it tastes so scrumptious
Packing my cheeks but I'm not cheap
Though quite discreet go take a peep at a peep show
Not a ninja turtle but I can jump a hurdle
In a second unless I'm dressed to impress
In a vest, cause still I'm far from a chump
And for my rap style I give it two snaps up
Bringing 'em up sounds, this for Elektra
Can I get a little rhyme from the Brittle
Edible treats feed your brain with creations
The levels of imagination

[Tropical]
Renegade rebels of a new school breed
Feed me the vibes that's the food I need
It's gotta have flavor I can savour
Something I can take it make the house quake
Cause the T-R-O-P-I-C-A-L, that's my name (Tropical!)
Entice I'm nice, pour the rhymes on ice
So taste the tropics, top it with the sugar and spice
As I go with the slow and flash with the flow
I got the stepbrother they call Jeranimo
Shawow, right now, love later
The Leaders are the 99 ??? creator
Whip you, trip you, bag you, nag you
Skip on the real tip we're about to rag you
Busta Rhymes, Dinco D, and of course Charlie B
And looks like they show that we got personality

(Personality! Personality! Personality!)

[Busta Rhymes]
You got a stain or a ring around the collar
Because an all over many is much harder
Busta Rhymes I'm the lyrical monster
Styles of today and tomorrow
You feel the vibe around the rhythm going tweedle-eedle-ee
Counteracts with the track making something good to eat
Leaders Leaders of the New School making it funky
As you're hungry here to take up your musical munchie
As willing to take I'm generous
Busta Rhymes I am young and rebellious
Got the Cracker Jacks, Leaders of the New School, and the Now Or Laters
Yes to create a vibe that is really dominating
As we keep elevating, and traveling through the...

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Jeranimo & Boogie Knight)
Do you wink or do you blink?
Did you thought or do you think?
We're taller than Gremlins, the Rumpletilskinz
Jeranimo ready and willing, Boogie Knight
Tonight's your night and jump and thump punk
Now it's your mic, socializing
Analyzing, yeah y'all, it's surprising
Jealous people, why bother
The Rumpletilskinz come much harder
Some think it's dope and some say never in life
I have a way, you should aim with a spotlight
The brothers Jeranimo and Boogie Knight

[Charlie Brown]
Ahhhh.....
I got a high pitch and a low pitch
Personality is ill and it makes me switch, yo
Many don't like me, they're blind, they can't see
The LONS (New School Society!)
Cut Monitor Milo, Powercat, Backspin
Vietnam, SD50 again
To city Uniondale, Strong Island
Personality styling
Elektra collects the buckets of ducats, ah, I love it

[Hook]
Come on!

Jeranimo is down with us
Dinco is down with us, check it out
Boogie Knight is down with us
