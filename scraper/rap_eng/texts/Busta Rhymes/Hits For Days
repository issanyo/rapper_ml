[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
On your marks
Get set ready go
Let's get 'em upper deck
Let is spark
I'm sicker with flows
To set another trend
You niggas front
Like shit ain't for real
Why would you pretend
It's Busta Busta
Back for the kill
Tell a fuckin' friend
Before the bomb drop if you good
See when I (beat it up)
With nonstop coke for the hood
Go 'head and (heat it up)
I'ma leave it up to the streets
To determine how i beat it up
'til a nigga head get bus' in the club
I'm bout to (heat 'em up)

[Chorus: J.Holiday]
It's been a while since I've
Seen the light of day (Okay)
Cause I, been hustlin'
Jus' Cookin' in the kitchen
Comin' up with hits for days
And those involved
Are blastin' all
The rest'a y'all
No cruise control
(And) I know you wanna hate
You can't hate, [?]
You need to
Move over
Cause I'm colder
But more important
I'm a soldier
(Ha, Yeah) The rockin don't stop cause
We make hits for days

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes]
Ay, yo yo
No just in case you actin' like you don't know
Must I remind you niggas that
(We make hits for days)
It's only in your best interest if you
(Spread love, dah dahhh-dah)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
We make niggas wanna act up
Smash ya wig and wanna backflip
Ain't nothin changed I'm still the
Goliath of this rap shit
Snatch a couple of ones
My money [?]
Then I double my funds
And [?]
Oh Oh Oh
My My My (SHIT)
My My My
My niggas black and reactin'
Like they back in the sty
It's really plain and simple
So please explain to me why
Y'all know already
Only them stupid niggas'll try
To test the kid who spit it hard
Like the legend of [?]
Back on my grind like I'm sittin'
Baggin' them tin pies
Glass table, couple razors
And baking soda supplies
While sippin' 'ngac
Hits from the 'L' will
Bloody your eyes
This new concoction I cook
Will flood exceeding the size
Of every hood, borough, and city
Meet your demise
And if you gotta question the kid
Then utilize
Your better sense of judgement
Who do it better?  Surprise, Surprise!
("J") Get 'Em

[Chorus: J.Holiday]
It's been a while since I've
Seen the light of day (Okay)
Cause I, been hustlin'
Jus' Cookin' in the kitchen
Comin' up with hits for days
And those involved
Are blastin' all
The rest'a y'all
No cruise control
(And) I know you wanna hate
You can't hate, [?]
You need to
Move over
Cause I'm colder
But more important
I'm a soldier
(Ha, Yeah) The rockin don't stop cause
We make hits for days

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes]
Ay, yo yo
No just in case you actin' like you don't know
Must I remind you niggas that
(We make hits for days)
It's only in your best interest if you
(Spread love, dah dahhh-dah)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
In every hood
We carry the goods
I'm ready to go
Let's proceed with the stuntin'
In case you ain't know then LET...
...me show you somethin'
Why niggas front?
They know who in charge
Of this whole production (YO!)
Take [?]
[?] legal liquor consumption
And keep it nutty
For every hood
Follow instructions
And rush the door
And [?] the entry
Wild'n the function
Just throw a couple bottles around
And fuel a combustion, probably
Shit's about to explode
Catch a concussion
The club('s at) capacity
And now everybody is stuck in
With bitches shakin' they ass
And dancin' just like they fuckin'
See my money long
I spend them benefits from tax deductions
A couple cribs
And a little company doin' construction
(Ha, It's nothin')
DJ play 'til equipment'll malfunction
And the lights is on
And Shots have been fired
That's why they duckin'
Mother fuckin' better run
If you hear them niggas is bustin'
I know it's been a while
So you niggas ain't
Expect to see this comin'
I'm back to get 'em!

[Chorus: J.Holiday]
It's been a while since I've
Seen the light of day (Okay)
Cause I, been hustlin'
Jus' Cookin' in the kitchen
Comin' up with hits for days
And those involved
Are blastin' all
The rest'a y'all
No cruise control
(And) I know you wanna hate
You can't hate, [?]
You need to
Move over
Cause I'm colder
But more important
I'm a soldier
(Ha, Yeah) The rockin don't stop cause
We make hits for days

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes]
Ay, yo yo
No just in case you actin' like you don't know
Must I remind you niggas that
(We make hits for days)
It's only in your best interest if you
(Spread love, dah dahhh-dah)
