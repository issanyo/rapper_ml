[Verse 1]
Yo, all my niggas in the place
What now
Talk to my bitches
All up in the place
See my niggas
They be laying all up in the cut now
Anyhow
I'ma doing my thing
And blow the spot baby
Maybe bust a little nut now
Funny how the older bitches get familiar
And try to give a nigga just a little butt now
Sing along
(Smoke now, nigga get high)
And get all in this money nigga
(Before we die)
Bitches let me know that you up in the spot
(Whoop whoop wooo)
All of my niggas just shout it at me (Yeah yo)
Even though it's kind of ill
Nigga follow the flow
Nigga wanna know where we shine
Try'na ball and glow
Watch for the sound round
When I swallow the dough
I'mma do it to ya
Like I never did it before
Now let me give it to you
(Flipmode Squad baby)
Now what the fuck y'all niggas wanna know about the
(God baby)
Ha, then I jump right out of the whip
And I park it
My pinky gleam
Like a motha fuckin' third of the Antarctic
Everybody get wild in the spot
All my niggas just pile in the spot
It's such a shame
Somebody might just lose they child in the sky

[Chorus]
C'mon all my niggas, cmon (What)

Hit you with the brand new
When I'm bumping
You don't need to ask who
Nigga please (C'mon now)
Where the trees (C'mon now)
Shit, when I'm bouncing
And hit you with the flow
Then I make you just act a fool
One two (One two)
Wild like another mad nigga
To be ready to back it too
Here we go (Here we go)
A lot of mothafuckas
They ain't even got a clue
C'mon now
Let me school y'all niggas permanently
Like a mothafuckin' tattoo
C'mon now
Hey (Hey)
Hey (Hey)
You know you shouldn't (Try it)

Before we do shit to (Start up a riot)
Everytime we come through
All the bitches shout (Whoop whoop woo)
All of my niggas shine if you ready (Yeah yeah)
Let me blow for a few
Nigga c'mon
Bounce in the street
With the heat stashed under the seat
In a Range that's blue nigga (C'mon)
Cats like you be searching the crib
All the weakling niggas in your crew nigga (C'mon)
Everytime a nigga come step in the spot
Y'all niggas know we come to blow the venue nigga (C'mon)
But wait
Guess what (Guess what)
Flipmode to the rescue nigga (C'mon)
Y'all (Y'all)

When we put it down
Niggas really wanna blow this shit (Shit)
It's (It's)
Like I got a grenade in my hand
And you know I wanna throw this shit (Yo)
Everybody get stuck in the spot
You don't really give a fuck in the spot
Better watch your whip
Because they might just tow your truck from the spot

[Chorus]
C'mon all my niggas, c'mon (What)
My niggas that be reppin' with me (What)
My niggas that be holding me down (Ha hooo)
And high steppin' with me (What)
C'mon all my bitches, c'mon (What)
My bitches that be reppin' with me (What)
My bitches that be holding me down (Whoop whoop woo)
And high steppin' with me
