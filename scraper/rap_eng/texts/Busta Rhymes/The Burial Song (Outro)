The burial song

[Verse]
Though some of us have been poisoned
Many of us have been blessed
And through the worst shit
That we all as people go through
Every blessing that we are blessed to have
Are blessings that provide us with what makes us capable of withstanding
And makes us more powerful when we go through the worst shit
Everything and every motherfucker gets dealt with accordingly
Mark my words
See I remember on The Coming album
You know when there was only five years left
It was once said that there was no time
To take time for granted
Well we are now face to face with that very given time
There's only one year left motherfuckers
1999
The dawn of the new millennium
I understand though
Sometimes it takes time
And hands-on extreme hardship experience
To realize how much better it is to prepare for the worst
By all means
It will always be better to be safe than to be sorry
So as we finally approach the year 2000
Behold what it might have in store for us people
There have been many indications of changes
That will occur, that has already occurred
That were not and will not be set up to our benefit, as people
But in order for us to continue to build
We must destroy
And unfortunately in the process
Many of us will be liable candidates
Of being destroyed
But in the bigger scheme of things we must defend
What we all collectively identify with as the truth
And with what is right
To all my live soldiers
And all my live women
Those who may not survive the turning point
May you forever rest peacefully
As you are delivered back to the essence
So I dedicate this burial song to all of you
To my survival of the most fit for real niggas
And women no doubt
Continue to get what's yours from out this fucker
Before your time run out
And may the force of survival forever rest with y'all
My live motherfuckers
To all my survivalists
See you in the next thousand year period
Allah bless all y'all
Flipmode continue to bounce
Like a satellite in orbit
Seein' all you motherfuckers at every angle
The imperial, the universal, powerful Flipmode squad
Stay tuned
See y'all motherfuckers, January 1st 2000

[Outro]
The burial song

The burial song

The burial song
The burial song
The burial song
