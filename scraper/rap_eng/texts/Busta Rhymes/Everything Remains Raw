[Intro]
Word up, let me just fuck with your mind, please
Aiy! Aiyyo-yo-yo, yo! Let me fuck up your mind
On time, showin, you the, rhythm
As I get wreck and get raw
Yeah I be the man, comin off, that be raw
It's Busta Rhymes givin you much more
So...

[Verse 1]
Yo y'all (y'all) one more time I come
Knucklehead flow that make you act REAL DUMB
Yo (yo), I burn your food like Florence
Run up in your crib like my name was search warrants
Shut your mouth nigga don't you complain
Fix you up, mix you with cut like pro-caines
Ooh!! Insane to your brain
Right on your subconscious, I leave my SHIT stain
I be the mostest with rhyme overdoses
Hot stepping over shit like Ini Kamoze's
Sick lyrics like multiple sclerosis
Focus, while I display flows ferocious
Weak niggas just fall and keep tumbling
Distribute lyrics like I'm hand to hand herb hustling
Hardcore like Quick Draw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before

[Chorus]
I make sure everything remains raw

[Verse 2]
Yo, when I step in the place I leave damages
Nuff bandages on pussy from miscarriages
Yo, watch me bring the newest recipe
Fuck you up quick and condemn you all with leprosy
Let me hit you with flows, that come various
Hahh, send you home and make you lie bout your alias
Ha-ha, niggas can't see my routine
When I round up my Flipmode niggas and get cream
Hey, you! You know what the fuck I mean
Now I'm on the scene, stepping through like Mean Joe Green
Now I'm making you feel the extreme
Till I black you out then turn on my real high beam
Oh shit, now I got your brains fried
Once you inhale smoke from my flow - CARBON MONOXIDE!
Use your imagination, let me take you higher
Rain hail snow earthquakes, Earth Wind & Fire
Yo, hit the dirt, get on the floor
I'm that outlaw nigga living right next door
You should just roll out the red carpet
All movin targets, I got you open like supermarkets
Yo yo, there's only five years left
While niggas is scared to death they breathe they last breath
Days of my Life goes on, word is bond
I make you feel my proton, neutron, and electron
Yo, I be the number one icon
Word to the holy Qu'ran, I rock on and on
On and on, hey, on and on and on
You won't understand when I form Voltron
Hahahaha, everything remains raw

[Chorus]
I make sure everything remains raw

[Outro]
Word is bond, niggas don't really understand shit
Niggas don't motherfuckin know y'all, hahah
Flipmode is the motherfuckin Squad y'all, hahah
I make sure everything remains raw, hahah
Word is bond, niggas don't know the real shit
There's only five years left! Word is bond
Niggas don't know though
There's only five years left! Hahah
Remember that nigga, all you, remember that
There's only five years left! Hahaha
