I wonder when Its going to stop being fun for me [x3]
Five fucken seconds from now
I really need to quit before it all turns to shit [x3]
Too fucken late for that

They say my first CD, was my best one
And the other shit was disappointing

Me likes watching it go down in flames
Not my fault
I blame it on the industry
Rock my hole
Well since you put it that a way
They were right
My shit is wack

Down to defy niggas
And my double wide niggas
My shit is wack

I wonder when I'll really stop being good at this [x3]
Was I ever good at this?
I know its shit but it is something I Won't admit [x3]
Too fucken bad for you

Down to defy niggas
And my double wide niggas
