Let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me tell you a story, yes
About a boy from the Tribe Called Quest
I be that nigga that I think ya'll know
With Mr. Busta Rhymes, a-yo, I'm in the studio

Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know

Close the door, iight, let a nigga rock
'Cause we 'bout to eat real shit, not shit slop
Nigga can't say shit about this hip-hop
'Cause I build dudes lanes while at pit stop
Built they styles and they names, Frankenstein, right
It's a high state game, dudes are playing it
I be questioning a lot of ya'll who made it in
Just move with the joint that we chartering

Make you disappear quick like you're part of wind
Then laugh, ah ha ha, and laugh again
Shorty, move a lil bit, I'm looking at your friend
Let's get in there and shake for the beat, girl
Do a lil eye wink, throw a tongue twirl
Gotta hit lock smashed in, tied down
We on your block, turned hot spots to ghost towns
A-yo, I'm tired of these niggas, bus-a-bus, now
Say it to 'em

This is just for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what, tell 'em now

Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know

Pardon me, now, gimme room again
It's time to raise the level of the boom again
Now who's that? Bus-a-bus-a-bus Rhyme
See, I ain't do that in a long time
Spitting shit, make piece, do more crime
Hot songs, cribs, have a little more shine
Alright, yeah, sh sh, mm, uh, I pity ya'll
The way I bang niggas, and how I shit on ya'll

Spit the slang bigger, make your label quit on ya'll
And do my thang, bitch, from here to Synagogue
We getting a lot of money, me and my friend, Kamal
I take your money too, I ain't afraid of ya'll
With so much class, my shit will kill ya when I don't wanna rap
And still I'ma smash and make the bitches make it clap
As soon as I'm finished with her, homie, I'll give her back
Say it to 'em

This is just for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what, tell 'em now

Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know

When the beat bang and you're up in the club
When you listen and you feel a thud
When you hear my voice, understand the love
When the dj spins it back, it's a friendly rub
But, when I'm behind, I cannot be kind with your waistline
And the way you move
Like a old great beat, I'ma catch a groove
Or like a old hip-hop joint, you nice and smooth, come on, girl

This is just for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what, tell 'em now

Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
Go move
Show me what ya'll know
