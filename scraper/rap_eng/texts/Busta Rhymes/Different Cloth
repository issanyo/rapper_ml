[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Got these niggas sayin': shit ain't even logical
To do the shit I do, now lets celebrate the impossible
Glasses up, I'm respected son
Unbelievable arsenal
Beat the streets with bars til niggas lay in the hospital
In case you didn't know everything about me phenomenal
And the way these niggas talk everything about it is comical
Whats even more comical, is what you read in an article
I broke your face for talkin', you should've been more responsible
You need to learn I ain't trying to stop, basically
Watch them choke when I'm pullin' up in a space ship, see?
When I float you see how we ballin' until we wasted
Mad because I poke your broad and be lettin' her taste it
Please appreciate this art and this Basquiat that I'm painting
Embrace a lot of love, but I love embracing the hatred
You niggas is the fuel for me
Leaving it mutilated
Pardon my delay on all of this greatness you ever waited

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now when I'm lookin' at the game I say shit done changed
These niggas going out they way but I'm just staying the same
You probably thinking that you seen someone like me before
But I'm a G and they don't make em like me anymore

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
The nerve of these niggas
Talkin' shit about me cause I'm on the top I ain't even heard of these niggas
Smokin' kill dressed to murder these niggas
Want beef? Cause I got bread
I guess you where burgers be nigga
They say I'm the event currently
But my niggas in the cut like surgery
And all my breakfasts, lunch, and dinners get served to me
You sayin' I ain't the realest, that's perjury
I'm smokin' out with my niggas up on the top floor of the villa lookin' out for those who be trynna copy us
Oh you ain't bout them dollars huh?
I guess that mean we can't chop it up
PÃ©rignon poppin'
30k for watches
I grinded for what I got my nigga, losings not an option
Just look at all this new shit that I'm rockin'
Don't know whatchu doin', you should stop then

[Hook]
