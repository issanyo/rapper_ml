[Intro: Beenie Man]
The legend has returned! (Yeah I know that!)
It is what it is (That's true) Aight!

[Busta Rhymes]
Hi sire! It's Busta Rhymes the ruler as well!!!
Guess what! Guess what! Beenie!

[Beenie Man] (Busta Rhymes)

[Verse One: Beenie Man] (Busta Rhymes)
I sleep with Queens and chickens (CLUCK CLUCK CLUCK!!!)
Gal ready for the pluckin
(Get dressed) And ready for the clubbin
(Timberland shoes and) Jeans that's denim
(Maybach spinnin) Champagne poppin (Music hittin) Girls dem swingin
(Party all night) Sex till the mornin
(Slam down gal) Like Alonzo Mourning
(But yuh a DJ why yuh start rappin?) I don't know dog it just happened
(Yo yuh see dem two gal yah kissin?!) That's somethin I should've have my dick in

You see her bend that means she's prayin
To who?! Must be the Lord I'm thinkin

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Wine up yuh body gal, shake up yuh body gal
Move up yuh body gal, jiggle yuh jiggle yuh body
Wine up yuh body gal, shake up yuh body gal
Move up yuh body gal, jiggle yuh jiggle yuh body

[Verse Two: Busta Rhymes]

Hotter than a summer when I give you more heat
Murderin the flow and I be murderin the beat
CLACK!!!! Clack CLACK!!!! Clack CLACK!!!!
Makin every shotta waan buss anodda shot

You know we run shit when we step up in the spot
The way we make it sizzle everybody know we hot
Because you see us doin every single thing you not
Gimme all my money then I'm with whatever
Especially when you see two legends come together

Wine up yuh body gal, shake up yuh body gal
Move up yuh body gal, jiggle yuh jiggle yuh body

[Verse Three: Beenie Man]
All dem a hype and a talk and a gwaan
When mi a step inna di lawn it buss like dawn
Car weh mi drive and mi clothes mi have on

Some jiggle up yuh body and how yuh carry on

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Wine up yuh body gal, shake up yuh body gal
Move up yuh body gal, jiggle yuh jiggle yuh body
