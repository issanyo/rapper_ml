Let's see where the people in the world is at
Where you at shorty?
With LL, Busta Rhymes, Check it out...

Two big ballers keep the juice blending
Fuck Black Ceaser, I didn't like the ending
Why?, cos we two jiggy niggas always making
Too many million dollar affilliations
Abbreviation, LL, period
I'm platinum every time, it's serious
Aeiyo, we serious when we experience millions
High, rolling to the max, extra big willying
Uh, huh, with a third of my deposit

Take your current chickens then take your ex-chickens
Shake it down for papers
Hey, now she jump shaking...

Gotta keep on making it high
Gotta keep on making it high (Yes, yes Mr Smith)
Gotta keep on making it high
Gotta keep on making it high

Why you ice-grilling, I'm far from a villian
Two hundred and twenty pounds, you're half shilling
Yo, ice-watery lyrics flow like water spilling
You know the rules of the giz-ame, milk and top billing
Aeiyo, I think your empty-ass cup needs some refilling
Let me bust my milk on your back, watch you start illing
You know she's willing, cos' honey's a Star Trekker
Clothes coming off like jewels in front of Mecca
Aeiyo, cock diesel baby girl, bigger than Chubby Checker
In the process of the jolt she might feel the Black'N'Decker
Reason being, I work my tool right
Handcraft the cake till it's baked just right

Gotta keep on making it high (Uh)
Gotta keep on making it high (Uh) (Yeah, that's right)
Gotta keep on making it high (Uh)
Gotta keep on making it high (Uh) (Just spark my L)

Just lean left, lean right
Lean front, lean back
C'mon, you gotta ride it baby
(You gotta shake it, shake it all night baby)
Just lean left, lean right (right)
Lean front, lean back (lean back)
(C'mon shake it, just shake it)
(C'mon shake it, just break it)
You gotta ride it baby
