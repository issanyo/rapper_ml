[Intro]
Yeah, good god

[Chorus]
(Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la)
Yeah, for all you motherfuckers, across the whole entire galaxy
Busta Rhymes,and the whole entire Flipmode Squad
Back at y'all motherfuckers in 1997
(Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la)
Ha, when disaster strikes, when disaster strikes
Take a look and sit on the sidelines and bear witness, ha

[Verse 1]
On and on, return from the future like a centurion
All my affiliates, .et's stack another mil-li-on
While you learn on how the words go to my motherfuckin' song Watch me puts it on
It keeps you open all day long
(The way we fuck shit up you thinkin' something must be wrong)
Set the high standards for corny niggas to get the gong
Bleach your ass blonde and black your color back to bronze
On happy days, I be the coolest nigga like The Fonz
So spectacular how I touch souls from here to Africa
My Zimbabwe niggas bangin' my joints up in they Acura
Ooh, nigga, you feel the bump from bumper to bumper
Drivin' imported five hundreds in foreign license plate numbers
Ha-ha, laugh at ya, oh, me and my passengers
Flip ass niggas over quick like frying pan spatulas
(Why do you be wastin' your time, being mad at us?)
Every voice should sing and help the music sound miraculous

[Chorus]
(Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la)
Yes, yes, y'all, Flipmode Squad y'all
We reign supreme in 1997
When disaster strikes, you will all feel
(Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la)
When disaster strikes, you will all see
When disaster strikes, you will all bear witness
To the Most High Exalted

[Verse 2]
Yo, I keeps flows so ridiculous
Rhyme flow taste good like a handful of cherry licorice
Practice your rhyme or be the local practitionist
Well, you can try being a doctor or being a local obstetricianist
See, you can be somethin'
Quit tryin to work so fuckin' hard towards nothin
This rhyme shit was never de signed for every swollen muffin
Yo, I'm singin'...
Why y'all niggas think that y'all could really see my Squad?
And if we hit you hard, that's when you feel the power of the God
Do it right, and big up my peeps and A-Alikes
On alike, repel, especially feel when disaster strikes
Extremely delicate like the blowing out of candlelights
The quiet killing surprises niggas whenever they wanna fight
That type of shit that shine, and blind a nigga eyesight, a'ight?
We keepin' it tight, y'all niggas don't want it right?
You will never ever get no wins inside mi casa
We killin' all impostors like we killin' cucarachas
Bounce to award ceremonies like we winnin' Oscars
Rhymin' Rastasg eating enough exotic pasta, ha, yo
(We keep it movin' for all of y'all)
Freak y'all niggas out while I'm makin' y'all niggas fall
Disaster will hit ya quick anytime you wanna brawl
Perm press a nigga back, peel them off the wall
So tell me, why do you be wastin' your time, being mad at us?
Every voice should sing, and help the music sound miraculous

[Chorus]
(Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la)
Ha, oh yes, y'all
This situation has now been brought before your very eyes
And as we carry on Flipmode Squad continues to conquer the world
(Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la-la)
When disaster strikes, you will all fear
When disaster strikes, you will all bear witness
To the Most High Exalted, ha
