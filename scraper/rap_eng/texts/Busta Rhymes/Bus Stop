[Hook]
Yo, ayo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Back to make bitches gitty up
Round zero the street and lock the whole city up, bitch
Put on that blouse that push both your titties up
I might let you come shake 'em off in my next video
Hmm, niggas get all Cristi'd up
Mixed with Hennessy sipping, walk around pissy drunk
Women next to me stripping, my live bitches with me
Thugs readily flip it, my hood niggas give it up
Hmm, yo, I'm rocking with the strap, bitch
Diamonds and [?] guns, cocky nigga, rap shit
Snatch a couple of one's, my money bundle stack thick
Double my funds and rumble when they act sick
Hmm, listen, when you see me walk back
Listen when I be speaking, don't give me talk back
Boy, you should've been linking, I'll lay you on the floor flat
And when the hood see me step in the building they like

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Watch my grand entry showing out
Sipping something exotic, pinky finger poking out
Shit on most of you jokers, give you shit to joke bout
Flip on you golfers, watch my niggas choke 'em out
Hmm, bless your boys, watch 'em shiver, bitch
(He said what?) Please ask the roids on my fingers, bitch
Yah, while you climb up ladders still I sit on top of the world
You niggas know my swagger ill, jizz on top of your girl
You niggas know you better chill
Nourish her burger and turn her into a daffodil
Yah, you ain't nothing but a fake boss
Cut you niggas with knives and eat you with a steak sauce
If you knowing what's good, Duke, you better break North
Or we fuck up your money and cut your [?] my cake off, bitch
Jump in the V cause we about to take off
And I'm whipping through the hood and my niggas see me, they be like

[Hook]
