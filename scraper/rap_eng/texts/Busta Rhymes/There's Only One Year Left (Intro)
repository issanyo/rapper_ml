[Skit: Girl & Man]
Daddy, what's it gonna be like in the year 2000?
Well sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll all be peaches & cream.
But I'm afraid the end time is near
The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind
It will be an Era fraught with boundless greed & corruption
Where global monetary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice
The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens
Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins
Un-shielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted
Left to bake in the searing naked rays of light
Wholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government
Leaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves
Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreck havok
Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out
Unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust
Annihilating the terrified masses
Leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers
Begged on revenge, but against whom?
There are so few left alive
Starvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path
Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell
Causing unending volcanic eruptions
The creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison
Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure
Laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers
Fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains
This is, Extinction Level Event
The Final World Front, and there is only, one, year, left
Wow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!
You don't have to, because here it is

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Callin' all live niggas
Callin' all live bitches
We got a job for y'all on planet earth
Flipmode world domination in progress
Motherfuckers
