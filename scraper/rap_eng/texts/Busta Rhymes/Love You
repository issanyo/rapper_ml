Give a kiss, give a hug
That's the reason to show love
With a beast stop crying

Tell me what be finding
Well we could all be happy
We take it all for granted

[Verse 2: Timati]
Please save the bay beast, Black, White, Yellow stop
All let the maybes, hating, crazy
All a brother needed was a lil' push
He so quick to push me, ride of the edge
Write my name in red, write me off as dead
[?] they deliver
We keep on sippin' Patrone, forget about the liver
I was born at the top of the world
Now i travel round the globe
Showing love to the world
Who cares about the kids, they're on drugs
Little young girls selling their bodies for love
See, we still got drawness manning slavery
God please save us, make a soul one please

[Chorus]
You can call me, when you need me
I'll be right there, I'm gonna love you
And no matter what you look like
Where you from cause, I'm gonna love you
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna love you

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Every single day i wake up, I'm always ready and willing
Always focus on my grind and i hope you feel what i'm feeling
So much thoughts be on my mind, going to process of building
Every moment i'm a shine, cause i'm doing this for my children
See the things i used to do, I was told could be self distructive
Mommy beat me in the head, til the things i did was productive
That's why i count my every blessing, tryin to spead the love equal
And lead by good example, I'll always inspire people

[Chorus]
You can call me, when you need me
I'll be right there, I'm gonna love you
And no matter what you look like
Where you from cause, I'm gonna love you
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna love you

[Timati]
It's time to rid the world of wars, hunger and disease. If we all come together, for the future of our kids. To make it easier for them to live. What happened to little kids playing on streets? Old folks stepping to the beat. I hear the heart beat of the world is getting stronger. I can feel it right now, yeah. I can feel it right here, can you? I can feel it!

[Chorus]
You can call me, when you need me
I'll be right there, I'm gonna love you
And no matter what you look like
Where you from cause, I'm gonna love you
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love you
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna love you
