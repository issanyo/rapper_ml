[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You said you wouldn't mind so I'll go on without ya
If you wanna shine, I'll bet you shine without me
Cause I been too good to let you take me down
[?] is that you drive me to drinking
I'm feeling good and really good about me
So now that I know how to get it for myself
This is really your loss


[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Now seen them was the days
When a nigga ain't ever really had shit
And a nigga might of stole some shit
Cause a nigga ain't ever really
Have a pot to piss inside of
I was kinda hard-headed
And I was the type
That'll quickly put the ratch up to you
Nigga being hard-headed
And they never learn
Till a mother fucker catch up to you
Older folk in the neighborhood
Did their very best to really come try teach us
Every time they'd bounce they return
Just to catch us on the corner smokin' them reefers
Do a lot of dirt, do a lot of crime on the block for bread
While the older folk were on their way home from church
Every single time they'd see use they shakin' they head
At the time when a nigga really needed some money
Know a nigga really followed deception
All the older gangsters though a nigga needed direction
So when the gangsters looked at a little nigga
And they really seen they reflection
Niggas gave me the trey eight special
Said a nigga needed protection
A lot of mu'hfuckers that I thought I was cool wit'
Was kinda hatin' me under... the surface
Niggas really wished the worst for me
Like I'm 'posed to suffer
But I wish the best for a nigga like you
But what you don't know about me
Is that I'm really destined for this shit
Let's see you do it without me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You said you wouldn't mind so I'll go on without ya
If you wanna shine, I'll bet you shine without me
Cause I been too good to let you take me down
[?] is that you drive me to drinking
I'm feeling good and really good about me
So now that I know how to get it for myself
This is really your loss

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Lemme get up on my hustle
And I hit the strip
When I whip it and I dip and I boast
Sometimes the street might
Try to bite a nigga that's why I drive with the toast
Sometime the block'll have a nigga feelin'
Like a nigga crept with a ghost
It's nothin' though cause you we been a hood
That's why we reppin the most
See the gutter life'll do it to you
All you niggas on the grind
And you go in to hustle for paper
Nigga watch these broke niggas try to bring it to you
No need to fight you to shine
Cause I was one of them
Hungry little hustlelin' niggas
Who always gotta think big
And you know a nigga stuck with the grind
I wonder if it's really for the better or for the worse
These niggas that you thought was the closest to you
End up becoming them niggas thats
Crossing the line first
So I take it
All inside cause I guess its all a part of our growth
You know I gotta keep my eyes on a lotta niggas that I always
Thought was my folks
Violate in any way
You think a nigga ain't gon' hurt you?
Just cause you bitch don't mean you can't catch it
Nigga better move from my circle
I wish the best for dudes like you
But what you don't know about me
Is that I'm really destined for this shit
Let's see you do it without me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You said you wouldn't mind so I'll go on without ya
If you wanna shine, I'll bet you shine without me
Cause I been too good to let you take me down
[?] is that you drive me to drinking
I'm feeling good and really good about me
So now that I know how to get it for myself
This is really your loss
