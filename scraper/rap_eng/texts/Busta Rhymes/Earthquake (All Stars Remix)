Labrinth, come in

[Intro: Labrinth]
Ladies and Gentlemen, gathered before you are 5 of the finest word-smiths known to mankind
What you are about to witness is no illusion

Tinie Tempah, come in

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
A hundred thousand people everybody mosh pitting
I make the most of every minute that the clock give me
So come and rock with me everybody rocking out
I make em jump till there's a hole in the fucking ground
Pose for a picture, nigga I am so off the Richter
All I do is shots shots shots, I don't use no cup or no mixer
I rock all my clothes like a hipster
And I rock them shades like a G
That girl be definitely coming if she's coming with me
I'm like a hundred degrees man I'm even hotter than August
See half them girls in your city they probably got on my tour bus
I make 'em ugly
Where my Paracetamol and Anadin and a crystal ball for my n-n-n-nig Labrinth

Kano, come in

[Verse 2: Kano]
Said I been gone for a hot minute
Who put my Rolex on the radiator
Back like boomerang I'm Dundee'ing it
But you might see me later alligator
In some bally lace ups, with some jacket tapered
So much stones you thought it was animation
Wilma on my case cos all these chicks adjacent
To my table tryna drink my vodka and champagne up
I ain't no Matt Damon, but Bourne with Ultimatums
Get rich or die trying so we started caking
I'm doing 'caine but not the brother of Undertaker
And I ain't Muslim but tell my brothers Assalamu Alaykum
Finish him, Kano my nigga no Raiden
Fuck with my dog then my nigga Alsatian
Tell a man... make a man blazing
Cover up what? nigga tuck chains in
Diamonds all in your face like shaving
And the gyal dem call me Earthquake
Cos I make their pussy cave in
I'm a beast

Wretch 32, come in

[Verse 3: Wretch 32]
Got so much cuts I had to teach myself first aid, hey
I'm tryin to learn to play safe
I never get caught out before I get to third base
But still they see me coming I lash in your face
I guess I'm getting foul again
Pure waste and the flows pants are my trouser dem
Throw a little cheese at the rats
Say we're labbin em, you see I'mma be a bigger cat
Watch me scratch it in, scratch it in, scratch it in
I ain't here for no packaging, ain't the cutest brother brother
But shaped like a mannequin
Ladies throwing me their clothes, then using their Apocalips
Brother you ain't got no inner soul, put a sock in it

[Verse 4: Labrinth]
They thought I disappeared, I just did a gap year like a fresher came back like a graduate
Now everybody's scared cause the damage that I've done with two songs
Is probably more than their album did
Be afraid, be afraid I'mma get'cha
Little Lab's making earthquakes in America
I ain't the Messiah but they call me the creator
When I said let there be light how many stars did I make huh?
Yeah I got the Midas touch
Got gold diggers looking at my fine wrist watch
Even got the restaurant to fine dine this fox
Better call me by my name that's right it's Boss now
Levels levels I take the levels up triples
Just take those triples and triple it I'm so far gone
I'm high can't get me down like a hard on
Cause the morning says glory when a star is born hello

I predict an earthquake up in here
Say yeah
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yes mosh for me
Hey yeah (Oh My God)
We can make an earthquake up in here

Busta, come in

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Busa Rhymes Labrinth, coming to a hood near you
Like you’re ’bout to get your ass kicked
Try to front little homie I dare you (come on)
With this type of banger is on in the club
Nobody wanna hear you
Then a big foot step up in the place
Like I’m comin’ in to kill you
Bang ‘em earthquake
Every time I bark on the mic and I won’t stop
The I hit ‘em and I get ‘em all again
Gotta shut it down, everybody knows that I close shop
Yes yes yes, ok
Now I’m in the building, do what I say
Jump around, hands in the air
And you better get to it ‘cuz you know I don’t play
And let us get it poppin’ and then we turn it up a little
Cuz you know we gotta do it and we doin it well
I’m about to explode
Heat it up a little more, beat it up a little more, boy you can’t tell
T-Trust me homie
Do not walk up in my shadow
Just respect my handle while we bang and make the
Earth rattle

Go Yeah
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say yeah
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me Hey yeah
We can make an earthquake up in here
(So here we go we go)
Labrinth, come in
