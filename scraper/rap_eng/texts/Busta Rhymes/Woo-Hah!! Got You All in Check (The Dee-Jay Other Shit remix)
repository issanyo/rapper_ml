Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah
Yah-yah

(Chorus)
When I step up in the place, ayo, I step correct
Woo-hah! I got you all in check
I got that head-nod s**t that make you break your neck
Woo-hah! I got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque
Woo-hah! I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect
Woo-hah! I got you all in check

(1st verse)
Busta Rhymes up in the place true indeed
Yes, I catch wreck and that's word on my seed
I'm guaranteed to give you what you need
One blood everybody like Junior Reid
Wake up every morning, yo, I must succeed
Nationwide ruckus make the world stampede
You really let me roll some w**d
Mad charged n***a, now I must proceed
Yo, we 'bout to make moves; set speed
Peace to Baby Mike, Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed
Watch me knock you out like Apollo Creed
Body blow bustin' your s**t making you bleed
Just feed off dynamic flows and take heed
Need more information homeboy then just read
Aya! You can read all about the pure breed
Do the bogle dance I'll do the pepperseed

-Chorus-

(Verse 2)
How dare you ever try to step on my suede shoes?
"Top Gun" shut down your firm like Tom Cruise
Please let me get down and blow a fuse
Actin' fool breakin' s**t down to molecules
Yo let me hit you with my ill street blues
Busta Rhymes always headlines the street news
Woo-hah!
Yo, baby girl don't be confused
Sail my seven seas and enjoy my boat cruise
I know you really want to know who's comin' through leaving bloodstains and residues
Sorry, homeboy, but your flow sounds used
Gotta pay your dues, baby, you know the rules
Whenever I travel the world, I landcruise
If you choose to f**k around, you get bruised
Now I got you gassed on super unleaded fuels
Give me room, give me some space, yo excuse

-Chorus-

(Rampage) You now rockin' wit the best the boy scout is who I be
Flipmode is the sqaud Hah

Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah (8x)

(Verse 3)
Yo, which motherf**ka stole my flow?
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo
Throw that type of n***a right out my window
Blast your a** hit you with my direct blow
Bo! Coming through like G.I. Joe
Star Wars movie deal like Han Solo
Make you bounce around like this was calypso
Always shine cause I got the high pro glow
You think that you can hide you think you can lay low
Roll up on your a** like Hawaii 5-0
Mad out with my dreads in my kangol
Forget the Moet n***a just pass the Cisco Yo!
Take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that shit that might make you psycho
Maximum frequencies through your stereo
Sorry this is it but homeboy I got to go

-Chorus-

Hah Yo Yo Yay Yo Yay Yo Yo Yay . ..
Yay Yo Yay . .. Yay
