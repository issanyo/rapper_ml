Rah Digga
The Harriet Thugman of hip hop has returned baby
C'mon!

[Verse 1]
I be that house nigga squatting in the lab
Rhymes comin, rhymes goin like I was a dollar cab
Fingerin the man tryin to tap into his spirit
A misguided soul so ain't checkin for the lyrics
Many different players, only one hold the ball
Ghetto fabulous chick, go against the protocol
With the grittiest lingo, still such a little sweetheart
Book educated with a whole lotta street smarts
Follow me now, as I build my fanbases
Makin rappers worry like they got open cases
Harriet Thugman, bout to see shit through
Like a whole world of people wait for Episode Two
I be the rap purist, the walking hip hop thesaurus
The innovator, spawned from Libra and Taurus
Do away cats with the same ol' whack
Lead a nation up north where the real party at
A place where we spray when our asses get older
No shots in the throat, no gettin pulled over
A place where graffiti ain't considered a crime
And your favorirte underrated MC's is primetime
A land good and fruitful, where lyrics free people
Black presidents, and all the weed legal
No rich or poor, we break bread and drink merry
Smoke a little Mary for the real visionaries
