[Intro: Bounty Killer]
A who?!
Nuh Bounty Killer and Busta Rhymes and the godfather Junior Reid
Indeed!
Set speed
We nuh gone a lead
Eyes a bleed

[Chorus]
Ayo, we change just like the weather, tell a punk don't mess with we
Tell you say, the magazine long and bend, and dem go get this Haskell grieve
Well, believe it or not....well, right here is your dying place
Ayo, we change just like the weather
Tell a punk don't mess with we, so Junior Reid say

Gun nuh have sense, a the man weh deh behind it, sta-now
Twang, twang!
Gun nuh have sense, a the man weh deh behind it
Hear this!
No man nuh rough, nuh tough, no man nuh badder than no man
No man nuh rough, nuh tough, no man nuh badder than no man
No man nuh bigger, better, broader, larger than no man
Jah Jah make the whole of we, he make us as one

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Yo
Yo, yo
Busta Rhymes this
I gotta give them robotic, if you want antibiotics, so exotic
Every time I be rhyming, giving off that glow
Becoming your broad's best friend just like a diamond
Over the rocky mountains I be climbing
Hibernating and providing a wild flow
Say that's my my word, to feel the timing
Keep it moving son!
Yo, you best believe I always keep reminding about the mastermind behind lyrics designing

[Verse 2: Bounty Killer]
So me say!
Black Talon a take dem in a bundle
Diss man from Waterhouse and all Jungle
Brooklyn man dem burn you pon dungle
Diss .45, me claat, it nah fumble
Run up inna mi gun and Black Rhino make you stumble
Sound of mi gun is like when earthquake a rumble
Coulda have your life, only if you just humble
Many were called, but a you mi gun chosen

[Chorus]
Because, we change just like the weather, tell a punk don't mess with we
Well you see, the magazine long and bend, and dem go get this Haskell grieve
Well, believe it or not....well, right here is your dying place
Ayo, we change just like the weather
Tell a punk don't mess with we, so Junior Reid say

Gun nuh have sense, a the man weh deh behind it, sta-now
Twang, twang!
Gun nuh have sense, a the man weh deh behind it
Hear this!
No man nuh rough, nuh tough, no man nuh badder than no man
No man nuh rough, nuh tough, no man nuh badder than no man
No man nuh bigger, better, broader, larger than no man
Jah Jah make the whole of we, he make us as one

[Verse 3: Bounty Killer]
Well, I am a man of experience
And me done know say that, no gun nuh have sense
Anyhow you use your gun, use it in self defense
Listen to Junior Reid's musical content
And Busta Rhymes say, "dem fi follow every sentence"
Wha' make dem go jump all di Flipmode Squad fence?
And Scare Dem, dem nah take no statements
JR Crew, dem no leave not an evidence

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Yo!
You must believe that Bounty Killer, Junior Reid and Busta Rhymes
So much lyrics to fuel an impact like the world's biggest crimes
Blow your mind!
Lyrics up in your body like the bullets that's hard to find
Y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Each and every time I shoot some bite shit from out my mouth that make you niggas blind
Lyrics
You know I'm quick to chop niggas who talk shit, but they put their fucking guns back in their pocket

[Chorus]
Ayo, we change just like the weather, tell a punk don't mess with we
Tell you say, the magazine long and bend, how dem fi get this Haskell grieve?
Well, believe it or not....well, right here is your dying place
Because, we change just like the weather
Tell a punk don't mess with we, so Junior Reid say

Gun nuh have sense, a the man weh deh behind it, sta-now
(Ok, that's right!)
Gun nuh have sense, a the man weh deh behind it
Hear this!
