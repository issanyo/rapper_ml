[Verse 1]
Take off your shoes
Make you dance in your socks
For blocks
Nigga be dippin' a million Watts hot!
Better pause and take a look
There's a whole lot of whores
Run up in a storm
Bitch a try to take you for yours, for sure
Word up, yo!
Etch-a-sketch it, ya can't catch it
So play it on a record and take it off 'til you ass naked
Word to mother
Shorty stacked like a horse
Pushin' a force
Lookin' to floss
Diana Ross
Flow better
One of the biggest seller
Tell me whatever
Whether a nigga stack mozzarella
(Hey, hey, you) I'mma get ya
I ain't comin' with ya
Hit ya
With another scripture that will really split ya
Based on the fact you wack
And we don't need none of that
Keepin it movin'
Now tell me, where my nigga's is at?
Yo, from here to Brook, niggas is shook, look
I'll make you sing the hook
Shake your ass
Wiggle your foot
I'll make you

[Chorus]
Take it off
Shit so hot we make you
Take it off
Give me what you got, nigga
Take it off
And we hit the right spot, baby
Take it off
And everybody if you with me, just
Take it off
Shit so hot we make you
Take it off
Give me what you got, nigga
Take it off
And when I hit the right spot, baby
Take it off
And if you with me everybody just
Take it off

[Verse 2]
Wiggle and bounce baby
More to the ounce baby
That's what I be about baby
Give me a shout baby
All up in your body
Whipping the Maserati
Through the city
With one of my hottie
I'm on my way to the party
Meet with my nigga Marty
And Little Gotti and Scotty
Sippin' Bacardi
So you know we runnin' up everybody
Whip about 50 cars
Roll in the jam, niggas whylin out at the bar
(OHH)
We keep it movin'
(OHH)
Every time, yo (OOH)
Shit that make your DJ spin it back four times, yo
Let it rain and let it drizzle
Heat in the club be makin' you sizzle
All of the bitches right in the middle
(WORD UP)
I make y'all niggas move
Making you sweat
Making you get busy
Got y'all niggas losin' your breath
So I started walking this way
Pass the stingrays
See the Kunta Kinte
Chick doing meringue
Hey Mister DJ
Hit with a replay
Check it
Hey why you all in my face
Give me some leeway
Got you doin' what we say
Other niggas racing and whylin out on the freeway
Rushin' to get in a club and get all up in the place
Get inside and see FLIPMODE in your face
(ooh)
Now let me take y'all niggas straight to the point
After the party, radio be still bangin' my joint
Turn it up a little while I make you

[Chorus]
Take it off
Shit so hot we make you
Take it off
Give me what you got, nigga
Take it off
And we hit the right spot, baby
Take it off
And everybody if you with me just
Take it off
Shit so hot we make you
Take it off
Give me what you got, nigga
Take it off
And when we hit the right spot, baby
Take it off
And everybody if you with me just
Take it off
Shit so hot we make you
Take it off
Flipmode is the squad, nigga
