[Intro]
Uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh..
Yeah yeah, here we go y'all
Here we here we here we go y'all
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode y'all
Yeah yeah y'all
Extinction Level Event shit
Bomb threat to the whole world
What what what is goin' on?
What the fuck goin' on here? Check it out yo

[Verse 1]
Holy amazing grace about face
Total erase you niggas off the face of the place
Such a shame I had to go grab my calico
Pass the dough 'fore you find out what I had to blast you fo'
Extreme laws for ones who did try to go against this
Wet your shit up like a sloppy tongue kiss
Wait, but wait, you, who don't know what you talkin' about
Without a doubt, where my live niggas? Give me a shout!
Yo, yo-yo, yo, on the strength shit niggas check fo'
Connect the four shots and guess who blew it from next door
Bling, time after time we gon' shine again
Feel it like a broad getting fucked from behind again
Ayo, ayo I be the closest thing to the next
Like the pain and sufferin' of about a million deaths
I'm only here to present and bring the impact
Of the Extinction Level Event, now sing the song of salvation

[Chorus]
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la

[Verse 2]
Yo yo yo, disregard your whole assignment
Crooked ass nigga need some realignment, powerful refinement
Crazy shit I do make me wanna know where my mind went
Blackin' out, buildin' hostility, gettin' violent
Straight giving niggas an ass-whippin' on consignment
Then I bust your shit 'til the day of my whole retirement
Yo, yo, shake it and rattle like we ready to battle
Fight seein' at every angle like a motherfucking satellite
Quickly bust up your crotches and fuck up your process
Bounce in the night, leavin' sayin' "Adios" or even "Buenas noches"
Have y'all niggas wildin', havin' a fit
Flame throwin' lyrics like a bunch of blowtorches and shit
Grand spectacular, chainsaw massacre
Thug fanatic street shit that be on the creep comin' after ya
Then we hit you with the most significant time bomb
Ready to designate at the slightest wave of a white arm
Best form of advice I could give is remain calm
The repercussion is somethin' you could never imagine would be goin' on
(HA!) Never believe in your eyes
When my Squad some through at an astronomically large size
Movin the mountains keepin' all of my niggas bouncin'
Big up my bitches in the place who be screamin' and shoutin'
(HA!) I'm only here to present
And bring the impact of the Extinction Level Event
Sing the song of salvation

[Chorus]
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
