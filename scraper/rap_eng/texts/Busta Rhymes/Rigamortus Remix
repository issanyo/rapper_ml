[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, Kendrick Lamar, do it again
Alright, here we go, third take (Dead)
Rigamortus Remix, it feel good
Real quick Ali (Kendrick Lamar, fuck it up this time)
Haha, yeah

[Chrous: Kendrick Lamar]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Bitch

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And this is rigamortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate this fucking parasite

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's
Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
Solar system and barbeque, ain't nothing else you can do

(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I killed him
(He dead) Haha (Amen) Amen

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead)  fo' sho (Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy
I assassin my casualty and it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to be 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen

[Chrous: Kendrick Lamar]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Pull up and park in my Caddy
That's when I fuck it up badly
Frankly, I'm happy to tell niggas
"Have manners 'front they daddy"
I carry the Anthony Mackie
And put holes in you badly
Fuck sending you off in a hearse
I'll send you off in a taxi
Have you bloody leaky looking like you tampon or maxi
Retaliation talk (Shut the fuck up nigga!) Exactly
Nasty the classy the flashiest how I'm on it
Don't ask me no kind of questions and mention
I'll leave your face in a pantry
And gladly lump up your shit and bumpin' your face up like acne
Break your teeth, replace them with veneers bigger than Little Scrappy
Feeling like growing my dread again
Letting my shit get nappy
Throw me on a New York fitted
While reppin' like I'm a Yankee
If they wanna front then I hit em and I tap em
Eat a nigga's food like its a scampi
When it come to bitch niggas, I'm a little bit a racist
Governor Pataki
Papi, here to massacre aunti
Now pops was a little bit manly, fuck all that aiming
I'mma hit him in the front, hit him in the back
So substanc-y
Then I gotta Bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-beat a nigga leave him in the alley
You don't really really know how you niggas always be making me aggie
Organs in your drawers now you wearing your pants saggy
Haggling niggas with scriptures I'm spittin, you should be happy
Gradually when I hit you I split you and leave you sadly
In a situation lay you out flatter than chicken patties
It's the God, you hear me talking whenever you hear the raspy
And when it comes to murkin' something you should never put it past me!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] :
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Amen
