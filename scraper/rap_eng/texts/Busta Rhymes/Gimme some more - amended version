Intro:

Yeah
As a shorty playing in the front yard of the crib
Fell down, and I bumped my head
Somebody helped me up and asked me if I bumped my head
I said Yeah
So then they said oh so that mean we gon, you gon switch it on em
I said yeah, Flipmode, Flipmode is the greatest
Known as a shorty, I was always told
That if I ain't gon be part of the greatest
I gotta be the greatest myself

Verse One:
C'mon C'mon, Yeah, C'mon
Yeah nigga what, what a surprise
Get ya sumthin, make a nigga close bof ya eyes
All my niggas getting money capitalize
Die little small guy, we on the rise
Everything a nigga touch platinumize
Fully equipped, you know we come wit all the supplies
Got a big gun, and I'ma show you the size
You fuck wit any of my Flipmode family ties
Me and my niggas be comin through stalkin you out
Killin off any and everything you talkin about
See you in the club, now we walkin you out
Should've thought twice before you went and open your mouth
Yo, anyway we stay keepin it movin
Fuckin with the wrong nigga, hope you know what you doin
Now blame me, all the same niggas is lame
It's not a game, makin names still splittin your frames

Chorus:
Y'all niggas had enough
Gimme some more
Y'all niggas want the wild shit
Gimme some more
Yo Spliff where the weed at
Gimme some more
I know yaw'll niggas need that
Gimme some more
Even though we getting money you can
Gimme some more
With the cars and the big crib
Gimme some more
Everybody spread love
Gimme some more
If you want it let me hear you say
Gimme some more

Verse Two:
Blast with a rash gimme my cash flickin my ass
Runnin with my money son go out with a blast
Do what you want, a niggas cuttin the corner
You fuckin up, oh to go ahead and meet the reporter
Yo, she tellin news on how you switch to a bitch
Little fake funny style, nigga chill with a snitch
So now I pass and trait over your blood and to ask you
Make a little roof for me and all my niggas to pass through
Cartier, Sidney Poitier, hey horray shit
What with all my niggas from around the way shit
When I come through you niggas know I do my thing
Bring more shit that generate money *Ching Ching*
Arrest you lyrically flow and caress you
Bless you, then a nigga come to your rescue
While you assume a nigga blossom and bloom
I'm comin soon hit you with a boom gimme some room

(Chorus)

Verse Three:
Yo, live nigga shit know what I mean
I represent while we gettin money your rain supreme
Hope you niggas know we comin through full steam
Can't see you better turn on your high beam
All my niggas while I'm ringing the sireen
FLIPMODE be the glory niggas on my team
Never should you ever try to fuck wit my cream
I O.D. when my shit get all in your bloodstream
Everytime we be ripping it be blowing it down
Blowing you off fuckin wit the hottest niggas around
Luck is when me and my people bother your town
Holdin it down takin awhile and then gimme my crown
Ay, all my people need to come and surround
A nigga be hittin so much it make you fall on the ground
Sure to make you shot that's what I be all about
Turning you out makin all you niggas fall out

(Chorus)
