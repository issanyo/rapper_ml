[Intro: Daughter]
Alright, listen up motherfathers
This one's about the swagger wagon
I wash your mouth out with soap if you call it a minivan
That's a dirty word
Drop that beat
(Swagger wagon swagger wagon, sw-sw-sw-swagger wagon)
(Swagger wagon swagger wagon, sw-sw-sw-swagger wagon)

[Verse 1: Dad]
Yeah it's called the swagger wagon
I know that it sounds like braggin'
When we pull up to karate
All the other parent's tongues are waggin'
They be like "who that is?"
It's just us and the kids
Swaggin' hard until it's dark
Leaving home around 8 PM

[Interlude 1: Dad (Kids)]
Then it's lights out kids, mkay?
(Awww)
Hey, rules are rules!

[Hook: Dad]
We gonna roll in the swagger wagon
The neighbors know cause their rides are laggin'
That's how it goes, put some tapes are blastin'
Wipe off your shoes, when you step inside my swagger wagon

[Verse 2: Kids]
Our swagger is smoother than butter, it's louder than thunder
We kick it like punters in matching red jumpers
Hitting speed bumps over the limit
Parents on time, never late one minute
Homework done right around 6ish
Getting everything on the holiday wishlist
Now we hot like summer so you ain't gotta wonder
How dad hurt his lumbar, while unloading lumber
He shouted "oh brother" well not exactly oh brother
He said *beep beep* then "don't tell your mother"

[Interlude 2: Mom (Dad)]
Woah, no swearing
You are in trouble later
I am taking over this song
Luckily, Sirius XM has tons of great channels
(W-w-wait, why you talking like that?)
(Did you just do product placement inside our swagger wagon music video?)
Yeah, how else do you think we got Busta Rhymes on the track?
(I'm gonna afford this)
(Swagger wagon swagger wagon, sw-sw-sw-swagger wagon)
(Swagger wagon swagger wagon, sw-sw-sw-swagger wagon)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Look
I done been around the world in every square inch of the planet
It don't matter where we at, we keep it fresh down to the fabric
We keep it regal, sharp as a needle, you know that it's a habit
All my folks is powerful people, you know we got it mastered
I see the way you do it and the way you get to cracking
You pull up rims shining, trust me, I'm digging your wagon
Again we going across the almanac, you know who be the waviest
For when it comes to this cul-de-ac, this family is the craziest
(Swagger wagon swagger wagon, sw-sw-sw-swagger wagon)

[Verse 4: Dad]
We love being parents, but when it's tough to bear it
We need a night out, call up Marco and Karen
Dressed out to the nines, then after we dine
Our first time in the club, since 2009
It's a parents night out, so much fun in there and about
A quarter to ten when we're tired, no doubt (no doubt)
We're headed back home, they got kids so you know
They're asleep in their seats so I'm rapping alone
(Swagger wagon swagger wagon, sw-sw-sw-swagger wagon)
(Swagger wagon swagger wagon, sw-sw-sw-swagger wagon)

[Hook: Dad]

[Outro]
(Swagger wagon swagger wagon, sw-sw-sw-swagger wagon)
