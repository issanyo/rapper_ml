[Verse 1: J-Doe]
Ah, okay, break a mu'fucka, uh
J-Doe back up in this bitch
Can't nobody say his shit
Ain't some of the most amazing shit you heard?
That's my word
Bitch my flow is so superb
Any beat I'm on will get served
All that modest shit for the birds
Bitch I'm real, I'm so ill
I go in don't need no pill
Either you with me or against me
If you against me you get killed
I'm the best, I excel
Nothing less than number one
Number two leave that to you
Every fucking song I do sound like that

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, watch the way I drop'll make 'em lean back slow
Every time I spit you know they need that yo
A lot of niggas be needin' me to give them the shit that I be givin' 'em
And needin' me to be hittin' 'em how I just be hittin' 'em
With that 'I-can't-believe-that' flow
Steppin' like a giant nigga FE FI FO
See what I be doin' lyrically be uncivil and then I
Walk up into they building and step in the middle and
Giggle and bouncin' it be like I was playin' a fiddle and
Riddle and rattle the street like I went devil and divil and
Handle the rock when I dribble and I peel that dough
Niggas always know I'm on they heels and toes
Cause you already know my swag is nigga like a
Trampoline I got 'em bouncin' like
Shit be knockin' through the walls of the club
Cause you know I give you bangers that be soundin' like...

[Verse 3: J-Doe]
Look, look, I don't know what the rest of the industry is on
That shit wack...
But I'd rather do my own thing AND give the people what they want
Check my stats, I got:
Hits, bitch, better look out
Check the credits my name err'where now
Produce that, wrote this
Shit I'm taking over, oh shit
Focused, don't get lost
Yo bitch, runnin' with a boss
Front seat of my Jag is she
So just sit back; don't ask me shit
Niggas better know about me homie
I'm a G only and I feed those streets
Got three OZs of the D-O-B-E-B
To my backpack now that's crack jack
