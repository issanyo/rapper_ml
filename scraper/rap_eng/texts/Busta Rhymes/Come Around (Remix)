[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Flipmode bitch!!!
Yuh see when mi tun on my switch dem caan bloodclaat tun it off!!!!
Collie Buddz!!!! Busta Rhymes!!! Remix!!!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Every man fi just light dem weed come mek we smoke it on di regular
And it don't matter where we at you bring the weed back to America
High Times Magazine did an interview with the editor
Did an interview in person so we don't need to talk on a cellular
This shit is bigger than me, don't prosecute the messenger
Been distributing large portions of dro since the days of cresidents
Got a bitch name Jessica that would challenge any competitor
And come back with the highest grade of weed the hell with the replica
And when my grandfather passed he left me as an inheritor
Of about seventy acres of farm land of the best sensimelia
And nuh matta how dem a try di whole a dem know seh dat we caan dun
Although dem a mek noise dem seh dem love di smell when di weed a bun
Yo! And if you need the cush it's easy you know where to come
You a out of towner or local no matter where you and your people from
I got 'em in eights, quarters and halves I give you a couple pounds
And splurt wheneva yuh see police come around

[Chorus: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh mi look fah mi get it by di pound yeah
Sweet sensi a come around
Mi a tek a likkle draw and pass it around so
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh man a look fah mi stock it by di pound yeah
When babylon a come around
Ask dem weh dem a go search fah?

[Verse 2: Collie Buddz]
Ever since di herbs slow down, police and rudebwoy dem inna showdown
Dem a search round di compound
Yuh know I mon nah nuh weed clown
Find a likkle piece of land and I plant mi own ground
So, tell di yute dem now fi set field
Too much talk on cocaine a mek di world a feel ill yuh know
Nuff grade nuff spliff a build
Only ting weh a mek man feel still, hey, weh mi seh

[Chorus: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh mi look fah mi get it by di pound yeah
When Collie Buddz come around
A pure ganja man tune just a lick dem from di sound yeah
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh man a look fah mi stock it by di pound yeah
When babylon a come around
Ask dem weh dem a go search fah?

[Verse 3: Collie Buddz]
There's nothin like di sweet sweet sensi
Di first time mi mek a draw was in elementary
Reach high school lit di herb it plenty
Like Sacre Dem though one nah lenky
Mr. Spock neva empty
Di fifty dollar bag we call dat half century

[Chorus: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh mi look fah mi get it by di pound yeah
Sweet sensi a come around
Mi a tek a likkle draw and pass it around so

[Bridge: Collie Buddz]
Yo! Na na na na now!!! Yeah I!!! Yeah I!! Na na now!!!

When dem a go legalize, hey
Di farmer man nuh beg whole heap a bligh
When dem a go realize, government dem a terrorize
Cooperation dem a captilize
While, di farmerman nuh beg whole heap a bligh, yo

[Chorus: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh mi look fah mi get it by di pound yeah
When Collie Buddz come around
A pure ganja man tune just a lick dem from di sound yeah
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh man a look fah mi stock it by di pound yeah
When babylon a come around
Ask dem weh dem a go search fah?
