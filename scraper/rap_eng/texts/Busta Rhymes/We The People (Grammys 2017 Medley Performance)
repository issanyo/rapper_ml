[Intro: Q-Tip]
We'd like to say to all of those people around the world, all of those people who are pushing people who are in power to represent them...tonight, we represent you. And we also dedicate this to our brother who's not here, Phife Dawg

[Verse 1: Award Tour]
Get up
(Get up!)
Get up
(Everybody)
We going back
It goes it goes it goes it goes
(We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man)
(Going each and every place with the mic in my hand)
Grab it
(Come on, come on)
Bring that back, bring that back, bring that back
[Record scratch]

[Verse 2: Can I Kick It?]
Can I kick it?
(Yes you can!)
Can I kick it?
(Yes you can! )
Can I kick it?
(Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone!
(Go on then)
Come on!
Let's go!
Are y'all ready?
Are y'all ready?
Are y'all ready?
Are y'all ready?

[Verse 3: Award Tour]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in my hand
Grab it
(Come on, come on)
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in my hand
Grab it

[Q-Tip]
Anderson Paak!

[Verse 4: Movin Backwards]
Clap your hands y'all, uh uh
Clap your hands y'all, hey hey hey

I don't want to move backwards no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?
I don't want to move backwards, no

(I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on
I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand)
(Sing it
Sing it)
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?

[Chorus: Anderson. Paak]
I spun around without a care
When I stopped, I felt lost
I'm two heels from the top tier
Really want to be boss
I figured it out, figured it out somewhere
Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere, yeah yeah
I don't want to move backwards, no
I can't go back in
(Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction)
Can't listen in, hey
I don't want to move backwards, no

[Verse 5: We The People]
[Busta Rhymes (Consequence)]
Hey yo Consequence
(What up Bus')
[I'm not feeling the political climate right now?]
(Yo I feel you, I feel you)
I just want to thank President Agent Orange
(What up Cheeto?)
For perpetuating all of the evil that you've been perpetuating throughout the United States
(Wall)
I want to thank President Agent Orange for his successful attempt at the Muslim ban
When we come together

We the people
(Let's go)
[x8]

We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-brother mood
When we get hungry we eat the same [?] food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a brother gettin' commas
Brothers in my hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, so it's not no hole
Trendsetter, ayo, I know it's cold
Top 5 yo if I could be so bold
But now you

[Chorus (Anderson .Paak)]
All of the bad folks, you must go
(Dark-skinned, [?], you've gots to go)
All of my poor folks, you must go
[(Steal from us every day and I give them dough)?]
And all of them Mexicans, you must go
(Don't forget about the Chinese and Filipinos)
Muslims and gays
(You've gots to go)
Boy, we hate your ways
(Just go away)

All of our rap folk you must go

[Q-Tip]
Phife Dawg!

[Bridge: Phife Dawg]
The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the - block

[All]
Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

[Chorus (Anderson .Paak)]
All of my black folks, you must go
(Dark-skinned, [?], you've gots to go)
All of my poor folks, you must go
(Still hustling every day and [?])
And all of ya Mexicans, you must go
(Don't forget about the Chinese and Filipinos)
Muslims and gays
(Just go away)
Boy, we hate your ways
(And they hate your ways)

All of you bad folks you must go
