[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, ninety-six for my Nostrand Ave niggas
My Fulton Street niggas (hardcore for ninety-six)
Dangerous MC's

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Uhh (check it out), uhh
Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Oooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is...
Not that thinner kid, bandanas, tattoos
My fist never bruise, land-still-cruise
Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TA-DOW!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, frays raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin 'bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead lead to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches
Missed you by pinches, your talk is senseless
Actor needs chiropractor, for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked, your chatterbox
Dangerous you're not, I gets down
Twist your body round and round, upside down

[Chorus]
Is the love really there (is it)
Do a thug shed the same tear? (never know)
Throw your ice in the the ear we here
And we all gon ball 'til the courts up here
Don't give a fuck what them niggas think we talk in here (come on)
Is the love really there (is it)
Do a thug shed the same tear? (never know)
Throw your ice in the the ear we here
And we all gon' ball 'til the courts up here
Don't give a fuck what them niggas think we talkin in here

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Uhh, smoke a little then we cut coke a little
And we skim a little off of the top
Taking you back when niggas use to snort coke
And toast through the hood and [?]
Be the richest folk to float through the hood
Niggas doin' real good, it was evident
In the testament, when coke flow was good
When Ronald Reagan was president
The say no to drugs grown greatly irrelevant
Niggas gettin caught with bricks
But still reaching the settlement
Niggas get a one to three
Come home in twelve mounts
Run up and take a niggas shit
Leave 'em with twelve lumps
I've never been so willin'
To put the thoughts of mo killin'
Into manufacturing a flow so bone chillin'
Icy with a pistol, nigga
Shit glitter like ball room chandelier with crystal, nigga
I stack money as we live life simple
In the corner of the club sippin' on a Harvey Bristol, nigga
C'mon, modern day gangsta shit
And die slow as we give you niggas cancer shit, c'mon

[Chorus]
Is the love really there (is it)
Do a thug shed the same tear? (never know)
Throw your ice in the the ear we here
And we all gon ball 'til the courts up here
Don't give a fuck what them niggas think we talk in here (come on)
Is the love really there (is it)
Do a thug shed the same tear? (never know)
Throw your ice in the the ear we here
And we all gon' ball 'til the courts up here
Don't give a fuck what them niggas think we talkin in here

[Verse 3: Labba]
What you know about a nigga murder i got no chemical
Than courts in Miami water got shit federal
Time for that ass
I rather go to little heyday boy some bricks in the station
Head back long crossed 8 mile to become the boss enforce the Laws
You want some motherfuckin' hoes there keep it steppin'
No discount player no fuckin' credit
No shorts, I came to Governor lost (damn)
I came to price the dime bribe source
You had a devil smokin with them rebels
We kill for money and power
Extortionin' in my own hood and that shit's power
A black man crime call 'em a coward
A black man knowledge we kill 'em tomorrow
Its sickenin' that's how our people live
We disrespect our elders and curse our Church Members
