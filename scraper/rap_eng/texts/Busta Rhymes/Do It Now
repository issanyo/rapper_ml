Back up, back up, back up, back up
Back up back up back up back up EASE off
This goes out to all area crew (yes yes)
To my BK crew (ooh-OOOOOOOH-WHEEE) to my QB crew
My LI crew, my Shaolin crew
My Dirty South crew
(What cha'll niggas know about the Dirty South?)
Atlanta, North Cakalak'
For all my fam, all area crew (AOWWWWWWWWW)
Yeah mon!!

Yes, the first cut should be the deepest
To penetrate beyond the muscle wall's inner regions
First you was icin me, connect with the starin at the speakers
Heard the rhyme, head high, what ya starin at ya sneakers
You shy now, got a lot of things on your mind now
You don't feel fly now, you huntin the exit sign down
Fuck what you heard, cause I snatch the grapevine down (yea yeah)
Don't understand how I ran the line down? Rewind now

[Busta Rhymes]
YO!! We be the most magnetic, so athletic
Leave your peeps on the side so they can watch you and your mans get it
Take the arch rivalry stance up on the podium
And give the flavor to niggas but keep it low on sodium
Posess shit that got you wonderin how we holdin em
Things that'll lay you out like a piece of linoleum
Bring who-ever you want, we bout to bug son and bounce
Down to Henry Hudson, after I bust one!

Hotter than Reno when discovered by Bugsy Siegel

Heavy aquatic water flows keepin them on they toes
Tell them thugs that wanna be CEO's to be derobed
'Fore I wear your little dumb ass out like Easter clothes!

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, yo-yo yo-yo

Sometime I speak slow so people understand my street flow
And while we keep it hot, we got the most shine up in
This WHOLE SHIT, me and Mos spit and blow the show quick
