Chorus:
Do you really wanna party with me
Let me see just what you got for me
Put all your hands where my eyes could see
Straight buck wildin in the place to be
If you really wanna party with me

Put all your hands where my eyes could see
Straight buck wildin in the place to be
If you really wanna party with me...

In God we trust
Yo its a must that you heard of us yo we murderous
A lot of niggas is wonderin and they curious
How me and my niggas do it, it's so mysterious
Furious, all of my niggas is serious
Shook niggas be walkin around fearin us
Front nigga like you don't wanna be hearin us
Gotta listen to how radio be playin us
30 time a day shit'll make you delirious
Damagin everything all up in your areas
Yo its funny how all the chickens be always servin us
All up inbetween they ass where they wanna carry us
Hitcha good then I hit 'em off with the alias
Various, chickens they wanna marry us
Yo its Flipmode my nigga you know we 'bout to bust
Seven figure money the label preparin us
Bite the dust instead of you makin a fuss
Niggas know better cause there ain't no comparin us
Mad at us niggas is never we fabulous
Hit my people off with the flow that be marvelous
Oh shit my whole clique victorious
Takin no prisoners niggas is straight up warriors
While you feelin that I know you be feelin so glorious
Then I blitz and reminisce on my nigga Notorious

CHORUS
Do you really wanna party with me
Let me see just what you got for me
Put all your hands where my eyes can see
Straight buck wildin in the place to be
If you really wanna party with me
Let me see just what you got for me
Put all your hands where my eyes can see
Straight buck wildin in the place to be
If you really wanna party with me...
