Here we go!

[Verse 1]
Back with the most venomous rap
It be the Godfather of the club banger let me hear you clap
You can applause and from the very beginnin'
You can give me a standin' ovation
While I bang your face in
With another banger, I call it a cliffhanger
Watch me mangle and strangle this whole rap shit (Come on!)
You can see the way I make 'em mad sick
From down bottom, the way I got 'em; give me my cash quick (Come on!)
Lock on; you better grab onto somethin'
Because I'm 'bout to shake shit again and make a black bitch (Cum on!)
Now you hear the shots ring off
From bitches takin' everything off—each other
Got 'em wildin', runnin' for cover
The King Kong-Big Foot-gully-with-a-skully bully of rap
Still-ugly-with-the-money runnin' the trap
Now they givin' me dap, as far as I'm concerned in this mu'fucker
Look how I got 'em, now they ready to snap

[Hook]
So don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
It's gettin' hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw da water on 'em!)
Here we go!

[Verse 2]
Now you see the alcohol spillin'
And we got 'em hands in the ceilin'
You know we only come to rattle the bulidin'
And break it on down just a little, once again
Knowin' we holdin' the bank so let me keep the dice rollin'
And keep it traditional the way I keep my money fallin'
While you're slackin' on your MAC-in', Duke, we always keep it goin'
Right to the left, do it to death, now watch me
Come through with a chisel that make the game sizzle, and I—
Pull out the skillet, prepare for the cookin'
How I'm wildin'; niggas wonder when I'm gonna bring the hook in
Thug's ice grill in every time they get to lookin'
Got 'em wildin' overseas all the way back to "Go Brooklyn!"
Now they ready to spazz 'cause we bring the best to them
Shit that shut it down on the regular, that's with the—
Fly '80s nigga that was whippin' in a Cressida
Fresher than—most of these niggas, killin' the rest of the—
Fellas that was thinkin' they was rushin' in and bustin' in
But the way we was doin', we was musclin' they hustlin'

[Hook]
So don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
It's gettin' hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw da water on 'em!)
Here we go!

[Verse 3]
You don't really want it, my dude
I'm sayin' most my niggas is rude
And when we come, we eat a nigga' food
Back to the fact of the matter at hand
For me to come and control this whole shit was only part of the plan
The other part of the plan for you to understand:
That nothin' could fuck with the kid, let me say it again
The broad-backed, big Bus-a-Bus back to put out the trash
And just for the record, we got it on smash
Now, how the fuck they even got the audacity
The fire marshall come and try to talk about capacity
Every time I'm in the spot, I hope you know it has to be
Extremely packed to shut it down, you'll probably cause a tragedy
Don't you know that when I'm in the place I change the mood again
I be wildin' wit raunchy bitches and a bunch of hooligans
Now don't get it fucked up just because I flaunt it
Niggas think that they can test me, bring it if you really want it
See I be the type to always beat you to the punch faster
I keep a smile on my face, but carry the Bushmaster

[Hook]
So don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
It's gettin' hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw da water on 'em!)
Keep it goin'

[Verse 4]
You already know I said it word to mother
Shit is so hot you niggas think it's cold up in the summer
Shh, calm the noise down let's get a little quiet
Cause the neighbors call the police they know we cause riots
And they know that we'll have them thinkin' they dancin' with the devil
When they play the music turn the volume to the highest level
You got it right
Let's keep the bomb goin' like we lit a stick of dynamite
Bow, you know you need to follow whenever you hear the God spit
(Aw, shit)
You see me nigga back in the cockpit
Out to gettin' this money I give you all a stock tip
Perspire by a nigga till you see the sweat drop drip

[Hook]
So don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
It's gettin' hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw da water on 'em!)
Here we go!
