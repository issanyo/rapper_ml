[Intro]
Brand new, yeah, brand new
Ha, brand new for all y'all massive and crew
People across the world
Yeah, Busta Rhyme hot shit more and more and more
Motherfuker, Flipmode, nigga
More advanced technology for y'all niggas
Check it out y'all
Follow instructions

[Verse]
Hop, skip, jump, makin' ya flip
Dislocate your hip bone, vertebrate slip
Shut ya lip and talk shit, lost ya grip
On the realist thing in life, nigga, pass the clip
Makin' ya beg for your life, quickly strip
Oh shit, make you give me all of your belongings quick
Come up off of that ya get smacked, knock ya bitch back
Blow make ya go back to the way you use to act
Get money, fuck the bullshit, ain't nothin' funny
Nowadays violate quick, will ya face bloody
Freakshow have a nigga whole shit crisp
Break ya face from the swing of my hand, flick of my wrist
Dismiss all y'all niggas and ball up my fist
I hate a fake nigga and you at the top of the list
Wait, regardless how you skip around, the fact remains
You a bitch now learnin' how to play these games
Exercise the right to rip shit every night
Precisely, niggas be nicely doin' it right
Holy mackerel, nothin' less than actual factual
Stay reppin' even when we conversate casual
Read it in your manual
Attend to our annual get together
Serenade in luxury, doin' whatever
Doin' my thing, Trevade bumps King
Truck jeweling it, watch the medallion swing
So fast, nigga, forget shit as time past
Break a piece of glass, quick to amputate your ass
The title wave movin' faster than the speed of sound
Gargantua, weighing in at a million pounds
The more the heavy, the more the solid, my niggas run thick
Fast to bap the John type, my niggas murder you quick
Yo, take it easy while back at the ranch
You talk too much you get beat with a tree branch
The most influential, whether in projects or suburban residential, fuck that
We keep the livest niggas happy then we blow the spot quick
Give me money make it snappy
Oh my God, Flipmode is the Squidaud
It's war if you dare step foot in my yard
My protocol is to create
Substances abuse lyrics like alcohol
Nigga try to recall
When I hit you, you ain't even know that you was gon' fall
Cut your shit up, turned around and bumped your head and all
Leapin' lizard
Always remain grand wizard
Fuck around and sleep, nigga, you get caught up in my blizzard
Askin' who is it
My niggas ain't around, I ain't with it
Ayo, yo yo yo
We here to stay fuck payin' a visit
So consistent, demand everybody's assistant
Let us reach for all things without any resistance
Fatality, for all those in the world that might be mad at me
Suffer in the faces of my immortality
To the one who didn't make it

[Chorus]
Now in every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it
Now in every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it
Now in every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it
Take it....
