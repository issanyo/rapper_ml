[Intro]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Got some shit I gotta get off my chest one time, you know what I’m saying?
Yep

[Verse 1]
Didn't know I was wrong nigga
Till I hit the game like Malaysia plays at a loss nigga
Too fair with it you acting like your life hard nigga
Industry in trouble wanted down for this dame never that show niggas up
All through this streets, heavily involved with it I’m Mars pit it
Vertigo in the booth and I’m sharper than whoo
I snatch you a bitch and believe me never been neither
Homies got that knock team, the whole white that leave with the Bimmer
I need a breather, underachiever, my teacher said I’m a demon
Mom getting calls in the evening
Me with the mic, better do it and [?] keening
Granny had me dreaming the day she left me was really grieving
If Cade at number one I’m number two with it
Got to prove with it coward Die Hard nigga I’m Bruce Willis
I’m Dr. Seuss with a Roo head out the booth with I
Tell her if the shoe fits it’s ooh niggas through living

[Hook]
Ain’t nobody gon stop me
Put in work, I deserve my shine
All my life tryna block me
Hit the verse I’m a make my line
Kneeling down to the Lord every night that I pray
Hope he hear my cry
Kneeling down to the Lord every night that I pray
Hope he hear my cry

[Verse 2]
Motherfucker got a confession
I possess the God particle lock me up for possession
If a relationship with God should be grateful proper protection
Bitch I am the show and prove don’t need to ask me no question
Segregation well you should probably stay in the section
We ain’t repping the same you’ll eventually learn your lesson
Oh how quick you become a victim
As soon as you pelp the weapon
Like it woulda made a difference
If I know that you wish you had carried a weapon
The Lord hearing me crying I pray and beg you don’t push me
It’s different from the way you cry after we had to go hurt you pussy
Ya’ll make time to destroy him because I’m focused on building
Like the first brick that I stole from [?] and Flatbush
I do this shit for my children until I force em to forfeit
An incurable sickness that was quietly laying dormant
Then I flare up at anytime for niggas that think they important
The body in a box is the last image I leave in a portrait
Then glamor it motherfuckers

[Hook]
Ain’t nobody gon stop me
Put in work, I deserve my shine
All my life tryna bock me
Hit the verse I’m a make my line
Kneeling down to the Lord every night that I pray
Hope he hear my cry
Kneeling down to the Lord every night that I pray
Hope he hear my cry
Ain’t nobody gon stop me
All my life tryna block me
Hope he hear my cry
I pray hope he hear my cry
