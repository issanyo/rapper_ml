Jay Sean, Bus-a-Bus
YMCMB
Ain't no curfew law over here ,baby!

[Verse 1: Jay Sean]
Yo, you got me in a zone, I'm in a zone
You with your girls tell 'em come on, let's get it on
Let's pop some battles of Patron, Dom Pérignon
I know you wid it, that's alright
Cause I can tell it's gon' be one hell of a night
I'm in my car, I'm in my car
She said she meet me at the bar, she at the bar
The ViP is poppin' off, we fuckin' stars, YMCMB
Girl you know that when we do it girl
You know we do it right

[Pre-Hook: Jay Sean]
We runnin' from the AM to the AM
Treating every day like the weekend
And we gon' rock without no sleepin'
So tell a friend to tell a friend
That we ain't goin' home

[Hook: Jay Sean]
Till the early morn' (the early morn')
We be goin' on till the break of dawn (the break of dawn)
No, we ain't goin' home till the early morn' (early morn')
Keep it goin' on till the break of dawn (break of dawn)
Until the break of dawn
Until the—until the break of dawn

[Ad-Libs: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo Jay Sean let me take it from here homie!
Look

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Put it on me shawty while we keep them glasses up
Yes we in the party, bet that molly keep they asses up
She could hardly walk with a donkey ass, pass another cup
We could hardly talk when I watch her pass and I ain't even drunk
Playin' catch up then I snatch her up, "Let's get it on"
And try to pull it out right on the couch without no type of warning
Shawty keep it easy, baby girl let's keep the liquor pouring
Pacing and be patient, we gon' turn it up until the morning

[Pre-Hook: Jay Sean]
We runnin' from the AM to the AM
Treating every day like the weekend
And we gon' rock without no sleepin'
So tell a friend to tell a friend
That we ain't goin' home

[Hook: Jay Sean (R. City)]
Till the early morn' (we ain't goin' home)
We be goin' on till the break of dawn (until the break of dawn baby)
No, we ain't goin' home till the early morn' (yeah)
Keep it goin' on till the break of dawn (keep it goin' on till the break of dawn)
Until the break of dawn
Until the—until the break of dawn (until the break of dawn)

[Bridge: R. City]
You know we only got one lifetime
And I'm making the most of mine
I'm living a good life, I'm having a good time
I'm looking to go oh

[Hook: Jay Sean (R. City)]
We ain't goin' home till the early morn' (no)
We be goin' on till the break of dawn (on till the break of dawn)
No we ain't goin' home till the early morn' (until the early mornin')
Keep it goin' on till the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn
Until the—until the break of dawn
(We gon' keep it going on till the break of dawn
Till the break of dawn) Till the break of dawn
