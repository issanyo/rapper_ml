[Chorus: Rah Digga]
Flipmode the Imperial
You know you love it when you hear us on the radio
Go cop the joint and play the shit up in your stereo
Or in the streets up in your Jeeps or in the disco
And if you want the fly shit, my nigga here we go
You know it's Digga lookin pretty in the video
With Bus-a-Bus up in the cut but you don't hear me though
Just when you think we done we hit y'all we got plenty mo'
Blow!

[Verse 1: Rah Digga]
It be's the little mama, lip gloss and eyeliner
The only shit poppin like White Castle or the diner
Rah Digga make the joints that the DJs blast
Ghetto diva in the Source with the 3 page ad
Watch as the hood rat messiah climb swiftly
Labels scarred to death to let their artist bomb with me
Cause you can send your thuggest MC and watch me son 'em
The ruggedest bitch, don't even rhyme about gunnin
Got joints circulating like them old karate flicks
Buncha Rah Digga shirts on some big body chicks
Throw my shit in your hoopty or your luxury trucks
And make the quickest turn around like 'dro for 20 bucks
And I'll still be the greatest if this rap shit fail me
Back to jackin bootleg flicks from out the deli
Livin off the interest
Sippin on Tequila with my logo on the side of fuckin 18 wheelers

Chorus

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Ay yo yo yo
Raze and dazzle niggas like ya'll
Spray niggas like you and dismantle niggas like y'all
I got the thing that'll majorly handle niggas like y'all
Fight y'all, bust a semi and cancel niggas like y'all
I know some joke niggas who love to hassle niggas like y'all
Talk, and fix and simply dance on niggas like y'all
Trample niggas like y'all
Make examples outta niggas like y'all
Grit their teeth and cock the hammer up inside the dance hall
Thugs, here's another sample for niggas like ya'll
Or for the ones who pass and light a roman candle for niggas like y'all
Fight for niggas like y'all
Grad the mic from motherfuckers like y'all
Blow the spot in the night for all my niggas like y'all
My get high niggas, I blaze for niggas like y'all
Stink the spot up with 'dro now spray the fuckin Lysol
You know we be the ultimate
We fuckin with some other shit
And when we hit y'all
Yes, we sit and watch ya'll niggas ride the dick

Chorus

(Busta Rhymes)
A'yo, clap and slap up a nigga for talkin lotsa wack shit
While I roll around with the Harriet Thugman of this rap shit

(Rah Digga)
Black chick, with intellect, who wanna match wits?
Write my own rhymes so can't no nigga tell me jack shit

(Busta Rhymes)
Master shit, Flipmode exclusive across the map and shit
Presenting the first lady of the squad so give me dap and shit

(Rah Digga)
Sayin' peace when you see me, play the role like Ally Sheedy
And I ain't gon' join ya cipher if the weed's too seedy

(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, make sure you see what we doing now, put on your binoculars
Then I gas ya like a paid latino down at Banco Popular

(Rah Digga)
Rah Digga underground and gon' always blow the spot for ya
Longest runnin shit since the Phantom of the Opera

(Busta Rhymes)
Bus-a-Bus, going down as one of the greatest spoken philosophers
Holding a 12-shot semi with a little red dot for ya

(Rah Digga)
First and only female unmatched by anyone
Rip it from old school to the next millennium

Chorus
