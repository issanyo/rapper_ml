Danm near ten years ago i once said it and im still here

I get money money i got
I dont have a car i have a car lot
You dont have a car you just car hop
I want another car im bout to car shop
I needa figure out which car i dont got
The bentley the phantom i gott em in stock
Ferrari not i might as well cop
Deep dish rims lookin like pots
And im so fly i think i need a swat
And your so dumb you think i meant cops
Green diamonds lookin like snots
My time is money every tick every tock
Jim said mar ci ellados dont do gallados
Them doors dont go up so why would you buy those
Im just a city boy watchin for them pot holes
All about my mills yah them dolla dolla bills

-hook
Makin ya dance every chance i get
Hatas sayin danm do we ever catch bricks
All bout my dollas them dolla dolla bills

-red cafe

Dolla dolla bill 100 k every week
So the m-x blacker than tyrese

Dirty dolla bills see we get it laundered
Money we stormin cummin like a horny bitch
The brooklyn bullshit im on it biatch
Fall through they like aw what it do
My girl got a girl lil mama that what it do
I got powers like my first name austin
Stone cold like my last name austin
Got texas love like im straight from austin

-terrible hook not worth citing-

-busta

See its the best in this bitch now dont you see how they love me
Im finished with my vacation im back in the country
The god body in this rap shit is back trust me
With the stable i stock a broke bitch will fuck me
As the days pass money stretch longer for sure tho
Im about the dolla bill pay four pound in the euro
And when im out in switzerland just pay me in franks
Then im off to japan fuck with me go head and stack yen
Money so long you probobly would think its a miracle
Skyscraper cribs 360 degree preferial
Oh you ain't hear what i said what its worth
With a view so ill you could see the curve in the earth
And while most niggas frontin braggin about their jet
Im masterminden ways to purchase the united states debt
I know this nigga crazy cause this shit proobbly sound funny
But when this deal done the whole fuckin country will owe me money

-hook
Makin ya dance every chance i get
Hatas sayin danm do we ever catch bricks
All bout my dollas them dolla dolla bills
