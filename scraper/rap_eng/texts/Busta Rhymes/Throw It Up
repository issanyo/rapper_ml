(feat. Ludacris & Lil Wayne)

[Busta Rhymes:]
Yea I'm back to drive you crazy with that hottest shit in the streets
No if's, and's, or maybe's
Errbody gather around from here to little Haiti
Cause it's Busta... (Luda)... and (Young Weezy Baby)
With Flip Mode and DTP, shit be gettin' ugly
Weezy tell 'em what you rep... (I represent Young Money)
Yea I know you got me homie... (Busta, Busta I got you)
Real Talk
(I'm goin' in)
Get 'em killaaa

[Lil Wayne:]
I'm about to blast off call it rocket science
Daddy fat stacks check my pocket science
And if ya wanna try it, c'mon and try it
You don't want beef, I'll put you on a diet
I'm comin' through ya house with them choppas firin'
And all adults die, leave the toddlers cryin'
I've been a soldier, never met private ryan
Hey welcome to the jungle, and I'm the lion
I'm dippin' in my coupe, with the top behind me
I'm not the president, but I see cops behind me
Well fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and they can not stop me
So I will be drivin' like Ricky Bobby
It's my perrogative like Whitney's Bobby
I'm skatin' on blades like Sidney Crosby (That's hot)
Sharper than a ginsu shawty
You not Beyonce, but I can get you body

[Chorus:]
Now you know what we about to do, we goin' full throttle
Niggas go and toss ya champagne, and throw a fuckin' bottle
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
(I got 'em... Ludaa)

[Ludacris:]
I throw it up like a cap and tassel
I got my rap diploma
I throw it up like the gangs in Southern California
I Got them burners on ya, I be lookin' at a Russian rouga
I be lookin' like a human torch
And I be lookin' like Freddy Krueger
So don't be sleepin' on me, this ain't a fuckin' dream
I pass the rock to these jays like I'm on they fuckin' team
But I ain't slagin' dope, I slang Luda-vision
Hip-Hop's God in these jeans, now that's true religion
You couldn't fill my shoes, You couldn't fill my jockey
My niggas fight over ice like we been playin' hockey
I hope you get the goal, I hope you get the point
I'm on a roll with this paper, I hope you get the joint
I hope you fire it up, I hope it burn slow
I welcome chicks to my nest, I let these birds know
And eagles fly alone, so I'm about to take flight
And throw it up like ya girl's dress on prom night

[Chorus:]
Now you know what we about to do, we goin' full throttle
Niggas go and toss ya champagne, and throw a fuckin' bottle
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)

[Busta Rhymes:]
When I spit, niggas be askin' "Who dat"
It be the god
And I know you niggas really wonder know how the hell I "Do dat"
And the way that I come through
And kill every single thing when I rhyme
Nevermind, niggas can't compete when I spit and do the beat same time
(Bring the beat back)
My fans will leave ya fuckin' ass leakin'
For sayin' you nicer than me, hypothetically speakin'
Cool and Dre bring the fuckin' beat back for no reason
(Rewind It)
Niggas know my rap and know me for always beastin', Ok
When they see me they stutta, niggas know where I'm from
Scoo nu nu nu ba ba be, like the speakin' in tongue
I single-handedly move like a thousand niggas kick on
Trample niggas like a heard of hippo's (Nigga)
When I get hot I pop like oil, that's when they call me crisco(bitch)
I seek revenge like the count of monte cristo
Crack niggas like nabisco swallow a fifth for 'Sisco
A gangsta cat walkin territory wherever the piss go
Now that I'm pissy drunk, why the hell you wanna thug and holla
I'll change that and have you consider studyin' caballa (Shit)
They done named me Camala (Hey), cause I'm like the ugandan giant
Flatten niggas with my foot, who wanna try it

[Chorus:]
Now you know what we about to do, we goin' full throttle
Niggas go and toss ya champagne, and throw a fuckin' bottle
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)

When the game was gettin' weak, and everybody started winin'
And when the streets needed us, we came at the perfect time
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
