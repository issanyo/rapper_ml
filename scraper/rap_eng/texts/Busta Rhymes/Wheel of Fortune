[Verse One]
I hope you ready to march niggas
Hup two three four
Back with the gangsta of rap, retort
I hope somebody quickly call up a doctor go get a medic
Cause somebody 'bout get it, find the nearest exit
Oh shit nigga
Goin' insane muthafucka
'Bout to rupture ya cell membrane shit
The propane bitch
The fine cocaine lil' nigga
Type of shit that ya can't contain
I fill'em with octane
Light another fire nigga
'Til I'm high killa
Ignite another flame
Ah sorry I dig his talent well tie ya little lame, look
Okay, it don't matter cause I'm the one to blame
I'm startin' to act strange
Facin' every challange shit
Incredible hope
Lyrical amalgam bitch, oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'mma bang and oh ring everything like El DeBarge

[Hook]
Ooh, ooh and I like it, I like it

And so I say, and so I said
Excuse me dear, my gosh you look nice
Put ya money on her, better double the price
But let's get it niggas and jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, and let's jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, all my niggas jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, my ladies jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey

[Verse Two]
I'mma take off my jacket now

You see, I'm back on my bullshit
You tired lil' niggas gon' learn, watch how
The fire gon' burn, I'm shifting the climate, quiet
And if you wan' test what I'm on bitch
I wish a nigga try it, uh, uh, uh
I mentioned that I'm back to cause the riot (got drugs)
And I come to supply it
Hu, hu you niggas on a diet
You can't stop it
When I drop, ya know, ya can't deny it
My home, boy, you know that I'm a cook and I'mma fry it
While I'm counting this money and I hide it
I'm taking it back puttin' ya hands where my eyes can see
You get to puttin' yo eyes on me
Look how I drop shit
I got hits, I won't quit
I bet you see I'm back in the cockpit
I'm coming back like I'm doing the drucks
Everybody gather around and get ya to singin' the hook

[Hook]
Ooh, ooh and I like it, I like it

And so I say, and so I said
Excuse me dear, my gosh you look nice
Put ya money on her, better double the price
But let's get it niggas and jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, and let's jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, all my niggas jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, my ladies jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
