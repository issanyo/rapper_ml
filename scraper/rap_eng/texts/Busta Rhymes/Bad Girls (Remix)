[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Turn my mic up
Yeah, Yeah
Check it out
(Ugh)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas know who be the waviest
Fuck y'all niggas up again just like Giants did the Patriots
Everybody know I be the craziest, but it down sicker than a crazy bitch
Y'all niggas don't want no problems, boy, you don't really really want to play with this
Bussa Bus, M.I.A, when I'm in the building, niggas get to M.I.A
I get their women playing with some other women, then they get to looking at a nigga as if "Am I Gay?"
"Yes you is, shorty"; then I stay, partying with little mami bend okay
You want to enjoy a little when I play, fuck it up and cause a little anarchy
Shhh, hold up, mami wait a minute, I know you love it when I call
Black boy, I'm in the place, look here, know you love it when I ball
Know I'm winning here around this bitch, got my hand up on the turn-on switch
Life is good every day and I'm rich, YMCMB, Conglomerate

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

[Refrain: M.I.A.]
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang
Ah

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
It's getting hot in this bitch, hhorty, please hold my jacket
Funny how baby girl well, bad girl come, hold my ratchet
Give me that back, can't play with it, I'mma finish everything and put them all in a casket
Finished with the club, take shorty back to the crib, when I'm done with her, she'll be calling me "bastard"
Now let me give you the magic, y'all niggas must like getting your ass kicked
You think you're playing with fire? Nah nigga, y'all playing with acid
Face it, see the spaceship just landed, got a nigga wilding like Animal Planet
You don't want a violationâ€”it's a hazard, y'all still struggling to meet the standard
See, this shit is a habit, attract bad bitches like I'm really a magnet
Wack niggas, instead of swallowing a pill, y'all niggas really need to swallow a tablet
Until they really come get me, shut shit down, never go against me
Y'all already know a nigga gotta move with a bad girl, shorty ride shotgun with me

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

[Refrain: M.I.A.]
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang
Ah
