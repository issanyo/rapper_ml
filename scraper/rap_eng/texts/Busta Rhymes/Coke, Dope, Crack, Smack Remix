Remix!
E! E!

[Verse 1: J-Doe]
Since this the remix, remix
I'mma have to do it Like it's never been done
I'mma have to kill it like it's never been one
Niggas that was spittin didn't get enough attention
Like, I do and I move it however the fuck I want to and
Niggas try to stop me, try to block me
Then I'm probably gonna give it to em quicker
Than a Kawasaki. Moving top speed - ow!
I'm Chris Brown: nigga, look at me now
Came from the muthafuckin bottom to the top
Now I rain on them niggas that was hating on the block
I'm the same lil nigga, that was tryna get a drop
Now the Range got the bitches goin crazy as fuck
Like "Ow look at that nigga J-Doe
Sing that song coke, dope" LEGGO

[Chorus]
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
Remix!
E! E! E! E!
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas already know what I be doing when I
Be getting on these records and be fucking up
Everything, I be bruckin up everything
And be shutting up everything and every other nigga dead
The way I come and I kill and I give em CRACK
And then I make em DUMB, hit em with the BAP
And then I make a nigga run, then I give em drugs
Kill another track, yeah I know, yeah I know, it ain't fair
Alright, alright, I'mma chill
Fuck that I lied bitch! B-b-b-busta bout to
D-d-d-d-do it and y-y-ya know that I'm b-b-b-back
They say that I'm the nicest and I'm hoping you know it's the fact
That nigga flow priceless!
Them niggas don't know how to act, whenever I get up on the beat
You know I'm coming for your food, because you know I gotta eat
And it ain't nothing you can do because I'm running through the street
And when I step up in the building, know I'm coming with the heat
Cause I got that:

[Chorus]
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
E! E! E! E!
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
E! E! E! E!

[David Banner]
Dope like riding on I-10
95 dope, blowing kush in the wind
With a cup full of Gin
Your bitch and her friend, You only see her top
Over here on my bed. Slap it in her face you know what I'm talking about
Pacquiao on the pussy I'mma knock it out
Wanna get through nigga, we could swap it out
Talk shit, get a cock blocked in your mouth
I admit that yo Bitch a dime, but I'm all in her mouth like a braces line
The girl love the way that the dick go down
*Car beep* That's her, I'ma dick her now
I go to ya spot, ha-hard as a rock
Walk in homeboy I got a key, I never knock
She called me Uncle Luke cause I make her pussy pop
You stay in the trap but I live in her mouth..

[Chorus]
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
E! E! E! E!
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
E! E! E! E!

[T Pain]
Aye gimme that coke/dope/crack/smack
Put the dick on the track and I hit it from the back
And all the muthafuckas acting like they don't know how to act
Until I pull up in the Cadillac, sharp with a Mac in my lap- laugh at that
Ain't too much funny, yes I'm gettin to the money
Bitch and if a nigga want it, then I guess a nigga running
I can show how I be running shit
And niggas know I'm on that shit
3 or 4 of them ladies up in my hummer shit
(Coke Coke Coke) now go (Coke Coke dope dope)
Is he fuckin with T-Pizzle Nope, nope, nope, nope
Never drop ball like its soap on a rope (rope)
Niggas can't cope so they take another toke (toke)
Somebody better come and tell these muthafuckas that
I never gave a fuck about a jealous muthafucka
But if somebody smell a muthafuckin rat, then
Go and tell his ass Teddy Pizzle be spittin that

[Chorus]
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
E! E! E! E!
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
E! E! E! E!
