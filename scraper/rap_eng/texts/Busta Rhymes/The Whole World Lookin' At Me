[Chorus]
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see (yo)
If I fulfill (yo), my destiny (yo, yo, yo)
The whole (yo), world lookin' at me (yo, I feel so imperial)
Watchin' and waitin' to see
If I fulfill (yo, I feel, reignin') my destiny (hahaha)
The whole (yo), world lookin' at me (yo, I feel so supreme)
Watchin' and waitin' to see
If I fulfill (haha), my destiny (hahahahaha)
The whole world (I feel so good), lookin' at me

[Verse 1]
Uh, my interruption, cause a major concussion
Dome piece swollen, son you need a cup of Bufferin'
Peep my post-production, (Hey!), follow my instruction
Bounce back, my repercussion cause mass destruction
Fuck around strain ya, 'til ya plan malfunction
Sit cha ass down, (Hey!), bouncin' out ta Flushin (Queens, NYC)
Check extra P, by the boom weed, from a Russian
I remember, when I used ta rhyme, for next to nothin'
I got so much ta offer, every time I tell you somethin'
(Hey!) I'm about ta drop it! (Who?) you could never stop it
Let me quickly chop it, still, a lot of niggas -
Idolize the false prophet, the rhyming Lou Gossett
Hold your head and shoulders, yo I roll with evil holders
Dealin with the facts, I hold the science in the folders
The jewel, on how to knock you from concussion, into comas
Test shit, I pull your valve from out your breast kid
Mess with, shit like this, after God blessed it

[Chorus]
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see (I feel so supreme)
If I fulfill my destiny (I feel so good)
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see (we gotta keep it alive)
If I fulfill my destiny (we gotta keep it alive)

[Verse 2]
The whole world lookin' at me
Uh, I'm bout to cause chaos, steady bustin ya bra's
Switch to witch craft, my chemistry witcha s√©ance
Fuck the bullshit, livin' in the zone of my renaissance
My squad stay formin', like the Muslims down at the Mosque
Split ya fuckin frame, like we raisin splittin' cigars
I be workin' wonders, my squad formin' numbers
Christopher Columbus? Discover how yo' speed
Got swell up like cucumbers, my name be rollin' thunders
My degrees multiply the heat, more this summer
My flows got so much rhythm, substitute the drummer
Yo fuck that, focusin' about the front runner
Who you think you is? You better stay protected -
Walkin' out the door, makin' sure you rock the double breasted
Fuckin' with them devils, watch your soul get recollected
Motherfuckin' shame when you (DIE!) disrespected
Every bitch nigga in the world, should be arrested
Beat with many strikes, until their train of thought is redirected
The wrong has been corrected, (GOD!) has been elected
The squad has come to rule us, with the jewels manifested
Extreme, my thought process on every record
Blow the spots to pieces bounce, without a clue right through the exit

[Chorus]
The whole world lookin' at me (yeah, I feel so good)
Watchin' and waitin' to see
If I fulfill my destiny (I feel so supreme)
The whole world lookin' at me (imperial)
Watchin' and waitin' to see
If I fulfill my destiny (I feel so supreme)
The whole world lookin' at me (imperial)
Watchin' and waitin' to see
If I fulfill my destiny (I feel so high)
The whole world lookin' at me (so high in the sky)
Watchin' and waitin' to see
If I fulfill my destiny (we on some other shit)
The whole world lookin' at me (some other shit)
Watchin' and waitin' to see  (so supreme)
If I fulfill my destiny (higher level stuff)
The whole world lookin' at me
Take a look, take a look at me, ha
