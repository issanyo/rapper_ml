Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Bitch nigga
Lemme show y'all what I’m great at
East Side Long Beach, nigga where they say that?
Spray that, old school just like an ADAT
Doggie where you weigh that, homie don’t play that
More fresh powder
Scram, blood, blam on your clam chowder
Easy easy deezy show you how to
Flip a brick in half, stuff it in the chicken bag
Another hundred million smiling with my crippin' ass
Rock it up and go, I let it marinate
I came back to the city, just to share the cake
Lil' homies ready, y'all lock and load
Beast city in the crippin' kitchen

Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
1989, when I was on the grind getting mine
6-1 block, East Side was the line
I had to have heart, nigga couldn’t punk out
You was training boys in the hood, nigga you jumped out
Scary ass busta, I get money with the hustlas
The Rugers, the main streets, the 6-0’s, the 8 Trey Gangstas
Popped at Piru’s and I cruise and I choose cause I paid my dues
Squeezing on these foo’s, but back to the money cause my homie need a new pair of shoes
Point made, close call
This is the life and time of the homie big Snoop Dogg

Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
So much weight up in the bag that when you carry it, it break a shoulder
Bitch I put the cocaina back in Coca cola
Local distribution best make sure you grab the cargo’s
It’s Godfather Busta Remo, it’s General Nargos
I stash this money and coka in congos
I even ship the coke in instruments, stuff ‘em in bongos
We getting money like out of this cosmos
Pushing white down the 405 like OJ in the Bronco
We getting money, purchase diamonds straight out of the Congo
From cutting coke with my Colombian connect Alonzo
Pass the weed and let me roll a fronto
Bitch just brush this powder off my clothes and do it pronto
