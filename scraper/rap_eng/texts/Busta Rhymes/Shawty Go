[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm high as fuck and I'm gone on one

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Busta Rhymes]
I'm high as fuck and I'm gone on one
On second cup and I'm blowin' on one
Table full of bads, so I throw more ones
Sit back and I watch that ass go dumb
Throwin money in the air, like shawty go
Throwin money in the air, like shawty go
Throwin money in the air, like shawty go
Throwin money in the air, like shawty go

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Got so much money, make a broke nigga disappear, ...pere
Live niggas to the front
Bitch niggas need to step to the rear, rear
Well its the god in this bitch and I'm so sincere, ...cere
And the way I take a niggas shine, sorry, it's so unfere, ...fere
Warning, see the way the bitches catch a tantrum
Money spilling and I'm pouring
Turn Up niggas know the action
See the way a nigga scoring
A lotta money lef' up in the mansion
Come back to the crib
Cause I snow blow'a money
And I do it with a passion

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Busta Rhymes]
