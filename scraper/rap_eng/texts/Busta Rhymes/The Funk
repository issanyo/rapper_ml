[Intro: Nate Dogg]
Black Cadillac, on vogues
Sittin' back thinkin'
Thing ain't the same no mo'
We want Biggie
Big up to the east-coast Brooklyn don
Heads still bouncin'
Tell the DJ what we want (Biggie Smalls! Uh)
We want Biggie

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore
Appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one
Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know (let 'em know!)
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking funk by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
When they ask us what we want (the funk)
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
Live and die for the funk
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?

[Verse 2: Redman]
Aw, it's nothing but funk in this motherfucker here!
Ayo, it's Redman dog, you know the deal
I'm watching New Jack City in my steering wheel
Man I love for the funk, I'll kill that wheel
Nigga fucking large I'm in the NFL
Killer, the man on fire like Denzel
I rock steady, my heat'll make your wind-mill
That's real, dot, R-A-W, straight out my mother womb
Right to the rubber room, I'm psycho, automatics
Since a younging, blowing funk boosts with half-sticks
I ain't give a fuck, now I'm trying to own a mountain
Standing on it yelling "regular!"
B. Smalls, Nate Dogg on the same beat
We fuck hoes, send 'em home like the Yankees
Brick City, yeah nigga, a threat
That's how I act when Bad Boy cut Killa a check
Yep, haha

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
When they ask us what we want (the funk)
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
Live and die for the funk
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Real talk, nigga, Flip Mode Squad's in the building
Put your ones up, tribute the god, look
All gathered around, bounce to the funk
Got the whole club stink with the aroma of the skunk
Now, bang it out the trunk, nigga, ain't nothing change
Rep Big in a horde, like he still on St. James
Check it, nigga gon' see why we try
We continue to rep the funk in the name of the god B.I
Get dressed, mamis try to step up in the spotlight
We honoring one of the greatest,  yes we gotta rep him right
Homie I ain't done, let me keep giving you funk shit
Busta Bust does just what he do, now let me run shit
Yeah, peep heat we bringin', rep the funk to the fullest
Still, keep we keep drillin', niggas all up in they head
'Cause I said we always will, and
Put it down for Big-Heavy, still B.K. swinging
The funk, baby

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
When they ask us what we want (the funk)
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
Live and die for the funk
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
