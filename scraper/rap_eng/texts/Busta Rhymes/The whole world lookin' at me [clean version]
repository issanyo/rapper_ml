The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
Uh, my interruption cause a major concussion
Dome piece swollen, Son you need a cup of bufferin'
Peep my post reduction, hey
Follow my instruction
Bounce back my repercussion
Cause mass destruction
Fuck around strain ya till ya plan malfunction
Sit cha ass down, hey
Bouncin' out ta flushin'
Check extra P by the boom weed from a Russian
I remember, when I used ta rhyme for extra nothin'
I got so much ta offer every time, I tell you somethin'
I'm about to drop it, you could never stop it
Let me quickly chop it
Still a lot of niggas analyze before profits
The rhyme at new gossip
Hold your head and shoulders, yo I roll with evil holders
Dealin' with the facts, I hold the silence in the folders
Did you know how to knock it from concussion into comas?
Test shit, I pull your valve from out your breast kid
Mess with, shit like this after God blessed it
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
Uh, I'm about to cause chaos steady bustin' ya bras
Which to witch craft, my chemistry what ya say os
Fuck the bullshit
Livin' in the zone of my renaissance
My squad stay formin' like the Muslims down in Dames
Split ya fuckin' frame like we raisin' splittin' cigars
I be workin' wonders, my squad formin numbers
Christopher Columbus
Discover how you speed out swellin' like you cumbus
My name be rollin' thunders
My degrees multiply the heat, more this summer
My flows got so much rhythm, substitute the drummer
Yo fuck that, focusin' about the front runner
Who you think you is? You better stay protected
Walkin' out the door, makin' sure you rock the double breast kid
Fuckin' with them devils, watch your soul get recollected
Mutherfuckin shame, when you die disrespected
Every bitch nigga in the world should be arrested
Beat with many strikes until their train of thought is redirected
The world has been corrected, God has been elected
The squad has come to rule us with the jewels manifested
Extreme my thought process on every record
Blow the spots to pieces bounce without a clue right through the exit
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
Watchin' and waitin' to see, if I fulfill my destiny
The whole world lookin' at me
