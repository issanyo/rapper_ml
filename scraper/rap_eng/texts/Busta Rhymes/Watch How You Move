[Chorus: Yummy Bingham & Busta Rhymes]
These streets is watchin' the way you move
(Watch how you move nigga)
So be careful in all that you do
(Watch what you doin' nigga)
If you shittin' where you eat it might cause you trouble
And this ain't nothing that I've heard
Only what I've learned
Mark my words
So please don't sleep
(Don't you do that)
Or the wolves come to eat
(Them niggas hungry)
And they sniff you out
And make you a target
Boy better run for cover
(Run for cover nigga)
Are you hearin' what I'm sayin?
Cause you know them boys ain't playin'
When that thing go "POP!"
Better hope it ain't for you

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, early to rise
As I'm recollectin'
I'm cookin'
That thing up for breakfast
One of my sons'll
Go get the paper
While I'm robed up
Louis house slippers
Nasty stocking cap on
Smoking a [?] while I plot on another caper
Respectively, see I've been genetically blessed
To move like I'm a G-F
Designer cigars and pinky rings
Ain't no question how we move on bigger things
On the patio speakin' of old connecs
My Dominican/Puerto Ricans
Pablo Augustus and Miguel Filejo
They be speakin' with strong accents
And have they soldiers shoot you, pendejo
Re-aligning the link after the convo
Gettin' back to it fast
Compadres papered up
Probly floodin' my stash
Booty-makin bitches be countin' my cash
Walk around wearin' nuttin'
Diesel as fuck
Cellulite dimples in they ass
Peep the way how I prosper
And I prophet
Gettin' cook and then grindin' it up
While I make sure these niggas ain't try'na line me up
(Gone!)

[Chorus: Yummy Bingham & Busta Rhymes]
These streets is watchin' the way you move
(Watch how you move nigga)
So be careful in all that you do
(Watch what you doin' nigga)
If you shittin' where you eat it might cause you trouble
And this ain't nothing that I've heard
Only what I've learned
Mark my words
So please don't sleep
(Don't you do that)
Or the wolves come to eat
(Them niggas hungry)
And they sniff you out
And make you a target
Boy better run for cover
(Run for cover nigga)
Are you hearin' what I'm sayin?
Cause you know them boys ain't playin'
When that thing go "POP!"
Better hope it ain't for you

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, I think this moment's lookin' spectacular
Very eventful and special
Detail, in-particulars is essential
Emaculate from the talk to the dress-up
All the way down to the coke in the kitchen
Shallah, please do the cheffin' stuff!
[The sound of bottles breaking shifts the beat from hip-hop to minor-key, organ beat]

[Chef's Special: Raekwon]
"Yo, what the fuck happened?
Yo, slap him
Yo Rhymes, put the mac in his mouth"
I slipped, "No you di'int
This nigga is slippin'"
Different nigga from the kid we used to fuckin' wit'
I'm out in [?]
And this coke's frozen
Nigga, suck a dick
Bust' popped him
Shot him in his wind pipe
I stabbed him in his hand
Bust' shot him again
Six million grams in the sink
Down the drain
I'm to blame
We the [?]
Got to call the connect up
"Papicito, catch the train now!"
It's war in the world
We both riders
They comin' in gliders
Hear the wings pull up
We wool up
Bullet-proof boxers and socks
Two twin choppers, the Glocks
Was 30-shot; new joints.  We both toxed
Then he walked in... leather 'n chucks
Old sneakers from the 80's
A crazy, my columbian pops
This is a wild caper
Fresh off the block
To the yachts

[Beat fades out]
