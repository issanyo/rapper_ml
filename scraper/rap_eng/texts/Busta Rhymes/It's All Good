[Intro]
Let me talk to you
Let me talk to you, baby
I've got some shit to share with your freaky ass, ha

[Verse 1]
I like the way you freak it, baby, I love your style
The way you stick your tongue in my mouth and act wild
The way you give me them little fights and little tussles
Bite the back of your neck, weaken your leg muscles
The type of chick who always want to take it there
She don't care, ready to fuck anywhere
Make a nigga want to bust 'til my legs cripple
Put your breasts in my face, tell me bite the nipples
You got me breathing hard, the whole shit
Kiss me on the chest, my belly button
Baby, start to kiss the whole dick
Strap you up, one time
Slap your ass up, two time
And watch you jingle
I love the way your whole ass wiggle
The way she turning me on and make my little freak wanna giggle
Before the dick paid the pussy a visit
Grabbed the pussy from the back a stuck my fingers all in it

[Chorus]
Have you ever went over your freak's house to chill
And the both of you understood
That y'all could chill with the talking 'cause y'all were straight fucking
And for both of y'all, it's all good
Sometimes you try to play it off but you know you can't
Now a nigga dick hard like wood
You tried the macaroni-salad-the-sweet-pussy-delight
I'ma fuck it every time I could

[Verse 2]
My freak start stripping
I take a closer look, her pussy dripping
Flipping, you know I ain't tripping
Got my heart skipping, anticipating the fun
Baby, kiss the dick one more time and start the dick suck
I like the way you lick it, the way you suck it
The way you tell me you want the right dick to fuck it
The dick rest upon the pussy hair like wool
Grab my ass and pull, say you want your pussy whole full
Now talk the dirty shit, I like it like that
The way you swing your waist and throw all the pussy back
Baby got me all in the pussy, I ain't joking
She turning round, bending over, spreading her ass wide open
Oh yes, so I can get all in
She say she like the way the dick make the pussy feel from deep within
And when it slip out, she stick it back in
I love her just the way she is and how handle her biz

[Chorus]
Have you ever went over your freak's house to chill
And the both of you understood
That y'all could chill with the talking 'cause y'all were straight fucking
And for both of y'all, it's all good
Sometimes you try to play it off but you know you can't
Now a nigga dick hard like wood
You tried the macaroni-salad-the-sweet-pussy-delight
I'ma fuck it every time I could
Have you ever went over your freak's house to chill
And the both of you understood
That y'all could chill with the talking 'cause y'all were straight fucking
And for both of y'all, it's all good
Sometimes you try to play it off but you know you can't
Now a nigga dick hard like wood
You tried the macaroni-salad-the-sweet-pussy-delight
I'ma fuck it every time I could
