[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Just make sure them, them drums is smackin
This, means, WAR!!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I work hard to take care of every one of my niggas
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggas
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
Disloyal motherfuckers I'mma BANISH you all
And celebrate all in your absence once I get rid of y'all
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye!
So you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed!
Make you eternally suffer, you was one of my mens
Turn your back on me, and I'mma make sure you get it back times ten
Stay TRUE -- now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
If you ain't wit me I'mma throw you WAY over the edge
THIS MEANS WAR!!

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
As I cherish every blessing and I greet you with hugs
You my peoples when I see you I embrace you with love
Yeah I be the one to come and get you out of the hole
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama!
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, sheddin a tear
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
And have to go to war with FAKE niggas standin alone
Until I get with all my loyal niggas goin the length
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength!
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggas, breakin the bread
And if you diss the code of honor we takin your head;
THIS MEANS WAR!!

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
Nobody helps them
Now he has his revenge

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Whatchu gon' do? Whatchu gonna do?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!!
I'mma BE the best to show love let's co-operate
Disloyalty is somethin that we won't tolerate
Deal with these niggas, let's put them where they properly go
On the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know
So long fightin the bullshit for so many years
Watchin the danger and niggas double crossin they peers
Yes I always fight for what is right and put my foot down
Disrespect my love, I'mma be LAYIN YOU DOWN
THIS MEANS WAR!

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
