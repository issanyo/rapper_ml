Fool, fool boy you must fe wan't die
Anyhow you try disrespect King Selassie
Bruk two ah yuh foot and tab yuh in ah yuh eye
Wit proper information bout rastafarai
Make sure you read bible and salute the most high
The ones who don't know be the ones who ask why

Allow'll real get the colour blue in ah the sky
Why after you feed the youth the baby still ah cry
You need Ja, in ah yuh life, me nah to yuh no lie

We done uniform you know it's straight mulitply
Straight multiply, know it's straight multiply

(Bob Marley)

Ay, yo, Spliff where you at?

(Spliff Starr)
I hold my glass up high, and I toast to the most high
Since my B-day up to this day is close by
Watchin over me, while Babylon scopin me
From my mother's womb they took my mind started mouldin me
Like Mookie on the crock I heard the devil callin me
By the powers of Ja, he took the devils off of me
I can see clearly now, I'm stepping with authority
God blessed you, I got the whole world supportin me
Ja, is my friend different from the enemy them
I talks to him shoutin out lookin up to heaven
Gave me a call he said I want you tell them all
That you shall witness when Babylon fall
All you shall witness when Babylon fall
All you shall witness when Bablyon fall

(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah
Street chronicle for the evening
