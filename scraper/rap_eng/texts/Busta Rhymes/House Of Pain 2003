[Verse 1: 2Pac]
The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses is to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AKs headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skin headed bitches let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the house of pain

[Hook:]
House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Huh, the country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the 8-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots
Niggas dropped quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain

[Hook:]
House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, yeah, check it
Niggas talking about doing this and doing that
Fucking mouth bigger than the fattest bitch's ass-crack
Add and subtract on minus faggots
Groupies bring the violence to maggots
I'll silence you bastards and then I
Embarrass and disrespect niggas, shameful
Cut the convo short and keep the beating painful
Finger hugging a trigger like a pussy I'm fingerin'
Shots to you 'till I see them teardrops tricklin'
You fuckin' with a grown man and you ain't half-grown
Or half-known, you faggot, I'll shoot you all in your calf bone
What you get in it for? I'll have you niggas sitting down
Front and walk with a bop, I'll make you niggas limp around
In case you didn't know I'm still a hungry rich nigga
Chop faggots to pieces and eat a little bitch nigga
Dog's not appropriate for women and children
I spit your pieces out and hang them on the side of a building
Yeah, tie you up and make one of my bitches doo-doo on you
With your FUBU on you like I was performing voodoo on you
Heat rock while you just watch a nigga heat drop
Streets stop while I'm talking, and push you through a sheet rock
A whole lot of iron and cocked a lot of hammers
While I give you modes and principles, teaching you niggas manners
Oh yeah, y'all niggas know what's up? You know my name?
While I initiate you motherfuckers in the house of pain

[Hook:]
House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
Whoa, whoa
