[Shaheem Reid]
Yo what's going, this is Shaheem Reid
It's been an honor and a privilege to help bring you
Another Catastrophic mixtape, Catastrophic: Part 2
Another classic from the Conglomerate

And um, we got y'all man
You don't even gotta wait a long time
It's only gonna be a matter of a few weeks

O.T. Genasis is coming with that "Alarm" mixtape

J-Doe, he's dropping that "Her Name was Diamond" mixtape

And the general of the whole squad, Busta Rhymes, I ain't even gonna tell you what he got coming
It's something classic, just calm down
You hear that beat in the background
Calm down, the Conglomerate got y'all from the summer for next year, everything number of classic records, man

And speaking of classic records, I know you done heard the most monumental moment of the year
Two legends, two gladiators, coming together on one track
Busta Rhymes featuring Eminem: Calm Down
The record that everybody's talking about, available now, everywhere

Conglomerate, the label, the movement
