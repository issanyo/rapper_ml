[Intro]
Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

[Hook]
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout niggas!

[Verse 1]
Oh my lord, lower the casket down
Sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow!
Frown while I shit on your crown, skip town
Ground zero, shapiro the king cash cow
Do I make 'em say 'Wow!', strip, ow, bow
I sit with the pound, click, pow
Blow, click, click, pow, click, pow
Stop traffic dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start when I growl
(rawr, rawr, rawr) let me come and mop up the knock offs
When I pop off and never stop, cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (PAUSE)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lockjaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough, nigga, we got more

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Watch how the gasket blow
Will settle for landmine, blast from the door
Smash up, stick with a massive intro
Flammable fluid in the ‘gnac sip slow
Let me line up the fiend and pitch mo’
Oh, I’m sick and I’m thorough bitch, so?
Know when I switch to my focus, tip toe
Black, see I make ‘em act, skitzo
(Blap) Doing it until you get more
When they sick to they stomach need Pepto Bismol
We out here [?] cliques go
Beating up the street when I’m letting this bitch go
Eat a nigga’s food like I’m hungry and piss po'
‘Bout to fuck shit up while you letting this itch grow
We reppin’ every hood from the time that we start bombing it
Just in case you ain’t know, it’s the conglomerate

[Hook]
