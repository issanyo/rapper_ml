[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Gym Class Heroes. Cool and Dre
This is. You silly for this one
Whats wrong with me? Its Travie
Why you doing this to me? Ha ha

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
I started rappin, back of the class, scribbling tracks in hopes
That one of my jokes a have the pretty young things laughing
A chubby little bastard with a nack for little debbie snacks
But what I lacked in looks I made up for it in passion
No advance and plus we make it happen
And ya concious more obnoxious in that laffy taffy snappin
Goodbye yesterday's rags, hello high fashion
Years before you's a man, then built a castle with sand
With no regards for tidal waves I finally established
Til water comes in gallon drums and wipes away my palace
But now I'm sitting lovely off in wonderland with Alice
With purple people passing me at the caterpillars chalice
Ha ha, you probably thinking I'm wrong right
Like I should quit writing these songs right
Tell you what, do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike

[Bridge 1: Travie McCoy]
Don't let the tv mislead you, me and you dude we are not equal
Fuck you this is for my people, fuck you this is for my people
Don't try to hide like I can't see you
Your parents must a been trans you so see through
Fuck you this is for my people, fuck you this is for my people

[Hook: Travie McCoy]
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down

[Verse 2 :Busta Rhymes]
Before I utter words and before I start to begin
Let me make sure you clear I'm about securring the win
I puzzle up my words while I piece another concoction
Cause I'm stubborn with the thought that failure is never an option
I grinds like a carpenter til my calluses bleed
With the passion from my heart to the many mouths that I feed
That's why I look at most of you stupid I know its odd
Because you can't really do nothing to me unless you God
Well being that none of you ain't him
You can't fuck with me now watch me erase them
Now trust me see I'm so determined
I'm walking through the heap of gauntlets how the fire was burning
Or how the tire was turning on the rim of the V
I laugh and shake it off the shit they be doing to me
With all the yappin and talking and so and so
You think that you could ever stop the kid OH NO

[Bridge 2: Busta Rhymes]
So if you get in my way, you know you done son
You best believe what I say, you better run son
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
You better kneel down and pray, cause where I come from
We going hard everyday, that's how the fights won
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Look mom no hands (no hands)
Your little boys a man (god damn)
Everything you said is finally setting in
The training wheels fell off and I kept pedaling
Now I'm riding wheelies on this industry
Say the word and I'll ghost ride this bitch instantly
Good looking pop all the strength that you giving me
Wasn't for you GymClass would be history
I'm on my upstate shit
I was Brooklyn broke but now I'm upstate rich
Getting brain from two dames with french accents
I don't mess with local chicks I get em upstate shipped
Ha, you probably thinking I'm wrong right
Like I should quit writing these song right
Tell you what, do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike

[Bridge 3: Travie McCoy]
Now its a lot of y'all that can't stand me
Cause my resemblance to Prince is uncanny
But fuck you this is for my family, fuck you this is for my family
Upstate New York to Miami, Up late recording in my jamies
I do it for my family, fuck you this is for my family

[Extended Hook: Travie McCoy]
