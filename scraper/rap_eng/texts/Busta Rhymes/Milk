To rip apart all clicks that got heart
Make em talk into my boot like Maxwell Smart
And I send clicks that try to diss me
(To the motherfuckin East Blackwards) like X-Clan you SISSY!
Bust up the jam and feel no guilt
And that's why motherfuckers call me Milk

Who Zee? Me I put the crews in the floozy
Do em like Jackson, sweep em up by the twozies
No brain Brings the Pain like Tical
When I get buckwild and move my dial on your style
You kick the Mafia "can't be hit" stories
While I get your main {*censored*} the {**} bores me

I'ma beat the streets crossin out they shit like Spitz

Booty-ass rappers like you bring my high down
So when I rock give me props and hugs

Then watch a whole damn click get kilt
Lyrically by the nigga they be callin Milk
