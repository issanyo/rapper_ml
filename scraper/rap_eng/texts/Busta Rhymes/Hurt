[Intro]
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
You pussy niggas finna make me kill one a y'all

[Hook: T.I.]
Ain't a damn thang change
I still keep that thang right up under my shirt
Betta tell 'em I ain't playin'
Because it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt
Ain't a damn thang change
I still keep that thang right up under my shirt
Run up on him where he hang and BANG!
Cause it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Alota pussy niggas talk like broads love runnin' they mouth
That is til I run in they house
Put the gun in they mouth, tell 'em "Nigga talk shit now"
You'd think they know the gun go BOW!
I ain't scared of the law
Naw I'm about to go to war what it is nigga win lose or draw
I'll never get caught murkin' y'all cuz it ain't what you do
The question is: Who saw?
Shawty I'm way too raw
Catch me any day you want you could think I'm a play if you want
But the fact still remain if I got a AK and you don't
Well then playa you gone
Don't get me wrong there's some niggas wanna kill me too (Well where they at?)
But this ain't bout shit cause it's well known where I'm at
They could catch me in the booth right now if you really like that
Naw nigga let they ho get him in the whole shit, the 44 spit they holla "Oh shit!"
Protectin' her and you both hit
You betta check ya girl cause you be so sick
If the choppa leave you with no dick
Or a plastic bag holdin' yo' shit
Leave 6 in you, a couple more in ya bitch
And I don't miss cause I'm focused nigga

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 2: Alfa Mega]
(I got you Tip)
(I'm finna ride homie)
Fuck niggas might talk loud, act real, but they don't really want this here
Pussy niggas betta act right, lay low, we know where ya family live
Trust me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duck tapin' ya kids
You can pray all you want but I don't forgive
Ya shoulda been doin' that before ya did whatcha did
I ain't gotta spell it out pimp you know what it is
I'll rest you case for ya real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons with me, dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got K's, half got Macs
Bring 'em out, bring em out, show me where he at
We can do him right here, we could catch him in trap
Run up on his 'lac put a hole in his hat
With his brain on the dash, and his thoughts in his lap
And dump 50 more on him and tell him to hold that
Lights out, no hasta mañana, hasta la vista, sayonara
Y tú no tomorrow, no remorse and no sorrow
And the next one a y'all niggas try me like that
I swear to God man I'm really gon' snap

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Right now I'mma give you somethin' that a make a nigga beg "Please"
When a bullet wiz by, he'll probably feel a little breeze
Drop to ya knees, see the big barrel of the chrome
Fifth triple grip handles in the squeeze
I keep a couple of those for the niggas who talk shit
When I go to Jacob and cop that ring
If you try to see me I'mma cock that thang
And I'mma pop that thang, and the shots gon' sting (really?)
The nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga stuck with me
And tell you somethin' if you really were smart and you knew
Better people probably tell ya don't fuck with me
Front if want motherfucka you can catch it
Smile on my face even though I got a ratchet
Pop off (police) pull me over believe I got a compartment if I gotta stash it
Must I just remind y'all niggas when I come through
Know that I'mma find y'all niggas, take two (break through)
Bust so many shots gun powder probably blind y'all niggas now (Okay, okay let's go)
See you don't know really wanna feel that Mossberg blow (naw)
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga
When I finish it'll turn into an absurd show (listen)
Then you better observe yo
Feel the sizzle from the bullet of the Glock burn slow (ssss)
Shit'll probably twist you up just a little and have your body leanin' lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down betta (lay down)
Checkin' for a nigga, come and put your body in the dirt
I don't play bitch, you really need to go the other way
If you ain't know I got it under my shirt

[Hook: T.I.]
