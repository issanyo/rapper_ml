[Hook: Meyhem Lauren](x2)
Doin' a 100 on a highway
Fast cake, I do it my way
Fast cake, I do it my way
Head to toe labels on deck, do it the fly way

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Predatory glory feastin' on endangered species
I take a shit right after birth a million dollar feces
Fuck ya habitat, it's really where your ratchet at
My ego is so lethal that a ? will try to damage that
So Queens that you can feel me
So dope that you could deal me
Do a donut then I hop up out the Benz
Still in the hood like ATM's that give tens
Crime infused paragraphs with expensive pens
Now we chasin' ends my niggas need extensive ends
Refined thug salary, fine rug gallery
Purchase courtesy of the street, real niggas proud of me
Strategize always think wise but never cowardly
Powerfully shower me with the finest different designers
Leanin' back were shinin' like we drivin' in recliners
It's your highness the flyest, so acrobatic were manuverin'
Catch me freak dancin' in the club, I got the Ruger in

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The kings portrait laid inside the hand car frame
Hung over the fireplace admired by the peasants
Present some evidence for things you mention in your sentences
I'm devilish, the foot is like a leather fish
Smoke wax like a Brazilian salon
Stand on the corner after three in the morn'
All thermal on, your money shorter than a gerbil's arm
Fuck around, throw a gerbil in your mom
Yo change the channel put the Ninja Turtles on
Arrange the battle, blaze the saddles
Bust your motherfuckin' ass in basketball wearin' sandals
Gun at the side by the love handles
Bring me your face so I could fuck it hard
Then do a 720 in the mustard Saab
The bitch touched my hair said I must be god
That bitch touched my hair said I must be god

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Deluxe fresh, hop out the Lex flexin' ya ex
She's left stretched properly sexed fuck it I'm blessed
Checks comin' in, street money movin' at the same time
Gain shine whenever my feet step on the concrete
Seated outside drinkin' wine chewin' on conch meat
While cops heat corners and streets, we in the bistro
Thinkin' that ? don't fuck around I'll let my heat go
Cuban linx hand made, nigga I'm clan paid
Fuck a couple ratchets got lost to my man Rae
Seven thousand feathers in a eagle
The one I lost didn't have none but it was evil
Niggas try showin' fake love, but they be see through
Deceitful, my people
Still the same crew from back then
Sellin' drugs out the hoopty with a black Mac-10
Unique ringtones, obscure trap phones
You wack rap clones never had a backbone

[Hook]
