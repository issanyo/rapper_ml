[Intro: Action Bronson]
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Uh
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
It's the captain, skipper

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
To all the women that I hurt in the past, I didn't mean it (Sorry)
Now that we clear, come here, put your mouth right here (Uh huh)
I'm rare like a white deer with spiked hair (Uh)
New Nike Airs, smoke big cigars in a nice chair (Uh)
Oh why, oh why do I feel like I'm starving in Lionheart?
And sniffled every drug that's on the science chart (Damn)
I got a Mayan heart and I'm running
Like I'm Deion once the sirens start
Ring ring by the park, my pants keep falling
I hop the fence easy (Uh)
They stopped chasing, damn, my ID dirty
Haba√±ero, eat thirty, swerve off (Skrt)
Genesis, I Can't Dance blasting
Heavy metal hand clapping, captain, uh

[Refrain: Big Body Bes]
Machine gun money

[Break: Action Bronson]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's me

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I'ma stay fly until I'm up on that big spaceship in the sky (Sky)
The money coming with me when I die (Yes)
My drugs are coming with me when I die (Uh)
Nobody better cry (No), nobody better cry, man (No)
If you need me, I'm at the bottom of Lake Titicaca
Watching Euro Cup soccer, Portugal won, it was a shocker (Uh)
This rhythm open up my chakra (Uh)
And it keep telling me to cop the Porsche in aqua (Ooh)
It also said your boy is destined for an Oscar (Ooh)
And for my birthday, mommy blessed me with a chopper (Oh)
On my worst day, you couldn't clean my boxers
Or diagnose this mind with eighty doctors (Uh)
Life's a box of chocolates, it's me, man

[Refrain: Big Body Bes]
Machine gun money
