[Verse 1 : Action Bronson]
Well you could, lick it, flip it, taste it if you wanna
I ain’t gonna chase you round and sweat the pussy like a sauna
Her skin shown a touch of cinnamon and chocolate cookie
Fuck it 8 times raw, I call it octopussy
White shores, a little moist right by the pussy line
Now it’s push, push, push, right in the tushy time
Smooth landing, that mean she got a baldy
She sucking pee pee, making bread just like Grimaldi
But I'm the hero, serving sausage like its San Gennaro
Forget your past and come with me because your man is zero
I’m the whole shit, vintage from the cellar
The floor is made of glass and not the slipper Cinderella
Yeah, let’s mind the beat don’t know to pass it twice with flying colors
Talking crazy on the text but now you're shy in covers
That don’t fly bitch, I thought you was a fly bitch
Turn that ass around and let me hit you with the heimlich

[Verse 2 : Hologram]
Mami can fuck me for free, or suck for a fee
Trust and you’ll see, it’s nothing to me
I need me a cutie, with a pachutie
I’m on duty, hitting the booty cause
My nigga Magic Johnson came through with a hummer
Jay fucking Steele left a rim shot like a drummer
And she was from cali so she said it’s a bummer
I gave a rim job to a nimrod, I’ve been hard
With a dumb bitch, in that 65 impala she had one switch
She had one wish, she said she wanna have my dick like a baby
No maybe, she like dark meat, white gravy
And we was uptown so I told her I’m wavy
And now I got a little message for a young lady
Wash your leather cheerio after you take a dumpington
Cause when we start to humpington
I’m going in your rumpington
One thing I won’t have twice is shit dick, say it

[Chorus]
In my mouth, in my mouth, in my mouth baby
In my mouth, in my mouth, in my mouth baby
