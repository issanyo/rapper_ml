[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Uh, Baby, what's my name?
Uh, Baby, what's my name?
Now he laying with a motherfucker thinking that he got it
Thicker than my wallet
"Laying here" is what I whisper to the pilot
Digging in the privates, My face is looking Slavic
In a turquoise sidekick, Uh, tugging my side chick
Dominican, know she a fly bitch
I never got used to the climate (Never), I never got used to a wardrobe (Never)
I never got used to a bracelet, precious paintings on this whore's wall
Andy Warhol, light the cocoa, cause when I hop out of that four door
These bitches be taking my photo

[Verse 2: Leaf]
My man don't got no money
It's cool cause he's my sidey
Bringing in the paper like I made off in the Gatti
Hop up on my whip wearing Balenciaga
Margiela on the weekdays, the rest I'm wearing Prada

[Hook]
Anytime I need him, he come through
Know just how I like it so he do it how we do
Don't ask no silly questions cause he knows the way I move
Asked me if I like the way he hit it, I said "True"

Oh, yeah, come let me be your Sugar Mama
Right there, come let me be your Sugar Mama
Oh yeah, if you give it to me how I wanna
Then I, I can be your Sugar Ma

Cash, I got that
Them racks, I got that
Them stacks, I got that
Yeah, let me be your Sugar Ma
Cash, I got that
Them racks, I got that
Them stacks, I got that
Yeah, let me be your Sugar Ma

[Verse 3: Leaf]
He give it to me ASAP, never need no Peso
Massages, bubble bathin' while I count my queso
Tell them niggas lay low cause they ain't nothing to me
They ain't as good as me, myself and I and all my Louie

[Hook]

You riding 'round with them Benjamins
You want it baby, I'm spending it
You set it down, forever rounds, these luxuries ain't anything
These girls, they see you flossing
Yeah, they know that you that nigga
Looking for the baddest chick, you don't need one cause you with her

[Hook]
