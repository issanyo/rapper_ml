[Verse 1: J-Love]

Ayo, light the flame throwers
Son, spark that missile
Kid the bud is official
Like a 4 Long pistol
Son, smell the aroma?
The clouds of Cheech and Chong
[?] bong then [?]
Bishop Magic Don Juan
Park my yacht in a pond
Eating chicken parmesan
Pumping TJ Swan
Rolling up bushes of pineapple kushes
The lungs get full
Then releases and pushes
Right out the system
To restart the cycle
Sonny caught Michael's
Trees were delightful
Orange haired chiba
Get my golden retriever
Roasting them logs like I stuck up a beaver
Mix piff with ether
Fuck embalming fluid
I ain't no angel dust smoker
Greenery shooter
AK-47, taking me to 7th Heaven
If you got them high grades
Now you're my brethren
I don't fuck with no reds
That's for broke niggas
Sour diesel, bubblegum haze
My pockets are bigger, nigga
I might smoke with a roll hand
Such a destroyer
Barbarian like Conan
Supreme fly nigga
I love to get high, nigga
I do what I want
I don't give a fuck nigga
What!


[Hook: Action Bronson]

Smoke in the lungs, I feel it
After it's gone, I want it
It changes with the seasons
I'm living in the moment
It's devastation when I kiss you and you disappearing
You know I'll always love you
That there is crystal clear and-
Hands of Picasso, getting wham in a brothel
Smoking a taco with the butter crumbled up from Morocco
Half a palm, wrap the tarragon
Muthafuckas ain't ready to run a muthafucking Marijuana Thon


[Verse 2: Jay Steele]

We light the tree like Rockefeller Center in December
A drug sticker, rolling fires perfect for the winter
Three more seasons, three more reasons
To run the muthafucking Marijuana Thon
And don't stop smoking til the muthafucking marijuana's gone
I got one thing to tell you thugs
I specialize in using and selling drugs
They think they focused but I'm more in zone
I'm slinging niggas hydro without the cortisone
Smoking a Big L, Corleone
On my cordless phone
I might serve a whore
She a herbivore, prefer the raw
It's all about blue dreams and new schemes
The shit I'm talking higher grade and it's better known
I talk another language, dog
I'm Rosetta Stoned


[Bridge: Action Bronson]

We green smoking
Three fiend choking
Eating well
So at the table, I leave my jeans open
Laying lovely on the rusty boot
The .38 inside my jacket
I'm relying on to trust and shoot


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Take-It]

I roll dolo cause friends to me is limited
Just sit back, make me laugh, you so innocent
Blow the smoke to the sky before I finish it
You make it harder to breathe
This is business, kid
Orange and green, Apple Jacks
Serving nothing but the truth, Snapple Facts
Nice to meet you, what's going on?
You passing that?
She started laughing, all calm
Man, I'm laughing back
Pulled out my own sack
Equipped with a ciga-rello
Baby looking sour
In a hour, I'll be nice and mellow
I'm getting high like Hellos
Making me a nicer fellow
Brush my teeth because If I don't they'll be nice and yellow
I'm going through shit
But ain't no flies on it
Just light up that spliff
I got 5 on it
My weed get you high, don't it?
You want some more?
Up the cash and meet me down the block
By the store
