[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]

(Outdoorsmen, you know we keep it mar-vel on this side, mar-vel)
(Red beard Bronson, what up, my nigga? Yo, yo)

Take It Easy, New York forever greasy
I bust off slugs and make sales when niggas need me
Probably posted up in Queens somewhere rocking the finest
My shit is golden, pillagers wish they could mine this
Been the livest, my rank starts with a minus
You number one, that only means that you behind this
Take a bite of my life, sample the flyness
One of a kind, it's no other city could design this
Hand crafted limited, constructed in America
Home of the heartless, anybody could vendetta ya
New sneakers, plus furniture et cetera
I make a phone call to Crown Heights
Niggas is wetting ya
Hit the booth, spit my life just like a verbal journal
I've been official, on the other hand, your style is kernel
I could pop you and put you in succotash
Is that your real face or you rocking a sucker mask?
Muthafucka

(Ayo, Bronson, give it to these niggas- pause)
(Give it to these niggas- pause!)
(Give it to these niggas- pause!)


[Verse 2: Action Bronson]

Yeah
My mind above the clouds
Plus I love the way the thunder sound
Stevie Wonder mixed with Rambo on the underground
Queens sculpted, stay chiseled like a Greek god
I'm on the bar, I got the lyrical physique, par
My style attack like a German Shepherd
Bronsonelli need no gun cause I'm the Perfect Weapon
Puma shoe to step in, we doing all the repping
Hennessy felani, chiba for the blessings
Hop in the Caddy and drive
Plus I'm Out For Justice, never take me alive
Smoking two at a time
The Nikes with the newest design
We flew in the crime
Holler when the moon is aligned
Blow the weed to make the world spin
Break walls like I'm in Berlin
But still in the winter rocking shearling
Robocop Ruger twirling, crew dispersing
Snatch a person, hookers speaking Persian

(Yeah, Queens, Bronsolini, Outdoorsmen shit)
(Meyhem muthafucking Laurenovich, yeah)
(Fuck your father)
