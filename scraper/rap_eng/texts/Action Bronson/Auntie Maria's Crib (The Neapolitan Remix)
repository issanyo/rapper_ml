[Intro]
They’re my slippers, man
Mammy, get my slippers
Ary, where you going?
Can you fix me some soup before I go?
No, you just tell me before I tell what’s it just
You’ve got that certain something
It really turned me on
You can make me do right
Or you can make do wrong

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Diamonds tastin’, square like the 5 wagon
Passenger sit on the left
Drop a little ashes on the thigh muscle
I'm the doobie scholar
Old foreign white shooters, Tom Gugliotta
I'm an aristocrat
Flow tight like Whoopi character’s pussy in Sister Act
Or Ving Rhames in Baby Boy, catch you but naked, cookin’ eggs
Fuckin’ with your mother got your sister on the pegs
Dinos, mongooses
Redline, harrows
Rosemary toast paddle for the marrow
Got women of the streets straight emerging out the shadows
2 piece like Chris Childs did to Kobe
Catch me in the corner store, quarters for Shinobi
Ball court, I’m NB
Up in Auntie's house, chillin’ with the family

[Hook]
You’ve got that certain something
It really turned me on
You can make me do right
Or you can make do wrong

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Okay, this hookah got me cooler than the Buddha
Rap barracuda think it deeper than the scuba
Spark me up a Cuba
Me and my auntie Maria, she doing Santeria
While I be blastin’ a classic up in the galleria
You know my style, go for miles over miles
Ain’t no tellin’ what a crook is cookin up to see him cook
Hit you with the remix, got your man shook
Burnin’ higher burnin’, yea I wrote the damn book
French manicure crushing up the sticky
Very trippy type to get the secret out of pickie
We tight fly so, they know how I go
Only gettin’ higher them days that when we wild go
Causin’ me stress, curve you like the letter S
Take a hit to the chest and I pass the gun to the west
Yea, Nitty, Bronson, tone is so gifted
Put the flame to the bang and get lifted

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Kid Daytona]
Yea, were you naughty Maria crib?
Ganja’s bein’ lit
Fog so thick it’s hard for me to see you here
Needy gotta lead ya here
Style’s cheap in here
While smoking on this rain that was flown in from keira south
I brought some white bitches, they go the mirror out
Slice sniffle sane only 'cause it’s winter out
When in doubt, holla at your nigga
No college experience but get a lot of academics
My liver don’t like me too much
2 cups of Mama Juana, really I don’t give a fuck
Shit I’m all short of happy and I line up with some cups
So now what’s in the bookings? Conscious for the judge
Trippy sticks for hash throw
You guys sure lookin’ abnormal
Hit my contacts, the past on through
Regular show cartoon and my tune a nigga rollin’
Got a 3 bedroom and your geruzza started growin’

[Hook]
