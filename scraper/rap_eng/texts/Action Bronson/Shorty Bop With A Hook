[Verse 1]
As I roll the weed up, crack a brew and pull the seat up
Got doulas do the maneuver, so daddy putting his feet up
I'm multi-talented, my worth is more than music
Make the truth sticks, Bronsolini I'm on that smooth shit
Perfect posture when I'm standing in the valley
The artichokes are roasted to perfection like Batali, dude
Peace to my people and the groupies let me jam the coochi
Tropical island destinations hopping out the coup√©
My flow is Sexual Chocolate not outta Jackson Heights
But out of Flushing where we hitting hard like Quinton Jackson fights
Been on the rampage, you motha fuckas half as nice
Verbally jig you with the banger then I pass the knife
Right to my man because he always in position
To split you like it's division, deliver with the precsion
Of Eleven weapons posing by as Heaven beckons
You on that escalator up in under seven seconds

[Hook]
Yo why my marijuana always thinking crime shit?
Cause lambs delicious with the '87 wine dig
The whip feel good, we're shifting with the left hand
The leather glove and loafer matching with the vest and
I'm on a mission for dollars and I'm a dreamer
Doing drugs and fucking bitches with bottles inside the steamer
It's hard not to form a habit I'm getting twisted in the yard
Eating foreign rabbits, I'm on that next Shit
