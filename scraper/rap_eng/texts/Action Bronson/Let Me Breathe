[Intro]
Like the way it sounds, Fraudy?
Uh, yeah, yeah
Just let me breathe for a minute, man
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe for a minute, man
(You already know it's me, man)
Just let me breathe for a minute
(You already know it's me, man)
Just let me breathe

[Verse 1]
It's too hot, drop the top off the wagon (Uh)
Lay back, blowing fire like dragon (Poof!)
Man, I'm flying past Saturn (Uh)
Fuck outta here like I ain't that savage
(No, no, no, no)
Two Uzis and a rifle (Woo!)
It's like I'm at the studio with Michael (Michael Jackson)
You can hear me dancing on the beat (Uh)
Bam Bam 'bout to put a mansion on the beach, uh
Hundred Latins in your lobby (What?)
That's what happens when you fuck around with Body (Body)
Uh, and I put that on my mami (It's on my mami)
I would never give my heart to a thotty (Never!)
If I could just make a dance that goes with this song (Uh)
Then I'ma be on (So on)
Basic bitches gon' dance to it (Everywhere)
Basic bitches everywhere gon' dance to it (Everywhere)

[Chorus]
Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, uh
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowin' trees all in it
Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, man
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowin' trees all in it

[Bridge]
You got a fat ass, baby, shake that shit
Shake that shit
Shake that shit
You got a fat ass, baby, shake that shit
Shake that shit
Shake it

[Verse 2]
I got two shows, I'm about to pitch another
Throwing alley oops to my brothers (Curry!)
We all shine, nobody victims (No)
Armani sweatsuit pimping (Uh)
Black Pippens (Uh)
I swag different (Uhh)
That's why the money in the bag different (Different)
Come up short, you'll have your motherfuckin' fam missing (Gone)
I lay on beaches and swerve in whips (Uh)
You ain't servin' shit, you just an urban myth (Woo!)
Every day get fleek (Fleek)
Riding around Queens on a jetski, it's me (You know it's me!)
Everyday get high (High)
'Til the day I die
Everyday get high
Man I roll that shit (Shit)
And I smoke that shit
Honey bouncin' up and down (Down)
She nearly broke my dick (My dick)
She nearly broke my dick (My dick, my dick)

[Chorus]
Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, uh
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowin' trees all in it
Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, man
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowin' trees all in it
