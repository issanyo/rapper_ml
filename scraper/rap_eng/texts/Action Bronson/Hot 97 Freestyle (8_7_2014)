[Action Bronson]

[Verse 1]
I might be chubby but I'm gorgeous in the face
Things are going well hope I don't catch that fucking case
I could get on some other shit and send you to that place
50 for the shooter, 100 for my steak
Your life ain't worth a steak. I keep the rifle in the cape
To be on top with the title be my fate
Don't make no mistakes
Mami, you see me - everything's a movie
I jump in the jacuzzi with that green Coogi
The plane lift up, just like that batty boy chain lift up
Crimes committed with no hiccups. (AHHH)
That thing-thing shred your stomach like sit-ups
You'll never sit up or shit from your butt
They say I'm crazy and deranged but, fuck, I can handle that
I crack the whip right from the camel's back
My head is wrapped like Yasser Arafat
And I don't sleep no more, it's only fucking power naps

[Verse 2: Acapella]
It's so easy to just be looked over
I never look sober
Look through the eyes of a soldier
I look fly in the rover
Lions and cobras
Keep the iron in the toga
Send a message - leave you lyin' over
Bitches crushin' on the kid so now they flyin' over-
Half of the world to get wrapped in pearls-
Just like the Queen of England
I stay wavy
Mercedes color - Wayne Brady
It's me baby
Please baby
Ain't nobody takin' my spot, that's on my mother's kid
Cross my heart and hope to die, that's on some other shit
This motherfuckin' kid be coveted
Different types of silks is what I'm covered with
Baby I'm lovin' it
Your boy is hotter than an oven mitt
If I was broke then you'd be running your shit
Poke your kidney with the knife I cut the onion with
And poach your kidneys with some onions and shit
It's me

(Ayo I never been the plaintiff. Ever. What what what. Hahaha. I dont fuck with this I'm done.)

[Verse 3: Acapella]
My lawyer tackled the case like he played for the Ravens
So I stuff him with cheese like a Danish
Damn, I crave paper
Catch me later at the Laker game, I bet a grip on the Knicks
Carmello sweatin' on my kicks, cause I'm courtside-
This time the good way
I'm a free man, that's what I should say
Nobody holdin' me back except myself, that's what I feel like
Peelin' the 5, now I'm feelin' the vibe
Hand on the wheel, drugs in my eyes, money in my mind
I think about it all the time
Cause there was a time I never had shit
Now I got shit, it's like magic
All these cars in front of the crib look like a Porsche pageant
