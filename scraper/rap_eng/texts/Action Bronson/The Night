[Sample]

Coming of the night, coming of the night
Coming of the night, coming of the night
Coming of the night-
Makes me see the joy!

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]

Just lamping, man, Meyhem Lauren
Outdoorsmen, nahimsaying?

Outshine a diamond when I'm rhyming
Kid, there's no denying
Niggas be sweating my techniques
I call it flow perspiring
Rappers stay rapping about the guns that they be always firing
I'll wet your block like you was really beefing with Poseidon
Heavy grinding, I was twenty when I bought my Breitling
Built like a bison
Bagging bitches like I'm Peabo Bryson
Coincidental, I knock niggas out
Resemble Tyson
My life's enticing
Flipping flows, you know my words enlighten
Classic when I'm writing
Smashing like a fucking titan
Illuminate a walk into the dark and make it bright

[Verse 2: Killa Sha]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, c'mon

The nocturnal, lyrical, verbal competitor
The predator, geared up and he raw
Make one thing here for sure, it's all true
Late night is when the God do what he do
Ten PM get the checks cut
Looking for the next cut
Now, who's next up?
Shoot a nigga vest up
Midnight scenery at it's best
Guaranteed to put a nigga to rest
And held cess and maintain
Too many thoughts in the brain
Have a nigga damn near insane
But this is real life
A lot of niggas like to move in spite
But the God ain't caught with the hype
So get it right (yeah!)

[Verse 3: J-Love]

Coming of the night
I transform into a vampire
Have niggas under pressure like Chris from The Wire
But I play the role of Marlo, call me Don Corleone
Outdoorsmen on the way, I'm like the chaperone
My squad's official, like a German luger pistol
I accumulate stacks and waste hundreds by the fistful
I'm putting New York in smash
Call me Giuliani
Let me blow your mind like Eve and Gwen Stefani
The greatest man walking
Son, a Nighthawk royalty
Only give respect when cats give loyalty
A rare commodity
So I focus on the chief
A lyrical genius and a beatmaking beast

[Verse 4: Take-It]

I'll come again, hold up pistols to the unofficial
You pray for Jesus Christ, hoping that the Lord is with you
I'll lay you in your coffin, cough cause when your mother kiss you
And have your sister on the grind, selling dimes and nickels
You full of issues like Sports Illustrated
Never hated, when you made it
Underestimated, Take-It, now
He your favorite rapper, gotta adapt to this new chapter
Make you see the joy and laughter off this lyrical disaster
Some say "your majesty," some say "master"
Sell smoke like cancer, more white than Casper
Come here, ma, sit on my lap, just like Santa
Ask you a question, "who that?"
"Give me that", answer
Take-It!

[Verse 5: Action Bronson]

Sunday brunch, lovely landscapes
Eating pancakes, sunny sides and a ham steak
Face full of beard, heart full of malice
Light up the chalice
My index trigger finger's calloused
You make it rain, I keep the shotty in the trench
While you're hugged up with your mommy
Leave your body on the bench
So oddly, when I carve the body
Vomit from the stench
The lemon essence muffins in the oven
Covered up the scent (smells good!)
Back alley Bronson, young Magic Johnson
Sick nigga balling, pay for prosy's just for sporting
I'm courting African Ray's
Nigga, they're black and they're suede
Cause when I spit this disease
You catching African AIDS

[Verse 6: AG Da Coroner]

Night time, that's a nigga favorite part of the day
Weed smoking on the bench
Freestyling in hallways
There's always a block party
Popping in the summer, G
The dope boys hustle and muscle to make another G
Moonlight shining right down to my grill
Transform into a wolf
And the blood start to spill
It's all real, the steel keep your cavities filled
Everybody in the hood had dreams to make mills
It's midnight, the two hands touching the one, two
House party we come through
Even the buds too
Wait for the sun to come back up
And when it go down, the whole Rosa fam ready to strap up
Mob full of spics, they call us the Spic Mob
Contracts on your head, we call it a stick job
What!

[Outro]

Coming of the night
Makes me see the joy!
