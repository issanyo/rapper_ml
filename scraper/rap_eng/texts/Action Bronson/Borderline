[Verse]
My homies are straight outta Puebla
They work in the kitchen with me
They bring in the cars that the hookers have robbed
Forty dollars is usually the fee
They live right on [??] in the night
They won't think twice to cokey your wife
Came in the van and they leave in the same
High on the mountains, cheese on the brain
