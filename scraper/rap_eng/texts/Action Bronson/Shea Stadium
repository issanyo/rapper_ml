[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
95 pairs of 95's, never had a 9 to 5
Unfortunate but currently I'm keeping crime alive
Survival tactics been adapted and now it's automatic
Been known for [?]
[?] labels, brief cases under tables
Cuban link connect the cables
[?]
Seen [?] real frauds and fake fables
Know a couple lames, couple Cane's, couple Abel's
Couple friends gone with the wind, they Clark Gables
Artificial love is deadlier than real hate
So if you're fronting, let me know now before it's too late
Give me that courteousy, Gore-tex flesh, you couldnâ€™t dirty me
Shouldn't be here, it's like my life is like a burglary
Stolen from statistic pages, somebody looking out
Steal your fate from government
That's what your [?] about
[?]

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I fixed the Seminoles and Hoyer game
Whip the drop in the pouring rain
Felt spoiled once the oil came
Jimmy the Greek now we laying with the sheet
Sleep with pieces of sidewalk on his feet
Meet the maker [?] the paper
Feet [?] in Jamaica
Queens is my birth and will continue till I perish
Dreams of looking vivid, sitting twisted on the terace
Backwood at 86 degrees, mountains in the window
Swear to God this fucking game is like Nintendo
Dive out the rental, land on my feet
My [?] keep the salmon in the creek
[?] got us out here
Trying to pile into top door
Joints rolled up like a taco
Drug in a tube sock shooting pool
My eyes is silent like the moon
