[Intro]
Morey Boogie Board shit
Off the coast
Sand bars
Bam Bam

[Verse 1]
I got the mental of the Bad Lieutenant
We gamble drug money, riverboats, Cadillacs
Talkin' 'bout a prison note
Lemon zest is subtle in the fish they call the cuttle
We grew up in the gutter break your jaw like a huddle
Morey boogie boards wax the top so we stay on
Wrist strap is pitch black, 360 shades on
I won't stop until the wall's got Monet's drawn
The farmland and other animals to graze on
I'm always smoking on the potent straight from Oakland
I'm rising like a souffl√©, you know you gotta serve it quick
Just dust me off with cheese, pussy straight from Persia bitch
They'll find your leg in Maine, your torso out in Jersey snitch
I rock the lenses Caminiti wore
I roll a fifty of the dour to the neck and take a city tour
Any genre got the salsa and the gritty raw
Timeless, my mother's diamonds 1954

[Hook x2]
I gotta get that dough, I want the Beamer with the racing seats
Pound the ground with my feet to make the pavement speak
And tell me secrets that she's never told a soul to
The price of living your decisions could control you

Yeah Bronsolino
Queens
Real shit
Queens

[Verse 2]
I sign my name like I'm Mantle, never sticking to the script
Be with people off the boat, seven languages and shit
Bring tradition to the street, get you lifted off your feet
Like my daughter at the park, no taking orders after dark
Cause they expect it
So wake up early, hop off the shitter
Employ a lawyer that's been bar mitzvahed
Never trust a goyim, see me sippin' spritzer, hookers with Spitzer
And Mr. Wedge, 30 dollars hollers never tip her
This condensation that be building in the weed jar is bothersome
Half of my leg covered with Robinson's
The FernGully in this dutch, me and Steele smokin'
Jail letters, pretty bitches gettin' peeled open

[Hook x2]
