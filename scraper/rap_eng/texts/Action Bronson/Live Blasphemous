[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
Living life no brakes, all gas
Looking out for them snakes
Watchin' that tall grass
Skipping class no hall pass
I got to get cash before they evict our ass (the rent due)
Momma at home stressin' running out of shit to do
So im out with my tool, i ain't got shit to loose
Never trust niggas, my hommies can get it too
I haven't trusted a bitch since Eve bit that fuckin' fruit
My brothers aitnt home, My niggas in jail
So im here on my own, just some dope and this scale
Flippin' work by the zone, hittin' school in the morning
And robbing niggas for phones
I was young and wildin'
In the streets while ya'll was watching gula gula island
Who would of thought i be rhymin' now when niggas shinin'
And ima go hard like this a nigga last year
Cause they say the best persevere

[Hook]
I waited my whole life for this
Die young live blasphemous
Don't dwell on cash we spent
Cause theres still more cash to get, We gettin' rich
Get money fuck niggas
They see we wining so they trying to fuck with us
I see them grillin' so never trust niggas
I was taught to get money fuck niggas

[Action Bronson]
Been on the road alone
If i dont make it home somebody call my momma
Hand on the llama thinking damn im to old for drama
You know the money stay in the case until the product is tested
Looking asian in the lexus double gold quest on the chest shit
Rolling german suplexes strait into duplexes
Yo calm down you actin' wild, peep the style
Look shorty down the lake, graduated like a cap and gown
Blast that pussyclaut clame that carcass like a basset hound
I throw a child down the stares if needed
The next day see me smoking with my fans in Sweden
Why are you breathing? Are the questions that i ponder
As i sit in the great ? blasting salsa
I need a doctor, all my wolves like Kevin Costner
Play your part like you won seven oscars
I used to have seven partners
And now we cop choppas
To lift you like its heavens opra
Bronson Sinatra
