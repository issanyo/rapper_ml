[Mary J. Blige cover]

[Intro]
I'm not a singer so I'm going to give the best vocal performance I possibly can. Off the couch. Yeah

[Verse 1]
Time on my hands since you've been away girl
I ain't got no plans, no, no, no, no
And the sound of the rain against my windowpane
Is slowly, slowly drivin' me insane, oh

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

[Verse 2]
Sleep don't come easy, oh please believe me
Since you've been gone everything's goin' wrong
Why'd you have to say, "Goodbye", look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from fallin' down my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down (haha)
I'm goin' down
You ain't around, motherfucker
My whole world's upside down

[Bridge]
Baby love
(Don't you try to hand me the lyrics)
Baby love
Baby love
(Hold them up for me)
Goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm from Queens motherfucker
And that's it, take 'em home
Take 'em home fellas
Young Mac, young Dom, young Fred, young Paul, young [?]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
You ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down


Thank you, thank you, thank you very much
That was beautiful, what a rendition
Phenomenon, phenomenon
