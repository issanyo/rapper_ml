[Intro: Action Bronson]
Bronsolino.... no
Straight from the galaxy
Drug abusin'

[Sample: Harry Fraud's trademark shout-out]
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Hook: Action Bronson] x2
I got the jar full of drugs
Fridge is filled with snapple
Southern coast of France
Tart fennel with the apple
The feet are purple cause I'm stepping on the grapes
Consensual the rape
I got the presence of the greats

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
We grip grains
Switch lanes
Been fucking since the fifth grade
I never rock the ring or necklace with a bitch name
A thick frame
Flawless victory my dick game
Is Mortal Kombat, you still a shorty shit stain
My drug, blood, beauty, origami cranes
Perfection like an Asian's math
Neat like an Irish drink
You know that Bronson like a swimmer cause I dive in pink
You sooner see me out in Africa with tiger mink
We make your father curtsy
Cut off his manhood
Come through in Beamers
Interior leather tan wood
The shoes are suede
Off the reservation - redfoot
These stripper bitches in my bed
They give me head good

[Hook: Action Bronson] x2

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
This is blood sport
Kick boxer, double impact
Kick it like a Van Damme foot
You get your shit cracked
I'm out for justice
Above the law and hard to kill
G-g-guard your grill
Catch me hoppin' out the hard De Ville
Hammers are pointing my direction to the top
The loafers show off my ankle
Getting shifty in the drop
Kid, twist up the pot
Through my nostrils to the atmosphere
No middle man
You deal directly with the captain here

[Movie sample: Out For Justice (1991)]
"You still suckin' it. When your brother was around town suckin' dicks, just the same... you shouldn't talk so tough."
"My brother was here, you wouldn't talk so tough like that."
"Yeah, well he's not here. You know why he's not here?"
"Why?"
"Cause he's a chickenshit fuckin' pussy asshole!"
