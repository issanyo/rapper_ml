[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
Ashes to ashes, blunt after blunt
I dont give a fuck, you can call it what you want

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Ain't no reason to doubt this, be that beyond reasonable doubt shit
Rap Genius, check the account for vouches
Oooh We out here, bout to knock these rap niggas out chairs
Dethrone 'em from higher powers cause no clique is high as ours
Niggas try and copy our style we can't dig it
You can't rep the coast if we ain't say that you with it
If you wit it, then you know that who's really
Runnin this rap shit, niggas caught in the rapture
These niggas is just actors we shoot out on film
Catch you on the real, set up the cannons and blast you for real
Now everyone could see the movie that you dreaming
Everyone can watch ya live while you streaming
Blue dreaming, make my eyes look blue demon
Make half an ounce disappear, shazzam Houdini
Two genies, I'm too genius
Record breaker flows hand this record to Guiness and it's gold
I'm a pro
Say what you know? What you know?
Its how we roll, how we roll
I suppose it's like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I used to suplex a fiend
Now I'm about to cop a duplex this Spring
It ain't a thing to get the boom bing
Let two ring, while the kid is in the new swing
Hop in the 850 laced like a shoe string
I like the pussy like a catcher's mitt
I'm passionate
Your man got lots of clams but never flashing it
Stay with a bitch that got an ass that's good for stashing shit
My man got one eye
Work like where the sun lies
Through my son's eyes
Forty floors up, look at the sunrise
I'm such a low life, but now I'm dumb high
My joint look like a mudslide
Shit to make my lungs cry
You hold it down, I see the one time
Swing the Beamer lefty like Mo Vaughn
Fancy clothes are worn
You get lifted like a composer's arms
Blood, I'm the chosen one
I won't eat unless there's a frozen swan
Laugh at these old fuckers still holding on
It's me, no

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Consider this an early collectors item
Something special
