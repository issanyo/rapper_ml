[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand
And I'll never be the same

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
You can see me on the riviera dressed like a Playboy
Or you can catch me up in Rivieras Tuesday night
Pillow fights with Dominican mothers
That's what happens when theres suede on the roof
Swervin' lane to lane in a coupe
Shit, if I crash it, I'll probably just leave it as a token
That your boy coulda died right there, no jokin'
Uh, eating well so my foot's swollen
Fuck it man I'm rollin', you rollin' or not?
The boat plane's waiting at the dock
I wonder if he let me fly it, but it's a long shot
The money eases everybody's mind
Put kids through school, new titties on wives
New tits for the mistress
Fuck it, new titties for everybody, it's Christmas, yeah

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand
And I'll never be the same no

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I use milfhunter.com to ease the pain
It was ninety-two degrees with rain
Right before the seasons changed
On trees just a little bit of leaves remain
My heart broke when his cock was in your throat
But fuck that laid top out on the boat
Heard you fucked Ryan Philippine at 1 OAK
My man seen you both at the Sunoco
Kissing and touching, lied and said that this was your cousin
Shit, I should have known when you stole money
Bitch called the cop and rolled on me
So good, I got old money
To lay on any motherfucking beach on the planet
With equestrian colored salmon
We examine my life and make sure I'm never dumb again
But first, slide your panties to the side girl, I'm comin' in

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand and I'll never be the same, no
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand and I'll never be the same no
