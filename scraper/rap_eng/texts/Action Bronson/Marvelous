[Hook x2]
I guess my whole team is marvelous
Street life marvelous, street life novelist
They see me lampin' up in 8 50's
With 3 60’s, blowing like 1 60, selling 50’s

[Verse 1: Eddie B]
I’m tryna get top dollar, you ain’t fucking with my vision
Young Andy Pettitte when it comes down to pitching
I’m a rottweiler, that’s the way that I be living
Sic'in opposition, till I’m in the top position
I’m ready and willing, to load up the weapon
I guess you could call me a soldier
Wavy creatures only, I be bending bitches over
Sippin grape soda, while I’m puffin on some Oh God
Scars on my chest and they wonder why I’m so hard
Praise the lord, my spit sound sacred
I’m sitting at the throne, getting dome like King David
Your face is on the pavement cause you didn’t make a payment
And we don’t give a fuck about the lames that you came with
Same shit, different day, go and get your popcorn
If you start drama I’ll be waiting on your pops' lawn
Hit em with the blocka, make em take a fatal loss
Could have been my home boy, now you just tomato sauce

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo get the whip virgil, hit the pussy till the shit’s purple
Spit verbal, higher booses on the drift circle
Driven by chinos with they collar pop
Stay by the water like I’m Cobblepot
Skrrrrt, now I done drop
Wake up in silk like a moth
Violently cough, from all the violet and the broth
Sit on the grass, caught my dashboard needed a passport
She with the black horse, relax boys
Fuck around and get your back lost
Fuck, I need my ass tossed off gp
By an asian prostitute, her name Christine Lee
Then I snorkled in her butt like it’s club med
Lit this chocolate that I purchased from a young dread
Samurai shoulder, no Sega Genesis and Pegasus
My back is strong like a stegosaurus
I lift the charm with my eyes closed
What’s next for me only the sky knows, damn!
