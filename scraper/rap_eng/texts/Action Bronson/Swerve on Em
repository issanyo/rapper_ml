[Intro: A$AP Rocky & Action Bronson]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's your baby boy Bronsoliño
Yeah, yeah
(La Musica de Harry Fraud)
Yeah
Yeah (All my life)

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
The style icon, ’bout to get the dough like taekwon
Beat the pythons, when I fuck I like to leave the lights on
I'm just a piece of art
All these tattoos hidden under bracelets on my right arm
Shit, I need some tiger balm, I don't even like this song
Yeah, I skrrt 911s better with that other one
Man, these pussies love to run, but they always runner-up
I ain’t with that funny stuff, yeah, I'm 'bout that money up
Leave 'em sunny up, give 'em tummy tuck
Bronson always hit that fucking target, never dummy luck
In these fucking streets, you get your collar popped for 20 bucks
And I'm just focused on these hoes that's on the honey nuts

[Chorus: Action Bronson & A$AP Rocky]
I swerve on 'em, skrrt on ’em, swerve on ’em, swerve on 'em
High as fuck, your boy almost hit the curb on ’em
Swerve on 'em (Yeah, yeah), swerve on 'em, skrrt on 'em (Yeah, yeah)
Looking like you need some help (Yeah, yeah), throw a bird on ’em

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Had a funny feeling you fronting, every time I see you, you phony
Bitch, everything Johnny, jabroni, everything gettin' jolly, lil homie
Ever since my childhood, I grown to be, astonishing, notice me
Just notice me, I make her cream, call me Jodeci
Man, I ride like you're slow to leave, niggas know Flacko Jodye
Took a toke, nigga, pour the lean, feeling stomach pains, nausea
Had me absent, no notary, no, no, nothing to sober me up
Fell asleep, go to sleep, my niggas still asleep, rest in peace
Ready or not, here I come, man, I feel like a refugee
You just captain, Captain Save-A-Ho, hoes screaming, “Come rescue me”
Man, I came for the best, so who claim they the best?
Swore she knew what was best for me, when she left, took what's left of me

[Chorus: Action Bronson]
I swerve on 'em, swerve on 'em
Skrrt on 'em, swerve on 'em
Swerve on 'em, swerve on 'em
Your boy almost hit the curb on 'em

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Had a funny feeling you fronting, every time I see you, you phony
Bitch, everything Johnny, jabroni, everything getting jolly, lil homie
Ever since my childhood, I grown to be, astonishing, notice me
Just notice me

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Baby, just notice me
I'm in the green Lotus Jeep, try not to go to sleep
Don't let the devil take control of me
My eyes closed, but I know where I'm going
It started snowing and I started dancing
And I started crying, bitch, it's Johnny Handsome
I dive off boats, jump out of planes ass naked
Swervin' Maserati trucks in the rain
Man, it's all about the hunger and pain
And to this jungle, I came
With these drugs all in my lungs and my veins

[Outro: A$AP Rocky & Action Bronson]
(Had a funny feeling you fronting) You know (Every time I see you, you phony) True
(Bitch, everything Johnny, jabroni) Uh (Everything getting jolly, lil homie) Uh
(Ever since my childhood, I grown to be, astonishing, so to speak, just notice me)
Just notice me, baby, just notice me
