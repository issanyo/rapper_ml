Smoke wax, hat low like a marine
The only way to describe the scene was serene
Serena Williams in the BM doing neck thrusts
I need that check cut laid on the deck getting sexed up, green Harley
The only way to describe the colour of the seat was Steve Harvey
Sleep hardly, rock a loafer to the beach party
My weed smell like when your niece farted
Throw acid on your cheek, oh man
Throw acid on your cheek, now you're a work of art
Beauties only skin deep, they'll still accept you
Stuff a quarter pound of drug inside the asshole of a German shepherd
My jacket made of Cuban leopard
My shoe's old habitat was the rain forest
Feed my family with the main harvest
I used to have a snake but that motherfucker escaped
His cousin not so lucky, got made into a bucket hat
I'm truly a classic, shooting dice with Ernie Anostas
Your team'll see gurnies and caskets
That's it, bastard
This shit I mastered
Do a backflip
Out of the black whip
