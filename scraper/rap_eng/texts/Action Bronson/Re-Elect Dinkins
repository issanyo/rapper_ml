Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor

[Verse 1: Machine]

This New York Knick flying
Jetting with some Giants
Or raging in Long Island
Bronx Bombing with some Lions
In my city that's the client
The product I'm supplying
Words got 'em wilding like a Rikers Island riot
Yeah, I'm shining what I'm writing
Every letter will win
I'm trying to have Manhattan rock me more than cheddar Timbs
Rest in peace to the 9
When weed was a fine
And Rockefeller was a governor
Not some jail time
It's Machine, Mr. Rap For Days, you got nada
I'm holding down the base like I'm Jorge Posada
Grand slamming, my team connect like Verrazano
From the land of the Gotti's
Gigante's, the capos
The Uptown knock out
Heat sealed by papo
Broadway, Audubon, Amsterdam, all day
The galaxy of Queens
And hipsters on the L train
It's Mayor Goonberg!
All you herbs will get ?
Re-Elect Dinkins

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]

1990 to '93, Action Bronsolini

Yo, Summer '91, me and David Dink
My shoes were suede
His diamond color, gray blink
Held the sniffter, quarter filled with Cognac
Had security to handle heavy chrome gats
Turned his head, took a bump, wiped his nose off
And copped a loosey, a Philly and a O-Dog
He spit the game to make the ladies take their clothes off
He ride Mercedes, smother chicken gravy, cole slaw
White bitches was his forte
He fed them raw yay
Portraits of himself in the foyer
She asked the lord to eat the kitty
He put a knife to her neck
"Listen bitch, yo this is my city"
Chain of command, chief of police to take the fall
Hundred thousand dollars out the projects
Straight to the hall
Clouds of smoke, floating out the gray Lincoln
We's thinking, best to re-elect Dinkins
Bitch!

[Verse 3: The Kid Daytona]

Yooo
If you ain't know who I be, what the name was
Same thing as the beach, bitch, wave them
Hands in the air, you should know where I'm from
Same place as Hip-Hop and KRS-One
To the R tick tock and we just begun
Furthermore, shit stopped when we're in the room
Facelift, community juice, colossal
Flow doper than Strawberry's nostrils
No niggas, no mom or pop
But still made it in America with Rasta Masta
The ganja, moved on to the Sarah Jessica Parker
Cut it like a barber, put it in boiling water
Empire State, Big Apple pies
Try your fate, homie, Capitalize
Early '90s way of thinking
Romy on a mission
Bloomberg is the mayor
But I voted for David Dinkins
