[Intro]
Fucking drug shit
Do the drugs
Yeah
Yo

[Verse 1]
Straight from the depths of Queens.
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln, then switch into a desert scene
Often heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking
Raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks, dick suck from Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms
4 in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Wasting my time, my thoughts are paced, untastable grace replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around, put the knife in your back
This is nothing, we live & let die and roam the land
And you bluffing
You lifted the cards and showed your hand pussy

[Verse 2]
Tailor-made rubber, Rubbermaid reliable
Never spill the soup
Rock a linen suit
Play the streets like the ball court
Spin & shoot
Strong as Popeye dipping in the spinach too

[Verse 3]
Take my nuts out your mouth
Let me breathe for a minute please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You're on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infested my mind
But I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Live divine, free the mind, lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
No you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottyd
Make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cuz I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room then she's pleasing them
Like a trooper. Hit her in the pooper. Throw her in the shower
Then I take her out to Lupa
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put em in the shower, make the pussy brand new
Ran through. Give 'em money what I can't do
Stuff her lunchbox & burn her with the candle

[Verse 4]
UH!
Consensual Rape
Vinegar solutions
Animal abusing
Barrel revolutions
Don't get me pissed off, fuck around rip your tits off
Still getting head, even if my dick's soft
Rising quick, no Fleischman's
I'm in the endzone with one leg up, posing like Heisman
Throwing like Theismann, sway foot
With the Village Leader smoking a pipe with seven wise-men
I eat the biggest piece of chicken at the table
Let 'em know I'm hungry
Polo on the rugby
The forty-four long surely got a trusty home
Trying to live American Dreams...Dusty Rhodes

Yeah
Fucking Pussy
