[Verse 1]
Straight from the depths of Queens
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln, and switch into a desert scene
Often heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you're waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking, raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit, it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks, dick's up for Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms, four in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Waste of my time - my thoughts are patient, [?] replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around, put the knife in your back
Cause it's nothing, we live and let die and roam the land
And you bluffing, you lifted the cards and showed your hand, pussy
Tailor-made rubber, rubber made reliable
Never spill the soup, rock a linen suit
Play the streets like the ball court, spin and shoot
Strong as Popeye, dipping in a spinach Coupe
Pull my nuts out your mouth, let me breathe for a minute, please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infesting my mind, but I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Lift the vine, free the bonds - lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
Now you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottied - make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cause I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room, then she's pleasing 'em
Like a tropper, hit her in the pooper
Throw her in the shower then I take her out to LUPA
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put 'em in the shower, make the pussy brand-new
Ran through, give her money's what I can't do
Stuff her lunch box and burn her with a candle
Consensual rate, vinegar solutions
Animal abusing, down with revolutions
Don't get me pissed off, fuck around, rip your tits off
Still getting head even if my dick soft
Rising quick, no Fleischmann's
I'm in the end zone with one leg up, posing like Heisman
Throw it like Theismann, suede foot
With the village leader, smoking a pipe with seven wise men
I eat the biggest piece of chicken at the table
Let 'em know I'm hungry, Polo on the Rugby
The .44 long, surely got a trusty hove
Tryna live the American dream, Dusty Rhodes, yeah
