[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I’m the perfect portrait of a man hop out the burgundy brougham
Looking like zohan get with the program
Leave you with no head then no hands
No more holding hands motherfuckers is sweeter than golden grahams
I represent a place were you wish you were from
Fuck around slip up  you’ll be missing a son Just like a cloudy day
Dime bag and some mother fucking alisé
Never forget from were I came from  day one
Bitch I does this gave your bitch a chunkiss is to chase the monsters
Smoking stupid shit to keep my fucking lungs fit
Hard top gators click clacking  like a gun clip
Drinking liquor out the bottle
It feels like I just won the lotto
I only made a million dollars
Already spent that million dollars

[Chorus:]
It go mo money mo crime screaming fuck the po-nine
I hold mine down ain’t no gett’n it if you don’t grind
Homie I want the whole nine
Real ones that cosign they I know I’m official
Lets get this money it’s go time say let’s get this money it go time
You heard gotta get this money it’s go time uugh let’s get this money it go time
Can’t stop gotta get that money it’s go time

[Verse 2: Go Time]
Think back to when all us was starving
Then I discovered lyrically in sort of a problem
So when you hear this flawless recording
Cherish your money and thank God I never resorted to robbing
06-268 duce when I arrive
Who do admire guys who was spitting fire bars
Who knew that I would rise and quite guys that hated and go into quite ties with
The ones Idolize I grind cus I’m beyond what I was on B
Hated putt’n my sneakers on when they was grungy
Tryna get on son I was onrgy
Slinging trash bags full of ol racks mom though it was laundry
I’m tryna make the balance and stay away from wild’n
But ain’t faces smiling I ain’t becoming no waste a talent
If you ain’t tryna progress you don’t impress me
Show off cuz you can’t spell hustle without the “st”

[Chorus]
