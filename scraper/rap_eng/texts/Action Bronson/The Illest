[Verse 1: Solace]

The undisputed

Yo, higher learning
The tires burning
Niggas is rapidly swerving
A face looked familiar
But had to be certain
I popped a u-ey then I merged in
Matter was urgent
A dirty merchant, made him bleed like a virgin
Sent to the surgeon
Searching for them green berets
Trying to blow my dome off
Thrown off by decoys who dropped the maricon off
My Soviet niggas is ready for the Cold War
Machete you to confetti
And blow your brain to cole slaw
A roll call for my niggas that were nearly grazed
And for them early graves by them dudes that really blazed
And sing to your face with metal blades, serenades
I told you to look over your shoulder like Willie Mays
I come from where it's easiest to find anguish
Don't say a word
Speak with our hands like sign language
Divine language embedded into the rhyme patterns
So praise the savior that's saving you from the mind damage
And, oh well, the drugs'll sure to sell
But if you short a sale
They bout to pop you with the coppertop like Duracell
And all the swell kids that dropped out from outreach
Triple jab your cheek
Crack your teeth through the mouthpiece
These foul streets, meet your fate when the Tec releases
You'll be aight if you ain't playing chess with checker pieces
My nigga check the thesis


[Hook: Action Bronson & Solace]

For hookers selling pussy that'll never see a dime
And snitch niggas singing to the cops, dropping lies
For piggies asking questions but my people turn to mimes
And verbal motion picture, cinematic with the rhymes
For yen up in the envelope, purple in the dutch
And bare knuckle boxing, sneaking weapons in the fight
For clutches being popped and dipping boys up on a bike
This the illest shit you heard in your life


[Verse 2: Action Bronson]

Yo, ayo
Kinetic mind tricks
Live shit that power ships
Thought to message to the finger, lay the coward stiff
Foul kiss, bastard open bowel shit
Bleeding like Christina when I laid her on the towel shit
Sport the Filas, low cream, red and blue
Long jackets, smoking salad out the Jetta new
Whoever knew, we make it singing rap songs
From standing in a circle spitting verbal like a Mac strong
Went from a center for teens, to smoking sour like a surgeon
Swerving in the tunnel on the way to Queens
Knife in the Hansen, cloth over the phone for the ransom
Flow like a phantom
Bitches give me box cause I'm handsome
Roll down the window
Exhale, see flashing lights move
Dip the Babylon like a skater on the ice move
Alex Ovechkin
740, heavy flexing
Dirty Harriet on the body with the cherry Stetson
No not the Western
Hailing from the Eastern seaboard
That's word to me, you couldn't even see lord
Behind my eyes there lies a rugged man
Denominations in millions
Wrapped up in rubber band
Die with the gun in hand
Bronsonelli serve up a baby lamb smorgasbord
Big bosses, you peep the portraits in the corridor
Toke off a chalice
Switch to herbal ventilation
Misplacing families and shit through verbal devastation
