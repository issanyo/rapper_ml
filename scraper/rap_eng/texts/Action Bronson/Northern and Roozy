Turn me up a little bit, man
Just a little
Let me feel the summer breeze in my hair
Whip it, in the convertible
Queens shit
Cruising down Queens Blvd. by the mall
Go to get the Ices, yo

[Verse 1]

School is out, playing ball inside the park
Then the liquor and the weed is introduced after it's dark (uhh)
Playing spades in the back corner
Dick sucks in the crisp air, 'olas in the crisp pair
Of sneakers
That were designed for David Robby
Sleeping on the benches, all with good intentions
To wake up and do the same shit again
Everyday was like a week and it seemed to never end, and
Get the wrench, spray the hydrant in the street
When I seen that special girl, she had me flying on my feet (uhh)
Shirt wet, damn, I'm trying to hurt that
Two girls, one boy, want her to birth that
Years later though, we living in the moment
Caught up in the young love, kissing and the holding
Sharing lo mein, hit the A train to Rockaway
Plus she only lived a block away
Damn I miss her

[Hook 2x]

This summer love happened underneath the boardwalk
Souls in tune so there's never need for small talk
She held my heart, and no, she'd never leave my side
Through the years, through the struggle
Was a thing of pride

[Verse 2]

Slush puppies, cocoa, mango, cherry
Mexicans on Roosevelt
Pounding down the Chevy
Go to 1-6-1, to watch the Yankees play
Years later and I'm dealing with the family court shit
On the same block, pressure make the veins pop
Cop a forty dollar holler out of Bangkok
But I'm in Queens
Diversity the best
Yellow to the chocolate shorty's
Powders on their chest

[Hook 2x]
