[Intro: Action Bronson]
Lamb chops
Garlic
(What else?)
Herbs
(What else?)

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Flip this linguistic pimp shit
Left hand right side see stick shift
A-I-R inscription on the Pippen's
Baggy pants dance like Michael Bivins
Living good, the floor and the ceiling wood
Bath is marble, toilet seat is French
Heated for the middle of the night
Cause daddy gotta wake up early morning for a flight
See me with the gold frame intelligent thug
No prescription smoking weed is my addiction
Doctor said you need it for your condition
No more heavy lifting
I guess I need someone to help me take a piss then
Suck my dick and my balls at the same time
Me, Cakey and Pinky -- game time
Pop the black airs so I got the hangtime
Aged fine, like a Montrachet wine
86 the Mets won the ring
My father rocked the leather with the holster for the thing

[Verse 2: Chuck Inglish]
Put the iron to the Tommy, meeting with some clients
Working on the title pressing up a hundred thousand
Recording out in Maui, whatchu know about it?
Press the vinyl in Jamaica getting paper blowing vapor
Sew a stitch, showing niggas how it's s'possed to be tailored
Motor City rolling with me in an elegant way, nigga
Now understand what I say
Grip a wood steering wheels like a young Pimp C
Steady chopping up blades, Cardier wire frames
Hi top force ones and a clean ball fade
Switching whips, hopping outta something all-terrain
Four by fours grip the road more in the rain
Took the Eddie Bauer off and put it up in my name
Spell it: C-H-U-C-K
I-N-G-L-I-S-H
Come shop with me dog we'll be here all day, workin
