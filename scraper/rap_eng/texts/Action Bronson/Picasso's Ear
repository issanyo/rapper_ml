[Intro]
Sniff a little coke, please, don’t go to sleep yet
I kn-I-I know, I know
Pour some water on your face, do some jumping jacks
We about to leave, it’s me, it’s me, yo

[Verse 1]
Who could it be? It’s me, running down brick lane
With a visible limp (Uh), and an alligator pimp cane (Uh)
Rubies where the eyes go (Yeah), car so low (Yeah)
Gotta drive this slow (Yeah, yeah)
Black windows like we hiding, ho
Fuck the 5-0, unless we talking ‘bout the ‘Stang (Mustang)
Man, I’m just watching all these actors from the rafters like Sting
In the surveillance van, fucking with computers like Ving (Ving)
Hundred milli’, that’s a light ching, shoot him in the right wing

[Chorus]
Don’t wanna drink, don’t wanna smoke
Don’t wanna smoke no more
You fucking stupid? I’m tryna do all that shit
Don’t wanna smoke, don’t wanna drink
Don’t wanna drink no more
You fucking stupid? I’m tryna do all that shit

[Verse 2]
Listen, tiger, my shit fire (True), hard to forget like a thick Maya (Damn)
I like my mind a little bit higher (Higher)
I need the violin section tighter (Make it tight)
And if you need to drive the ‘Vette (What)
I left the keys by the tire, tiger (Thank you), just be humble
‘Cause if I punch you in the chest, you’ll do a hundred yard tumble (Uh)
Standing over victims like Mutumbo with the finger waving (No, no, no, no, no)
I’m such a motherfucking player
My hair should be in finger waves, uh (God damn)

[Chorus]
Don’t wanna drink, don’t wanna smoke
Don’t wanna smoke no more
You fucking stupid? I’m tryna do all that shit
Don’t wanna smoke, don’t wanna smoke
Don’t wanna smoke no more (What)
You fucking stupid (What)? I’m tryna do all that shit
I wanna drink, don’t wanna smoke, don’t wanna drink no more
You fucking stupid (What)? I’m tryna do all that shit (I know)
I wanna drink, I wanna smoke
Iwanna smoke some more (Some more)
Yeah, I’m tryna do all that shit
