[Hook - Meyham Lauren]
Thousand dollar gym shoes, it's us there
Silk headwraps in a plush bag, it's us there
You can catch us up in Mr. Chow's often
Brand name drugs that we flossin', Marvel

[Verse 1 - Meyham Lauren]
Peep the visual
Fly shit 40 years back
Mink to the floor, hoppin' out of Cadillac
Gators match the whip, hammers attached to hip
That's how my father move with honor on the Harlem strip
Fast forward I design, grime prime time
Let my mind intertwine with the skyline
Respectable, intellectual, but love shine
So everyday I try to win this, in my bloodline
Love crime negative shit, I'm quick to go legit
Just give me something legal, not evil, that I can flip
New York is foul, will greet you with a Desert Eagle rip
Shooters for hire, quick to fire for a half a zip
And fuck a glass, that's shit's the past
Use a carafe to sip
Transporters on a boat with coke inside a plastic hip
"How to Be a Stupid Nigga" is the class we skipped
Divy up after a flip and hit strippers with cash we split

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Action Bronson]
Spin blaster on the four, I'm from New York
We crash the sport just for sport
Dressed for court, bless the Lord
Drink chammy out of Prince's Grammy
My beard wavy like Sandy
Full moon, howlin' with the headdress
Push a Beamer like a bench press
One leg up, rockin' some red sweats
Bedspreads with African models on them
Open they pussy, put a bottle in it for them
Bitches jump in my balls like a McDonald's park
I'm at the forum, stacking paper, plural
If we were locked up, we'd move to Doral
You'd be abused for oral
And just continue as if things were normal
Not a peep, my people drive a lot of Jeeps
A bunch of creeps, cannons hidden under seats
Sell salmon, so my son can eat
Trying to have a little taste of this life until I'm underneath
It's me
