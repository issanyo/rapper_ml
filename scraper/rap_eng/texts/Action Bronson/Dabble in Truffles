[Action Bronson]
Right out the weed spot
Bronsonelli fresh smoke a square bag
Pants sag over wally on the grandstand
Handstanding hookers at the Hilton
Aged meat sizzle to perfection paired it perfect with the fine Stilton
Rumpelstiltskin, butter on the leather
Fila on the footwear my mind is on the cheddar better
I keep my head up
Get it like a set up
Bitch, its Bronsonelli never see me in no get up homie
Only the ruggish shit people that im fucking with will rip your shortys nipple off her body for the fun of it
Order brunch sip a spritzer wit the summer mint
Roll a double dutch sour diesel smoke a ton of it
Duck from air to the plate
Roasted to perfection just like joey do to grams of the weight
We smoke heavy
Ain't a motherfucker on my levy
Keep the medal to the metal like a 97 Chevy
2010 got em buzzing like a beeper
Round table discussions conference in Geneva leaders
At the table polly over nasal
47 minutes since the time i lit the basil
My rhymes are carte blanche in the Oscars
Extra virgin olive oil drizzled on the pastas
Fry the bacon make it sizzle for the hostage
Honoring this thing of ours living like the mobsters
My compliments go to the chef and thats the real
Crew of goonies in the joint we need some extra veal
You know the caddy got a extra wheel
And if im ever in a pickle lock a hand ill fucking tech the steel
Take aim and knock an apple of your head
And imma play like polamalu you get tackled for the bread
Running in your crib your shortys shackled to the bed
Money laying on the persian leaking plasma from the lead
