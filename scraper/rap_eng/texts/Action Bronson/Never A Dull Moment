[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Up in the hospity, know my philosophy
Smoked duck, power meetings at the Brasserie
Lose your posture, fuckin' with the doctor
Decker injector, livin' off the nectar
The fruits of life I got the sweet tooth
Young Sweet Jones, champagne Caddy with the green roof
Trunk slammed down, '85 Biarritz
Lungs are filled with earth, play the Garden like the Knicks
My mind is on the fritz, tatted diamonds on the tits
The John Cougar Mellancamp
I spit the shit to get the fellas amped
I got the voice to make the ladies moist
And soon I'll have this papi hoppin' out the hazy Royce
Mix it up in a blender there's no contender
The drug stick I smoke is never slender
Like Jimi with the Fender hit the wah-wah pedal
But in the Beamer doin' donuts parkin' lot of the arena, Bronsolinio

[Hook: Action Bronson]
You see us shine, never a dull moment
Cause we some Dons like Hathaway, until we pass away
Laid in the earth with my mink and my drink
Good smoke with some linen shorts, baby what you think? Uhh


[Verse 2: Termanology]
I'm in the 50's hot rod that my daddy made
I could see my reflection in the candy paint
My little pony runnin' off my Polo shirt
If I had all the money that I sold and work
I could buy a Dr. Dre beat and a house
Couple diamond chains, make sure I'm standin' out
Gucci man shirt, Slick Rick appetite
Platinum plus on the Hush, smooth Gladys Knight
On my Bun B shit, keep it extra trill
Couple dollars in the stash for the extra bills
I could understand why I ain't made it yet
Cause even though I'm nice, I wasn't livin' correct
And I'm livin' in debt, but I'll live to progress
I'm trynna see my daughters ballin' in a private jet
So whatever it takes, I'm soon to handle that
I'll trade my soul, I just want to have my grandma back

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I was born to lead, I was born to fly
Yes sky high like a Houston Rocket look in my eye
In space like NASA, and I ain't slowin' down
I'm goin' faster fuck the system sayin' no to master
My liquid flow is plasma, I'm Terminator 2
I terminate a crew of two to say I paid a due
Dummies I laid a few down, and I done shook a few clowns
Overthrew a couple rap crews and took a few crowns
But it wasn't for status, just had to show them suckers who's the baddest
That poison flow straight from the Black Addis
So holla back at us, cause we ain't goin' nowhere
We go to war with no care so homie don't you go there
II Trill and it ain't just a name
Oh yeah we famous but we ain't do this shit just for fame, guess again
We trynna open up a new lane and new doors
And for that I'm willin' to fight a few wars, is you boys?
