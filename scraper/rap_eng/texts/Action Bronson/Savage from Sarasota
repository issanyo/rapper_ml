[Intro/Sample: Macho Man Randy Savage & Arsenio Hall]

I'm the Tower of Power
Too sweet to be sour
I'm funky like a monkey
Sky is the limit
And space is the place

Hello!

[Verse 1]

Yo, as the clouds shift over and cover half of the moon up
The smoke leave my lungs
That's my jam, turn the tunes up
2nd Avenue, cruising in a beamer
Holding ninas, my feets are featured in a Fila shoe
Time to get mine, never see me standing in a breadline
Never bedtime cause I'm a headline
From here to Portugal, kick it like Ronaldo
Mustache like Geraldo
Let the money pile, ho
Yay high
I'm on fire like a gay guy
But pause that
Raw rap, break your thorax
Long, White dick inserted in your whore's back
I'm fucking hookers straight from Kazakhstan- Borat

[Midtro/Sample: "Macho Man" Randy Savage]

I'm a Chameleon, yeah, huh uh
Chameleon?
Uh Huh!, yeah!
I'm talking about the beat goes on, yeah
And the beat goes on, yeah
And the beat goes on

[Verse 2]

I smell the ocean cause I'm near the coast
Queens breakfast
In the streets you could hear the toast pop
Probably over some butter
In a penthouse, but I rose from the gutter
Where's my money?
Cut a finger, send it home to your mother
Bring your visors back
Skin fades, beards with Giambi lenses
Big Walkmans, yellow ones, the Sports shit
Bow to my portrait
Thousands of horses
That laid under the hood that's in the back of the Porsche
War stories from my people that survived 'em
Bitches sucking dick that's on arrival
Paralyze your spinal cord
For smoking drugs, I'm on the honor roll
Don't get arrested
Stuffed the rest in her punana hole
This shit is wunderbar
Hard top, 740 German
'94, copping soccer cleats out of Herman's
Laying in the grass
Out the basket, eating grapes
Shorty throwing signs that she wet below the waist
Swinging like beyond wall, geishas in the corner
Bronson like a spy, giving facials in the sauna
Snap my fingers, waiters come
Smoking with the lazy lung
Every kind of drug is on deck like a Navy gun
War stance, one call will make a broad dance
And then the pussy coming right up out your whore's pants
No romance, it's straight brutal
Body sumo, biting bitches like I'm Cujo
The lane switcher, the grain gripper
The soft, leather seat sitter
Head while I'm on the shitter
Bette Midler
Flushing, Queens death spitter
Donnie Baseball, standing on the left hitter

[Outro/Sample: Macho Man Randy Savage]

Macho Man is right now
So sweet as honey
Macho Man is on a roll and he can't be stopped, no
Elizabeth understands what I'm talking about, yeah
Uh huh!
