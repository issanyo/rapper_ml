[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Yo, brown Napoleon Dynamite, white Dolemite
Sho' Ya Right, Holy Moly, totally tight
White America, good morning Erykah
Badu, where are you at?
Allahu Akbar, do that, do that, do that
Do-do that that that
Do do do, do do that
Do that, show that, pro-black, pro-brown
Down, round, getting down, down
Yippee-kai-yai-yay, it's a showdown
Girls say chill, you ain't too cool to be nice to boo-boo
You right, you right, you right, true, true
Sorry if I'm acting too cuckoo
All the zoom zoom got me acting like there's flowers in my doo doo
I'mma roll the dice for some new shoes
If that don't work then, boo hoo
At least you couldn't say I never grew two
If I can't win, then it's lose-lose
Do it for the kids like Blue's Clues
Choo-choo-choose to be
Half-asshole, half-bashful
Uh, give me like half a glass full
Or maybe a quarter that
I'm like a black quarterback
In the motherfucking... oh shit, bobbing, ducking
Weaving, passing and running
Passing and running, passing and running
Like a caravan
Um, wait, what was it?
I don't even know, buddy
Exactly

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
As my grandma knits the sweater
Chickens with the cheddar
Timbos and yarmulkes, you ain't in my genre
Bitch, blow me: harmonica
Arts and leisure, peace to Jon Caramanica
Sam Sifton rate the plate that we feasting on
I jerk my penis off at the precinct, dog
Since a youth, all proposals been indecent, dog
Sense of humor so I'm down for a comedic song
Rub my dick like my zipper when I walk
Touch of Down's Syndrome, flip it when she talks
Gums are purple, teeth monkey
Her look is mix with streetwalker and a junkie
