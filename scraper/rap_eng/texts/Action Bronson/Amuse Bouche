[Verse 1: Action Bronson]

I been fly since the Big Bossman feud with the Mountie
Bobby Bacalhau, crocodile, know the proper style
Curtis Martin run the rock in for the Jets yo
I would watch my older cousins makin' profits on the steps, made my mind up
Never see me hustlin' for Honda's, Eyes are on the Zonda, eyes low from puffin ganja
My fuckin life is like a ghetto drama, sip the green tea
Polish off the metal cause we men of honor
You see the P, left side of the Cardigan sweaty
Well now you know that I'm a rocker like Marty Jannetty
The low shit, kill the pussy with the whole dick
Slicker than the oil on the marble with the flow shit
Hard bottoms cat's be clickin' like the horses do
We just dined, but I'm down to take your portion too
Smoke a few sticks, poke a few tricks
Shave the points off the game call it Blue chips
This ain't Shaq an penny action squeeze the Mac elevy
Tsunami lyric from the inner corner crack the levy
Snake the hash cause my skills tight pair the salmon with the dill right
Grab your hammer and hold your shield tight

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
My life is inches from death I blow the piff on the step
Spit the phlegm, hold my dick when I rap, plus the suede feet
Play the street, hear the music of the city lights flashin
With high fashion and some nice titties
Drug dealers sell the drugs are for realin
Angry mothers cuff there children when they walk in the buildin'
We stand tall, like the great wall i'll never fall
Disobey the law, summer spring and fall don't forget the winter
Before Splinter and the turtles, rock the lightweight
Lo' jacket with the man, hopin the hurdle vicious with verbal
Stuffed inside your bitch is a gerbil, seven platters on the table
Dutch's filled up with herbal, grow accustom to the fast life
Raise the glass, tap the glass twice now they flick the picture
Cause we passed nice Peace to Queens though heavy on the C-note
Ricky Steamboat one love Bronsolinio
