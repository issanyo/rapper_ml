Chorus:

Gold days
Give them away
The whole town was burning, burning, burning
Gold days
Give them away
The whole town was burning, burning, burning

[Verse 1: Mr. Probz]

Riding in this hooptie with the rust stains
Trying to get a buck off of this cocaine
I'm day dreaming all day, hoping that I can wake up
Lounging in my castle with the windows all draped up
And my pockets all caked up, no stress
Guess I'm gonna have to wait until I'm dead to get some rest huh
You know the mirror never lies
My girl giving me hell because I ain't hearing her cries
She call me 5 or 6 times on the phone and I ain't replied
I'm a young man with dreams, nothing in between
I told myself one day that I would understand the bigger scheme
If you come from where I came from you know what I mean
Those were them

Chorus:

Gold days
(I could never)
Give them away, away
(I made sure)
The whole town was burning, burning, burning
(Those were them)
Gold days
(I could never)
Give them away, away
(I made sure)
The whole town was burning, burning, burning

Verse 2: Action Bronson]

Sunny weather, people with you, when it's clouds they run for cover
The one that stood beside me was my motherfucking mother
Moving on to better days, put my kids through college
Your mind is young, copping Jordans, eating chicken wings
Trophy case filled, you fucking with a winner
I'm at a roaring boil, other suckers simmer
You see my shirt it's expensive like the dinner
That's why I rock a bib motherfucker because it's linen
I only talk about what I know and some other shit
You on some angel eyes, sneaky undercover shit
Intricate plots constructed during boredom
I'm in the streets from Kissena out to Fordham
Peace to my family I hold you down forever
I love my children's mother even though we're not together
All I ask is honesty, ayo honestly
Fuck around and we could've been a dynasty

Chorus

Gold days
(I could never)
Give them away, away
(I made sure)
The whole town was burning, burning, burning
(Those were them)
Gold days
(I could never)
Give them away, away
(I made sure)
The whole town was burning, burning, burning
