[Intro]
Yeah (You don't even know me)
Yeah, yeah, ah (You don't even know me)
Ah-ha (You don't even know me)
It's me, yeah (You don't even know me)

[Verse 1]
Yo, these sixteen bars cost sixteen cars
Kiss these balls, bitch, we stars
Fuck that shit, you ain't hot like Prince
You got a little shine, but not like this
Time crumbles when the jet black M5 rumbles
All from what I did last summer?
But motherfuckers forget, till I'm back up on the set
And every motherfucking jump shot wet
Same outfit every day like a cartoon (That's me!)
Uh, they'll never find you in a shark soup (Nope)
And there will never be a part two
Shit, you're looking at some motherfucking art, boo

[Verse 2]
Two pumps from the inhaler got me feeling like Lawrence Taylor
Two kisses on the cheek for my tailor (Mwah!)
I got the soul of an Amazon healer
Better be sure to put them cameras on (Please)
Turn dreams into real shit
Yeah, I might be sick
Sitting court side, I'm likely lit
Draw blood, I'm already made (Uh)
But little man will cut your face like wedding cake (Aaah!)

[Chorus]
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
You don't even know me

[Bridge]
Switchin' lanes on these bitches like (Whoop!)
Switchin' lanes on these bitches like (Whoop!)
Watch the fifth wheel fall
From this top floor view, I can see it all
Yeah, man
From this top floor view, I can see it all
I can see it all, uh

[Verse 3]
I started clapping when the chef brought the duck to the table (Phenomenal!)
Uh, that shit was shining like an angel (Whoo!)
I never trust a dude named Angel (Nah)
Long steel 4/5s turn him to an angel
The sky opened up and down came me
Young AB, floatin' in a Jag from the '80s (Uh)
Tanned like I just left Haiti (Uh)
Looking like I had mad plastic surgery (Aaah! Damn)
They turned Bam Bam Chinese
And that's fine by me (True)
Shit, I need some time to realign my chi (So?)
So bitch, please pass that bombazee
Before I get upset

[Chorus]
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
