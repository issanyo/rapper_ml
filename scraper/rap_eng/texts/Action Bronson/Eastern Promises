Grip-a-matic, strip an addict
Right to her Skivvie's
Muthafucka, whip a batter
Make one false move, all your shit'll shatter
Serve this long, White dick
Shit'll shift her bladder
Shift the gears, grab the engine
Make the pigeons scatter
Cop my fam a bunch of cribs
And make them millions matter
Coming straight up out of Queens
The clique is getting fatter
Pop your head right off your neck
And drip forensic matter
Eastern Promises
My whole conglomerate, acknowledge it
Any second could blow on some Osama shit
Obama money on the plastic
Cop a sandwich
.45 describe the weapons that get brandished
I'm pulling strings like a bass player
That tastes paper
Conduct business like a gentleman
The K scraper
Cruise the city for some chicken with some great flavor
Not talking Disney, slip a Mickey, then I date rape her
Jumpsuits and sandals
We all superintendents, goonies and henchmen
No reason to get stupid, offended
Cause we ignorant people
Two headed eagle
From the mountains
[?]
Brew the beer like the muthafucking ruler's here
I'm the one that's known to hold the big cajones here
Mixed breed like a muthafucking cougar bear
Play the corner like I'm Bodie for the coupe to stare

Bronsolino, Brosolovsky, the Ali Bronsoni, Uhh, yo, Outdoorsmen, one
