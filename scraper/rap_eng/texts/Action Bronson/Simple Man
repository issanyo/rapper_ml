[Verse 1]
Hailing from parts unknown
Smoke and an Ice-O-Later
Spanish women in the crib they making rice for later
Wash the chicken in the sink then they pat it dry
Then they hit it with Adobo
My face is global
You're like a homo
My blood is pure I'm bred noble
Getting head up on a red sofa
Do a cartwheel in the Jag door
My shorts sag to the floor
Extra virgin olive oil up my ankle bone
Visit the bank with the chrome
Then have a banquet in a Rome
Five hours later in the tank top at home with my feet up
Abusing drugs
Using Susans
With two midgets naked for my amusement
You understand me?

[Hook]
As my drug rise quick, all my homies got a cup
Reliving all the days when no one even gave a fuck
Matching college sweatsuits hopping out the truck
Knee her in the stomach, drugs are dropping out her butt

[Verse 2]
Blow a few stacks on the capture
Even more for the statue
Portraits in Africa
My shirt protected by napkins
Catch me in Paris paper thin leather on a pleasant day
S'il vous plaît have my money
Ain't nothing funny
Legs crossed smoking Dunhills
We been to Brussels
Been to Holland
Rolling joints as thick as columns
Anything I want is fifty dollars
Twist ignition keys
You see me where the river be, floating
Big coat, toasting
White grapes in flute glasses
Hold a belt in two classes
I'm known to chief that green, Robert Parish
Shifting new coupes, lavish colored stewed cabbage
Young and ravishing galloping with the cavalry
Exotic parrots, you perish you’re like a parody
I’m in the galley of the ship cooking scrambled eggs up
On some Casey Ryback shit from "Under Siege"
Throwing darts like Byron Leftwich
Serve a fiend a continental breakfast out the building off the steps
Five series beamer wagon filled with Hess
Protect mine like eagles with the nest
I'm out for justice

[Hook]
As my smoke rise quick, all my homies got a cup
Reliving all the days when no one even gave a fuck
Matching college sweatsuits hopping out the truck
Knee her in the stomach, drugs are dropping out her butt
