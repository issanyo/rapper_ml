[Intro: Action Bronson]
Yeah yeah (uh-huh)
It's me, it's me (uh-huh)
I was hatched in '83 (yeah)
Fuckin' standin' like the Notre Dame logo right now
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Just leave this shit, man

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
If I choose the right horse (uhh) I'mma buy a white Porsche (uhh)
Never take the night off (uhh) I'm sayin' that my mind's off (uhh)
Ever since I came out (uhh) I been handin' pain out (uhh)
Fold a wire hanger through your nose, take your brain out
Hey now, on the stage, I'm like great balls of fire (uhh)
One more year, I'll be on Lake George retired (just one)
Big steak like a Jeep tire (uhh)
Season up some biceps and throw 'em in the deep fryer

[Hook: Action Bronson]
I been high since I was this big, yeah, uhh
I been high since I was this big, stupid

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I'm sick like feedin' squirrels the summer in a bubble jacket
If this was '96, I def' had The Tunnel packed in (it's true)
Big beard like I'm lumberjackin' (uhh)
Mash the pedal of the 850, sound like the thunder crackin'
I'm in a club with a condom on (hahaha)
All Under Armour on (yeah)

[Hook 2: Big Body Bes]
And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Microphone attached to my head so I can dance my little heart out
Don't make me bring the white guitar out
Like the one in Wayne's World, that was shinin' in the window
Since 13, I been a nympho, uhh
Fuck, That's Delicious on box set
Me and my mans smokin' on big drugs and feasting on the ox leg
Stand in the store with twenty Ahmed's (a-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!)
Bazookas on shoulders, hundred pounds of C4 in a stroller
Z4s roll up, shit's cold, I think I need a ricola
I just dropped a million kroner, I'm a stoner (uhh)
You lack culture, I'm a psychedelic image of a black vulture
Trapped inside a past soldier, uhh (It's me)

[Break: Action Bronson]
I just blew my motherfuckin' high, man (ho!)
Holy shit
I been high since I was this big, motherfucker

[Hook 2: Big Body Bes]
And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW

[Outro: Big Body Bes]
Albanian style, I wanna die by machine gun
(A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!)
