[Intro]
Bam Bam, Bronsolino
Closed Sessions
Queens shit, Chicago

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Bitches kissing me the French way, now suck my son’s dick
He only four, when he twenty he gon’ run shit
Suede suit, waves spinning ‘cause he half black
But for now he need his blanky for his nap nap
Snapback, Knicks starter hat, ninety four
Signed by Mason, Queens domination
Green tea’s got my eyes kind of Asian
Like the bitches Dante Ross be tying in his basement

Hold the fuck up man
(yo, nah, nah, we can’t even do it like this man)
Yo we gotta give it to ‘em the right motherfucking way man
(here we go)
You didn’t come all this way for nothing right?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
You either got it or you don’t, the ratings say I’m through the roof
Leather gloves grip the wood wheel
Have my shorty make a good meal, smoking cabbages
Rocking fabrics, sport the big beard like I’m Arabic
Uh, motherfuckers see the Halibut
And put some lemon on the side to clean my palate with
Summer radishes, chicken down at Gladys’
Down at BlackBird with hoodies and some Balances
Running and gunning, I’m Randall Cunning, my skin is stunning
Butt like an onion, she order lobster I’m hitting something
Mouth or butt, maybe pussy, smoking cookie
Girl scouts that ain’t never went the church route
Plane lands, Chicago be the destination
Five courses, gorgeous on the presentation
Roam the streets where Capone was at the throne
I write these lyrics with the music from my phone
I’m a young Mike Singletary, style shitty like a dingleberry
Push the bent like I’m Richard Dent
Steve McMichael, Paxson with the 3
You know my jacket flashing fashion pass the D

Damn man, I’m out of fucking breath
(yeah man)
You gotta give me another second because uh
(I’m a fat fuck man)
Honestly I’m a overeater and I’m not even allowed to eat
(I’m a little bit heavy and overweight)
Just give me one second
(y’all don’t even know I’m starved, I’m starved)
Alright, I-I’m in, I’m in

[Outro]
FILA cream three-quarter dipping over your Greek daughter
Pussy tasting like Kadaif, honey mixture with the sweetwater
Sweet water
Yo
Queens shit man
I love you
Goodbye
