[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Motherfucker, know you hear me
Bam Bam, the Bronco, white one
Queens shit
Motherfucking World Cup starts today
You better be watching that shit in Spanish
Pussy

[Verse]
You can keep your little bullshit advance, understand?
I’m in the Amazon chewing on plants
Motherfuckers can’t afford me
Plus, I’m in the middle of this orgy and send me back in like 40
Shit, I live so much, no time for looking back, only up
'Cause there’s no roof on the truck, you could shoot a duck
I know that’s cruel as fuck, and, no, I wouldn’t recommend it
Did I mention? The Porsche 911 got a second engine
Send your boy into the Seventh Dimension, shit
Hell is cheap, baby, Heaven’s expensive though
Yours truly, ‘bout to get this paper like Judge Judy
Told my baby, “Come do me”, all these drugs just run through me
Now I’m shredding the guitar on a mountain
God damn, something groovy
Aw, man, we lost ‘em to the lights again
Bitch, don’t worry, I’ll be back like lightning
Just don’t blink ‘cause you might miss me
I’m about to make history, raise your motherfucking fist for me
And let your middle finger fly up and grab your nut sack
And scream, “Fuck that”, you hear me?
