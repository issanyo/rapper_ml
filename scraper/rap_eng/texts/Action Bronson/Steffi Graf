[Intro: Niko Is]
That's soft thats good
I go by the name "Niko Is" and I am accompanied by Mister Action Bronson. And tonight we're going to be the leaders of the night
We are going to be robbing. We are going to smoke a lot of weed

[Verse 1: Niko Is]

This is chill cosby
Spike my hot chocolate with kaluha at the ski lodge
Smoke tree logs with G.I.s from RI Isle
Husteling hard, covering up. Just like hijab. (bitch)
I'm bubbeling up with a slut who just loves to eavesdrop
Hit Buenos Aires for skirt steak/Every second is a purp break
I open the legs of a mermaid/In that pussy is my birthplace
Road head in that mercedes...from a bird brain in the third lane
Order beats, cuz it is a sure thang
Hippie shit: I surf waves (biatch)
Serve me an ACE, i'm on that Steffi Graf
Andre Agassi gon' fight me when I check that ass
I'm more like Guga, Turkey sandwich with smoked Gouda
Get a medical work done in Cuba, Underwater weed like Scuba,
Smell beef in the air, Scream in my ear
I air it out...Like a season premiere
My to-do: see a Guru like a DJ Premiere
It's me on a mirror.....UH
Smoking big joints with Action Bronson
I'm too sick for this shit like Magic Johnson

[Hook:]

On the ball like a Messi pass Rock the stash like Jesse Jacks
If you're trying to be sexy with me: to my (my) left be passed
Experimental lesbians/Avian and Betty Ann
Drink harder and smoke heavy grass (D-drink harder smoke heavy grass)
Serve me an Ace, I'm on that Steffi Graf
Serve me an Ace, I'm on that Steffi Graf
Serve me an Ace, I'm on that Steffi Graf

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]

Pull the drug from out of my butt crack
Sell them to all of my bucks back
Pretty women I lust at...Divin all up in they musk rat
I wanna touch that. Come and have a seat on my moustache
You don't need a buspass (bitch).I just wanna is bust that ass
When you see me, just do a split immediately (body)
You lookin sickly, Left-handed is how I'm shifting...
In that 5-40i Beamer Wagon
Slam like that British Bulldog,you see me tannin'
Rim spinning like the gyro meat,Serving like Bj√∂rn Borg
I stand still because in pants I've got that long sword
Lay on your back and give me brain because I'm on tour (please)
Lift a curtain, it's a new car (you pick the wrong door)
So if you stand within three feet of my body, Your body
Will be all over the lobby cuz of the shotty
And uh...that ain't no prolly pocket, 8ball of the bobby (smoke)
You smell punani. I'm mummy wrapped in ganji

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Digg it, man?
Yeah!
This is Chill Cospy
