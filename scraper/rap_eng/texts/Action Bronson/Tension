[Intro]
Attention all robots
Commence stage two of the attack
[?] robots open fire
Attention all robots

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Grimy shit, severe ties over pleasure rhymes
Five deep, ten burners plus eleven knives
Roll supreme, blowing steam how my niggas ride
I don't smoke but I take a shot of homicide
Pardon me Hennessy clear thought remedy
Two for one special, best friend your worst enemy
Fly shit, pedigree
Way past allegedly
Pimp style, big wile, bag 'em and they pleasure me
Hard work will take me to places that you'll never be
Found the book of life but it's written eligibly
I wrote the script again to get this paper heavily
Heavenly hell bound somewhere in between
Stuck in a routine wide awake in a dream
Scratch that, sleepwalking in reality
Think about tomorrow but I live my life hourly
Stay humble but I view myself powerfully
I'm a be official til the elements devour me

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Light cigars like a new father
To the chest like Junior Seau in a blue Charger
Barbell lifts, my Lat muscle flexes
Caramel chick, the ass straight from Texas
Fuck, straight tornado in my man's hair
Bitch put the potato in the blam blam
Bam Bam chopped like a Van Dam hand
Quick to put you in a sandman van
Make your shawty lift her leg up like can-can dance
Every time I'm up to bat I'm in a grand slam stance
Lay in France, two bitches in a hammock
Tell her go warm up the banana
(Goodbye)

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Call me coach, my approach is to wrap 'em all
?You the reefer ball? on the back splat, hit the bar
Brawl 'til the knuckles bleed, buckle up, see the speed
Brittle bitches crumble like the kush when I roll the weed
I'm a chief, you're a queef, that's a pussy sound
Take a look around - you're surrounded by the pussy hounds
Pound for pound, crown for crown, I will on the cipher
Blowing trees to the bone like the [?] piper
The highlight of the night, get your highlighter
See my words in the cloud, Mr Skywriter
I get the prep and steppin' up to a new challenge
Dancing on the scene and Lionel Richie with a new balance
Eye to eye, toe to toe with the hatin' faces
More than murder makin' lages like we tradin' places
Got you wrapped in a knot like some tight laces
Good night!
