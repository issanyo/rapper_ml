[Meyhem Lauren]
Slap tracks with acrylics
I told ya'll dudes to fall back, we the illest
Well dressed rap gorillas
Gettin sucked off in villas is a typical act
Devour yellow tail and kimchi watchin' presents get wrapped
Attract fly bitches currency
Cop kicks urgently
Strip club savage, C-Section scar surgery
Shorties get scooped straight tape
Turn into movie stars
Seen with Constantine and Bronsolin wildin' in nudie bars
But not a ?? ocean self windin at the time I risk it
Water resistant, luckily, bitches be gettin' fisted
Bought bottles in Selina's with schemers, these days I miss it
It's bout to be a wrap but not how Mayan math predicted
It's not the end, more like a new beginning
Peep my frame it's drenched in linen, keep my name attached to winnin'
Silk shirts with decorative prints and scribbled cardigans
My life's progressin', never stressin'
??

[AG Da Coroner]
I was born on a planet full of righteous people and scumbags
Smart dykes, dumb fags and toe tags
Motherfuckers with no regards for your life
And little hungry children that'll kill you for rice
Down syndrome carriers, African midgets
Full blown AIDS babies born with no digits
Swine flu spreadin' through the air
Cancer patients with no hair
Chemotherapy stares with no glare
Crooked officers, heroes who fight fires
Undercover friends who beg you to wear wires
Crackhead mechanics that are nice with the pliers
Dudes who speak truths and natural born liars
Kings and Queens, bums and street walkers
Women with game, professional sweet talkers
Ten million rappers, twenty million actors
Militant black folk and racist white crackers
Coca fiends had my team from Killa Queens
Meetin' where time moves, head in a guillotine
That's the story of the world, raw dog
And mama still cookin' up the breakfast with no pork
Righteous

[Action Bronson]
Eatin' sushi off a black hooker
Crunchin' numbers in the math booklet
She had the panties with the pussy cut out
Jewish holidays she bake the bread
Then she twist the hash
Get her high, take her straight to bed
I'm divin' in
Ridin' in
V12, twin turbo on the Gaza strip
With the ivory wheel, rockin' Iversons
No practice, I'm classic, you bastard
We front flip in limo windows
Sip the limocello
See the pig, somersault into a dismount
Off the uneven bars and throw my hand straight up
Fuck around, sprain my ankle with the next maneuver
I'm, one in a million, play the pavillion
Get my paper or the razor get displayed to your children
We hire Asians for killing, ready able and willing
Getting payed in the building

[Despot]
Did what I had to do
Either starve or snatch your food
Had to choose the latter on some
"Are you eating that?" I'm rude
Ransack a platter, smash and grab till all the fat get chewed
Bout to be as fat as Captain Lou over the gabbagool
Catch a dude on the street, road or avenue
Flashin' tools to frickassee these rappers fou fou attitudes
Pulled out a hat and poof! Magically vanish you
Abracadabra, turn some caskets into matching suits
Can't knock the hustle, bustle or tussle
Can't stop the scuffle, you can't top the muscle
Land shots and shove a couple knuckles in your muzzle
Hands hot, to tuck you in land plots with shovels
Die in a car crash, loot the whole rhyme stash
Six million ways to keep the game at bay and on smash
Four comrades who dine in hundred yard dash
Sit next to the Gods just for contrast
You beyotches
