[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yeah, nights from Norway
Hookers in the hallway
Fiends tap dancin' on the strip like its Broadway
Ash the hundred dollar joint, inhale the info
Ten percents on the limo, doin indos, farm raised goat
Yo, farm raised goat, arm length tucked in the coat
Old 6 series bucket approach, 3 stripes on the leather
Powder puffin her nose, say you feel my pain
Really muthafucka you don't, I'm on some outtabody
Out of body with the Shaman in the jungle
Never cry over curdled milk, dip in convertible
Rock the leather neck, full length Persian twill
Shoot the trouble on the company by herbal pill
Gotta get it, gotta gotta gotta get it quick
Fuck her good, or she on to look for better dick
I'm off the hook dawg you fuckin with a veteran
Think different express my sentiment
Put you in the sediment

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Yo, yo, play me never
Seats in the Mercedes is leather
See she think she bad, they ain't nuttin' you can tell her
Uh, I ain't no regular nigga
If you see me with a bitch, you know she lucky I'm wit' her
She know she lucky I'm wit' her
Like a hungry muhfucka wit' a bucket of chicken
Heels is clickin, from Beverly Hills to Hell's Kitchen
The twenty cells spells lifted
The TECs held different, the sex is a given
The fishscale sniffed off of dishes
Uh, murda material, Uh, the .38 scrape the serial
We sat down and ate cereal
Uh, muhfuckas are like sound boy burial
Fly face tone, steel vagina Grace Jones
My favorite clothes, My ace in the hole
Some basic ho im never takin her home
My statue naked in Rome
The 650 Beamer run 80 alone

Switch whips, 456
456, Switch whips
456, 456
Switch whips, 456
