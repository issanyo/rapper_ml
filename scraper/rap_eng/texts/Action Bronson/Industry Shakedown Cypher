[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo, yo, my man Troy, he used to jump over his own foot
Jump into a spin and give a grin that left them hoes shook
At that time, my jeans were baggy with the hoody
Back on Main Street, the maxi-single, copped it at the Goody
Up in the room, writing graffiti for hours
Dreams of being in a tower with Nia Long in the shower
Sucking my dicky like a pacifer
Now it's 2009, pussy, so pass the fire
They get the bastard higher
5'6", 260, I'm a destroyer
Got it with class, Dali paintings inside the foyer
To keep it all kosher, I'm strictly Jewish on the lawyer
When it comes to my freedom, I can't trust it to a goyim

Yo, I can't leave it up to a goyim

[Verse 2: Solace]
Yo, yo, Bermuda Triangle beat black out
Black Hole flow deep, can't see back out
So once you in, you in
Niggas speaking clout or reroute
And keep your heaters out the pouch
Once you see what we're about
No doubt
The organs make a nigga feel it in his organ
Honor the slogan saying we're never gonna soften
Single momma's put into the coffin kind of often
Conducting business dirty, then turn you into an orphan
It's simple as that, detonate your own system
The accurate aim, contacts it won't miss him
The poem shift him off his feet
But the chrome lift him
For talking out the side of their mouth like a stroke victim
And four fifth him
And bounce with the knot up in the sock
And trade your four chrome rims for four cinder blocks
The mic maestro, precise knife flow
Why debate? Just bite the bait, nigga
You might strike gold
Nigga, what

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
I run with old school New York shooters like Greg Anthony
Second hand gun smoke can't cancer me
It's all good then
I'mma keep the same friends
Classic timepiece, hopping out a strange Benz
With dame, duckets, yeah, young cool mill
Stacks copped the salmon skin, silver DeVille
My mind's sick but my dress code's ill
Sneakers got AIDS, they need more than a pill
Self employed, shirts have Typhoid
Beefs annoy, don't get destroyed (what!)
By this New York menace
Cock Glocks, pop shots, turn your face to a blemish
I does this, once a back block apprentice
My work will numb a nigga's mouth like a dentist
Go and ask OG's how we rock
My rhymes come back, I don't re-rock
He hot, correct, if it's Meyhem Lauren
Flow like a 9, work like a 10
Shoe size a 12, main chick a 8
Side bitch a 7 but her pussy is great
Get it straight, outsmart you and stomp you
Intelligent ape
I'm a G you're a fake like a planned mistake
Lobster claw in my paw, other hand on steak
Polo Blue, Hennessy, yeah you smell me
My gun game's meaner than Leona Helmsley
Rhymes are crimes, 9's, AK's
An unused tech in the box that just sprays
.38's more special than Mavado
Medallion money, we call that helado
If my ? special, my .44 is like a brand new king conquistador
Mutha, yo, yo, ayo

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
700 dollar bottle of that Montrachet
Far and away, extraordinary bar display
Gil Grissom, look beyond the Solar System
Draw it all into a square until you find what's missing
Take your time cause patience is your best friend
Simmering at the importance of it sets in
Prep your area, sterilize your work tools
Foul living, never seen up on the church stools
I'm still sporting my shorts until the dead of winter
The charismatic, the dope addict, The Shredder, Splinter
Roll the magic, feeling like I'm cuffed in the water
How the fuck I manage, roll in the quarter, slaughter
Many cattle, many times for pleasure
Modeling the skin while I'm searching for the treasure
Keep astute, sink your body deep into the coupe
Or theyâ€™ll soon to find you asleep in that suit
Shoot, the Big Dipper
The golden candy Caddy tipper
Close my eyes
Back in time trying to murder Hitler
My mind and rhymes aligned with the solar signs
Dinosaurs being, something, barrels holding wine
Layers of cake, fiends up in Okeechobee Lake
Freshwater pike be on a player plate
