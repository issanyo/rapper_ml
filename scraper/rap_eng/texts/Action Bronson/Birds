(Verse: 1-Edward Joziff)
My eye’s on a slanted edge like a ginsu
My fury taken out by the point of this pencil
I swear kid’s in my town can’t be respectful
Even though rhyming is my central utensil
I mean, even though i’m white
The truth is I have a hip hop complexion
When it comes to the best i’m the obvious selection
Standing up to the authorities like an insurrection

{Hook}
Like a bird I wish could fly
Only way to survive is to get extra high
I’m not a thug so turn that six into a nine
Always staying fly, and the god Ra stays embedded in my eye

(Verse: 2-Edward Joziff)
Precaution because during wrestling I suffered from exhaustion
I’m the boss-man also i'm woke in other words i'm conscious
Out for auction my icy  like stone cold Steve Austin
The truth is that i’m a man of my word
I see all with my eye’s and I blink with my third
Also to return the password to your heart is truly absurd
That’s just what I overheard

{Hook}

(Verse: 3-Edward Joziff)
Getting swole like i'm consuming enzymes
Ever since the 47th i've been writing these rhymes
I'm the offspring of Steez and i’ll follow in his footsteps
I lead the wood and you don’t want to accept
I'm the motherfucking Man
Stereotypes say that i’ll never touch the rim
So to compensate i cut weight and die in order to look slim

{Hook}

(Verse: 14Edward Joziff)
I'm an Outkast cause I don’t wanna hit licks
So Hey Ya! Ruben pass that motherfucking spliff
Hopefully this rapping shit will one day make me rich
But i’m not here for the money or to flip bricks
I'm only here for the culture and to truthfully spit
And possible these bars will make you sick
And if the plan goes off without a hitch
Ill throw y'all my words like a baseball pitch

{Outro}
We try to throw our problems away
And then we smoke all day
