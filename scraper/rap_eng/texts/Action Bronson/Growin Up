[Action Bronson]

“DABBLE IN TRUFFLES”

Spark a seance, Niggas moving packs like crayon
Delicate ray on tap while he gently put the spray on
Turn to Tommy was the ID when i caught the robbery
No more playing lobbies smuggle drugs in bitches bodies
Elegance on the mic corruption chaos man of Steel
The triple goose that we know, foie gras with every meal
A glass of red glass of white glass of pink
6 niggas one bitch and everybody smash and stink
Grab her neck, punch her back, nut one in her shoe
We all went sushi style hoping we don’t catch that flu
Storm the point and overturn thats how this bastard do
Believe in science fuck God ill kill the pastor too
While eating pasta dude, low level prostitute, for money big guns this motherfucker gots to shoot
Marinated for a week, roasted lamb legs
Its Queens nigga the herb smoke is a mandate
Red roses, brown leathers, and black guns
The green money and beige crack attract bums
Fiends fighting for that last wibble  left on the floor
Keeps me dipping in my sock in the back of the store
Flying niggas from overseas to do the hit
Back on the plane the same day movie shit
Got the word they tried to hit me over petty matters
Next scene catch me swinging from the helli ladder
Empty your magazines, shotguns, and rocket launchers, hand grenades, handguns, and fire torches
Off the boat Albanians the one to trust
He had a face, he had hands, It wasn’t us
Take a twisted ride with me through the eyes of a goon
Pussy bring your man with you sending 2 to the tomb
