Neck tattoos of praying hands couldn't help me
But I still smile for their selfie...



What up Mr. Baklava, we haven't seen you in a while
It's great to see that smile

Your hair looks wonderful, let me push this chair up under you
The weather's beautiful, you must have brought the sun with you
You're getting slimmer and you're tanning huh?
And you're speaking perfect Spanish, must have spent some time in Panama
I gotta tell you that you're absolutely glowing
All that fishing and relaxing that you're doing, it's showing
I might take up rowing, then show up looking Samoan
Mad suede covers my toes, and my fancy words keep me frozen
It's so easy being me...  cuz, I'm the same OG

All i wanna do is blow my weed and stroke my queen
And get a fleet of blue boats for the team

MY BMW scrapes the floor

You understand?

My BMW...

The side of my crib, looking like Wrigley field, covered in ivy
I could have been one of the Isley's
The coupe moves like voodoo put a needle in the doll
Yo is that Don Cheadele in the car? It looks just like him
About to watch the documentary that Spike did on Tyson

Shout outs to Tracey Morgan you inspire me, man
I fucking love you
Blue chips 7000, fuck that's delicious book
We out here, you understand me?
Queens in this motherfucker, always
You understand?

In front of 50,000 screaming, higher than I've ever been
Eyes closed, mami I'm a rockstar
No one knows that i just woke up
Got doped up, I just grab the mic and go nuts
Eat donuts because I'm robust
I like to sit on  women's shoulders, Red karate outfits like i'm Sho-nuff
