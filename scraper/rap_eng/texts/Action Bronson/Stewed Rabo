[Verse 1: Action Bronson]

Coronell's, where you at, man?

Yo, stew the rabo
In the kitchen stood a Cuban model
Really good at playing lotto
This lucky bitch, shit
This type of money could get Nucky clipped
Dressed in all white, dancing on some Puffy shit
Three different animals are eaten on a daily basis
Still make our way through staircases and basements
Old hookers with knee braces
That need knee replacements
From all the years of pounding on the pavement

[Verse 2: A.G. Da Coroner]

Most these rappers got Coolio fever (they smoking crack)
Pound you out like Julio Cesar (where the ref?)
Knock you out cold, you wake up swoll
Both eyes shining like them rocks that Jacob sold (diamonds)
Killer Kowalski with the claw make you pass out (choke 'em)
Catch amnesia with the mac, I just black out (what I do?)
Take the crack out, pull on the glass
Pookie grabbed the turkey then got put on his ass (faggot)
The music is drugs, the shit keep calling me
95 percent of these rapper's music is boring me (I don't want to hear that)
Wake me up when you done, sonny (wake up)
Come and put your 2 cents in and take my gun from me (try it)
History is more than a word, it's what I been through
Couldn't imagine the kind of shit your wife is into (that bitch a freak)
The operation is deep throat, walked into the avenue and tricked on a cheap coat (10 dollars)
Now I'm sort of like your step daddy, manicured pinky nails
Hopping out the red Caddy
Try and send the feds at me, Brasco moves (snitch)
You wouldn't survive a second in this asshole's shoes

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]

Yo, my play clothes aren't to be played in (not at all)
This Breitling throws lightning that's Raiden
Get sprayed in (shut the fuck up)
Muthafuckas is lunch meat
Dumb street, nigga, we dump heat, hit 'em up
Old bucks get treated like cold cuts
Faces get broken and sowed up, it's us, nigga
Catch us onstage (straight up)
Looking like lords of the drug holding the gauge
Or, in the XXL up on the page
Or, in The Source rocking sneakers that's beige
Or, on fifth ave. buying some imported cloth
While we pitching, moving shipments of assorted broth (minestrone)
Soups in all sizes
In love with bad girls that like to publicize profits
That only see dollar bills when they open they eyelids, uhhh
The whole crib was built off yey
From the portraits, to the porcelain with the built in bidet
Shitttt, catch me in Queens
Hat low, living my dreams, congratulate me
