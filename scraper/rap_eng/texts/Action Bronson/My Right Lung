[Intro]
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a basketball one time
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a basketball one time, uh

[Verse 1]
Seasons change weekly
Life in the big leagues
I can tell it's summer by the fig trees
Wiggle German Jeeps with kiss on 'em
Drop her top, she got a nice set of tits on her
Hardcore, got me feelin' like a fish outta water
Cruising U.S.A., I use six quarters
I got next

[Interlude]
Uh, ah man, ah man, uh

[Chorus]
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a fucking ball just one time
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a basketball one time
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a baâ€“
Yo, fuck that shit, man

[Verse 2]
Fuck a critic
I'll have my little Spanish homie hit you with the Civic
Send the motherfucker spinnin'
I ain't like my chain so I threw it on a midget
I don't like the terms of the deal, do better on the digits
My Colombian princess'll come and hit you with the scissors
In the neck 'til it look like Twizzlers

[Outro]
Night night
Take me home
