[Verse 1]
Respected blends
Hopping out the 87 Benz
No pendent
Plus I’ve always been defendant
Never Plaintiff
Shorty crying at arraignment
This Jamie Lee Blue Steel what I'm aimin'
Queens to the death
Lean to the left
Walk in the kitchen? Meet and greets with the chef
I’m like a baby cause I sleep on the breast
But still fuck around throw the heat to your chest
Million dollar raps, million dollar beats
Five dollar dimes
Young Harvard minds
Yale in the spring
Bali in the summer
See me through the window like Batali in the Hummer
Sharp at the feet
Morimoto knife set
Young Cordell coming through the portal
Terry Gene Bollea motherfuckers are immortal
You in the corner looking floral

[Verse 2]
The New Yorker
Heavy body smooth talker
Stand in the foyer
Portraits of my yiddish lawyer
British walker
Presence like I’m Connery
You wanna die well swing
Knees like Olden Polynice
My shorty Polynesian don’t make no apologies
And when I’m rich I’ll probably join the Scientology
Three hookers
Street gynecology
Edward Scissors my existence is anomaly
Smoke the chronic, chronically
Bronson Chronicles
You ain’t really fucking with me honestly
Sonically we fuckin boom shit
Just be smooth kid or catch a fucking raping with the broom stick
