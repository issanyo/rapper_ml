[Hook: Action Bronson]
It's your boy, Mr. Wonderful
Reporting from the backseat of a limo
You can smell what I'm smoking right out the window when the wind blow
Oh, oh, oh
Bitch I'm so groovy
Everyday it's like I'm shooting for a movie
You swear you wouldn't but you know that you would do me
No more playing bitch, it's time to meet the new me
And they call him Mr. Wonderful
Take me, take me in your arms
And never let me go
I need you more and more
I need you more and more
I need you more and more

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I spelt the ransom note in the SpaghettiOs
Petty hoes that let the semi go
After takin' seven bumps of perico
You already know, you not ready though, that product selling slow
You ain't no criminal
Your money minimal
My jacket make you grimace
You can catch me playing tennis with my dentist, Dennis
Independent suspension
Four-o-five is what I'm benchin' on the benches with my henchman
Black turtle necks, we on some French shit
Uh, and I shoot like I'm from French Lick
Sometimes I feel like I'm playing with a death wish
All a player wants is neck bows and red fish
And that thick red bone to get me necked on for breakfast
Uh, what a life I made for myself, damn
All them nights I played with myself
Now, I don't even take a piss by myself (no)
Yes I'm done baby, hand me my belt

[Chorus]
It's your boy, Mr. Wonderful
Reporting from the backseat of a limo
You can smell what i'm smoking right out the window when the wind blow
Oh, oh, oh
Bitch i'm so groovy
Everyday it's like I'm shooting for a movie
You swear you wouldn't but you know that you would do me
No more playing bitch, it's time to meet the new me
And they call him Mr. Wonderful

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
All my Jamaicans call me Johnny Dagger
Find the world's tallest ladder
Climb to the top, jump off and make punani splatter (take that)
Splash, then order that Jumanji platter
Cartier's display the latest shatter (bling)
My mother's wrist look like it's dipped in batter
Batting average like I'm takin' juice
Like a moose, my fucking body like a stegosaurus
Still movin' state to state with warrants
Draped in Asian garments, I bathe in Agent Orange
Uh, rent the plane like a rental
You can't even imagine, this pain inside my mental
Understand I'm always glorious
Direct descendants of some major warriors

[Chorus]
It's your boy, Mr. Wonderful
Reporting from the backseat of a limo
You can smell what I'm smoking right out the window when the wind blow
Oh, oh, oh
Bitch I'm so groovy
Everyday it's like i'm shooting for a movie
You swear you wouldn't but you know that you would do me
No more playing bitch, it's time to meet the new me
And they call him Mr. Wonderful
Take me, take me in your arms
And never let me go
I need you more and more
I need you more and more (oh, oh)
I need you more and more (oh, oh)

[Outro]
It's me baby, Mr. Wonderful
Told you already, nothing else matters
That's it

"I noticed you didn't applaud, dear"
(laughter)
