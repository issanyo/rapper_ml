[Verse 1 : TaskRok]
You put the flower in the grinder and you crank it
In bed with Mary, you could find her in my blanket
You got fire, I’ma blaze it, call it rise to the occasion
Fat shatter patties, budder drying in the basement
I don’t need no provocation to smoke, my occupation’s to toke
Even though it’s also making me broke
Come on Barrack Obama gotta lend some change with the stroke of the pen
Quit persecuting all of those you're supposed to defend
How’d it be, taking tokes of the Sour D, hourly
Gone like a falcon on the balcony
I’m trippin when I’m out of weed
I need a Buddha sack, that Pre-98 Bubba, Headband, the Super Jack
Blowing never get far, opening the fresh jar
Little Skywalker choking on the Death Star
Spoil bragger, e-nail coil rapper
Royal shatter rapper spitting harder than my oil spatter

[Hook]
My whole click keeps blowing all the glass
Growin all the grass and smoking all your hash
It's a green rush
But we ain’t in it just for cash
We in it for the love till death dust and ash

[Verse 2 - Action Bronson]
I’m in the kitchen and I’m frying chicken
Eyes chinese, been getting hiney since the 90’s
Cold honey and a parchment paper, hit the nail
Now I’m gone like when the wind hits the sails
Mami keep the bail for me cause she know that I be doing wrong
Now the beamer look like it got ewings on
Move strong, my bitch is jewish with a blue thong
Dabbing award winner out the new bong
Adjust the nail on the rig, now I'm sweating
Keep the pen in my pocket, I’m always rappin
Seven dabs open my visiano at the table
I’m known to order duck like Donald

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : TaskRok]
Recession proof, I never need a bail out
I’m waiting for the postman, my drugs are on his mail route
I can do anything myself except for self doubt
So I don’t ever seek help, I only help out
It’s mad work, we doing lots of trimming
Then getting stoned like Islamic women
When cops slippin, the system is flawed
Isn’t it odd, when Gods given us plans
When it’s stances that laws forbid them
And watch out if you black and you speaking Spanish
Cause that racist law was made to attack and defeat Hispanics
It’s propaganda, we laughin at reefer madness
But the privatized prisons will profit when people vanish
That’s why I feel like the loneliest dude
The only one out of my friends without a Mobius tube
It’s rude, I don’t collect, I just buy and I use
I kinda abuse, my glass clogged, try and defuse, you lose

[Hook]

[Verse 4 : TaskRok]
That bacon quave with the eggs man, I see you on some other shit
Fabulous, makes me wanna beam aboard the mother ship
For many too mafia, and Darby guns, it’s a take over
Spitting fire like my man Bates glass flamethrower
Smoking in my bath tub, cause fuck the damn club
I’m home alone, taking dabs out my HAMM bub
It’s all American, no phoney’ish
My only wish is I had a never ending supply in my Burtoni dish
Staying at the raddest inn, taking dabs at Addison
San Francisco stop to meet with Julio and dab again
We link with Chad and stay in san diego
Backstage at the bay cup, blazing with Danny Danko
Peace to Magweedo, Topher, and Toke Daddy
FunkMaster Kush, let’s twist up a bush and smoke fatties
And big ups to Wheezy feel like every show
You seem to always save our ass yo wherever we go
Hey yo, my buddy juggy acting funny off a hubby bar
Looking like a poo bear with his head stuck in a honey jar
Each etize sweet, at the hard rock
Rockstars carving out, I spark from the bar stuff
My life’s one big oil adventure
I’m laying honeys and making moneys like coil condensors
Let’s go

[Hook]
