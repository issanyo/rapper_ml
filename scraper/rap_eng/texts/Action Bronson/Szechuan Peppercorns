[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
You could tell she was a mediocre lover
From the way that she was dancing at the wedding, uh
I pull up in a Benz from '84 with Lady Saw
Bodybuilder bitch opened my door
Hundred dollar bill folded in a square, place it in her hand
(now I'm good forever with her)
Thick ass thighs
Naked knife fights in the bath house in Turkey (uh)
Dipped the razor blade in herpes
Glad I escaped that shit man, that was a close call
Tried to cut my nutsack open
I got a Japanese attorney from China with a vagina
(a big one)
Every single thing she eats her meals right out the diner
(like a old lady)
Two poached eggs, whole wheat toast dry
A Lipitor and lemonwater
She got the high cholesterol man
But she's good in court
(Lipitor and lemonwater cocktails)
She knows exactly what to do
She's good friends with the judge
Diego, bring the Jeep around please
Uh, hopped off the Harley (like I'm Steven Seagal)
Bike's still going (uh)
She likes girls but that dyke's still blowing (still blowing)
I'm in a penthouse doing yoga moves
(Like I'm a lightskin motherfucker man)
Wolfgang Puck, prep the duck while I fuck (fuck)
Six Brazilian women in a white Suburban truck (truck)
I ball so much I got the And-1 tattoo
(Shit man I could've played for the Spurs)

[Verse 2: Hologram, Meyhem Lauren & Action Bronson]
That's right, you're like Patty Mills
Rolling through the hood, J steal eastwood
The gun that I carry similar to Dirty Harry
And I love my gun, we about to get married
I'm wearing Polo, Yami Bolo singing through the speaker
I'm in a low-low, not a dodo crash the shit on Bleecker
Fuck the whip, car jack the shit, Morgan and Meeker
I ran up in the morgue for the leak, I need a beaker
Dirty chucks but I give a fuck about a sneaker
Fuck you and fuck the bitch that I'm fucking, bitch you could keep her
We on that wax, fuck your pre-run, fuck your reefer
I'm like West 23rd Ave in Gary, Indiana
My gun appear out of nowhere, I never carry the hammer
Hologram is on the corner, Ragamuffin style
It's me, dressed too fresh, can't do nothing wild
So me bum it on the regular

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Good feet known for kicks like the World Cup (cup)
Stay sharp, do a spin, leave the world cut (cut)
My whole team is eskimo brothers
Fucking these hoes like we was testing out rubbers
I can't help it, I'm an animal (animal)
Follow my steps like I'm a manual (manual)
Smell like a winner, peace to my fragrance tray
I'm getting money in the city where the vagrants stay
Eating off gold dishes with my old mistress
It's a new day, I never see no cold winters
Unless I fuck up my life
Tank tops all year like I fuck up my wife, uh
But I don't hit no bitch
Never seen a motherfucker with his kicks so crisp, uh
AKA Laurenoveech
Smack you right in your face like I'm the king of speech, uh
How a nigga flow
Come back, don't ever fuck with a nigga dough, uh
Money and cake
Fuck around, I punch you right in your face
It's Laurenovich, uh
Back with that fly shit
Told you motherfuckers that's my shit, uh
[?]
That's right, nigga
