[Refrain]
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
(I needed a little taste to that)

[Verse 1]
Twisting joints like a contortionist
Laid in the Porsche
My father driving
Days been sunny since I started rhyming
No denying me; I'm known to keep a fresh foot like podiatry
Nobody high as me
Green Timbs, in Vegas I'm like Steve Wynn
At the same time, fellatio from three twins
Those are triplets; I've been wilding since the Rabbi snipped it
Then they laughed, and ate brisket, fuck!
On my behalf, he had a meeting at the Neptune
Had little daddy hide the heater in the restroom
Guns drawn like my bath by my lady friend
Mesothelioma money: drop Mercedes-Benz
And I ain't never left, you know I'm still here
Spit the shit to bring a cripple out the wheelchair
Bite a bitch like George Whipple in the stair case
Long as she got big nipples and a tan face

[Refrain]
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
(Yeah, you're in the concrete right now)
Devil is on the loose, no coop

[Verse 2]
Foul living like Sandusky and Paterno
I've been husky, motherfuckers couldn't touch me
'Lo rugby with an Asian model so ugly
Celebration 1987, no bubbly
Facially, I'm like a young John Kennedy
More obscenity; EBT in Genovese
Go to Ock, get 70 for 100
I want the 75 from Ocky but he fronted
Take the money, cop 5 dimes, 2 chicken sandwiches, 9 limes
For the Canada Dry; pose for the cameras by the banister, "Hi"
In the summer, rock the vest set – Salmon Kani
Flex the three-quarter cream Fi's
We're summer seam G's; steamed red snapper – Vietnamese
Catch a case, get a Jewish lawyer, beat it with cheese
Fuck the beef cause it don't go together, read em and weep
It's very easy, make you disappear now, kid
Make your paper, but you need to stay grounded
Eyes wide like a chick that got the dick in the butt
We're out here, trying to get the money, baby, live it up

[Outro]
Talk about me if you please, but I must be Hercules
Hercules
I must be Hercules!
