[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Live from Africa

[Verse Preview]
No shirt, top down in a Mustang
You know I gotta let these nuts hang
It feels like I've been sitting on a shelf
But I've been sitting on a couch
Watching myself sit on the couch

[Interlude]
Oh na, na, na, na, hold on, hold on, hold on
Bring that shit the fuck back right motherfucking now!
(Statik Selektah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Live from Africa

[Verse]
No shirt, top down in a Mustang
You know I gotta let these nuts hang
It feels like I've been sitting on a shelf
But I've been sitting on a couch
Watching myself sit on the couch
All of a sudden I'm in Rome on the top floor
Your boy started feeling like a drone
Hanging from the ceiling of the Vatican, the pope's house
That's word to me, that's a dope house
Look, I told you once, drugs do me
Ride around in whips that only got two seats
Loose lips sink ships and I've been floating for a minute
It's only business
Bitch I'm posted at the park like a pigeon
Motherfuckers ain't in my division
Guess you could only play in your position
I play 'em all and play 'em at the top tier
Who's scared baby not here
I swing the bat with baby hair
I lay you there
Call the cops, they like to play around here
Smoking back to back 'cause I'm stressed dog
Just put the fucking money in my left paw then step off
You heard

[Hook]
I'm chunky and I'm funky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
You just a flunky
I'm chunky and I'm funky

[Verse 2]
No shirt, top down in a Mustang
You know I must let these nuts hang
Back to business, scratching numbers off biscuits
Mr. Baklava's freak dancing all you bitches
Shouldn't have counted me out
I see Academy awards on the mantle, no doubt
Pictures hanging on the wall with No Doubt
Now a days I lay on boats with my toes out
Out of control and I like it
I'm everywhere and dog you're never there like a dyke's dick
Unless you copped that dick off eBay

[Hook]
I'm chunky and I'm funky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
You just a flunky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
You just a flunky
I'm chunky and I'm funky
