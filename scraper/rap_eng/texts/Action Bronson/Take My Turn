[Verse 1: Termanology]

Kick in the door like Biggie did
Got a variation of barrels waiting to get me rich
Yes I'm on the block with my Philly lit in the 50's whip
With my villains and they affiliates and we in this bitch
Uhh
Peach, Ciroc by the bottle boy
And I'm in the club with a model that you cannot avoid
You see that thing you do a double take
She ain't fucking tonight, we ain't having another date
Swerve
Kick rocks while I take shots
Then I'm peeling outta my muscle car with the big block
Err
I'm getting topped when I hit the stop light
Shawty told me, "Stop, let me get on top"
Whoa
Catch me riding through Queens
Picking up Bronson, lighting up green
Both hands on the steering wheel full of rings
Nah, I ain't in a gang but I'm a Lawtown king
Go

[Hook: Jared Evan]
What the fuck you trying to change me for?
What kind of fool you take me for?
I don't need anything at all
It's not over 'til I finally take my turn
Finally take my turn
Finally take my turn

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
A thousand dollars on the jump shot
Rocking some dress shoes
No shirt on 'em like Bird from the corner
Shawty in the sauna
Finest meat served off a slaughter
Run a two minute drill, fourth quarter
This is every favorite uncle rap shit at a store
We bought the boat and extort the captain, Captain Hook
Fold you back when you fuck around with the rapping cook
Jackie Chan or Van Damme, kick with classic foot
See the world behind my eyes become a changed man
Often eating lavish meals from a strange land
Lamb galore
Hummus in abundance
Raise the glass, king is here, hear the trumpets
Bronson
You can find me where the bitches at
Love a bitch who slap her pussy like a fishing hat
Watch your ass cause this is prison rap
Bag of money, I envision that
Cause I'm a Queens king

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jared Evan]
You won't catch me until I'm done
There's nothing else to wait for
My reign only just begun
No
And there ain't no doubt about it
No
And there ain't no doubt about it
No
And there ain't no doubt about it

{x4}
Till I finally take my turn
And there ain't no doubt about it
No
