[Verse 1]
(Fuck, ah)
Yeah, I might be chubby but I'm gorgeous in the face
Things are going well, hope I don't catch that fuckin' case
I could get on some other shit and send you to that place
Fifty for the shooter, a hundred for my steak
Your life ain't worth a steak, I keep the rifle in the cape
To be on top with the title will be my fate, don't make no mistakes
Mommy, you see me? Everything's a movie, I jump in the jacuzzi with that green Coogi
The plane lift up, it's like that body, boy, chain lift up
Crimes committed with no hiccups
Ah! That thing thing, shred your stomach like sit-ups
You'll never sit up or shit from your butt
They say I'm crazy and deranged, but fuck, I can handle that
I crack the whip right from the camels back
My head is wrapped like Yasser Arafat
And I don't sleep no more, it's only fuckin' power naps

[verse 2: Acapella]
It's so easy to be looked over, I never look sober
Look through the eyes of a soldier, I look fly in a Rover
Lions and cobras, keep the iron in the toga
Send a message, leave you lying over
Bitches crushing on the kid so now they flying over
Half of the world to get wrapped up in pearls
Just like the Queen of England, I stay wavy
Mercedes color, Wayne Brady, it's me baby, please baby
Ain't nobody taking my spot, that's on my mother, kid
Cross my heart and hope to die, that's on some other shit
This motherfuckin' kid be coveted
Different types of silks is what I'm covered with
Baby I'm lovin' it, your boy is hotter than an oven mitt
If I was broke then you'd be running your shit
Poke your kidney with the knife I cut the onion with
Then poach your kidneys with some onions and shit
It's me

[Verse 3]
Left, right, ayo I've never been a plaintiff, ever
What, what, what...I don't fuck with this I'm done

[Acapella]
My lawyer tackle the case like he play for the Ravens
So I stuff 'em with cheese like a Danish
Damn I crave paper, catch me later at the Laker game, I bet a grip
On the Knicks, Carmelo sweating on my kicks cause I'm court side
This time the good way, "I'm a free man" that's what I should say
Nobody holding me back except myself, that's what I feel like
Peeling a five, now I'm feeling the vibe, hand on the wheel, drugs in my eyes
Money in my mind, I think about it all the time
Cause there was a time I never had shit, now I got shit
It's like magic, all these cars in front of the crib look like a Porsche pageant
