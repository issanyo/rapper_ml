[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Peel out the whip, it's raining but the tires still smoking
Plus this homegrown shit be potent
Georgia tech sweatsuit in a red coupe
You know we get loot
And beat the pussy like a dead moose
Bake the bread like a grandmother
Rock Vans in the summer
Hoist metal, baste the salmon with butter
Shit be tanner than ceramic from a Mexican mother
Or when a hammer bitch is dancing in the bed with my brother

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Some stupidity ignorant rap, never that it's knowledge family
I rep for Queens, my niggas blast the jam be understand me
Keep your heat stacked like your ones and be on ?pz?
South block plots and drug spot drops forever greasy
Used to have an attitude and thought the whole world should appease me
Apologetic connected with it, now I see it needs me
It's all give and take, respect the cycle of thought
Forever caught in landscapes between reflecting New York
Show me support for preservation and the art of presentation
Intense investigation while we route my destination
Nefarious ladies splash their faces with potential babies
Real niggas know my resume shot out my brother ???

[Verse 3: AG the Coroner
The original gun clapper
Who cracked the code and stole the gold from you actors
Bitch niggas get washed up
Ran over your whole team pushing a Dodge truck
They asked me why I think so violently
The devil on my shoulder don't sleep, it keeps trying me
And ain't no motherfucker want to hire me
I penned a whole chapter in a serial killer's diary
Sick mind with a sick rhyme
Catch me on vacay flipping up and posing with a thick swine
Bend over a chick's spine
And don't stop drilling until I get mine
Determination's my occupation I never quit
Like fucking your wifey while she's telling you that she's celibate
Ten to rise and I love wars, they delicate
And do it two more times, now I'm a predicate
