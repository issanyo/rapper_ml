[Verse 1: Action Bronson (Chauncey Sherod)]
On this dark old road, tryna find my way
I'm sick and I'm tired of games people play
(Singing I'm tired of games people play)
No 808, I'm barely standing
Leave me for dead with that gun in your hand (gun in your hand)
Now I got no soul, it was taken a long time ago
(It was taken a long time ago)
I've given my life to a stranger, that sleeps by my side at night
Look in her eyes, I see danger, and man is this shinning bright

[Bridge: Action Bronson]
She won't think twice, to hurt me
She won't think twice, to hurt me
She won't think twice, to hurt me
She won't think twice

[Hook: Action Bronson]
She only wants money my money
She only wants money my money
She only wants money from me, love from somebody else
She only wants money from me, love from somebody else
