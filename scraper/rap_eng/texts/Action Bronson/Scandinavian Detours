[Verse 1: Da$H]
Stash the ends, crash the black Benz for a distraction
Extract the package, killing a gator in a lake that's Placid
Skin it for jackets, made to bait an actress
I'm everything you lacking, my reputation massive
Avoid the capture and escape arrest, got cave drawings on my flesh
Had a dinner date with death, so I
Light up the cess and then transform into a fighter jet
Decepticon, I'm selling strippers out in Lebanon
Stare at the moon and then I said a song
The wind was calm, the trees was palm, reefer strong
Speak in psalms, I move the beef brisket with the tongs
Never chopsticks, goth bitch blowing cock in a Drop 6
You ask a nigga how I got this, I never answer the question
A science blessed him in applied selection
With a young king, butler named Ludwig
Your mother bedroom is where I puff cigs, you fucking know

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
You know how my story go, your mouth's a glory hole
The man who made my outfit's name is Gregorio
Damn, I want some Oreo's, riding through Astoria
I can tell you're tushy from directly through your cornea
You'll get wiped, suck the knife like a dick head
Blood all over my old baseball cards by my kid's bed
Double park, make a sale inside the Modell's
"Bronson, I only got twelve" baby, oh well
Shit, I had the jacket with the thing
I order two wings, Jamaican colored Ewings
The can of coke got us into Six Flags
Shit, I always knew that I'd be rich, Dad
Fuck 'em, never need 'em, never trust 'em
From first glance I'm looking Russian
Second glance I'm looking dusted
From third glance I'm quite disgusting, call me Justin
