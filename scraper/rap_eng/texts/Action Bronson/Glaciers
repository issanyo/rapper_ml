[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]

Yo, Outdoorsmen, yo, yo, yo

Sex, drugs, money and murder
Part of my syllabus
We slap puppets up and then clap the ventriloquist
Outdoors, Double L's click
That's who the illest is
Peace to niggas repping New York
I know you feeling this
DOA blocks and leave drug spots deceased
Only time you see me lie
Is to a bitch or police
Nigga, stack, loyalty and respect
Are my beliefs
On that 'Lo shit, still rock my USA fleece
My neck is built for Cuban links
A couple of chips in the piece
Your brother's daughter got trained
A couple of dicks in your niece
That's how it happens
Flow HD with closed captions
The new public defender is known to blow captains
Daily mathematics get broke down in fractions
Cause and effect are the science behind action

[Verse 2: Shaz Illyork]

Designed to play the front line
Fire at them one time
Eyes wide open, gun smoking
Throwing son signs
So, duck if he gotta
Roulette in the Borgata
Mali stain the freezer
From my dusty armada
Amaretto sour for the shorty's
Hold the 40, in the Louie
Hit the drink spot
I need four Bluey's
A fresh pack of Newie's
Seven dollars, no stamp
A man puffed two pulls
Let's rally up the fam
And run through your hood
Like a train on a loose
And if it's going to pay
Then I'm out for the fame
Out to take crowns
From NY to out of town
Bloodhound solving mysteries
Only when youâ€™re found
She only going down
Then she kissed you on your mouth
That's why I leave them sore with their backs blown out

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]

Where your heart at?
Knife, put it where you fart at
Fall back or get your whore clapped
I sing the raw rap
Searching for dollars hidden under floor mat
Tie your knee or break your thorax
Train your bitch, tape her with the Kodak
Now you know that
The beard is heavy
And the caesar low
Seasoned pro
Right up in the lung is where the reefer go
Glass raised for past days
We pass haze
Fly kick, footwork
Cash Clay
