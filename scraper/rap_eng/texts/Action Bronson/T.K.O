[Intro: Ring announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen
Coming to the ring
At a whopping 273 pounds
Standing at 5'7 3 quarters and a half
Out of Flushing, Queens
It's.....

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Fly in the winter like a flock of birdies, I never rocked a derby
You see the polo, U.S.A. right on the hockey jersey
Every step that I take mimicking no man
Precision flow man, motherfucker get with the program
Compare the lord to no man, moves I never fake em
Aura like Wagyu beef, you just a Steak-Umm
Paired with shiraz for the taste to serve at table side
My lyric through the vocal take my palette on a flavour ride
It's obvious I'm gonna do it, right outta Flushing
Percussion gushing after the session right to the luncheon
On my Scandinavian shit, serve up a puffin
Find a shorty, gargle her mouth and stuff her muffin
Duffin many blunts to the neck, what you expect?
I'm a vet show the respect, same shit your father get
Very humble, Jim Brown, never fumble
Know the purple in season and well then I'll take a bundle
We in the street like a hooker's feet
I'm known for cooking meat, cooking beats
And wildin' like I'm Booker T
Bronsolini walking like a cowboy
Sharp at the feet steel and got the alloy
Straight outta New York the bad liuetenient, Bronsolini
Team leathered down, the angel I like's in the pini
You oughta see me, uptown coppin' the chimi
Puffin the pudo, fuckin' some culo, Bronson the chulo
Jaws of white shark ready for the swimmin'
Haze and linen with razor vision make the blade decision
Peep the beeper, Lonnie do the street procedure
Legendary shit for how my brother heat the beaker
Exquisite beard lined up, that's for the ladies
Plus I'm bout to be in Turkey G'd up riding Mercedes
Know Hugginatti keep the ceaser wavy, Bronsolini with the seasoned gravy
Just add the cheese for flavi
Straight to the table cause it's best when I'm hot
Play me funny kick your nuts until your testicles pop
Exhale the doja, when it's full moon I lose composure
Lesson 1: cuddle your son. Brought to a closure
Dabble in truffles, Sauvignon blanc simmered in mussels
Nothing ever ripped from my neck during a tussle
A bolo young I'm Lecter with the muzzle
Injector of the deck I place the sectors in the puzzle
