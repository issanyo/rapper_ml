[Chorus]
All I wanna do is sip drinks by the pool
Drive fast cars, new minks on my boo
All I wanna do is sip drinks by the pool
Drive fast cars, new minks on my boo
Uh, one two la-di da-di
It took a lot of hard work to get this body
We be actin' dumb at the party
Bam Bam,pump pump the shotty
(Pump pump the shotty)

[Verse 1]
I know you seen your boy on the tube and lookin' Cuban
These other dudes lack a little cumin, that's no flavor
I hold razors and carry groceries across the street for old neighbors
Uh, grab my dick when I spit
Six speeds on a stick shift
Man, somebody better grab the wheel
'Cause I don't like feelin' how I feel
I took the year off to gather my thoughts
Bitch, dabbling horses
And look charismatic in Porsches
And now I'm Out for Justice like Seagal
Take me to the chopper right now
Uh, just wait a minute, wait a minute
Hoppin' out the black Mercedes tinted
And now I'm Out for Justice like Seagal
Take me to the chopper right now

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is sip drinks by the pool
Drive fast cars, new minks on my boo
All I wanna do is sip drinks by the pool
Drive fast cars, new minks on my boo
Uh, one two la-di da-di
It took a lot of hard work to get this body
We be actin' dumb at the party
Bam Bam, pump pump the shotty
(Pump pump the shotty)

[Verse 2]
Yo, peep the scene
I'm sittin' on her face smokin' a blunt
Virgin colada in a coconut
My eyes are hidden from the hardcore
Though I'm still on point
One false move will wrap a pussy up in cardboard
So many different treasures on my necklace
I stare towards the sky, I accept this
Lightning strikes, the wind blows, the trees shake
And water splits apart like a cheesesteak
Uh, you gotta take it easy
Let the Mac-10 dance like Chris Breezy
Snatch a motherfucker out his Curry's
You could look into my eyes and see there's no worries

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is sip drinks by the pool
Drive fast cars, new minks on my boo
All I wanna do is sip drinks by the pool
Drive fast cars, new minks on my boo
Uh, one two la-di da-di
It took a lot of hard work to get this body
We be actin' dumb at the party
Bam Bam, pump pump the shotty
(Pump pump the shotty)

[Outro]
All I wanna do is sip drinks by the pool
Drive fast cars, new minks on my boo
All I wanna do is sip drinks by the pool
Drive fast cars, new minks on my boo
