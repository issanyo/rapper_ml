[Intro]
[Ed Axley] “I gotta ask this question or I wouldn’t be doing my job...
Would you care to comment on the rumor that you arranged for an automobile to be purchased for (Action Bronson)?"
[Pete Bell] “You know- You know, Ed, you just gotta get your mind out of the gutter
You know, you- you just gotta start thinking straight
I mean, it’s right there in front of you
For Christ’s sake it wasn’t an automobile, I mean, it was a fully loaded Lexus!”

[Verse 1]
Fifty large
Sitting sipping vichyssoise
Silk robes
Pepper on the pasta
Cheeses from Lazio
Pussy mi carpaccio
Lightly dressed
Hairy like a Viking’s chest
Bobby Bacala
Hopping out the Saab
Chris Hansen
Dancin’ in a Swiss mansion
Shorty gorgeous
Daddy keep the wrist handsome
Old Impalas
Keep them jumping like they Steve Francis
Need a Carhartts
Like Dykstra with the car wash
Young Tarbash
Higher than a Star Fox
Monday morning
Caught her back end with the arm slot
Twenty years
Probably catch me with the pony tail
Borsch polish
Sipping out the holy grail
Tear-away pants
Prince Rogers Nelson
We father figures
Famous like DiMaggio
You can tell a tranny by the neck
Catch me in Solana with the bow and arrow
Roasting marrow
Lacoste Sailboat
Tying hookers to the railroad
Doctor Zizmor
On the N train, Astoria-bound
Celino and Barnes
Trying to get the paper right

[Verse 2]
Trying to get the paper right
Guy Fieri shirt
Long pinky nail
Nose numb
Earing with the feather
Every hooker’s name is Heather
The Marlboro hat
The Newport windbreakers
Ne-Yo mixtape cover
Straight from the Aqueduct
Black Acura
Imported straight from Africa
White tigers
Thousand-dollar spatula
Panzanella
Salad with the bread
Big retard sleep with
Towels on the bed
Blue chips with the championship
Plus the Lexus
Weed smell like disinfectant
Fucking bitches pregnant
Stroller from Stockholm
Nanny from Haiti
Boyz II Men posters
Gladys Knight fried chicken

[Outro]
