[Intro]
Uh, Queens man
Here we are
2013 and beyond
Fuck all the talking

[Verse 1]
Yo, I rock the AIDS walk hat, Smoke a baseball bat
Get paid off rap, I copped an 8 all black
Hop out Laredo's, Equipped with the potato strap
Get turned to home fries, That's by any means to see the dough rise
Ill! This bitch's pussy smell like low tide
No pride, Fuck it I'll just hold my breath
Suplex a fiend at the Sizzler
Damn shorty got a shitter
Me and my father hit it back to back like Griffey
Big black girl bad fake missy
You could catch me in a line for my SS
I need some red sweats and a box of reds
I make the consommé from the lobster head
Now a days I'm getting lots of head
Uh, 635's drop with the aqua treads
10 stacks for a dap, 20 just to look me in the eye
Body'll shoot you in the thigh
Flip outta the whip, dip, I'm out
Change it up man

[Verse 2]
We outta here with this one
Uh, Aw man
This is that, that beautiful shit right here
I choose you, you fucking ho
Yo tilt the goblet, Staring in the middle of the cockpit
Spanish bitch displayed up in some ostrich
Quinceañera freak dancing
Grant Hill's laced up with the x Helly Hansen
Foggy night hustle til' the sun up
Stumbling anonymous
Fuck around find your leg by the Gowanus Bridge
Over do it send your penis to your mama' crib
That's what happens when you open your vagina lips
Only focus on the merges and acquisitions
Commas on accounts, robbin' 'em like Yount
Boy you don't want no probelums, I got the opera lungs
Andrea Bocelli, Hit the telly, Lift my belly
Called off the ?
Baby there's no mistakin' my life is etched in granite, Sophisticated palate
Sweet, sour, salty, spicy, and umami
I'm eating oysters off of diamonds in Hawaii with 3 dykes that play ball for the Liberty
Finished the sequel now I'm lighting up the trilogy
Like E-Honda when he's smashing up the Lexus
Luger arms, baby it's all about accoutrements
Queens shit, That's how we fucking do in London, Tim Westwood
Bam Bam Bronsolinio we out here!
Uh!
