[Intro]
Awww yeah! We in the motherfuckin' place tonight!
Show's about to start guys, everybody get to your seats
Bronsolinio's comin' to the stage
Mmm, knew about the local things what they all talkin' about

[Verse 1]
Step in the door, Bronsolini, the mayor
The kush replayer, 80's bushy pussy gushy slayer
I'm a star and I'mma prove it
Saw me in the foreign car, shorty had a movement
Comin to your town, lockin' it down, rockin' it out
I'm on fire there's no stoppin' it now, it's tournament edition
Shorty on the arm an ornament for fishin'
Brussels eatin' breakfast in the Orient for chicken, listen
Know my mother wanna see me win
Slide the crack inside the slot you put your CD in
Give a couple bucks, let me live, puff a dutch
Cause ain't no motherfucker playin' me in Suckerpunch
It's my time, no more standin' in line
Now it's time to eat, paired up with the rarest of wine
Hair red just like the meat, never careless with mine
Play your part and stay sharp daddy, cherish your crime

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo, you couldn't wait to hear this fly shit
Shorty open up your thighs quick, smoke the pussy like a Thai stick
My style is lovin' in the island by Dubai dick
I leave my socks right on the floor cause this is my shit
Intoxicatin' aroma, drugs rolled in a diploma
Beautiful wine, we in Sonoma yo
The cheese plate, fish a pike out the lake
Take a dyke on a date, she let me pipe cause I'm an ape
White limey, maneuver at night, fuck assumption
Bronsolin' bring the truth to the light, that we the best
And ain't no motherfucker tellin' me different
Most talent and I practice, ain't no shock that I'm winnin'
Double-layered linens
Known for sinnin' in cinnamon women in tinted renteds
Cinderella pendants, the Lord flow tremendous
All I got is myself so fuck a co-defendant
Struck ass stripper, she tried to play me yo the whore's demented

[Outro]
Bronsolinio, Amuse Bouche
Just a little fuckin' taste of that mouth bitch
