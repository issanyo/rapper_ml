Action Bronson:
Queens, Queens, Queens in the building

Every time you see me, I'm stoned like a motherfucker
If this bitch is too annoying, let my brother fuck her
I don't need the headache, just need the head
I don't need to see the bread baked, just need the bread
My mother need a new crib, my shorty need some new tits
My girlfriend need a new ass just to complement for those lips
I call her big red, she loves to give head
And roll up joints that be bigger then a pig's leg
When I come home she be smelling all my boxers
'Motherfucker, why your penis smell like lobster?'
Cause I'm a mobster bitch
But so is every motherfucker on my roster, bitch

D Mac:
Oh, when a niggas gon' bang
And a niggas not focussed on starting
Now breathing harder
Playing all day
And them niggas aren't focussed on charging
Beg your pardon?
If todays that day
For the credit, just cash, no charging
[?]
We got armour, we got years ago
First time down like he here before
What he got homie, got gear to go
That Louie, that Gucci, what you know
I get my niggas fresher then my niggas ever been
I whipped my chicken and I got a leather pepper pen

Action Bronson:
Uh, every time you see me, I'm stoned like a motherfucker
If this bitch is too annoying, let my brother fuck her
I don't need the headache, just need the head
I don't need to see the bread baked, just need the bread
Bitch

D Mac:
Bitch I get my money, yo
Bitch I get my money, yo
Bitch I get my money, yo

Action Bronson:
I could, I could come dance [?] in the B.M
Shades over my eyes, so you can't see them
Please don't fuck with my freedom
I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Don't trust or believe them
They'll have you skin all up in the precinct
I could, I could buy a couple things
Take some bitches to Brazil
'Nother eight at the buffet
Water skiing in the grill
Every single cut of meat
[?] Korean on the grill
Every single thing I drive look as mean and off the pill

D Mac:
Oh, you little hungry ho
I don't fuck with no hungry ho
All my bitches got a lot of doe
And all my bitches got doe to show
Black chick said I was a pot of gold
That shit cause a nigga make the powder go
Drive through now you gotta go
I slide through whipping in that ride, you know
Top down and a nigga driving slow
I'm hot now nigga, I'm about to blow
Atom bomb, [?] broadand a thong
Take it all but keep it on
Just the heels, and that'll be all
[?] [?]

Action Bronson:
Uh, every time you see me, I'm stoned like a motherfucker
If this bitch is too annoying, let my brother fuck her
I don't need the headache, just need the head
I don't need to see the bread baked, just need the bread
Bitch

Hop out the [?] Lexus

I getting money for the paper [?] head count
Hopping out the hundred grand yacht
