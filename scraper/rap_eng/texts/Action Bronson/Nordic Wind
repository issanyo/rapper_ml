[Verse 1]
Our lungs are filled with the purple from the jungle
Never fumble, got the work right by the grundel
Twin dick-sucks for me and my son
That's before he was three, smoking weed in the blunt
Straight from Flushing, where the birds are hanging dead in the window
Scent of garbage make me sick, getting head in the rental
Got the lamb rack, pan-roasted, laced it with fennel
Little yogurt that been drizzled over might be a winner
Come and see me, Nona hand-makes the fettucini
Halla makes the baklava - getting paper kahskaval
Lahmacun Salad-smoking savage out of Sarasota
Macho man, the taco stand is where the hook is kept
30 dollars get you pussycat, right in the kitchen where they cooking at
Manteca, architecture Art Deco
Twist the pussy like a soft pretzel
I'm such a special guy, I'd rather die than ever testify
You'd sooner see me at the party with a vest and tie
Shorts, that's my steez when I'm stepping
Strolling down the streets like the westerns
Double weapons, at my sides and preparing for the showdown
Spinning like a wild maneuver, wilding at the ho down
Hold ground, stand firm, you little sissies got a chance
Now it's time to give a man burn

[Verse 2]
Yo, you try to fuck with Bronsolini, it's a crucial calling
Guaranteed you're gonna lose just like the Brooklyn brawler
Mister Wonderful in short-sets, Cortex
Gore-tex the bottom of the feet in case the floor wet
Floral scented, hand-crafted on the mother earth
Kinda strange, things been funny since my brother's birth
Shaking hands as if the money connect
Blow a ransom on the yacht, have a seed in Quebec
Respect my exquisite mystique, pretty petite
Little hookers running wild, giving head in the street
But still, slicing nuts, clean off that's with the razor
I'm laughing in the tavern in fresh Brunos and blazers - chilling
Spark the pepper
Queens shit, spark the pepper, PS
