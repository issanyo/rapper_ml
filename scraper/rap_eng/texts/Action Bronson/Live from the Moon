[Intro: Action Bronson]
Uh huh, good evening (Yeah)
Live from the Moon (Uh huh)
Live from the Moon (It's me)
You know, live from the Moon
Take me home, uh

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Ten time champ, 'bout to be eleven
Understand, I'm down to die for my leather
Bitch, live from the Moon
Live from this 41st speed boat
I hope you brought your sea legs
Bitch, young Bronson run ting like relays
Uh, live from the moon
Live from the moon (What)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
My third eye been powerful for ten years (Uh)
I don't got no fears (Woo), I don't got no tears (No)
I don't get caught up in the bright lights, dear (No)
And, yes, I am the human highlight reel (Yes)
They say I'm built strong like pyramids in Egypt (Uh)
Ever since a fetus, I had visions of a leader
Purple X6 truck driven by a cheetah (Uh)
Look, it's Don Cheadle (Uh), no, it's just me, ho (Me)
Live from the Moon (Feel me, yeah)
Live from the Moon, uh

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Under pressure like Mercury and Bowie
A man's never hot, nah, baby, you don't know me (Nope)
Your boys stay cozy, laying in the bed full of roses sipping rosy
Chilling with Kobes on (God damn)
Gold Rollie on the phoney arm (Uh)
Travel stars like I'm Obi-Wan (Uh)
Fuck Star Wars (uh), Indiana Jones is better, bitch (True)
Turn a bitch to Fish escovitch (Uh)
Couple mil'll make you stretch the wrist (Wrist)
Move stones, it's mega lift, catch my drift, pass the piff (Pass the piff)
Live from the Moon (Uh)
Live from the Moon, live from the Moon
Yeah, we coming live from the Moon
Welcome home
