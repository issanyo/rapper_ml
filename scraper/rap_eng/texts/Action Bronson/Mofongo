[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
'94 Roosevelt copped the green card
'99 up in the Macy's we the steam squad
Me libere, weed inside a cigere
Action Bronson, Bronsoli√±o, tigere
Taco truck wrap hotter than Serranos
You know the motto, dawg, siempre gano
Mi hermano, got the jugo in the bottle
En el camino, burning rubber, hit the throttle
Life in the fast lane, licensed to flash change
Hyphen the last name, twice when the cash came
Currently I'm moving forward from some past pain
Spit the shit that have us hopping out of glass range
Watch when people get some money how their class change
Cop a crib right by the lake for twenty [?]
Carve initials in the grass, Edward Scissorhands the bushes
Lean on Tempur-Pedic, smoking seven different kushes

[Interlude]
Pussy, pussy, pussy
We have black pussy
We have smelly pussy
We have yellow pussy

[Verse 2: Shaz]
We back by old timers
And young up-and-comers
Plot in the winter then we storming all up in summer
Fuck the dime piece, I want a deuce or better
I mean the smoke dimes fine when they give a header
Gimme a nine or eight, with a cute face
Appreciate it, shoot game, and roll blue eights
I'm on the J train, BK hop off at Myrtle
I'm on one puff away from Dante's Inferno
But I don't want to burn, unless it's crystalized
Put one high, smoke the pain away, the morning time
Only a [?], snapback vintage
[?] image on the sweater screen-printed
Same tripping, molly got me seeing visions
Lifestyle like [?]
Never slip into your holy superstitions
[?] wise, if I pull it guarantee I'm a fucking killer
