[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
My flow is crispy, hundred dollar bills
I tend to not care how niggas feel
Say what the fuck I want, bitch I'm ill
Keep it real, I ain't feeling you niggas I'm killing you niggas
Mentally rich before I sign a deal on you niggas
I get it crackin, while you niggas all rapping in whack fashion
I'm calling niggas' numbers on action that's Kat Stack-ing
Track hacking, cutting slack that can't happen
Any cat easing up on the plan, ya man scratching
I ain't parlaying with these rap niggas
I'm in the spot, rolling pot scheming plots to get my racks bigger
Any feature, on sight Doms attack nigga
Taking champagne to the brain like fuck a bad liver
Play your lane I'll be speeding down the runway
Nigga keep it raw like wrestling on Monday
Chest out, not giving a fuck to what a punk say
I know some hood niggas like Ross that's with the gunplay

[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt & Action Bronson]
Stay tuned, six Goonies in a whip
Straight Hoochie only blew me cause I'm rich
Shit, we swerve ships
Medicine that burns lips, earn chips
She only blew me cause I'm rich
Where he at/There he at(X2)
In your city where them niggas carry gats
Sperry's kicked up, it's a ferry cruise
Fuck around, leave your family on the daily news

[Verse 2: Spaceghostpurrp]
I be the Don, believe me
Making your girl tease me
Pitch-black locs I dedicate it to Eazy
Pocket full of cheesy same color Luigi
Dead presidents, the resident is breezy
Funkiest of all I ball and call shots
In your girl's spot like cars in parking lots
The block stay hot like Floridian weather
Thinking that it's not? Then try dying in leather
Better yet, ninja turtle, I'm the shredder
Attacking every rapper with my shadow black reaper
Jeeper Creeper, kidnap you from the cipher
Eliminate competitors, the verbal lyric sniper
Phonk kill you, then I kill you too
Thinking and drinking and tweaking like Purrp is that dude
Mysterious I'm killing the game so fuck the fame
Confusing rappers with the mystical maze
To make them lame

[Hook]
