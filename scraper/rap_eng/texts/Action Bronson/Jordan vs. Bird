[Intro: Maffew Ragazino]
Ragazino, Bronsolino
Slangtriloquist shit
We're pulling strings over here
You nigga's puppets with hands up your ass
You faggots
Let's do it
It's Senior

[Verse 1: Maffew Ragazino]
The face of the brown noser
Reeks with a foul odor
Rat poison on your tongue
If you mouth more than a Balboa
Crown holder in Calcutta and Serbia
Persian murderers, schizophrenia, Disturbia
Douse niggas in Bourbon, set 'em ablaze
If I ain't on the cover
Fuck a write-up on the 98th page
Rhyme Pays more than Philip Morris
Heir to the throne is set in stone
Rigor mortis

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I want the type of shit you see in the movies
Two big, bad bitches blowing me in Jacuzzi's
Til my dicky is soft
Dutch Master with the fifty a cough
Won't stop til I shit in a loft
I've been shifting the sport
Going to court, smelling of drug
Lie like a rug, fly like a dove
To the highest above
Choose my weapon wisely
9 or the snub
Double headed eagle emblem make a smile on my mug

[Verse 3: Maffew Ragazino]
200 for the Foams
Put the same price on your bones
Step in the Red Zone
They're bringing your head home
I bring the turkey bacon and bread home
My Old Lady do the dishes
City on my back, Lithuanian weightlifters
Wolf in sheep cloth, chameleon, shape-shifter
Arctic monkey's and apes, nigga
Gorillas in the concrete jungle
Tree branch bundles
Xanax tabs and coconut truffles (uh!)

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
You get laced up just like my bitch's drawers
I'm smoking on the sycamore
I'm looking like a Grizzly
So these muthafuckas hit the floor
And play dead
But that don't work because I'm smarter
And plus you see the jacket, New York Knickerbocker Starter
Dutch guts, you see 'em flying
Out the window of the whip
Cause I smoke it while I'm driving
And the pigs ain't doing shit
Same time I'm getting top from bitch with piercing on the lip
And piercing on the tit and piercing on the clit

[Verse 5: Maffew Ragazino]
Bird's eye view, goose necking
She spread eagle
Hotel Rwanda, $40 stay
Blacker than Don Cheadle
Daredevil, Evel Knievel
Empire State
With no parachute, took a leap of faith (uhhh!)
I'm off the roof when I'm off the juice
Fuck a truce, I got the juice
Nigga, you're Posdnuos, ha ha!
I rather Plug Two like Trugoy
True Blues in gargoyle shorts made of corduroy

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Lay my nuts right on your face
How do they taste?
I haven't showered
Smoking on the flower
Leather jacket, Eddie Bauer
Stuffing up some chicken
Let it roast about an hour
Take it out and carve it up
I'm on the west wing of the tower
From the land of Flushing
Ducks hang in the window
Cruise around for hours
Blowing smoke right out the rental
Flow is presidential
Hoes are on a pencil
Never sketchy with my picture
Giving Gills, call me Kendall
(whoa!)

[Outro: Maffew Ragazino]
Haha, that was oh so fucking spectacular
That was like, the alley at the end of the movie
From Wesley to Woody, hehehe
These muthafuckas ain't even know White Men Can Jump
Hahahaha
Jordan vs. Bird! Yeah!
Queens! Brownsville!
Don't try that at home, children
