[Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
Okay, okay
Any problems, you can go to Statik Selektah
Trouble with his spins, you can call Statik Selektah
But now this guy's gotta come up with his money every week
No matter what
You ain't selling records? Fuck you, pay me
Oh you want him in your video? Fuck you, pay me
No one's coming to your shows, huh? Fuck you, pay me
And then what do you do? When you can't borrow another dollar from your label, you can't sell another single in the streets, Statik Selektah lights a match. Put your shitty record on fire, motherfucka
Okay, I'm reloaded!
Yes-yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Expect the unexpected, Brooklyn connected
Now, who's hot? Who's not?
Go off
Extended Play
Selektah Statik, we're back at it
It's in the paper
The flav's about to drop

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Royal Blue Steve Harvey suits with army boots, hop in the Audi
We outtie, Queens County, call on the hounds
100 stacks on my favorite horse
300 hundred dollars for a flavored favorite broth
Keep it hidden in the neighbor's dog

[Interlude: Big Body Bes]
So what the fuck is good?
Big Fucking Body
Back where it all started
Statik Selektah
Keep fucking around with me, you weak motherfucking DJ's
You'll be nothing less
You can't eat no more, man
You'll be lucky if I let you do a block party in the Bronx
You ain't shit
Fuck outta here, man

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Move forward and we shine year round
New money, new bills, same shit, new design
So all you label execs
Cut the check, you now tuned in to Statik Selekt
Extended Play

[Verse 3: Tony Touch]
Yeah, and it's live from Bushwick
Boom back rap, yep, back on that hood shit
Tone Touch, hold up, suckas get mushed quick
With all that fuckery, y'all can't fuck with me
Rolling still, overkill
Yeah, 50 emcees, y'all know the drill
Stay cooking up shit y'all supposed to feel
See I paved the way, then Statik saved the day
