[Hook: French Montana]
Homey look at me, yeah
Why you mad? 30 chains on shining like bling
I see you mad, you want me down to my last dollar
All they holler like clean!
There they go, there they go, there they go
Shining so clean, there they go, there they go, there they go

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Shining so clean, diamonds clear, million dollar meetings in the air
Fly talk Medusa face on everything I wear
Drop head, I’m laid back, I don’t count money, I weight that
I pop ace, straight jack, I buy new, I don’t trade back
Ha, me and Harry in that two door, got that hoodie when that sudo flowing
Smoke with that roof off flying high
I be riding round with that marvelo, got a hundred rounds of a hundred pounds
30 grand did a hundred shows, like ha
Them cryin'
They want me on the corner, watch mine die
Back blocks since hair lock, cash in I jail out
Big shows I sell out, real I bail out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I’m riding ninja stars, 850 v12
I’m futuristic, clean mine with the seashells
These bitches do my feet, then place the heat to your cheeks
So I can chew the beef in Greece
The linen hanging loose now, let the loot pile
Doing indos in the coup, wild, with the roof down
And it’s pouring rain, round I put this knife right through your daughter’s name
We smoking different colors like when the autumn came
Oh, seen me sitting on the softest leather
No, me and these never walked together
They just want me for these things I have acquired
Yo, when I told you that I loved you I was lying
Smoke some

[Hook]
