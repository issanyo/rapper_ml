[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Respect the fly shit, glorious stature
My words capture
New York City's fear before the Taliban disaster
Self Induced Illness, floating in my own rapture
My niggas make flips and play cakes without a spatula
We gets it in, sample my aura as a indication
I know your story, son, your soap opera's in syndication
Exposing fraudulence with fact, your dead off vindication
Hit the bottom first to reach the top
I call it innovation
An invasion, incineration is how we burning 'em
Mean chucking a philosophy book
My voice is learning 'em
Dollar bills never came free
We steady earning 'em
At all costs, we all floss
Your team lost, I'm so boss
At least my own, release my chrome
Get blown into a different zone
X'd out and wonder Y like a male chromosome (What!)
I hold my own and my squad's well known
Don't make a nigga hand deliver punishment to your dome
It's all!

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
My mind ready like Ray Lewis
Jumping out the gray Buick
Twisted ankles never stop us
Cause we play through it
I spit that shit that make Jordan jumper a sure shot
Same shit to make 'em build a wooden room up in a whore spot
Right out the sewer, deadly with maneuver
Got the power of a rhino
And I'm agile as a puma
Suede shit be the basic
Empty clips and then replace it
Cause the verbal .47 chopping pussies get erase-d
Off the map
My silhouette, it got the hookers crazy
Poking holes up in the condom
Trying to trap me with a baby
But I keep 'em dreaming, that's for the semen
They keep on fiending
Cause nowadays it's just Brain, just call me Bobby Heenan
I'm Marley steaming
Lace the swordfish with the garlic cream and
The lemon basil caper dil, play the street for real
Cream de Ville is what I used to sport
The Yiddish lawyer with a yarmi, how this muthafucka do in court
Peugeot Sport was purchased by my father first, man
Shift with the left hand, back then he was a Mets fan
To be specific, I'm horizontal once the trees are twisted
Absorb the essence cause it changes with the seeds sifted

[Verse 3: AG Da Coroner]
You muthafuckas ain't telling me nothing
We pack the power of a Roman candle
Outdoorsmen animal, so catch us on the nature channel
Rare species, mush you in the face with feces
This is HBO rap, not regular TV
I be the type to make your wifey hand you papers
And say ya'll splitting up
Because my semen is her favorite flavor
Vanilla ice cream, Baskin Robbins got nothing on me
I'm in the hooker house with Bronson
Bitches sucking on me
Free of charge, we at large
"Love Me In a Special Way" like El DeBarge
Big time like Vinny Chase in Entourage
My team's the hardest, we like TS back in '99
Go try and find another squadron with our kind of grind
You got the king, you got the chef, you got the Coroner
You got the beast, Meyhem Lauren right in your corridor
Killa Sha, Prince, Take-It and the Animal
There's only Science, we eat rappers like a cannibal
Check the manual, wack rap niggas is food
Fuck a Ross, only Rick is Ravishing Rude
I'm from a era where your skills got you recognized
Ya'll from an era where your favorite rapper testifies
Fraudulent fucks, the game's being twisted up
And don't approach me if you ain't nice with your fisticuffs
We beat a artist down, dig his pockets, split his bucks
And that's a threat, so I dare you to try to shit on us
