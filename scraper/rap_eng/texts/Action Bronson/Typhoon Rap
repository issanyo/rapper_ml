[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Yo, I represent change like the forty-fourth president
Son, I get fresher than most, that shit's evident
Prevalent, powerful, pop on punk pussies
I'm outside ready for war with no rookies
Deadly apparel, cognac by the barrel
Soar high like a sparrow, on point like an arrow
Break bones to the marrow, mind state beyond narrow
Talladega Nights, go hard like Will Ferrell
A hot boy with cheese like a slice from Sbarro
If the rap game was Egypt you could call me a pharaoh
Rocking Timb chukkas
Living like some ice road truckers
Fuck the pigs cause I know them suckers wanna bucka-buck us
Pocket full of Maytag blue but it's green
If there's an ugly bitch, somebody better take it for the team
That's how we do, them outdoors boys mad noise
Fall back, cause the 44 long shit destroys

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The beard exquisite, cooker on the quadricep
5'7", 280, murder bars for rep
I'm Lo rockin', seat at the Kentucky Derby
It's either that, Nasty Nate, Knickerbocker jersey
Marty Puccio cool it with bully shit
This travel bag got the semi with the fully shift
I'm fully equipped to leave you in a pool of your shit
And leave your shorty droolin' on dick
Prosciutto slice is thinner than a model bitch
Fresh grapes that were pressed into a bottle bitch
My bottom bitch, servin' me with olives, bitch
Shorty graduated college, bitch, switch
Super suburb, Martha Stewart, good with the herbs
I'm Bobby Flay, cookin' the birds
Yo, I'm Martin Yan, what you talkin 'bout a knife
Still we ate the chicken, We talkin' 'bout your wife

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Fuck the fake shit, we rock Champion hoods
And run up in spots, making them pop, who got the goods
Trying to be the next mogul, young gassed, sipping on Mobil
Extra vocal? Not me, I'm anti-social
Beyond local, fuck hopeful, I make it happen
Heavy strapping, deadly beaming, steady scheming
Any demons up in my path will get banished
My rhymes make niggas rebuild, like water damage

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]

El Pozolero, cocinero, it's the wild guero
The new Lebron up on my feet
Step on the Beamer pedal
We heaving rebels with the freeze and pebbles
Potent shit like the harvest of marijuana
Once the season settles
Twenty five, but that shit I spit is timeless
Swimming with piranhas, throw the penis in vaginas
Your highness, seen with a stunning queen
Diamonds like a French bread
A hundred geese, we sipping Burgundys in southern Greece
