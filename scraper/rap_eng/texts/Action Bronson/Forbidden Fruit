[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
As I step in the door, you in your bathrobe
Pour you a little more wine, I see your glass low
Scared of a real man, from dealing with these assholes
Just drink ya wine and then will step up in the bath, slow
Soak your body, cause its begging for a loving touch
Light the candle, and ima light another Dutch
Then we slip into a place that's only you & me
Put it deep, like the bottom of the bluest sea
You too young to be locked down, truancy
Always got ya hair down, rockin your jewelry
Killing these other bitches, word, reading their eulogy'
Hips insane
The pussy? Foolery
At the end of the day baby it's you & me
At the end of the day honey it's you & me
Just you & me
