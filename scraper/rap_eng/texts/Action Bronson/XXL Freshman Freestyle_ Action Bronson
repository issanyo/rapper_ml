Winter time, the Beamer color Danny Glovers neck
Better be careful who you runnin' with
I'm at the top of the food chain there's blood inside the water
I had to grow up fast because I had to feed my daughter, right
Make this right at the light
Pop a Uie lite the ooey
Now I'm higher than some Ewing's
Breezing on the belt
Rocking sheep skin sheeps at bay
Damn Bronson why you be that way
Bitch I'm still that same motherfucker that you know from youth
From goof troop
Now you sticking drugs inside your poop shoot
New Coupe on the duce felxin' heavy
Perfect plex her pussy at the Getty
I'm alpha feddie
Pull the limo on the lawn
Jump out I'm just hallucinating, acid and a Knicks hat
Burner in her dress pants
Knife inside my left hand
Now theres just a dead lamb
Tryin' to feed my fam
Ooh yeah, ten golden grams
No bears
Fold paper like chairs
Pulled off capers by the stairs
Capers on the veal piccata
Lost paper cuz Prince Fielder couldn't field a fucking pop up
Fucking bastard, it's me
