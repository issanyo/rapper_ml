[Intro]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Get 'em!

[Chorus]
I'm the man right now
I got the plan right now
Fuck that, I got the world in my hand right now
I should be somewhere sunny, gettin' tanned right now
Uh, but I'ma show you how to move
I'ma show you how to dance
Got the pistol in my pants
I got the pistol in my pants
I'ma show you how to dance, uh

[Verse 1]
The full moon make me loco
Like I sniffed a whole baseline of coco
Man, I took the speedboat for a joy ride
At one point I was flyin' baby, no lie
What'd I do to have a life like this?
Ass so fat on my wife like, shit!
And your boy got a stomach like Buddha
Chandelier hanging from the ceilin' of the Cougar, ah
50K in a swimtrunk in a brown paper bag like a kid's lunch
Thug passion in a sippy cup
A 100 dollars worth of haze in a blunt, bitch

[Chorus]
I'm the man right now
I got the plan right now
Fuck that, I got the world in my hand right now
I should be somewhere sunny, gettin' tanned right now
Uh, but I'ma show you how to move
I'ma show you how to dance
Got the pistol in my pants
I got the pistol in my pants
I'ma show you how to dance, uh

[Bridge]
One time for the big girls
Two time for the big girls
Ooh, you know that I need that
Uh, you can find me where the weed at
One time for the big girls
Two times for the big girls
Ooh, you know that I need that
Uh, you can find me where the weed at

[Interlude]
Somebody sleepin' in my bed

[Verse 2]
All I do is bump Dru Hill
Damn, I should have took the blue pill, it's too real
I signed for two for 22 mil'
Option for the third
You ain't poppin' on the curb
We never see you in the street
And me, I'm always on the town
You hear me?

[Chorus]
I'm the man right now
I got the plan right now
Fuck that, I got the world in my hand right now
I should be somewhere sunny, gettin' tanned right now
Uh, but I'ma show you how to move
I'ma show you how to dance
Got the pistol in my pants
I got the pistol in my pants
I'ma show you how to dance, uh
