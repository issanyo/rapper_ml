[Intro:]
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Jump out of the sun roof of the 540
[?] shawty grind on me
She tried to get me for my shine
Put the 9 on me
Fuck, Devil's design shooting blind for me
I won the belt like seven times
Couple dimes on me
I snap my fingers there's a cheese plate
The joint bigger than a deer's leg
You can catch me squatting beer kegs
Carrying rock not in the sock no more
We on a yacht, stop pop a Uie
Rivals i chopped them in chop suey
Throw 'em in the front trunk
Target 86 royal blue with the lip
Thick like the one's for sucking dick
You'll get lifted like my son when i see him
I can't wait 'til he driving something European
Leather smell like tea tree oil in the Z3
A lot of people wanna be me

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Yo, flow in the coupe and move godly
Hit 'em with the bag of that robby
If they won't give you honesty
They ain't giving you loyalty
My rep is made of gold
Ain't no bullshit destroying me
Shit i been that guy
Gold chains, gold frame
Son, I've been that fly
I got pierogis that'll break curfew to break a nigga face
Shoot you with your gun
Take the hammer off a nigga waist
I'm off the scene, I'm seen when I'm supposed to be
Never let the money escape i keep it close to me
I keep my bank accounts full and my nuts empty
Low hanging fruit taste good, sometimes these sluts tap me
Then they cause problems, then they start shit
Then i think to myself
Why'd i think with my dick
It's the black Batman Bruce Wayne
Who sell 'caine [?] push ups the clip i stay sober
If niggas wanna put up they hands, it's game over
Laurenovich

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The moon hit me in the way
That pictures couldn't capture my stature
Like a major league catcher
It's quite confusing cause I'm Casper
International 100 Hello Kitty stamps inside the passport
Since i appeared on the earth like a terminator
E30 got German plates on the [?]
Split the arrow with the arrow cause sparrow flies
Channel Pharaoh's with the [[?] ?]
Sport's boat 26 feet Nordica seas
Dancing naked on the shore of the beach, hedonism too
It ain't shit to do division with your crew
We all living boo
It ain't nobody wearing prison suits
Tan carhartt's  [?] scars like the sheep
[?] sheeps still sleep by the creek
Crocodile infested but to me it's just a bunch of boots
Always on the hunt for the loot

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Saut√©es and fricassee smoked crabs different trees
[?] the pistols breeze then we dipped in V's
Suave rooftops out the American sugar
My niggas got the torch to heat the metal for the booker
Me, I'm a sober weirdo, I still wear 'lo
Lifestyle based on defense so we prepare tho
Prepare tho i had to fix the situation
The crab meat placed on your plate is imitation
Now me i get it right out the shell
I [?] know my team get locked  he getting right out the cell
Post bail hit Perfections have a drink and we think'
How to calculate correctly while we covered in mink
Summertime shootouts, springtime stick ups
Tri-colored Gucci skully's wintertime pick ups
Rep for Queens major since I was a minor
You might've seen me in the Georgia Diner
