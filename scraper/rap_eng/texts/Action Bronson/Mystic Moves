[Intro]
Astral projection is something very easy to understand but not so easy to accomplish
Astral projection is quite literally projection of astral...

[Verse 1: Spit Gemz]

Philly after philly, crack another beer
This is what happens before the crack you wanna hear
I can piss a six pack, I need a keg to listen clear
I don't smoke no crack and I don't sniff no coke
I'm allergic to needles and I ain't never fuck with dope
I used to drop tabs, even candy flipped, shroomed out
Wet clouds, sipping on banana liq's, moved crowds
Like banana clips
Boo loud when you faggots spit
I despise what you did the culture
I define what it is to be cultured (yeah)
Brutally honest so real brothers quote it
Suckers'll be the last ones to say that it was spoken
We the remaining fragments of a love that was broken
Any opposers will get chopped, bagged and brung to the ocean
Dragged by their mask and strangled with the flag for encroachment
If you know nothing just know that death is approaching

[Verse 2: Shaz Illyork]

Throwing flames on the gas stub
When I was strapped up
Ran up, laid 'em down, never masked up
That's why I fucked up
That's how it crumbles
When you gamble in the Babel
Remarkable with handle
Scars like tattered memory from past battles
Call it like I see it and all I see is puss
You know I got the magnums
I wish a nigga would
Push it to the point where point blank is needed
So fucking close that it mangled up his features
A beast like Mason when he's snatching a rebound
You pussy, I don't hand you
Scared to put the heat down
You just flash and not shooting
You fucking will repute it
So lose it, it's obvious, stupid
Pouring out a little low and brow for the grave stricken
Take a sip, pass it off, then go straight fishing

[Midtro]
Astral projection is something very...

[Verse 3: OPrime39]

Every line felt, I make your mind melt
As I excel, clientele seen the crime well
Fine hell, Dave Chappelle, Seinfeld, funny
I stay hungry
Call my Kleinfeld for bail money
Only time tell, so they wait on the word
Cracking the curb
Smack a herb for reciting my words
Straight Hennessy be making me slurred
The combination from the knuckle game
You wake in a blur
Paper to earn, we headline, they waiting for turns
Out for mine, so play the curb and observe
Verse is superb, burning through your head like a perm
Caught a jerk, crooked cop'll clap a perp and he swerved
Body submerged, I  formulating masterpieces
The closest thing to God to walk after Jesus
Hot potato, passing pieces
Middle finger, pass the precincts
Graduated stealing all my past releases
Master thesis

[Verse 4: Solace]

High roller, the money folder
Control the solar
Crack your molar
Heart's colder than the polar
I sip a Jack and cola while your shorty sniff the yola
Til she featherhead
M3 Beam Imola, leather red
Hardtop convertible drops
Cream of the crop
First time ever seen parked on the block
Rock the gold, same lash, Shaz, spaz
Bronson, port of Shiraz
Pinky's in the air
Toasting the glass
Rolling the grass, closing the past
Cold bars like Alcatraz
Young Spanish kid stay dipped
Out for cash
Peep through the shades
Spades, playing chirades
Wasting on strays
Niggas blazing haze
Spray your brigades
Renegades with grenades
Or better said, thoroughbreds
Savage barbarians that Q-Boro bred
The fly shorty infuser from St. Lucia
That's Nadia, she'll body ya
Let's skate off to LaGuardia
Sweep a shorty off of her feet
To get the oral
Then proceed to give her backshots
Like epidural
Don't get left with the fish
Swimming through coral
Striking plural
End of story, get the moral

[Verse 5: Action Bronson]

I got the Ruger for Christmas
Scoop up your princess
My team moving rocks like Žydrūnas Savickas
Full length dinner and that consists of twenty platters
Duck confit, a little jam, a little sour
Twisted off the flower, blooming in the basement
Knick hat from '95, the signature from Mason
See my facial hair and then you're staring in amazement
Look down at my dick and want to taste it
For women only
Burrito blunts and paper cuts
We drink the margaritas
Star-ish features and I'm also known to carve a creature
That I've sacrificed, nutrition on behalf of life
Roasted like eleven hours, work yourself an appetite
Hash is Turkish, shiny on the surface
Extra virgin, cold press product after purchase
Come to skirmish, leave you twirling like the whirling Dervish
Watch for snakes that slither silent
Uhhh

[Outro]
Astral projection is something very easy to understand but not so easy to accomplish
