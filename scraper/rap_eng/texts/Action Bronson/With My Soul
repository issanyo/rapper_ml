[Intro]
This is a disgrace before God Almighty
It stinks in the nostril of God

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
What if Allen Iverson was Chinese riding on a Harley
And ?
Me and A$ton throwing chopper parties
Come through the court room with three lawyers
The snub nose look like Verne Troyer
Burn books to slander the name
Got one hand in the game
The other hand in the cane, I struggle with fame
Raw dope pump through my veins
Pumping my brakes before your father getting dumped in the lake
Missing, found never, brown leather jacket player
Take a bitch and decapitate her black potatoes
Silence the missile
Little bit of drugs in the tissue
You are not official
Damn I gotta take a piss

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
Feelin like Michael McDonald I'm Gone With the Wind
Hopped out the coffin to parallel park in the Benz
Maraschino is the color within
Can't tell a paint job from my skin
Walked in and left my nuts on her chin
She offered her friend, jacked off got my palm full of sins
At church use the same hand to dump the offering in
Lord forgive me but it's nothing when they know you're the man
Got me feeling like the Great Bambino
Can't pickle the beast, this industry weak
Sign a deal for a mill don't make you real in these streets
My nerve is bad and my killers bout to kill you for cheap
Stick to the beats cause bodies dropped if I'm feelin' this beat
Silly rabbit switch rims to join the static
Got that Ali magic
Realest since Big Pun you lookin' at it
