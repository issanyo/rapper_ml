[Intro: Action Bronson]
Fuck man, psh
Put Love & Hip Hop on mute please
Yeah, turn that off
Put some crazy shit on man
Put the nature channel on
I wanna see a fuckin’ deer get eaten
Let me see an alligator bite something man
I can’t handle all this lovey dovey shit man
Why you had to go and do me like that?
I’m so emotional right now, I still love you though
I’m so emotional right now, you don’t even know

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Uh, I come home after a long trip
Waiting where I left you
Couldn’t wait to kiss you
Smelled your scent from the door
Answer the door in a red velour
I only get head on tour
Cause they can’t have what’s yours
Shorty Greek, with an African physique
She tasted like a peach and her eyes were green
I’m headed to the beach take this ride with me
And don't babysit the weed bitch get high with me
Jagged Edge played her legs spread
She said she needed me inside of her
She held me tighter, told her, “Pass the weed
Pull your panties to your feet
Just don’t ruin my seats, you little freak"
Now it’s been years of creeping
And I’ve been thinking about forever lately
Your body feel like heaven baby
Come and save me
Cause at the end of the day
It’s me, it’s me baby

[Hook: Elle Varner]
I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)
I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)
I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)
I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Man, how you gonna leave me like that?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon’ get right back
At least I thought so
I guess your negative energy and your insecurities
Drew me to drawing a blank
I got a new thang, and everythang is straight
Wait, you wasn’t even the only one in the first place
Couldn’t even say if you knew better, you'd do better
Cause you knew better, and you still acting like a bitch
Texts all day but don’t say shit
It’s okay boo, I don’t blame you
I know that this backwards society raised you
Taught you to play on your phone and watch cable
So while I play on your mind like I’m a Jedi
I’m probably eating a ribeye, finna hop on a red eye
Rolling up the green that shit that give you them red eyes
You're still a bad bitch, it’s just time to say goodbye

[Hook: Elle Varner]
I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)
I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)
I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)
I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)
