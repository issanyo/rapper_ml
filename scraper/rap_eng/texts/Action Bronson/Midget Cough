[Intro: Action Bronson speaking]
Yeah
It’s me
I’m here
Swerve
Light it

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo
I’m on the PCH, smokin’ THC
With the team, money be the dream
I take it multicolor baby, it ain’t gotta be green
On the other side of earth with the queen, I’m from Queens
Shit, 3 different types of forks for a Monday lunch
Tamarind punch, higher than a javelin jump
Italian sluts, my whole battalion is nuts
We rock medallions and such
Don’t even step within six feet of my presence
Leave you open like the desert, Def Leopard, Fresh pepper
Did I mention, steer the whip with one arm like Jim Abbott
Chocolate sauce over thin rabbit
If these opportunities arose before we would’ve been had it
Shorty sniffing haddock in the attic
I been an addict in these streets, in my pants I’ve even shatted
Then sat in it, sadly
Two things about to cop a few rings
And eat paper thin slices of the Blue Ling
Shoot eagles on a Jack Nicklaus course, Porsche with the triple exhaust
Seats soft like a midget’s cough

*coughs*
Yeah, let’s hear that fly shit
*coughs*
Yeah man
Oh fuck

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I never thought that this could be my life
Russian mistress and Parisian wife
Always seasoned rice, the animals you find in the jungle on the table sculpted in ice
Throw the dice
Leg drop after a big boot
1, 2, 3, it’s over, slide in the mint coupe
Dive out the chopper in the water, uh
No splash, Olympic shit
Ayo, the spliff look like a shrimp when it shit
Smoke the shark, Greg Norman shit, me and Robert Horry in a foreign whip
Motherfucka I was born to live
And born to fuck a lot of pussy without spawning kids
It’s me
