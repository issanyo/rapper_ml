[Intro: Action Bronson]
Ah, yeah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I'm glad I never used cocaine, 'cause I would be an addict
Running 'round town ass naked, chase rabbit
They found me face down at the Great Lake Tavern
A payday pattern, the fake ID said “JJ Adams”
My other one was stolen by a madame
She whispered to the hooker like, “We have him”
She was right, I was blinded by the pussy like
Gotta make it home because my wifey said it's cookie night
Plus I owe two hundred large to the bookie
I think I might boogie

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Head crack, bread stack, I'm a G
Iced out like Pat Ewing's knee
All white, alright, I'm the hood pope
Break night, take flight, got the good dope
Adidas Boost on, looking like a highlighter
True fact, I'm a livewire
Got denied at the red light district
Shorty said I probably break wombs with this dick
My life is the fountain of youth
Let a rapper talk slick, he'll get found in the booth
Draw mom on my face and rock one gold tooth
Then it's back to the strip, gotta get more loot
Persian lamb jackets, chinchilla collars
Surgeon hand ratchets, winners get dollars
