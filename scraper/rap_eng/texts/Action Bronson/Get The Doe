[Verse 1: Solace]

Yo
From this point on, we made men
Living splendid, the struggles ended
Only stress is thinking how to spend it
Retirees in our twenty's, swimming in Benny's
White Henny fountains, counting, thumbs numb
Pretty pennies
Log cabin getaways on mountains to chill
Cop my pop a house on the hill
The spouse in Brazil
Yeah, I keeps a Adriana Lima in the Beamer
Riding shotty with the mini shotty in between a-
Mind of a schemer, made it out with a team of-
Vigilantes who raise the ante
Now the grass is greener, flash the nina
For target practice not for survival
The proper salutations, popping bottles, announcement of my arrivals
We living like the Kennedy's
Mini mansion with mad amenities
Start zoning, stock bonds and treasury's
With clean baldies and low caesars
Spoil nieces
Tour the globe for no reason
Lord Jesus!

[Hook: Timeless Truth & Action Bronson]

Living the dream, counting cream through money machines
Still water's bubble, while we chilling and rising with steam
Queens!
From the docks to the back blocks
Got 67 mil, kid, we hit the jackpot!

Living the dream, counting cream through money machines
Still water's bubble, while we chilling and rising with steam
Queens!
From the docks to the back blocks
Got 67 mil, kid, we hit the jackpot!

[Verse 2: Oprime39]

Yo, yo
Talking parrots, writing ballads in my Caesar Palace
Living lavish, treat my peeps to join a feast in Paris
Stylish, 50 karat rocks, 50 pounds of pot
Silence, 50 caliber shots from mountain tops
Making a toast for man's sake
Went from a ? kid with bad grades
To landscapes and mad papes
See dollar signs for clarity
Out for the win, cleaning my sins through charity
Exotic whips, Poland Spring dripping fountain tips
Stick to the biz, crib for the kids
That's how it is
Saltwater tanks and Swiss bank accounts
This ain't a hobby
We embody what you rap about
Topless cars and bottomless broads
Roam the motherland, gun in hand, bow to the God's
Pop labels on the reg, only sporting in 1's
Draw on wiseguys for fun
Speaking coke for the funds
So what up?!

[Hook: Timeless Truth & Action Bronson]

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]

Fuck man, fuck, uhhhhh...

Ayo
Step in the place
Rocking lion like I'm Jaffe Jo
Haze in abundance for the evening
Yes, I cop fa sho
Choosing goblets like I'm Indy in the cave, dog
Twin bidets, lord, spread up on the center page
Before the score, all we had were thoughts of better days
Right out of Flushing, where they're known to let the metal blaze
Half out the pocket, with the hanky on the center stage
Take the bar right off the coupe and let it ventilate
Back To The Future, my DeLorean waits
Underneath this chunky stomach, I'm like Dorian Yates
Hardbody, mix of John Gotti and Gandhi
Known to wheelie the Ducati right up into the lobby
Then hop off, flip a cop off, twist the hot sauce
While shorty bring a drink
Other fly shorty taking my socks off
Take a knee when we hopping out of something, whore
We do the damn thing
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Ball!
