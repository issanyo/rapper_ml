[Intro: Riff Raff]
Haters can't stand me (stand me)
Man I shoulda won a Grammy
Man I shoulda won a Grammy
Shoulda won a Grammy
Haters can't stand me
Shoulda won a Grammy
I done came down got more publishing than Bambi
Haters can't stand me
Haters can't stand me

[Hook: Riff Raff]
Haters can't stand me
Shoulda won a Grammy
I done came down got more publishing than Bambi
Haters can't stand me
Yea these Haters can't stand me
Haters can't stand me
Haters can't stand me
Shoulda won a Grammy
I done came down got more publishing than Bambi
Haters can't stand me
Haters can't stand me
Yea these Haters can't stand me
Man I shoulda won a Grammy
These haters can't

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Don't get confused
Princess Leia jewels
Jumped out the coupe with Versace parachute
Sailor Jerry shoes and the tint navy blue
Rap game Langston Hughes and the candy chartreuse
Hotter than a soup bowl fresh up outta Ju-Co
Diamond yugoslavia, shooting jumpers Toni Kukoc
Crawfish who drove, Cordon blue
360 windmill with eight rocks up in my shoes (thats crack!)
OJ Simpson I'm the head honcho
Coulda played for Toronto but they found a dead body in the back of my Bronco
Riff Raff for Mayor, Jody President
I shoulda won a Grammy for all this ice up under my chin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I got my face on the drug pen
Put me in your mouth
Cakes up in the oven keep the burners in the couch
Lakers vs the Celtics
Hogging up two floor seats cause I'm selfish
Melted butter on the shellfish
Knife about a pelvis
Dancin' like a Spanish
Pull up in a Ghost bust the candy Rick Moranis
Gold rollies sit on the wrist like a turkey sandwich
Run them forty in four flat
Way faster than a horse jack

[Hook]
