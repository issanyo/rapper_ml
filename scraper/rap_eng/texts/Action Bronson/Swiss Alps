[Meyhem Lauren]

Word, Meyhem Lauren, Thorotracks, all day
My nigga Action Bronson, what!, Queens shit
Always official, check it

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]

Vicious apparel gets displayed when I'm outside
We golden, fresh clothing
Fiends frozen, detects, the blocks moldering
Weight holding since the 90's, my nigga, we get it popping
Coke pure like Hip Hop when New York was vacant lotting
Slapboxing as a teen, got my skills correct
Flows correct, blows direct, fuck y'all niggas expect?
COD, never debt, we scrape bitches, get neck
Take a loaded .44 and play Russian Roulette
Before you try to put a person like myself in check
Dominant steez, Black Barkley's and white keys get chipped
Now I got a little something to flip
It's never makeshift, Meyhem Lauren ain't a myth
Marvelous gift, repeatedly rip fly production
Got Thorotracks holding me down
Nigga it's nothing
Catch me chilling with them sinister niggas
Right on the block
Peace to One Eighteen and Metropolitan
What up, ack?

Word up, son, that's that street shit right there
Super visual lyrics, son, I paint pictures for y'all niggas
Straight up and down, this is Meyhem Lauren
Ayo, Action, tell these niggas what it is, son?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]

I got it

Man down, stand ground
Queens is the home of the livest niggas, hands down
Break bread, break Dutch's and we break necks
6 niggas, 1 bitch with no latex
Gray Beamer, no top when it's 20 degrees
Lo shorts, sour diese', fuck I gotta disease
Big holster, handheld shit that's laying horses
Suede enforcer, smooth and rugged
Like a grayish Porscha
Moonlit, the return of the goon shit
A full clip make a faggot do a full split
That spoon shit, leaning over like a bellyache
My niggas form, get the Jelly cake, celebrate
Divine wisdom, you'll be left with the down syndrome
Brontosaurus mack 10, nickel 9 glisten
Street piston, lighting woolies up in public places
Fuck a hooker on a daily basis
40 aces

[Action Bronson]

Okay, my niggas eating rare reindeer meat
Fly muthafucking outfits
Lavish bedspreads, nickel 9's, rugers, macks
Let's do it!

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]

Mixtapes and strip steaks'll brighten them with a big face
Official like a bullet used to pop cops and hit jakes
We stomp fakes
My team takes the money outside
Boxcutters, black biscuits, niggas know how we ride

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]

Slide, Clyde Frazier with the paper, 260
Rock 60 60 shot, dip them rockets out the spiffy sock
Hammer holding, fucking bitches with the hairy colon
Fly a kite to prison, sent by the canary, golden

[Verse 5: Meyhem Lauren]

Keep competition folding
Gotta keep my pockets swollen
Police be strolling, rolling
Striking like they going bowling
Live lyric illustrator
Rough rap facilitator
Back block exhilarator
Dirty money, killer paper

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]

My nigga Steele would rape you
Living lavish on the edge
I'll do you damage, split your cabbage
Piss all on the bed
I'm like a savage, maimed and ravaged
Fill the clips with lead
Stuffed into baggage
Like a sandwich, baker, brick to bread
