[Verse 1]
She had the sweetest scent I ever smelt a woman have
Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag
She had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid
Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers
And selling the pussy for paper to play
Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel
She quick to split up an owl
She loves some dick in her bowels
Dabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour
Straight flieshman
In the private part of her pussy pocket
Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hookers auction
Left as a crooked orphan
Wrapped in the sports section
Box score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what

[Bridge]
Make this fucking bitch sit in vinegar
Apple cider baths
Sit in the vinegar
Bronsolino
PS

[Verse 2]
Yo, so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone
You're a constant, fucked you in the school closet
We were young then, experimental periods
Laid a towel cause I fucked you on your period
Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King
Young love, but we thought it was eternity
Raw sex – never thought about paternity
But now this cunt is trying to murder me
Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery, just to show it off
This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off
Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song
Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes
She hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head
.25 out the pussy and it spits lead
We always end up in a situation
She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace

[Riff 1]
I rap now, bitches sucking like a vacuum
On the bed, stay bent like a smack spoon
Bubble butt thicker than the double dutch
In the van, leave her tied up in bumblefuck

[Verse 3]
Cold, tired and I mean it
I thought we'd grow to old farts in Phoenix
Well now you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit
But I've been here since the beginning, like a prefix
But I'mma to do what I gotta do
Trying to make this french dough like a Pâte à Choux
Over your head, after sex shorty hold me in bed
Smoking Ethiopian red
The son rose, a single teardrop fallopians bled
Nowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed
It's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain
I keep the weiner on display for the campaign

[Riff 2]
I'm just doing what I had to do
Tryna Drop me in the ground but I'm not going
To the top till I fall just like Owen
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Outro]
