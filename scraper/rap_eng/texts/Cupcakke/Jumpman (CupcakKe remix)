Never will I do a false alarm
Hit the Matrix if you see I'm armed
Get a call at 3AM I'm finna do harm
It is not just for State Farm (Correct)
Nigga dont check for me if you dont got me a check (Hell naw)
Walk in the trap and they know I'm there to collect
Red beamer with a blue clip, if you making noise I need a Q-tip
Kill a nigga like  woopty do
Keep my dogs with me thats Scooby Doo
Stay on the block like street lights
Watching niggas while shooting dice
Got Chinese bangs so If I bang
I can turn yo brain to Shrimp fried rice
In a hot moment, nigga I'm on it
Selling that dope till 4 in the morning
Bringing that dough in and busting the door in
Dont gotta show em just come to the Lowend and I will appear
See through a nigga so quick like they made of sheer
Sick as fuck with these beats sniff and sneeze
Man I'm in need of care
No I'm not a thug I dont show no love
Stepping over bodies like the front door rug
I be moving juggs, take a nigga plug
Hit em with the 9 all you see is play
Ping pong with your body, snatch you out your Versace
Got a couple niggas that need those, so its adios to the migos
Come through that bitch with a auto mo' clip
If yo body don't flip you'll get it, three more
Gimme all your change, you won't see a thing
Play a nigga like casinos
Paparazzi tryna Twitter watch me
Why the fuck you even gotta creep tho?
My niggas come around they'll strip you down
You'll think that shit was a peepshow
I stay trying to be pleasant but I change you up like a status
I stay trying to be humble but I pull a bitch out her bundles
Guys with me, they a lil tipsy but they all got it on they waist
Step dead in that nigga face made that nigga say gimme space
(Uh) Say you better with the wordplay, nigga who the fuck just lied?
Labels pick you up and then drop you off they took you for a Uber ride
Hell naw'll you a character, scare yo ass on the regular
I got niggas plugged up in jail
They'll turn Eric to a cute Erica
Jumpman , jumpman,  jump man he don't need to jump in
My niggas finna bust they just want one more pump in
Blast the fucking music so they won't hear nothing
Cause when my niggas shoot yo dumbass must did something
Oh no!
