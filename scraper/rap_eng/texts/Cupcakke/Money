[Verse 1]
Ayo, I'm walking like a zombie, my money never sleep
Money come and go, but this is what I keep
They say money make you talk, but I don't say a bit
It's all over the floor, shawty can't you sweep?
I used to be poor, but now I'm never cheap
I stayed in the studio, never count for my peeps
I'm in the night hustlin', call me the Grim Reap
I said I'm in the night hustling', call me the Grim Reap

[Hook]
M-O-N-E-Y, it really keeps me fly till the day I'm gonna die
I'm layin' in my grave with my money on the side
As long as I got money baby, I'ma still rise

M-O-N-E-Y, it really keeps me fly till the day I'm gonna die
I'm layin' in my grave with my money on the side
As long as I got money baby, I'ma still rise

[Verse 2]
I see a couple niggas tryna break all my money
Grown men trying to holla, even them bad homies
My pockets stay with bread, it ain't white, it's wheat
So bow down to me, niggas who tryna eat
Welcome to some competition
Never could you defeat, 'cause I'll kill you
And grill your body meat
My money come first, that's what y'all should realize
'Cause I'm that model type, while your girl shopping at plus size

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I put you females in the back because all y'all do is front
It's not good to lie, all you little stunts
Females getting on they knees, just to make that money
But I'm just dropping bars, and making hella money
And you can't step to me without a job
'Cause I eat expensive food, not no corn on a cob
Man I swear I love the dough, I should've been a chef
Fucking with my money man get you put straight to death
Silly little hoes, dicks ain't for kids
They swear they getting money sharing 20 dollar ribs
Play with my money man, you might catch a drill
(Wait let me rephrase that) I might get you killed

[Hook]

[Outro]
Out here hustling man
Breaking these rubberbands
How much is it?
B it's no biggie
