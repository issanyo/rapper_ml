[Verse 1]
Couldn't get no sleep last night (not at all)
Throwing up like I'm dizzy from a flight (I'm sick as fuck)
Mom bugging for nothing, she so uptight
She said, "It gotta go if you staying here for the night" (What?)
"It's important, abort it," that's what they all said
Rubbing my stomach to feel it
Don't wanna kill it, that's dead
Will I still go to heaven?
Will I still get my blessings?
When I leave the doctor's office, would I feel like a felon?
I'm kinda aggy
Shame I got a fucked up baby daddy
Would have been a good mother
To love her 'til I'm wrinkled and saggy
Like a test, I'm stressed and hella naggy
'Cause this shit cut deep, like it stab me
The nurse under my skirt looking for the body parts
This vacuum hurt, I just hope it don't leave scars
In the mirror, I'm staring, I'm so embarrassed
Feel like my soul selling quicker than clothes up on the fucking clearance

[Hook]
Wish I would have borned you on this Earth (Lord knows)
I'm not alive inside, I feel the worst (Lord knows)
I'm torn about my unborn, and it hurts hard (hurts hard)
Now I'm scarred for life, just like a birthmark (birthmark)
Wish I would have borned you on this Earth (Lord knows)
I'm not alive inside, I feel the worst (Lord knows)
I'm torn about my unborn, and it hurts hard (hurts hard)
Now I'm scarred for life, just like a birthmark (birthmark)

[Verse 2]
Can't buy no baby clothes, can't feed her SpaghettiO's
Can't squeeze her fat cheeks or kiss her baby rolls
Clean her toes even when it's gross
Can't be there when she grow up
Receive her first rose from her first crush or buy her first clutch
But instead, I'm in the hospital bed and doing no such (nah)
Yeah, that nigga fucked me, but he don't give no fuck (nah)
So much baby weight, I can't even do a toe-touch
Made this decision 'cause I'm not ready
On minimum wage and ain't no gas in the Chevy (I need help)
My family and friends shame me, ain't that petty?
Got me sleeping with one eye open, like I'm Fetty
'Cause at the moment they can't stand me (gave up)
Didn't wanna have it by a deadbeat (I didn't)
Damn, if only I had a plan B
My baby father only offered me a Plan B (fucked up)

[Hook]
Wish I would have borned you on this Earth (Lord knows)
I'm not alive inside, I feel the worst (Lord knows)
I'm torn about my unborn, and it hurts hard (hurts hard)
Now I'm scarred for life, just like a birthmark (birthmark)
Wish I would have borned you on this Earth (Lord knows)
I'm not alive inside, I feel the worst (Lord knows)
I'm torn about my unborn, and it hurts hard (hurts hard)
Now I'm scarred for life, just like a birthmark (birthmark)
