[Intro]
Dont look at me like that
Have you ever seen a pretty face before?
Well you won't
You know why? Because I wear all black everything
All black gloves, oh lemme see what else
Oh, all black mask (mmmmm)
Well lemme tell you what I want you to do
I want you to go get every fucking bullet you ever had mate
Go get it! Hurry up and go get it!
Because by the time  I'm done with you
Your gonna need a motherfucking halo mate!

[Verse 1]
Yo, You gone end up in a cemetery
I'm a shoot the scene like I'm Tyler Perry
Got Mariah with me with a duffle bag so you never know what we fucking carry
I'm a come through with my homies yo whole hood finna know me
They wanna fuck me up I start squaring up I said "come on nigga just show me"
Them bullets flying like eagles I'm a shoot a nigga no free throw
I stay thirsty to catch bodies so you know I gotta fucking P bro
Pop a nigga in the mouth like D-low
What you say? You can't breathe joe
Mollywhopped again took yo oxygen
Them 40's still wet it like J-Lo
You better come correct when you see me
Cause  I'll take ya shit like I'm Stevie
See I'm Stevie J with them bullet trays like Joseline you gone need me
Got cold blood of killers not Speedy Gonzales
I hang with them dealers but I'm the top driller I am a go getter be going Godzilla
Moonwalk on your grave I'm a call that shit Thriller

[Pre-Hook]
This not no gimmick , Bitch this is my image
You fuck with me like Rosemary's baby I'll leave you timid
This not no gimmick , Bitch this is my image
You fuck with me like Rosemary's baby I'll leave you timid

[Hook]
Got you wet, got you timid boy
I got you timid boy
Ski mask , black gloves, my image boy
I got you timid boy, timid boy
Ski mask, black gloves, my image boy

[Verse 2]
Man down why you on the block selling dope
Won't see me coming like Ray Charles with a telescope
You kill two of my niggas I'm killing four
When I clap that back just duck low
I really don't fuck with you fuckers
Sleeping on me you'll get smothered
Fuck around call up yo mother
Like I put your son face on a plugger
I need a couple entrees , pair of Lebron J's
Duck tape and rope and let it be broad day
All black room I can show you the shuffle
Leave the room by myself, he'll be in my duffle
Hit the corner store grab a bag of Ruffles
Eat the chips , grab the clip then I'm back to trouble
Chitown it's a motherfuckin' jungle
Tell you like it is we ain't even gotta mumble like
Take you out the picture with one shot you getting cropped
Pull a trigger play with your body like Photoshop
With no doubt, the block cleared out when I pulled out the motherfucking Glock
(Uh) Niggas gotta learn at some point
I'll make a nigga learn at gunpoint
Spray niggas and I ain't talkin no mase
Put a couple holes in yo head like a crate

[Hook + Post Hook]
