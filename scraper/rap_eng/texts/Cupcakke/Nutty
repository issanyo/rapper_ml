I'm dropping shit like a clumsy baby I murder beats thats every daily
Fuck with me you get paste on it milk cartons a have your face on it
Lowkey I'm stacking wheat bread  clean them racks you heard what I said
Bend them knees and give me Amber Cole

Rocking bulletproofs in the summer time
Kill the rhytmn on the beat and I ain't serve no time
Like Jack & Jill I'm fucking flexing took ya bread left you anorexic
Aye little bitch fix your face and tell yo nigga to give me space
Please dont kill my vibe ,trill my whole fucking team they eating meals
Stop jocking my man dick nutty I leave yo whole team bloody
Can't take the heat take the paint out the kitchen

I'm on my own and I stand alone copy paste cause you a fucking clone
It's like copy paste cause you a fucking clone
Yall losing I'm winning did I hurt yo feelings ?
Yall ain't even willing to stack it to the ceiling
(Yall losing I'm winning did I hurt yo feelings ?

You pillow soft you don't go hard take care of my fam
Get us out this jam I'm tryna get a damn deal to fly us out this jam
But let me talk this shit I know the toilet tired of me
And if you claim I'm a hoe then why you trying to fuck me?
Like ain't you scared that yo dick gone burn?
Like ain't you scared you might catch some germs?
And these bitches some snakes they some real true haters
They be smiling in your face talk about you way later
Ok I'm done with it , I'm getting back to this money
But if you ask me  I think I just went nutty

Think I just went nutty think I just went nutty
But if you ask me I think I just went nutty
Think I just went nutty think I just went nutty
But if you ask me  I think I just went nutty
