[Verse 1]
Pay for the day if you wanna play
In the room it’s a bed and Febreeze spray
Use protection when I sell it like my doctor say
This man all in my ear like some Dr Dre’s
He said “when can I get that wet stuff?”
I said “when can I get that check stub?”
Next week? Aw damn that’s messed up
Well now I’m on my period, whole time it’s ketchup
Call me a hoe on the go tryna get my dough
I don’t handout pussy that’s like handing out gold
Cause a twat could sellout just like my shows
Might auction this pussy the highest bidder it’s sold

[Chorus]
Pussy ain’t free I might have to charge more
Check numbers gotta be looking like barcodes
Pussy ain’t free I might have to charge more
Check numbers gotta be looking like barcodes
Pay the damn price or go home to your wife
I bet her pussy drier than a phone in rice
Pay the damn price or go home to your wife
I bet her pussy drier than a phone in rice
Let’s go

[Verse 2]
Can’t fuck me for nothing man I gotta get something
Tryna gas my head up I told him “keep on pumping”
Not coming unless he come with plenty, plenty commas
Take me to the Bahamas, and let’s eat Benihana's
Until then naw, raise up your drawers
Money gotta be longer than a White House hall
Just to get close to me
That's how it’s supposed to be
I’m tryna fuck for a buck not make love to Jodeci
Got money but I wanna multiply it with yours
Clean a nigga wallet out like I’m doing my chores
Play niggas or get played, bitch I always score
Walk yo ass around my car and come and open my door

[Chorus]
Pussy ain’t free I might have to charge more
Check numbers gotta be looking like barcodes
Pussy ain’t free I might have to charge more
Check numbers gotta be looking like barcodes
Pay the damn price or go home to your wife
I bet her pussy drier than a phone in rice
Pay the damn price or go home to your wife
I bet her pussy drier than a phone in rice
Let’s go

[Bridge]
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-pussy
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-pussy
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-pussy
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-pussy
P-p-pussy
P-p-pussy
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-pussy
Pussy ain’t free
Pussy ain’t free

[Chorus]
Pussy ain’t free I might have to charge more
Check numbers gotta be looking like barcodes
Pussy ain’t free I might have to charge more
Check numbers gotta be looking like barcodes
Pay the damn price or go home to your wife
I bet her pussy drier than a phone in rice
Pay the damn price or go home to your wife
I bet her pussy drier than a phone in rice
Let’s go
