[Verse 1]
Uh, It be those lonely nights when you dim the lights
And then maybe I could have made it right
If he just thought about me for once
Fuck "I" if he said "we" for once
If only he invite me over, lay me on the sofa
Hold me closer when I bleed this month
Make me feel warm inside in the backseat
Or the front seat in the car, bus, or a taxi
I don't give a fuck I ride for you, do what you tell me to
Don't trip at all, when another bitch call
Don't fix my tongue to ask who she is
Cause I know what we got and I know what the fuck we is
I can't flex, I was obsessed with the way we fucked
You cum then we rest, but now I think like, "why did we sink?"
It's up to me like a bodycon dress
I said ring my bell, don't give me hell
Bring me flowers, but you didn't come that hour
He said, "Baby, what the hell? My signal fell
I was just watching an episode of Power."

[Hook]
We finna go our own direction if you don't learn your lesson
You hurt me more than a weapon
You got no more, no more exceptions
You got no more,  no more exceptions
Losing our connection I'm losing my reflection
I'm a keep it stepping, fuck was he expecting?

We finna go our own direction if you don't learn your lesson
You hurt me more than a weapon
You got no more , no more exceptions
You got no more,  no more exceptions
Losing our connection, I'm losing my reflection
I'm a keep it stepping, fuck was he expecting?

[Verse 2]
Now he wanna take the condom off
But not giving me love or nothing above
It's like giving me a dick that's soft, useless, feel foolish
He said long as the dick stay good, then he rule this
That's not true
I know the man that I met before him, a new man
That's a whore, it's not you
That ain't nothing but the devil
Knowing you young,  looking for fun
And not quite ready to settle I spoke when I woke up
You ain't text back whats the hold up?
I'm just sitting here wishing fucking on a man with a mission
This a hard decision accepting a man with bitches
Knowing I'm listed how can I miss this
When niggas don't listen? And something ain't right but pause
And every night he come home from not answering the phone
I'm so tempted to smell his drawers
But overall I love the way he grip me
I get a special feeling when he with me
That's what I breathe for I'm not knocking that nigga
I'm just saying I need more niceness and effort
Cause I'm a good bitch
I can get a man that look like Tyson Beckford
But that's out of style you used to dry my tears
But now I use a towel you gotta step it up or come a extra mile
Before you ever get a chance to milk this cow again

[Hook]
We finna go our own direction if you don't learn your lesson
You hurt me more than a weapon
You got no more, no more exceptions
You got no more,  no more exceptions
Losing our connection I'm losing my reflection
I'm a keep it stepping, fuck was he expecting?

We finna go our own direction if you don't learn your lesson
You hurt me more than a weapon
You got no more , no more exceptions
You got no more,  no more exceptions
Losing our connection, I'm losing my reflection
I'm a keep it stepping, fuck was he expecting?
