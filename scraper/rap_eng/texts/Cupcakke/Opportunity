[Hook]
I was damn near yo wife soon-to-be
Gave you an opportunity, you tried to ruin me
Gave you an opportunity, you tried to ruin me
Gave you an opportunity, you tried to ruin me
Now you the only opp in opportunity
Gave you an opportunity, you tried to ruin me
Gave you an opportunity, you tried to ruin me
Gave you an opportunity, you tried to ruin me
Fucked up yo
O-por-tu-ni-ty, opportunity
O-por-tu-ni-ty, opportunity
O-por-tu-ni-ty, opportunity
Not of u-ni-ty, opportunity

[Verse 1]
I'm so exhausted I can't get off this
Hoping you would come around just a little more often
I'm sick of talking trying to get it through yo little ass brain
You just a pimp with a limp you just missing a cane
"I'm sorry," then you remove it don't win me over no more
She comment on more than 20 pictures so I know she yo hoe
We used to be comfortable and functional
Now I'm looking at cho face like it's pretty fucking punchable
Used to think a man like you never exist, two years later
Wishing that you never exist, yeah, cause I took a risk
Matter fact I'm pissed , so many problems
It's a lipstick it come with a plot twist
Don't wanna be with a man or watching more than civilian
You left my home when I was damage its like an abandon building
Should I leave or stay cause you not being real
Now my bestfriend on the phone with advice like Dr. Phil

[Pre-Hook]
Wherever you at just stay there
(Just stay, just stay, just stay there)
Let me guess, with cho baby mama at the daycare
(With cho baby mama at the daycare)
Hoping you not thinking I'm a wait here
(Hoping you not thinking I'm a wait here)
In other words go to hell when I tell, you to take care

[Verse 2]
This the type of night we should be having pillow fights
But instead you try to turn me into a widow right?
Every woman fucking knows when a nigga suspicious
But we still fuck, suck, and clean and do the dishes
Just to say we strong-minded, fuck a Easter hunt
Most women be going thong finding
Only to do what you can, we post to go hand to hand
Luckily I'm not the type to go from man to man
Hope your dick fall off for tryna wife plenty
You can spot a dirty bitch if she don't own a pair of white panties
Yeah, let it digest, think about it
Niggas don't be wrapped to tight might have to sing about it
Tired of sittin' by my phone, who gone text who first?
Just tell me the damn truth, I don't care if the truth hurt
You give a man the best pussy in the universe
And he still gone go and cheat with Miss Universe

[Pre-Hook]
Wherever you at just stay there
(Wherever you at just stay there)
Let me guess, with cho baby mama at the daycare
(With cho baby mama at the daycare)
Hoping you not thinking I'm a wait here
(I'm hoping you not thinking I'm a wait here)
In other words, go to hell, when I tell, you to take care
