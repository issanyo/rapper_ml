[Verse 1: cupcakKe]
Can't be stopped, I am too damn hot
Tip of my finger got money on it not, no rock
Younger than Young Joc, but I can pull yo pop
Got a problem?
We a pop-up like a pop-up shop
Or cut it with the attitude before I pop my trunk
I own 99 cars, but you don't own one
I would hate me too
Money tall, like 8'2
I make your nigga call you up like, "I need a break, boo."
And I don't act surprised, bitch, stop with the lies
You know yo ass salty like McDonald fries
That I get money in the morning then by night it be gone
Then I get that money back like I'm getting refund (let's go)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Verse 2]
Grind hard, tryna get to the top just like Moses
Perfume smelling like good pussy and roses
Outdo hoes like bitch keep up
And if you got something to say than bitch speak up (say it)
Not saying I'm a listen cause I don't got time
Bitches with dark clouds you know I outshine
Followed after lurking, ok bout time
You not getting followed back tho, you not even fine
You fucking busta, I'm a real hustler
Eating real meals while you out eating supper
I get that money ASAP like Rocky soon as it hit my pocky
I'm cocky, her and her copied and I still don't care
Cause I built you hoes like Build-A-Bear
Jealously from the ugly is typical
But I check bitches quicker than a physical

[Chorus: Rihanna & SZA]
I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Outro: SZA (Rihanna)]
Get no piece
Get no peace
Get, get, getting no peace
Waiting for me to fall off bitch keep waiting, waiting
Can't get no peace
It'll be the 33rd of the month I'm just saying, saying
(Get, g-g-get no peace oh)

[Outro: cupcakKe, with Rihanna and SZA]
33rd, 33rd, 33rd, 33rd (33rd, 33rd, 33rd, 33rd)
The day I fall off it's the motherfucking 33rd
(Do the math dumb bitch, do the math dumb bitch)
33rd, 33rd, 33rd, 33rd (33rd, 33rd, 33rd, 33rd)
The day I fall off it's the motherfucking 33rd
(Do the math dumb bitch, do the math dumb bitch)
