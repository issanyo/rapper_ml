[Verse 1]
Eyes went deep into a trance (-to a trance)
Until he hit me with the "I wanna be friends" (Wait, what?)
I'm talking Michigan, straight up out the blue (out the blue)
I feel sick as fuck, and no, it ain't the flu (nah, nah)
So devastated this elevated into a breakup
Like a elevator, baby, I wanted to take this way up (way up)
I'm in shock, how did our relationship flop?
I want a man who walk in the door and never think to knock
Took me to another level (you did)
And you showing yo true colors, got more than Fruity Pebbles
We was closer than siblings
How I'm supposed to be willing to bury my feelings if I never owned a shovel?
Every time I let my walls down, everything falls down (yeah)
Why wait 'til months pass to say "let's pause now" (Why?)
Tryna keep a dog in a relation is so clown
When dogs don't even wanna be in the dog pound

[Pre-Hook]
Woke up one day like cock-a-doodle doo
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
He woke up one day like cock-a-doodle doo
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
Told me so boldly that I don't want you

[Hook]
What did I do, what did I do? (Tell me)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do? (Lemme know)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do? (Wassup?)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do?
(What did I do, what did I do?)

[Post-Hook]
What did I, what did I, what did I do?
What did I, what did I, what did I do?

[Verse 2]
The fact he sitting back like everything cool
I got dismissed quicker than 2:45 at school (bye)
I ain't even do shit, swear it's so ludicrous
In bed to shed, 'cause I wanna know who he with
When and where, no, I don't wanna share (I don't)
Gave him the key to my heart
I should have kept me a spare for the next guy, don't ask why
No wonder why he had more phones than Best Buy (full of hoes)
Must be hiding shit
Maybe with a island bitch
Was so blind, I could come check my eyes real quick
Could've at least left for two minutes, like you had to go potty
But you left me here forever, now I have nobody
I thought if I sit around, and let it keep me down
Only how a nigga leave his girl is if he found a rebound (facts)
And it always end up in a mess (Why?)
Just wanted it to last longer then a maxi dress (yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Hook]
Woke up one day like cock-a-doodle doo (yeah)
Told me so boldly that I don't want you (I'm out)
Told me so boldly that I don't want you (yup)
Told me so boldly that I don't want you (right)
He woke up one day like cock-a-doodle doo
Told me so boldly that I don't want you (damn)
Told me so boldly that I don't want you (aw)
Told me so boldly that I don't want you (oh my God)

[Hook]
What did I do, what did I do? (Tell me)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do? (Lemme know)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do? (Wassup?)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do?
(What did I do, what did I do?)

[Post-Hook]
What did I, what did I, what did I do?
What did I, what did I, what did I do?
