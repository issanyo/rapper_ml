[Verse 1]
Bitch, you don't know me so shut the fuck up
Can't walk like Naomi 'cause I got it tucked
It's right on my waist, and it's heavy as fuck
Leave a bitch under like Harriet Tub'
I caught a whole body, now the block hot
You caught a half a body like a crop top
If it's in my hair then it's top notch
Niggas wanna cock-block
Niggas straight squares like hopscotch
Yeah, it's too late
I'm pulling up straight to the gate
This what you call on fate
It's only one way to deal with the hate
Make a nigga disappear like the period late
Okay, please don't call me sus'
Cat fight 'cause you pus', bitch, go douche
No, nigga, I don't cook
Never wearin' aprons, only do high fashion looks
So damn sassy
Airport, please don't pat me
'Fore you get popped like acne
Your friends tacky, say they got your back when you at me
But you look back, empty back seats
Only buy Skittles, 'cause your money so damn little
Whip her with the hair, no Willow
Niggas so fickle, don't tell me about kiddo
I don't play Malcolm in the Middle

[Chorus]
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, nigga you really are made too average
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, nigga you really are made too average
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, not cut from the same cloth, you can have it
I am a whole 'nother fabric
Bitch, I am made a savage, chasin' that cabbage

[Verse 2]
Donâ€™t let me see where the Porsche at (Skrrt)
Get your shit snatched like a corset (Give me that)
Need new bundles, where the horse at? (Where it's at?)
I'm always in front like a doormat
Comin' in the game, I ain't never been a lame
Boy you in the same lane, I ain't far past (Far past)
No candy cane, blood, no we can't hang
Lil' bitch gettin' scalped like barrettes (Barrettes)
Police sees I'm a hard ass (Hard ass)
Shoot a nigga right where his heart at (Heart at)
Took a bitch spot, now she don't know where to park at
Want my advice, just car crash (Skrrt)
No time to play, I got a flight to LA
But first, let me slide up to the bank
You know the money big when the bank teller say
"I wish I can, but I can't!" (They dumbass)
No, I can't give you that much
Three to five days is a must
But I walked out the bitch same day with 100K
Of course that nigga had a crush
So I'm in her phone
Look at this pussy, it's goals
Say you get bread, that's mold, hah, hah
Pull up to my shows
Please don't wear no clothes, hah, hah
No Amber Rose, I'm 21 and savage, she cold, hah, hah
Got so many flows, Progressive should hire a ho

[Chorus]
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, nigga you really are made too average
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, nigga you really are made too average
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, not cut from the same cloth, you can have it
I am a whole 'nother fabric
Bitch, I am made a savage, chasin' that cabbage
