[Verse 1]
Moving too fast
So I knew it wouldn't last
That's why I only wore sweats around him like gym class
Nothing to get cute for, so I never changed (nah)
I'm a black woman dealing with pain
That's Being Mary Jane (yeah)
Kissing and listening to the cold wind (uh-huh)
Not bitchin' and bitchin' about his own friends (Ooh, yeah?)
I'ma schedule my lone plans
Outside, we won't hold hands
Hit that U-turn now, 'cause this is where the road ends

[Pre-Hook 1]
Why should I get intimate with a nigga who ignorant?
I'm not tryna get into it, but just answer that (c'mon)
My nigga, why I gotta call you on my friend phone just to get a answer back? (Wassup?)
I'm the one who tweakin', but you gone for the weekend
Told me your ex a bum bitch, but y'all currently speaking (the fuck)
Get it together
Lies longer than a four page letter
Gotta check to see if you hot or cold more than the weather, uh!

[Hook]
Friday feeling like Sunday morning (what the fuck)
Meaning this shit getting boring (yeah)
A big dick can't fix this
'Cause I ain't sign up to be a mistress

[Verse 2]
Cut it out, I'm not what you want (and you know it)
Never gotta tell me more than once (you don't)
Why should I worry 'bout you when guys pop up out the blue?
Like Ashton Kutcher crew waiting on me to say "I do"
We ain't moving steady here (we not, we not)
I mean, I feel more love being with my teddy bear
I know it sound crazy, but lately you been lazy
Tell me it's nothing
She yo cousin, but I know she yo lady

[Pre-Hook 2]
Popping popcorn, 'cause I'm feeling like I'm at the cinema (yup)
Been through this once before, so I know when it's similar
50 percent wanna stay, and 50 wanna leave
Some niggas just belong in the dirt, like sunflower seeds (they do)
Guys will do anything to get you
But don't know what to do when they wit' you
What I don't understand is how you tryna be a asshole (Huh?)
When just last week you was eating my asshole
C'mon

[Hook]
Friday feeling like Sunday morning (what the fuck)
Meaning this shit getting boring (yeah)
A big dick can't fix this
'Cause I ain't sign up to be a mistress
