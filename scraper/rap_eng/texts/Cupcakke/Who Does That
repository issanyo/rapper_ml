[Verse 1]
I don't believe till I see it
Can't geek my head up I'm not easy
Step up your game when you talking with me
Cause I ain't got no heart so theres no key
You lying to all them other girls
Mouth on all them other pearls
If ain't no money ain't nothing to lose
Catch yo face up on the news
You lie so much you need duct tape
If you ain't got money never catch a date
You do too much thats yo problem man
And I'm solo baby not your girlfriend
Clock ticking no time to waste stepped in my face
I might catch a case forever mo you tossed that
Let me know who does that?

[Pre-Hook]
Fake eyelashes,fake nails
All my [?] looking pale
And all my dropouts need to stop cause you just on your way to the block
Fake eyelashes,fake nails
All my [?] looking pale
And all my dropouts need to stop cause you just on your way to the block

[Hook]
Who does that, who does that, who does that, who does that
All you do is lie man
Who does that, who does that
Ain't got no money man who does that who does that
Getting all they heads up
Who does that, who does that
Who does that, who does that, who does that, who does that
All you do is lie man
Who does that, who does that
Ain't got no money man who does that who does that
Getting all they heads up
Who does that, who does that

[Verse 2]
You trick off to all the thots selling fake jewelry and old rocks
Who pays rent? We bought the house
Stop claiming me as your spouse
Never need it, got everything
I'll take your man, plus your ring
That fake weave, synthetic hair
No feelings, I don't care
I rock Louis belts with Nine West
Never catch me at Payless
If your tracks showing, Imma bring you glue
Track you down, CTA crew
And don't let me see them pants sag
Might mistake you as a [?]
Fake True Religions, Imma get upset
So let me know who does that

[Pre-Hook]
Fake eyelashes,fake nails
All my [?] looking pale
And all my dropouts need to stop cause you just on your way to the block
Fake eyelashes,fake nails
All my [?] looking pale
And all my dropouts need to stop cause you just on your way to the block

[Hook]
Who does that, who does that, who does that, who does that
All you do is lie man
Who does that, who does that
Ain't got no money man who does that who does that
Getting all they heads up
Who does that, who does that

Getting all they heads up
