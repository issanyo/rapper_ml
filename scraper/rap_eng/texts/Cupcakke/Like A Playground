[Verse 1:CupcakKe]
Look
I say , I'm going in like the police with a warrant bitch
All my money flip, double call that double dutch bitch
You are such a sick bitch take you to the nursing home
Hoes wannabe me that shit dead and gone
Come see the boss bitch I release yo paychecks
And if that nigga Mag them, then you not having safe sex
He don't play dem games , he like playin' with the pearls
Fuck him till he nut and then pass it to the squirrels
I'm only 16,  growner than a preteen
Stepping on my shoe bitch look I'm a make a scene
Yo mama say go to sleep, you should just go to sleep
Cause if it's up to me look I might shoot you straight see
That's just my first verse so yall know how I'm coming
But if she don't suck right then how the fuck I'm cumming?
I'm serving q-tips cause I need you to hear me
Like I'm overseas ain't no competition near me

[Chorus]
Cupcakke she go dumb,  Cupcakke she go dumb
Cupcakke she go dumb , like a playground so much fun man
Cupcakke she go dumb, Cupcakke she go dumb
Cupcakke she go dumb , like a playground so much fun man


This shit just so fun, this shit just so fun
This shit just so fun, like a playground so much fun man
This shit just so fun, this shit just so fun
This shit just so fun, like a playground so much fun man

[Verse 2]
I'm a lay you down Cupcakke don't fuck around
Look I might break yo neck and feed yo flesh into the pound
Don't wanna hurt yo feelings, homicide I do these killings
Look keep on talking shit I'm coming for you and yo children

You can't fuck with my squad, you cloning like a fraud
Look I'm a aim my bullets bitch please don't try to dodge
C'mon you can have it, I put you in yo casket
Run up I might blast it , but that go to them ratchets
I'm a lay you down Cupcakke don't fuck around
Look I might break yo neck and feed yo flesh into the pound
Don't wanna hurt yo feelings, homicide I do these killings
Keep on talking shit I'm coming for you and yo children
You can't fuck with my squad, you cloning like a fraud
I'm a aim my bullets bitch please don't try to dodge
C'mon you can have it, I put you in yo casket
Run up I'm a blast it , but that go to them ratchets

[Chorus]
