I say murder murder tell a bitch I might hurt her
I'm a act like a waitress
Cause any bitch talking that shit I think I might serve her
I'm from the city of Chi-raq with my right hand
You get smacked
And I ain't talking no ass shaking when I say I'm making that clap
We got other cities intimated like we a motherfucking horror movie
Fruity ass little sweet niggas  I call they ass my fucking smoothie
Fuck with me when I come through knock a hoe off her feet no kung fu
And I don't even need no Tims on cause I'll stomp a bitch in my house shoes
I'll wear you out like my underwear cut you off like my pussy hairs
I'm like a backyard with them pitbulls you better tell that hoe she better be aware
Cause I'm putting on for my city , I'm a give this beat no pity
I will make you fuck and suck my guys and then expose how yo pussy friendly
It ain't on my wrist but they watch how I'm flipping bricks on the block
I been slept on for a lil minute, but it's my time with no clock
On the Internet I get blocked, but we don't block shit we just box
I'm a nigga strapped with the fucking rifle we'll shake yo ass out cho socks
They be like damn she from the hood where that bang bang sound good
Where you hear that Iraq and that Chiraq we dont explain shit it's understood
On Fox News we drilling highest rates of the killings
Cause we dont wait for you to come through we'll just break your neck in yo village
Don't come in my city fucking up shit I'm only 16 and I'm fucking up shit
Now how many licks of my cherry pop you better tell yo nigga  come lick
Chiraq where all the niggas be rapping I'm 16 and I'm trappin'
And I ain't fucking these niggas even if the niggas was strapping
How these bum hoes siddity?
That broke bitch counting pennies
Dont come in my city flexing on Harris
Better take yo ass back to Denny's damn!
