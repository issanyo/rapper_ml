[Verse 1]
Trunk can't close, full of cash (It can't)
All these hoes keep tabs (They do)
Ring around the head, no bath, whoa
More than yo mom charge yo dad, uh
When she got fucked that night, yeah
They had yo' ass ain't right, yeah
How the fuck you have her scared of heights? Whoa
Must be smokin' on pipes, yeah
Lookin' like a milli' in a pair of sandals
Breath so hot, she could lit a candle
Bitches whole life is a whole scandal
Can't judge me, even on panel
Bitch comin' for me, I'm like "Dear, whoa"
Please let me know when you near, whoa
Nowhere in me I got fear, whoa
Shoot like the Navy, no pier, whoa
Abracadabra; bitch watch me show up
Money keep moving like it's  takin' drugs
No Nene Leaks but the door has been shut
Only a dumb hoe would open it up
Cause that man calling me every evening
I don't answer like I'm in a meeting
I don't need to give a bitch a reason
Bitch, don't cross me, I am not Jesus

[Hook]
Hot pocket, hot pocket
Hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pockets
Hot pocket, hot pocket
Hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pockets
In the left: Got the chopper
In the right: That's a whole new stack of fucking profits
Can't let no cops check me
So when I see 'em, "Nice hat", I gotta change the topic
Hot pocket, hot pocket
Hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pockets (Szz..)
Hot pocket, hot pocket
Hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pockets
In the left: Got the chopper
In the right: That's a whole new stack of fucking profits
Can't let no cops check me
So when I see 'em, "Nice tat", I gotta change the topic

[Verse 2]
None of you bitches invited (Nah)
Draggin' these hoes like United (Wah)
Fuck all the talk and just swipe it (Yah)
Eat every beat, fuck a diet (Ahh)
Got a new wig in the mail (Ooh)
I'm a new bitch, you can tell (Ooh)
So I won't speak, I'm for real
If you want a "Hello", call Adele (Ring!)
Cause I'm too busy feeling anew
I am blessed like a fucking "Achoo~"
Me alone, got more hands than your crew
They can't handle me; bowl of hot soup (Yeah)
Every Thanksgiving I bring Mac n' Cheese
It's under the table, near hole that I pee (Pussy!)
Stealing my style from the feet to the weave
These bitches bite more than Adam and Eve
Applyin' pressure every take (Take)
Been The Voice, no Blake
Why argue? Let a bitch hate
Like Philly, it's a lot at stake
I got that wallets so heavy, they deep like a wedgie
Let me clean 'em out right away (My money)
You, on the other hand broke the hot pockets
You know it's the ones that go in microwaves

[Hook]
Hot pocket, hot pocket
Hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pockets
Hot pocket, hot pocket
Hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pockets
In the left: Got the chopper
In the right: That's a whole new stack of fucking profits
Can't let no cops check me
So when I see 'em, "Nice tat", I gotta change the topic
Hot pocket, hot pocket
Hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pockets (Szz..)
Hot pocket, hot pocket
Hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pocket, hot pockets
In the left: Got the chopper
In the right: That's a whole new stack of fucking profits
Can't let no cops check me
