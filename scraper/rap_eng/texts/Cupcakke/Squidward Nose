[Chorus]
His dick smaller than my toes
Yeah, yes, smaller than my toes
His dick smaller than my toes
I'd rather ride Squidward nose

[Verse 1]
My eyelash flew off
When I saw that dick was too soft (What the fuck?)
Need a dick like Rick Ross
Or Dora the Explorer get lost
Get in my zone, I'm ass naked at home
He knowin' just when I'm on
I post it up like Malone
Get so much neck, it's wrong
That I should smell like cologne
Swallow this dick, it's gone
He's searching for it on Chrome

[Chorus]
His dick smaller than my toes
Yeah, yes, smaller than my toes
His dick smaller than my toes
I'd rather ride Squidward nose
His dick smaller than my toes
Yeah, yes, smaller than my toes
His dick smaller than my toes
I'd rather ride Squidward nose

[Verse 2]
This pussy have yo' nigga leavin' you hurt (Uh-huh)
Make him step out on you like phones ringin' at church (He gone)
At The Drake Hotel so you know we on dirt
Call it "Views from The Six" when he lookin' up my skirt (Uh)
Roses are red, violets are blue
All about the head like I'm in beauty school (Uh-huh)
I said roses are red, might turn your balls blue
'Cause if it ain't enough spit then my snot comin' through
Sex occasion, nipples like raisins
I black out on that dick but my cum is caucasian
Told me to face it, went down like the basement
Don't nut in my hole, I do not want your glazin'
Suckin' on that dick made my lipstick slip off (Uh)
So can I wear your cum as clear lipgloss? (Uh)
Make you work that dick like I'm the big boss (Uh)
Call me Serena back and forth with his balls

[Chorus]
His dick smaller than my toes
Yeah, yes, smaller than my toes
His dick smaller than my toes
I'd rather ride Squidward nose
His dick smaller than my toes
Yeah, yes, smaller than my toes
His dick smaller than my toes
I'd rather ride Squidward nose

[Verse 3]
Wanna fuck another girl, nigga are you dumb? (Dummy)
I'm a Gemini so that's really a threesome (Yeah)
Rubbin' on your dick 'til my fingers numb
Big pussy, it don't come with a cherry, I got a plum (Ooh)
Yeah, daddy, daddy, yeah I like it like that (I do)
I'm hittin' more positions than Ray J hat
I'm ridin' on your dick 'til your dick get a flat
I'm 'bout to lay your ass down like a fuckin' door mat (Uh-huh)
Peanut butter jelly all in my belly-belly
Rated R, no Kelly
Ate his meat like a deli
Don't moan, you can spare me
'Cause your breath kinda smelly
Yeah, my pussy always screamin' "it's hot in here" like Nelly
Throw up on that dick then I lick it up
Poor kitty-kitty but I'm rich as fuck
Magician with the titties, told him pick a cup
I got that pothole pussy, yeah the dick was stuck

[Chorus]
His dick smaller than my toes
Yeah, yes, smaller than my toes
His dick smaller than my toes
I'd rather ride Squidward nose
His dick smaller than my toes
Yeah, yes, smaller than my toes
His dick smaller than my toes
I'd rather ride Squidward nose
