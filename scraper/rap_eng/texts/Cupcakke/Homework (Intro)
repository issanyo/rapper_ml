[Verse]
Hurt a bitch by any means
My circle tighter than skinny jeans
Here you go, here go a diamond ring
I'm good, go invest that in bigger things
'Cause that's not me
But bitch, if I like yo nigga pic
Shorty better hurry up with it and block me
Before I send him a nude that hang up in his room
While I let him hit it like hockey
This that real shit
I turned down three deals bitch, and I'm still lit
I get it bussing like field trips
I pop off, no pill, bitch
Rap hoes wanna steal this
I drop greatness, then I let the people tell
Then it make more noise than jingle bells
I come around they like, "Ugh, what's that smell?"
Bitch, money
Oh, you broke, you can't tell, I forgot
For this to be a intro, it's hot
I always got the floor like a mop
I'm tied up in a lot, but no knot
Type to make your whole career flop
Bitches mad that I stand out with no features or a handouts
I bring a lot to the table, no record label
I'm fucking stable at 19, so don't try it
I just give the streets some excitement
I made 50K in 50 days while you on Instagram teeth whitening
I went from PB&J to eating five pepper steaks
I'm on now, so now they phone work
Before you judge, bitch, do yo homework
I'm the man

[Outro]
We 'bout to get into a fucking classic
You might wanna getcho popcorn for this one
It's finna get real
