[Verse 1]
Let me hit the same pose (snap), pussy deep, sinkhole
See my pic, won't scroll (Yuh), watchin' me, episode (They watchin')
Breaking up a happy home (Outdone), if he see me in a thong (You know it)
I post a pic and he moan, you better step on his phone

[Chorus]
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
I bet your nigga get the lotion
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
I bet your nigga get the lotion

[Verse 2]
Screenshot so much his button got stuck
Right by his bitch, he don't give no fuck
He go to the clinic to check his blood
Masturbatin' to my pics, he don't pee in a cup
Drop a comment with emoji of an apple
My pics on every nigga phone like the apps, so
I got the juice, bitch, I got the snapple
Only big ballers, I might let tackle (give me that money!)
Say you get paper, oh wow (wow)
That must be them paper towels (towels)
Wipin' your dick from that drown (drown)
From starin' at pics for a while
Nigga wanna tweet me in my DM's, sneaky
Sendin' dick pics, that's the size of my pinky
I'm too kinky, you can't please me
Can't double tap it 'cause your hand's too greasy

[Chorus]
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
I bet your nigga get the lotion
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
I bet your nigga get the lotion

[Verse 3]
Bitches scrollin' through my likes, to see what they nigga might like (Lurkin')
Long keyboard message he sent (he did!), that's how you know I'm his type (I am)
I'm not tryin' to be your wife (Hell nah), don't even want you for a night (Hell nah)
Not posin' in no dirty mirrors (Nah), so hire a maid to come wipe

[Chorus]
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
I bet your nigga get the lotion
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
I bet your nigga get the lotion

[Verse 4]
Fuck a WCW, take me off your page, I got no love for you
Pic so cold, got your phone froze, now you need a mother, mother, motherfuckin' troubleshoot
Damn, I'm lovin' this view
Let me take a pic, right here, need a few, damn
That one was cute but gotta take it over 'cause the wind just blew
My shit gotta look like perfection, my shit gotta get 'em erections
My shit gotta look like I'm up in the church and I'm handin' out so many blessings
My pics gotta have 'em distracted, my pics gotta snatch off they edges
My pics gotta look like I'm 'bout to go on the cover of the magazine "Essence"

[Chorus]
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
I bet your nigga get the lotion
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
Post pic, oh shit
I bet your nigga get the lotion
