[Verse 1: Sage]
No, I don't wanna be friends, just want you to be my main
I can do these acts yeah yeah, a bitter bitter love affair
I'm all up in my head
Don't leave things unsaid
Kiss me once, kiss me twice yeah
Do whatever you like

[Pre-Chorus: Sage]
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Drop it on me just this time
Wastin' all my money, money, money, money
I've been waiting on this day so long
Better when the chocolate is when the chocolate is gone

[Chorus: Sage]
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste

[Verse 2: Sage]
Got me feelin' so high, handsome and fire in a tie
Goin nowhere yeah, a bitter [?] flare
If you will stay for the night, I promise I'd let you bite
Tell me what you wanna do yeah, I got a sweet tooth for you

[Pre-Chorus: Sage & Cupcakke]
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Drop it on me just this time
Wastin' all my money, money, money, money
I've been waiting on this day so long
Better when the chocolate is when the chocolate is gone
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Sage]
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste

[Verse 3: Cupcakke]
I mean still, no free fills
You can't get in touch if you don't pay my bills
Just lookin' at my body, he could get his thrill
And of course, I be choosin' like deal or no deal
No shy shit I put you in the spotlight
You ain't gotta be scared, I play with balls like Mike
Who else you been fuckin'?
Need to know by tonight
Well, thank Black Panther, Wakanda for life

[Pre-Chorus: Cupcakke]
Ok, money start poppin' and I wanna keep you on my body like the clothes in my closet
Daddy look me in the eyes when you stroking every socket
Why keep talking 'bout the shit when you can pull up like a stocking
My shit real tight, fuck around and get stubbed
Slide in the pussy, no FBG dubs
Counter your [?] that's a counter your luck, so fuck and hold me tight like a woman with a clutch

[Chorus: Sage]
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste

[Outro: Sage]
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste
Touch my body, don't hesitate
Mouth on it, no time to waste
