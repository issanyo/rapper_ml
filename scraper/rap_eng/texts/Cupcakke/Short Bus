[CupcakKe]
I could make you look ridiculous pushing out three bullets they triplets
Gain a couple more digits bread thicker than butter biscuits
Know not to come on my territory if you do you should be paranoid
I got big boys with big toys type of niggas that you might wanna avoid
Giving young niggas that run through cover the whole body like a jumpsuit
Before you end him get the salary got my weight watchers no calories
I be trapping hard on Pinger let me introduce you to the nina
Ratchet on me like Jerry Springer hang the body up like the cleaners
Teach a nigga how to shoot the cannon no rehearsal pop out the can like a Pepsi commercial
Always up to some trouble but I'm only out for the hustle
I'm on my money then I'm finna head home
If I don't want to hear it blasting headphones
Can't fuck around with no daily fruits
Cause they'll cut me short like daisy dukes
Lets get it
