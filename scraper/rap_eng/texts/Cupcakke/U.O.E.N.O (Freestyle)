[Hook]
Look , lil nigga I'm legit you ain't even know it
Yo nigga licked my clit you ain't even know
Rocking Jimmy Choo's with my fit you ain't even know it
Yall features getting me rich you ain't even know it

[Verse 1]
I'm a rape the beat with this freestyle you ain't even know
They copy paste my whole style you ain't even know it
But I'm flowing riding in a big ass foreign
Get the fuck out when you acting real boring
Big room with a bedroom like dorm it
Niggas make it rain when I come through and storm it
You ain't even know it like Ross motherfuckers know I'm a boss
Fuck the price never care what it cost you ain't even know it
Got 2 racks for that show my trigger ready to blow
On a hating bitch you keep talking shit and I'm a knock her down like whoa!
These bitches fucking these niggas they ain't even spending
Like the money game I'm trapping they ain't even winning
Never worried bout no cheddar yo nigga said I get wetter
I give him real good pleasure he said it don't get no better
They said they know I got them bars I already know it
So that prison cell might starve you ain't even know it

Never worried bout no cheddar yo nigga said I get wetter
I give him real good pleasure he said it don't get no better

[Hook x2]
Look , lil nigga I'm legit you ain't even know it
Yo nigga licked my clit you ain't even know
Rocking Jimmy Choo's with my fit you ain't even know it
Yall features getting me rich you ain't even know it
