[Intro]
Hoolayhoo
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Grab a gyro and a cold pop
'Cause on the road, I ain't making no stops (nah)
Bitches stay tryna throw shots until I'm in they face, like botox (Waddup?)
Crazy nigga with me, bet he throw a fit
Let me give you a glimpse of the niggas I'm with
They pets just came from the vet
They ride on my side like Lilo n' Stitch
Busy while you on a futon (woo)
Taking off like a Groupon (yeah)
Started upsetting they feeling vicious
No gun on me, but I trigger bitches (grrra)
Shop at the thrift store, just know how to style it
This 5 dollars, but look 5,000 (yeah)
And I rock his shit, money first
If you want a verse I'm a 2Pac his shit

[Hook]
Mo green than lime (yeah)
24/7, I grind (What?)
We ain't talking 'bout the lime? (Whaaa?)
Disconnecting my line (cut)
Let a opp come on my block
You know we letting rounds out (brrra)
All my niggas stay up on the corner like they in time-out
Hustle, hustle

[Verse 2]
Streets jealous with insecurities
When you see me, I'm with security
Jump out a old school, turn you old news
That's the definition of maturity (woo)
If yo company come for me, try y'all best (try)
I'll take y'all checks like the IRS (Where they at?)
Then hit the mall for a new necklace
While you in the crib broke watching Netflix
Niggas boring me
They not flattering
Same thing everyday, like a phone pattern (bam)
This shit they talking not mattering
Got money everywhere like it's scattering (yeah)
Keep a business mind
Can't nobody do this shit greater (hell naw)
Come for my paper, then I might buy you a Hall later
Bitch (bitch)

[Hook]
Mo green than lime (yeah)
24/7, I grind (What?)
We ain't talking 'bout the lime? (Whaaa?)
Disconnecting my line (cut)
Let a opp come on my block
You know we letting rounds out (brrra)
All my niggas stay up on the corner like they in time-out
Hustle, hustle
Mo green than lime (yeah)
24/7, I grind (What?)
We ain't talking 'bout the lime? (Whaaa?)
Disconnecting my line (cut)
Let a opp come on my block
You know we letting rounds out (brrra)
All my niggas stay up on the corner like they in time-out
Hustle, hustle
