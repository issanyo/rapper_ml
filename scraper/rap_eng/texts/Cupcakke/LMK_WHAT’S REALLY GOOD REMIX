[Intro: Kelela]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Princess Nokia]
Will you let me know if you're riding with?
You could be my friend, spark the medicine
That's on god, I'm a heaven sent
And it tastes so good, wanna eat again
I'll make you beg and surrender
I'll make you cum till November
I'm like a bird Nelly feather
I know this isn't forever

[Verse 2: Kelela]
Look, I'll give up right away
And you'll never figure out
What you said, but it's cool, baby
I'ma get me another round

[Pre-Chorus: Kelela]
Saw your face in my lane
Fall in love everyday
You can chase it for the night
There's a place for you and I

[Chorus: Kelela]
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
Let me know
Said I gotta go, don't wanna hear me say
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know

[Verse 3: Junglepussy]
I keep a nigga waitin' on me, I'm supreme
You could sleep on me but then you'll see me in your dreams
You will never leave me, you my BRB
You'll be back crawlin' right back on your ashy knees (like please)
You want a scoop, you want a sip, you want a slice (a slice)
You feel a way, you tryna link with me tonight (tonight)
You like the vibe, so all my bitches very fine
Verified, collectin' real checks in real life
I am not impressed by nothing that you like
I saw your friends, I know your plans, I know your type
I need shades dark enough to stop seeing through fufu
You could shut up, but show me what that mouth do

[Verse 4: Cupcakke]
Shit, we just havin' fun (We fuckin')
He want a whole meal, them other hoes just crumbs (Uh huh)
Give it a couple of hours then tonight I'm done
The eggs nighty side up, I'll kick em out by sun (Goodbye!)
Tell 'em don't be stupid, I ain't searchin' for Cupid
Only 'cause I'm bored, I might sit and amuse it (I might)
Call up the next dude when one starting confusions (It's easy)
I'm playin' these niggas like Anais with Ruben (Damn!)
Nigga gave me head in the back of the Benz (Skrrt)
Then tried to get close, I told them don't zoom in
You could be Charlie Sheen, and I'mma tell you again (Say what?)
A bitch like me keep 2 and a half men (Woo!)
Super fucking petty, I'm dodging bouquets at weddings
Not tryna fuck with you heavy, my eyes rollin', no Kelly
'Cause you wastin' my motherfucking time (What?!)
Nigga let me know or off my motherfucking line

[Chorus: Kelela]
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
Let me know
Said I gotta go and I don't wanna hear me say
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know

[Verse 3: Ms. Boogie]
Stop slidin' up in my DMs
It's not that deep, we could still be friends
Don't push up without my consent (Off me nigga!)
My network's made of strong black women (Excuse me)
So called men wanna play with me
But I make the rules so they obey me
I got the keys that's do, re, and mi
Let me know, do you wanna have tea with the queen? (Queenie)
But if you wanna fuck that's fine with me (Uh, uh)
You gotta speak up, what's good papi?
Say it loud and clear with the honesty
Give it to me raw, give it to me sweet (Sweet)
Kelela gotta go, she got a show
I'm waitin outside at your motherfuckin' doorway
Wavin' the .44, you better drop to the floor (Pow! Pow!)
Ms. Boogie bitch got 'em sayin' nigga give me more (Ow!)

[Chorus: Kelela]
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
Let me know
Said I gotta go, don't wanna hear me say
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
No one's tryna settle down
'Bout to turn around
All you gotta do is let me know
And you're gonna leave sex that you never left before
You're tryna roll all night, you're tryna roll all night
All you gotta do is let me know
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know
Let me know
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know
