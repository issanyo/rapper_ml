[Verse 1]
People try to put me down like a coffin (it don't work though)
Because I don't go to church often
I try to follow everything you do (man, man)
So do that mean that I'm stalking?
So gracious, so patient with me (you are)
No playin' out, prayin' for me
I admit it, I committed some shiesty sins
But I'm attached to my God like Siamese twins

[Pre-Hook]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu-hallelu
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Hook]
I, I, I, halle-Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
I am a believer
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
I am a believer

[Verse 2]
You hear me when nobody else do (all day)
Can talk to you 'til my face turn blue (all day)
Doing my best just tryna progress
You kept me safe while in the projects
I read that Bible, now Jesus Christ my idol, yeah
I read that Bible, now Jesus Christ my idol, yeah
I read that Bible, now Jesus Christ my idol, yeah
I read that Bible, now Jesus Christ my idol, yeah
Thankful, it ain't gotta be Thanksgiving
I'm blessed right now cause things could be different
It's the little things that count, like praying over my food
Or thank you for my blessings and keeping my day smooth
You 100 times stronger than the Incredible Hulk
When you died for our sins, wouldn't be up on that cross
So much serenity around the trinity (trinity)
And all I could ever do is love you 'til infinity (yeah)

[Pre-Hook]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu-hallelu
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Hook]
I, I, I, halle-Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
I am a believer
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
I am a believer
