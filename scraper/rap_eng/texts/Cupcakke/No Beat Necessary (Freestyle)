So you niggas yall know yall can't rap right?
So I'm a, I'm a break it down for yall
Punchline to punchline and teach yall niggas how to really rap

So niggas tryna make peace so let me send yo ass to heaven
And it's ya lucky night cause my bullets running out seven
Fuck you up with 3 up in your front 4 up in ya back
I'm like a Russian coming to America ready to attack
I ain't playing with no bitch no nigga no tranny no granny
No Jennifer Hudson but bitch I spray the whole fucking family
I'm presidental talk to me with manners, "yes mammy"
Hit a stain, smack grandma with the cane
Until she tell me where's Uncle Sammy

I don't study no bitch, bitch I barely read books
I shoot your fucking hand off
Leave you looking like Captain Hook
I stay working like I'm starving cause I'm my own damn cook
And if you witness me to a murder
Ray Charles should of warned you not to look
Cause I don't like no witness or bitches who run they mouth
Cause if you talk that slang shit
Than yo ass getting beat like you from down south

Bitches chasing niggas with the cheese
Like they related to a fucking mouse
And I ain't talking House of Payne but we be deep up in this trap house
I give it to you like  a candy store do you want it Now or Later
I ain't shaving or cutting shit but I keep the razor and taser
When I say fax me that info that mean send me my paper
I'm a ask you what you want and how you want it
Like I'm yo motherfucking waitor

Niggas gone need eyes in the back of they head to know when I'm coming
Knock yo head back with one hit dislocate it and I dont do no tumbling
I spit that crack to kill careers and I ain't talking Whitney
Bitches be so old news like I'm watching the channel Disney
Where yo goons at man? I never heard of them
My niggas killing niggas dead on site like we in Ferguson
I swear to God I be hurting em
I pull up in yo hood blowing the snipe or rifle disturbing em
Bitches pussies having bad hair days put a hat on that shit
Like a abusive ass nigga bet yo nigga still hit
And I'm a break everything on him
Ain't talking skeletons but I'm a try to bone him

I'm taking niggas spots without asking niggas
Man my tampons getting more pussy than half these niggas
Young nigga don't be hiding in the car
Go take yo ass under a rock like that nigga Patrick the Star
And I could give a fuck about how a bitch feeling
Cause I'm shit and you hate it damn I'm something like chitlins
I keep my shells blowing slower than turtles
They think my bars be rehearsal cause when I spit it be hurtful
Got bigger eyes than Urkel I do construction
Bitch I be fucking drilling I'm in a foreign doing bout a 100 miles
Wack a bitch and never go to trail and if I do show up
Man I don't blow up put the left hand up
And feed the judge with about 100 smiles

Like a fucking street sign I'm posted up on every block
I been trapping and rapping since 15
And I ain't taking no fucking stops
I don't want him ain't cuffing no nigga
Leave the shit up to the cops wait, lets not speak of cops
Cause cops getting dropped like they the opps
People say they tired of hearing rappers
Rapping about killing niggas well close your ears and act deaf
Cause I'm definitely finna kill a nigga
Cause I ain't going I ain't going I ain't going nigga
Alter ego alter ego what I'm showing niggas
