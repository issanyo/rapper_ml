[Intro]
(Swag)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you my dude
You can send me nudes
But I got news
Ain't tryna be rude
I gotta keep me a number two with me like I’m in school
We ain't gotta be they Instagram goals, let's keep this cool
Fuck that shit, you can give me that dick
But please don’t post no pics on so' (Don't do it)
I got niggas in my DM's, bet they got BM's
But I would have to assume
I got that nasty when they walk past me
Other people like, "Please get a room"
I wanna fuck you and him
But if you post me, bitch, I'm through

[Chorus]
New hoes, new hoes, new hoes, yeah, they want me
So please, so please, so please, don't you post me
Don't post me, don’t post me, don’t post me, don't post me
Don’t you post me
Don't post me, don't post me, don't post me, don’t post me
Don't you post me
Don't post me, don't post me, don't post me, don't post me
Don't you post me
Don't post me, don't post me, don't post me, don't post me
Don't you post me
(Hey), bitch, don't post me

[Verse 2]
In all my pics
Just me and my bitch
Niggas do the same shit
So every day I'm lit
All 2018, I'm playin' all y'all niggas so quick
Only time I'm gettin' posted is RIP, that's it
Special occasion, post it, erase it
Hopin' my main don't give it a click
I'm not tryna be on no camera
No Canon, I don't give a fuck if you Nick
Every day shit gotta be dif'
Switch a nigga like it's a new shift
Money long, you can take it with
Post Malone can't even post my shit

[Chorus]
New hoes, new hoes, new hoes, yeah, they want me
So please, so please, so please, don't you post me
Don't post me, don't post me, don't post me, don't post me
Don't you post me
Don't post me, don't post me, don't post me, don't post me
Don't you post me
Don't post me, don't post me, don't post me, don't post me
Don't you post me
Don't post me, don't post me, don't post me, don't post me
Don't you post me
(Hey), bitch, don't post me
