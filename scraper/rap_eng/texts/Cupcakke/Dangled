[Intro]
Love, love, love, love, love
Ain't no lovin' me, love, ain't no lovin' me, love
Ain't no lovin' me, love, ain't no lovin' me, love
Ain't no lovin' me, love, ain't no lovin' me, love
Ain't no lovin' me, love, ain't no lovin' me

[Verse 1]
We can just be friends if you want
'Cause I'm really tired of puttin' up a front
You always gone, you ain't never at home
Got me lookin' for you like an egg hunt, wait (Where you at?)
Maybe we just need space (Space)
If the time ain't shared, it's a waste, look (Waste)
When you want a taste, you would give me some face
But after that I really hate seein' your face
Your phone on lock on the daily (On the daily)
Then you wanna play like I'm crazy (Like I'm crazy)
But you got some raggedy ass bitch on your page
Tryna make me jealous, but that shit don't phase me (It don't)
So play your part, you actin' lazy
I'm not offended by no lady
Any bitch thinkin' that she took my man
I'ma take his ass back like the eighties (Give me that)
You can't erase me, nor replace me
And if y'all kiss then bitch you taste me
Don't need no nigga, so why make him chase me?
I do the dash on that nigga like Stacey (Skrrt)
You either want me or not (Not)
Other niggas want what you got (Got)
Hurry up, you finna get blocked (Blocked)
Thinkin' I'ma let it fly, you get swat
What if I did what you did?
Stepped out made a kid with another man, you'll be hot
What if I sent him pics to raise up his dick
Make them sexy like Miracle Watts (Watts)
You wouldn't be flattered, you really what matter
Keep makin' me sadder, keep shakin' the ladder
You want her, go have her, my thoughts have been gathered
Can't hold this in no more like weak bladder, ayy

[Chorus]
Dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled my heart up and down
Just like my bangles, yeah, just like my bangles, that nigga had been around
Dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled my heart up and down
You ain't playin' fair, so just like a fair, nigga, you 'bout to get clowned
Dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled my heart up and down
Just like my bangles, yeah, just like my bangles, that nigga had been around
Dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled my heart up and down
You ain't playin' fair, so just like a fair, nigga, you 'bout to get clowned

[Verse 2]
1:30 AM, where you at now? (What's up?)
You ain't never been shit but a letdown (Ain't shit)
Wait, who the fuck is that in the background?
Let me pull up, get dragged like a prom gown
Why you gotta poke the bear to come out?
Only 'posed to make me cum in your mouth
Thought I had a rider, I'ma reroute
Stress 'bout to make me snatch my weave out
But I'm bitchin'
Friends been told me to leave, sayin' he ain't what I need
And it's true but I ain't listen (I'm stupid)
Locksmith changed these keys to my heart for the last time
Need somethin' different (I'm done)
For once, I been with this nigga for months
And I'm already like fuck him
Like he's some kin to that man Donald Trump
Let's get to the facts, you don't text back
Been messaging bitches but swear that you hacked
Then I'll take you back, then back to the flack
Said I'm no help so I'll help you pack
Now you ain't gotta worry about me naggin'
I pull more niggas than a wagon
Better act like you know what's happenin'
Nigga you fired, like a dragon, ayy

[Chorus]
Dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled my heart up and down
Just like my bangles, yeah, just like my bangles, that nigga had been around
Dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled my heart up and down
You ain't playin' fair, so just like a fair, nigga, you 'bout to get clowned
Dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled my heart up and down
Just like my bangles, yeah, just like my bangles, that nigga had been around
Dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled and dangled my heart up and down
You ain't playin' fair, so just like a fair, nigga, you 'bout to get clowned
