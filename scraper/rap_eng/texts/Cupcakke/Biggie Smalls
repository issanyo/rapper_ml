[Verse 1]
Instagram hoes shouldn't be y'all goals
Look past the post, she photoshopped her rolls
Filter so bright she don't think black glows
That 30-inch weave is to cover her back rolls
It's shocking to you but not to me
People turning insecurities to mockeries
Shit I could be thin or overweight, won't bother me
I'm still choose Burger King over broccoli
I love every inch of my body don't compare me to shawty
Size 7 or 11, I'm a still be a hottie
I dial 0 to the lobby, chop up my steak like karate
Send it up with 10 cups cause I drink pop like a hobby
I'm thinking rooftop party, hell yeah it's 'bout to go up
Till shorty put her finger down her mouth she tryna throw up
So she won't gain weight from listening to the hate
Can't give her food for thought
She'll think her brain gaining weight
Eating disorders, scarier than horrors
She in a buffet and only order a water
Yeah it's that cray, it make you fight yo craves
Stretch marks in a bikini, I'm that damn brave
I used to think model type meant skinny as fuck
Until Ashley Graham came through and started fucking shit up
On cover  after cover with no tummy tuck
Straight served with her curves and got her money up

Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (Call It)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (Call It)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (Call It)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (Call It)
Medium, big or small, I love you all (Love you)
Big or small, I love you all, (love you)
Big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, it's who you are

[Verse 2]
Small, medium, large, extra large, and 4X
Size is just size one ain't better than the next
Reaching for my food is the only time I stretch
Can't you see I love me and I'm feeling my best
Confidence on 10 I can't break like commercials
Try again and again like you in rehearsal
Stripes on my body looking like Tony the Tiger
Shit so fire, everybody inspired
Body of all shapes no difference they all great
I'm eating out the pot if you make me a small plate
You could call me fat or anything under the sun (I don't care)
Afterwards I'm a still go buy a honey bun (Yup)
Idolize the wrong ones, man its clear as day
Go to doctors to get implants but they rent ain't paid
Straight up, fuck dude if he don't like small boobs
Manipulating yo mind like he been to law school
Give him the boot like thigh highs tell that nigga "bye bye"
Nigga point my flaws out , we bout to play Eye-Spy
I spy a nigga with a big ass head
And we ain't talking about that one between his legs
If you ain't got no ass just hit a couple squats
Ain't no need for a doc to inject butt shots
Don't turn to the media looking for what's hot
They'll steer yo ass wrong like drivers drinking Ciroc
Epic fail on the scale, but she still looking swell
Gotta get well be like a snail come up outta that shell
Think she big like a whale the other think she too frail
Both gotta understand that they gorgeous as hell
