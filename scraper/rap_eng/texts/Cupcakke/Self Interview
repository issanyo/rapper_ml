[Verse 1]
Nothin' tacky 'bout my Acnique, the inside the most attractin'
Hair ain't really that nappy, if I stop comparin' it to Yaki
Been walked over so much, now when I meet someone, I act rude
They always ask if my tats hurt, but the hurt why I got tattoos
Always tell myself it's a big difference in being alive than livin'
It's funny how a girl with a fat ass can get more comments than a hurricane hittin'
No gas station around and you still push the car that shows you driven
And most people already skipped this song 'cause it ain't about sex and killin'

[Chorus]
Self interview, why the fuck do I do the things that I do?
Self interview, why I fuck him the moment I see that he's cute?
Self interview, how the hell is my life more shitty than a zoo?
Self interview, ain't none of these askes are from Yahoo!

[Post-Chorus]
I look in the mirror
And I gotta ask myself
Am I staying true to me?
I just wanna know

[Verse 2]
Females have sex on the first night, they get called a hoe for that one night stand
Men have sex on the first night, "Congratulations, you got around her bands"
Most wouldn't comprehend, double standards need to end
It's a list of shit I could name but it ain't enough ink in this pen
Spent three hours on makeup with my face covered like peek-a-boo
Whole time, he with another girl with good cheekbones like Pikachu
Back then we had lipgloss and some overalls, that's the usual
Nowadays, I gotta show skin and wear sew-ins to feel beautiful

[Chorus]
Self interview, why the fuck do I do the things that I do?
Self interview, why I fuck him the moment I see that he's cute?
Self interview, how the hell is my life more shitty than a zoo?
Self interview, ain't none of these askes are from Yahoo!

[Post-Chorus]
I see people on the 'Gram, postin' 4k
Be the last person to donate
I'm hoping I never be that, you know?
Never change for the fame, stay me

[Chorus]
Self interview, why the fuck do I do the things that I do?
Self interview, why I fuck him the moment I see that he's cute?
Self interview, how the hell is my life more shitty than a zoo?
Self interview, ain't none of these askes are from Yahoo!

[Outro]
I look in the mirror
And I gotta ask myself
Am I staying true to me?
I just wanna know
