What do you do when your lost and not found when you run and don't get found
What do you do when the money is all spent
What do you do when you give the world all that you had left

I've been thinking 'bout you night and day
I'm only here when my heart breaks
48 shots with the led all out, guess what love has got me thinkin' about

"Falling Fast" pretty wild and free forget all they asking me so turn up the music people gather round lets get high and neva come down

You got me falling for your love, it's inviting
I let you come into my heart like you invited
Some new shit I ain't neva fraid to try it
Anything flies in this pussy you da pilot

I've been thinking 'bout you night and day
I'm only here when my heart breaks
48 shots with the led all out
Guess what love has got me thinkin' about

"Falling Fast"
Pretty wild and free forget
All they asking me so turn up the music
People gather round lets get high and neva come down

No man is on that hill while we watch the sunset
Know how to keep the spark mad in the fun fresh you the one and Only focus you demand that spot
Cause you don't get distracted by them Instagram thoughts you don't complain
You my babe
Patient with me every hour of the day
The type that see me every hour even when I'm runnin' late
Still be there fo me like no otha otha nigga that type of love that cut deeper than the fuckin' fidget spinna

"Falling Fast"
Pretty wild and free forget
All they asking me so turn up the music
People gather round lets get high and neva come down
