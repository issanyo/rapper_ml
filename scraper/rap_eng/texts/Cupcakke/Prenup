[Verse 1]
Unbothered, yeah that's a fact (Can't touch this)
CupcakKe 'cause I am a snack (I'm that bitch)
Thought NyQuil was up in a strap
'Cause one bullet gave that bitch a nap (Baow)
My circle smaller than that circle
That pop up when you tryna download an app
Back up, give me my space
Or I'ma leave your teeth spaced with a gap
Livin' your best life, yeah, whatever
Bet my dead skin livin' better
She only talkin' shit 'cause I let her
She ain't get beat yet, a capella, ayy
That's a broke bitch, I can feel it (Feel it)
Her nails probably still acrylic ('Crylic)
And her wig lookin' like a pack of ramen noodles
That I burnt up on the skillet

[Chorus]
Prenup, prenup, prenup, prenup
Niggas ain't gettin' no money
Prenup, prenup, prenup, prenup
Niggas can't get shit from me
Prenup, prenup, prenup, prenup
She call on my kid like Kid Cudi
Prenup, prenup, prenup, prenup
You broker than my heart, don't touch me

[Post-Chorus]
Married to the money, married to money, married
Married to the money, married to money, married
Fly lil' bitch, call me the tooth fairy
Act like you know, better be Jim Carrey
Married to the money, married to money, married
Married to the money, married to money, married
Fly lil' bitch, call me the tooth fairy
Act like you know, better be Jim Carrey

[Verse 2]
Let's get this shit crystal clear
Your look just ain't it, my dear, uh
How you be lacin' good gear? (How?)
But your wig be sheddin' like tears
The type of bitch I don't go near (Near)
I'm shuttin' it down like Sears (Sears)
They sick of me but it's no care
This chopper show out like premieres, ayy
Bitches is basic, they live in the basement
It ain't my birthday so I'm not tryna cake it
I'm rockin' the latest, I carry big faces
And if it ain't green then I might just act racist
The checks don't ever get bounced
Move in silence, man nothing's announced
They ask, "Is it Cupcake or CupcakKe?"
I said, "However the money pronounced," ayy

[Chorus]
Prenup, prenup, prenup, prenup
Niggas ain't gettin' no money
Prenup, prenup, prenup, prenup
Niggas can't get shit from me
Prenup, prenup, prenup, prenup
She call on my kid like Kid Cudi
Prenup, prenup, prenup, prenup
You broker than my heart, don't touch me

[Post-Chorus]
Married to the money, married to money, married
Married to the money, married to money, married
Fly lil' bitch, call me the tooth fairy
Act like you know, better be Jim Carrey
Married to the money, married to money, married
Married to the money, married to money, married
Fly lil' bitch, call me the tooth fairy
Act like you know, better be Jim Carrey

[Outro]
Married to the money, married to money
Married to the money, married to money
Married to the money, married to money, yeah
Married to the money, married to money
Married to the money, married to money
Married to the money, married to money, yeah
