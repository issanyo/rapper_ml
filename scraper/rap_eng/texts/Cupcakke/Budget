[Verse 1]
Keep calm, even when my palms itch (I do)
Old friends 'til the end, I ain't switch (no, no)
New money, but the same old me
Fuck a candy cane, we hanging money on a tree
I'm 'bout to buy it, it ain't going on a wishlist (hell nah)
Tryna make it where like everyday it's Christmas (yup, yup)
I just throw it to the plug tell him, "Ship this."
Then I'm back up on the run, like fitness (let's go)
No red carpet, but you bitches got me on the floor rolling
Yeah, you got a foreign, but I bet that shit stolen
Pockets sticking out, with no doubt, they look swollen
Cleaning shit out, like I'm getting me a colon
I'm earning my respect once I take a nigga check
Cross the line, then you dead, and I'm not talking flat
All these broke bitches never in the mood
I feed the streets with the heat, no spoon (let's get it)
Isolate myself from the evil (I do)
Mind stay sharper than a needle (you know it)
Try to finess, I'll lay you to rest
Bring me a coffee when you see me
Put that shit on my desk (hurry up)

[Hook]
Can't get nothin' nothin, nothin', nothin', nothin'
Comin' to me saying that you on a fucking budget
You can't get nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Coming to me saying that you on a fucking budget
Can't get nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Coming to me saying that you on a fuckin' budget
You can't get nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Coming to me saying that you on  a fucking budget

[Post-Hook]
Absolutely nothin', absolutely nothin'
Absolutely nothin', absolutely nothin'

[Verse 2]
Bitches so dirty, I cannot believe it (bum bitch)
Food on the floor, then the roaches gone eat it
So bummy, the edge control ain't doing its role
'Cause bitch, them edges look crummy (they do)
One minute they don't like me, next minute wanna toast with me (Huh?)
I get a bag then double it, like getting stacked with groceries
This didn't happen overnight, man, I just didn't quit
I milk the game with flavor, Nesquik
My luck just started, now it can't be stopped
In a Bentley now, but I came from the bus stop
I had to grind, while people out taking a lot
Used to save a lot just to shop at Save-a-Lot
With no team, I chase my dreams
Funny how the world think it's funny making me into memes
But they don't know, that's free promo
I'm not a fighter with a type, but shorty don't want no smoke
Ain't shit free, not even water (hell nah)
Type of bitch, I belong on Billboarders
I'm about money
Never catch me tell a nigga he handsome
Actually, I'm the type to hold that nigga for ransom (bih)

[Hook]
Can't get nothin, nothin, nothin', nothin', nothin'
Comin' to me sayin' that you on a fucking budget
You can't get nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Comin' to me sayin' that you on a fuckin' budget
Can't get nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Comin' to me sayin' that you on a fuckin' budget
You can't get nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Comin' to me sayin' that you want a fuckin' budget

[Post-Hook]
Absolutely nothin', absolutely nothin'
Absolutely nothin', absolutely nothin'
