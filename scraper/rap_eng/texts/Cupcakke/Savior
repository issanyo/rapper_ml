[CupcakKe]
Stop playing you know God the weapon
Even thank him when it don't concern a blessing
More power to you you know just what to do
Ask for one favor and he might send two
You the man, you the man, you the man and you know it
Still know I'm your child even when I don't show it
That's the reason why you the one I worship
Even though it's hard learning you like writing in cursive
My prayers and I recite em I'm opening up the bible
One hundred and ten percent you are my number one idol
My life be rolling down like knee high socks
But you my savior, my rock when everything flops
I serve you with no tray your voice is the way
Could of left me to lay but woke me up today
You teaching me everything so I won't dare try to school ya
Tears shed, bow my head , I praise you hallelujah
People find me amusing touching people with music
Share my story world wide so why people abuse it?
Pouring out my soul writing lyrics on paper
Change a couple fans so that makes me a savior
