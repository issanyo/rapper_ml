[Intro]
Somebody gave me a fuckin' doll for Christmas G
And they named this shit Kash Doll
I dont play with dolls, I wanna rip this bitch head off right now lets go

[Verse 1]
Ayo Big Bird how you feeling?
What happen to the climbing poles to the ceiling?
Now you wanna sneak diss while admiring?
You should take a look at yo environment
Cause all my niggas convicts , wake up wanting conflict
So you know they clappin' any fucking ratchet that I tell em
Bitch this a bomb flick
Looking at that lipo I think something need to be fixed
And you can mention me one more time
When you made more than one hit
Cause this the Windy City ain't shit pretty, you gone have to toughen up
Drop a line of hoes going straight down yo chest like a buttonup
Chiraq my city you cannot handle bro
Jump out on business like I'm a manual
Walk through any block I'm a lost animal
Split her down the middle like a camel toe
After I pull up she gone need a doctor
I'm at her door like go home Roger
Just to show out like niggas in new J's
Trick girl and scout I'm tighter than new braids
See Kash Doll, I mean Trash Doll
Bitch you don't even know me
No face, no case, so I can't even use emoji's
(Its too late fuck a debate)
Crack her head with her own mixtape
Dare you to get out of pocket , bitch eyes a be out of socket
How the fuck do you got options? When you be on the pole for the profit?
Reminding,  I'm glad yo outfits be shiny
Bitch I got that poison Ivy
If Trash Doll on the mic I'll take her light like Steph with Riley
(She prolly ain't even catch that, you know bitches dont use they brain no more, they give it though)
Do a 360, with a clean hit, let a bullet hit her and sting shit
Warm up yo ass on some Spring shit
When the law come I do not speak English
You don't know what you started, but ch-ch you a target
I'll pledge allegiance but I'm heartless
Plant another body in my garden
Miss slurp that dick till it cum will make yo name smaller than a crumb
I'll chew you up and then spit you out
Like you shit but a piece of gum
Started from the bottom stripping yo way up
Thought she was Ronald McDonald with all of that makeup
Got to come deeper,  bye Felicia, I mean Keisha
You a stripper hoe get it on the floor
Probably never owned a fucking Visa
Uh!

[Outro]
You fake booty bitch, fake titty bitch
Who can't fucking rap, I could teach you some shit
All you had to do was ask bruh , all you had to do was ask
I got the answers bitch!
C'mon man looking like Dave Chapelle
C'mon man
C'mon man
Get the fuck outta here man
I'm done with this bitch!
