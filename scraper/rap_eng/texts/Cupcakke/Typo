[Verse 1]
Wanna give mama the D, gotta earn it like Earnest
Yeah daddy, the pussy feel like a furnace
Look at you baby, you lookin' determined
You want some chocolate cake and you German
Eat it up, beat it up (Ayy)
Legs tied like some chucks (Ayy)
Candles lit while we fuck (Ayy)
Enema, he in my butt (Ayy)
When it comes to the dick, I can be picky
'Cause the pussy act fancy, you can ask Iggy
I be rockin' that dick, I ain't talkin' Milly
Stir that dick in my pussy like you makin' chili
I told him lick the clit like Ring Pop (Pop)
Fuck 'til 18 o'clock (Clock)
Every time his sink stop (Stop)
Told him wash his hands in my twat
He's a good snacker, packer, after, napper
Twat make him feel good like soup and crackers
Smacker, whacker, inside out, backwards
Wanna feel your hands in this pussy, come dap her

[Chorus]
Finger me like a typo
Finger me, finger me like a typo, ayy
Finger me like a typo
Finger me, finger me like a typo, ayy
Like a typo, like a typo
Like a typo, like a typo
Like a typo, like a typo
I'm 'bout to make this ass switch like GEICO, ayy

[Verse 2]
Dick gettin' soaked like the mop smell
Drinkin' that cock, that's a cocktail
Even dirty on the bottom like the sock stale
Fingers in the box like you got mail (Put it in me)
If I show you titties, boy you gotta buy me two chains
Yeah, eat the pussy like it's a mukbang (Yeah)
Dig in the pussy, lookin' for that loose change
Came on his fingers, made him buy new rings (Uh oh)
Pussy ain't ran through, no marathon (Nope)
Can't too many people get in this Tana-con (Nope)
That's why niggas mad and they never come (You know it)
'Cause this pussy be the number one restaurant
And of course that nigga want a plate
Gave him eight rounds, now I'm lookin' like Kate Plus 8
Pussy runnin' juice like steak
And you know it's super good, so I fuck him with a cape
Kick your feet up, give you three sluts
Feed me Reese Puffs, give me Visa, keep my T tucked
Now your hair fucked, like Onika with the D up
All on my walls like Mona Lisa
Breasts swingin' in your face, but no fights
All I get is nut, nut, nuts, like on flights
Niggas start buggin' after, like old rice
'Til I say, "K, pop it again, let's go twice"

[Chorus]
Finger me like a typo
Finger me, finger me like a typo, ayy
Finger me like a typo
Finger me, finger me like a typo, ayy
Like a typo, like a typo
Like a typo, like a typo
Like a typo, like a typo
I'm 'bout to make this ass switch like GEICO, ayy
