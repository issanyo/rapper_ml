[Intro]
This for all they ladies who love they guy
And you ain't gotta spy on that nigga
Cause you know where he at, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's this guy the limit ain't the sky
He gets more high when I'm with him every time
He shows me off, he makes me soft, he bless my sneezes and all my flaws
That's my dream boy (he is)
If you play me like a toy or take away my joy
(know what he'll do?)
He'll fuck you up like Floyd
The feeling when you found your soulmate
The feeling when you out with the homies
The feeling when you don't feel lonely
The feeling when you just wanna obey anything he say or do
Cause you know he in love with you (he is)
When you know his size to get him a gift or a prize
Know the brands he love and know his favorite shoe
I know he real and not acting (nope)
He takes away my pain like a Aspirin (yup)
Riding through traffic while I be in action can't live without him Like half of a fraction meanwhile if shit get wild
He the number one person on speed dial
I'm amazed how he keep the glaze on me
Never switch up his ways on me

[Chorus]
He got jokes like his name Martin
He a feed me when I'm starving
He not out cheating with Charlin
Why? Cause that's my darling
He got jokes like his name Martin
He a feed me when I'm starving
He not out cheating with Charlin
Why? Cause that's my darling
That's my D-A-R-L-I-N-G
He makes me feel so damn free
D-A-R-L-I-N-G
He makes me feel so damn free

[Verse 2]
This nigga so worth this stronger than perfect
He never fails me the shit he tells me it comes from the heart
I can tell cause I never really heard it
Found a man that's not sneaky hella freaky
And he could get sweeter than kiwi
Ten times more times than a TV
See eye to eye like we watching 3D
What's good? Nigga come straight from the hood
Pants sag to grab the dust but he could anytime you ask
His hat cocked, on the block , but never puts me last
I'm impressed damn near blessed
He knows how to bring out the best, never play me like chess Call even when he busy working at the desk
How we manage, repairing my damage
I can bring him around my girlfriends
And he'll never try to take advantage (I love him)
Cause I'm the only lover I'm his phone cover
Show his true colors made it through the summer
Holds me like no other queens me like his mother
Say were not another were meant for each other

[Chorus]
He got jokes like his name Martin
He a feed me when I'm starving
He not out cheating with Charlin
Why? Cause that's my darling
He got jokes like his name Martin
He a feed me when I'm starving
He not out cheating with Charlin
Why? Cause that's my darling
That's my D-A-R-L-I-N-G
He makes me feel so damn free
D-A-R-L-I-N-G
He makes me feel so damn free
(It's amazing)
