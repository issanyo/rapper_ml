[Verse 1]
When we dance its like nothing else exists
When I glance up and see the little stubble on your chin...
Its like the sunlight caressing the pores on my skin
The way that you sway me my body my hips it drives me
It drives me insane

[Pre-Chorus]
It's inate
Yes, this movement
It's built in our blood
The groove in your pins sit in your tiny butt...Oh I mean

[Chorus]
Loverboy
I think I'm falling for you
Loverboy
Will you catch me if I do?

[Verse 2: CupcakKe]
You're simple
I'm extra
And that's what I don't get
I love you this much, but we're the total opposite
Can't even be mad at you
You're sweeter than malibu
You're nothing like my ex,baby
That man was an animal
More than a dollar bill, we like Jada and Will
And When I'm feeling blue, you're turning blue into teal
Promise me it's gon' last, you'll never tell me fairwell
We're taking baby steps so hold me like a stairwell

[Chorus]
Loverboy
Estoy enamorado de ti
Loverboy
Pero estas enamorado de mi?
