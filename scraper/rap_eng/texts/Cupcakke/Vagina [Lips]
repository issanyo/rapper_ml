[Verse 1: cupcakKe, Halsey]
You were cumming in your tube socks in our hotel room
Flashing those dicks like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my vagina
I just wanna feel your lips against my vagina

[Verse 2: cupcakKe]
Can't no bitch replace this young twat
Cause' I can go 24/7 its non stop
Know how to keep your man off the block
Roll my pussy on the dick, while I'm drinking pop
Fuck Yeah I said it and this nigga got good credit
He give me his credit card & tell me to use debit
Cause being with me, my niggas stay well feeded
He sucking my pussy while he getting his hair dreaded
He smoke trees while I'm up on my knees
After that cooked him steak with grilled cheese
Then back to riding that dick until he can't breathe
He fucked me so good, i couldn't find my weave

[Bridge: cupcakKe]
Remind ya I'm kinda (wet)
Run it down my vagina
(Wet) Run it down my vagina
(Wet) Run it down my vagina
Remind ya I'm kinda (wet)
Run it down my vagina
(Wet) Run it down my vagina
(Wet) Run it down my vagina

[Outro: cupcakKe]
Slurp that dick 'til it cum
Slurp that dick 'til it cum
Slurp that dick 'til it cum
Smack my ass like a drum
Slurp that dick 'til it cum
Suck that dick 'til it cum
Slurp that dick 'til it cum
