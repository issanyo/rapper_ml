[Verse 1]
Her name must be Karen 'cause you just stopped carin'
Broke my heart now it needs some repairin'
With no bitch, I'm gon' be out here sharin'
All you hear is "I" like you 'bout to start darin'
None of this the same like it was in the past
I want you to pay attention, they want you to pay the tab
Convincin' myself like, "It ain't that bad"
See a problem and skip over it like a YouTube ad
I confront you with some shit, you say, "It ain't that deep"
Yeah, it ain't that deep until a bitch go and cheat
You gotta fix this, you actin' fishy like fish sticks
You buggin' like bugs surroundin' at picnics
Don't take this to heart but we losin' our spark
You only come through at night like glow-in-the-dark
Give me more than the dick, man, get on your shit
So many make ups for fuck ups [?] real quick
Man, scratch that, all our good times in my flashback
All you had to do was act 21, no blackjack
Feet hurted, I was on your back like a backpack
See, all I do is reminisce and sit back and backtrack
The kisses ain't the same and the hugs ain't the tighest
I don't even smile and when I do it ain't the whitest
Been with you for a day in a room full of silence
If love don't cost a thing, why the fuck am I so biased?

[Chorus]
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken

[Verse 2]
Do you understand your position?
I just want a man that's consistent
Tryna see inside you is the vision
But I can't 'cause everything look tinted
Think that I ain't noticed that I'm not your main focus?
Can't go a day without dealin' with commotion
Haha, hehe, everything is jokin'
'Till I let a new man get me wet like the ocean
Walk away, you want me back, I walk away like "girl, you snapped"
I walk away, I won't be back, the next day, I'm on your lap
It's a trap to get me back where you want me
I know I'm a snack but that don't mean treat me like a junkie
All you had to do was make me smile like Bridget
I shouldn't have to tweet I'm single for male attention
Everything good then we fuck and make up
The same night you sneakin' out if I don't fuckin' stay up
Yo, I'm tight, am I done fussin'? Not quite
I can't stand and be polite
I don't beat around the bush, I'm not Ike
Done tryna be patient, I'm so irritated, I just wanna know what we're doin'
Tellin' people that I'm taken when there's other things I wanna be pursuin'

[Chorus]
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
