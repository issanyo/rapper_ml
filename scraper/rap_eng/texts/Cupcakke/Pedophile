Pedophile
Pedophile

[Hook]
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Just promise me you won't tell
If I take you to the hotel
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Just promise me you won't tell
If I take you to the hotel

[Verse 1]
Things are so intimate I used to be so innocent
Until he touched me in a spot that made me hot
And ever since nothing really made sense
Something was wrong because he had a beard
Even knowing his age it still felt weird
He had a suit and tie instead of pants hanging
He owned his own company not gang banging
It attracted me, loved it was scared to bring him in public
Society would judge worser than Young Thug
The way his pants hugged and attack me
It struck to my core that I liked grown men
Not 1 or 2 years older, man I'm talking about 10
Ran to him for protection to people opinions
Kept coming and coming like an election
He told me "don't say shit we got to keep it down, erase your call log when my number get dialed"
To get used to it , it really took awhile
Running around town with a pedophile

[Hook]
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Just promise me you won't tell
If I take you to the hotel
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Just promise me you won't tell
If I take you to the hotel

[Verse 2]
Brainwashed with what you tell me
What you mean? I was 15 and you play me like R.Kelly
Ready for suicide I'm getting my tubes tied
Don't want another man on me cause I imagine you inside
Refuse to be abused, misused and bruised
You get accused and act confused fuck wrong with this dude?
Bitch ass prick you ain't slick, why me?
Why I have to be the victim you pick?
I was just a sophomore (yeah bitch)
You belong in one room, no windows, one door
I'm cool and I got God to cherish me
That's the only man  that I need until I get me some therapy

[Hook]
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Just promise me you won't tell
If I take you to the hotel
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Just promise me you won't tell
If I take you to the hotel
