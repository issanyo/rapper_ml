[Intro]
Cake cake cake, it's wartime

[Pre-Hook]
Bitch talking smack they get smacked
Talking smack they get smacked
Talking smack they get smacked
Now go run and tell dem that

Talking smack they get smacked
Talking smack they get smacked
Talking smack they get smacked
Now go run and tell dem that

[Hook x2]
Cause I get them paws (bitch)
Cause I got them paws (bitch)
Cause i got them paws (bitch)
Fuck up yo fucking jaws (uh-huh)

[Verse: CupcakKe]
I'm a give you this pain I'm talking run in yo house
And then take everything that I see and then burn it to flames
You losing yo brain cause fucking with me
Make you my enemy it ain't sweet cause I'm coming insane
What the fuck is you saying?
My money keep calling so fuck all the stalling
Just get out the picture before I just fuck up the frame (damn)
Twitter beefing? You fucking lame money calling my fucking name
Im catching cases over petty bitches I ain't even heard of they fucking name
On the grind always got the 9 for any bitch that ever try to try me
If you press my buttons I'm a show you why you should never ever wanna try me
Fuck a blunt nigga you a get smoked
Got a couple bullets aiming at cho throat keep it blunt hoe Don't jump hoe speak the real dont stunt hoe
If my niggas ain't shooting then I start recruiting
And the streets know it ain't on the low
We can chop it up anywhere you staying
Fuck you telling me location for?
