[Intro]
I don't think motherfuckers understand
It's like this
Listen...

[Verse 1]
Drama free don't speak to me (hell nah), whatchu know about EBT?
I came from nothing no GED, now I got a article on MTV (I do)
Draw the line like yellow tape
Blowing up like overweight
That money talk that money talk
Like anything that Oprah say (that money!)
One second they T'd talking
Come across em they speed walking
Yeah the trigger, I squeeze off it
This the reason why we need coffins
Make it where you can't see straight
Known for the hands like a DJ (wassup?)
I'm only near if my money there or aw shit I'm a be late (busy)
Pull up with the guys, catch a nigga by surprise
Bet yo ass won't survive, I ain't letting shit slide
Choke a nigga with his tie, then I tell him "nice try"
When I'm up to something I cause corruption
Get my hands dirty like construction
One bullet blow that nigga brains out
Make it where that nigga can't function (buh!)
We can meet inside no Ravioli
Waste time, rock him with the Rolly
Then the shotgun get rid of you
I'll stick it on you like Gorilla Glue (you know it)
Fuck out my face tryna bargain
It was days I was out here I was starving
I'm swinging and bringing  gorillas & killers
To charge in like I'm Tarzan
I'm a get it if I want it, CPD know me bitch I'm wanted (I'm wanted)
Fuck around, 'bout to get yo dough scammed
Y'all bitches slower than slow jams
House big like a factory, cannot keep track of me
Niggas came after me, I took they salary
Pull out the chopper then test out the acc'racy
Save yo memorial pic to my gallery
Wonder why they don't see me hardly
Getting more cheese than a pizza party
Damn, I missed your event? I'm sorry
I'm just out being that B like Cardi (bitch)
Thot hoes really need to die hard
Side bitches love to wear side parts
That's they logo and they motto
I then add that all up like a total
I'm so fucking ahead of the game
There's not one bitch that do it the same
Locking the safe then I'm back on a plane
If he come with baggage, then I cannot claim
Please stay the fuck away from me, gotta pay for me
Wanna see me on the show? Have 10K for me
Or, oh well, that's the end of that
I can make that shit up off the Internet
Spin around the block, waiting on a drop
Replace the bullets like outta stock
Let me see a opp, he gone need a doc
Cause I'm poking niggas, no polka dots
All I know is how to grip Glocks
Walk over niggas up in flip flops
I'm a get this money till old age
Make bitches madder than road rage
I'm juiced and I'm saucing
Don't clock in cause I'm bossing
Even crossing guards can't cross me
Bitch better wait 'til I'm crossing
Or it's gonna fuck around and be a issue
Like yo mama crying with the tissue
She got one time to say she miss you
And I'm a send that lil bitch with you
Bye!

[Hook] [x2]
Tarzan ,Tarzan (Woo)
Tarzan, Tarzan (Woo)
Tarzan,Tarzan (Woo)
Tarzan, Tarzan
Swinging and bringing gorillas & killers
To charge in like I'm Tarzan
I'm swinging and bringing gorillas & killers
To charge in like I'm Tarzan!
