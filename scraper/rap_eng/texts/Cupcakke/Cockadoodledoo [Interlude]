[Verse]
Woke up one day like cock-a-doodle doo
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
He woke up one day like cock-a-doodle doo
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
Told me so boldly that I don't want you
What did I do, what did I do? (Tell me)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do? (Lemme know)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do? (Wassup?)
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I do, what did I do?
(What did I do, what did I do?)
What did I, what did I, what did I do?
What did I, what did I, what did I do?
