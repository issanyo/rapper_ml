[Intro:CupcakKe]
Let's get it
Let's get it

[Hook]
I put my figures over these niggas
My figures over these niggas , my figures over these niggas
Put my figures over these niggas
I put my figures over these niggas
My figures over these niggas , my figures over these niggas
Put my figures over these niggas

[Post-Hook]
Cause Benjamin is my nigga
Benjamin is my nigga , Benjamin is my nigga
Put these figures over these niggas
Benjamin is my nigga, Benjamin is my nigga
Benjamin is my nigga
Put these figures over these niggas

[Verse 1: CupcakKe]
I put these figures over these guys
Cause these guys full with them lies
I'm a bitch who tryna survive, so I'm a grind till the day I die
I say how could you be a broke bitch
But you giving yo pussy up so fucking easy?
You on your knees while licking my pearl
Is the only way that you could please me
You can have my nigga I don't want that nigga
I'll put him up for adoption
They say I won't make it but fuck they opinion
Don't need no petty ass options
My mindset saying fuck these niggas
I really dont need to fuck with niggas
So shout out to them bitches thats working that 9 to 5
Not depending on no nigga go and get it on yo time
If you asking me I dont need that
Stomp a bitch in my combats
Bands on bands, I got that
Whack a bitch cause I'm bout that
A nigga fuck with my figures
This chopper gone be his feedback
And that's coming straight from the heart
I got to feed the fam we can't starve
No days, give a fuck what you say
Just play yo motherfucking part
See I fuck around and just break your heart
I'm giving niggas no fucking love
I'm giving niggas no fucking love
And this is how it all  start

[Hook + Post-Hook]

[Bridge]
So ladies who take your heart might need a bullet proof vest
Cause at the fucking end we only settle for best

And that's them figures, figures, figures, figures
Over niggas
Niggas, niggas, niggas
That's them figures figures figures figures
Over niggas niggas niggas niggas
Say that's them figures, figures, figures, figures
Over niggas niggas niggas niggas

[Outro]
I just kilt that shit
