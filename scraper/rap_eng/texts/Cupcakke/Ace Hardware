[Verse 1]
I done been through it all
Stealing shit up out the mall
Got arrested, had my mama stressing
That one day she would get the wrong call
Only got two fits on my dresser
Go to school dealing with depression
Getting teased cause I couldn't read
So I told the teacher, "I'm a skip this lecture"
Running out of class super fucking fast
Fuck a hall pass, homework in the trash
I'm so damn pissed, now I gotta piss
I walk in, you won't guess who up in this bitch
A young girl sitting on the floor
She got a reputation like she the school hoe
They wrote all on her locker, dosed her up with flakka
Every night she getting raped by her father
Told her, "Just pray for the best"
Went to CVS for a pregnancy test
And I swear, it couldn't get no worse
Feel like I'm sitting here dealing with a curse
Mama took all the visas quick
Friends calling her a piece of shit
Father sent her back to school, tryna play it cool
With a black eye shades could fix
How could you molest your own child?
And still go to work so damn proud?
Cause you love the sound of her screaming loud
You a sick motherfucker, let me tell you now

[Pre-Hook]
Who was there?
Who was there, when she scream help?
Who was there, who was there?
It was just herself

[Hook]
Ain't nobody got no heart here
Tell me how did I start here?
Been cutting myself, not loving myself
Got a life that's harder than Ace Hardware
Ain't nobody got no heart here
Tell me how did I start here?
Been cutting myself, not loving myself
Got a life that's harder than Ace Hardware

(Ain't nobody got no heart here
Tell me how did I start here?
Been cutting myself, not loving myself
Got a life that's harder than Ace Hardware)

[Post-Hook]
Who was there?
Who was there? When she scream help?
Who was there, who was there?
It was just herself

[Verse 2]
Noticed she was getting underpaid
Now she headed to public aid
Tryna get food stamps for the newborn
The struggle feel unreal like a unicorn
Baby girl stretching a hundred dollars in food
She wanna eat from home, but daddy spit in her food
Take her to the back when her mom fall asleep
Told her, "take it like you grown if you want something to eat"
He tied her hands down, pulled her pants down
She start to bleed, imagine dealing with this shit every day of the week
He force it in till 10, she start to feel weak
Wrapped his hands around her mouth and realized she couldn't breathe
He told her, "Shut up, get the fuck up, I don't love ya, clean this nut up"
Her mother coming down the hall
It's the only real way that she looked up
But mama still pretend she ain't see shit
While her daughter feelin' so seasick
Well not seasick, 'cause that's a understatement
Her family treat her so underrated
She banging on my door, we gotta go in a rush
Grab my coat now we in the ER, rush
Doctor face so straight it's the scariest
Looked her in the eye and tell her she miscarried it

[Pre-Hook]
Who was there?
Who was there, when she scream help?
Who was there, who was there?
It was just herself

[Hook]
Ain't nobody got no heart here
Tell me how did I start here?
Been cutting myself, not loving myself
Got a life that's harder than Ace Hardware
Ain't nobody got no heart here
Tell me how did I start here?
Been cutting myself, not loving myself
Got a life that's harder than Ace Hardware

(Ain't nobody got no heart here
Tell me how did I start here?
Been cutting myself, not loving myself
Got a life that's harder than Ace Hardware)
