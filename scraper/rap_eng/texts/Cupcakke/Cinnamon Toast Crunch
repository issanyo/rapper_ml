[Intro]
I was hungry as hell writing this shit
I don't even give no fuck
Let's go

[Hook]
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch (Yo! Yo!)
I got bitches wanna box me like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
I just pull up and I square up like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
I got bitches wanna box me like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
I just pull up and I square up like I'm cinnamon toast crunch

[Verse 1]
It ain't no glitch when your heart stop
I've been that bitch since the start, Doc
Dude wanna trap me, that smart cock
But I made him pull out like a park lot
I'm counting real bank in a Rover
At the most, gave me cold shoulders
But now I'm making bitches pay for it
Like a new fit at FashionNova
You could never do it, watch how I pursue it
Money, I've been doing, I need life insurance
Bitch yo money little, so we call you Stuart
Been there, done that like a motherfucking tourist
Yeah, the money nice, it is so polite
Spent it Sunday night, Monday got it twice
Out here living life, bounce through with the rice
They say money talk? I see why they shy
Sweatsuits in the studio, running through the B-side track
I should buy these other hoes real suits
'Cause I'm everything that they slack
Bitches really got it twisted, I'm not talking one liter with a cap
I don't fuck with none of these bitches, not even Siri on Google Maps
Refrigerator is full for the hater
I'm not 'bout to wait her, broke bitch see you later
It's levels like layers, they offering paper
They want me to sign but I'm acting like Draya
Ain't signin' shit, bitch, bye
10 Mill of that shit dry
Good dick'll make you squint your eye
Then I'm dipping like a french fry

[Hook]
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch (Yo! Yo!)
I got bitches wanna box me like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
I just pull up and I square up like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
I got bitches wanna box me like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
I just pull up and I square up like I'm cinnamon toast crunch

[Verse 2]
My niggas got munchies, soon auntie gon' cook
They blowin' weed like the Big Bad Wolf
Tellin' me stories on everything they took
But I don't repeat shit but a motherfucking hook
Bitches be irkin' me, beat her 'til burgundy
Went through emergency, now she need surgery
Now that you heard of me, you should be worried, G
Saying "first of all" will lead to a first degree
Show her I'm not to be played with
Fuck who that lil' bitch came with
You cross me, I'ma cross you back
With the cross on a first-aid kit
Get more than a bruise, get put on the news
I'm talkin' to you, so put on a zoot
Got nothing to prove, don't fuck up the mood
Been makin' more noise than Lollapalooz'
I'm not just talking 'bout the music side
Money love me, don't confuse the bride
Pay me first like a Uber ride
I keep shit jumpin' like the Puma sign
No one making me pause, bitch!
Your weave smelling like dog shit!
Doing numbers like a call list!
Closet like a mini mall, bitch!
Switch up the flows, when I do it, it's raw
These bitches ain't even got a verse that could touch me
Pack the straws, when I'm picking at those
'Cause when I drag bitches, I like to be comfty
Feelin' like I got gold comin'
Fake rappers ain't sold nothin'
Everybody tryna hold somethin'
Pussy drippin' like my nose runnin'

[Hook]
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch (Yo! Yo!)
I got bitches wanna box me like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
I just pull up and I square up like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
I got bitches wanna box me like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
I just pull up and I square up like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
