[Intro]
Lets go

[Verse 1]
Used to make me feel like I was that bitch
Now ain't nothing working out like a fat bitch
We from a million person so when I'm a see you in person
I ask but get gassed like a catfish
See you not here for me, you here for the pussy
Building an empire but you focused on cookies
Got big balls to step out the room to take a call
In front of my face and still walking away down the hall
No shit nigga, this definitely hurt
Imagining you under that bitch skirt
Constantly want you by me, but you only supply me
With dick and more dick, you gotta get up my ally
Might wanna find yo mind cause you clearly lost it
Its plenty niggas in this market, I ain't talking 'bout Boston
I'm the one that hold you down like every fucking day
But you think I'm your sex slave from Fifty Shades of Gray

[Hook]
Gotta get with it, get with it, get with it before I leave
You everything I wanted, but not nothing what I need
Now I gotta get rid of you, like an abortion
Cause you can't give me your all, you only give me portions
Gotta get with it, get with it, get with it before I leave
You everything I wanted, but not nothing what I need
Now I gotta get rid of you, like an abortion
Cause you can't give me your all, you only give me portions

Fuck a ride or die if we don't see eye to eye (Fuck 'em)
Fuck a ride or die if we don't see eye to eye (Fuck 'em)
Fuck a ride or die if we don't see eye to eye (Fuck 'em)
Fuck a ride or die if we don't see eye to eye (Fuck 'em)

[Verse 2]
I thought I might of let you off the wrong hook
Until I accidentally clicked on your phone book
You got hella bitches with different ages
More numbers in your phone than the Yellow Pages
I won't hesitate to separate from all the drama
Steady saying you moving on, let me do you the honor
Accepted yo biggest flaws but you do me this way
Yo new bitch and little dick could really have a nice day
Cause I'm convinced we ain't meant
Need some space, let me vent
Got the details from the emails that you say wasn't sent
Damn brick got me bent, when I left that's where you went
So indirect like a hint, she want all yo time you spent

[Hook]
Gotta get with it, get with it, get with it before I leave
You everything I wanted, but not nothing what I need
Now I gotta get rid of you, like an abortion
Cause you can't give me your all, you only give me portions
Gotta get with it, get with it, get with it before I leave
You everything I wanted, but not nothing what I need
Now I gotta get rid of you, like an abortion
Cause you can't give me your all, you only give me portions

Fuck a ride or die if we don't see eye to eye (Fuck 'em)
Fuck a ride or die if we don't see eye to eye (Fuck 'em)
Fuck a ride or die if we don't see eye to eye (Fuck 'em)
Fuck a ride or die if we don't see eye to eye (uh)

[Outro]
(Fuck 'em)
(Fuck 'em)
(Fuck 'em)
