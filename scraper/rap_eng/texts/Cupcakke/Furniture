[Intro]
I'm calling and calling, this nigga got me sitting in the fucking crib
I can't believe this shit man, like a piece of fucking furniture?
(huh) Never again

[Verse 1]
I came across a nigga online that wanted my time
Thought  it was different but it was just  the same pickup line
He said before just to score trying to get my lingerie to hit the floor
Buff tough and rough he had my trust
Until his story got old and started to collect dust
The tea start spilling only two weeks in and got to replace him like a fill in
Screenshot is my witness he text me "Good morning"
But also forward it to six other bitches
Yo bullshit I can't believe it
Dishing it out to me so get ready to receive it
This not a one way street
We argue over little shit like a link or a tweet
It start out sweet until he feel like you weak
Niggas always think that they smarter than Akeelah and the Bee
But they not , they really not
My position ain't to be in competition for the number one spot
Currently in shock while I'm watching the clock
Feeling like furniture in the house of a thot
Supposed to be my spouse should never have to ask you to take me out
Are you embarrassed cause I got stretch marks?
But I thought love sparks deeper than appearance
I wanna hit yo ass with my knuckles we a couple
But you got a couple Blacks and Jamaicans
Asians and Caucasians you dress like its a special occasion
I wanna go but the car seats is taken
That mean it just seem like a vacation
I'm yo bitch, but I'm sitting in the basement?

[Chorus]
Apparently you busy it's driving me dizzy
Turn yo back on me then you turn to her
You don't take  me out you just leave me in the house
Sitting there like a piece of furniture what
Furniture furniture furniture what
Furniture furniture furniture what
Furniture furniture furniture
Furniture furniture furniture

Apparently you busy it's driving me dizzy
Turn yo back on me then you turn to her
You don't take me out you just leave me in the house
Sitting there like a piece of furniture what
Furniture furniture furniture what
Furniture furniture furniture what
Furniture furniture furniture
Furniture furniture furniture
