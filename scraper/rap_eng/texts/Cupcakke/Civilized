[Verse 1]
Please understand that I don't want you to stand back (come here baby)
Every time I walked away from this, nigga you ran back (ran back ran back)
And I swear to God, that's what I love about you
Question myself every time I doubt you
Cause I know that you care, breath of fresh air
I get bubbly inside every time that you stare
You love me even when I'm ugly
Make love to me, don't fuck me
Gotta make me feel so lovely
With a long grandma hug or don't touch me
Ignore them hoes when the phone run
So yeah, you in it for the long run
You mine now through thick or thin
So if she gave you brain, tell her think again

[Hook]
Won me like a prize (a prize)
Never tell me lies (no lies)
When you on me side (me side)
I feel civilized
Won me like a prize
Never tell me lies (no no)
When you on me side
I feel civilized (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Lit like a candle
Love how you handle every little thing that I throw your way
Give you a sample of some of my flaws
But through it all, man I know you gon' stay
We poppin' like a two liter
I think I found myself a keeper
Telling you secrets knowin' you'll keep it
Never put me on blast like a speaker
Cause we so tight, it feels so right
Booty rubs through the night
Just take the stress away from a heavy day
Let's live a stress free life
Don't make me walk to the corner store by myself
Cause you gone have these niggas thinking I'm by myself
Want you around me all day like a Hermes belt
To avoid the past boys and the hurt I felt

[Hook 3x]
Won me like a prize (a prize)
Never tell me lies (no lies)
When you on me side (me side)
I feel civilized (yeah yeah)
Won me like a prize
Never tell me lies (no no)
When you on me side
I feel civilized (yeah yeah)

[Outro 6x]
Won me won me won me won me won me like a prize (no no)
Never never never never never tell me lies (yeah yeah)
