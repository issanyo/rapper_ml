40 in my pants bitch I keep them bands

[CupcakKe]
Bet I wrap a couple solo, finna swing that bitch like a yo-yo
Watch you die in slow-mo
Yo nigga could share the bullet with you, no promo
Coming deep like the temptation
Each one of yall can catch a situation
You want war? Bitch that flatters me
Chopper going off like low batteries
I'm the motherfucking man of the hour
Keep a bowl of white like clam chowder
Bitch like I'm hot no I do not come out of
Give you some patches but no they not sour
Everybody stay tryna con a vet
Bitch I get more coins than a laundromat
And I'll beat cho ass like its urgent
So watch yo mouth I mean wash yo mouth with detergent
When shit get hard when you pull my card I be up in motion
Tryna take my life but I stay on guard like I'm at the ocean
Shells hit you from the back no turtle
Got him tight as fuck like a girdle
And yeah I got a couple teardrops
And its not from the color purple
