[Intro]
Meow, meow, meow
Here, kitty kitty
Here, kitty kitty

[Verse 1]
On my period so you know his cum red (Ah)
I get on top then on bottom like a bunk bed (Ah)
Bake the cake so you know his ass a junkie
Don't want no sausage if you ain't got lunch bread
No I'm not afraid of no penis (Nah)
Baby with the head, I am a genius (Ah)
Scary movie, better have me screamin' (Ah)
Pussy warm you up if you anemic, ayy (Yeah), ayy
Give me that workout like your name J. Cole
Coughin' on that dick like I just caught a cold
Twat taste like honey, no beehive, no Hov'
He feel more pussy than a stripping pole (Yeah)
Tarzan dick, he be swingin' it in me (Gimme)
Black or white dick or any color like Fenty (Fenty)
Made him believe we in a whole 'nother city
'Cause I sip on that dick, call me Mississippi
Hear me moan, pullin' on my thong
Cum in my mouth, make it look like foam
Played him for the dome, then told him be gone
This pubic hair so nappy that nigga broke my comb

[Chorus]
Fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, Garfield
I got a, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, Garfield
Garfield, Garfield, Garfield
This pussy heavy just like a barbell
I got a, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, lookin' like Garfield

[Verse 2]
My pipe burst, nigga get to plumbin' (Plunger)
Youngin but you fuckin' with a woman (A woman)
Not talkin' car ride but he pulled to the side
Of this pussy like the ambulance comin' (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Favorite TV show of all times
He said I'm killin' that pussy, Criminal Minds (Beat me up)
Told him bend me over, go'n get behind (Ah)
The dick spinnin' in me like the clothes dryin' (Whoa, whoa)
Baby go slow but not talkin' retarded
Back up on that dick like I'm parallel parking (Skrrt)
Cherry in the hole, look like the logo of Target
Twat full of juice so you know that I'm chargin' (Ah)
Night night dick, here come that KO (KO)
Came on his dick, look like alfredo
Danced on that dick like I was J. Lo
Mouth to his mic like on the Sway show
On my face, is it cum? Is it snow snow snow?
Gift them all with this twat, that's a ho ho ho
He say what's better than this dick? Let me know know know
I looked him dead in the eye, said Wendy's Four for Four, hype

[Chorus]
Fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, Garfield
I got a, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, Garfield
Garfield, Garfield, Garfield
This pussy heavy just like a barbell
I got a, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, lookin' like Garfield

[Chorus]
Fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, Garfield
I got a, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, Garfield
Garfield, Garfield, Garfield
This pussy heavy just like a barbell
I got a, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, fat cat, lookin' like Garfield

[Outro]
Garfield (Meow)
