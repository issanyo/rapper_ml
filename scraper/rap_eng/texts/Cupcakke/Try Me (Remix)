So I been waiting on a bitch to try me
Come on bitch try me!
Try me bitch!
Just so I can get in that ass!


Let a nigga try me , try me
Better say yo prayers if you standing by me
Turn yo funeral into a rally (bitch)
Garbage bag a nigga body in the alley (I will)
Let a nigga try me , try me
Better say yo prayers if you standing by me
Turn yo funeral into a rally
Garbage bag a nigga body in the alley


Bitch I'm doing hits on my fucking lonely (I am)
You came with yo crew left with no homies (you did)
I got Montana blowing we ain't talking Tony (uh uh)
Guns longer than the hair on Brazilian pony's (it is)
Send a bitch to Jesus in all white like Miley (I will)
Catch me on my mugshots fucking smiling
He was crying worser than a baby whining
So I sliced that nigga tongue out that was perfect timing (turn up)


Say bitch don't try me, try me and since you on my dick
Drop them panties , ride me
Put the nine to my boss made his ass hire me
And that bitch knew better not to fucking fire me (lets get it)
Cause he knowing I'm a threat ten bullets in his chest (yup)
Next time you should wear a motherfuckin' vest (yup)
Say you working hard now you need to get some rest
I put a pillow in his casket now he cozy when he rest (damn)

You run yo mouth up on the beat
You getting buried in the sand
Seeing straight through bitches
And I ain't gotta read they hand (I dont)
I must be fucking shooting at the gingerbread man
Cause I had him running while leaking blood
Like catch me if you can (pussy)

And when I find these niggas fuck it talk is cheap
Just know I'm looking for you ,like hide & go seek
I got my niggas watching every move you make
Before yo ass get baked
We in yo windows taking peeks like a fuckin' creep (damn)

I got so much dirt up on you like a fucking coffin
Claim you got a foreign why the fuck you walking?
I'm all action got the bracket keep my mouth closed
I be shooting lows like a library you better know
I dont do no talking

Chicago need to stick together with a damn superglue
If you ain't fucking niggas up, bitch I am recruiting you (I am)
If yo mans jump in thats just gone make me kill both of you (it will)
I'm a serial killer I got the milk and a bowl for you (I do)

Try me , try me
Better say yo prayers if you standing by me
Turn yo funeral into a rally
Garbage bag a nigga body in the alley
Let a nigga try me , try me
Better say yo prayers if you standing by me
Turn yo funeral into a rally
Garbage bag a nigga body in the alley
