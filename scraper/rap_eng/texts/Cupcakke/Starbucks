[Verse 1]
Money comin' in, gotta count it, it’s a must
Since you smokin' niggas, that's a Hot Cheeto puff
All these niggas do is walk around like they tough
’Til a nigga get shot like Mussolin's butt
Fuck all that shit, I don't gotta act hard (Nah)
21 and I'm walkin' with a black card (Yeah)
Ran up a check, I should be a track star
He ain't eatin' right, so I make the cat fart
Right on that nigga face (Haha)
Should've saw his expression, look like he got maced
Fuck what that nigga say (Fuck him, fuck him)
Shoes untied, but I still win a race
I’m on a whole ’nother level, bitch, I stand out (Stand out)
Cookie jar bitches got they hands out (Hands out)
If you don't answer, then I’m at your man's house (Man's house)
Nickname, "Get More," 'cause he ran out
What trends have you set? Can I ask? (Can I ask?)
Rockin’ lace fronts but you come in last
Hoes swear they be gettin' that bag (What?)
Same bitch wear clothes with a tag
Weak ass music got my ear bleedin'
My bitches don't jump, we ain't cheerleadin'
Noise in the crib, I don't fear demons
Claimin' they woke, but they still dreamin'

[Chorus]
Wake him up with a large cup, large cup, large cup
Give him some of that Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks
When they see me, they starstruck, starstruck, starstruck
Big money, call it Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks (Hahaha)

[Verse 2]
So much money, I don't know what to do with it (Do with it)
Might fuck around, tie my shoe with it (Shoe with it)
Same-ass me with a new image (New image)
We all know why shorty tooth missin'
I get straight to it, I don't stall (I don't stall)
Edges on Mr. Clean, bitch, bald (Bald head)
You said that pussy tighter than a straw
But he told me he couldn't even feel it raw
Okay, um, hello
Scared bitch, scarecrow
Some of my nails broke
'Cause I made her eye match her elbow, wait
Ain't got time for no rival (Rival)
I stay booked like the Bible (Bible)
In these streets, I'm so liable
To tote that rifle and send hoes higher than the Eiffel
Shit never stop like a hot mom
I'm here to the end like dot com
Rastas pull up like, "Wagwan?"
"Let me know if you need a new shotgun"
I'm like, "Okay, merch that, uncle"
Too much money, how can I be humble?
I can never be a letdown, save that for the hair up on Rapunzel

[Chorus]
Wake him up with a large cup, large cup, large cup
Give him some of that Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks
When they see me, they starstruck, starstruck, starstruck
Big money, call it Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks
