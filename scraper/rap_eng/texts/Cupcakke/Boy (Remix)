[Verse 1: Kara Lane]
Whistle at me as you ride your bike down Cherry Street
Oh, you're very sweet
We spend two days with nothing on
But cassette tapes from '93

[Pre-Chorus: Kara Lane]
Boy, my joy's in your skin, boy
When we get to talking, boy
I really want it, boy
All of my real filthy dreams come true
When I pull you in the bar bathroom

[Chorus: Kara Lane]
Oh, boy, I like your tongue in my mouth
Oh, boy, I like my back on your couch
Oh, boy, come on and put my anxious heart to rest

[Post-Chorus: Kara Lane]
Boy boy, boy boy
Boy boy, boy boy

[Verse 2: CupcakKe]
Don't tell me nah, pull down your draws
Don't take no calls (oh boy)
Pussy what you saw, you can have it all
And hit it raw (any time)
I don't call it moving fast (fast)
Now come fuck me in the ass (ass)
Your dick brightened up my day (yes)
Like a camera on flash (flash)
Frustrated I'm not the one that you want
We only be fuckin' like once every month
Why am I stuck on you? I must be drunk
When I got niggas trickin' like you got punked
But I picked you to be my boy, boy
So can I bounce on your face like boing, boing
The dick hard every time I'm around it
Once he see me I swear it won't go out
Like it's grounded

[Pre-Chorus: Kara Lane]
All of my real filthy dreams come true
When I pull you in the bar bathroom

[Chorus: Kara Lane]
Oh, boy, I like your tongue in my mouth
Oh, boy, I like my back on your couch
Oh, boy, come on and put my anxious heart to rest
Oh, boy, I like your tongue in my mouth
Oh, boy, I like my back on your couch
Oh, boy, come on and put my anxious heart to rest

[Post-Chorus: Kara Lane]
Boy boy, boy boy
Boy boy, boy boy
Boy boy, boy boy
Boy boy, boy boy

[Outro: Kara Lane]
Boy, my joy's in your skin, boy
When we get to talking, boy
I really want it, boy
