[Intro]
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight

[Verse 1]
My sister wheezing, so I'm speeding down the E-way
Having a baby
Don't blame me for being late (don't blame me)
Officer light so bright, I hear a siren (What the fuck?)
Pull me over and it's over, shots firing (*buh-buh*)
Bleeding bad
Tryna look at his badge (Wassup?)
Blood bath 'cause he decided to spaz
Aiming at my brain to put me under a grave
Cop say, "Yo car was moving faster than a runaway slave."
(Damn)
Than I froze
Can't even stand up on my toes (nah)
Why shoot when there's a taser and a pole? (Why, man?)
Blue and black lives matter, who knows? (Who knows, who knows?)
Is you gonna call it in?
The ambulance, they could have took me (yeah)
It's always that one cop that try to be a rookie
This ain't right
Why blacks and whites can't stick together through whatever?
Sorta like a duplex cookie, you fucking rookie

[Verse 2]
They don't really want us to speak (shh)
It's about unity
Right now, I'm rapping on a white man's beat (I am)
'Cause I'm complete and comfortable with me
Every white man is not corrupted as the white men we see
I could vouch for that
But some still stuck in a state of mind
Or putting us behind and making us leave out the back (where we're parked)
Play that damn angel when they among us (yeah)
But 164 years back they hung us (y'all did that)
I'm not a slave to the white man or white woman standing by me
I'm not a slave to the record labels bidding how to sign me
I am not a slave, I am brave
Video every cop that make us stop
Before our body drop and be sure to press "save"
We need that for proof, these cops they goof
They pull you over and shoot, then play it off like, "Oops."
Intimidated by our presence, so he be drawing the weapon
Not screaming justice for nothing
We not gone, keep on failing (nah)

[Hook]
Beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves, we just not picking cotton (in the feilds)
Y'all beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves, we just not picking cotton (we need a pill)
Y'all beat us and treat us so rotten (so rotten)
Beat us and treat us so rotten (so rotten)
Beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves, we just not picking cotton

[Bridge]
Of course, there's no remorse upon the force
Freedom of speech 'til I'm hoarse
You ain't gotta (you ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta (you ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta call me a nigga
I'm dead, even if I surrender
You ain't gotta call me a nigga
I'm dead, even if I surrender
Oh, yo, you ain't gotta call me a nigga
I'm dead, even if I surrender
I said you ain't gotta call me a nigga
I'm dead, even if I surrender
