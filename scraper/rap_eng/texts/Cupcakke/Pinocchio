[Hook]
Wanted to be in love looking for Romeo (Aha)
Instead, I found a thugged out Pinocchio (Aha)
Typical liar know how to get me fired up (Yo)
If only Pinocchio knew how to shut the fuck up (Shh)

Wanted to be in love looking for Romeo
Instead, I found a thugged out Pinocchio (Let's go)
Typical liar know how to get me fired up (Up)
If only Pinocchio knew how to shut the fuck up

[Verse]
I got his bags packed like a storage
Cause he kept going out like a shortage
Talking to bitches acting suspicious
I don't even see how I ever adored this (I can't)
You swear to God yo ass be at work  (You lying)
If you is you fucking the store clerk (Yup)
I'm not putting shit on delay you put her on three-way
Or I'm selling yo shit on eBay (He gotta go)
You having an affair and don't even care (Nope)
Tell me you not there but you over there
Of course, you would blame it on getting bored
But I cut niggas off from me like umbilical chords
I'm on my way to sleep so he hopped in the Jeep (Yup)
Sent her a tweet talking 'bout “Lets meet” (The fuck?)
I thought he was getting the Hennessy
Whole time he was out and about feeling on Kimberly
Uh!
