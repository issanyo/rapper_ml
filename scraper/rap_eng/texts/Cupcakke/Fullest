[Verse 1]
Saucy, saucy, so damn bossy, pussy creamin' in his coffee
Guaranteed he 'bout to stalk me, if he's walkie, we can't talkie
Nope, these bitches washed up, Dove soap
They pockets on fizz, call it broke
Pokin' at my ass just to make these bitches mad might bag a nigga like a tote
Fresh air goin' through my hair, I don't care, bitch, I'm just ridin'
It's that 24/7 grindin' now we pulling more strings than zip-linin'
This that "I don't wanna go back" recycled moonwalk 'cause shit could get violent
This that, "Let me call you right back, I'm with my side nigga" then put phone on silent
'Cause I'm nobody's bae, snap out of the daze
Find your way out like you up in a maze
Switchin' up niggas 'cause they like the play
So all I do is con these niggas like Ye
Don't know shit about me, I stay low
Got whores on me and I got hay, loaves
Ain't up on nobody payroll 'cause my attitude nasty like Nero

[Chorus]
Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you, yeah
Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you (Donald you)

[Post-Chorus]
Clown your ass to the fullest
Like bitch, your ass ain't the fullest
You can't ever make me look foolish
'Cause my bank account look the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest
The only thing you draw is them eyebrows
And them bitches still ain't the fullest

[Verse 2]
Raspberry timbs man, these bitches is bloody
I don't wear Uggs man, them bitches is ugly
Your finger empty but you call him "hubby"
Bitch, you a mother, motherfuckin' dummy
You, don't understand life
You, Harold's Chicken, get it fried
You, a broken car with no drive
You, not a you no more, you a "why?"
Put a dot on your head like a lowercase 'I'
Bullets hit males and females, it's bi
Hot like the desert, but life never dry
I ain't talkin' to no cops, just tell 'em I'm shy
Why your numbers goin' down like a tracklist? (let me know)
I spend that money then that shit do a backflip
We not alike, so you shouldn't double tap this
Drop a body in two seconds like I'm a baptist
Rest in peace under my mattress
Bitches dead to me, I'm smokin' they ashes
Niggas ain't savage, they dick ain't even longer than they bitch lashes
Had to branch off, cause the tree I was under was so fuckin' shady
Now money stuffin' up my wallet so you know damn well that I'm gravy

[Chorus]
Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you, yeah
Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you (Donald you)

[Post-Chorus]
Clown your ass to the fullest
Like bitch, your ass ain't the fullest
You can't ever make me look foolish
'Cause my bank account look the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest
The only thing you draw is them eyebrows
And them bitches still ain't the fullest

[Chorus]
Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you, yeah
Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you (Donald you)

[Post-Chorus]
Clown your ass to the fullest
Like bitch, your ass ain't the fullest
You can't ever make me look foolish
'Cause my bank account look the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest
The only thing you draw is them eyebrows
And them bitches still ain't the fullest
