[Intro: Lil Phag]
Ooo, Lil Phag
Lil Phag, Lil Phag, Lil Phag...

[Verse 1: Lil Phag]
Lil Phag pull up in the Coupe with your man
Talkin' mad shit but your bitch is a fan
Skip the whole line then I pop me a xan
Dr Woke cook beats like a chef with a pan
Your man say straight but he go both ways
Gave him a bar and he gave me brain
Juggling my balls like Cirque du Soleil
He told me don't tell, but it's too late
He wants this dick cause I'm too paid
White stain on his shirt like toothpaste
Played your man like 2K
Gucci flip flops no shoe lace

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
Iced out wrist
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch

[Verse 2: Dr Woke]
Dr Woke waking up in your bitch
Grinding all up on my amethyst
I got cock for the Chakra alignment
My crystals imported, my quartz are the finest
Wanna fuck cause she feeling my aura
Bending over like he doing yoga
Catch me out in another dimension
I'm busting a nut call that astral projection, like woo
I'm woke and all you bitches stay broke
Blow your money on coke
While I'm buying Gucci fur coats
Kombucha all in my throat
Essential oils, let's go
I'm elevated and hella faded
When I pull up in that ghost

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch

[Verse 3: cupcakKe]
Pussy gonna cream like whip, yeah
Keep it on the low, mouth zipped, yeah
Fuck him for the money and the tip, yeah
I don't ride for free, no lip trip, yeah
Gave him the cookie so he gave me his empire
Bitch I am feeling like a pimp, yeah
Pussy so wet my panties say caution
The dick might fuck around and slip, yeah
Bitch I'm in my bag like Lays
Pussy colder than ice age (you know it)
Twat sweeter than Kool-Aid (ooh)
Pussy tight like new braids (that's tight)
Let him put it on me
Ride just like a pony
Yeah it's wetter than Kony
Now his mouth getting foamy
His dick kind of lonely
So the pussy is his homey
Call his dick frosted flakes
Cause it's colder than Tony

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
Iced out wrist, iced out dick
Lil Phag came and stole your bitch
