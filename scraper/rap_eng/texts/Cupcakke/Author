[Verse 1]
S-s-s-s-soft pillow with a dildo
Since you out fucking on a real hoe
Got 20 bitches entertaining you
Like cheerleaders at a field show
I'on give a fuck cause you cheated once
And you must think I’ma still let you
Call after call when I'm with you
Let me guess dude, it’s a bill collector?
Yeah, yeah, yeah same excuse
Damn boy, how lame is you?
This that shit that anger do
Cause you let hoes hang with you
Everytime I try to talk to you is like all you do is start hollering
You got me walking on eggshells everyday like this Halloween
What if it’s not meant, all that time we spent
Do it all vanish?
How do men find a way to call them all bae
How they even manage?
Now you tryna take advantage
Since you realize that you all I got
Help me understand how you never call
But you tryna call the shots?
Want you by me , don’t gotta buy me
Be with me all the time like an ID
Something telling me you got a side piece
And thinkin’ I’m a let it slide B (That's dead)
Fuck naw, matter fact, fuck y’all
I’d rather get my foot sawed
If this the pain that love cause

[Chorus]
This whole thing so awkward (I swear)
I’m irritated don’t bother (I swear)
Comin’ home after doing wrong
With another story like a author
Probably got a son and a daughter (On the low)
Cause trusting you getting harder (Gotta go)
Say your phone dead every time I call
But you left out with your charger

This whole thing so awkward (I swear)
I’m irritated don’t bother (I swear)
Comin’ home after doing wrong
With another story like an author
Probably got a son and a daughter (On the low)
Cause trusting you getting harder (Gotta go)
Say your phone dead every time I call
But you left out with yo charger

[Verse 2]
I stand by the truth like a pulpit
I deserve much better than this bullshit
I don’t know what made you think you could pull this
We gotta fix a lot of shit with a tool kit
Really shawty, you a busy body and you always on the go
Just wanted it to be me and you like we was about to elope
We splitting, cause you don’t get it
You cappin' harder than a fitted
Got caught you almost shitted
Hurry up and leave my digits
I treated you like royalty
Couldn’t even get no loyalty
Got me then you stop spoiling me
Starting to feel like you torture me
If you into me, show me chemistry
I’m a fuck around and think you spinnin’ me
A ex-nigga is what you finna be
I ain’t showing you no sympathy
I’m back off you mad soft
How you treat women like this?
It’s really sad how you act mad
But ain’t got the right to be pissed
I’m always second best
I shouldn’t have to second guess
I’m a toss yo ass to the next bitch
And tell her “psst, psst go fetch” (Bitch)
Need me a nigga who gone try his hardest
Paint you the picture since, yes I’m a artist
If you can’t be here when shit gets the darkest
Get to the side like a cop  when I park it

[Chorus]
This whole thing so awkward (I swear)
I’m irritated don’t bother (I swear)
Comin’ home after doing wrong
With another story like an author
Probably got a son and a daughter (On the low)
Cause trusting you getting harder (Gotta go)
Say your phone dead every time I call
But you left out with your charger

This whole thing so awkward (I swear)
I’m irritated don’t bother (I swear)
Comin’ home after doing wrong
With another story like an author
Probably got a son and a daughter (On the low)
Cause trusting you getting harder (Gotta go)
Say your phone dead every time I call
But you left out with your charger
