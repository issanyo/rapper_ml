[Intro: Mozart's Sister]
I was just a lonely girl
In the eyes of my inner child
But I could be anything I want
And no matter where I go
You'll always be here in my heart
Here in my heart, here in my heart
I don't even have to explain
Just leave me alone now
I can't be held down
I can't be held down
I can be anything I want (Immaterial boys, immaterial girls)
I can be anything I want (Immaterial boys, immaterial girls)
Anyhow, anywhere, anyone (Immaterial boys, immaterial girls)
Any form, any shape (Immaterial boys, immaterial girls)
Anything, I can be anything I want (Immaterial boys, immaterial girls)

[Verse 1: cupcakKe]
I thought I came but I peed on the dick
Pubic hair got inches, that's weave on the dick
Pussy like a tree, it got leaves on the shit
Bang bang this pussy, Chief Keef with the dick
Climbing on that dick, need a 10 feet ladder
I love the D, that's my favorite letter
My nudes in your phone, takin' up your data
My cakes got fatter by usin' cum as the batter
Look down to your dick and tell him I won't disappoint it
Pussy on punishment if she miss a dick appointment
Sloppy toppy for papi, leave sloppy Joe shook
I only call you Captain, 'cause your dick is off the hook

[Chorus]
HARD
Tap the head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Get that dick up and runnin' when he fuck this cooch
Covered in all my cum, the dick be lookin' like a goose
Head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Get that dick up and runnin' when he fuck this cooch
Covered in all my cum, the dick be lookin' like a goose

[Verse 2: cupcakKe]
Twat so wet, you could take a cruise on it
Suckin' yo neck till I leave a bruise on it
Let you eat the pussy, just don't use a spoon on it
Put it in a box like you 'bout to move on it
This that submarine pussy, Mr. Clean pussy
This that I'm 'bout to fuck you longer than the limousine pussy
High self-esteem pussy, it's a dream pussy
If you broke, then the pussy actin' funny like a meme pussy
Easy-Bake Oven, and this pussy so similar
Touchin' yo head but ain't checkin' the temperature
Got the dick on lock like a motherfuckin' prisoner
Nut in my pussy hair, that's deep conditioner

[Chorus]
HARD
Tap the head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Get that dick up and runnin' when he fuck this cooch
Covered in all my cum, the dick be lookin' like a goose
Head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Get that dick up and runnin' when he fuck this cooch
Covered in all my cum, the dick be lookin' like a goose

[Verse 3: cupcakKe]
Cut the dick off, took it home with me
'Cause any dick that long, it belong with me
This pussy iconic, yeah it moan with me
Put your finger in the hole, come bowl with me
Let me brush your pubic hairs while I suck on your cock
Get all the cum out your dick, make it go out-of-stock
Turn it into a Yeezy shirt when you rip off my top
My box already small, it don't need to be cropped
Turn double-dutch with yo' balls while I'm jumpin' on your dick
Tell your grandma sew my pussy, since you split open my clit
Coochie guaranteed to put you to sleep so damn soon
Ridin' on that dick, I'm readin' Goodnight Moon
Vending machine, vending machine
Can't eat it until there's money between, money between
This pussy is a vendin' machine, vendin' machine
Can't eat it until there's money between, money between

[Bridge: cupcakKe]
Vendin' machine, vendin' machine (oh yeah)
Vendin' machine, vendin' machine (oh yeah)
Can't eat it until there's money between, money between
This pussy is a vendin' machine, vendin' machine

[Outro: Mozart's Sister]
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
