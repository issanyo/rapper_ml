[Verse 1: Big Momma]
Pigeon toed, extra meat around the hips
Got this nigga's mind going 'cause the size of my lips
Put him on it once now I gotta book him trips
Give me five star meals, Steph Curry with the shrimp
Vacation in Belize sippin' bubbly
And you know we chainsmoking, sittin' casually
Motherfuckers in their feelings, don't be bad to me
'Cause Momma's throat skills keep a nigga close to me, uh
Momma know what the boys want, uh
Bring him to me I can give him what he need
Head game crucial like he sinking in the sea
Bitches blowing up his phone, he be missing for a week
That's me in a GT Benz crimson blue
Mean mugging all you hoes when I'm coming through
Dominating any bitch coming in my avenue
But why them hoes really mad 'cause them hoes is through, uh
Meanwhile they tryna get all in my gut
He wanna play a nigga, he just wanna bust a nut
I ain't fucking with you if that thing uncut
'Lil niggas better back up before I act up
Get your racks up
Niggas, 'cause y'all hoes is pussies
How the fuck you tryna play me 'cause the frame is squishy
Lame niggas wanna lay up when their pockets empty
Motherfucker get ghost, adios, you'll miss me, uh

[Chorus: Big Momma]
This for the girls with extra meat around limbs
Belly hang low, a couple of inches on the hem
Niggas that be yelling "No fats, no femmes"
But it's quiet as is kept, girl, you don't need him (no fats, no femmes)
This for the girls with extra meat around limbs
Belly hang low, a couple of inches on the hem
Niggas that be yelling "No fats, no femmes"
But it's quiet as is kept, girl,you don't need him (no fats, femmes)

[Verse 2: Big Momma]
I'm tired of niggas tryna play me
I'm tired of niggas tryna get the mouth like it's free
I'm tired of niggas tryna steal me for my recipes
When I listen to their flows, they be sounding like me
God damn, where they at, 'cause I'm ready to bust them
Weak bars, they ain't hitting, bitch you rapping dust
I peel the skin off you chickens and you bald and plucked
[?] but you ain't sitting with us, uh

[Verse 3: CupcakKe]
Tomato and lettuce, you know thatâ€™s my fetish
On top of five dogs and you can't forget relish
They making them jealous while taking they fellas
I got dress on me like my name Kimbella
Makeup making y'all hoes look better
Face don't need beat, I can do acapella (I can)
Waistline snatched even when it ain't together
Pussy open up like a fucking love letter (uh)
Every restaurant, that's a big tab
Sit down, ooh, that's big flab
Say it like "nah" but I'm still bad
Can't come for me in a yellow cab
Bitch, I'm laid back
But let a bitch jump, I'm a maniac
I said what I said and I ain't take it back
Hop on any nigga's track and make the train collapse
I'm only stating facts
Only thing get fat shamed is this pussy
Asshole thick, I name this Snooki
The gays okay then you know I'm goodie
And I knock on the dick since I made that woody
My weight look hot, got it on lock
Confidence is the best thing I rock
Rude comments, I'm quick with the block
'Cause I ain't never 'bout to argue with a motherfucking flop

[Chorus: Big Momma]
This for the girls with extra meat around limbs
Belly hang low, a couple of inches on the hem
Niggas that be yelling "No fats, no femmes"
But it's quiet as is kept, girl, you don't need him (no fats, no femmes)
This for the girls with extra meat around limbs
Belly hang low, a couple of inches on the hem
Niggas that be yelling "No fats, no femmes"
But it's quiet as is kept, girl,you don't need him (no fats, femmes)
This for the girls with extra meat around limbs
Belly hang low, a couple of inches on the hem
Niggas that be yelling "No fats, no femmes"
But it's quiet as is kept, girl, you don't need him (no fats, no femmes)
This for the girls with extra meat around limbs
Belly hang low, a couple of inches on the hem
Niggas that be yelling "No fats, no femmes"
But it's quiet as is kept, girl,you don't need him (no fats, femmes)
