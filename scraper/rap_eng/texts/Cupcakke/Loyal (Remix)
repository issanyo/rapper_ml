[Intro]
Its ya girl Cupcakke

[Verse 1]
All a bitch have to do is walk by
And I caught that little rich nigga eye
Jiggle jiggle on that ass he saw
Nipple nipples he can lick without a bra
Make that nigga forget he had a bitch (uh)
Perky titties and wet pussy he lick
Niggas chase anything they can get
It could be a man with no dick, but
When a thick bitch want you
I bet I make that nigga dump on you
Nigga you ain't gotta stunt I own you
Because the way I puts it on you

[Hook]
(Chris: When a rich nigga want you)
When a thick bitch want you
(Chris:And yo nigga can't do nothing for you)
And your girl don't really puts it on you
(Chris:These hoes ain't loyal)
Stop lying yall niggas ain't loyal
(Chris:These hoes ain't loyal)

[Verse 2]
Yall niggas ain't loyal yall niggas a fold like some foil
Rich niggas who born into royal
They break hearts they fuck around and destroy you
But I could use those Louis, they really coming they coming in handy
Sit my pussy on your lips like candy
He tryna see a thick bitch without her panties
He tryna spend a couple figures get flashy
Because his bitch at home ain't really this nasty
So we ain't gotta talk about being loyal
Because that nigga clearly ain't for you

[Hook]

[Outro]
Broke bitches and broke niggas they dont mix
Broke bitches and broke niggas they dont mix
Broke bitches and broke niggas they dont mix
These hoes a suck ya dick for a pair of kicks (x3)

[Hook]
