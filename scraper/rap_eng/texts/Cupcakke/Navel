[Verse 1]
Let it bang on a hoe, big toy, G.I. Joe
You can't fuck, that's a no, I am picky, afro (I got options)
Bank on tic-tac-toe, all you see is 0, 0, 0's
Bitch, you know I'm in my glow
Eat up the beat, I'll take it to go (Yum yum)
I don't answer the phone, bitch, run me a letter
Slide to my crib if you got me some cheddar
His blood spill when I shot the Beretta
I had to walk home in an inside-out sweater
I don't let shit fly by, I just make souls fly high
Kill him with his tie, kill him with his tie
Kill him with his tie, that's tie-dye

[Chorus]
Pass that money 'round like hot potato (yeah)
Whole circle got bread like a bagel (yeah)
Throw hands to his face like a facial (yeah)
That bullet hole look like a navel (oh yeah)
Pass that money 'round like hot potato (yeah)
Whole circle got bread like a bagel (yeah)
Throw hands to his face like a facial (oh yeah)
That bullet hole look like a navel (oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
Big money, feeling pumpy, adios, can't get shit from me
Five meals in my tummy equals up to your rent money (Add it up)
Don't let your nigga play you like he's Stevie
He do a triple take when he see me
I might just talk to him real briefly
Tell him to drop you off then come eat me
That's if you like it or not (Not)
I'm a business woman off top (Off top)
And I don't Facebook 'cause my face booked on every fuckin' flyer that drop (That's knowledge)
This that knock, knock, who's there?
Front porch, front porch, who?
Bitch, if you don't answer this door right now
Bullets 'bout to come through, ha
Play if you want, today I got time
I wouldn't even phone even if I was blind
Who said I can't rap? That lil' bitch lyin' (Cut it out)
I'm bringing that heat like the clothes is dryin'
So stop it, bitches ain't on my profit
I'm a messy bitch, so watch it
I'ma spill the tea and not mop it (Hell nah)
Bitch mean muggin', wearing pony tails so I'm guessin' she a bum dummy (What you wanna do?)
So I beat her ass and took the rubber band like, "I need that for my money" (Gimme that)
Cone head bitch, 'bout to be missing toppings
Take off her head like a discount shoppin'
Come to the block, don't put me on no block list
With his dread head schemin', that's a motherfuckin' plot twist

[Chorus]
Pass that money 'round like hot potato (yeah)
Whole circle got bread like a bagel (yeah)
Throw hands to his face like a facial (yeah)
That bullet hole look like a navel (oh yeah)
Pass that money 'round like hot potato (yeah)
Whole circle got bread like a bagel (yeah)
Throw hands to his face like a facial (oh yeah)
That bullet hole look like a navel (oh yeah)
