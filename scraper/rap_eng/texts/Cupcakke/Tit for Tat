[Intro]
Where you been at ? Who you been with? You lying

[Verse 1]
Look fam do you love me or not?
We stay fussing and fucking but is yo hoes getting dropped?
This is getting more unhealthy than junk (than junk)
Call 99 times and he ain't pick up once
Descending to the rain we falling straight down the drain
Checking through his phone it be them numbers with no names
What the fuck, why you tryna get up?
Wasn't you just thirsty for that bitch
I'm guessing you lost the hiccup all I'm asking for is closure
To find another me you might need a four leaf clover
I could name a lot of shit that you lack
But I got niggas in the back that want me with them like Rosa

[Hook]
You keep telling me this and that
I'm knowing you hitting that
Shame we can't have a chat without the tit for tat
Try to talk it out but you end up walking out
I'm overwhelmed and over him without a doubt

Telling me this and that
I'm knowing you hitting that
Shame we can't have a chat without the tit for tat
Try to talk it out but you end up walking out
I'm overwhelmed and over him without a doubt

[Verse 2]
God damn, back to back messages this was more than spam?
Pathetic all I see is synthetic hair shed all in my bed
That nigga dead when I see him he gone need a medic
Together forever until one of us have a funeral
Stupid ass me I should of knew it wasn't mutual
Will the cheating ever stop
Temptation, allegation said she hate it until she send me screenshots

[Hook]
You keep telling me this and that
I'm knowing you hitting that
Shame we can't have a chat without the tit for tat
Try to talk it out but you end up walking out
I'm overwhelmed and over him without a doubt

Telling me this and that
I'm knowing you hitting that
Shame we can't have a chat without the tit for tat
Try to talk it out but you end up walking out
I'm overwhelmed and over him without a doubt
