[Intro]
This shit crazy
Look

[Verse 1]
Bean bag full of shots different from a bag of Skittles
If shit get bumpy bust it in yo face like a fucking pimple
I need God to answer more prayers so I'm headed to the temple
Bitches sit around on they ass like they done failed cripple
Every convo got a time limit
Cause I dont like to put my mind in it
I don't sympathize with nobody guys
Look me in my eyes and they traumatized
A nigga can't even make me blush
Cause I get more play than Toys R Us
Lay her body out like thin crust so we can chop it up with no Pizza Hut
Waste time on a amateur, give him 31 shots no calendar
I bet he kick back when he heat it make a nigga jump like a cheerleader
Feel it like Peter pushing bitches to the side like Amina
Since I'm the color of a pork and bean
I don't wanna see no cops on the scene
Cause shit could get terrible
So when I move a body or I do a robbery I'm careful
Stained quick you ain't getting shit, money ain't shareable
So don't try to walk a day in my shoes, he-hell naw they ain't wearable

[Hook]
Might need me a church niggas finna get hurt
Dig deep in that dirt for that body you search
For that money I search  for that body they search
For that money I search for that body they search
Might need me a church niggas finna get hurt
Dig deep in that dirt for that body you search
For that money I search  for that body they search
For that money I search for that body they search

I'm a search search search search
I'm a search search search search
I'm a search search search search
For that money I search for that body they search

[Verse 2]
Shorty I can't even save ya, like I ran out of data
Bitch I'm typing up yo will, gone say bye to Jada
Got guns in the backseat bigger than an alligator
If I draw the chopper on you it's only out to erase you
Let me show you a sample, aim at yo head
Make it bubble like shampoo
Money ain't coming slow-mo, if it cost to be the boss
Then nigga what's the total?
Niggas say they global, they not even mobile
We can't even social ,got him getting vocal
I'm just on a move half the ones who ain't got shit
Got hella shit to prove (bitches)
Bitches still broke if you getting money and them bills due
Holla at my mans fo' he talk them bands cause I'm not a fool
Big family I got to feed more than the Huxtables
So when you see me in yo sight
Bets believe I'm finna hustle you
Motherfuckers out here owe me money thinking they untouchable
If she don't meet me with my cheese
I'm a crack her that's a Lunchable

[Hook]
Might need me a church niggas finna get hurt
Dig deep in that dirt for that body you search
For that money I search  for that body they search
For that money I search for that body they search
Might need me a church niggas finna get hurt
Dig deep in that dirt for that body you search
For that money I search  for that body they search
For that money I search for that body they search
