[Intro: Uma Kompton]
Be my sugar daddy, give me what I want
Cocaine and diamonds, pull up 'round the front
Get down on your knees bitch, give me what I need
Singing in the moonlight, high on speed
We are the bad kids, come and follow me
Dancing in the moonlight, wild and free
Be my sugar daddy, give me what I want
Cocaine and diamonds, pull up 'round the front

[Chorus: Uma Kompton]
We are the bad kids, come and follow me
Dancing in the moonlight, wild and free
Be my sugar daddy, give me what I want
Cocaine and diamonds, pull up 'round the front
Daddy never told me how life would be
Praying in the moonlight, down on my knees
This time tomorrow, guess where I'll be?
Down in the valley, swinging from that old oak tree

[Verse 1: Uma Kompton]
We danced our youth in New York City
Paradise found, so proud and pretty
We lived for love and lust and beauty
Pleasure: then, our only duty
Oceans rise and armies fall
Just a bad bitch who wants it all
We thought ourselves eternal then
Our glory sealed by God's own pen

[Pre-Chorus: Uma Kompton]
I'm a bad bitch and you know it
I'm a sad bitch, but I don't show it
Tiffany tear drops are all you'll see
The only tears you'll see on me

[Chorus: Uma Kompton]
We are the bad kids, come and follow me
Dancing in the moonlight, wild and free
Be my sugar daddy, give me what I want
Cocaine and diamonds, pull up 'round the front
Daddy never told me how life would be
Praying in the moonlight, down on my knees
This time tomorrow, guess where I'll be?
Down in the valley, swinging from that old oak tree

[Verse 2: CupcakKe]
Yo, yo, look
Bitch I'm badder than kids not coming home
Such a boss, need a secondary to answer my phone
This pussy need air so my thongs is crotchless
I'm a bad kid, you might not wanna adopt this
Tryna stay away from the squares, no floor tiles
Now my ex wanna stay together like a unibrow
Cause I got skin, soft tender meat like hamhocks
My life's a movie, welcome to Redbox, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Uma Kompton]
I'm a bad bitch and you know it
I'm a sad bitch, but I don't show it
Tiffany tear drops are all you'll see
The only tears you'll see on me

[Chorus: Uma Kompton]
We are the bad kids, come and follow me
Dancing in the moonlight, wild and free
Be my sugar daddy, give me what I want
Cocaine and diamonds, pull up 'round the front
Daddy never told me how life would be
Praying in the moonlight, down on my knees
This time tomorrow, guess where I'll be?
Down in the valley, swinging from that old oak tree

[Post-Chorus: Uma Kompton]
Meet me down in the Boondocks, daddy
Meet me down in the Boondocks, daddy
Meet me down in the Boondocks, daddy
Meet me down in the--

[Bridge: Uma Kompton]
When all is dead and done
We're gonna go have some fun
Tequila shots and a bottle of rum
I'm done
We're bad kids on the run
Pounding the streets in the summer heat
That's how it is done

[Chorus 2: Uma Kompton]
Didn't mean to shoot him, an accident you see
I didn't mean to hurt him, no, not me
This time tomorrow you know where I'll be
Down in the valley, swinging from the old oak tree
We are the bad kids, come and follow me
Swinging in the moonlight, wild and free
Sorry Mr. Officer, I swear it wasn't me
Never seen that gun before, innocence I plead

[Pre-Chorus: Uma Kompton]
I'm a bad bitch and you know it
I'm a sad bitch, but I don't show it
Tiffany tear drops are all you'll see
The only tears you'll see on me
