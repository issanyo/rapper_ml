What?

I wanna eat your man pussy
See what it tastes like
Does it satisfy my whole life?
Ain't that right?
I'm mad tight right now
Like you can't fight me now
I won't mind if you only do me backstage
If I got you I'm straight

I don't mess with love I don't mess with hate
I don't fucking care how you play
I don't know about you but I'm on fire
You failed me once and you fail me again
Gonna find someone better who really can
Understand the complexity of my savior

Do you feel it babe?
Running down your skin
Only to become nothing once again
Only to become nothing once again
Do you feel it babe?
Running down your skin
Does it make you wanna do bad things?

CupcakKe:
Sexual feelings on my mind
Pussy give that dick some shine
He whacking me from behind
I feel it up in my spine
Since I give you a boner
That don't make you the owner
Dick in my mouth just like a cigar
Smoke it out like a stoner
Want you to do what I say
Come rub me down like some clay
You know I fuck with the gays
Dicking they booty all day
Tie me up like a ribbon
I got no fucks given
Let you fuck me in every room
Now that's showing me how you living
