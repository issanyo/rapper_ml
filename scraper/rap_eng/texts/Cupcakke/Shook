[Intro]
These niggas don't want it
These niggas don't want it
I'm a give em that look

[Verse 1]
You pick yo hittas from the block
I pick my niggas outta  jail
Them killers who splash niggas and got the highest bail
One morning they locked up the next day they out they cell
Snatch the keys out the police pocket and dare they tell
I'm from the block where anything you need is in stock
From either rapping in the booth or selling cocaine or rocks
Gotta get it one way or another I can't stop
I even rob niggas who be on the train selling socks
I got dreadhead niggas who thirsty to pull the trigger
Take your cheese like a picture to make it a little clearer
If you think its sweet we gone smack you until you bitter
I push a lot of fucking buttons it make drug dealers sick
Cause if I deal the shit, cut the shit, then nigga its my shit
You fuck with  me, and I'm the boss
Then niggas just better quit
Outside  , I'm outside like Bernie Mac who you wit ?
Putting money on yo head that's a auction
Drag a nigga from Stony Island to Halstead
Get out of line you getting flipped like you a dolphin
I put you underground without a fucking coffin
I'll bust a nigga eye till its swole
I'm a bring that heat when it's cold
I blow the Mac-10 thru yo center
It'll make you listen like Linda

[Chorus]
You don't wanna , you don't wanna , you don't wanna get that ass smoked
You don't wanna  , you don't wanna, you don't wanna get yo life took
I ain't even coming ten deep ,and these niggas, these niggas, these niggas be shook
I busted 30 shots, do I need to motherfuck to let you know that I'm a motherfuckin , motherfuckin' crook

You don't wanna , you don't wanna , you don't wanna you don't wanna get shook
You don't wanna, you don't wanna , you don't wanna you don't wanna get shook
I ain't even coming ten deep , and these niggas, these niggas, these niggas be shook
I busted 30 shots, do I need to motherfuck to let you know that I'm a motherfuckin , motherfuckin' crook

[Verse 2]
Run yo lips, leave the clip , hop in the whip then I dip
Leave no money behind nigga this is not a tip
I do what I want and I take what I want
Cause nigga I'm paying my taxes
Not talking Brad Pitt but I be on my fit
I'm a shoot when I hit every action
I'm a be ready to blow yo whole squad gotta go
I'm a take away them then take away you
I'm a be doing subtraction I'ma take away all yo niggas
Yeah I'ma be doing subtraction
And if they try to make it out the jam I'm a hit they ass with a bracket
My hands doing all the action, Yo fuck nigga whats cracking?
Crack his fucking skull, leave it fractured
Chiraq get packed like noodles, I'm a pit you a motherfuckin' poodle
I keep bills with me like Rudy military and Call of Duty
You only clapping up in that church but I'm clapping bitches under dirt
Put yo nigga face up on a shirt like a porn bitch I'm gone squirt
(Uh) Click- clack -pow nigga that's the sound
My bullets like a hoe bet my bullets gone get around
His last word "ouch" shots going out
Innocent bystanders better take another route
Chopper on popper it's a bag, drop it then kidnap them Rugrats
That 40 make 40 dem jump back
I might go to jail but fuck that!

[Chorus]
