I dont give a fuck in his pants that he packing
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I dont give a fuck in his pants that he packing
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction

[Verse 1]
Homeboy get back, you don't know how to act
Nah you can't get a kiss yo breath smell like the pack
No I do not want a set of keys
Little ass boy go to Chuck E Cheese
I ain't tryna do no good deed
So I ain't rolling up no nigga weed
To keep shit straightforward, I dont fuck for it I talk for it
How a nigga think he finna touch me
When he can't touch my aux cord?
I'ts my way or no way now he wanna make up like Olay
I was in his mouth just like Colgate
Melted on his head just like snowflakes

[Hook]
I dont give a fuck in his pants that he packing
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I dont give a fuck in his pants that he packing
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction
I'm just stacking, niggas can't be shit but a distraction

[Verse 2]
Play with him for the money like deal or no deal
Learn not to catch feelings that shit dont be real
All I know how to do is get cash I pass like the dick trash
These niggas act a ass they a make a good cast
Motherfuckers always lying (lying bitch)
Shorty keep two sides on the side and I ain't talking Gemini's
Yeah, he a hoe fosho' , but that ain't gone slow my dough
Fuck a ex give me them O's, this ain't tic-tac-toe
