[Verse 1]
Know exactly what I want, I want that Ken and De'arra
Something that's gon' last through the summertime weather
Need me a man who gon' be down with whatever
I'm talkin' rainin' outside, give me your jacket for shelter
Gon' put it 50/50, stay if the bank is empty
Don't listen to these hoes 'cause I know how hoes envy
Quick respond to my text, the opposite of my ex
If he comin' then I'm comin' 'cause bitch we come as a set
That's for you, but all my old niggas, they were straight actin'
Had five bitches, claimin' they his sisters, like they the Braxtons
I peaked it, this nigga spent nights out on the weekend
Went from talkin' each other's heads off, to now we not speakin'
So to the next man enter my life with a plan
Please don't just  plan on being labeled my man
If I ever fall, I wanna fall on your hands
Then when I open my eyes, I wanna fall in a trance

[Chorus]
What is it worth? Is it worth not bein' solo?
How much love can you give me? What's the total?
What is it worth? Is it worth not bein' solo?
How much love can you give me? What's the total?
I'ma need a total, total, total
I'ma need a total, total, total
I'ma need a total, total, total
I'ma need a total, total, total, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know

[Verse 2]
First I gotta see if you're playin' like the showtimes
Not postin' Insta' pics into your post line
Know the game so don't try because I'm not a lame
It's not just weave in my head, I got a brain
The men I bring home gotta have some good ding-dong
Love men like King Kong if you wanted the ringtone
Not trying to pressure the man, I just want someone steady
Make my toes curlin' 'round but savin' me from a pedi
Speaking of petty I ain't watchin' Netflix and chill
I wanna go to the movies, man, show me it's real
Love a man on his hustle, then goin' to get his skills
Know when to buy Jordans and when to pay the bills
Wake up durin' the night just to get me some pop
I need that one o' clock, on the dot, his phone not on lock
This is what I deserve, give me a stand up soul mate
Someone that can brush hoes off like Colgate

[Chorus]
What is it worth? Is it worth not bein' solo?
How much love can you give me? What's the total?
What is it worth? Is it worth not bein' solo?
How much love can you give me? What's the total?
I'ma need a total, total, total
I'ma need a total, total, total
I'ma need a total, total, total
I'ma need a total, total, total, yeah

[Bridge]
What is it worth?
How much love can you give me?
What is it worth?
How much love can you give me?

[Outro]
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know
