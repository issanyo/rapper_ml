[Intro]
Unh
It's Nate Palm
Bitch
Ayy

[Verse]
When I saw that shit in the newspaper I almost spit out my drink (pffff)
The KKK left flyers down the street, it made me think (hmm)
Who the fuck, how the fuck, why the fuck, overall fuck (fuck)
Bitch it's not the 1950's where when you saw them you had to duck (boo boo boo!)
Yeah them dusty hoes be in our business, yeah them hoes need to go (bye)
In fact bigotry is probably all these motherfuckers know
Bet y'all smokin' on that cheap dank with a liiiiiittle bit of crack in it (gross)
Y'all hoes sittin' on the floor broke while everybody else rackin' it (broke)
I'll fuck up yo team, fuck up yo schemes, fuck up yo plot against minorities
Anger issues out the wazoo in these
Crabbier than all the moon halloweens
Got saggin saggin saggin asses (flab)
Never taken no history classes
Stop being a racist twatmonger or I'll break your fuckin' glasses
Most likely inbred as hell
IQ of 20 as well (dumb)
I think what they consider fancy is deadass Taco Bell (yuck)
All these hoes are old fashioned
Ending you is my passion
Cryin' rape when the nearest person to you is in Kazakhstan
Always chewin' on Skoal
Voted for Trump up at the polls (yuck)
Ay, how much do you want to bet that Steve Mnuchin bought their  souls? (his wife's a thot)
Always find you in the worst places
With angry looks on your faces
Screamin shit like "GO BACK TO YOUR GODDAMN BIRTHPLACES"

[Hook]
Racists won't be successful (nope)
Always gotta be disrespectful (nope)
So fucked up I consider them Britney '07 mental (buh)
Racists won't be successful
Always gotta be disrespectful
So fucked I consider them Britney '07 mental

[Outro]
Ay, fuck racists
That's the moral of the story
Fuck racists
Bitch
