[Intro]
Hello my sexy CupcakKe how are you doing today?
Marvelous aren't you? So why are you here today?
Oh so we can treat that bitch Sasha Go Hard ?
We got something for that ass
Get her girl

[Verse 1]
Let's get it
I know a real bony chick who come from the hood
She think she hell of buck but the chick ain't no good
I mean she got me tatted on her arm I'm important to her
She put my name in her songs I'm important to her
But I can tell this cause I ain't go no feelings
She give me so much attention I think that I'm the illest

I'm chasing money why she sittin' here chasing I.L Will
I got my fucking bullets ready I think I'm Kill Bill
She stole her name from Sasha Fierce and made it Sasha Go Hard
She got a weak flow I just call her "Sasha No Bars "
And she don't rap this bitch rhyme like the Cat in The Hat
I'm getting cheddar so she coming like a mouse or a rat

You a disrespectful hoe for puttin my  fucking name in yo mouth
You replace dicks with my name so now my name stay in yo mouth
In all yo videos she rocking Rainbow outfits
How the fuck her nigga even fucking this toothpick ?
She just a bum broad carrying a lot of views
But shes a fucking square man ,no Ice Cube
I got my shit in the back bitch get smacked and I'll deal her body parts like I deal rap
Yo fans stop rocking with you, CupcakKe stop fucking with you
Chitown don't belong to you and my niggas wanna pop at you
And it's over yeah nigga it's over better thank the 4 leaf clover
Salute my ass like a soldier she not with the shits like I told her
You bold but I'm way bolder cause I'll whack a bitch while I'm sober
Bitch I don't like yo flow, yo flow is anticipated and If I had a dick I'll let this hoe masturbate it

Cause Sasha ain't ready, Sasha ain't ready
My name hold weight man and yeah that shit heavy
Sasha ain't ready , Sasha ain't ready
My name hold weight man and yeah that shit heavy
But it's over with don't worry I do this shit short story
And yall know what's next no fucking flex
