[Intro: Dante Dcasso]
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

[Verse 1: Dante Dcasso]
Lick you on up like dolce de leche
Put it on my tongue, make you foam like a latte
Eat it in the mornin' when you know I got the munchies
Call me Cookie Monster 'cause a n*gga kinda hungry
Bomb milkshake, so I'm comin' to your yard
Won't come [?], so I'm comin' hella hard
Puttin' in work, no sleepin' on the job
Gentle doll, I'ma make you a star
Do you like it rough, tell me when you had enough
Do you like it rough, tell me when you had enough
Do you like it rough, tell me when you had enough
We could make love or we could just fuck
Like pornstars in a movie
B-I-G, 1996, so juicy
I wanna get with you, you wanna get with me
You bend that ass over, lick it like ice cream

[Chorus]
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lck you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)

[Verse 2: Dante Dcasso]
[?] a dirty pic in my inbox
Then send a Snapchat, tell me that you want the dick
Body dime piece, like a work of art
You a smooth criminal, you wanna be on top
Your hormones racing at the speed of light
But like a Ziploc bag, baby, keep it tight
Swipe to the right then I'm comin' over tonight
Double tap, show me that you wanna fuck tonight
12 AM, I'm on my way to the club
And after 2, 3 bottles, I'll be ready to fuck
Keep the lights on so I know that you're home
Leave the door unlocked, yes, turn me on
Booty so sweet like an R&B song
Sex in the mornin', I wanna get it on
Make a video on my 7 Plus phone
We could take a risk because my pullout game strong

[Chorus]
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lck you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)

[Verse 3: CupcakKe]
If you know me, you know how the story go
Cum lookin' like the middle of a Oreo
Sit back, relax, I got way more to show
Givin' signs I'm a whore, oops, that's a horoscope/whore-oscope
Wake and bake, on your face I dominate
Things we do tonight, we won't make it to Heaven Gate
I think he nervous, knowin' that we 'bout to get litty
'Cause he said he gotta pee first, just like P. Diddy
I'm 'bout to lick that motherfucker, lick it just like a sucker
And it's Friday so I'm turnt like Chris Tucker
Lest I use a rubber, pipe me like a plumber
Brush your teeth before you eat, your breath be hot as the summer
Body full of oil, look like chicken and grease
Two fingers in this pussy like he throwin' up peace
Sleepin' on the couch 'cause there's cum on the sheets
Dick so damn deep it's playin' Hide and Go Seek
Let's get it

[Verse 4: Dante Dcasso]
[?] what's up
Can a n*gga just keep in touch
Can I sip on you like [?]
Count 2, 3 and I'ma bust this nut
Sex kittens only, no cougars allowed
[?] you got some loud
Because all we like to do is smoke a blunt
Because all we like to do is smoke and fuck

[Chorus]
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lck you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)
Li-Li-Lick you (la, la, la, la)
I just wanna li-li-lick you (la, la, la, la)

[Outro]
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
