Vs 1:
I just can’t wait to get you alone
So wet so sweet so out of control
You cross the lines that’s cut in your dress
And I just need to see that hair in a mess

Hook:
I don’t wanna spend the night alone
Take me in your undertow
Treat me like a true love would
It feels so good to know

Vs 2:
I’ll hold you down give you what you deserve
Deep breath and hold til you come back to Earth
You cross the heart that you’ve sworn to protect
(and hope to die)
But I can feel your blood pump with my hand on your neck

Hook:
I don’t wanna spend the night alone
Take me in your undertow
Close my eyes and hold me down
I’m ready now to go

Vs 3 (CupcakKe):
Love me love me love me love me love me
That's all I ask for is you to love me
And then night get dirty little muddy
And when I'm down push me harder than a buggy
And to keep it real make sure we solid
That real trust when I'm around you leave ya wallet
And when we argue baby let's stay on topic
Cuz I can be a smartass no college
I'm trippin' and trippin' with no destination
I dress for the dick it's a special occasion
Come work on this pussy like you in the maintenance
The room smell like sex I might make it a fragrance
(oh yeah)
Ball in your court, take a shot
Don't miss
Tongue out, high heels
Now I'm feelin' like KISS
I'm prepared when I see that front door lock
We fuckin' til my body stiffer than a robot
