[Verse 1]
Babies killing babies
People starving in Haiti
Men nutting in women then disappear for the baby
Promoters acting shady, a bunch of em no Brady
Jail full of our brothers, 'cause fathers was way too lazy
Real struggle been through the trenches
You haven't lived my life
Eat half the can good in the morning
Then eat the other half at night
They don't know about the fighting, they just know 100 likes
I'm just tryna find the light, but this tunnel not too bright
Big money with me, but don't shop at Givenchy
I do not support them stores
Remember times I ain't have a dime
Me and best friend sharing clothes
That's just how the shit go
I don't stop, I just go
All I thought was get it either way
Never cared if I was called a hoe, that was irrelevant
All got skeletons
Feelings not delicate, so just settle it
Brought out the ghetto, now tryna be elegant
Dropped out, but the streets made me intelligent
I done seen it all, so what's new?
Been dogged out my whole life, like Snoop
Niggas love lies, but they hate the truth
I'm only at peace when I'm in the booth
I don't trust none on my Moms
Niggas life scammers and cons
Niggas claim they gotta real bond 'til one get locked up with a bond
Real preach, gotta talk to 'em like a speech
And let a hoe tell anything I say
I'm at her room door it ain't sweet
And I hate my father in the worst way
He forgot more than my birthday
He ain't did shit since the first day
Bird nigga let him chirp away
It's hella times we done got kicked out
Went from the box from living in a big house
Can't forget the days tryna make a way
Walked in the corner store for a discount

[Hook]
We was out there scrapping up quarters
Backpack on the streets, like Dora
Don't look down on others that's shorter
Had mo tears than we had water
We was out there scrapping up quarters
Backpack on the streets, like Dora
Don't look down on others that's shorter
Had mo tears than we had water

[Verse 2]
What you know about not washing clothes in months?
Or no tissue on the rod if your nose will run?
No pot to shit in, so you hold the dump
The problems we 'bout to face is the goal for Trump
It's over, I ain't talking breakup man
Why every time I need something phone breakup man?
Why loved ones in the ground won't wake up man?
'Cause niggas gang, gang, gang
They wanna shake up hands
That ain't 'bout to make you look cooler
Y'all making mo mistakes than bloopers
Motherfuckers gotta think about they future
These niggas perpetrators like Fuschia
You know me I ain't holding shit in
Real fucked up world that we live in
That twenty dollars for her baby milk
She done took that shit and done went and got a fill in
Becomes repeatable, unbelievable
Now she ain't got custody
I hate it when people so agreeable
Shorty cut it with the fuckery
Dark skin or light skin, you still African-American
Society got y'all fucked up, y'all out here comparing skin
It's a fucking shame ain't shit change
We ain't representing like we should
'Cause it still remain gotta tuck yo chain
When you step a foot up in the hood (or get robbed)
Make a way if you could, make sure yo fam good
Ain't have a door to knock on when I needed help
Just had hope knocking on wood
Old folks intimidated by the generation
'Cause these youngins don't follow obligations
Job application need pronounciation it was too much slang in the conversation
Gotta get professional on the spot, that one shot is all you really got
No Dalmatian fuck one house, I'm tryna own 101 spots
