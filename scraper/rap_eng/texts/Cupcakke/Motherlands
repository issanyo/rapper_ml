Colder than winter wonderland drop him 12 feet under man
Stretch his ass like a rubber band, I'll send his ass to the motherlands
Colder than winter wonderland drop him 12 feet under man
Stretch his ass like a rubber band, I'll send his ass to the motherlands

To the motherlands, to the motherlands
Stretch his ass like a rubber band, I'll send his ass to the motherlands
To the motherlands, to the motherlands
Stretch his ass like a rubber band, I'll send his ass to the motherlands

[Verse 1]
Funny niggas, Jim Carey
Chase the money, Tom & Jerry
Hella bitches want beef but it get scary at my deli
I'll ride around throw my set-up I ain't never finna let up
Tell you once to shut up next I pin my hair up
If yo money big than I'm cool with you
Otherwise what I'm a do with you?
Bitch you talking to a animal and I'm not talking Dr. Dolittle
We draw so much money at the bank
I done made the cashier faint
I will smack yo ass so quick no love taps or no spanks
Quick thoughts its a warning do a hit & run in my foreign
Have yo body rolling off the fucking hill
Like yo first name was Lauryn
My niggas shaking up no salt shakers
I'll hang her up , don't call later
Motherfuckers don't get the picture
So let me save this shit  as yo wallpaper
Hear that ding-ding got my ching-ching
Take my nails off with my bling bling
Cause I'm a whack his ass with that big thing
He gone feel this shit in his ding-a-ling
Don't tell man this hell man
No talking bitch I'm not a salesman
I'll step on every porch on yo block
Like what up bitch I'm the mailman

[Verse 2]
Stop staring at me damn peek-a-boo
Poke any man no Pikachu
Make it two fades couple rounds
Rearrange your face transformation Tuesday
I bring heat so they stay pressed
It ain't asthma but I take breaths
I do more and I say less cause talk is cheaper than Payless
Roll, roll, roll the dope yank that nigga by his fucking throat
Show you something for I drop you low
This is why you should have never spoke
Line bitches up put em in a row
You pass broke you really poor more numbers coming
I'm digital and I'm going in like a pigeon toe
