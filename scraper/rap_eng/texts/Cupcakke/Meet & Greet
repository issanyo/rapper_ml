[Verse 1]
Have my money, none less or I'll put a treasure in your chest
Hoes faces say they need rest
Get a maid, you bitches is a mess
I'm fly as hell so he wanna smash, got me feelin' like an insect
That .40 give a nigga choices, wanna go in your death or in debt
Man, I'm rollin' and I'm loaded, shotgun with me, bitch, I tote it
It's so big, two people hold it, slap your casket with some roses (Good night)
Weak bitches tryna tear me down but I never frown 'cause I'm still there (I'm here)
Niggas roll up on the wrong one,they gon' roll out in a wheelchair
That's all I know, I gotta go, business cannot be runnin' slow (The money)
Takin' straight L's, that's a no no, that's a lame nigga on the honor roll
Anyone can get popped in the mouth, ain't talkin' 'bout soda, soda (Nah)
Blackout with your blood leakin', that shit lookin' like Coca-Cola (Wow)
All you 'bout to see is yellow tape so I shoulda came in a taxi (Skrrt)
Put the MAC to a bitch face like a bitch lips look chappy
Only time a bitch can tell me "have a seat" is if I'm on the Ellen Show (That's it)
Otherwise, meet my chopper, bitch same size as a telescope (What's up?)

[Chorus]
Meet and greet (meet and greet), meet and greet (meet and greet)
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep
Meet and greet (meet and greet), meet and greet (meet and greet)
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep

[Verse 2]
Shawty can't teach me shit, I'm like, "Hell naw, I been expelled"
No joke, these niggas broke, they'd fuck around and rob a wishin' well
I won't put it past none (none), what niggas do for the funds (funds)
You wearin' Air Forces to the club, nigga?
That's a sign you 'bout to throw ones (broke ass!)
Say what I want, I'm no coward, bitch I still pee in the shower
I make 10K in an hour, he callin' me baby like powder
Double it, double it, double it, money bag so heavy, I double it (Money)
Loudest bitches on the internet be the ones mumblin' when they in public (They itchin')
Threats on the net, do you really think I fear that?
Dirty-ass bitch, wax her pussy with her earwax (Eww)
C'mon my nigga, you gotta be stupid if you really think I'm not sittin' on ready
They know I'm hot, and I'm stirrin' a pot
They might fuck around, think that I'm makin' spaghetti
Wake up, no makeup and I still look like I'm worth gold (Gorgeous)
You wake up, y'all break up 'cause you Annabelle with no makeup on (Ugly bitch)
That's not a good look, bitch get lost, 6 figures, still takin' off
Shoot until I see tomato sauce
Sword through your body, that's a cross

[Chorus]
Meet and greet (meet and greet), meet and greet (meet and greet)
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep
Meet and greet (meet and greet), meet and greet (meet and greet)
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep
Meet and greet (meet and greet), meet and greet (meet and greet)
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep
Meet and greet (meet and greet), meet and greet (meet and greet)
Chop a freak, meet a bitch, put her to sleep

[Outro]
Cho-cho-chop a freak
Cho-cho-chop a freak
