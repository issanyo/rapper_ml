[Pre-Hook: Kazzie]
Word, word
I wanna see ass and titties
Wanna see ass and titties (on God)
She got them ass and titties (on God)
I'm good for ass and titties (on God)
I wanna see ass and titties, ah
Looking for ass and titties, titties

[Hook: Kazzie]
You want a tip?
Then you gotta strip
I wanna see ass and titties
You know what it is
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties, ass and titties
What happens in the strip club
It stays in the strip club
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties

[Verse 1: Kazzie]
Wanna see ass and titties
When I'm in Atlanta at Magic City (City)
You want a bag? It's plenty
And girl you so bad you can pass for Nicki
She bouncing that ass, I'm throwing this cash
Somebody just passed a Henny
When we left the club, she was giving me brain
And I almost crashed the Bentley
In the strip club where I live
Every Sunday I'm at LIV
Then on a Monday it's K.O.D
Them bitches know what it is
Bust it open, do a split
I might just marry the bitch
I might take care of the bitch
I might take care of the wrist

[Hook: Kazzie]
You want a tip?
Then you gotta strip
I wanna see ass and titties
You know what it is
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties, ass and titties
What happens in the strip club
It stays in the strip club
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties
I wanna see ass and titties

[Verse 2: CupcakKe]
Only how you see it, if you about to eat it
This some thick meat, tell me you ain't vegan
Meat juicy, it don't even need no season
On his knees like he believe in Jesus
Yeah, I'm so nasty (uh)
The boys on me like Cassie (uh)
Bag heavy like the trash be (uh)
Suck it 'til my throat raspy (uh)
Shake it like I need comission (woo)
Everyday a new position (fuck me)
Giving me dick, give me kisses (mwah)
Fingers where I like doing dishes (uh)
You wanna see ass and titties? (yeah)
I gotta see cash and plenty (ching-ching)
Tell your bitch I ain't friendly (ooh)
Give 'em more shade than Fendy

[Outro: Kazzie]
You want a tip?
Then you gotta strip
I wanna see ass and titties
You know what it is
What happens in the strip club
It stays in the strip club
