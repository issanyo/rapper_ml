Me and my dawgs don't copy the past
We make money, cash money, jumping the past
They say am the form so am having a blast
From Maimi to Malaysia, then in Naija mo fe loki eyan ni

Everybody mo pe eja lo wa ninu geisha
And those wey dey pose, dey already know
Blessing dey follow anywhere we go
We getting the diamond, getting the gold
Act like fire when it gets real cold
As some of my friends don start to dey hate
I'm only Tell why you dey wait
I heard about the picture thing you dey paste
No le le, no le le

Now them say I boast o, o nana
Cos I'm doing my thing everyday I am getting close o

Shit, check out the way we dey shine, we dey shine
You think say na beans, go rub vaseline
No time to dey shy, to dey shy
If I no dey omo grind na sin
Aeroplane no get bus-stop
As we dey work hard, we dey get boxed up
I no even dull when I get one top
Talk less of now when I don chop up
Me and group stealing big bills
We don't drove around if it is not big wheels
More money we piling them up
See our shoulders we carry them up
When we broke you no dey
When we dey trek go shows, you no dey
You no send us when packaging no dey
If you want my service, my guy you go pay
You go pay

Now them say I boast o, o nana
Cos I'm doing my thing everyday I am getting close o
O nana
They love me more the time when I dey roast, o nana
Now we getting money every day from coast to coast o, o nana
Coast to coast o

Olorun mi ose iyanu re
