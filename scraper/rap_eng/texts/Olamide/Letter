Hey son wassup, this is your dad
Am writing this to motivate you whenever you are down
Just remember my story and things that people told me
Nine mili-mitre to my head couldn't hold me
Back from the facts and all the things that I believed in
Now I treat a special woman, the womb I lived in
How I used to go go, how I used to go get
How I used to go to shows with no cash in my pocket
Am talking 08, 09, O10, O11
For every level there's a different devil
I sold my soul to the game just to dine with the devil
I hope I make heaven
And sometimes, I don't even think about the fact that my daddy is a driver and my hood is ladilac
I just grind like am crazy like a maniac
To make my daddy proud and get all the things my lady lacks

So ti ye e, bose'nlo gan gan mo so fun e yen

I know you wanna ball, you wanna flex, o den tun fe yo p
And sometimes you wanna be just like me
Exactly, maybe not too much maybe slightly
And sometimes you wanna do the things that I did
Maybe even better, maybe you wanna be greater
You must into consideration the circumstances
Where you at, who you loving who you stand with
You must be prepared for every chance you see
Every opportunity, knock dem out for me like Ali
Be a soldier, build yourself
Elevate your brothers when you elevating yourself
Go to war with your brothers and protect all your sisters
Ask your mama for her blessings let no one compete with her

So ti ye e, bose'nlo gan gan mo so fun e yen

Keep your eyes on the price future lowa lokan

I love you, my love to all the little kids out there
I pray may you days be long, your money be long
When its time to face your fears may you be strong
May you never dwell in failure when you do something wrong
May you never lack the wisdom to multiply and sustain all that you work and pray for
