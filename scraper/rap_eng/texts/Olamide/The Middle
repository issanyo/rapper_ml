Ma nigga, just dey your lane
No send anybody ma nigga
Just dey do your thing, no mind them
They go talk anyhow, they go dey do anyhow
But na you get yourself, you understand?
Focus, hustle

[Hook: IJ & Olamide]
Shebi you no think say I be bad guy
But me I know say I be bad guy

But I get niggas wey dey feel me

Bad guy, bere lowo sumbo

[Verse 1: M.I Abaga]
Nothing mankind no go ever see
Even Jesus Christ hated by the pharisees
Critics go con-go like the DRC
I just dey my lane like the BRT
That’s why they hating on me, but I stay very calm
Cos I dey tink am like De Rica
See ma nigga for Bariga and Gbagada
If it’s M Abaga brother, dem dey feel me like Jerry Can
Who be best rapper, omo it all depends
I’m not the one to ask, ask number two to ten
And if you no dey rap no ever make rap
Because Cat sabi swim, that no mean say e be Catfish
If you mention M for any top ten, we gon have a problem
We gon have a talk men
I might be the greatest you’ll ever see
We can agree to disagree, leave am for middle let it be nigga

[Hook: IJ, Olamide]
Shebi you no think say I be bad guy
But me I know say I be bad guy
Make we just leave am for middle
Just leave am for middle
You and your niggas no dey feel me
But I get niggas wey dey feel me
Make we just leave am for middle
Just leave am for middle

Baddo! won lon beef me, e fi won le mon bo
Lala to roke, Ile lon bo
Won Lon Beef Me, E Fi Won Le, Mon Bo
Lala to roke, Ile lon bo
Bere mi, everyday mon ball
Bad guy, bere lowo sumbo
Bere mi, everyday mon ball
Bad  guy, bere lowo sumbo

[Verse 2: Olamide]
Competition si, opposition si

Won form bad guy, ammunition si
Awa’n flow so easy, awon fi isan si

Yea, father Abraham had many sons
But bread winner la wa, so fun won kan gbenu soun
Awon form superstar, awon shine bi sun
Awon shey ti animal to escape ninu museum
So ori buruku o ba yin ja, eyin ati ta le jon ja?
Emi ekun bi ti abija, were to ni manager
You and your crew in the club e dabi Power Ranger
Won de da were yin mo leko, won damo ni Bodija
Eyin omode yi man be e efe blow bi banger

Awon temi won komi je oh, awon baby won je mi je oh

[Verse4: M.I Abaga]
Omo na dem know, na so the thing go
It’s why I got to move fast, never think slow
Cos hate is so deep, so even when I sleep
I no dey close eye, last last na chinco
Since '07 I've been spitting fire fam
Bars, complex, the concept's me diagram
I’m the textbook, the rest live to war me
Do it really surely for the fans who really adore me

Shawty leave me as you see me, leave me how you see me
Abi I no go make am if you say you no go feel me?
Six years running I’m the best rapper ever living
Respect to those before me, I’m the best that ever did it
But make I just dey my middle
Make dem still dey talk say M.I no ssabi riddle
Frying pan know say him black pass kettle
But who dey make noise pass we no go ever settle. nigga
