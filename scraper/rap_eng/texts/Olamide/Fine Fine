Intro
This one be the magic take
Dɔdɔdɔtidɔ
That’s all that’s all that’s all
We came we conquered we saw

Verse 1 [M.anifest]
Chale I'm back on my bullshit again
Ain't no ting stroke the hair on my chin
With a beard and a a beer i appear
No match no size no peer
Both of my folks got called to the bar
I'm getting booked getting calls for my bars
My future ex say she stress really bad
No Kule yet wait for the spa
She dey pay me no attention e be stra
But in my mentions with emojis smiley hearts
Chale I thought that the thought of a thot
Go mek I run, but what she sold I gladly bought
Walk in your spot like I own  that shit
You thinking rent me i'm thinking bout ownership
Kuvie this beat diɛ asuɔkyi from a mile away
Got me feeling like jigah on a tidal wave


Hook [Olamide]
You know say me I be dangbana
From UK down to Naija Ghana
Omo no clause but na we be Santa now
Dem ah chase like monkey wey see banana
If you get fuse plug your antenna
Baba the level done clear you understand me now ?
All dem, other guys no get stamina
Na we dey fuck  shit up in every arena
Timbaland boot (what)
Bottle Of henne (what)
And the red cup (what)
And some fine fine kele


Verse 2 [ M.anifest]
General dɔdɔdɔtidɔ you know the drill
My next badder than my ex e be real
Cause upgrade nkoa boys all dey feel
Murder flows hope they live a will
But who dey care about rapping about rapping
Boys dey grow doing biz be the action
I come GH they say my style not in fashion
I'm in the picture now don't care about the caption
Move in silence no dey make noise
Cause what's a tipper truck to a rolls royce
Top choice big bass I have that in-voice
You want am for your brand first get the invoice
Top billing hard work I'm so willing
Cause Hard times dey come before good living
I met a chic she said i'm with king promise
She said I'm King now she can't keep a promise...
