[Intro: Wale & Davido]
See a fine girl, ooh
I'm all the way, though
One love, one legacy
Sweet girl, you know
Let's get the paper, Folarin
Now I know I don't know you
But I do somethin' for you
Show me what it do
Then I spray somethin' for you
Sweet girl, you know
It's true

[Chorus: Wale & (Olamide)]
Fine girl, fine girl, fine girl
My fine girl, my fine girl, fine girl (bad girl you know)
Fine girl, fine girl, she's a fine girl
My fine girl, my fine girl, fine girl (fine girl, you know)
My fine girl, my fine girl, fine girl
Fine girl, fine girl, fine girl
Fine girl, fine girl, she's a fine girl (fine girl, fine girl)
Fine girl, fine girl, she's a fine girl (my girl, you know)

[Post-Chorus: Olamide]
Fine girl, to ni to ni idi nla
To ni to ni idi nla, to ni to ni idi nla
Booty yi, o nse mi ki nla
O nse mi ki nla, o nse mi ki nla`
Fine girl, to ni to ni idi nla
To ni to ni idi nla, to ni to ni idi nla
Booty yi, o nse mi ki n la
O nse mi ki n la, o nse mi ki n la

[Verse 1: Wale]
Take it now, break it down like she want it bad
Put her in the verse, then the bed, then the cab
For the boy, baby girl, go to hell and back
On my way to Lagos, seen the latest shit to hit the net
Oh yeah, got some time for ya
Nigga pick me for beef, we beef, they want suya
I got a lawyer, shawty, we in a hurry
I'm just another Yoruba nigga gettin' money
Here go another twenri

[Chorus: Wale & (Olamide)]
Fine girl, fine girl, fine girl
My fine girl, my fine girl, fine girl
Fine girl, fine girl, she's a fine girl (fine girl, fine girl)
My fine girl, my fine girl, fine girl (my girl, you know)

[Post-Chorus: Olamide]
Fine girl, to ni to ni idi nla
To ni to ni idi nla, to ni to ni idi nla
Booty yi, o nse mi ki nla
O nse mi ki nla, o nse mi ki nla`
Fine girl, to ni to ni idi nla
To ni to ni idi nla, to ni to ni idi nla
Booty yi, o nse mi ki n la
O nse mi ki n la, o nse mi ki n la

[Verse 2: Davido]
Give me the motion like a motion picture
Show your back, I wan predict your future, ayy
Give me love and I give you a return
Star Card or Visa, baby which one you want? Ayy
Saks Fifth, with a east side ting
Rodeo, with a west side ting
Bad boy on a worldwide ting, yeah, yeah
Don't forget, I'm reppin' green white green
Oh girl, you turn me to an animal
For you I throw a carnival
You whine it on me, take it easy
Shey you nor know say I get stamina
Oh baby, come over anytime you want
Do way you whine your body bust my medulla
She be fine girl, she be fine girl, ayy
And this one nor be regular

[Chorus: Wale & (Olamide)]
Fine girl, fine girl, fine girl
My fine girl, my fine girl, fine girl
Fine girl, fine girl, she's a fine girl (fine girl, fine girl)
My fine girl, my fine girl, fine girl (my girl, you know)

[Post-Chorus: Olamide]
Fine girl, to ni to ni idi nla
To ni to ni idi nla, to ni to ni idi nla
Booty yi, o nse mi ki nla
O nse mi ki nla, o nse mi ki nla`
Fine girl, to ni to ni idi nla
To ni to ni idi nla, to ni to ni idi nla
Booty yi, o nse mi ki n la

[Outro: Davido]
Fine, fine girl

Fine, fine girl
She know say she be fine fine girl (switching position)
Fine, fine girl
She know say she be fine fine (standard potential)
Give me the motion, the vibe, the motion, the vibe, girl
Give me the motion, the vibe, the motion, the vibe, girl
