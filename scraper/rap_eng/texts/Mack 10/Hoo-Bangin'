[Intro: Ice Cube]
You are now rockin with the west
We don't fuck with the stress
Westside connect-Gangin, hoo-bangin
And we got thousands, so fuck what you claimin

[Verse 1: Mack 10]
Who wanna scrap with a nigga that bang
Straight mass murderin on 24 tracks
I put it down like a hog, I got what you need
I'm from the westcoast the bad seed with the bomb weed
Hollow points is my venom
I bust rapid as the beat, flamin hot when I send em
And them niggas out of bounds better duck when I come around
Movin the crowd with a tech layin niggas down
You say shit my whole crew claimin true
Some niggas damu and niggas wear blue
Pennitentary bound, smokin weed by the pound as I clown
Sendin work out of town on the greyhound

[Hook: Cube and Mack 10 - repeat 2X]
[Ice Cube] Mack 10 is the lick, Westside is the click
[Mack 10] Can't get enough of this gangsta shit

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
We got bulletproof vests and 96 SS's
Leavin fly bitches in donna karen dresses
With a neck full of hickeys, situation lookin tricky
20,000 in my pocket and I'm still sportin dickies
Fuck that, connect life, let me make it plain and simple
You say you roll deep you gonna get busted like a pimple
Till my very last breath, I'mma Inglewood swang
So tell me do you bang, fool, what set you claim?
Cause niggas like you can't win with Mack 10
So let the games begin, I'll leave you black again
Cause on a homicide I ride to the fullest, not just a little
'Cause it's four fingers up and two twisted in the middle

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3: Mack 10]
I'm on the hunt for the loot, watch your pockets cause I pat em
Bailin through the hood in chucks and stacey adams
Got the spot still poppin, got your legs still rockin
Ever since "Foe Life", my ex bitch been jockin
I can't fade no hoes, And this is one of those
That I iron on my clothes, and shine my romeos
Be the best friend to me, get a little hennessey
Always down to scwab when I blast on my enemy
A bitch thats the leader of the hoo bang committee
With a 100% Mack 10 on her tittie
Lookin pretty as a bangin if you wanna hoo bang
Throw your neighborhood up like it ain't no thang

[Hook] -4X

[Mack 10]
Yeah, gung-ho mack 1-0
Straight stompin and chicken hawkin
Inglewood swangin, dope slangin
And Hoo-Bangin' Comin from the...

West-side
