Squeak Ru:

You know sometimes life is a trip
It can make you do mysterious thangs
And sometimes life is a bitch
How do you deal with the pain?
Niggas rather smile in my face
Stick a knife in my mothafuckin' back
Than to see my family doin' well
And my pockets steady gettin' fat
Since the age of 14 you know
I been representin' my neighborhood
G'd up every goddamned day
Puttin' it down foe the city of Inglewood
And I ain't asked nobody for shit
Ain't nobody had to front me no sack
Everything I got I did it by myself
And that's a mothafuckin' fact
But why when I'm doin my own thang
And why when I'm on my own grind
Niggas wanna turn they back
And act like Squeak done switched sides
And even though I got niggas that I love
And niggas that I know  is real
I still got them niggas that I wanna
Take my pistol and stick it to they fuckin' grill
But have you ever been down wit the homies
Because you thought the homies was true?
Or have you ever been down wit the homies
And found out the homies ain't down with you?
Huh, player haters suck my dick!!
