[Verse 1]
I'm hittin switches all day
Hit the block set it off like gary gray
I smoke weed gold-d's on the cherry tray
Pockets full pitbulls drinking perier (haha, yeah)
13 inches of pure joy
When I'm on the switch I'm like a kid with a new toy
Rollin on 3, with 2 red bones on E
We caravanning to the beach
Niggas dippin these streets
I'm good on the switch never missing a beat
4 switches all I need and I love this shit
Drop the ass on the bitch and scrape the bumper kit
Well just pull up to my bumber baby
Who want some of this hot ass tray
I would gas hop, but no need to stomp her
3 licks I'm gonna bump her

[Hook]
Just throw your mother fucking hands in the air
Represent your hood like you just don't care
Set up shop never close and get riches
And never stop rolling foes and hittin switches
Throw your mother fucking hands in the air
Represent your hood like you just don't care
Set up shop never close and get riches
And never stop rolling foes and hittin switches

[Verse 2]
I puts it down west pound riding it's hot top chop 6 ace
Like a wild bull as a pump chump me around
Feeling like my back is on the sign of bubbles
Has the bass up sound
I hit the corner on 3 wheels
Rag cop keep popping like wheat pills
You know I floss down the shore cos I love LA
Back to the hood down vanessa let the bumper scrape yeah
Low-rid-ers on hundreds spoke Danas
Low-rid-ers for all the who bangers
Bounce, rock, swerve, and skate
Hit the switch up and down from back to pancake
Bounce, rock, swerve, and skate
Hit the switch up and down

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Baby come fly with me, get high with me
Let me show you how a riders suppose to be
Trunk tight, ready to take flight
Up and down the shore all night
Nigga when the trunk up
You see gates and pumps
Rag ace rap, metal flakes with humps
Stay on point like stiletto
Square dumping beat pumping through the ghetto
Classic chevrolet with the top off in my dumps
It's more square than the Zenith knockoff
It's who banger for life
And none other than westside ride and gangsters straight thug
When it's time to clown hit the set when the sun falls down
SPG's having platinum d's as we bounce, rock, skate, players motivate
In the icy candy paint

[Hook until fade]
