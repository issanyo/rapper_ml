Song:   The Guppies

The guppies dup dup dup
(Repeat dup dup dup 3X)

Verse 1 (Cube)
It's a feeding frenzy
With guppies all around the edge
Nigga if you tryna get fed you in the red
Eat you up, beat you up
If that don't work heat you up
Now you wearin' white (punk)
Smellin' like Fahrenheit
Niggas, fleas, ticks and parasites
Tryna get a crumb off the turntable
Stick your nose in my bowl it's fatal
You Kane I'm Abel
Nigga you know we checkin' quotas and dollars
Nigga you no the pecking order we follow
Sayin' that we got to holla, if I can quote you
But the king of the jungle never meet with the vultures
Never been a sucker never been fake (never)
Never tried to make all I can make (never)
Represent my niggas 'til the bow breaks
But haters hate we can eat steak by the lake

Chorus
The Guppies dup dup dup (Repeat 4X)

Verse 2 (Mack)
What a beautiful day, clear blue skies
My murder ones block sunrays from my eyes
Twistin' triple gold so I gotta pack heat
Lay the titanium and flame up the street
Down the boulevard with my hand on trigger
Fools hittin' me up like who is that nigga
Ruuff ruuff you know who it is
Mack 10 punk top dog in showbiz
I cocks the revolver ready to start gattin' 'em
But what I look like set trippin' and I'm platinum
I hesitates put down the trey eight
Keep pushing to the hood
Make sure my folks is straight
Outta control a nigga ballin' like Shaq
Gave my momma money and slid the homies sacks
And it's like that about the bank wad
The more cheese ya got the more killas on ya squad
For the guppies

Chorus

Verse 3 (Cube)
Okay we hollered fake as hugs check my wallet
Driving to the crib make sure no nigga followed
Called up the mighty one O (what you wanna do)
Turn these bitch niggas to snow (how many 1 or 2? It's on you)
Westside battle cry my alibi first class
Hella high when you die
I'm changin' standard time with the yuppies
But fuck them to and you
You askin' who [The Guppies] (Mack starts at 'The Guppies')
Brought Mack Manson back to life
I kill niggas without a gun or a knife
I gave the order is he dead? (yep) enough said
And all my followers got W's on they forehead
Murderers and they kill on command
Walk around like zombies with Techs in each hand
For Mack and the Don wet you up like neon
Freeze you like freon you fuckin' peon
The Guppies

Chorus
(bubbles)
Chorus
Eat you up
