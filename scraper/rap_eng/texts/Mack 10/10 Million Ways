[Chorus: Ice Cube]
Cause if you fuck with us we leave scars

[Mack 10]
Tick tock around the clock for the rock ya come see me
Just knock at the door I'll grant your wish like a genie
Strait out to get paid stack the loot that I made
Been slangin' dope out my mammas' house since the 10th grade
Never tried it can't deny it in the riots was a looter
Used to hang with drive by shooters
Stickem up for Honda scooters
Never was a scholar make you throw yo hands and holla
Wolla went to Jr. high slangin' joints fo a dollar
Finger waves was the new fad so they spoted a due rags
Niggas got dumped on fo the red or blue rags
Down with the G's so them niggas never serve me
Bellin' through the hood in my honeycomb Jersey
Painter pants cuffed so I fixit on my biscuits
Till my hair get long enough to brade my bitch I'll keep it twisted
It's that niggarunnin' wild punch the pedal to the meadow
And everywhere I go it's a must I keep it ghetto

Chorus: X2
[Ice Cube] Cause if you fuck with us we leave scars
[Mack 10] Motherfucker crime pays in 10 millions ways

"Choose one"
"1 2 3 4 hit it!" (X2)

[Mack 10]
24/7 on a 211 fresh out the county I hunt like a bounty
]From 10 to midnight make sure my shit tight
Map out the lick right so that I hit right
I strike to stay alive to be exact need a sack
Can't hack this monkey on my back
So I shot it now you plot it I got it
Exotic to erotic money ho's to narcotics
No preachin' knowledge of self or religion
I'm too busy raisin' pitbulls and pigeons
Put the hustle down steady for the summer
I'm ready way tighter got two birds and a rider
But I'm out fo mo nigga can't get enough doe
Place my hands on the fo fo
Arm robbery is my hoby
So I gotta sickum then lickum
Now who's my next victim

Chorus: X2
[Ice Cube] Cause if you fuck with us we leave scars
[Mack 10] Motherfucker crime pays in 10 millions ways

"Choose one"
"1 2 3 4 hit it!" (X2)

Got the plak in the back straight ragtop
Peepin' the scene with the gangsta lean
Super clean in and out make you weak at the knees
I watch fo the theives on my hunt spoke D's
Stereo type foe life from the streets where the palms trees sway
And the money parlay
Fo block niggas got the hoes like sewed up
Bitches on my nuts every since I first showed up
BG nigga with my though skins hangin'
Tryin to look like my big homies that was bangin
Slangin like 90 goin north with the cavey
Twistin through the hood in a 83 caddy
Coupe Deville I packs my big still
Cause it's sittin on white ones with the two way tight ones
And as I floss I keeps my nina Ross
Cocked with the clipin to catch a nigga slippin'

Chorus:
[Ice Cube] Cause if you fuck with us we leave scars
[Mack 10] Motherfucker crime pays in 10 millions ways

"Choose one"
"1 2 3 4 hit it!" (X2)
