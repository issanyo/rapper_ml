K-Dee talking:
Hey hey hey baby check it out. I'm K-Dee, &
That's my nigga Mack 10 over there. Now he gotta be cooler
Than the nigga thatyou sittin' with, so pump yo' brakes
Cause here comes the G. Foe Liiife!!

[Mack]
Uhh that's right uhh yeah ha ha ha ha
What the fuck you smilin' at
Right

[Verse 1]
It's that nigga west side swangin'
Heat I'm bringin' like I'm bangin'
Slangin' khakis hangin'
Took the script & I'm flippin' it
Got bustas straight trippin' it
Never thought Mack 10'll
Be the new nigga rippin' shit
Real G style on a funky freestyle
Solo flo show with my bitch & my lo lo
Gettin' my floss on as I slide my locs on
Hit the corna' bitch hold on
Danas is what I roll on
So watch yo' step quiet it's kept on the leak
I blast I don't stick the different nigga in the click
As I kick rhymes niggas pick mines from the stack
Threw the roof on the sack then cut the 'lac front & back
On all gold hundred spoke D's when I skiis
Nigga please wanna be G's don't wanna see these
Straight from killa Cali it's like the Valley of Death
Of who's left I'll be a G 'til my very last breath

[Chorus]
Alli alli all come free here comes the G
Fresh as a new pack I'll be doper than my cavi sack
Alli alli all come free here comes the G
Checkin' loot like it's crazy in painter pants & Stacys
(Repeat)

[Verse 2]
Now as I roll through the turf with that true G pride
Feeling high as I ride from the west to the eastside
On them switches went from rags to riches
All snitches must die I can't lie
I like them hoochie bitches
Though I know that a ho is a gamble
Scandle hard to handle them dookey braids & sandals
That's how I like it hike it touchdown then spike it
Then pipe it so tough they can't gripe it
So if it's on from uh dusk 'til dawn
Keep it crackin' stay packin' as long as niggas jackin'
Mackin' like Goldie bumpin' nothin' but oldies
Reminiscin' tilt the 40's when I vibe the dead homies

Talking:
Yeah I wanna say what's up to all my deceased homeboys
From the west & eastside didn't make it to see this rap
Oh yeah it's still Mack 10 foe life puttin' it down like this here

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Down for the dirt I sport khakis and a white t-shirt
Slangin' work got the big birdies that don't chirp
I came up from a crawler now my stack is taller
Big baller shot caller movin' shit like a U-Hauler
So now it's on like that & I'm rollin'
Controllin' the 'hood guns about a boat swollen
Back arms tatted (Inglewood) so tweed can get gatted
Cavi water weed or speed what you need cause I have it
So come through run through & uhh smell the vapors
Won't be no set trip if it's all about paper
Down with the Lench Mob I can't go wrong
Well known & it's on bankin corners in my Brougham

[Chorus]

Mack 10, westside, foe life, and we out
