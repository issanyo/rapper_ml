Simps on a quest to test my nerves
It ends up tragicomic
They took on it
Hopped on it
They tried but
Doggone it..
I'm not the one for that
Yo, I'm the one to step on back
Analyze your stomped on cardiac before I crack
Just stay sore hittin
If conviction was a weapon
Then the gat stay lifted
Cause I'm triggered steady gripping
Verbalize what I fertilize
(in) 'ternalize what you make it
Now visualize what I'm saying Charles
You see?
I ain't playin'
I'm cherry bombin' playgrounds
Adults got minds like adolescents
I'm steady progressing
(?) with drafts addressing with lessons
Yo check it
Fools who idolize
Lives simple minds
With admiration
Yo, I paint vivid portraits with hatred
With nothing to say
If you got something to say
I advise to be cautious
I'm making bad intentions nauseous
With straight posture and flawless optics
With the option of viewing right through you
You need glasses to do what I do

Hook:
What you sayin'?
So you sayin'?
What you sayin'?
Tell me what you sayin'?
