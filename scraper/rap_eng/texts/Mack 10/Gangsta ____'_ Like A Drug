Gangsta S***'s Like A Drug
Tray Deee, Squeak-are you (of AllFrumTha I)

[Tray Deee]
Yeah again, another group collaboration

[Verse One: Tray Deee]
From the second I get dressed to get to steepin' I'm on one
Fillin' up the 4-4 if pop-po want some
I ain't runnin' from a motherf***er
Dust a sucker off if he soft then f*** him if he suffer
Another One Bites The Dust like the song say
Bust em in the wrong way, caught up in the gunplay
One day, some say, we all gon' die
Human lives to my eyes, take a size and bye
You're on your own, give em all and go explode
It's a cold that arose when you chose your clothes
Blue or red, who will care if we all was rich?
Ballin' tills, haulin' chickens, flossin' grips
I give a damn bout the next fool, my tek rule
Ol' school n**** bout to take it to the next school
This gangsta s*** is like drugs, runnin' with thugs
Puttin' slugs in your motherf***in mug

[Chorus x2] Squeak-are you, (Tray Deee)
This gangsta s*** is like a drug, (I got to ride)
And live for the hood to show my love
*repeat*
(*singing*)
This gangsta s*** is like a motherf***in gangsta drug
Crips and Bloods, oh

[Verse Two: Squeak-are you]
I got to bang on my enemy
I got make sure they know, they ain't afraid of me
So I'm gon' ride on they hood
Leavin' nuttin' but obituaries 'til they get it understood
You know that Squeak-are you capped em
I wantcha homegirl photo book to be full of em
I'll be the gossip for ya block
When why'all explain to each other how I creep with the Glock
The 4-5 n**** did the damage
I took two to da dome, so, n****, f*** a bandage
And all you got was a body bag
Accommodations to the morgue, e
