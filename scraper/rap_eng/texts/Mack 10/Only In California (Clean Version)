Throw him back in, he feel the fin of the baracuda
I negotiate, Mack is the doer {*two gunshots*}
You the fool on the journey strapped to this gurney
We break bread with accountants and attorneys
Currency never worry me (Ay yo)
Which one of y'all never heard of me
Higher than a 33
Tell 'em what you drankin' (Hennessy)
Never tell 'em what you thinkin'
Never tell 'em where the [{*body*}] hangin'
No Lincolns
No Jacksons
Bankin' Franklin
What you thankin', hope your man come, with the ransom
Let me see you dance on, no longer handsome (Dance)
If you don't drop off, than walk off
WATCH IT, WATCH IT

Repeat Chorus

Them west coast riders is real set trippers {West side}
Will get you for them zippers on that quest for them chippers {East side}
Slidin' on the ride
Not even hittin' switches (Yeah)
I'm hangin' at the high school, gettin' at them young misses
I keep them dubs fat

Yo, what up

I'm hollin' at the big homeboy
Who fresh out {What you doin'}
He hangin' at my grandmama house, the homie burnt out

What do you consider fun (What)
A ounce and about five hun'

(Verse 3)
So I
Put him on a move
That I knew about {For what}
I hooked him with a homegirl from the south, good lookin' out
Money made, plug a player in this game
Especially when he represent the same thing I claim {Dogg Pound}
Man, they don't make homies like they used to
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deux {That's real}
Cause everybody wanna see a star
In the city of dope
A.K.A. caviar

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mack 10 {Ice Cube in background}]

So hard, we stickin' up (Stick 'em up)
Yo, we tired of trippin', so we all clickin' up {West side}
So please, we ain't trippin' off C's and B's
