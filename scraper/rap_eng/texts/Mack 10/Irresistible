[Intro: Westside Connection]
Slippin', slidin', glidin'
Low ridin' (yeah)
Ain't no hidin' from this hit (On the real)
Fool, you know how we do it (Irresistible)
Just keep it poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo' hoppin', ass droppin'
Keep it poppin', ain't no stoppin' (What, Mariah)
Fo' hoppin' ass droppin' (Westside)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Westside Connection)]
Everytime I try to leave
(She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Something pulls me back, baby
(Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
Tried and tried to let you go
(Yeah, hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
But it's just impossible (Irresistible)
Every time we say goodbye (Westside, Westside)
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
(She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Wish I didn't need you so (Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
But you're irresistible (Yeah, hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
(Irresistible)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I don't wanna lose you to somebody else
But I can't go on contradicting myself
I know that it's pointless to keep holding on
But something inside tells me you're where I belong

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Every time I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Every time we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I know that it's unrealistic to think
That things will get better between you and me
'Cause time after time, you just shatter my heart
But when I'm without you, I feel so torn apart

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Every time I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Every time we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Boy, I wish
That I didn't love you so
(oh oo oh oo oh oh)
I try to tell you no
But you're irresistible
(oh oo oh oo whoah oh)

[Verse 3: Westside Connection]
[?]

[Verse 4: Mariah Carey]
See I only want it to be like it was
When we got together and first fell in love
Sometimes it's like I'm addicted to you
This love's so consuming
I don't know what to do

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Westside Connection)]
Everytime I try to leave
(She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Something pulls me back, baby
(Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
Tried and tried to let you go
(Yeah, hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
But it's just impossible (Irresistible)
Every time we say goodbye (Westside, Westside)
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
(She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Wish I didn't need you so (Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
But you're irresistible (Yeah, hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
(Irresistible)
Everytime I try to leave
(She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Something pulls me back, baby
(Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
Tried and tried to let you go
(Yeah, hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
But it's just impossible (Irresistible)
Every time we say goodbye (Westside, Westside)
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
(She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Wish I didn't need you so (Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
But you're irresistible (Yeah, hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
(Irresistible)
