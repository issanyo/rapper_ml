She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga

[Verse 1: YG]
Baby look in the mirror
You got your hair and your nails done
You fucking who you want, not thinking you was wrong
Bitch you wish you was a nigga
Damn you should be ashamed
Acting like those pussy lips can't hang (can't hang)
You been going against the grain
Your body is a temple, you going against the saint
Acting like you was innocent
But as soon as you get mad at your nigga you be with the shits
He just left the house and you calling quick
Who she calling? Some different dick
And you know that ain't lady like
Word around the town that pussy whack but head game nice
If that pussy ain't tight you ain't living right
I'm tryna give her some advice on life but...

[Hook: Jay 305 Joe Moses and YG]
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Bitches gon' be acting like Bruce but they wanna be Cait
And I heard she fucked Drizzy, didn't even get paid
Damn, lowkey hoeing for a shoutout (shoutout)
She scheming on Wayne before he got out, groupie
You dropped outta school to be a stripper, be a stripper
This lil bitch be acting like a nigga, what
Last nigga said he was straight
Said every time he pulled up, she be pouring the eighth
Every time he wanna chill, you got some friends over
To every nigga wanna fuck, you just bend over
Instagram selling clothes like a swapmeet
Can't go to no local malls you on the hot seat
Downtown going HAM with your tax check
You off every single drug, you a crack head
Mama told you to value your coochie
But traded that head for a hooptie, bitch

[Hook: Jay 305 Joe Moses and YG]
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
(Nasty ass hoes, let me tell you about this bitch..)
She wish she was a nigga

[Verse 3: Jay 305]
Why you always single? Why you think you so cute?
Why girls be calling hoes when they fuck a lot of dude?
Well shit, the answer is this
Y'all bleed once a month and all we got is a dick
Yo emoji was a flip, you know you a hoe bitch
Drinking on some Lemonade thinking she Beyonce, damn
Cheating on her fiance, damn
She getting with it off the powder and the Bombay
Always talking she ain't a hoe, she a hoe
Dropping her kids at granny house, she a hoe
On Snapchat, dog face, she a hoe
LA niggas ain't saving no hoes
The homegirl, the local hoodrat know all the niggas
Be bicken back with the Bloods but she be crippin'
Got drunk one night, tryna fight, this bitch be trippin'
If you was a nigga, you'd be a bitch nigga

[Hook: Jay 305 Joe Moses and YG]
She wish she was a nigga
(Bitch what you gotta say about this hoes)
She wish she was a nigga
(Boop ass bitches, man, stripping)
She wish she was a nigga
(Are only at Maestro's, ass bitches, man I don't know)
She wish she was a nigga
(Taking pictures in front of Maestro's
Bitch, man that shit is played out hoe)
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga

[Outro: Joe Moses + Jay 305 ]
Man these hoes man, I don't know man
(she wish she was a nigga) they lost
They need God man, they need God and Jesus they need to be baptized, I don't know...
A nigga like me, Jay 305, man to pimp one of these bitches, put one of these bitches on the trinnack
Man you know what man, I digs that, I digs that
You know what I mean, you know what I mean
Would you hang with that?
You know what I mean, it's South Central baby
You know what I'm saying world famous
Jay 305...man he stand out, you know what I'm saying?
