[Snoop Dogg talking]
Hahaha, yeah
You're about to witness something you never thought you'd witness
Before
Check this out

[Snoop Dogg]
Welcome to the house the D-O double G built
We got honey, cream, silk and milk
We make that big bank and keep that big shank
Just in case we get slapped into the home we take
Nigga don't think Dogg slips at all
I make chips for crips and the beat dogs
True niggas, do niggas, hey you niggas
Can't get with us cuz we rip shit up
It's Mack Dime, and D-O dub
Here's a toast to the most, westcoast love
Fo sho though, I let you know from the get go
Pullin on my endo, rollin through the Wood with my kin dog

[Mack 10]
Not De La Soul, but fresh on parole
Now it's all about the hustle with the pebbles on swole
I'm know to the peoples as the Inglewood swanger
Been rollin gold Danas since a BG banger
It's a dog eat dog world in the city that I'm claimin
And niggas say we bangin cuz our colors be flamin
But I'd rather push crack, let the bank roll stack
I show Snoop how to whoop and then I front him a sack

[Snoop Dogg]
Nigga better blue tennis shoes tidy, with our body
As I fall into the Mack 10 listenin party
Got greeted by some niggas who I never knew
Cold thing about it is that the niggas kept it true
Inglewood family is what they claim to bang
Street Rue and Maddog, I think that was his name
But anyway, what can I say?
Oh by the way, it's anybody 'kay?
So when you in LA, or nigga round my way
Give me a holler on the 310 or 213, yeah

[Hook:] X 3
Long Beach, with the ING

[Mack 10]
I'm makin green in the rap scene from coast to coast
And rollin three wheel motion from the woods to the ocean
See Snoop and Tray Dee in the LBC
And wasn't nobody trippin, just cool as can be
No harm up in (?) so the hatas got bigger
But they figure platinum niggas keep a gold plated trigger
And that's fo sho though, you know how it go
Jump in the low low and bang with the homies, fuck a ho
So keep away crack and leave your bullet proof vest
Dogg there ain't no need for that, we headed west to the QS
Game recognize game, and it always should
It's all good and you niggas got a passion, Inglewood
Whoever trip get caught up in the middle like Monie
That's on the one and only I keep the big homies for the phonies
So let it be known, from my hood to your town
That connect game niggas is straight down with the Pound

[Snoop Dogg]
Now all my peoples in the LBC pull up a chair and have a dime bag on me
See we be DPGin this, we in this thang to make hits and bump a
Bitch and maintain
Cuz the more better you get, the more cheddar you get
The more shit you talk, the more wet up you get
See, I found out quick, don't say shit
Just take care of yours, and handle it quick
Yeah, it don't stop for Biggie or 2Pac
Niggas been gettin shot on my block
But we got to make a change and the thang is this
I keep my heater by my seater just in case y'all twist
But I wish upon a star
To stay down with Mack Dime, pushin caviar
The real recognize the real, I'll kill for that nigga
ING DPG, deal with it nigga, for real

[Hook] X 2

[Snoop Dogg]
They live on the streets, and they hustle for fame
Some claim twenty crip but most claim insane
See it's not a lifestyle, it's a full time job
And if you live in Long Beach, it's like a macabre
]From blunt to blunt, everybody's bad
And if you don't know where you at you better tuck in your rag
Push heat on the street, with Chuck D's on his feet
Makin money slangin tapes up out the Compton swap meet

[Mack 10]
Up jumps the boogie some niggas gang bang
So keep a big steel if it's a real G Thang
But I kick back, relax, count hundreds by the stacks
And keep the yay on the stove till the whole key cracks
Ain't a busta in the crew, so I'm callin all hogs
It's connect gang rollin with the Pound and Snoop Dogg
And everythang all gravy like it's 'posed to be
It's Long Beach with the Ingle dub O-O-D city

[Hook] (till fade)
