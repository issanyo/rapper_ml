Smoke sometin', cause it's the holidaze
Get ya dolla daze, pop a colla plaze

And try to ball wit a nigga who play double headas cause

Cock em' back and treat you like you neva met us

Westside Connect Gang-Ga-Gang Connect Gang-Ga-Gang Connect Gang-Ga-Gang

[WC]
Ba boom guess who stepped in the room
Off the liquor loc C-walkin' under the missteltoe
Shoppin' cookies, bag full of Goodies
Smokin' out your city with this blue berry sticky icky
WC off the hinges my witness
And them high switchez for a Ghetto fucking Christmas
Hit the block flossin' I got's to rap
Three wheelin' with the Konjak on my bud nyya
Gangsta Gangsta got 'em lookin' my way
Cause I got the new "West Class" in the drive-way
Bendin' the corner, put it up on ya
Like threelik swing swing, bling bling
Mad Hoggin, Bouncin, Sippin' Beer
Blindin' niggas wit' the carrots in my ear
Another currin' out the gate
Stack them big heads
Dub tryin get me 'tween some scared nyya

[Hook]

[Ice Cube]
Holla at a pimp, holla at a pimp

[Mack 10]
It's that time of year I got a Sack of Scrizzla
And meants for the whitening sabber and Chinchilla
I know my momma cooked I can hardly wait
I'm hungry so when I come through hand me a plate
Or that down hun southern cook connect jam
Now easy on the ham, But heavy on the candy jam
I see you lookin' at me bugged out (No Doubt)
Pull up in a bentley straight Thugged out
Heavy metal, extreme ghetto and bugs
And only Converse on my pedal cause all I wear is chucks
While I'm, Greasin' G all down on my drawers
And You Know I plained up like Santa Claus
I grind, And do what I do to make a not
And the Cali weather ain't the only thing that's hot
Chicken Hawkin', I stay away from guys that snitchin
And though it's sunny I'm still around hoes cause I'm pitchin

[Hook]
