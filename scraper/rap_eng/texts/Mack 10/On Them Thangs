(Do-do-do-do) On them thangs
(Do-do-do-do) On them thangs
(Do-do-do) On them thangs
(Do-do-do) On them thangs

When in the streets I keep my heat on my seat, no doubt about it
It's my African express I don't leave home without it
Summertime just ain't known for the weather
It's hot cause niggas bring out shit they put together
13's to 14 7's can't miss
But on some shit you got to let 15-8's twist
Chevy trucks and 'em
El Caminos anybody want Dana's I got them for eight c-notes
All day long
Gold or all chrome it's on
You oughta get 'em cause the tires come with 'em
But they ain't for busters only hogs roll D's
So keep yo' stocks on if you can't fade these
Thousands in my pocket, yayo I rock it
Keep my low clean so the car hops can jock it hit the switch up and down
Make the bumper drag the ground on the 'Shaw
Every Sunday night just to clown on them thangs

[Hook]

Get the hammer
Be sure that yo strap ain't a jammer and as long
As ain't nuthin' wrong then beat I'm on
As I watch for the lick I got the switch to make me hit
Front back side to side and that three wheel shit
Won't hesitate to let loose niggas broke the gang truce
But I still roll my deuce that hang like a noose
It don't stop for Mack, it's the same ol' same ol'
Danas gold as a halo, twisting like a tornado
In that surplus gear like the G of the year
Fuck the hour, it's all about the money and the power
Ain't about set trippin' no Bloodin' no Crippin'
Just dippin' hittin' switches knockin' hood rat bitches
As I'm rollin' out of control and smoking humps
Crank up the bumpie bumps 4 gates and square
Dumps so I bang it, make the 20's slide when I swang it
Lick it once lick it twice as nice
When I hang it on them thangs

[Hook 2] x 3
D's I'm on 'em
Killas they want 'em
On them thangs...

Old Chevy's to Cadillacs on twisters and Doves
Everybody got a plaque given pub to they car club
Mafia for life, Individuals and Damus Ride
Majestics and them niggas from the southside
New school to old school get they ride on
Bendin' corners caravaning like 50 strong
In a rag top that and a hard top this
Bustin ho's cause you can't miss if you let 'em twist
So get you a set of them what we call Dana's
And see for yo'self all the bitches they brang us
Cut the wheel right to left and make the ass end slide
Now all the riders ride and skate from side to side
On them thangs
