[Mack 10] (Talking)
Say bitch
Get on the good foot
Hit the block and drop a nut out a cock into a pimp sock hoe
Cause when ya know better ya do better bitch
If you wanted a motherfuckin off day
You shoulda been a secratery or somethin hoe
All the building's in New York may fall
But this motherfuckin P-I still be standin tall hoe

(Sample) *Ohh I feel traumatized*

[Mack 10]
Bitch you can miss me with that, and in fact
You can sell it from the escourt service to the track
I'm like old school Snoop, "I don't love them hoes"
And I don't care if its a blizzard, bitch hoe till ya froze
I throw a bitch in the game head first like a diver
Cause Big Daddy is a gangsta and a Bentley driver
I hit all 50 states with ass to grab
Cause 1-0 a motherfucker with the gift-of-gab
Square niggas relax it ain't no need for simpin
Shit your girl ain't missin she just hangin with pimpin'
See she had room to grow like a B in a D-Cup
I told her "now shake that mustard bitch and ketcup"
Now you my first asian hoe to you I'm a dream
But disobey, yo name is Wunthong, y'all for the team
Now sell ya ass like crack and pussy niggas is payin
Now hit the track and turn tricks and have 'em payout and weigh em
Bitch

[Hook]
PLEASE, don't you leave me lonely
(Shut the fuck up bitch and get my money)
PLEASE, don't you leave me lonely
(please my ass bitch get my cash)
PLEASE, don't you leave me lonely
(Bitch I turn lost hoes into boss hoes)
PLEASE, don't you leave me lonely
(State to State, City to City, Titty to Titty Bitch)

[Verse 2]
I might be young but I do know the game I'm not new to this
As soon as you trip, +Roll Out+ for actin ludacris
I start callin out bitch slow down she was a lunatic
I told her plenty of times I think you losin it
I hope I don't have to shoot the bitch
That's commin straight from the heart
Cause I told her the real nigga straight from the start
I'm through with your ass and please believe you got a replacement
And about the situation it ain't no conversation in it

[Verse 3]
Bitch, you was just somethin to do know that
Plus your menatl fit the description of how a hoe acts
It musta been the life in the fast lane
Cause you was overwhelmed with how fast the cash came
The pussy was bomb for that you stuck around
All the while you knew my style and now I fucked around
You know, how I treat hoes, I pick and I choose
Thinkin' I move, but yo ass singin them blues like

[HOOK]

[Mack 10]
You know how it goes
I bomb one hoe and know a whole row of hoes like domino's
Bitch, know what I mean?
I need satisfact with a chain reaction
Bitch when it come to bustin a hoe
I'm motherfuckin 20-below
Bitch that's cold as a motherfucker
My nigga Cam say
"Hoe's like colours, and every bitch wanna be led to a pot of gold"
So my niggas ya gotta look like a rainbow to do that shit
Ya dig?
Checkit
