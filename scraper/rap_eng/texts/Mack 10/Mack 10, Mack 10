[AllFrumTha I: Binky Mac and Squeak-Ru]
[Squeak-Ru]
It go M-A-C to the K one to the O
Bitches scream (HO!)
Hoo-Bangin with Nuthin But The Cavi
Steppin out the smog like a hog with my family
Squeak-Ru and Mack dime on the fade
Been lacin up our stars and stealin cars Since the 8th grade
Quick to pull your lid
You can call us Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
[Binky Mac]
Mack the Inglewood maniac, whos got the biggest sack?(Mack: "me")
Niggas that get large get put on contract
And thats a fact, He's all about big bucks
When he's saggin with his motherfuckin khakis and chucks
Chicken hawkin, swoop down low my nigga stalkin
AllFrumTha I, When we mob we ain't talkin
Binky Mac, once again it's on Foe Life
Presence is felt, before we takin yo life

Chorus: Group(Mack 10)
Mack 10, Mack 10, (can't you understand)
Mack 10, Mack 10, (Bitch I'm the motherfuckin man)
Mack 10, Mack 10, (can't you understand)
Mack 10, Mack 10, (Bitch I'm the motherfuckin man)

[Comrads: Gangsta and K-Mac](Mack 10)
(G): Hey Comrad, we keep pushin this crack
(G): Niggas gettin washed up, and we can't have that
(K): Niggas makin all these snaps with these wack ass raps
(K): So we went to Inglewood when we finished our sack
(G): It was back in January, or was it February
(K): I had to do some time, Mack Dime told me not to worry
(G): The scene was kinda scary, he sent me commissary
(K): I did my time and touched down with a flurry
(G): Told me not to worry, signed a deal in a hurry
(K): No more slangin dope to those niggas in Missouri
(G): Baguettes on our jewelry, futures no longer blurry
(K): And if you see a bitch with us fo sho she's temporary(Temporary)
(G): And you know we got it like that
(K): Rolexed out the game spo'tin croca sacks
(Nigga thats what you get when you fucks with me)
The Comrads and Mack D-I-M-E

Chorus

[Mack 10]
I can leap tall buildings twist on them thangs
I made Nuthin But The Cavi hits an Hoo Banged
I set traps to make snaps from coast to coast
And now I'm up to seven figures and I'm doin the most
I watch niggas cause they shady, I pack a lil .380
Look out for my peoples, everything is all gravy
(Is Mack a cool nigga?) Yeap, I guess, maybe
Bought a bubble eyes Benz for my bitch and my baby
Always talk about the hood, so they say that I'm a bragger
And if yous ain't a true blue, then yous a red ragger
If your girl want a thug then you know that I'mma tag her
But if she set me up then I'mma have to body bag her
Lay the back down on the Chevy so the ass end's a dragger
If a bitch is at the house while I'm jackin I'mma gag her
Wear my clothes like a banger, so of course I'mma sagger
Plus a young nigga rollin' more stones than Mick Jagger

Chorus
