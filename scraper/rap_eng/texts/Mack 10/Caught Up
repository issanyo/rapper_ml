Some people get caught up
And some charge is brawl out
Makes some people, some people, some people
Some people, some people, some people
Some people, some people, some..

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ol' Dirty kickin' your ass
The things that you learned in class is trash
You can't do nothin' wit' it, I put you in the past
You broken motherfuckers, shut the fuck up
I do it 'til you bad luck and head get bucked
The only thing on your brain is to give me this cash
Stay out of my business cause I'm takin' your tash
This rumble on the ming, none of y'all free
I got y'all in.. slavering

[Hook]
Some people get caught up
And some charge is brawl out
Makes some people, some people, some people
Some people, some people, some people
Some people, some people, some..
Some people get caught up
And some charge is brawl out
Makes some people, some people, some people
Some people, some people, some people
Some people, some people, some..

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
I gives a fuck about a bitch or a crooked ass cop
I'm a burst that, it's dealin', the hustle don't stop
I got stones and [?], ecstasy and weed
Metham-phetamine, sherm, sticks and speed
Pay it high wid, dope is all I got to give
I'm a ghetto nigga dog so I get it how I live
Got money, lock 'em off, fuckers still I got drama
Got two strike dog and like five baby mamas
With new strain I maintain, I'm ready and willin'
To keep change on niggas brains to keep the blood spillin'
I hate it but it ain't complicated, it's real simple
Fuck with me and know you get a hole in your temple
I ain't gonna play you niggas, I'mma slay you niggas
Don't take but a few figures and a few new triggers
Mack 10 livin' legend, every West coast rhymin'
Straight hoo bangin' gangsta and hard rhymin' sodom was that

[Verse 3: Royal Flush]
Shut up, let me talk for a minute, alot of bull shit on my mind
Dealin' with crime, alot of y'all dealin' wid rhymes
Stuck on the grind, crackheads cookin' my pies
Startin' off on the 1-2-5, the block's mine
Bucket just spine, DH tryna tap my line
Stop my productions, wanna know my money discussions
Who I roll wid, "buy so many cars is he legitin' of my dick"
It didn't matter when I ain't have shit
They'd watch me in helicopters, parklin' in my crib
All I wanna feed is my kids, no time to do a bid
Feel me, I forced the whole guns a while for my ones
Didn't sell drugs, where the money come from?
No school, no job, no bitch, no food, fuck that
Do what I do to make my shit true
And I make it hard on them boys who blew they cats charges
If I go to jail you know I'm blowin' on the Sergeants
