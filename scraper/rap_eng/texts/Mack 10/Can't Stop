E-40 talking: Mack OneDime, excuse me playboy
Aiight check this out, aiight nigga  check this out
We crimeys, right, that mean you my pa'tner in crime
Like that check this out, let's let 'em know summin'
You know niggas should've been plugged up
From L.A. to the Bay you understand we doin' Big Thangs
Big thangs mothafucka, big thangs fool. Check it out!

Aiight One O this E Feezee, I gotta I gotta thank my math teacher Count Dracula for just teachin' a brother to you know count his marbles you know? What about you?

Verse 1 (Mack)
You see I can't stop I won't stop 'til I check a mil'
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill
Three sixty-five, seven days, I believe crack pays
My estate's bein' guarded by pitbulls and AK's
I'm straight cookin' them thangs, movin' weight like I should
Cause a nigga livin' good, don't mean he went Hollywood
Dog I practice my craft so each year I get better
To stay ghetto and clever but be richer than ever

(E-40) Fonzerelli man I thought you was a rebel
I am but tell me this then
Why you move up out the ghetto (the ghetto)
Mothafucka I am the ghetto. I beg yo pardon
Nigga I was grindin' tryin to take off niggas' heads flossin' & fuckin' hoes when you was in kindergarten
Nigga this ain't Lenny and Squiggy, this E-Feezee & Mack Teezee
Fuckin' with Italian Romaine pasta chicken Tortellini
Thirty odd six custodian, with the scope
Far from Nickelodeon no shit no joke
Southern Cali up North see we be rollin'
Make a bitch purchase a gun, report it stolen
Plead the 5th but don't snitch, no case cause they're po po
And they mami know that 12 gage equipment can be traced
Stand on ya bunions, nigga don't try to get caught in his drawers
Cause them 2.2.3's be penetratin' through walls
Plus I got warrants and shit, didn't pay child support
Thinkin' about skippin' town, movin' to Shreveport
Bitch

Chorus
(Mack 10) You see I can't stop I won't stop 'til I check a mil'
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill
(E-40) From L.A. to the Yay see we be rollin'
Make a bitch purchase a gun, report it stolen
(Mack 10) You see I can't stop I won't stop 'til I check a mil'
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill
(E-40) See you my dude right, that mean we pa'tnas in crime
It's Forty Fonzarelli and Mack Dime (Mack Dime)
Bitch

Verse 2
(Mack 10) Forty I'm the one bro that's in the mix like gumbo
Now how can I stay humble and make feddy by the bundle
Marv said we got bigger triggas, Mack we got bigger figures
Now throw the top back on the 'Rarri and bang gears on these niggas
And watch what the money show you about niggas that don't know you
Busters is gone hate, real G's is happy foe ya
It's Mack Dime on the grind, fool it's my time to shine
Now would you niggas kick back and let me get mine
(E-40) Causin' havoc sparkin' up chaos, bringin' the ruckus heavy metal heaters
Mobb, under buckets if ya can't beat us
Then join us get on the team
Streetsweepers, grenades, rifles, and M1 car beams
Dice games craps bets over car titles pink slips cash money
Watchin' out for rival gang members beefin'
Bad weather but it all boils down to who got the most paper

Chorus

Verse 3
(Mack 10) I shoot 'em up like syringes, I know what real ends is
Lo lo's Harley Davis and big body Benzes
Ain't been faded so far on my wrist
I got a R hundred thousand dollar car
Cause I push the caviar
So what's up, what you need? Everybody huddle up
Got that 2-for-1 special with the rock called double up
So get lit take a hit shop is open all day
From L.A. to the Bay, it's Mack 10 & E-Fortaay
(E-40) Sometimes I wonder if it's worth this
Fuckin' with the law tryna make it look like I'm runnin' a legitimate tow truck service
With a Just Say No to Drugs bumper sticker on the back window (back window)
Knowin' I been smokin' a gang of Indo
Around the corner four houses down across the way way
Make a right and then a left over there by Safeway
And when ya get there page me, punch in how much you wanna spend
Seperate the 20's from the 1's 5's and 10's
Slick sly sharp narcotic vendors
Always do business in shopping centers
Buck 'em stick 'em stuck 'em don't ever fuck me
Hate 'em bleed 'em love 'em shit can get ugly

Chorus

Hoo bang hoo ride (2X)
Hoo ride hoo bang
Who be ridin' who be bangin' (Westside) Ride Nigga
(Repeat)
Fuck 'em and feed 'em cold sardines, cold sardines
(Repeat)
