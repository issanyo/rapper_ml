[Verse 1]

[Kaydo]
Trying to put him six feet deep
Underneath the concrete
O.G. is back on the streets
So niggas, grip the heat
It's on once again

[Cel]
While he soaking round the block, on the swing

[Kaydo]
Fresh out the pen

[Kausion]
Damn

[Cell]
We's out to be in this motherfucker for trying to loc up

[Kaydo]
For hold up

[Cel]
Niggas ain't gone choke up
We gots to play another plot to put him on his back

[Gonzoe]
And this full-prove nigga known missing on the attacks
Where he at

[Kaydo]
The last time I seen him he was toast

[Cel]
Straight sittin' at the liquor store, coast

[Gonzoe]
My temper's roasted
This nigga that snatch my hearing bone
Body slams sale would chase Cel all the way home

[Kaydo]

[Cel]
No, I got the shit under control

[Kausion]

[Verse 2]

[Gonzoe]

We watching every move he make
Anticipating which bone to break
Grab my properties, bake 'em up and shake 'em

[Cel]
I'm trying to lay in my cull connecting every bolo
Watch wings, stompin they mouth
Trying to break his collarbone and spleen

[Gonzoe]
We bring fast kicking and stitches, to bitches who trippin
Reveal the .38's for pistol-whippin'

[Kaydo]
Man, I told ya nigga Kaydo was that corner too quick
I ran around the block and got the foot long clip
It's filled to the tip

[Cel]
Straight prepared, full equipped

[Gonzoe]
But no buzzing cause catching the ale ain't the shit
So we went from the shoulders
Mobbed the hood souljah
Set trippin Kausion
Dippin like I told ya

[Hook]

[Mack 10]
Yea ok ok Y'all lil' niggas wanna do it like this
You must have forgot, I call the mothafucking shots around here
And I'm-a have all your mama's crying

[Verse 3]

[Gonzoe]
He played the big brother role
To other souls
Where I stay Pelican Bay turned the nigga the wrong way

[Kaydo]
He smoked 50 sacks with us til day get dark
Used to ? weed at the fiends ? at the park

[Cel]
It's like one less

(Cell & [Kaydo] one less) fool we gots to worry about
Mopped his ass up the clap, Kaydo and

[Gonzoe]

Kausion niggas stomp niggas the worst
Fucked up cause you test us first

[Hook (x2)]
