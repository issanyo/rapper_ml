Talking: The record you about to hear is basically true
The names have been changed to protect the guilty. (You a cold nigga)

Some breathe gangsta shit
We dream of gangsta shit (Repeat)

Verse 1
I hit licks nigga lead the hood in strong arm
'bout to get more chickens than Foster Farms
Now give it up or die this a mothafuckin' jack
Hustlas guard yo sack the chicken hawk is back
Impatiently waiting out of hunger
My instinct to kill got stronger
My wingspan's longer
My guns loaded up and before you know what hit you
I jump off the wire swoop and then I get you
And fuck a tussle bitch cause all I do is shoot
Put lead in ya dome take ya sack and ya loot
With a foe foe (.44) revolver so my strap ain't a jammer
I want pure Peruvian no cuttin' Arm & Hammer
Gotta take what I need that's how the ball bounces
Now decide if you go die over thirty six ounces
Before I go make sure no cameras in the vents
Pull a feather from my tail and dust off my claw prints
Nigga

Chorus
You knew that I was dangerous
When ya took it
Look the Chicken Hawk two is after you
(Repeat)
In search of super chicken (Have you seen him?)
(Repeat 4X)

Verse 2
Yo girl gave me the cock
But now she holla rape
So I take her to my nest
And wrap her with the duct tape
Pull my heat out squeeze and make these Teflons melt her
And watch blood drip all down the walls like Heltah Skeltah
Take flight over the woods to drop the body
And hit a lake to rinse off cause my feathers all spotty
I stalk once again caught my prey by surprise
Look in his eyes if he lies he dies before sunrise
Where the work at fool the jack is on
You feel the wrath of the chrome
Kick in or get your noodles blown
So hurry the fuck up nigga take me to the safe
It ain't no time to waste with this Magnum in ya face
Make one false move I swear the gunshots rang out
First I'ma kill you then I'ma blow ya bitch brains out
A hawks technicality is pecking for his salary
So keep the dope whoopin' while the Hawk'll keep swoopin'

Chorus

Mack Dime and that's one to grow on mothafuckas
