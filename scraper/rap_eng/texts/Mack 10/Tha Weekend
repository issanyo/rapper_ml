[Ice Cube]
Tha weekend
All you freak ho's freaking
Me and Mack 10 baby come on in
Tha weekend
This shit got you tweaking
Who tha fuck wanna steal what they got?
It's tha weekend
All you freak ho's freaking
Me and Mack 10 baby come on in
Tha weekend
This shit got you tweaking
Who tha fuck wanna steal what they got?
It's tha weekend

[Mack 10]
Yo, I'm looking for tha weekend
The weed got me tweaking
Plus the sticky green got the whole room leaking
I make the kind of shit that get a freak ho freaking
So pump the bass and check my mic level when I'm speaking
And to you haters out there I see you peeking
So I keep a Glock and leave your punk ass leaking
I hear you creeping, even when you're sneaking
Gimme a reason, if it's on then I'm squeezing
It's tha weekend!

[Techniec]
In the streets, ain't enough ghetto for me
So bad I gotta lug the heavy metal with me
Don't hang out on your block, I got plans to bubble
Only time you seeing Tech is when I'm causing trouble
Weekend, get my cheque, I'm flossing double
Out the house, running game like I'm off the huddle
Wonder how tough my ride?
Man, niggers cuff they bride
And come home from work three, stuck outside

Chorus: [Ice Cube]

It's tha weekend
This gat got you leaking
For speaking out of turn, nigga got to burn
Make em squirm, watch em do the funky worm
You got to learn, every fucking thing you earn
Tha weekend, tha weekend, tha weekend
You can't fuck with weed spin
Tha weekend, tha weekend, tha weekend
You can't fuck with weed spin

[Mack 10]
I'm a hoo-bangin' rider, retaliator till I'm leaving
Mash my opponents till they no longer breathing
I'm hatin to parole these killas and weed dealers
My niggas there ride hoochie bitches and three-willers
Dick em strong and long with a groupie or ?bougie? ho
I like em in a thong when they make their booty go
Run swipe up in, baby bulge and do I get em
When it's on my niggas get sure in em then I send em

[Techniec]
Ain't that no mission in the butts is ain't nothing to me
Up in the club, haters don't want nothing with me
I been a hog since you niggas was cuffing ya lees
I never hog, I'm looking down at nothing but flees
In your town, I crawl up, nothing but these
Like "Hey ladies!" Yea, who leaving with me?
"Hey fellas!" You need to leave immediately
If you don't want your ass whupped repeatedly
This is tha weekend!

CHORUS

[Techniec]
It's MC's please, we split through on threes's, wudda
Dayton off the ground laying, like "Whoa!"
I coast through your blocks slow
I'm H20, boy I got that wet flow
To douse your flame, I'll get that up out ya man
You plot, I'm sorry I shot ya man
See me whippin on the freeway, the LBC way
On the three-way with ?J-Wide? and pack
Hell yea, I'm riding with Mack

[Mack 10]
Mack 10 outside all night selling rocks
Patrolling with the deuce-five burning my socks
This weekend is your life, dying today
Next weekend is your wife, crying at your wake
Punk bitch screaming like "I can't believe they killed him!"
Fuck nigga with a stainless plate, we wouldn't have peeled him
The hoo-banging attitude, with the gat-titude
Seven days a week and make your forehead leak nigga!

CHORUS
