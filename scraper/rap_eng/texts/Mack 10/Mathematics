[Mack 10]
Every time I get my hands on
I try to make you dub, with my chips wouldn't stack
Than man I wouldn't hustle
I'm legal dog - I got the same desert eagle dog
When birds fly out of my hands
And to my people dog - Ya understand
The white man can't fuck with me
I Hoo-Bang in the streets Hoo my company
Papered up beyond mother fucker's belief
A millionaire patrolling the city streets
See the flames burning in my eyes mother fucker?
Cause if you sleep on it you get these dreams mother fucker
I ain't the one like I said, "I want it all"
And like my Conrads, time to wake up and ball
Call shots, have it ready - soft and rocked
Let all my neighbor hood fiends
Come to scrap all the pots
Let my little B.G.'s run the hood spots
And if it's funked than my killers come to shut down the block

[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping
Nigga that's mathematics
Over here we bloodin' and crippin' - Hoo banging and dippin'
Nigga that's mathematics
I got legal money in my account and dirty money under my mattress
Nigga that's mathematics
With my super bad bitch and my house on the hill
I can add it up for real all because of mathematics

[Mack 10]
I work for mines - let my work, work for me
I make my ends - my friends buy their work from me
Money is me - that folding on those switches is me
Went out on the seat and out with all those bitches is me
I make money while I'm sleeping
Cause money don't sleep - money is up seven days of the week
Three-sixty-five if you grind than it pays
I don't mind as long as your one-o is straight
Put some bread on this plate plus a little rate
That I give mines with a tape how to grind
I'ma leave my dent in the game like ripples
As a kid, even tried to make my lunch my triples
Stack it up, how do you think I bought that first double up?
The (?) and that other shit I hustled up - mathematics
That's just how I look at it
With enough carrots to feed a whole hood of rabbits


[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping
Nigga that's mathematics
Over here we bloodin' and crippin' - Hoo banging and dippin'
Nigga that's mathematics
I got legal money in my account and dirty money under my mattress
Nigga that's mathematics
With my super bad bitch and my house on the hill
I can add it up for real all because of mathematics

[Mack 10]
Everything is to the good now I'm living how I wanna
I got dope around the world and got some still on the corner
If you broke come and see me, I got shit for you to do
I got a class on how to make one bird turn in two
I'm a connected shot caller - pure bread baller
All I do is try to make my money flip like quota quarters
If money is the root to all evil than I'm (?)
And money is a race on mind so I'm cheating
I don't want shit subtracted - everything added
I didn't look back for shit since I hit bird status
And now I pack clips like Glaydis with no tips
Just a whole bunch of bloods and a whole bunch of crips
And a whole bunch of bitches when I rock the microphone
And my key to success is thirty-six hard zones
With my mind on a dub, re-up and stack cabbage
And I'm a walking proof of the signs of mathematics

[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping
Nigga that's mathematics
Over here we bloodin' and crippin' - Hoo banging and dippin'
Nigga that's mathematics
I got legal money in my account and dirty money under my mattress
Nigga that's mathematics
With my super bad bitch and my house on the hill
I can add it up for real all because of mathematics

[Mack 10 talking]
Yeah nigga this CMR and Hoo-Bangin' for life
Nigga don't get it fucked up and its straight nothing but mathematics
Around here and incase you didn't know nigga that's money
All this mother fucking ice and chrome wheels everywhere
And if you ain't bout' that then fuck you in your ass you
Hating ass nigga, hey Fresh let this shit bump homie
