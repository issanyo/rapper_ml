[Intro]
Yeah Ay nigga
Whassup homey? This fool just came on the block and tried
Who? Who? smash on all the homies
Nigga what happened? Ay nigga get yo shit!
What happened dog? Get yo shit!
What? Just meet me on the block

[Hook]
I don't know about you, but all I wanna do is get my bang on
Stay strapped wit my sack
While niggas watch my back
Well, nigga, get your bang on

[Verse 1: Squeak Ru]
Mack I hear some niggas gotta problem wit the 'Wood (Wassup?)
I see the homiez got they straps & they ready in the hood
So I'm loadin' up my weapon steppin'
Callin' up the crew cause ass-whippins we ain't accepting
And I ain't lettin' shit go
Niggas got to back up bowdown or get wet up with ammo (blaow)
Motherfuckers got to pay
Run up on 'em like a thief in the night cause I don't play

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
At night I can't sleep I'm tossing and turning
So I stray from the yak and smoke sherman
Gotta hobble to my leg and the hood's getting bigger
I'm paranoid sleeping with my finger on the trigger
And now my bitches stressin that I'm livin wrong
Cause I'm fresh out the pen & gettin my serve on (gunshots)
It's all about murder when me and Sweep from
So fuck da enemies & we dumping when we see some SO

[Hook]
I don't know about you but all I wanna do is get my bang on
Stay strapped with a sack while niggas watch my back
(What you want?) Just wanna get my bang on
I don't know about you but all I wanna do is get my bang on
Stay strapped with a sack while niggas watch my back
It's the life of a G I got to live

[Verse 3: Squeak Ru]
Them rocks movin slow on the block
Nigga one time hot & we just lost a dope spot(damn)
Got me curb serving under pressure
I'm so paranoid at night I keep my Glock on the dresser

[Verse 4: Mack 10]
This 187 got my mind under stress
Cause even clamin' Dub S (W/S) you need a bulletproof vest
You know the game nigga when you're Doggin' & Loccin'
Kill the 1st thing moving and catch the 1st thing smoking

[Verse 5: Squeak Ru]
All I wanna hear is buckshots & guts out
Niggas gaspin for they breath
That's the type o' shit I'm talkin about(fo sho)
AFT!: You niggas cruisin for a bruisin'
Hey Mack get ya ammo cock the tool that ya usin'

[Verse 6: Mack10]
Til they gone to the back dog
Cause when they come thru the 'Wood they betta know how to act dog
Connect gang punk, yell a hood out &(WESTSIDE) bust
And nigga fuck every click that ain't down with us(fuck em)

[Verse 7: Squeak Ru]
Fuck 'em and feed 'em fish niggas get dismissed
Connect Gang bang at the top of the list
Ya know with colored bandanas & clips like bananas
Homicides when we ride til the world wanna ban us(Nigga)

[Hook]

Talking: Mack I don't know about you But all I wanna do is get my bang on
