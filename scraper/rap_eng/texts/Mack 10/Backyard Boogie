Yeah, yeah, yeah

Verse One:

Saturday morning at the crack of sunrise
Thank the man upstairs for lettin' me open my eyes
It's a whole new game for me like T-Lee
It's nine-seven now and I'ma stay sucka free
Thinkin' about all my homeboys behind bars
As I crease up my khakis and lace up my stars
And everythang is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin' paper every day, it's all I'm trippin' on
'Cause ain't nothin' like a rag in Californ-i-a
With the top back, rollin' on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin' all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies
And mashi'n to the backyard boogie

[Ice Cube]
Get yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]

Chorus:

And then we comin' wit that
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's all about that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (unh)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's the backyard boogie) [repeat 3X]
Backyard boogie oogie oogie [repeat 2X]

Verse Two:
Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin' where you from cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
Been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggas in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin' they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin' loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin' back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The Bloods shootin' dice, and the Crips are C-walkin
Now the party is jumpin', and the crowd's gettin' bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin' and humpin'
'Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin'

(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
And we comin with that)

Chorus

Verse Three

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
Ain't nothin' but real niggas, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
And Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang
You choose or you lose while you conversatin'
Enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin'
I want homegirl over there in red
Cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a ho
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
'Cause she gonna leave a backyard boogie with me

[Ice Cube]
(Get yo' boogie on, yeah
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on)

Outro-Chorus

Straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
Mackness, mackness, unh!
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, nigga get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on baby, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on
Gangstas don't dance we boogie
Niggas run out and get yo' cookies
Gangstas don't dance we boogie
Mack 10 ain't no motherfucker rookie
Backyard boogie oogie oofie [repeat 8X]
