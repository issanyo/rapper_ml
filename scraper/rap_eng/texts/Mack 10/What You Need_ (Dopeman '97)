When ever you short, and times get hard
Plant indo seeds and watch em sprout in yo yard
And if dope money ain't good, well how come it spends
I give a fuck dolla please or yens ends is ends
It ain't hard to tell, thanks to my clientele
What you call the root of evil
Got a nigga livin' swell
I keep the spot rollin'
Unless I can't up in a raid
But until then fuck it my green thumb keep me paid
Nigga what you want? What you need?
I got plenty pound zone half of zone dime or a twenty
Bullshit walks money talks
It's all about the dough
Don't be mad at me foe hustlin'
That's all a nigga know

Chorus:
(Mista Dopeman can I get a hit please)
Well tell me what you need, cavi water weed or speed
(Mista Dopeman don't make me beg on my knees)
Well tell me what you need, cavi water weed or speed

I got the streets sewed up, from yo hood to my block
I cook powder cocaine and serve it when it rock
I done came up dog, I got a big body coupe
Cause I take my caviar and I scretch it with woop
Ballin' beyond and above from a key to a dove
Nigga get yo work from me cause I give the hommie love
On tripple beam skales you name it I sells
I got the baddest bitches plus the bombay jewels
And if it ever get short it won't take long to pop back
Doin' about a buck fifteen up the coast with my top back
I got a show to do, the kitchen is my stage
And since I'm headed O.T
Pick me on my sky page

Chorus

Smoke until you fry, you say depression is yo alibi
Water get you so high niggas think they can fly
I got a bombay batch of that shit, makin' a meant
Leave you crazy kinda bent with super natural strengh
So I keep the tech ready do blast cause I will
And extra jug to embombthe first nigga that I kill
So miss me with that bullshit fool don't even trip
My jugs already full and my sticks already diped
So come trough the spot if not spend money when you can
Cause when it comes to narcotics call Mack the dopeman
Now woop woop look at me all in the S coupe
Ballin' like I'm playin' hoop and I'm straight sellin loop

Chorus:
(Mista Dopeman can I get a hit please)
Well tell me what you need, cavi water weed or speed
(Mista Dopeman don't make me beg on my knees)
Well tell me what you need, cavi water weed or speed
(Mista Dopeman can I get a hit please)
Well tell me what you need, cavi water weed or speed
(Mista Dopeman don't make me beg on my knees)
Bitch tell me what you need, tell me what you need
(Mista Dopeman can I get a hit please)
