Verse (Txnic):
Why they be gripping the steel
Swear when I’m rich we all gon move to the hills
Man I’m tired of this shit, I’m tired of my bros getting killed
Say she looking for love cus’ she heard that it heals
Do you know how it feels?
That’s why I don’t link with nobody
They wanna shoot you in your lobby
It's feeling like it more than a probably
Yeah
And this shit is more than a problem
But It’s like we don’t wanna solve em
So I guess that we can’t live without em

Aww
Nah foreal
Tell me why they wanna take my life from me
And my girl just had a baby
Nah foreal
