[Intro: Crooked I]
Twist open that muhfuckin' Hennessy, nigga
Let's light up real quick, for my niggas
My niggas!

[Crooked I]
Every cigar a hundred, we don't cut it, we punch it
Light it up, lean my seat back, tell my brother to punch it
Reminiscing on hunger, we was hunting for lunches
Now it's power lunges and crunches
Getting that workout, baking that cake long, no oven mitt
Living like a hooker screwing politicians, man, fuck the government
Never made a fake song, I started so far from the bottom, we ain't have electricity to play that Drake song
No refrigerator either, we was quite stressed
Bologna floating in the ice chest, duct tape and a white vest
I put on the body armor and tuck a llama so my mama could put on a nice dress
Caught him slippin' in the kitchen, the homies told me he's snitchin'
I told him give me every pigeon you pitchin'
Then he called my name out before I could smash
He recognized the voice under the mask, had no choice but to blast
I was 19 years old, pants saggin, nigga my house shoes draggin'
Shootin' my magnum, I wasn't even flaggin'
Now I'm shootin' videos with a bad one in the wagon
I'm the king of this trappin' mixed with backpack rappin'
Stacking my money, ready to set the war off
Bringin' it to your house, your front door's gettin' tore off
Then I Art of War you, I'mma knock your ugly whore off
Hit 'em with the magic stick, the spell never wore off
Nigga this is Long Beach, I'm Eastbound and Down
Something like Kenny Powers, ain't stoppin' for any cowards
I sleep 4, then grind the rest of the 20 hours
My niggas we made a vow, we won't rest 'til the city's ours
I just lost a brick and I'm still talking shit
Peel the roof off the whip and peel your bitch off my dick
My whole fucking life has been Hustle & Flow
They say I ain't never heard Crooked on a Mustard before
Me and my niggas!

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]
I said that I’mma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I’mma die with my finger on the trigger
I’ve been grindin outside all day with my niggas
And I ain’t goin' in unless I’m with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafucking niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
