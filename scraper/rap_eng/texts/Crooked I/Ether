[Intro]
Yeah let me pull my motherfuckin' .45 out
For week 45, C.O.B., Hip Hop Weekly
Last year we made something out of nothing
This year something is becoming everything
I mean heavy bling, painting the Chevy green
Becoming the sickest rapper that you ever seen

[Hook]
E, this is Eastside
T, take it to the top
H, this is hip hop
E, every week I drop
R, I'm the realest nigga still in the game
This is C.O.B. for life, Crooked I is my name nigga
I, you see the initials
Will, I keep it official
Not, I sleep with a pistol
Lose, I greet you with missiles
I'm the realest nigga still in the game
C.O.B. for life, Crooked I is the name

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I will not lose 'cause niggas will not beat me
Used to be a hot diss, now it's a hot Weekly
See these rocks freeze me extremely hot breezies
Want to hop on the cock 'til they walk knock-kneed
Then I hop in the drop and it's begging to mach speed me
Yes sir the Spur is a blur when the cops see me
Smash it through the Eastside of Animal Planet
You love beef, I bet the cannons make cannibals vanish
Get your chin strap and mandible damage
The ammo dismantle and handle your cabbage
Like I'm a ravenous savage, nigga
Next to Crooked nothing is close
I'm political enough to blow up on the Huffington Post
Still put D on the block like I'm fucking with Ghost
Tuck in my toast under the clothes like a hustler s'posed (to-to-to)
Who can stop my reign?
That's like Bush having Obama's brain
That's like me voting for John McCain
My God, rather vote for John McClain
I die hard with my squad, C.O.B., my niggas is loyal
Fans make me who I am, I treat the listeners royal
It's like I got a sultan inside of my mind feeding me lines
Slicker than oil, sicker than spoiled food missing the foil
I'm outside the booth with what I recite
It's an out of body experience, my spirit's in front  of the mic
We nothing alike
You'd have to live a year passed 99 to keep it 100 once in your life
Open your mind, here's hoping you focus your grind
The realest quotes ever spoken in rhyme
The discipline to write something down is the first step to making it happen
I'm Lee "Crooked" Iacocca with mine
Lot of rappers want to be leaders, most of 'em blind
The others on a mountain getting their back broke from behind
There you acting for these fans in this industry so proper
In the booth you Superman, in the pen you a soap dropper
I don't respect competitors, I rather Beretta ya
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head, chest and et cetera
Flexing with weapons I'm shredding ya
Before I touch you kids I look for Chris Hansen because he want to catch a predator
My dude I'm too sick, my guns produce hits
I cruise in new whips, get nude with a few chicks
My flow is on cruise control so I really don't do shit
The best can learn from me, excuse my two cent
I'm Crooked I from C.O.B., never selling out
Yelling out fuck the world, let me spell it out

[Hook]
E, this is Eastside
T, we take it to the top
H, this is hip hop
E, every week I drop
R, I'm the realest nigga still in the game
This is C.O.B. for life, Crooked I is my name nigga
I, you see the initials
Will, I keep it official
Not, I sleep with a pistol
Lose, I greet you with missiles
I'm the realest nigga still in the game
C.O.B. for life, Crooked I is the name

[Outro]
Yeah, Hip Hop motherfuckin' Weekly
I see my nigga J.U. in this bitch
C.O.B. nigga
Shouts out to my nigga P-Dub in Lakewood, ya nawmean
Nick in Dago, what's poppin'?
Haha, Nema
Ya'll know what we doin' over here man
We get motherfuckin' busy
Tommy and Joell, we gon' get these niggas this year
J.C. and J Dog
Horseshoe motherfuckin' Gang in the motherfuckin' building
I got the whole Misfit Ent, rest in peace to my nigga
Yeah
Jay!
