[Intro]
This one's dedicated to my home girl, Auphelia Payne

[Verse 1]
She was a ghetto little girl who became a young woman
Didn't have no kids, didn't plan on one coming
And niggas who wasn't bout shit, she'd run from em
From a welfare family, look how the slums done em
Daddy was an alcoholic so her mama dissed him
Her gang banging brother was a homicide victim
One of her other younger brothers locked by the system
She sent him letters, couldn't describe how she missed him
Told him jobs in the hood ain't plenty
So I'm part-timing it at Denny's
But she didn't tell him at night she's strip club waitress serving Henny
Rocking lace stockings and a mini
Customers ask if they could buy sexual favors
Even the women want bisexual favors
But she don't get down like that and so they label her a hater
Go on, baby, tell them what you're made of

[Hook]
You don't know what to do, you gotta make it through
I feel your pain
You gotta keep on fighting and you will get to the better days
I feel your pain
Keep pushing, you'll be fine, don't give in, you'll be alright
I feel your pain

[Verse 2]
Now she wanna go to school so she enrolled in night classes
Told her friends about it but they acted like asses
They don't know we can't let this life pass us
Jet black hair, shaded eye glasses
Standing on the bus stop like a poster of dignity
Even though niggas push crack in that vicinity
You keep your identity
Rest in peace, big bro tatted on your left arm in beautiful caligraphy
It'll be a cold day in hell when you give up
You got a game plan to pull that european whip up
Get a interior decorator to fix your crib up
For being sick of the bullshit, I give you big ups
A lot of your homegirls, they ain't built the same
You tell them to get off they ass but they still remain
Lead by example though, kill the game
And one day they can build and change
I feel your pain

[Hook]
You don't know what to do, you gotta make it through
I feel your pain
You gotta keep on fighting and you will get to the better days
I feel your pain
Keep pushing, you'll be fine, don't give in, you'll be alright
I feel your pain

[Verse 3]
She was a ghetto little girl who became a young woman
And three years from now, she got a son coming
Today she in a 600, look at her stunting
While naysayers was fronting, she went and done something
Made it out of school, got two coupes to twirl
On the weekends she speaks at a youth group for girls
Teach them how to properly move through the world
Droppin jewels of wisdom if you choose the pearls
Got her own business and she's barely even 30
She said I prayed for strength and, baby, god heard me
Got accountants now, employees, and attorneys
Found a real nigga who appreciates her journey
Ain't gotta do it alone, got a loan
Moved mamma right out of the criminal zone
Got a front and back bone when little bro come home
Now she even got her own song
I feel your pain

[Hook]
You don't know what to do, you gotta make it through
I feel your pain
You gotta keep on fighting and you will get to the better days
I feel your pain
Keep pushing, you'll be fine, don't give in, you'll be alright
I feel your pain

[Outro]
Yeah, you know what I'm saying? This one goes out to my homegirl, Auphelia
Payne. You know sometimes we as men always focus on our own problems and we
Ignore the problems that our women are going through. You know what I'm
Saying? But if nobody else care about your everyday stuggle, you gotta know
That I do. Smile, baby girl, it's gonna be alright. We gonna make it through
The storm and watch the sunshine. I feel your pain

I feel your pain
I know your going through a thang
Everything will be okay
The sun shines after rain

Hey, I feel your pain
I know your going through a thang
Everything will be okay
The sun shines after rain
