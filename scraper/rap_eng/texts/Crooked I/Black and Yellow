[Intro]
Yeah, Hip-Hop Weekly Reloaded
Shouts out to everybody (ha ha)
See I how did that?
I got them all in one swoop
Ssuutt ssuutt!

[Hook]
The West Coast ain’t the same without me
Cause I'm packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
This how we do it in the LBC
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
Ssut ssut this is C.O.B
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
Turn it up let it vibrate the streets
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto

[Verse]
I’m from the hood where grandparents are 35
I don't bang, I hustle but still I’m certified
Last nigga who shot me, homie, I heard he died
Cause my address is 187 East Murder Drive
All the pain in the my past I gotta verbalize
It can’t stay on my head, I gotta circumcise
My tears drop on the song, they don’t prefer the eyes
A chick left me for that but that was her demise
Money cars and jewelry that shit had her astounded
She searched for the essence of me and bounced when she found it
I’m a complex figure, I’m a never ignorant getting goals accomplished
Grew up in a lot of projects, Loch Ness, hot mess nigga
On a conquest to digest liquor
In a contest to progress quicker
Than any in 2011, by making my thought process sicker
Bigger, stronger, faster
Homie tell me is it a fact
Through negative thoughts you can make yourself a prisoner
If so I call them thoughts some unwelcome visitors
Music is therapeutic, I’ma get help from listeners
I told you on "Sober Up", I don’t need therapy right
America’s nightmare carries a mic
And I stay far away from snake fake character types
I vow to never fuck with you like I married a dyke
Keep it real when I make a joint
Streets tried to break me, couldn’t find my breaking point
The other night I had a dream
I seen God he was a beam of light
His physical form was human being like
He gave me a couple of warnings in order for me to keep my life
Can’t tell you what but I can say that he was right
I dream 16's homie, I don't need to write
Pick up a pen in your session, I’m just trying to be polite
Cover my genius up cause rappers are envious
When I say I finished my verse they like “is he serious”
5 minute lyricist with an emphasis on a structure
Plus the details I describe in the sentences (ahh)
Mind you my timing better be live from the Genesis
I bet metaphors and one liners are limitless
First I’m on the West on some menace shit
Then the spit'll be in Italy in a gondola, on some Venice shit
Bars beyond bars has its benefits
I’m Favre, busted chin, fractured ankle
I don’t know when to quit (never)
And old rappers when you see me, don’t say "Hi"
They call me cause I’m fucking with Shady
I say "OK Bye!”

[Hook]
The West Coast ain’t the same without me
Cause I'm packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
This how we do it in the LBC
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
Ssut ssut this is C.O.B
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
Turn it up let it vibrate the streets
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
The West Coast ain’t the same without me
Cause I'm packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
This how we do it in the LBC
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
Ssut ssut this is C.O.B
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
Turn it up let it vibrate the streets
Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto

[Outro]
Y’all ready know man, motherfucking Horseshoe bang bang in the house
Pi, Remy, Iceman, P.W.T
It’s a motherfucking worldwide organization called ssuutt ssuutt C.O.B
Nah mean?
And you old niggas, don’t pick up the phone and call me no more
Cause you didn’t call me back then, so don’t call me right now
OK Bye!
BRRAP!
