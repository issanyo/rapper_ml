[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Can I get a witness?
Baby girl you hot, what's the bidness?
Eat you for breakfast, look at all your thickness
Trix are for kids, I'll fuck you with the quickness
Can't wait to bend the booty over
Stretch it out like you was doing yoga
K-9 you turn me to a Rover
Walking super vulgar like a stupid ogre
Buy you a drink like my name was T-Pain
Getting you drunk no that ain't the G game
I ain't gotta drop Visine in her drink man
Baby get horny as soon as the beat bang
Her name is Elaine and she's a freak thang
She secretly came when she gave me brain
Jumped in the sweet thing hit it so deep man
She put her house keys on my key chain
Damn baby never been that wet
C.O.B. she want to be from the set
Running out of breath making her sweat
She don't smoke but she lit a cigarette
Dick so good start acting crazy
That's when a nigga get Patrick Swayze
Maybe next week I'll get at ya baby
Then she sent me a text, you ain't have to play me
Naw baby doll I ain't acting shady
But I ain't got time for a nagging lady
Her fatal attraction trying to have my baby
Get mad enough to clap you with a black .380
Hoes don't know I'm a problem
Fly best friends, ménage à trois them
Fuck them hoes from the top to bottom
So west coast, rock Dodger condoms
Brand new titties yep, papa bought 'em
Colagen ass cheeks the doctor shot 'em
I don't give a damn if you real or fake
If you want weave at least believe go
Get it shawty

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Yeah sick ass rims all you hoes better know that
I'm only out to buy pussy magnets like Borat
Boy that whip got him going can't ignore that
Ass on the leather seats, Guiseppes on the floor mats
I broke the sluts soon as them legs open up
She can have Oprah bucks or even be broke as fuck
Sprinkle yay on the balls, call it coconuts
If she swallow during brains that's game she soaking up, what
Don't fuck with me I'm coo-coo dude
Put your bitch on Youtube nude
Nothing on just two new shoes
Million views while you boo hoo
That's what you get for that whoop whoop fool, ooh
She tattoo my name on her inner thigh
I shined knowledge on her, opened up her inner eye
Didn't I hit you with that stimuli
Yeah the Marines' slogan is semper fi
Mine's pimp or die biatch
Nigga fly see no reason to switch
I don't got to brush my shoulder off it's clean as a bitch
Peep it, treat the penis like broken English and shit
Slang it between the Venus and clit, mean as a pitt
Trying to find a whore, leave her pussy lining sore
Like [?] did for China and that vagina or
Like she getting hit from behind from some kind of dinosaur
Take off the designer Dior, let the lion roar
I'm getting money out the purses you copping a
I get around worse than 2Pac and the
Digital Underground, even if the dirty bitch popular
Hypnotize her mind like 36 Mafia
Have her in my kitchen cooking perch and tilapia
Why you spying on us nigga, word to binoculars
Do 'em bad in my amusement park
It gets mad if I abuse the heart
Wave six flags and surrender a pimp's art
Yeah I use the art
I kick back before the music start
Then hit that banging music soul child in a secluded locale
Dude is so wild
Got her posing like a nudist, she got the cutest profile
Then it's brains, I screwed this ho's beautiful smile
Crooked I yeah that's the boy
Fuck ya suck ya 'til I crash the toy
Get pussy down south like I'm Pastor Troy
From a chick who ass match Ki Toy
Dick jab fast as Roy
Jones, then I'm gone after I sex freaks
Tell you like I tell them, see you next week
