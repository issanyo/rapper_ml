[Crooked I]
It's Crooked I
Alumni
Dumb guy...

Retardaist
With the bars I just spit that leave you tongue tied
Getting Thai tongue from an Asian check in a plane mile high
How High? (that mean I even come fly)
Ruff rhymes over hard beats
Only reason that my heart beats
Wanna define Crooked I think hard speech
Born in the dark streets with fully loaded arms in my arm reach
Blammas under the car seats
Riding through Long Beach the part I call the far east (LBC)
I finding a strange urge
To be the best even though we rhyming the same words
Shining the same?(naw) Designing the same?(naw)
My timing you ain't heard
You signing the same nerds
Rappers wearing pink stretch pants, silk headbands, dirty red vans
On stage yelling lets dance
Weirdos in queer clothes get the best chance
Who created them mutha fuckas? I guess fans
Man I don't support you rookies
Trying to sound deep got that from a fortune cookie
I would slap them but they likely to tattle
Real niggas against fake like we in battle
This is how a boss do it
Last verse I recorded was on Kurt Cobain mic in Seattle
Flew to Cali did a deal for 300k
Then I flew to mamo blew sweet in the way
This will be the first day that im back in the states
Already in the booth going bat shit and apes
Like if im asking a bitch if her carpet matching her drapes
Its curtains for you pussies hair trigger clap in your face
Sway and Tech on Shade 45
Both sides of my family united now we reminded of a time
You had to really rhyme to just to get on
Can't come off the didome you get shit on
First show that I ever heard Em on
Crooked I first show you ever heard him on
Wake Up
