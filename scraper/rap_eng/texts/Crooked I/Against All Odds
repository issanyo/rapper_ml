[Intro]
There's a million motherfuckers out there that support this raw shit
This Slaughterhouse shit
All the time I'm thinking...

[Hook]
Hoping my true motherfuckers know
That the House Gang will never fold
Against all odds
I'm in my studio getting blowed
Watching rap niggas sell their soul

[Verse 1]
How did we end up here, got the Blueprint from Biggie and Nas
Ghetto niggas going platinum like the 50's and Ja's
It's against all odds
Should it be against yall broads
New niggas out here dressing like Nicki Minaj
Selling their soul to make it wealthy
Wearing women shirts and denim skirts on Instagram taking selfies
I celebrate the minute you die
And I'll be here after the firework, 5th of July
Here lies a fictional writer considered a liar
Always rapping about trapping and what actors did on The Wire
Then they ask me why I'm rapping like a killer for hire
Some niggas locked my homie in a truck and lit it on fire
You can I hear my life's pain in the way I spit
Think I give a fuck if a DJ play my shit?
Or like my shit, put it in a club, hype my shit
I write my shit Real niggas recite my shit
And your label they own you, that ain't no lease agreement
Please believe it, got you on your knees and screaming
Looking like you in the navy with a cold
Cause they dicks so far up your asshole you're sneezing semen
Then they put you on a single with the same niggas
On them other singles man ya'll just a bunch of lame niggas
You're hot now but how long will the shit last
If I don't feel your music I ain't rapping with your bitch ass (no)
And I bet I still won't come around broke
Rifles spitting hollow tips right out of his hundred round throat
When I'm buried six feet deep, counting eternal sheep
It'll all make sense, I'll be the underground GOAT nigga
Syllable king, lyrical dream, niggas be like typical memes
I'm killing your dreams, pop you in your bed dozing
My shooters come out the closet quick as Frank Ocean (Got ya)
I'm the illest lyricist of them all
I'm taking you niggas through lyrical training you ain't in my lane and
I'm giving a fuck if you think you a star
The bigger they are the harder they fall
I slip in a clip and I set the apocalypse off
Shots can lick off, your life'll get lost
And it'll be your own fault, remember your own role
Like a bitch with a dildo, you're digging your own hole
West Coast, my kingdom is there
I've been underground for years, you think I would care
Cause mainstream artists with bars you can count 'em with one hand
Still have a middle finger to spare, fuck 'em
I ain't hating I'm just telling the truth
When I see a real MC, I tell 'em salute
Against all odds...

[Hook]
