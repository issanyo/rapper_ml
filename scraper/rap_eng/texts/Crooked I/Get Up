Slaughterhouse…

[Intro]
...Presents, The Way It began
"Let’s see now
First thing I can remember is an evening years back
The four of us was together even then
And from that time on, nothing was ever gonna be quite the same again
Yeah, especially us"

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9”]
G-G-God given, I’m killin’ this bomb bidniz
I’m calling rap that because I put my time in it
I-I don’t mind being ready to die as long as this is at an arena
And we did it and my momma seen it
This is my arm swinging and my alarm ringing
Fighting against time but writing this song singing
"In light of my wallet just look how the mighty have fallen"
You fell for it, say bye to them, say hi to Ryan mature
I can’t (lose) ‘cause God won’t let me (lose)
Bet against me you can go (lose)
Anybody can tell you (nah) nah
I knew the cats knew I was down so I fell back
Hit the ground, landed on my feet vertical, fell back too, so you can (lose)
I will never lay down and (lose), I was definitely about to (lose)
Then Eminem came like (“nah”) “nah”
This shit is entertaining, listen to the shit they saying
Venom is spraying which is why all I know is
I’m on a all time ultimate high inspired by all time low

[Hook x4]
How quick are you gonna get up

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
In these days life is short, shots’a try to end you
And this game is like a sport, comp’ll try to pen you
I leave the stage on life support when I rock a venue
If you ain’t got a knife and fork you’re probably on the menu
If I ain’t make history before I left
It will be like using my last important breath before my death for snorting meth
More or less, I'm, Jordan-esque, I ignore the refs
I son you like you morphed into a Orphan yes
(Lose) Nah, I never (lose) yeah, you said I would (lose)
My destiny said (nah), homie you went against me
Foolish as Judas, nigga you’re lost
Now I’m feeling like Black Jesus, wrong nigga to cross won’t (lose)
If I refuse to (lose) the fact that I used to (lose) is making me say (“nah”)
This is how we attacking it, four rappers who passionate
Took the idea of a group and re-imagined it without planning it
Now the whole planet has to admit that’s the shit

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Everybody y'all invited to a crazy party
Have some fun, blocking the sun with the Shady Army
These women is feeling like skin, baby, they be on me
My flow water for sure, I’m a great tsunami
I’m with my awesome clique on another touring trip
From front of the stage all the way back to the door it's thick
Like secretly filming a mob, we recording hits
What a fucking lifestyle, maybe that’s why I'm on my dick
(Lose) Man, I ain't about to (lose) I don’t know how to (lose)
You beating the yaowa (nah) Mr. Ortiz I got you
Can’t find a reason not to, my ink, take 'em to church
Guess you could call it pentecostal, man Eminem told me (lose) yourself
So how can I (lose) focus, you roaches
(Lose) In combat so war? (nah), but if y’all need me to make it clear, for those slightly impaired
Like a flat in a snowstorm with no gas we ain’t going nowhere
We the sixty minute group, this year finna be our year!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
A mixture of showman and skill, imposing my will
A visionary, want me with my back to the ground, I ain’t with the missionary
Walk in my shoes and reap all of that I gain
Along with every invisible woe that accompanies fame
Louis Vuitton frames cover the scars that go with stardom
Got enemies that I birthed these bars are for Postpartum
So I tuck me the steal plate, they threatening me from behind a condom
But you can’t scream, fuck me! Then feel safe you just (lose)
Some people are praying I (lose), I thought I was set up to (lose)
Then Slaughterhouse came like (nah) nah
So I live by a real simple philosophy
If you stay grounded watch God keep giving you reasons not to be, can't (lose)
It’s not in my plan to (lose), if I still happen to (lose)
Is that even possible (nah), keep that out of my reach
Still I’m praying the shit get manifested
Let the flow stage dive and hope for the fans to catch it
If you ever persevered you should understand the message

[Hook]

[Outro]
The rest, what they say, is history
