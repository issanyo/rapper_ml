[Intro: Crooked I]
Yeah yeah, it's a new year
Hip Hop Weekly baby, we made it to 40
Hahaha, yes sir
Let's go
Can I talk to you?
I ain't gon' rap to y'all right now
I'm a talk to you
We call this talkin', haha
Start this year off right you know what I mean?
Yeah, let's start the year off right
It's 08 baby, we gon' begin 08 by puttin' some perspective in the air
You know? Yeah lemme holla at y'all man
It might sound like a rap, but I'm talkin' to you
It ain't a rap, I'm talkin' to you
Here we go, lemme talk, yo

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Yo, I'm drawin' pictures with every word that I'm usin'

Draw what you never saw while you draw your own conclusions
The world is crazy, look at the news it's confusion
And rebel views that I'm usin' in my music ain't for amusement
I let the words from my heart penetrate mics
Change the hood and I change, cuz art imitates life
Dog, I don't think your bark demonstrates bite
How ironic, we don't view the dark in the same light
I see yo' press people, packin' them Des Eagles
You see some evil doers who ain't makin' they bread legal

I see a whole country that was stolen from the red people
The whole press a treat us lesser even though we bled equal
That's why I love my shows, smiling faces from different races in the crowd
And it ain't a racist in the crowd
We raisin' the roof so high, the stage is in the clouds
Then it's back to the hood, where the racism is proud
Prejudice police wanna throw my crew in that Patty
Wagon, cuz we get our sag on, and hustle gladly
Momma say my father rocked jewelry and drove a Caddy
So even though he didn't raise me I'm stuntin' like my daddy
I'm buyin' diamonds with dough, I ice my cream
Know you consumers love hooks I'm doin' it like Kareem
Yeah, been in more crossfires than Chrysler's team
First I dream of what I recite then I recite my dreams
Listen, cuz dreams are real as the air we breathe
They put us in a good place, how dare we leave
Through the door of success the selfish barely squeeze
I kick the door open, make spares then I share these keys
It's hard work tryin' to chase whatever's considered to glitter
Nigga, it ain't no failures only quitters and bullshitters
So long before "Rest in Peace" is etched on my stone
Nigga, I bet I stay cross-legged out west on the throne
You heard it, the boss said it, one of the best spitters known
That vision is prophetic, yes, let's get it on, yes
I've been there before that's why I know what I'm doin'
I'm a old soul, older than ancient Minoan ruins
I was buried under volcanic ash, then I rose
Dusted off my clothes, first words I spoke, is "where the hoes?"
Back then I had golden threads woven in my robes
Now I hear "bling blaow" from diamonds glowin' in my lobes
I'm mind bafflin', time travelin' on all you losers
I'm presently the best and I'll make history in the future

[Outro: Crooked I]
Yeah, y'all know what it is
You know what we doin' right?
C-O motherfuckin' B ho
Treacherous
And I'm on the West Coast
My name is Crooked I thanks for listenin', yeah
I was just talkin' to ya today
It might of sound like rappin'
But it was really talkin'
Hip Hop Weekly baby, see you next week
