[Intro: Crooked I]
It’s been so long since hip-hop spoke to the problems of the world
Something’s going on
It’s like a conspiracy to stop us

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Nobody knows what goes on inside of me
So this time I’m rhymin’ out of my diary
See I ain’t scared of society or Bill O’Reilly
Get tyranny could never silence or even quiet me
I’m watching every step you make, every breath you take
I’m thinking F you snakes
I’m focused on the future, I wonder ‘bout my nephew’s fate
Probably worse than FEMA’s Katrina rescue rate
And I ain’t talking Crip or Blood when I say red-blue state
I mean Democrats and Repub’s, best educate
Yourself, ‘cause the drama’s real
And Fox News Corporation want Obama killed, keep it trill
Barack getting hated on by right-wing extremists
You’re hating on yourself ‘cause he’s half white you genius
You’re damn right, and Glenn Beck you redneck asswipe
You’re presently a dick and in your past life a penis
I mean it

[Hook: Sally Anthony]
And I know that something is going on
‘Cause we haven’t spoken for so long
It’s been so long

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Dear Mister President, it’s time to cut your charm off
Reachin’ across the aisle to those who will cut your arm off
The topic of public options set the alarm off
Look at the town halls, that was they downfall
They was supposed to be discussin’ health insurance, but they wasn’t
They was cussin’, “Hang that nigga by his brown balls”
I heard ’em screamin’ and I believe in freedom of speech
But I also believe in treason, so what’s the reason?
The people in Texas are stressin’ succession? Answer that question
The answer is complexion, it ain’t perplexin’
They never wanted to see a black man move America the right direction
Stop the war and fight recession
I represent for my citizens who don’t have a chance
Can’t afford a dental plan or a ride in an ambulance
For my soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan
Hope you don’t get tortured by the Taliban
‘Cause we waterbordin’ it’s so important, man

[Hook]

[Outro: Sally Anthony & (Crooked I)]
Can I ask you somethin’?
Have you changed or are you the same?
(Let me know)
