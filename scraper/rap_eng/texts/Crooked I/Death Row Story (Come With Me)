[Intro:]

Yeah, everybody always ask me what the hell
Made me sign with Death Row Records
But I survived the drought nigga
It was a hustla move boy
I got love for Suge
It's a business I understand it completely
I ain't bitter cuz my album didn't drop
I'm just my own boss now, feel me?
I got fucked by other labels nigga
Virgin, with a name like Virgin
Who thought they'd ever fuck you

[Verse 1:]

They said you signed with Death Row
Crooked you was crazy
But I'm all about my paper route
Tell me, who could blame me?
They told me not to sign with Big Simon
Dude was shady, I laughed at em'
Hopped in the Mercedes doing 80
I never thought of doing biz with the Row in the past
Til' I was approached by Big C-Style and Daz
Was on Virgin with the Luniz but that didn't last
Suge was locked up but I heard he was givin' cash
I jumped on the plane for an hour
I hit the penitentiary discussed my contract under the gun tower
I figured I'd move through this industry with thug power
I'm down to ride I've never been a young coward
So now I rock the Death Row chain when I bell out
Thangs ain't the same mayne, Suge and Daz fell out
Daz left, I stayed he called me a sell out
I only stayed to get my records put the hell out

[Chorus: 2x]

Come with me I'm Crooked I from the LBC
I gotta get my money now baby Imma ride or die
Lalalalalalalala

[Verse 2:]

I'm still on Death Row cuz I ain't finished yet
My nigga Daz poppin' trash on the internet
I chose to feed my family now the beef is in effect
My homie strapped up and hit them wet cigarettes
He said I could't come to the beach no mo'
Not knowin' I lived in LB the whole time that I was on Death Row
Threatened to take my life, I said lets go
I had the nine in my lap ready to let go
Before the guns flash I saw the blast vivid
But I got love for Daz, so I stopped at the last minute
Caught him comin' outta Poly High
And I was that wit it, who took me to Death Row?
Daz did it, a lot of friends became foes
It's deeper than people think
When Suge got out of the clink we linked with Murder Inc
Now I'm doin' videos with Ashanti rockin' a mink
Gotti put me on when I was on the brink of being extinct
And my stock rose swiftly, before Ja was at war wit 50
Before Simon bought the black Bentley
Killers in my hood was plottin' to come get me
I hope my album drop quickly, damn

[Chorus: 2x]

Come with me I'm Crooked I from the LBC
I gotta get my money now baby Imma ride or die
Lalalalalalalala

[Verse 3:]

See this wasn't the first time I had to buy a gun
I hit them streets as a baby, man I was ridin' young
So now I shoot when the wind blows, I ain't tryna run
I slept with my bible, opened to psalms 91
I had to cut my bushes down so nobody could hide in em'
These killas who hate the Row and I collide with em'
So Crooked I's keepin' a chrome 45 with em'
Caught a gun case and went to jail cuz I ride with em'
And everybody that I started out with in this industry
Looks at me like an enemy when I enter the vicinity
Only and handful of real niggas was friends to me
While y'all was hatin' on me endlessly
I seen Makaveli's ashes, it remains in the urn
Pac thought us something, when will we learn?
My dead homies never seen me shinin' it's my turn
I'm tryna teach you something, when will you learn, you see

[Break:]

It ain't all about that bullshit, it's all about money nigga
We supposed to be gettin' this money
Daz Dillinger you need to holla at me
Snoop Doggy Dogg remember on the eastside
At Chucky Miller's studio when we was freestylin'
To Murda Was The Case instrumentals
When [?] Dog brought you through
You told Big C-Style if he wanted to make it in this game
He needed to fuck with me, lets not forget that mayne
We need to all sit at the round table and discuss this money
But who am I, me and Suge need to sit at the round table
And discuss this money, but who am I, yeah, you know who I am

[Chorus: 2x]

Come with me I'm Crooked I from the LBC
I gotta get my money now baby Imma ride or die
Lalalalalalalala

[Outro:]

We better get it together
Lets get it together
