[Intro:]
You know if I could sing man
I'd be on some gangsta shit with my shit man
I'd be on some shit like some ghetto gutta shit
I need all you crooners to listen up
I need R. Kelly and Usher to get on my level
You know what I'm saying fuck with me on this one

[Verse:]
I'm always in the streets tryin' to get my dough
I don't give a fuck about a crazy Ho-o-o
Not a crazy ho, Not a crazy ho (Me neither nigga)
Met a thick bitch at the club Rio
With a big ass like Buffie next thing you know-ow-ow
I got a crazy ho, got a crazy ho
(How you know she crazy, how you know?)
Cause I was in the hood tryin' to get my mail
She called me straight trippin' on my god damn Ce-e-ell
You crazy ass female, crazy ass female
(Ha Ha Ha, I told you nigga! I told you!)
We only been fuckin' for ten days
You already bitch about my hustling wa-a-ays
Shorty what the hell, shorty what the hell
(Cash over bitches, man, C.O.B.)
You like the presidential suite
(I told ya!)
You like that Benz or Fe
(Ha Ha I told ya!)
I take ya nice places to eat
(Yeah!)
Buy you lingerie to skeet-skeet-skeet
No ho before my cash
All I wanted to do was doggy style that big ol' ass
Sorry it did not last
If you thought it would then your higher than the price of gas

[Outtake:]
I told you man, these bitches be trippin' man
They want all the motherfucking money
All the motherfucking trips to Cancun and shit
But they don't want a nigga hustlin'
They wanna lay up under a nigga every single second, man
Listen Ma, I can't lay up under you every second
I got business to handle, I thought you knew, C.O.B
Conducting Organized Business, Cash Over Bitches!
And that's just the way the story go
Ay, Ginuwine make your comeback nigga, get on this level
Call them niggas at BMI and tell them I'm available for songwriting
R&B song writing that is
