[Intro]
Slaughterhouse
Yo Ice man, I think we need to do part 2 though

[Verse 1]
I did it every Wednesday
Niggas saying Crooked I about to bring that ‘Hip Hop Weekly’ back, nah
Long as whack niggas still shining
I'mma be wherever hip hop need me at
Mega-lyrical and then I get political
Like Fela Kuti bringing his dashiki back
I love listening to white boys spitting
I've been doing that shit ever since I first heard Beastie's rap
Black, yellow, white, brown, purple
I don't care just body a beat remember
It's always somebody better than you
And you better believe that somebody is me remember
I'm making this freestyle shit look easy
So they say I must be constantly thinking about it
Dreaming about it people will doubt it
But it is easy to me
I want the head of the goat and hell no I ain’t leavin' without it
Failure is not in the plan
Go ahead hater try to block if you can
They say it ain't over until the fat lady sing
So I'm walking with the bitch voice box in my hand
Time on my side like a clock in my pocket
I ain’t in a rush cause the clock just began
Timing is everything I'm chilling like a Rollie
In a hourglass man I'm just watching the sand
First I'mma shove Slaughterhouse down your mouth
Till you finally understand we the best in the industry
Then I'mma start shooting niggas on a solo tip
So labels better put a vest on the chest of my enemies
Cause your roster in danger, we taking over
Never seen me coming like I'm fucking with the lights off
How do you deal with a rapper so hungry that even if the wind blow
It'll knock my stomach on the sidewalk?
You won't deal, you don't deal
Cause nobody could stop me, nobody could top me
All they could do is go study the album
And Xerox the flow after they go buy them a copy
West coast, Chuck Taylor kamikaze
Motherfucker just call me the Low-Rider Qaddafi
Puttin' that work out, pushing so much weight
That nobody could spot me, you nobody, you not me

[Outro]
How many niggas do we have to come and get?
How many rappers do we have to come and kill?
SLAUGHTER
