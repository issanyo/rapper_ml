[Sample]:
It's so good
It's so good
(Reasonable)
It's so good

[Verse One] [Nino Bless]:
Nino!
Ayo, it's so good how I do this
Your flow is Sarah Palin stupid which don't pertain to my music
Content, I constantly rock shit, I rhyme sick
You just rhyme sick like stick, slick
Simple one syllable ass rapping shit for brains
I'm like the new Big Daddy Kane minus the pimping thang
A young Rakim minus the sniffing cane
A young G. Rap on these Roads To Riches switching lanes
The kids insane, raising the stakes soon
I blaze tunes to make the elephant change rooms
And I can't wait till I drop
Watch rappers get shook like Mickey Factz in a room with Rae's goons
Ice Water, mic's I slaughter
You will never see me in no one's shadow like Night Crawler
I'm 5'4" with an Eiffel height aura
Sneaking into your top five now put it in size order
You hearing Nino's flow on tracks and (it's so good)
Damn, huh
These cats is all hype but ain't killing the mic feel me (yeah)
Yo Crook we going innnnn

[Crooked I]:
I'm ill
I'm dope, coke in a pill
Promethazine before you open the seal
Thought I told you the deal
Like you rappers wanna play for the Lakers, you older than Phil
A logo on the back of my Jordans, you over the hill/heel
You in the 80's with them really shitty rhymes
I'm in 2029 so that should give me plenty time
To relax, how you gonna catch me with itty bitty lines?
Like Biggie in Brooklyn, New Yiddy the city's really mine
I'm on a mission to hit you with rap terrorism
Come in the booth when I record is the last exorcism
The new revolution we snuck it past television
Put it on the Internet, hip hop's last mechanism
When I'm spitting the track is finished, the rapping menace
The drop battle when bodies academics
You wanna flip like me?
Go grab you a spatula after that add a gymnast
Crooked is back just to hang with business

[Cambatta]:
Yo I roll with a Crooked I/eye like Stuart Scott
Like the reunion of Snoop and 'Pac
I'm truly the only future this music's got
I'm super/souper hot when I'm rhyming/Ramen you get your noodle rocked
Get it? Soup/Ramen/noodle...ha
Intergalactic, cynical bastard with criminal tactics
Flipping on the pissiest mattresses
While maintaining my residual averages
It's going down like genital flaccidness
I keep spitting till I'm living in lavishness
And you the nigga I'm tipping, delivering packages
I'm living my lyrics I'm really this hazardous
I'll spit at your spirit and shit in your casket kid
I'm speaking it deep, I'm Tone Loc'in'
And I'm Rosa Parking the seat if I ever see the throne open
Dro smoking, I'm high as hell
And Heaven is my landlord, repping what I stand for
I grab a pint bottle Hennessy
5 Hour Energy
Several machine guns and drive up to Tennessee
Cut my finger prints off to hide my identity
If I get caught, say I'm T.I. and they'll let me free
I got 'em ducking like Fantasia's voice
Only nigga you never heard that can hang with Royce
Only nigga you never heard that every words ill
So never let never occur, lesson learned

[Sha Stimuli]:
They say my rhymes are good, my beats are bad
My girl's a bitch my wife is mad
I'm switching flows and hitting hoes with Different Strokes and there you have
The Facts Of Life, the raps I write were sorta kinda half way nice
But now I'm just adapting like this parasital appetite
My last years free styles that you saw?
That was like Kobe in '97 shooting air balls in Utah
Now I'm under new law, I'm too raw, use more
Brain power like an insane mouth on a huge broad
I'm in the booth war with everyone you swore
Was hotter with they rappidy rappy raps, I abuse y'all
Rupaul, U-Haul, drag queens move a lot units but I promise I keep doing what I'm doing and win
I'm the center of attention
I'm the sinner not repenting for his sins
I'll send these corny rappers to Hell if I can find a cheap ticket
Put your soul on a hitch to your spirit, y'all don't get it

[Big Moss]:
Yo
Big Moss the Philly's own, hip hop's heavyweight
I'm forcing nature, spitting flows until them fucking levee's break
Meditate, getting in they minds spitting sicker rhymes
Jefferson hairline nigga because I'm getting shine
Step off, like you beefing in fraternities
You heard of me, your new songs and bars don't even worry me
Sick of niggas claiming they the shit, don't worry B
I'll play a gentleman and give your shit the courtesy
Flush
You out of here with that weakness
Dick down a slut throat and leave the ho speechless
Cam
All these niggas wishing they could be this
Come across my zone nigga, Darrelle Revis
I shut 'em down ain't no running back
A knife to a gun fight? What you gonna do with that?
You bring that wack rap, guns go rat tat
In a row dawg like a soldier in Catstack
