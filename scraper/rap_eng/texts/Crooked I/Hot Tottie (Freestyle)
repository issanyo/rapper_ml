[Verse 1: Crooked I]

They call me chase money copy
Original I never copy
Heard about them what you know about me?
Hundred miles on the V, I'm a Southern Cal G
Me and little momma took a trip to South Beach
Now we rocking matching watches, talking 20 thou each
Whoever said it ain't tricking is only tricking they self
Can't tell me nothing different
But I rather see you sitting in the jacuzzi
Me and you by the pool sipping Ace of Spades
Mainly cause Jay said it's cool
Know a few chicks that like to swing, awesome
What you still standing here for? Go and call some
Call Rose, call Daisy, call Blossom
They don't need clothes, let the body painter draw some
Long Beach was the place, I hit it Doggystyle man
Murder Was The Case
She licking on Rose
While Rose got Daisy on her face
Tasting the lethal weapon under her waist
Blossom in the corner, she knows she's desert
Everywhere I go I keep a bad b-word
California Ferrari, I'm dipping down Sunset
A thug and a thugette, the usual suspect
Baby in a summer dress, she told me her stuff wet
Me, my dick is hard and we ain't even hugged yet
Staring at each other, I wonder if we in love yet
Two free souls, we doing what we does best
Smoking cigars, pick up mami and ride
We Michelle and Barack, we retired Bonnie and Clyde
Even though I got the Tommy in sight (pow pow)
No navigation, I'll be your guide, follow me
We go walk into the club, hit em with a two step
No more Ciroc but we got some Grey Goose left
And y'all dudes better respect her cause I'ma protect her
Consider me her bullet proof vest
My kinda broad, she rocking designer bras
I knocked her vagina walls
Then it's time to find my drawers, I'm gone
She ain't mad, she know daddy trying to ball
Getting paper on the corner like I'm slanging final calls
While I'm gone on the grind just keep rubbing it
And when I come back we let the neighbours know my government
She got the C.O.B. tat and I'm loving it
Ssuutt Ssuutt don't violate the covenant
#OKBYE
