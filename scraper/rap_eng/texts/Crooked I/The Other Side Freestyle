I was born in a god forbidden ditch; Piss Poor
Had a cool jumpshot but I wasn't 6'4"
All I used to wish for was a 64
To be someone these mixed whores wouldn't ignore
A snotnose snatching purses and stealing bikes
Had knowledge to sell, my moms was a israelite
By 15 gangbangers tried to end my life
By 16 I was shooting pistols in the night
If I had to write a autobiography
It'd only be one sentence -- I'm a G
Dead or in the penitentiary is where I should be
But like a rolex time piece I'm clockin' G's
Cause they can't get enough of the sinister flow
Witness the glow, God rap let the minister know
They had to let the lyricist in the do'
Getting dough, kinda dough that make a friend of a foe
This industry is like an innocent ho, backwards
Spitting wack words, niggas will blow
Here we go, I'm constructing pyramids in your dome
While I'm killing this show
Cause every line is infinite as an O, oh
I guess my life's a bitch huh?
Slaughterhouse ain't gone platinum I'm supposed to jump off of a bridge huh
I'm supposed to slit open my wrists huh
A number one billboard platinum black ass to kiss huh
For money nah I can't underachieve
So like growing up with gangsters I came up with g's
The deck stacked against me, got an ace up my sleeve
So winning is not in the cards, winning the game's up to me
They coming for my head, don't let the game circumcise ya
How can my grass be greener we use the same fertilizer
Everybody's a hoodlum, niggas ain't even Muslim
And they passing on the pig gang they ain’t heard Elijah
Shout out to FOI's and the 5'ers
I'm living my life behind this mic
Ironic trying to make my life liver
So I meditate 'til my head is straight
Sometime I feel like my damn mind is a landmine that can detonate
Surrounded by suckers let em hate
Knowing them fuckers is probably pussy as the dinner plate Ellen ate
I’m in a state where everybody stressed out
Walking with they chest out what the fuck the west 'bout
You dad left out, your brother in the pen stretched out, your little sister fuckin everybody sexed out
So she got a gang of kids running round a shack as small as a guest house
And their’s Crooked on that red couch, chucks on the coffee table watching TV, But really the TV screen is watching me think
How can I get money and stay out the precinct?
Every cop that arrested me can suck a beef link
I freestyle so much I don’t even need ink
Demeanor is so serious they ask me do you at least blink?
Before the weight of my body left an imprint on the couch seat cushion
I left the house I had to keep pushing
