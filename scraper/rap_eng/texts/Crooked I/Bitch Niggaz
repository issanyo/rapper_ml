You know what's mind bothering
Niggas be acting like bitches, you know
Man why you sign to Death Row?
Get out my business bitch
Man why you leave Death Row?
Nigga, it's always business, it's never personal homie
Get it right

I see you motherfuckers, I see you over there
And I know you wanna fuck with me
I got my eyes on you suckers
But I don't really care
Cause I keep a burner tucked with me

Yeah, niggas is unaware
I'm their worst fucking nightmare
Send shots to the night air cause I don't fight fair
Watch you die right there, without a slight care
Like: "Yeah nigga, youse a snake"
Type of nigga that get mad over the moves you make
Look at the rules you break
You choose to hate, shake your friend when he loose his cake
You dudes is fake, bitch niggas
When the guns cock, choose your fate
Click triggers, when I bust Glocks, loose your face
Ditch diggers, with one shot, its news at eight
We six figure, then a thug got loot to chase
A rich nigga, we ballin' while you fuckers in the drought
Cause if it ain't about the money, tz, what the fuck is it about
Catch me in them beach houses, straight thuggin' in the south
With my nigga Humpty Hump, punchin' you suckers in the mouth
Droppin' a matter frightenin' rate
Striking at lightning's pace, one slice, your lungs pipes deflate
Mad at me cause your ice is fake
I got B.O.S.S. written across my license plate
Life is great, bitch nigga

I see you motherfuckers, I see you over there
And I know you wanna fuck with me
I got my eyes on you suckers
But I don't really care
Cause I keep a burner tuck with me
