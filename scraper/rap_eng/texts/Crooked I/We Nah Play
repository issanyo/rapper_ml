It's 'ey, C.O.B now

I SAID COB NOW
I said C.O.B

Yah lord lord

[Verse One: Banish]
Yeaaah
I move heads with lines, traffic outta the south
Kill and not ask’n questions later, that’s what we about
Done with shit i sit on the TV and watch the couch
Y’all should rap in the mirror and watch what comes outta your mouth
We the sickest Cali killers ill, without a doubt
You at the bottom of a pile at a hoarder’s house
Sorta foul I breath disease, it’s cold madness
Faggots should all rot in the closet like old jackets
Bitch’s get it they half ta have it
Half of em tragic another forty five percent is pass’n off Magic
And they not worthy dirty like a buried casket
Trash and ask’n why I shot ya dogs, they bite’n rabid
Ride classics, if we roll you gonna get it
Pull up in more bowties than a Nation of Islam mission
Enough bars to build us a damn prison
No way outta what we movin that’s Crooked and Ban spittin listen

[Hook: Beenie Man]
Ay
Bad Man We Nah play
Make money everyday
Girls at mi feet
A ta mi them a pray
We run tings from New York to LA
So swagarific gyal change everyday
Aaaaaay
We Nah play
Cause we nah say
If a no stage show
Mi stay where mi deh
We run tings from LA ta JA
Play this one more time mi DJ heyyyyy (hey, hey, hey)

[Verse Two: Crooked I]
Crooked’s an animal run for your life when he spit it
I think in HD you riders just try ta be vivid
Radical intellectual, society’s critic
When I retire my career I might try ta relive it
Ridiculous bitches they think I’m a lottery ticket
Accuse me of cheating I’m pimp’n I probably did it
I don’t give a fuck that’s my philosophy get it
A mix between Pac and Saukrates rockin a fitted
Nigga with a attitude Crooked I is Eazy
Mural on my four hookers look at my graffiti
So much candy paint the car got sugar diabetes
Gun under the seat my bullets, ride beneath me
Shot ya the loud mouth’s are so silent
Never sleep on a beef I’m like no eyelids
Who’s flows the flyest oh mine is
And don’t forget Banish nigga, my co-pilot

[Hook: Beenie Man]
Ay
Bad Man We Nah play
Make money everyday
Girls at mi feet
A ta mi them a pray
We run tings from New York to LA
So swagarific gyal change everyday
Aaaaaay
We Nah play
Cause we nah say
If a no stage show
Mi stay where mi deh
We run tings from LA ta JA
Play this one more time mi DJ heyyyyy (hey, hey, hey)

[Verse Three: Banish]
We CA like the 5 freeway all day
Not one of these fools dance’n act’n like kids that play
Funny style my suggestion is that you stay away
We run things from JA to LA everyday
Everybody say something from a keyboard
You could have Dirty and Pun in your squad and not be large
Oh lalalaa
Or be hard I’m why the West bout ta be mad
Some of the realist in this state
Let us find you a pad
Pussy pop you then you bleed’n need more than a pad
Criminal scientist mad how I be locked in the lab
They advanced still outta touch like an old phone
Take they ice and cream and leave 'em under a Cold Stone
Well known if I clinch a fist I’m plenty pissed
Bear in mind that I instinctually grizzly this
Dizzy bitch grin’n wanted that blast on her back
That’s when I smash her crack and splash before I dash and laugh

[Bridge: Beenie Man]
Oh
This is dangerous
Uuh
Don’t fuck around I’m serious
Diss me right now my gun will bust
And your friends dem body be pilling up

Oh
Beenie Man is a genius
My whole lifestyle luxurious
The phantom rolls royce mi drive it fas
And don’t fuck around my gun will buss
Anyway

[[Hook: Beenie Man]
Ay
Bad Man We Nah play
Make money everyday
Girls at mi feet
A ta mi them a pray
We run tings from New York to LA
So swagarific gyal change everyday
Aaaaaay
We Nah play
Cause we nah say
If a no stage show
Mi stay where mi deh
We run tings from LA ta JA
Play this one more time mi DJ heyyyyy (hey, hey, hey)]
