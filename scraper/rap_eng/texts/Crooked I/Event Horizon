[Verse 1: Psiklone]
My tongue catches fire as it unleashes
I meditate in subzero climates 'till my blood freezes
Hunt cheaters in training sessions
We're drug dealers that shot keys to the gates of heaven - so pay attention
Cut you down to size wit scissor kicks
I'm lifting Egyptian pyramids with my finger tips
I rob holy prophets to pay for my sins
Time flies but not since I amputated its wings
I’m a fire breathing Siamese
Dragon from a lost dynasty that travelled to this mic in a time machine
Locked in crossfire of sniper beams
Catch 22 bullets and throw 11 back at twice the speed
Check my mental logistics
My lexicon holds every language that’s ever existed
I sacrificed disciples in ancient churches
Swam back from Atlantis for a lifetime to break the surface

[Hook]
You don’t wanna fuck with us (RA)
Cos you know that we coming up (Our Way)
Said you don’t wanna fuck with us (RA)
We take it far beyond
Rather burn twice as bright for half as long

[Verse 2: Possessed]
Get a load of this (Holy Shit)
I ejaculate sperm whales out of my Moby Dick
I regard earth with envious eyes
I’m my own worst enemy like Jekyll and Hyde
Ahead of my time no burial site
I’m expected to die when the devil is blind
Vengeance is mine
Cannibalistic, I got a finger in every pie
You get outshined and put in the shade
Found out my Achilles heel put that one foot in the grave
Alive and kicking
Gave planes the same co-ordinates, look skyward for flight collisions
Got you open like a Y Incision
Keep friends close and enemies in striking distance
Defecate on your final resting place
Fight me; and need braces to set ya dental record straight

[Hook]
You don’t wanna fuck with us (RA)
Cos you know that we coming up (Our Way)
Said you don’t wanna fuck with us (RA)
We take it far beyond
Rather burn twice as bright for half as long

[Verse 3: Skirmish]
[RA] connects with the best in the west coast
Visited by an escape convict from death row
[Murderous] dressed in a trench coat
After killings, my trademark for death is a red rose
Living legend even if I happen to die
Cos best rapper alive will be etched on my headstone
I penetrate pressure points
Giving listeners vivid images when I project my voice
Lusting blood, as my mouth salivates
We coming up, every underdog has its day
Muzzles off, and all love is lost
So I have to play my part in acts of hate
Decapitate you as you gasp for breath
Cost you an arm and leg to pay your last respects
If you’re nobody ‘till somebody kills you?
I’m ready to die and live a life after death [Yes]

[Hook]
You don’t wanna fuck with us (RA)
Cos you know that we coming up (Our Way)
Said you don’t wanna fuck with us (RA)
We take it far beyond
Rather burn twice as bright for half as long

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
On the microphone I’m chemical explosives, mixed in high doses
Sick as psychosis and Cystic Fibrosis
Touch me and die my energy’s high voltage
When I wrote this Hennessey had my mind focused
Every rhyme I write becomes my new magnum opus
Pointing a chrome magnum at whoever rap the dopest
You cats are hopeless matter of fact, fags are bogus
Snap your neck backwards maggot, I’m that ferocious
Crooked sick in the head hit you with lead
Pistols flashing like cameras I can picture you dead
Might grab a knife stick you instead
Since he ain’t stand up nigga, the feds found him missing his legs
I’m on the balcony practising ancient alchemy
Vest on the chest in case they try to Martin or Malcolm me
I know you think I love myself
Because this straight jacket is making me hug myself (Fuck It)
