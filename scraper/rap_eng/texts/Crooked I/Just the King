[Verse 1: Crooked I]

Crooked sharp as a free mason
Freestyling for my G nation
If you ain't saying free Tray Dee you free basin'
I'm cheese chasin' and I'm erasin'
These wack mcs racing away from me as if they seen Jason
Ribs are touching
I'm an animal, end of discussion
A rap cannibal, spitting is nothing
And I'm eating like I got a mechanical mandible
Picture a glutton
Sick to the stomach from chewing niggas I'm hunting
The smorgasbord is gorgeous
Tell me how the hell can you ignore this artist
Proud as hell to be out of your orbit
Cowards fell short to metaphors harder than rigamortis
'Bout hard as the outer shell of a tortoise
Welcome to the Eastside playground
Pistols get off and bust soon as visitors get off the Greyhound
My clique is deep as the 808 bass sound
It ain't now way you haters ain't getting layed down
Fill up clips, niggas get hit up quick
Then what, we ain't send up split
Since you are what you eat, eat a dick up prick
Zip up lips and watch this former stick-up kid rip up shit
X marks the spot, the hardtop XK
X marks when I'm in that parking lot
I'm hard to stop
Leather bomber, hoodie outlined in arctic fox
I think outside of the largest box
Therefore through my positive actions I draw positivity back to me
That's the law of attraction (ayy)
Whatever's in motion it tends to move further
So I keep it moving on haters, that's the law of inertia
Don't make me teach you about the law of revenge
Merc you and all your friends then call it a binge
Put the sawed off in the wind
You can tell the officer I sped off in a Benz
With the awesomest rims
Clean your shades, see the image of a boss in your lens
Yeah a boss let the raw shit begin
When I drop my album it's off with your chin
This is for my real niggas locked in the pen
