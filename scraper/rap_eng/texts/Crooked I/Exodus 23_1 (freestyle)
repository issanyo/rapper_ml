Crooked I this is an introduction
You only talk about balling pardon the interruption
Rappers talking about balling my life is in this discussion
Them niggas really ain't nothing look at all the shit I'm crushing
I'm vomiting lava like the flow is a sick eruption
I feel with hustlin, corruption and every bitch I'm fuckin
I feel with thuggin strugglin and heavy pistol tuckin
In luxury trucks, call it double dutch every chick gon jump in
Respiratory machine, that's when I let that bitch breathe
These niggas wanna get prolix with the firearm-aholic
Call it money on the ground, when the choppa knock you on yo wallet
Call it hydraulics when the impala llama lift you in the air
People stepping over your body cause don't nobody care
About your dead ass i'm that ass and the game bang cap ya dome
Platinum going rappers know tuck that cause jackers be snatching those
And i paid my dues as far as rapping and trapping goes
But if Eminem don't help me go platinum then its back to clapping hoes
And riding dirty why beat around the bush
Im with three felons four guns and eleven pounds of kush
In my baby mamma's beamer
Wanna X this profession but maybe i'm a dreamer
That inception direction ugh
Never thought id get my change up like this again
If you hear a click before i answer hang up they listening
Eaves dropping the streets and the d's watching
To eat and receive guap only leaves me with these options
To thieve or get weed popping no retreat so i keep rocking
Heat cocking till i can no longer breathe keep the beat knocking
And let em know that this is slaaaaauuuugggghhhhhttteerr house gang bang
Mommy sucked the dick of a rider
Thats why shes got a higher sperm count than my semen in her saliva
Respiratory machine i had to let that bitch breathe
These niggas talking that beef life talking that street life
Should be talking peace life my pistol eats life
Fuck nigga what that beach like
The skys triple black we under street lights
Ready to die for eachother
Like snoopy told yo ass on deep cover
This long beach california
Yeah tell em again nigga
This long beach california
