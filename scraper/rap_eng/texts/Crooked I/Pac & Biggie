[Hook: Crooked I]
I got my whole city with me
Ridin’ through the Beach in my hard-top Bentley
I got smoke in my lungs, liquor in my kidneys
When I leave the game, they gon’ mention my name like Pac and Biggie
Greatest of all time, greatest of all time
When I leave the game, they gon’ mention my name like Pac and Biggie
Greatest of all time, greatest of all time
When I leave the game, they gon’ mention my name

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Because it’s C.O.B. everything, homies know the meaning
Caucasian or black, Chicano or Belizean
My father never knew that he had million-dollar semen
I had to find a way in, got more family than Kenan
Drugs in my duffle, bitch I’m on my hustle
Stay armed like a bicep, but goons are my muscle
Grind plus hustle like Scrappy let’s call it Grustle
I’m doing business with Asians, ése’s and Bloods, cuz-o
Throne on the West Coast, that’s what I’m the heir to
No one can compare to me, I say what you scared to
I don’t dance much, and motherfuck a funny hairdo
Listen hear dude, I’m on my grizzly and you bear food
Yeah, the kid grew up in the hellhole
Took that fire, put it on tracks minus the railroad
How many joints in your elbow?
Your arm? Hell no
An elbow’s a pound of weed for sale though, and yo

[Hook: Crooked I]

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Legendary as Pac and Biggie, Harry O and Ricky
Selling sounds all them pounds, the stereo are sticky
Is it rapper trap-money? The scenario is tricky
Either way that it go, when I’m buried you won’t forget me
No matter what you heard it’s my mu’fuckin’ dominion
Take your asshole and shove it up your opinion
The menacin’ flow, even my nemeses call me the genesis
Cause I’ve been the truth from the beginning
I’m bar-raising, Cuban cigar-blazing
White European whip: call it my Car-casian
From starvation to becoming the leader of a dark nation
Move quiet like I’m part-Mason
My hood credit is good, I’m that Visa
I move through the belly of the beast like magnesium
You could be a star, I'mma be a tsar
Black Cesar, forget it, I’m iller than amnesia
Remember?

[Hook: Crooked I]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
I’m on my Long Beach shit (alcohol in my diet)
A Mafioso outlaw (a Somalian pirate)
I’m a Molotov cocktail (involved in a riot)
Flames burn you fuck boys (‘til all of ya quiet)
C.O.B. on that Junior M.A.F.I.A. shit for real though
In this bitch deep like an 18-inch dildo
Haters check my passport (Boss!)
I could put everything you own in my Jag Sport (Boss!)
This is a man’s sport
You got to have an iron stomach
Or you’ll plummet from the highest summit
The top I see bodies flying from it
I love this game, I just study the science of it
The Third Messiah coming, 100
Let me tell you again nigga
