[Crooked I]
Pay attention
This time the revolution will be televised
Skee Live, Skee Live buzzin' like a bee hive
Crooked, East side
Freestyle, I do it off the top
I hear you freestyle, but y'all ought to stop
I'm a bullet proof vest, you a Halter Top
Lyrically Christopher Dorner, y'all call the cops
Tell 'em, here come the Apex Predator
The Magnum flow for you latex measurers
I break necks for pay checks
The game's best dead or alive I thought I told you
I shit when I rap nigga, call that a bar stool
Without a pen or a pad, leave that for art school
Taking you on a ride, I call it car pool
This industry is a body, Crooked the heart fool
I blast off, I start spitting repetitions as Black Thought
This epidemic is gettin' vicious in this business, niggas leakin' that wack sauce
Still I leak semen on models like I jacked off on the Catwalk
The cast talk, you bullshitters start walkin'
Cause all too often MCs spit in the dark coffin
In Hell the chronic is start coughin'
While I leave these MCs parked off in
Sleepin' with the fishes, I'm with it, with the business when niggas smart talkin'
The way I'm selling these bars is a art auction
Audemars, watches of all kind
I rather be the Rollie, greatest of all time
These rappers killin' ya with pedophilia
Fuckin' with them nursery rhymes
Let my verse rewind
Bullets blasted from a gun, how I shoot to give
Third planet from the sun, that's where I rule and shit
And I know I rap about my hammer too much
I told Hammer, I should quit
He said nah, you too legit
That's why I keep the hammer in my Levis
Signed to Eminem, now I'm fucking up Skee Live

[Outro]
Off The Top
Stop this shit
Hip Hop
