I'm (I’m-I’m) I’m having a good time
Money, money, money, money, I'm having a good time
Money, I'm (I’m-I’m) I’m having a good time
Money, money, money, money, I'm having a good time
Money, I'm (I’m-I’m) I’m having a good time

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
You can find me weaving through the traffic
These niggas is G's; put your fingers on my keys
And leave with just your sleeve
I'm a bottom-line hustler, dirty-minded MC
So don't try to mindfuck me: you'll leave with a disease
This is power in this 26-hour bitch, our clique
Prowls like we trying to mix vowels with bowels
I outsmart niggers like Dilla did
Call it South Park cause every time I have an episode I kill a kid
I'm old school, so the car’s stolen
Fuck trap, I’m ‘bout to take it back to when they used to call it rolling
Now that the ball is rolling, I'm feeling like all is golden
I used to be a small fry, now I'm showin’ you the
(Money, money, money)
Tippin’ like I'm sippin’ and I'm just getting sloppy
I'm drinking like my liver thinkin’ “Shit, my kidney got me.”
My wrist is looking real Whitney watch-y
The bitches try to stop me, but I'm real wishy-washy
‘Cause I got

Money, money, money, money, I'm having a good time
Money, I'm (I’m-I’m) I’m having a good time
Money, money, money, money, I'm having a good time
Money, I'm (I’m-I’m) I’m having a good time

[Verse 2: ChrisCo]
Fuck it, I'm poppin’ bottles and throwing hundreds on strippers
And before I leave this suite, I'mma roll up 11 Swishers (Ya know?)
Had the bomb so hoes is tryna get us
But tonight I want a pro - I ain't fucking with no beginners
Because I got that
(Money, money, money)
So I brought some ounces out
Anywhere we go to on the Strip I got a house account
Yeah you might have seen me at the tables throwing stacks around
Staring at my girl cause she's got the baddest ass in town
You don't know the half cuz, Shorty likes Kush
Cash is in the safe, no banks like swoosh
Homie don't be looking at me like I'm unfamiliar
You know I drive that Range Rover only bumping Dilla
With a pocket full of
(Money, money)
On my way to Sapphire
I was getting driven and you was fixing a flat tire
It don't matter if it's Henny or it’s O.E. bitch
I'mma blow this money while I watch you blow me
I got

[Hook]
Money, money, money, money, I'm having a good time
Money, I'm (I’m-I’m) I’m having a good time
Money, money, money, money, I'm having a good time
Money, I'm (I’m-I’m) I’m having a good time

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Crooked:
Gimme the beat and I’mma murk it
I'm allergic to you clowns, I don't work at Circus Circus
Yeah I misspelled my tattoo, maybe I ain't perfect
But if I'm getting at you, baby I am worth it (daaawg)
I'm a visionary (ballll)
Man that shit is scary (y’allll)
Crooked I, put me on your itinerary (aaay)
Bury your ex in the lame dude cemetery
Ice cream paint job, coupe cold as Ben and Jerry’s
Holler at me when you in L.A
I keep a bad snow bunny, ask Jenna Shea
All about my business, aay
I been this way
Ever since Em and Jay
Was renegades getting paid
(Money, money)
Hoes down and my G's up
I ease up, blazing California trees up
C.O.B. - hold your pinky rings up
I'm blinged up, East Side King Tut is me, what

Money, money, money, money, I'm having a good time

Money, money, money, money, I'm having a good time
