Yea, I'm on my way to Miami man
I'm feeling real Miamish up in the booth right now
Ya feel me They get mad cuz I have fun
Ohhhh, I just died in your arms tonight
Hip-Hop Weekly Week eighteen and a half, fuck it
How you gonna get mad at me cuz I have fun with what I do
You got your own life nigga
Live your own life

Get ready on the right, ready on the left
Spaghetti colored junk put a Chevy on the set
Niggas know I get my fatty on the deck
Frozen Evian Ice heavy on the neck
Dade County ya holding weight
Put on my fresh linen Its close to 8
Pull up at the Hit Factory And blow up the gate
Let me in it's your boy from the Golden State
I hit the mic with my million dollar mouth piece
Than I'm out, peace; I'm bouncing to South Beach
Fuck a dress code I'm demanding my respect
White tee C.O.B. bandanna on my neck
I hit the floor two chicks saying let's dance
Fat ass and Juicy Couture sweat pants
Poppin' pills in Paris We call em X-Clan
Never be a groom, but I'm the best man

[Refrain]
I just died in your arms tonight
I see you haters suck a dead mans dick
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
I don't focus on you too long
Thanks for the motivation though
Its C.O.B. we do what we wanna do yea
Hip-Hop Weekly Week 18
Club Rolex I miss you
Club Coco I miss you
I just died in your arms tonight
You too Solid Gold
I'll be back though

Damn it feel good to see Crooked up on it
You only live once Get lost in the moment
I don't know why opponents say they want it
Tone it down a bit The beef I Corleone it
Take a chromosome from Capone and ya clone it
Cross it with Buggs Johnson And I'm what ya gonna get
When I'm on ya head who ya gonna get crumbs spit don't split
Nigga no shit You ain't never in the hood you a mystery
Like a pregnant pit bull you a bitch to me
Circle Of Bosses yea, that's the click to be
Every week we be dropping hot shit for free
Yet still you pussy niggas wanna talk bad
Till you take off on em just like a launch pad
Send em home to the home the one that we all had
Really, I'm the one your kids should call dad

My fucking haters
I'm more focused on niggas who love the movement
C.O.B. Circle Of Bosses
Ya know what I mean
Everyone supporting this motherfucking movement
I love y'all to death
And we gonna keep dropping this shit on em
They say if you love something you do the shit for free
I love this shit nigga

Fuck it week 18 and a half
Just ta let you all know I love y'all for the support
Feel me?

Yea it's the C-R-double OK
Hoes gonna make me pull another OJ
Bitch nagging me on another no way
Hand me a condom bitch fuck the foreplay
Okay I might change my ways pardon a nigga I'm gangsta raised
Stacks my chips cuz they been paid
When I'd rather hit the club and make it rain for days like OH!
I just died in your arms tonight
Now that's for you motherfucking haters C.O.B. nigga
We got a massive movement spreading all over the world like a disease
Ya know what I mean yea I'm fucking with this shit

Cruising down Sunset banging this shit back to back to back
