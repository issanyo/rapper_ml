[Verse 1: Novel]
He probably think that love grows on trees
If it was me, you wouldn’t be anything less than a queen
No, say you’re something like I felt in a dream
That was not obvious so you let me explain what I mean
Oh, see it’s just this feels so right, and he’s so wrong
Why, being pushed over, you can’t keep holding on
Why, can’t you see baby, with me is where you belong?
Way he’s treating you lately, girl it’s driving me crazy

[Hook: Novel]
So I say, I said “yo baby, yo, you don’t need this at all”
And whenever you stumble, I’ll cushion your fall
I said “yo baby, yo, yeah, you can [?]”
But I’ll be there with you through it all

[Verse 2: Novel]
I know he’s lacking all that love gives
Keep on processing these emotions, one day you’re gonna flip
Oh, see you put up with his drama for far too long
Why, when I’m just so right for you and he’s so wrong
Why, any other woman would be gone
But you’re constantly waiting, for him to keep changing

[Hook: Novel]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Fly Ethiopian, body doper than opium
Say I'm throwing salt in this game, here comes the sodium
Sittin' on the side line, watching you take L's
I'm in the same position that Kobe in, throw me in
And I don’t like feeling like a hater
To get with me, you should be willing like a Jada
You got more soul that a plate of sweet potatoes
And to cater, I’m just waiting ‘til you feeling like a waiter
Waitress, come and give me some of that soul food
On the late shift, you with old dude
Arguing about all the chicks up in his Grey 6
You should take a ride in my old school
‘Cause he sexing everything in the town
The gravity of the situation is bringing you down
Uh, it’s a shame, your man playing games
Call me when you’re tired of the pain
You know I got you
