[Intro]
Treacherous, Hip Hop Weekly
Ya nawmean, it's your boy Crooked I man
Week forty-eight, Scarface
Shouts out to the legendary Scarface
It's Hip Hop Weekly
Shouts out to my dude Alvin in Richmond, Virginia, stand up
Chief in the 916, stand up
Ya nawmean, let's get 'em
Ey, straight sick, yeah
Shouts out to my dude Andre
Good lookin' on that comment you left on the MySpace page man
What up Patrick
It's '08 man, this has been a motherfuckin' series
I'll tell you man
Sometimes the shit is just like damn, yeah though
Check me though

[Verse 1]
I swear when I was born I felt the earth quaking
I hear the doctor's voice, I saw the nurse shaking
Another one born to die, that was their first statement
My first day on Earth, I had a hearse waiting
My time gotta be precious as my hourglass suggests
A nigga can't sleep, I power nap at best
And stressing over life won't allow a cat to rest
Fuck it, I guess I'll sleep a hour after death
Sippin' on that Henny when I'm down and out depressed
Then I start yelling out whatever sounds about the best
That's usually "fuck the world," heart pounding out my chest
Then I stop and let my mind begin to browse around some cess
I'm in your hood alone, the realest rapper known
I ain't Hollywood, go and grab your camera phone
You never seen a rapper walking with this much platinum on
My chrome Magnum watch my back just like a chaperone
Yeah, I love many but I trust few
And I'm like Nike's slogan, I just do it to get my just due
Whoever said I was cocky homey that's untrue
I'm just a few notches above you but what's new
Man I'm just trying to avoid becoming a young martyr
C.O.B., we three hundred deep like we from Sparta
None smarter, the author of slaughter
I'm walking above water on mics, now who thought they could come harder?

[Interlude]
Huh? Not you my nigga
I'm trying to rap my way off the block nigga
I ain't letting no nigga come harder than me
I don't care who they is, how many records they sold nigga
You know

[Verse 2]
I'm having dreams of getting money and the vision so real
I'm licking my thumbs in my sleep, counting invisible bills
Waking up to weed, pistols and pills
Should I slang all three or should I get Gs from lyrical skills
I got enough to push presedential kush everyday
'Til that mary jane go platinum like Mary J
Naw, no nine to five, no resume
Just some smoke so fire that it brings me severence pay
Look into this veteran's eyes
If you ever see fear or failure, that's a clever disguise
I'm top five dead or alive
Whenever I rhyme I'm ahead of my time
Bet I survive whatever arise, never no lies

[Outro]
Never, never, you nawmean
I ain't got time to lie man
Yeah we gettin' money on these corners but
It's another side to that story man
Nigga get tired of looking over his shoulder for cops
Jackers, kidnappers
Motherfuckers want a piece of what you got, you know
Don't lie to the kids, stop lying
C.O.B., Circle of Bosses, Hip Hop Weekly
Horseshoe Gang in the building
It's my nigga Diceman bossday
Happy bossday nigga
We bosses, nigga, '08
I can't wait, it's checkmate
I can't wait, in '08 it's checkmate
Mickey, Pi
Tough ass rappers, ya'll some bitches
Hahahahahaha
