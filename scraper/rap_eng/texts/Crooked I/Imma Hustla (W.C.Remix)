[Hook: Ca$his]
I'mma hustler, find me where it's raking in dough
And you a buster, softer than the regular ho
I don't trust ya, I'm riding with the iron you know
And when you hit the ground I'mma growl

[Verse 1: Ca$his]
You know that, uppercuts to repercussion for suckers bluffing
Tie him up, stuff him in the trunk, with the speakers bumping
My speech is rugged, it's cooking coke on the easy oven
Drunk, bumping easy does it, smoking on my weed in public
Attitude is fuck it, pullin' out my dick you suck it
I ain't talking lunch and when I say I'm bout my dreams and millions
And we thuggin' while you be clubbin'
Your life is like an afterparty till you see niggas running
Killas big as big pop slumbed in, and niggas ain't retaliating but nothing
And all that hard talk was just bluffing
Destined and disgusted and new niggas is not trusted
If it's money I'mma touch it, ball over it was something
Niggas live frontin', but I'mma die stunin'
Petrifying the pussy I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I keep my gun up by my stomach and I'm blunted
Bitches bogus, brand nigga
None of you pussy niggas want it uh

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
Did all the shit, man on my own
Look at my resume, that bitch long
Wish a nigga would say he put me on
(It didn't work), tears in the game going strong
And I've in this shit since like '02
Look at my bullshit I've been through
Niggas say fuck me, fuck 'em too
Nigga I don't give a fuck of none of them dudes
I'mma hustla, get your hustla
These rap bands is my customers
And my trap jump, and my trap jump, and my trap jumping like double dutch
These blow niggas is crazy, these DJ's fugaysie
I'ma made man, you ain't made me
Want meals son, you gotta pay me
Ghost rider, nigga check the credit
Gas man, all I spit is 91-11
Lot apologizing in the game
A nigga like me in apologetic
Niggas say that they real, nigga they fake as fuck and this shit pathetic
I call it like I see it, like I'm 20-20
And I tell you to your face, nigga you niggas pussy

[Hook] X2

[Verse 3: Roccett]
Come on, but Roccett you're rapping, you know when that rocket be killing
Yeah, my niggas is just dressing in black is my niggas is feeling
Yeah, we slang the coke up by the polo
Still riding in my polo, we go preaching like we no more
Bitch, We got the pistols and you know we shoot at
Cause all my niggas just like Nikey, all we do is do it
Uh, we have your bitch for a nighter
And that's your bitch so don't trip, we don't even like her
Look, I'm 'bout my paper, your mully, your baby mamas a groupie
My nigga snatch all your cookies, cause all you niggas is pussy
Cause their daddy's was pussy, all my niggas like Pac
So nigga don't even push me, I'm on the ground for this cheddar
You surrounded by cheddar, this little nigga was mean
Used to flash my barret ta, a big shout out to my team
And all of my bastards, a real coast nigga
Shout out to real nigga Ca$his we on it

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
If... you ain't got no paper left
Better get your paper right
I don't go to sleep, nigga
I don't even say good night
Get it day and night I'm slinging like I'm weighing white
Stay and fight buster Douglas
Slay a mic, hustlers love us
Y'all crazy thinking that you can compare me to other suckers
It's all gravy motherfucker cause I smother fuckers
Speak the language of the streets when I'm banging beats
I was slanging pieces back when Jeezy used to hang with Meech
Rocking more shine on the jackas
Winning bankers winning rich
They nose dive, getting close lined, like I'm hanging sheets
Slaughterhouse, Nickel, Joey, Crooked I, and Yaowa
How a group get a symbol by the higher power
Rifle power in my coup, I'm the Eiffel Tower
And my host has got more toasters than a bridal shower
Hear the pain in my voice when they hit the right pitch
I was born in a ditch but Imma die rich

[Verse 5: Goldie Gold]
Talk to the hit, here come off print, watch what you're sayin
Money chaser, paper chaser, many chaser
She don't case catch up
On the ' try my homicide
Every verse don't face your death oh
'. I'm on my watch, left post can knock ..
I piss on California shit on the south
Back to the gooder, past of my shooter
Take your free benz and ..
Just imagine what I'd do with you daughter ..
