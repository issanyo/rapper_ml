[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]
Well! It is a weeping and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping and a mourning and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound, which is di champion sound, believe!

[Hook (Crooked I says "Slaughter" in the background)]
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy,your chick, she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo with your girl, she tryna jerk me
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy,your chick, she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo with your girl, she tryna jerk me

[Fuzzy Jones singing while Crooked I says "Slaughter"]
Well! It is a weeping and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping and a mourning and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound, which is di champion sound, believe!

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
We ain't showing no mercy nigga
Thirsty killer, Percy Miller
Ask around nigga I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Lost my mind I'm living fine without it
Money on the trigger that's bread on your clique
Fuck the world because you'll be dead on your dick
Decapitate ya' like a backwards savage
Come back to my village with your head on a stick
Pussy niggas that's the shit I don't like
2 Glock 9's at the same damn time
Jump off Joe said the nigga don't write on 106 and my nigga ain't lyin'
Walk in the booth, get to talking the truth and then I cough in the booth
When I draw then I shoot, sawed off in the douche
You alter the group, too raw to compute
Leave a soft nigga mute
Make him call for a truce
Then I hop in the coupe, on vodka and juice
Just a boss on the loose
Little mama's caboose, like a ox and a moose
I got to seduce, I'mma hop in the cooch
And toss her a deuce, peace sign
Yes in Long Beach and I'm east side reppin'
My niggas'll kill you before I reach my weapon
Beneath my leave that's a .357
Pow pow this Slaughterhouse
Shady records on my neck I'm cashin' out
Killin' every beat then a negro exit that mean on every track I'm blackin' out
I got 30 pages of rhymes in this muthafucka!!!(hahaha)

[Hook]
