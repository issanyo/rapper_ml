And now, can I get a moment of silence for Pimp C?

My prayers go out to the family of Pimp C, man
All the family members, Bun B
One of the realest niggas I've ever met in this industry, and I met a whole bunch of niggas, man
Keep ypur head up
Pimp C! You inspired a generation, boy, you inspired me
(?) I'm ridin' dirty with ya
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

Spice 1, come on daddy, let's get it
