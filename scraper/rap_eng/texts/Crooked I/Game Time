[Intro]
Who rootin' for the underdog
You rootin' for the underdog
I'm rootin' for the underdog
‘cause I am the underdog
This game time

[Hook]
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time

[Verse 1]
They try to stop me but I know they can’t
A bullshit a quitter I ain’t
Niggas yellin' that they going so hard in the paint
Fuck that I’d rather been going hard in the bank
Here we go time to prove I’m the very best
Poster child for Cali niggas call me Jerry West
Had to crawl 'fore we ball now we’re taking steps
This is underdog is a Pit step up and place your bets
The people's champ I’m like a ?? and muscle car
That five dues I’m like the sixty in the double R
I’m rich rollin I don’t bang I don’t just hustle hard
This COB I let the planet know who the fuck we are
That ssutt ssutt, I done came so far but I got so far to go still
I don’t give a fuck I hold still, get out of way I’ll be roadkill
This is how we do the shit, obstacles are obsolete, all I know you not retreat
I’m out the door, I've got to eat

[Hook]
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time

[Verse 2]
It's game time and I’m about to kick it all
It's game time, let’s get it how we livin
Dawg I’mma get it all, I’ma spinnin' ball
But I’ma livin on this spinnin' ball
This earth, this work I’ma get involved
This game is a pussy I’mma hit it raw
Spit it raw, one day I’m walking through
Heard 'em say you’ll never make it
Dawg who you talking to
I do what bosses do, take a look at my office view
On the road to success I know I’ll take a loss or two
What you call a setback, I call a challenge, if I fall
I know I get back, it’s all a balance
I’m tying up my gloves tight, cause you 'bout to be my punching bag
Right before that ?? cross ?? flow I hit 'em with a hundred jabs
All I need in this life of sin is me and my hustling(Everyday I'm hustling)
Haters you gonna talk behind my back yelling, "Fuck Crook"
I hit you with the virgin face that I don’t give a fuck look

[Hook]
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
The world on my shoulders i’m riskin it all
I'mma here to fight until it’s over win, lose, or draw
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time
I got the sun in my eyes, my heart beating heavy
And I’ve been waiting all my life to show you I’m ready
It’s game time, it’s game time


[Outro]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my hustling(Everyday I'm hustling) (x 4)
