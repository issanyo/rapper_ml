[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Yo, young nigga, hustling on his corner, told his Momma it's his way of life
She told him, 'stop,' knew that he wasn't gonna, all she could do is pray at night
He had a homie, knew him since a baby, they called each other alikes
Hustled together, pistol in they jeans, fitted and they favourite nikes
They had weed, had crack, had speed, they could even get you crystal meth
Had a crew, some dead, some in jail, they the only two niggas left
A old man walks by and he asks, 'why you young brothers dealing death?'
'Old man, we from the school of hard knocks, and our teachers didn't give a F'
The eastside, y'all

[Hook: Tena Jones]
We struggle hard on this side of the tracks
Watch where you step, cause it might hold you back
You can even get snatched up, just like that
Can't sleep, I got worry
But it's ok, cause
It's my eastside story

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
A little girl, only 14 years old, doing things you don't want to know
She got a mother, but her money's always going to them dudes on the corner, though
Momma's addicted to something evil and wicked, got evicted just a month ago
Little girl in the hotel living, watching her parent become a ho
She say, 'Momma, I know you selling your body' she ain't ever one to bite her tongue
Her mother crying, hiding behind lies in fear of what her daughter might become
They say the fruit don't fall that far from the tree she was like a plum
She wasn't ripe, but she was just right, you know them Johns like them young
The eastside, dig

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Old man, standing on the corner where them young niggas make bread
Give him advice, Vietnam vet, came home to a fake leg
Say, 'young brothers, why you out here dealing death?' you already know what they said
He hobbled off thinking I'mma pray for them, thank God that they ain't dead
He saw a hooker in front of the hotel, thought without her I'll be just fine
She said, 'old man, I got just what you need, a soft bed, and some good wine'
He took his shades off, his pupils were grey, she thought, 'man, this dude look blind'
He looked past her, right to her daughter, said, 'how much for a good time'
I'm from the eastside

[Hook]
