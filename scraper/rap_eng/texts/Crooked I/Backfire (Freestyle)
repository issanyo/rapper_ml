[Intro: Crooked I]

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
COB’s my religion and I put it on the Bible
G.O.D is my Shepard and I got my own disciples
Challenge us in these Last Days, and I flip you
As quick as a diesel hitting a motorcycle with my loaded rifle
No more vitals, I ain't talking to Ellen or Perez Hilton when I'm tellin’ gay rappers that I'm homo-cidal
Leave 'em dead on arrival
The most resilient and brilliant rapper, I own the title, plus I'm a local idol
Leeches make songs about me, then they backfire
Try to suck the blood out my buzz—-fucking vampires
Screwing wit ya career is just like fucking vampires
It’s already dead, it’s that whack shit you ran by us
Maybe I am biased, I think I'm the best
Maybe my compass is broken and I just think I’m the West
Maybe for every verse I spit I’ll put that ink in my flesh
And be a testament for everything that I think when I rest (Yes)
May I fade ‘em, my songs be superb
Hit the ghetto and suburbs, and cross over like A.I. made ‘em
I'm so ahead of my time that I gotta turn my clock back when I rock so everyday is Daylight Savings
I cast a humongous shadow, rappers are livin’ in it
I kill you in 60 seconds, Why? Cuz it’s been a minute
Since I slayed a major or independent lyricist
You wanted it: here it is. You get offended: splendid
When did Crooked give a fuck? Homie, I'm outspoken
But I don't shit on everybody dawg: I'm house broken
That mean you gotta be worth it, I beg you niggas' pardon
You only rhyming’ words, we did that shit in kindergarten
I'm breathing fire, my lungs look like I lit a carton of Camels, took consecutive breaths, and started spittin' carbon
You couldn't be more vagina if you was in a womb
It’s space in the booth, but my skills need a bigger room
And I know cops want the scoop on a killer goon
Couldn't get the scoop if they brought Reese with her spoon
Either I'm the best or a damn liar
Haters plan to stop me, but they plans backfire! [echo]
