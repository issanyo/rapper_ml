We all been through up and dows in out lifes (yeah)
I've been through some, you been through some but we can't let it stop us

Life stumbling blocks can't do nothing with us man (nothing)
We gotta keep moving with an iron will (gotta keep moving)
Heart of a lion (yeah shit is real man) (this is real nigga)
I know you stressing (me too my nigga)
But we can make it (we got a problem) (gotta make it)
Chea! (Yeah)

[Verse One: Crooked I]
Even as a youg kid I had a Boss demeanor
Problably see me in the drop givin' a cop the finger
My girlfriend is a rachet I cock the nina
She serving niggas for the raquet but she's not Serena
Niggas wanna run infront my car pop the beamer
Wet of water I ain't talking Aquafina
So I kick spiritual lyrics in God's arena
Start pouring my heart out more than a gospel singer
My whole life never felt fair
"Fuck my dead beat father" is what a yelled as a kid living on welfare
No healthcare we walking down hell stairs
Hell Yeah! I looked for help else where
All I had was a 9milli and one gage
Plus Rage
I dropped out at a young age
Fuck Grades
My mission to become paid even if one day they put my face on the front page
Now I beef and squa, sleep with raw
Thief and rob the streets to beat the odds
My homie slit both of his wrists
He said he wanted to meet with God
Cause he couldn't keep a descent job
I seen it as a true lesson
You can't afford to step outside of your mind, for 2 seconds
If so, you choose weapons, shoot yourself with this Smith & Wesson untill
You're through stressing, DAMN!!!

[Chorus: Crooked I]
I know you stressing homey
You need blessing homey
I've been there before
Life is hard, I know (I know)
Face your depression homey
It ain't a question homey
We can fight and survive the odds fo sho! (we can fight)

I know you stressing homey
You need blessing homey (yeah)
I've been there before
Life is hard, I know (I know)
Face your depression homey (face it)
It ain't a question homey (it ain't one)
We can fight and survive the odds fo sho!

[Verse Two: Jim Gittum]
Now when times get hard
Sometimes they get harder
She should of been, could of been, baby moms supporting my daughter
While I was out wild n out trying to be Shawn Carter
Should of been working a 9 to 5 trying to be a father
I was only 18 trying to chase this dream
Rebellious little nigga mesmerized by the Bling
Then I had a spirit encounter with the King of kings
And he told me "Jim Gittum go and do your thing"
Now I understand what vision and focus mean
Prioritized lay my ties and now I get green
I ain't trying to be extreme and say that life is perfect
I'm just trying to say walk by faith and life would be worth it
Gotta think more optimistic and control your thoughts
Gotta think more postivite before you talk
It's true you gotta learn to crawl right before you walk
But after you learn to walk you run to be number one!

[Chorus]
