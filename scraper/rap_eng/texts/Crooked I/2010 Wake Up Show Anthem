Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park

[Verse 1: Locksmith]
Locksmith, I go in unorthodox
Verbally vaccinate any rapper that sort of pop
My conversation's a combination of condamnation
You kinda hatin'?
Then you watin' with the corpse of Pac
I'm the best we got
Stop denyin' me
So many plain rappers sayin they fly; it's irony
I will eat 'em all, Tech bring 'em in
I'mma clean his skin
You can have his bones on the Wake Up Show

[Verse 2: Supastition]
Allow me to set the pace for Revolution, King Tech and Sway
World famous, respected, go protect your neck with a brace
The realest radio rebels repping the west to date
Crowds - they forever stay moving 'em like they pepper sprayed
Every day, all day - always dropping exclusives
Spinning authentic rhythms not just popular music
It's Kam Moye, boy how could I not introduce him
On the Wake Up Show no man's stopping the movement

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
OK, Melle Mel, Makaveli, 40 Fonzarelli, Akinyele and Celly Cel
Weezy, Jeezy, Kanyeezy and Bun B
Easy-E, EPMD, Cube and Run DMC
Chuck D, Jay-Z, AZ, Lil' Kim, Eminem and Kool G
Black Thought, Mac Dre, Snoop and Kweli
Drop them names, cause hip hop ain't all about me!

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Wake Up Show soldier; first infantry
You're fin' to be certainly worked into the verses in me
Purposely turned into t-searchin' to B. turfin' in burgundy
Lurkin' the streets; jerkin' this heat
Tech Nina's murkin' this beat
Wake up show brands 'em
Fans come at random
Hand 'em jams that damns them
I be givin 'em tantrums
My fam, son, is Sway and Tech, they the best and some
Trav and Tech in the phantom
This is the fuckin' anthem

[Interlude]
Wait a minute, wait a minute cut this shit
Man, what you gon' do now?
What we gonna do right here is go back
How far you goin' back? Way back
As we go a little something like this
Hit it

[Verse 5: Tajai]
Yeah, Hieroglyphics, we purveyors of dangerous language
Somewhat of a sadist, I bring it with or without my stainless
With "The World Famous", made it by banging out them bangers
We out killing the killers, out-slanging the slangers
Orangutans are concerned with how their chains dangle
I got a mouth full of stingers
Harangue you, my aim hit from angles
Main attraction coming, we're a race of angels
Bringing back exactly what the game been lacking, thank us

[Verse 6: RZA]
Yo, my genetic make-up: deoxyribonucleic cake up acid
Make the most fatherless bastard shape up
Now wake up like the radio show
Digi' got the crazy-o flow
Make a lazy party ho
Move like it's cardio, exercise
You sway when the Tec surprise
Got the drop on your knot
Wu-Tang specialize
Lyrics from a poison pen
Noise turns boys to men
Have them avoiding sin
My will can employ the wind

[Verse 7: Ras Kass]
I go with the flow like ripples through Hâ‚‚O
You not Nas, I'm not Kelis, but I hate you so much right now
A. I owe you: like vowels
Revenge, I'm bigheaded this my down syndrome style
Got who's who to lynch, the Wake Up Show Grinch
Medulla School a computer, the ruler like twelve inch
Rappers is menstruating, watch me rise to the challenge
Like the Washington Monument I'm just one tall phallus

[Verse 8: B-Real]
My flow's on it like the AllSpark
This moment is hallmark
Hall of fame player, knocking them out the ball park
I'm all heart - you on the contrary a small mark
In the scheme of the hustle you playing a small part
I'm from the city where they sing It Never Rains In Cali
Sway and Tech Wake Up Show - tag it in the alley
It constantly jumps off - you bound to get bumped off
You bringing me static by habit I let the pump off

[Outro]
You listen to the world's famous Wake Up Show
