[Verse 1: Crooked I]

This the flow that'll put R.I.P right next to your initials
I ain't never been superficial, just super official
Time for you computer shooters to get your Ruger to whistle
It's stupid, if you be a pistol, I'm a nuclear missile
This is Jiu Jitsu versus you Shih Tzu's
I'll kick the dog shit out of you on some Kung Fu
Hit you with the one-two combination punch
Wanna take me to court, fuck you
I don't care, it's The Art of War, let Sun Tzu
I ain't mad, call it Martin Luther King
You'll never be hard as me but as an artist you can dream
Regardless who you bring, they just a martyr, just a target to a beam
I'll mix your parts up turn your heart into a spleen
Mean, park your body on the carpet with your team
Slaughter every part of your regime, nobody know a thing
I run shit like a cardio machine, audio promethazine
Adios for bringing that garbage on the scene
I'm from the home of the weight scales, Long Beach
But you won't be nowhere around sand when you see shells
A side of me is Godly I can preach well
But the other side of me is spitting fire, giving beats hell
They say the genius in writing is in details
The way y'all be feeling what I'm writing, shit should be braille
Crooked is BIG how can he fail
Anyone pick one: Big Smalls, Big Pun, B.I.G L
If you say you don't love me, my nigga you a liar
If I killed your favorite rapper it would be suicide
You decide, I can speed it up like I'm spitting with Twista and Do or Die
Even dumbed down, I'm stupefied
Nothing but confidence when rocking a crowd
I'll body wrap niggas then bury them sarcophagus style
I leak music for free, like I took a profitless vow
But the album sounding like a 2010 2Pacalypse Now
This is for my supporters who say I'm the West
Gotta make you somethin' to play when you say I'm the best
Let em debate it all day, I'm on my way to success
To make the world check the rhyme I gotta stay on my quest, yes
That just happened, you cats just rapping
I give your soul food, like cat fish blacking
Ask yourself who could get an atlas cracking
I got the skills got the streets the backpackers
I give back to the hood, I'm good
Got bad chicks asking for wood
And Hip-Hop Weekly we back in action I should
Mention a few cosigns but I won't
See you have to but my flow shine, so I don't
#OKBYE!

[Outro]
Before I get outta here, let me sing to these niggas man, yo
I know you rappers sitting on music
Figure you drop it every week so you can use it
That shit is old and ain't exclusive
Only Hip-Hop Weekly can bring you new shit!
