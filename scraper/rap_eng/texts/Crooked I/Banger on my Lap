[Intro]
Yea
Circle of Bosses
Crooked I

[Hook]
Banger on my lap, my seats lean back
I'm ready when beef crack
I hope you know the business
White tee attached
Fresh Dodger hats Long Beach is where we at

[Verse]
Crooked keep infinite cannons to blam at y'all
Put hammers in ya mouth like Anbesol, a damn Neanderthal
Ratchets draw, I'm last to fall, standin tall
Your blood on the canvas, that's all the camera saw
Yeah, fake pussies despise me
Cause I pull up dumpin shots while the Bathing Ape hoody disguise me
And for the shit I'm writing you should straight pull it, surprise me;
I'm a beast I ain't letting stray bullets survive me
This Wes Craven's a thug, I'm TEC wavin
Makin you a rest haven for slugs, your chest cave in
You meet your death facin the mud, I'm neck breakin
Die in ya vest tastin ya blood, I'm breathtaking
My trigger finger gon ring them things towards you
Doctors'll go'n find a machine to breathe for you
Them hammers'll King Thor you, the beam floor you
It tore through your spleen, poor you, choirs'll sing for you
I'm missin noodles, you niggas poodles
Don't try to resist cause this is feudal, but I give you kudos
Props my nigga, then I'm a give you two holes
When cops come askin "What happened?" I'm a tell em "who knows?"
Never talkin I'd rather walk in a cell
Direct a call for the bail cause tellin's awful as hell
And snitchin's a nail in ya coffin as well
Get knocked off, from shots called, by young bosses in jail
This is the life we, lead nightly
Creep lightly through the streets with G's like me
It's like the serpent made Adam and Eve bite me
I put the knowledge of good and evil on trees like leaves
Paper, I flip cream with my notebook
Hot sixteens and a dope hook
Sometimes I freestyle, now I call that flow the "no look"
You don't use pens either good but, you're no Crook
I dust you flow off, just to show off
Busters know, they can't turn this hustler's blow off
Face it you basic, you wack-ass niggas is getting wasted
I reach in my waist and the 38 rip
Bullets straight zip, through the air like a spaceship
Hit you under the chin, give you a face lift, you ain't shit
I'm on some bang bang Circle Gang shit
Puttin blood on your shoes like Game's Hurricane kicks
Get murdered man, with perfect aim, get your vertebrae's clipped
Further pain administered from my burner, same clip
Slip, we won't leave a witness
When you in my city, I hope you know the business
When you in my city, hope you know the business

[Hook]
Banger on my lap, my seats lean back
I'm ready when beef crack, I hope you know the business
White tee attached, fresh Dodger hats
Long Beach is where we at, yeah I hope you know the business
I got my banger in my lap, my seats lean back
I'm ready when beef crack, nigga I hope you know the business
White tee attached, yeah fresh Dodger hats
Long Beach is where we at, so I hope ya know the business
