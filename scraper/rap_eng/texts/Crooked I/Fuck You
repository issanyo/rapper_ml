[Verse 1: Danimal Lector]
Welcome to my planet, look it, it's Danimal and Crooked
I'm holding your face over this open flame, like "man, what's cookin'?"
Doin' what they said I shouldn't or wouldn't
Got my foot in the game, tried to fit my dick, but shit, I couldn't
Eating rappers like some pudding, holla back
Bill Cosby swag, I could probably body bag
Anybody I'm down to rap
[?], with a shotty blast, you're cocky as is Sloppy Joes
With the drop-top stashed, and the Vodka flask
A hockey mask, lets rock and roll
Cock it back, lock and load, your top explodes, then I got to go
Drive by, wave hi, then, well, adios
Kamikaze flow, as a snotty nosed kid
If life's a box of chocolates, why am I eating rocky road, bitch?
I'm hot and so sick, can't stop and I won't quit
Hit 'em up like 'Pac
But I'm going big, leave you in shock, like "Oh, shit!"
Bitch, suck it, I'm disgusting, these kids love it
Slip up, get nip-tucked,  left with your wrist cut, in a brick oven
It's nothin', my religions hustlin', 'til I kick the bucket
I'll deep fry your nuts and tell your son their McNuggets
Film it and make the shit public, this is what I'm all about
Reckless, walking death wish, you have just entered the Slaughterhouse

[Hook: Danimal Lector (Crooked I)]
I can hear them say, stay clear
He's severely insane (What, dude?!)
He's weird and strange
But here's the thing, if it's fuck me
Then fuck you! (Fuck you!) (x2)

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
I told you my hands is the wrong place to put your life
(Slaughterhouse) bloody apron and butcher knife
Chop you in to two and a half men, the Ashton Kutcher type
Crooked slice your grill till you and that nigga Seal look alike
I'm Benihana with any katana, just give me the llama
Put the semi up on ya
Do physical trauma to your body like twenty piranha
I'll bomb ya on that Libya drama
On my Mama, I'm my city's Obama
Presidential Rollie in a presidential suite
He's the 44th President, so my .44 is presidential heat
Clear every residential street
Then I pull out the Big Mac to represent the beef
You rappers dressing in mad drag, you passed fag
The trending topic on twitter, you hashtag: trashbag
Niggas like you shouldn't even have a chance
Hip Hop ain't dead, it's just bleeding in an ambulance

[Hook]
