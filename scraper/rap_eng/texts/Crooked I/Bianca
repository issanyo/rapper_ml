Bianca

Intro: [The Visionary and The Architect and Ranna Royce]
We’re a furious mixture of noise
Just like that Dominick
Hoodlum

Chorus: [Aneesa Badshaw]
Touch, touch my-, touch myself, myself
(Repeat)

Verse: [Kxng Crooked]
I like my bitches thick and intelligent mixed with ghetto, ghetto
Y’all think the downest bitches don’t live in the ghetto, ghetto
Shit
You drinking vodka, gotta meet my bitch Bianca
She’s blanca, she’ll shock you, baddest bitch from here to Sri Lanka
But she’s bonkers, psycho, loco blame it on the ghetto, ghetto
Never thought we sail to the top like Michelle and Barack of the ghetto, ghetto
In the projects, steak and lobster, she cooking that
But she so official that she hold a pistol drinking Folgers crystals
Playing that Too Short "Blow The Whistle"
Turn around look at you like what the fuck you looking at
I blame the ghetto, ghetto
She raised my kids that ain’t hers
Take a village in the ghetto, ghetto
Our sex don’t waste time, big ol’ booty, itty bitty waistline
No phone sex, she just sit on my beard and she call that FaceTime, ugh

Bridge: [Kxng Crooked]
I was on my gangsta shit back in the day
She was on my side just packaging yayo
Cops ran up in the spot and they had me in jail
House slipper and scarf she came back with the bail

Verse: [Kxng Crooked]
We fight sometimes but she’s my light on my darkest day, one hundred
Work that out like sexual healings and Marvin Gaye, one hundred
Bobby and Whitney, Bonnie and Clyde in the hall of fame, one hundred
See eye to eye, she ride or die, I call her name BIANCA

Chorus: [Aneesa Badshaw]
I don’t want anybody else
I touch myself
Touch, touch my-, touch myself, myself
(Repeat)

One hundred
Ghetto, ghetto

Chorus: [Aneesa Badshaw]
I don’t want anybody else
I touch myself
Touch, touch my-, touch myself, myself
(Repeat)
