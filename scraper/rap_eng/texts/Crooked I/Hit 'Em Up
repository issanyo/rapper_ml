It's Valentine's Day so you know what that means
I might have to fuck yo bitch!

You ain't seen a crew like C.O.B. since Thug Life
Talkin' Demi Capone, Sauce the Boss and Young Dice
Intriago, Luciano, we dump pipes
Kenny "Desert Eagle" Siegel make men become mice
It's a crew thang, man we Mobb Deep like we Wu-Tang
Dip through any set where red and the blue hang
Ok, I got screws loose, my brains is loose change
Tools aim from here to the Ukraine
Walk in my air force ones
I'm still in the hood, that's why I wear more guns
As soon as those slugs become airborne, run
I got me some enemies, I don't care for one
(Nigga therefore) It's me and my crew, call us piranhas
Knowing if we growing today, we taller manana
And I still rock a Rolex through all of the drama
The presidential got a black face call it Obama
Circle Of Bosses, motherfuckas better be ready
My sixteens better than every, the veteran's steady
Get cream, my twin set of berettas is heavy
M-beam spot your adam's apple better than Eddie
Get cheddar and fetti forever and never be petty
Sasquatch got me high as the head of a Yeti
Yet he, still, maintains composure
Compose a classic for my gangbangin' soldiers
Tryna get money, gotta slang caine and doja
Be safe on the streets, cause BANG-BANG is over (BLAOW)
Pistols doing dreadful things
Give you a 360 halo and Redbull Wings
AK got your door looking like it's a jar
Shots knock the driver out the other side of the car
Niggas tryna be hard, bullets fly, you can die in your yard
EASTSIDE, Crooked I is a star
With my C.O.B. alliance niggas buying the bar
You know the signs dime pieces waving high from afar
Treat the inside of they panties just like a guitar
Play with it, but never stay with it, a straight menace
WE HIT 'EM UP
