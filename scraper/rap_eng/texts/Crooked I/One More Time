[Verse 1]
Ayyiyo, hardtop convertible - it's him again
When the car stop it murder you - them killer rims
Your heart stop, the seath's half suede and part croc
Paint job far from stock, this is dark chop
Hit the block with the system knockin' on some extra loud ish
You tell me it's child ish
But I'm, on my Long Beach, Southern Cal' ish
And my, fuck a brrrritch, young Chris Brown ish
Hahaha.. I'm only playin' wit'chu
My homegirls gangbang bitch, they'll hit you
Puttin' hands on a woman ain't a player's issue
I'd rather treat your emotions like they was made of tissue
(What that supposed to mean?) Guess I'm an asswipe
(Tch, fuck you nigga!) Yeah, that's right
Fuck me like your friend did last night
Now go on and call her so y'all can have that catfight

[Hook]
Bitches know niggas ain't shit
We cheat and lie, act like it ain't shit
So when we die, cremate us then put us in your douce
So we can run through that puss - one mo' time
Bitches know niggas ain't shit
We cheat and lie, act like it ain't shit
So when we die, cremate us then put us in your douce
So we can run through that puss - one mo' time

[Verse 2]
Yeah, niggas ain't shit (nope)
Twenty kids in your past made with the same dick
Now it's a wrap on your present like your dick is Saint Nick
Now she talkin' all loud in court
Like getting buckwild in sport, hollerin' 'bout child support
And you done paid up for e'ry kid
She spent yo' money on other niggas and getting her hair did
Putting Mac makeup all on her pretty face
Just to get the money shot later from Mr.Weapon Waist
Call Reverend Mase, tell him that I need prayer
And ask him is it a better place for players
I'm sorry, I dig a ditch for you critics
A black Ferrari to getting rich, I'm commited
The second coming of Ice Cube
Nigga stitched on my fitted Niggas ain't shit, I admit it

[Hook]
Bitches know niggas ain't shit
We cheat and lie, act like it ain't shit
So when we die, cremate us then put us in your douce
So we can run through that puss - one mo' time

[Bridge]
Yeah, one mo' time
Yeah yeah, just one mo' time (just one mo' time)
Baby one mo' time
Put your muh'fucking finger in the air and say one mo' time

[Verse 3]
I got you haters mind puzzled
How this ghetto as nigga thinking like Russel
Going independent was supposed to sink my boat
I was already aflout with my side hustle
Ice age ain't over for this Californian
But the recession hit yours like global warming
Neck look ice-less
Damnit man, your bare-ass wrist look timeless, as this rhyme is
It's all about choking chicks with my dick
Then get behind her like I'm giving her the Heimlich
Bend that tail over, ya dig?
I'm signing off, male chauvinist Pig-(face!)
