Who can push you off a summit onto a dagger that’ll stab your back
And exit your stomach after you plummet one hundred miles from it?
Who else can start a flea, tie you to the bumper of a moving truck
Hop on your body like water-skies? Gotta be the Crooked hombre
I put so many infrared dots on your shirt that n*ggas would think you were Kwamé
I'm twisting caps like I'm opening beers, been Loc'in for years
I've choked engineers till they've broke into tears, provoking your fears
Throwing spears at speeds fierce enough to pierce the hemispheres between both of your ears
I'm the deadliest death machine you ever seen with a guillotine
To put your neck between and sever everything extra clean
Blowing up a methophedine lab do, I'll stab you
I’ll be glad to beat you unconscious and what have you
I’ve been ill before n*ggas from Rock Steady could windmill
Aim steel shots in your wing shield, name me one buster who came raw?
He’ll get his body chopped quick as a n*igga with butter fingers juggling chainsaws
Get your jugularr vein punctured with blades
I'm the run away train like ten cowards f**king the same broad
Keeping it sown like patchwork and after more loot than a scandalous black church
Snapping your neck backwards till your sacroiliac hurts
I'll fracture your skull till your hats squirts blood all over your plashed shirt
Now that's mad dirt, you'll get your ass served whether or not I get the last word
Cos sh*t that I spit can dissolve matter, my raw data
On murder raps can pause your soft chatter cause you to all scatter
Then rip out your gallbladder with claws that'll leave your jaw shattered
Like you fell face first off a tall ladder, I'll batter any n*gga that touch the mic
Oh you a thug for life, yeah right!
Watch me hit you with hypnoses till the closest diagnosis is psychosis
I'm atrocious and ferocious, high voltage, I'm the dopest the flow is explosive
And potent enough to give your immune system a dosage of lupus eritematosus
It's hopeless! Honestly though
Your get clowned worse than an ugly b*tch in the front row of a comedy show
Cos I'm lethal, your see through, I keep you so afraid your looking up at the steeple, praying to God in Hebrew, like...
"Modeh ani lifanekha melekh hai v'kayam shehehezarta bi nishmahti b'hemla, raba emunatekha"
Crooked I never fears you!
I only wish you could rap faster than the speed of sound so I wouldn't have to hear you!
