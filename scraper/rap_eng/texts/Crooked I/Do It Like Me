[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Fresh tats on the neck, Ghetto smile on the face
Hennessy is in the cup, Pillsbury on the waist
20 G's on the wrist, Haters better give me space
Bosses don't give a fuck, Long Beach is in the place
Yea what's really real, Y'all know the dealy deal
Silly skill, Got my necklace froze on chilly chill
Fuck chrome give me mills, Crooked say what he really feel
You Milli Vanilli nigga that's your achilles heel
Me I'm in them White Tees and them ice cream sneakers
I'm a cream fiend for the green I might seem eager
Me and my team on the scene with 19 divas
Taking over the streets it ain't a pipe dream neither
Why you looking mad? You Ain't have to mean mug us
Cause the whips shut down dumb magazine covers
Jealous cats feeling like they have to bring ruckess
But without sipping syrup that strapaline suckas

[Hook: Das]
If you want to see me you can find me in the back of the club with my hat down
And if you really grindin' let me see you reach into your pocket pull a stack out
If you wanna beef than I can reach for the side of my hip and pull a strap out
Plus I got my gangstas in the place low kep in case you wanna act out

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
This is how we do our thing, We walk in the club deep
Chicks digging a niggas slang, love when a thug speak
Hollywood shades on, spittin' at them young freaks
Pull em' off the dance flo', Put em' in the front seat
Yeah my whole crew wild, Hustle at the [?]
New smile, 20 carrot grill what it do now
Crooked got a new style, Stop him who shall?
Stick together, get the cheddar, imma show your crew how
If it's money go go, If it's paper go go go
If it's fetti, cheese or deneiro you better go go
Do it how I do it and, Ride how I ride and
Roll how I roll then, You can follow me come on
I hate them niggas on MTV, Throw up a W but you never see them in LBC
Or CPT, or SC where do you be? We wouldn't see your face if it wasn't for BET
That's not me

[Hook: Das]
If you want to see me you can find me in the back of the club with my hat down
And if you really grindin' let me see you reach into your pocket pull a stack out
If you wanna beef than I can reach for the side of my hip and pull a strap out
Plus I got my gangstas in the place low kep in case you wanna act out

[Bridge: Das]
You gotta do it like me (like me)
Straight grindin' on the corner like me (like me)
[?] like me (like me)
Ima show you how do it like me (like me)

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Light Dodger hat stupid low, Medallion with dumb bling
Coupe cause foolish doe, 10 diamonds in one ring
Tease from the swap meet, Thuggin' on the club scene
Teflon the block heat, wearing it like sunscreen
Yeah what the deal is, Crooked been the real biz
Still is, Whole crew hungry we can feel ribs
Sick whips and ill cribs, Nope I don't feel pigs
Please don't pop off, ya boy boy peel wigs
Yeah I'm from the home of the Chevy Impala car keys
Still I gotta park my Ferrari under the palm trees
It's a brand new day on the west, Not to hate on the rest
But eh stay on your best, Okay
