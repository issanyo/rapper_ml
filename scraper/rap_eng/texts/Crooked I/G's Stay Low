[Interlude]
Time to get paid, tell me are you down
500 pounds then we send it out of town
Get a big sack, glip that, 'till it's all gone
Watch what you're saying, speak in codes on the phone

[Verse 1]
Ay, recognize game when you're talking to a killa
45 a pound, I can hit you with the killa
Call my cousing Sauce when you ready with the scrilla
Got that new bomb shit, silverback gorilla
Wanna teste the product before you buy? I'll bring some
Got a snow bunny bitch, call her Mrs. Green Thumb
'Cause all she do is grow weed baby
Bubble kush to that O.G. baby
Threw a couple dollars into a medicinal clinic
Slang illegal weed, we on a mission to get it
Just give it a minute, the Benz'll be kitted
The rims'll be spinning while the thickest pretty bitches are in it
Hustlers are color-blind, we unite (we unite)
My Mexican connects, always do me right
Got some bad ass chicas you should bring through the studio
Half Baked in this bitch, you know how the movie go
My iPhone rining 'cause business is beautiful
Opportunity knocking so let my nigga through the do'
Yo, snitches thinking I'm a rookie
I'mma put you in a hole deeper than your momma's pussy

[Chorus - X2]
Shhhh, real G's stay low
Make power moves, but don't let nobody know
Send a hundred pounds out of town, watch it go
Keep your mouth shut, if you're snitching you a ho ( you a ho)

[Verse 2]
Shhhh, if you snitch, you a ho
Cops they be crooked, it's me if you didn't know
They ain't trying to save the hood by getting rid of blow
They just want your black ass wearing them prison clothes
They gotta kill me, hope my mother say a prayer
Got a message for the governor and mayor
I'm a hustler and a player
Ask a brother if he care
About the laws you install
Middle finger in the air (bitch)
Yeah, fuck the D.A. and the judge
They ain't go up in the PJ with the thugs
Or the C-A where the slugs go (pow!)
Make the noise in the hood
Wanna see a dead body, we some Boyz N the Hood
At the BET Awards, naked sleeve retarded
Somebody need work, had to leave when it started
Back then the West was such a dead market
I had to bounce like, ''fuck a red carpet''
I'm a hustler
