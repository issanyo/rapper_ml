The lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum
I said the lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I walk around with OJ's glove knowing it fit
Fif to the toilet we taking over this shit
The Yaowa waited, salivated like man I know I can spit
I was knocking for quite some time but you wouldn't open this bitch
You turn green when I enter, probably can't breathe
Now y'all trees in the winter, nobody can't leave
For all those that was doubtful I got a scalpel
And a mouthful of vowels to make a party stampede
You brag about swag and your feminine trends
I belittle your riddle you Skittles with Eminem's friends
So I ain't trying to play with you, this chainsaw crack jokes
On Cain's brother brah, disable you
I'm an untamable animal with aim from a moving train
I could graze your decaying tooth
And my straight jacket just came unloose
I'm reporting live this is (BREAKING NEWS!)

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Psycho, like no, bitch made, nigga so
This grave, digga go, insane
I got the switchblade to your throat, move it's not smart
I'll slice and watch you bleed all over the pop charts
Me and the Slaughters run the asylum, I'm feeling
Like DiCaprio rapping on Shutter Island
This industry is pussy, guess who's gonna hit it the meanest
Give her the penis, hit the bitch in her Venus
To this game I'm addicted and fiendish, I'm predicted to bring this
G shit to it's pinnacle zenith, lyrical genius
So sick with ridiculous English, niggas get squeamish
When they hear this criminal linguist
Fall back it's the take over, y'all wack and ya cake over
I escape from the padded room, grab a broom and rape a male rapper's womb

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9]
I've witnessed the worst happening
The hurt moment when I'm purse snatching
I'm perp going berserk boning Miss nurse Ratched
When we spit you get the pug face
Your bitch swallowed my five dollar foot long on the subway
If sane people are rich why should I sit around?
Play me and end up like the back of this hospital gown, ass out
Drink drink drink drink, pass out
Y'all feel me right?
When I was young I was loud, I used to be like "I'LL KILL YA!"
Now I be like "You know I'll kill ya right?"
If y'all don't like it y'all can lick my dick
'Cause we built this house we live in brick by brick
