[Verse 1]
I hear you saying you want unity on the West Coast
But in reality your mentality is cut throat
Smilin' in my face while I'm pilin' C notes
All the while, you prayin' for me to be broke
I know a rapper like that, that's a fact y'all
Try to black ball me, can lick my black balls
Benjamin blockers get the gun clap dawg
When my backs against the wall, yeah I'm that raw
You'll never fuck with a boss again
Find a coffin to toss 'em in
You're so scandalous, you crossed your friends
They ain't West Coast, they all pretend
Better watch all them punk ass rappers
And them bitch made producers that you always keep around you
Cause they be tellin' the record executives negative shit about you, To cash checks without you

[Hook]
Put the mothafuckin' W's down
Bitch nigga we ain't fuckin' around
I don't care if you're born and raised
If you a hater we gone piss on your grave

[Verse 2]
If you a hater from the West Coast
You can't represent the West Coast
You bitch niggas on the West Coast
Can't throw up the West Coast
You snitch niggas on the West Coast
You can't breathe on the West Coast
It's a brand new West Coast
It's a brand new West Coast
I read you niggas interviews on the magazines
See you tellin' all them lies on the TV screen
All them Dickies and them white T's don't mean a thing
You ain't in the 'hood, you livin' in a fuckin' dream
Yesterday I seen some niggas roll by with them thangs, bang bang, there go brains on the sidewalk
Before the car could get away and change lanes, six shots flipped him over, get the coroner in white chalk

[Hook]
Put the mothafuckin' W's down
Bitch nigga we ain't fuckin' around
I don't care if you're born and raised
If you a hater we gone piss on your grave

[Verse 3]
All you haters on the West Coast
Yeah we know who you are
We kidnap 'em on the West Coast
Put 'em in the trunk of my car
Because you're fuckin' up the West Coast
Some of 'em may be stars
But we don't care on the West Coast
We blow you punk rappers to Mars

[Hook]
Put the mothafuckin' W's down
Bitch nigga we ain't fuckin' around
I don't care if you're born and raised
If you a hater we gone piss on your grave
