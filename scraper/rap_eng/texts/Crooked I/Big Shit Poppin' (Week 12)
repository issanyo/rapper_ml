[Verse 1: Crooked I]
I'm a hit the Mercedes lot, test drive 5s
Buy one then I'm gonna drop the top on the Westside skies
Let's drive by in that S-5 high
On them 22 inch rims, fresh white Nikes on the gas pedal
Bullet proof it if you blast metal
Why I need a ghetto pass when I'm past ghetto
Got a bad bitch, moving down Melrose
Baby got me harder than Superman's elbow
Stop at the shoe shop, grab them Lakers shell toes
West coast from head to toe, you might as well know
Helio cell phone buzzing on my hip
It's my cousin, he on sunset fucking with the strip
Throwing up C.O.B, thugging with the clique
You niggas want some drama, there's nothing we can trip
Got a pair .45s man, Siamese twins
Stir fry your noodles, call 'em my Chinese friends
Do it!

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Being broke is not an option, it's like breathing in toxins
Blocking your oxygen feeling boxed in
Cops want me in that Datsun
But I'm in that drop top, them seats are made out of Ox skin
I never take my paper chase for granted
In a drought you won't ever see the gangsta panic
I go apes bananas, bake bandanas, my game is mammoth
With my greatness I could change the planet
Like a 21-gun salute I aim for the sky
On some peach cobbler shit, I came for the pie
Long Beach mobster shit, won't change 'til I die
Who you gotta problem with, my gangsta'll ride
Ya'll niggas better know who I am
Put me under interrogation, I won't turn on my fam
Rather clap the shottie
I'm the poet Saul Williams trapped in a gansta rapper's body
Now let's slam that!

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Now I do it in my leisure
Crease up my jeans, pull my jewelry out the freezer
Then I swipe my Visa between the ass cheeks of a thick chick
Like tip drill, shit's real, nigga believe her
Nigga's an achiever, menaging these divas
Hit 'em in they beaver 'til they need a breather
They ain't worried about they nigga, Crooked's not either
Cause I keep a motherfucking automatic squeezer
Opened up a jewelry store, now they getting mad again
Cause I rock a cross that could blind the whole Vatican
Me and my chick like Jesus and Mary Magdalene
She on my side like Eve when she came out of Adam's abdomen
This for my niggas on the block trying to earn paper
For my college students fucking with them term papers
I'm on this West coast grinding
Couple niggas on my coast, yeah they want to stop me from shining
But I'mma do it!
