[Intro]
It's that time
You 'bout gettin' money?(La Familia)
You 'bout gettin' money?
C.O.B, crew love

[Hook 1]
In the COB it’s just us nigga
But I don’t really trust niggas
COB, it’s just us nigga
But I don’t really trust niggas
Sssutt sssutt, when you see us nigga
Say Sssutt sssutt, when you see us nigga
You just got on man, we’ve been them niggas
Ask these bitches man, we’ve been them niggas

[Verse 1]
All I’m doing gettin' all these Benjamins nigga
Independent still getting them dividends nigga
Crooked put so many rappers in the body bag I’ve lost count
Whole camps get crossed out, that’s the way the ball bounce
When it’s time to get rid of them niggas
Started from the bottom cooking ramen
Now I’m rocking shows in the Chi
Like a mixture of Twista, Lupe, and Common
Cause I’m a problem, put it on my mama
Raised in lamas when I chased them commas
Raised in the hood full of gangsta drama
Lying in the goddamn face of your honor
Gotta get it now can’t wait for mañana
I’m a chess player, Dominick got something in store for you niggas
Janikowski for 50 yards, I even up the score on you, nigga
We made men, so I gotta mop up the floor with you niggas
Get our money right and go to war with you niggas

[Hook 2 altered]
In the COB it’s just us nigga
But I don’t really trust niggas
COB, it’s just us nigga
But I don’t really trust niggas

[Verse 2]
This shit here for my loyal niggas
I’mma make sure that we all royal niggas
Keep our enemies close, I just might employ you niggas
Whole damn time we plottin' to destroy you niggas
Legit like that, I only trust my family
You don’t understand me, fuck your mami
We ain’t here to snatch chains
We here to make rap change, so you artists better tuck your Grammys
ABC rappers I turn your channels
I CBS, I draw heat, desert eagle full of dirty ammo
Drinking your blood like a thirsty camel
Then I’m pulling off in a Murcielago
Perfect lambo, stunting on you hating niggas
Praying on our downfall
But hell nah, we out here taking nigga
Even if I pull up in a beat up chevy
I bet my cousin Sauce roll weed up heavy
I bet that Horseshoe put dope in the streets
All you record labels get your Re-up ready, ok?
