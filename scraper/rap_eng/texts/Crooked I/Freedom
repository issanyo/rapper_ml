[Verse One] [Fred Knuxx]:
I feel like the last of a dying breed, these crackers be eyein' me
Trying to make it hard like, I ain't got mouths to feed
What happened to our peoples? Our leaders are all evil
They cheats us and say we equal, land of the bald eagle
More like spaces lethal, and the government was just placed here to deceive you
I always said that, these people parish from a lack of knowledge
So instead of seekin truth, you let them brain wash us
Our forefathers were nothing but slave owners
Get out of line today and they throw a cage on us
I'm not that token black dude, they wild out for neck room
I'd rather be the one that uplift our black youth

[Hook]:
We want freedom, by any means necessary
We want freedom, by any means necessary
We need freedom, by any means necessary
Give us freedom, by any means necessary

[Verse Two] [Crooked I]:
Are your thought really yours, or did they come from someone else?
Were you taught to think or do you think for yourself?
Wanna hide somethin' from niggas, put it on a bookshelf
Our minds aren't in good health, the hood is yelling "Crook help"
They put us in the city full of civil guerrilla warfare
We tell them we sick of killin but they don't feel us or care
Nor do they care for the innocent children born there
The system is as sick as Hitler, pissin' on niggas who poor(yeah)
Check your history, look at what they did to me
100 million dead, African remains in the sea
Then I see the transvestite Statue Of Liberty
Gotta have a dick for the way she fuckin' us niggas G

[Hook]:
We want freedom, by any means necessary
We want freedom, by any means necessary
We need freedom, by any means necessary
Give us freedom, by any means necessary

[Verse Three] [Fred Knuxx]:
Bush is the richest president (Why?)
Just look at 9/11 and see the evidence
It's all there, killers are innocent, for golden oil percentages
Then fool us and say its an act of terrorists
It's like the first album made by 50 Cent see
They get richer why we die tryin
They hell bound anyways so they are gonna die fryin'
The mark of the beast is the equivalent to the government
So why you think you tough as shit, on the block thuggin it
Beefin' with each other, they sittin back lovin' it
It's like, we living out the lettuce for when we were gettin lynched
And you wonder why we rebel and act militant?
Because

[Hook]:
We want freedom, by any means necessary
We want freedom, by any means necessary
We need freedom, by any means necessary
Give us freedom, by any means necessary

[Verse Four] [Crooked I]:
They see me in the Bentley, and they damn near wanna pass out
They say what they say, "You don't like America? Then get your ass out."
I work hard for my money, I don't need a handout
Even though you owe me reparations without a damned doubt
I smell something presidential, is that the kush?
Nah, that's a war, worse than them sacks you push
Pimp slap the wuss, the country is like a dog liftin its hind leg
Yyeah they all pissed at a Bush
Unseen men saying fuck it let's mislead 'em
Show them holograms of imaginary freedom
Feed them lies and cheat 'em
I'll remix the cliche, now I'mma say since I can't join 'em I'mma beat 'em

[Hook]:
We want freedom, by any means necessary
We want freedom, by any means necessary
We need freedom, by any means necessary
Give us freedom, by any means necessary
