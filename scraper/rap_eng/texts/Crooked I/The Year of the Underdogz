[Hook: Young Noble]
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this:
"Get off your ass if you plan to be rich"
And it's the year of the underdog, feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this:
"Get off your ass if you plan to be rich"
And it's the year of the underdog, feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air

[Verse 1: Young Noble]
[?] on that coupe
That youngin' on the stoop
Soaked up the game, epitome of the truth
I lead by example and do what I'm supposed to
Count on me to always come through, when the pressure's on
May no weapon form against them outlaws
We soldiers of God
Against all odds, this the year of the underdog
Still I rise, I told you niggas I will evolve
Into somethin' more bigger
Somethin' more powerful, more independent now
They gon' pay me by the minute now
Not just by blood, by soul [?]
Failure's never been an option
Get your paper my nigga, we eatin' lobster
The Noble and Gage Gully
Year of the underdog, real niggas ride with me now (now)

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
It' the year of the underdog
I'm rockin' gym shorts and J's in this rap game cause I come to ball
Allergic to sleepin'
Niggas servin' and schemin'
Yeah I'm one of y'all
A sketchy nigga because my gun'll draw
Where I'm from, kids been shootin' since laser tag
By the time they twenty they martyrs or someone's baby's dad
Cops wanna kill me cause I'm darker than a paper bag
Park the latest Jag by the police Sergeant and made him mad
Who cares what my enemy think?
Long as I'm grindin' 'til I'm literally breached
'Til [?] is givin' me minks
I'm hustlin' all night
On so much caffeine I'm literally pissing out energy drinks
And crew love and a small thing
That's why I'm on that hockey team shit, grindin' 'til we all kings
And them hatin' niggas, half them mean muggas
[?] magazine covers
We on nigga

[Verse  3: Gage Gully]
I don't sit in the house
Projects, we be gettin' 'em out
I'm state-to-state, cross-country
When they livin' in doubt
Can't be afraid to travel, I'm a warrior made to battle
I take the stage, tear that motherfucker down cause I have to
I'm popular with the dealers
I probably could get you realer
Or possibly order [?]
Tell your people we'll bill you
Want it now, cash out
In the streets, back routes
My movement [?], more traffic than a crack house
More action over here, gettin' dough so that counts
Gettin' 'dro, hustle six days of the week, then pass out
When they was tryin' to freestyle all I had was weed piles
I'm the concrete block sayin' "Gully a beast now"
It's cold I'm leanin' for no reason
Lookin' to bleed pounds
Soon as they catch on we takin' the cream then bounce
My team foul, [?] , you barely seen how
Walkin' the green mile
Gully, he triple-beam dream child
